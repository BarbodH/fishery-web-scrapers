570864,Guest,2008-01-17 20:32:00,0,"Take a serious look at Esnagami Lodge (www.esnagami.com). Only operator on this nice sized lake, incredible fishing, food and equipment. Been there many times though sadly not in the last couple years (have a cottage of my own now). At least call them... Talk to the owner, Eric Lund, and be sure to tell him that Henry Jr. (of the infamous ""Henry and Henry"" pair) sent you! Cheers. Henry Jr."

570905,Guest,2008-01-20 10:22:00,0,Osullivans went to a clothing site?? Esnagami.com has a nice site But I hate when a camp forgets to include the price of camps on a website . One good way to find a camp is to go to an outdoor show or All Canada show if you can.
570906,Mr Ranger,2008-01-20 10:25:00,272,Not sure why that did not work. Here it is again but try copy and paste.http://www.osullivansrainbow.com/ Good luck

570765,Guest,2008-01-15 15:34:00,0,"Would anyone like to help me out with recommendations for fishing lodges in Northern Ontario (North of the Sault); North East Ontario, or Western Quebec. Have a group that has been making trips for the last 17 years. Every 4 years or so we like to change camps. Have tried new camps the last couple of years and although had fun, not wanting to re-book. Anyhow we prefer drive in camps and normally use the outpost cabins, look for plenty of water, portages are nice, pretty much we like camps that are one step down from fly-in's with out flying in, in relation to sharing the lake with others. Almost sounds greedy, but you know what I mean. Walleye, Pike are the quarry, smallmouth a bonus. Use lodge boats and motors. See alot of Recommendations for NW Ontario, hopefully can get some help for N to NE Ontario or even Western Quebec. thanks in advance for anyone that can help."
570792,Guest,2008-01-16 10:38:00,0,"We've gone to the French River Lodge on NE Georgian Bay for years. We go in May, generally to fish for northerns. I'm based on eastern lake erie, so I don't need to go there to catch walleye. Just south of Sudbury, Ont.www.frenchriverlodge.com"
570796,A Canuck,2008-01-16 10:50:00,86,The WestArm is nice too. lakairlodge.com is located right @ Hwy 64. you can fish the Main lake or the westarm the choice is yours.
570800,Guest,2008-01-16 11:04:00,0,"Thanks X2; Looking for something a little more remote. Spent most of our time above North Bay, Sudbury, and Wawa. I appreciate your input. I too am from the Lake Erie area, and spend as much as I can on it. But, there is no taking away from being on a pristine lake with your close buddies jig'n up Canadian Eyes for a week. It's in it's own class. Is with me anyway. Thanks again tabuki"
570808,Guest,2008-01-16 13:10:00,0,"You might try one of the resorts along the Algoma Central Railway-north of Sault Ste. Marie. I my brothers and a sister in law stayed at Sonny Bob Lodge on Oba Lake many years ago-maybe 20 years. We boarded the train at Hawk Junction and rode to milepost 212-location of resort. Train stopped, we got out of the passenger car unloaded gear from flat car. On the way back, we flagged down the train and reversed the process. Not much for weight restrictions when traveling by train. At that time Sonny-Bob Lodge was available by rail or by plane only. Do a Google search on Algoma Central Railway resorts or lodges or fishing and you should find a resort of interest."
570811,Guest,2008-01-16 14:55:00,0,"Thanks Gary; Funny you should mention Sonny Bob Lodge. Was a pick of mine last year to try and get into the next couple of years....but last year was the last year for the camp. It is currently up for sale. They are selling the cabins individually. I appreciate the suggestion on the railway. We have done the sorts in the past to the east, and ran by rail up the spanish river out of Sudbury. Very memorable trips. Thx. If you don't mind taking the time, Did you fair very well 20 years ago at Sonny Bob? tab."
570816,Guest,2008-01-16 15:56:00,0,"As I recall it was late July or early August. One brother then attending Cornell University in New York took AmTrak and Via to Sault Ste. Marie, another attending Purdue drove to Sault Ste. Marie and I drove from northeast Iowa to Sault Ste. Marie. It was quite hot and we did OK. I think our biggest fish was a 6 lb. northern. We caught the most Walleyes arround noon on a bright clear day off a small island at the south end of the lake casting beetle spins or something similar. At that time we were the only people in camp that had one cabin with a flush toilet. I have had better fishing but it was a memorable trip. The short train ride was fun-in and out."
570826,EyeBanger,2008-01-16 21:20:00,23,"Here is a camp that has most of the elements that you are looking for, and is about 50 miles from Wawa:http://www.duenorth.net/prairiebeecamps/"

570844,Mr Ranger,2008-01-17 11:19:00,272,"Check O'Sullivans Rainbow resort west of Nakina. We have been going for five years and love it. Very remote, clean comfortable accomodations and family owned. I know that Bob and Shelly have a number of Ohio folks driving up. Lake has awesome walleye, northern and lake trout.www.osulivansrainbow.com Good luck"
