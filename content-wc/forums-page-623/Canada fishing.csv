571146,Guest,2008-02-01 14:18:00,0,"Looking to take my 3 boys and Gramps fishing the last week of May. I live in Green Bay, Wi so would either go on the west end of Lake Superior up into Canada or accross the U.P. through the Soo into Canada. Can anyone recommend a resonable Resort/Camp in those areas?"
571148,Guest,2008-02-01 14:32:00,0,"Hey Murphy, There is just too many choices available...give us a bit more detail on cost, guided or not, housekeeping (cook yourself) or Full American Plan (resort cooks your meals), and targeted species. I'm sure people will then be able to point you at some specific alternatives that fit your criteria. NWO Fishing Bum"
571149,Guest,2008-02-01 14:56:00,0,"Ya sorry, Walleye & Pike mainly. We will cook our own. I've been going to the same place for the last 4 years, about 2.5 hours East of the Soo and we caught 4 Walleye last year with 2 boats over 3 days. For the one big cabin or two of the small ones we pay about 600$ for 3 nights. We had 6 adults and 3 kids. Looking to keep it about the same $"
571156,Rich B,2008-02-01 19:46:00,1081,"Jerry, Suggest you check out www.happydaylodge.com which is a very nice camp outside of Chapalau (sp?) on a good walleye and pike lake. It is the only camp on a very good sized lake that is surrounded by an Ontario game preserve. There are a few owner cabins on this lake, and it offers a lot of water to fish (by yourself). Check out their website.....very nice younger couple own/run this camp (Bob & Sondra). Camp is very clean, well run and family oriented. The main problem will be for you to get a reservation for this summer, as they have almost a 100% rebooking rate (most folks return year after year). Another good guy on Walleye Central suggested (Jerry Bark) I go to this camp, and am thankful that I've fished this lake the last several years. Feel free to email me a note if you want more info....I went up twice last year (early July with my Wife and daughters) and in early Sept with my buddies. Good luck with your search....if you're serious about heading up to this camp (after you check it out, etc) I'd move fairly quickly to get booked. Faith, Family, Friends.....and Fishing. Rich B"
571160,Guest,2008-02-02 08:42:00,0,Thanks for the great info. I will check it out asap. Faith... Murphy
571164,lobo1,2008-02-02 15:34:00,734,You really ought to look into the Ontario fishing that is north and northeast of Duluth and not be headed towards the Soo. Some of the best fishing on the planet is at camps straight north of you. Look around this forum. The guys that are talking 100 plus fish per day per person - I have had many myself. spend some time looking around this site. lobo1
571165,phishfearme,2008-02-02 21:07:00,1242,let me second lobo's comments - i drive to the NW ontario region from PA - after many years of mediocre fishing in NE ontario we started going to NW 15 years ago and will never go back to NE. one data point - take a look at how many lakes in NE ontario that are accessable via road - almost all! then look at all the thousands of flyin lakes in NW. just my opinion but the long trip is totally worth it. phish
