570867,Guest,2008-01-18 07:16:00,0,Jerry & Ellie's Cedar Lake Camp puts on a full all you can eat fish fry at 12:30 every Tuesday. All you need to bring is your favorite beverage.
570874,Guest,2008-01-18 14:00:00,0,I believe Keystone Lodge on CL does that too..
570882,Guest,2008-01-18 22:00:00,0,"Hi Rose, Been to many different camps and everyone is a little different. Some have you bring just an appetite. Most will have guests bring a side dish and what they want to drink. Some serve fish purchased from a vendor. That was important for many people to know this. People wanted to know if the local fishery was being depleated for the fry. Personally I enjoyed the meals where something other than fish was served and guests just bring a side dish. Some camps waited until Wednesday but I always liked the feed earlier in the week. It makes it much easier to get to know other people in camp. Also, a fire pit going in the evening was also a nice way to meet others. I don't remember seeing a fire pit at Lost Bay when I was at camp. Something to think about with all of your improvements you are doing. PS: Did you ever make the Ord drive? It is a beautiful area. I almost forgot. I have a recipe for baked beans called ""Cliff Lake Beans"". It was almost worth driving 15 hours just to eat the beans. Hope this helps. Pete"
570883,Guest,2008-01-18 22:13:00,0,Are you going to give the recipe for the Cliff Lake Beans?
570895,Guest,2008-01-19 17:21:00,0,"we've gone to miles bay camp for 20 years. larry and sara and now matt and jen have always had a camp dinner one night of the week. in the summer it's usually fish and fries. in the fall it's a game dinner. we provide duck rollups and the hunters bring deer or moose tenderloin. there's always walleye and mashed potatoes, rolls etc. after a few pops around the lodge it is very enjoyable. we look forward to it as part of our annual trip. br"
570898,Guest,2008-01-19 21:40:00,0,"We now do have a fire pit and I would love to get my hands on the baked beans. If you share, I can give you a reward. Give me an e-mail at [email protected] Thanks again, Rose"
570901,fishmaster,2008-01-20 09:01:00,209,We go to Vermilion Bay Lodge and they have a weekly Sunday night shore lunch dinner for the guest. Nice way to meet the other guest and talk about fishing and life in general.
571496,Guest,2008-02-18 14:28:00,0,"Went to a lodge on Esnagami Lake north or Geraldton Ontario a number of times.Every Wed.the camp hosted a shore lunch on an island.We only had to supply the fish.Everyting else was taken care of by the camp staff.Free beer and wine,and quite a feed too.Galic bread,fish,beans,deep fried onion rings and fries.The fish was cooked personally by the camp owner.It was awesome!"
570767,Guest,2008-01-15 16:54:00,0,"Again, I'm looking for your feedback. For those of you who do the housekeeping plan, does your resort owner hold a weekly lunch or dinner? If so, what do they serve and do you like to attend? Thanks for the input...Rose"
570769,Fred_G,2008-01-15 17:38:00,908,One of the camps I go to has a weekly potluck. The camp provides the meat and everyone brings a dish to share. It's really a great time and I've met people who are now my friends. The other camp has a weekly hog roast done buffet style. Pretty much everyone is on the American Plan there because the food is so good. And you get to fish more. Both are lots of fun.
570770,Guest,2008-01-15 18:10:00,0,"The camp we attend does not have a specific night when all the guests get together. Everyone is usually on the housekeeping program, and comming off the water at all times during the evening. There is the usual ""get to gether at the dock to tell fish tales and swapstories and drink a beer or two"" almost every night."
570772,Guest,2008-01-15 18:23:00,0,Our lodge doesnt but I know a few of the other lodges on our lake (Cedar) do..our camp does have a nightly bonfire where a lot of people gather to swap stories and just shoot the breeze..
570775,prov1900,2008-01-15 19:05:00,544,"The bonfire is key. Make the area nice. I have been to a lot of resorts in my life. The ones I now return to on a yearly basis are the ones who have a nice bonfire area. Last year in Canada, it rained everyday and all day. The only night we could have a bonfire was on the last night. The fishing was spectacular, but we were all disappointed in the lack of fires."
570776,lazy eye,2008-01-15 19:56:00,3,"The camp we go to has a weekly lunch. It started out as a evening meal but moved to lunch a couple of years back to optinize fishing time and participation. We are responsible for bringing our own plate, flatware, and beverage. That way the owners don't spend all afternoon cleaning our dishes, It is a fish fry with a couple of side, bread and dessert. The owner buys whitefish from a commercial fisherman in the area. Really good. Just be sure you don't feed your guests anything you caught. The MNR really frowns on this one. Just keep this in mind to Rose. Once you start doing something, you will end up doing it til the day you sell your camp. Lazy Eye"
570791,Guest,2008-01-16 10:24:00,0,"Thank you for the feedback. Your right, if you start it, you are commited to continue, that's why I asked the question. I was also curious if people wanted to have fish. My thought if I start it up again, is to do it on a Monday at Noon. Would people want to eat white fish or maybe brats/burgers/ribs?"
570799,AllenW,2008-01-16 11:03:00,11482,"I think most would enjoy white fish as long as you didn't tell them it was white fish. Works with eel pout anyway..:) Nice thing about brats and such is they heat quickly and if you don't need to cook them they can be kept till next time, ribs and such are a bit harder to do that with. Think quick and easy, cheap maybe too. :) Al"
570804,JDP,2008-01-16 11:32:00,1457,"I have stayed at a resort for nearly 20 years that provides a Deck Party on a deck that is over the water. It is held every Wednesday evening, June-August, at 6:30 P.M. The resort provides everything; bas grilled burgers, beans, salad, lemonade, cake, etc. the only things guests need to bring are alcoholic drinks. The dinner is a huge hit with guests. I can only remember missing the party once or twice in 20 years, and that was because the weather and fishing were to great to go into camp!! :cheers:"
570815,SSH,2008-01-16 15:35:00,526,Sounds like Fisherman's Cove...
