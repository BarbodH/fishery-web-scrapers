However, are there any special regulations concerning returning to the US with a grandchild ,10 yr old. We are all citizens of the US and born in the US. does anyone know of a website with this info?"
571426,Guest,2008-02-15 11:29:00,0,The best site for US citizens ishttp://travel.state.gov/index.html I think the best thing you can do is (a) have a passport; and (b) have a notorized letter from both parents stating that as a parent they have given you the right to travel. Have the letter state where you are going and for what duration. cheers...IA Walleye
