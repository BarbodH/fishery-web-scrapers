571433,Obabikon,2008-02-15 18:24:00,2370,"I'll second Allen... September is the better fishing and bug month. Also, I prefer 60's and 70's temp vs. 80's and 90's. Just me though."
571441,Hump,2008-02-16 09:45:00,578,"I disagree, Wright's is more than a fishing camp. The blueberry fairy will take you blueberry picking!"
571442,Rose_Cliff Lake,2008-02-16 12:32:00,116,"AVS, When my husband took me to Canada 15 years ago, we did a fly-in. I knew I wouldn't have any options, like running to town, so I took my sketch book and pencils in case I got bored. Fish, read, draw, relax...it dosent get much better than that. If she has a hobby, she may want to bring something with her. A good book, camera, whatever. No matter where you choose to go, she will enjoy the Canadian experience. Rose"
571460,Guest,2008-02-17 12:05:00,0,"Sorry I haven't gotten back to your questions sooner but I've been very busy shoveling snow and we still have more coming. With all the muscles I'm developing this winter I shouldn't have any trouble with hauling in those fish this summer. Wright's have restrooms and showers in their cabins and garbage pick-up daily. Not sure why some people are saying there are jetskis, water skiing, or tubing being done there. I have never ever seen that and I believe Lee and Stephanie know that it would probably a death sentence for the camp and lake if it was to start. I must confess that they do have kayaks available (at no charge) if you wish to try your hand at it. Another GREAT peaceful adventure to experience while you are there. And as someone else mentioned, if you like blueberries and you hit it the right time of the summer you can pick plenty of them also. Another great opportunity to see a bear (just make sure you see it first). Not saying this camp is any better than anyones else but we love it there and they take great care of us while we are up there and we appreciate it and every moment we are there."

571254,Obabikon,2008-02-07 13:19:00,2370,"Thanks, and I will also say that Witch Bay is a well run resort. I've heard great things, and am planning to do a ""North Side"" of LOTW's trip this summer. I will probably stop by and check it out for myself. Anyhow, lots of positive feedback from Witch Bay."

571282,Guest,2008-02-08 15:13:00,0,I would suggest Wright's Wilderness Camp. Took my wife about five years ago and now she has to go every year and looks forward to it as much as I do. Eagles aplenty and some moose sitings and an occasional bear. If you take a trip to the dumps you'll see all the bear you you want. Evening rides on the lake are outstanding and if you hit it with a full moon you could be out all night. If you like to golf they have a resort membership and you golf for free unless you want a cart which you will have to pay for. I believe the web site is 'wrightswildernesscamp.com'. Best wishes on your decision.
571322,Guest,2008-02-11 14:48:00,0,Hey Bingo Thanks for the information... camp looks great How big is the lake and do I read it right that the cabins do not have bathrooms??
571336,Guest,2008-02-12 10:48:00,0,"I took my wife last year. It was her first time. Before the trip she thought she would get tired of sitting in the boat and wanted assurance that I would take her to the cabin whenever she was ready to go. by monday she was already using phrases like ""next year when we come"" and later said fishing is like gambling, ""Maybe if I try ...."" She loved it. hope yours works out well too."
571338,Mohleye,2008-02-12 12:46:00,368,"Wright's is on Gull Rock Lake, which is 16,000-plus acres, and part of a 5-lake chain. The cabins are modern with indoor plumbing."

571428,Guest,2008-02-15 12:47:00,0,"I would second Wrights if you are taking the entire family and would partake in or not mind the camp boat pulling tubes around the area, also had heard at one time the talk of adding jet skis, so if you are looking for a ""minnesota"" atmosphere, this is the place where you want to be!"
571431,Guest,2008-02-15 15:51:00,0,Wrights is a FISHING camp only. I have been there for years when it was weavers. I even think Lee has gotten on here and stated that he DOES NOT have jet ski's and things. By the way it ia beautiful camp and Lee is awesome and the fishing on gullrock is tip top.

571249,Guest,2008-02-07 11:44:00,0,"Four days on a Lake thats new to you is a challenge. It would be worth your while to take a guide the first day. Deer Horn is a well run cabin camp. The lake has a good walleye and pike population that can be taken trolling lures 8 to 12 feet deep (STORM hot'n'tots) and by jigging (3/8 ounce brown hair jig tipped with 2 inches of crawler) around points and small bays. For the time frame you mentioned, take lots of ""deet"" insect repellant........good luck"

The Witch Bay fishing program looks interesting and would be of benefit to my Gal Obabikon  I have no objection to your reply since you moniker is what it is but that's not for me to say"

I mentioned Minnitaki because it is small enough that you don't have to spend the entire day on the water. You can come in for shore lunch whenever you want and not feel like you just blew 300 bucks in gas. It is also very secluded, just like any other Canadian lake. Lake trout, smallies, pike, walleye...lots of walleye."
