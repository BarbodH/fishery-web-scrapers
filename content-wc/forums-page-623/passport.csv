Same experience here..I worked a booth for the resort I go to at the All Canada Show in Chicago in mid January..I applied for my passport there..the whole process took about 15-20 mins..I got it in the mail this past Monday and the birth certificate came the following day.."
571286,Guest,2008-02-08 18:21:00,0,I appreciate the All Canada Show and US Postal Service making the passport booth available at the shows. I went to the Green Bay show 13 days ago and my passport arrived today. I'm glad to hear my birth certificate will also be coming back.
571326,Guest,2008-02-11 18:28:00,0,not true. the govt might trigger the passport need anytime after 1/08 it costs 90 bucks or so to get a passport. it's cheap it's easy it's the future anyway unless this is your one and only trip. do it. took me 30 minutes. picture shoot the whole enchilada. got my passport in 3 weeks! go to the post office. i suggest you download the application from the www first. write out the checks in advance. go to the post office with a shoot capability and you're in piece of cake........plus you can get some stamps to pay those incredible gas bills p

571094,Guest,2008-01-29 19:13:00,0,I talked to a guy working the counter at the post office last week who didn't know anything about the passport card. He was the only one there and there was a line of people so I didn't ask to see if anyone else could help me. A friend talked to another post office who stated they should have the applications by Feb 1st. I checked the website and these cards look pretty nice and a little cheaper for those of us who may only use if a few times over the next ten years. Wingmann17
