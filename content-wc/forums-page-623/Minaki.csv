Has anyone used the various gps chips that show contours and structure with a handheld gps in the general area, or the Winnipeg River itself? I have read many threads and it seems the Navionics Great Lakes West is a good chip, but I can not find that it is compatible with any handhelds. The Gold 14 XG is compatible with the Lowrance H2O. Is that chip any good for topographic features? Also appreciate opinions of the best handhelds with mapping capability. Hope all have a good year fishing, Don"
