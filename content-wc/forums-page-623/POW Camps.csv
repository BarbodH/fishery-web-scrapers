Buildings are all down, but you can still make out where the camp was--east of Devils Elbow, on the north shore just before you enter Grassy Bay. Story there is the same as mentioned, most if not all of the POW's did not return to Germany."
571297,Goldeneagle,2008-02-09 08:16:00,78,"In 1960 we stayed with a camp owner, at Camp Nemegosenda near Chapleau, who had been a prisoner in Ontario. He was a German pilot who had been shot down and later met the pilot who shot his plane out of the air and they had a pleasant reunion. The camp owner didn't receive permission to stay in Canada until after he was forced to return to Germany. He immediately returned to Ontario with his wife."

571321,Guest,2008-02-11 13:56:00,0,Canada lifted the ban in 1951. Many POWs came back. I had the pleasure of working with some. Hard working and tough as nails. They had been through and seen a lot. archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-71-1642-11381/conflict_war/pow_camps_Canada/clip8 - 147k

571231,Bill Krejca,2008-02-06 13:33:00,6107,"Es, Interesting info. I am a little familiar with the subject, so will share what I know. I stayed at Turtle Portage with my vacationing parents before and after the war, and fished the area for many years, and continue to do so. The spot where the camp was is still somewhat apparent, but is starting to be grown over. It is on the northern shore, off a point on the right as you enter the first bay opening of the inlet. As I remember, very little was left of the camp when I saw it for the first time after the war, about 1948. One cabin that is in Obabikon Lake is allegedly made from the wood, and I believe several other buildings were constructed elsewhere from the scavenged camp building timber. The area where the cabins were used to be a good spot for berry picking, most of the trees having been removed when the cabins were built. If you go there, watch out for poison ivy. Re: Dugout canoes mentioned in the articles- I have a picture of a very young boy, yours truly, paddling in one of the canoes. We found it on the beach by Last Point around 1950, where it must have drifted, and became covered with sand for some number of years. The story was that the prisoners were allowed quite a bit of freedom, and could paddle around the lake, but were to be shot if they crossed over the portage into Turtle Lake. Maybe more than you wanted to know, but hope it helps,"
571233,Flip Silverlake,2008-02-06 15:11:00,645,There are a lot of guys that were held there during the war that never went home. I met one this summer and he just loves it in Kenora. For that matter so do I!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
571248,Obabikon,2008-02-07 09:51:00,2370,"The Obabikon Lake POW camp is really run down. Infact, the cabin infront (was blue, now painted white) was built a long time ago by a former soldier (I was told). The ruins of all the old buildings are still back there, but nothing but old rotten wood. Still a neat hike!"
571252,Guest,2008-02-07 13:01:00,0,I have gotten the impression that a lot of the pows from germany decided to stay here and not go home. I would intersting to know how many stayed and how many went home? anyone know? I read the article and it was very interesting.
571261,Guest,2008-02-07 18:39:00,0,"My father tells stories of when he was a kid - 10 or 12 years old - he would go with his grand parents who worked at Calvert's Whitefish Bay Camp during the Depression and during the war and he remembers the German prisoner of war camp. It was an officers camp and he remembers seeing them on Sundays, which was their day off, paddling canoes that they had made, around the portage at Turtle Lake. He remembers talking with them. They were put to work logging around Alfred's Inlet and after the war, a few years later, when he was older and guiding, my grandfather and father would hunt Whitetail on the logging trails and clear cuts with guests from Clark and Crombie's. Another interesting note from the old days - I've heard many stories - Dad tells that since there were no phones, they would get a letter at Calvert's Island camp that guests would be coming on a certain day. They would go by boat and then take the truck out to the gravel road that ran north from Nestor Falls and they would sit and wait all day for someone to show up and if they didn't show they would go and wait the next day......"
571264,Guest,2008-02-07 20:06:00,0,"My Dad, brothers, and I used to camp and fish Alfred's inlet and Turtle lake for many years. We would rent boats from Vic and Dot's resort and boat in to the same island that we always camped on. I remember the POW camp - my Dad would point it out to us as we passed it - even though we (brothers) always recognized and remembered it from year to year. Often times we would pull up the boat, and walk the land. If memory serves, it was slightly sloped toward the lake, and Dad would make mention about how difficult it would have been to clear that land, with the primitive tools they had at the time. What a great spot for a POW camp! If were ever a prisoner, I wouldn't mind a spot like that. With all of the islands, it would be tough for a person to paddle themselves out without a map, or a photographic memory. I also remember a lot of berries growing there, as well as a very healthy population of woodticks. That area holds a very special place in my heart. We have since ""progressed"" to the point where we don't camp anymore, but stay in outpost cabins."
571280,Guest,2008-02-08 14:23:00,0,My Dad always tells story's about german prisoners that were in Flanders (between Fort Frances and Atikokan) near Mine Centre. My Grandfather had a logging business and he had prisoners working in his camp. He always used to laugh that they only had one escape. They caught him in Ignace after days of travelling through the bush. They worked hard and stayed and worked after the war. Where were they going to go. Train only and in the middle of the canadian wilderness. They were being treated very well and loved it here. My dad still has a leather cased (which one made for him) bird book. It fits in a Wooden case which one of the pow's carved. ( of course they were not supposed to have knives he always joked) He was 5- 7 at the time and was at the camp all the time.
571292,bellbuoy,2008-02-08 19:48:00,490,"I found this article on the Internet about it. http://www.pinetreeline.org/other/other2/other2al.html It states there were five camps of 100-125 men at each camp. ""The Ontario-Minnesota Pulp and Paper Company (O&M) built six camps in the Lake of the Woods area. Five camps were nestled throughout the bays and islands of Lake of the Woods. Two camps were situated on the Aulneau Peninsula. Camp 56 (Alfred Inlet), and camp 57 (Ghost Bay). Camp 61 was situated at Oak Point on the western peninsula. Camp 52 was at Red Cliff Bay (now POW Bay); and Camp 43 was on Adams River near Yellow Girl. The last work centre, Camp 60, was on Berry Lake. Each of the camps contained between 100-125 men and the POW's were a mix of navy, air and army personnel with a few from the German merchant marine."" Bellbuoy"
