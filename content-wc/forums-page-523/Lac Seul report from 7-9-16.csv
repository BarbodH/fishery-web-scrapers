1221982,Noel,2010-07-24 06:54:00,115,"Steve, Just got back from Onaway Lodge last night. Somewhat slow fishing on Friday and Saturday but it really picked up as the week moved along. Had several incredible days on Tues, Wed and Thurs with easily 50-60 eyes in the boat in the mornings. The weather was great mostly and we found fish scattered and very light biting early in the week but then they started biting well. You can tell they have the feedbag on when they get in the boat and spit up half digested minnows. On Monday we were in a slot area in Ghost Narrows when 4 boats roared up and started fishing around us. But they stayed a respectable distance from us. I think this happens when the fishing is slower. Later in the week we saw fewer boats and I attributed that to the better fishing that maybe keep folks from searching for another spot. I even saw Blair out on the lake on Wed. -never saw him fishing before. BTW- it seemed to be a minnow bite for us all week. I had taken along all kinds of GULP varieties and that stuff would not work. You could feel them pecking at it but would not hold on. Switched back to minnows and you would get a hard strike. We all tried Gulp with little to show for it. Nitecrawlers didnt work as well as minnows either. And 502 was awful again going up. Miles of gravel construction and many delays. We came back home the other way past Kenora. Noel"
1222431,Steve of Madison,2010-07-26 09:57:00,230,"Noel........GREAT so you had a good week of fishing the week AFTER we were there!Seems that is always the case....should have been here last week......etc.I knew it was just a matter of time before the feed was on, glad you hit it.I have my reservations in for the 7/8-7/15, 2011. Counting the days already."
1222452,dutchboy,2010-07-26 11:00:00,5717,Carry a Muskie rod and sling baits are far as possible when people come up on you like that. If they get close enough bounce it off their boat.
1222808,T-MacMN,2010-07-27 12:01:00,8,I couldn't agree more - most people who show up on LacSeul don't fish that often and don't have a clue as to where to go...I would recommend a Musky Rod with a large plug and start casting toward them!
1223001,archer66,2010-07-28 01:42:00,21,"Glad to hear Kathy and Blair are doing well. Steve, did you bump into a bunch of guys from Hannibal Missouri while you were there? If so I work with a few of them. They said they had a fun week. I didn't book a trip this year but might next year. I love Onaway and have been there under 4 different owners and Kathy and Blair run the best camp by far. It pains me to say that I most likely won't be going back to Onaway anytime soon though because of the number of boats we saw on our last trip. We had exactly the same experience you describe pretty much every day. It happened to us in McKenzie, it happened in South Inlet, it happened at Manitoba point, it happened at Cedar Island, and it happened in South Bay. South Bay was by far the worst...pretty much every time we got settled in on a good spot, a boat or two would pull in and join us. Each time it happened was when we were drifting a hump or shoreline or back trolling. I couldn't decide if folks don't realize that I was working that area by repeatedly running over it or if they really just didn't care. In each case I just packed up and went somewhere else. Anyway...future trips to Canada for me will be on fly in lakes with limited numbers of parties."
1223035,Steve of Madison,2010-07-28 08:13:00,230,"Archer....yes they were there as well, it turns out I went Snow Goose hunting a couple of years ago with Joe, and Buzz Ballinger was in our group, small world!It's too bad some guys figure it's Ok to crowd on in. But I certainly don't blame the lodge owners. It's just those guys that are from areas that have big pressure that think it's Ok to shove right in. I go for the experience and try not to let it bother me. I really think that this year was different because guys were searching for fish. When you hit them all over the lake you don't see the boats traveling around at mid morning or mid afternoon looking for a new spot, I did this year. The old rule applies ""don't leave fish to find fish"". But I saw way to many boats running and gunning around in search of fish, that tells me everyone was trying to solve the puzzel. I didn't, but it was a great trip in spite of it all and my reservations for next year are in."
1223147,greg2648,2010-07-28 14:15:00,80,We were at Lac Seul (lac Seul Lodge) the second week of July. We had great fishing. We fished South Inlet one morning and only saw one other boat in the whole area. We fished another morning at the Big Sand Banks (Mckenzie) for about 4 hours. We saw one boat at the Banks. We did see two other boats head up the bay Northeast. We fished Broad Lake for about 7 hours and had the whole lake to ourselves. We always see boats on the lake or at the mouth. We caught more walleyes this year than any other year we have fished in Canada (30 years). Good Luck.
1220969,Steve of Madison,2010-07-20 13:21:00,230,"Just wanted to get a report of what we found last week.Another great time at Onaway Lodge, as usual everything was top notch.The walleyes seem to be gathering along structure but deep, we caught some on the midlake humps and on top of structure but not in numbers like previous years. The weedlines are not as defined as I would have thought but we caught good numbers when we found them. Water is down about a foot not much more, and water temps main lake are around 68-70 with back bays 70-72. We had 1 good hot calm day and surface temps got as high as 76. The wind was bad on weds and thurs and really struggled those days, if you found a protected spot that you could fish some guys did real well, I didn't.Now my complaint.......is the best fish finder a pair of binoculars? REALLY!After searching all morning we finally hit on some fish in a small cove area near Ghost narrows. Within 10 minutes of going thru the spot a couple times and then starting a drift 4 boats were on us. I hesitate to name camps but I could. And I could have easily hit all 4 with a cast, do guys really look around the lake waiting for another boat to start catching then move in. While we were searching I saw 1 other boat about a mile away, as soon as we stopped they were on us. 100 sq miles of water within driving distance and you guys have to sit next to us. I didn't bring my fishermen bait bouy this trip but you can bet I will have it with me from now on, I guarantee that if you throw that out anywhere some knucklehead will fish it."
1221060,tly,2010-07-20 18:06:00,1900,"I was not there, but a group went to one of my favorite spots (heretofore 'secret') and really cleaned up with many fish above the slot as well as a 58"" musky. Mostly 5-8' water. Water was down acording to them. Wish I was there."
1221061,IA Nate,2010-07-20 18:07:00,12,"Could not agree with your complaint more, Steve. Several occaisions we'd start to get into fish and find boats immediately parked on all sides. Now, this should not happen on Lac Seul. There are plenty of places to fish, and in most cases each particular spot has enough fish for everybody--which is all the MORE reason to not have to crowd other boats. I heard from other people in camp (Disclaimer time--Steve and I were indeed at the same camp on the same week!) who told of other boats parking right in the direct path of where they were trolling. Next year, I think that is going to be cause for a call of ""RAMMING SPEED!"" Just kidding. Maybe. Not. As for the fishing....Steve is correct. Fish were there, in their usual spots, but you'd only catch a couple, then have to move on. My group had one day where we (in our estimation) really ""lit them up."" The rest was spotty. Still, it's Lac Seul. It's pretty hard to complain! Yes, Onaway is a wonderful camp. Blair and Kathy are great hosts and run a clean, well-maintained camp. Best we've stayed at, which is why we are already booked for 2011. Steve, we won't be next door in 2011. Moving up the hill to a larger cabin so you won't have to hear us howl at the moon! : )"
1221497,Steve of Madison,2010-07-22 10:52:00,230,"It was great seeing you and the rest of the ""usuals"" at camp this yr. I am looking to book the same week again next year but we are looking to move to a little smaller cabin, (just to big a group for my tastes).I guess nobody else wants to weigh in on the ""fish finder"" controversy, either that or they know who they are!!!"
1221514,wallydave,2010-07-22 12:02:00,2151,"At times some folks will troll by and ask how they are biting, smlie and will move about 15ft away start fishing. Not a big problem. The ones I do not like, boat right next to you drop anchor with so much as a nod or a go to H@#$. But the fishing gods seem to frown on this, we still still be bringing 'em in, and the ""poachers get nothing but snagsThen all is right in the world!"
1221540,tv4fish,2010-07-22 13:15:00,2694,"I guess nobody else wants to weigh in on the ""fish finder"" controversy, either that or they know who they are!!!Hey Steve; I'll ""weigh in"" (AND - I'm not one of ""them"" either) -- I live on good ole' Mille Lacs Lake in Minnesota. What you describe happens all the time here -- of course, Mille Lacs is like a big old dishpan so you can spot a boat 2 miles away. And, the structure is also not like a Canadian shield lake. I agree though, especially in Canada, with all the lake structure, points, humps, etc. - any boat operator with any scruples should not be ""moving in"" on another boater's territory. We have had it happen to us even on big old Lac Seul - we were using a controlled drift to work a good point - you know, motor up to the start, drift down the point, motor up and repeat the process. Sure enough - when we got down to the far end, another boat who had been watching us, moved right ahead of us to the start point before we could get back up."
1221544,Moondog,2010-07-22 13:20:00,362,"We were wind drifting a line along the green buoy in Keg Lake in June when up roars a boat (Wisconsin License) and goes between us and the shore creating a huge wake. THEN......they parked their boat and anchored exactly in the path of our drift ( which was extremely obvious). So then I used my trolling motor and rolled right up to the side of their boat, down the side, across the front and up the other side and said ""Mind if I fish here?"" Wasn't 5 ft from the guy and his wife and he said ""well I guess not, you were here first"" and they never moved. Aren't people funny???"
1221578,dkrusin,2010-07-22 15:02:00,97,"One of the reasons we stopped going to Lac Suel was boat traffic. The last time I was there we went back to Mckenzie Bay, holy crap I thought I was at the Red Wing **** in early Spring. There had to be over 40 boats on the sand bar, some anchored , some driftied, some trolling...a real cluster . We decided to leave and try some now spots on the way back to camp (3 boats). Just about every where we stopped we would soon have company..and we wern't catching anything.Anyway, we started going to Lake St. Joe about 5 years ago and have not been within shouting distance of another group since. Better fishing, better accomodations and no other boats. Another 3 hour drive but absolutley worth it."
1221585,NCESI,2010-07-22 15:34:00,249,"We were fishing Lac Suel many years ago and I was in a boat with a friend. He was one of the most likable people you could ask to fish with and extremly friendly. We were up in the Chamberlin Narrows around opener and my friens pulled up beside two Canadian boats a bit too close for my taste and litterly threw out the anchor, and said hellow to the other boats. This was unappreciated by the others and soon they pulled up their anchors and began circiling our boat getteing ever closer on each round. Finnaly when you could almost touch their boats with the end of the rod one of the other guya in the other boat looked at my buddy and just said ""Big Lake Eh"". My buddy finally realized his mistake of being overly friendly and moved on."
1221882,Steve of Madison,2010-07-23 15:35:00,230,"Don't get me wrong here, LS is a BIG lake and there are plenty of spots to fish, and I could have moved on just as easily as anyone else. And I certainly do not have a right to claim a shoreline as ""my spot"" or the like, but I just felt this was a little to intrusive. Later in the week everyone was searching for a spot to get out of the wind. We set up along a long sandy shoreline to drift, when about 50yds downwind comes a big boat with who looked like Santa driving. Santa and his wife proceed to backtroll about 25yd ahead of us all the way down the shore. I was going to lob a spoon at them or say something when my grandson told me it wouldn't be polite or prudent to pi$$ off Santa when I will be asking for a boat for Christmas. We had a good laugh and called it a day!"
