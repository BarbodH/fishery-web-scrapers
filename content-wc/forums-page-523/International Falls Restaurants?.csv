1223934,Stu,2010-07-31 00:09:00,472,We always cross the border in the early am and eat breakfast at the Harbourage next to Rainy Lake Sports. The Mousse is a great place but it's always crowded. Tried to eat there 2 weeks ago and there were about 20 people waiting outside by 7 o'clock. We went to The Spot instead. We were very impressed. Good food and service and HOT waitresses.
1223968,MorganMan,2010-07-31 06:34:00,341,"Can you think of anything more a group of guys could ask for than HOT waitresses after a week in the bush with a bunch of fat, smelly dudes? Thanks, Stu."
1224006,nitrodude,2010-07-31 08:54:00,60,"We've been stopping at the Border Bar for pizza on our way back from Seul the past 15yrs. The ""Stickman"" is my favorite. After a week of camp food, it's a great fix for a junk food craving. I agree with the others that The Chocolate Mousse is a great place,too. It's our yearly breakfast stop."
1224011,P. Norts,2010-07-31 09:17:00,396,"Hello, Don't know if you will be traveling with kids, but we always hit Giovanni's our last night in town. They have good pizza and EXCELLENT deep cried cheese curds. They have a relly nice game room and it is a great unwind for a family. Mama Norts"
1224062,MorganMan,2010-07-31 15:48:00,341,"I have had my fair share of ""tickman"" pizzas from Border Bar Nitrodude.....I concur!"
1224071,Glenman12,2010-07-31 16:28:00,762,We pull out of camp at about 4:30PM and spend the night in IF..after checking in to our motel we head right over to the Border Bar..and then breakfast the next morning at the Moose
1223373,stardaddyed,2010-07-29 09:13:00,20,Will be in IF Friday. I have been told the Chocolate Mousse Restaurant is a must visit for breakfast. Any good place for dinner? Is there any special northern Minnesota specialty (not Badger road kill)?Ed
1223426,chevtow,2010-07-29 11:45:00,691,Never hit the Moose for breakfast but we have dinner there every year and it's always good.
1223433,Jimmy Jig,2010-07-29 11:56:00,1905,There was a place down the road from the Days Inn on the East side of 53. It was first class......Spots or something like that.
1223440,Blackmacs,2010-07-29 12:10:00,2121,"There's a few around. The Spot which is on 53, Chocolate Moose also on 53, Almost Lindee's out HWY 11 towards the lake. They are a BBQ place. The Thunderbird is also a good place if you're looking for a nicer meal. There is also a Hardee's East on 11 that is really good. The owner is a hard core fisherman."
1223441,tv4fish,2010-07-29 12:22:00,2694,Ed: Now I think you have your states mixed up -- the BADGER road kill w/b from Wisconsin -- in Minnesota it w/b Gopher road kill.
1223474,2Labs,2010-07-29 14:08:00,685,"Yah! And, in addition to the geography lesson, BOTH Badger and Minnesota road kill taste pretty good, so stop insulting us!! Of course, Badger road kill tastes just a little better because we always add melted cheese topping! And, by the way, we have friends (from Wisconsin, Illinois, and Iowa) that ALWAYS stop on the way back from Witch Bay Camp on Lake of the Woods and do breakfast at the Chocolate Mousse. They highly recommend it."
1223543,rpieske,2010-07-29 18:04:00,1276,The Chocolate Moose is excellent for any meal. I eat there every time I go into I. Falls. My favorite restaurant there.
1223616,JayM5209,2010-07-29 22:27:00,1050,What. . . . . . no one's suggested lutefisk yet??
1223649,Mark R,2010-07-30 06:11:00,1538,"If you drive thru Cloquet stop at Gordy's Tophat for a burger, onion rings & shake. They were featured on Diners,Drive ins & Dives last week"
1223686,tv4fish,2010-07-30 07:35:00,2694,"Jay ---- I thought about it ------- But, I don't want to be banned from the Board"
