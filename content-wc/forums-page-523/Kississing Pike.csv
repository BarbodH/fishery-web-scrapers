I just wanted to share with you guys a great pic of a great fish we got last week. The group I was guiding were some really good fisherman, who really allowed me to work the weedbeds hard, and didn't lose faith. We got some great fish, 3 were over 41 and many were bigger than 35"". The biggest fish was 46""."

1220707,Bigfishhunter,2010-07-19 16:10:00,803,"When fishing for pike in areas that I know hold them, I am very patient and find that I am often rewarded. I don't expect it to be slow, but if I am in a weedbed where I know they are laying, I am not inclined to move just because, I like to continue to pound it. Sometimes I will leave and come back, other times, I will just try something else. The fish are down there, even if they aren't snapping, you just want to be there when they finally do decide to chomp. Case in point; I pulled up to a large weedbed being worked by another guide, I let him work it with the wind and I didn't cut him off, we basically fished his old used up water, we got a few nice fish. When he was done his drift, he left. I finished it and went back and worked it again. As I worked it another guide came in behind me and worked the bed behind me. Now, many would not like this thinking that the bed is messed up, but as I was leaving the bed after my third drift, I saw the guide get his net out. Back at the lodge I found out that it was a 42"" fish. That bed was being pounded by the previous guide then, me and then this guy. Right place right time. They are down there, you just want to be there when they decide to go. I usually plan to hit 5-6 spots in an afternoon. That is depending on how hot they are and the size of the locations. We do well at Kississing in the thick stuff, especially in the narrows."
1220901,Guest,2010-07-20 09:28:00,0,Nice fish. When it is slow do you ever turn a bunch of circles with the boat and stir up the weed bed? I have done this before with some good success.Seems like when you scatter the bait fish out of their hiding spots the pike will start feeding.
1221299,Bigfishhunter,2010-07-21 14:42:00,803,"I like to keep the bed as undistrubed as possible, I feel I have the best chances when I pull up to a weed bed that hasn't had any traffic whatsoever. On the lakes I fish though, this is very possible as they are huge and they don't get a whole lot of traffic. Each spot is different. Some beds will give me fish, drift after drift after drift. Other spots I will leave after the first drift, cause I have tried time and time again and after the first attempt it shuts off."

1221888,Bigfishhunter,2010-07-23 16:00:00,803,"Just thought I would add to this thread a bit. My buddy is the head guide/manager of the lodge and he sent me a few more pics. One of the fish is another 46"", there is a 43"" and 2 41""s as well. This was in two afternoons of fishing with his family, who came to visit him. So many people refuse to book trips in late July early August cause they think the fishing dies down. I disagree with this, and in fact late July is better than June because of more stable weather and more stable fishing patterns, they will always be in the weeds, and the weeds will always be up in July."
1222772,Guest,2010-07-27 10:12:00,0,More nice fish!! It has been several years since I have been up there but always did well.Just a heck of a long trip for me. We always went up the 2nd week of Sept. Makes we want to go back now..LOL! I think you should give that stirring up the weed bed trick a try after you are done fishing it how you like to. Good luck and keep the pic's coming!
