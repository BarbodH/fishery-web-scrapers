He told me about two guys that he took out that started complaing before they left the dock, Boat wasn't good enough (20' Lund/150HP/full electronics) they complained that every place he stopped didn't look fishy enough. Every fish they caught was to small or didn't fisght like it should. The minnows were to small. After a couple hours of this the Guide took them back to the dock and told them to get out of the boat and never call him again. They told him they wouldn't pay. He said he didn't want their money he was going home and play with Momma."

1223249,2746,2010-07-28 19:27:00,3206,Some guys should just not do House Keeping!
1223299,Obabikon,2010-07-29 04:13:00,2370,LOL... I know you guys too well. It was probably a trap for a practical joke! And I definately won't come down there for a mosquito... no telling what's going on down there!
1223327,SSA,2010-07-29 06:10:00,19,"Propane fish cooker inside a cabin, had that happen to us as well, the end result of that situation that group burned down the cabin....Heres a simple one yet at the time the customer was very serious, during a camp check one day at a fly in lake. Guy approached, said he had a serious problem. The basics of his problem. When taking a poop he didnt like the water splashing up on his butt because the outhouse hole was full of water after it rained...."
1223355,dkrusin,2010-07-29 08:06:00,97,"On a trip several years ago we fried fish (outside) After supper went for a walk and came back to dump the grease back into the original containers ( standard operating proceedure). Anyway, the grease was gone, I asked where it was and a new member of the group said he dumped it down the drain in the cabin ( a sign by the sink said DO NOT DUMP GREASE DOWN DRAIN...holy crap). About an hour later the camp owner stopped by saying the water would be shut off for a couple hours until they got the main sewer line unplugged. Its no wonder that camp owners can be a bit on the edge at times"
1223372,stardaddyed,2010-07-29 09:10:00,20,Going to Canada for the first time tomorrow. At least I know what I shouldn't do! 1) Fry fish outside.2) Don't insult the guy who is taking you out into the wilderness miles from anywhere and is your only way back.3) Remember you are in a cabin and it is not a 4 star hotel....bugs happen.4) Complain the whole time about something the owners can't control.Wish me luck!Ed
1223374,tv4fish,2010-07-29 09:22:00,2694,UMMMM - Ed --- I think you meant - Don't fry fish INSIDE Unless your cabin is THAT bad --- and you're planning to burn it !!!!!!!!!

1221890,Bigfishhunter,2010-07-23 16:13:00,803,"Now, in light of the ""When not to go back"" thread, and how much people talk about good and bad outfitters, what if some guides/outfitters gave us there stories of terrible guests.???!!! They did this on Bowsite.com and it was hilarious. I could give a few, some that would just make you shake your head, some that would make you laugh, and others you would wonder how I kept my cool. I don't think that I will however, given that this is a different crowd than what visits bowsite. Maybe some of the other outfitters/guides will chime in. Or maybe you were in camp with some dufus' that you just couldn't stand and you could tell that the outfitters tongue was bleeding trying not to say anything."
1221894,Obabikon,2010-07-23 16:40:00,2370,"lol... First, I want to say that it would take an absolute TON for me to reject someone's business. Something I've never had to do and never want to. But, to say the least, some groups are easier than others. Last year, I had an older couple here for 3 days and 4 nights. Every single night they got me out of bed with a ""complaint"" after 10pm. Night 1: they asked if they could switch cabins to one that had a better view of the night sky. Response: I'm sorry, but none of our cabins have sky lights... we will however move your beds next to the window Night 2: they wanted for me to set up a guide for them the following morning... at 10PM. Response: I'm sorry, but everyone's in bed, and I'll have to try to call one of the guides in the morning Night 3: (seriously this happened) There was a spider climbing on their ceiling fan Response: Walked down their squished it and wished them a good night. They were great people. Very polite and enjoyable to have. Just a lot of work. And, a little out of touch with the actual work that goes into running one of these. Most resort owner's days start at 5AM... so, 10:30 is pretty darn late."
1221899,gregk9,2010-07-23 16:50:00,625,YIKES!! Talk about high maintenance!!!
1221912,Stu,2010-07-23 17:54:00,472,"Hey post the link to that thread. I surfed several pages and couldn't find it. I usually try to spend a little time and get to know my hosts. After a few beers, they usually open up and tell a few stories. One camp owner complained of a group that cleaned a 30"" walleye (he had a strict no trophy policy). When they checked out, they left their cabin filthy and he found an entire burned lasagna in the oven. I don't think they were welcomed back."

1222846,wallydave,2010-07-27 14:17:00,2151,"I have been at Goose Bay more than once with guys who seem to love breaking all the rules they can, drinking in the boat, keeping trophy fish, catching over the limits, ect. They seem to have I am an Amercian, your rules don't apply to me attitude. If I have had to deal with bozo's like that, I could pretty unhappy too! One or two bad apples like that makes the rest of us look pretty bad! I hope this thread will help educate those types that can make Americans look bad!"
1222879,Obabikon,2010-07-27 16:11:00,2370,Americans or Canadians has nothing to do with breaking rules. There's jerks and morons on both sides of the border.

Maybe next year jack and I will pull you out of bed to kill off some of the mosquito's in the cabin I am surprised you did not come on over and get some of our porkchops we had waiting for you"
1223052,labsrus,2010-07-28 08:41:00,557,"OK not a guide or outfitter but we have had some real bad guys who we asked to hlp us fill out a group to make it and even number. On one flyin trip a few years ago, a firend invited one of his co-workers, lets call him Bill to protect the innocent. He annoyed us in several ways. Brought a Ham Radio with him and talked for hours each night. Problem was he would put earphoines on bute we could heare him using his call letters and saying ""over"" numerous times. We always like to set up the coffee pots the night before so that the first person up would just need to turn the burner on to start the coffee. He claimed that the coffee would get stale and that he would make it in the morning. Problem was he was a late riser and someone else would have to make the coffee. We stopped this after mid week. He went around and set the table with pretty napkins each nigh for dinner. While a nice touch it was annoying. Bill made fish one day for us on the grill, claimed to need to sprinkle each fish with his secret ingredient one at a time, Well we had 10 guys waitng to eat and he was coating each fish fillet so that they were perfectly coated. He started rationing the eggs and toast so that we would not run out. Problem was we brought a lot of eggs and bread back with us. One guys caught a real nice pike over 40 inches. Bill insisted that we snap a picture of him holding it so he could show his friends. One thing we learned is that Bill will not go back with us."
