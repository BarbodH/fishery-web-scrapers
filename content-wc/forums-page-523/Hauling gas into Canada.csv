1222955,davenathe,2010-07-27 19:26:00,113,"We have never been nailed for duty bringing 3-4 5 gallon gas cans, cross at Fort Frances."
1222976,muskyman73,2010-07-27 20:26:00,402,"I brought with me 8 - 5 gallon cans with me across in plain sight full of gas across the border. Of course, the border agents were nice enough to give me and the guys in my truck - full cavitiy searches for all of us. They detained us for 2 hours, stepped on my spare trolling motor, broke the prop, and took my dads luggage and did not give it back. We had to call them after we figured out the bag was gone, go back and ask for it back. They never even told us they took the bag. We found out when we were at walmart in fort frances. I am done with that border crossing. They are a bunch of goons in fort frances. I have had too many problems with those brain surgeons working that station. Baudette is the way to go. Thanks for the advise Jared, we took Baudette on the way back, no wait and no issues."
1221551,troutwater,2010-07-22 13:40:00,299,I was just wondering how many of you haul gas across the border. I've been looking at some outpost cabins at a boat in only lake and we'd probably have to take our own gas. I've heard some people take a 55 gallon drum with them and use that. Anyone have any tips? Thanks.
1221560,retire55,2010-07-22 14:20:00,1029,"Looks like a US gallon of gasoline in Canada costs about a US dollar more per US gallon. If it were me, I wouldn't want the extra weight nor the ""bomb"" with me regardless the saving. Just my opinion."
1221571,Mark R,2010-07-22 14:54:00,1538,"A couple things 1: check with your camp about bringing in gas, some do not allow it. 2. Check with Canadain customs about bringing across more then 1 tank of gas. I had to pay duty on an extra 6 gallon tank I had with me. That was several years ago and they told me only one tank per boat. 3. 55 gallon of gas would weigh about 240 LB and it would as bad a a bomb if something bad happened."

1221673,Luvnwalleyes,2010-07-22 20:31:00,14,"We bring gas in every time we go up to Lake of the Woods, but we only have to haul it 60 miles. They never ask us about it and we don't have to pay duty. Saves us $60 each time."
1221684,polaris-pete,2010-07-22 21:54:00,343,"I can see taking a few approved gas cans for a boat but a 55 gallon drum is NOT the container to be hauling around in the back of a vehicle. Gas while we were up in Nipigon was about $1.00 more per gallon, so if your life and other lives that may get hurt in an accident is worth the lousy $55 you would save. Then haul it and take your chances, not me as it just isn't worth the few bucks when you consider the risks involved.As others have said its a bomb waiting to go off and most outfitters will not let you bring your own gas to use in their boats anyway.Kind of like taking your own hambugers in a restaurant and then asking the cook to cook them for you!!!!"
1221779,Obabikon,2010-07-23 08:15:00,2370,"You have to be careful... 55 gallon drums will be looked at as an importation. There's limits on how much you're allowed, and there's PROBABLY legal ramifications for attempting to transport drums of gasoline. (I'm sure a license or permit would be required and the drum would probably need some sort of certification) Don't mess with a drum. If you want that much gas... 11-5 gallon cans is the better way to go."
1221780,Outfitter17,2010-07-23 08:30:00,127,"Troutwater,How would you plan on getting the gas out of a 55 gal. drum? Obabikon is right, go with a bunch of 5 gal tanks."
1221804,davenathe,2010-07-23 09:47:00,113,"A few 5 gallon cans, should not be an issue crossing and like others have said ""camp"" may not allow."
1222780,tv4fish,2010-07-27 10:33:00,2694,"Just to point out -- Actually 55 gallons of gas is about 330 lbs. (6 lbs./gallon) plus the weight of the drum--depends on how far you're hauling it ??? -- but, IMO -- DEFINITELY not worth it."
