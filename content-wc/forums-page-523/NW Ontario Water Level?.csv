1217478,MorganMan,2010-07-09 07:44:00,341,"What have those of you who have been up this year seen as far as water levels on the lakes? Last year we had heard levels were up and surprised to see how far they were up when we got there! I can't imagine they have had as much rain as last year this summer, but you never know. It certainly altered our fishing as we fish both the lake and river system where we go. We fly in about 75 north of Sioux Lookout."
1217507,Jig Man,2010-07-09 08:47:00,95,Additional Question: What is the fire danger situation? Is it Dry? Any Fire Bans?
1217514,tv4fish,2010-07-09 08:56:00,2694,"MorganMan: The water level on Lac Seul as of July 1 was probably close to its ""normal"" level -- definitely lower than last year, but last year was an exception, for sure.Jig Man: No Fire Dangers, not dry and no Fire Bans , to my knowledge (at least, as of last week?)"
1217520,Kruger,2010-07-09 09:01:00,259,Here is a good site for fire infohttp://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business...ge/268862.html
1217521,Obabikon,2010-07-09 09:07:00,2370,"Lots of water on Lake of the Woods. It's definately a little higher than the map. No fire bans in the area, as we've had a TON of rain the past few weeks."
1223595,SkeeterJeff,2010-07-29 20:46:00,31,"Lady Evelyn was down 4' when we were there last week. It was down 7' in May when Garden Island Lodge opened. We were told they didn't get the snow that they normally get, so no runoff to refill the reservior that had been drawn down as normal. Fishing was still good tho, although we didn't do as good as in previous years. -Jeff"
1223603,Catman59,2010-07-29 21:16:00,345,"Sturgeon Lake was about a foot above normal last week , but was rising . Probably came up a foot while we were there."
1223676,jsmyers,2010-07-30 07:20:00,198,"According to Andrea (I think she writes the blog) at Tall Pines on Wabaskang, the lake is high:http://tallpinescamp.wordpress.com/2...-rain-go-away/"
