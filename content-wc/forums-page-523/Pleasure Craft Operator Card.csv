1222819,WalleyeRip,2010-07-27 12:45:00,44,I am confused. Is this required for everyone from the US who goes on a limited time trip to Ontario or someone who spends the entire summer up there at there cabin or at a camp? Who knows the facts? Thanks
1222829,Jay Merics,2010-07-27 13:07:00,21,If your going to have your own boat in Ontario for 45 or more consecutive days you need the card. If your renting a boat from a camp/outfitter all you have to do is sign the boat safety checklist that they go over with you.
1222835,WalleyeRip,2010-07-27 13:45:00,44,Thanks Jay. I got a company trying to sell me a boaters safety book and class with certificate of completion. My two trips a year to Ontarion doesn't qualify for the 45 days.......Thanks Again

We were questioned by the MNR at our camp and no one asked to see our boaters safety card, of which we had 2. They were in with our license so maybe that was it but I doubt it. Pressure may get worse in coming years. You can go to ....http://www.boatus.org/ and do the work and take the test like I did and get your card. So I know a great deal about PFD, PWC and bouys. BFD. Do what you have to do to make it right."

Some fly-in outfitters feel they don't have the time for the pilot to do the safety checklist at the outpost. I don't agree with this but it does happen with some outfitters like the one I went with earlier this year."
