1221650,Fishin Fun,2010-07-22 18:59:00,218,I would say Gull Rock Lake. I've been fishing it for years and have had great success. This year we caught 265 walleyes in a week for the 4 of us. And that was slow compared to last year!
1222991,kgeary,2010-07-27 21:42:00,88,"I've fished over 300 lakes across Canada. There are many great walleye lakes. I haven't fished lake Erie or the Bay of Quinte Ghost River is excellent, So is Lac Suel, The cobham river, the English River system. Gull rock, Red lake. Little Vermilion produces by far the most numbers of walleye But for numbers and size Nungesser has shown me to be the most productive. I was out with Deb and the Kids yesterday and in 2 hours we boated over 200 and went thru 6 dozen worms and 8 dozen minnows. Throw in a couple 24 inchers and 44 inch pike and it makes for a lot of fun. The kids are not ""expert"" anglers and that is not an unusual day. I've had many days with 2-300 fish and many days with a dozen walleye over 26 inches. I've had guests who are real artists with a jig who have caught so many walleye I won't even mention a number. No doubt, Electronics have a huge part in todays walleye catching success. A good sonar unit and the knowledge to go with it can make all the difference."
1220314,Kevin R,2010-07-18 14:21:00,305,"I will tell you very few fish. This lake was loaded with Pike, Walleye & Perch 10 years ago. In the 1970's if you counted Pike caught you would get about 100 per person fishing in August. In 2009 I didn't catch a fish not one, I also did not see a boat the whole time I was in Keynote. This has been on a steady decline something is going on the water was slime green in many areas.Yes catch & release has helped, but it should have been done back in the 1980's. The Pike have been on a steady decline the Walleye fishing is as good or even better today. The water clarity is changing it gets greener & darker each year. I don't think netting is going on today but even whitefish netting allows some other fish to be taken.Run off could be the issue from logging or the develpoment of homes around the lake, some lakes are prone to decline more than others from a change."
1220471,Guest,2010-07-18 22:36:00,0,"I can personally guarantee what I have experienced through 5 weeks a year fishing for the last decade d 3 weeks a year for the first 20 years (thats right...over 30 years and 130 trips) that the pike fishing is better than it has ever been. You have to be versatile and willing to get away from the weedbeds in the summer and fish the reefs or wherever you mark baitfish and you will catch alot of big northern! You also have to be on the water during the right times it means the difference between a few decent fish and several! I have caught or been in the boat with well over 20 or more 40"" pike every year for the last 5 years! They are still there and bigger than ever but they are not as easy to catch as they used to be and that is because of 1) fishing pressure moving them around, 2) several years of higher water levels causing not as great of weed growth, and 3)an implosion of the walleye population which I feel the big northern have plenty of feed to make our baits tougher to catch with now. If the pike fishing was getting worse I wouldnt be there...plain and simple. Keynote isn't dead...its unbelievable how many fish it produces in May/June then in July it turns to a darker color and isn't as good of fishing. I don't even go there in August because the bite is better in the other parts of the lake. I assure you that Keynote is one of if not the best place to be during May and June. I am here now and this week Big Lake is kickin tail! Next week it may not...thats the beauty of Wabaskang...the fish are usually biting somewhere! I dont blow smoke I just tell it like it is...Wabaskang can be very humbling some days but most you can find big fish if you are willing to move around and fish the best times and best spots."
1220557,Kevin R,2010-07-19 08:23:00,305,Agree the weeds hold few large Pike in August compared to 30 years ago. I think more are catching the bigger Pike before I come up so they could be more hook shy. I now 90% of the time fish alone so that could be part of it but think changes are going on. I have not fished Wabby in May or June ever & very little in July I fish daytime in August & September that is what I am comparing I keep thinking about water temps in Keynote or oxgen levels today compared with 30 years ago that could be pushing the fish out by August. So if you think fishing is better now than 40 years ago or the lake holds more Pike now I disagree but I could be wrong changes in the lake may be putting the Pike in areas durring August that differ from 40 years ago. Some areas have slow to no action that were top spots other top spots are still very good. Its great to know the fishing in May & June is still outstanding & getting better from some reports. I have been hearing about how great it is from all that come up at that time from the first time I came.
1220611,Guest,2010-07-19 10:41:00,0,"Kevin you may be correct about the changes to the lake...I have noticed considerably less weeds the last few years but I have been blaming that primarily on the cool May/Junes we have had the last few years combined with the abundance of rainfall and higher lake levels. I don't know if the weeds have had a great chance to grow to their potential the last few years...at least not the lush green cabbage that I like to fish for big northern. Those brown, stringly type of weeds have seemed to replace alot of those green cabbage. Hopefully it will turn itself around again...never know. I am confident that fishing should continue to be strong as ever but I can attest to fishing pressure pushing those big northerns out of the weedbeds. However, when the lake starts to get rough that is when I catch ALOT more big northerns in the same weedbeds that we could not even raise a fish for several days prior. I think they are using deeper water during calm conditions and move back into the weeds when it gets wild. That has been my best success. I wish I could have fished up here 40 years ago with the same equipment I have now...it would have been amazing I am sure! Good luck in Aug/Sept and you will probably see me I fish out of a Red Crestliner with black/white checkerboard and will be up 2 weeks in Aug. How about you? I wouldn't mind meeting you."
1220965,wallydave,2010-07-20 13:07:00,2151,"It seems like we have a tie, between Lac Seul, and Ghost River, plus a few other nominations. Are their any other candidates to be nominated? I move we have more discussion, before we take this to a vote! Do I have a second to this motion?"
1221058,Esox Warrior,2010-07-20 18:01:00,64,"Big Mike, have you noticed any better weed growth this year with the warmer than normal spring up there? I'll be back up there the end of May 2011 and like what you have to say about Keynote that time of year! Would you mind sharing some info when the time gets a little closer?"
1221122,Guest,2010-07-20 22:18:00,0,"Not a problem talking fishing with you anytime, just shoot me a pm at [email protected] and I will be glad to give you the rundown...but I would wait a few days I am fishing now. Also, I haven't noticed alot more weeds because June was really wet and had some cool spells as well. The lake is high right now and I think it slowed the weed growth. Later..."
1221134,Stu,2010-07-21 00:22:00,472,"Hey Big Mike, not to get off topic but I just got back from Wabby. We maked huge schools of fish in the deep water (50 - 60 ft) just off Doe Island. Some of the guys thought they may have been perch, but nobody knew for sure. Any ideas?"
1221177,Kevin R,2010-07-21 07:10:00,305,"The boats & motors today along with electronics are the biggest changes. The tackle back then was not all that different, but fishing styles were most horsed the fish in with little or no drag thus broken lines were common on big fish next to the boat. Few fish over 40"" were caught compared with today when hooked, if a big pike was caught it was kept so it was a good thing they got away. I can only think of one bay in the entire Lake that looked great but held few fish back then. It is strange but even then the best spots had thick cabbage weeds with deep water nearby. That spot had beautiful cabbage weeds but no deep water just a shallow basin that would drop slowly to 20ft then 30ft. Odd as it seams a like place on Perrault lake is a very good spot. Weed grow is a result of light on the lake bottom if it can not reach the grow doesn't happen. A very large area on Perrault lake held what I would call the best of best spots cabbage that went to about 20ft layered with step ledges through out & deep water nearby on both sides it peaked at 8ft in the middle for 50ft x 1000ft the weeds started to go away in the late 1970's & now not even a weed is there that once had been a mass of weeds. back in 1970 you could cast that spot & catch nice pike all day long today it still holds fish but forget about casting & catching all day long just at peak times is it anygood.Stu those could be Walleye I marked many last year very deep but whitefish & other fish lurk in those depths. My recorder I can tell What a Pike Walleye or Bass shows as.I will pm you Mike."
1221503,Esox Warrior,2010-07-22 11:15:00,64,"Thanks Big Mike, I'll be in touch. Good luck fishing!!! Mike"
1219343,stardaddyed,2010-07-15 09:27:00,20,Here is a conversation starter...What is the most productive Walleye lake in Ontario? Productive defined as consistently high number of medium to large fish.
1219364,wallydave,2010-07-15 10:30:00,2151,"This thread should get interesting! I have mostly fished the Ear Fall area of Lac Seul. At times the fishing has been fantastic! One quality fish after another, big handful healthy wally's, and long and slimy pike! Yes their have been slow periods, weather, high/low water can influence the bite. One year we tried a fly-in lake trout lake, nice weather, but we missed the peak laker season. One of the guides, asked where we had fished before, replied to our Lac Seul answer, ""That isn't a lake, it's a fish factory!"" A fishing buddy of mine, has fished both the Ear Falls area, and Ghost River, was leaning towards the Ghost as a better fishery. Different times of year and seasonal variences? I saw a poster once that said, ""A bad day fishing is better than a good day at work."" Any other takers out there!"
1219367,dkrusin,2010-07-15 10:33:00,97,"Lake St Joseph. Was there 6/11 to 6/18. 50+ walleyes per person each day, many 20"" to 25"" largest 28.5"". Many gators 35 to 40, largest 44. After many years at Lac Suel, no comparison as far as fishing, but the best part is very little boat traffic. My last trip to McKensie Bay there were 40 + boats. Not my idea of wilderness fishing, that will never happen at St Joe"
1219406,Larry Mac,2010-07-15 12:26:00,530,"Hi stardaddyed, yes I agree this could be an interesting and fun thread. There is so much water to fish I cannot wait to see all the comments. Based upon your parameters and the lakes that we have fished (which by no means even scratches the surface of the many opportunities Ontario has to offer). The post productive walleye fishery I have ever fished hands down has been Ghost River. We experience consistently high numbers of medium to large fish. The daily numbers of fish can exceed 100 fish per day to 200 fish per day on a good day. Of course this is fishing and I do not want to mislead anyone; that is when the feed bag is ON. IMHO Ghost River is a phenomenal walleye fishery for numbers. Have a great year.Thank Larry Mac"
1219411,jsmyers,2010-07-15 12:35:00,198,"It seems to me that a lake that receives a lot of pressure but maintains a good fishery might be ""more productive"" than a remote lake. It doesn't mean it has the best fishing around, but that it grows fish more productively.For instance, Wabaskang (the only lake I have enough experience with to talk about) is a pretty productive fishery, especially if you are talking about numbers instead of size. But it has a fair amount of fishing pressure compared to a lake further north or farther from the highway, so if 105 had been built 20 miles further east, maybe it would be a better place to fish today than a comparable lake that doesn't now get much pressure."
1219502,wallydave,2010-07-15 17:07:00,2151,"Just to further stir the pot, any one want to break the fishing down by fly-in, drive-in, boat-in. Or would this ""muddy the waters"""
1219517,bob oh,2010-07-15 17:33:00,3936,Lake Erie
1219840,adempsey,2010-07-16 14:38:00,963,"I think many will say Lake Erie, Lake St.Clair and Lake Ontario (Bay of Quinte). To me, that's like saying Ontario or Manitoba since those are large bodies of water. I think looking at only inland lakes would be far more interesting. You could even break it down further by season, quality and quantity (although, you did specify in your OP).A good lake for some might be catching a couple trophy sized 30""+ in a week, while another might say 100 slot size fish per day is extraordinary. Some places you need to troll relatively deep water all day. No matter how good the fishery is, I don't think I would enjoy trolling with down-riggers as much as fishing a smaller lake. So, that wouldn't be a good lake for me.Personally, I haven't experienced any such lakes yet."
1219967,Kevin R,2010-07-17 06:08:00,305,Lake Erie is wow for open water you always can catch fish. The best inland could be lac seul from all reports but I have not fished it. Wabby used to be called a fish factory. Many years of netting & heavy fishing ruining the gene pool along with Keynote going dead has taken a toll on Wabby at one time it had to be the best drive to Pike Fishing lake in Canada in both size & numbers. The water quality has changed over the years as well at one time it was a very clear lake with vast amouts of weeds through out the Lakes something happened over the last ten years that has effected many of these lakes & nobody has any answers!!!!!!!!This same thing has happened to lakes throughout the US the Petenwell flowage is like a giant smelly sewer system loaded with carp. At one time it was a great Walleye Lake along with a strong Pike population.
1220299,jsmyers,2010-07-18 12:44:00,198,"What does Kevin mean by ""Keynote going dead?""The only thing I've every heard of happening in ""these lakes"" is greater adoption of a catch and release, combined with decades of slot regulations. I've also read elsewhere that there hasn't been netting on the lake for over a decade or so, and that was pretty well-targeted for whitefish.The only thing that I could possibly imagine that would have some relationship to some of what Kevin is talking about is logging in the watershed that may facilitate additional sediment flowing downstream."
