Have to idle and reverse steady to fish the windward sides of islands. picked up 21-28"" fish, had keepers every day using pink and white jigs w/ chartruese and white curly's.if your not fishing in the wind your not catching fish.5 guys with the biggest pike 38""Beege"
1222922,fldoc,2010-07-27 17:59:00,47,We were there for the first time 2 years ago in mid-July fishing out of camp lake st joe. (a late spring with water higher so fish not in their typical July August patterns) We found out that it is crucial to fish the wind. We found many good spots up to Little Joe island but did not fish beyond there. We would like to fish beyond little joe this year and wondering if you have any recommended spots. (gps coordinates are great) We did some spoon casting for northerns (areas of cabbage - 5 of diamonds and williams mostly) but no big northerns. Maybe there are some good northern areas beyond little joe. ??? Randy from Duluth
