1223268,slugger doug,2010-07-28 20:56:00,15,Will be going up to Savant Lake and will be meeting some of our group in Thunder Bay. Usually go through International Falls and stay in Fort Francis. Need help on a good motel in Thunder Bay. The full service motels are expensive for just a place to sleep. Any other suggestions? Also any road construction. Last year my trailer got beat up with the road work on 599. Thanks
