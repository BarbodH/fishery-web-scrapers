1223211,SinOrSwim,2010-07-28 17:35:00,1528,"I don't own one on LOTW but I do own a houseboat and have owned several in the past. I can tell you they are a lot of work and maintenance and quite frankly I wouldn't want one that far away. Unless you plan on being there quite often. Granted, I don't use mine for fishing necessarily. Other than my kids and I fishing for blue gills etc off the back. My advice would be to rent one and make sure you are comfortable driving it etc. We have several in our marina that never leave the dock. Owners are not comfortable driving unless it's dead calm. It's not as easy as it sometimes looks. But, imo it comes down to the cost of maintenance. Unless you are using it A LOT you would be better off with a camper or even a hotel. If you have specific questions let me know. I'll try to help."
