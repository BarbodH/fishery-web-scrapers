1216564,172EYES,2010-07-06 18:21:00,22,Hopefully this is a short thread! My buddy and I can't seem to get a straight answer on if it is legal to cross the border with leeches in bedding. He stopped by Vado's Bait today and they said no. I read here: http://www.canadawelcomesyou.net/faq.html that I can bring them unless not in dirt. Anybody know for sure? 10 days and counting.....
1216572,Lenman,2010-07-06 18:49:00,19,"Not leeches, worms. Worms in bedding are okay. No US dirt allowed across."
1216627,Obabikon,2010-07-06 21:44:00,2370,Correct... 100% sure that leeches and minnows are NOT allowed to cross the border. Night crawlers are allowed... as long as they are in the paper bedding (zero dirt and nothing that resembles dirt)

RE : Réservoir Cabonga‏ From: [email protected] Sent: Mon 5/17/10 7:19 PM To: [email protected] Hi Sir, To answer to your question about the bait fish' the answer is yes. You can fish with the bait net and the trap fish, but they must be dead when you fish with them and they also must be dead when you travel with them. Your second question, you can use leaches from the US, it's legal. If you need more answers to your questions, please contact me by E-Mail. Thank you and have a nice day!

1216673,172EYES,2010-07-07 06:15:00,22,I did some additional searching around the net on outfitters' sites and it looks like many of them say there are new regulations that prevent leeches from being brought in. I am leaning towards no.
1216716,Guest,2010-07-07 07:55:00,0,"I think this is a problem of semantics. When someone asks a question about Canada on this site, most people (including me) think in terms of Ontario. The reply stating it is legal to bring leeches is from Quebec, where it may well be legal. You can not bring leeches or minnows across the border in Ontario. Worms in artificial bedding are ok as stated in the other posts."
1217069,Guest,2010-07-07 22:22:00,0,hope this helps for saskatchewan http://www.environment.gov.sk.ca/Def...d-63a614820635 not sure about the details in alberta but i know they can legally import leechs from the u.s. and then distribute from there respective baitshops
1217662,oldmanwalleye,2010-07-09 19:13:00,3,the only province that can get leeches from the states is alberta as i live in sask and sell leeches!!!a few yrs ago ontario put a stop to me selling their.
1223907,38bill,2010-07-30 20:20:00,331,We used to bring leeches into Ontario but that was banned some years ago so we switched to crawlers in bedding. The Ontario bait shops we go to are now carrying leeches and will sell them by the pound. Last week they were going from $38can to $40can a pound. The only problem is that you need to make sure that they will have them in stock when you come through.
