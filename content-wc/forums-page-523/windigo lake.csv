1223479,Guest,2010-07-29 14:18:00,0,I have some friends that fished Windigo some years back.Wide open & wicked when the winds blow but great fishing from what I recall.Walleye & Northern were plentiful.Theres a gravel road north of Pickle that swings in close to Lower Windigo I believe thats where the boat launch is but I'd check in town to be sure.
1223496,IaDave,2010-07-29 15:29:00,476,It is wide open- years back took my boat up and stayed at Albany River outfitters and made the trip up to the Pipestone. I think the lake we passed on the way was Windigo and never put in because of the wind. There is a landing at Pipestone with access to numerous lakes. There is a guy named Lenray that checks in on this site hopefully he can have more info for you. There is another lake further south called Badesha or locals call it Mud Lake. Decent landing there and we fished there for 2 days- excellent fishing.
