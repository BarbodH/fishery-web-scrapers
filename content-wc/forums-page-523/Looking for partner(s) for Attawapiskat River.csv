Dates: August 28 - September 4. I am still waiting for a quote from the outfitter. If anyone feels like going, please contact me. I think that the last week of Summer may be phenomenal. Also, if any of you need a partner for the week of August 28 - Sept. 4 for any good fishing trip to Ontario or Quebec, I may be available if I don't get anyone to join me for the Attawapiskatt River trip. Look forward to hearing from you. John"
