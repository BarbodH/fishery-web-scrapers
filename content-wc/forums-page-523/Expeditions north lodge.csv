1222614,Mich_Fisherman,2010-07-26 19:03:00,292,"Fred,Good talking to you last night. Sounds like you had a great trip for sure full of unexpected excitement with the deer and some great fishing and it all worked out. Perhaps we'll see you next year at camp. We're flying in June 10 and can't wait."
1222715,Seanik,2010-07-27 07:37:00,218,"Hi Mich. Fisherman, We had a great time at Expeditions North Lodge 7/9/10-7/16/10 and are in the process of booking 7/8/11-7/15/11 for next year. This place totally spoiled us and it will be difficult going elsewhere, however I and a friend are thinking about a late Aug. train in trip to Shanengo Lodge. Never been there but I did some research and it seems like a decent place and it's closer to my home. Seanik"
