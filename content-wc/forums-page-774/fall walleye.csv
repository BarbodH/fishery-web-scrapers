545620,Guest,2005-02-07 10:21:00,0,"Dan, if you like to catch big walleye and catch them all day you should consider Rainy River walleye on there way up for the fall run out of Lake of the Woods. The fishing here is awesome, I've been a fishing guide for 16 years and can say without a doubt that Rainy River is the best wlaaye bite I've found anywhere."
545627,Guest,2005-02-07 13:04:00,0,"Late September to October - Pine Falls, Mb. Generally, the bite doesn't turn on until after the water is 55 deg or less. Just exactly when that is going to be is a day by day question. You may need to make reservations now to get a room, they book up."

545646,Guest,2005-02-07 22:07:00,0,The Red river north of Lockport.They usually start running in mid september and only twenty minutes north of Winnipeg.

545658,Guest,2005-02-08 09:07:00,0,"I guide for myself and guests with their own boats. And as for information you can probably pick up any In-Fisherman magazine, usually say something in there about Rainy. checkout www.walleyecup.com and see what kinda weight won the Gander Mtn. Cup in the river. And being a local guide I can get great rates almost anywhere for my guests, I think you save more money by staying at a hotel/motel that way you set your own time and Ilove to fish so I'm also easy on time on the water. I can fish either side of the river but I can tell you I know a lot more spots on the Canadian side."
545668,Guest,2005-02-08 19:10:00,0,Try Morson - only 45 miles from Rainy River. You could fish the river then Lake of the Woods for crappie and walleye.

545791,Guest,2005-02-16 18:30:00,0,"Its only crowded from Long Sault Rapids out to the mouth, hardly anyone fishes the Manitou Rapids. I think people think theres to much rocks at Long Sault."
