545743,Guest,2005-02-13 11:04:00,0,"New Walleye Catch & Possession Limits for the Winnipeg River System in Ontario Including Minaki. Walleye must be between 35-45 cm (13.8-17.7 in.) and not more than one (1) may be greater than 70 cm (27.6) in length. Resident walleye and sauger catch and possession limit of four (4), Conservation licence limit of two (2) Note: Non-resident walleye and sauger catch and possession limit of two (2), Conservation licence limit of one (1). There is a definate problem in Minaki regarding fish harvest. I fish there every open water weekend of the year and last year was a very scary eye opener. When you see people fish all day and have three 12"" walleye in the boat for shore lunch, you know there is a problem."
545756,Redtail5998,2005-02-14 10:28:00,34,Was just wondering if there is any indian netting that goes on in the Minaki area?
545762,Johnny_Canuck,2005-02-14 15:59:00,21,"Some: Leo Heyens, the Kenora west area supervisor for the MNR, said they are still working with the Dalles First Nation to determine the impact of the aboriginal subsistence and commercial fishery on walleye populations. He said everyone may not be satisfied with the amount of the fishery they are allocated, but a fair and sustainable balance between First Nations use and sport angler use is their goal. ""It's a balanced approach to make sure everybody has an opportunity to utilize that resource,"" said Heyens. ""For resort owners to suggest that First Nations shouldn't be utilizing that fishery is probably not a good thing to suggest."" Dalles First Nations Chief Allan Luby praised the proposed new regulations for sport fishing and the MNR for including his community in the process to determine how to maintain a sustainable fishery on the Winnipeg River. ""We need to have a sustainable fishery and all users have to be considered,"" said Luby. ""We need to be involved in the management and we need to be involved in the benefits of the fishery, that's how we look at it."" ""Most of the harvest, when you do the research, is from sport fishing,"" said Luby. ""The commercial and subsistence fishing harvest is very low compared to sport fishing."""
545765,Guest,2005-02-14 18:09:00,0,"As a resident, although the Minaki area is not an area I fish, I would have to agree with whom ever thought the non-resident & resident limits should be the same. If a problem exists then I think all user groups should pitch in and try to overcome the situation. By leaving it as is for some it would seem to suggest (to them at least) that all is well....or perhaps it sends a message that the ""other"" group is at fault. The resource is used by those paying for accomodation at tourist facilities (good for the economy of the community), the local residents (good for them), and apparently the local aboriginal community (part of a way of life...hopefully used responsibly). Somebody once pointed out that when you can't manage the resource you end up managing the people.....throw politics into the mix and you end up with different rules for different people. The bottom line is ...do whats best for the fishery and everyone will benefit. I could be way off...correct me if I am."

545680,Guest,2005-02-09 15:23:00,0,"Cabin fever has set in some. In Tennessee it isn't as bad as it is for you all up there in the north (God's Country), I imagine. It seems that this time of year, our group, which is 11 this year, can not talk enough about our late May/early June trip to Minaki. I had the topo maps out last night talking long distance to my brother in NC. I really miss the times up there in Minaki. We stay at Birch Island Resort. I love smallmouth fishing, especially in Gunn Lake and in the current areas. Of course Big and Little Sand are great. I haven't fished Pistol or Roughrock Lakes much. Perhaps this year. It doesn't hurt to catch muskie and walleye shallow, fishing for smallies. Last year we caught good size walleye. I will have a go at the Crappie again this year. I know that others on this board go to Minaki. I hope the weather is great and we all have an outstanding time on our trips this year to the Winnipeg River and Minaki. Don"
545682,Johnny_Canuck,2005-02-09 17:54:00,21,Please practice catch and release and conserve our valuable resource.
545728,Redtail5998,2005-02-12 16:22:00,34,"We have been going to Minaki for the past 7 years usually twice a year. We fell in love with the area and its fishing. The past two years the fishing has been a little tougher for us,maybe the weather has had something to do with it. Would like to hear from anyone about their luck the past couple years. We still catch more than enough fish to keep coming back, just not quite what it was,"
545729,Guest,2005-02-12 18:29:00,0,"I went to Minaki for the last two years in a party of 12 people. Two years ago we caught a ton of walleyes out of Big and Little Sand. Last year it took us three days to catch 1 walleye over 14""! The weather was nice, so I can't explain why the fishing was so poor."

545734,Guest,2005-02-13 07:20:00,0,"The cool weather last year slowed down the bite. We still caught walleye up to 31.5 inches. Trolled Reef runners in 30-40 feet. The smallmouth were off due to the weather. 2 years ago caught plenty of smallies. In our 2 hr. smallmouth contest between Boat #1 (mine with my partner) and Boat #2 (other ""buddies"" boat) 2 years ago, we totaled about 60 smallmouth combined. On our late May/early June trip last year, there were hundreds of walleye caught below the Dalles by one of our group who targets them primarily with minnow and jig. No great size for him though. Several muskie up to 20 pounds were caught. I had a 50-52 incher to the boat, but my ""buddy"" missed the muskie and netted the lure instead. In hindsight, that was preferably, since it would have just stressed the muskie to be landed with a net. Next time I am going to unhook the muskie in the water at boatside and not land it. I am hoping for a mild spring with slightly more water coming through than normal, Don"
545738,woods,2005-02-13 09:07:00,646,"Our group on nine has been fishing Big Sand for 19 years, and 2002 & 2003 were our best years. Fantastic is a better word. Last year was rough as we had 5 days of bad weather."
545739,Guest,2005-02-13 09:40:00,0,"I have been going to the Minaki area for 30 years. I try to get up to the area 2 or 3 times a year. I love this area and have considered purchasing a cabin many times for retirement. My favorite time of the year is around the first or second week of August. There is much more pressure in this area than there was years ago. The walleye population is definately down. Between locators, gps, underwater cameras, more cabins, and paradise cove expansion the system has suffered. Don't get me wrong I had several days last year on the humps in Big Sand with outstanding sucess. But 20 years ago we could boat up to green island, had to hunt with the locators butonce we found it could easily limit out with 6 each in a couple of hours. Today we boat up with GPS coordinates of all the humps, an alarm goes off to tell us we are in the right place, run accros the hump with the color locator to see if there are fish, if so drop the camera to see if they are walleye. I hope that the new regualtions help this system. I will probably try to only do one trip year for the next several years until the system begins to recover. One comment that I must make, I have no problem with the new slots and limit of 2 walleyes but I have met several locals who have cabins on the lake and they are meat hogs. The residents take far more fish than the nonresidents and the regulations should be the same."
545741,Johnny_Canuck,2005-02-13 10:47:00,21,"""In May, the Ministry of Natural Resources and the Winnipeg River Fisheries Advisory Committee presented the results of a two-year study to improve the state of the Winnipeg River walleye fishery at an open house in Kenora. The study determined that 80 per cent of the walleye harvested by sport fishermen are caught by American sport anglers with Manitobans and locals responsible for the remaining 20 per cent.""http://www.kenoradailyminerandnews.c....php?id=114902http://www.kenoradailyminerandnews.c....php?id=134976"
