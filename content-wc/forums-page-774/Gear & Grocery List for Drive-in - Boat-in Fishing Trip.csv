545583,Ohio fisherman,2005-02-05 17:58:00,989,"Hi Guys: Due to a computer malfunction, I lost my saved documents. Can you please share your list of gear, groceries, and other items for a fishing trip to Canada? I have started a new list, but am getting senile. So far, fishing rod, tackle box, and crown royal. Please feel free to email [email protected] Thanks, O F"
545585,Gary_IA,2005-02-05 19:56:00,144,"Fishing reel with extra spool, Depth Finder with fresh batteries, landing net, fillet knife, leeches and/or worms in bedding, a shore lunch kit-decent plastic or wood box with plates, forks, knives,spoons and spatula and seasonings, portable grate, decent fry pan(s), breading for fish and peanut oil. (If you are going to a boat in resort, the resort may provide the kit. Check with them). I assume you will have sufficient fuel or be close to where you can get more. Duct tape to repair holes in boat, perhaps a spare prop for your motor and wrench to change same. Perhaps a good Leatherman all purpose tool and some wire. Perhaps some Guiness Stout, Jameson's or Courvosier (sp?) I think checking web sites of boat in or fly in resorts may offer a suggested list. If you are going into a boat in resort, see if the outfitter will stock your cabin with groceries. If you are using your own fishing boat to haul gear in, then you will have to be efficient with the space and weight. If the resort has a large camp boat to bring you and your gear, then you can bring a lot more. Fishing license. Good luck, Gary_IA"
545587,Guest,2005-02-05 20:23:00,0,Put a flash light with new and spare batteries on the list. You might consider the headlight type that you strap on your head. Very handy for keeping both hands free. Nimstug

545604,Ohio fisherman,2005-02-06 15:18:00,989,"You guys are great! Thanks for the lists. Some of the lists are like my old list - enough gear for an invasion. I really appreciate all of the tips, especially on the help for a camp boat to haul supplies. We try to pack everything in dry bags or dry boxes. Take care, O F"
545637,Ohio fisherman,2005-02-07 18:27:00,989,"Hi Guys: I have been working on my list and really thank you again for the help. Gary IA: Good ideas, especially on the lodge stocking the grub. I have never found that and would really like that! I relied on my brother ONCE to bring half of the grub. Oh my gosh, it was the nastiest food. He probably did that to prevent ever being delegated that chore again. The ""book"" written by the guy at Slate Falls Outpost is great. It is worth reading just for entertainment. He must be a fun guy. I wonder how many years he has been in the business . . . Nimstug: Thanks for the reminder on the lighting. My wife got me a new headlight for Christmas and it will be added to the list. Bor: Great list, very concise, easy to apply to my trip. Mn Moose: What a list!!!! You and I think alike - list everything individually. The other guys on your trips must love you and not have to do or bring much. It would be great to go on a trip with guys where someone else even makes a list, let alone brings even some of the right gear. Do any of you guys take your own coffee maker? I always take my own either electric or old fashioned depending on the facilities. Can't stand the taste from old stale community coffee makers. Take care, O F"

545736,Guest,2005-02-13 08:48:00,0,I'm not to sure about that candle thing. After a night time dinner of walleye with BEANs and tators and more BEANS it would not be safe to have an open flame in the can...
545654,MN_Moose,2005-02-08 07:31:00,965,O.F. That list was sort of a compilation. Not my regular list. I collect lists when I see thame and sort from there. Figured you were in a pinch so I included more. Yes we take our own coffee maker. Not so much that we don't care for the taste but we need the production capacity. Five guys filling thermos after breakfast tends to crowd the situation. Brings up another thought. we always bring along an electric fan. The Canadian summers do get hot.
545656,Guest,2005-02-08 08:24:00,0,"Mn Moose: You guys have a great system going. Good idea on the fan. There have been many times when one would have been great for the heat and a few rogue mosquitos. take care, O F"
