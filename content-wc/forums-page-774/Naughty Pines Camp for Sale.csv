545696,Trailerguy,2005-02-10 11:25:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]That will be a pretty tough sale, considering the past reputation."

545711,Trailerguy,2005-02-11 06:53:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]The previous owner hit a bunch of the sports shows and gave away ""free"" certificates. The hook was your stay was free but you had to bring 1 or more paying guests, who paid a double price, the camp wasn't well maintained. Then after the fire (camp burned to the ground)the guy would meet the incoming guests, get payed, send them down the road twenty miles to some other accomadations(poor) and disapear with the money. He apparently had a few freinds in Ear Falls who would give him rave reveiws, when asked for a reference."

545748,rebelrn2001,2005-02-13 21:28:00,1563,I remember getting some sort of coupon about 5 years ago. I called and it seemed kind of fishy so I hung up. This sounds just like that situation. Good Riddence.
