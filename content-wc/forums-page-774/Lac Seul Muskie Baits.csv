545769,Guest,2005-02-15 07:20:00,0,Our group is planning on mixing in some Muskie fishing this year with our Walleye fishing on Lac Seul. We will be there the first week of July and would love to hear from anybody on what baits would be best for Musky.

These look like a v shaped wire, two spinner blades and a jig/ hair or plastic tipped body. In the darker water of lac seul the blades make a big commotion and would also work great for big northerns as well. If you were to stumble across an area that held a musky it would be nice to have a surface bait along such as a Bucher Top Raider to drive him nuts. Buy some decent leaders made for big fish and have the release tools you will need close at hand...just remember to only keep a fish out of the water for as long as you can hold your breath."

For the casual musky nut (if there is such a thing), I would say a couple of spinnerbaits (black tail w/orange blades or silver blades), a bucktail (Mepps musky killer), a 9"" or 10"" suick, and a top raider would probably get you through most of what a guy might need. From there, the skies the limit."
