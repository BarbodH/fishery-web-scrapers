545419,Guest,2005-01-28 09:34:00,0,Hi. I thnk thaat is where the new safety rules came from as explained to me by a propane dealer years ago.
545660,Guest,2005-02-08 10:27:00,0,"The 20 pound propane tanks can be filled in Ontario, providing they carry the pressure-testing date stamp, which must be done I think every 5 years or so."
545678,Trailerguy,2005-02-09 12:08:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Older style cylinders here in the states didn't have OPD valves until recent years. Ontario has had OPD valves a while longer. Last summer when I bought fuel at a station in Ear Falls, the station had a sign on their Propane filling pump. It stated it was an ""Offense"" to fill bottles without OPD valves and they refuse to do so."

Most places will only take the new style valve as trade, but some Canadian Tire Gas Bars will take the old style as well. Hope this helps."
