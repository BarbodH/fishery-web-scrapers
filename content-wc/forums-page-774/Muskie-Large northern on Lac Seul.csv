545617,Guest,2005-02-07 07:04:00,0,"Thanks for spreading the secret. Now they will find a way to tax or restrict hot dogs when going over the border. You will soon have to declare alcohol, worms (in bedding), cigarettes, and hot dogs."

I can say I could probably just lower my choices and take a few large spoons and a bulldawg or two and do just as well. I would also want a bucktail or two as well. I always start out thinking I can leave some at home, but end up taking it all- you know- JUST IN CASE."
545496,Guest,2005-02-02 06:40:00,0,"Hey everyone, I have some muskie gear that I bring up to Canada when we go, but we never really find time to actually target Muskie (Big Lake Vermillion). So, I got to thinking - do any of you drag big musky bait to try and target the few musky, or HUGE northern, that Lac Seul can produce? The largest northern we have gotten was 36 inches, and that was caught on a 12 inch walleye we were reeling in. I figure if we drag some of the suicks or big bucktails, we might get that monster northern if anything. Thanks."
545501,Guest,2005-02-02 07:57:00,0,"I have never muskie fished on Lac Seul, but a neighbor cabin two years ago caught three 40"" plus muskie in the McKenzie Bay area. I have heard that there are more muskie in the eastern part of Lac Seul than the western part."
545502,Guest,2005-02-02 08:39:00,0,"We have always done well catching Pike on Lac Seul. There is a good population of 35"" plus Pike but we have only caught 4 pike over 40"" in the last ten years ( 8 of us fishing 1 week a year,June). We have never caught a Musky but how many people have?"
545504,Guest,2005-02-02 09:42:00,0,"Thanks for the replies guys. What I am looking for is, what people use to target the BIG BOYS. As you all are aware, when you get on the walleye, its not too difficult to catch your supper. So, when you have your limits, or have released your fill for the day, what would you suggest using to target the big boys? I catch a ton of northern on just crank baits, but they're just the under or in the slotters....looking to hit the big ones this year."
545515,Guest,2005-02-02 14:14:00,0,Hotdogs and a bobber in small bays try it you might be suprised
545517,Guest,2005-02-02 16:33:00,0,Hotdogs surprised I'd be flabbergasted. Do you mean hotdogs like the kind you eat?
545518,Guest,2005-02-02 19:14:00,0,I have been trying to talk my friends into going to Lac Seul Outposts & Ojibway Outfitters that is in the East part of the lake. Their web-site and talks about muskie and there are some real nice photo's on the site of musky and large northern.

545531,Guest,2005-02-03 12:19:00,0,"Im not kidding,yes the kind u eat,Rig it like you would a worm and fish it that way or catfish it with a bobber it can be alot of fun,find a smaller or shallow bay try it what are you out a dollar.But other than that I catch a ton on big bass spinner baits"
