545725,Guest,2005-02-12 06:03:00,0,"Todd-I would highly recommend Holinshead Lake, located 2hrs north of Thunder Bay. I have been going there for the past 14 years. This is a lake that you don't have to travel 20 miles to catch walleyes. They are within a minute of leaving the dock. On an average day you can expect 100-200 fish days with the average being 16-22"". We do see 3-4 each week over 28"". The website is www.holinshead.ca. I'd be happy to help you out in any way with maps gps pts. etc."
545727,Guest,2005-02-12 09:01:00,0,Todd If you are interested in a boat in camp with the feel of a outpost try www.winelakecamp.com.

545801,Guest,2005-02-17 11:10:00,0,You could try www.Ontariossunsetcountry.ca . They list about 350 NW Ontario resorts.
545802,Guest,2005-02-17 13:22:00,0,"might want to consider evergreen lodge in ear falls. nice cabins, great boats and great fishing on lac seul. you'll take a lot of that $1500 back home with you. no meals at camp, but a diner about 5 minutes away with good grub. reserve early, they fill up fast these days."
545698,Guest,2005-02-10 12:58:00,0,Six of us are looking for a trip this summer. We will consider either a Resort or an Outpost or a Fly in. Would like it to be in Ontario or Manitoba. We would prefer to find a place that we can catch good numbers of Walleye with a reasonable chance of catching some nice heavy fish. Top of our budget is $1500 per person. We would like to fish for a week. Thanks in advance for any suggestions that you can provide. Todd
545699,Guest,2005-02-10 13:19:00,0,Check this one out. it has been great for our group the last 6 years.www.lacseuloutposts.com
545700,Guest,2005-02-10 14:14:00,0,"Go to Lac Seul. Incredible fishing all year. If you have a $1500 budget, go to Silver Wheel Lodge. You get all of your food, plus a guide in the boat every day for that amount. Good choice for your first trip to Lac Seul. If you want to spend a little less, Fisherman's Cove and Lac Seul Outposts are great. I have never been to Lac Seul Outposts, but talked to a few guys at this years fishing shows and they had nothing but good reviews. Been to Fisherman's Cove it is about as clean a camp as you will find. Fisheman's Cove and SWW are in the central part of Lac Seul, and you may see each others boats occasionally. Lac Seul Outposts is on the far far east side on the lake."
545701,Guest,2005-02-10 15:56:00,0,"If you want a fly-in check out Chimo outposts in Red lake Ontario.Very reasonable prices and a lake all to your self. Been there with them about 8 times. Good walleye fishing in all the lakes and a fantastic time every time we go. Punch in Chimo Lodge, Red Lake and you should find it."
545705,Larry S,2005-02-10 20:48:00,666,"Check out www.northernoutposts.com .Been going here for 3 yrs,the other guys I go with have been at these outposts 5 yrs. Excellent walleye fishing and lots,I mean 100's if you fish all day also nice size. with large pike, you fly out of Armstrong. Ryan Brady who runs them has access to lakes 150 to 180 miles north. This year he is opening 2 brand new lakes,1 has never had a camp on it. The price is about $1000 per person. We are going June 18th to 25th to the brand new lake Larry S"
545706,Guest,2005-02-10 21:42:00,0,"Have you considered fishing the Nothwest part of Ontario? My group has been fishing out of Happy Landing Lodge for the past 4 years, and had great fishing. The sevice is wonderful as well, they won't let u do a thing other than enjoy your trip."
545707,Guest,2005-02-10 21:43:00,0,"If you want to check their website is www.happylandingfishing.com It's a good resort if you are looking for good action, good size, and a nice cabin, you can't beat it."
545710,Guest,2005-02-11 06:06:00,0,"go to www.matticelake.com I don't think you can find a better outfitter in Ontario. Booking this late in the year you will most likely be looking at late July or August to get in. If you find a place with openings in June at this time of the year, my advice would be don't go. Good outfitters run 75-90% return customers, this makes it tough to ""break the rotation"". Once you get find an outfitter you like, keep booking with them and eventually you will be able to get a week in June."
545712,Guest,2005-02-11 06:54:00,0,"Hey Guys, Thanks for all the help. Our group is getting together this Saturday and we are going to review all of your suggestions and hopefully book a trip. Thanks again for all the help. Todd"
