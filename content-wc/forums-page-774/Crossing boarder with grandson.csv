545652,Gary_IA,2005-02-08 06:27:00,144,"I suggest a written authorization to travel to and from Canada with you and written authority to obtain emergency health care that is signed by both parents before a Notary, a certified copy of a birth certificate and a photo identification (he might have one for school or his parents or guardians could take him to the state driver's license bureau and get a photo id) In lieu of the birth certificate a passport would contain a photo and is the best identification. You might search the archives on this board about traveling to Canada with a minor, or children and Canada"
545653,DaveIN,2005-02-08 06:48:00,191,Previous post is right on. I took my grandson with me last summer. They questioned him quite abit. He was 12 and it helped that I had prepared him for the questions so that he knew what was coming.
545665,Guest,2005-02-08 17:03:00,0,"Everything above is correct, but the rule is the signed letter from the parents needs to noterized by a notary public (signed by them and then stamped). I do this when I take my small children with me into Canada as the wife stays home. The border guards really appreicate this. Its the first thing I give them after my introductions as to who is in the vehicle, where are going and for how long. Have a great trip. I go to the great white with my father and my kids and there is nothing better than time spent in God's country and family...IA Walleye"

My wife typed a note giving me permission to cross with either of our kids at anytime with no experation date. It is notarized, signed and stamped. In the same envelope, I keep a certified copy of each of their birth certificates. On our trip to Winnipeg, we were advised that we will need a photo ID for 2005. I haven't figured this one out yet as they do not issue them at their school. I am checking to see what the minimum age is for a Minnesota photo ID. Just returned from Winnipeg. They are now requiring proof of US citizenship for US adults to enter Canada as well. Drivers license is no longer enough. A photo ID plus a certified birth certificate is minimum. They suggested that if you have a passport, bring it. I crossed eight times in 2004 and this was never mentioned. Have Fun!"
