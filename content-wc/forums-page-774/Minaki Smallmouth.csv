I have been going there walleye fishing for many years now and have had great Walleye fishing but never targeted smallmouths. We go in mid to late June every year. Would any of you mind sharing a fews smallmouth tips for up there? It would be a fun break to try for them on occasion. Thanks to all who respond. Chad

Any boulder area with some deep water nearby usually is best. Try both Duck Bay's shoals. What also works well is #11 rapala minnows, silver with black or blue backs. You might want to crush the barbs to make unhooking easier, and decrease fish injury. Also the rapids have smallmouth in them. Goodluck, Don"

I can't remember the name, but the smallmouth in there was great last year. The lake was at least 5 to 10 degrees warmer than the main lake. Find the weed edge and work tubes. We cast into the weeds and pulled it out and got strikes. We were in about 8 to 10 feet of water. When lazy, we also anchored and put a slip bobber with a leech at the weed edge and did well. As you are going into the small lake, to your right about 25 yards (or is that meters in Canada) there are a few boulders sticking out that are surrounded by weeds. hit that area with tubes or slip bobber with leech. We worked that side to the right most and did well. If the smallmouth stopped biting, throw a white bass-style spinner to shore and bring it back through the weeds and the northern are there. I had a follow from a musky on the last day of the trip that was so big it scared me. It was way over 50. The biggest musky i saw in person was a 44 and this made that seem small. It took two swipes at my figure eight, and then just sat there and taunted me. Second good spot was in Little Sand Lake, just before you get to the channel that goes to Roughrock, there are these small islands to the east that have these big shelves of rock sliding into the water. Our guide told us to fish these for walleye, but we only caught smallmouth there. There were a few of these islands."
