The lodge number and winter numbers are both disconnected. If anyone has any information it would be greatly appreciated. We need to reserve a cabin. As a new member, here is a brief profile of our Canada experiences and we are now looking for suggestions based on our likes and dislikes for somewhere new in Canada to go fishing. 53 years ago began fishing Wabasgang Lake for nearly a decade until the fishing began to decline and the population of people and boats increased. We used to camp on an island and our last year there we were greeted by a newly built cabin on OUR island. Explored 599 when it was merely a logging road. Came upon Fitchie Lake and fished that a few years, then found Lake Hamilton, just N. of Fitchie and fished that lake until the last few years. Access was eliminated when locals built a cabin and posted a warning sign not to camp. The camp was not official and the locals evidently have authority to restrict access to the lake. Then stayed at N. Albany Lodge and fished Pashkokogan (sp). We are not thrilled by the cabin experience nor the size of Pashkokogan, but running out of options we would fish there again. If there are any out there that have suggestions for places to fish where you might go most of the day without seeing another boat or atleast no more than a couple of boats and on a lake that is not so huge that winds create no fishing days, I would enjoy reading suggestions."

545556,lucky,2005-02-04 15:13:00,3,"LTF ~ Thanks for the web site address. You'll notice that the winter number provided on the site is different than the one you provided. For some reason, after googling every which way but loose, we were not able to find their web site. We have now made contact with them."
545557,Guest,2005-02-04 15:19:00,0,When are you thinking of going?
545715,lucky,2005-02-11 08:44:00,3,"LTF ~ We are thinking of late July. I've left a message, but have not heard back yet from the owners. The lodge up the road a piece, Austin's Wilderness Lodge has no availability. So we're hoping to hear from Albany. Unfortunately after the access to Hamilton Lake, just to the south of Pashkokogan, was eliminated, we sold our camper or we would go north of Pickle to camp. We have fished Badesdawa (Mud Lake) and there are three other options up there."
545720,Guest,2005-02-11 10:20:00,0,That time of the year Medcalf has very good walleye fishing. Not many northern though. There are lots of spots to fish if it's windy.
