Have used it for years in the Detroit river system, has great sensitivity, instant hooksets, high visibility (yellow) and easier on the rod guides than fireline. Use 10/2 and have taken fish up to 45 inch musky with no issues. Last spring tournament partner took a 100 lb class sturgeon on the same line. Use the PP for your trolling rods."
545771,Guest,2005-02-15 07:37:00,0,"I am looking to purchase some line for this years trip to Canada. We mainly jig and troll for walleyes. What type of line would you suggest? I currently use 12lb. Rapala brand mono. I was thinking about purchasing Power Pro 20lb test (6lb diameter). 20lb. is plenty strong enough for the lunker walleye and large northern, yet small enough in diameter to get enough on a standard rod/reel combo. Please let me know what you think. Thanks!"
545772,Mike Kansas,2005-02-15 08:32:00,1463,I started with Power Pro 3 years ago and have had great success with it. I use 10lb for jigging and 15 lb for dragging crankbaits. I think you have a little better sensitivity with the 10lb for jigging. I had tried Fireline before but I like the Power Pro the best. But either of these lines are excellent choice.
545773,Guest,2005-02-15 08:40:00,0,Thanks for the reply. Do you think the 20lb PP would be overkill? I was thinking about going stronger (20lb) because its diameter was still smaller than my normal 12lb mono....
545774,Mike Kansas,2005-02-15 09:07:00,1463,"We have caught and landed several 10 lb plus walleye on 10lb Power Pro and it is fine. We also caught a 39"" Pike last year while dragging a crank for Walleye and the line holds up fine. If I was fishing in clearer water than we have in Lac Seul I would go even lighter in both applications. Jigging sensitivity increases the lighter line you use. Also while jigging with Power Pro I have a looser drag setting because of the no-strech Power Pro. This gives an advantage to you if you hook up on a nice fish because the looser drag lets the rod do its work and puts less stress on the line. You need to learn to tie a Palomar Knot with Power Pro. It assures you of no failure and is of course a 100% knot."
545775,Guest,2005-02-15 09:12:00,0,"Thanks again, maybe I'll get the 15lb instead, afterall, we did hook onto some nice walleye and a 36inch pike with 12lb. mono, and we did fine. I use 80lb test PP for my muskie rod and use the Polomar knot, so I will be doing the same thing with my walleye gear. Thanks again, I appreciate it!"
545776,Mike Kansas,2005-02-15 09:16:00,1463,Good Luck. What lake do you fish on?
545777,Guest,2005-02-15 09:26:00,0,"We stay at a campsite in between Hudson and Sioux Lookout. We launch about 4 miles east of Hudson and get out as far into Lac Seul as possible (well, as far as a 25hp and 14ft. boat can get us!). Usually we fish near the Webster bridge and anywhere in between. With last years water level up, we had to try all new tactics which led us to parts of the lake to the east. We were in some areas by some eddys (awesome!!) and where the forest fires went through in 03....all the map/navigational names slip my mind right now."
545780,Guest,2005-02-15 15:38:00,0,"10lb. line is plenty for jigging, be it 10 lb. PP, basic mono, whatever. I use 8lb. myself and have found it fine. I have landed plenty of 40""+ pike on 8lb, and it holds, so I'm confident it can handle any walleye. I have been up and down experimenting, but for typical walleye rigging and bottom bouncing I have become happy with 14lb., although many of my friends prefer the 17lb."
545784,Guest,2005-02-16 11:49:00,0,"I have used Power Pro on my baitcasting reels. I use the 30 pound test when bottom bouncing, so if I snag, I only lose the spinner rig, and not any line or the weight. I never put superline on spinning reels because of line twist. I tried it years ago but found too many problems. When you guys are saying you jig with Power Pro, do you use spinning or baitcasting reels? Does Power Pro work well with spinning reels?"
545785,Guest,2005-02-16 12:33:00,0,I have used PP on spinning for several years. It works great and I have not had any twisting problems.
