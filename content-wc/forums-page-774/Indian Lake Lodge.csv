545747,Guest,2005-02-13 18:05:00,0,"Vant, Is that Indian Lake Lodge on the Indian Chain of Lakes north of Vermilion Bay? I have been fishing the Indian Chain for a number of years. We stay at Clark's Camp or KC's Landing. This last year we had some tuff fishing, but most years we get plenty of action. There are no northerns, but there is good muskie fishing. We always catch a couple while walleye fishing. The biggest one was just over 40"" a couple of years ago. Last year my buddy did catch an eye over 30"". I don't know anything about Indian Lake Lodge, but we like Clark's Camp. I am sure you can find their web site if you do a search for url's with clarkscamp in it. Enjoy your trip and good luck, Fritz"

545759,Guest,2005-02-14 11:51:00,0,"we did our family outing there in 2001 nad 2002.karen and kevin were great hosts and run a very nice camp.the chain is pretty easy to navigate and the lakes, i think are 9, offer sveral different opportunities to fish stained,clear,deep and shallow depending on which one is going and for what species.we fished mostly for musky in the morning and did mid-morning to early evening jaunts for walleye with some pretty good catches.my wife cuaght a 28 incher in cobble lake which seemed to be the best lake for us both years but i know things change from year to year. the ONLY reason we quit going there is because some freinds of ours bought a resort near ear falls.make sure kevin gives you the grand tour of the chain!"
545764,Guest,2005-02-14 17:28:00,0,"Vant, The road is usually in decent shape. There have been some pot holes over the years, but nothing worse then you see in Wisconsin this time of year. We have always taken our own boats. I am not sure what kind of landing there is on Indian, but the one on Edward (the lake with Clark's Camp & KC's Landing) is a beach type landing. It is not the greatest but we have not had a problem. (I have a roller trailer.) As far as the route up there, we try 502 every couple of years, enjoy the scenery, but take 71 thru Sioux Narrows most of the time. The wider and straighter road is appreciated along with a couple of waysides. Fritz"
