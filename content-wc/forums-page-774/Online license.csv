Residents can get their license instantly online while awaiting for the physical plastic card to show up.
545708,Guest,2005-02-10 23:48:00,0,Hi. In ilinois we fill out the application on our computer connected to dnr website. after that is finished we print out the license on our printer that becomes our official license once we sign it. In fact it is very convenient because we can print a couple so we can leave one in the boat and have one to carry just in case. Payment is by credit card and only takes a couple of minutes.

Since our fishing and hunting licenses go on the same card, ours are a bit more complicated. You need the physical card and then affix your fishing/hunting tags."
