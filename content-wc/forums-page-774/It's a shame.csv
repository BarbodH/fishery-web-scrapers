We were a couple3 hundred miles (roughly north) of Red Lake, ON - and the stuff I saw made me want to cry. I just can not believe what some of the natives do to their own land...........unbelievable...."
545402,Guest,2005-01-27 08:00:00,0,"they don't care because it was given to them for free, you never respect anythnig you get for free."
545719,Guest,2005-02-11 10:09:00,0,What can be given to you when it was already yours?
545721,Guest,2005-02-11 12:36:00,0,"Nasty stuff, for sure. Glad they caught him. Not to cause a stir here, but doesn't Canada ship a lot of it's garbage to Michigan to be put into landfills? Just asking, now I'll duck. BFG"
545723,Trailerguy,2005-02-11 15:29:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Well, I know there are a number of landfills (garbage dumps) along Hwy. 502 and also hwy. 105. I am a member of one that is south of Perrault Falls. They have annual dues and a ""clean up day"" for members. Many camps in the area as well as summer and full time residents are members. If you're in the area and want some garbage to haul to Michigan, no one will mind. ;) ;)"
545761,Guest,2005-02-14 14:09:00,0,"I have camped at this spot a half dozen times since 1989 and my inlaws have been there for over 20 years (neither of us the last 3 tho). It doesnt suprise me in the least, there were times where their were parties going on complete with a home stereo hooked up to a generator. We quit going as this area (just a grassy opening near where you unloaded boats), got too busy and wasnt worth the drive up. Sad too see this, something like that should get them barred from reapplying for a fishing/camping permit in Ontario for life. Xplorer"
545263,Guest,2005-01-21 08:17:00,0,"It is a terrible shame that the irresponsible actions of some people could potentially impact the impression people have of non-residents using their resources. I personally have seen and cleaned up a lot of mess left by people in the outdoors. I would honestly say that just from the labeling on the garbage left that I have seen, that both residents and non-residents are pretty much equally responsible. It is hard for me to comprehend what goes on in the minds of people guilty of this kind of behaviour....http://www.fishingthunderbay.com/cgi...um=DCForumID16"
545264,Guest,2005-01-21 08:55:00,0,To some of us garbage is the essence of life. Those people who did that should be banned from Canada. If they were on my route it would still be in their yard after I left. I might even make the stack bigger.
545267,Guest,2005-01-21 09:29:00,0,"when i see a scene like that, i wonder what kind of person could possibly do that? evil? retarded? angry about a bad trip? drunk? i had a tenant once that lived like that. come to think of it, his name was baker too. here's a 67 year old man camping with his family. he has set this example for his kids and grandkids. amazing what you'll find when you wander off into the shallow end of the gene pool."
545268,Trailerguy,2005-01-21 10:19:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Unfortunatly there are slobs everywhere, resident and non. Perhaps visitors feel safe, in that they think when they leave no-one will know who they are. But I've seen some locals do the same thing. I'm just glad the long arm of the law found this guy, too bad they don't catch more offenders."
545274,fourize,2005-01-21 15:37:00,287,"There's two kinds of people I can't stand...a theif and a slob-litterbug. I'm glad that they caught the guy, but the fine wasn't big enough. I work at a state park here in Delaware and you wouldn't believe some of the crap that people dump on our tracts of land. It's sickening."
545287,Guest,2005-01-22 08:33:00,0,"It is shamefull that this slob is from my home state. I would like to appolagize to everyone in Canada for this idiots actions. The fine should have been $5,000 for this jerk!!!!!!"
545293,Guest,2005-01-22 12:51:00,0,They should give this guy's address then everyone in Rhinelander could go by his house and make a deposit in his yard.
545301,rebelrn2001,2005-01-22 23:41:00,1563,"If you go to GOOGLE, you will find the guy and his address. It took me: .6 seconds. Not that I'm suggesting anything."
545343,Guest,2005-01-24 07:45:00,0,"The newspaper article said this fellow was 67 years old, does that mean he has been leaving his campsites like this for 40+ years? He must be the creator of the NO Camping On Crown Land Rule. Wonder what he threw into the lake? With a atitude like that he probably didn't respect the fishing regulation either. What a loser."
545383,Guest,2005-01-25 22:29:00,0,"I like the look on the CO's Face. ""Looks like i gotta clean this up!"" Still this guy that left the mess sets a poor example. i like what another said. his punishment should be him cleaning campsites for awhile."
