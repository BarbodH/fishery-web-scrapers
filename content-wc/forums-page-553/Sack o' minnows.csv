1158595,Moondog,2010-01-07 14:47:00,362,"Bought 2 pkgs of 100 last year and still have 180 of them. Tried repeatedly, using different presentations, locations etc. and only had a rare bite and no fish. Gulp and live bait worked much better. I agree, the people at the company were great......the product no so great."
1158954,lunker99,2010-01-08 21:58:00,236,"Tried them once, I must have gotten a bad bag. The ones I got were pretty soft and kept falling apart. Could catch fish on them, though if I could keep them on the hook."
1159033,Moondog,2010-01-09 09:27:00,362,"The first, and only, bag we used.......the minnows were hard and dessicated. Not soft at all. Would stay on the hook just fine but no action. I found that dead minnows in our bucket worked better than these things. Not trying to be hard on the folks from Magic Bait because I really like most of their other products."
1159056,camp chef,2010-01-09 10:42:00,915,Maybe we just got a good batch.(picked them up at the magic products office) or we found a bunch of really hungry walleyes last spring. I have try them again ......I'll let you know in the spring if we had the same results
1158340,camp chef,2010-01-06 15:21:00,915,"I just thought I would share a product we found last year that worked like crazy. Magic Products, the same people that make the worm bedding offer preserved bait in sealed packages.It requires no refrigeration and stays on the hook way better than live bait.Easy to throw into your duffel or tackle box. We used the large shiners and paid around $10 for a pound. We averaged 3 to 4 walleyes per minnow before it came off. They have a website and were very pleasant to deal with. No more live bait for us. Just thought I would let you know. I am in no way affiliated with the company."
1158410,prov1900,2010-01-06 19:58:00,544,"I've been wanting to do this as well, as a backup plan. How many shiners come in a pound package?"
1158461,deputy dog,2010-01-07 06:16:00,305,can they be transported into canada?
1158540,Babamel2,2010-01-07 11:01:00,414,"Do you have more information as to the company name, a website or where one can buy them."
1158546,prov1900,2010-01-07 11:22:00,544,"http://www.magicproducts.com/preservedbaits.htm I assume this is it. I don't see the pound quantities, however."
1158558,Steve of Madison,2010-01-07 12:00:00,230,"I use thier products all the time, excellent products excellent service."
1158560,ohiojmj,2010-01-07 12:10:00,1262,"I know you can't use live minnows in Quebec, but not sure about border crossing. i doubt that would be an issue like worms and the dreaded diseases in our USA dirt."
1158579,camp chef,2010-01-07 13:19:00,915,these an be transported and fished with in all provinces
1158580,camp chef,2010-01-07 13:21:00,915,Also to answer the other questions.....there is approx. 100 minnows in a lb of large...The bulk 1 lb. packs are at the bottom ot the web page on brown bear preserved bait I believe. I have kept them unopened for up to 6 months
1158582,fishing frenzy,2010-01-07 13:26:00,71,"I've used the minnows before and wasn't impressed, I'll stick to Gulp."
