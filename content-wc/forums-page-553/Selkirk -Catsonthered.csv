Super trip, we did not get Super Large Greenbacks, but for my Grandson it was a Great Trip! He caught a nice 28"" Greenback, and really got a bang out of using the vexilar to catch fish. Stu was a Great Host! I would highly recommend his services. Photo is of Lane and his first day Greenback.. Steve"
