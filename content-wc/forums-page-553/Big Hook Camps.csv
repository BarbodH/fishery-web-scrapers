1154892,IRISHATTACK,2009-12-18 07:47:00,44,Anyone bighookcamps this past year. I have read some horror stories about Cocos Lake. Any info would be great.

1155075,IRISHATTACK,2009-12-19 06:52:00,44,Motors all junked up and mainly bad service on flights. Now I know flights in and out are weather related. I am going to Anglers Kingdom in June but always looking for a good fly in with BIG pike. This will be my first time to the RED LAKE area. When you hear something bad I always give the benefit of dought to the owners. But you still have to ask.....
1155598,Jig Man,2009-12-22 11:48:00,95,Fished Cocos about 8 years ago and would love to hear the horror stories regarding Cocos lake. I can only guess that low water levels made for interesting navigation to the east section. I did notice that on thier web blog there were not a lot of updates for Cocos so it would not surprise me if you could not make it over to the east (where we had our best fishing).

1159915,Guest,2010-01-13 09:26:00,0,"lobo 1, Are you speaking from personel experience ? We have stayed at Way North Lodge which fish the same chain of lakes,Favourable,North & South Trout etc. Never had any problems with the locals but you are more isolated at the outpost,I guess it could happen but then again that could happen anywhere.The fishing sure is great on Favourable Lake."
1159942,lobo1,2010-01-13 11:34:00,734,"yes, i am referring to personal experience. and yes the fishing is good on Favourable - but could be better minus the negative element i just mentioned."
