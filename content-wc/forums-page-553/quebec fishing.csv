Walleye and pike will be our main focus but we would love to catch some brookies. Anyone familiar with this lake? Any advice? Thanks, Jim D"
541739,Guest,2004-07-16 08:09:00,0,I was thinking of going there as well. I'd like to hear your report on the size of the brookies and if the pike can be caught casting in the shallows and the numbers of walleyes available. Good luck there.
