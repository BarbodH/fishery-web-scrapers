1160352,BELKER 1,2010-01-15 07:32:00,16,booked a trip to lac suel for the middle of july and was wanting to know if the mayflies will be hatched by then?
1160359,ILScott,2010-01-15 07:50:00,139,I believe the mayfly hatch depends on the weather. In 2006 I fished a mayfly hatch and it was the best fishing I had. Walleye everywhere. In 2008 up there the same time and no hatch because it was colder. Just adjust your fishing. I fish close to Lac Suel
1160370,Mike Kansas,2010-01-15 08:27:00,1463,"I think you can have Mayflies anytime from the last week of June through the end of July on Lac Seul. it simply depends on the weather. We have fished Lac Seul for 24 years and have been there during Mayflie Hatch. have always caught fish during the hatch and have had some days during the hatch that have been awesome. I think the Walleye population is so good on Lac Seul that there are times the hatch gets them so fired up that the feeding frenzy includes smacking a jig. I like to fish a very small jig 1/8oz with a inch of crawler on it during the hatch. Had one year that we caught Walleye on a fly rod with a dryfly presentation that was mayfly like. What fun. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1160371,Steve of Madison,2010-01-15 08:32:00,230,"Correct.......the mayfly hatch is not something that shuts down the fishing, and on LS the hatch happens over a 2-3 week period. It can happen in the main lake areas one day and the back waters a couple of days later and work it's way up or down the lake depending on conditions. But DO NOT fear it, it will not destroy your week. I usually go up early to mid July. I hit or miss the hatch every year. Some guys will fish right in the middle of the floating cloud, some will avoid it like a dose of the clap. One of the most incredible sights I have seen was 2 years ago, I cruised into one of my favorite spots only to find it covered with a new hatch. The lake was dead calm and only the small circles from emerging flies made a mark on the surface. After shutting down the engine and sitting there watching for about 2-3 minutes the feasting began. Walleyes every where around us slurping up the flies on the surface, fins and tails everywhere. I knew there were fish, (it was my honey hole), but the sight of hundreds of walleyes feasting on these flies was worth the frustration of not getting them on my line. If I threw out a jig, stick bait etc. the feasting ended, if I stopped it started over again. I sat there with my mouth open watching in amazement for over an hour."
