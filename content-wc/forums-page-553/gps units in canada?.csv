1160676,ferriswheel,2010-01-16 09:44:00,29,Do your research before buying a unit. Don't worry about the unit as much as the available maps for the lake you are to fish. Unlike the states we are not spoiled with a lot of detailed electronic charts. I began making my own maps for this reason. It is time consuming but the final product will be worth it in the spring.
1161597,adempsey,2010-01-19 22:00:00,963,"Ferriswheel is right on the money. I own a Garmin Legend HCX for fishing here in Ontario. There are a few map sets that I know of that you can purchase. Two are from Garmin - Great Lakes (Bluecharts) and the Inland Lakes (Ontario). Not sure if they make a Quebec Inland Lakes set. The other is from TRAK maps which covers inland lakes in Ontario and Quebec. I own the Bluecharts and the TRAK maps set. Covers most of the lakes I go to, but not all. The Garmin Inland lakes set has some I don't have as well.So, no single set is complete and many lakes lack details. There may be more companies that offer maps for the Garmin, I just don't know at the moment.Navionics makes the HotMaps lake maps for Ontario for the Lowrance units and other brands [but not Garmin]. Personally I like the Navionics maps better - more detail and they look to have better coverage. However, I don't know off hand if Lowrance makes a handheld GPS that accepts the SD cards. You can put the Navionics maps on a iPhone as well. There was a time the maps were only $5 when the software first came out for the iPhone!! Too bad I didn't have an iPhone.Long story short. Look at the maps available. That's what is going to make the difference."
1159456,duffitdad,2010-01-11 13:17:00,21,Hello - anyone ever used the hand held gps units when fishing in quebec or canada to help navigate. My friends have them for hunting big woods in maine and love them but I am wondering if anyone has used them on larger lakes in canada to get around and back to camp! -
1159459,prov1900,2010-01-11 13:26:00,544,"Definately!! If your GPS accepts a mapping chip, that just makes them that much easier...than reading a paper map while buzzing down the lake."
1159465,McQ,2010-01-11 14:12:00,615,I have an older Lowrance (pre-chip) model that I use extensively fishing northern Quebec. The underlying base map is adequate for general direction and I have paper maps for navigating while on the water. I'm always in a camp boat and am quite comfortable on even the most remote trips.

1159498,Bluff,2010-01-11 16:25:00,152,I use mine all the time on all water I fish but it certainly lends a sense of security on big and/or unfamiliar water. If you are on water where a specific lake map is not available I would invest in the topo software so at least you have the boundry of the lake visible. It also makes it easier to coordinate with a paper map.
1159504,NYBowHunter,2010-01-11 16:38:00,35,"Absolutely use'm! I usually have two - handheld and fishfinder/GPS. Garmin has Canadian mapping software that also shows water depth and displays hazards such as rocks, sandbars, etc. Comes in real handy when the fog rolls in!"
1159524,brn2fsh,2010-01-11 18:15:00,49,A camp on Wabigoon lake (Indian Point Camp) rented them for 25.00 a week. I didn't need one as I have a gps on the boat. They said it really helped the boaters not to mention that a lot of the hazzards were marked. Rob
1159568,Pooch,2010-01-11 20:31:00,4619,"I have an old Garmin GPS II+ that I have used for a very long time in Canada. We fish remote lakes so charts are not really available. I use it to lay out a track from camp to where ever we are going to fish that day. (Many days we run 10-20 miles) I also use it to mark ""spots"" and any hazards. It is not nearly as pin-point as the newer units, but has gotten us back to our beds safely many, many nights.I'm currently looking for a better handheld unit also. I would like to have a unit without base maps and the ability to zoom in a little closer than my old unit. Not a lot of bells and whistles, if you know what I mean.I highly recommend one for the larger lakes. Being good at maps is of little value when you get fogged in or out! In low light situations the islands all look alike and blend into the shoreline. These little units are a great backup for your familiarity with any lake. Pooch"
1159602,Nimstug,2010-01-12 02:49:00,2605,"Pooch,Would something like a Garmin Etrex Legend work for you? They are a step or two above the basic units. They will zoom down to the point if you are 10' - 20' off your waypoint, you'll be able to see the difference. It serves my purposes on my local trips and Canada. The 'blue' unit has a gray scale display and only comes preloaded with roads. There is a 8 meg memory that you can load maps if you are so inclined. You should be able to find one for about in the $130 - $140 range.NimstugThe physician can bury his mistakes but the architect can only advise his clients to plant vines. -F.L. Wright"
1159697,lawdoer,2010-01-12 11:24:00,8,"They certainly do all of the above....the trip minder also helps you keep track of your distance on a tank of gas and when you may have to switch if you don't have inboard tanks. I have an old Garmin and it is anmazingly accurate, cna just follow your tracks home or intersect the track and follow it home, but you had better still look up once in awhile to look out for islands!"
1160479,cowboyd,2010-01-15 13:51:00,33,IMHO GPS are absolutely essential up there! I can remember how much ribbing I took the first time I brought one up from my buddies. A week of grief about my lack of a sense of direction etc and how they would never be caught dead with one!.That was years ago and I have enjoyed immensly making each one of them eat crow when they asked me which one to get or better yet how to use their new ones at the cabin.I am a life long Garmin fan and for what it is worth my hand held a 60csx. The only thing I would tell you that is an absolute is to make sure whatever you get is waterproof! lol I remember my first one was only water resistent and used to have to use it in the wet weather in a plastic bag.cowboyd
