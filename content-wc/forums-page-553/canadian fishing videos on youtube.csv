You can type in the name of a province, or lake, or the name of a camp, and pull up hundreds of videos , some submitted by individials, and hundreds submitted by camps, and fly in businesses. You can check out their cabins , boats etc. it might help some of you who are searching for a new lake or adventure, or you can type in the species of fish you're interested in , not here to promote a web site, just somthing i think other people who are obcessed with fishing in Canada, like myself, might enjoy, but be carefull, as it is a little addictive, and you might find yourself stuck at the computor for several hours."
