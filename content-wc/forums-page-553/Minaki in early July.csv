1159077,DonC,2010-01-09 13:39:00,93,"I have been around 20+ times to Minaki, but never have fished the first 10 days of July. Will be fishing July 4-9. Usually I am there in late May or first week of June, and some in September. I target mainly smallmouth with tubes. Aslo fish some walleye. When I have fished the French River in early July, the smallmouth were still shallow to 7 feet deep or so. I love fishing moving water when available. If anyone has some experience on the Winnipeg River at Minaki this time of year, and any smallmouth patterns for early July, it will be most appreciated. Thanks, Don C"
1159137,Guest,2010-01-09 21:04:00,0,"Don, Been there plenty of times in early July, fishing the smallies. Of course a lot depends on the progression of the season; which depends on ice out, weather and temps, water level and temps and even weed growth. But for the most part, smallies are generally in a post spawn pattern by that time; they will likely have just started to transition from shallow to deeper water -- actively feeding in both. So you need to look for situations that have both. On the positive side, we've always had decent luck fishing the faster dropping shorelines on the river. For instance, the area down south of Minaki has 3 large islands, in July the side of the islands facing the river will be better than the other sides. There will be decent weed growth by that time, so you can cast to the shoreline, drag the lure over the tops of the weeds (which will still be about 5' or so below the surface in 10-12' of water, and when you get on the outside of the weed line let the lure drop lower. We've used mepps, tubes or chatterbaits for this type of presentation -- casting in and going out and over the weeds and back down as you get to the boat. You'll find the same type of situation on the bottom of Gunn Lake, down toward and in Gavagan Bay. Here the shoreline is even steeper, but there are ledges that the smallies will move to instead of weed lines. Do a similar type presentation -- cast to the shallow soreline, work the lure out just over the bottom and then let the lure fall as you get over the ledge. Smallies will move down the ledges as the morning progresses, and back up them toward evening. Tubes seem to work the best for this situation. Of course if you can find bigger rocks in a little deeper water (8' or so), that is also a good bet. The shore line south of Baker's point leading into that big bay in the south east corner of the northern part of Little Sand is a good example. Smallies will sit at the base of the fractured rocks that sit in 8-10' of water. In Big Sand, we've always found some of the islands offer better smallmouth fishing in late-June to mid-July. Again, the shorelines are a bit stepper, and the smallies will move up and down them from morning to mid day, and early evening to just about dark. So you can work them with tubes, bouncing them down the shoreline. Sugarloaf, parts of Green, the northern shoreline of Vermillion, entire shoreline on Pine Island, and some of the small islands south east of Burnt are good for this presentation. The wind tends to calm down a little more by the end of June, so topwater can get very productive on a semi-calm day. You can target the same areas, and the smallies will usually come up for a Rebel Pop-R, chug bug or even a spook. Sometimes they'll also be on both points leading into the bigger coves, so work the points that shelter Vermillion Bay, Mine Bay, the big bay leading into the narrows to Hidden Lake, etc. The best non-stop smallie fishing I've ever had in early July, was the point and shoreline from the western entrance to the bay that goes to Hidden Lake to the point going to Vermillion Bay. (There's even a small island and rock scattered about, near the point to Vermillion Bay you want to cover all of it, the water is 8-12' in these areas.) We would always hit that area a couple times a week for decent smallies, green pumpkin tubes worked best! Work it slow and methodical, it's a good place to spend 1/2 a day when the smallies are there! On the negative side, some of the shallow bays won't hold many smallies, they will have already moved out toward deeper water and even the big lakes. But some of the deeper bays with steep shorelines like the east side in Moose Bay, will hold pockets of them. If you can find some deeper weeds, in these areas, that's even better! Hope that give you some help and places to start looking. The pattern isn't to hard to identify after the first day or so.... Chuck"
1159235,DonC,2010-01-10 12:29:00,93,"Chuck, Your post is most appreciated. The details are great. Have you ever fished up to the rapids on MacFarlane River. It is not likely any good in July, but we have had great times there earlier. My confidence tube is green pumpkin with orange flake tender tube. I use Tennessee Shad and Rootbeer Pepper also. We will put your recommendations to good use. You have really helped us in the past with your posts. Thanks for your response and I hope you have a great time(s) this year, Don PS: I am going in the first week of June to fish the Northwest Angle in MN on Lake of the Woods for 3-4 days. Never been there, but the neighbor that lives across the street from my wife's parents in Florida has a cabin on Oak Island. Sounds like the fishing is the similar to Minaki, with the crappie being more prevalent perhaps. Will give a report when I get back from both trips."
1159243,Guest,2010-01-10 13:20:00,0,"Don, We've always found that the rapids at the head of the MacRarlane starts to peter out around the first of July. However, my premise is that they move to better locations on the river, a little cooler water, since it can get a lot warmer in the MacFarlane in early July when compared to the Winnepeg: - Check out the deep hole that is off the rapids, fish the very end that is furthest down stream. (I'd say it's about 150-200 yards from the rapids.) We typically use heavier 1/2 to 3/4 oz jigs with a craw tail, cast it out to shallower water down stream of the end of the hole, and drag it back into the hole while making contact with the sloping sides. Of couse the boat will be positioned in the deeper water and you'll rip some weeds when doing this. But the smallies get in the weeds to feed. - There's another hole down stream of the Rail Road trestle, you can do the same with it. Sometimes the smallies will move to the up stream side of that hole by the bridge, so check that too. This hole is much deeper than the previous one (14 to16' or so), and will often hold plenty of smallies, walleye and big northern. You can also cast out a deep running crank bait, as long as it will get 12' deep or so. - There's another hole as you make the sharp left hand turn running toward the Rail Road Trestle, I'd say it is a mile or so before the trestle. Use your sonar to find it, it is quite long and narrow, and the smallies will run up and down the steeper sides like I described before. - Don't overlook some of the shoreline on the Mac Farlane itself, some gets 10-12' deep not far off shore, and there is a lot of rubble and smaller boulders that has come off the shoreline over the years. For instance, as you enter the Mac Farlane, instead of making that first right hand turn as you travel up river, fish the bank straight in front of you (go past the cabin on the left at the entrance). We've found that whole shore line lit up with smallies in July before, that were in the 8' to 14' of water. The'll bust fry on the surface in this area as well, which makes for some nice sheltered topwater that is protected from the northly winds. Good luck with your trip to the NW angle, yes it is similar to Minaki and the north part of Rainy. Chuck"
1159538,DonC,2010-01-11 19:05:00,93,"Chuck, We will work those areas. Never would have fished those spots at the entrance. Some day it would be good to meet you. Perhaps if we are up there at the same time. Thanks again. Don"
