This past weekend I was at camp ice fishing with my 7 year old son Hayden and right behind camp saw 2 black wolves had a Caribou down. Pretty much a once in a lifetime opportunity. I captured some nice photos and some that not everyone wants to see. But hay the wolves are just trying tosurvive. I set up back at camp with the video camera rested against a tree and zoomed way in for some good video , not too shakey. haven't got a clue how to share the video. last photo shows what was left the next morning about 24 hours later. in the am the two blackwolves had been joined by 2 grey wolves and another mottled one. it was not a friendly get together, lots of fighting. we followed the tracks and it was just the two who had sheephearded that caribou over 8 miles down the lake and who knows how far in the bush. by the way that is a woodland caribou and a very big one. NO WE DON'T HUNT WOODLAND CARIBOU. Caught some walleye, pike and whitefish but the highlight was defintely witnessing the natural order of things."

Thanks LarryMac There are plenty of places to catch fish but from my perspective you can't beat a wilderness setting. there are very few days when nature doesn't provide something memorable. A moose, a bear, an eagle, mink, otter, or ?? A sunrise, sunset, Moon or many times it is just the setting itself. I remember fishing the Tree River out of Plummers Great Bear lodge. I said that even if I hadn't caught a fish it was still well worth the trip. for anyone who can afford it you will not be dissappointed in that trip. I could go on trying to describe it for a long time. It is simply magical. Chantrey Inlet and the rapids flowing out of Yathkyed lake are two others that are still vivid in my mind. I guess that is why I like Dan Gapens books so much. When I started travelling the arctic I realized how people from the city felt when they visited my home in northwestern Ontario. With one notable acception ( in most cases). I was already pre programmed to notice all the little things that many people, even those living here, do not notice. Those little things and how they are all interconnected that has intrigued me my entire life. I've tried to hone that quest for information and curiosity with my kids. Heck I've seen memorable natural images even driving thru Nebraska. I was coming home from the Omaha show last winter and their was a huge full moon right on the horizon with cars appearing to be driving into and out of it. It was spectacular. So I thought I'd share it with you. kg"
