1160080,Muskie Bob,2010-01-13 22:35:00,45,"Pine Grove is right next to Travelers (Travelers was closed last year)I think we paid around $75 (US dollars) including tax on a Friday night. Call their toll free 800 to check on rates.Two years ago we didn't make reservations in advance and looked at Travelers. We decided to stay with Pine Grove. Normally we make reservations in advance. One year they were booked up due to a fishing tournament.They operate a base camp with cabins too. However, we've always stayed in the motel. It's not real fancy, but it is clean. tv, air conditioned, coffee maker, 2 beds, small table with a couple of chairs,Just call and ask them for info and rates. The older lady running it is real nice.hope that helps."
1160130,SSA,2010-01-14 08:13:00,19,"Indian Point rates are fair in comparision. They offer cabins and a bunkhouse for 110.00 a night based on 4 people, 10.00 a person if placing more than 4 into the cabin."
1160245,brn2fsh,2010-01-14 15:11:00,49,If you go to Indian Point (in june) stay for one extra day and ask Hank about going down to Trap lake for Smallmouth. It was AWESOME!!!! Rob
1160347,ILScott,2010-01-15 07:19:00,139,"Getting close to narrowing hotel/motel down but have one more question. Does anybody know if a guide on eagle, wabigoon, wabaskang or lac suel would be willing to take people out for a afternoon trip on a Friday? Some muskie fisherman in the group.Scott"
1160926,brn2fsh,2010-01-17 13:12:00,49,"Don't mean to keep pushing Indian Point, but they have an awesome guide maned Scott. He also guides neighboring waters such as Suel . Got an Email into Indian point to get his contact info so you can get ahold of him. Rob"
1160947,v-bay gord,2010-01-17 14:34:00,3168,"I know that the Pine Grove Motel in Vermilion Bay is connected to a guiding service (either Brad, or Scott Munford). You might be able to line something up that way."

1158339,ILScott,2010-01-06 15:16:00,139,Doing some research on where to stay the night before we go in to our camp. Looking at Dryden. Any feedback on Trans Canadian Motel and Restaurant or the Chalet Inn. Going to Perrault Falls on the Saturday. Any places in Vermillion Bay that would be recommended? Any help would be appreciated. Any lodges that would have any openings for a night?ThanksScott
1158344,camp chef,2010-01-06 15:37:00,915,this may be too far south for your plans but we apend the night on Rainy at Island view resort about 15 minutes east of International falls.We head to Minaki the next morning. Island view has liquid refreshment and very good food with a gorgeous view of the water. Being a fishing resort there are plenty of people in the bar to chat with as you wash down the days travel dust. The rooms are adequate and the coffee is hot and plentiful in the morning before we resume our trip. The older we get the less we care to drive in a given day. It takes us about 8 hours to get to IF and then a leisurely 4 hours to camp the second day
1158349,SSA,2010-01-06 16:12:00,19,Indian Point Camp on Wabigoon Lake just south of Dryden does overnighting. Many people overnight there before flying in the next morning. They would be worth a try. Fair prices too.
1158674,tackleman,2010-01-07 20:39:00,444,with the decline in tourism in the area due to the recession I would think that most camps would be glad to have a cabin rented for a night. I suppose though it would depend on the time of the year you are coming.Up here in Red Lake the camp owners say they could rent out their closets in May and June.
1158701,fishman10,2010-01-08 06:10:00,226,the trans is reasonably priced with a restaurant on site and on the highway
1158710,NEWMARGUY,2010-01-08 07:00:00,34,You are close to Sioux Narrows at Dryden - Try ice fishing out of Sioux Narrows on Lake of the Woods and surrounding Trout Lakes. See my Tread on my ice fishing experience a couple weeks ago out there. There is good rooms at Crystal Harbour - $70 a night - attached restaurant. Joh Struthdrier - Mine Shaft at the Bridge in Sioux Narrows does guide service for ice fishing . Had an outstanding time.
1158923,Muskie Bob,2010-01-08 18:48:00,45,"Pine Grove Motel99 Highway 17 EastVermilion Bay, ONP0V 2V01-800-567-LAKE I just registered so I could give you this information. The motel has non-smoking rooms with 2 beds, air conditioner, etc. The rooms have always been clean. We've never had any problems parking with boat trailer.We usually check in early enough to do some fishing on Eagle Lake. There is a public launch not too far away."
1158925,2746,2010-01-08 19:00:00,3206,No experience with the Chalet but the Trans Canadian has very basic but clean and reasonable rooms. The restaurant is excellent and we often eat dinner or breakfast there. If you want a bit nicer accomadations both the Best Western and Holiday Inn Express are good. Best Western rooms come with a full breakfast in their restaurant. Both of these motels will be in the $90-110 range.
1159161,ILScott,2010-01-10 06:36:00,139,"thanks for all the replies. Where is the Pine Grove located in Vermillion Bay. Is it close to the corner store? What is the price of the rooms? We stayed at the motel right across the road from 105 2 years ago but I think that is closed now, I believe it was called the traveler.Scott"
1159286,scar,2010-01-10 18:13:00,196,we stay at the chalet inn every year. rooms are cheap! about $45 us/night. clean and good attached restaraunt.
