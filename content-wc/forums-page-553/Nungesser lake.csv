1158375,ManitowishWaters,2010-01-06 17:50:00,39,"booked a trip with birchpoint lodge for the first week of august. First year on the lake our group had been going to the same place for the last 12 years. Nervous/excited for new water. We have found fish on mid lake humps jigging with 3/8oz jig and minnow and found pike in weedy bays in the past. Should we expect similar fishing or different. Normally fish eyes in the morning and pike in the afternoon. Probably avg 25-30 eyes/morning. Sizes to 28"". Any tips/advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!"

We fished with Anglers Kingdom and Kevin and his staff were wonderful at getting us started in the right direction.
