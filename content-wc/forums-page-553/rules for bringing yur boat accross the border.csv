1158729,mwal,2010-01-08 08:02:00,151,a Friend of mine heard that you need some some sort of permit required to bring a boat with a motor into the country. Has anyone heard of this? I know of the rule requiring boaters safty course if you have your boat up there for more than 45 days or if you rent a resort boat. Mwal

It certainly hasn't been the case in the past as we always have a boat and nothing special is required. We're usually asked how long we'll be in country and when we say 1 week, they say ""have a good trip""."

1159613,Reelcranky,2010-01-12 05:39:00,31,Whenever I trailered my boat into Ontario I was required to pull over and fill out a CBSA report which declares your boat and trailer this form did not cost anything and is good for a year. This was at the bridge in Windsor Ontario. They also required you to have on your person if you were inspected by the MNR I hope this helps.

I cross into Ontario routinely, and pass customs @ Rainy River. In the past 9 years of crossing into Ontario I have never been requstedto provide any paperwork or produce any entry permits for my Pro-V. I have also crossed @ International Falls & Fort Frances, Ont. over the years & have not run into any special reqirements for the boat & trailer."
1159657,ohiojmj,2010-01-12 08:18:00,1262,"I have always brought ownership, registration, and insurance papers for my boat/motor/trailer when crossing into Ontario from Buffalo or 1000 island bridge in northern NY. I have never been asked a single question going into Canada about my boats. Once on return, the US customs agent asked me if i had bought the boat (it was beand new) in Canada. My new concern is how i prove ownership of my 9.9 Merc kicker motor that I bought for cash, have no receipt, and Ohio has not title/registration requirements for. Guess it doesn't look new so, I'll not worry."
