1402741,Angwalleye,2012-03-04 15:05:00,27,Can anyone recommend a portable fish finder to take to Canada. The boats are electric start so power isn't an issue.
1402747,SinOrSwim,2012-03-04 15:17:00,1528,"Just make sure you turn it off when not using the boat.But, if you have power, then you can make any fish finder portable. Just buy the portable case to mount it in. Pretty much comes down to what you want. Basic depth, color, gps etc and budget."
1402748,TIGHTLINER,2012-03-04 15:19:00,223,My boy and i both have a fishing buddy c 140 they both work great and it keeps all the unit out of the boat and no wires to get tangled up in while fishing. Just make sure you tie the bracket on to the boat the fish finder itself will float but not the bracket. You are going to get a lot of posts on finding a unit.
1403584,SSH,2012-03-06 13:07:00,526,"Just bought a Humminbird PiranhaMax 160 portable at Amazon for $110. It came with battery, charger, case and PiranhaMax 160 dual beam transducer. The PiranhaMax with the light off only draws 100 ma, so the 7 AH battery will last a long time. One of the guys brings a 30 Watt solar panel charger if any of the batteries get to low. Haven't tried it yet, but should good enough for our fly-in."
1403606,jambi,2012-03-06 14:08:00,504,"I have the pirahnamax , think its the 230. Went all week last year without changing batteries. Worked better than I hoped."
1403655,dirka13,2012-03-06 15:27:00,15,"i have the Lowrance mark 5 portable unit, clarity is amazing, i can see my jig on bottom if i am anchored, worked great up in quebec the 12 volt battery they give you is pretty good, that 30w solar panel sounds like a great idea"
1404210,stevensinks,2012-03-08 10:12:00,330,All of the boats at the camp we go are electric start. So I just got transducer with a suction cup mount and take my good unit. I really like having the gps up there.
1404266,bassface44,2012-03-08 11:34:00,96,"I am always surprised by all the guys using pirhanas and fishin buddies. Not that they are bad units, I have used both and they work fine but for a few extra bucks the Humminbird 570 is tough to beat in my opinion. If you are on a fly in with no way to recharge and don't want to bring extra gel cell batteries because of weight I can see the utility of units that use AA batteries though."
1404440,Larry Mac,2012-03-08 18:34:00,530,"Hi Angwalleye, I have been a Humminbird fan for many years (Still have 2 100SX portables that work perfectly after many years and many trips). We have used the 385c unit (Portable) on two flyins this past year. I cannot be happier. Seen the fish, called the fish and caught the fish time and time again LOL. We watched our jigs bounce up and down on the bottom. Electronics just keep better and better and there are many very good units available. One thing for sure I do not leave home without them. Enjoy your trip and Have a great year.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1404559,bassface44,2012-03-08 22:55:00,96,Larry. I am totally on board with your love of Humminbird. Much better value than Lowrance imho right now. I have used the 385c as well and like it but prefer the larger screen. If you need a dual unit with GPS though on a budget that is your rig. I am almost positive that that unit takes navionics cards as well so another plus if you don't already have a handheld GPS if you went with the 385c.
