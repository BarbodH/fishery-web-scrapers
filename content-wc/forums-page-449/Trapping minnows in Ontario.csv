1403594,Shellback,2012-03-06 13:40:00,8083,"Are there laws regarding trapping minnows for bait in Ontario? I seem to remember reading that it's illegal for non residents. I may be mistaken and am thinking about from state to state in the US. What I'm considering is setting a minnow trap at the dock of a Canadian resident who allows me to use his dock for my boat while visiting. I guess I could have him set the trap, but would it be legal for me to have the minnows aboard my boat with no sales receipt? I enjoy fishing Canada too much to jeopardize my visits."
1403634,JayM5209,2012-03-06 15:01:00,1050,"From the Ontario regs, ""Only resident anglers may capture baitfish."" The page is at http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business...02_165361.html. Can't help with the ""no receipt"" question."
1403782,TroyMansfield,2012-03-06 20:42:00,92,"a resident can trap and posses up to 12 doz minnows, he can give you minnows, he just can not sell them to you, I wouldnt get caught setting the trap myself. but totally legal if a resident gives you the minnows for free"
1403815,SeulAreaWalleye,2012-03-06 22:12:00,100,.....so what you're saying Troy is that I have to give you my minnows for free now too...LOL (cost ya another case)
1403843,Shellback,2012-03-07 05:39:00,8083,"Thanks for the info fellows. I thought the Ontario regs spelled that out about non residents, just wasn't sure as I left the book in the cottage. Tough getting any live bait around where I fish, with exception the worms at Canadian Tire. I won't have any trouble having my friend set the trap. He knows I'm good for some filleted and bagged perch to put in his freezer."
1403913,TroyMansfield,2012-03-07 08:47:00,92,"good one collin, but I'm a resident these days, so I can trap minnows, and get a moose tag! But Ill get the next case again if you wanna go trap some minoow sometime....lol 8 doz = case of beer **** near, we better start trapping so we can afford the beer"
