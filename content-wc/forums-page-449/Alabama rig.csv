In case your not familiar with this rig which is being used extensively by the bass pro's, it has a single tie on head followed by five wires that spread a pattern, each about 5 or 6 inches in length. Each wire has a swivel snap to which you attach a bait. The bait is usually a single hook jig or grub. This lets you from one hook tie, troll or cast five lures. When you think of it, most plugs have six hooks, ie. two trebles. Visually, your trying to create a school of baitfish...........In saltwater its called an umbrella rig and works great. Lures that fish haven't seen before are often very effective. Question is the legallity of it."

Two lines may be used when angling from a boat in parts of the Great Lakes (see exceptions to the general regulations) and for ice fishing in many areas (see Ice Fishing, page 11). A fishing line must not have more than four hooks attached You can use a Bama Rig as long as it does not have more than 4 hooks. Its my understanding that some manufacturers are coming out with 4 wire Ontario rigs. You can still use the 5 wire rigs as long as one is rigged dummy style without a hook, or just snip a wire. That's my plan."
