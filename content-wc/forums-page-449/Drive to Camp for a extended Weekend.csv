Any suggestions?? She likes fishing, but fishing by us is bad, so i want to take her to a place where she can catch good, quaility fish. Mostly Pike and Walleye, but perch would be a bonus as well Thanks for any advice"
1403871,wallydave,2012-03-07 07:29:00,2151,Bill http://www.lacseul.com/ check out GBC. Andrea offers a daily rate on cabins and boats. The Camp is about 3-4 hours from I-Falls. She has updated her website this season. Good luck finding a spot!

Plenty of resorts and, if you are so inclined, plenty of FREE camping on developed campsites throughout VNP. Same on Crane, Sandpoint, Namakan, Kabetogama. Lots of choices - visit the Kab website or Rainy Lake website for plenty of info. Great fishing. Scott"

It was a very comfortable, affordable camp with exceptional fishing. I have also attached a few pics from that trip. The lake offers walleye, Northern, smallmouth, perch and musky. We caught all species less the musky. If you would like to PM me I will forward more pics and info. Where ever you decide to go have a great trip.""Our Group returned from Cedar Lake Saturday 6/26/10 from 1 week of fabulous fishing. The weather was cooperative and so were the fish. Walleye, Smallmouth, Northern and Perch were active. The largest walleye was 27.5"", Largest Smallmouth was 20"", largest perch was 12"" and the Largest northern was 38"". We personally did not fish the musky but we did see Bob Messecomer filming an episode of ""Simply Fishing ""on the lake. The mayfly hatch was just finishing up and did not appear to hamper our fishing. Activity was good and the trip was an overall success. Crossing into and out of Canada was uneventful. Cedar Lake Camp is an inexpensive Drive to camp in Perrault Falls Ontario. The cabins come complete with all cooking utensils, pots, pans, plates ect. You may bring your own boat to this lake but also provide them with the cabin. The fishing is extremely easy and it has a variety of species"".Thank you,Larry Mac"
