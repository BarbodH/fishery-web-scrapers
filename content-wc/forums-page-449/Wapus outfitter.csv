1326722,trapperbob,2011-07-06 18:44:00,45,Has any fished at any of the lakes through wapus controlled territory? Thinking about giving them a shot soon. They are in Quebec off of clova road. Thanks in advance.
1401310,rappoo,2012-03-01 11:42:00,5,"Around 10 June 2011, four of us went to Wapus & stayed in Cabin on McArthur. Fishing pretty hard for 5 days, the four of us caught 4 Walleyes (biggest 11 inches) ~ 150 Northerns ( biggest 26 inches). Yes, I'm embarrassed, but our efforts seemed to be on par with others we talked to there. Weather was great, lakes were beautiful, cabin was super, boats/motors were fine & hosts were good. Mosquitios were fierce and Very hungry. Road (100km) was a bit rough but passable. Fished McArthur & Polliquin (spelling?) Was hoping to find something within reasonable driving distance from East Coast (Wash. DC area), rather than driving to say Pickle Lake, Ontario, but this didn't work out so well. Still looking for possible sites for fall & next year. Have plans for Gouin Resevoir (Mattawa) this June. Hope this helps. Rappoo."
1401995,trapperbob,2012-03-02 19:29:00,45,Have been to Gouin Reservior in the past both times to plamodon bay area. Had great fishing with lots of walleye and a fair # of pike. Went with air tamarac. This year going to sarana bay on the gouin with air tamarac. We probably had in the neighborhood of 350 walleye for the week. No trophys with the largest being 23 inches. Hope this helps.
