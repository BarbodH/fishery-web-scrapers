This year we were thinking about trying Big Vermillion and Lost Lake. We dont have a big boat (14' lund with a 9.9 merc), so we dont want to go far. As far as big vermillion, we where thinking about targeting Lakers and Pike....and suggestions as far as locations for these? We are all catch and release, we usually only keep a few walleyes for shore lunch. And on Lost lake, we were thinking about putting in at the landing just outside of Hudson, any suggestions on where to start from there? I bought a backroads mapbook and its awesome! I wish i had a good contour map of these lakes, cant seem to find any, does anyone know where i can? Thanks! Greenman"
1400700,scar,2012-02-29 08:28:00,196,"Pick a calm day for Lost lake as you will need to cross big water to get to the best fishing. Just look for wind blowing into a clay bank, a point or an island and you will catch eyes. The big part of Lost from the landing can get rolling pretty good on a windy day though"
1400710,Guest,2012-02-29 08:38:00,0,"about how far will i need to go? like i said, i dont have a very big boat/motor. any good maps that can help me out?"
1401152,Lonefisherman,2012-03-01 04:40:00,13,"If you plan on fishing Big Vermillion you will have to fish the East end if you have a small boat. The big part of Big Vermillion is huge for a fourteen foot boat and a small motor. I know I would never venture out on the big part of Big Vermillion with a small boat. We had to drive to the landing on Lac Suel to get to Lost Lake to fish the Walleye's. I think Little Vermillion might be a good bet for you to try as it is much smaller than Big Vermillion. Big Vermillion has Smallmouth, Muskies, Lake Trout and Northern but does not have any Walleye's in it. Little Vermillion I think has the same possibly, but not sure about the Lake Trout. If you trailor over to try and get to lost lake, it is about 15 miles from the landing to get to lost lake. Hope I have gave you some insight as to what info you might be looking for."
1401202,Jimmy Jig,2012-03-01 07:57:00,1905,"Little Vermilllion is closed to Lake Trout. It has a lot of SM bass and muskies, no wallelyes"
1401315,Pooch,2012-03-01 11:48:00,4619,We fish Little Vermillion one day every fall on our way to Lac Seul. Go through the park and launch there. Good facilities.Little V has a good population of small mouth. We can catch good numbers the size in the attached picture with plenty of larger ones are there too. Just didn't catch them last trip.Nice lake to day fish.Pooch
1401467,BenBeattie,2012-03-01 17:09:00,232,"Definitely pick low wind days on Big V and Lost with your small boat. Both big water. When you launch at Hudson on Lac Seul, you are on Lost lake. Depending what time of year, you can head straight North by a couple miles and catch fish. I never fish really close to that launch myself... but I'm sure you would find something worthwhile. You don't have to go far to catch pike and lakers on Big V either. Get a map when you get here (AL's sports store on Front St.) and start exploring."
