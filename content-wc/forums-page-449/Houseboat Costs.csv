1397789,falkopat,2012-02-22 13:14:00,44,"we have been houseboating it for 3 years, and 18 years before that all at frograpids camp in town. We use lac suel floating lodges-bottom line great people. We go with a group of 6 guys so our costs are alittle higher. Per guy with gas,food, license and bait about 1000-1100 a guy. If we had 8 the trip would be about 150 less a guy. We bring our own boats, we eat great food(only 3 fish fries), and we drink a fair amount. Awsome part is we call it a day early alot and go back and bobber fish off the back of the house boats so we can have a few legal cocktails. There are evening where we will easily catch 75-100 walleye in 2-3 hours off the back of the boat before dinner. fact of the mater is we love the houseboat trip and it is worth the extra cost. Key factors are going with a good group of guys who all think alike. We all get up around the same time, all enjoy staying up late playing card. We all know our jobs on the boat and it goes well, bring one or two lazy or angry guys and i wouldn't want to be on the houseboat all week with them. If someone wants the actual breakdown i can get you a spread sheet. My father is kind of anal about that stuff so he has everything down to food lists. just pm mepat"
1398189,cuamb,2012-02-23 11:04:00,203,"Been with SLFL since 98. I tell the guys to plan on $1000/person. Includes rental, HB gas, boat gas, gas for the trucks, pilot, license, bait and groceries. Only thing not covered is the beverages."
1398324,Ranger319,2012-02-23 15:42:00,166,"IM's sent to tsquared, icenut59, and falkopatThanks and keep opinions coming!"
1398360,tsquared,2012-02-23 16:57:00,57,"We loved the trip, different than a fly in, but a solid fishing trip and one we are repeating this year. We used Sioux Lookout floating lodges as they had the VIP fishing boats which were awesome. We had 7 people on a 60 footer and rented four boats. A little cramped in terms of space for clothes, but as always we brought too much stuff. Our final # (which included gas to drive two vehicles from STL), 4 VIP fishing boats, licenses, conservation card and food was $1,300 plus alcohol. If you went with lower boats, drops your cost quite a bit - we like to try different parts of lake and ""hunt"" pike, so we used twice as much gas as most people."
1398465,bassface44,2012-02-23 22:20:00,96,"The group I fish with have been going with Houseboat Adventures out of Kenora for the last 3 years so I can not speak for or against either of the Lac Seul offerings. We have looked into them but it hasn't been in the cards to give them a try yet. As for what things we plan for cost wise here is a short run down off the top of my head. Cost of the houseboat (how many days), cost of rental boats, is gas included, bait??, TAX, beer, liquor (border limits), ice, Fishing license, travel, exchange rate, hotel coming and going, mid week check (included? extra check?). We have a few in our group that fly so we think about differences in cost for flying vs driving, flying to different cities and renting cars vs having a cab service take us to our destination. We try to think of every conceivable thing we could be charged for and plan accordingly and then have everyone bring around 200 cash for incidentals that truly can not be planned for. I don't know how much your trip may end up being but even though I haven't been to Lac Seul I can assure you you will have an awesome time. The houseboat experience is really fun."
1399013,fishnutbob,2012-02-25 10:46:00,633,Rainy Lake would be a good choice also. Ive been on one trip out of Kenora lots of fun. http://www.rainylakehouseboats.com/fishing.html
1404002,GeoHawk,2012-03-07 12:20:00,7,"Add me to those that have rented from Floating Lodges in Sioux Narrows. My dad and I have been going most years since 1982 (when I was 11). Our most recent trip was in 2010 and it ran right around $6000 for the week for everyone. That's roughly how much it has been that last several years renting a 54-foot houseboat. That cost is for everything but gas for the drive up: Houseboat, food, fuel for both the houseboat and small boats, alcohol, bait, licenses etc. We fix fish about every other night to keep some of the food cost down, but other than that, we don't skimp on anything. We also bring our own small boats, so we don't rent any from Jim.So just divide that cost by the number of people you have going (we usually have between 7-11 guys go). I did see that the houseboat rental went up $100 from two years ago (we have this year's trip scheduled for Memorial Day week)."
1397494,Ranger319,2012-02-21 20:40:00,166,"For all you Houseboat vets, can you give me some info on costs on what it REALLY costs to rent a houseboat for the week? Thinking SLFL right now but is LSFL better? Also, any tips,hints, things newbie's wouldn't think of...greatly appreciated"
1397516,unclejoe,2012-02-21 21:36:00,22,"Ranger, t-squared kept a detailed spreadsheet of oUr august trip last year. Will ask him to send to you. The only big difference that is important to me is the fishing boat setup. We went with the outfit that had the VIP boats as we don't pull up boats. I think our turn key price including food gas everything was 1,200 per man but we did not skimp on anything"
1397574,tsquared,2012-02-22 06:23:00,57,"Yes, send me a PM and I can send you my recap. Our all in costs included driving two vehicles from STL, food, etc."
1397576,icenut59,2012-02-22 06:32:00,8,Our group has gone for the last 5 years. Alway have used LSFL. Send me a PM and I will give you our thoughts.
1397591,Guest,2012-02-22 07:06:00,0,Why not give us all the info? What was the cost? what are your thoughts?
1397608,5richards,2012-02-22 07:29:00,131,I'm interested too
1397612,Pikehunters,2012-02-22 07:36:00,100,Bring it on & what lake are you talking about Simco???
1397627,Knutson21,2012-02-22 07:49:00,348,"I have been with a group that has been doing a 60 foot house boat from Floating Lodges in Souix Narrows. I started going with the guys in 1995 and cost was $650.00 Per person everything except gas to drive up. I took over running the trip in 2008 and we have fluctuated between $800 and 850.00 per guy includes everything except gas to drive up. That is all food, gas, liscense, bait, etc etc. This is a not a drinking group so there is no beer figured into that price, we leave that to yourself if you want to bring any up you are on your own, that keeps the cost fair since not everyone drinks. We sleep 12 guys on the houseboat, two of us bring our own boats and we rent 4. If you put 3 or 4 guys in a vehicle from Chicago your gas bill can't be more then $100 per guy. I have looked at houseboats on LS and I think it is more cost per person."
1397646,Guk,2012-02-22 08:33:00,39,"We have been going out of Floating Lodges since 1999, typically we go with 9 guysand rent a 58 foot houseboat with the cost being $950 a person.....that price includes EVERYTHING...rental, beer / booze (20 cases of beer and a dozen 1.75 ltr bottles of booze), duty on the extra alcohol, bridge crossing fee, fishing licenses, ontario outdoors cards, groceries, gas in 3 trucks, 3 boats (we bring our own--all with 150 hp or larger engines) houseboat and generator, and travel meals. This year we have the 60 foot houseboat reserved and the price will be no more than an extra $50 a guy more because we are taking an additional 3 guys along! It is by far the best fishing vacation I have ever been on! You take the houseboat out 25 to 30 miles and you are right in the heart of some of the best fishing on earth...there is no where to spend money once you get on the houseboat and if a guy wants to take a session off of fishing to sleep in, he doesn't miss out on the entire day like you would if you stayed in town at a resort. It really allows everyone to enjoy their vacation at their own pace! If anyone wants detailed info, send me a PM and I will gladly give you everything we have compiled over the last dozen years right down to the grocery list!"
1397687,teddi,2012-02-22 09:42:00,349,how much do you charge for your houseboats and what is included?
