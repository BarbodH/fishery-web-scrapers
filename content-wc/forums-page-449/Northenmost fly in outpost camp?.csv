1400872,dhottle,2012-02-29 13:31:00,163,Plummer's artic circle lodge would probably qualify.
1400971,adempsey,2012-02-29 16:15:00,963,"I remember talking to some outfitters from Nunavut and Greenland at a fishing show a couple of years ago. Don't recall the names. They would probably be better described as aboriginal guides than outfitters though. Not sure if they would be further north than the Plummer's camps.In Ontario, I think it might be the Moccasin Trails outpost on Winisk or one of the Big Hook Wilderness Camp outposts (Cocos, West, Central).In Quebec, maybe the Mirage Outpost on Clearwater or the Cargair Outposts on Amichinatwayach. There are probably others in Quebec though.Not sure about the other provinces.Plummer's would sure be amazing though."

Saw the Inuit's skin a bear at 2 am in sunlight, it never went down the week we were there. Saw musox and caribou, flew in a DC-3 and a flyout for grayling (100 in a day!)My buddy got a 4 lbder on a fly rod. Forgot to add I My fishing buddy and I both jumped into the Artic ocean at the Tree river, GD Cold!!!!"
