1322238,DonC,2011-06-24 14:04:00,93,"Philip, They were on rocky points, usually on the front edge where the current was hitting intially. Depth was 1-6 feet of water. Caught a few on a rock wall near Money Cliff in 2-8 feet of water. Fished a channel ledge across from Buzzard Rock and caught 4. The mayfly hatch was heavy, so that may have something to do with the bass being up in large numbers. Used a green pumpkinseed with orange flake tube mostly, and a 2 inch pumpkin Berkley Power Grub on 1/8 ounce jighead. You and your son must be sitting on Go for the Winnipeg River, Don"
1327038,jstme,2011-07-07 12:23:00,269,I will be headed up for the first week of August! We have been there every year for the last 6 years this time of year always a blast lots of fish.

1385712,DonC,2012-01-25 04:06:00,93,"Steve, Your food preparations were outstanding and my wife very much enjoyed the vegan menu. We will miss you, Don"
1402627,crazyfisher,2012-03-04 10:28:00,25,"Don, Are you returning to Birch Island in the 2012 season?"
1402807,DonC,2012-03-04 18:10:00,93,"Steve, I was putting a trip together. Unfortunately it did not come together for June. If I can get some interested for July or September, then I will be there. This would be the first year I miss if we do not make it. Hope to see you this year, Don"
1320081,DonC,2011-06-19 13:54:00,93,"Just got back from Birch Island Resort at Minaki. Fished with 2 other guys. We caught a total of around 500 smallmouth up to 18 inches. Most were caught on Bass Pro tender tubes. I tried a Scounger without much effect, just to use something new. I did catch some smallmouth in 8-10 feet of water off the shore with a 5/16 ounce Steel Shad, which is a blade bait, to see if there were some females laying out, which there was. We caught a few walleye trolling jig spinners with 1/16 ounce jigheads and 2 inch Berkley Power Grubs. My partner had a 12 inch walleye near the boat when he said, ""there is a big pike or musky right below the walleye"". I looked and did not see it, then he said ""there it is again"". Still I did not see it, and he said it swam away, to be followed by ""there it is again"". Anyway, he pulled the little walleye in without the big fish striking the walleye. We started to backtroll again, and in 15-20 seconds, a big fish hit his lure. He was fishing an ultralight pole with 6 pound gold stren, and his rod was bent double. In about 5 minutes, a large musky was seen. My partner is in his 70's, and he fought the musky for 35-40 minutes, since we did not have a musky net. I tried to hand land it several times, but it was not tired enough and would blast away when I touched it. This encounter occurred between 8:45 to 9:20 pm. A boat then came in to Boathouse at Birch Island, as we were fishing back of the island, and then 2 figures walked to the staff cabin. I yelled to them, and one was the owners son, and they both ran back to the boat when I told them I needed a musky net and that we were fighting the musky with 6 pound test. They came shooting around the island a full speed in the boat, and positioned their boat about 10-12 feet away from my boat. The musky would swim frequently under my boat, then decided to go over the his boat, and was netted. It was 45 inches in length. I told my partner that the musky was not interested in the walleye, only his 2 inch white walleye Power Grub that was in the walleye's mouth. We also caught a large amount of eater Perch, mainly on tender tubes. Caught some walleye and sauger, but did not target them much. The largest Pike was 40 inches. All in all, a memorable trip, Don"
1320083,DonC,2011-06-19 13:58:00,93,"I forgot to mentioned that we came across a wolf swimming across a 300 yard channel. Tried to get close for some pictures, and took some, but the wolf really took off swimming. Never thought it could move so fast. Don"
1320128,Reels,2011-06-19 16:31:00,2876,Thanks Don. Always look forward to your reports. Are they pre spawn or done? What was your best colors?
1320247,DonC,2011-06-19 22:33:00,93,"Reels, Tender Tube in green pumpkinseed with orange flakes were best. Some caught on rootbeer pepper also. I like 1/4 ounce jigheads, though 1/8 ounce are fine. The smallmouth have not spawned yet, and most of the females had not moved up, though that may be changed by now. The wood laydowns were holding smallmouth also. Jigspinners also caught smallmouth and walleye shallow. On a colder, overcast rainy day, I will troll jigspinners in 6-8 feet of water, usually backtrolling. If I catch a walleye, I then make about 5 casts in the area to pick up some more walleye, then continue trolling. That technique has produced with cold fronts. It also produces early morning, and especially in the evening. Good luck, Don"
1320309,Aaron-IN,2011-06-20 07:08:00,500,"Don,Thanks for the update. As of yesterday I heard that the smallmouth had not yet come up to spawn on the North end of Big Sand, glad I moved my trip back a week this year. Sound like you had a good time as usual.Aaron"
1320763,DonC,2011-06-21 05:01:00,93,"Aaron, Have a great trip. Look forward to hearing the reports from everyone who wants to post. Don"
1320861,PCW,2011-06-21 09:55:00,7,"Hey DonC,This is Philip from Nashville. Sounds like you had a great trip. We are headed up the first week of July. How was the water level? Can't wait to get back up there as it's been 4 years now since we were last there."
1320950,DonC,2011-06-21 13:45:00,93,"Philip, Great to hear from you. I really enjoyed fishing with you on Lake Barkley. We should do that again. I used the drop shot rig on Lake Barkley with good success last year. The water level was 18 inches higher than usual. They decreased the flow from 900 to 700 cubic meters/second yesterday, so it will be lower. www.lwcb.ca/noticeboard.html. How many are in your group to Birch Island this year? We had the boathouse this year which I really enjoy. Hope you have a great trip, Don"
1320961,PCW,2011-06-21 14:09:00,7,My son and I are going up. We aren't staying at Birch. I'm renting a cabin and we are fishing with Ian.Let's do the Barkley and KY lake thing again. I really enjoyed it.
1322041,DonC,2011-06-24 06:55:00,93,"Philip, I went fishing from 4:30 to 8:30pm last evening and caught 44 fish, of which 40 were bass. Largest smallmouth was 19 inches. It was the best fishing that I have had on this lake. Have a great trip to Minaki and we can plan for some fishing here on Lake Barkley in the future, Don"
