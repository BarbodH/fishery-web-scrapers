The place lodge we're headed to supplies regular nets but not cradles.Has anybody had any success making one of these? If you could share some tips and/or supply ideas, that would be great. (Yes, I did a search but didn't see anything.)If you're reading this and thinking, ""these guys must be really anxious to get out on the water,"" you're right. Thanks,- Steve"

Talk to any landscaper that builds retaining walls & ask them for geo-grid, for netting, it comes in 6' & 8' widths. This can be cut in any lenght. The geo grid looks like chicken wire but the material is similar to your rubber nets."
1400696,Mark R,2012-02-29 08:24:00,1538,"Steve, I have one that I bought for muskie fishing but never used it. I would sell it to you if your intrested in buying one."
1400748,Obabikon,2012-02-29 09:47:00,2370,"My first one I made myself. I used two old hockey sticks that I cut the blades off of. I also put weights on the entry point to make sure the net itself stayed down when I went for the scoup. It worked well, but a high end scoop net is better and just as safe for the fish."
1400756,a3dad,2012-02-29 10:04:00,115,If you do make or buy one be sure to practice using it on some smaller fish first. I lost a HUGE Pike on my buddy fumbling with the **** thing.

1402814,Mark R,2012-03-04 18:33:00,1538,"Mine has wood handles so it will float. The cradle has has a ""ruler"" panited onto the cradle that measures from the middle 28 iches in both directions. Also has a case so when not in use it will be out of the way not being snagged by hooks or anything else."
1402985,Bill Krejca,2012-03-05 08:08:00,6107,"A friend has one, and it seems to work OK. I've wondered, however, the possibilities of the ""netter"", while bent over directly in line with the fish, getting a face full of lure/fish mouth, as it appears the fish can quickly move forward much easier than backwards as it is being netted. Maybe kinda like squatting of front of a catapult. Just my thoughts. Bill Krejca"
1403257,bucont,2012-03-05 18:00:00,375,"I use a cradle and have had a few close calls with hooks and teeth. I now also use a large musky net coupled with the cradle. Where these shine is in fish recovery IMO. I'll use mine after the catch, dehook and photos and then a short recovery in the cradle to release."
