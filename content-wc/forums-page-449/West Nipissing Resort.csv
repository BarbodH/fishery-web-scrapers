1390543,doubleheader,2012-02-06 12:16:00,2652,I've never been there. Looks to be on the big lake and all my years have been spent on the west arm of Nipissing.
1402695,ripnjig,2012-03-04 13:01:00,3,"VINNYD,Have not stayed at West Nip resort, but have fished most other areas of Lake Nipissing. ie South Bay, Calandar Bay, Manitou Islands etc. I've found the ticket to Nip walleye are green/chartreuse jigs with crawler or leach.(I seem to get the better sizes on leeches. Plenty of bass and muskie too but you're too early for them. Saw a recent fishing show on tv & they filmed out of west nip lodge summer months. They seemed to do well."
