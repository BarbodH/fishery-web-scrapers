Anyway, we saw the sign in the bar window while visiting an antique shop across the road. The owner told us what lawyers were and had a smile on his face. Took a picture to send to a lawyer friend of mine."
1401665,bigdaddyguns,2012-03-02 06:50:00,608,"Lawyer is an alias for a different species, the bowfin (dogfish). We fried one up once and tried to eat it. Simply horrible. They look at lot better than they taste."
1402233,Guest,2012-03-03 10:16:00,0,never tried it but see website attached http://www.lakevermilion.com/fishtales/fishtales6.html
1402966,Bigfishhunter,2012-03-05 07:26:00,803,"They are actully very, very good. Very firm and very white meat, in the waters where I live (northern manitoba). We catch them in deep water at the end of ice fishing season. They move up onto mid lake humps to spawn and the action can be unbelievable, my wife and I caught and released 50 in an hour last year. It was a blast. Our average size is 6 lbs and we regularly get a 10 lb'er. To clean: -cut slit in skin all the way around the back of the head -peel off skin with pliers (some guys nail head onto a baord to hold it) -take off backstraps like you would a deer. - Tail meat is o.k. when it is fresh, but not after it is frozen. -fry up battered in beer and flour, -very tasty. It does not freeze as well as other fish, so we only eat it when we catch if fresh."
1403143,Ashman,2012-03-05 13:49:00,106,"I caught this one last year ice fishing in Michigans U.P.Cleaned it, cut it up in chunks, boiled it in sugar water and dipped the pieces in butter.....we call it poor man's lobster.My wife even liked it and she isn't one to try anything outside the ""norm""....I just didn't show her what it looked like before it was cooked.....she would have never tried it."
1403528,scgibby11,2012-03-06 10:46:00,109,"I do a lot of diving in the Great Lakes. We see burbots at most any depth, but they are particularly found of structure (wrecks) that is deep and cold, especially in the summer.They will hole up in crevices on a wreck almost like a moray eel does. Often, you can grab these buggers with your hands when they are in the right location. They can swim fast when they want to, but usually they hole up and just lay there until you really bug them.Scott"
1400431,bigwalleye1,2012-02-28 17:00:00,2632,Finally a worthwhile use for lawyers. They're all pretty slimey in my area.....
1400480,Skywagon,2012-02-28 18:31:00,1106,"Here is a 10 pounder I caught through the ice in 2010. We cooked it up as poor man's lobster and dipped it in butter, it was very good.http://i1178.photobucket.com/albums/...bling005-2.jpg"
1400520,jkonop,2012-02-28 19:57:00,544,"Cut one up and fried one once, not bad, but there are other fish I prefer...They have been dumped back in the lake ever time since the 1st trial run."
1400523,Fish-er-man,2012-02-28 20:00:00,322,I have never cleaned one but the owner of Angle Inn Lodge on Lake of the Woods prepared some for us one night as an appetizer and it was very good. Cut the white meat from the fish into small pieces and deep fried with bread crumbs. This was in the winter also and I would of ate a meals worth if I would of been able to. Fish was fresh and very good.
1400592,davenathe,2012-02-28 21:47:00,113,Cannot believe no one has brought up the greatest recipe ever for eelpot 6 pack beer 1 eel pot wrapped in plastic 1 hole dug about 3 feet deep Directions Crack a beer and enjoy. Roll eelpot out of plastic wrapping without touching into hole. Cover up with dirt. Drink 5 remaining beer.
1400762,stevensinks,2012-02-29 10:12:00,330,One group brought some in last year. The lodge owner fixed them for lunch and we got to try it. I thought it was very good.
1400811,Guest,2012-02-29 11:58:00,0,very popular here in wisconsin. known as freshwater lobster. must be handled and prepared properly and served with butter tastes alot like lobster.
1400906,Freytown,2012-02-29 14:39:00,770,"Burbot is a freshwater species...Ling a saltwater.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burbothttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_lingI have caught burbot in the Gouin reservoir in Quebec but never ate any. The first one was caught on a small jig tipped with a worm in about 30 fow. It was about 13inches & I held it in the water trying to figure out what I caught.Well a northern pike came exploding out of the depths, grabbed the burbot & a good battled began. The pike was a 40 incher & won't let go. When I tried to net the pike it let go but stayed near the surface for a while. HA, ha pike seem to like them."
1400931,johnboat,2012-02-29 15:12:00,2014,Putting one of those in your livewell is a one time deal. They make a Pike's hygene look good.
1400991,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-02-29 16:52:00,235,"The way they contort their bodies like snakes is nasty. You can look at all of nature to see how remarkable evolution and adaptations are, but I swear some of the stuff in the water is the most crazy and fascinating. Salt water creatures is this times 1,000."
1400264,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-02-28 12:03:00,235,"Have caught a couple these on fly in lakes, mostly small ones. I understand they are good eating. Are you allowed to eat them? Has anyone ever done this?"
1400280,Mike Kansas,2012-02-28 12:25:00,1463,"Yes, but I only feed them to the other guys on the trip."
1400332,FrankLeigh,2012-02-28 13:48:00,80,"These fish have a number of names, and are widely distributed in Ontario. We always used to call them ling. They are a freshwater cod,We have caught them many times, through the ice, fishing deep water for lake trout and whitefish. There was one time that we decided to try one, so we built a fire on shore and roasted our fish over the fire. While it was edible, it was quite oily, like some ocean fish. The consensus was that it needed salt and a lot more beer. lol"
1400334,2746,2012-02-28 13:54:00,3206,"on our vacation travels in Michigan (upper pen.) we would see them advertised at some resturantes and bars and I think there they called them lawyers. Usually they were advertising a ""feed"" although we never tried any. Maybe someone from that neck of the woods could verify."
1400357,sault eyes,2012-02-28 14:24:00,268,"I like the backstraps. The tail is usually full of dark meat. The loins are very tasty. They are a fresh water cod. Great beer battered. Here they are called Ling, Lush or Burbot. We get some big ones inland here upto 6 or 8lbs. If it is over cooked it can get rubbery. Another good way to cook the loins is to cut them in cubes and wrap them in bacon. You can pan fry them or BBQ it."
1400384,Guest,2012-02-28 15:18:00,0,There just way to ugly to eat can't get there cute face out of my mind The only way I'd have to eat one is if i was in a plane wreck in the desert and thankfully there not that abudant in the desert
1400397,Wade B AKA: Ruger2506,2012-02-28 15:35:00,5533,"Eat them? Not on purpose. Actually they are very good. You just have to get past the stink and the slime when cleaning them. There is a reason they are called the ""poor mans lobster""."
1400402,NMG,2012-02-28 15:38:00,1053,"Yup! We used to catch them back home in BC. They are a freshwater cod and you can cook them like you would cod. We used to fillet them and deep fry in batter or pan fry in bread crumbs. Very tasty when cooked fresh. These fish would have normally eaten kokanee, which are landlocked Sockeye Salmon. I'm sure that would impact the flavour a bit. The average size we would catch was 4-6 pounds but I did catch one that was around 12 while fishing for Lake Trout. Some of the lakes north of where I'm from they would catch them ice fishing in the mid to high 20's, which is HUGE for a burbot. Those fish were well over 40 inches long and had major girth, courtesy of the local whitefish population no doubt, LOL."
1400403,JayM5209,2012-02-28 15:45:00,1050,"Here's an article about a possible MN state record burbot, from yesterday's Star Tribune.http://www.startribune.com/sports/ou...40403433.html#"
1400414,Mark R,2012-02-28 16:03:00,1538,There is an eelpout festivale every year in Walker Mn quite a celebration. I tried deep fried pout once at the festival. It was OK I would eat them out of ice cold water but caught during the summer I'm not so sure.
