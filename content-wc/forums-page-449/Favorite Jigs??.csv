1403638,btmbncr,2012-03-06 15:08:00,492,I got some some short shank Erie style jigheads from Gary at the Evergreen when I was fishing Lac Seul last time.They were great.Found some in Dakota Tackle in Bismarck and stocked up.I also found some ball head jigs in gold and silver(chrome plate) that I like for fishing with plastics.
1403662,LLewellin,2012-03-06 15:39:00,1790,X2222222! I know my hook setting percentage went way up using the odd ball jig. Love them. Matter a fact just placed an order for about 200 jigs 4 days ago and they are already at me door

1404000,johnboat,2012-03-07 12:15:00,2014,"That Cabeala's short shank, wide gap, red hook was discontinued last year. I called all stores in the country and bought what they had. (3/8ths) chartruse/yellow. VERY glad they are back. favorite all time jig, ever, ever!"
1404007,johnboat,2012-03-07 12:31:00,2014,"That wasn't the jig. The one they discontued was that same thing except with a small silver colorado ""dangly"" hanging from the bottom. Killer Jig. Now I have to buy the northland and retro fit them my self."

1403351,BenBeattie,2012-03-05 21:28:00,232,I like the new Lindy Jigs with the 3D eyes that kind of pop out a bit. Also no paint in the line tie... ever! Glow and Chart. are the only colors you'll ever need on lac Seul.
1403361,1shooter,2012-03-05 21:56:00,1493,I have been using the Northland fireballs or the cabelas short shank jigs:http://www.northlandtackle.com/Categ...?cat=59&pc=490http://www.cabelas.com/product/Fishi...3Bcat104544180 But last year I found these and love them.

1403364,JayM5209,2012-03-05 22:10:00,1050,"Larry Mac and Fishincrazy,I frequently use Roadrunners, from opener through the entire season. And when I have one of those days where I've tried everything in the arsenal and nothing's worked, I'll tie one on (a Roadrunner!!) for sure. I use them two ways: 1) casting the jig and retrieving it just fast enough to keep it off the bottom or the structure, occasionally allowing it to bump bottom or even to sit briefly on bottom; and 2) back trolling very slowly or forward trolling with the TM, again, slowly.I will use a plain Roadrunner with a plastic tail - whatever color works that day on that lake - and half a crawler. Or, almost as frequently, I'll use one with the chenille body . In this case I trim the chenille so it's only as long as the bend of the hook and add the half crawler but without the plastic. If slow trolling I'll go up to a 1/4 oz. or 3/8 oz. size, but for casting/retrieving I usually stick to a 1/8 oz.Also, if I run into the jumbo perch I'll tie a 1/16 oz. yellow or chartruese Roadrunner on an ultralite rod. No plastic, just a 1"" piece of crawler, and the fun is on!Three years ago my son and I did a mid-August trip to NW Ontario. It was screaming hot and almost windless most of the week and the fish were really turned off. Live bait and cranks just weren't doing it. We finally discovered a way to catch walleyes - a Roadrunner tipped with a Cabela's Action Tail Shad, 2"" size in the Reel Shad color. With those we caught walleyes from deep up to 2' of water in thick weeds. The Roadrunners saved the week.Hope this helps. Good luck when you experiment with it."

1403449,back357,2012-03-06 07:39:00,106,"I have tried a significant number of jigs, and I think all of the posts so far have given some great recommendations, but my absolute go to jig is the Whistler Jig from Northland in either glow, gold, silver or chartruese (depending on water). I have used various sizes depending on how deep you need to go. You can pitch them and work them back slow in the early season. You can also cast out and crank them back a bit faster in the summer for more action. The spinning propeller blade really seems to trigger the strikes. I have tipped it with everything from minnows to gulp to leeches to worms. If you haven't tried them, give it a shot. You can find them pretty much anywhere (Cabela's, Bass Pro, Northland website)."

Very similar to the roadrunner, I like that they have the hammered gold blades and come in a great variety of sizes.Quote: Originally Posted by JayM5209Larry Mac and Fishincrazy, I frequently use Roadrunners, from opener through the entire season.

Really nice explanation on how you fish them. I think that I first really got into using Roadrunners when Blakemore was calling them Branson Bugs. At least that was the body on the roadrunners then. I fish them the same as you describe, slow and on the bottom. I have experimented with many different plastics. Gulp 3"" grubs and minnows are productive as well as straight meat. Mosttimes I'll tip with a leach when using a plastic body or thread a half a crawler when bare. I plan on making a batch of salted minnows to try this year. I think that I use Roadrunners probably 90% of the time when jig fishing on my Canadian lake. I use Fuzzy grubs for the other 10%."
1403519,wallydave,2012-03-06 10:24:00,2151,"Pikeslayer, last year in June we had some crazy weather, winds and front changing daily. The Walleye weapon jigs with the blade seemed to work when the fish were not biting. We were fishing in some current, and when I got the angle right the thumping of the blade seemed to bring in the active fish. I have a few more bladed types to try for this years trip!"
1403524,fishron,2012-03-06 10:37:00,317,"I like roadrunners and whistlers as others have stated. Tipped with two inches of nightcrawler they are hard to beat.A trick I've learned over the years pertains to slow trolling a whistler. If the walleye are a bit reluctant, try sweeping the jig, thereby making the prop spin wildly and increasing the sound/vibration.The trick is to not let your buddy know what you are doing. When this method works it far outfishes a standard twitch."

I cannot wait to try something ""New"" on our ""Canadian Wilderness Adventures"" I have been fishing walleye for a lot of years and pride myself on traveling light (Canada) so for something to make it into my box is a big thing. Blakemore Road Runners have made it on the next trip. Thank you againLarry Mac"

I also tried some Captain Redbeard walleye weapons jigs. They have a small blade and they were the most productive jigs I used, pink and gold were the best colors for these jigs. We were at the NW end of Lac Seul fishing stained waters. What works for your fishing pleasure?"
