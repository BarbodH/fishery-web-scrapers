1402079,eyeman_1,2012-03-03 03:27:00,690,We honeymooned on LOTW at Wiley Point Lodge. Great week of fishing and relaxing!... Of course it was also nice when we got married at Marblehead Lighthouse the first week of May and me and the boys spent the rest of the week on South Bass Island fishing... I am blessed that she puts up with my disease.
1402320,btmbncr,2012-03-03 15:12:00,492,"Pikeslayer thanks for the suggestion.I showed Lucy,my fiancee, the place you suggested and we're going to stay there.Thanks.Bill"
1402367,Pikeslayer8,2012-03-03 18:14:00,1460,"Another thing nice about staying at the Rondezvous is their in house restaurant. Best in town! Several years ago my group was sitting down for our traditional night-before fly-in feast. The waitress came around to take everyone's order and when it was my bil's turn he orders the con pollo very properly. This completely stumped the waitress and finally he had to point to it on the menu. Oh, the con pollo (con rhymes with ron, pollo rhymes with rollo) she exclaimed, would you like chicken with that? I think we laughed so hard we fell out of our seats."
1402772,bkwalker,2012-03-04 16:27:00,1,My wife and I got married on the Wabaskang two years ago in a small but beautiful ceremony. It took 6 months and a ton of paperwork from the Canadian government but it was all worth it. I hired a local Pastor from Dryden to perform the ceremony. His wife joined us along with Tom and Margy from Sleepy Dog. I guarantee I have the most beautiful wedding pictures you have ever seen.

When we got married, the minister commented that it was the first time that he had a truck with a boat trailer parked in front of the church for a wedding."
1401809,wallydave,2012-03-02 11:56:00,2151,Sounds like you have the catch of your life! Andrea will put you on the fish! Where are you crossing the Border? Our group crosses Friday nights and we stay in Fort Frances before heading up the 502. Good luck!
1401863,Mike Borger,2012-03-02 14:20:00,1554,"Ironically (or maybe not so much) I proposed to my wife while on a fly in trip. Didn't think I'd be nervous but I was and when the wind blew us deep into a weedy back bay right when I was going to pop the question I became tongue tied.My girlfriend/wife got mad at me for getting us stuck, she couldn't figure out why I wasn't doing anything and that didn't help matters for me LOL!The first week of our honeymoon was also spent at a single cabin fly in outpost camp. We were home for 2 days then flew down to the Dominican for a week.The best of both worlds. (That tends to keep the wife happy btw) I envy you guys. Enjoy your time together and have a great trip.Lord knows the dreary mundane day to day existence of mortgages, bills and more added responsibilities will come soon enough."
1401867,LOW1,2012-03-02 14:27:00,2828,"When I was growing up in rural Iowa we had a tradition of sneaking over to the newly wedded couple's home in the middle of the night and generally raising cain. There was a German word for this, chivalree (sp?) or something like that. Maybe if btmbncr gives us directions to where they will be at we could go pay them a visit or two."
1401902,btmbncr,2012-03-02 16:10:00,492,Low1 We'll be in Cabin 4.
1401905,btmbncr,2012-03-02 16:15:00,492,Wallydave We'll probably cross the border at International Falls.I'm looking for a place to stay on the way up.Bill
1401915,wallydave,2012-03-02 16:42:00,2151,"http://www.rainbowmotel.ca/ We have stayed at the Rainbow, last couple of trips. It is small, quiet, the room we had last year was freshly renovated, very nice and clean. Ask Gord for a nice room and hopefully he'll have one of the nicer ones! If memory serves me, Cabin 4 at Goose Bay is one of the smaller ones, just right for a couple! I have been staying with Andrea since the late 90's. She runs a good camp and she has been renewing the cabins and docks. Ask for the boat upgrade! Very nice to fish out of! Stop at Dutchies on the way north from Vermillion Bay, nice folks from Iowa living their dream!"
1401920,Pikeslayer8,2012-03-02 16:59:00,1460,"Come on Wallydave, first night on their honeymoon and you suggest the Rainbow? Btmbncr, call now and get reservations at the Rondezvous. Ask specifically for lakeside room preferably on lower level. I had my honeymoon 21years ago on Shikag. Great way to start off a marriage.http://rendezvoushotel.com/"
1401983,wallydave,2012-03-02 19:03:00,2151,So your saying I need to work on my wedding planner skills???
1401988,Pikeslayer8,2012-03-02 19:14:00,1460,Lol. Maybe. But you are real good at promoting Canadian fishing at Goose Bay Lodge!
1402066,castnblast,2012-03-02 23:47:00,111,"A family that fishes together stays together. I was married on a cliff above the ""the Sea Lion"" on the north shore of lake superior to an amazing woman who loves the outdoors almost as much as I do. Sounds like you've found a soulmate! Best wishes to you!"
1401647,btmbncr,2012-03-02 06:04:00,492,I booked a cabin at Goose Bay for the first 2 weeks of August yesterday for my/our Honeymoon.My fiancee loves walleye fishing and has never been to Canada fishing.I suggested the Lac Seul trip and she got excited about the idea.I called Andrea and made the reservations.I wanted to go when the fish were more likely to be schooled up on main lake structure.Hopefully we will get in on ripe blueberries at that time also.My fiancee keeps telling me how excited she is about the trip.
1401656,Larry Mac,2012-03-02 06:32:00,530,"Hi btmbncr, Congratulations!!! What a great honeymoon, have a wonderful tripThank you,Larry Mac"
1401660,HeHooksHimself,2012-03-02 06:44:00,725,Does you fiancee have any sisters? You are a lucky man!
1401663,micropterus,2012-03-02 06:49:00,450,Sounds like my wife of 48 years
1401664,Larry Mac,2012-03-02 06:49:00,530,lol
1401672,TIGHTLINER,2012-03-02 07:15:00,223,THIS POST BRINGS BACK LOTS OF GOOD MEMORIES. WHEN MY WIFE AND I WERE MARRIED I BOOKED A CABIN IN NORTHERN MICHIGAN FOR A HONEYMOON. SHE HAD JUST FINISHED NURSING SCHOOL AND HAD STATE BOARDS TO STUDY FOR. WE WERE GONE 9 DAYS AND IT RAINED 8 OF THEM HOWEVER I STILL MANAGED TO FISH DAILY. AFTER 44 YEARS OF MARRIAGE SHE TELLS ME NOW THAT I SHOULD GO FOR 2 WEEKS AT A TIME 1 WEEK IS NOT ENOUGH. OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS I HAVE BEEN GONE ON OUR WEDDING DATE AND HER BIRTHEDAY AND ONCE AGAIN IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN THIS YEAR. REMEMBER IF YOU ARGUE LET IT BE OVER A LURE AND REMEMBER YOU ARE ONLY RIGHT 10% OF THE TIME. BEST WISHES TO YOU AND YOUR FUTURE WIFE.
1401749,LOW1,2012-03-02 09:46:00,2828,And its best to remain silent during that 10%.
1401751,Larry S,2012-03-02 09:49:00,665,"Will also be leaving for Canada the day before our anniversary. The wife is very understanding,I will have to take her out to dinner the night before I leave"
1401753,TIGHTLINER,2012-03-02 09:52:00,223,LOW 1......... I WILL DRINK TO THAT I CAN TELL U BEEN MARRIED AWHILE.
1401783,LOW1,2012-03-02 10:50:00,2828,Yessir. 20+ years and five kids worth. It's a good thing. But I didn't have the nerve to suggest or even think about suggesting that we go fishing on the honeymoon.
