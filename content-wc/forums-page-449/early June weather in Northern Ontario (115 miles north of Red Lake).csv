1400933,Larry Mac,2012-02-29 15:13:00,530,"Hi Jared, you are going to a great area at a peak fishing time. You will have a ball. Be prepared and have a great time.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1404230,The Canuck,2012-03-08 10:40:00,67,"Been a very mild winter up here this year, supposed to go up to 8c by Monday. We just had a dump of snow but before that not much snow at all. The weather change from here in Red Lake to 115 air miles north can be drastic, no snow on the ground and no ice here to still inches of snow to 10"" of ice on the lake up there. I think we are expecting an early to normal break-up due to the higher than normal temps. (I hope I didn't jinks anyone I knocked on wood)LOL"
1400649,Jball,2012-02-29 06:59:00,23,"Does anyone have experience fishing that far north in early to mid June? My group is heading up there to Viking Outposts and we are curious how the weather might be that time of year. I understand it could vary drastically but the outfitter told me last year they had 5 inches of snow the first week of June. I'm hoping that was an outlier and this year will be warmer. What do you guys think? We are staying at Critchell Lake near Lake Mcinnes which is 115 miles north of Red Lake. Thanks, Jared"
1400669,Larry S,2012-02-29 07:31:00,665,"I have seen very cold weather with snow in early June,also scorchingly hot weather. As you said Jared the weather can vary quite a bit. Bring layers of clothes and good rain gear. Be prepared for anything."
1400686,wallydave,2012-02-29 08:08:00,2151,"Anything can happen with the weather in June! Last year first week of June, it was in the 100's back home on Illinois, it was 43 cloudy and windy near Ear Falls! One year we went from shorts and t-shirts in the afternoon, to bundled up with everything I packed! Amen on the layers and rain gear!"
1400693,EddieNorth,2012-02-29 08:14:00,32,"You never know what your going to get. Up on the Attawapiskat where we are we can have it 100 degree sunny days or snowing like crazy.Just dress for the worst,im sure you will have a great trip and the fishing should be fantastic that far North.Cheers,Eddie"
1400708,northernbite,2012-02-29 08:38:00,1186,"One day it was 95 and we showered off of our out door shower on the camper and one week later it was 36 and snowing. Bring sun block and long johns and you will have it covered along with a good set of rain gear.good luck fishing,Paul"
1400709,MarkG,2012-02-29 08:38:00,3109,"No crystal ball...But Going that far north at that time ,you are inviting high probability of some cold unstable weather. So just be prepared for anything ! But heck,,,you almost have to do that even in Northern Minnesota in early June. So don't worry about it. Resign to pack for anything, and go have a great time. Otherwise just change your destination to Ky. Lake ,or Dale Hollow Tennessee and bring LOTS of sunscreen !"
1400757,stevensinks,2012-02-29 10:04:00,330,One year we went to Red Lake the first week of June. We had cold rain all but one afternoon and the walleye were all big.
1400814,Golden Eagle,2012-02-29 11:59:00,2642,"Beginning in 1984 I've fished NW Ontario every May by being there the third Saturday in May and several times I've hit it the second Saturday in May and stayed 2 or 3 weeks. Weather is not a consideration. I just do it. And it works. I'm there during a time of change and it works for me, every time.Check the 10 day weather forecast if you're going for only 1 week. Also check a few hundred miles to the west and to the north of your fishing location."
1400821,Sanderv,2012-02-29 12:10:00,63,"I go up there. Last year it was warm, sunny and beautiful while back home it was cool and cloudy. But some years it's been cold, sleeting and in the low 30s.Bring along 1 warm coat for underneath the rain outer layer."
1400856,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-02-29 13:07:00,235,Are there greyling that far north?
