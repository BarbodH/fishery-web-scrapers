The other thing I do after spooling, I have my wife or son hold the rod and walk out about 60 yds with the line. I then reel it back under pressure. Or, you can drag it behing the boat with nothing on it and that will take the memory out as well. This was I preferred tactic for saltwater reels back in the day. Good Luck and Tight Lines."
1399160,drlee,2012-02-25 18:25:00,409,"I spend most of my time fishing with either 4 or 6 lb test for walleyes. Typically, I use the 4 lb for jigging with a 3/8 or 1/4 oz lead head jig, tipped with a minnow or part of a crawler. When I troll a little joe, I tip with a minnow or crawler and use the 6 lb test. All is fine until I have jigged for awhile (very little casting...just drifting), then I start having a lot of trouble with line twist, as in, very bad line twist. I end up having to rip off a lot of line and sort of start over. I have tried dragging the line behind the boat with nothing on the end...works sometimes and for awhile. Also will lift my jig out of the water and let the line spin until it stops. Again, works sometimes and for awhile. Any other tricks? Line type recommendations? I use Berkley mono. I usually put my line on the reel myself...any tricks I may not know about? Thanks in advance for any helpful thoughts!"
1399173,Chad,2012-02-25 19:20:00,3523,try using a super line. Bionic Walleye Braid or Fireline If you want to stay with mono you could try adding a swivel about 2' above of your jig.
1399176,Ia Walihntr,2012-02-25 19:27:00,320,"You are obviously using a spinning reel. When you spool up, lay your spool on the floor and reel it on. You may have to flip the spool over occasionally if line stars to twist. Good idea to put a swivel on your line a foot or 2 up the line when jigging. If lindy rigging, atttach a swivel or snap swivel to the end of your line before you add the spinner rig. Another choice is to use braided or fused line. They do not twist as easily as mono. Marv Guess we were posting at the same time. We're on the same page."
1399181,Limeyangler,2012-02-25 19:36:00,563,"I suggest using braid and the microswivel connecting a good 12lb flourocarbon leader. Way more sensitivity for bite detection, more stealth with the flourocarbon and way less if any line twist with the swivel."
1399182,fishincrazy,2012-02-25 19:36:00,1282,When I get a bad twist in my line I attach the biggest swivel in my box to my line.I then find a place I can secure the swivel and walkmy line out to the spool.Then I reel in under pressure.Do this 3-4 times it spins the line out and you can use it again for a little while.I would use a swivel 2' up like the others said.Or I would switch to braid.I like Suffix Performance braid and fire line.You can also if on a boat cut everything off your line go ahead slowly out feed out your line till almost at the end then just reel it in under pressure do this 3-4 times the twist should come out.these are only temporary fixes.But the will work.FC
1399276,Hawker,2012-02-26 05:33:00,3967,"I made the switch long ago to Fireline (fused) on all my spinning reels and have never once looked back to mono. Braids, though near excellent choices as well, will still twist, but nowhere near like mono! Should you choose to opt for the swivel route, be sure to use a quality ball bearing swivel versus a barrel swivel, they work much much better to help reduce line twist!"
1399315,Thumpr50,2012-02-26 07:22:00,139,"another vote for switching to braided (fireline, powerpro-I use both and like both) and adding a swivel with 20-24 inches of fluorocarbon. swivel eliminates line twist, flouro leader offers lower visibility. Tried this last yr fishing walleyes on LOTW Big Narrows area-very clear water-and outfished others in the boat 3 to 1."
