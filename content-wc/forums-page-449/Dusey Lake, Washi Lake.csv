1403388,Mike Borger,2012-03-06 03:43:00,1554,"I'm finding this somewhat ironic. After being unable to procure a suitable date with Eddie for a spring trip this year I was searching for alternatives.(he's pretty solidly booked)This post mentioning Dusey Lake piqued my interest because as mentioned I paddled the Dusey many years ago and experienced some pretty good brook trout fishing.I never really fished Dusey Lake, just blasted right through it and have no lasting memories of it, but I firmly believe the potential is there for great fishing.Last night after a long conversation with Brad Slagel owner of Seven Lakes in Nakina I booked his Dusey Lake camp for June 2nd of this year LOL!Seems the camp hasn't been fished much in recent years. As well Brad has cut trails around rapids both upstream and down of the lake where he has boats cached allowing access to miles of previously unfished trout water.I'm definitely stoked.I'll be looking forward to filling you guys in after the fact, should be a great trip! You never know maybe one day.

1403506,adempsey,2012-03-06 09:57:00,963,"I just remembered that Timberidge Outposts sold their outposts to Twin Lakes Outfitters, but not the Dusey outpost. Do you know if the Seven Lakes outpost was owned by Timberidge previously? Just curious."
1403534,Mike Borger,2012-03-06 10:58:00,1554,There were actually two outposts on Dusey Lake. Seven Lakes recently aquired both of them so it stands to reason that one of them was the former Timberidge camp.Brad apparantly aquired the other one to ensure his guests have a single cabin experience. From what he said the 2nd camp was all run down and in a state of disrepair.
1403577,adempsey,2012-03-06 12:36:00,963,"Thanks for the info, much appreciated. Looking forward to your report from Dusey and Seven Lakes. Hope you guys have a good time!"
1403602,Guest,2012-03-06 14:01:00,0,"Solopaddler: I'm glad to hear that you were impressed with Dusey and booked a trip. I spoke with Eddie, and the logistics for that trip just won't work for me. So I'm planning to book Dusey. I expect a great trip, and hoping for some big fish potential to top it off. I'd really like to hear how it goes for you in June. Would you mind dropping me an email so we can stay in touch? My address is johnnesse(at)hotmail(dot)com Thanks!"
1404271,gmattbruin,2012-03-08 11:39:00,174,"Several yrs ago TLO had cabins on both these lakes. We never got to fish Dusey but we did fish Washi and it is an outstanding lake to fish. Lots of and size. this lake also holds some great size pickerel. Cant really say what we used as that can change from week to week,season to season, but had amazing fishing everyday. our cabin was at the far east end on the north side and we wld fish the channel between the 2 bodies of water, and also went to the far westend in a bay a couple times with 3 boats trolling 1 day and for 2-3hrs straight each boat had double headers with pickerel. 1 of the best lakes we ever fished up there. glenn m"
1400890,Guest,2012-02-29 13:59:00,0,"I'm looking at a fly-in trip for this summer. Important to me are two things: 1) only group on the lake; and, 2) big fish possible. Has anyone here been on Dusey Lake or Washi Lake out of Nakina? Any other suggestions? Thanks!"
1400976,Mike Borger,2012-02-29 16:21:00,1554,"There's so many great single cabin outposts north of Nakina and Armstrong.A few of my favourites in no particular order:Peninsular Lake (Big body of water with quality fish) http://www.aralakecamp.com/peninsular.aspRichter Lake with Eddie North (newly opened, mostly unexplored and literally teeming with fish)http://www.eddienorth.com/Muskrat Lake with Leuenberger's (again, good sized lake with quality fish)http://www.leuenberger.ca/muskrat.htmlWeese or Vick Lake with Mattice Lake Outfitters (super quality camps and great fishing)http://www.walleye.ca/There's so many more than that, but it's a start.As far as the ones you mentioned I've stayed at the Washi Camp and had a fantastic trip. Beyond the great fishing in both basins of the lake you can navigate a long way both upstream and down on the Albany river.Great if you like to explore.The delta where the Albany flowed into Washi was insanely good for walleye.I can't comment directly on the Dusey outpost, but I have paddled the Dusey river.I believe it would be a great camp to visit, BUT only in the higher waters of spring. I think in the summer it's way too low to be super productive.It is a great spot if you'd like to catch a few brook trout as well as the usual walleye and pike."
1400983,adempsey,2012-02-29 16:32:00,963,"There might be two camps on Dusey - Seven Lakes Outposts and Timberidge Air Outposts. They might be the same outpost though and my information dated.Washi lake (I assume Leuenberger Outpost?) is part of the Albany river system. I don't know how likely it would be that you would see other groups, but there are several other outpost camps on that river system about 10 to 12 miles away. Wilderness North has a lodge and outpost on Makokibatan to the south and Seven Lakes Outposts (Teabeau) and AMS Outposts (Caviar) each have an outpost to the east.I have never been to any of these outposts and it could be very difficult or perhaps impossible to traverse the water between the outposts. So, the point may be moot. Also, I am basing all of these comments on a map I put together for my own purposes, which in all likelihood contains errors (outposts cane be hard to locate). Double check this information if you feel it is important.Good luck with your search!"
1400989,Mike Borger,2012-02-29 16:49:00,1554,"Definitely a moot point. It's possible but highly unlikely you'd see someone from Makokibaten. It's a long way and there's some pretty hairy rapids to navigate.I've seen the local natives, the Baxters do it at full speed without blinking an eye. Probably could do it blind folded LOL! The average Joe wouldn't get more than a mile or two before turning back.Downstream of Washi there's a couple of impassable rapids separating it from the next camp downstream. Of course anything is possible with a bit of sweat...you can hop out and push/pull/drag a boat through almost anything, but very people would ever bother."
1400994,Mike Borger,2012-02-29 16:56:00,1554,"Should also mention, I was talking to eddienorth recently attempting to pin something down for this year. I really want to get my kid up there to experience the trophy pike fishing.Anyhow he told me he had a recent cancellation for mid July which unfortunately doesn't work for me.With a party of 6 guys I was told I could have the entire camp to myself.Pretty sure he'd extend the offer to anyone."
1400995,adempsey,2012-02-29 16:59:00,963,"Ya, that's what I imagined. Wish I had all of your first hand experience to share. Time to write that book! The Hines-Herringer-Jensen Northern Ontario Fishing Guide is in need of an update, don't ya think!??!"

1401049,dog2,2012-02-29 19:12:00,198,"our group fished it about 8years back.good pike and walleye,no monsters,but plenttty of fish . the river was good for pike with the weed edges holding walleye.one afternoon we fished the west end of the lake two boats drifting with the wind we fished for over 2 hours casting daredevils and johnsons catching a pike of some size from 18inches to 32inches on about every cast. the rapids hold brookies and plenty of walleyes.on anice afternoon you can drift the current and pick off walleyes on jigs and twistertails flo green ,white, yellow flo orange.We even broke down and dragged some rapalas around on the main lake [ actually it's more of a wider spot on the river], just hang on to the rod there are some big pike in there,also sturgeon. The year we were there high winds and at least 2 small tornadoes ,but that is another story . good place to get 100 fish in a day."
1401275,Guest,2012-03-01 10:34:00,0,"Thanks a bunch for the replies. I fished Makokibitan last year. I'd ideally like to be on a little smaller lake, and/or one with fewer people. I even did a trip with a native guide on the river, which was a fun experience but not the best part of the trip. I can say that it would be somewhere between difficult and impossible for a mere mortal to navigate a boat from Makok to Washi. One thing I did like about Makok was the size of the fish, but we suffered for numbers a bit, probably because of the mayfly hatch. I should have checked the shallow bays for fish, but we did pretty well overall regardless. It sounds like Dusey and Washi might not be the best bet if we want a shot at big fish. Does that sound about right?"
1401353,Mike Borger,2012-03-01 13:14:00,1554,"I would say there's always the potential for larger fish at any of the camps north of nakina, but yeah, it's likely more of a numbers fishery.Not trying to beat a dead horse here, but Eddie's camp on the Attawapiskat River is the best trophy pike and walleye fishing I've ever experienced. If trophy fish are important to you you may want to check him out."
