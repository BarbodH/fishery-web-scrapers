We would like to find something 4 hours or less away from Toronto to fish. Because of gas prices we are not going to haul our boat, but rather use the camps boat. Car clearance roads only. The 2 camps we have found that fit what we are looking for are the following: Taggart Bay Lodge and Camps Ronoda. Any reviews on these 2? Any other suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks"

Not familiar with Camps Ronoda.You might consider the lodges on Lady Evelyn Lake as well, if you don't mind a boat-to camp. However, it's about 6 hours from Toronto, but worth the extra drive."

At this time, I'd like to go back as I had some memorable weeks of fishing, especially the pike. I do not know anything about the current camp owner. there is another camp, just past Camps Ronoda that looked decent (online):http://www.pourvoirie-cabinesdulong.com/chalets_en.htmlThe bottom line on Lac Remigny: fertile, natural lake, plenty of weld beds, rocky shoals, drop offs, deep holes, with decent fishing between the two camps and a little further where the lake opens up to widest area. With 2 fish camps and some cottages, probably some ice fishing activity, the fishing is decent, not great. We did catch pike til our arms fell off one week of a hot bite. I would not consider it to be fly in quality, but not pressured like a lake within 1 or 2 hours of Toronto. Lac Des Quinze via boat launch around corner from general store in Remigny is generally more remote with vast bays and huge wide open regions, better for walleye."
