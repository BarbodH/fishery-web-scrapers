6739169,Crede,2023-05-16 15:36:00,134,I have always taken 631 thru Hornepayne. But Google Maos will tell you to take 614. So I tried that last June on the way home. Because it seemed like a good idea at the time. It wasn't.
6739233,MrSimon,2023-05-17 07:19:00,922,That is incredibly helpful. Thanks! We always go through Hornepayne too and were considering 614. I'm glad I asked.
6739259,hoppy63,2023-05-17 09:44:00,367,"We took 614 on my first trip some years ago. As I remember it was kind of a neat route if you are in no hurry and if it was legal to enjoy a few Kokanees on the way, but, as already mentioned it is very rough...I think we traveled anywhere from 5-40 mph, mostly on the way lower end and not legal for the Kokanees! I had heard it was hit or miss on conditions of road but it is hard for me to believe they are ever pristine! Ever since it's been Hornepayne."
6739305,10lbeye,2023-05-17 12:59:00,61,"631 all the way. It is a lovely, scenic drive from White River to HWY 11. It's my favorite leg of the trip from Wawa to Nakina."
6739327,kzoofisher,2023-05-17 15:47:00,5144,I don't know if that was a typo but I love it!
6739581,stukkie,2023-05-18 14:20:00,21,"You will be fine but check their F/B page as the above mentioned photo's are old, still ice/no planes and bring your hip waders."
6739803,SJC305,2023-05-20 08:40:00,154,"Definitely take 631. They repaved the culverts a few years ago and the road was fine last year. Just twisty/turny for anyone trying to sleep.Restroom stop at Wawa, food and gas at White River, then a jog up to Hornepayne and onto the pull-off at 11. West on 11 for the next leg and about 1hr 45min to Longlac."
6656196,vteye3,2022-05-15 11:21:00,496,Curious if Cordingly Lake's ice has gone out? We depart for our fly-in in 23 days.
6656198,Eckohlt,2022-05-15 11:26:00,3685,23 days you'll be in like flint.
6656226,Crede,2022-05-15 13:17:00,134,Most of the ice is off Cordingley. Yesterday Leuenberger's posted photos of one of their planes on floats at their dock and then video of the plane flying overhead.
6739003,Dymes,2023-05-15 19:37:00,13,"We leave in 2 weeks and I have no worries. Nakina is in the 50, 60, and 70's the next two weeks. All lakes Leuenberger's fly to will be open by next weekend."
6739075,MrSimon,2023-05-16 08:41:00,922,"Speaking of Nakina, for those guys who drive up through the Sault, do you prefer: Taking 614 through Manitouwadge or Taking 631 through Hornepayne"
6739141,kim n indiana,2023-05-16 12:32:00,62,i was going to take 17 over to 11 and go that way this summer. But i will always welcome suggestions or advice from others.... but first i've got to shepherd 3 newbies on train in trip at end of July. Will be fun tho.
6739143,kim n indiana,2023-05-16 12:38:00,62,related: is 631 pavement or gravel ?
6739147,MrSimon,2023-05-16 12:45:00,922,631 is a nice paved road. No problem for any vehicle or trailer.
6739151,kim n indiana,2023-05-16 13:15:00,62,thanks.... maybe i need to reconsider and go up that way to 11. seems to be shorter...
6739167,kzoofisher,2023-05-16 15:01:00,5144,I took 614 once and the industrial road was not worth the effort. It was gravel if you can call softball sized rocks gravel.
