6738599,Skywagon,2023-05-13 05:49:00,1106,"Below is an clipping I kept about the previous owners of Pine Sunset, a novel could be written about that operation. ""April 26, 2010 Pair Fined $5,000 For Illegal Hunting And Fishing Licences Two Wisconsin residents have been fined a total of $5,000 for illegally possessing Ontario hunting and fishing licences. Mitchell and Sharon Gusick of Pound, Wisconsin, pleaded guilty to having void Ontario Outdoors Cards and making false statements on their applications. Court heard that the Gusicks purchased a tourist camp in the Dryden area in 2000. They were allowed entry into Ontario on a work permit for the camp; however, they do not meet residency requirements defined by the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act. In 2006, conservation officers found Mitch Gusick with an Ontario resident hunting licence and warned him to correct it, as he was not an Ontario resident. In December 2007, Sharon Gusick was found to have upgraded her Outdoors fishing card to an Ontario resident hunting card. In November 2008, conservation officers again caught Mitch Gusick with an Ontario resident Outdoors Card. On November 10, 2008, the Gusicks were advised they did not meet the requirements of Ontario residency for hunting and fishing in Ontario. They were also advised that an investigation in Ontario was underway with the assistance of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources to determine their residency status. Less than three weeks later, both Gusicks renewed their Ontario Outdoors Cards online, claiming resident status. Justice of the Peace Edith Baas heard the case in the Ontario Court of Justice, Dryden, on April 20, 2010. For the purposes of obtaining an Ontario resident hunting and fishing licence, a resident is a person whose primary residence is Ontario, and who has resided in Ontario for a period of six consecutive months during the previous 12 months.
