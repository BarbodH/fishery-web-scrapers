6738529,Eckohlt,2023-05-12 13:50:00,3685,That's a good one for sure!
6740029,bluegill8,2023-05-21 14:38:00,5,Walleyes absolutely love the Berkley Fliker Shad and they are fairly inexpensive. That's my go to and I use no leader.
6738077,Bigtaproot,2023-05-10 10:38:00,900,"Want to expand my expertise to the level of many on this board. Occasionally get tired of jigging and was looking to see if anyone has experience using jerk baits for walleyes on Canadian waters. I like the look of the live target deep diver perch but realize that it might be best for catching fishermen rather than fish. Anyone have experience with jerk baits for walleyes and the live target perch in particular? As always, appreciate all of the brains on this board and i will be sober enough for the next 5 hours to read any responses! Tap"
6738093,Basshawger,2023-05-10 11:22:00,4,"Walleyes will readily take a jerkbait throughout the season. A variety of different brands will work. I usually leave the high dollar stuff like my Megabass collection at home for these trips though. Just be prepared for potential hooks in the hand while on a fly in. Also, the pike will be all over them as well. The use of a leader is a must, though it impedes action a bit. I use the Tieable titanium wire with mine, Knot2Kinky brand. It is pretty thin and doesn’t kill the bait."
6738109,valley366,2023-05-10 12:56:00,193,I found it actually by accident last spring and found it fun. We were working some shallow shoreline rocks for Smallmouth and I was casting a small pink X-rap. The bass were loving it along with Walleyes mixed in. That was early June in cool water. We had a fun afternoon and will definitely be something that try again down the road.
6738151,Iceshack05,2023-05-10 15:49:00,31,"I found it by accident too one time. I was musky fishing opening weekend on Lotw in June a few years ago...I was throwing a baby DepthRaider (5"") along a shoreline trying to catch/locate musky. Well, this one spot had a few boulders, weeds, and I found a school of agressive walleye. Caught a walleye at least every 2nd or 3rd cast. They were averaging in the low 20 inch range. Buddy didnt catch any as he was throwing a bucktail. After about 10 min. we moved down the shoreline and that was it for the walleye. I still regret not spending more time on that one spot!!!"
6738443,hammerdown31,2023-05-12 08:18:00,12,Last year we caught a lot of fish on clown color HUSKY JERK two hook version at lake savant. not sure on the size. I would second the wire leader as they were well mixed with pike. I mostly threw black leaders. didnt seem to make a diff. it also allowed me to swap to crankbaits easily. Caught a lot of fish on a pink and white xrap as well.
6738451,RichA$1970,2023-05-12 08:32:00,1159,I used biggest X-Rap 4-3/4” in hot head color and they work great but use a leader as I’m fishing for pike but the walleye nailed them.
6738465,Mojo-NC,2023-05-12 09:15:00,1929,"Although the X-Rap is an excellent jerk bait for walleyes, it is an awfully expensive lure to likely be demolished by hammer handle pike in short order. I think I would use a Yo Zuri or Rapala Husky Jerk or a Bass Pro Shops similar lookalike bait. I've had quite a few expensive lures destroyed by small pike over the years."
6738491,Eckohlt,2023-05-12 11:49:00,3685,"Small pike destroy anything that gets in there way,there terrorists."
6738495,mms3rd,2023-05-12 12:49:00,148,"My son insists on this bait, while I drag along a minnow or night crawler on a ""Little Joe."" He outfishes me but I think it's because I run the boat and he covers a lot more ground than I do....and hits the spots before I get to them. On either bait, you run the risk of a northern cutting you off....actually, on pretty much any bait without a decent leader. An owner on Eagle persuaded me to go with a suspending Rapala when my catch was slow.....it worked....but I went back to live bait....I'm old."
6738519,Sylvanboat,2023-05-12 13:43:00,94,Gold rapala stick baits are my go-to walleye lure in Ontario.
