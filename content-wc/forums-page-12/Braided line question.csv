6740285,dstemp,2023-05-22 19:49:00,16,Ok I appreciate all the great feedback on braided line and replacing it. The one part. I left out is most of the line seems to come in 150 yard packages. Most of my reels will not take the full roll. So I have a few with maybe 25 yards or little more give or take . It seems to be a waste. I know it could get connected but probably the knot hang up messing up the casting when the knot goes though the guide What have others done just collect them toss it seems to be wasteful open for suggestions
6740327,Eckohlt,2023-05-23 04:52:00,3685,"Fill half your spool with the cheapest crap you can find,then the other half with the good stuff,you don't need a full spool of good line,the two lines tied together will not come into play."
6740355,JDP,2023-05-23 06:45:00,1457,Yep. I have had no problems reversing the line on the spool. Seems to ad a couple of good years to the life of the line.
6740357,prov1800,2023-05-23 06:59:00,5010,I might put 25 yards onto my spinning reels double uni knot.Deepest I go is in winter for lake trout so never run out of braid on the reel.As far as my muskie reels I do same thing but put a bit more braid on.Stuff is strong and lasts forever it changes color a bit but it's still good.
6740537,Hunts1,2023-05-23 18:43:00,123,"If you have 5 days on the line you do not need to change it out. I'd probably cut of 5-10' so that it's fresh. Otherwise this stuff lasts. I do use a flouro leader, about 6' long, tying on with the Lefty Krey knot for braid to mono. I use my line on reels 30 days a year and change out every 3 years or so. Mostly because I've burned off enough that the reel needs reloading or remainder is backer to new line. Best wishes.Mike"
6740639,hammerdown31,2023-05-24 06:55:00,12,I try to purchase the larger spools but I do run into that issue. I will use the small spools as a backer for better or different size braid. on casting reels the knot isnt an issue. just keep it deep enough on the spool that it doesnt show during a cast. but on spinning reels i have had some issues with the line getting hung up on the knot if it is too near the surface. you will just have to experiment with it and see how it works out for you.
6739451,Bill Krejca,2023-05-18 06:10:00,6107,"Braid - the biggest mistake line manufacturers ever made. Instead of anglers replacing mono every? year, the darn stuff lasts forever. I am amused by ad's claiming a ""new and improved"" version most every year, because the stuff they sold last year just won't go away! They found a way to have braid lose its color- coming to a store near you, a new and improved fast dye braid! Kinda tongue in cheek, but not by much!!! Bill"
6739477,lmoore,2023-05-18 07:24:00,40,"Braided line doesn't break down under UV light like mono and flouro do so it's really just usage that eventually wears it out, and it can take a real beating before it needs swapped out. I've got braided line on a couple rods that I use frequently and is 2+ years old. Flourocarbon, on the other hand, gets changed out every year because it breaks down just being along for the ride."
6739495,MrSimon,2023-05-18 08:55:00,922,I use it for years ... clip off 15 feet once per year .... replace flouro leader as needed. I'm loving the yellow Suffix 832 in 10b for Canada.
6739567,Pooch,2023-05-18 12:29:00,4618,"After four years I re-spooled my powerpro baitcasters. I think the line was still fine, but it was a dirty white with all the green dye faded or washed out. I'm happy with four years of use, but I think it will go much longer it not dinged up.Pooch"
6739571,Cutting Edge Official,2023-05-18 12:59:00,242,"False...fluorocarbon is uv resistant! As far as braid, I would say I average about 3 years before changing (with fairly regular usage)....mostly just for my minds comfort, probably....more than out of necessity....I simply pay attention to the condition of the line....braid is pretty tough stuff."
6739579,lmoore,2023-05-18 14:02:00,40,"Maybe it's not the UV light, I don't know the science behind it, but it definitely doesn't hold up to aging like braid does in my experience."
6739667,lionfan19,2023-05-19 06:45:00,41,Like Prov1800 I also flip the braid when it starts to lose color after a couple years. On my pike/musky gear all that casting your doing is confined to the first 50 yards of line so the rest is brand under there.
6739669,hammerdown31,2023-05-19 07:32:00,12,"I have a few saltwater reels that i have had the same braid on for at least ten years. never had a problem breaking it. I have some tuff line that i took off a reel that i wore out and put onto a new reel and it is still going. all my inshore tackle has braid and if i ever get concerned I walk it off in my yard(big yard) and simply reverse the attachment(ie., tie the end I have been fishing back to the spool) wind it back in and you are good to go for a couple more years. you would not believe the hard conditions that i put the braid through and it still hold up. amazing stuff. I use many different brands but power pro is my favorite for my spinning reels. I even use some old 4# braid for coldwater trout fishing. I know some will say that is too long but if I cannot break it why change, and trust me I dont like to loose fish......."
6739671,lionfan19,2023-05-19 07:46:00,41,"Hammer---Thats it, you explained exactly what I was trying to. Just tie it off and walk untill you get to the end then reverse it."
6740019,last chance,2023-05-21 13:10:00,3262,I'm not sure what causes the braid to break down. but if it's being exposed to the sun or the weather I don't really know just how long it will last most of the time only the top couple of wraps get exposure to the sun or weather. unless I'm trolling where you need to have one reel spooled as close to the same as the other reels I really don't understand turning the line around. all that needs to be done is to remove the 2 top layers and be using new line. but this is all just my opinion after using braid for many many years. even now the only reason I change braid is if I cut too much line off the reel or lose it to tangles when running 3 lite bite slide divers off each side where it could cause a problem. good luck to all the people that uses braided line.
6739333,dstemp,2023-05-17 16:06:00,16,"Im just interested on others thought on this. I run 15 # Power Pro braided line fished LOTW last year 5 days . I do not see much as far as any fraying of the line looks as if it was just put on. Would most change it every year. Braid is new to me, Im only asking since I have about 6 reels I take up and its would be costly to reline them . Im just looking for opinions"
6739337,7 Mag,2023-05-17 16:17:00,1887,This is debatable as it really depends on how much use the line has had. I do fish a lot and I change braid every two years but I do strip off about 10’ and re-tie a 6’ leader of fluorocarbon every year. Some probably go longer between changes but I’ve never had an issue in the way I do it.
6739339,Tamarck,2023-05-17 16:20:00,9,"Reuse it. It’s good to go. I go sturgeon fishing (guided) on the Fraser River in BC. Fish in excess of 400# caught every year on the gear. My Guide changes once a year barring fraying, around trees, nicks, etcI use power pro on Muskie gear for two seasons again precluding the above"
6739343,kasmere,2023-05-17 16:25:00,20,Search this board....life expectancy power pro.....Lots of opinions and suggestions. Then you can make your decision on your fishing habits
6739345,kswalleyer,2023-05-17 16:43:00,1651,"my experience.....id keep going with your old braid. I fish braid hard, have used braid a long time and never switched it out. I have even taken it off and respool from other when it gets faded.....I'm not sure I have ever had a fish break off 10-15 lb old braid. try breaking it with your hands and see how that goes on your fingers. anyway just my experience."
6739381,dstemp,2023-05-17 19:46:00,16,Thank you for the suggestions Im planning another trip to LOTW soon and didn't want to have a issue over something simple like line I was hesitant to ask what most use since that can open a whole lot of opinions. But if anyone wants to chime in on there experiences I open to learn
6739401,RichA$1970,2023-05-17 21:16:00,1159,"I keep mine on 2-3 years, the Marketing Gods want to sucker in people to re-spool every year."
6739403,prov1800,2023-05-17 21:19:00,5010,Keep ot on2-4 years than turn it around.Iam on the water almost daily so it holds up good.
6739411,kzoofisher,2023-05-18 02:46:00,5144,"For walleye? Casting you should get 2-3 years out of it before turning it around and getting 2-3 more. This assumes you do get down in rocks and such and fray it up. Vertical jigging you'll get, I don't know, maybe forever out of it. If you haven't torn it up all you need is 20 yards of braid for vertical jigging in Canada and you'll never lose a walleye. When the color fades it turns white and white is easy to see."
6739413,last chance,2023-05-18 04:46:00,3262,"I troll on Erie and have used the same braid for the last 10 or 12 years and never had the 1st problem. in my personal opinion, I don't have any idea just how long it will hold up. if the line gets frayed on the end then I cut it off. if it gets tangled where it loses 50 or more yards then I re-spool. I don't believe 50 yards is enough to change the depth of the lure enough to hurt anything. the line takes a beating trolling with it. so many people change it or turn it around but fading doesn't hurt a thing. I don't see fading has anything to do with getting strikes. and if you use a leader you can even use hi/vis line. as long as your reel has enough line to fish with and hasn't got frayed line I never change it out. but after using the same line for 10 years I have cut the line back enough to change it. a faded line has just lost its color and not its strength."
