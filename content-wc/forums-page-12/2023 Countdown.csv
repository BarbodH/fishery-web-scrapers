6691518,bthomas3333,2022-10-12 17:39:00,465,Dang that is sweet. Midnight Sun - If the water level cooperates you will be ruined from fishing pike anywhere else! Tazan in July is prime time for big Trout! Very Nice! Brett
6691520,bthomas3333,2022-10-12 17:42:00,465,Held back on the other two trips while I get stuff organized. Working towards Taltson or Marshland in July Back to God's River to wear out my shoulder on Lakers and hopefully find a few more Brookies:-) Thanks!
6691546,That Minnesota guy,2022-10-12 19:06:00,8293,If Gord allows it I would like to hit Vermillion Bay Lodge on Eagle at least once next summer.

6691710,danvan18$,2022-10-13 11:25:00,67,Otatakan in June Rod for our group. We'll try to leave some fish for you to catch. Will be the 28th trip with Pickerel Arm Camps- only missed the 2020 covid year. Hoping to go back in the fall as well somewhere- enjoyed the weather and fishing in fall of 2021.
6691718,Eckohlt,2022-10-13 11:49:00,3685,"Leave some fish and some hundred dollar bills in the cabin pls,thanks Dan,"
6691736,bthomas3333,2022-10-13 12:51:00,465,He only has the one lake. It is called Burnett not too far from Misekumaw. Same Cabins / Same Boats / same lake...just some weeks are guided and some are not. Cabins are new. Boats look really good. Picture of Misekumaw / Burnett / Misaw attached. Note there are two Burnetts in SK I believe. This one is furthest north. Misekumaw farthest West. Burnett furthest East. Misaw furthest north in the picture. Brett
6691740,adempsey2.0,2022-10-13 12:57:00,611,"Nice, thanks! The website stated ""2 large bodies of water"", so I assumed 2 different lakes.edit: I think this is it:59.064765, -102.319236I know the place now, I thought it sounded familiar. I thought you can access both Hara and Kingston? Looks like it anyway.Did you consider Misaw Lake Lodge as well?sorry to derail the thread.."
6691750,bthomas3333,2022-10-13 13:56:00,465,Yes. Burnett is a huge watershed. It you look closely there a several lakes connected. I think some might be fly-outs for Hatchett Lake Lodge or Scott. Anyway I would love to have a shot at Burnett. Super good looking water. Brett
