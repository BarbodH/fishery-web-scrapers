6739247,lmoore,2023-05-17 08:20:00,40,"As long as you aren't close to shore, just let the boat drift. Especially with Walleye which typically are going to be staying down and not making big runs out and away from you. I tend to over-control when someone has a decent one on in my boat, especially early on in the trip. I spin us around every which way keeping the line perfectly vertical to whoever is fighting it. Eventually my brother (presumably nearing sea-sickness) tells me not to worry about the boat and keep fishing, he'll tell me when he's ready for the net."
6739263,rknott,2023-05-17 10:09:00,89,"Assiming you don't have a depth finder with GPS built in. If you decide to get one, I simply press enter each time I get a bite and I can always go back to that spot and build a nice plot list. If you don't have that, should be able to do something very similar in your cell phone. Do a test with one of your kids or neighbors walking around the neighborhood. Pretend you get a bite when walking down the street, press a button, keep on waking and see if you can get back to that spot 15 minutes later."
6739613,SweetD,2023-05-18 19:21:00,243,First and foremost lose the net!!! That’s the last thing anyone needs in a boat when trying to land and then release a fish when the wind is howling. I don’t allow in my boat. Nothing but a nuisance IMO. Hand land’em and if you lose one who really cares. There will be more.Good luck
6738497,mms3rd,2023-05-12 12:53:00,148,"Whenever there's a good chop or just good surface wind, I have a heck of a time figuring out how to manage the boat while reeling in the fish. I often have a trolling motor and try to steer with my knee....other times I just slowly back troll out to deep water. I use lighter tackle so I can't just reel the fish straight to the boat. Often end up so far from where the bite was, have no idea where it occurred. Lack good electronics. This came to mind when watching a Youtube video where guy was having same issue. Advice?"
6738523,Eckohlt,2023-05-12 13:47:00,3685,"How big of fish you talking about??if your talking 15 to 19 inch walleyes and you've drifted a 100 yards before you get them in the boat,you better look into a stiffer rod so you can go toe to toe with the fish.My thoughts anyways."
6738527,Ricky Spanish,2023-05-12 13:50:00,1298,Probably obvious but a TM with Spot Lock is worth the investment for multiple reasons.
6738547,prov1800,2023-05-12 14:41:00,5010,As Ricky said a TM with spot lock or even one with a foot control would help.Todays fisherman are spoiled.All the right equipment helps.But you get old guys like me that didn't have it easy in the early days.Guiding from a 12 or 14 ft boat much like most flyout boats.You just learned how to operate a 9.9 or 15 hp.You were always in reverse and knew the right rpm to keep you in that spot close to the marker you threw out in those days and no gps or sonar.You catch a fish on bit of drift motor went in reverse.never ended up far from my marker.
6738549,SweetD,2023-05-12 14:53:00,243,Just relax. Put in neutral and work fish. If need to back troll out a bit do so but my experience has been new boat handlers over-react and spin themselves in circles. Not a criticism just an observation. Most of the time can stay pretty much right on bite if just use your motor and remain relaxed and learn how to multitask without getting swept onto the rocks or out to sea. Good luck
6738559,Eckohlt,2023-05-12 16:29:00,3685,"Giant fish on the end of my line pull me off the spot,they pull those 14 ft boats around like a tornado.lol"
6738603,h8go4s,2023-05-13 05:55:00,1673,Keep a floating marker ready to go within reach and toss it out once the hook is set.
6738751,mms3rd,2023-05-14 08:56:00,148,"Thanks. I like the RELAX idea.....having hit 72, I realize that I fish much the same way I did 50 years ago and never made much in technology upgrades along the way. Now, I only fish with trips to WI, MN or Canada about three times a year and it's to the point of just making do with what I got. Tossing over a marker is certainly a good idea for marking spot......Maybe calm nerves are just best for when the wind wants to blow the boat back over the line."
6738817,lassh,2023-05-14 17:34:00,553,"Its legit question. When the wind is up as it often is, you can't back into the waves or you will be taking in water. if you are close to rocks or the shore, you probably can't trust spot lock when it really windy. If you're in a small boat with tiller, you might move forward keeping the line tight until you're far enough away to bring the fish in. Yes, you will spend a lot of time getting back to the spot and you may miss it. But that is fishing in the wind. Anyone have a better strategy?"
