6739907,kzoofisher,2023-05-20 20:29:00,5144,All kinds of people in the world. Some need to be in contact with work even on vacation. Some go to Canada to get drunk. Some to hang out with friends and fish a little. Some to fish a lot. And some would rather get on a ship with 5000 strangers. Whatever. So long as their idea of a good time doesn’t ruin my idea of a good time I don’t care. I won’t pretend to understand and won’t tell them I think their way of life is bad unless they want to give me grief about mine.

6739923,pjshorthorn,2023-05-21 03:40:00,5654,"This thread brings back the happy days of my early fishing trips to Canada at age 17 and of my sons when he started at age 10. I grew up before any electronics existed ..of any kind .life was real simple. If you wanted to talk on the corded phone in the kitchen, you took the handset with the 12' cord and stretched it into the dining room for privacy to talk to a girl or a friend. LOL. Now that days are more complicated through connectivity, I guess I miss the old days where no one could reach me at all for a week ..and I never new what happened in the world. Remember when 9/11 happened ? No one knew at a flyin outpost until they were picked up or outfitters flew in and told customers. Tough example, but that is what I knew for a long time. I have hung onto as many of the old traditions of Canadian trips that my Grandfather taught me .now many of them are just a memories. At this point I just enjoy the company of friends who want to be a part of a trip and/ or allow me to be part of their trip. I tend to go to lodges that have connectivity and it is not because they have wifi it just exists as a feature. Do I use it .yes. I'm a reader so that is what I use it for early before the group gets up or after they go to bed not as a deterrent on when to go fishing ..and surely not work related. I'm thankful that phones didn't work in the bush when I was working 16-18 days in the height of my old career. My son has fished with me since he was 4. He started fishing in the coastal bays around San Luis Pass just west of Galveston,TX. We started slow it is hot, humid and stormy in a heartbeat. I let him lead ..it he was uncomfortable, we went in until things calmed down or he was just bored. I was just glad he was along. Cell phones didn't exist ..I got my wife a bag phone by this time as I started traveling a lot. At the age of 4 this was a test to see his interest and patience. We had good days and tough days, but he taught me a lot along the way during the those early years. I had promised him that if he was ready, he could go when he turned 10. When it came time for my trips, I would tuck him in at night and he would ask how many more years Dad? He made that first trip when he he was ten on June 5. He has made many more with me since. We recreated that first trip last season when he was 28. Fished in the same area . Guess what?, by this time electronic games were now a thing. His Gameboy never came out one time the first trip in 1995 once we hit Canada because he was told the rules. He remembered that at age 28 age and put his phone away when we crossed the border. It never came out the rest of the trip until we crossed the border back home.I don't know if was me or him .it just happened. After we crossed the border, he had only one question. Where are we going to find the eggs we need? Told him ..no worries, your great grandfather told me years ago, we will find it along with the Tendflake lard for Mom's pies. Another 800 miles later we arrived and he was a 10 year old again. For all of you taking a kid right now and /or this season, let them be a kid and be a kid yourself. PjShorthorn"
6739925,Esoxmike,2023-05-21 04:23:00,114,"Every child is different that is for sure.My son who is a fisherman still to this day at 21 has his nose in his phone too much for me.My daughter who will sleep in every morning on a fishing trip if you let her could care less about her phone most of the time.I guess the lesson to be learned here isn't for the O.P. But for the fellas with young children,take them fishing early.Don't make a trip to Canada in the bush their first fishing experience,that's a seed you plant with sunfish in a farm pond that will bite anything you put in front of them.Kids need action or they will undoubtedly get tired of it.A little here and a little here and before you know it they are hooked!Trout fishing here in Pennsylvania is king but ..I see too many kids way to young for trout fishing out with dad bored outta their minds,cold,cranky and learning to not like fishing.Leave the young ones at home until they are ready to stream fish.Take them for panfish somewhere where you can't not catch fish,on a warm,dry day and get the fire burning,then introduce more difficult fishing.After you have created a fish catching monster than it's time for some real adventures.Now for my son his first Canada trip was at 7 years old,at a drive to lake I fished since I was 12.Of course his favorite part was catching sunnies,rock bass,perch etc off the dock cuz 2nd week of June can be magic as all fish move shallow to spawn.He couldn't wait to get back to dock every time we were out pike fishing in the boat. And my last piece of advice for any young parents,don't let them have electronics until they absolutely need them for school.No phone,no laptop,no Xbox,no nothing.Electronics don't benefit a child in anyway what so ever,they just hinder proper social development.My son was so embarrassed when all we gave him was a flip phone to call us on in case a wrestling practice was cut short cuz all his friends had IPhones. These lessons I learned when we were kids.The kids in our day that played video games all day couldn't throw a ball,dodge a ball,catch a ball but they could beat Zelda.We called them Nintendo Nerds.I vowed my son wouldn't be like that.We gave him a Xbox when he was 12, and he played it but he had already developed a love for sports,fishing etc and excelled at all.He's been faster than me since 15,throws harder than me since 15 and thinks he's smarter than me since 15! And he's been a **** good trout fisherman since 8 yrs old.he would get all tangled up and my buddy would ask why I wasn't helping him and my reply was  if he didn't get tangled up he would catch more than both of us"
6739927,kettyspanky,2023-05-21 04:26:00,271,"I took my son last year to canada, he was 9. Where we go there is no wifi and we don't even have a TV. We take a radio along and play a game of cards before bed. There are 3 of us on the trip. Our resort does have a pool, so he goes up there a couple times during the week. He never mentions anything about the internet or electronics. We bring a couple papers to read during the week before we head out in the morning. My phone doesn't work up there either. Kinda the way I like it. We go there to fish and enjoy a week on the lake. My son is 10 and going again this year and can't wait. Good luck to all the people that take kids along and enjoy your trip. We do and I'm glad."

6739967,brad34,2023-05-21 08:57:00,892,I'm going to get more specific than that and say smart phones. Cell phones are great for obvious reasons. The addictions really began with smart phones.

6740075,troutwater,2023-05-21 20:27:00,299,"This is a good thread. I agree with most saying that times have changed. My girlfriend likes going to Canada with me, but she does like having some kind of internet available so she can ""catch Pokémon."" I have no problem not being connected to the outside world, and it's one of my favorite things about Canada. Then again as a kid I would fish every opportunity I could. My grandparents would talk about how they couldn't even get me to come inside to eat because I was busy catching countless bluegill from the dock."
6740659,MrSimon,2023-05-24 07:47:00,922,Lots of great discussion here. I'll just say this. Take your kids fishing! Period. Make sure YOU have the right attitude and it will absolutely be good for the kids. Fishing is a special thing.
6740687,CI_Guy,2023-05-24 10:17:00,2118,"When dealing with kids that age I always think of an old Mark Twain line that went something like: ""When I was 18 my father was the dumbest SOB on the planet, by the time I turned 22 I was amazed how much the old man learned in 4 years."""
6739931,bbheli,2023-05-21 04:58:00,1387,Kids that are glued to the phone all day may have a hard time in the real world. Many are isolated and that is not healthy and can lead to depression and anxiety and many other bad things. Today you can see multiple kids in a room and all on the phone vs talking with each other and when they do its just to share something on the screen. The job or a parent is to prepare the kids for the world. Can't dop that by giving in to what they want. Kids need to experience things and if they are not yet men they are still under parents authority. This does not just apply to fishing and they need to learn the world is not the screen. They won't be properly prepared for the world if all they know is what's going on online. Perhaps it does not have to be fishing but put them in the car take them somewhere with no signal so they can learn they can service without the screen. It's an addiction and no difference between a drug or a screen it will result in bad things not good.

6739799,brad34,2023-05-20 07:45:00,892,"My dad and I went on a camping/fishing trip when I was 14 or 15. It was before we had cell phones. Even though I loved camping and fishing, I really did not want to be without my friends for a week. I still went because I was the only one of the siblings that still fished and camped, and I felt obligated. I did my best to hide the fact that I really didn't want to be there, but I know it was pretty obvious.People can moan and groan about the cell phone addiction, which is very real, but teenagers often just want to be with their friends. It is not cool or fun to hang out with mom or dad. As much as you may enjoy it, you should be concerned if they would rather hang out with you than friends."
6739801,Yellowfin123,2023-05-20 08:10:00,2182,that would worry me if they just wanted to follow me around with no friends
6739807,maddogg,2023-05-20 09:14:00,178,But how many of us when we are older wish that we would have spent more time with our dads?
6739809,rknott,2023-05-20 09:19:00,89,"What amazes me about this thread is the level of judgement. Trying to put everyone's kid into the same box as them is crazy. So much science and personal experiences (mine!) that forcing someone through violence to do something you think they should do is simply wrong. We all need to be open to times changing. My dad felt I had it easy because I didn't need to wake up at 4am to feed the cows. At the same time, yes we need to be firm with our kids, they need clear boundaries and for sure they aren't going to want to do everything and there are times they will need to be pushed. Need to fine the line between ""They have never tried it and therefore don't like it"" OR ""I would rather be with my friends"" AND the other extreme that is ""You are doing this no matter what and I don't care that you don't like it we have been doing this for 10 years and we are doing it for another 10"". For sure electronics are a big competitor. Balance is the key. Not never and not 24 hours per day. I am for sure disappointed my kid doesn't want to go fishing with me. It is way too boring for him. Is it so wrong he would rather be working on his car? AND yes he plays video games with his buddies as well. I am bummed, but he tried it, caught many nice sized bass when younger, and it simply isn't his thing. He goes crazy in the boat. Way too many ""ants in his pants"" (old school) or nowadays ""ADHD"". I agree with the middle-ground posts. We got wi-fi up at the lake, got the kids a Roku. Now they like to go, I get some kid time, they get to do what they want to do and we have fun for the most part. They don't like to go up as much as I do, and I tried forcing them only to watch half-hearted sulking and could turn into yelling and frustration if I wanted to, but for what purpose? For those of you with insistent kids you know it will be the same for years and years. I know from personal experiences. For other personalities, they will comply. Some will start to like it and some will be emotionally scarred. Everyone is different. No one size fits all approach. In the end be grateful your kid is healthy."
6739829,Baseline,2023-05-20 12:43:00,3207,"It's not just the kids......I fish with a group of 4 to 6 fisherman who are 60 plus and they log on just as soon as they wake up and when we come in for lunch and at the end of the fishing day the smart phones, IPads and laptops come out and they log on. They answer texts from family, view their social media accounts and groups, watch videos and tv shows. A couple of these guys can't go a day without calling their wives in the morning and evening. This has definitely has impacted the conversation around the cabin. Can't say I never use my phone while on these trips, but it would be nice if these devices stayed in the vehicles. It could be the 17 year old just doesn't want to go fishing with his dad and the rest of the group. Why not find a resort that has internet service and take him there. I could be a good experience for you and both kids."

He was not a fisherman at all, however he took me and my younger brother to our local river to bank fish. As I recall he never had his own rod.Fishing and love for the outdoors was apparently in my DNA . All my fishing knowledge was self taught and shared with my 2 younger brothers.My brothers and I have traveled to many outposts and lodges. We started taking dad when he was 70, 3 sons and Dad. Last trip with him he was 85.Those trips are special beyond words!! And he loved to travel with his ""boys"". I'm 72 now and still travel up to the outposts with my brothers. Dad made it to 99 and until the end talked about those trips.My son has no interest in fishing, but loves to share time with me. We do 1 camping trip a year and we are going to Sweden together this fall. I'm a widower and he's my son and friend! His twin brother and my son died unexpectedly in 2021. I realize this is a fishing thread, however this has evolved into threads of life.Grab whatever you can with your kids and let life evolve with your love for them."

6739727,GreatWhiteNorth517,2023-05-19 14:07:00,286,Hard for me to understand passing up such an opportunity as there was never enough hunting or fishing as a kid. Even a grown up who works there's never enough and i personally don't have the budget for fly in trips. I started taking my nephew (on the in law side) to Ontario and a few years back he stated we would have to go into town every day because he couldn't lose his social media streak-he was at almost 100 days.I told him:1) Hard no.2) You're stupid.
6739755,CI_Guy,2023-05-19 17:25:00,2118,It's a good thing that there are people that don't love to fish. If everyone did there would be no room on the water to do it. Both of my sons fished with me as soon as it was safe to take them in the boat. One became a fisheries biologist and fishes with his family or my wife and I any chance he gets. My other son lost all interest in fishing when he was 16. Now 20 years later he's started fishing a little because his kids have shown an interest in it. Forcing a kid to fish with you spoils the time together for both of you and at 17 he's old enough to make his own decision about this.
6739773,valley366,2023-05-19 21:54:00,193,"I have a 17 year old. Fishing is not his thing. I pushed it as far as I could, he made 5 trips and his last was when he was 15. Wasn't technology just not his thing.I am riding it out as far as I can with my 14 year old. We are at the lake this weekend. We do 2 trips in the summer to Canada. At the lake every chance he gets.Take it as far as you can take it and and accept when you can take it no further."
6739775,elway12,2023-05-19 21:59:00,335,"Good Thread. Many views and opinions. I like what CI_Guy stated. I think for this specific scenario it is important to realize the kid is 17 not 14 or younger = old enough to make a decision about whether to go on a vacation trip that has been offered. Like many, if not most, of us on this site I loved fishing from the time my Dad put a rod in my hand at 4 and will always love it. But I know many people, regardless of age, who don't like to fish or fishing is not that enjoyable for them. I am blessed that my 22 year old son has the same passion for fishing and Canada as I do! My question for the original poster - How much does your son like to fish without being away from their electronics now or near home? As many of you have said I think going on a Fly-In Outpost trip is a bit more of a commitment than a shorter trip with or without internet."
6739777,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2023-05-19 23:16:00,240,"Hi--our outfitter (Nestor Falls Outposts) have created wifi connections in each of their outpost cabins, so there are lots of opportunities for you and your son to fly-in, enjoy the great fishing, and still have the connections your son craves. I personally hate what this means for our trips. My younger brother now insists on bringing the satellite radio so he and his friends can listen to these stupid golf tournaments, Stanley Cup Finals, etc., etc. Have to wait to go fishing in the morning so that he can work from his 'office' on Onepine Lake. I get that these things are important to a lot of people, but I feel that a part of our trip, our reason for going, is being ruined by this. Next up? Flush toilets. Trying to put a group of 6 guys together is next to impossible now. Even harder is trying to find a group of 6 guys who are like-minded with regard to this technology crap. Many outfitters are resigned to accepting small groups of 4 or even 2. With Nestor Falls Outposts, the 180 mile flights from Nestor Falls to the Woodland Caribou PP and beyond have created fixed costs that are impossible to cover by accepting smaller groups. So what do they do? They create amenities and creature comforts (expensive recliners, brand new decks, immaculate outpost cabins) to continue attracting people to their outposts. A week at Onepine, Clear, or Larus is heaven on earth to me. I am sure many on this board have already mentioned a lot of these talking points. Sorry if I am being redundant. Bottom Line? With regard to your son's needs and wants, you can have the best of both worlds now. Only I feel that this stuff is diminishing the experience rather than improving it. Best of luck working through all of this. I hope you are able to put together a nice trip for you and your sons. Hope to see a trip review in the future! Jim in Bessemer, Michigan"
6739787,kzoofisher,2023-05-20 04:07:00,5144,"Agree with the “different kids” posters. My oldest will fish if the weather is good and he’s in the mood. He went to Canada once and had an ok time. I didn’t force him and he still kinda likes to fish. My younger has fished more than 100 days already this year and will go anytime. He’s fishing with me this weekend, our last chance until August. Next weekend he’ll spend prepping, hanging with his grandparents and friends before he goes to guide salmon in Alaska for three months. If he wasn’t going there he’d jump at the chance to go back to Canada. He’ll be going with me again when his “real” job becomes enough of a career he can’t take summers off."

She is now married, and when she found out that I was headed to Canada without her this summer she was pretty mad. My other daughter is very analytical, and she can scout a river like nobody. She sees pods of trout that I miss. Yet I can't get her to get over touching a squirming, slimy fish :-)My ""nephew"" (adopted son of friends) is currently being conditioned to like fishing. So far I put the chances of success at 50/50. We've been trying to get his hands dirty by exploring under rocks, catching bugs, building stick and rock crap outside, and he ""caught"" his first fish last summer at age 3. His attention span is about the duration of the flash of a firefly, so it is hard to keep him interested in anything. In all honesty, I am somewhat addicted to my phone too. I note this in the evenings at camp. However, if I am sitting around a fire I don't miss it at all."
6739687,Pink Unicorn,2023-05-19 09:18:00,83,I remember when I was young I didn't want to go to the mall with my grandparents... now I'd do anything to be able to spend time with them. Keep the faith! Hopefully you'll be in good health for many years and when they mature a bit they'll take you up on the trip!
6739443,theweb,2023-05-18 05:57:00,7,"Its funny to me because that is one of the main reasons i do want to go.. To get away from my cell phone and computer!! When we were kids, we begged to go.. But no one was allowed until we were like 12."
6739447,johnboat,2023-05-18 06:02:00,2014,"Call his bluff. Switch to a camp with wifi, they're everywhere.You're happy, he's happy.Me personally, 17 year olds don't make decisions like that for me. Now if the reason is because of something such as his Summer job, Athletics, Family related, School related, etc... that's another story. But just flat out, "" I can't live without my phone"", (that you're probably paying for) hard no.I'd find a place to accommodate you both, even pay for one of his buddies to come with. Once your young man gets caught up in life down the road, it will just get harder to share time together.Maybe let him know it's really not about the fishing, but spending time together and sharing a hobby you love to do.And no, I'm not a total hard nosed Dictator with my kids (now 28 & 29 years old) but sometimes we as parents need to ""Adult up""He may may love it and make it annual thing, he may not. Or maybe, if he goes on your trip, you go with him on whatever interests him whether you like it or not.The years go fast........Good Luck, I hope you find some common ground."
6739473,lmoore,2023-05-18 07:20:00,40,"He'll come around when he gets older. Priorities of 17 year old boys are pretty much Girls Friends Girls At some point those change and spending time with dad fishing moves way up the list. For now, be understanding and maybe bring up a shorter trip to northern WI or MN sometime where he can catch a bunch of fish but still talk to his list of priorities when he wants to."
6739501,chscwi,2023-05-18 09:05:00,6,"Just out of curiosity, where do you live? In a city? I live in a small town out in the country where my kids spent a lot of time in nature. I took my kid to Canada in 2019 for the first time at age 11. It was supposed to be the start of a yearly thing until Covid hit and we haven't been back. Trying to get up there this year but my daughter is graduating from HS and June is to busy to go(my normal trip time). He keeps asking me when we are going to Canada. Now 15 years old, if I tried going without him there would be **** to pay. But that goes the same for local weekend fishing/hunting I do. He actually pushes me to fish/hunt more now than I would on my own. BUT if we are at home, he is on electronics, I think just out of boredom. Back when I was growing up the ""older"" generation complained that all we did was watch TV. The phones have just replaced TV. Living in northern WI I can get to our fishing area in Canada in less than 10 hrs which helps. Hope to make at least a 4-5 day run up there in July but never fished later than the second week of June. Just curious if where you grow up has any bearing on your drive to do things like off grid trips. I think 95% of the kids I know would jump at the chance to fish in Ontario, but I have always lived in small towns."
6739503,MrSimon,2023-05-18 09:11:00,922,"This is a hot button topic for me. I have 5 kids age 16 down to 3. It's immensely important to me and my wife that our kids are not addicted to screens, as most kids are. We have worked really hard to let them have an appropriate amount of screen time, but keep them balanced with outdoor activities, sports, music, church, etc. Some of my kids love fishing, some don't. But, when I offered them a drive-to trip to the French River this summer they all jumped at it. Not because they love fishing, but because they know it will be a fun adventure and cool things will happen. And not a single one even asked if they have wifi there. It's because I raised them to find enjoyment outside of screens. It started when they were 2. PS - none of my kids have any social media exposure whatsoever. It's garbage. Pure mind-numbing garbage."
6739505,grindstone,2023-05-18 09:19:00,201,"Interesting discussion (except one post) I took my 2 boys the summer they were turning 16 they will be 39 and 40 this summer. The younger son has joined me every year since, we only missed the covid 2 years. Through various jobs and life changes he found a way because he loves it. The older son has been twice and really only went to spend time w me his brother and the great group of our long time friends. As you mentioned your son was honest and polite that tells me he is heading in the direction that all parents hope for and some achieve. Our group made made a second trip one year in August and everyone brought the rest of their children and the wives that could attend. I didn't make that trip I really had no interest but I still hear the great stories of that adventure. I couldn't tell you as I sit reminiscing if the camp had WIFI back then. Doesn't really matter the only point to make here is that of that group the only ones that joined us on subsequent trips were those that previously had been with us to fish. I hope you eventually get one of them to join in your passion."
6739511,Tx Jig tyr,2023-05-18 09:23:00,140,"I don't doubt he is truthful about not going. My suggestion is keep the offer open each year. It may surprise you in a year to two. If one of them goes eventually and has fun, the other will likely follow soon. In the mean time, go, enjoy your trip and don't feel guilty in any way. Tx Jig Tyr"
6739527,Yellowfin123,2023-05-18 10:07:00,2182,"like 1 poster gave age examples, ages 3 - 16 is the time to get them exposed to the outdoors and the lake fun, forget about yourself and do what they want to do and keep adjusting as you go, its all about them!! 1st thing i would do is make the area has alot of smallmouth, they'll remember that fish that jumped outa the water 3 times... ages 17-30 they'll probably have better things to do, it ain't 1975 fishing with grand daddy any more.. once their married and maybe some kids, they will probably come back to the lake and start all over again"
6739529,Fisherman Ted,2023-05-18 10:08:00,461,"Go to a camp that offers wi-fi. I would start with a drive-in which should have hi-speed service. Then you have the best of both worlds. They can surf when they want and still be exposed to great Canadian fishing. Then if they get hooked you can try a fly-in later. Or just stick with operators that can offer both. As an aside with the advent of Starlink many remote lodges have great wi-fi, even in remote areas and it will only grow. I have 2 Starlink dishes. Great investment. Good luck. -FT"
6739555,Habitual Eyer,2023-05-18 11:23:00,144,"Really bummed me out when my son lost interest at about 15 in Canada. We took many trips together. Now at 24 he's getting the itch again and sounds like its a strong itch. He knows Canada though enough to realize what he's missing. Maybe try a drive to that has service. After exploring many walleye lakes around Ontario last 30 yrs...i cant believe how well i do on Gulrock and Red Lake compared to more remote stuff. Yea your not waaaay out in the bush, but good plan to give kids a taste."
6739379,Eckohlt,2023-05-17 19:35:00,3685,"Tell the kid he can stare at a depth finder all week,that's electronics,plus he might Learn something."
6739383,NETim1187,2023-05-17 19:52:00,166,"Dad would've had a **** of a time shaking us kids on his fishing trips once we got old enough. The first trip to MN so many years ago now just absolutely hooked us. We plotted and planned and combed through the Herter's and Cabela's catalogs. I can remember watching Virgil Ward on cold, gray January Sunday afternoons. We went nuts when he went to the wilds of Minnesota. I'll never forget the night we went to a local boat dealer to look at boats. There was a '66 Crestliner Voyager 15 with a Merc 50 on it. The salesman said the guy who had it previously used it on the ""big lakes up north."" I was sold. Fortunately, Mom and Dad ponied up the $$$ and it came home. One of the best things they ever bought IMHO. (The first being the 7 acre acreage they moved us onto when I was in 5th grade. Lots of room to roam for us little yahoos.) The Spring after I got out of the USN, the family headed to LOTW. That opened a whole new chapter in my fishing hobby. The rest is history as they say. Thanks Dad!"
6739385,prov1800,2023-05-17 19:58:00,5010,There are options.Maybe outposts with cell service and or wifi so your boys can get a fix.Ive been to outposts with guys in their 30 s that had no signal of any sort and they were having withdrawals.Amazing how hooked some people are.But with options at least your boys might enjoy what the trip has to offer and some electronic release for them.
6739389,Eckohlt,2023-05-17 20:07:00,3685,"Alls your gonna hear when your out fishing is,when we going back to the cabin, and again and again,then the next day,I don't feel good I'll stay in the cabin,big waste of money!!"
6739397,Yellowfin123,2023-05-17 20:47:00,2182,"taking kids to canada you need the resorts and lodges with beach, wifi, water toys, rec room, fishin, swimming, water trampoline, etc .... the remote @$#%hole outpost cabins are not gonna work about 98% of the time.... sure we like it, they DON""T"
6739399,RichA$1970,2023-05-17 21:11:00,1159,"I took my 2 sons to Canada once and they caught a lot of fish on a fly-in but after Day 3, they were ready to bail with a 17 hour drive back. Now they take a 22 hour flight to Thailand & enjoy the lifestyle there. Like Eck said, no problem as that’s more trips for me & less people to please."
6739405,LoDo,2023-05-17 21:22:00,721,"Good thread and a few thoughts. If you're kids are not outside kids, sports kids, active etc... I get the need to have electronics on family vacation. I put this on the parents. IMO, parents have to put kids in all the activities possible outside of school to keep them off electronics. IMO, its parenting. A group of us guys bought land and built a cabin a few yrs ago in NW Ontario. I'm 44 with two boys, 8 n 5. These kids are in all the sports, outdoor activities, etc.. We own one ipad, no gaming system. Kids are in golf, swimming, soccer, baseball, flag football, piano, etc.. In other words the house is busy after school and summer time. Both boys can't wait to see this cabin. I'm hoping to get them up there this summer. Personally i think you force the kids to go with you and leave the electronics behind."
6739425,Timmer92,2023-05-18 05:14:00,451,"That's a tough call. Sometimes you force your kid to do something and in the end they have fun, sometimes in the end they don't. I took my oldest on my annual turkey hunting trip for several years, but the older he got, the less he wanted to get out of bed that early in the morning. Now he hasn't gone with me in 3 years. I probably could have handled it differently. I could have gone out by myself and let him sleep in, and then gone back to pick him up and continued hunting, but I didn't. I have regrets. I would have rather hunted with him part time than not at all. I'd say skip the fly in and do a resort on a good lake. Let them love fishing and still have their darned devices."
6739427,Clairebear,2023-05-18 05:22:00,937,"It's obvious he doesn't share your passion. I bet when he's 35 he'll want to be there. Somewhere between 15 and 19 most kids (but not all) brains turn to mush. They seem to want all the adult privilages without the responsability. Leave him a list of a few tasks that you know could easily be accomplished and explain that they need to be done when dad gets home and if their not then he will lose a few things. Your house, your rules. Hardest thing that I had to do as a dad was to kick my son out of the house at 18 years old. ( tough love). When he came back home 4 months later he was a changed kid, and at 43 now is on line to retire by 50. Good luck and enjoy your trip."

6739353,andreindy,2023-05-17 18:18:00,308,"Just processing that my 17 old son is declining again to go on our Ontario Outpost Fly-In. He has never been to Canada. He said that he would not be able to go that long without his phone, his connection to his friends and other electronics. He was honest (I believe him) and he was polite about it. So was I. My 10 year old shares similar sentiments about the electronics. It hurts in a Dad-way to hear it. It's how they feel and I can't get angry at them about it. And this post is not a judgement of this generation, or that is not my intention. Just needed to type out my thoughts and think on it for now."
6739359,Eckohlt,2023-05-17 18:32:00,3685,"That's there problem,now you have extra money to do 2 trips,that's the way I'd look at it."

It's not about the phone, friends, electronics. It's about kids being kids and having more fun not going on a remote fishing trip. At 17 I wouldn't have went either."

I've got 4, if i told them we were going on a fly in lake in canada, they'd probably rather jump off a cliff... they probably go just to please the ol man sometimes but by day 3 they're miserable, even with phones...

One still goes when he can and I hope he can carry on the legacy someday. How about a fly-in where he can do both- fish and get online? I think he would be surprised at how much he would enjoy himself. At 17 if my Dad or Grandpa would of asked me I would have jumped at the chance- I could leave the girls, local fishing, swimming, sports, etc. for a week"
