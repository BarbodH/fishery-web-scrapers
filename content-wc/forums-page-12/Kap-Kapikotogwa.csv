6737457,bester,2023-05-07 16:57:00,18,"no portage required last year getting into tester, other then weeds getting wrapped around the prop and a few boulders here and there it was a fun trip. Its a small lake that's seen very little pressure the last few years because of low water and of course the boarder being closed. Lots of walleye and on the bigger side as well. Echohit, you should have no problem ""bending the rod"" in Melchett, that lake is loaded!"

6740873,Spartan1,2023-05-25 10:27:00,46,I fished Tennet last summer and made a couple trips into Kap. The water was high so we had no problem getting between the lakes. There is very good fishing in the river so it is a good place to explore and get fish as the same time. If you decide to venture to Tennet. I highly recommend the narrows at the opposite end of the lake. It is a boat ride but not too bad. Jig the narrows and it will produce non-stop action.
6736715,asnodgrass2120,2023-05-03 10:55:00,7,We are heading to Kap/Kapikotogwa lake in Ontario in June. Anyone experience this lake before? Hot spots? Any help is appreciate. I see by maps it is accessible to Tennet and Melchett Lakes. Experience with getting to these lakes or how they fish too?
6736717,Eckohlt,2023-05-03 11:07:00,3685,When in June you going??
6736719,asnodgrass2120,2023-05-03 11:11:00,7,Mid month
6736721,Eckohlt,2023-05-03 11:15:00,3685,I'll be at melchett June 16.
6736723,asnodgrass2120,2023-05-03 11:17:00,7,We will be heading out of Kap lake the next day. Best of luck.
6736735,Eckohlt,2023-05-03 11:40:00,3685,You to!
6736943,bester,2023-05-04 15:10:00,18,"I've been to Melchett 3 times, twice we were able to make it up to Kap and the other time the water was to low in the river. We spent a half day fishing Kap and found fish but honestly didn't concentrate on a particular spot. There is a fairly deep hole as soon as you get into the south river that held a good number of walleye. Once through the first couple hundred yards, the north route is easier to navigate then the south. If you want a fun adventure and the water is up try getting into Tester lake. We made a day of it there last year with a shore lunch and plenty of eyes. PM if you want more info."
6736961,asnodgrass2120,2023-05-04 18:21:00,7,Can you explain more about Tester lake? I see what appears to be the access point on the South river towards Melchett. What type of fish are there? How long does the portage there take?
6737015,oleJoe,2023-05-05 08:03:00,114,"Been to Kap a couple of times and the fishing was ok. Getting to Tennant might be a challenge. The river is small entering Kap and if it has a lot of water it is fast. Going the other way, Melchett is very good fishing. North is the easiest way way. Start fishing when you get to the last pool in river. Big rock on right turn. That dumps into Melchett and if go right in the river ,it takes you back up the south entrance. From there to Tester will take you about 40 mins. Small creek all the way and maybe a beaver dam. Good fishing and a nice day trip. Enjoy your trip."
6737073,MrSimon,2023-05-05 13:12:00,922,"We were in Melchett in late August and were able to get into Kap, but it took getting out of the boat and walking it through some skinny spots. Fishing was fine in Kap. I enjoyed the river between the lakes too, lots and lots of pike but nothing big. We tried to get into Tester but the water was a bit low and the creek was filled with weeds - we tried for about 45 minutes but only made it about 1/3 of the way, so we turned back."
