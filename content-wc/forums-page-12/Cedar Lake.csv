6740267,prov1800,2023-05-22 18:35:00,5010,Are you planning to pound the whole lake.lol.

6740349,prov1800,2023-05-23 06:24:00,5010,I'll get out there probably next week.My last week of freedom.
6740351,prov1800,2023-05-23 06:27:00,5010,Have a great time.Ill be on Eagle that week so we can compare notes.
6740115,prov1800,2023-05-22 05:55:00,5010,Got out yesterday for my first trip on Cedar.Nasty wind coming across lake at the launch at Northern Lights.You woukd never think there was 40 km winds yesterday acording to my pictures.Water level seems to be normal.Very windy day again but Cedar has lots of places to hide.Walleye fishing was incredible.Grabbed 5 dozen minnows and they were gone by 11 am.So some very fast action.Mostly eater sized walleyes. Went and tried some bass spots after that and I figured I caught around 30 of them they are very agressive.Threw some flicker shad cranks at them and seemed to like them..Water temps were at 50 f.Bass are anywhere from 5-10 ft.Walleyes were in about same depth.Only went as far as the narrows heading toward the east end.Was not busy on lake.Did see a few boats going and coming.
6740123,Eckohlt,2023-05-22 06:07:00,3685,"Nice spot in those pictures,fish were even there hiding from the wind."
6740135,RichA$1970,2023-05-22 07:18:00,1159,"Great pics John and after 5 dozen minnows, do you ever try plastics to see how they’d bite? I know after going through all those minnows it’s probably fun to throw some cranks. Wind is a killer but must have been a blast out there."
6740141,prov1800,2023-05-22 07:44:00,5010,I do for five minutes.lol.action takes a nose dive.Yesterday they nibbled and tasted the minnows.Very very light bite.Probably if I had cheap rod I wouldn't of done as good I think.Tried couple rubbers.Took a while to catch one.So why bother.lol.Real bait can't be beat.Caught walleye on crank bait though.They liked them.
6740215,nitroman,2023-05-22 13:20:00,368,"Nice to see! be there in 3 weeks, save some for us!"
6740221,Eckohlt,2023-05-22 13:56:00,3685,"Nitro cancel your trip,john will have cedar wiped out before you arrive.lol"
6740225,prov1800,2023-05-22 15:47:00,5010,NO chance of wiping that lake out.
6740227,prov1800,2023-05-22 15:50:00,5010,There's plenty of fish in Cedar as you know.When you coming up
