I was seeing some pics of Lac Suel and it looked very low as well, although i know they try to keep it lower in the spring and bring it up with spring rains.."
6739463,prov1800,2023-05-18 06:35:00,5010,Water was low with very little run off this spring and still have had no significant rain so it will be low unless we get a lot of rain.
6739763,Eyes_R_Us,2023-05-19 19:14:00,66,A year ago we were looking at pictures of that doc and the water was about to go over it.
