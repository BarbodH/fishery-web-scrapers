6740121,Bill Krejca,2023-05-22 06:03:00,6107,"When in the area, we always stop at the store on the highway in Emo. It is just to the right when entering town from FF. They have a large selection of everything and their large bread selection is fresh. In addition, the adult beverage store is also on the right, just before you get to the grocery store. Bill"

6739981,Larry S,2023-05-21 11:00:00,665,Need to Know Supermarkets/Food Stores on Hwy 71 between Ft Francis and Kenora. Just Got a Call asking if we could Fly-In on Friday due to heavy Fly-In traffic on Saturday. We will be able to do it and need a Supermarket/Food Store between Ft Francis & Kenora to shop This is great because the early Fly-In gives my Sister & me and Extra Day to Fish Larry S
