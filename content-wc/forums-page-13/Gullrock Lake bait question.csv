I've gone to another lake with just my dad the past few years. We usually go the 2nd week of June primarily use crawlers. Last year leeches were better than crawlers so I spent and wasted money on half a flat of crawlers we didn't use. Headed to Gullrock this year and staying at the Golden Hook Camp. What is the bait of choice on that lake that time of year? Minnows (which seem pricy), leeches, or the ol fashion worm? Does it even matter? I would like to pre-order bait on the way up if I can so just looking for opinions on guys who have fished that lake that time of year. I love the knowledge on this board so I thought I would ask. Thanks everyone-Aaron"
6737749,Fishin Fun,2023-05-08 20:49:00,218,Honestly what's worked the best for us is minnows. We have done well on crawlers too but minnows always seem to out perform. We stay at Five Lakes Lodge and Ian always suggests minnows and we do very well with them.
6737877,Old Timer,2023-05-09 09:52:00,255,"My thoughts. Through early July I like minnows. And I like medium chubs in the spring and early summer. Than large chubs in the fall. I buy a big wad of air-packed minnows in route to my destination. Once there, I unloaded them into two mesh floaters that I suspend under the dock. If it's going to be a warm day I put rocks in the floaters and drop them down three or four feet. Then I use big paper clamps to pinch tight the opening in the bags. Reason? I've been cleaned out by a weasel. In the boat I use a foam-lined, five-gallon minnow pail. Works good all day. I lose very few minnows with this system very few. Good luck on your Gullrock trip."

6738135,valley366,2023-05-10 14:17:00,193,We will be on Gullrock 17-24 June. Going a week later then normal and have always used minnows with great success. We also go the 3rd week of August and minnows all the way.There are some guys in camp that use crawlers in our August trip. They had some excess that they gave us and we used them for a bit but went back to minnows.Have also been playing with plastics. Decent luck on minnow colored powerbaits in some circumstances but will still be getting minnows everyday.
6738227,Wickguy1,2023-05-11 06:35:00,14,Minnows it is. Thanks everyone
