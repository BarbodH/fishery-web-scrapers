6734023,Franco,2023-04-22 07:06:00,107,Lol…I take back what I said about ice out! The opener on everything north of 17 is going to be dicey!
6734035,prov1800,2023-04-22 07:33:00,5010,Last few days were bad.Lots of snow and wind would not stop.Few more days of below zero and then not looking to bad.Toward end of week daytime Temps rise and above zero at night.Thats the formula we need to get things melting.We do have a month and and I've seen some fast melts over the years.Usually everything pans out.As far as a may 6-10 ice out is not looking good but you never know.
6734053,Franco,2023-04-22 08:17:00,107,Yeah…looks like things really start to warm up in early May. Hope it all pans out. I won’t be up near there until end of June but flying out of Wawa on June 2nd. Wawa lake looks like it will be open in a few days.
6734055,RichA$1970,2023-04-22 08:39:00,1159,Beautiful day and that’s the way to spend a day
6734057,prov1800,2023-04-22 08:54:00,5010,Sure was Rich.Will try to get out this week couple of times.Rather be in a boat.But that will come soon.
6734077,prov1800,2023-04-22 10:05:00,5010,This is what we are looking at this week in our area.Nice daytime Temps and few cool nights to keep shorelines tight so we can get on ice a couple more times.
6737923,Franco,2023-05-09 13:43:00,107,Wawa Lake is ice free as of this afternoon…lol…I was only 2 weeks off…&#x1f616;

6732641,prov1800,2023-04-17 13:08:00,5010,Good thing iam going ice fishing 3 days before ice goes.lol.Will post about ice thickness tomorrow

6732979,prov1800,2023-04-18 17:03:00,5010,"So today got out with Ryan and Denise.Turned out to be a beautifull day and got up to around +5c.Lake trout were on fire.Caught a bunch and lost track of what we caught and all pretty good sized.Nothing like a good lake yrout fight that starts at 60 ft.We kinda figured out ice thickness is around 22""of solid ice.Only a bit of frozen slush on top.Awesome ride out on my ATV and Ryan had his snowmobile."
6732989,Eckohlt,2023-04-18 18:21:00,3685,Looks like fun!

6732093,tanderson15,2023-04-15 20:05:00,37,Will ice be out by 20 May opening
6732095,Limeyangler,2023-04-15 20:26:00,563,Yes.
6732103,prov1800,2023-04-15 21:33:00,5010,Always does
6732115,pjshorthorn,2023-04-16 03:19:00,5654,Not in 1990. Sat at the Houseboat dock for two days on opener waiting for ice to go out and then only made it as far Taylor Island when we could launch. Eerie feeling listening to the pontoons bouncing off ice. I don't recommend this approach. PjShorthorn
6732133,prov1800,2023-04-16 06:34:00,5010,There's exceptions PJ.6-7 years ago was same deal.ice was Broken up and had big sheets floating around but managed to get out and fish still.Good adventure.
6732433,Lmbkiller,2023-04-16 21:22:00,639,Ice out was 2 days before opener last. I was there so I know. Hopefully it is exactly the same this yr. I don't mind catching adult walleyes all day everyday
6732529,N_of_Quibell,2023-04-17 08:42:00,151,"If Minnesota is any guide, iceout is progressing northward this year in a pattern very similar to last year, although there is alot of unpredictable randomness in the system:https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/ice_out/...html?year=2023 (This is a great website for exploring historical iceout patterns.)"
6732611,Franco,2023-04-17 11:47:00,107,Ice out will be closer to April 20th this year.
6732631,Eckohlt,2023-04-17 12:39:00,3685,"Ya somewhere in this world it will be out April 20th,,,not Ontario!"
6732635,Franco,2023-04-17 12:45:00,107,"I was being facetious…but it will definitely be waaaaay before May 20th this year. Ice quality was bad all season, temps skyrocketed last week and won’t be low for for very long. There’s also lots of rain in the forecast. Wawa Lake will be largely free of ice in 6-8 days tops.
