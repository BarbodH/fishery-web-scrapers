6737239,N_of_Quibell,2023-05-06 15:13:00,151,"The tradeoff seems to be timeliness or resolution - I haven't been able to achieve both. Sentinel 2 imagery is nice res, but typically a few days out of date. The picture shows Eagle Lake/VB 2 days ago - maybe some open water around the edges, but a ways to go. This image was downloaded from the Sentinel Hub EO Browser:"

6737495,nitroman,2023-05-07 19:34:00,368,Cedar is ice free
6737995,Pink Unicorn,2023-05-09 21:22:00,83,"Today's ice in red lake. Based on forecast, ice will be out very shortly"
6738233,Iceshack05,2023-05-11 06:56:00,31,"Here is an excellent site for Lake of the Woods. Updates are almost daily, and lots of pics, satelite images, etc.https://icepatrol.wordpress.com/"
6738235,Iceshack05,2023-05-11 06:57:00,31,Sorry Tonyo....didn't see that you posted it already!
6737097,Lktrician,2023-05-05 16:56:00,32,Can someone please tell me about a site where I can check to see if a lac is still covered in ice or open?
6737099,Eckohlt,2023-05-05 17:02:00,3685,What is a lac???
6737101,Lktrician,2023-05-05 17:10:00,32,I would call it a lake but defer to what Canadians address them as.
6737103,Eckohlt,2023-05-05 17:13:00,3685,Ok thanks.
6737105,Clairebear,2023-05-05 17:14:00,937,"In most of Canada it is a lake, in Quebec it is lac. Just for clarification."
6737119,grizzley,2023-05-05 19:53:00,2518,Might give IceShanty a try!
6737145,Skywagon,2023-05-06 06:09:00,1106,My lac is still covered with ice.
6737151,Eckohlt,2023-05-06 06:42:00,3685,The lac looks solid.
6737159,RichA$1970,2023-05-06 07:08:00,1159,Looking at next week’s forecast for Dryden d it’s showing highs of 22/23c which will really help. My bet is in 2 weeks it will all be gone.
6737167,N_of_Quibell,2023-05-06 08:30:00,151,"I hope to be on open water in about a week. Satellite imagery is starting to show some holes in some areas already. The thing is, water is at it's greatest density at 39F, so there's actually a lot of ""warm"" water under that ice. As soon as a little wind stirs up the water at the holes, its gone!"
