6738759,Obabikon,2023-05-14 09:40:00,2370,The water is a little bit high… But it’s still four feet lower than it was at that point.
6738141,Eckohlt,2023-05-10 15:04:00,3685,Got that right!
6738143,NETim1187,2023-05-10 15:09:00,166,That looks absolutely splendid.
6738177,Yellowfin123,2023-05-10 18:07:00,2182,no worries mate.... it would be a good area of lotw for you to visit..
6738289,1shooter,2023-05-11 12:18:00,1493,That would be better picture if my boat was tied to the dock
6738309,Eckohlt,2023-05-11 14:07:00,3685,You got a 14 footer n 9.9 on it?just like a outpost boat they look good in pics.
6738315,1shooter,2023-05-11 14:22:00,1493,similar but a black motor
6738319,Eckohlt,2023-05-11 14:28:00,3685,"That's a nice picture,should look like that may20."
6738413,1shooter,2023-05-12 07:04:00,1493,I'll be there in 4 weeks and 1 day but whose counting.
6738585,muskyman73,2023-05-13 00:43:00,401,Lets hope we see no more of this
6738679,1shooter,2023-05-13 12:55:00,1493,that was terrible
6737579,JHuheey,2023-05-08 07:20:00,70,"Well, did you find some Bass in ""Bass Country""? Looks like that area has lots of good structure, but would be pretty open on a windy day."
6737591,Bill Krejca,2023-05-08 07:31:00,6107,"I have both the Hot Spots map and the govt 6214, and in my opinion, 6214 is much more detailed. The reason I like to look at it before heading to the next spot is that, although a chart will show the ""tree"", I prefer to see the ""forest"" when moving on the water, seeing where I will be rather then just where I am. The area is fun and a great fishery, sure to provide enjoyment. Bill"
6737607,Yellowfin123,2023-05-08 07:57:00,2182,"well actually we never hit that area , spent most of our time up around the obabikon area and places we explored that bill krejca pointed me to, I was bound and determined to get into some crappie.... heading into obabikon lake was where i got stuck "" long story"" but thats a spot people where heading that bill told me about ""the elbow""it was a weird time on LOTW with water temps and such, it was oct 4- oct 9 and we were barefoot, shorts, and t shirts, fish were just laying on the bottom, pulled up a smallmouth that was just flat out yellow and yes it was a smallmouth.... as far as bigger size walleye we found was 100 yards from our home dock on litttle raspberry"
6737617,Eckohlt,2023-05-08 09:16:00,3685,"That must have been the first week of Oct after they opened the border,I was at press lake it was frikin warm."
6737627,JHuheey,2023-05-08 09:56:00,70,"Is the ""Elbow"" where you ran up on that rock, or is it one of Bill's suggested fishing areas In either case, would like to know where it is - especially the ""rock"""
6737649,Yellowfin123,2023-05-08 11:51:00,2182,"the ""elbow"" is a known hotspot inside obabikon lake maybe 4-6 miles from the resort I got stuck at the entrance to obabikon lake, this is a spot plenty of people on WC know about, its simple, just hug the big boulder on the left, i had a wind gust push me to the right and the keel just sat down between 2 rocks, didn't even scratch the bottom of the boat when it was all said and done, couldn't pull it off but had to lift it off, 7-8 boats waiting and everybody parked and stood on the boulder giving advise, ended up being a little party that day... mr bill or mr obabikon can give you tips about that area, they've forgotton more than I'll ever know about that area of LOTW... I will be going back if it kills me"
6737663,JHuheey,2023-05-08 12:07:00,70,I assume you are talking about the entrance to Obabikon Bay -
6737667,Yellowfin123,2023-05-08 12:33:00,2182,"NO, its obabikon LAKE, and the entrance is at the northern end of obabikon bay"
6737677,JHuheey,2023-05-08 13:50:00,70,"I know these are stupid questions to someone who's been there - looked at the map and found Obabikon Lake, looks like its on or part of the Indian Reservation. That is skinny water going up there"
6738139,Obabikon,2023-05-10 15:02:00,2370,First morning back on the island!!! Beautiful day!
6737367,NETim1187,2023-05-07 10:08:00,166,I have the Canadian charts and leave them in the cabin. They are very useful for plotting and planning for the next fishing expedition on the lake. I keep Fishing Hot Spots maps in the boat. They are waterproof and can be marked on. They are further backup to the GPS units.
6737393,BreezyPoint,2023-05-07 12:43:00,1581,"They may have an BoatUSA tow operator there, but I highly doubt it. Do not count on an easy tow unless your resort owner can do that for you. I have personally towed multiple boat in that part of Lake of the Woods. They were not able to find tows with their cell phones or marine band radios."
6737399,7 Mag,2023-05-07 13:24:00,1887,"Wow, there must be a lot of hazards in this area. The water level fluctuates so much I'm sure a lot of hazards are difficult to see."
6737417,Yellowfin123,2023-05-07 15:33:00,2182,"as was mentioned I keep a hotspot map in the boat too, but as far as getting to point a to point bthe landing to obabikon ""the island"" its very uneventful, you can zoom in and see the road to get there, give little rasberry island a wide birth or cut between the islands and its free sailingbut yea 95% of the lakes in all of NWO you can say ""bring an extra prop""I could mark huey a spot where we had 4 musky and a big pike in less than 2 hours close to the island but that would be giving away mr obabikons trade secretsI didn't draw that circle to avoid the area, I had just marked that as ""bass country"" when there"
6737435,JHuheey,2023-05-07 16:15:00,70,Do the various resorts out that way operate FM Radios? I know cell phone and even sat phones probably don't work well in that area. Hopefully you can get someone on the radio if you're having a problem out there.
6737437,NETim1187,2023-05-07 16:16:00,166,Hmmm.... I don't know why bass would live there.
6737439,JHuheey,2023-05-07 16:18:00,70,"From the map it looks like an easy run up to the island. I'd just keep myself out of the ""narrows"" between smaller Islands - like between Strawberry and Little Strawberry."
6737445,Yellowfin123,2023-05-07 16:39:00,2182,"do you mean little rasberry and rasberry island? if so we stayed on little rasberry island, looked like mud bottom, saw boats flying by doing 40 thru there and it was low water when we were there, i just kept the tiller handle in the left hand, hotspot map in my right hand.... there's obvious areas where you putt putt .."
6737455,Riding high,2023-05-07 16:54:00,69,The safe route up to Obabikon is between little and big raspberry. It's mud and plenty of water through the narrows. I've done it dozens of time. I've met other boats in there just get over its fine. On the way up stay right of the red buoy there's a big rock between it and the island.
6737575,JHuheey,2023-05-08 07:12:00,70,"Yeah, I meant Rasberry Island - had a ""senior moment"" there ..."
6737095,Old Timer,2023-05-05 16:19:00,255,"JH: A bit more info. Gill's is in no wake Hanson Bay. If you're looking at a map, you boat due north out of Hanson, past Raspberry and Rabbit Islands, and on to Jared's camp. I use part of the same route to another camp and haven't hit a rock so far. I suspect Grassy's landing is in the same bay, but not sure of that."
6737113,NETim1187,2023-05-05 17:48:00,166,"I've launched out of Gill's multiple times. I'm told Grassy is just north of there but no first hand knowledge. I've been going to LOTW for a lotta years and have had only one moderately serious rock encounter. No damage done fortunately since we were just idling along, but still we slid up on top of that big rock and had to be towed off. I've bumped into a LOT of rocks with the Minnkota rock detector though. Even after all these years in familiar ""home"" waters, I still manage to find new rocks."
6737165,JHuheey,2023-05-06 07:45:00,70,"Sounds like getting there is an adventure Never been on LOW but sounds like I better bring my extra prop, prob hub, and tool bag and BoatUSA tow card"
6737175,Eckohlt,2023-05-06 08:47:00,3685,Just throw a extra motor in the boat.
6737185,Yellowfin123,2023-05-06 09:11:00,2182,"oct 21 was my 1st time to the sabaskong bay area of LOTW, we parked at government dock for free for 5 days, just past hanson's, I cut by little rasberry island and on up to obabikon bay in no time at all, very easy with some common sense to get there... it looks like a long way looking at a map but its simple, did 32-33 mph all the way to jareds island.... the hay island area, stevens bay, up around miles bay area , sunset channel area, I had no problems at all, only spot i saw if the water would have been up 2 feet could be trouble was leaving government dock and hang a right heading due east OR the entrance to obabikon lake which everybody and their grandmother knows about, i got stuck there doing a 1/2 mph"
6737217,NETim1187,2023-05-06 12:55:00,166,"I don't mean to scare anyone. LOTW is wonderful, wonderful place to visit let alone fish. Just gotta be careful is all. Mapping GPS is more than a luxury IMHO. I have a handheld GPS as a backup to my MFD's in the boat. I like redundancy. A spare prop, hub and tools are a good idea regardless. The rock I encountered, ""dry dock rock"" as my Dad called it, was a big booboo on my part. The lake was pretty high that year and I KNEW there was a rock in that area. I slowed down and was looking for that rock. About then, BOOMP! We slid right up on it. It was a very considerate rock though. There was a little notch in the rock that the prop and lower unit fit into nicely so they weren't touched at all. I've run up the lake from Morson to the Falcon Island/Tug Channel area many, many times with no issues but we're following the ""south track"" for the most part, so it's pretty safe. I've got a track in the MFD's that I follow too. It's about a 30 mile ride and so very, very gorgeous. I wouldn't be too nervous about the ride from Morson to Obabikon. Of course, I am very, very brave with mapping GPS in the boat. The first time I went to LOTW, decades ago now (1982), we pulled into the parking lot at Jake's in the Angle. There was a brand new Lund with a brand new Yamaha on it with the lower unit blown off. I'll never forget that sight. Welcome to LOTW!"
6737229,JHuheey,2023-05-06 14:16:00,70,"Over the years, I've grown to respect those who venture out onto big water. My boat is a 16.5 ' Lund that's pretty small, but handles big water pretty well. It's no ""storm boat"" like we used to go to International Falls for church on Sundays when I was a kid living on an island on Rainy Lake. I've got a good gps mapping system, and always use care when traveling around on new water, so I don't anticipate any problems. But I've always found that the best way to avoid problems is to be prepared Starting to plan a trip for my brother and I to Obabikon for next year, so I have lots of time to get ready"
6737241,NETim1187,2023-05-06 15:14:00,166,Good for you! I'm sure you'll have a great time.
6737261,Bill Krejca,2023-05-06 18:59:00,6107,"Never stayed directly on the island, however I have spent some time on the island over the years for various reasons, meeting friends, etc. Location is superb for most fish species. Scenery from the island is fantastic, Jared is a very honest, sincere individual whom you will like, treats folks well. Always a place to fish depending on wind direction. Study a good 6214 map(besides GPS chart) each time before moving on the water, all reefs are not buoyed, but most all are shown on map. Bill"
6737365,JHuheey,2023-05-07 09:50:00,70,"Thanks for the map information, it always helps to have a good nav chart in your hands."
6736799,Yellowfin123,2023-05-03 16:47:00,2182,"i called obabikan oct of 2021 but they had just shut it down early, we fished the area and I walked around the empty camp to check it out, thats where I'll be heading next for LOTW, best location in sabaskong bay IMO, miles bay right there, obabikon lake, they have a prime spot and home base"
6736813,Golden Eagle,2023-05-03 18:28:00,2642,"Were you aware ahead of your visit that you'd be staying in the last available cabin and it was not the best the camp had to offer? From 1983 through 1986, I fished a super lake that had me staying in a less than desirable cabin. Fishing was great. A new cabin was constructed for the 1987 season. The old cabin was by far better than sleeping on the ground as I did from 1959 through 1971 while on camping/fishing trips."
6736817,Old Timer,2023-05-03 18:54:00,255,"Repeat customers often reserve a particular cabin at their favorite resort. The leftovers go to newbies. Over the years I went to one camp where all guests were assigned cabins upon arrival. No cabin could be reserved. The practice never bothered me, but still kinda unusual."
6736819,muskyman73,2023-05-03 19:05:00,401,"No complaints here, only happy times and great fishing"
6736853,gowrlop,2023-05-04 06:48:00,109,Great camp with wonderful owners and staff. The camp is situated on a great part of the lake that offers multi species fishing at it's best. I truly enjoyed everything about the camp and would highly recommend it. Roger Brown
6736919,Obabikon,2023-05-04 13:00:00,2370,"Very sorry to hear this. I truly am. We have rebuilt 4 cabins since covid began. Since taking over the resort, I had the goal of all new cabins before I turned 50. We have now completed 7 of the 9 cabins. The two remaining were the best cabins at the time. We are working on it, and I do appreciate the feedback. If you ever do decide to give us another chance, please email me, and mention this. We will do everything we can to make it right. There is no doubt that not all of our cabins were as high quality as we would prefer. I feel much more confident that they are now. That said, we will still continue to make improvements each year."
6737039,JHuheey,2023-05-05 09:59:00,70,"I was looking at the location of the resort on Google Maps, and discovered that it is on an island. How do guests get there from Morrison? I assume you could take your own boat and just leave your vehicle and trailer somewhere in Morrison. Looks like a fairly long run from Morrison - Those of you who have been there, was there somewere you could safely leave your car &trailer for the week?"
6737049,emma17,2023-05-05 10:22:00,436,As I recall we left our truck/trailer at Gill's Morson Marina. Very safe. They helped w a flat tire too. About a 30 minute pleasant boat trip (assuming calm water).
6737055,Obabikon,2023-05-05 10:48:00,2370,"You have a couple options... our main parking is now at Grassy Narrows Landing, but we still use Gill's Morson Marina regularly. Both are very safe options for parking. The ride to the camp is right at 8 miles... it takes 20-25 minutes depending on wind."
6737087,JHuheey,2023-05-05 15:06:00,70,Thanks Emma & Obabikon for the info.
6736469,leachmin&worm,2023-05-02 08:24:00,32,"My wife, daughter and I are traveling to Canada visiting Amason's Obabikon resort the third week of July. I would like to know if there are any thumbs up on this place as well as what to prepare for on this type trip. Been fishing in Canada for 20 plus years. Fishing with my daughter many of those trip, but my wife never."
6736485,WalkOff,2023-05-02 09:27:00,5,"I have been there three times, twice in July, once in August. I have taken a variety of family members including my wife and kids. Jared runs a top notch operation. The fishing is amazing. We would usually jig for walleye until it was time for shore lunch, then cast for muskie, pike and bass in the afternoons. Evenings we would either cast or jig depending on the mood. We never had trouble finding fish. The food was terrific. A great thing about that area is that there are multiple places to go so that the wind was never really a factor-if it was blowing hard you could find a protected spot to fish. Out of all the places I have been fishing in Canada, that is by far my favorite. I love the location and the fishing but Jared really knows how to take care of you."
6736501,RichA$1970,2023-05-02 10:15:00,1159,"Looks like a great resort and I’ve seen nothing but good feedback, just wish it was housekeeping plan vs American (**** those lazy fat Americans haha)."
6736517,1shooter,2023-05-02 12:03:00,1493,I have been there 24 times over the years. Jared and family run a great camp. The staff there is excellent as well. We have never had a problem finding fish and with all the islands you can usually find a place out of the wind.
6736523,MN_Moose,2023-05-02 12:16:00,964,The owner posts on this board frequently. While I've never been there I'm confident that you'll have an excellent vacation.
6736583,jimwalleye,2023-05-02 18:21:00,30,"Stayed there with my wife a few years ago, the cabin if you'd call it that was terrible. Sorry but it was not what I expected for my wife and I. Perhaps ask for good accomodations maybe we got the old run down cabin. We were very unhappy with the cabin, the resort was fine but cabin was a large dissapointment."
6736649,kayakmatt,2023-05-03 06:49:00,105,"Ok cabins. Ours had a nice little deck very close to the water with a nice view. Ok camp boats, could use some upgrades, and maybe they have been since 2019. Most guests had their own boats. On the other hand, the people were outstanding. Jared was genuine about guests having a great trip. Food was really good. We had a excellent fish fry evening. On a beautiful evening, all the guests ate outside on the huge deck with a beautiful view. Met some really friendly people. My wife and I caught plenty of fish. I will definitely be back some day when I can bring my own boat during my soon to be retirement."
6736651,Hook_settr,2023-05-03 07:01:00,127,"These are my thoughts as well. If I didn’t already have a great relationship with a nearby resort, I would be booking with Jared. We do all of our fishing in his area anyway!"
6736653,mlure,2023-05-03 07:05:00,15,One of the very best camps on the lake. Great people.
6736729,Old Timer,2023-05-03 11:23:00,255,"Why do posters give camp references when they've never been there? Seems to me a a poster should provide when they fished a camp and how many trips they've made before giving a nod for a particular lodge. I also like to know if a poster has any affiliation with the lodge and whether he/she paid full freight for the trip, on was on some sort of freebie or Daddy trip. It makes a difference. As for Obabikon, I was there one time 40 years ago in September. No complaints. But too long ago to give a fair, current reference. However, I do remember they had better dock fishing than most lodges I've fished. I paid the listed price, ate their meals and fished from my own boat. I recall catching a goodly number of slicers. I'd consider going to this lodge again based solely on my one trip there."
