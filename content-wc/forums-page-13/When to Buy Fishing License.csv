6739289,lmoore,2023-05-17 12:01:00,40,"No reason not to, saves messing with it on the trip. That is assuming you can for whichever province your headed to. I've had my Manitoba license for a month or so, they let you buy before the season opens now but you used to have to wait until whenever the season opened towards the end of April. Not sure what other provinces do as far as that goes."
