6738045,bearplott,2023-05-10 08:41:00,5,Been a few years since I've been there. I'll look for it.How far west have you caught crappies?
6737891,NM_Trout,2023-05-09 10:37:00,1094,I agree. The little village area of Quibell (sp?) is picturesque.
6737899,prov1800,2023-05-09 11:40:00,5010,This year when iam out on Clay lake I will go to far end where bridge went out last year should be quite the sight and of course a awesome trip of about 25 miles to that spot.I can continue with my boat project as I picked up my vinyl this morning..Of course had to take another awesome pick of Eagle from bit higher up.No wind today and wished my boat was ready.Looks so awesome.Grabbed a pic on way home of Wabigoon River by rail road Bridge.Amazing the different water levels year by year.Very low this year compared to last year.
6737905,Eckohlt,2023-05-09 12:01:00,3685,"Eagle ice free,,,it's a go there,25 miles on clay must be worth the ride,fish must be stacked there!"
6737921,bearplott,2023-05-09 13:31:00,5,Where is Red Ivy's cabin? I am heading up to Jack Pine Joe camp next Saturday. Right at the entrance into Segise Bay.
6737937,prov1800,2023-05-09 15:01:00,5010,Instead of turning right after cooper's rapids to go toward Segise Bay hang a left there you should be able to see the cabin
6737967,prov1800,2023-05-09 18:05:00,5010,Looked like if to me but better check with Gord first.25 miles of pure nature and different shoreline.Dont have to go 25 mi to find stacked fish as there very close to camp to.
6737971,Eckohlt,2023-05-09 18:34:00,3685,"Can't see any ice,don't need to check with gord,she is ice free."
6737973,Eckohlt,2023-05-09 18:35:00,3685,Lotta water on clay never ending!
6737977,prov1800,2023-05-09 18:46:00,5010,"Beautifull ride,once of Clay it's narrow for miles.Current all the way lots of fish everywhere.Not very busy.25 mi to get lost in"
6737981,Eckohlt,2023-05-09 18:57:00,3685,Sounds like my kind of lake.
6736541,prov1800,2023-05-02 13:03:00,5010,So your trying to kill our seagulls.No matter what anybody thinks which is fine with me it's a amazing body of water and just on a fishing perspective it's one of the best.There are some truly huge fish in there with all the species.
6736971,NM_Trout,2023-05-04 18:39:00,1094,Yeah... not interested in eating. Just catching. We admired the falls from the road last year and wondered if we would be trespassing should we hike down and fish below them. Going to have a whole day to kill on the drive from Ft. Francis to Red Lake and thought about wetting a line between those two points as we drive up.
6736973,Eckohlt,2023-05-04 18:49:00,3685,"Brings lots of tackle,might be a few snags at the bottom of those rapids,and I mean lots of tackle!!!you might be better off going to a casino and double your money."
6736975,prov1800,2023-05-04 19:00:00,5010,Awesome fishing just past the falls.just park on road and go under railway bridge a bit further to the rocks.Be good this year as water is low and your jig would do 100 mph down river in current.Fished there lots when my kids were younger.Slip bobber works good keeping jig out of rocks.You can adjust it till its just right
6737121,NM_Trout,2023-05-05 20:02:00,1094,Thanks. We will put them all back. I'll take a picture of any with three eyes :-)
6737123,prov1800,2023-05-05 20:21:00,5010,Lol.no 3 eyed walleye there.They all will look like normal walleye.There will large numbers and large fish.Just stop at McDs and grab some fish burgers for lunch.Give me a heads up how you make out.
6737143,Skywagon,2023-05-06 05:59:00,1106,Here is something that recently popped up in regard to the mercury contamination of the Wabigoon river.
6737149,prov1800,2023-05-06 06:26:00,5010,"It's a shame what they did.I remember reading they actually buried mercury near the Grassy Narrows reserve.i worked just south of the reserve for the CNR back in the 80,s and I know the people drank the water from the Wabigoon and don't think they had a very good water system in those days."
6737549,bigstorm2,2023-05-08 05:53:00,33,"I fish out of a resort on Grassy Narrows for a week every summer, we fish the English River system from Grassy Narrows up to Menard Falls with many spots in between (including where the Wabigoon comes into the English). We have been fishing this system for a week every summer for close to 20 years While we do spend most of our time in the English River, we have spent a few days in the Wabigoon but there is only so far up we can go before encountering a set of falls. We generally catch smaller fish back there and a lot of Pike"
6737555,prov1800,2023-05-08 05:58:00,5010,Some pretty country in that area especially by the falls
6736055,N_of_Quibell,2023-04-30 21:11:00,151,"Mercury does not move fast - it generally attaches to clay particles and settles out. Clay Lake is a major sink for much of the mercury, which is getting buried in the lake sediments. But I think monitoring is showing in moving downstream over time, albeit amazing slowly. Floods like last spring could be a good thing if it helps bury the contaminated sediment, or a very bad thing if it mobilizes it. There are remediation plans being discussed, such as bringing sediment from Lake Wabigoon to Clay Lake, or dedging the contaminated sediment, but none seem very practical at this point. Dedging worked fairly well here in WI for PCBs in the Fox River, but the problem with the Wabigoon is much of the mercury appears to now be in the flood plain and not practical to dredge. It seems to have taken a while, but it now appears to be on the government's radar."
6736063,Skywagon,2023-05-01 05:13:00,1106,"There is endless amounts of information on the mercury contamination of the Wabigoon system. The Grassy Narrows Reserve has been the focal point, here is one article. https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thund...tudy-1.6387194 As John mentioned, the next issue coming down the pike is that there is a proposal to bury high-level nuclear waste at the headwaters of the Wabigoon river."
6736095,nitroman,2023-05-01 06:25:00,368,Over the years we have stopped there on the way to camp. One year we were fishing below the falls catching pike like mad. A local stopped to warn us not to keep or eat anything we caught there. We never did as we just fished it to pass some time before we could get in to camp.
6736099,Knutson21,2023-05-01 06:32:00,348,We are part of a group that has a cabin on the Wabigoon. We park and launch at North Star Lodge on Clay lake and travel 18 miles down the river to our cabin. It was built in 1937. My Grandmas cousin just passed away last year at 91 years old and he ate walleyes from there multiple times a year for the past 70 years. It could be the thousands of beers he has washed it down with that kept his system clean. LOL. I have been going there off and on since 2007 my believe is that a few walleyes every couple of years is not going to kill me. I am sure I am doing a lot of other things in my life that is way worse.
6736113,prov1800,2023-05-01 07:06:00,5010,"Thx for that post.Like you said there are other things we eat that are probably not up to par with all the pollution falling to the ground.I did a lot of guiding for Northstar and Big Canon Lake Lodge.Always told my guests about the mercury when we did shorelunches.Used to go to Segise Bay for shorelunch fish,as you probably know has clear water and current goes out of that bay.Fishing Clay Lake and the river is probably some of the best fishing you will get in my opinion.Lot of beautifull shorelines,and very easy to get out of bad weather.Also has a great crappie population.Iam lucky enough that I have a couple of weeks guiding coming up there and always look forward to it.Where is your cabin.I probably know you guys."
6736155,Yellowfin123,2023-05-01 09:33:00,2182,john you crack me up
6736167,Knutson21,2023-05-01 09:57:00,348,"John, We are in Red Ivy's Cabin. We have talked with you before about being affiliated with them while at Norther Lights and the all Canada show."
6736181,prov1800,2023-05-01 10:26:00,5010,Right.i knew it.Be out there soon.Things are melting
6736185,prov1800,2023-05-01 10:27:00,5010,Glad to hear that.hope it brightened your day up.
6736539,krazyk711,2023-05-02 12:49:00,26,Wood pulp... tried them once...at least the seagulls ate good !!!
6735999,NM_Trout,2023-04-30 14:59:00,1094,"I noticed last year when driving to Red Lake (when 105 was washed out), we crossed the wabigoon river. There were some falls just east of Quibell. Anyone ever fish this river?"
6736023,N_of_Quibell,2023-04-30 18:29:00,151,"If I read the following consumption advisory correctly, there is no safe level for the sampled walleyes from 609 (""Lower Falls"") down to Clay Lake because of mercury contamination:https://www.ontario.ca/page/fish-con...rt?id=49589324 This no doubt discourages some people from fishing for ""eaters"" in this stretch (I know it has me), although I have heard from the locals that fishing there can be very good."
6736027,prov1800,2023-04-30 18:34:00,5010,Fishing is awesome.Ive ate walleyes from the whole system and know many people that still do.No I'll effects that iam aware of.You would need to launch at North Star Lodge or stay there.Not much better fishing than Clay Lake.
6736029,v-bay gord,2023-04-30 18:43:00,3168,There's nice fish in those waters......I wouldn't eat them myself.
6736035,prov1800,2023-04-30 19:04:00,5010,Mercury scare was a longggg time ago.Where is this mercury now.If it travells like it seems it does it will be in a lot of the system.The English and into the Winnipeg River into Lake Winnipeg and into Hudson Bay.Rainy River is also polluted as is LOTW.Where does that flow to.Everyone fishing these areas is eating mercury Lets toss in a nuclear waste site close to Dinorwic lake and see what happens.
6736037,v-bay gord,2023-04-30 19:24:00,3168,"So much in a few sentences....but let's start from the top. Mercury, not a big deal but I do have a problem eating fish from water that looks and smells like pulp mill. Prefer my Eagle Lake fish, thanks."
6736041,prov1800,2023-04-30 19:44:00,5010,You don't like the history lesson Gord.How do you know what they smell like.You havnt havnt been there in years have.Doesnt smell anymore and water is murky like Wabigon but even that's cleared up.I could fry you up some Mercury walleye and Eagle walleye and you wouldn't know which is which
6736045,Old Timer,2023-04-30 20:11:00,255,"Like my moniker suggests, I've been around a while, a long while. No way would I eat fish from the Wabigoon River. In fact, I wouldn't even fish the Wabigoon. Back in the 60s Barney Lamb owned a go-to lodge in Ontario Ball Lake Lodge on the English system. He lost it all because of Mercury. And the local native community suffered horribly from mercury poisoning. Don't believe me? Look it up. And Mercury never leaves the system. Go fish elsewhere."
6736049,N_of_Quibell,2023-04-30 20:30:00,151,"Old Timer, as much as it grieves me to say so, I have to completely agree. I have owned property within walking distance of the Wabigoon for 20+ years, and I have yet to wet a line there. And the most recent studies indicate the mercury is still there in the flood plains and slowly being mobilized back into the river. And lord knows how much mercury was mobilized from the Clay Lake sediments by last spring's flood - and washed downstream to Grassy Narrows and the like. And the suffering you allude to continues...."
