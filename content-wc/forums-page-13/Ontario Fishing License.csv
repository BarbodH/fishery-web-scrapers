6738825,jabecker,2023-05-14 20:09:00,118,"I just did this a few hours ago. As long as you have already ordered your outdoors card, simply log on to their site. I did mine by phone and it asked for email address and it did facial recognition and I logged in. Your info is al ready saved. Just scroll down to what license you need and print off a paper copy of the license. I also saved mine and my 3 kids license under photos for a back up"
6738827,jabecker,2023-05-14 20:12:00,118,You can use your old number from your outdoor card and just renew on line also. Your info should still be on line
6738829,NSXNeal,2023-05-14 22:16:00,3,"My understanding is............ a good quality printout of both your outdoor card purchase receipt and your fishing permit purchase permit is acceptable while awaiting physical receipt of the item(s).I usually print and take two copies, one for tackle box and one for backup in case. The physical card seems to show up in your mailbox a day after you leave for fishing"
6738837,nitroman,2023-05-15 06:06:00,368,Printed copy of receipt for OD card purchase and license will work just fine as long as you have it on you.
6738845,Bill Krejca,2023-05-15 06:50:00,6107,"License will have the Outdoor Card info on it, as I remember. Redundant, but not uncommon when govt involved system. Bill"
6739069,Bakefish,2023-05-16 07:53:00,1077,"Got stopped by a game warden last year and he said he didn't need to see the outdoor card. You need an outdoor card to get a license, so that makes sense."
