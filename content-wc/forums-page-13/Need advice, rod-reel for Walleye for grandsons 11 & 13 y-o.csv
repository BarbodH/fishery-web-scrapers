6736559,GreatWhiteNorth517,2023-05-02 15:15:00,286,I love the Mr. Walleye series by Norsemen Outdoors. I held one of these in one hand and an Eyecon in the other and liked the Mr. Walleye better. Cork handles (except for trolling rods which have foam cuz the fork doesn't survive life in a rod holder) stainless steel guides with no inserts to break or fall out. Many lengths/ actions/ lengths even technique-specific models. All designed by Gary Roach. Nuff said!
6736569,CI_Guy,2023-05-02 16:24:00,2118,It was easier teaching my grandkids to use a spinning reel at the age of 4 than it was to teach their fathers to use a spincast at the same age. I used ice fishing rods to start them fishing. 1/2 hour of casting at a 5 gallon bucket in the yard and they had it figured out. I agree with teaching them to close the bail by hand before reeling in.
6737909,LittleBait,2023-05-09 12:27:00,37,"US80XD-CP, medium size, easy for anyone rt handed to hold in rt hand to cast and battle fish, reel with left hand below the rod handle, 6 ' medium spinning rod."
6738137,valley366,2023-05-10 14:29:00,193,"A lot of good recommendations out there. I like to buy decent gear that doesn't break the bank. There are a lot of rods in the $50-70 range that will fit the need nicely. Cabelas Series rods, Bass Pro rods, Ugly Sticks and Berkley are all capable rods in that price point. 6'6"" Medium Light is what I would target. Like others say in the fast action with decent backbone.For spinning reels again there are a bunch in that $40-60 range that fit nicely. Again the big box store brands along with your major brands. Something in the 1000 series or up to a 1500.I have also been playing with Kastking reels on my ice fishing rods. My experience has been positive with the 500 series reels. I know they make a 1000 series reel that I might play with."
6738167,drlee,2023-05-10 17:37:00,409,"Remember that within the blink of an eye they will be 16, 18, 20. Buy for the long haul. 6""0 to 6""6. Medium Light. Spin cast reel.Shimano has many options. Look at rod/reel combo's. Best of luck! You are going to love fishing with grandkids."
6738237,last chance,2023-05-11 06:59:00,3262,"most of all you don't want to buy something that will cause him problems or something that will need upgraded in a couple of years. get him a good mid range Shimano reel with the ugly stick gx2 6'6"" medium spinning rod and it won't take long before he can use the spinning reel like a pro. the medium gx2 is all the rod he will need for crappie to the largest walleye. This setup will be great until he is much older. the medium is light enough for crappie but has enough backbone to handle much larger fish. on the reel, I wouldn't go any smaller than something in the size 30 reel. I have found that small reels put too much line memory in the line. the Shimano Sahara 3000 will make a good reel, also the Sedona 3000, and others around the same price range. you may also want to take a look at some Daiwa reels in the same price and size range."
6738367,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2023-05-11 20:11:00,240,"I agree, if the kids are novices. For sentimental reasons, I still bring an old Abu Matic 170 from the early '70s--the first reel I ever got as a gift from my dad. Casts like a dream, the drag is smooth, and I have caught many walleye up to 8 lbs, and pike up to 12-15 pounds on it. I own 3 or 4 of these reels now, having gotten a few on Ebay. For even more sentimental reasons, I spool this beauty with 8 lb. gold Stren. My dad and I loved this setup. I own more than a few expensive combos. like a St. Croix Avid or St. Croix Eyecon, with the Abu Garcia Revo STX, the Revo Premier, and the Revo Rocket. But on those beautiful mornings when I get up before the rest of the crew, and when I motor a few miles to a set of inlet rapids, I spend a few hours in the time machine, casting a floating jig and minnow with the old reliable Abu Matic 170. That will never change. I guess I took a lot of time to recommend these old-school spincast reels to you. Have a great trip this summer, and I hope to read a trip report from you later this summer!!"
6738381,Da' Walleye Assassun,2023-05-11 23:04:00,358,Great story. Those old Abu Matics were a quality reel.
6739059,lmoore,2023-05-16 07:22:00,40,"Took my first trip north when I was 12. Used a Berkley Cherrywood spinning rod that I already had and a couple weeks before the trip my Dad took me to Cabelas and helped me pick out a new Shimano reel for it. I can tell you that I remember the excitement of picking that reel out more than I remember most of the fish I caught or lost on that first trip. If possible, I highly recommend having the kids involved in choosing it. I also caught my first 28""+ Walleye on that rod, if you are looking for a reasonably priced one I think they still sell those for around $25 and they can definitely hang with big walleye."
6736131,NM_Trout,2023-05-01 07:42:00,1094,"My kids started fishing with my hand-me-down rods. Quality rods, but nothing anybody was going to get upset about when tips got broken off (which they did). I think of far better importance is the quality feel of the reel. You can get exceptional reels for $100 or less. Good luck! I hope at least one, if not all of then fall in love with fishing. Nothing better than fishing with a kid / grandkid."
6736133,Cutting Edge Official,2023-05-01 07:51:00,242,"You nailed it....closing the bail by hand should always be done....I also kinda lift my rod tip to tighten the line to get rid of the slack while closing the bail by hand, which becomes second nature very quickly... Also, most spinning reels today have instant anti-reverse which prevents the rotor from spinning backwards like spinning reels of the past used to do, which contributes to wind knots forming...with the instant anti-reverse and flipping the bail by hand with slight tension, wind knots are almost non existent in my experience....trust me, it isn't rocket science either...my two sons learned this at the age of five..... The difference between today and when I was young in the 60s, is that close face or spincast reels were common for not only kids, but many adults were using them back then as well. Over the many following years spinning reels have become much more technologically advanced with instant anti-reverse and better line management systems that, what was a problem 50 years ago is much less today...I would start almost any child past the age of around six with spinning gear without question....most pick it up very quickly! Teach anyone to start reeling with tension on the line, this will eliminate wind knots...cranking the handle to flip the bail close and reeling in with slack line is one of the main causes of wind knots!"
6736145,adempsey2.0,2023-05-01 08:50:00,611,"Let them go with you and choose their own. Sure, they may not pick the ideal rod, but who cares? They will still catch fish. I have fond memories of picking my own rod/reel/lures when I was a kid."
6736213,MrSimon,2023-05-01 12:36:00,922,"Whatever you get, make sure they are fast action and not too noodly. You want them to feel bites and have enough backbone to set the hook. Don't skimp. Get the best rods that are reasonably in your budget."
6736237,staker1875,2023-05-01 13:57:00,13,"Your kids are old enough to learn on spinning gear. Skip the spincast and invest an hour or two with them before the trip showing them how to use it. I agree with the advice of buying decent, but not top tier equipment. They don't know the difference, and let them catch the bug first before dropping good money. These rods can eventually become backups if things go well! I think Bass Pro has some solid combos out there for 80-100. Wouldn't go much cheaper than that though because the quality can get suspect. Most of their stuff is subcontracted out to major fishing brands so you are probably getting something from pure fishing or Lews just branded as bass pro. Scheels is another good place to look."
6736321,eyemike,2023-05-01 20:01:00,233,Get them spinning rods and reels. Medium light. Spend what you can afford. I had my daughter using a spinning quite young. Her first trip to Canada she was 9. Go with a good mono in the 10 lb. range. Take plenty of extra line and have fun with the kids.
6736343,rather-be-fishin,2023-05-01 21:54:00,429,"THANK YOU ALL for the great advice!!! This is very helpful & much appreciated! So, let the shopping begin! The grandsons are big into baseball, so their summers & weekends are tied up with that & they have limited time to go fishing. So, we are going to Lac Seul the end of August. I am hoping to get them out fishing here in NE MN a few times before the big trip! Their Aunt & Uncle, from Phoenix, AZ who LOVE to fish Lac Seul are going too! It will be a BLAST watching the grandsons CATCH those BIG FAT Walleyes!!! It is going to be FUN family fishing trip making memories to last a lifetime & hopefully some future fishing buddies for me!

6736347,Cutting Edge Official,2023-05-01 21:59:00,242,Sounds super fun....hope you guys enjoy your time together and have a blast!
6736477,Roland,2023-05-02 08:56:00,40,"So I started a tradition with my grandkids, up to 10 years old I had them use some Berkeley Lightning rods I bought several years ago with shimano Sahara reels. On their 10th birthday they get from Grandpa their first fishing rod, a 2 piece IM8 or in the case of the last one‚Äôs bday this year they got a Berkeley lightning rod, 6‚Äô6, 2 piece, medium-light, fast action and a Pfleuger president reel. It‚Äôs about $80-$100 depending on any sales going on.This is a good all around setup for jig fishing, Lindy rigging, trolling spinners, and bobber fishing. I put 8lb mono Suffix line and a 3 foot vanish leader with a bead and swivel and then tie on a jig since that is what I do most with the grandkids. I like this setup too so when we have to re-tie I get to teach them a couple different fishing knots and how to tie them properly.When they turn 16 the get their second rod from Grandpa, and I invest a lot more. I get them a 6‚Äô6 St Croix Tournament Legend, medium-light, fast action rod, and for my first two grandkids who turned 16 they got the Shimano Symmetry reels. This combo was about $200-$230. I put mono backing and Fireline Crystal with a fluorocarbon Vanish leader, bead, swivel and jig. I would the rig up the rod they got at 10 strictly for bobber fishing.All my grandkids learned using the spinning reel. On our trip we take with the kids and grandkids I would take them out individually for a couple of hours and focus my time with them learning how to fish with the spinning rig and usually after 2-3 sessions they had it down. When they were under 10 I would be close by to help steady the rod. It seemed at about 10 they had enough strength and skill to handle it on their own.Lots of great recommendations in all these posts and I hope you will have a blast. Nothing much more exciting to me than to hear that little voice in the boat yell ‚ÄúFish On!‚Äù that first time they hook up by themselves."
6736537,krazyk711,2023-05-02 12:48:00,26,"Realistically a good long lasting outfit is the way to go. St. croix triumph TSR66mlf 110.00 and a Diawa exceler 2500 80.00 with 10# braid ,go power pro, and run a 15# flouro leader it can conquer just about any eye or pike he'll encounter. he'll have a great time with anything he catches....enjoy !!!"
6735979,Eckohlt,2023-04-30 12:03:00,3685,"Start the young guy out with a GLX loomis,he will love it,in fact get him 2,the put a okuma c-30 on them for reels,ya can't go wrong with that combo."
6735985,last chance,2023-04-30 13:32:00,3262,"please don't just get them a cheap setup. but don't break the bank either. As for a nice rod for the price, an ugly stick gxe spinning rod will serve great for years. then after they get a little experience with it they may want to move up to more expensive rods but really there is no need. this rod works great on panfish or even large fish if the drag is set right. I used this rod for saltwater with 30# braid in the 8' and 9' and caught some nice redfish and black drum that pulled the end of my rod back under the boat many times and never had a break. but I also use the 8' for gills and bass fishing in farm ponds. it is limber for a medium but stronger than anyone would expect. it only cost 39.99. then match it with any good 60.00 or 70.00 spinning reel. don't get a small or large reel as something in the 3000 range and they have a setup for all types of fishing. I like Shimano reels but there are a few good brands out there. I started fishing with the Zebco 202 reel and used that type of reel until I got out of the marine corps. then I went salmon fishing in Michigan and bought my first spinning reel a Mitchal 308 and started to enjoy fishing even more. but now I have moved on to even better reels. don't get me wrong the 308 was a great cheaper reel that I used for several years. a spinning reel is a little harder to learn but it is a much better reel to use. I started my 13 yr old granddaughter out on an old 300 baitrunner and she had very little trouble even using 6# line. she uses a Shimano Syncopate 3000 now and it works great. but later she will get a much better reel if she wants."
6736001,Da' Walleye Assassun,2023-04-30 15:29:00,358,A Zebco 33 reel is $25 at WalMart and includes the line. I never saw a bird's nest on a spincast reel. I have seen plenty on a spinning reel.
6736009,RichA$1970,2023-04-30 15:45:00,1159,"Ugly stick 6‚Äô elite spinning combo with 8# mono should do the trick. Also, I would take them to a pond and have them cast a silver minnow a lot just to get the hang of things. If they get hooked then these will serve as good back-ups if they want something better in the future. I‚Äôd have a back up for them just in case."
6736015,Eckohlt,2023-04-30 17:12:00,3685,"The spin cast has a cover over the line,you have to look inside to see the eagles nest."
6736017,rschoening,2023-04-30 17:33:00,278,Also unmatched for line twist
6736033,birddogger,2023-04-30 19:02:00,43,"If you're casting,get them sincast reels. If you're backtrolling ,get them spinning reels. I have 6 grandsons and primarily backtroll. They all start( At age 3-4 or so) with cheap spincast and by age eight handle and prefer spinning reels. Nothing expensive."
6736039,SweetD,2023-04-30 19:43:00,243,Medium/Medium light fast/extra fast tip spinning combo off the shelf. Can find a decent rig for $50-$75 that will catch plenty of fish if they are on them. Let them work their way up from there but to start with a St Croix legend rod just doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. I‚Äôm in the camp of giving them solid equipment but a $200-$300 combo rig seems completely crazy to me. What happened to letting a kid work to get better stuff vs handing it to them on a silver platter. Good luck
6736071,andersaki,2023-05-01 05:35:00,1426,"I just picked up a couple of spinning combos at Scheels in Eden Prairie. They are 6'6"" IM6 rods with President reels for 99 bucks. They also have less and more expensive combos. They're perfect for grandkids and guests at my cabin. Maybe consider checking out L&M in Virginia, they usually have a pretty good selection this time of year."
6736075,last chance,2023-05-01 05:40:00,3262,"if a spinning reel isn't overfilled with line they don't get a lot of bird nests. the one thing that really helps is teaching them to close the bell by hand. this prevents 90% of bird nests. what happens most time is you get 1 strand of line that sticks out past the spool when closing the bell with the handle and it gets caught up in the line going out and it pulls all the line on top of it off at once. sure a spin cast is a little easier to use but the line does tangle below the cap and also gets under the line release spool and the reel has to be taken apart to fix this. if you get a tangle with a spinning reel that doesn't get untangled after a few minutes you can just cut the line behind the tangle and continue fishing. if it's low on line it can still be used in most cases until you get home and then respool. and I do honestly believe even young people just getting started should start with proper gear and in my opinion, a spinning reel is the first place to start. the ugly stick g2x rod in 6.6 or 7' is the best all-around rod made today that doesn't cost an arm and leg. it is almost unbreakable but can be used on many different fish. then after they get older and more proficient at fishing and taking care of their gear you can move them up to much better graphite or carbon rods than glass rods, but expect to pay dearly for this upgrade. the only time I have found where the g2x could be improved is for finesse fishing walleye or bass when fishing certain baits. I have fished the walleye run up to the headwaters on the east fork of the obey River on dale hollow to trolling Erie and just about always used some type of glass rod. I am 72 and fished from the time I was old enough to remember. and I've used all types and lengths of rods over the years. and the g2x rod is as good as you can get for a young fisherperson just getting started or most other fishermen. graphite or carbon rods do have their place in fishing but sensitivity is not going to make that much difference to a young fisherperson just getting started."
6735871,rather-be-fishin,2023-04-30 07:40:00,429,I'm taking my grandsons 11 & 13 y/o for their 1st Ontario fishing trip for Walleyes on Lac Seul. They are just beginning to fish & I am looking for recommendations on what kind rod & reel to buy them? Really looking forward to introducing them to the awesome Canadian fishing & hoping to start a tradition! Thanks for your recommendations! RBF
6735885,prov1800,2023-04-30 08:11:00,5010,LOts of rods to choose from and all kinds of lengths but I recommend something like st croix eyecons in med/light in 6 ft.Very user friendly
6735909,Mojo-NC,2023-04-30 08:59:00,1929,"I had a young lady ask me the same question in the fishing section of a store yesterday and I wasn't sure how to answer without asking a her bunch of questions first. Assuming your grandsons are both right handed: Spincast reels are the easiest to use, but the angler generally holds the rod in the left hand and reels with the right. Spinning reels are slightly more complex but the angler generally holds the rod in the right hand and reels with the left. Baitcasters are the least user friendly and the angler holds the rod in the left hand and reels with the right. Part of the decision is user preference. Spinning reels also have the advantage of being able to switch sides with the reel handles. I would get something that they will grow into over time. I would recommend getting them a 6'6"" medium power spinning rod with either fast or extra fast action. Prov1800 recommended a good rod but it might be too expensive. Get them a combo of the highest quality that you can afford without going crazy. The Fenwick HMG rods are also really good for the price and paired with a Shimano Sahara, a Diawa Regal Lt or Fuego LT, or a Pfluger President reel in the 2500 size, you can't go wrong."
6735945,Franco,2023-04-30 10:32:00,107,"I see some pretty expensive recommendations for new 11 and 13 year old anglers!I would suggest the Ugly Stik Elite spinning combo set in the 6‚Äô6‚Äù length. It‚Äôs a great rod for the price and the reel will be just fine for a first reel. The combo can be had for US$90 or less.I think the Pfleuger President spinning combo is about the same price, maybe a few bucks more, but I have no experience with that rod. The reel has an excellent reputation (I have 3 of them and they‚Äôve been great)."
6735947,lionfan19,2023-04-30 10:42:00,41,I second the Shimano Sahara as a pretty good for the money reel. A rod I really like that wont break the bank is the Abu Garcia Vendetta. I have two of them in Medium Light fast action and they are ideal for jigging for walleye with soft plastics.
6735949,Da' Walleye Assassun,2023-04-30 10:47:00,358,Zebco spincast reels are the perfect starter reel for kids. Spinning reels can come later.
6735953,Walleye2242,2023-04-30 11:03:00,263,Yep...started off with the ole zebco 33 combo and did just fine.
6735961,kettyspanky,2023-04-30 11:19:00,271,I bought my son a zebco 33 combo for perch and a shakespeare open face combo for walleye. I probably had $60-$70 for the 2 of them and they worked great. He will be using them again this year.
6735973,Cutting Edge Official,2023-04-30 11:48:00,242,"I would maybe agree with this ""if"" we were talking about 4-6 year olds (which even at that age, I had my son's using spinning gear and they did great fairly quickly) but, we are talking 11 and 13 year olds..... I think most of the recommendations so far have been good advice......one thing that makes it easier for others and the op, is if the op would indicate a price range that they are trying or willing to spend.....either way, I would never start an 11 and 13 year old with a spincast....next thing you know, you are then very shortly having to spend money again to upgrade to spinning....go with spinning gear (they'll figure it out quickly) imo.....price range would help though! One thing I would say also is, I would avoid most rod and reels sold as a combo...most have either a junk rod or a junk reel...buy a rod, then find a reel to pair it with...also jmo!"
6735975,lionfan19,2023-04-30 11:53:00,41,Was thinking the same thing Cutting Edge. Some 12 year olds are practically pro's with spinning gear (Probably because when the fishing bug bites thats all they do). Also agree about most combo's.
