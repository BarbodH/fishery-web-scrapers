6737499,LittleBait,2023-05-07 19:41:00,37,"Since mostly fly-ins for 30+ years I usually have to weigh rods, rod case, reels, all tackle boxes(mostly planos clear) and lures plus plastics and tools. Normally 2-3 planos and a small walleye box and maybe a smaller grayling box. 5-6 rods with matching reels and depth finder if not in camp. Always too much!"
6737597,Camoclad,2023-05-08 07:43:00,628,"I am a chronic over-packer and I admit it! However, on the last couple of fly-in trips I have been pretty successful in getting everything pared down to meet the weight requirements and the needs for the week. I take a smaller rod and reel for walleye and a medium heavy ugly stick for pike. I have a small tackle bag similar to this: https://www.basspro.com/shop/en/bass...-tackle-system that has 3 Plano boxes. I add some pliers, and a multitool to the bottom before I put the trays in. For clothes packing, I have started saving my old T-shirts and undies and taking one for each day, then it goes in the fire at the end of the day and doesn't have to make the return trip. Usually, I bring 2 pairs of pants; if they get too gamey, I wash them in the sink with dish soap and hang them out to dry. For bedding, I sweet-talked my mother-in-law into making me a pillow many years ago that has more miles than most Delta pilots! I bring a twin fitted sheet and a blanket. Two towels and washcloths, and a pair of clean socks for each day are also standard. I have found the most critical thing for a fly-in for me is the rain gear. I have not made a trip yet where we didn't have rain 3-5 times over the course of a 7-day trip. I can wear rain gear to keep warm too. I throw in 2 books and sometimes a crossword puzzle book for the table and we work the puzzles as a cooperative group! It is fun to get everything packed, always starting with too much stuff and paring it down in subsequent repacking sessions. As others have said too, we keep a change of clothes back at the airbase for the return trip home. Since we fly, my luggage seems to be checked by TSA on every trip home. I feel sorry for the person who has to open and smell that week's worth of dirty laundry! Ha! For various reasons, I won't be making a fly-in trip for a while, you boys hold it down this summer."
6737775,pjshorthorn,2023-05-09 03:44:00,5654,And don't forget it is always handy to have a friend in the check in line with you when you are one pair of tennis shoes overweight .I wonder what the chicks behind us in line where thinking at that time. I couldn't stand the stench PjShorthorn

6736889,NM_Trout,2023-05-04 09:15:00,1094,"I've tried to narrow down the ""necessities"" too. Although it seems that manufacturers tend to obsolete some of the things that I find to be favorites. So I end up bringing a selection of new plastics, only to find that one particular color combo is the key version. So my ocdness has me overpacking for plastics. Same with jig heads. Two trips ago, chartreuse was the color. Last trip it was hot pink. I bring too many of each now. Plus spin baits, plugs and spoons. I save weight for food stuff. I have a food freeze dryer, so I freeze dry marinara sauce, carne adovada, salsa, and a few other ""heavy"" things. I pare down on my clothing. Two pairs of pants. 3 t-shirts, 4 underwear, 4 socks, two long sleeve hooded fishing shirts. I bring oxy clean and I give things a bucket wash mid trip. I've switched to synthetic fishing shirts, and they dry quickly. In all honesty, at the end of the trip, I have been known to just dump my jeans in the trash. Rods are always tricky. I only use multi piece rods. I break them down, bundle together and wrap with towels, then tie that bundle with paracord. I use a hard sided golf case as my primary luggage. Rods, rubber boots, sleeping bag and half of the fishing tackle goes into the golf case. Golf case is a bit oversized but I find that airlines don't charge extra for it (to date). One more checked bag with dehydrated food, other half of tackle, and clothing. Reels, radios, sat phone,gps,water purifier, rain gear and chargers go into carry on.We leave fly-home clothes in the car while on the trip. Once we get to Red lake we spend an hour re-packing gear into duffel bags for the float plane."
6737063,Mojo-NC,2023-05-05 12:08:00,1929,"Thanks for all of the suggestions. I'll definitely be cutting back on the amount of clothes I take with me. Ummmm tackle, probably not... I still chuckle every time I evaluate my tackle. As NM-Trout pointed out, each year a lake is a little different from the previous year. We don't troll a lot, but pretty much every bait and color we have used seems to catch fish. Every bait in the attached picture caught either a walleye or pike. For fun, every time I catch a fish while trolling I change the color and/or bait to something new. Out of all baits I've chosen, I have yet to pull anything that does not catch fish, even though some do work a bit better than others. So why bring them all? Well, just because. It's fun to mix it up when there's a good bite on. When jigging, I try to change colors, styles, and trailers to see if everything works. Catching one fish after another gets a bit monotonous after a while. I will say that pink and orange jigs tend to catch more pike, so I try to avoid those colors unless I want to catch some pike. I carry an array of Rapala, Hot 'N Tot, Flicker Shad, and Rat-L trap type crankbaits, many in-line and R-bend spinners, a bunch of spoons, and spinner rigs, etc. Even though I try to change things up a lot, each year I still come home with a bunch of baits that never hit the water. Just because I have my favorites, it doesn't mean my boat partner won't get on a good bite using something else. Of course, then I need to use something similar and I had better have one in my box."

6737305,RichA$1970,2023-05-07 06:38:00,1159,“A voice of reason” haha. I’ve fished with some who spend more time looking in their tackle box and changing out tackle and their lines in the boat then in the lake. I have 1 3600 box with 19 lures in it (mentally I want to get it down to 15) and then a small box for jigs & tackle.
6737313,Eckohlt,2023-05-07 06:58:00,3685,"I heard in Zizania you don't need poles,there's so many fish just dip the net in,and scoop!"

6737339,prov1800,2023-05-07 08:01:00,5010,Walleyes are pretty thick in there.Will need a longer handle on that net to get to the bottom.
6737401,prov1800,2023-05-07 13:25:00,5010,Your pike tackle will take-up a bigger box.I just throw muskie lures at them hoping to scare of little ones but they still will hit a big lure
6736423,bthomas3333,2023-05-02 06:58:00,465,"Im constantly trying to figure out a way to adjust to save weight for fly in trips too. Recently I have been focus on the weight of the storage gear itself. By this I mean the bags and tubes. One example is the hard sided tubes to carry rods. When I switched to a 2/3 pieces rods I was able to keep the rods in smaller lighter carrying tubes. The big plano tubes weigh 6-9lbs by themselves. Using smaller lighter tubes saved me 5 pounds and the rods are still secure. I've also switched to waterproof duffles and backpacks. These are made of PVC and save a couple of pounds on the containers themselves. The other area of savings can be on heavier items that you only need one of in the boat. The fishing tools. You one need 1 or 2 needle nose pliers and one hook cutting pliers in the boat not 4 and 2. Finally there are the clothes themselves. I used to do things like bring two extra pairs of jeans. Now I do one. 2-3 t-shirt vs 5-6. Another trick I have used a lot depending on the location is to skip the boots in favor of waterproof socks and tennis shoes. Your feet stay just as dry and warm and you dont have to wear or pack boots that weigh 5-6 lbs. Of course if you are in a muddy location or tons of weeds maybe not the best, but for a location with a clear path or boardwalks no need for big heavy boots. On the gear side it is tough because you never know what is going to work the first/second time to a single location but after 5+ trips to one place you know what works so maybe bring a couple of ""I need to try this lures"" but stick to what works. For me the biggest problem I still struggle with is when a location has 3-4-5 different species to fish for. In this case the boxes get pretty heavy. This year adding fly fishing gear to the mix will be a challenge too. B-"
6736433,icspinner,2023-05-02 07:08:00,92,"Evidently, my criteria for managing the amount of tackle I take to Canada is that if I can still carry the tackle box and rods from the boat to the cabin at night, I'm good. I have found some loss of strength as I age, I may have to make some adjustments in the near future."
6736491,prov1800,2023-05-02 09:43:00,5010,Leave your gear in the boat.Why carry it back and forth.Your in Canada no need to worry about someone taking it.

6736547,Golden Eagle,2023-05-02 14:13:00,2642,"My gear goes from the plane, to the dock, to the boat, where it stays for a week, 2 weeks and sometimes 3 weeks. Every trip. Might wear my rainsuit to the cabin if it's raining hard. The heavy jacket and hat stay in the boat so they can be put on after leaving the dock. Dress warm in a warm/hot cabin, start sweating and you'll be in for a cold ride down the lake. I'm talking about the upcoming May trip or an October trip. My rods have never been in a cabin. The last night in camp my rods, reels and other fishing gear go on the dock, ready for the plane ride next morning."

6736195,Mojo-NC,2023-05-01 11:29:00,1929,"Yesterday was an ugly, rainy day here in NC, so I dug into my Canada tackle that I keep in a storage bin in the garage. My goal was to significantly reduce my tackle for this year. Ha ha!!! I purchased a new tackle box that is smaller than what I have used previously. It is a Plano A-Series Quick Top (link) that I thought would be just the ticket for my Canada tackle necessities. I reduced the amount of jigs I bring to what would fit into a single tray in the ""quick top"" access area. In the 4 trays inside, I keep my crankbaits, spinners, swivels, weights, leaders, etc. In a second bag I have 3 additional 3600 size boxes, one with twister tails of various sizes and colors, and the other two contain all of my spinner rigs. I have a Crown Royal bag with my jaw grippers, needle nose pliers, braid scissors, retractable measuring tape, and hook cutter pliers. I have a bag of assorted plastic baits that I use as trailers on jigs and spinner rigs. I also have my portable fishfinder, transducer, LiFePO4 battery and charger. All of this has to fit inside of a metal Coleman cooler that I use to transport everything on the plane and as a cooler while we're there. It has to be 50# or less, and over the past years I've had a difficult time keeping it there. I consider all of this stuff as Canada necessities for either a fly-in trip or a drive-to lodge. We each bring 4 rods and reels and share a couple of rod carriers to bring everything on the plane. Let's hear about what you bring when you have restrictions on the amount of tackle you are allowed to carry and are not pulling your own boat. Maybe you will give me some great suggestions on how to further reduce the amount of stuff that I bring. https://planomolding.com/products/as...40468054999200https://www.scheels.com/p/lindy-rigg...578731523.html"

Then I have a small zippered tackle pouch with leaders, scissors, pliers, spare line, etc. Then I have another zippered pouch with about 8 bags of plastics. That's it. I take two main bags on the trip - both roll-top waterproof duffel bags. Bag 1 has everything that goes in the boat with me like tackle rain gear, camera, fish finder, first aid kit, other basic necessities. Bag 2 is everything for the cabin like clothes, towels, toiletries, chargers, etc. Rods go in a tube. Food gets transported in coolers to the plane, then packed in cardboard boxes for the flight. I go back and forth between going Spartan and taking next to nothing .... and taking everything in the name of comfort. HAHA. No wrong way to do it."

6736235,staker1875,2023-05-01 13:50:00,13,"I too decided to go over my tackle and whatnot this past weekend. I see it as a fun challenge to stay under 100 lbs/person (80 really when you include a case of beer, and even less with food). That being said, I don't look to cut weight on the tackle side. I don't pack in excess, but I'm not leaving that one lure at home to save 1/2 oz. Instead, I look at the low hanging fruit (i.e. that metal cooler that probably weighs a ton. I use a soft sided cooler that is large and weighs 3 lbs). I pack light on clothes since you can always wash them in a sink or shower if needed, and am very weight conscious when doing the shopping for food (lots of dried stuff and very little of the heavy, fresh stuff). Even stupid small things can add up like removing extra shoulder straps on bags that you do use or transferring food from heavier packaging into ziplocks instead. There are some great resources out there on ultralight backpacking and paddling that also translate to packing for fly in fishing. I also pre-weigh everything before we leave so there are no surprises at the scale at the dock. Fun thread and also relates to the other thread about how this trip is more than just that week in the woods. Its many days over the full year!"

Depth finders, trolling motors, batteries, battery chargers, gas cans, boat seats and outboard motors. All of this times 10 guys!!!!!!!!! Plus all the food, beer and pop and luggage. It was CRAZY!!!!!!! Now i am alone or like 2 other guys. I have a small box full of jigs, 2 UL walleye poles. A few little joe lindy rigs and some 1/4 oz weights. I have 1 small tackle box it fits in with a small tool kit and 1st aid kit. I rent boats from camp as they have such nice boats these days. I buy all groceries up there with my rum."
