6738887,prov1800,2023-05-15 09:30:00,5010,Summer must be here now.Got my floor in my boat and yesterday I got to put it in the lake.Stopped in at Clarks Norther Lights and picked up a few minnows. Was like a rookie at the launch.Backed it in perfectly.took off transom saver and mist important put plug in.Mines on rollers so I tie a rope to front post undo strap and chain then let rope go and it takes of like a rocket.Mhhh didn't take off.Forgot to take back tie downs off.Glad there was no one around to see that.lol.But pulled forward and took them off.Very calm and bluebird sky.Just a beautifull day.Trout was the main target and although I got some they were rather slow.Tried trolling UT nothing doing that so back to jigging for them which produced in around 50 ft.Hit a few mid lake humps with rock pikes in around 8 ft and had a blast catching pretty spawn smallies Every cast had 4-6 fish chasing my crank bait.Had 2 muskies eat my favorite lures so will have to replace them.Was the only boat on the lake which really doesn't bother me.First voyage was a good one.

6738927,Eckohlt,2023-05-15 12:56:00,3685,Strong coffee can really mess up launching a boat!
6738937,prov1800,2023-05-15 13:38:00,5010,All gone Larry
6738939,prov1800,2023-05-15 13:39:00,5010,Messed up my new vinyl already.lol.will be easy to clean now rather than carpet.
6738941,prov1800,2023-05-15 13:41:00,5010,Yup.Got that right.This lake is normally very quite Rich.My sanctuary.
6739033,Bill Krejca,2023-05-16 06:24:00,6107,Kinda surprised the small mouth were that active chasing lures in that cool of water. What was the water temp? Bill
6739041,prov1800,2023-05-16 06:44:00,5010,"It seems to be a normal thing Bill.Water temp was 60f.Spawned out female walleyes were there also.Nothing under 23"".Will see what happens on Saturday I might plan to be there."
6739047,Yellowfin123,2023-05-16 07:04:00,2182,"yes it can, 2 weeks ago after 7 miles of bumpy gravel road, boat in the water ready to go and forgot to put gas in the boat"
