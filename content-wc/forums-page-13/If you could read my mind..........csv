6736879,Chequamegon,2023-05-04 08:18:00,112,My tradition is to play that song on November 10th every year. Might now have to change the lyric for the bell to chime 30 times. My Dad took me to see that boat when moored in Milwaukee when I was a kid. It was impressive.
6737137,Riding high,2023-05-06 04:49:00,69,We have played Gordon every year on our way to whatever lake we stayed at in Ontario since 1991. On our 2nd set of Gordon gold and Gordon gold 2. We always called him the living legend and probably still will. He will live forever in our hearts.
6737525,Ohio fisherman,2023-05-07 23:48:00,988,"Gordon Lightfoot was a great musician - he had passion, plus tremendous natural talent, plus musical training, plus a formal music education at a great school. I love both the simplicity and the complexity in his music. He was a masterful lyricist and a great songwriter and composer. His stories are extremely well told which is difficult in the short time of a song. I have written lyrics for about a hundred songs - they will never exist outside of my own private playing. Some of my lyrics are decent, but when I listen to a G.L. song I immediately think mine should be scrapped. In a biographical documentary, he spoke of his life and behaviors and says some of what he did was shameful. Said much of his regrettable lifestyle was fueled by a lot of alcohol. Said he will no longer play some of his own songs because of what is said in the songs. His personal introspection really impressed me. On a lighter note I really enjoy listening to his music. It is really that good."
6737569,Eckohlt,2023-05-08 06:33:00,3685,Been in his footsteps thru alcohol.

6737595,Eckohlt,2023-05-08 07:38:00,3685,"Rich it's nice to be able to wake up n see the great nwo sunrise,without blurred vision.haha"
6737637,Ohio fisherman,2023-05-08 10:59:00,988,I commend you guys for beating the monkey off your backs. It is extremely difficult to do. You guys deserve to see the beautiful sunrise.

6736397,Ltrain,2023-05-02 06:03:00,4145,"He will be missed, great unique voice, great storyteller.....RIP"
6736431,Laketripper,2023-05-02 07:07:00,103,He was an icon of the Canadian music industry. A great storyteller with Home from the Forest being a good example of that and one of my favorites of his songs.
6736461,elway12,2023-05-02 07:52:00,335,Truly a legend in music. On our way up north we always have to play The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald driving into Duluth and Whispers of the North when we reach the border!
6736471,Bakefish,2023-05-02 08:27:00,1077,My sister texted me yesterday that she saw a guy who looked exactly like Gordon Lightfoot at a convention she attended. Exactly one minute later my friend sent me a picture of a concert ticket stub (Gordon Lightfoot) and asked me if I was with him at this concert. Last night I heard the news that Gord had passed. Strange days indeed. Once again I will play The Canadian Pacific Railway Trilogy once I hit 502 this fall. Tradition.
6736509,Eckohlt,2023-05-02 11:40:00,3685,Don't forget to watch for moose as your jamm'in to Gordon!!
6736805,Franco,2023-05-03 17:39:00,107,"I always play the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald while driving north on 17 and passing by, well, the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald."
