A Happy Mother's Day to my wife and her excitement over her new Ryobi battery operated chain saw! You were so excited to charge the batteries and use today! Thank you for following our life dream to Canada and raising two boys in the bush. Not only are you a special woman, your excitement of returning each year has never dimmed (21 years and still counting). You are a true northern bush woman...thank you! To my mother (in spirit), thank you for all the times you allowed me to skip my chores and sometimes school to go on fishing trips with my family, friends and neighbors. Especially, thank you for all of your encouragement and help when we made the transition to become lodge owners. We still miss you and enjoyed the time you spent with us in life and at camp. To my grandmother (in spirit), thank you for all those weekend fishing trips to the farm ponds, rivers, and Lake Erie pier fishing. You were never too tired for the long drives and inspired me to enjoy fishing from a young age. I know in my heart you are looking down from heaven wishing you could be here. I wish before your trip to heaven, we could have enjoyed one last fishing trip and shore lunch in Canada together (just like the ones you planned for me when I was growing up). In closing, Happy Mother's Day to all the mothers!"
