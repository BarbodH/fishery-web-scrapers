6738601,eyecatcher1,2023-05-13 05:53:00,323,Thanks! I'll have to give it a try this year. By hidden bay are you referring to the hole in the wall?
6738617,prov1800,2023-05-13 07:13:00,5010,I am.sorry Hole in the wall.Amazing bay..most go by it but worth the detour.I don't think many people venture in there.beautifull bay once your in there.If you fish muskie give that a try to.
6738327,prov1800,2023-05-11 16:52:00,5010,It happens.You must have the brown line on your unit to which is a safe route from Earfalls to to Siouxlookout
6738335,MikeAnkeny,2023-05-11 17:35:00,67,I don't get it about levels being low at Lac Seul. Look normal to me.https://www.lwcb.ca/waterflowdata.html
6738339,prov1800,2023-05-11 18:09:00,5010,Very low.Not much snow for melting and no rain=low water.Not just Lac Suel.All over
6738401,eyecatcher1,2023-05-12 06:06:00,323,I'll have to look for that. I've never been to Ear Falls. I do have a safe line from Sioux Lookout all the way up the east end of Lac Seul. After I hit the rock I noticed that I was just a little right of that line. I'm usually a lot left of it. The guys at Mascotto's were surprised that was the first time that I hit something in 30 years.
6738403,prov1800,2023-05-12 06:17:00,5010,You've been lucky for all those years.Ive been out of deception bay a number of times with friends from Sioux so kinda know the route.I normally don't go to far as the deception area is so good for fishing.Have you gone up the zig/zag area.Very good.The Rags this year will have to be navigated carefully.
6738409,Lmbkiller,2023-05-12 06:52:00,639,They are always low in the spring. Unless u have a winter like last winter. Hydro up there isn't required to keep above a minimum pool height so let all the water u need to let go over the winter to make the most money u can. Ferc doesn't let that happen anymore with the hydros at least in wi any more
6738415,prov1800,2023-05-12 07:05:00,5010,They keep water levels as good as they can.They do shut dams down to keep water levels where they need to be but always water going through the turbine to make power.If there is excess water they will open other dam gates.Cant just keep one water body full then other lakes will suffer.
6738453,Lmbkiller,2023-05-12 08:37:00,639,That's exactly what they want u to believe. They are money first though. Hydro takes precedence over the fishery. And it doesn't help that a good portion of water that lac seul receives also comes from lk st joseph. They can dump water out the east end of it and lac seul never sees it then
6738469,prov1800,2023-05-12 09:45:00,5010,I've fished by the dam on river from st Joe.Its controlled.Can only hold back so much water but turbines have water going through them.rest of dam was barely flowing.All dam are like that.English river below earfalls dam is up and down all the time.Low water doesn't bother me nor does high watering between is great but weather is the boss.
6738565,eyecatcher1,2023-05-12 17:14:00,323,I've only gone through the zig zag to Sen Bays a few times. I usually fish the Bear Narrows area. I guess that I should try the area near Deception instead of running 25 miles. I always see people fishing there. I won't be there until late August this year because we are taking a camping trip to Alaska in June. Water levels could change a lot at the Rags by then. Thanks for the info though!
6737943,prov1800,2023-05-09 16:04:00,5010,Got a few pictures from Wayne Clark today as he flew over Lac Suel near Mckenzie Bay.Still ice but leaving fast.He figures ice will be gone in next couple of days so that's good news for the opener.Water levels are low there.
6737953,kswalleyer,2023-05-09 16:51:00,1651,WOW that is low!
6737961,Eckohlt,2023-05-09 17:51:00,3685,Lower units are going to take a beating!
6737963,prov1800,2023-05-09 18:00:00,5010,Seen it lower 3-4 years.
6738021,eyecatcher1,2023-05-10 06:48:00,323,I hit my lower unit last August outside of Manitou Rapids. First time in 30 years that I hit something up there. I took it to Mascotto's and they said that they replaced more lower units than ever last year with the high water. They said that high water was worse than low water because everything looks so different. I never would have guessed that.
6738027,prov1800,2023-05-10 07:20:00,5010,What ever you hit will be sticking out this year
6738107,eyecatcher1,2023-05-10 12:12:00,323,I'll see it this year! The green marker on that reef was gone. With the high water I guess I was closer to it then I thought.
6738145,prov1800,2023-05-10 15:15:00,5010,On my Lowrance all markers buoys are on my map.I fish west end and although most markers are gone I see them on my map.
6738195,Lmbkiller,2023-05-10 22:02:00,639,"For reference according to lwcb website, lac seul is down approximately 3ft in elevation compared to the same time last yr. It always starts low in the spring though (under normal winter conditions). Ontario is hydro first as opposed to the states where there's maximum drawdowns which is regulated by ferc. Basically 2 different attitudes. One puts the resource ahead of money the other does not"
6738247,eyecatcher1,2023-05-11 07:32:00,323,Mine too. I guess I was just looking at the area with the high water and turned a little wider than I thought.
