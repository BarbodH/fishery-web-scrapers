6737675,Golden Eagle,2023-05-08 13:45:00,2642,"Thanks, I'll drive past Eagle May 17. Getting close."
6737685,prov1800,2023-05-08 14:17:00,5010,Very close.
6737693,v-bay gord,2023-05-08 14:49:00,3168,"Hate to point out there is ice on the west portions of VBay. Probably will be gone by tomorrow but not an ""ice out"" in my mind."
6737695,prov1800,2023-05-08 14:52:00,5010,From where I was standing there was no ice in sight.SO ice out man.Easily could of put boat in and go fishing
6737697,v-bay gord,2023-05-08 15:03:00,3168,Picture from today around 1 p.m. Could be your eyesight....
6737699,prov1800,2023-05-08 15:06:00,5010,I see open water.tough ice fishing out there don't you think.
6737701,v-bay gord,2023-05-08 15:15:00,3168,I'ld like to see you try and fish that shoreline with your boat...
6737703,prov1800,2023-05-08 15:26:00,5010,You won't see me fishing there this time of the year.Much better places to fish.Theres lots of open water around.down by panorama drive its pretty much open toward portage bay.we just have different opinions of ice out.i get excited when I see water.
6737709,mms3rd,2023-05-08 15:56:00,148,"Let's just say you're both right, or else fight it out with boat oars."
