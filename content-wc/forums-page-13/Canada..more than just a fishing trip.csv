6736031,NM_Trout,2023-04-30 18:55:00,1094,Having a kid on one of these trips elevates it to a whole new level of wonderful. Rest assured your dad and gramps loved it as much as you did.
6736211,MrSimon,2023-05-01 12:30:00,922,"Thanks for sharing. That almost made me tear up. It's a special thing, and not too many people understand. We do!"
6736239,Walleye2242,2023-05-01 13:58:00,263,Thank you. as we know.....the ones who go and really enjoy it can never explain the true meaning.
6736275,stumcfar,2023-05-01 15:53:00,451,"This will be my 30th, ""Canadian trip"". Went on a few family trips when I was young, but I organized the 1st guys Canada trip and we had 28 straight until Covid shut us down for 2 years. I really need to write down all the different guys and sons that have went over the years. The only true constant for all the trips is myself, others have come and gone and then maybe comeback, but I have had an understanding wife who lets me do this each year. Good food, card games, friendly wagers on fishing, bad storms, extreme heat, very cold, you experience it all if you go enough. Not sure what would happen if I didn't organize it. I am guessing it would probably end, but my hope if if something should happen to me a bunch will go a least one more time. With all that said, it is still a fishing trip and without the fishing it wouldn't happen!"

My first few trips centered around trips north on Hwy. 599. We stayed at a run-down cabin named ""Fisherman's Camp."" Right on Wintering Lake. The cabin, to put it kindly, was 'rustic.' But the trip to Canada, the stopping for breakfast in Grand Marais, MN, the anticipation of being at Ryden's, the speculations of how many minnows we were going to need, cleaning fish at 11:00 at night, separating those fish deemed to be 'take-home fish' and freezing them, and, of course, those midnight fish fries, and the laughter that seemed to rock the cabin. Man, it was the best of times. I think just about every guy or gal on this board can relate and could jot a few lines on their own 'first trips.' Thanks again."
6735461,Walleye2242,2023-04-28 12:48:00,263,"As I have turned 51 and have been going to canada since 1979 I have been lucky enough to experience this great traditional trip. My dad and gramps took me up at 7 years old. I have been to many lakes...drive in and fly in. My grampa was a pilot and a bush pilot at times. We also ""had"" a cabin back in illinois from 1958 to 2022. On a river with great fishing. My dad and gramps have both passed on. The memories remain. My gramps was the camp cook and the ""director"" of the trip. He was in charge. We would leave at 4am to start the drive. As a kid I remember we would ""dress"" up for the trip. I wore nice pants, polo shirt and tucked in with a belt. All the other guys did as well. I miss that these days. This trip was special and we treated it as such.1st stop was paul bunyans for breakfast in the dells. We would go to fort francis and spend the night. Drive to camp the next day. We also had 2 different tackles. 1 tackle for our cabin fishing. cheaper and took a beating. then we had our canada tackle. That was used once a year. it was our good stuff! haha. As a kid in the middle of winter my dad would call down and say...I am getting the canada tackle out if you want to go through it. I was always so excited. bring it in the house and go through our lures. oil the reels. take stock of what we had. talk about what we used and of course what we want to use. As a kid i would fill up the bathtub and run the lures through to see how i liked the action. Like a new a darn thing as a 9 year old!!! I remember all the small town stops for ice cream or candy or malkins jam. I remember as a kid i would nap across the wooden boat seat when i got tired. I remember being scared if i got a snag because i didnt want gramps and dad to stop fishing for me. I remember we all realed in when somebody ""got"" one. SHore lunches were amazing as we all know. All the banter and jokes that are played with the crew. Cards and drinks. The drive home we always stopped for a prime rib dinner. Dressed up for that as well. Thanks for listening. This will be 1st year after losing the family cabin so as the weather gets better it makes me think back to the older times."
6735465,Eckohlt,2023-04-28 12:56:00,3685,I would have liked to be in your car for the ride home and a big slab of prime!
6735475,kettyspanky,2023-04-28 13:20:00,271,"I'm with you 100 percent. I'm in the same age bracket. I started taking my son last year at age 9. I've only been to canada about 10 trips. It's not about how many we catch, it's about having fun and relaxing while on vacation. It's been alot of memories also with friends and family that have gone along. We look forward to it and can't wait for July 21st to get here so we can head out. Good luck to all that are heading north this year."
6735507,Fishquest,2023-04-28 16:19:00,89,"I'm spoiled as I live in Canada and get to spend a huge amount of time in the outdoors camping, fishing and hunting. I still look forward to every single trip and they all have memories and stories that continue on and get repeated yearly with lots of laughs. Soon enough we'll be into the next one and can't wait."
6735547,prov1800,2023-04-28 19:57:00,5010,Great write up.Just the way it should be
6735557,SweetD,2023-04-28 21:08:00,243,Kudos to you and for sharing what so many of us feel. Could not agree more about it being more than just a fishing trip. It is an annual blessing. The faces of the “group” have varied over time but we keep chugging along. I can’t imagine a life without the annual excursion to the bush in Canada. I miss my Pops being along as he passed in 2029 but always feel like when I return each year he is with me in some little way! Almost 57 and working on 32 straight years to Canada minus the “Rona Period”.PS made me snicker when you spoke of the good Canada tacke and gear vs the scrubby stuff (mostly older Canada gear) that is now used for a few local trips to farm ponds to work on the panfish). Good read.Cheers to all keeping those norhward treks alive!!!!!
6735559,SweetD,2023-04-28 21:09:00,243,*passed in 2019. Oops
6735571,RichA$1970,2023-04-29 05:01:00,1159,I have a small dedicated Canada only tackle box that I set a limit of 20 total lures max as I usually only use half of them on trips not including jigs or harnesses so before each trip I end up making a cut in some pending where I’m going.
6735591,Bill Krejca,2023-04-29 06:52:00,6107,"Echo- Thanks for the sharing. Your experiences, although not exactly same, again awaken a great past of activities long gone downstream and resonate on so many levels. Bill"
6735593,Eckohlt,2023-04-29 06:52:00,3685,"I'm with you Rich,cutting way back on tackle for the June onslaught.O'Sullivan lake is number one so far for late fall 2024,gonna do a 10 day'er,things could change as it is not right around the corner."
