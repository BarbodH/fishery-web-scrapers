550065,Ivy,2005-07-05 11:11:00,556,We used Kay-Air a couple years ago and we went to that lake. Peter Kay runs a great operation. The Cabin was fairly new and clean. Peter is a great pilot and we had a great time. There was another lake connected to that lake that we portaged to. That lake seemed to have bigger Walley on it. Send me your e-mail and I can give you more information about the lake the camp. Ivy
