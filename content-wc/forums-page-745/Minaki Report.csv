550070,Guest,2005-07-05 12:44:00,0,"Doc....my uncle just returned. Said the weather was crappy last week and the mayfly hatch was on. They were catching walleye in 10-12 feet of water pitching jig spinners to the edge of weed growth. He also landed a couple of musky on Big Sand. Said the fishing was ""average"". He also said they caught several 20 inch plus walleye up on Big Sand."
