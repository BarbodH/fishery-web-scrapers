We are staying at Goose Bay Camp and fishing out of our own boats, so our range is a little more than a camp boat. What can we expect this time of year, and has anyone been there within the last couple days?"

People in our camp thought it was slower than normal. It was our first time on the lake, so we were pretty cautious and basically divided the lake into chunks and explored and talked to alot of people. Many on here recommend a guide the first time and I think I would agree. We didn't, but I might approach my group next year about hiring someone just to drive us around and see the dangers, hot spots etc. I am truely excited about going back next year."
550098,Guest,2005-07-05 15:12:00,0,we fished that area last week and fishing was good but not as good as normal. weather hurt us a little and the mayfly hatch just started. mayfly should be in full force when you get there. you will have better success fishing in shallow water if the flys are in.
550100,Guest,2005-07-05 15:49:00,0,"Just got back over the weekend. I was at Onaway and had a slower than usual week. But like the previous posting, it was due more to weather than anything else. Don't fear the mayflies, fish in them. The fish will be feeding there too. For first timers....HIRE A GUIDE....Lac Seul is very easy to get turned around on and to be honest the maps that the lodges supply SUCK. If you don't have a good one already pick one up at the Four Seasons Sport Shop in Ear Falls, pay the bucks...they are worth it. First Hire the Guide, they will put you on fish, teach you the ropes, and cook you shore lunch which in itself is worth the price of admission. You may think you know how to fish, not this water....hire the guide. We found the fish in 66+ degree water, the main lake last week was still 63, so we found the shallower, warmer bays, and then we were in them. Good luck, know the slot rules, and throw the big ones back."
550101,Guest,2005-07-05 16:12:00,0,A gps couldnt hurt either. I wouldnt' want to fish lac seul for the first time w/o one. You can get a pretty good handheld for the ~150$ range.
550104,Guest,2005-07-05 17:24:00,0,"My family will be heading up to LS on Saturday. This will be our third year in a row. As on most lakes, weather and location is key to getting onto GREAT fishing, but we have normally found GOOD fishing in ""normal"" walleye conditions. Having said that, we normally don't fish in water over 25-30 ft and have caught large fish in 4-6 ft of water. A guide would be the best, GPS is nice, but a good map is a must. Our lodge furnishes a decent map with ""hot spots"" marked. We jig, with mostly multi-colored jigs, and have had great success with worms, leeches, and minnows. Have made trips to the middle-part of the lake and have caught bigger fish than the NW corner, but the overall numbers are about the same. Best of luck!"
550114,sirchad,2005-07-06 03:46:00,8,"Thanks for the replys. We do have a guide lined up for the 2nd day...couldn't find one for the first. Hopefully the bite is still on. I just love to fish, and get out a lot, and the fish are a bonus, but we have a few in our group that don't get to fish a whole lot and really want the fish. Getting excited...going to be a long next 2 days. Any other tips or reports?"
