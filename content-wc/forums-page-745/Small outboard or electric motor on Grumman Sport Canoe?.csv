550045,Gary_IA,2005-07-04 16:11:00,144,I have a Grumman Sport Canoe that I rarely use. My brother has bought a home on a small lake with a dock with electric power. My Grumman Sport Canoe is rated up to 5 hp. We are thinking of either a small outboard (used) or a electric trolling motor on the stern for the occasional fishing or sightseeing trip. We will be economical but prudent on our power plant. I don't keep up on outboard or electric motor developments so I am asking you guys how you would power such a boat and can you do it for a reasonable cost? The electric motor has some appeal to me if you could control the motor from any of the seats or from the center seat. What lenght shaft for outboard and electric motor? Can you modify long shaft for stern drive? What about a couple of batteries for more time on the water? What kind of controls are available for electric motors. What are your estimated costs for your options? I am looking forward to your ideas.

You would do fine w/a 12v but you need/should fasten it down somehow (in an insulated box (they make plastic)). You shouldn't need to worry much about shaft length on a stern powered electric. If it is a small lake, a 40# thrust or thereabouts would do fine. Of course, the bigger the more power/faster you'll go. You'll be surprised how fast you can go w/40# or so. It is doubltfull you'd have to worry about running the battery down if you go w/a group 25 or larger deep cycle. You can go a long way on a full charge. With either a gas or electric, you may have issues w/steering it from anywhere other than the stern but they do make extensions. Remember to ALWAYS wear your PFD (life jacket). HAVE FUN!!"
550052,Gary_IA,2005-07-05 05:33:00,144,Thanks for your response. I appreciate your input on electric motor and battery. I had intended to post enquiry in General Discussion and realized afterwards it was in the Canada Message Board. I then noticed a Boats and Motors forum and posted essentially the same message.
550066,Guest,2005-07-05 11:13:00,0,I use a 3hp with a built in tank. Works good. Just carry a small can of gas with you. I think it would be better than hasseling with a battery.
