Any reports anyone would like to share? It's been several years since I've been there and I'd like a little advice so we don't spend too much time flogging unproductive waters. As I recall the fish usually were relating to midlake humps in 20-30 feet of water-any good advice for getting on the fish quickly? Frankly the species does really matter that much-walleyes, northerns or smallies. Thanks for the input. Bill"
