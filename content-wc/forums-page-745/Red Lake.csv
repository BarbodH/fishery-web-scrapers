549932,Trailerguy,2005-06-30 08:22:00,1407,[font color=green size=3][b]Page 81 of the Ontario fishing regulation summary says: Red Lake Div. 31......Lake Trout catch and possession limit of (0)- catch and release only. Artificial lures only with a single barbless hook must be used. So the answer is yes. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby
550033,grt1,2005-07-03 16:08:00,259,"catch and release only on Red Lake but if you go under the Balmertown bridge and get lucky and get a trout, you can keep it. The MNR estimate there are only 2000 lake trout left in Red Lake, and this year they stocked the lake with 25000 fingerlings to try and bolster the stock. seems that the spawning grounds the trout have traditionally used in the west end of the lake are not allowing the eggs to fertilize or mature. this is the reason for the 0 limit"
