549829,Guest,2005-06-28 06:57:00,0,I'm headed up in 11 days and wondering if Mayfly hatch has started. I fish mainly the SW to central part of the lake.
549850,Guest,2005-06-28 12:06:00,0,"Just got back from lac seul. Fished from june 21-26. The mayflies have began to hatch in the NE corner chamberlain narrows region, which pushed the walleye really shallow (5-13 ft). We were catching good numbers and size adjacent to weed beds. We also fished Senn bay near deception bay and didn't notice the mayflied there and the fish were deeper (16-24 ft), but still biting very well."

550034,Hump,2005-07-03 16:46:00,578,I just returned from the NW section and there were a few showing up.
550054,Guest,2005-07-05 07:41:00,0,"Just got back from LS. Mayfly hatch is is full bloom. But all that does is bring the fish shallow. Tip from Guide....fish in the Hatch, that brings the big girls top side. I was up at LS last year during the hatch also and had the best fishing in 10 yrs, this year was a bit down but that was due to the wind and rainy weather not the flies."

550064,wooglin,2005-07-05 10:30:00,371,"We fished SW Lac Seul, and we caught all our fish in 10 FOW or less. Sometimes in 3 FOW. Mayfly bodies were on the top of the water, we just jigged crawlers and leeches on 1/8 or 1/16 oz. jigs. White twisters were also hot. Drift, find the fish, anchor....jig away."

550129,Guest,2005-07-06 12:00:00,0,"We would backtroll inline spinner rigs until we located active feeding fish, then jiged with lead heads with twister tails, YUM, anything with some action, tipped with live bait. We had to move it SLOW, the bites were not violent, but nibbles, but I really believe it was due to water temp and cool weather. As it starts to warm the hits will be better to feel and anywhere there is a bottom change and/or a weed bed the fish will be there. Good Luck"
