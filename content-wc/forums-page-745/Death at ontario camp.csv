The lodge owner said tornadoes came through with and a 45 year old male died from a heart attack during the storm in one of the cabins (not the one ill be staying in). That is very sad that his family lost him. I dont know who the man was nor do i know where he was from. ""Many men go fishing all of their lives without knowing that it is not fish they are after"""

550053,Guest,2005-07-05 07:31:00,0,I just got back from that area last Friday. There were tremendous straight line winds with many trees broken off. Some parts of Lac Seul look like a bomb went off. My condolences also to the family.
