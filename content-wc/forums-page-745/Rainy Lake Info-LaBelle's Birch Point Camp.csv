I've stayed at Rainy Lake Lodge(treated poorly and the cabins looked like they needed LOTS of remodeling) and Sha-Sha resort(nice cabins but they were more interested in the bar/restaurant part of their business) and Coppens Resort on Canadian side(nice people, they treated our family very well) but the walleyes ran on the small side(quite a few 14-15"" fish with a very occasional 20""+ ""eye"", maybe 1-2 per day) where ever we fished. Smallie fishing was extremely good both in numbers & size. However looking at 2006, Coppens is quite booked and I was wondering how LaBelles Camp matches up with Coppens. Same lake but miles & miles apart. Is the walleye fishing better size wise? Is the smallie fishing very good? Are the cabins in good shape and the owners friendly & helpful? I also saw the Fisheries resort near Coppen's but they were more expensive. Any info is appreciated!! Thanks to all who respond !!"

Even had Dale LaBelle (owner) guide us for smallmouth, but even he couldn't find them. Probably just a slow period."
