549911,Guest,2005-06-29 15:59:00,0,"I've been fishing Wabigoon for 12 years. I find a new spot every year we go. We stay on the east end of the lake (Merkle's). We typically fish within 2-3 miles of camp. If you fish the islands and rock humps you will find the walleyes. My grandson caught a 20"" walleye using a slip bobber and a Snoopy pole...go figure. So much for big time poles and reals. We fished around the islands and did well. We've gotten some nice fish out of west Butler and some along the north shore of Butler. I've never had much luck on the lower lakes (Olson, Paulson). We got back about a week ago and we a great time. Good luck. Peck"
