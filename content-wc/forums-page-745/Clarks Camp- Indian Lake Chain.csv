550022,JimH,2005-07-02 18:56:00,320,"Indian Lake Chain is a pretty good chain of lakes, not a lot of weedbeds, but loads of reefs, humps, and points. Water goes from stained to crystal clear, which is nice, because not all of the fish are doing the same thing, at the same time. When one or two lakes are cold, the others heat up with action. There has been a major increase in C&R in the last 5-10 years and you can tell by the size of the fish population. It's good for walleye, muskie, and lake trout. Vermilion Bay is about 8 miles away which has gas, groceries, and a couple of decent tackle shops. Been going there for 20+ years, never stayed at Clarks, have stayed at Indian Lake Lodge. There are some nice spots where you can get a quick limit of eating size walleyes for a nice shore lunch, and if you spend some time, you can find walleyes over 10 lbs and muskies into the mid 50"" range. Lakers are a little on the smaller side, but every so often you can pop a nice 30""er too. The nice thing about the chain, is that it's north of Eagle Lake, so everyone hits that lake heavy and leaves the Indian Chain alone. Good luck and enjoy."

Fishing on the Indian chain reminds me of fishing in northern Wisconsin 30 years ago. More on numbers than size, but CPR is definitely helping the last couple of years. Fritz"

Are their prices very affordable?(compared to others in the area) Or is the good fishing what brings you back year after year? I've thought and heard a lot about Lac Seul but I don't want to be fishing in a group of boats, maybe this chain offers secluded, peaceful fishing giving you a chance to unwind? Concerning the fishing you said that C&R has helped a lot, what can a 1st timer expect to catch on an average day?(I don't want to catch a bunch of 14"" walleyes, that size fish wouldn't be of legal size at home and I C&R those already) When do you plan your trip? Is mid July a good time or does the fishing curtail off after the summer heats up? Thanks for the info, I'll look into that resort also!! WisFan"
550032,JimH,2005-07-03 14:16:00,320,"Wisfan, if your goal is to put lots of large walleyes in the boat, there are better places, like Lac Seul. If you want lots of action, the Indian Chain is great. Having said that....I concentrate on deep water structure, and have pulled out some nice 6-10 lb fish. In fact, my son who was 13 at the time got a nice 30"", 10lber 2 years ago. Muskie fishing is great, with lots of upper 30"" to mid 40"" fish and growing. I'm seeing more over 50"" too. Lakers are smaller, typically in the 20""-25"" range, with a few over 10lbs. I'm sure if I spent more time on them, I'd find some larger ones there. Indian Lake Lodge is run by Kevin and Karen Welniak, two very nice people, who've had the resort for maybe 5 years now. Before them, it was owned by the Ballantynes, first mom and dad, then the son. The cabins are all spotless, I mean SPOTLESS clean, with good cooking arrangements including microwaves and coffee makers. Most cabins either have woodburning stoves or fireplaces. My wife and mom are very picky about accommodations, and both are very happy with the place. It's a pretty quiet resort, with a good combination of amenities for both fisherman and family. If you look them up on the web, you can finds rates. I've seen cheaper resorts and more expensive, but I've been really happy with this chain and have not been given a reason to try somewhere else. I've probably recommended about 6 or 7 guys from here or Lake Link about the place and all have thanked me about putting them in touch with the place. I go up there either the last week in July or first week in August with my family, and then my dad and I, along with my oldest son go up again in the last week of Sept. This year, my younger one will be joining us in fall. I think there are only 3 or 4 resorts on the whole chain, which helps keep the fishing pressure down.
