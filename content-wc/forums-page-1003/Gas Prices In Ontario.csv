Figuring out a budget and was wondering about the price of a litre of gasoline in Ontario. The price has been dropping down here in the state of Delaware. It will be about a 1,600 mile round trip so figuring out how much i'll need for gasoline is a factor. Thanks in advance."

514273,Bill P,2001-08-04 18:44:00,2,Right the prices are any where from $0.62 to about $0.70 a litre. The prices have been coming down but they change from town to town. Last week we weht to Sudbury price there was $0.65 in between Sudbury and Parry Sound $0.73 and in Parry Sound $0.64. Hope this helps.

Remember, there are about 4 litres of gas to a U.S. gallon. so multiply the price times four, then divide by 2/3 to factor exchange. Or if you are decent with numbers, just multiply the price per liter times 2.67. Example 60 cents per litre times 2.67= $1.60 per U.S. gallon in U.S. dollars. Remember to use credit cards for the fairest exchange rate."

514278,Guest,2001-08-07 09:31:00,0,"I fish near New Liskeard also, at Duncan Lake Camp right outside of Gowganda. Ever been there, any comments? Where are you fishing and what kind of experience are you having?"
514277,Mean Mike,2001-08-07 11:05:00,115,"I was on Lady Evelyn Lake, Island 10 Lodge. Fishing was pretty good. 37"" pike, 17"" smallmouth, and all the eye's you could catch in the evening."
514279,Mean Mike,2001-08-07 11:07:00,115,"Sorry, never been to Duncan Lake Camp. First time I fished Lady Evelyn, bigger lake than I thought. We went to a couple of back lakes, too, had a wounderful time."
