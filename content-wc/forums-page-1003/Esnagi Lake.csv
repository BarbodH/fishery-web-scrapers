We stay at Esnagi lake lodge, which is in the center, past the first narrows where you are talking about. Two years ago in August we did well in this area (first narrows), up in 12 fow or less. I would drift with boncers, and a harness in the deep water. Don't be afraid to try trolling reef runners or shade raps in areas 15+ to 20. Good luck and report when you return.Jon"

514046,Guest,2001-07-30 08:11:00,0,"Hey Rog,Be sure to leave some fish for us, we come in on Sunday (the day you leave).Good Luck,Jeff"
514047,JR1,2001-08-06 12:06:00,45,Rog Any report!!! ThanksJohn
514034,Guest,2001-07-23 13:14:00,0,"Has any one been to Esnagi lake in the summer I have a trip booked there next week. I have been there in June and have done great. But I was talking to someone who was there last week and they caught one 8"" perch in two and a half days. I'm hoping these guys didn't know how to fish. Any help with this would be appreciated. I realize the fishing is different in the summer but one 8"" perch is not to good. Thank you, Rog"
514035,Guest,2001-07-23 18:02:00,0,"Rog:my boss is there right now as we speak. don't worry. he goes this time every year and sleighs the walleyes. 200-300 is not uncommon for them(usually 4 guys) I've never been there so I don't know exactly where he fishes, but he could tell you. I do know he catches alot of eyes on bait rigs w/ primarily leaches worked along the weed edges. he also does well trolling w/ Thin Fins. E-mail me at the end of the week and maybe I can get a report to you w/ more specifics. when are you leaving again?"

Never been there this time of year, but the fishing still should be good. Check deep water areas close to weed edges. Post your report when you return. There is an area just before the narrows on your right side that is a weed flat that is close to deep water. Also around any of the islands in deep water is good. John"
514037,Guest,2001-07-24 04:08:00,0,"I am also going to Esnagi Lake, I start fishing on the 5th of August. Never been there before, last year we fished Wabitongushi. We will be going for Pike and Walleye, do they have the Pike in there that they say they do? What lodge do most of you stay at, Mar Mac or Esnagi Lake Lodge?ThanksJeff"
514038,Guest,2001-07-24 04:23:00,0,"How did you do at Wabitongushi? I went there a few years ago in late-May, but we were thinking of going back in early August of next year. Let me know how you did, where you stayed....etc. Something tells me if you're going to Esnagi this year, it may not have been that productive. Thanks."
514039,Guest,2001-07-24 09:58:00,0,"We didn't do too bad at Wabitongushi. We were mostly after Pike and then targeted walleye for lunch/dinners. The biggest Pike was only 36"" but the weather had just about everything shut down. The last 2 days we were there the weather finally cooroperated and we really started getting into the Pike. The walleye fishing was pretty tough. We had best luck with crawler harnesses along side weed beds in 12+/- FOW. We were there the first week of August last year. We stayed at Camp Lochalsh in one of there outpost cabins. The facilities were excellant and the staff was top notch. I would highly recommend this lodge to anyone however the fishing was not exactly what we were wanting so that is why we are going to try Esnagi. Camp Lochalsh is on the South end of Wabitongushi, My folks always go through Erringtons when they fish that lake and their results seemed to be much better than ours. In any case, the weather can play a big factor in the fishing as I am sure you now. I have heard that Esnagi has some really big Pike and the walleye fishing is supposed to be pretty good so we will give it a try. I am starting to get a little worried now as it seems that there is a little bit of negative talk about this lake. Any more info you have on this lake would be great.Thanks,Jeff"
514040,Guest,2001-07-24 12:11:00,0,"I too have stayed at Camp Lochalsh in the outpost cabin...the one on the right. Good crib, and in late-May, we were the ONLY one's around. Very secluded, very relaxing. Chris, Courtney, and the boys were great to us. I'd also recommend this place to anyone. I understand they're only open 8 weeks a year now. Chris told me he just doesn't have the time. I'd make the time, I can say that for sure.Anyway, I've heard that Esnagi is a good lake, but you've got to know where to go. Hooking up with someone who's been there year after year will benefit you greatly. This guy I've talked to has been going there for 20+ years for 2 weeks every summer. One early in the year, one later (August). He said he never has a problem limiting on walleyes. Pike in August are going to be deep no matter where you're at in Canada. You may find a stray in 5'-8' of water, but they'll be few and far between. We've started going into Quebec these past few years. Great fishing, and not much further than Wabitongushi or Esnagi...depending on where you're coming from. Check out www.taggartbay.com, or www.duenorth.net/corbeau/, or www.ogascanan.com. Great region with great fishing for walleye, pike, and lake trout. Good luck at Esnagi. You'll do fine...don't get nervous, just find yourself someone who really knows where to go and what to do. Post your results...I'll look for them in a few weeks."
514042,Guest,2001-07-24 14:39:00,0,"JR1, Thank you for the info, when you say the weed flat just before the narrows are you talking to the north or to south, I think they call the one to south the ""first narrows"".We did very well at ""the sand bar""and stumpy bay this past June but thats not very deep water. I do know some other good spots 25' or more I guess we will have to check those spots too. Do you think that we will have to run bottom bouncers, we mainly use jigs in the spring. I also troll deep, 20'+ for northerns with spoonplugs and have caught some real nice ones. Thanks Again, Rog"
514041,Guest,2001-07-24 17:23:00,0,"I talked to Chris and Courtney at the last outdoor-rama in novi and they didn't mention anything about only being open 8 weeks. We stayed at the outpost on the left and were also the only ones. If you are ever up that way again tell them that the Marines will storm their beaches again in the near future :-).I am not getting to nervous I just don't want a lousy trip since most of the guys are coming from the South (N.C., S.C., FL., and Alabama). This is a yearly Marine Corps reunion for us and I am the one giving the options so I have the most weight on my shoulders :-)Oh well, wether we catch a bunch of fish or not doesn't really concern me that much, the relaxation in those parts are great.Thanks for the info and I'll post results in a few weeks.Jeff"
514043,Guest,2001-07-24 17:25:00,0,Do you have any GPS coordinates for the areas you are talking about?Jeff
