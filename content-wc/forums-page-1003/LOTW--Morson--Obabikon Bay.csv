514074,Guest,2001-07-25 12:34:00,0,"Fished LOW for three full days July 19, 20, 21. Miles Bay was very active with fish taken off of Horseshoe and Garden Islands. Lots of fish, but mostly dinks. Fish were in 30 feet of water. We tried some shallow weedy areas, but caught mostly small northens. We then traveled to Basil Channel and pounded (at least 100) 16 to 24 inchers in 15 feet of water along the main channel points and along the weedlines of the larger bays.Day two we went back to Miles and fished a couple of reef tops. Once again we were producing mostly dinks so we went to Stevens Bay and fished some of the weed lines around the Hanson' Island area. We bagged some nice 20-22 inchers, but fishing was slower than the day before. In the evening, we moved to the Split Rock area and found basket loads of 16 inch wallys in 6 to 8 feet of water in a large bay. The weather was clouding up and a storm was approaching. Day three, it was back to Miles Bay. We're just dumb I guess. More dinks. Left there and went back to Basil Channel where we found the nice W's again. In the afternoon we dropped down to Little Traverse Bay and fished some of the reef tops. Several reefs held some big fish. We boated several 24 to 26 inchers over the next 4 hours. We also had a big Musky take a wack at one fish. We used jigs and minnows for deep presentations. We longlined lindy rigs with crawlers on the reef tops and weed beds. Husky Jerks worked well in windy bays and points.Burned lots of gas. TGG"
514075,FOOTDOC,2001-07-26 17:17:00,139,"Thanks for the information. I am curious as to where Basil Channel is in relation to horseshoe and garden islands? I have the LOTW southeast section hot spots map and am unable to find Basil Channel, Steven's bay and Hansen's Island. Also is it worth taking crawlers up?? I usually stop on 621 and buy some leeches at the small bait store on the east side of the road. Should I take leeches again or am I wasting my time? Any preference on jig size or color? Did you get your little northerns on spinner baits? What color skirts? We have always found white to be great! Thanks again for the info!"
514076,PJM,2001-07-26 18:38:00,3516,Basil Island is straight west of Morson by Painted Rock or to be exact it is between Big Island and Dawson Island. Stevens Bay Is northeast of Morson in Sabaskong Bay or if you can find Hay Island it is straight east. My question for the Great Guide is where in Basil Channel was he fishing was it by North Snake Island or Plow Island or near the bays of Dawson Island. I would recommend bringing up 3/8 to 1/2 Oz fireball jigs depending how rough it is and fish the reefs in the bay the NW of Buena Vista resort near Morson and go out several miles. P S. The Great Guide must fish this lake alot because he covered alot of miles so I would put a lot of stock in what he says.
514077,Guest,2001-07-27 10:16:00,0,"Man, I'll say The Great Guide covered a lot of water and as he put it burned a LOT of gas - he basically covered the entire South East corner in three days - obviously knows his water.I've fished the Split Rock area a fair amount and have found flourescent orange to be the single most productive colour (if I had to choose one colour in any type of bait in this area it would be bright orange hands down - or red). However, its not a law only an observation - but every year we start out trying something different and end up going back to the orange and kicking butt. Also good in blades are hammered nickel or bronze.Bait wise anything that is alive works real well regardless of whether its leeches, worms or minnows (actually if you can get large live minnows 4"" plus, go with these).Good luck and let us know how you did."

514079,Guest,2001-08-01 11:49:00,0,"footdoc, i used to fish that area also,but im like the fishing guide, all i did was use a lot of gas running all over the lake. we traveled close to 32 miles every day. we stayed at the buena vista resort. it was a nice resort and we usually had a good time, but we got tired of all the running around we had to do. it just was not worth all the running around. i do agree with gentlemen who said orange was the best color up there. i caught some of the biggest walleye there on orange jigs. pepe."
514080,FOOTDOC,2001-08-04 19:20:00,139,"Yes, Pepe, I agree with you. It is a lot of running around. My son and I still enjoy it a great deal. I hope by posting this again, I can get some more information as we are leaving early Thursday Morning. Thanks."
