The arilines (AirTrans) web page says the limit is 6'. I've made a rod carrier out of a PVC tube that is 7'5"" long. Do you think they would hassle me???"
514298,Guest,2001-08-05 19:05:00,0,Call them and ask
514299,Karl,2001-08-05 22:00:00,63,"I know that you won't have a problem with the Pickerel Arm planes, (I've flown them with several 7 foot rods), don't know about other airlines though. But, like the other message said - call and ask to be safe."
514300,duffy,2001-08-06 05:38:00,49,Northwest says the same thing but I have never had a problem with them. I bring 7 foot rods. If you call thew airlines they will probobly tell you their standard policy. The people checking you in are the ones that will make or break you. Good luck.
514301,Guest,2001-08-06 14:56:00,0,I have never had a problem with a 7 foot rod holder.I would take the chance.
