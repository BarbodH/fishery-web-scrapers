They sell the local ""Sault Anglers"" fishing map it will show you places on Superior or inland lakes and what fish species they have where. But I am sure you will find good choices just on Superior from your Batchawana location depending on the size of your boat."

Just to let you know I'm fishing out of a 16ft aluminium boat/40hp motor that I can trailer inland if needed. Is there very good fihing in the bay itself? Not looking for big fish(i.e downrigging),hopefully just some perch for the kids to catch.To say that I'm indimidated by Lake Superior is an understatement, so I wan't to tread carefully while on that sea!Thanks AgainKen J"
