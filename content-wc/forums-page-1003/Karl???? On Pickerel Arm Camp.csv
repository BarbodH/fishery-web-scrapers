514260,TomPGrouse,2001-08-03 14:04:00,124,Have you taken advantage of any of the flyins they offer at this camp? I would appreciate any advice or opinions you can give me.[email protected]Thanks
514261,Karl,2001-08-04 06:51:00,63,"Yes, I've flown into to Kabikwabik Lake, Wapesi River, and Blackstone Lake. Very nice cabins with refrig, stove, block ice, showers (with hot water!). I'd recommend any of the flyin's except Wapesi River is all really small walleye, wouldn't go back to that one. Blackstone was outstanding. Forgot to load the bag of minnows in the plane (major oops!), so we used jigs with white Berkley Power Grubs. They rarely made it to the bottom. Almost every cast was a 18-20 inch fat walleye. Had a friend go to Fawcett with same results. Springpole and Otatakan also super. Bottom line, they have some of the best flyin lakes in Ontario along with great service."
