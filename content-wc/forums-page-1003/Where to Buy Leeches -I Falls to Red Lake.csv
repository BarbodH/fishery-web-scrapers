Honestly, everyone knows the only reason the regs went in about bring leeches across the boarder is all about the ongoing boarder war between Minn. and ontario. The Canadians have just identified another way to help their economy by forcing Americans to buy bait in Canada. This is fine but lets, at least, be honest about what is going on here. Zeebra muscels and the like matter little when buying bait at Ft Franceis or south 10-20 miles.We enjoy are trips to Canada very much and are more than willing to follow the regs impossed. However, it seems ever year things are getting a little more difficult. More boarder checks, more regulations, lower fish limits and escalating prices. One begins to wonder when someone will figure out that killing the goose that lays the golden eggs may not be such a good idea.Wether Canadians like it or not a very large part of the economy of the area is dependedt on American fishing dollars. No comment on right or wrong just the reality of the situation."
514193,Karl,2001-08-05 22:08:00,63,"My two cents:Every year the cost goes up, the regs get tighter, 502 never gets any better - but the size and number of fish has been getting better every year. Coincidence?"

Or, how's the supply and prices in Red Lake? Anybody have any recommendations where to get good ones in quantiy at a good price bewteen I Fall and Red Lake? Thanks Jim/Wi"
514183,Guest,2001-07-30 05:07:00,0,Just got back from Red Lake on Saturday. I ordered in advance from Four Seasons bait shop in Ear Falls. Call and talk to Mike if he has any they will be waiting for you. Unfortunately I do not have the number but you should be able to find it. I paid $23 canadian per pound.Jeff
514184,Guest,2001-07-30 06:32:00,0,"My advice is get them well before you get up north. Buy them around Mille Lacs or Twin Cities area. Was just up there. We smuggled ours across border (which is way to go). The leeches in canada are tiny, unless you are willing to pay a big price. we bought 1.5 pounds in Dogtooth for Jumbos and paid $75 US. We paid $18 US in the Cities. Find a way to get them across border! Go across around 5-6 pm. The shift at the mill is switching and they check no one."
514185,Guest,2001-07-30 08:57:00,0,And you wonder why americans are thought of so highly by a lot of Canadian fiishermen. Yet when a natural ecosystem is ruined by bringing in stuff like this you ll be the first to complain. Zebra Mussels ring a bell? Just shows what can be caused by foreigh species.Your best bet as mentioned previously was to call Four seasons 1 807 222 2200
514186,Guest,2001-07-30 09:48:00,0,"Hey Al..holeI agree with Perturbed What is it with you Americans? You come to Canada for the best fishing, but you'll ruin it by introducing foreign species. Get your out of your #####!"
514188,Hunter,2001-07-30 12:49:00,346,"Hope next time you pull a stunt like that, you are busted and turned around. There is no excuse for open disregard of the law. And if the border patrol starts checking everyones coolers now for illegal bait, you played a major part in it. Just for your info my wife is a customs officer, and she will be reading your post."
514187,IaCraig,2001-07-30 16:21:00,434,"Come on, Al is a jerk and I do not think American's have a monopoly on that. You probably know a few jerks in your fine country too. So instead of condeming everyone in the United states because Al lives there, please direct your frustration at him. IaCraig"
514189,Guest,2001-07-30 18:38:00,0,"Ya Al, I thought of your plan ,BUT IT'S ILLEGAL. Never use to be but now it is. Seems to me they ask if you have any leeches or 'crawlers. So you must have been a smiling faced liar as they asked you. And, when you got a way with it, you must have laughed your ##### off. Man, it's people like you that make me sick.Sorry that Al posted 'cause it threw everyone off what my oringal question was. Anybody have any other legal ideas?"
514190,Guest,2001-07-31 10:48:00,0,"I apologize to all good hearted Americans. My intent was not to condemn all Americans in one lump some, But that Al guy pissed me off."
514191,Guest,2001-07-31 11:18:00,0,"Jim/WI Getting back to your question. Rainy Lake Baits in Fort Francis is a quality bait store. They get all my business. They gennerally have a good supply of leeches. In August the leeches are getting close to the end of the lifecycle and the bigger ones are harder to get. Call ahead and check supplies.Rainy Lake Baits is located about two miles east of Fort Francis on HWY 11. 1-807-274-6429. Great Bear is located another few miles east on Hwy 11. 1-807-274-2227Please don't even consider the advice of that idiot, AL. The Canadians have some might fine lakes and I support their conservation efforts. Maybe Minnesota, Wisconsin & Michigan might want to take notice. TGG"
