The water over there is much clearer(less dark) and the area is full of thick deep weedy dropoffs and a million islands. Lots of musky and pike casting and trolling spoons,bucktails and long cranks around Strawberry Island, and along the sides of the island nearest the mainlake basin. Good sized Pike between 25 and 31 inches were pretty consistent the whole week we fished, and boated a couple of muskies 38 and 43 inch. A couple of guys from the lodge that followed us to that spot caught a 52 inch musky, so there are big ones there.I don't think this side (around Vermillion Bay) is as good for walleyes and smallmouth though. We had hired a guide for the day who took us on a pretty long ride down towards Viking and Blind Bays. He mentioned that the other branch of Eagle Lake, with the darker water,mainlake reefs and rockier points and dropoffs is the place to to go."

No walleye, only a few northern trolling. Went to Gull Rock and did MUCH better. Huge Lake, first time there for me, so maybe I did not know what I was doing. Not going back though. Resort owner at Gull Rock said he had a lot of people come up from there in the last few years. Looks like a terrific lake, but not for me though. Maybe too hot."
