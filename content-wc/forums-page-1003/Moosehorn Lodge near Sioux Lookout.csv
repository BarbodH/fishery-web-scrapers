514082,Guest,2001-07-28 19:14:00,0,"I stayed there once. There were 5 of us and spent 5 days. We stayed in a cabin and did our own cooking. I can't say it was the best fishing or the friendiest place. It appeared that since we were not paying to have them cook for us they didn't pay much attention to us. Never even asked us if we were coming back the next year. We caught fish but they were small. We had to still fish and jig for them. We never went up stream very far and I think there are bigger fish if you head father up river. The last day we were there we fished at the outlet of the first lake and caught a number of fish. The biggest was 18"". The cabins were clean but nothing to great. The last couple years I have went to the other end of the lake by Ear Falls. Stayed at Goose bay camp. Very nice place and very friendly. We have done real well. This year 3 of us caught 600 fish in 7 days. 30 were over 2 lbs with the biggest being 6 lbs. I like it much better and find the fishing better."
514083,WCoyote,2001-07-29 11:25:00,200,Thanks Mike. You confirm the info I have been getting. Thanks for the help.After getting several recomendations I am going to try Andersons Lodge. I have received a number of postitive recomendations on it. It is on Abram lake but have a private boat ramp on Lac Seul.Apparently saves a lot of time getting to the fish.Again thanks for the help.wea
514084,Karl,2001-07-29 19:15:00,63,"Don't know about Moosehorn, but if you're not staying there, contact Pickerel Arm Camp before making reservations at Andersen's. I've stayed there for nine years now and highly recommend them.http://www.pickerelarm.comThey're a LOT less expensive and have just as nice (or better) accomodations and service, you're right on Minnitaki Lake which has a billion more walleyes than Abrams Lake (Andersen's is on Abrams Lake), and the public boat landing on Lac Seul is ten minutes further away than Andersen's private landing on Lac Seul.And the cabins are far enough from Highway 72 so you won't here traffic at night."
514085,TomPGrouse,2001-08-02 15:40:00,124,"Karl, have you tried any of the flyins they offer?"
514086,Guest,2001-08-06 07:19:00,0,"If your asking about Anderson's fly-in to their outpost, I would highly recommend it. I have fished Lac Seul for many years, and Anderson's provide a great service.-wayne"
514087,Guest,2001-08-06 08:23:00,0,I've been taking my family to Rocky Shore Lodge for the past 5 years. The fishing is great and the people are friendly. The accomadations are unbelieveable and really new. I would recommend Rocky Shore Lodge to anyone that's looking to save some money by not doing a fly-in. www.rockyshorelodge.comMike Morrow
