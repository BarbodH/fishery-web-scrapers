We had a really bad storm on Tusday of this week and the Nester Falls, Sioux Narrows areas were hit really hard. 71 was closed for two days because of wash outs and trees being down all over the place. Some parts were without power and phone for two days. The fishing died right after the storm but was starting to come back. You have to watch the lake because the LOTW is very high. ALso there is a lot of junk floating around, that can cause some problems for you motor!!!!!Other than that we had a GREAT time like always! I really love the place. GOOD LUCK HAND HAVE FUN!!!"
