514211,Guest,2001-08-02 17:25:00,0,Has anybody had much success fishing in the weeds late in the year for Walleyes on Northwest Ontario. I'm going up in two weeks near Savant Lake and wanted to try something new. Any suggestions are appreciated.
514212,Guest,2001-08-02 17:49:00,0,"TreeguyAs we all know, the weeds in the fall can be a little hairy. They are tall, thick and in some cases dying and can easily be lifted from their roots by a hook and line. Everyone is so cautious and fishes the same way mostly, by trolling the edge of the weedline and avoiding a mess of weeds. Problem is, you may be missing big walleye. To find them, get messy yourself. I suggest tossing out a soft jerkbait...such as a power slug or fluke...rig it weedless and troll right through the offending plants. Try bright colours first, switching to muted if no hits occur. Go SLOW and let your wrist impart the action.Give it a shot.M.M."

A process called ""Rip Jigging"". Using a 3/8 oz. hair jig (white hair) and drop it into the weeds and jog it. If you feel any resistance (weeds, etc.) then rip it. Caught bigger walleyes in the heavy cover than along the weedline. Did not try the weedless jigs but am going to give that a try. Other way is hard on the elbows and shoulder."

Find a pocket and use a weedless or weedproof jig. Pull them out like your fishing, largemouth's in the slop . good luck (STILL PLAYIN')."

A 21""Walleye! was the largest. Lots of fish 16-18"" And we also caught fish in open water, coves on humps and points. My wife caught a nice Walleye on a 3/4 oz red spinner bait. The fishing was good for us. Great weather with one rain storm. Hope you have the same luck we had! Elmo"
