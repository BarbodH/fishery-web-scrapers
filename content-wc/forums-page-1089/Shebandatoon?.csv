506603,spongecake,1999-11-29 14:19:00,22,Has anybody ever heard of a Canadian lake or river by this name? I'd like to know what Province it's in and any other information I can discover.
506604,Guest,1999-12-01 12:17:00,0,I think you are referring to lake Shebandowan. I may have misspelled it. It is just outside of Thunder bay Ontario. It is a popular lake in the local area.
506605,spongecake,1999-12-01 15:25:00,22,"Shebandowan? You must be right! You see, I'm trying to find out about it because an old fishing buddy of my grandpa's thought that is where my grandpa (now deceased) caught his trophy walleye. There is no engraved plate on the plaque, and we don't remember my grandpa ever mentioning where he caught it. I've decided to have the mount restored, and I want to add a plaque with the lake name, etc. I'll try to find out some more info about the lake now..... it make sense, because my grandpa went through Thunder Bay a lot. Thanks much!"
