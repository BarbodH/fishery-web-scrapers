While our goal is often muskie, we do fish for walleye, especially in the early summer. Last two years, walleyes have gone way down hill. In '99, a slot limit was put in force. i have heard that a slot limit was imposed in the lower french river, close to the pickerel river, a few years ago. has anyone heard of any results from this?"
