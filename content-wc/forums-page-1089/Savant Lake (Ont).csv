But the camp was quite clean and the fishing, although tough because of the weather was good. Weather settled down the last two days of the trip and the fishing got good. Especially the last day! This seems to be more of a lake trout lake with a healthy population of walleye in it. We caught quality (four to six pounds)fish every evening right at dark. But like I said the lake is a little intimidating. We've fished Canada fourteen times and this is one of the few lakes that I had to rely on a hand held gps to find my way back to our bed at night. If we go back nexr year we will be a little more at ease on it. Several times I almost was spooled off by a large fish while trolling spinners for walleye. I'm guessing that the culprits were big lake trout. They are strong rascals! That makes fishing pretty interesting...E-mail me if you need anything else. Good luck.Pooch"
