In the Oct / Nov issue there is an article that you should read on page16 by Bruce Masterman of Calgary. In the issue he states that all of us tournament anglers are ego, money driven anglers and in the final paragraph he states, "" teaching kids to fish should be done by responsible, caring adults"" I guess that it something non of us tournament anglers can or ever will be.My 2 cents worth, Good fishing, good luck and seasons greetings to all at Walleye Central.Russ"

Anyone who would write such an article obviously didn't do much research, and is probably describing himself. His statement is like saying that we should not let our kids learn to play hockey from the likes of Wayne Gretzky and Bobby Orr."
