I have been fishing that lake since 1990 when my parents bought a camp there. The Walleye fishing has declined every year. Fished it this year about 10 days and caught NON. It is not a big lake and the fishing pressure is high. I think I am the only person who has ever caught and released a walleye there. People look at me like I'm an alien for releasing one, therefore you get the idea about the lake's decline. There is also a native reserve at the end of the lake that has, in essence unrestricted access to the resource. Pike, bass and perch fishing on the other hand is GREAT. Nobody seems to take them so they have taken over. It is a nice lake to cruise and a beautiful place to relax and the fishing is good for all except walleye.Good Luck"

I would consider Golden Lake a slightly stained lake. The water has a yellow/gold tint to it hence the name. On a bright day you can see about 8-9ft down. The lake is largely soft bottom with very few rock shoals and little other lake structure. The fish I have caught have been when slugging in the weeds/edges 8-12ft range or open water trolling over 50-80ft zones down 8-12 ft. Those are the only 2 patterns that the lake seems to offer. The weed fishing will bring you 100 or more pike and bass to 1 walleye and the open water trolling MIGHT get you a fish in 10 hours. Not very encouraging.Despite all of this I still love to go there for the time on the water. Like the saying goes. A BAD DAY OF FISHING BEATS A GOOD DAY AT WORK ANYTIME!!!"
