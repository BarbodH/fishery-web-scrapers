506613,Guest,1999-12-03 12:46:00,0,The ice conditions are poor as there is no ice yet. Way to unseasonable warm. Just ponds and very small lakes are freezing and unthawing. I would not hold my breath waiting for good ice for Christmass this year. I think we are definitely experiencing global warming as our winters get tamer every year. Maybe pick somewhere hot this year like the East Cape of Baja or a longranger out of San Diego as ice fishing may not start for quite awhile. Still no ice....Great Waters
