506657,Guest,1999-12-15 07:37:00,0,Does anyone have any tips on location and presentation for fishing lake dief. on opening day?Thanks in advanceMattPS: I am fishing in coteua bay/ the gardiner dam.
506658,Russ,1999-12-16 21:57:00,17,Try real shallow there at opening...4 feet or less. Depending on the water level there are a few bars near the back that are pretty good some years. Way back at the culvert is pretty good at times too. Watch your water temp. look for the warmest you find in Coteau. near the pump bay is good at times to but watch the regs. to see where the boundries are. Good luckRuss
