506708,Guest,1999-12-27 19:27:00,0,"I was on the Red both yesterday and today - Ice is thick enough that some brave souls were driving on it and setting up their shacks. Fishing was ok, caught about a dozen (small) today and zippo yesterday. Fish were 14-16"", caught in about 15-17' using silver anything with salted minnows. Seems the Fish are still in their late fall hideouts. Ski-Doos from **** also...Bite has generally been good, although the unstable weather has tuned it down a bit. Real light biters also.LaterChris"

They parked 6 pick ups side by side....not smart! They were filming themselves...maybe for some type of show.Caught the fish on chunks of leech left over from this year.Later,Pikeman"
506709,Guest,1999-12-28 19:40:00,0,Where do u fish on last mountain lake
506710,Guest,1999-12-28 22:35:00,0,"I fish for Walleye on the west side from the stone barn up to Sarnia - edges of weedbeds/rocks, points, etc - I usually just drill a hole in 8-12ft and look down for an hour or two - if I see fish/baitfish, I'll stay put! I try to get away from the crowds, as my impression is that most people ""memory"" fish or stay real close to the shore ramps. It's a huge lake with a lot of fish -Half the fun is finding them!Last couple of years, wee-tooh has been good, and also collingwood for Perch.I'll let ya know next time I'm out there - maybe we could wet a line or two!Chris"
