567243,CycloneWalleye,2007-07-10 06:45:00,5,I got a possession when I was 18 (might have been 19). I have been to canada the past 2 years and have not had a problem. I am going again this year. I am now 26 years old. I don't think it will be an issue. Maybe you could call customs and check with them.
567258,CycloneWalleye,2007-07-10 13:09:00,5,"Found a number you can call for specific questions: Citizenship and Immigration Canada: 604-666-2171  this is a federal office in Vancouver, BC, and they can answer all customs and immigration questions for travelers to Canada. Also, here is what the website says ""Anyone who has committed a Felony may be denied entry into Canada. DWI or DUI convictions qualify as a Felony charge and Canadian Customs may deny entry into Canada to anyone who has such a charge."" Sounds like your son should be fine with a possession."

567278,BMF,2007-07-10 20:58:00,2,"Thanks everyone for the good info & phone number. I've been checking a Canada-U.S. Relations Web site & according to this site, since he is a Juvenile, he mostly likely will NOT be prohibited from entering Canada. Thanks again."
567310,Guest,2007-07-11 17:41:00,0,"This offense is not a felony in Canada. That is the reason you can not enter with a recent DUI which is a Felony. The question asked at the border is ""Have you committed any Felony's"" If you have you will not beable to enter no matter if it is a DUI or someother conviction. Later Fred"

His court date is just before we go. Will this prevent him from being able to cross the Border? I'm not sure how Canada views this charge. Thanks for your help."

567127,Guest,2007-07-08 17:21:00,0,Hi. Its not quite the same as dui and of course you will have a lawyer. I would think if its the first time the judge just might let it go with a warning. I dont think they make anything underage a permanent record type thing. somewhere on this site people have posted the candadian web site for info on things like this. just do a search. good luck. I hope he learned his lesson.

567131,bigfish1965,2007-07-08 18:25:00,3210,I don't think that offenses carried out as a minor are counted since in Canada we cannot count those against our own citizens. (Youth records are always sealed).In Canada that offense is only a ticket anyway and not a Criminal (Felony) Offense. Most cops here just steal your booze and send you on your way ;)

567143,Guest,2007-07-09 05:03:00,0,"Do you live in a state where age 17 is an adult? Was he fingerprinted? If not then this is not on his record yet. Was he charged for minor in possession (not in a car), or was he charged with a possession while driving? If it is a possession while driving it might look to the customs officers as a DUI. It does not matter if he is only charged with a DUI or if he has a charge on his record that has gone through the courts. Both will disqualify. Dragging the matter out in court until after you go is bad advise. It does not matter. The best thing to do is to call the border station you are crossing at and ask them directly. If this is a simple possession of alcohol, bring all of his paperwork from the arrest with you in case there are any questions."
