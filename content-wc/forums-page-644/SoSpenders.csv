I checked with Northwest Airlines and TSA before departing for Winnipeg on JUne 29 and the SoSpenders CO2 cartridges were no problem. Not so leaving Canada. The Canucks at the airport confiscated the CO2 cartridges from three life vests and six more spare cartridges. I wuz pisses!

567231,rockpt,2007-07-09 18:55:00,589,That's interesting. I would think the TSA would be stricter than their Canadian counterpart. I'm assuming you had tried to transport them in checked baggage and they still took them? That's about $200 worth of cartridges by my calculation. That's unfortunate b/c Sospenders are perfect for fly-in trips.
567233,bamawallie,2007-07-09 20:03:00,54,"I had three vests, the spare cartridges, rainsuits, etc. in a duffel bag and when they ran it through the x-ray the cartridges lit up the screen. You would think the US and Canadian folks would compare notes once in a while. Between airfare, stay at a lodge, rental car, etc. we spent over $5,000. You think the Canucks might be a bit more understanding if they want those US tourist dollars to continue."
567236,Guest,2007-07-09 20:35:00,0,"Your cost of the trip is more a matter of where you live and your desired mode of transportation rather than the Canadian government's interest in gaining some tax $$$$$. I can appreciate your spending that kind of $$$$ on a fishing trip to Canada but you do live south of the Mason-Dixon line or am I assuming too much from your byline. I on the otherhand live 1 tankfull from I Falls, so flying is not even considered."

567247,retire55,2007-07-10 07:38:00,1029,"Regarding CO2 cylinders for self-inflating life-jackets, the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority web site - see http://www.catsa-acsta.gc.ca/english...html#firearms1 states (under DANGEROUS GOODS - Sporting Goods) that CO2 cylinders for self-inflating life-jacket are permitted in carry-on or checked luggage. See the following note. Note: No more than two small CO2 cylinders or two cylinders of other suitable non-inflammable, non-poisonous gas when fitted into a self-inflating life-jacket for inflation purposes, plus no more than two spare cartridges per passenger. Consequently, it would seem someone made a mistake. I'm unaware of whether you have any documentation that you could use to obtain reimboursement."
567249,bamawallie,2007-07-10 08:12:00,54,Thanks very much for the info although there is little I can do about it now. Another government employee strikes again.
567305,bamawallie,2007-07-11 15:16:00,54,"Thanks to your information, I contacted CATSA and they furnished me a claim form for reimbursement for the erroneously confiscated C02 cartridges. Thanks for your help."
