567049,Guest,2007-07-06 11:33:00,0,I fished the lodge about 10 years ago. It was OK. John and his dad Barney are the owners. Good people but not very organized. The fishing was ok but I have had better. You should catch plenty of walleyes and a chance at a nice northern. The cabins are fine but nothing to write home about. The train ride in was kinda fun and something different. Have fun.

Boats were fine. We caught plenty of walleyes, mostly by portaging motor canoes down the Allanwater (going north)and fishing below rapids and in narrows. Plenty of fish going the other way too. We don't rely on the camp owner for providing anything other than the essentials. I remember Barney doing that. If I remember correctly, it was dark again when the train took us back to Armstrong. Only went once to Barney's. Train's okay, but I'd rather drive in or fly in. When I went the train had odd hours which was a drawback for me. No complaints about the fish, camp or service. It wasn't when I was up there, but I believe Allanwater is now a hub for canoe trips going in both directions. Lot's more activity up there."
