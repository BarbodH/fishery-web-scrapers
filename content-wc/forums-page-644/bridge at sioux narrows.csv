They said the builders are trying to save the wooden superstructure and that only the bridge piers and foundation are being replaced. The roadway is new but the wooden part does not carry the weight on the bridge anymore. This was let out in separate contracts, why? Could be anyone's guess."

If you choose to go north on Hwy 71 through Sioux Narrows, and then turn east at Longbow Corners, the trip will be 258 miles. It's your choice."
