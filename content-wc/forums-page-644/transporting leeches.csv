We use igloo 12 volt coolers that plug in to the vehicle 12 volt system and they great for leeches and crawlers. We change the water that the leeches are in mid week and they stay lively and healthy. We mainly fish in Quebec where live minnows are not allowed and leeches are the preferred Walleye bait."

We keep the leeches in a cooler on ice overnight and then store the bags of leeches in the frig once we're in camp. On the boat, I use a Leech Tamer to keep my leeches in a cooler on ice."
