566925,Jazzy Lu,2007-07-03 08:10:00,11,We used a variety of sucker sizes but Curt caught the largest on about a 5-6 inch salted and frozen sucker. Have you been to Antenna? There is a small lake at the north end where we shoot the beaver dams and have had great luck with large walleyes and northern . This May there was alot more grown cabbage there compared to the main lake so that was fun. Did you read my post about big northerns? I told about the northern skull that we found. The width of the jaw and the size of teeth made that 34lb mouth look small. We brought it home. Curt got a 48incher out of Antenna a few years ago.You may have seen it in Gawleys office. But we also had on a 40 lb one year in same lake . It was quite the fight and just as we got her to the boat for another run she literally spit out the hook like you would a watermelon seed. But we got to see all of her really well and I will never forget it. It's possible that the skull was her.......................or her sister or mama!!! We had good times on Bertrand and Kapakik and would love to go back but don't have enough people in our group to book it every year. Well...........I'm fired up to go fishing.

567093,lassh,2007-07-07 12:05:00,553,"I have fished Shabumeni twice and McVicar 4 or 5 times all before Doug took over from Les Schultz. Shabumeni definitely has the edge on northern fishing over McVicar in terms of quantity and fish over 40"". We have also fished Kapikik and Canon lakes. From talking to other guests, Bertrand is a lake to target trophies."
567235,Guest,2007-07-09 20:33:00,0,"lassh, Ive been on Shabumeni acouple times and thinking about going back next year. Ive always done well on walleyes and good on pike too but not no real lunkers. Just nice overall fish. Any suggestions or tips you may have in finding the big pike on Shabumeni? When was the last time you fished Shab? What time of year? Any info be great. Thanks"
567271,lassh,2007-07-10 16:47:00,553,It was about ten years ago in late June. I can't find any maps to refresh my memory but I will email you some details.
566690,McVicar,2007-06-26 16:34:00,3,"Hey McVicar fisher-man! It's been a more than a month since we were up there opening week. Our group of 4 had our 2nd best year with well over 1000 walleyes caught and released, in the cold and windy weather. We've always wondered how the fishing is after we leave. Please let us know!!!"
566694,Guest,2007-06-26 18:23:00,0,"Anything with Doug and his outposts, i am sure the fishing was fabulous. Have been on his one day fly in as well as week long trips and he and the fishing has never been short of amazing. Doug is a stragiht shooter that will tell you like it is and also take care of you as well. First class all the way."
566724,genet,2007-06-27 22:27:00,7,"Tip Top & McVicar; I have heard some good things about Woman River Fly-In's.. Have you fished any of their other lakes besides McVicar?? Saw some great posts on another website about Shabumeni Lake.Sounds like the walleye fishing is outstanding on both lakes..Have either of you fished this lake?? One of the guys in our group likes to spend some time each trip casting for northerns.. Do any of their lakes have numbers of decent sized (28"" plus) northerns.. Our group has a trip already booked for June/'08 and we are real happy with this outfitter out of Red Lake.. We just like to try new spots every 3-4 years.. Already thinking about 2009 and maybe trying a new spot.. Would appreciate any follow-up information.. GeneT"

566806,McVicar,2007-06-29 12:29:00,3,"We've been booking McVicar for 20+ years, we always book opening week, because of this there have been a few years that we have been froze out. When we get froze out, we get put into other lakes that Doug runs. We have fished Bertrand, Arial, and Grace. All very good fishing and accomodations. As far as northerns, Bertrand is the lake that is ""listed"" one of the best for Northern. Being opening week we tend to fish mainly walleyes, but always catch many northern in the 30+ range. The 40 and over is honestly pretty far and few between, but again, we don't fish northern very hard. My brother took a 2nd trip to Bertrand a number of years ago, and everyone in that group has said they lost Northern that would have been the largest that that they would have caught would they have landed them. Before we learned the tricks to spring walleye fishing we would catch a fair amount 8-10-12 pound northerns. Our fishing tactics now don't appear to put us on top of that class of northern."
566860,Guest,2007-07-01 18:30:00,0,We have stayed at aerial and done a bunch of one day fly ins. We always fish for walleye. Aerial was fabulous as is all of doug's lakes. He is great and a straight shooter. First class with him. Now when I go up i am either going with him or if the older guys go we go to gullrock and fish because they do not want to fly in. I have been going up there for 30 years and these are the best two places I have been.
566865,genet,2007-07-01 19:57:00,7,Tip-Top and MCVicar; Thanks for your feedback.. I will be contacting Woman River(Doug)this week to get more information and look for openings in 2009. GeneT
566888,Jazzy Lu,2007-07-02 12:09:00,11,"We have been flying with Woman River and Gawleys Little Beaver(Doug and Gayle operate both) for many years and have been to most all their lakes. We are big into northerns and have landed them in the 30 lb class. Very exciting and they are still swimming around out there. Bertrand is awesome for northerns and Antenna is known for top quality genetics - nice big healthy northerns that snap! We always have good walleye fishing. too. The cabins are comfy and their boats and motors have always run like a top. Kapakick served us well for a few years but our favorites are probably still Antenna and Bertrand. Arial was good for walleyes, haven't fished Mcvicar. We book every year for opening but have gone during June and July also. Their pilot is great - smoothest and safest of any of the pilots we have been with. And to me that is a really important question when booking. -years experience. We are booked for next year at Antenna!!!!"
566894,Jazzy Lu,2007-07-02 14:25:00,11,"Hey McVicar- Do you go to McVicar every year ? This year was a cold one,eh? We were on Antenna for opening and had: straight snow, snow with wind, snow with sleet mixed in , pouring rain with heavy winds, and one day of sunshine. But we still caught many and ate well. Sure glad we had warm waterproof gear. But I will take the cold any day instead of sunshine and biting flies- . We had 3 northerns 20 plus but the biggest was 34lbs in 26 ft water on a jig-no leader - using a frozen salted sucker. We use salted minnows in May and have great luck with them. Woman River/Little Beaver has a class act don't they?"
566906,McVicar,2007-07-02 17:03:00,3,"We are on McVicar unless we get froze out. Then Doug puts us in somewhere that is thawed. The last couple we got put on were Arial and Grace. Yea - weather was horrible for picnicing, yet good for fishing. We made a run back to the camp with it snowing and sleeting sideways. The water froze up a couple of mornings, but thawed in the sun pretty fast. One day I put the umbrella in the front of the boat to block the wind and sleet. I'll try and post some pictures under my profile name. Those are some pretty monster Northern. We never tried the suckers, how large of suckers did you use? We do use mostly emerald shiners thawed on rock salt. Not sure if it's just the time of year or what, but something has to be said when the owner comes in on the mid-week check."
