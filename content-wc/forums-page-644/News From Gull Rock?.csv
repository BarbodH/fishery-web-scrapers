I'd put down my pole to light my cigar and then reel in and remove the fish. it was so crazy I stoppped using a spinner rig and tried a jig, something I don't usually use, and had the same results. my neighbour was a few hundred feet from me at another location on the hump and he had the same results. he went back yesterday and had the same experience."
