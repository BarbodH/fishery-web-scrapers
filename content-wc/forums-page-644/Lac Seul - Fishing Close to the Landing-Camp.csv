My theory is that the fishing close to the landing is as good or better than it is in the high profile/famous locations 20-40 miles out by boat. The basis for my theory is that I witness boat after boat blowing past me whenever I fish close to the landing/camp and when I make the long hauls I see just as many, if not more boats fishing close by than I do when I am closer to the landing. It simply boils down to pressure, and a lot of people think the fishing is better 30 miles up the lake than it is 3 miles up the lake. I have had great fishing on Lac Seul within 5 miles of the landing and I have had great fishing 30 miles from the landing. I am interested to hear what other Lac Seul fisherman have think about this."

Whether real or imagined people want to get away from other people, hence they travel farther to their fishing spots. The only reasons not to travel would be time and fuel. They have the time and the fuel doesn't matter so much, it's about getting away. Just be happy they aren't fishing your area's.:-)"

567256,Guest,2007-07-10 12:51:00,0,It is true that fishing can be good close to most camps on Lac Seul. However fishing can be fabulous when you get to some of the lesser fished areas on the right structure. But catching fish is just a bonus when you are taking in the glory that nature bestowed on Lac Seul. The back waters hold many treasures like the Moose and the Bear that prowl the shores and there are times on lac Seul far from a camp that you get the feeling that you might be the first man to have stood there.
567273,Guest,2007-07-10 17:44:00,0,"Lenny - you may be right, but I have to agree with a few others. One of the reasons I love to wander on Lac Seul is to find new places to fish, new places to pull up on shore and have lunch, and new places in general. Since I only get 7 days/year on LS, I want to make the most of it... plus, I have not had good experiences close to lodges/landings in recent years."

An area that holds them after spawning may be virtually deserted by all but small fish the rest of the summer. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby
