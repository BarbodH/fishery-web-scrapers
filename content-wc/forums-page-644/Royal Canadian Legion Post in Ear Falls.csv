Granted - I don't get in until real late (about 9 PM). I am a member of the American Legion in the states and was told that we are welcome at the Royal Canadian Legion posts. I just want to verify: 1. Are American Legion members welcome at Royal Canadian Legion posts? 2. Is the Ear Falls post open on Friday nights? 3. If so, does it serve alcohol? This Yank appreciates the sacrifice that the Canadian military is making in Afganistan."

567137,Springseeker,2007-07-08 20:07:00,96,I'm not familiar with Ear Falls but the answers to all questions is yes. You are VERY welcome in any Canadian Legion and will probably be offered some free rounds. Welcome and thanks for the kind words!
