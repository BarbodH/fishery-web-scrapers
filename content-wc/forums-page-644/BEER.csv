We tried some Lakeport Honey Lager. Very good. $30/case. I would expect the Lakeport Red would be good, as well. Of course our old stand-by Molson Canadian. $40/case. And we tried some Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale on my request. I had an idea of what to expect, and I was pleasantly surprised that it didn't taste at all like American microbrewed IPA's, but it was very good, nonetheless. I would buy it again. Unfortunately, it costs even more than the Canadian at $42/case. We only bought 2 cases, but we should have bought more, that was the beer we ran out of first. Also, when you stop into the Beer Store, don't forget to pick up a copy of CHILL magazine. An interesting read. Take it along to the little house out back."
567058,joeman79,2007-07-06 16:31:00,417,"need a few more suggestions for beer to try besides Busch light, my go to beer. LOL 24 days and a wake up and Ft. Frances here we come. I wish airline tickets were cheaper. 15 hr drive YUK but well worth it. Now more ideas for beer. I like pale ales and and one of my favs is Newcastle Brown ale. Want something like that to try. All suggestions appreeciated. Joe"

567103,Guest,2007-07-07 19:40:00,0,The duty free will be about $20 cheaper.

566843,joeman79,2007-06-30 20:41:00,417,"Wanting to take couple cases of different beer on fly in. Suggestions from WC posters would be appreciated and has to be in cans. Last time we did Molson and Labatts. Heard alot about Kokanee, wondering if it is a sippin beer or a lighter beer. 30 days and a 15 hr drive. Joe"
566846,reelman1,2007-06-30 21:48:00,276,"Definatly get some Kokenee. This has become our go-to beer in Canada. It's not a light beer but it's not a real heavy beer either, very similiar to standard Budwieser. Have fun looking for the Yeti!"
566851,Thunderstick,2007-07-01 05:29:00,35,"Kokanee is nice. Canadian beers available in cans are limited. A lot of great flavors are avalable in bottles, only. Labatts '50' Ale will get you to where you want to go as will Alexander Keith's Pale Ale, both available in cans."
566853,Guest,2007-07-01 09:47:00,0,I second that on Keiths. Try some Sleeman Cream Ale if you can get it in cans. Or get a six of some Sleeman to drink before you fly out.
566857,Jig A Lowe,2007-07-01 14:11:00,87,"While we on the subject of beer, does anyone know what the price per case (24) is at the Beer Stores in Ontario. I am interested in just your standard beers, e.g. Molson Golden, Labatts Blue, etc. Thanks."
566858,Thunderstick,2007-07-01 16:36:00,35,"Google up ""The Beer Store"""
566859,phishfearme,2007-07-01 18:21:00,1242,the beer store web site does not quote prices. $35Can is a good estimate - which i believe includes the deposit. phish
566866,Guest,2007-07-01 20:20:00,0,There are a lot of beers offered at the LCBO as well. Many small communities do not have a beer store. Canadians love their beer and we offer a great selection. Check out Steelback at LCBO...5.5 and comes in unbreakable plastic bottles with a screw on lid. Cans can and do get damaged. This is our choice on the tough ones.
566872,Thunderstick,2007-07-02 04:34:00,35,"Actually, it does. Once you've selected a brand, click on the ""Check Prices..."" tab at the bottom of the page."
566874,phishfearme,2007-07-02 05:26:00,1242,my error - thanks for pointing it out - very well hidden though. phish
