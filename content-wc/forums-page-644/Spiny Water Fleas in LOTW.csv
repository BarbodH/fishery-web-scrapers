Spiny water flea fears on rise for Lake of the Woods Migration of the invasive species downstream of Rainy River into Lake of the Woods just a matter of time By Reg Clayton for The Enterprise Saturday July 07, 2007 The troubled waters of Lake of the Woods may soon be playing host to another unwelcome guest. The spiny water flea could be joining the list of invasive species in the lake which already includes the rusty crayfish and rainbow smelt. This spring, Ministry of Natural Resources staff in Fort Frances captured the tiny crustaceans in drift nets set for larval sturgeon on Rainy River. The migration of the invasive species downstream into Lake of the Woods may just be a matter of time. If they're in the Rainy they should also be in the south basin of the Lake of the Woods, commented Lake of the Woods area biologist Barry Corbett. It will be here, it travels in water currents. It'll just take a while, concurred Hayley Anderson, invasive species summer student with the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters. Anderson, an ecosystem management student at Sir Sandford Fleming College, was distributing information bulletins from the LOWDPOA kiosk at the Kenora Farmer's Market Wednesday advising anglers and boaters what they can do to prevent introducing spiny water flea and other invasive species into area lakes. Thoroughly draining outboard engines, live wells washing boats and fishing gear with hot water after use is the first step and, as the eggs are almost indestructible, the equipment should be left to dry in the sun for at least five days before relaunching or angling in another waterway. The threat posed by spiny water flea on resident species is multi-fold. The zoo plankton, or water bugs, are native to Europe and Asia and according to MNR were introduced to the Great Lakes from the ballast water of ocean crossing vessels. Since first detected in 1982, spiny water flea has spread throughout the Great Lakes and is now established in some inland lakes and rivers in Ontario and Minnesota. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources includes Rainy Lake, Namakan Lake and Lake of the Woods on its list of lakes infested with spiny water flea. The predatory crustacean belongs to the same family as shrimp, crayfish, lobsters and is related to another invasive species; the fishhook water flea. Measuring from one to one-and-a-half centimetre in length, the spiny water flea has a large black eye and along, spiny tail. It also has four sets of legs and powerful mandibles which it uses to grasp and shred its prey. It feeds voraciously on smaller zoo plankton thereby depriving the native fish species of a food source. Fish feeding on the spiny water flea either cough it up or it becomes embedded in their digestive track due to its barbed tail. The spiny water flea is a particularly tenacious invader as it is parthenogenetic  the females reproduce sexually and asexually so they don't require a mate to lay one to 10 eggs every two weeks resulting in a hatch of identical female offspring. In certain situations of environmental stress, females may also produce males, mate and lay resting eggs' which remain dormant for long periods of time before hatching."
