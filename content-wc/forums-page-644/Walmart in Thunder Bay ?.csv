567130,Oldschool,2007-07-08 18:21:00,163,"Bode, I couldn't help but notice that you are headed to Armstrong. Sorry to hijack a thread, but it appears you all have answered the question quite nicely. I am going to Armstrong this year for the first time and have planned a fly-in with Due North. Usually we do a drive-in lodge near to Ear Falls, so this is really different. Given that Armstrong is fairly small, do you happen to have any experience with Due North? Thanks much, Roy"

567140,Guest,2007-07-09 03:30:00,0,"Sorry Roy, I don't have any knowledge of Due North's operation. We quit doing fly-ins about 6 years ago due to higher costs, had done a fly-in each year since around 1985 usually through Leuenbergers out of Nakina. We now fish Caribou Lake and stay at a boat in camp there. Have had very good fishing with decent cabins, good equipment, and MUCH lower costs. You might run a ""search"" here and find out something--I see several posts about other fly-in operations out of Armstrong such as Mattice. If you stay in Armstrong or are there to have a meal before flying out, EJ's is a pretty good place to eat. Have a great trip."

567078,Catman59,2007-07-07 06:38:00,345,"Hey guys is there a Walmart or other ""box store"" on the west side of TB ? My trip got changed around and I will be crossing at Pigeon River. We usually grab our licenses etc at Walmart in Dryden. If not is there a bait shop before you get to Ignace that sells license? ( only 5 more Softball games and we get to head north !!!)Thanks :thanks2:"
567083,Guest,2007-07-07 07:16:00,0,"There is a WalMart on the west side of Thunder Bay, down by the lake. Good prices if you need stuff, but, typically crowded. Try Kakabeca Falls for license and/or bait. Much easire to negotiate."
567095,Guest,2007-07-07 13:48:00,0,We always get ours at the truck stop half way between Kakebeka Falls and Ignace. Easy and nice people.
567108,Catman59,2007-07-07 20:56:00,345,Thats good info. Thanks a bunch.
567125,Pooch,2007-07-08 15:24:00,4619,"Bait shops from Pigeon River all the way to Ignace. Try ""Larry's Bait Shop"" in Kakebeka Falls (Which is located between Thunder Bay and Ignace)1-807-473-9321. or ""Verne's Minnows"" in Ignace 1-807-934-2254. Both located on Rt.17 in the respective town. Both places sell bait and licenses. Really should order your bait ahead though. Pooch"

567128,Guest,2007-07-08 17:58:00,0,"I checked with the visitor center at the Pigeon River crossing and they told me that they sell licenses now. The money exchange has not reopened as of yet, though. Also, not sure of the hours for the visitor center. We'll be going through in 19 days headed to Armstrong--won't get here soon enough."
