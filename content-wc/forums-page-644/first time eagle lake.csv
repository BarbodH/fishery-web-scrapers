I have found the best bet is to call your lodge owners ahead of time, to see what the patterns are looking like for your time frame. We go in mid-July, and our big question is always whether the mayfly hatch was late, and whether the walleyes are on the reefs yet. I'm not sure what the September pattern would be, but your lodge owners will know. Also, there is a lodge on the lake that posts pretty good, up to date reports on the action, particularly for musky:http://www.andymyerslodge.com/reports.htm Have fun and good luck! Dave"

Watch the message board at northshorelodgeontario.com as that lodge is within a few miles of yours and will be fishing the same waters. I have never stayed at Eagle lake lodge, however, myself and a few of my fishing buddies have dealt with their owners. They are some of the nicest people around. Contact them and they will surely help you out. As for rocks, be very careful when traveling to the EAST of Stanton island. Walleyes will be on reefs. They are not difficult to find at that time. Best of luck."
