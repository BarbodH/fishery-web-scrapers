566712,Guest,2007-06-27 17:31:00,0,I am planning a trip to this lake because of all the great reports of being a great fishery. The only problem I have is I dont know what the fish do in this lake(migration routes) So my question is would I find fish and walleye in decent numbers at the south end away from the dams? I plan on staying at Saskatuwan Landing provincial park but want to make sure that I dont have to travel towards the dams to get some real trophies. Any info will be helpful Thanks

566863,Guest,2007-07-01 19:27:00,0,They have the landing tourney July 21/22 this year (i think) and the catches are there but it isn't known as a big fish tourney . Riverhurst is a central loction allowing you to run either way . The landing can also be ugly for garbage floating if alberta has any good rains. Garbage like rail ties and telephone poles so you have to watch out also watch for sand bars if you go west of the park . Hope that helps.

There are Several spots Within 15 Miles of the park. One word of advice though....Travel east on the water and don't waste the gas going west..Good luck, and save some for me.

566887,Guest,2007-07-02 11:28:00,0,Thanks sounds good. One more question what are the chances this lake will give me a personal record walleye?. I got a 9.75lbs out of some lake in Alberta. I once herd you can get walleye up to 14lbs and avearge 6-7lbs. Would this be at least a little true?
566892,T Mac,2007-07-02 12:45:00,10084,"Naw... they don't average 6-7 pounds. If they did, I'd go there more often :) LOL!"
566902,Guest,2007-07-02 15:35:00,0,"No they don't average 6-7 lbs. But the last does house some big fish. I myself have a personal record of 12.7lbs from the lake but i also did see a 14 lb come out of the mouth of the creek about a mounth ago. I fish this lake alot due to the fact i only live 30 miles away, and there are big fish. just gotta find them. In august i would be in 12 to 17 feet of water and i would be pullin blades if you are looking for size. I myself have alot of luck this way."

There is some pretournament discussion starting up that may give you some good info. Dief is a great lake to fish but at this time of year if you are looking to catch your personal best you would probably have a better chance at Last Mountain lake or the Sask river at Nipawin or Tobin Lake resort.
