6280208,BornToFish,2019-01-18 11:03:00,1224,"Greetings, As ProV mentioned in an earlier post today, it's the kind of day when folks just stay inside and think warm thoughts in order to stay warm. Naturally, I started thinking about recent fishing seasons and the upcoming fishing season. From time to time and for various reasons, anglers sometimes switch lakes for their fishing vacation in NW Ontario. This means that these anglers need to learn a new body of water. This could mean learning how the seasonal movements of fish apply to the new body of water, location of structure and possibly new fishing techniques. My wife and I made a switch a few years ago. Looking back, it took me about seven weeks of fishing (spread over three seasons, the individual weeks were at different times of the season) to feel confident and comfortable on this new body of water. If you switched the body of water that you fished, how long did it take you to become confident in your fishing ability on the new body of water? Did you find anything to be helpful in shortening your learning curve for your new body of water? Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6280216,Pooch,2019-01-18 11:44:00,4618,"Did you find anything to be helpful in shortening your learning curve for your new body of water?FWIW, this is what I do.I locate maps of the lake. If possible a couple different maps and start to learn the lake a little bit.I talk to guys who have fished that water. (about the same time of year, if possible) The guys here on WC are always good at sharing basic information. People that share with me I return the favor.Before I hit the new (to me) water, I have a good feel for the lake. About the only time I've struggled is fishing the north end of Lac Seul. I had never encountered so much sand and on occasion that sand part still stumps me.New water keeps life interesting, but the familiar feel of a known lake is soul food for old guys.Pooch"
6280248,prov1800,2019-01-18 12:58:00,5010,New waters are the best.ive fished in the vermilion bay area since I moved here in 1980 for my rail road job.its been exciting learning all the lakes in the area and some farther away.the big lakes were the toughest meaning eagle and lac suel.just can't learn them in a few weeks.took years.but fun years camping on the lakes with the kids and dogs.lol.usually meant 2 trips to the camp sites.i have over 2000 waypoints that iam always confident in.still always looking for another honey hole.being able to fish say I can fish from earfalls to siouxlookout on lac suel took a bit of doing or buzzard falls to nivens bay on eagle took many outings.having been a fishing guide helped out a lot.always gave me the chance to expand my areas and slowly learn them.but just having spots didn't mean success all the time either.a guy still needs to know diff techniques as well and needs to know fish movement and and the seasons.seems like everyone wants to fish the other end of the lake from where there staying and visa versus for guys at the other end.lol.i get a k√¨ck out of that.best of luck to you guys.stay calm on new waters it's not all about the catching.
6280418,dvl2700,2019-01-19 07:49:00,371,"We had a group go to a new lake in Canada. One of the guys grabbed the seasonal help and offered him money if he could help us get on fish. Did that two days and the summer college guy helped a lot. We fed him and treated him like family the rest of the week. The owner even told him to stop fraternizing with us, until we told the owner he was not taking advantage of us. We had plenty of food and he was a gentleman around our wives and daughters. At the end of the week we pooled our money and gave him a substantial tip. He thanked us and said the last group of guys were real jerks, didn't catch much because they didn't ask. TIP; go with someone who has been there, or ask the hired help what works and where. Also as previously mentioned, get a map, use Google Earth, ask questions on this site to people who have been there."
6282602,Aspencreek,2019-01-25 09:47:00,2911,"Learning, or having to learn a New body of water....makes my hair stand up with stress just thinking about it. That said, my first 2 trips to LS were fun, exciting and we caught some fish. But if I would compare it to the trips to the same water we do now......they were a disaster!! When I look back we didn't do much of anything right. Those fish we caught had to have been straight out of the sheltered workshop class, or just really hungry. But we all know the saying ""even a blind squirrel finds a nut once in a while"". But we fished and used the tactics we use around here and blindly went where no man should go. It took hiring a guide for 2 days on the 3rd trip to get me to the point where I was even comfortable venturing out. Asking him questions, why, where. Now we try learning new techniques, trying something different, exploring new waters (slowly) and watching for depth changes and weed lines. Hard vs soft shorelines, forage, wind, and weather patterns. Finding a new spot or spots is a goal every trip, sometimes what I find is where not to go. And all of that took at least 5-7 weeks of learning the lake. And for me half the fun of the day is putting it all down in a recap in the laptop. Maybe I will review, but sometimes it's just to remember later. I really feel for those guys who come up and are all excited and struggle. Or go out on the first day and get turned around and are lost. Our group has tried to help those groups when we come across them, but some guys just won't listen or even try. I could go on for another 10 paragraphs, but it is what it is. My good friend has taken 3 trips with his brother the last 3 years. His brother will ONLY JIG. Last year they caught 34 walleye, total, for the WEEK. That is a OK morning, and I'm sure most of you will agree. I got to meet his brother for the first time last weekend. The conversation started with ""you and I in the same boat would not be a good idea"". But after about an hour we decided we should try it sometime. We are a brotherhood, we all share a common goal, some priorities differ, but we can all succeed in this adventure with the help of others."
6282608,Pooch,2019-01-25 10:16:00,4618,"Aspencreek got me to thinking and chuckling about my approach to fishing.I travel and I travel a lot when hunting fish. When guys get in my boat they are going to see a lot of the lake. I just can't bring myself to park in one spot and not catch fish or wait for a group of fish to periodically bump into my offering. I'm sure I drive by some active fish, but to fish the same ""spot"" or ""spots"" all week would make me crazy.I love hunting fish, even more than actually catching a boat full of fish. To find a new bunch of uneducated fish is reward enough for me.My love of new scenery is tempered by also finding new hazards. My head is on a swivel when moving in unknown water. If you could wear out the depth finder screen by watching it then I would have worn out a lot of screens over the years. Speed isn't your friend in new or unknown water.A new lake can be overwhelming, but once you get the ""rhythm"" of a lake things really fall in place.Pooch"
6282740,BornToFish,2019-01-26 04:42:00,1224,"Greetings,The last two posts on this thread resonated with me, so I thought I would offer some comments in follow-up.My first trip to Canada in 2001 was an awakening of sorts. The good thing about that trip was that I recognized the incredible beauty of the lake and its potential for very good fishing. The bad about that trip was that we struggled to catch fish. I fished on that trip in the same way that I fished on my home waters in Wisconsin. I realized that I needed to make changes in how and where we fished to tap into the great fishing that lake had to offer.I hired a guide for a day toward the end of that first week of fishing. The guide was entertaining and put us on fish. We had a great day together. Unfortunately, the guide wasn't a ""teacher"". As I mentioned, we saw the potential that day of what lakes in NW Ontario had to offer. I pretty much re-invented myself as a fisherman in the following years. The changes that I made were the foundation for the books that I wrote.I too have witnessed anglers that struggle to catch fish on their one week of vacation. I believe that some of these anglers were in the same situation that I was in during my first week of fishing in 2001. These anglers were grateful for any and all help that others offered to them.On the other hand, I am pretty sure that other struggling anglers were just pounding square pegs into round holes, in hopes of outlasting the fish and teaching them a lesson. I learned over time that anglers that pound pegs are usually not receptive to change, and in extreme situations were resentful of help offered to them. Now, I usually wait for the anglers to ask for help, rather than me offering unsolicited help.One thing that I learned on my trips fishing in NW Ontario is that the lake is almost teaching those that are paying attention and willing to learn. It seems that I learn something on every fishing trip - new spots to fish or employing a different technique/presentation. I like having an array of places to fish on the lake and techniques to present a fishing lure. This knowledge gives me confidence when I am on the lake, that I will catch nice fish no matter what Mother Nature comes up with for me to deal with.I keep a journal to record my thoughts and the things that I learned on each trip - what worked, what did not work, weather conditions, lake conditions, etc.. It seems that writing things down causes me to clarify my thoughts. I frequently refer to my journal before each fishing trip.I appreciated Pooch's comment about the lake having a rhythm. I believe that my journal and its knowledge helps me recognize the rhythm and how to respond to it.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6282806,Aspencreek,2019-01-26 10:07:00,2911,"All good points. I started making notes on my laptop too along with saving pictures, more for helping me remember and reviewing, rather than trying to formulate a game plan, although it does help. We have all run into those ""square pegs' guys. They are going to do it their way come **** or high water, and the ""teach the fish a lesson"" comment was perfect. A few years back there was a family of 3 in Camp and they struggled the first 2 days. Dad, Mom and a young man about 12 went out each morning and came in with a couple each day. The young man was very interested in our boats and tackle and said he was not catching much, so when we came in to clean he was right there to watch. I asked him if he would like to go out with me after dinner and to go ask his folks. We went out that night and caught a few and he was all smiles. The next day he asked if we could go out again only adding mom. I didn't think that was a good idea, if you get my drift, but I asked if dad wanted to go along. So we went out and hit a late day slip bobber/Lindy rig spot off a point. Dad sat there and jigged, while Jr and I reeled in 24-26""ers. He was bound and determined that his way was the only way. When we got back, Dad and I sat at the dock and talked about spots, tactics, techniques, bait...everything, and made sure that he understood that we were trying to help, not undermine him. Since my boat partner doesn't want to go out after dinner, I went out with Dad and Jr the rest of the trip every evening, showing them some new things to try and showing him spots to try with mom during the day. It was a great experience for me, I got to share. The spots I found don't belong to me and are far from secret's. Now recalling it, I think I got more out of than anybody."
