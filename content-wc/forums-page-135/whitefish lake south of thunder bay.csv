1286308,trickyc,2011-03-24 10:49:00,2,anyone ever fished this lake? heading up there for the first time and was wondering what to expect for fish. is it a good walleye lake? also if anyone that fished it could give me some pointers on what to use and maybe a couple spots they had luck. im going the first week of june and have never fished in canada before. thanks WW
1286494,Guest,2011-03-24 17:45:00,0,If this is the lake that is about 45 min. southwest of Thunder Bay then it is more of a perch lake than anything else. Most of the lake is under ten feet deep with a deep hole on the west side of the island and a deep though on the far southwest shore. My fater-in-law goes each year in August for perch only and does catch an occasional walleye but they are small. Lake-link has a thread on a message board about the lake where you could also get some info.
