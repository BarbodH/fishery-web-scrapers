While listening to it I knew that voice from other video's I had watched on Walleye Central. It was that Limeyangler from Dryden and as usual was well done.

6283710,Limeyangler,2019-01-28 19:54:00,563,"LOL. My voice gives me away every time. A couple of times this summer I was shopping in town here and had people shout out ""hey Simon!"" as they had overheard me talking. I'd turn around to see people I had never seen before coming towards me to shake hands, so this is fame eh? i just want to know when i get paid.....lol."

6283782,Limeyangler,2019-01-29 04:41:00,563,"Its been a hobby of mine for 10 years now, just making videos when i'm out and about. People have often told me I should at least be getting free stuff from companies that cater to outdoor activities. My issue with this is that I then turn my videos into WFN type shows which are more like infomercials for products. I am working on other avenues to make some moolah from my hobby at the moment, have some sponsorship coming from my home town municipal office to do some promotional stuff, small amount but a start. I get a small amount of money from youtube a month which would barely cover gas/bait for one trip. I will just tick along as always, making videos of what I love and share it."
