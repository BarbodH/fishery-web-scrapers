6282184,Bringwolski,2019-01-24 01:42:00,7,"Hi all,I'm planning my first trip to lac seul this summer. The 2 lodges I am looking at have an opening the week of june 8th near ear falls, or june 29th at fishermans cove south of ear falls. Just looking for input on if any time period was better than the other. We would prefer jigging vs bottom bouncers or trolling if that makes a difference. Thanks for the help"
6282258,prov1800,2019-01-24 08:18:00,5010,in my view there is no difference as far as catching fish on either date.earlier will have you somewhat shallower and the north end has very good fishing at that time.jigging is my preferred technique most of the time through out spring till fall.lac suel is a jigging lake very rarely will I troll.Seems to me most people staying up on the north end tend to make the long runs to the mackemzie bay area.Not sure why they would make a long run like that while passing hundreds of great fishing spots.Fishing from fishermans cove will put you closer to the Bay of islands and Mackenzie bay.Fishwill be going somewhat deeper that time but not much.Lac seuls walleye like shallow water and can be found shallower than most people know.but either date would be awesome.better grab a spot they wont last long

Classic walleye spots first, windy shorelines and points, feeding shelves, transitioning to near short humps. This is walleye 101 boss. Don't overcomplicate it."
6282390,jimwalleye,2019-01-24 14:32:00,30,"I can't speak for the lodges close to Ear Falls that early but I do know that fishing Fisherman's Cove in late May has been a challenge because the walleyes are spawning in Broad Lake which is a fantastic time to catch some big ones but non spawning grounds were tough for us that early in the middle of the lake. It's a bit of a run up to Broad. Since your Fisherman Cove date is close to July I know that's an excellent time for that mid lake basin. The size and quality of walleyes during that time are excellent. I'm sure you could catch walleyes near Ear Falls too that early as I'm sure it's near some spawning grounds. Good Luck, go twice if you can."
6282406,prov1800,2019-01-24 15:12:00,5010,"Problem with fishing spawning areas both near earfalls and south to the bay of islands is that every tom,dick and Harry goes to those places.drove me nuts to travell to broad and sunlight and have 30 plus boats in there.you got 4 camps sending people there.scout bay lodge,fisherman's cove,onaway and lac suel lodge.and some boats come from earfalls because the wenesah river and sawmill bay are loaded with boats to.ive found fish closer years ago already.i don't catch the numbers but still put a lot of fish in the boat and some good sized ones.and NO crowds.my guests don't mind catching a few less fish and enjoy not having some other boat on top of you.not every fish spawns in one spot.lots shore spawn all over the place."
6282506,rather-be-fishin,2019-01-24 21:48:00,429,"There are good resorts & fishing areas by Ear Falls. However, June 8th is early in the fishing season and weather can still be unpredictable & cool at that time. June 29th will have warmer weather & Fisherman's Cove is a nice resort in a good location near good fishing areas. My preference would be June 29th at Fisherman's Cove! It's a good idea to hire a guide early on the trip to show you safe travel routes because there is a lot of hidden hazards & will show you fishing techniques that are working & put you on good fishing spots. Lac Seul is a great fishery & you won't be disappointed! Good luck! RBF"
6282526,Aspencreek,2019-01-25 04:53:00,2911,"In my experiences what has been said is DEAD on! Early season the fish are concentrated in numbers in spawning areas and you will have to travel (sometimes a good distance) and deal with traffic to to get to them. There ARE other early season spots that do hold a good number of spawning fish, but if I told you where on this forum, those would be loaded with boats too. Mid year...later June or July, has it's advantages. Warmer weather, the weed lines are defined, the big fish are were they live all summer, and patterns are pretty simple. So that was a long reason why June 29 at Fisherman's would be my choice too. It is closer to LOT""S of good mid lake areas and a really nice camp. And if you have not booked it by the time you read this it may have already been booked by someone else, DO NOT WAIT. And finally.....knowing how to get around is VERY important. LS is NOT a bowl, there are travel routes that can keep you from trouble, but you have to know them. RBF is dead on, hire a guide for at least 1 day and have him show you some spots, safe travel routes, and patterns to keep you from wasting your entire week. It took me 10 yrs. to begin to understand LS, and I learn something new every time out."
