I asked Jack and he was more than a little excited, only problem now is when I tell him to clean his room he tells me to contact his agent....lololol. Anyway, Tyler (the EDO) asked to come fishing sometime too, so off we went. Family, new friends and some fish, good day had by all.VIDEOhttps://youtu.be/SpjLf2aGIKM"
