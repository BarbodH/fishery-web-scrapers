With our new found freedom to pick and chose dates for a fishing trip, I decided to book a 5 day trip at Stork Lake Lodge the second week of Sept.,2019. While we have done numerous July and early August Ontario family fishing trips, this will be our first trip later in the year. Our primary focus will be finding walleyes and using a jig with live bait for presentation. Being new to the lake, I also plan to get a guide for a day or two early in the trip. Any other advice on fishing Stork Lake walleyes during this timeframe would be greatly appreciated."
