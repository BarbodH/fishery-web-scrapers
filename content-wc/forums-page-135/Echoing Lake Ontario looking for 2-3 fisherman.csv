6280804,wdkott,2019-01-20 12:37:00,26,"This is the first time I have ever tried reaching out to others regarding a fishing trip, but I have exhausted all my contacts and have come up short on the party size needed to go back to the lodge where I experienced the best fishing experience of my life. I fished at the very remote Echoing Lake Lodge last September and was simply blown away. Lots of 30 inch plus pike, and two 47 inch pike were landed. Everyone in our party has at least a 39 inch pike. Lots of lake trout up on the spawning reefs as well, lots 26-32 inch, with largest being a 35, 35, and a 38. I just posted specifics about the trip and it's fabulous fishing on the Canada Fishing Guide website under ""Trip Reports"" if you'd like more information. I have 5 fisherman who want to go back to Echoing Lake Lodge, leaving me short of the 8 required. I am reaching out to see if 2 or 3 others might be interested. The trip is a little pricey for Ontario but I can tell you firsthand the fishing is outstanding, comparable to those lodges in the northern reaches of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and NW Territories but at half the price. I consider this the trip of a lifetime at a bargain price when looked at from this angle. I have the week of September 15-22 2019 booked, but will have to give up this prime lake trout spawning time if I can't get another 2-3 fisherman (I have one on the fence right now). Deposits are $1000 and I'm sure I can arrange for you to send directly to Shaun if you like. PM me if you are interested in finding out more. Lastly, I am not affiliated in any way with Echoing Lake Lodge. I just really, really, really want to go back."
6280808,That Minnesota guy,2019-01-20 12:45:00,8293,This a fly in or drive in?
6280814,Namegosikaa,2019-01-20 13:13:00,61,"Very long fly, but I find this location very interesting. They also have brook trout at the yelling lake camp which is a part of the God's river system. Definitely on my bucket list."
6280822,wdkott,2019-01-20 13:54:00,26,"Echoing Lake is about a 2 hour fly in from Sioux Lookout. It is very remote, and very close to the border of Manitoba.I'm not sure about the brook trout, although with the camp's Beaver floatplane I would think one could explore possible brook trout locations."

6280884,That Minnesota guy,2019-01-20 15:51:00,8293,"Good luck, I'm sure you will find a guy or two who can go."
6281304,Golden Eagle,2019-01-21 13:38:00,2642,You have come up with 5. Pressure the other 4 to find 3 more. Lose the American Plan feature and you can find equal fishing in NW Ontario lakes for less than half the price you're paying and you won't need to come us with a party of 8 to receive the best price. I've fished 3 that are close to your favorite lake.
6281318,bthomas3333,2019-01-21 13:53:00,465,Just wondering what are the three outposts close to Echoing that you can fish for less than $1200 without American Plan?B-
6281408,Golden Eagle,2019-01-21 16:07:00,2642,"Whoops, sorry I mislead you. I was thinking a party or 2 or 4 or 5. I'm not into pushing other camps, just suggesting the OP might not cancel or pay higher rate as there are plenty of good lakes with great fishing. It seems that Echoing keeps costs down by using larger aircraft and want to be at full capacity when flying. Nothing wrong with that. I suggest OP call his outfitter to see if another party is short on bodies and might join his for flight/cabin."
6281412,bthomas3333,2019-01-21 16:21:00,465,No big deal. I've flown out of Red Lake a number of times and a few of the places are 100 miles or so North of Red Lake. This looks to be another 125-150 further north. Remote isnt always better but I am also always scouting for new water:-)B-
