6282424,Limeyangler,2019-01-24 15:36:00,563,"Hi all, Got out around 10am and was set up by 11. Apart from a lull at the beginning from 1 pm to 3 pm had a real hoot with some nice 14Â” crappie, a bunch of small feisty sauger, a pike and walleye on light tackle. I don't usually feature in my videos, but I forgot my spare camera batteries and had to mount it on the pop up in order to charge the camera directly. By the way, any of you folk that use a Mavic drone, they work fine in sub zero temperatures, just stick an adhesive toe warmer on the battery and off you go, -20C is the coldest I've flown and it worked flawlessly.VIDEOhttps://youtu.be/Fjj-2je1bZ4"

It can follow behind, side, circle while following, stay still and track an object with the camera...etc...etc. Its a nifty little gadget."

BillThe heater melted a bit of snow off the ground inside, but it was the pressure on the ice that caused the hole to flood, lots of slush on the lakes here at the moment."
