6277316,ljcs789,2019-01-10 09:40:00,42,"Suggestions on NW Ontario fly in or drive in for group of 6-8. My two boys and a couple brother in laws and sons. Looking for primarily walleye with a decent northern thrown in for fun. Places that give a good discount for under 18 would be helpful. If I can keep cost under $1000 per guy would be great. We have been to Wilderness North in the past (little spendy) Hearst Air-great people, fishing there was ok as we were on smaller lake (McLeister) but looking for closer to MN. Also have done some drive-ins, BearPaw and Stanley's, but looking for less lake to figure out with more consistent fishing. Thanks for all the help. Love Walleye Central for great info!!"

6277734,neldog257,2019-01-11 07:57:00,16,Give Ryan or Vern a call at Slate Falls Fly In. They run a special on Miniss L starting in July. We went last year and had a great time. Ryan even spent the first day with our group and showed us a bunch of spots on the lake. The cabins are very nice as are the boats and motors. Fishing was very good. Lots of 17-23 inch walleyes and some decent norts caught while jigging. I have been on 30 plus fly ins and Slate Falls is certainly a first rate outfitter.
6277770,stjoeguy,2019-01-11 09:06:00,979,Consider Camp Lake St. Joseph. The price is right and the walleye fishing is fantastic. Lake St. Joe is hard to beat for consistent walleye numbers. The lake is big but Doug will mark spots for you or even guide for a day. Talk with Doug or Shelley at the Northwest Sportshow in Minneapolis. https://www.lakestjoseph.com/index.php For fancier digs on Lake St. Joseph try Old Post Lodge: https://oldpost.com

Not sure if it is a plus or a minus with teenagers, but Viking Island has WIFI. With 20+ trips under my belt I would be happy to mark up a map for you if you decide to go that route.Brett"
