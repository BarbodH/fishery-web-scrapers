6276022,Obabikon,2019-01-06 11:04:00,2370,"Bill... you should try them again. The new owners have done a fantastic job of managing the show. I'm not sure about Milwaukee, but I know that all the booth space in Green Bay and Chicago has been sold out. (at least that's what I was told)"

6278748,Jwendt15,2019-01-14 06:29:00,72,"Saw this post on the forum and decided to make the drive to the Chicago show from Grand Rapids, MI. To anyone who is looking for their next potential spot, this is the place to go. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested. Could have spent two days talking to all of the outfitters. More than enough information available to find the right place you're looking for. Prov: Sorry I missed you, noticed your post this morning after getting back."
6279106,prov1800,2019-01-14 20:47:00,5010,Maybe next time.diffently was was a good show with huge crowds.hope you found what you were looking.
6279592,prov1800,2019-01-16 09:23:00,5010,Made it back home Monday night from the Chicago show.Want to say thanks to the wc guys that stopped by the booth.Always nice to see people in person.Brought Clarke's vehicle back to camp on Edward lake and figured I might as well catch some supper.caught 4 walleyes again within 5-6 minutes.stayed a bit longer and caught a BUNCH more.amazing spot. If anyone needs more info you can message or go on the website.www.clarkesresorts.com
6272112,Obabikon,2018-12-26 07:44:00,2370,"This is actually the first year in 40+ years that Obabikon will not be attending the Milwaukee Journal show. I thought the new owners would change the direction, but they actually accelerated the downhill slide."
6272130,BornToFish,2018-12-26 08:15:00,1224,"Greetings, It seemed to me that the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel sport show featured fewer and fewer Canadian fishing and hunting lodges as the years went by. The last time that I attended the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel sport show was in 2015. I still have a clear recollection for that year that folks were just passing by the booths for the Canadian lodges, without stopping to converse or pick up brochures. The people representing the fishing lodges were just standing in their booths with little to do. I completely understand Obabikon's comment about passing on the Journal-Sentinel sport show this year. Fishing lodges need to wisely use their marketing budgets. I can only imagine the costs for a fishing lodge to attend a trade show: the fee to have the booth at the show, travel, hotels, restaurants, time away from home, etc.. The lodges must sell several cabins at a trade show to just break even. I wasn't seeing this happen at the Journal-Sentinel sport show. Kindest regards....."
6272154,coldtuna,2018-12-26 08:51:00,25,"I am fairly new to fishing in Canada, but have fished many saltwater destinations the last 20 years. My son and I have attended the All Canada show in Chicago the last two years. I find it very helpful to meet the lodge owners face to face, discuss their fishery, etc. at the All Canada show. We booked our 2018 trip through a lodge and operator we met at the 2017 show, and two of our 2019 trips are booked with operators we met there in January 2018. I do research on the internet, but the show is an inexpensive way for me to follow up internet research with face to face dialogue. I am going this year primarily to investigate options for my son and I in 2020, as well as to consider options for a couple other Canada trips with friends in 2020. I hope the show succeeds long run."
6272190,BornToFish,2018-12-26 10:19:00,1224,"Greetings, The approach outlined by ColdTuna is a very solid one! I believe it's wise for folks to do some homework on the internet in advance of the All Canada Show. This way, they can screen and prioritize fishing lodges to target during their visit to the All Canada Show. I did exactly that during the years when my wife and I were searching for lodges to book a fishing trip. We spent time at the booths of the lodges of potential interest to chat with the lodge owners AND any guests of the lodge that were visiting the booth. I had my list of questions. My wife had a slightly different list of questions. We found that there was a lot of pertinent information that could be learned in fifteen minutes of discussion that would have never surfaced browsing the internet alone. Some fishing lodges fell off the list whereas others climbed up the list. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6272638,Hwy 101,2018-12-28 00:07:00,33,"The information on websites lodges provide can certainly answer a lot of question. I feel talking to the lodge owners and camp managers in person gives me a better insight on how the camp is run. With some owners I just felt we were not on the same page after talking to them, and passed on booking. Asking some of the current and former guests question can also be very helpful. Do spots get crowded? How much of an effect have weather fronts had on their trips? What hours of the day to they need to fish to catch walleyes? If the only way to catch fish are small windows of time at sunrise and sunset then I am concerned about the overall quality of the lake. The last couple of years the All Canada show in Green Bay seemed crowded with groups that were actively booking trips."
6274276,HeHooksHimself,2019-01-01 20:43:00,725,Doc and I are heading to Milwaukee and planning on attending the show Thursday night and Friday for supper. If you see two old farts wondering where the bathroom is stop us and say hello. Hooks
6274356,pjshorthorn,2019-01-02 07:48:00,5654,Howdy Jeff !!!My suggestion would be to not worry about where the restrooms are. Just ask the salesperson if you and Doc can get inside a boat you love and see what kind of livewell space it has. Just don't cross the streams.....nothing good will happen if you cross the streams. It is Milwaukee.....they will understand if you have a beer in your hand PjShorthorn
6274728,HeHooksHimself,2019-01-02 21:44:00,725,"Thanks Pat, we don't need restrooms, we will just cut off a bleach bottle. We will just need a place to dump it. thanks for the help! Hooks"
6275894,RichA$1970,2019-01-05 20:48:00,1159,Went Thursday night as I was up that way for work n it was nice n not too busy. Probably 70 outfitters there n the Franklin facility was clean n good to go. Going to go next week to St Charles Show w some old friends to try to narrow it down.
6275972,Bill Krejca,2019-01-06 09:06:00,6107,"Used to enjoy the older All Canada shows, but the shrinking participation and reasons why sort of eventually became evident. I have a small collection of the year embossed spoons which they gave away, which I treasure. I was not impressed with the walleye dinners, the fish being obtained by netting, which were offered - offered to a completely wrong client base, in my humble opinion. Bill"
6271668,BornToFish,2018-12-24 12:34:00,1224,"Greetings, I received an email from the sponsors of the popular All Canada Show, announcing the dates of the upcoming All Canada Shows: Milwaukee Show - Jan. 3-6, 2019 Chicago Show - Jan. 10-13, 2019 Green Bay Show- Jan. 17-20, 2019 The new owners of the All Canada Show have done a fantastic job revitalizing the show in terms of fishing lodges, vendors, speakers and the like. My wife and I will be attending the show in Green Bay, WI. We enjoy strolling the aisles to check out the various fishing and hunting lodges. We always enjoy renewing friendships and talking about the upcoming fishing season. Folks contemplating a fishing vacation in Canada would do well to spend an afternoon at one of the shows to interview prospective lodge owners - the people behind the websites. I understand that information about the shows is available at AllCanada.com. I am not associated with the All Canada Shows. Thus, I am not profiting by this thread. Good fishing and tight lines!"
6271686,That Minnesota guy,2018-12-24 13:25:00,8293,"Interesting that all the shows are in the Green Bay to Chicago corridor. I wonder if that is where ownership is from or where all the bookings come from? Personally I would think other markets might provide a better return for the buck. But, I bet the lodge owners like not having to travel much. Hope everyone does well."
6271696,kettyspanky,2018-12-24 13:55:00,271,I took the family and went to the show for the first time last year. My kids are 6 and 10 and had fun. Plenty to do and see for all. Can't wait for next years shows which are not far off. Thanks for the reminder.
6271722,BornToFish,2018-12-24 15:11:00,1224,"Greetings, The All Canada Show finally went under several years ago - maybe around 2014/2015 or so. The show was getting smaller and generally more feeble with each passing season. Some new owners took the show over a year after it went under. I vaguely recollect hearing that the new owners are from Wisconsin. The All Canada Show underwent a dramatic transformation with the new owners. The show again has considerable energy and vibrancy. I believe the new owners started out with the All Canada Show in Chicago and Green Bay. I am fairly certain that they added the Milwaukee show this year. This is likely a good move as the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel show was becoming pretty irrelevant to people looking to go to Canada for a hunting or fishing trip. I wouldn't be surprised if the new owners of the All Canada Show add other venues in upcoming years, as they are doing good work with their show. Kindest regards...."
6271776,btyreprich,2018-12-25 04:57:00,1067,The shows in the greater Chicago area - and possibly many other markets - are just a fraction of what they used to be as far as attendance of both guests and lodge owners. Lodge owners we have become friendly with say the shows were too expensive and took up valuable off season time. When a lodge owner has the vast majority of their business from repeat guests - why bother going to a sports show? I remember the decline of the O'Hare Fishing Show in Chicago. I started to see more and more booths at the show that had nothing at all to do with fishing or hunting. Guess the show owners had space to fill so I kind of understand their position. That's when the All Canada Show really took off. I also have to think that the internet also had a major factor in the decline of these shows. You can easily search out a lodge by visiting their web site and perhaps get recommendations from sites like WC.
6271952,prov1800,2018-12-25 14:26:00,5010,To any of the WC members going to the Chicago All Canada Show.come and visit me at the Anishinabi Lake Lodge booth.Ill be maning it for Clarke's resorts.Be nice to meet up with some of you guys in person and talk fishing.
6271998,Da' Walleye Assassun,2018-12-25 19:31:00,358,What sportsman at O'Hare did not want to add to his Beany Baby collection?
6272056,Bstar,2018-12-26 06:13:00,564,Most of our group will be at the Chicago show on January 13.
6272064,btyreprich,2018-12-26 06:23:00,1067,Yes Beanie Babies and the following could be seen at the O'Hare Show: Replacement windows Allstate & State Farm Insurance Velvet paintings - not kidding Kitchen knives and mixers Sad that the show ended up like that. So many great memories for lots of outdoors man
6272082,BornToFish,2018-12-26 07:05:00,1224,"Greetings, The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel sport show has been going the same direction that the O'Hare sport show went - all kinds of things except outdoor sporting. I stopped going to the Journal-Sentinel sport show several years ago. The owners of the All Canada Show have been doing a great job with their show. Time will tell if it is meant to be. As someone pointed out in an earlier comment on this thread, the internet plays a huge role in marketing. I am old-fashioned with respect to the internet. I would much rather talk to a lodge owner and people standing by the booth (customers that stay at the lodge), rather than see pictures on a website of people holding fish. I trust my intuition, as all fishing lodges look great on the internet. As Paul Harvey used to say, ""And now, for the rest of the story..."". Good fishing and tight lines!!"
