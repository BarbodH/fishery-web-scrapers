6282128,fsz,2019-01-23 17:53:00,144,"For example, on Lake Erie a ""six pack"" charter is typically a 26' boat, 6 fisherman and the captain. Eight hours dock to dock. $600 is now typical, which comes in at $100 per person. What is typical and customary on Lac Seul ? I'm thinking 20' boat, 3-4 fisherman? How about pricing (rough estimate)? I tried looking on-line and had trouble even identifying guides/charters (much less pricing) most of my search results came back with resorts and lodges as opposed to charters. I've never been to the area so I don't know whats customary."
6282160,prov1800,2019-01-23 21:59:00,5010,When I use my boat and truck travell to lakes with guests it's 425.00 US for the day.that includes all gas and minnows and tackle if needed.i basically take 2 fisherman plus myself.will go 3 but find it crowded.ive fished with 5 in a 20 ft boat that's way to crowded.if I guide from a camp boat it's 250.00 US.and the camp would provide gas and minnows that your paying for.some guys might go cheaper.but that's about the going rate.
6282192,Skywagon,2019-01-24 04:35:00,1106,"In my opinion, 2 fisherman and the guide is enough in an 18' boat if you are looking for individual attention, there is a little more room in a 20' for the 3rd fisherman, but you lose a lot more of the attention factor. I pity the guide when he has to take more than two.....but I also think two total in a camp boat is enough."
6282214,prov1800,2019-01-24 06:27:00,5010,Totally agree with you skywagon.ive had 5 people in the boat and that's a nut house.like you said it's hard to give the service to that many fisherman.in some cases I had 2 diff parties put in the boat.
6282512,rather-be-fishin,2019-01-24 22:25:00,429,"Over the last 15 years, I have stayed at 4 different resorts on the NW section of Lac Seul, 2 by Ear Falls & 2 South of Ear Falls in Scout Bay Area. I have hired guides from 3 of the resorts. Each time the guide was the owner or manager of the resort or they arranged a private guide for you. They either came in my boat or they used their boat, 18 - 21 foot boat. If in their boat they took up to 4 people. Cost was around $150-165 for a full day 8:00-4:00 for 2 people & $20 per person over 2 people. Also allowed additional follow boats if all from same fishing group for $15 each boat. This included all bait, tackle & gas in guide boat & fish cleaning at end of trip. These are old rates from a few years ago. I have not seen any big ¬ìCharter¬î boat guide services (like you see on Lake of the Woods or the Great Lakes Superior or Erie) on this area of Lac Seul. Hope this answers your questions. RBF"
6282568,prov1800,2019-01-25 07:41:00,5010,"that's what I used to charge in the late 80,s."
6282696,fsz,2019-01-25 18:30:00,144,"Prov 1800 and others, Thanks for your replies on what's customary on Seul! Pricing seems fair to me. I've always had the impression that most fishing there was jigging, so 3 fisherman plus a guide wouldnt seem crowded to me in a 19-21' boat. Also, given the catch numbers associated with Seul, I wouldn't think 3 or even 4 fisherman in a large enough boat would be too much for guide time or √¢¬Ä¬úinstruction√¢¬Ä¬ù if the clients were experienced. The above said, inexperienced clients or trolling (other than to just locate fish to work jigging) I could see wanting to stay at 2 fisherman. Thanks again guys"
6280930,Guest,2019-01-20 17:20:00,0,"Any recommendations for a guide - we will be fishing out of Scout Lake Resort. Looking for someone who will work hard, show us the lake, and let us plot our trails. What do you all think of the fishing in that part of the lake in late July / first part of August?"
6281044,rather-be-fishin,2019-01-20 21:10:00,429,"Try contacting Prov1800 member here on Walleye Central, he does a lot of guiding on that area on Lac Seul. If that doesn't work out the owner of the resort should be able to recommend a guide. We have been fishing that area of Lac Seul for the past 15 years in late July & early August. Fishing has been good. We primarily fish for Walleyes & they will be on the reefs and off island points in McKenzie Bay, Bay of Islands, South Inlet, Manitoba Point, Manitou Narrows & Windigo Point & South in main basin. We find this time of year they are in anywhere from 15 to 27 feet. We use primarily 1/4-3/8 oz jigs or spinners rigs with minnows & crawlers with good results! If wind & weather is a problem in getting out on the main bays, there is also good fishing close by right in Scout Bay! Hiring a guide is a great idea to have them put you on the hot spots & fishing techniques plus show you the safe travel routes since there are a lot of unmarked hazards. It's an awesome lake with fantastic Walleye & Northern Pike fishing! Have a great trip! Six months & the count down is on for our return trip to Lac Seul! RBF ‚ù§Ô∏èüé£üôÇ"
6281578,Carnhzkr,2019-01-22 09:31:00,964,"That time of year is the easiest time to find walleye on LS, in my opinion. You know where they will be - hanging off mid-lake reefs and humps in the areas where RBF mentioned above. The only issue is, most of those areas are a good 30 - 45 minute boat ride from Scout Lake, and there are some rocks along the way (don't ask me how I know). You'll definitely want a sonar with GPS/mapping to get back to Scout Lake. When you're out in the main body of the lake, it might be 50-60 feet deep and as you boat along look for when the bottom starts to rise up and plateau at 20-25 feet. I can almost guarantee you'll see walleye hanging off the edge of those humps. Jigs are great unless the wind prevents it, in which case spinners & bottom bouncers work well too. You can certainly catch fish in Scout Lake and areas closer to camp. In fact, you might catch more since you'll spend more time fishing and less boating, but those summertime reefs where the walleye congregate is what LS is known for."
6281596,stjoeguy,2019-01-22 10:23:00,979,"We also used prov1800 as a guide when we were staying at Onaway, which is in the same general area as Scout. Here's his website:http://johnoutdooradventures.blogspot.com"
6281744,prov1800,2019-01-22 17:59:00,5010,Looking forward to getting in a boat. Mhhh only 3 1/2 months.not to bad.still have some great ice fishing ahead.headed out tomorrow still mild up here then the next deep freeze comes.but everyday spring gets closer.
6281812,Guest,2019-01-22 21:30:00,0,"Thanks all for the replies and info! Lizzy sold Scout Lake Resort last year, and the new owners are not providing guides. I emailed ProV and hopefully will hook up with him at some point. Thanks again for the info!!"
6281864,Aspencreek,2019-01-23 06:23:00,2911,"Who are the new owners? Great idea hiring a guide if you are not familiar with safe travel routes to spots on that part of the lake. Pay attention to how wide they go around islands, don't go between some islands, why they approach spots the way they do. This is all because of the hidden and sometimes not hidden ""prop busting and lower unit removing obstacles down there! Have fun!"
6281880,Guest,2019-01-23 06:58:00,0,"I met the new owners at the All Canada Show. They seem very nice and have responded promptly to my emails. So I expect the transition will be fine. My boy and I spent a week at her place summer before last and really liked it. We did have a guide for a few days and that shortened the learning curve alot! Yep the spots we fished were a bit of hike from the camp, but not as much as I have experienced at Lake of the Woods or Eagle Lake. I guess I have kind of accepted the boat ride aspect of any large Canadian lake I visit. The scenery is beautiful and exploring is alot of fun!"
6281902,prov1800,2019-01-23 07:36:00,5010,Thx guys.hoping for another great year.take care.john
6282108,Thumpr50,2019-01-23 16:18:00,139,"We have stayed at Scout Lake Resort for the past 14 years and looking forward to our 15th!! We are there he last weekend in July through 8/2. Anxious to meet the new owners, Lizzy speaks very highly of them. Good time to be there, Bay of Islands and South Bay seem to produce well. Don't overlook the fishing in Scout either.While I have never had ProV1800 as a guide I am familiar with him, have crossed paths with him several times over the years. He puts fish in the boat and is a genuinely nice person from what I have observed, I think you would be happy with him."
