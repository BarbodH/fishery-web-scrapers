6283770,Fishquest,2019-01-29 04:15:00,89,I've been very lucky with fishing and hunting in the area and its one of my favorite parts of Ontario. Only problem is its so far away that I can't fish it more often.
6283772,Fishquest,2019-01-29 04:17:00,89,Thanks Phil and are you still making the trip up year and how about Rice have you fished it in the last couple years. With the new slot limits on Rice a few years back the walleye population has real grown and fishing improved.
