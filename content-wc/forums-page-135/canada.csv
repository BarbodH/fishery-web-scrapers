Started taking my son when he was eight and my grandson who is four has been up twice already. All have enjoyed their time up there and plan on returning. I can see big get togethers in the future. The technology thing doesn't bother me in the least, because if everyone is entertained, they are happy. In time there won't be a place to get away from it anyway. Can't catch fish on a phone."
6282744,walleyecheek,2019-01-26 05:26:00,2231,Alot of the Millennials catch fish on their phones !!!
6282770,v-bay gord,2019-01-26 08:16:00,3168,"This caught my attention as to the value of a Canadian fishing vacation vs. a tropical all inclusive stay. Just having returned from a two week Caribbean cruise (yes, I know, poor me) I returned back with a better appreciation of what I have here at home. Many of the warm destinations / attractions are ""well worn"" , over populated, and abused. I appreciate the lack of people, pristine qualities and the chance to get back to nature that NW Ontario offers. It's truly unique in the range of tourism opportunities available out there."
6282778,Obabikon,2019-01-26 08:29:00,2370,"Overall travel is much more reliant on the economy than anything else. As someone who was raised in the fishing tourism industry... as a kid, there were very rarely other kids on the island. I mean, we had some... but not many. If anything, I would say that we have more families bringing their kids (8-14) than we did in the 80's and early 90's. I don't have statistics, but just going off of my memory. We were always looking for kids to run around the island and play with. My girls seem to have regular camp ""friends"" come up every summer. The one thing that has gone way down for us is the number of duck hunters, but so has the number of ducks in our area. I am much more concerned with politics (on both sides of the border) making it harder on businesses than I am that people with children not making trips."
6282782,Pooch,2019-01-26 08:36:00,4618,"BINGO^^^ I hope the masses never discover fishing. To bolster the above statement, look what happened to our National parks during the shut down. Pooch"
6282786,kettyspanky,2019-01-26 08:58:00,271,"I have been to Canada fishing 10 times. I love every minute of each trip, even if the fish don't bite. It's nice for me to get away from work for a week and fish, which is relaxing to me. I do a lot of fishing in northern Wisconsin and Canada is the same in a lot of ways. We all go for the fishing and relaxation, otherwise we would stay home. Happy fishing to all."
6282802,prov1800,2019-01-26 09:57:00,5010,I have to agree with gord.Being a fishing guide I get to go all over to a lot of different lakes and I've been noticing a increase of fisherman on all the lakes.A few years ago I noticed it was somewhat quieter out.I see a big increase in sept/Nov.thats mainly due to muskie fisherman targeting late season muskies which has also really picked up the last few years.Not so noticeable on big lakes but on smaller lakes it's much more noticeable.
6213672,ljcs789,2018-06-26 08:59:00,42,"Agree. I worked 3 jobs over the winter so I can afford to take my two boys on their first fly in next week to McLeister Lake with Hearst Air. No electricity, shower, etc. Just outpost fishing. Can't wait. Will be interesting to see what they do with no electronics. They do love to fish, so I think we'll be ok. Oh and they know how to play cribbage from past trips too!"
6213760,kcguy68,2018-06-26 11:51:00,51,Love the smile on that kid's face. That is a day he will never forget.
6213764,kcguy68,2018-06-26 11:56:00,51,"This year I am bringing up my 15 year old step-son, and my buddy is bringing his 14 yr old for their first trips up North. Both boys are very excited to do some fishing North of the border. I also have a 25 year old son, who is missing his 3rd consecutive trip due to family / work priorities. One of these years he will figure out how to make Canada a priority again. As I approach 50, I feel it is important to pass on my love of fishing to a new generation."
6213858,adempsey2.0,2018-06-26 15:29:00,611,"Unfortunately, I don't know if it's a lack of interest or the impact of the change in the economy or both. The younger generation is definitely not spending money in many places that one can consider ""luxury"" items. Golf, diamonds, etc... It's not the teens you need to be concerned about, it's the 30 somethings that have jobs. However, disposable income and vacation time are not what they used to be. From my own experience, it has been difficult to get anyone with a young family to go on a trip with me. They either have no money or not enough time off of work. Having 3 weeks or more of vacation is a luxury for most. Combine that with less disposable income and a family, you know a fishing trip is usually the last thing on their mind. Even my friends where both the husband and wife love fishing, it's just not as high a priority as visiting family etc.I do think cost is a huge factor. Now, I am not saying that the rates being charged are unfair. Not at all. However, I can fly down Mexico or Cuba and stay at a really nice all inclusive resort for $1500 CDN per person easily, probably even $1000 CDN including the flight. Do I like sipping Pina Coladas on the beach? Sure do! Would I rather be fishing? Most definitely. However, I can luckily do both. Many cannot. The current rates just make it even more difficult to justify spending a similar amount on a fishing trip with few amenities compared to what many would consider an ""exotic"" vacation. This is especially true when you have limited vacation time and want to please everyone in the family."
6214338,DPKing814,2018-06-27 17:24:00,38,"I am 30.. thought I would throw that in with the generational talk.. Next year will be my first year going up to Canada to fish. Was hoping it would be this year but things did not work out getting the boat we wanted in time to make plans with everyone else and head up. I can honestly say though that our group.. potentially 10 of us (all first timers for Canada fishing) have never even considered going to a resort or anything like that. Our plan is to hook up and drive almost 40 hours to the lake we are planning to fish. We are bringing everything we need and just camping and ""roughing"" it for the trip. It is not because of money or anything else, every other trip we have done together other than a Texas Hog hunt has been of the DIY style. We prefer things that way. I can say from my experience a lot of people my age are more willing to attempt something themselves instead of paying someone else to do it. We like the challenge.. it will be a huge learning curve with a lot of time and money spent doing it that way but that's what we want. So as far as the OP.. I can say ""we"" just don't have the need to go to a resort."
6214354,BreezyPoint,2018-06-27 19:23:00,1581,"You need to make sure you are camping somewhere where it is allowed and that you have the appropriate camping permits. I don't want to rain on your parade, but you just can't camp wherever you feel like. There are also rules at all of the allowable places, such as the West English River park where you need to be a certain distance from the shoreline.That being said, there are places to camp. Just do your homework and have a great time.Frank"
6214394,DPKing814,2018-06-27 21:15:00,38,"Thank you for the info. We have researched this for a while and have a good handle on what the expectations are at this lake. We have done a lot of DIY trips, more on the hunting side, but the planning is almost just as fun as the whole trip..."
6214424,Obabikon,2018-06-28 05:07:00,2370,"I have to say that this is an up and down battle. Right now, we have 14 kids under the age of 16 on the island... they are not all together. They're part of 5 different groups. Things have changed, but I would say we have as many youths as we did when I was a kid. I can't speak for every place, but if you tried to call to book a trip around Morson in the next two or three weeks... you would have a VERY hard time finding an open cabin."
6214432,farmnfish,2018-06-28 05:48:00,130,A bit different for me than many. My wife and kids love to go fishing in Ontario. Most of the guys I used to go on flyins with now prefer laying on Fl. beaches. They honestly think I'm depriving my children by not taking them on beach vacations.
6214452,Guest,2018-06-28 06:26:00,0,"A few years ago we were waiting on the plane to pick us up. We had hauled the boats out of the lake, removed and topped all gas tanks and stored all gear in the boat house. When the plane arrived a guy and his wife (in their 60's) got off the plane. Next came this guy's parents. They were very old, very feeble and we not only helped them off the plane but carried all of their gear to the cabin. Next we pulled 2 boats off the racks, installed the seats and gas tanks. We checked the LP tanks at the cabin and hauled a spare up from the boat house. We split some wood for them. I often wondered about this family's week in camp and how it went for them. We are a group of 6 guys and while we are not getting any younger we can still complete all of the required chores of a single cabin fly-in. I hope when I am old and feeble someone will haul me to Canada and take care of all of the hard work involved with these trips."
6213106,Bill Krejca,2018-06-25 06:54:00,6107,"I think it depends on where the not-filled resorts are. Generally, those closer to access points seem to suffer more from a guest decline than many of the more remote ones. In most cases, easy access to the water means more folks have fished the area and the number of the fish population in these areas reflects this, hence folks stop going or don't go as much to these places. Also, seemingly indiscriminate netting can be a destructive action which can decimate a former very good fishing area. Also fishing buddies die off over time, and it seems the back-fill from youngsters may not be keeping up as much as maybe it used to, various related reasons, mostly already noted. Bill"
6213114,skindzier,2018-06-25 07:06:00,137,"That's pretty cool, Gord. Well done! (Well done, Joe too!)"
6213140,rockape,2018-06-25 07:49:00,215,"I agree that it seems that kids of today can't handle being away from their **** phones and apps on them. I like that I can check the weather now, but that is all I do on my phone the whole week. We have 2 young guys in our group. Sons of two of my fishing partners. 18 and 19 years old. They love to fish, but still are on their phones way too much. Being outside in nature, and breathing the fresh air is so awesome. Catching fish is a bonus. My week in Canada every year recharges me for the next 51 weeks. Going fishing in Canada is less expensive than a week in Florida or some other warm vacation spot. I believe society as a whole likes to stay clean, have 300 channels on TV, and have all of their meals served to them. Lazy and comfy. Not me. But if everyone wanted to go fish a week in Canada, it would be really crowded and much more expensive. Fine by me the way it is!"
6213178,bowtech840,2018-06-25 08:53:00,111,"Ppl complaining about technology and social media on a social media platform? Odd. I don't know how someone can blame kids for having better technology and using it. The fact that you ""middle aged men"" are using the Internet to communicate right now tells me that if you were born in the same generation most of you would've been glued to your iPhones and iPad.

6213288,Habitual Eyer,2018-06-25 11:56:00,144,"My three favorite drives too's (two on Gullrock, one on central Lac Suel) were all booked solid for last week and this week. Struggled for a last minute option last week. One is almost 100% booked for the season...other two not far behind. Cant find what I need in mid-August and I started early. I agree there is no place like Canada...probably goes in swings or ups and downs regarding popularity. But...most camps I look to are experiencing an incredible up time right now and probably main reason price to buy a camp now is so high. Not seeing the decline in bookings as spoke of here..but after 30 yrs of travelling Ontario looking for the perfect combo of all things I value in Canada...the camps I frequent really have a lot going for them..well run, awesome waters and don't see the swings in activity like some lessor camps might."
6213352,emma17,2018-06-25 13:49:00,436,"My sons and I started going up 8 years ago (they were 12 and 13 then). I can't comment on whether bookings have declined or if fewer young people are going. On our 12-15 hour drive up the first hour is non stop, excited discussion about how we plan to catch the big ones. Then off they go into electronics and off I go into my version of technology - audio books. We will have 3 or 4 of those eager anticipation discussions separated by longer periods of technology. Once we arrive, they don't miss the technology one bit. I'd like to believe this scenario holds true for most families. If there is a decline in youth fishing, I'm sure there are many reasons. I do think, as with all good habits, it has to start at home when kids are young. Youth sports is where I'd look to first. School ends for the summer and it's on to one sport after another. Baseball - football/soccer in our area. If we can't plant that seed when they are young, it will be hard to convince them the drive and time on the water somehow equates to an incredible vacation."
6213354,Willyboy123,2018-06-25 13:50:00,73,"My grandson is a video game fanatic. But he went this year for the first time and had a blast. No video games, not online nothing! Just sleeping a bit and fishing all day. It didn't hurt that we got tons of fish every day. He's like to go back next year. He doesn't like to go with me to home lakes. The fishing is too slow for him My point is, I think once the kids see how awesome it can be, I think they'll want to go...and go back again."
6213400,MrSimon,2018-06-25 15:18:00,922,"I don't buy into the ""people can't afford it"" excuse. If they can afford $150 per month for TV and internet, along with $400 a month for a nice truck, plus $100 a month for beer, $200 a month for dinners out .... the list goes on and on and on. People CAN afford it, they just choose to spend their money on other things. Which is fine. To each their own. As a society, people are less and less interested in hunting and fishing. HOWEVER, there seems to be a higher intensity with the fewer people who still do it. It used to be that everyone hunted and fished to some extent. Now fewer do, but they have more passion for it. Maybe that's a good thing."
6213442,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2018-06-25 17:04:00,240,"Hi--I am not complaining about technology and social media in general. I probably wouldn't be employed if I wasn't able to use technology, web pages, online communication, etc., to do my job. However, I don't like to feel tethered to technology when I leave work for the day, and especially when I go to Canada. There are satellite phones at just about every outpost for real emergencies. I hate golf, and I sure as heck didn't appreciate listening to the US Open on my last fly-in. I go on these trips in part to totally get away from this stuff. But maybe that' just me."
6213622,farmnfish,2018-06-26 06:55:00,130,"My kids are fairly well addicted to technology, but still don't have too much trouble leaving it behind when we go to canada. Just getting out camping and fishing is more fun for them than the social media. BUT if they could have both they would be thrilled.Used to do flyins every year when I was a single guy, can't afford that now that I'd have to take the whole family. My emphasis is how to do it cheaper so I can do it more."

Just a reason in my opinion if camps aren't as full as they used to be. The fact is he went for twenty+ years without being stopped and then was. Same guy as he hasn't changed. Later, Jay"
6212774,Mojo-NC,2018-06-24 13:11:00,1929,"Jay, you sound as if you consider having a DUI on your record as being a variation of normal. I can assure you it's not. That's 100% of your friends according to your post. I'm not trying to come off as being sanctimonious but geez, maybe you should consider hanging out with some different people. Canada has every right to deny anyone entry into their country, especially if the alcohol/drug related charge was recent."
6212782,terrapin,2018-06-24 13:28:00,353,"Guess what, lots of fisherman drink... some of them get safe driving awards because of it. Keep them out and you have safer roads and cut out a demographic that fishes and spends. It's a business decision, no judgment passed.A bigger, more foreboding question is how many 12-18 kids do you see up there. I think that is the number that has crashed. Dads and kids (moms optional). I honestly think kids are so entertained by a glowing screen in a darkened room, that prying them away is **** near impossible. When I grew up my entertainment was hunting, fishing, working and then 3 channels of TV (in diminishing order). Now they are doing the mental equivalent of meth via electronic devices.Full disclosure, I couldn't convince my teenage kids to go camping/ fishing this week and I'm still pissed."
6212794,v-bay gord,2018-06-24 14:01:00,3168,How many kids? This week I have three dads with three 16 year old sons......three other groups with one 12 -14 year old each. Only one mom. So while I agree that the old fishermen are dying out there is some recruitment.
6212832,JAY221,2018-06-24 15:38:00,877,"Nope, I don't consider it normal at all. I spoke off 5 people I know that can not get into Canada. Not all my friends by a long shot. I personally have been there almost every year since 91 with different friends and family and will be there again mid July. I don't have a problem with this law at all as it is their country and they can do what they want to with it. Later, Jay"
6212882,hugepike0,2018-06-24 17:03:00,28,"I agree with the poster about not seeing many kids up there. I have been fortunate enough to bring each of my 5 children at least once on a fly in pike trip. while they all liked it, I know they hated being away from their tech. Us old folk that loved getting away from everything are a dying breed."
6212896,Ogoki,2018-06-24 17:29:00,291,"I see many guys over 50 on the docks when flying in. very few younger people. Don't know how the bookings are. But last year called to do a second fly in the first week of August and got my ninth choice. I flew in twice a year ,when in my 30's. My buddy's quit because of the cost. Two older buddy's have died. Now it's just my wife and I . Everyone from my church have died of just too old to go. I have mentioned to several younger guys , in their 40's, but kids in school and some with kids about to enter college , just can't afford going. Back in the early 1990's most guys could take a weeks pay and do a fly in. Not anymore. Mortgages ,car payment etc, just make it too costly , for the people I am around."

6212722,v-bay gord,2018-06-24 10:56:00,3168,Not sure about your assumption......seems very busy from my perspective. Most resorts have had very positive seasons the past three years.
6212728,valley366,2018-06-24 11:20:00,193,I think they have recovered pretty good. Strictly using the border crossing lines that I saw when we went up there. 10-15 years ago 1 hour lines was the norm at Fort Frances. Then there was a down swing and at times minimal lines. This past trip on both Friday and Saturday the line going north was in excess of an hour wait.Limited sample size but we always go the second week in June. I know this is probably one of the more popular weeks but in research new places there were a lot that said they were full up during that week. This next year we are going back to the same place and have someone that wants to go with us. This requires a bigger cabin and I have to get that arranged in the next couple weeks as I know it may not be possible.
6212736,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2018-06-24 11:35:00,240,"My take--resorts and fly-in outpost outfitters are evolving to meet the needs/demands of a slowly changing client base. The customers who have the most buying power are those of the older generation (of which I am getting closer and closer to joining). Flush toilets, C-Pap adaptations, hot and cold running water, etc., are becoming standards fly-in outpost outfitters are implementing to attract customers. At sports shows, customers routinely inquire about flush toilets before they ask about the fishing. Crazy. It gets harder and harder to attract the younger set, for a variety of reasons, including buying power, time constraints due to evolving employment requirements (working weekends, odd shifts, etc.), and an aversion to being away from social media. On my last fly-in trip, the guys I were with were listening to the US Open, texting their families (and the outfitter to fly in more beer), checking the weather forecast, etc., with a Sirius Radio adapter, I-Pads, etc. This about drove me nuts. I have a master's degree in business and work on computers constantly, but I absolutely hate the crap those other guys brought. I do admit a little music is nice during the week, but a big part of going on these trips for me is to get away, and I mean absolutely, from social media and its technology. The traditional week-away-from-home-and-the-office is changing. Sadly, some are addicted to technology and can't stand to be away from it. Well-run resorts and outfitters will always have a good client base. But the fixed and variable costs in running this type of business will grow, and that may force more marginal resorts and outfitters out."
6212738,GWC,2018-06-24 11:40:00,1021,"We go to fish, no computers, note books, etc. Yes, we're both computer nerds but we go to fish & to enjoy the company at the camp. We might make a quick phone call but that's about it."
6212750,JAY221,2018-06-24 12:01:00,877,"When I first started going in 1991 I went with 4 other guys. NONE of them can get into Canada because of the drunk & driving enforcement. I know some others that have quit going for this reason also. One went every year until a few years ago he arrived at the border with his group and they went on without him as Canada said No he wasn't getting in until he got everything cleaned up. He hasn't been back. Later, Jay"
6212760,Clairebear,2018-06-24 12:46:00,937,"When you say he hasn't been back,is that because he didn't want to change? Apparently our laws are working. I believe it's the same for Canadians crossing into the USA."
6212762,valley366,2018-06-24 12:46:00,193,For the technology part of the trip it has its place and just like every day at home if you are reasonable about when people are on it there can be balance. Problem with most is they cannot balance.I like the unplugged aspect of the trip. If I have access to wifi it is a quick check of email and the weather forecast then it goes away. In the evening will do about the same. Do post some stuff to Facebook to plug the resort and to keep momma happy with the kids. The people that can't balance are the same back home. We all know them. The ones that sit down at the computer when work needs to get done and those that have their face in it when social hour is going on.WIFI and internet are almost a requirement for some that book. There will be those that choose a resort that does not have any connectivity and those that choose resorts just because they do.
6212766,GWC,2018-06-24 12:54:00,1021,"We started going to Canada in 2008. Didn't go last year because my wife had surgery to replace both knees. Not going this year because she may be having surgery to repair a rotator tear. Maybe next year, I miss those trips."
