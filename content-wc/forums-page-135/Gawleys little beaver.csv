We have lost all our records, contact information as well as our business phone line (807-222-3333). We have the same cell # (for those that have it). Please text, email or message us your name and phone # so we can update our records. The Ear Falls Fire Department were excellent and saved our cabins so we will be operating for the 2019 fishing season. Just in case any of you guys are booked there."

6282968,Jeler,2019-01-27 06:26:00,92,So sorry for your loss! Hopefully you'll have a quick recovery and a bright future this coming season!
6283148,maddogg,2019-01-27 13:43:00,178,I looked at the website and can not find anything about camp boats or fishing packages.
6283334,btyreprich,2019-01-28 06:43:00,1067,"If you visit the web site and click on RATES, you will see the cost for a stay there. That same page has a sentence about ""bring your own boat"". Perhaps these folks could arrange the rental from a nearby camp if you don't own your own boat."
6283988,stumcfar,2019-01-29 12:36:00,451,"Great camp! Sorry for their loss of a home. I hope all goes well as they rebuild. They have nice cabins, great docks and are a perfect camp if you like to fish from your own boat!"
