The chain is fun to fish just for the diversity in lake types. My favorite, although the least productive, was Cobble. Just a really gorgeous lake. And very nice whitefish. Take care."
6282316,prov1800,2019-01-24 11:22:00,5010,Yup.thats power.nice to have lights.that shack on left doesn't have windows .and doesn't take much to heat it either.chain is a nice series of lakes.

6282804,prov1800,2019-01-26 10:02:00,5010,Haha.Its more than a extension cord Bill.It gets wired to code.One shack is for minnows so it's gets heated with a light bulb to keep water from freezing with a insulated top.top notch place and fishing is great pretty much all times of the day.you would like it.lol.
