I have seen other dogs there but not sure if they belong to guests or the staff. I would say fishing can spotty there but good when you find a hole. There is a lot of water to explore. Paul and Deb are great people and run a great operation. If you stay at the outpost, you are much closer to the best fishing. If you stay in the main camp, you can count on a half hour or more boat ride to get to the fish, depending on the time of year. There is another camp nearby and one on Big Woman Lake in addition to a public boat ramp, so there can be quite a bit of traffic, again depending upon the time of the year. I like the opportunity to use portage lakes at no extra charge and he has access to several great fishing lakes. I also find WRC very affordable and it might be a good place for your first NW Ontario experience. Whatever you decide, you will have a great time! FISH ON! Hooks"

The fishing was fantastic, along with the experience of fishing with Connie. Everyone at the camp from the owners to the other fisherman made it a memorable time. The boats we used were wide deep 16 footers which worked well when the lake got SPORTY. Unfortunately a trip this year will not happen as we bought a new boat and had home improvement projects done. Thank You... Connie,Phil,Kyle,Jim and Brett"

Ignace area is definitely the place for walleye per acre especially using a small boat. Iâ€™m not an outfitter but I could set you up with a few amazing lakes as long as your not worried about bush rash on your pickup."

6276414,dlp8940,2019-01-07 11:10:00,6,"Hi everyone. First post after reading lots. I am trying to plan my 1st NW Ontario trip. We always fish Eastern Ontario and want some real Walleye fishing. I narrowed it down to 4 choices- Gullrock, Cedar, Woman River or Indian Chain. My boat is small (14ft), so I'd like to avoid big open water that gets windy. We are looking for numbers not size. Smallies would be a bonus. Thanks!"

6276536,johnboat,2019-01-07 20:33:00,2014,"Five Lakes Lodge on Gullrock. I've had 17 trips there and plan to keep the streak going. Numbers, along with size will be no problem. Leave your boat at home. His camp boats are so nice you won't need yours and they are included in the very affordable price of the stay. I've sent a hand full of groups there over the years and each one was very pleased and is a return customer. Feel free to PM me. Heck, I'll even send you a copy of my map with spots marked."
6276538,prov1800,2019-01-07 20:57:00,5010,"I'll go along with narda.clarkes on cedar lake has numbers and size.plus bonus bass and crappies.17 mi long lake with many islands and bays to fish in case of rougher weather.they run northern lights resort on cedar and they also have a camp on the Indian lake (kc,s landing).also good walleye and bass fishing.clarkes provide 18 ft Crestliner kodiak boats in there pkg plus free minnows.definitely worth a look.

6276618,dlp8940,2019-01-08 07:24:00,6,Thanks a lot for the information. This is a good start for me. I'll have to find pet-friendly- wife won't travel without her doggy. Gotta keep her happy.
6276662,Jeler,2019-01-08 08:45:00,92,"dlp8940,Taking your pet along, which I understand totally becomes your priority over the fishing. But hopefully you can find a resort/cabin that will offer both. I'm sure they are out there. I notice Clark's doesn't allow pets so maybe do a search here or on the net for those pet-friendly resorts.Good luckWe've always wanted to take our dog along on our trips, but he hates riding in vehicles."
6276672,dlp8940,2019-01-08 09:08:00,6,"Jeler,I did find a one on Gullrock (Gullrock Lake Lodge) and one on Cedar (Keystone). Maybe one of those will work."
6276680,Jeler,2019-01-08 09:20:00,92,"Awesome! Sounds fantastic! My wife and I prefer fly-ins so taking a dog out into the bush just isn't an option for us.Good luck, there's no doubt lots of information and feedback on both places you have mentioned.Jeff in Iowa"
6276710,Golden Eagle,2019-01-08 11:01:00,2642,Will OP 14' boat be sufficient for Gullrock?
6276716,dlp8940,2019-01-08 11:09:00,6,"Golden Eagle,That's my concern- I want to use my own boat, but big wind in open water may be a problem. The lake I normally fish in SE Ontario is long, but narrow and protected in most places."
