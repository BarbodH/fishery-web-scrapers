6284166,Limeyangler,2019-01-29 21:06:00,563,Jeebus! Tell me about it bruvva! Its brutal.....this was me 2 days ago waiting for a bite. But I have a plan! Every year we escape to Antigua in the Caribbean. Of course I take a rod or 2 and enough tackle to open a shop. I go out early every morning for 2 weeks exploring the rocky shores and mangrove bays armed with a 7' heavy action St. Croix and assorted hard/softbaits. In just over a week i'll be doing this again!!!!!VIDEOS FROM PREVIOUS ANTIGUA TRIPShttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?lis...HwF2KR6oaj3Yan
