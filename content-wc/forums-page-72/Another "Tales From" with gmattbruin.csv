6576334,HeHooksHimself,2021-07-07 05:55:00,725,"Andrew, thanks again for feeding that inner fire most of us from south of the border have burning in our souls regarding Canadian fishing adventures! And, thanks to Glenn for sharing his experiences with us. Could it possibly be that we could be in Canada in August? I sure hope so! Keep the ""Tales"" coming! Fish On! Hooks"
6576384,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2021-07-07 07:56:00,240,"Thanks for this!! You do great work and I always enjoy seeing a new thread of yours. I'm on my way up the north shore today, heading up the Gunflint trail, and it is going to kill me fishing those border waters, where I can look across the lake and see Canada. But it's always a good trip, anyway. Thanks again--nice work!!"
6576386,pnnylfr,2021-07-07 07:56:00,114,Thank you Andrew and Glenn. Keep it up.
6576420,gordy28,2021-07-07 10:01:00,437,Thanks all! Glad you enjoyed - other than trip reports (cause a trip was taken) these have become my favorite posts to create As mentioned = open to new volunteers! Cheers Andrew

6578228,gmattbruin,2021-07-13 09:59:00,174,"Hey Andrew, my apologies for the delay on this. Selling my home, buying a new property has consumed all my waking and sleeping moments. But i wanna say thank you for the chats and emails back and forth. Its fun to share our experiences on these fly-ins. Picking up new ways to do things, making trips more efficient, fishing tactics, etc. Learning about different outfitters, lakes,etc. Cheers"
6578494,gordy28,2021-07-14 07:27:00,437,"Hey Glen No worries - sounds like a busy time for you - totally get it Again - many thanks - really enjoyed chatting with you, learning about your group, TLO and Abamasagi! All the best with the move and the rest of the fishing season Andrew"
6578518,Fishquest,2021-07-14 08:21:00,89,"Thanks for another good one and I'll have to have a chat with Glenn someday as it seems we have a lot in common with the love for the Nakina area, the outfitter and our work. With my late season trip last year to Aba it would have been great to talk to him before that one."
