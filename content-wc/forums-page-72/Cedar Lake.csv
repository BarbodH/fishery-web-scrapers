6577374,prov1800,2021-07-10 18:55:00,5010,Totally agree.I dont understand why Canada is keeping the border closed. They said if we had the required % of first and second vaccinations it would open.We have exceeded that and now they raise the bar.All winter tgey were letting people in from all over the world except the USA.Cant find any answers except a election is coming up and Trudeau knows most of Canadians want border to stay shut so that's what's probably going on.He wants the votes.Anybody who would vote for him again got to have rocks for brains.

6576962,port1042,2021-07-09 07:18:00,509,It's really nice to see your pictures. I wish I was seeing those lakes in person. Do you ever fish Perrault? How are the water levels on Cedar and Perrault? We're still hoping to check things out in early Sept. The whole group is vaccinated and ready to go. Unlike last fall and this spring we are actually checking our gear and working on menus.
6576976,prov1800,2021-07-09 07:37:00,5010,I go to perreault couple of times a year but mainly stay on Cedar.Water levels still down 1 1/2 ft or so.Havnt been to Perreault yet so don't know how depth is by burned out bridge.Border should be open allready.No covid here but the problem spots in Canada keeping border closed iam hoping for a fall opening.

6577360,prov1800,2021-07-10 18:36:00,5010,Another muskie morning.Only saw 7 fish this morning and no bites from them.Moved on to walleye and first spot we fished had a unreal bite.Fished a hour or so and had walleyes on about every cast.Shallow today in the 76 F water temp.8-10 ft off a weed bed in the rocks.Smallies were there to picking of crayfish in the rocks which seem to be molting.usually every year when that happens its fantastic fishing.Cleaned our fish and full of crayfish and my lifewell tank to when i got home was full of them to.went to beach again and cooled off before loading boat.Hot up here in 30-35c.
6577364,prov1800,2021-07-10 18:46:00,5010,Anotger calm day to boot.
