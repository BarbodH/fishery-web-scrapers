6579798,Eckohlt,2021-07-18 06:14:00,3685,"Chow in a day or two we will get the full details what's going to go down,for me I'm saying it's going to happen for the good."
6579844,Obabikon,2021-07-18 07:36:00,2370,"I am just sharing information, and my opinion with what MIGHT happen. Returning to the US: I don't imagine there will be ANY requirements for a US citizen returning from Canada. The US is not going to start making things harder. Each time I have come back from Canada during this... I simply hand over my passport, tell them ""no fish or alcohol"" and drive on through. I seriously doubt they are going to make things harder. Going into Canada. They certainly will ask for proof of vaccination. They also might require a negative PCR (not a rapid) test within the past 48-72 hours. They MIGHT (but I do not believe they will because of costs) ask you take a test at the border. They have done away with quarantines, and as long as people prove vaccination, that probably won't be changing. All this said, these are just guesses. For all I know, Trudeau might say that only French people can cross. Many of the things that have gone on do not make sense to me. From a stats guy... I think here are the odds... 50% - Proof of vaccination, and come on in 40% - Proof of vaccination, negative PCR test 48-72 hours prior to travel 10% - Proof of vaccination, negative PCR test 48-72 hours prior to travel, and test done when crossing Trudeau likes to surprise people, so it is probably going to be the last one! LOL"
6579848,Obabikon,2021-07-18 07:38:00,2370,"Technically... we will get ""more information early next week"". They don't like giving all the details for anything. I would imagine that we don't get a date, but get a general picture of how it MIGHT look. Trudeau has used that type of language for months... but never given concrete guidelines."
6579584,Eckohlt,2021-07-17 11:44:00,3685,"There's no problem,and I'm not arguing,you were so negative about it opening this year,but I'm happy just like you now that some resorts will have a short but not lost season,I'm not leaving until sept 10 so I think others will pave the way first,rod"
6579592,That Minnesota guy,2021-07-17 12:12:00,8293,"Not negative, I was being realistic, There was little to zero chance of June & July. I didn't think they would make it in August or Sept either. And while they haven't yet announced it will open for sure it does look better. I've always been in the resort owners corner."
6579594,Eckohlt,2021-07-17 12:17:00,3685,Well let's hope he gives an exact date when the borders will get swamped.
6579718,drlee,2021-07-17 17:42:00,409,"My camp owner let me know that he will have some vacancies in ""late August"" and in September. He has faithfully kept me posted with 100% accuracy through this entire mess. He would be the first to tell you that last minute changes are not impossible. But, bottom line, he is taking reservations. If I can find the right dates, I will be there. Note: I have stayed with him for 15 years, two weeks per year."
6579728,Eckohlt,2021-07-17 18:42:00,3685,I booked with him a few days ago.
6579738,kettyspanky,2021-07-17 19:20:00,271,"I talked with my resort owner today and he was optimistic before now but with everything else coming on, he is not optimistic anymore. He will be open a couple weeks after labor day but really doesn't think it will open. If it does I can call and get a cabin anytime but he said it doesn't look good. I hope he is wrong. I guess time will tell."
6579744,Eckohlt,2021-07-17 19:37:00,3685,"It's actually looking really good from what the king said the other day,I'm not sure where people are getting this,,,,,it doesn't look good."
6579746,Hookhunter75,2021-07-17 19:38:00,60,Because walleyechowder wants to be negative till the bitter end
6579748,Eckohlt,2021-07-17 19:52:00,3685,"Come'on chowder I'm only 30 minutes from ya,you need a face to face pep talk,it's about time we wet a line in NWO we are way overdue!!"
6579790,Wallychowder,2021-07-18 05:53:00,1567,"Hey Hook , I'm not the only one on here thats saying it dont look good ! (Forest fires, variants, no plans in place how they are even going to do it ? etc.ect.ect.)"
6579446,UKBDM,2021-07-16 14:11:00,178,Wabaskang is so low right now I don't think my camp will open even if the border does!
6579448,Obabikon,2021-07-16 14:14:00,2370,"It makes me sad that some resorts will not be opening for a short season. However... there will be many resorts that do, if it actually opens by mid August. Obabikon usually closes by the end of September, but we will be staying open well into October this year."
6579458,Mandrews,2021-07-16 15:18:00,2,"I just got back from my cabin northwest of Rainy, I'm a dual citizen and was allowed entry for my first trip since February 2020. My understanding is the border is not opening , Canada is allowing entry to people that meet there entry requirements of which is Vaccinated, 72 hr negative test, ArriveCan application and self administered test you do virtually with in 24hrs of entry and mailed. It was not a easy process but I did it and had great trip and would say it was worth it. Good luck"
6579462,Wallychowder,2021-07-16 15:41:00,1567,When are you going back ?
6579470,Mandrews,2021-07-16 15:52:00,2,"First week in August So another hurdle I jumped through was, I'm a pilot and have float plane and couldn't fly to my cabin as the only airports open don't have water access. So I drove through FF to Off lake and hired a local operator to fly me in. Lots of heads turned when they saw MN lic plates. Local operator was happy to see me and get a little business."
6579490,Yellowfin123,2021-07-16 17:31:00,2182,"solo what?? i'll meet ya at deception landing, i'll cover the cost and you be the guide although i'm not sure my boat would make it there"
6579546,Obabikon,2021-07-17 08:30:00,2370,"I have done the self administered test several times, and I would gladly walk guests through it to help facilitate our opening. It takes about 10 minutes and a smart phone. If they even require that (I think it's 50/50)Negative test showing up, and proof of vaccination.... that's probably what they will require. We will happily take that to be able to earn even a LITTLE bit of money this year."
6579564,That Minnesota guy,2021-07-17 10:13:00,8293,My prayers are with you Jared. It would be a kick to the jewels if they back off now.
6579578,Eckohlt,2021-07-17 11:13:00,3685,You swore up and down no way we should even think of fishing in Ontario this year!!!!
6579580,That Minnesota guy,2021-07-17 11:19:00,8293,"See, thats the problem. You can't comprehend what you read. You like to read what you want to see not whats there. I wrote I was praying for Jared that Canada opens. Not one time have I said I was going to Canada. In fact you can check with PJ i've turned down a trip with him for this fall. Instead of arguing you should be packing. You need to be the first guy across when they open."
6579336,Jesse-WI,2021-07-16 09:12:00,534,"https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/readouts/20...id-19-response government version of the call, more details next week. could assuming....... but certainly most positive news in a long time"
6579348,Baseline,2021-07-16 09:51:00,3207,The Billions $$$$ of losses are piling up day after day. The Ontario resorts are just a small part of the total losses to the Canadian economy. The same pressures that opened the US is affecting Canada. Check out the website Flight Aware and look at all the aircraft flowing into the Us from Europe and Asia.
6579352,Wallychowder,2021-07-16 09:56:00,1567,Wont most kids be back to school by then ?
6579398,Eckohlt,2021-07-16 12:10:00,3685,"Fishing came first with me school was in a far distance,take off school and head north"
6579406,pjshorthorn,2021-07-16 12:20:00,5654,Been trying to get to VBL since May of 2020.... I’ve lost track on how many different dates have fallen through. I’ve also done solo trips on Lac Seul through LSO.PjShorthorn
6579408,Obabikon,2021-07-16 12:21:00,2370,"From what I have heard, once the border opens, children will not be required to be vaccinated. The question I have is... under 12 or under 18? All that said, this is the FIRST TIME that PM Trudeau has given a general time frame for opening the border. By saying ""mid August"" he is committing to a specific time frame. He is protecting himself a little by saying as long as things continue downward. This isn't how he extended border closures before... this is a very positive comment."
6579410,Hookhunter75,2021-07-16 12:24:00,60,Agreed anything can happen obviously but he has shown that he has not problem being tight lipped about plans. That readout was posted for a reason last night.
6579430,fishingMN4eyes,2021-07-16 13:08:00,108,Our trip was planned for the last full week in August. With the most recent news the resort just notified me that they will not be opening for that short of a season.....
6579434,Wallychowder,2021-07-16 13:17:00,1567,"Yeah, who's to say its even going to open in August ? I dont blame them !"
6579438,fishingMN4eyes,2021-07-16 13:35:00,108,Exactly. I think they were holding out extremely thin hope for July. Once that went out they just called it altogether.
6579222,Wallychowder,2021-07-16 05:36:00,1567,"Well ""usually"" they make a statement by the 21st of the month ? Why don't he just come out now and say it then ? It's close enough to the 21st !!!!"
6579224,Eckohlt,2021-07-16 05:37:00,3685,"I'm awake now,after reading that I thought it was Christmas morning,you gotta stay positive through out the ordeal and good things can happen.The fish on the other hand if they could read will become there worst nightmare,saddle up boys be ready to ride."
6579230,pjshorthorn,2021-07-16 05:57:00,5654,"Not trying to be a Debbie Downer here, but all I personally got out of this latest announcement is that the border is closed for another month. Although it was not officially announced as such, this was nothing more than another 30 day extension of the closure just like every other month. Having said that, I will be cautiously optimistic that everyone gets off of dead center and provides some communication with substance that says......here is the plan and this is what is required to be admitted to Canada or the US. Nonetheless, I'll probably start looking through my gear and organize a bit ( I need to anyways) in the event a final decision is made. Otherwise, I'll make plans to ice fish this winter stateside. In the meantime, I have a full plate of other things to keep me busy. They just aren't fishy things like I would prefer. PjShorthorn"
6579238,Baseline,2021-07-16 06:13:00,3207,The owners live full-time at one of the resorts I use near Ignace. They reserved a cabin for me and did not want a deposit . The owner said his doors open with the border. He told me to bring 10 of my friends LOL.
6579246,pjshorthorn,2021-07-16 06:22:00,5654,"I have had the same exact conversation since March of 2020 with another outfitter who lives at their lodge full time. No deposit needed ,with a cabin on the books as a placeholder, when the powers to be decide they aren’t ate up with the dumba$$ any longer.The only caveat to my situation since 2020 is that I’ve been wanting to do a solo trip again for quite some time and so far.....I’m 0 for 2...., but the outfitter has always been willing to squeeze me into the reservation schedule. I couldn’t ask for any better consideration than what I have received throughout this whole hot mess everyone has been going through.PjShorthorn"

6579162,Baseline,2021-07-15 20:56:00,3207,TORONTO (AP) -- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Canada could start allowing fully vaccinated Americans into Canada as of mid-August for non-essential travel and should be in a position to welcome fully vaccinated travelers from all countries by early September.Trudeau spoke with leaders of Canada's provinces on Thursday and his office released a readout of the call.He noted that if Canada's current positive path of vaccination rate and public health conditions continue the border can open.The border has been closed to non essential travel since the early months of the pandemic.I'm packing my gear
