6579250,pjshorthorn,2021-07-16 06:27:00,5654,"What ? You don’t think that there aren’t a whole lot more folks who feel like they have been “personally” wronged and will never go to Canada again ? I think it is quite a large number and more than we think.Regardless, I couldn’t give one rip if folks decide to never step foot into Canada again....not my problem.PjShorthorn"
6579258,Eckohlt,2021-07-16 06:43:00,3685,"Ditto,I'm with you on that post."
6579260,Wallychowder,2021-07-16 06:43:00,1567,I agree ! I just don't want to be waiting in line clear back in Owatonna ?
6579274,nitroman,2021-07-16 07:06:00,368,getting the band back together now and we're hittin the road with vaccination cards in hand as soon as it opens. May go 2 day's early to get in line!
6579282,That Minnesota guy,2021-07-16 07:26:00,8293,The upside if true is most of the Hwy 53 construction in the Falls should be about done. They did the landscaping and installed the windows in the new gas station this week. Looks like Dunkin Donuts will open very soon. They poured the floor on one of the new motels this week bit it won't be ready until next year. The other motel they just started the dirt work on so that is a long ways away yet.
6579364,stanlh,2021-07-16 10:27:00,11,"My son works near the Canadian border, based on what he hears he says along with proof of vaccination they may require you to take a covid test before granting entry. But it's all still just a guess at this point."
6579394,MikeAnkeny,2021-07-16 12:02:00,67,I'm only 40 minutes away by speed of sound (at ST&P of course) and I have not heard anything.
6579412,pjshorthorn,2021-07-16 12:25:00,5654,3 am in the middle of the week is your friend. PjShorthorn
6579414,pjshorthorn,2021-07-16 12:28:00,5654,Dunkin Donuts had the inside scoop on the border opening. Timed the grand opening perfectly.......maybe. LOL.PjShorthorn
6579422,Wallychowder,2021-07-16 12:35:00,1567,Chocolate Moose will be running morning specials !
6578968,RichA$1970,2021-07-15 10:08:00,1159,It’s like jigging and just getting those annoying light taps on your line.
6579104,Northwoodswalleye,2021-07-15 17:55:00,262,Never going again. I refuse to jump thru any hoops to fish where they don’t want us anyway. Plenty of places in the USA to fish. They may not be as good but I’ll survive.
6579108,Eckohlt,2021-07-15 18:04:00,3685,I'll jump thru hoop after hoop to get where the fish are.

6579234,FishManDan,2021-07-16 05:58:00,697,Wow just read that article and thinking fake news is everywhere. Live in Detroit area and our news says 5% of Canadians are vaccinated. Yeah I know this article says 1st shot at 80% but sounds like bull when the US can't get to 70%. So you head over to fish and get it although &#x1f914;you are vaccinated. You get to pay cash if you end up getting medical care there?
6579240,pjshorthorn,2021-07-16 06:14:00,5654,"Well, there will be at least one less vehicle in line waiting to cross then. Good to know.... PjShorthorn"
6579244,Wallychowder,2021-07-16 06:22:00,1567,LOL. Its going to take a whole lot more than 1
6578794,Eckohlt,2021-07-14 17:59:00,3685,"Maybe that's why the lakes are low,your draining them with thirst,but a man would get awful thirsty reeling in fish everyday."
6578796,prov1800,2021-07-14 18:04:00,5010,It's a tough job fishing in this heat so you have to keep yourself hydrated.Surface temps a littke warm now it lake water will do
6578800,Eckohlt,2021-07-14 18:13:00,3685,"Swim to the bottom then take a big gulp of water,nice n cold near the bottom,just don't drink to much john,water might get to low and people be taking there lower units off.hahaha"

6578878,RichA$1970,2021-07-15 04:56:00,1159,6 more days til the 21st and crickets.
6578880,Bstar,2021-07-15 05:24:00,564,Yep
6578938,Eckohlt,2021-07-15 09:11:00,3685,Tick tick tick goes the clock.
6578940,Hookhunter75,2021-07-15 09:14:00,60,They are saying the next lifting of restrictions will just be minor tweaks. I wonder what that even means.
6578944,kettyspanky,2021-07-15 09:24:00,271,The minor tweaks mean that we are not crossing for at least another month if not longer.
6578950,Hookhunter75,2021-07-15 09:34:00,60,My thoughts exactly.
6577976,walleyecheek,2021-07-12 15:36:00,2231,? Please explain
6578464,bigwalleye1,2021-07-14 06:40:00,2632,"The hot topic for me is gonna be how low the water is on Lac Seul. I've been watching www.lwcb.ca and there's gonna be a whole lot of new rock piles that get found....the hard way...... 1167 is the height of LS when they did the depth chart maps, fyi, and its running 1165 or less, in the 10th percentile based on average. That's WAY low.... Be careful out there......"
6578476,That Minnesota guy,2021-07-14 06:55:00,8293,There will be a thick piece of ice over the lake when it opens. So snowmobiles might have to watch for a rock sticking up boats will be OK.
6578618,Eckohlt,2021-07-14 10:45:00,3685,"I'll be swimming up in Ontario in sept,and not in a hotel,it's a go."
6578674,Guest,2021-07-14 12:44:00,0,a little early to be drinking dont you think
6578700,prov1800,2021-07-14 14:05:00,5010,If you have been there before you should have a undeŕstanding of the lake.If not best take it easy for the first trip out.
6578714,Eckohlt,2021-07-14 14:51:00,3685,I don't drink the lake water unless it's boiled for a bit.
6578750,prov1800,2021-07-14 16:05:00,5010,Drink it straight up.Good stuff.
6578772,Eckohlt,2021-07-14 17:04:00,3685,"Do u drink a lot of lake water john?I thought I saw you glow in the dark when we were ice fishing,,you must have had a jug of wabigoons finest H2O."
6578776,prov1800,2021-07-14 17:14:00,5010,Stomach can handle most lake water even Wabigoon but not down river from wabigoon or Clay Lake.
6577708,troutwater,2021-07-11 20:00:00,299,The condition of 502
6577714,RichA$1970,2021-07-11 20:12:00,1159,"Once we cross the border there will be no topic except for how fast can we get there. I do think it will be interesting how many fisherman will be stranded at Intl Falls due to incorrect paperwork, invalid shots, etc and what are they going to do."
6577736,Jimmy Mac,2021-07-11 21:30:00,96,"No dog in the fight for me, but I think when the border finally does open there will be controversy among some Canadians who will argue the border was opened too soon which will jeopardize the health of the citizens. And how about this, those arguing to keep the border closed will claim the politicians caved to the pressure from business owners who rely upon tourism.. Jimmy Mac"

6577900,Bstar,2021-07-12 11:27:00,564,The hot topic will be about how many people were injured or killed in the first mad stampede of humanity crossing the bridge over the Rainy River to get to the border! It will be like the Yukon gold rush! Lol

6577700,kettyspanky,2021-07-11 19:41:00,271,"If and when it happens I think wait times will be long, new procedures will be in place. I understand it will take time to make sure everything is legit with our paperwork. Patience will be a big thing. People might try to choose earlier in the morning or later in the evening to cross with less traffic. It will be interesting to say the least."
6577702,v-bay gord,2021-07-11 19:44:00,3168,"I've given up on August, but looking positive for after Aug 21.......and will probably stay open into October for those that need to freeze their arses off."
