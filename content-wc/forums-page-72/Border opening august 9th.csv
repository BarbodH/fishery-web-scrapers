6580518,hoppy63,2021-07-19 18:27:00,367,How soon are you able to sign up on line and register on the Arrivecan site for those that don't have a smart phone with the app? Just curious if it can be done now or if there is a certain time frame.
6580522,phishfearme,2021-07-19 18:28:00,1242,just tried to fill out the ArriveCAN site: - it says your arrival date must be between 7/18 and 7/22 - WTF? - then i got an error message: Error 1: Your arrival date and time is greater than 72 hours. WTF?? how can a date and time be greater than 72 hours?? i gave up assuming there's lots of bugs to fix phish
6580574,BreezyPoint,2021-07-19 19:42:00,1581,"You can register but you cannot complete the application until it is less than 72 hours before your arrival.That is not a bug (not worded the best, but that is what it means).Frank"
