6577886,spoonchucker,2021-07-12 11:07:00,82,"Just posted on their facebook GANGLER'S UPDATE:We are optimistic we will soon see news addressing a reopening of the US/Canadian border and non-residents being allowed to enter Canada. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on Thursday that changes are coming in the next few weeks. He also confirmed non-resident travelers will be required to have proof of both vaccinations before entering. That policy will be in effect for several months. Gangler's currently has a small crew on site preparing to open. Once the reopening is announced, Gangler's will begin finalizing new dates and reservations for the remaining 2021 spots. We do expect to have some availability. So whether you are an existing guest wishing to reschedule 2021 or a new guest wanting to make a reservation, please contact our office at [email protected] to secure your space.Gangler's will be hosting fishermen through late September."
6577896,Bstar,2021-07-12 11:21:00,564,I seen that post on FB. Got a call from our camp owner last week and he had guarded optimism about an announcement on 7/21 or before. I hope it happens but I would be surprised.
6577916,prov1800,2021-07-12 12:05:00,5010,Every 2 weeks trudeau says another 2 weeks were going blah blah blah.and every month another extension.If they had any kind of program for the border we would of heard something about it already.They just dont have any type of plan in place.just more bulls**t announcements to keep up interest.Of course I hope iam wrong but losing faith and tired of the politics playing games with people.

Thye are rolling my fully paid trip that was originally 2020 to 2022 now""We appreciate your patience in regards to the current Covid 19 situation. It is hard to believe it is severely affecting another season when many other countries are reopening. Here is our latest update.The Canadian government has extended the border closure to July 21 with no clear guidelines as to when it will reopen. Yesterday, the Public Safety Minister was on CBC and stated they will require 75% of the Canadian public must be fully vaccinated before they will consider reopening the border. He was specifically asked if this points to a late August opening at the earliest and he would not even confirm that. With that being said, we are now hoping for an opening probably around Aug. 31 although it is possible the closure could extend later. We are extremely sympathetic to our guests wanting to ensure themselves a trip somewhere in 2021 and you are more than welcome to reschedule your trip to 2022 if you like. At this time, we do plan on offering 4 and 8 day trips in September so maybe an option too. Please let us know how you would like to proceed. Best wishes,Ken GanglerGanglerâ€™s Fly-In Lodges""Until the canadian border site says we can cross and what is required, we are wasting time typing stuff."
