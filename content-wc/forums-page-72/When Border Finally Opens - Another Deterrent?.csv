6578832,prov1800,2021-07-14 20:51:00,5010,And again and again.
6578952,MikeAnkeny,2021-07-15 09:36:00,67,Double booked today for Minnesota trip or Lac Seul for Sept 11. Going fishing no matter what. Got last cabin at Zippel.
6579092,IowaWalleye1978,2021-07-15 17:32:00,96,Sameâ€¦going to lake of the woods will be at either flag or spruce!
6578484,Bill Krejca,2021-07-14 07:16:00,6107,"When and if the border opens in the next month or so, will portions of the bush become closed due to fire hazard? Just thinking. Bill"
6578490,Pooch,2021-07-14 07:24:00,4618,"The other day I was looking at Ontario fires at this link. Fairly large fire up on Birch Lake, an area I used to be familiar with. The area under fire ban appears huge.https://www.lioapplications.lrc.gov....ewer=FFIM.FFIMPooch"
6578498,Pooch,2021-07-14 07:33:00,4618,"Just looked again at the fire up on Birch Lake (NE of trout lake) and it has grown and appears to be nearing a two cabin outpost and close to a private cabin on an island at the opening of the bay.There used to be a core drilling winter camp between Birch and Dole that may no longer be there, if it was still active.Pooch"
6578512,Pooch,2021-07-14 08:01:00,4618,Also see a fairly large fire on Seseganaga that is across the bay from a camp we used to fish in the 1990's. That camp could be real close to the fire if conditions change.Pooch
6578568,Skywagon,2021-07-14 09:21:00,1106,"We heard yesterday that there was a fire in the Eagle Lake area, Gord probably has the scoop on that. We have had a couple of small fires in our general vicinity, but the bombers have done a good job in keeping things under control. The smoke is not too bad here this morning as the wind has changed (out of the south-east), so I plan on going up to the cabin this afternoon (if flight visibility up there allows) for a couple of days while the temps are decent to do some work. I guess when the job gets done if the smoke is too bad to get out, I will be forced into doing some walleye fishing to kill time."
6578592,adempsey2.0,2021-07-14 09:50:00,611,They already are. Definitely areas of Quetico park are closed off. If we don't get some good rain soon the situation is unlikely to improve. People are evacuating areas around Red Lake as well. I think primarily near Nungesser Lake. It looks like an apocalyptic war zone.
6578596,v-bay gord,2021-07-14 09:51:00,3168,"Yes, they were working on a small fire on a hill by Canoe Narrows...likely caused by the lightning we had the night before. Where we were sitting I could hear helicopters and saw the MNR spotter plane. It was so smokey from all the other fires you couldn't actually see the smoke from this fire. They must have put it out pretty quick. Bonus points to the MNR and their fire crews and aircraft. I'm going musky fishing tonight to shake some of the rust off....."
6578604,johnboat,2021-07-14 10:07:00,2014,I saw some videos from Red Lake. Heavy smoke there as well.
6578704,prov1800,2021-07-14 14:15:00,5010,Red Lake is close to be evacuated again
6578778,reddemon2,2021-07-14 17:17:00,255,Sweet
