6575602,andreindy,2021-07-04 12:57:00,308,"Just curious. I just purchased a William's Whitefish and out of the package the treble was on the skinny end. The Whitefish in my box I put the single hook all on the wider end...which has me believing I swapped them that way hook for hook. Any big difference on what end you use for your hooks? Truth be told, I have never fished them seriously yet. But they sure look pretty in the water. Man, I sure miss Canada."
6575604,Eckohlt,2021-07-04 13:01:00,3685,I would say hook on the wide end
6575608,Huntindave,2021-07-04 13:12:00,2194,"A quick Google search shows all the images with the hook same as the packaged bait. This would lead me to believe that is the way the design is intended to be used. If your catch rates are better for you, with it the other way around , then who am I to argue."
6575634,gaspumper,2021-07-04 15:21:00,73,If you google pictures of williams whitefish the hooks are on the small end
6575636,adempsey2.0,2021-07-04 15:28:00,611,Either end. Williams Whitefish - narrow end Williams Quick Silver - wide end
6575712,bthomas3333,2021-07-04 22:50:00,465,Whitefish are really good pike baits. The wabblers are really awesome. The only issue I have is Williams doesnt sell the best colors in the US. Next time in a Canadian fishing shop take a look at the Orange and Chart color. Or order direct from Cabela Canada and ship some down here.Brett

6578838,chris.brock,2021-07-14 21:16:00,112,"I've experimented with that too, my conclusion is hook on the narrow end, I like them as a pike bait when they're jerked and let to fall"
