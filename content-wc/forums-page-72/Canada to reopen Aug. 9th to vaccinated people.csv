For what it's worth, I wasn't making an assumption about all Canadians. Just the ones I keep contact with. Which definitely share many of my views. That's probably why I like them.

In all seriousness, not sure it matters, breakthroughs are a thing all of a sudden and arent supporting this premise if you want to protect vulnerable from vacced people who can be asymptomatic.."

6580642,Guest,2021-07-20 03:31:00,0,"I believe CanaDA and many of its businesses, especially fishing lodges will suffer for many years to come because of the over strict government decisions. Many Americans will never return not to mention many businesses will fail if they have no already. Don't expect everything to go back exactly as it was prior to this virus. It's said but true."

6580294,Hot Runr Guy,2021-07-19 12:20:00,16061,I have to wonder if this will change the minds of some of those who have chosen not to get vaccinated? HRG

6580540,nomorehandcuffs,2021-07-19 18:50:00,126,Yes it changes my mind. I don't want to go there anymore. It's not right to discriminate against people who don't want to take a vaccine that's not fully approved. Or one that is for that matter. It should be illegal for them to even ask if you are vaccinated. The fact is at this point anyone who wants to be vaccinated can be so if your afraid of the virus get it. If not move on with life.I also get that the decision was made by their government not the rural people who I would have supported with my dollars. Seems to be a disconnect between government and good ol country folks.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk

6580568,BreezyPoint,2021-07-19 19:39:00,1581,You make a lot of assumptions about the rural people in Canada thinking they support your view. I have talked to a small number of resort owners (2) and they want the vaccination requirement.Best thing they can do is avoid another outbreak that shuts them down again. Vaccinations are a help along this route.Your attitude is what my mom used to say is Â‘cutting one's nose off to spite your face'. Go ahead and punish yourself.It is entirely within Canada's right to practice this form of discrimination. It is a sovereign nation and they have a complete RIGHT to make those rules.And Canada is not the only country with this requirement. Many countries require vaccination.Frank

6580576,Baseline,2021-07-19 19:43:00,3207,Yep----It's a foreign country. They make the rules. We get to decide if we want to comply or stay home.
