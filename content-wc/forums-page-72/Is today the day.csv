6580162,Wawajake,2021-07-19 07:13:00,413,"you are missing the point, the border is directly tied to the potential election here, and our leaders will decide the election timing when the stars are aligned and the polls tell them whatthey want. Elections are decided by guided or misguided issues. Sensitive issues like the border are dependent on what majority of Canadians believe. The media giving negativity to status of USA makes majority if Canadians be worried.( whether wrong or right, science based or not) ......so we wait for the ideal circumstances to align before our Prime Minister sticks his neck out on border opening date."
6580164,Jesse-WI,2021-07-19 07:18:00,534,the public opinion polls do not yet support opening the border.
6580166,That Minnesota guy,2021-07-19 07:19:00,8293,I would say today is the day another thread gets shut down.
6580182,Obabikon,2021-07-19 07:46:00,2370,I was told that today at 1:30 is the official announcement
6580190,Canadian fisher,2021-07-19 07:50:00,97,"I think it will be a soft opening for the first run. They will allow property owners and others with special interests (relatives etc.) be allowed in first. This will be kind of a trial run to see how it goes. Once that happens, then the vaccinated will be allowed and the flood gates open. My guess is Aug. 21-Sept 21 will be the soft opening then if all goes well Sept 21 to open the flood gates. Cant wait to get down to the states again, if my prediction is correct (small chance) I will be crossing the border end of August."

6580204,Hookhunter75,2021-07-19 07:58:00,60,Boy I hope that’s wrong. The readout from the Province leaders said vaccinated Americans mid August and outside Other countries starting early September.

6580270,1/4 oz Jig,2021-07-19 11:50:00,90,Border opening for vaccinated Americans august 9th. Negative test 48-72 hours before crossing. Subject to random test at border.
6580108,Eckohlt,2021-07-19 04:42:00,3685,Today or tomorrow?
6580112,Hookhunter75,2021-07-19 05:07:00,60,My guess is tomorrow today is wayyyyy to early to be making that kind of announcement &#x1f923;
6580120,Wawajake,2021-07-19 05:49:00,413,"Considering Canadians are waking up the last couple of mornings to news casts that report how poorly the USA is doing with vaccinations compared to other countries now and how the covid cases are increasing dramatically in just about every state ( due to delta variant) me thinks our political leaders that are waiting to announce an election at the perfect strategic time .....are not going to announce border opening to USA yet, when negative media reports show how USA citizens are risky proposition. Lets be honest, BOTH sides of the border have a responsibility to get their ducks in a row to make this happen."
6580126,stjoeguy,2021-07-19 05:58:00,979,"Totally agree. No sense rushing into these things. I got a call from our outfitter last night asking if a shorter trip would work for us. We're supposed to fly in on the 14th. Fingers are crossed and we'll play it by ear, but it's looking very iffy. Fortunately, I've got two trips planned in September that have a better chance. I owned a business before retiring and can't imagine going through what they've endured."
6580128,Hookhunter75,2021-07-19 06:04:00,60,They are not dramatically rising in every state. They are dramatically rising in dense under protected areas. My state has a higher vaccination rate and lower positivity percentage. We have seen a slight increase but that is expected with the variant and with opening. This is an issue of the unvaccinated now and those that choose to take that risk. Canadian public health officials are even quoting in Canadian news that Vaccinated individuals pose little risk. What will most likely happen in my opinion is they will require pre testing and arrival testing to mitigate potential positives arriving at border. This will also deter a lot of travelers.
6580130,Hookhunter75,2021-07-19 06:05:00,60,However with all of that said England put harsh isolation restrictions on France last minute. Anything can happen.
6580134,Hookhunter75,2021-07-19 06:12:00,60,There is no optimal time to open. What will people wait for? The fall when cases statistically increase? You should not be punished if you are protected. People chose the shot for health and personal life preservation.
