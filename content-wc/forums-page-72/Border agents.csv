6577936,hawks_rule,2021-07-12 13:15:00,115,From the US side perspective perhaps they are down trying to stop the gigantic mess on our southern border?
6577260,RichA$1970,2021-07-10 06:40:00,1159,"If announcements are coming, I assume both sides of the border have been operating with reduced border agent staffing. Typically I have seen return to work announcements to those who have been furloughed in the past so I wonder how much notice must be provided in their contracts?You would think they would need to return for additional training in new protocols for testing & inspection so if things were going to open up soon, they would be notified or preparing to return to work."
6577262,tv4fish,2021-07-10 06:48:00,2694,"Rich: I certainly agree - I'm sure the agents are going to have a complete NEW line of questions for us as we try to enter Canada............. AND: I also am very certain that the new ""entry policy"" is going to just make the lines longer as we try to enter Canada."
6577268,Wallychowder,2021-07-10 07:25:00,1567,They'll be lined up clear back to Cloquet !
6577272,MikeF,2021-07-10 07:34:00,895,"Maybe Canada will be smart enough to offer reserved crossing times for a price, similar to Disney and Great America parks. Just drive on past all those waiting in line with your preferred crossing reservation in hand."
6577284,That Minnesota guy,2021-07-10 08:20:00,8293,"It's not open, they have plenty of time for training."
6577288,Eckohlt,2021-07-10 08:31:00,3685,"Won't be long now,n.w Ontario lookout here we come!!"
6577314,Hookhunter75,2021-07-10 11:26:00,60,Thatâ€™s a fact Ontario is moving to stage 3 5 days earlier than expected. Something positive will happen before summers end
6577352,Eckohlt,2021-07-10 17:52:00,3685,"Border agent needs to ask 3 questions,,,,,are you vaccinated,yes,,,,your passport,yes,,,,do you have lots of money,,,yes a sht load,,,have a great trip,,,easy as that."
