6577552,fishron,2021-07-11 12:08:00,317,"Thanks for the update Andre. A few years back my group and I made three yearly trips to Hebert. No walleye lake I've ever fished comes close to Hebert and there have been some good ones. Jean and his son flew us into the Moselle/Natikim area on our last fly-in. We decided to try that area because hard surface roads took us all the way to the airbase. It was a good trip and maybe my last fly-in. We've lost two guys and at 77, I'm still tempted but the easy trips are creeping in. Jean and his sons are great pilots."
6577554,Andre (wallyandre),2021-07-11 12:20:00,2274,I'm going tomorrow to Lake Angèle the 2nd time in 2 years. I was undecided between Angèle and Hebert but I pick Angèle mostly because of the coming weather this week; Angele is a smaller lake so it's fishable even if it's windy. Walleyes are smaller but in numbers and there is a good population of big pikes. I'm flying from the Ste-Anne base; no gravel road but more $$ . No chance to break a windshield or tire and less time on the road and more time in the boat fishing. Air Tamarac is a family own business and one of the top in the province of Quebec. On the age side I decide to do the more I can before something happen and saying: I should done it!
