6577974,Wallychowder,2021-07-12 14:57:00,1567,just hide deep in the bush when they come ! They wont look for ya that long !
6577992,Eckohlt,2021-07-12 16:20:00,3685,"That's a waste of fuel to come back,they don't need to bother,times are tough save the fuel."
6578016,prov1800,2021-07-12 17:16:00,5010,"We didn't get anything big the other day 18 ""about the biggest but have caught 28"" there and a 40"" pike.So there in there.right now in most lakes there are so many smaller fish tgat are wa√Ω more aggressive than larger ones and they sworm on your bait."
6578026,Eckohlt,2021-07-12 17:27:00,3685,"That's a good problem when they fight to see who can get to the bait first,we have that same problem here in MN,hahaha"
6578038,prov1800,2021-07-12 17:35:00,5010,Definatly a good thing.Makes for a action packed day
6578046,Eckohlt,2021-07-12 17:40:00,3685,"Most of the swarming here john occurs at the buffets in the casino,it's a hot bite."

6577718,prov1800,2021-07-11 20:36:00,5010,Today felt good flying into Zizania Lake with 2 guests from Toronto for the day.The fishing there was insane as usuall.Lots of smoke everywhere from the fires.My 2 guests had never fished so today was a real experience for them and they learned real fast.caught to many to keep track of but I know I put around 12 doz minnows in the bag this morning and they were gone when we went to dock to get ready to be picked up a 3.Few dead ones floating in minnow bucket were used off the dock and those were gone in minutes.Water temps near 80 F so getting hot.No relieve in sight with hot weather or any rain in forecast.Bad situation.
