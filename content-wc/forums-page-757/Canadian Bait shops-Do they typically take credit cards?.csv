I'm wondining if the bait shop on the way to Lac Seul up 105 on the left takes CC's. I just don't like paying more due to poor exchange offerings. I know I pay about 3% now for the conversion with the CC. Thanks! T-11 days before we leave!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

In the USA most retailers absorb the cost that visa charges, but I have seen that coming to an end in some places I shop. Visa needs to rethink that practice as the retailers look for ways to increase profits passing on VISA's fees to consumers may not be in their best interest."
