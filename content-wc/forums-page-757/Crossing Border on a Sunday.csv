548523,Guest,2005-05-29 18:41:00,0,It shouldn't be bad. Way better than on a Saturday!
548526,Guest,2005-05-30 00:23:00,0,HI. going up wont be bad but when we came back last year on sunday there were 10 customs guys just waiting for us so you know we got the full Monty. probably would have happened anyway no matter what day we came back though. Just no wait for a change. have fun we go up next month.
