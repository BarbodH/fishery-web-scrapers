548347,Guest,2005-05-25 12:49:00,0,I need a place to stay between Cloque and International Falls. I'm late in checking and most of the national chains are booked up any suggestions on a Ma & Pa type place?
548363,Trailerguy,2005-05-25 14:42:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]The Super 8 in International Falls is seldom booked full, and the desk is open all night it's right on Hwy 53. I'll probably be pulling in there tonight about 1AM."
548364,Guest,2005-05-25 14:58:00,0,What cities/towns are in that path?
548372,Guest,2005-05-25 16:33:00,0,The Super 8 was full but I found the last two rooms in northern Mn.
548470,Guest,2005-05-27 10:35:00,0,"for an inexpensive night in a plain motel, try Andersons in Orr, MN"
