If you are 30 years old and had your passport picture taken when you were 8....it may cause you problems! If you ever plan on going overseas you will need to have a valid one."
548241,Guest,2005-05-23 06:29:00,0,"I looked at the link. It still wasn't clear until I called the Canadian Customs guy. 11 lbs per person for all meat (beef/chicken/pork) that is labelled. You know, store label ""inspected USDA"" etc. NO wild game. NO root vegatables (potatoes and the like) that are fresh. Same with fresh stone fruits like peaches. Reason is there still may be some pests lurking inside. PROCESSED fruits and vegatables are okay. The potato thread made the point that ""Simply Potatoes"" in the dairy case are okay, because again, they have been processed."
548242,Guest,2005-05-23 06:59:00,0,Hi MT: Thanks for the insight re crossings/inspections. We'll be crossing at Peace bridge in another month and we rented a 4X8 U Haul trailer for all our stuff. Someone said this may be a problem(which I've not heard of and don't believe) but assuming a small trailer is still allowed in and out of Canada what's the best way to organize it for easy inspection by Customs if necessary? Thanks.
548245,MTWalleyeHunter,2005-05-23 07:12:00,61,"bw, There is really no way to organize a Uhaul trailer for easy inspection. If you are transporting any firearms, you will want to put them somewhere accessible. If it were me I would make an itemized list of everything that is in the trailer and present that to Customs upon arrival. There are no problems with transporting a Uhaul trailer to/from Canada. Just make sure you have the rental documents."
548445,MJ,2005-05-26 18:29:00,11,I called that number and it was not working. Do you have a number for Canadian Customs where I could talk to a real person and get some of my questions answered? Thanx............MJ
548190,MJ,2005-05-21 10:53:00,11,"Ok, we are crossing into Canada at Emerson. Has anyone been thru there this year and what did they confiscate? Last year we bought dog and cat food 3 times.......we crossed at International Falls that time and they got the dry animal food on the way in. Repurchased in Ontario and on the way back at Emerson they got it on the way back out. This got expensive!!! Who would I call to ask at the customs at Emerson in Manitoba? Thanks, MJ"
548193,Trailerguy,2005-05-21 11:03:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Customs through out the border have the same rules, it's the luck of the draw wether they enforce any of them on a given day. Beef products are a no no, going both directions, that's why they took the dog food. If you can find a dogfood that has no beef products (chicken for instance)they won't bother you."
548194,Guest,2005-05-21 11:26:00,0,"NO beef products? I thought I had read recently that beef/meat is now allowed across for personal consumption (labeled and limited to so many lbs per person). No pet food, no potatoes (processed okay though), no fresh stone fruits (peaches and the like). If I am wrong (as I often am...ask my wife) give me the link to the current regs. Thanks."
548195,Trailerguy,2005-05-21 11:40:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Dog food is not for human consumption, not the same as a steak you're taking to grill. ""Beef Products"" used as protein sources for animal feed ""could"" include parts of downer cows that ""could"" carry Mad Cow, ect. Beef for human cosumption is ""supose"" to be from beef less than 30 months old, to enter the USA, and live cattle aren't allowed either."
548196,Guest,2005-05-21 11:43:00,0,"Thanks. That makes sense. To make sure I was right about the meat (for HUMAN consumption) regs, I went ahead and called customs at Fort Francis. They said ALL meat okay except for wild game. So beef/chicken/pork all fine, up to 11 lbs. per person."
548212,MJ,2005-05-21 21:34:00,11,So..............does that mean that we can take dog/cat food in or not? I may be confused and so what else is new?
548216,MTWalleyeHunter,2005-05-21 22:34:00,61,"I cannot speak for the Canada Customs Officers, but can answer any questions about crossing back into the US. The most important thing is to bring proof of citizenship. If you are a US Citizen the only acceptable forms are....passport, birth certificate (showing birth in the US of course), or naturalization documents (for those of you born outside the US). Canadians... make sure you bring your birth certificate, passport, or citizenship card. First of all no personal use beef products are allowed coming from Canada. This includes your McDonalds burger and also your dog food that has any beef or mystery ingredient such as ""animal by-product meal"". The only exception to this is if you can prove without a doubt that the product is of US origin. If you bring back fruit....it better be of US or Canadian origin (and be able to prove it) or you can kiss it goodbye. Don't be tempted to by ANY live plants in Canada. Alcohol....If you have been in Canada for more than 48 hours, you can bring back one case of beer or one liter of booze per person duty free. After that (depending on what type of booze) you can expect to pay around $3.00/bottle IRT tax. Includes ""Duty Free"" Purchases Tobacco....If you are in Canada for more than 48 hours, you will be allowed one carton of cigarettes duty free....any more is about $4.00/carton. Don't even think about bringing that box of Cubans back with you either. Believe me it ain't worth our time. If we catch you with them, they are on the bottom of our priority list, so if you do you'll be waiting a long time before we get around to doing the paperwork. Before your trip, make sure your vehicle is clean of ammunition and any other surprises. Make sure you leave those spare shotgun shells rolling around in the bed of your pickup at home and make sure you leave the .45 stashed under your seat at home as well. For those of you traveling with kids........If both parent are with you, just remember to bring the kid's birth certificate. If only one parent.....also bring a notarized letter from the other parent authorizing you to take the kid out of the country. This should answer quite a few questions floating around out there, but please ask before you go, it makes everyone's live's easier....especially yours."
548219,MJ,2005-05-22 09:53:00,11,"Obviously you work for US customs and I thank you for the comprehensive information. Do you know how I can find out the same information, specifically about entering Canada? We know the fire arms and alcohol laws but it seems that food items change every year. One year it was poultry and we lost all our chicken and eggs then the next it was potatoes and dry animal food. A phone number perhaps? Thanks again."

548230,Guest,2005-05-22 18:18:00,0,Hey MT. My passport expired last fall. would it be worth my time to bring that along anyways? I used it last year and came in handy. thank you.
