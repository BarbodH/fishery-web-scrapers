548262,Guest,2005-05-23 22:07:00,0,Does it cover the cost of the tow vehicle and the boat trailer?
548266,Guest,2005-05-24 01:51:00,0,"The question is this, is it cheaper to buy the pass for a one time round trip use, or just pay the toll for a round trip of a car with boat trailer? thanks alan"
548268,Guest,2005-05-24 06:29:00,0,"To answer the last three questions. 1). The bridge pass is for the International Falls bridge only. 2). The bridge pass does not cover the cost of your boat trailer, (you will have to pay another fee for dragging your boat across the bridge, they don't make a pass card for trailers either). 3). If you have one tow vehicle and a boat trailer, and you will not be using this bridge crossing in the next year, it is cheaper to just pay the $6 charge for your vehicle compaired to the $10 for the bridge pass."
548269,Trailerguy,2005-05-24 06:31:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]The swipe card only covers the vehicle, not the trailer. I'm not sure if you can pay the extra for the trailer and still use the swipe card. But I'm sure I'll find out this summer."
548386,rpieske,2005-05-25 22:25:00,1276,Round trip is not an issue since you only pay going from USA to Canada. Return is free.
548443,Guest,2005-05-26 17:40:00,0,"The bridge is a rip-off. Lets face it, both governments have built roads with tax-payers money to this point on the border. The road is essential to the operation of the mills on both sides of the border, yet we, as taxpayers are held for ransom to cross this piece of sh#t! In the past you could purchase a book of tickets that had no expiration, unlike this new card. In the ""new"" system you pay going into Canada for two trips.......a return trip as well. What if you don't plan on returning at that border crossing....what a load of cr*p! As you can tell I am frustrated at this. I have often said the next trip through I would just not stop to pay. I don't think the chub at the booth would be fast enought to catch me....wonder what the repurcution would be. Gee, I must have missed seeing it! Take me to prison? What a crock. P'o'd"
548460,Guest,2005-05-27 06:26:00,0,"Trailerguy, you can use the swipe card for your vehicle and pay extra for your trailer. I have been doing this for the last three years."
548188,Hammerhead Herb,2005-05-21 09:06:00,259,"I read on the Ft Frances Chamber websitehttp://www.fortfranceschamber.com/bordercrossing.html that you can get bridge passes for US$10 for 12 roundtrips. ""You may chose to purchase a swipe card which is good for 12 round trips, although they do have an expiry date. Swipe cards can be purchased at Canada Safeway (417 Scott Street) in Fort Frances at a cost of $14.00 Canadian. Cards can also be purchased in International Falls at Stop & Shop, Super One, and Super Value for $10.00 US"" Does anyone know what the expiration date is? Does anyone know if you can use them for dfferent vehicles? We have a number of cars crossing at the same time and this would be perfect to pass these onto our buddies right behind us. Normal price is US$6 per crossing. This brings the price down to less than US$1 per crossing. Where in Intl. Falls is the 1. Stop & Shop, 2. Super One, and 3. Super Value?"
548189,Trailerguy,2005-05-21 10:31:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]That's real interesting, I've seen the Stop&Shop, it's right on HWY 53 before the border. Super Value is on HWY 71. I did an internet search and got their phone #s. The Super One is on Hwy 71. The lady told me the swipe cards are good for cars & pickups, but not trailers,campers,ect, she also says they expire in a year. As many trips as I make up there every year, I'll be picking up a swipe card next trip. Thanks Herb!"
548191,Hammerhead Herb,2005-05-21 10:53:00,259,"Does anyone know who owns that bridge? Ontario, MN, lumber company, etc?"
548192,Trailerguy,2005-05-21 10:56:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]The bridge is owned and maintained by Antibi, the paper mill, a nice cash cow for them."
548198,Fred_G,2005-05-21 12:51:00,908,I purchased my last one at the Conoco station just south of International Falls. I'm not sure if they still have them. It really is a cost saver.
548202,Hammerhead Herb,2005-05-21 17:28:00,259,Is there an expiration date on your pass? We have a group of guys going up in late May and another group going up in late July.
548217,rpieske,2005-05-22 00:41:00,1276,The pass is good for one calendar year from date of purchase.
548220,Hammerhead Herb,2005-05-22 11:20:00,259,"Thanx Bob. Also, can you use it for 2 different vehicles going through in a row? We have a group of folks (2 cars) going up in a week and another group of 2 cars going up in 2 months."
548221,pnnylfr,2005-05-22 11:37:00,114,We used the pass last year for both vehicles. No problem.
548259,phidelt157,2005-05-23 17:24:00,191,"Does the bridge pass work for different bridges going into Canada, or just Int'l falls?"
