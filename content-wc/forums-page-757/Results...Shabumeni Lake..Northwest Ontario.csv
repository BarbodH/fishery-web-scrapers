As usual...the Holiday Inn in I Falls and Larry and Mary Adams with L and M provided world class service. I'll have another Liney'... Thanks for all the tips. Tight lines...http://www.inshore-fishing.com/forum...3b50498906ba8a Regards, Rob"

Cannot wait! There is just something about going to Canada that gets in your blood - I think about our trip all year long. I see you are going to try smallies next year. They are a blast!!"
