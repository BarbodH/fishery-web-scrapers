548522,Guest,2005-05-29 16:07:00,0,"........right out of Tobin Lake this winter (-30) in northern Saskatchewan, an 18+ pounder was caught. Add some eggs to that Momma and you have the world record......sometimes climate has nothing to do with records. Up here we don't have the fishing pressure. You should see the walleye that the commercial fisherman are pulling from the Red River/Lake Winnipeg, 15+ pounders. Cross Bay in northern MB is another local 'hole' that could have the next big one, walleye or pike. I'm sure most would rather catch a quantity of 6-15 pounders on a Canadian vacation, and not go to Colorado on the chance of catching one walleye and having it be a 16 pounder.........13 days until I cross the MB/ONT border for NW Lac Suel. It's gonna be good!!"
548524,Guest,2005-05-29 21:56:00,0,I lied...it wasn't a lure...it was a nightcrawler.
548537,phishfearme,2005-05-30 12:42:00,1242,"i really agree with bobby t's comments about there being little or no chance for canadian lakes to produce a greater than 25 pounder. that 18+ pounder out of tobin was full of immature eggs in the winter and would've no doubt added a few pounds as they matured - but if you caught it then it would be illegal to keep it - out of season. let's also keep in mind what that 7 pound difference between that 18 pounder and the world record is. according to my conversion chart, a 7 pound walleye is 27 inches!! seems to me that REAL 27 inchers are few and far between as it is and catching that 18 pounder is STILL essentially a 27 incher away. an interesting topic though. i think that the MNR would indeed issue some sort of citation if he were to keep the record fish alive since the law requires it to be killed but i'd like to think it would be overturned on appeal and the fish returned to the angler. the financial benefit to ontaio and canada would get alot of attention and turn alot of heads. phish"
548400,Guest,2005-05-26 07:33:00,0,"I was just reading in the paper that some guy caught a world record blue catfish in the Mississippi River in Illinois last week. He kept it alive, and it will go to Cabela's for show and then released. Glad to see it was not killed. There has been several threads about having to kill fish right away on Lac Seul and many other lakes in Canada, and never using the Livewell. What happens if someone in a Canadian Lake catches something that could be a world record fish, whether it is just a line class record, or someone hooks a 26+++ pound walleye. I know that if I hooked a potential record I would want to weigh it, and then either release it, or put it on display. Is there anything in the regulations that would keep me from getting in trouble for bringing in a live walleye on Lac Seul?"
548408,Jimmy Jig,2005-05-26 09:00:00,1905,"You have two choices and only two. Either measure the fish and, or use a scales you have with you and release the fish. Or, kill it and put it on ice and weight it later,then eat it or have it mounted."
548411,Guest,2005-05-26 09:46:00,0,I believe that if you caught a World Record Walleye on Lac Seul and could keep it alive I cant imagine that any DNR person would write you a ticket. The promotional value of a World Record Walleye being caught on Lac Seul in Ontario would be worth millions of $$$$$ to the area and the Province. I know if I caught that Walleye I would do whatever I could to keep it alive and get it into a aquarium.
548420,Guest,2005-05-26 11:35:00,0,"I disagree.....I don't think the fish cops on Lac would give a rats you know what...if you are breaking the law they will ticket you, those guys don't have much of a sense of humor."
548421,Guest,2005-05-26 11:38:00,0,"""You have two choices and only two. Either measure the fish and, or use a scales you have with you and release the fish. Or, kill it and put it on ice and weight it later,then eat it or have it mounted."" EXACTLY!!"
548435,Guest,2005-05-26 16:02:00,0,"No offense to our friends north of the border or the Awesome fishery in NW Ontario, but there is virtually no chance that a worlds record Walleye will be caught up there. The growing season(weather) food sources garentee that even the oldest and healthiest will top out around 15-18 lbs. The records Eyes have come from large Southern lakes. The local records out of ARK/etc compared to Ontario aren't even close more than a 10+lbs difference. The Columbia River out West also has huge eyes. For numbers / taste / quality experience Ontario is the clear winner for pure size several other spots are better. Bobby T"
548488,rebelrn2001,2005-05-27 21:58:00,1563,It's still nice to dream about it.
548489,orchard frank,2005-05-27 22:42:00,1900,"I believe it is a $75 ticket, so go ahead and keep it, it would be worth that much easy."
548493,Larry S,2005-05-28 06:57:00,666,"Usually when you break a posession law you get fined and the game wardens confiscate's the fish ,so I think if you caught a record walleye it would be taken away from you. Just my 2 cents Larry S"
548499,Guest,2005-05-28 15:56:00,0,"I thought I needed to test my theroy that the Game Warden would great me with open arms if I caught a World Record Walleye on Lac Seul and kept it alive. Yesterday I took my favorite lure out of the box and caught me a 30Lb Hog Walleye on Lac Seul. I than drove my boat right by the Game Warden and he of course checked my fish. He even got his picture taken with it. He than escorted me to Ear Falls , tossed me in jail, took my fish and is probably selling it to Cabelas right now. Oh well, at least I showed the guy who said that nobody would ever catch a new World Record Walleye on Lac Seul."
