548509,Guest,2005-05-29 06:40:00,0,"We have been going for 15 years the second week in June. (Houseboat) Have done all sorts of things for bait including live minnows, leeches, crawlers....Our best (and easiest to keep) is salted minnows and crawlers and never have had problems getting a lot of fish"
548527,Guest,2005-05-30 00:28:00,0,Hi. If you think the lake is great try just below the dam at ear falls its even better. A word to the wise.
548529,Guest,2005-05-30 07:16:00,0,"For the salted minnow folks; I have been conducting a test for the last year, and this test isn't as sound proof as some scientific experiments but it is a test. I have found the gulp has worked as good or better then salted minnows. No I do not work for Berkly"
547254,Guest,2005-04-25 08:39:00,0,Four of us are going to Lac Seul for the first time this year. Would like to know what live bait is best for when we go. We will be there the second week of June. We like to jig fish and we do some bottom bouncing in Lakes we have fished before. We have always gone on fly ins in the past and used salted minnows. Thanks for any help you can give us. Joe
547258,Guest,2005-04-25 10:29:00,0,"Joe, Second week of June is often an interesting time on Lac Seul. Walleyes are usually in some form of transition, and it's common to catch big eyes in transition locations, some already in summer locations, and still some in post-spawn locations. The presentations you suggested will work. I doubt you will have to strive far from jigs and bouncers, although it's enjoyable to catch big eyes on cranks. Again, second week of June, big walleyes can be caught on cranks out of surprisingly shallow water with the right weather and water temperature combination. These little places are still kept fairly quiet. The spring is progressing fast so crawlers will be available when you go. This brings up the minnow-crawler debate. I've put in many days on Seul (hundreds) with both and feel that while in many conditions they produce equally well, overall minnows out-produce crawlers more often than vice-versa. Leeches do not work as well. They've been tested various times of the year both by myself and others I know, and are consistently not as effective, not to say they don't work, just not as well. The advantage to crawlers and particularly leeches is they're more resilient that minnows. Minnows are particularly vulnerable in summer water temperatures, but when you are going in early-June water temp. for minnows won't be an issue."
547262,fishingbuddy,2005-04-25 11:10:00,18,"Been fishing the Northwestern part of Lac Suel for the past seven years now and have fished that time of year also. Salted minnows will work on jigs, hot colors to use are chartruese or orange jigs but may not be a big facter thou either. You can pick up live minnows usually at any camp if you prefer live minnows also. If you like to pull spinners, spinners and minnows work great along with night crawlers also on a harness. Leeches work great also. It is kinda what you prefer to fish with. If the water is cold yet, minnows might be the trick to use and switch to leeches and crawlers when the water warms. Your in for a treat if you have never fished Lac Suel before. If your fishing the northwestern part or Mackensie bay area can give you some areas to try. Can e-mail me if your looking for more info on some areas to try at that time of year. Good fishing."

Oh ya, as far as baits and presentations in June on Lac Seul i would recommend, depending on weather, to jig or bottom bounce in the morning and switch to cranks in shallow water in the afternoon, you can get both big northern and walleye that way. D"

You then say ""as far as baits and presentations in June on Lac Seul i would recommend, depending on weather, to jig or bottom bounce in the morning and switch to cranks in shallow water in the afternoon, you can get both big northern and walleye that way."" YOU SAID THE SAME THING EINSTEIN. Most of the readers on this board (although perhaps not you) are intelligent enough to notice that! So if I have no idea, then apparently NEITHER DO YOU!! Again, I don't know who you THINK you are, but anyone who knows me wouldn't LEGITIMATELY be able to make such a claim to 'production.' Making illegitimate claims and then offering the exact same advice!!! Sounds to me like somebody just posting to see their own thoughts! But I'll let the WC readers judge for themselves . . ."

547284,Guest,2005-04-25 20:15:00,0,"Go to Four Seasons bait shop in Ear Falls. Get the Klass spinners. Put a minnow, leach or crawler on it and have fun. I think it does not matter that much what is on the end of a spinner. If it is meat, the walleye will eat it. I have all three with me at the beginning of the trip, and prefer leaches just for the ease. Buy'em by the pound keep them in a small bucket. One day leeches will do better, one day minnows, the next worms. Whatever you are more comportable with, is the best bait to use. Spinners are better for searching for fish. Once you find that windy hump where the fish are biting, then I like to switch to a jig on other passes over the hump."
547286,orchard frank,2005-04-25 20:57:00,1900,"Been going there for a long time at all times of the season, NWO is telling it like it is. Cranks can be really hot at times. Last year the ""Glass Minnow"" colored husky jerks were HOT for us, it is a white color. First part of June, we we're throwing it into 6"" of water and bringing it back, caught some real slugs in 2' or less. I posted earlier, watch for seagulls walking on the beach right at the waterline, this signals a gnat hatch, the eyes are there, believe me. Good Luck. You may want to post where you are headed, lots of good info on this board."
548297,Guest,2005-05-24 16:07:00,0,"The biggest, fattest live minnows you can find work best. Also some medium-sized leeches. We have used ""salty's"" in the past, but we find that those break apart quickly due to the salt (especially when you hook them through the head)"
548309,Winnie,2005-05-24 22:46:00,375,How do you guys present the cranks? Do you cast them or troll them?
