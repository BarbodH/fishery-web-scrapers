548511,Larry S,2005-05-29 08:05:00,666,On the second week of July we are going to be fishing the English River below the Ear Falls dam at Little Canada Camp for the first time. Generally is there any difference the way you would fish the river as compared to the way you would fish Lac Seul at this time of the year? Thank you for your help Larry S
