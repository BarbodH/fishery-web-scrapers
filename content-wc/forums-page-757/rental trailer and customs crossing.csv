A U-Haul conks out on a city bridge, the police shut the whole city down thinking its a truck bomb. A U-Haul crossing the border may be looked at similar to that...so as I said, I'd think it would be best to expect delays. PS, what are you bringing to camp if you need a U-Haul?"

548564,wooglin,2005-05-31 08:01:00,371,Ah - gotcha. Maybe that won't pose as much of an issue - I was thinking you're going up there with a 26 footer....those things suck! I'd still pack it though for easy in-and-out of stuff if they want to rip it apart! Good luck!
