Stop at the Canadian customs on they way through and they will fill it out for you if you have the boat's info. It's just a way to temporarily import your boat without paying the taxes, etc on it to leave it in Canada permanently. This is also done with 5th wheels and travel trailers that are being kept on a site for the season. This one is easy to follow so might as well get the form and be legal."

548437,Guest,2005-05-26 16:49:00,0,"Wrong my friend, an E-99 form is needed if you are going to leave your US registered boat in Canada."
548486,Jimmy Jig,2005-05-27 20:27:00,1905,"Otts, call F.R.Camp they can tell you. People leave boats there all the time."
548349,Otts,2005-05-25 12:57:00,119,"I am heading to Lac Suel twice this summer. I would like to leave my boat at the resort for 10 days between the two trips. I haven't asked the resort owner if this is even possible yet. The question is, if I leave my boat in Canada, will I have any hassel crossing the border back to the US? When I come back to the US do they even know if I brought a boat in? What do you guys think? Otts"
548354,Guest,2005-05-25 13:40:00,0,"People from our camp do it quite often. I have never heard of anyone having any difficulty. However, things concerning boarders have changed in recent years. I would be very surprised if you have trouble."
548355,Guest,2005-05-25 14:04:00,0,This was discussed on a prior thread but I think if youonly leave it for 10 days you would be OK. I don't see how US customs would know or care if you left your boat
548358,Guest,2005-05-25 14:24:00,0,I do it all the time..no problems yet.
548360,Guest,2005-05-25 14:35:00,0,"I know several friends who own cabins on Dieffenbaker lake, Saskatchewan that leave their boats there all summer. Also... at Tobin, I always see North Dakota boats sitting in the resort storage areas."

548367,MTWalleyeHunter,2005-05-25 15:45:00,61,"There would be no problem with US Customs, but I can't speak for Canada Customs."
548368,Dr. Lee,2005-05-25 15:53:00,15,"I checked with the camp owner where I want to leave my boat and he said that it is fine. He did say that to cover him, I should pick up a short form at the border and leave it with him. Don't know anything more about the form, but apparently there is something. Also, I did leave my boat with a camp owner one other time and had no problems."
548373,2 DOGS,2005-05-25 17:16:00,361,"I believe it's called an ""E 99"". It's at no cost to anyone, it just simply states that you are leaving your boat there for a brief period and you're not bootlegging boats across the border. It is telling the Canadien authorities what's going on. When you'd run into trouble is after the fishing season is over, and should OPP or the MNR go into the camp for whatever reason and see a boat and trailer with a stateside license, in a 2 foot snowdrift, then they'd have a few questions."
548379,MTWalleyeHunter,2005-05-25 20:59:00,61,"Actually it is a customs form CF4457 also known as the certificate of registration. This form is not necessary for a boat/trailer AS LONG as the boat and tariler are registered in a US state, however it does come in useful for other items (high dollar cameras, firearms, etc)"
