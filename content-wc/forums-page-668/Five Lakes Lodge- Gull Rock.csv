563035,grt1,2007-01-28 15:59:00,259,"I haven't seen Bud too much this winter but when we ran into Malinda in the IGA she said the camp was sold but the final closing date hasn't come yet. That was b4 christmas The new owner, if the sale is completed will be Everett Hobs who used to work at the mine and took a buy out (from what I hear) and invested his package into the fishing resort. He is a good guy and loves fishing so I think if you're planning to come to 5 lakes, you will have a great time. He is from Newfoundland originally and as we Canadians know, Newfies are fun loving people."

They (Bud, Malinda and Dakota) are staying in Red Lake and will be operating a Bed and Breakfast there. Sounds like Bud may also be doing some guiding this summer. We'll be in camp again for opening week and will meetin the new owners."
