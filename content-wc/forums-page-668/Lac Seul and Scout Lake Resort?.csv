Does anyone have a safe route with coordinates to the Manitoba Point area and McKenzie Bay area? Or is it best just to wait and talk with the resort owners on routes? I have fished those areas in the past, but not out of Scout Lake Resort. Thank you very much, Anglin Andy"

I travel the route that takes you to South Bay, be careful of going between the wrong islands, and then follow the shorline all the way to Manitoba. I have several routes to all over the area on a map. Send me an email with your address and I will send it to you. [email protected]"

You can run down to Manitoba point and McKenzie Bay if you really want to, however, you will pass over miles of prime water. We go no further than the Bay of Islands and we catch all the walleyes we could ever wish for. It's fun to watch all the boats scream by us headed south and east, it's all so unnecessary to go far on Lac Seul to catch fish. In fact some of the best fishing we have is off the dock at Scout Lake Lodge. The water is about 14 feet deep at the end of their dock and we slip bobber there with a leech. It is a deadly method and we catch a ton of walleyes doing this. My son caught a 28 inch eye last year doing this, we catch too many 22-26 inch eyes doing this to count."
