I have their brochures, but I was wondering if anyone here or anyone you know has been there. I would greatly appreciate the help as this is an option for my wife and I's honeymoon destination and I want to get the best that I can. We want to go in September if that is of any help. Any help that you can give me would be greatly appreciated."
563001,Old Critter,2007-01-26 10:59:00,14,"Check down this board for a similar question with responses. Early September can be a fine time of year for a honeymoon. My advice is to book the nicest place you can afford - a full American Plan place with guide. Figure around $1,000/ea for a four nights/three days of fishing trip."
563004,grt1,2007-01-26 12:14:00,259,"In 1972 when I first came to the great northwestern part of Ontario, from the centre of the known universe (in Canada, that's the Toronto area, in the USA it's New York, just ask anyone who lives there) I had to spend a summer working in the Nestor Falls area. I arranged to have a mobile home moved onto the Lecuyer's camp for the summer. They made me feel right at home and infact they installed a separate trailer site for me so my kids and wife could be safe from the car and trailer traffic of their regular guests. In the years that followed, whenever I needed to overnight in Nestor Falls I would call them for a cabin, they always accommodated me and had a 6 pack of beer in the fridge for me. The current owner is the son of the folks I dealt with, when I was there he was about 9 or 10 (maybe younger) but he really loved to fish and he used to clean a crappie in about 5 seconds. God he was fast with the fillet knife. I haven't been back in years but the camp is in a great location, it doesn't matter how bad the weather gets you can always get out somewhere to fish. I'm sure Dan and his family would welcome you with open arms."
563049,reuben,2007-01-29 08:37:00,2,Thank you. I was hoping for more feedback like yours.
563056,esgrams,2007-01-29 14:41:00,92,"grt1, I love reading stories and memories like yours about the Nestor Falls area, I myself have been going to the area for close to 36 years and I believe the honeymoon individual would be hard pressed to find a truly bad resort in the area, as any of the owners I've met are very down-to-earth people.. Just a sidebar on the Nestor area, Somebody on this board was compiling a book of history about the area and I can't recall who it was, because if he got it done, I'd like a copy.. Thanks Eric"
