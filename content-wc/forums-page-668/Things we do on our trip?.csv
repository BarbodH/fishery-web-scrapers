562937,BD,2007-01-23 02:31:00,739,"I went with a fairly large group (2 houseboats full). We have a $1 big fish of the day contest and a $3 big fish of the week contest (walleyes only). For a seven day trip that only costs $10 each. We also have some prizes donated by various members for biggest pike, second biggest walleye etc. There is also one last ""prize"" for the guy voted the ""worst"" fisherman of the week. It's the beat up old mallard decoy ""he should try duck hunting instead"" traveling trophy. I donated the decoy! ;-)"
562938,lenray,2007-01-23 09:30:00,467,Here is a thing a couple of my buds do from central Michigan --NOT CLARE-- Dug W. SINGS A RENDITION OF MOON OVER MIAMI with special affects. and Jerry R. buys those little women's panties---called CAMO HIPSTERS- and hides them in the dirty laundry of the younger just married guys that go with us.
562944,Guest,2007-01-23 16:35:00,0,"This is pretty fun. 1 week of fishing. $10 per guy. Every walleye over 24"" you get a card. Every pike over 30"" you get a card. Every perch over 12"" you get a card..............you get the point. The sizes will change depending on where your fishing. Best poker hand at the end of the week get the money."
562945,thunderatwork,2007-01-23 17:37:00,79,"lenray,your group sounds fun, however I'm glad i don't fish with you, i can't afford a divorce!!!! And I'm not young or newly married"
562955,Guest,2007-01-24 06:49:00,0,Lenray... About fifteen years ago the group was fishing in Wisconsin. The people in the cabin before us forgot to clean out a drawer and left behind some girls clothes and a bra. The bra ended up in the dirty laundry of the guy who had a 7 month pregnent wife at home. I say it was the best prank ever. He (who got promoted and is now our boss) does not like to hear it mentioned.
562967,Guest,2007-01-24 17:24:00,0,Don't forget to bring some lip-stick and perfume. That's a hard one to explain to the old lady when she goes to wash your favorite fishing shirt.
563013,Guest,2007-01-26 22:39:00,0,"Anybody ever go rock rolling? Find the biggest rock you can find high up on a bluff, and roll it down! Be careful to keep the boats out of the way!!!"
563014,Hammerhead Herb,2007-01-27 00:49:00,259,"We have a flyin where we're the only ones on the lake. The stars in the sky are magnificent. Sooo --- before we leave, I'll go on the net and get a sky chart of the the stars for the GPS location and time that we are at the camp. It's really a great idea if you are taking some young teens up to the camp. It is a night sky that you are not able to see here in N Illinois with all the city lights around."
563100,lenray,2007-01-30 22:34:00,467,ewe would really enjoy fishing with my bud Dug from central Michigan NOT Clare--the stories he tells really Cracks up a group.
556771,Guest,2006-05-01 21:15:00,0,Oban Scotch!!! (nice) We usally have an arts and craft night. We use Items from around the lake and camp to make a wall hanging to dress up the cabins walls. Might be from a small drift rootwad and an old lure found along the lake or a photo from a outdoor life.
556779,IaDave,2006-05-02 07:07:00,476,Is this Vito from the Sopranos?
556781,Guest,2006-05-02 07:55:00,0,"What, you don't have a arts and crafts night on your trip?"
556783,Guest,2006-05-02 08:37:00,0,Hey a pin up out of Outdoor Life or Infisherman what else could a guy want on a cabin wall.
556784,Guest,2006-05-02 09:48:00,0,"How about a wake up alarm from Dad playing ""Billy the singing Bass"" @ 5:00 am.....It's cute the first day, then that's about it."
556830,jigpig50,2006-05-03 12:32:00,9,"We go usually for 7 days. One day during the week we take half a day and have a golf tournament, seriously. One guy designs the course and is the official scorer who comes up with par. The players have 30 min to ""find"" a club, one club only. We use tinfoil for a ball. Let your imagination and creativity run wild.......it has become an absolute blast. We even present the ""Tin Cup"" to the winner, empty beer cans strung together in the shape of a trophy. Lots of beer and money lost on this course."
557455,Guest,2006-05-20 22:44:00,0,"We have printed yellow fishing t-shirts which read ""Chief Catch A FisH"" on the back and the left front chest reads ""Tour De Fish"". We have 2 of them. At the end of each day, a t-shirt is awarded for the biggest walleye and pike. Winners must stand up as long as they can as they continue to consume numerous ""...labatt blues"". Uncle Larry, Pete, Big Jim and Big Ran Fish on!!!!!"
557473,FISHNBOWLJOE,2006-05-21 19:55:00,80,"About the same stuff here. Unofficial $0.25 each boat for first fish of the day. Officially,$1.00 for big fish of the week of each species. We play poker each night til we can't stay awake. We come in a little earlier on Friday, clean fish and get cleaned up ourselves. Then we go to town for a steak dinner. The winner of poker for the week usually gets stuck with the bill. :) Joe PS The newest guy on the trip is the clean-up guy. Dishes, sweep the cabin etc... I was the new guy for three years straight."
557530,Guest,2006-05-23 08:00:00,0,And is this is the year Big Ran gets the jersey????? Fish on AND Game On!!!
558077,Guest,2006-06-05 11:55:00,0,"We all made it back alive from our fishing trip. We did the smallest fish for walleye/northern. The winners was a 10.5 inches walleye and northern. Sure was funny to be looking for small fish also. Fishing was great all week, except for the 2 days of storm."
556636,wildduck223,2006-04-27 10:44:00,38,"We have a day during the week that we all( 11 of us) fish with a Mickey mouse/Snoopy/Bug Bunny pole for biggest fish. We have done this for 3 year now, biggest fish so far has been a 32 inches northern. It a great time to see grown up fishing this way. What do you do that is different?"
556638,Frankm,2006-04-27 11:19:00,154,"We bought a couple cheap fishing trophies. One for Walleye and one for Pike. We bring one of those small message recorders and throughout the day we record ""Frank 17 inch Walleye"" each day we record total inches. The winners get to display the trophy for the year. It's pretty neat at the end of the week to see all the fish we've caught. I love Snoopy pole idea thats great."
556642,Guest,2006-04-27 12:34:00,0,Co-workers had a homemade lure contest. Winner was someone used just a basic soup spoon with a couple split rings in it and a treble. Caught a large northern with it. Other lures that caught fish were plastic Batman doll with a wire leader attached to it with a treble hook and a rubber ducky.
556672,Tyee Guy,2006-04-27 18:32:00,717,"One of my fishing buddies, and also my dentist made a lure out of an old upper plate with treble hooks on the end and a wire leader through the middle. He actually caught a 16# northern on a fly in trip with it!!!!!! Cost me a fine bottle of Oban scotch....My favorite!!!!!!!"
556678,sidewinder,2006-04-27 23:22:00,96,My youngest son was fishing with snoopy pole and had a northern on bigger than the pole.Reel had no drag which ended up no fish as soon as he saw boatMy buddy's son made a beer bottle cap spinner that worked pretty good sidewinder
556712,FlyBoy,2006-04-29 15:19:00,631,"Every day we do the First-Biggest-Most bet ($1 for each). In each boat. The most it can cost you is $3 a day, but the razzing we give each other makes it worth the trouble. -John"
556716,Guest,2006-04-29 22:55:00,0,"We have a $1/man/day on the big northern and same for the daily big walleye, and $1 for the big walleye of the week, $1 for the big northern of the week, and we have a ""team bait,"" a spoon that one of the fellows makes/buys and gives to each of us - $1 on the big northern of the week and $1 on the big walleye of the week for the team bait as well. Contest lasts Monday through Friday, so it costs each guy $14 to buy into the game. Lots of fun. The young boys (my son included) seem to skin us most years.... John"
556722,VMS,2006-04-30 08:31:00,1103,"On our Manitoba trip we play high stakes in each boat-$0.25 each for the first fish, biggest fish, and most ""stick"" fish (stick fish being 75cm or larger for northerns, 55cm for walleye). But, the captain of the boat makes the rules. So...I'll shift it a bit and make the high stakes for the smallist stick fish, the smallest fish, the least amount, the last fish off of a spot, etc. Funny to watch a bunch of guys measuring the small fish. Steve"
556750,wildduck223,2006-05-01 12:04:00,38,"VMS, I like that one. The smallest fish for the week, I bet that is funny watching them do that."
556757,stumcfar,2006-05-01 14:51:00,451,"We have a hat made ""2006 Biggest Walleye, Lac Seul"" or whatever and that is given out the last night of our trip. We also have a pair of boxer shorts that say ""Big Honker"" on the back-side that has to be worn over your pants or shorts by the big fish leader each day. It is kind of like the Tour de France and the yellow jersey."
