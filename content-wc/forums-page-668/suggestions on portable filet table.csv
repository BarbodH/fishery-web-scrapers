It's aluminum, so it's very solid and light. Could you see yourself using this? What additional features would be good? I'm just helping a friend develop it.http://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b2...lettable11.jpghttp://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b2...lettable22.jpg"
563137,Rat,2007-02-01 11:40:00,102,Neat idea. Add something to hold a plastic bag open to receive fish guts.
563140,VMS,2007-02-01 12:57:00,1103,I'd hate to hit my blade on it. I would assume you'd put a board down on top of it? I like the idea though...portable and looks to be nice and stable for doing the job... Steve
563141,River_eye,2007-02-01 13:31:00,1486,"That was my thought at first, that I didn't want to cut on a metal surface. He said that Aluminum was incredibly soft and shouldn't dull your blade much, but I'm not so sure. I suggested maybe screwing plastic cutting sheet material on top."
563145,rpieske,2007-02-01 16:14:00,1276,Replace the aluminum top with white board. It is available in large sheets or smaller sheets. This is the stuff used on fishing boats for bait stations. Good stuff.
563146,Mohleye,2007-02-01 16:48:00,368,"I agree. The top should be something other than aluminum. Not only because of dulling blades, but I think the aluminum would get too slippery during use."
563149,BIGHILLBILLY,2007-02-02 02:39:00,35,I agree! Good looking design but I would put a cutting board on top. The al. will get to slippery with fish slime and I wouldn't want my blade running into it. Also a device to hold open a bag for guts would be nice!
563153,Crappie Kid,2007-02-02 10:51:00,1581,What size is it?
