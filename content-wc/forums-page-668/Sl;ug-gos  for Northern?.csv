Water clear, some times I can see the fish.Do very well,on other lures but want to catch them on just soft baits. I want to start out with Slug- gos. Need tips. Colors (Alwife?) size, top water? weighted? Won't think you would need stinger would you? Would appreciate some experienced advice. Thanks, Fred"
563041,dutchboy,2007-01-28 20:20:00,5717,Any color will work as long as it's white!:rock-on: You won't need a stringer as I'm sure you will only want to keep one a day to eat.

I have used Shad tail plastics, 8"", on Esox Cobra jigs. Early in the year I like to sight fish and will cast well beyond the pike I see, then slowly work it past the pike. I find slow is better in spring. If you toss it right at a pike.. more often than not, they will swim off. That same shad tail can be rigged with no weight. Just enough from a couple hooks to let it slowly sink. That is a fun tactic also. Other things with plastics. I have used a plastic lizard, no weight, just like fishing for bass. The slow sink with the undelating tail and legs really gets them going. Reaper tails on the Esox Cobra jigs work well too. Sometimes when you get the jig in front of the pike, just let it sit. I have done that before where it has sat there for 5 minutes or more, before the pike took an interest. Plastics and pike can be a lot of fun.
