562835,Guest,2007-01-16 21:52:00,0,Which map should I get for Lowrance LCX 17m. I want one that gives good detail of Lake of the Woods. I have a cottage on the lake and this is where I do all my fishing. Thanks.
562839,PJM,2007-01-17 00:00:00,3516,"Eatmore The two I would look at are Navionics or LakeMaster. I have the Navionics and they work just fine. LakeMaster is making or has one of the lake. I was up on Lake of the Woods in October of 2006 and saw a guy driving around in a hoover craft type boat and it said LakeMaster on it, so I would bet they have one......"

562893,Guest,2007-01-19 16:33:00,0,"Just make sure you get the ""gold"" version of the navionics. A few guys have the premium and dont like it at all."
562897,joro2548,2007-01-19 18:35:00,14,"Eatmore It depends on what part of LOTW you want to fish. LakeMaster hotspots has a detailed map of the SW part of the lake available now. However, as already mentioned, they did graph the entire lake last summer and that map will be available before the open water season starts this spring. Navionics had the 182S map previously but that chip has been recalled from thier dealers because of problems. That was on the Great lakes chip which showed the lake in five foot intervals. The LakeMaster chip will show one foot intervals. I have the 182S chip but will be glad to upgrade to the LakeMaster chip and get the one foot lines. Good fishing"
562903,Guest,2007-01-20 09:30:00,0,I'm on the north end of the lake close to Kenora. Thanks for the info.
562924,bob888,2007-01-22 08:01:00,244,I have the 182S chip for LOW. Do you happen to know why the chip was recalled from the dealers? Thanks
563053,joro2548,2007-01-29 12:27:00,14,"Bob, The people at Gander Mnt told me the reason for the chip recall had something to do with the fact that they had trouble working on some of the newer GPS units. That is all I know. I just got back from a week on LOW and the 182S gold chip worked great on my 522c Lowrance. John"
