562496,Guest,2006-12-30 08:59:00,0,Any experience with a good restaurant in the Geraldton area. We fly out of Nakina but no good place to eat. Thanks
562498,Guest,2006-12-30 10:30:00,0,"I own a drive to lodge east of Longlac. The only place I have tried eating at in Geraldton was a place I think was called Sizzler... not the chain place, just a family owned diner. It has been up for sale for a bit, so don't even know if its in business. One thing that I usually do, is order breakfast. They tend to do better cooking breakfast than dinners. Good luck, and have a good trip in 07! Greg"

The past 6 or seven years we have been going to Quebec for the annual trip North. We primarily fish for walleyes with pike as a bonus catch. We are considering a second trip this year to Ontario. Please email or post information on your lodge. [email protected] Thank you"
562502,Slick Willy,2006-12-30 13:35:00,36,Sizzlers is a good bet - right on the main street through town. Look for the police station - it's across the street.
562510,Mr Ranger,2006-12-31 10:33:00,272,I will second that one. Not sure of the name but remebered it is across from the police station. Usually a pretty busy place and food has been good. No where else to go that I am aware of.
563032,Guest,2007-01-28 13:01:00,0,"dave, last time in nakina there was a place on cordingly lake i think.
