Have fished many of the lakes in the area. The camp looks clean and is right off the main highway. It is located on the English river, and I believe a boat ride will be required to reach more open water. With the water low last September when I went through last there was a lot of scary looking rocks all through the channel up and down from the camp. Other than that I can't offer anything else. good luck GF"
