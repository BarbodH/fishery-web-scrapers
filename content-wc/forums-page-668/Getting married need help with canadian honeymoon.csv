All I can say is this year we are going back for our 7th anniversary. She loves the place. They treat you right and you can't ask for better service. Nice place, clean, good equipment, good fishing, great food. I think for what you get in their packages, you'd be hard pressed to find a better all inclusive deal anywhere. Send me a note if you'd like more info. We are going back over the 4th of July with another couple and friend."

562887,mabfish,2007-01-19 11:06:00,9,"Well fellas, I am pleased to announce that after 8 years of divorced single dad life, God has seen fit to send me a great woman that has agreed to marry me, despite my fishing and boating addictions! Here is the great thing, prior to meeting me, she had never been in a boat, let alone fish before, and now she is quickly becoming a junkie like me. I took her and the boys to Lac De Milles Lac last summer and we had a blast, but the resorts in that area are ""spartan"" if you know what I mean. She is such a wonderful woman, when faced with the honeymoon location decision, we examined beaches, Europe, pretty much all over, and our final choice was a quite northern cabin on a lake. Obviously I am very optimistic about this marriage! But here is where I need some help from the Walleye Central Brotherhood. I have only been to Canada a few times, and the focus was fishing, fellowship and commraderie with family and freinds. Accomodations were not real important on these trips. Clearly, this trip is very different. We would like to find a very nice cabin, that is in a private setting. Some place that is nice to be at, and we can go out and catch a few walleyes when the mood strikes us. The fishing is not as important as the setting and the location. We are in Northeast wisconsin, and we are looking for an easy day drive from Appleton. The Wedding is on the weekend of May 19th this year, so we need to make plans soon. I look forward to all of your helpful input, and thanks in advance. I sure like being a part of our little community of good men and women that help each other with our outdoor passions. MaB aka ""fish"""

562892,Old Critter,2007-01-19 16:16:00,14,"I'm a newbie to this board, but saw your inquiry and thought I'd give you my $.02. Thirty-five years ago I honeymooned at Spruce Island Camp on Lake of the Woods. Had a great trip and we're still hitched. Another place is New Moon Lodge on LOW. You'll not be disappointed there. Both places are on islands and the jump-off spot is Morson - NW of FF. I know New Moon has a website and perhaps Spruce Island too. Congratulations."
562894,Guest,2007-01-19 16:34:00,0,"No matter where you go take the Honeymoon before you get married. Seriously...Congradulations and no matter where you go may it be the beginning of a long and loving relationship....thank God she likes to fish. By the way, What kind of a boat does she own????"
562895,LeeHawk,2007-01-19 16:40:00,12,"Sleepy Dog Camp on Wabaskang Lake in Northern Ontario has a ""honeymoon cabin"" and is a great, quiet spot, wonderful owner, and good early season walleye fishing. Many happy returns!"
562901,Guest,2007-01-20 08:34:00,0,"Go somewhere warm,, could be awfully chilly at that time of year."
562906,Guest,2007-01-20 09:43:00,0,"Canada is great, but May 19 is still early unless you like cold weather. Weather that far north is still very unstable at that time of year. It could be 70 degrees or it could be 40 and raining everyday. Don't spoil your chances with getting her hooked on fishing while your freezing your cans off. Maui in May would be more memorable and you could take her deep sea fishing for a day. May is a slow time in Hawaii so you could probably find some good deals. Just looking out for you. Good luck and congratulations!"
562912,Guest,2007-01-21 10:10:00,0,"I see 2 Honeymoons here. You are a lucky man that she likes to fish, Don't blow that on lousy weather"
562927,jigman 2003,2007-01-22 12:31:00,981,"I'd have to agree with earlier posters. That is too early for me to take a honeymoon in Canada. If you wanted to wait a month or six weeks, that would be better. I know my wife would not enjoy sitting in a boat for a week while enduring 25-45 degree temps with rain and snow. Maybe your new wife is more equipped for that type of weather. Go to Jamaica and do some fishing there. Then go to Canada later in the summer ;-)"
562948,Guest,2007-01-23 19:27:00,0,Since you are getting a lot of advise not to do it I will tell you it can be done. Twenty four years ago this May we went on our honeymoon to Eagle lake for the walleye opener. The night we arrived the wind was blowing so hard the curtains in our log cabin were horizontal. I didn't think she would last but we put some extra blankets on the bed and survived the night. Woke up the next morning with a woodchuck staring at us through a hole in the floor. She took it all in stride and as the week went on the temperatures got in the mid 70's during the day. The evenings were cool for fishing but the fishing made up for it. It ended up that their was another couple on their honeymoon there also along with an older couple that we became friendly with. It was a great trip that I would not trade for anything. Took her to a nice hotel for a night on the way up and back and did some other sightseeing on the way to complete the trip. So go for it if you like. Would not recomend this place for a honeymoon but I now go to Lake of the Woods and there are some nice places in the Morson area. I have not been to Duck Bay Lodge but offer a couples cabin and the people I know that have gone there say it is first rate. Good luck and congrats to you. 24 years and going strong.
