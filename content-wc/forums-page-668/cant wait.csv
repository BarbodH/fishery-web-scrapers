563023,Guest,2007-01-27 21:13:00,0,I was thinking about our trip to saschatchawan in august. I always looked forward to out trip to lake of the woods even though we had been there a million times. Now to tobin lake I hope i am not dissapointed with the expectations that I bring from lake of the woods and the nice lodges we stayed at there. Just thinking.
563036,grt1,2007-01-28 16:01:00,259,I used to duck hunt in Sask. for years and only quit going when my hunting partner passed away. You will love the friendliness of the folks in that province. They are always glad to see you and make you feel at home.

563051,Guest,2007-01-29 11:07:00,0,hi and thanks for the responses. what other good lake will i pass by? this will my first time up there. why are there so few resorts up there? is it that the folks in the west dont drive north to fish like the midwesterners? that and there are a lot fewer folks out here than in the midwerst?
563102,DaveD,2007-01-31 01:29:00,57,What border crossing and highways will you be travelling?
563118,Guest,2007-01-31 14:19:00,0,"Hi. I think we will be coming up 15 all the way to the border and get on 4 to lethbridge and then over on 1. i will have to do a mapquest to see if there is a shorter way, maybe accross montana and up highway 16. its a long trip either way so i hope its worth it."

563127,Guest,2007-01-31 22:18:00,0,Hi. we will be heading up in august for a couple of weeks. have to get away from the dry heat of las vegas.
563129,mrwalleye5,2007-01-31 22:51:00,1922,That will be an excellent time to go. I believe the Premier Cup is the second weekend. Gets a little busy then but still quite fishable. Good luck and get those Lindy rigs and leeches warmed up. W5
