Hear they had a real record walleye come out of there in the past year or so - maybe provincial or country record ? . I hear alot of folks talking about either going there or wanting to. I haven't researched it much, so don't know the camps there. Looks to be pretty big water . Place I am inquiring about is on lake Attitti, which is just into Saskatchewan from Manitoba, west of Flin Flon. Haven't been there yet so can't say much about it. good luck V."
