510380,Guest,2000-12-26 09:31:00,0,I am considering a fly-in trip to Viking Outpost camps out of Red Lake sometime in late August or early September. The two lakes we are considering are Critchell or Dolphin Lake. Has anyone out there been to either one of these lakes? Just wondering how they were. Any info would be appreciated.

McInnes River runs in and out of this lake over three beautiful waterfalls. One of our most scenic locations, Critchell offers excellent walleye and northern fishing and access to lake trout. There are three small portage lakes to explore, including McInnes Lake. Situated on a rocky point, the two bedroom cabin offers a good view of the lake. It sleeps 4 to 6 people and is the only one on the lake. Have your shore lunch by the waterfalls.""And Dolphin:Our regular guests know this location as the Walleye Factory. Dolphin Lake is 71 air miles north of Red Lake just south of McInnes Lake. Northerns are also found in abundance. You may wish to portage to McInnes or try the other portage lake. Dolphin Lake is L-shaped, shallow and sheltered from the wind. The outpost is the only one on the lake and is located on the corner of the L. This two bedroom cabin sleeps 4 to 6 people comfortably. Fish on a sheltered Lake.""River eye"
510384,Guest,2001-01-28 12:32:00,0,"I went to Dolphin lake with five other guys in '96. The walleye fishing was pretty much non-stop. We were there the third week of July. The weather was good only one day of rain. The temps were in the 60's and 70's all week. One of the guys and myself portaged to McInnis one morning so he could go after a laker, he was successful. He trolled for about one our, then boom! Back to Dolphin Lake, the largest walleyes we caught were 23"" the northern don't get to big. If you want to catch walleyes like they were panfish this is a great lake to choose. There is a large island for shore lunches and the fishing around that island was excellent. Good luck on your trip. Ken Baumann Carpentersville, IL"
