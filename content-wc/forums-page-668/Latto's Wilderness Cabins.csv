Just nice folks who seem to be very honest and customer driven. Nothing flashy or pretentious about thier operation, it just works. The Norsman could use a coat of paint though! Pooch"
563031,FishnBear,2007-01-28 10:50:00,36,I was with a group that used them in Sept. of 2005. The plane was a few hours late to pick us up. They said it was due to weather issuses on another lake that the plane went too. I believed them they seemed honest and every thing went good.
563039,fishman,2007-01-28 18:58:00,60,Our group has been using Art Latto for at least 5 or more years. Nothing fancy but good people. We usually do the camp thing in Ghost Lake but have stayed in the St. Raphael cabin once. Very nice for an out post.

563083,NAV165,2007-01-30 13:08:00,412,"A group of 8 stayed on St Raphael last year just after the 4th of July. The camp is very nice for an outpost. Some things need to be repaired or replaced but all in all pretty nice for an outpost. I was surprised it had a shower with heated water! The fishing was good, nothing real big but plenty of fish. It sure is fun to spend a few days on a lake that large without seeing anyone other than those you are with. Even with the large lake it's long and narrow wind was never really a problem. Fishing seemed to be better the further from the camp we got. Nice folks, they even stayed by us for a night to tidy up and do some fishing. I'd use them again. If you are interested I has some pictures I could send."
