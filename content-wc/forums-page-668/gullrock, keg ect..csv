If you use the search feature, you'll probably find all the info you could want. As far as what part of the lake most of the fishing is done, Gull Rock is kind of a big, round lake, and there are good, popular spots in all directions, as well as lots of areas to explore and find your own spots."

I'm sure if you google any of those names, you can find out everything you need to know."

If you are trying to pick a camp dure to areas fished, it will not really matter. Wind will be a factor, and throughout the week you could be in 4 or 5 different spots on the lake (or lakes). No matter which camp you stay at, you will be able to catch fish near your camp - so don't worry about that. All of the owners will tell you the best fishing is right by their camp . . . and they will be right! But if you get a consistent wind in a direction, it would really pay off it to fish the area it is blowing into (even if you have to go several miles via water), just make sure you wear your rain gear for the ride back if you are bucking big waves! The camps are all located on the western side of the lake in some fashion or another."
