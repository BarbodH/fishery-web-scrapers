For the hot trip (air was upper 70's and calm water surface was 70F), the black flies were biting quite well. The mosquitos were not bad. I bring a winter parka when I go that far north in June, so in May, expect snow, hope for 50's-60's. Deet is mandatory.http://www.weatheroffice.gc.ca/saiso...html#forecastshttp://www.theweathernetwork.com/fourteenday/caon0470"
