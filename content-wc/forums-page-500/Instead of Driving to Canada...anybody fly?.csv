And then back again on Sunday night, it can literally be almost bumper to bumper for the entire 120 miles. Like others have said, it's a short commute."
1284917,Jiggy06,2011-03-21 12:07:00,7,My group flies into Winnipeg and our outfitter has a limo waiting to pick us up to take us out to the seaplane base. Then we depart at 5:30 am the next morning and we are fishing by 8:30 after breakfast. I always use the website www.kayak.com to find a ticket because it compares all the other discount sites at once. Usually 3-500 out of MSP.
1284938,wolverine fan,2011-03-21 12:59:00,71,"I have been flying into winnipeg for 12-15 years now. Its about a 3 hr trip to minaki from there but its broken up by a food/beer stop in kenora, really convenient. If flying into winnipeg heres a few tips i/we have learned over the years.- Check ahead with the car rental co because one year when we told them we were driving into ontario they charged for mileage because we didnt stay in manitoba.- be sure to study a map before hand or pick one up at the rental counter because you can easily waste an hour taking the wrong way around the perimeter highway or be caught in downtown traffic.- found out two years ago that the charges for the oversize rod holder i had was almost the amount of the ticket itself!! better to get a pack rod if you can. I got one from cabelas and really liked it.- we used enterprise rental one year because we stayed the night before take off and they picked the car up from the airport without us returning it to the offsite place and that was really helpful.-one year we rented a 15 passenger van and upon arrival the company said i had to have a different type of license since it had that many people, luckily i told them that in the u.s. a west virginia license automatically includes that!! oh well i was goin fishin dang it!"
1285261,Aaron-IN,2011-03-22 07:03:00,500,"I agree with Husky Boy. I've done it all kinds of ways and flying directly into Winnipeg is the way to go. No hassle at the boarder in Int. Falls, a very easy drive East to the LOTW area."
1285459,muskyhunter34,2011-03-22 13:29:00,227,"****, that's pocket change...LOL"
1280115,walleye4life,2011-03-09 10:24:00,54,"If you don't want to drive but want to fly.... and can't afford it... then don't go. Flying is always going to be more expensive you are paying for convenience. tens of thousands of people fly to winnipeg, ifalls, and tbay every year to go on their fishing trip... it costs more. period."
1280161,SinOrSwim,2011-03-09 12:45:00,1528,"I looked into this a year or two ago. There is a group of us that start in Central Iowa and then pick up the rest of the group just north of the twin cities. When we fly back in from out trip, we then drive all the way home. It makes for a very very long day. So, I looked into a charter flight from Ankeny, Ia to I-Falls/Fort Frances. Let teh group pick us up. Yeahh....not going to happen. lol It was like $9000.00 per flight. If we were going up and coming back the same day it would only be 9k. But, to come up was 9k and then for them to pick us up was 9k. In addition, it our fly out plane was delayed there was no guarantee the charter flight would be there when we finally arrived from our cabin. If they had to fly back it was another 9k to come get us."
1280177,tv4fish,2011-03-09 13:33:00,2694,SinOrSwim: Tell you what For $9K -- I'll drive down and pick you guys up and deliver you to Fort Frances -- heck - I won't even charge for the first bag you check
1280196,Glenman12,2011-03-09 14:36:00,762,I'll do it for $8K
1280199,Mohleye,2011-03-09 14:43:00,368,"The original poster is from Aurora IL. I think the realistic answer is that chartering a flight to and from Kenora is going to be terribly expensive for a group that is used to driving. Flying commercial to Winnipeg creates a lot of additional logistics, and driving from Aurora to somewhere in Canada where you can catch a train will probably mean 12 hours of driving just to reach a depot, which doesn't accomplish anything as far as cutting down on the driving. The best option is to convince your group to leave bright and early Friday morning, drive as far as you want to to split the trip up so that you can arrive at your camp when you want to on Saturday (assuming you are staying Sat-Sat). For our group this means driving to Dryden. This gets the border crossing out of the way at non-peak time, gets the majority of the driving done the first day, gets us there early enough to have something decent for dinner, a couple beers, and a good night's sleep. It also gets us across the border early enough to take care of stops at the liquor and beer store in Ft Frances and get our licenses bought. Depending on where you are going and when you want to arrive, Ft Frances, Emo, or somewhere in N MN might work better. We really like getting the border crossing out of the way though. We stop every 2 or 3 hours to switch drivers, and just get out and stretch. The difference between this and driving 15 hours straight, which we used to do, is like night and day. We do drive straight through on the way home, but like someone else said, the day is coming when we will split that up too."
1280252,Fishoil,2011-03-09 16:34:00,1277,"If one of you owns a motorhome or you want to rent one it would certainly make the drive more comfortable. You'd be able to get up and walk around while traveling, have an onboard bathroom, and all the other things that come with a motorhome."
1280991,FishTwentyFourSeven,2011-03-11 09:05:00,38,"I spoke with a few charters and the costs were anywhere from $12,500 - $19000 round trip. It sure would be nice but I am pretty sure we will be driving again. I looked into a train from Illinois and couldn't find anything. I inquired about having a charter bus and got a quote of $3000. We might as well fly commercial. Commercial flights are $700 to Winnipeg and then we have to worry about getting from Winnipeg to Kenora and back. Commerical flights to Int. Falls are $400 and then a van to take us the rest of the way will be $250 each way. Looks like it will be the same mode of transportation for us in 2011. Drive up, stay in Kenora, and fly in the next morning. Honestly, the drive-up is not all that bad. Coming back...that is another story! Thanks for all your input guys."
1281307,fishforlife,2011-03-12 02:20:00,77,"Hey guys, get real. When we all signed up for these trips, we knew all of the issues associated with the adventure after the first trip. You can add or subtract things to or from your trip to enhance the experience depending on each individuals budget and according to economic conditions, but one thing will remain if you are truly committed to the true northern experience and that is that you will go the easiest and most economic way you can, ""But You WILL Go"" if you truly loved the first experience you had. So don't sweat the small stuff and just go any way you can. Enjoy the time you can with the people you love, no matter how you have to get there.FISHFORLIFE"
1281331,tv4fish,2011-03-12 05:49:00,2694,I was with you up until that last comment Is it OK if I just really LIKE my 2 buddies????
1281356,elway12,2011-03-12 07:00:00,335,"This is always a question that we ask ourselves each year as we travel to god's country to fish. My group lives in AZ so to start we cannot drive the whole way realistically. As a matter of fact I don't even know how many hours that would be?! But even though we fly from AZ to Minneapolis we still have a 12 hour drive. We break it up into 2 days and it is not so bad especially the drive up 61. We have looked into flying into Duluth, T.B., Int. Falls but Delta owns most of the flight services through those places thus the cost of flying into those smaller airports is just WAY over priced! Plus with the new baggage fees it just won't happen unless you have serious dough. In addition, we would still have to pay for a rental car and drive some. We would love to cut down on the time spent on driving, gas, and hotel but it just doesn't seem to work for us financially. But I do play the lottery so ??"
1279774,Husky Boy,2011-03-08 17:57:00,8,"Fly to Winnipeg, MB, than rent a car or truck to Kenora. It's only a two hour drive to Lake of the Woods. Super 8 in Kenora is the best stay for the buck. I do the drive twice a week. Not a big deal. You can likely get a good deal on a flight. Winnipeg is a major center and cheaper to fly to than Kenora or Thunder Bay. Once you here, you have your choice of fishing. 14 lb Walleye one hour north. 20 lb Lake Trout 2 hours East, 20 LB Pike just about anywhere. Crappie, Whitefish, Rainbow Trout, you name it. Come on up, eh!"
1279781,FishTwentyFourSeven,2011-03-08 18:04:00,38,"I have been getting quotes of 13,000 - 18,000k for a charter flight...yikes! We have tried every way to get up there too. We have found the best is splitting it up but we have a couple guys in our group that don't want to pay for the hotel...ugh! I will check out the idea of flying into Int. Falls and getting a bus from there. That might work too. Thanks for all the suggestions."
1279790,tackleman,2011-03-08 18:15:00,444,"If you are planning a trip to the Red Lake area, call Karen at Red Lake Travel 807-727-2742.She arranges several of these trips every year and can give you some fairly accurate prices to help in your decision"
1279797,Fishin Fun,2011-03-08 18:24:00,218,This last year we just started splitting our trip. It takes about 12-13 hours so we decided to drive part way up after work the night before so that way we could get up fishing at a decent time the following day.
1279798,Husky Boy,2011-03-08 18:25:00,8,"How many thousand dollars to fly??????We fly to Chicago for $700. Cheaper on seat sales. Why Charter a plane. Thats only for rich folks. Air Canada, Delta, Northwest, American..take your pick. I can't imagine it being that much more expensive for a 'Merican to fly to Canada. Lets do some math:Flight - $800Hotel 5 nights - $600Food 5 days - $300Rental Truck - $300Incidentals - $300Total stay for the week - $2300."
1279808,FishTwentyFourSeven,2011-03-08 18:50:00,38,"The only issue with the $700 fights is we have to be the airport two hours early, flying takes 2.5hrs, those flights do not go into Kenora but only go into Winnipeg, then 1.5 - 2 hours to get into Kenora. Then we have to pay to ge to Kenora there and to Winnipeg on they way back and we'd still need to get a hotel. It is still quicker than driving but is still a lot of $$$ for the time. I was checking out charters because we won't have to drive to Chicago to catch a commercial flight and can fly direct into Kenora. With the cost it is waaay out of the question though. Anybody ever take a train? I am exlploring all options..."
1279842,Husky Boy,2011-03-08 20:02:00,8,"The ride to Kenora from Wpg is not a big deal. I do it every weekend, sometimes twice. Hotel is clean and cheap. Heck, look me up, and I'll guide you.....for free...at least for the weekend. There is always 14 pound Walleye just one hour north of Winnipeg. I can catch 40 walleye per day right now, and it only gets better. Average size is three pound fish. A guy can normally ice at least one eight to ten pounder per day. Mid to end of March is best for Lake Winnipeg. Above freezing temps, sun burns all around, and easy drive on access...and big city to come back to at the end of the day."
1280038,camp chef,2011-03-09 07:50:00,915,If your guys don't want to pony up for a motel room how in the world are you going to get them to charter an airplane?
1280044,Golden Eagle,2011-03-09 08:05:00,2642,"Driving is better. 1465 miles one way for me and I do it, alone, once or twice every year."
1280112,Seanik,2011-03-09 10:22:00,218,"Our group also got tired of the long hours on the road, we now take the train. Check out ""Via Rail"", the Toronto to Vancouver train stops at many stations in Western, Ontario and it has a dinning car, a club car and is a very comfortable way to travel. Seanik"
1279554,FishTwentyFourSeven,2011-03-08 10:09:00,38,We are getting older and 15 hours is a little much time to be trapped in a vehicle. Has anybody looked into private planes that fly into Kenora or any other smaller airports in Canada? Any idea of cost? Thank you in advance for your response.
1279559,Mike Kansas,2011-03-08 10:17:00,1463,We have flown into International Falls via commercial flights and rented vans at the airport. Seems like the flight was about $600 from Kansas City but that has been a couple years ago. Mike Kansas
1279576,walleye4life,2011-03-08 10:44:00,54,"Flying commercially into I Falls, Winnipeg, or Thunder Bay and renting a car is your best bet. If you have the $$$ pick an operation that will pick you up at the airport or fly out of the same town there is commercial air service."
1279583,Glenman12,2011-03-08 11:11:00,762,"That has been discussed but only of few in our group of 8 could afford that..but yeah, that 15 hour ride up and back is getting longer for the 3 greybeards in our group and Im one of them.."
1279590,Fishoil,2011-03-08 11:22:00,1277,"A few years ago our group was in the same predicament. Our solution was to split the drive up into 2 days. It makes it much easier and we're at a hotel on the way up just in time for cocktail hour and fish stories - a very relaxing first night. We still drive straight through on the way home, but I suspect that will be changing to a 2 day ride in the next several years also."
1279629,camp chef,2011-03-08 12:37:00,915,We wouldn't consider driving straight through anymore. Yes a nice dinner and cocktails on the way up sure makes the rest of the drive (day 2) a lot more enjoyable.The trip home has also now turned into a 2 day trip.
1279630,joeman79,2011-03-08 12:37:00,417,"Another thing you could do is fly to Int'L Falls and use a Taxi service. I checked it out last year and for 10 guys to shuttle us back and forth to Lac Seul it was only like 325.00. I have the name of the company somewhere but can not find it. But if you google shuttle or taxi service Int'L Falls it will come up. None of us flew we figured we could endure the drive and not spend 6400.00 on flights. And we figured that by the time you drove to airport which for us is 3 hrs away and arrive 2hrs prior to flight, lay over 2-3 hours and arrive at 4 p.m. We would almost be able to drive and arrive within 2 or 3 hours of flying there. Some friends of mine fly to Int'l Falls and fly out of Ft Frances which works great for them."
1279646,Glenman12,2011-03-08 13:17:00,762,"We've gone up just about everyway you can...back in the day it was leave the Chicago area about 6:00 on Fri night and drive straight thru..then when the sons started going and they were too young to split the driving it was Fri night in Ft Frances..and thats what me did for the majority of the trips...that worked out well until we started getting the 2 hour waits in line at the border coming home..for the last 3 years now we have left to go up about 4:30AM on Fri..we drive straight thru and get to the dock around 6:30PM..our lodge owner lets us into our cabin a half a day early..one year we actually got in about 2 1/2 hours of fishing on Friday evening..coming home, instead of leaving early Friday morning, we leave about 5:00PM on Thurs..we drive to the border and spend the night in Int Falls and then finish the trip home the next morning..so far that has worked out well for us.."
1279701,NARDA 1,2011-03-08 15:50:00,636,"Our group used to drive all the way through from Elgin, IL to Eagle Lake. Leaving at 3am and arriving at 5pm. Last year we split it into a 2 day trip, stopping at the Super 8 in Superior WI with dinner and drinks at Gronks bar and grill (great place) then finishing the trip the next day. This worked out so well that we will do it again this year. It was nice to arrive at the lake not all worn out from driving. Flying seems way to expensive and then you would have to worry about your tackle and gear."
1279714,Rlcrouse,2011-03-08 16:14:00,286,"I believe the charter wanted $10,000 round trip from DSM, IA to Ear Falls for six guys. That was a couple of years ago."
