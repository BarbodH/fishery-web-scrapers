565081,Guest,2007-05-08 19:02:00,0,"I know the place pretty well, my grandfather bought it from Ben Russell in the late 70's. He passed on in 1980 and we inherited the estate. I spent every summer from 80 to 85 working at the camp. The lake is small but has good walleye,perch, and bass fishing. You have to fish the lake a little different because it is generally shallow. Lots of big pike, my uncle has 5 on the wall from Florence. Same spot with the same lure. The cabins are rustic but clean and the hosts are very nice people. This camp is truly one of my most favorite places in the world because it is where I grew up and met so many nice people from the midwest. Email me at [email protected] if you would like more information on the camp/lake."

564371,Guest,2007-04-08 09:28:00,0,Does anyone have any knowledge about this camp and lake. Looks very reasonable pricewise and it is the only camp on the lake.
564372,Guest,2007-04-08 10:42:00,0,"i have checked into this resort as well but have never gone.i know the lake is small with walleye, pike, smallies??, and they tout their perch fishing. they do have some boats on other lakes as well. if you go, you are still in canada, so it cant be that bad, right?? have talked to the owners and they seemed real nice and enthused about their camp.they have a website through the sunset country map you get at the all canada shows. if you go give us a report. jig out"
564373,Guest,2007-04-08 11:27:00,0,I won't go this year and probably not until I retire and take two trips or more a year. i fish Lac Seul and hard to beat that fishing. Just wondered about this camp. Very reasonably priced.
564375,Trailerguy,2007-04-08 17:55:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]The folks that own Skyline also bought Dutchies Store a couple of years ago. They are very personable and hard working. I've been told the camp is adequate but not fancy, and I've never fished the lake. There are plenty of quality lakes close by including Lac Suel. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"

564417,Guest,2007-04-10 16:36:00,0,"I know quite a bit about Skyline Lodge and Florence lake. Skyline Lodge used to be owned by my neighbors Father when I was growing up. Then it was called Snoka's Skyline Lodge. After Herb died then my neighbors became part owners with the rest of the family until they sold out to Hron's. The first time I ever fished Florence was in 1985 or 1986 (it was the first year that it wasn't in my neighbors family), I think I was in 7th grade, can't quite remember. I do remember how excited I was to finally get to go to Canada for the first time after hearing about it from my neighbors (and their son who was my best friend). Well, enough reminiscing, I am sure you want to hear about the lake. Florence is a mostly round couple thousand acre lake. It is stained water with lots of weed beds and I believe only 1 island. Years ago it was a fantastic walleye and northern lake. I am not for sure now. Florence has a good population of perch too. I have only caught one smallie out of it, but never fished for them. This lake gives out some nice pike. My neighbors always caught at least one over 15 lbs every year on their week long trip. I believe when my neighbors had the lodge, the lake record was 28 lbs. The small bay right around the corner from camp, and the weed beds at the far end of the lake from camp usually hold good pike. We caught walleyes out of weed beds all over the lake plus some midlake rock piles not far from camp. I never caught any big walleyes, but lots of decent sizes. There were times in the late 70's/early 80's when the fishing was so good my neighbors would go up for a 3 day weekend, and we live in Central Illinois. The last time I was there was in 1995. I went up with 2 friends and had a ball. The walleye were locked up that week but we caught lots of nice northern. Like I said, I am not sure how the fishing is now, but the lake has had it's moments in the past."
564418,jerry bark,2007-04-10 17:47:00,822,"this sounds like my kind of place: nice owners, only camp on the lake, pike and walleyes, priced right, no grass to mow. and driving distance to lac suel if'n you just gotta go HOW COULD YOU GO WRONG? if they had free labatt's i'd have to move in for the season... cheers, jerry"
564442,Guest,2007-04-12 06:43:00,0,"My grandfather and I fished Russell's Skyline Camp in the 60's and 70's. We did well on Walleyes and Northerns. Walleyes 2 to 2 1/2 lbs averages. Northern's 3 pounds plus. Braided nylon line, Pflueger baitcast reel and steel rod. Before depth finders, bring your own motor. Cabin about $70 a week. At times Walleyes were biting so fast you could catch a fish, unhook same in boat,catch another and throw back a previously caught smaller fish that swam away. We used to take our limits home for family. Don't do that anymore. I'm sure the place has changed in the 40 or so years since I've been there."
