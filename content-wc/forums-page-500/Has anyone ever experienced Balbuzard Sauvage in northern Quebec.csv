One the locals who's become a very good friend goes every year and raves about it. 5 star all the way, and some pretty big walleye. He's been trying to get me to go with him for a few years, but it's too pricey for me. Pretty positive the road is fine. If no one else answers your post I can try and contact him with your questions."
