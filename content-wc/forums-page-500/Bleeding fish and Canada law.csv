Nice, clean and white, no blood mess in the freezer bag. Also, clean up in the fish shack is no effort. There is virtually no blood to contend with and less liquid means less cleanup. Just before I start back to the dock at the end of the day I pull the live well plug, cut the gills, turn the pump on manual and take off. I leave the pump running while I tie up, and turn it off right before I take the fish out. Live well is clean, fish are rinsed and life could not be better."

1287085,Robert Cardenas,2011-03-26 02:00:00,138,"I have been bleeding my fish out for the last 5 years now. I always do it on my way back into the dock, so when I get there I just empty the live well and clean the fish with an electric knife. Your mess when cleaning your fish is next to none, and the fillets have 0 blood in them, you dont have to keep your hands under cold water trying to get the blood out. My wife says they look like what you would buy out of the store. Personally if commercial boats do it there must be a reason. I never believed there would be a difference in the fillets and probably was one of the last to try it out of my fishing buddies and now I would never not bleed them out. The only thing I have ever been dinged for in Canada is talking on my phone while operating a motorized vehicle $150."
1286329,elway12,2011-03-24 11:50:00,335,"My question is: Is it against any sort of law in Canada(Ontario) about bleeding a fish into the water(lake) then putting them on ice? If some of you have been following there is quite a long and strong opinioned thread in strictly fishing on the advantages, disadvantages, and ?? about the bleeding of fish after you catch them."
1286591,Guest,2011-03-24 21:15:00,0,"WOW! NO there is not a law against that and I would sincerely hope our lawmakers will never be that whacked! But I can almost see them in a smokey room, bored to death cuz Harper won't let them do anything, and thinking ""Isn't there something we can legislate against. Fish blood? GREAT IDEA!"
1286663,JinxCanada,2011-03-25 06:33:00,1306,"There is no law against it that I'm aware of...but you could call the Ministry to double check. I've never done it myself, but I see no problem with it."
1286667,Bigstorm,2011-03-25 06:36:00,799,Bleeding a walleye is something I've never heard of until the last day or 2 on here. Would it really make that much difference in the taste of a fresh walleye from Canadian waters?
1286677,JinxCanada,2011-03-25 06:51:00,1306,"When the water is cold, no I seriously doubt it..but when teh water warms up then possibly. I would think keeping the meat cold would be better than having the fish swim around in 80-90 degree water in the live well and dying there all day. I will try it and see if there is any real difference in the summer, but at this tiem of year? nope. no point"

1286734,3M TA3,2011-03-25 08:25:00,2846,where can i find that?
1286803,Moondog,2011-03-25 10:20:00,362,"The last few years I have watched a guy clean fish that he bleeds once he gets to the fish cleaning house. I noticed that there was very little blood to deal with so last year I tried it. Slit their throats while still in the live well at the dock. Then after a few minutes I removed them from the dead well, and took them to the fish house. The fillets are really clean and white. PLUS the fish are dead when I go to clean them and not flopping around all over."
1286821,elway12,2011-03-25 10:34:00,335,My group that goes to Canada each summer is going to try the bleeding just to see if it makes cleaning the fish a little faster. After hours in the boat anything that saves us time to eat and sleep will be worth it. Plus putting them on ice after will help with the quality of the fillets.
1286857,jswinter40,2011-03-25 11:42:00,127,"only way cleaning a fish gets faster is if you practice. learn to use an electric knife if you want. I cannot see how bleeding would change anything. fish flop, so what, fish bleed, so what, grab it and cut the sucker!"
