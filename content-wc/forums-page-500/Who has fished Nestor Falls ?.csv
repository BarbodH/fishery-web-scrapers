I know the pan fishing is great in that area, but where is the best place to go after Walleye's? We would very much appreciate any help we can get. Thanks,"

Walleye fishing can be quite good on Little Pine and Big Pine lakes. These are all connected and can be reached pretty quickly from your dock at Arrowhead. Should you want something different, you can pull your boat and go across the road to the Government dock and put in on Lake of the Woods. Wallleye are plentiful and there are numerous guides who can show you the ropes. You will like Arrowhead Camp. Clyde and Dessie run a good camp and the folks who stay there are mostly people who have stayed there for generations. Literally!!! There will be folks staying there who have fished walleye in the area for over 40 years. Most are perfectly happy to help new folks learn how to fish successfully. Just ask around. If you like, email me and I can try to put you in touch with some of the folks who primarily fish walleye. I live on Lake of the Woods and primarily fish muskies. I will be late arriving this year, but will be glad to help where I can. Good luck!!"
