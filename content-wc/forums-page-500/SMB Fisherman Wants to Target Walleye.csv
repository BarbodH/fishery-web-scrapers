Used to routinely fish for winter walleyes below the locks and dams on the Mississippi.For many years have fished the Miles Bay, Sabaskong Bay and the areas between for SMB in early JuneNever fished intentionally for walleye on woods. My fishing partner and I often say we should spend some time targeting walleye. Never got around to it. Then last June throwing cranks we lucked into a school of 24-26"" walleye in an area where the was a current eddy around a point. Had a blast and that got us seriously planning to spend some time walleye fishing this June. We most likely will throw deep diving cranks over under water islands and when fishing the shore areas will start out throwing cranks over deeper water especially around points. I suspect that throwing cranks over underwater islands may not be very productive. So since I've a lot of jigs from fishing winter walleye will take them along. Will not use live bait so will take Berkley Gulp. Will also take along a good supply of plastic grubs.Hoping for some perspective on throwing cranks over underwater islands and what type/size of Berkley Gulp to use?Thanks!"

You will also have decent success with green pumpkin 4"" to 6"" Gulp worms if you want to rig them on Linde's, or you can break them in half and use them on a heavier jighead. [We thread the Gulp Leech on the hook like a twister tail, instead of hooking through the sucker and out the other side. It seems to give a little more enticing action to the leech, and will last longer. If it gets tore, just pull it off the jighead, cut off 1/4-1/2"" and put it back on for a couple dozen more walleye.] Besides the points and underwater reefs, don't forget to work the ledges around bouys up in the Miles area. Some of the biggest walleye we've caught were on the sides of these bouys in mid-summer. You might also have good success trolling deeper diving cranks near breaklines, outside weed lines, etc. Shad, perch and fire tiger colors work well. We catch a lot of walleye long-lining #9 Shad Raps in 14-12' of water along the beaches in the areas you mentioned. We usually do it after getting exhausted catching SMB and wanting to take a break, or needing to catch a few eaters for supper. ChuckE"
