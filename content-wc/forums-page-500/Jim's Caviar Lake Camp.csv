Remember that most of the fellas that frequent the board are from the area and may be a litttle ""flowery"" in their descriptions of how good the fishing is. On the other hand, they should be able to answer any questions for you........and oh yes, the fishing probably IS good there. I plan on getting there someday myself. -Jhttp://www.justfishontario.com/disc54_toc.htm"
532609,downriverbob,2003-06-20 13:36:00,880,"I have been posting about the smallmouth fishing on LOTW/Whitefish Bay and won't be considered a local, I travel 1000 miles from southeast Michigan to fish there. I mainly fish for bass to take a break from musky fishing. You would have an extremely long run to fish the area that I'm familiar with. The smallmouth fishing is good in that area because most of the fishing done in LOTW/Whitefish Bay is either Musky or Lake Trout, the bass get very little pressure. Because the large amount of islands in the area you will be fishing would imagine that there should be very good population of bass. We usually use rattletraps, you fish them fairly quickly and tend to attract more agressive fish. We also use spinner baits, topwater baits, and some other body baits. I have also caught them on a fly rod. Goo luck"

The smallmouth fishing will be good. Look for reefs on Dogpaw. I'd need to look at a map for more specific locations. Casting Rat'l traps or a live bait rig with minnows works well. There is virtually no Walleye available on Dogpaw or Caviar. Portage trips to other small lakes are available. Northern pike fishing can be good on both Caviar and Dogpaw. Casting spoons and small spinners will get the small pike. For larger pike the boys will suggest trolling crankbaits. Risto Raps and other deep diving cranks. Have some equipment ready for Lake Trout. if you spot large schools of baitfish on your depth finder, drop a heavy jig head with white twister tail. Rip jig agressivly with two or three foot lifts quickly. If you hook into one you will have a great thrill. Use ball bearing swivels on the large jig heads as line twist can be a problem."

We caught some real nice pike trolling for lakers in Dogpaw, and also some real nice Lakers as well, and the walleye were going bezerk, we caught walleye in places we didnt even know had them. If you want pure numbers, Flint is always a fun time, spinner baits over weeds or against shore will work as well as spoons and cranks/rattle traps. We used to go up in mid june, but the weather got too hot, and the bugs WOW, be ready for that, that is why we go over Memorial day, way less bugs and cooler temps, but have fun, any more info i can help ya with, let me know"

Everybody blamed the may flies for the lack of walleye on Stephens this year, but it was great to find so many in Caviar. Flint (south end of Caviar) was strong too. Jigging with leeches/minnows."
