We caught Walleyes , Blue Walleyes ,Perch , Lake Trout , Northern and Eel Pout. There was lots of snow. The weather was awesome with temps in the 30s and 40s for 4 days . The Lakers and the Pout are a blast on ice fishing gear. Having never eaten Eel Pout I was skeptical but they are awesome."

I will fry one of mine , but would think it too would taste good that way too. No fishy taste at all. We did eat well ..... from fish fry to prime rib roast to a turkey on the grill !!! They are great hosts."
