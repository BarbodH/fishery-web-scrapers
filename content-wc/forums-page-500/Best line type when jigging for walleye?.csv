1288173,Moondog,2011-03-28 20:37:00,362,I was thinking that but what a pain!!! You tie one of those and sometimes it includes your trolling motor and your dog!
1288239,doubleheader,2011-03-29 06:31:00,2652,"Spro #10 swivels, very tiny but 35 lb test. I use 10 lb Power Pro to 10 lb fluorocarbon. This way I get the benefits of a small diameter, no stretch, highly sensitive, and almost invisible line and most of the time don't lose my jig when I'm hung up."
1288259,JayM5209,2011-03-29 07:20:00,1050,"8# Trilene XL, tied to jig with a Palomar knot, no swivel. It catches fish, so I choose not to spend all the extra bucks for something other than good quality mono."
1288652,GOBIG,2011-03-30 03:49:00,126,"Two years ago, i went to a camp that had very big pike, the owner recommended power pro 50lbs. So, i bought some and put it on all of my rods. I cast a lot, but also jig and troll. I do not like changing rods often based on what i am doing. I thought it was to much line, but after 2 years and 4 trips i was wrong. I caught just as many fish if not more than the boys using lighter lines. It casted out smooth every time. Being cheap, i still use the same line at home for bass and crappie. Great line, works well for everything i do."
1277909,Mike Kansas,2011-03-04 10:01:00,1463,I use straight fluro and I can't imagine anything being better. Of course anything strung on a G Loomis allows you to feel them swim up to the jig. Good Luck to all and have a safe and big fish season. Mike Kansas
1277924,adempsey,2011-03-04 10:34:00,963,"I have used and use all sorts of line. I think it's more important to find a good brand of line regardless of what the line actually is. I found bad line in all categories (mono, fluoro, braid). For my open water rods I believe right now I have some Trilene XT (gold standard mono IMO), P-Line and YoZuri mono/fluoro hybrid and Power Pro braid. Although, I am still not completely sold on the hybrid lines due to memory issues - I will try again this season. Also, I stopped using 100% fluoro due to the expense and some of it I found prone to premature breaking.I am starting to migrate most of my rods to braid though. The added benefit of braid is that you don't need to change it every season; and you can even reverse it for further use (remove from spoon and respool it in reverse). Add a fluoro leader and you get all of it's benefits plus the added long term durability.I was going to test out the Suffix 832 braid this season as well as it looks to be a good product. However, I ran across some Power Pro at an amazing clearance price so that's going to have to wait now =)."
1278170,bpetersen,2011-03-04 21:58:00,251,I have gone to 100% braid. Walleye rods have 4lb. power pro.
1278322,Larry S,2011-03-05 08:06:00,665,"Use straight 8lb fireline Have caught many large fish with no breakoffs. Use smoke color,most water fished is stained"
1278378,digjig,2011-03-05 10:39:00,146,"I think in many cases it depends on the water being fished. If you are on a deeply stained body of water like Lac Seul, a braid is great for ""feel"" and is less likely to be detected. However, if you are on clearer water like Mille Lacs, then a mono or flouro may be needed to avoid dectection. My 'go to'0 jigging reel is a Quantum Pti 20 spinning reel which comes with 2 spools. I load one with 8 lb braid and the other with 8 lb mono and switch them out as needed. As others have mentioned, braid to flouro with a uni-knot gives you the best of both worlds. -DJ"
1287247,baker11,2011-03-26 12:35:00,108,Anyone using P-line products? with what results?
1287409,jswinter40,2011-03-26 22:57:00,127,I use P-LINE 100% fluorcarbon. I started to use it for ice fishing because I was having bad luck with Vanish breaking. I really think its better. i now use it whenever buying Fluoro. I have not tried their hybrid monos though. I guess I am an old fashion 33yo because I keep going back to my trilene mono when jigging. i am going to give powerpro and 832 a try this year though in my vertical jigging applicaitons.
1287808,Catman59,2011-03-28 04:41:00,345,"I use Suffix Elite 8 lb mono for the jigging rods . I even have a rod with 6 lb Elite that I use very often . I use the Hi-vis yellow and absolutely have great luck with the line. I use my walleye rods for jigging Lakers also and it works great. I use Fireline on my other rods for casting spoons , Raps etc."
1288045,elway12,2011-03-28 15:37:00,335,I think I will go from a braid to floro. It makes me feel better that the line is clear at the jig end. So here's another question: Is there going to be any performance change going from 8 pound PP to an 8 pound floro leader seeing as though the leader line will be thicker than the line above it? Hope this make sense.
1288095,Moondog,2011-03-28 16:58:00,362,Great Question!!! AND......if you go from 8# Power Pro (diameter of 1# test) to 8# flouro.......what knot to tie?
1262521,twobearlake,2011-01-17 20:00:00,379,What swivel size and make would you recommend when using this setup?TB
1262547,Moosebunk,2011-01-17 23:05:00,211,"PowerPro is great line. Don't see the need for the swivel but sure, why not. 8-14lb depending on structure fished but with a uni to uni used to attach 3-4 feet of a 6-10lb floro lead. Favorite jigging combo... 10lb PP with an 8lb Drennan leader on the ultralight. For casting cranks and trolling apps I like 6-8lb mono... unless trolling Bay Of Quinte."
1262576,Bill Krejca,2011-01-18 06:52:00,6107,"I use the smallest swivel I can find. If you look at the lb-test of the swivels, as they usually appear in a catalog, they test significantly higher in strength than the line most of us use. Maybe I have just been lucky, but I don't remember ever breaking a swivel. I believe the smaller sizes turn better, also. As an afterthought - Some of the swivels (ball bearing) only ""turn"" on one end - the other end being fixed, I tie the turning end to the jig, just seems to make more sense to me. Maybe keeps dirt out of the swivel, too. Bill"
1262591,nitrodude,2011-01-18 07:36:00,60,"Braid with a uni/uni to flouro leader has served me well for several years now. I've never experienced any twisting issues, due to the nature of most braided lines. Last year I stuck with my already proven 10# Power Pro and uni knotted a 3-4' piece of new Seaguar Tatsu 8# flouro leader. I fished that same leader for the whole week (7 days) of fishing on Lac Seul! I caught hundreds of walleye, pike and a few smallies on that outfit and broke off a few times (dang pike), but still had better than 2' of leader left when the reel came off the rod for the flight home. After 15 yrs. of fishing the same water consecutively, I am sold on this main line and Tatsu leader combo.....until something better comes along."
1262856,REG,2011-01-19 06:57:00,445,"I fished plain old Stren blue 8lb for years so I tried some Spiderwire Stealth a yr or two. It is super thin, very sensitive, and resists cutoffs better. But with all that said, I'm back to my Stren mono. I like the way it casts and transmits bites back to me when I'm casting jigs with it. I think it's a tad easier to see the bite as well. And I usually find myself casting the jig as much or more than just working under the boat. If you're fishing mostly straight up and down, the super lines are great - but then any line works pretty well straight under the boat. Don't forget that a sensitive rod is probably more important than the line when it comes to those light bites."
1262892,Pooch,2011-01-19 09:01:00,4619,"Last year I started using Power Pro 8# in yellow. The visibility really helped for evening fishing. I also use a BB swivel and about a three foot flouro leader to the jig. I like six pound on the leader, but many times when the fish thresh in the net the knot fails at the jig. I think that reflects poorly on my knot tying skills! Eight pound works OK but is a little big for really small jigs. It does slow the fall down with is sometimes a plus, but it also lets the current pick up the jig if it has rained. Pooch"
1262984,retire55,2011-01-19 13:22:00,1029,"For the last couple of years, I've been using 8/3 Crystal Fireline for vertically jigging and for slip bobbering too. I always attach about 3 feet of 100% fluorocarbon via a very small black swivel to the end of the Fireline. Having the swivel there allows for easy changeouts of pretied leaders and light wire hooks, especially when the bite is on."
1264787,new hips,2011-01-25 18:35:00,498,"I only use 4 or 6lb gray fireline, with a sensitive rod you can feel every rock and stone down there. I switched 1 reel back to Mono and missed so many light taps, to frustrating for me. The bad side is when stuck it's hard to break off. Got my biggest Northern 39in with 6lb Fireline while jigging for Walleye, I'll never change, used Power Pro also with good results."
1264820,Wall-i-Lama,2011-01-25 20:39:00,1524,Fireline 8lb any color.
1277880,DROP SHOT,2011-03-04 08:48:00,10,I use braid to swivel to fluoro it is the best.
1262375,elway12,2011-01-17 12:18:00,335,My question is similar to a post I started a while back but I wanted some more input as I plan for my Canada trip. What type of line do you use when you jig for walleye on the Canadian shield lakes? I have always used 100% Floro. as I tried to make sure the fish didn't see my line. But the 100% Floro. gets awfuly twisted and has extreme memory etc. So I am thinking of using PP this summer. Any thoughts? Thanks.
1262389,Rlcrouse,2011-01-17 12:58:00,286,6lb Cabelas mono. has never failed me.
1262391,micropterus,2011-01-17 12:59:00,450,Braid to fluoro leader solves your issues.
1262392,Bill Krejca,2011-01-17 13:00:00,6107,"I have pretty much completed the migration to Power Pro. I like the bright yellow/bright green color for ease of seeing (by me), 8lb works well for me. I prefer to vertical jig, however when casting and jigging over a rock bottom, I may use mono, because I can better stretch the line and pop the jig off of rock snags..usually. If the water is clear, I use a red or green or black marker on several feet of the Power Pro to maybe make the line by the jig a little less noticeable to the fish. This may or may not be worth the effort, it just makes me feel better, so I consider it worth doing. In water that is less than clear, I may or may not bother to color the line. A final thought - If I am using a bait that twists the line, I'll use a ball bearing swivel several feet above the bait, will then use clear or colored mono, or fluoro between the swivel and the bait. Again, I don't know if it (the mono/fluoro leader) makes any bite potential difference from a visibility standpoint, I just have to use something, and that's what I use. (Also I feel the mono/fluoro leader, being a little stiffer, maybe doesn't tangle as much., which, after all, is what I am trying to combat with the swivel.) Bill"
1262395,elway12,2011-01-17 13:10:00,335,Thanks for the tips. Do you think adding a swivel (ie PP to Floro.) has any loss of sensativity for feeling strikes. I always was told that adding anything except the jig added to a less ability to feel strikes etc.
1262403,Bill Krejca,2011-01-17 13:37:00,6107,My personal opinion is that the addition of a swivel would not result in a noticeable loss in sensitivity for most of us. What would be noticeable would be a twisted line (when a swivel is not used) that could just generally mess things up significantly. Bill
1262441,Moondog,2011-01-17 15:41:00,362,"I am in agreement with you, Bill. We use green power pro 8# test for all vertical jigging and tie the jig to the line. The sensitivity is unbeatable. If we drag Lindy-riggish types of things we still use Power Pro add a swivel and a fluorocarbon leader.....some twisting still occurs. Tried PP leader and it was a disaster......talk about twisted and un-savable!!! Any thoughts about using red Power Pro??? Our friend that originally turned us on to PP in Florida uses it exclusively now but all salt water."
1262488,Larry Mac,2011-01-17 18:21:00,530,"Hi elway2, I am in total agreement with Bill also. I use braid to swivel to fluoro to jig and have caught thousands of walleye with no line twist or loss of sensitivity. Have a great yearThank you,Larry Mac"
1262495,guidedfishing,2011-01-17 18:32:00,531,"Agreed, I run 10lb power pro to a small swivel and approx 24 - 30 inches of floruo, leader. My son runs fire line same terminal setup. No sensitivity is lost. When my leader gets down to 14 - 16 inches I just tie on a new length. good luck GF"
1262517,Further North,2011-01-17 19:57:00,2008,"I've been using Power Pro here in WI with great success, and have switched over to the the new Suffix 832 - it's smoother, and the bright yellow is like a telegraph when something runs with you line.They make it in a dark green also, and 6 ft. of mono or fluorocarbon solves any line visability issues you might have...though tying right to the line hasn't made much - if any - difference to me."
