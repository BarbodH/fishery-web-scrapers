564855,Guest,2007-04-30 18:28:00,0,btt I'd like to know the answer too.
564910,TECK,2007-05-03 09:03:00,151,The new 2007 Canada chip has it.I have not used it yet. I have use the gold chart 1G900xl3 and the old Lake Superior chip. Both work for me.
564924,Guest,2007-05-03 16:38:00,0,It's not on the list of lakes in Ontario.
564929,Guest,2007-05-03 20:09:00,0,"guest1 - what ""list of Ontario lakes"" are you refering to? the previous poster TECK actually has the product and states definitively that the area in question is on the chip. are you repeating what you read on the Navionics site--""the list""--or do you have personal experience with the chip (XG14 Great Lakes and Maritimes)? don't mean to be rude, but your post adds to my confusion"

YES - According to email from Navionics: ""The 14XG chart does include the Winnipeg river system and goes as far as LeVasseur Island in Manitoba. The Lat/Long is 50 deg 19.490N and 95 deg10.097W.

564953,Guest,2007-05-04 18:31:00,0,"I looked on their website and the Canadea chip has a list of lakes in Ontario and other providences and Big,Little Sand and RoughRock aren't listed. I know they where on the old GreatLakes chip and just want to be sure they are on the new one. The Canada Chip just has the lakes outlined with no contour lines."
1286956,Guest,2011-03-25 16:13:00,0,We used the Navionics 2XG for our H2oC in 2010 which covered all the lakes in that area. It worked well.
