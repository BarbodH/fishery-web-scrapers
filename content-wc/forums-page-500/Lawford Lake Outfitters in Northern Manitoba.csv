The area is well known as the pike hotspot in Manitoba, perhaps Canada, just my opinion. The lakes in the area (Gods, Knee, Max, Molson, Windy, Utik, Semmens, etc) are about the best you can get for big gators. However, I haven't fished Lawford and can't can't speak to it's quality. But, while most of the lakes and rivers in the area will have spectacular pike fishing, some are much better known as walleye fisheries than others. Try this website to help:http://www.travelmanitoba.com/master_angler_search.asp If you enter in lakes like Gods or Knee, for example, you will see that there are more trophies caught (5,000+) than the program can display."

1287357,Almosta2,2011-03-26 19:31:00,2,I fished Lawford Lake last year and found it to be the best I have ever fished in about 40 years. Great outfitter.

1069585,Mr Walleye,2008-12-21 15:16:00,29,Anybody been here?

1075929,LeeMB,2009-01-25 11:26:00,83,is this an outpost of Molson of Gunnisao? I run a lodge on Gods Lake and have not heard of this one.

1075991,LeeMB,2009-01-25 15:38:00,83,"Thanks, northern Manitoban I figured it must be close to Molson. I would expect tons of walleye in the 20""-24"" range with some bigger and a potential for walleye over 28"". should be good Pike fishing as well.NM how are my deer hunting buddies doing in Thompson? Have they gone Caribou hunting yet?"
1075995,Northern Manitoban,2009-01-25 15:54:00,195,"Hi Lee I was wondering if that was you, Caribou hunt was awesome for those who went out, i was invited to go last week but did not, maybe next week, my friend got some great photos and I will post them on my site in the near future heards of Caribou all over the lake and the winter roads, as for Lawford Lake i think it would be a great fishery being so secluded."
1075996,LeeMB,2009-01-25 16:00:00,83,"thanks, I will check your site!Lee"
1077643,Mr Walleye,2009-01-31 13:58:00,29,Thanks for the info!
