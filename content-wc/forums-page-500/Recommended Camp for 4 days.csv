1286012,NARDA 1,2011-03-23 16:44:00,636,"Call Cheryl at Birch Dale Lodge on Eagle Lake 807-227-5262 www.birchdalelodge.com I would think she could work something out for you. You will drive right buy there on the way to Ear Falls, so it isn't out of your way. Great Lake and accomodations, check it out. Terry"
1284532,digjig,2011-03-20 11:28:00,146,"My son (11) and I are doing a Showalter's trip in mid July. We leave Ear Falls on a Wednesday and return Sunday. If we are going to drive 8 hours from the TC, we would like to make it a full week of fishing and leave on previous the Friday. I know most camps like to book 1 week slots. That said, do you all have a camp in mind that would cater to a Saturday to Tuesday scenario? Thank you, DJ"

1284983,stumcfar,2011-03-21 14:28:00,451,"Golden Eagle has been good to us and found us 3 day, 4 night spots every year. We have also had good luck doing that at Gold Pines and Goose Bay."
1285013,Guest,2011-03-21 15:23:00,0,I would think that most camps if they had a open cabin would be willing. That's a guess but half a weeks rent is better than nothing at all. You may have to wait until later to book it.
1285101,Hump,2011-03-21 18:54:00,578,At Ear Falls. Patty and Gary will accomodate you.
