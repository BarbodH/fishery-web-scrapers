1284685,West Newton River Rat,2011-03-20 18:57:00,128,I stayed at the Grey Rock Inn & Restaurant in Nipigon. You park right in front of the motel with plenty of room. The restaurant is below the rooms with decent food.
1284712,Bill Krejca,2011-03-20 20:27:00,6107,"The rooms then are on the second floor? How late is the restaurant open and is it also a tavern (which can attract late night customers)? A concern is foot traffic near the boats. Thanks, Bill"
1285318,Guest,2011-03-22 08:52:00,0,The Beaver is the best one to stay at currently right now in Nipigon by far !!

1257916,Bill Krejca,2010-12-27 12:24:00,6107,"I'll be heading to O'Sullivan Lake near Nakina in July and am thinking about staying overnight at Nipigon, or close to it. We have always driven all night, but want to try a motel. The criteria are that it first, have a relatively safe parking area for several boats, and that it be at least OK otherwise. Also, a nearby place for breakfast would welcome. Does anyone have a recommendation? Thanks, Bill"
1257924,Mr Ranger,2010-12-27 13:14:00,272,Hey Bill not Nipigon but we have stayed in Thunder Bay at the Comfort Inn. We have never had a problem and know other boats had stayed there as well. It worked well as we could get groceries the next morning and then still have plenty of time to get to OS by mid day. It is about 4.5 - 5 hours from Thunder Bay to OS. Think you will like the stayover. We have been doing that now for four years and really makes it much more enjoyable on the way up but drive straight back to Wausau on the way home. Good luck
1257973,Yellow Fever,2010-12-27 18:02:00,1809,"Hello Bill...I lived in Nipigon for 7 years and I would recommend the Pine Crest Motel right on Highway 17. It has everything you want and the owner is Bob Bearman a friend of mine. As I said I lived there for 7 years and I would NOT stay anywhere in Thunder Bay. You will not have any issues with the Pine Crest , it aint the ritz but all the utilitiy companies stay there."

1258681,northernbite,2010-12-31 09:43:00,1186,BillMy cousin and I stay up the road at a camp ground from Pinecrest Motel. That is our 1000 mile mark from Pa. as we travel up north. We have always thought that would be a good place to stay if we where going to use a motel. Just our observation.Paul
1258835,Ogoki,2011-01-01 07:46:00,291,"We also have stayed at Pine Crest Motel. Have also stayed at Birchwood. We found out the hard way , do not stay at a motel there that is on a hill. The trucks braking ,going down the hill will keep you awake . Very long sleepless night for both of us ."
1259114,Bill Krejca,2011-01-02 16:51:00,6107,"Thanks, guys for the continuing posts. Re: hill - the 2 motels, I assume, are not on a hill, or maybe are? Thanks, again, Bill"
1259186,Ogoki,2011-01-03 05:17:00,291,"Both Pine Crest and Birchville Motels are on level ground . Pine Crest is a little further off the road . In addition , we have stayed at several different , motels there mainly because Pine Crest and Birchville have been full . Anymore we call several days ahead to book us a room. I see myself more and more as I get older, going with what I know instead of trying something new . That goes with the lake I fish and the outfitter I bear hunt with . Have tried new things and have had some unpleasant surprises . What some people call good is not good to me . For example we use to fly out with an outfitter that is 8 hours closer drive and $200 cheaper per person . Then I went to Armstrong and really love that trip. 35,000 acre lake verses 500 to 1000 acre lakes make a big difference in numbers and size . In addition the closer trip charges us overweight for anything over 100 lbs so we ended up closer in price . LOVE the drive around the north shore of Lake Superior too."
1259984,mwal,2011-01-06 10:29:00,151,I have stayed at Birchville several times over the years. I would stay there again. Mwal
