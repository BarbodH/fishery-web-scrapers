1288584,MorganMan,2011-03-29 19:59:00,341,"Hey, you don't need to say it twice! I will try it....Steam Whistle! Bluff, we too drink Kokanee over the years and now can buy it here in Minnesota! I think it came to us about 2 years ago. If you can't get it in Wisc, stop in a Minnesota liquor store if you get over here and take some home!"
1288657,Beagle_Nut,2011-03-30 05:09:00,52,"On our last few trips up to the Kenora area we've stopped and hit the LCBO in Sioux Narrows on the way up, and then went into town mid-week and hit the beer store by the shopping mall for ""re-stocking"" mid-trip. It seemed to me the beer store had a much bigger selection (at least from all the bottles on the wall), I'm curious why one would like the LCBO better or if anyone else had a preference. Also, even though I generally prefer the darker stronger beers I'd agree that for a ""normal"" beer Kokanee is hard to beat."
1288685,adempsey,2011-03-30 06:57:00,963,"Actually, I neglected the fact that I live in a big city with large LCBO's that have a wide selection. I probably drink more imported beer as well, most of which is only available at the LCBO. The LCBO locations in those parts probably don't compare, so you are probably better off at the Beer Store."
1288749,Bluff,2011-03-30 09:32:00,152,"Wow, I had no idea you could get it in Minn. I heard it was available in the Northwest and maybe Idaho. I'll try to get over there and picked some up. Thanks for the info."
1288782,WallerChief,2011-03-30 10:50:00,83,"I'm afraid the thread is being highjacked. Anywho, have you tried Templeton Rye? Awesome Rye with a great history.www.templetonrye.com"
1288786,Moosebunk,2011-03-30 11:01:00,211,"Next time you find yourself standing in an LCBO wondering what to try, just grab one bottle of Innis & Gunn Original. Great beer. You'll want another.Another favorite from one Canucker to anyone...Moosehead.SteamWhistle... on a hot day served really cold."
1261074,labsrus,2011-01-11 19:52:00,557,"Anyone tried this while in Canada? It has become our fav Candien Beer Came with a bottle opener and a little history about the bottles. There is a mark on the bottom to signify the folks who left another brewery to start Steam Whistle. Give it a try next time your are in Canada, I think that you will like it"
1264015,Bluff,2011-01-23 11:52:00,152,"Funny you brought this up. Based on what I had read, I couldn't wait to try this beer and finally had a chance last May when I was in Fort Frances. Several in our group tried it based on my recomendation. It was very disappointing. Very skunky. We were surprised and thought maybe the bar had a bad batch or it was old. No one had a second."
1264034,Beagle_Nut,2011-01-23 13:18:00,52,"I tried it last year near Kenora and wasn't impressed either. I've gotten to liking stronger tasting, darker beers, Steamwhistle was a pretty basic light lager from what I remember. I'd appreciate some recommendatiions from some Canada folks on what to try next year."
1288384,ek2008,2011-03-29 13:02:00,7,http://www.thebeerstore.ca/default.aspLabatt Blue is an oldy but a goodie. Mill Street Brewery makes some good suds. http://www.canadianbrewingawards.com/?p=60Winners for 2010I like Michelob but cant get that up here anymore.
1288418,Bill Krejca,2011-03-29 14:32:00,6107,"Labatts used to make a stout cream ale, very similar to Amberbach, but better. I haven't found it for many years, but it was a great beer (in my opinion). Bill"
1288469,NARDA 1,2011-03-29 16:31:00,636,"Kokanee has been the winner for us. LaBatts Maximum ice if you like more alcohol content. Labatts Ice, Labatts 50 and Wildcat are a couple other good ones. But of course my drink of choice is ""Hiram Walker Special Old Rye Whiskey.""NARDA = North American Rye Drinkers Association"
1288474,JayM5209,2011-03-29 16:45:00,1050,"NARDA 1, I don't want to hijack this beer thread, but I'm curious as to whether you have tried Old Overholt rye. Having grown up about two miles from the original Old Overholt distillery (1st distilled on the farm of Henry Clay Frick in Westmoreland County, PA) I have a sentimental connection. But, my drink of choice, including after a day of fishing in NW Ontario, is Old Grandad . . . on the rocks with just a splash of spring water."
1288497,adempsey,2011-03-29 17:35:00,963,"It's a good beer. Don't forget, it's a Pilsner so it's a lighter tasting beer and not really something to compare to an ale.There are no preservatives in Steam Whistle and it HAS to be stored properly or it will go bad. It also has an expiry date, so I am pretty sure whoever had a bad tasting one was because of this. Also, if it was on tap, the bar must keep their lines clean or all beer coming out will taste absolutely horrible.If you want access to the ""good stuff"" you might need to hit the LCBO and not the ""Beer Store"". Off the top of my head, I like products from Amsterdam, McAuslan and Great Lakes Breweries. This site has some good reviews."
1288503,Blue Lk,2011-03-29 17:42:00,269,"I also don't won't to side track this thread,however.Narda have you ever tried Forty Creek Barrel Select,very,very good rye whiskey.Try it,I'm sure you will like it.(I am not affiliated with 40 creek,but I wish I was a share holder.Now back to the beer drinkers."
1288529,Bluff,2011-03-29 18:23:00,152,That's interesting and may explain why the beer we had wasn't very good. It was in bottles at the Rendevous in FF. I like alot of canadian beers but Kokanee has become my favorite. I really wish I could get it down here.
