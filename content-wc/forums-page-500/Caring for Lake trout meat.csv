1284469,elway12,2011-03-20 09:25:00,335,I know we are on a walleye site but I know some people probably could help me with this. We love catching a laker or 2 and usually have them smoked by the owners of the camp. But we feel like we are imposing on them to do this. So for this summer we would like to take the lakers home to prepare ourselves. Knowing trout meat is generally much more sensitive to freezing etc. How do you handle your lakers after you catch them and store them? Can we freeze them in camp and still expect good results cooking them when we get home?
1284491,guidedfishing,2011-03-20 10:09:00,531,"We target lakers, we also love to eat them. Generally the smaller ones 26in's or less are best. I will leave the skin on and remove the y bone from each fillet. then freeze them with the meat side together and the skin side out, When transporting I generally leave the tail on as well. You don't want to wait more than a month to thaw out and eat them. Or you can clean them like this keep them cold and freeze when you get back, skin and chunk into steaks. I then preseason them and place on a flat sheet freeze them, as soon as they get solid I put them four steaks to a package in the foodsaver. They will last like this for along time. I have had them 9 months later like this and it was very good. We then broil or cook on the grill. Some of the best lake trout are the fresh one. Clean as I described, leave the skin on (make sure you remove the Y bones as that leaves a nice trough for seasoning. Place the entire fillet on the grill you can use tomato and basil or italian dressing to cover the top and grill open side up. You don't need to flip it. The skin will blacken you can put foil under it which makes it a little easier to serve or just cook skin down on the grill. Season to taste, you can also use a little alder brush to add some additional flavor. This is one of my favorites fresh grilled lake trout. Only if we accidentally kill a bigger one will we smoke it. good luck GF"

We always take a vacuum sealer with us and use it to package then freeze all the fish we're bringing home. With this method, I've thawed and cooked lakers that were approaching a year old and they were fine. They probably wouldn't keep that long if not vacuum packed.Others in my group fillet and debone lakers before freezing, leaving the skin on. I like to leave mine whole, just gilling, gutting, and taking the head off. My favorite prep is baking in the oven or foil wrapped on the grill. After thawing, salt and pepper, add butter pats, onion slices, and lemon slices in the cavity and on top, and wrap in foil. In the oven at 375 degrees for 40 - 45 minutes and then to the table whole. With a fork the skin will lift right off the top side and the meat will lift off the bones. To get to the bottom side, you can lift the back bone and all the ribs will come right with it. Easy to do, and delicious eating!"
1284573,elway12,2011-03-20 13:54:00,335,"How do you care for them in the boat? Do you put them on ice, stringer, live well etc? Some people have told me that if you don't put them on ice that the meat can get tough or bad."
1284588,vteye,2011-03-20 14:23:00,812,"I would suggest bleeding them and then putting on ice. I fillet no skin and bake in the outdoor grill with garlic powder, little onion, bread crumbs, real butter wrapped in alum foil. I prefer it medium well. I eat most of yearly intake from ice fishing and great reason to fire up the grill in winter."
1284611,guidedfishing,2011-03-20 15:58:00,531,"if its spring and the water is cool around 55, my live well will keep two small trout 22- 26in alive if the aerator runs constant. Anything more than that and there toast. Usually when I'm fishing lake Michigan or Superior its easy to have a large cooler full of ice to ice down trout, and salmon . Unfortunately when were in Canada its not always feasible to have a lot of ice available to fill the cooler especially when were camping. Usually we can pick up 2-4 trout in the morning fairly quickly, we will head back to camp and get them taken care of and cooled down. Just depends on your situation but you do need to get them cooled down if you can't keep them alive and that's most of the time. good luck GF"
1284623,v-bay gord,2011-03-20 16:27:00,3168,"Unless the water is very cold, there is nothing worse for your trout than to leave them dead in water. Best case put them in ice as soon as possible. If you are lacking ice, then wrapping them in a wet burlap sack with a couple freezer packs and putting in a cooler or drained live well. I've cleaned many trout and the fillets will become soft very quickly if you don't look after them. A cooler with a few ice packs works well."
1284636,elway12,2011-03-20 17:03:00,335,Thank you for all of your help. We will certainly pack a cooler when we head out for lakers this summer.
1287259,JinxCanada,2011-03-26 13:41:00,1306,"if you freeze your fillets in water/ice in a zip lock freezer bag they will keep fresh for years and years. i freeze all my fish this way be it walleye, steelhead, salmon, perch, small mouth bass etc."
