I hoped it was my friends playing the ultimate prank but knew better. 2 calcutta te's' 2 cronarch's 7 spirex, multiple st croix's, 2 tackle boxes full and all sorts of other stuff. they even stole my stash of jack daniels, now thats below the belt. Well I had a lot of stuff to do, now I have a lot more. I figure close to $3000 but who knows. Hope insurance steps up some. I will have a good time anyway with my 16 year old and my little guy age 10 on his first trip. Called my friends and they are all loaning me stuff. Can always count on good friends. eric macdonald in southern ohio"
557824,Guest,2006-05-29 14:00:00,0,"that suck eric, my buddie left his tackle box at the counter of avis last week when we were picking up are rental car. We didn't notice it until we were at esox landing unloading the car. He had all his tackle and all his reels in the box. I helped him out with my reels and tackle, but still a bad way to start the trip. Where do you guys stay on lower manitou?, we had great fishing there this past week."

557827,pfg1,2006-05-29 15:42:00,52,I hope you have enough time and friends to substitute new gear. Where was your rig stored? When do you think the gear was stripped? DAVID

1286283,JinxCanada,2011-03-24 10:12:00,1306,Best thing you can do with that is look at it as an excuse (without the wife giving you a hard time) to get all NEW AND BETTER gear!!! :-)
1286292,Freytown,2011-03-24 10:29:00,770,"I'm sure gear has been replaced, it's been 5 yrs."
1286296,T Mac,2011-03-24 10:33:00,10084,Man it still sucks...even after 5 yrs. Wouldn't you like to catch those S.O.B's....!
