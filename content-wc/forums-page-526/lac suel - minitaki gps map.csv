1219934,fisher_i_am,2010-07-16 21:38:00,498,Hi. I have a new depth finder (humminbird 898 SI) and looking for a map for minitaki and lac suel (sen bay area) any suggestions. I'm new to this advanced electronics. Thanks
1219986,JDP,2010-07-17 08:02:00,1457,"If you are looking for a ""chip"" Navionics has one....http://www.navionics.com/LakeList_HM...asp?RegionID=5"
1220010,2746,2010-07-17 09:04:00,3206,That's the one I use and I've found it accurate for Lac Seul.
1220017,WalleyeWally28,2010-07-17 09:25:00,298,I've used it for several years and also have found it to be accurate.
1220075,CI_Guy,2010-07-17 14:41:00,2118,"I used the Navionics Premium earlier this summer on Pelican, Abrams & Minitaki. It was very accurate for Abrams & Pelican but almost useless for Minitaki. Areas of Minitaki the map chip showed as under 6' deep were often 25' to 30'. Other areas it showed as 30' deep had rocks above the water surface."
1220078,WalleyeWally28,2010-07-17 14:49:00,298,I should clarify my statement. I've only used it on Lac Seul.
