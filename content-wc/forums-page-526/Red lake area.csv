1214851,tackleman,2010-06-30 10:27:00,444,"depends on where you want to fish.Howey bay camps is right in town, the owners are good people and are very friendly. Sunset lodge is on forestry point road and has a good reputation. Black Bear Lodge is further down the lake and is accessible by the suffle lake road west of red lake.In the Gullrock area (part of the red lake system) there is Wrights wilderness camp, Poplar Point lodge, 5 lakes lodge, South Bay on Gullrock, Golden Hook Camp and Procyk's Fishermans paradise camp. All these are well run and have good equipment. I'm pretty sure if you google them you'll find their web sites"

1214864,Gary from Iowa,2010-06-30 11:03:00,74,"Last year I, 3 brothers and a nephew stayed at Bow Narrows, Red Lake, in late July. While we used the housekeeping plan, most guests stay on the American Plan. The cabins are basic with plenty of room. Bedrooms with single beds upstairs, living room, bath, kitchen and toilets downstairs. The furniture is wooden, so some cushions would be nice. The boats are nice 16 footers. Ours were equipped with 20 hp electric start Hondas. The staff was quite nice. Emily, a college girl, brought clean towels and a cheerful manner. Ben, another student, cleaned our fish (much better than we could-we really liked this service.) Another young lady brought us a lemon merengue pie-one of the best. Prices are reasonable.Its a 20 mile boat ride on the ""Licketly Split"" from Red Lake west to Bow Narrows. There protected water at this end of the lake.Walleye fishing was good. We caught more in the 20 plus inch size than the small ones that we wanted for eating. Other guests caught Walleyes in the 27 plus inch range. We caught few northern. I think the largest was 31 inches. Gary"
1214869,Fishing Traveler,2010-06-30 11:26:00,19,I have heard good things about Eagle Falls Lodge. I sent you a PM. Chris
1214981,kipawa kid,2010-06-30 18:56:00,13,"Sportsmans's Lodge is located on Little Vermillion, 25 miles north by air from Red Lake. It is run by the Geary Family, who have been outfitting for many years. They boast having some of the best northern action in Ontario, and land 50 inchers just about every year."

1219653,GOBIG,2010-07-16 08:11:00,126,There are a few outfitters on this lake. Pm me 3 with some people from this year who are coming back next year and some who may not be. Just looking to get pros and cons of a new place.
