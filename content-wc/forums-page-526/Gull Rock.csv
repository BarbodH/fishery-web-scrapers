1218187,tackleman,2010-07-12 05:37:00,444,"the water is warm 65 degrees, the fish are active and everywhere.I was out yesterday at fishermans point, got 30 in a couple hours, largest was 22 inches, smallest was 10 inches, in 14 to 24 feet of water,I went to the boot for an hour, got 3 in 20 to 25 feet.good luck on your trip and drive safely coming up, by the way, the highway to Red Lake is being worked on, so there may be hold ups for construction."
1218800,tackleman,2010-07-13 19:25:00,444,"I was out today at a little hump by the gullrock, the walleye that normally nibble and tug were hitting like a ton of bricks. almost all the ones I caught felt like they were big fish but were really only 16 inches. maybe it was the wind and the boat speed but it felt like they were 5 pounders and they fought like it too."
1218981,hranson,2010-07-14 08:58:00,4,"Just wondering how you were fishing the different places. Trolling, jigging, casting, ??????. Thanks for any info"
1219112,tackleman,2010-07-14 13:44:00,444,"i'm kinda like the old dog you can't teach new tricks to. Years ago all i did was jig, but then my old hunting partner from Indiana got me into trolling and he taught the wife how good trolling and dragging spinners was, and that was it, any time we went out we had to troll because Tom said it was the best way to fish. Anyway, I started trolling and using spinners (little joes) tipped with a minnow and usually have 3 or 4 go to colours. Hammered brass, hammered silver, pink and white striped and purple. I have had lots of success with other colours, chartreuse, orange, black and white, and blue. today the fish I got were in 20 to 25 feet in one spot and 16 to 18 in another, I guess it just depends on where the bait is swimming.lots of people jig and have great success, I just find it hard to sit in one place and wait for the fish to come to me."
1219220,Bluestem,2010-07-14 20:19:00,7,"These are welcome tips as I'm going to be at Gullrock at the end of the month. Couple questions: Should I plan on just using minnows, or should I pick up some leeches after crossing the border to have along? Also, how many dozen minnows would a group of 4 use in a day if we were finding a decent number of fish? (just looking for a rough estimate). And, what do the resorts typically charge per dozen for minnows? I'm getting so fired up to get up there . . . looking forward to leaving the job, phone and television behind, relaxing on the water, and hopefully have some fresh fish to eat! Thanks and wish all of you good luck on your trips!"
1219246,tackleman,2010-07-14 22:13:00,444,"I very seldom use leeches or worms, but others use them , how much success they have, I don't know.as far as the cost of minnows, in town they are $4.25 a dozen, and I would expect the camps to be around $4.50 a dozen, I don't really pay per dozen at the camp I get mine at, I just run a tab and pay on it monthly. As far as how many you would use, good question. When I was guiding we used to take a couple dozen minnows per person for a day, when we ran out we would go for northerns. But, if you only fish for walleye, it's a whole different story. per person, per day, I would take 3 dozen, so if you got 4 in a boat, that's 12 dozen, some will use more, some will use less but you should have enough to last for 8 hours on the lake, but you could alway have some Gulp on hand just in case. 12 dozen is 144 minnows, figuring on 2 to 3 fish per minnow, loosing some on bite offs and snags. you should be able to boat over 200 fish per day with the 12 dozen between the 4 of you.good luck, maybe i'll see you on the lake,"
1219270,bryhardt,2010-07-15 06:12:00,11,"It has been great reading the gull rock threads from this year and past years.I am making the trip back to Gull Rock in 4 weeks (August 14) after a 20 year break, which has been about 19 years to long. In the past I have always gone up in May, so August will be a new experience. Not to mention how much I hear the camp has changed and how the fishing has changed also. Hopefully the fish will still be interested in August. Wish I was leaving tomorrow..."
1219339,2746,2010-07-15 09:20:00,3206,Tackelman has given you good advice. We also use leeches and have good luck with them. we think they stay on the hook and last longer than a minnow but that's just our opinion. We pick them up at 4 seasons bait in Ear Falls on our way up (that's also where we get our license) and will buy at least a pound. We then have both leeches and minnows with us on the boat. Your camp will also likely sell them by the dozen along with minnows.
