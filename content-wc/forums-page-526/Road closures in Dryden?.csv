We usually stop at the Safeway and then head to Mickey D's for a burger. Is the closing of these roads true and, if so, any suggestions on getting around town and then heading west on 17?"
1220009,v-bay gord,2010-07-17 09:00:00,3168,"I believe they are working on the overpass, hence the closure. You would need to get to the highway via the underpass which comes out by the 7-11."
1220016,fisherman 1,2010-07-17 09:24:00,39,"Gord is correct. when you cross the bridge at the mill, turn left on Earl Ave two blocks to King St and then take another left under the subway to hwy 17.Have a great week in the great northwest!"
