1220023,MorganMan,2010-07-17 09:46:00,341,"I make the drive to Baudette fairly often from nw of the cities. The best way is to take 169 to Grand Rapids then take 2 over to Deer River then up 46(? or 43?) I think to Northome. You then have to backtrack 3 miles south on 71 to hit the cross road to 72, but its worth it. The road is good and a lot less towns to slow ya down. If you go through Walker to Cass lake, you can take a shortcut by heading east out of Cass Lake and taking the road from 2 to Blackduck. It's a slower drive because of how hilly and all the curves. I have driven all ways up there and my fastest and easiest is through Grand Rapids and Deer River though. I did hear 11 from I Falls to Baudette is a mess too. Good travels and good luck."
1219871,champ8,2010-07-16 17:16:00,40,Does anyone know the best way to get to morson from south of the twin cities. Not sure if its best to head up 35 to duluth to international falls or taking 94 up to 169 to 72 to baudette. Thanks
1219891,1shooter,2010-07-16 18:36:00,1493,We live in Chaska and go through Brianerd.
1219898,champ8,2010-07-16 19:24:00,40,1Shooter do you then go up through Bemidji or cut over to Deer River?
1219900,eye-hunter,2010-07-16 19:33:00,435,"If you go to google maps and punch in Minneapolis to Morson, that's the way I took. It was fast and direct. Next time I go, I'll take the same way."
1219910,champ8,2010-07-16 20:24:00,40,Thanks eye-hunter. I gone up pretty much that way to baudette as well as taking I-35 to duluth then north to International falls. Wasn't sure this year with road construction which way would be faster and easier on the truck and trailer.
1219911,J-Man,2010-07-16 20:26:00,191,"Currently construction detours on MN-11 between I-Falls and Baudette. Best to plan your route to come up 72 and avoid it. Been down several times through Deer River, Grand Rapids and Cloquet to 35, which works well if you are ending up on that side of the metro."
1219918,eye-hunter,2010-07-16 20:45:00,435,"I went all the way to Baudette in June (then went West to Arnesens) and had no issues. Smooth sailing the whole way. Not sure what's changed, or what's past Baudette."
1219929,Obabikon,2010-07-16 21:19:00,2370,"It depends on which side of the cities you are. However, hwy 11 on the US side is all messed up... so go through Bemiji and up what... 71?"
1219948,1shooter,2010-07-16 22:48:00,1493,We go through Bemidji. Where you leaving from?
1219971,Fish_on,2010-07-17 06:26:00,1856,"I definitely wouldn't recommend going through Bemidji that would be way out of the way. Highway 11 west of Ifalls is torn up and closed. If you go through Brainerd, I would avoid the scenic highway between Cass Lake and Blackduck... road contrsuction there too. If it were me I would go up I-35, take the cutoff west of Duluth, and cross at I falls."
