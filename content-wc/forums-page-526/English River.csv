1201257,DanM57,2010-05-17 13:45:00,135,I am curious if anyone has information on the water conditions and/or fishing downstream from Manitou Falls on the English river near Ear Falls. We leave in 12 days I am getting anxious. Any info would be great.

1206986,Simmy32,2010-06-04 13:14:00,6,"How did you do Dan? Not sure if I will see a reponse before I take off but How were the water levels, temps and fishing? Has been pretty warm up there from the looks of it. We're leaving tonight and will check in at Anderson's tomorrow afternoon. Any luck with big girls in Clear or Johnson? What depth were you finiding them at? Any feedback would be great!"
1207192,DanM57,2010-06-05 07:30:00,135,"We got back from Manitou Falls last night. Walleye fishing was pretty consistent once you found them; depths were all over the place - as shallow as 6' to as deep as 21'. Minnows and leeches were the ticket, jigs or rigs. We kept track of walleyes >23 inches - we had 43 (6 guys). The 3 largest were all 28.5 inches. We caught several northerns and small mouths - largest northern was a fat 42 incher, largest small mouth was 19. All in all, pretty good trip. Good luck."
1210655,rdober237,2010-06-16 11:08:00,3,"Dan,Which of the connecting lakes, or spot on the river did you best for Walleyes? Also were there a lot of places the you could damage props?Thanks Russ"
1210921,DanM57,2010-06-17 06:52:00,135,"We caught walleyes in Johnson, Clear, Unexpected and Wilcox. There are lots of places to damage a prop/lower unit in the system. Our group has been going to Manitou Falls for a long time (30+ years). We thought we knew where the hazards were but this year we bought 2 props. The good news is, by the end of the week, the water had come up about 3 feet. You will want to be careful."
1211731,rdober237,2010-06-20 08:25:00,3,We seem to damage a prop each year on Lac Seul and we think we know that lake. I figured the river system would be tough on props. I hope the camp has some type of map to show where the known problem areas are. I'm sure they do. Thanks again.
1219459,jigfisher9,2010-07-15 15:15:00,23,"Hey Dan or Simmy, we have been going to Manitou Falls Fish Camp for 15 years and have always had a tough time catching Walleyes or for that mater any numbers of fish in Clear or Johnson. Is there a place or pattern we should start looking for Walleyes in either lake? Any advice would be appreciated?We will be heading up in mid August and it seems we always get a day or two of wind or rain that we do not want to head to far from camp and these lakes are closer to camp than Unexpected or Wilcox. Clear Lake has to be the prettiest lake in Ontario!! Let me know if there is any info you would like on fishing this system, I would be glad to share!"
