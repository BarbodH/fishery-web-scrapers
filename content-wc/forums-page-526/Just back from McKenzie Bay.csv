I will say it was the poorest fishing I have had in 9 years as far as quantity, but the best in terms of quality. Alot of fish between 20"" and 26"", but nothing bigger and few under 20"". We probably caught a third of the fish that we normally do. Part of it could have been the fact that we ran out of minnows early in the trip. I think the quality is better on leeches, but not quantity. Also, it was a new area for us and when you are in camp boats without quality electronics and trolling motors, it makes it tougher to work drops and reefs. Best fishing was in Ghost Narrows. As always a good trip, but was expecting a little more action."

Lindy rig with a gold spinner and a minnow worked best. Caught some on a gold no 7 Rapala. Fish were in about 13-18 feet. We mostly trolled. Also caught a small Musky. No luck at Dear Island. A few at Little Sand Banks. Caught as many as you want at Broad Lake, 8-12 feet. Biggest was 23"". Caught huge walleye in the South Inlet, several from 28""-23"". None at the waterfall. 40"" Northern caught about 50 yards from the waterfall. We had a great trip as usual."
