1219358,Mully,2010-07-15 10:14:00,145,"Uchi Lake Lodge also peeked my interest at the All Canada Show this year. Thinking about a trip for next year so any info. would be appreciated. Lodge seemed to have the best of both worlds. Fly-in experience but with an american food plan if desired or a combination food plan. Small lodge and a river system that would appear to allow fishing in most conditions with the target species i.e. walleye, pike, that my group fishes for. That's what caught my interest So many camps to choose from and they all look great but I know marketing can be decieving. Mully"
1219366,Aaron-IN,2010-07-15 10:32:00,500,Wish I could give you more recent information but I've been there twice over 20 years ago. Back then it was a great walleye fishery with a lot of big fish and known for very large Pike. The lodge I stayed at burned down since then.
1219673,pjc,2010-07-16 08:51:00,6,"I fished Uchi in the 70's & early 80's. Was a fantastic fishery then. Would only get better with new limits & slot size restrictions since then.Never stayed at any lodges there, as I lived in the area then."
1219740,Aaron-IN,2010-07-16 11:21:00,500,"PJC...just out of curiosity, how did you get to Uchi? Unless you take a very long portage via Confederate lake and through the deserted little long Lac gold mine town you have to fly in, at least that is how it was back in the 70's-80's, I think it's still a fly in today (although I could be wrong.)"
1219786,pjc,2010-07-16 13:10:00,6,"Aaron-IN, you are correct, we portaged from Confederation.Had a canoe ""stashed"" on Unchi at that time. Would be a great lake to go back to.There was a floating bridge across a swamp on the portage back then, I don't know if the bridge is still there or not."
1219790,Aaron-IN,2010-07-16 13:12:00,500,"Thanks! That was a really nice walk from Confederation to Uchi, I was just a kid back then and still remember it."
