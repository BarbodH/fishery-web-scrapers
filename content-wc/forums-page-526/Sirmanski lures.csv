My first order arrived l;ast week, the gear looks great, I plan on adding more ammo by next spring. The quality, price, and the fact that he helps sponsor the site are all top notch! Keep your hooks sharp and your line tight!"

1198758,Bluff,2010-05-10 12:08:00,152,Just placed and received a couple of orders from Mike and the lures and jigs look to be first class - really nice. I'm sure they'll produce. The service and pricing can't be beat. I'm impressed. Will try them for the first time in a few days - can't wait.

1202641,Mojo-NC,2010-05-21 13:12:00,1931,Thanks for all of the recommendations and for the link - I had never heard of the company previously. It's too late for me to get some Sirmanski baits for this year but I've got the site bookmarked for next year and I also sent the link to all of my buds who like to fish Canada. The bucktail jigs look like they would tear up stripers.
1209535,Bluff,2010-06-12 15:56:00,152,"Used the ""walleye candy"" for the first time last week in Canada - 1/4 ounce gold head chartreuse sparkle tail worked very well in stained water. Others in the group were jealous. Thanks for the suggestion Mike!"

575864,Guest,2008-07-08 09:31:00,0,Just back from Canada trip and used Sirmanski lures for the first time. (Had the old standby lures with me just in case they were needed.) Used these baits all week with really good results. With today's high prices it was good to find lures this good at a value price. It's also good to note Sirmanski is a sponsor on Walleye Central.
575908,Hump,2008-07-09 16:40:00,578,"For those that are interested,his website is www.sirmanski.com. I am anxiously waiting to try his products. He is very knowledgeable of Canadian fishing and that is a plus. Also as stated""he is a regular on Walleye Central."""
576023,Guest,2008-07-14 10:00:00,0,"Just got back from Lake of the Woods and we caught some really nice Smallies on Sirmanski Crankbaits. Also used their jigs and liked them. One guy in our party caught a 30"" Walleye on a Wallski from Sirmanski."
1192539,Mike Kansas,2010-04-23 14:42:00,1463,Thanks Guys
1192554,tooski,2010-04-23 15:31:00,393,Recently bought half a dozen Wallskis. Will be trying them on Abamasagi in June and St Joe's mid July. I'll try to remember to post some opinions when I return.
1193511,Guest,2010-04-26 12:56:00,0,"Started using Sirmanski lures a couple of years ago. First in Canada, then back home. They catch fish and can handle tough treatment. Placed several orders and have always received prompt delivery."
1193839,KevinSB,2010-04-27 07:47:00,73,"Mike also sold me some beautiful lures (primarily the Wallskis) I'm taking to Canada in June. With family stuff, I've not had a chance to try them out locally so am glad to hear they're durable too. And as a new WC member, Mike also provided me some helpful information about fishing rod selection recently.So they look great in hand and sounds like will hold up well. And as a bonus, they were shipped promptly and arrived in great shape."
1193869,polaris-pete,2010-04-27 08:56:00,343,I also just ordered some jigs and crankbaits from him. He was very helpful on my order and look forward to trying out his jigs and crankbaits up to Pasha Lake in June. Thanks for putting his website link on here for us.
1195250,polaris-pete,2010-04-30 15:25:00,343,I just got an assortment of Mike's jigs and several of his crankbaits. The jigs are 1st rate with very high quality paint jobs and the crankbaits were just as nice. The paint quality and colors are just as good as the big name manufactuers.Shipping was very reasonable and quick! Thanks again.
1197333,Guest,2010-05-06 09:49:00,0,"I have been buying jigs and lures from Mike for a couple of years. They are top quality and I have had excellent customer service and prompt shipping from Mike. He is great to work with and is a pretty good walleye fishman, so he says...."
