The fishing was good, but not as good as in past years. Being a smallmouth fisherman, I did have difficulty locating the bigger female smallmouth, but did catch a largemouth at McFarland rapids. I averaged around 20-25 smallmouth a day, with various pike and walleye thrown in as extras. One of my daughters caught two 18 inch and one 17 inch smallmouth on a baby torpedo, mainly over sparse weeds near large rock boulders in 5-7 feet of water in Big Sand. One son-in-law caught a 41.5 inch muskie and a small Tiger Muskie. The other son-in-law caught a 32 inch muskie. They have never caught muskie before so it was a treat for them. The largest pike caught was 35.5 inches. Largest walleye was 25 inches. So size was generally down. I like to fish other techniques, and one was trolling and casting jig spinners with 2-3 inch Berkley Power Grubs in Hidden Lake across from Minaki. In 2 hours we caught 17 walleyes in 6-7 feet of water, with one 20 incher and three 19 inchers. The last night I caught a 22 inch walleye in Hidden Lake trolling in 8 feet of water. It seemed like everything was 3 weeks further in the year fishing wise. We usually go in early June. Next year I will try to go the second full week of June and hopefully the bigger smallmouth will be more accessible. The weather was outstanding with highs in the 70-77 temperature range and not much rain after the arrival day on June 3rd. Hope all have great trips, Don"

1218250,Aaron-IN,2010-07-12 09:04:00,500,"Don,Nice report. There is a narrow window every spring to get into the big females in great numbers and that of coarse (as you know already) depends on the ice out the weather conditions. If you are targeting big smallies you really should take a look at September up there. I've caught as many big smallies in the fall than I have in the spring.Aaron"
1218346,DonC,2010-07-12 14:12:00,93,"Randy, The water level is normal. Someone put a buoy on the rocks in the entrance so staying real close on the left of the marker you can get in without much problem. Watch out for the unmarked rocks about 100 yards or so in front of the entrance. Be nice if someone marked them also. I recommend back trolling jig spinners (gold blades I like best) with grubs in 6-9 feet of water for walleye. Aaron, I have never patterned the big smallmouth in September, but have read some on it. Do you have any suggested patterns to use in September. Thanks, Don"
1218361,Aaron-IN,2010-07-12 14:54:00,500,They pretty much go on a prolonged feeding frenzy in the fall. There are always good numbers in and around any islands and when you find them in deeper water they are normally schooled up and chasing baitfish. You would be surprised how many you can catch fishing the same pattern you would in the spring.
1219152,DonC,2010-07-14 16:17:00,93,"Aaron, Are they still shallow on the islands, or down around 15-20 feet of water off the shoreline? Thanks, Don"
1219272,Aaron-IN,2010-07-15 06:15:00,500,"Well, it really depends on when you are there in September and what the weather and water temps are. Last year they were still deep because it was still really warm. For the most part you can still catch them shallow depending on the time of day."
