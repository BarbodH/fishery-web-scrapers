1218744,SinOrSwim,2010-07-13 17:21:00,1528,"I believe it's all electronic. If someone has gotten through it could be because they took the passport but didn't actually run it through the system. Be prepared to be turned back. We see it about every other year it seems. A group sitting around discussing what they are going to do. Some groups will ALL turn around and some just make the guy who can't cross turn around. Last one I saw the whole group said they would turn around and the border people were like.....no, no, no, no...you don't ALL have to. It was interesting. Our group has always said if someone cant' go across they are on their own. More than likely get a ride to a local place to stay and find someone to take us fishing while the rest of the group goes on. Good luck. Seems like a silly rule to me. Essentially a life long sentence for what is a night of bad decision making. A little over the top."

If you have not already read the sticky by Juls posted at the top of this board. It gives you all the info anyone would need and explains how you can apply for a ""pass"". It's worth the read!"
1218792,go dart,2010-07-13 18:59:00,77,We had a 3 yr old dui in our group and I watched the border officer scan all the passports. He just handed em back after being assured we didn't have any fireworks and let us pass. I think he would want a reason to do more than a simple scan.
1218846,MorganMan,2010-07-13 21:12:00,341,I thought the passports might change things as far as those whose who might get across unchecked. I don't know what the passport shows other than identity and where you live. It used to be that every so many people would be brought in for immigration checks and that's where these things would be brought to light. Can someone in the border area shed some light on what information the passport gives? I have told those in the past that have an issue that they may need to find their way back if needed. We have a clean group each year with the exception of the occasional deliquents! lol
1218916,rdunk,2010-07-14 06:19:00,20,So what I'm hearing is this: OWI will show up if they scan your passport? They must have some nice border crossing people because the person involved (not complaining) said they could see them scan the passport
1219330,jjwritz,2010-07-15 09:11:00,12,as far as i know there is no state info on except for where you were born---my buddy and i crossed this year--he had a dui 3 years ago---passports were scanned nothing was said---i am sure if dui info was on there something would have been said----when i went inside to pay duty on extra beer they requested and scanned my drivers license---first time that ever happenned....
1219377,Guest,2010-07-15 10:55:00,0,"After 9/11. the Canadian C&I system began to access to criminal records in the US, at the request of the US government. Since several of the 9/11 hijackers entered the US through Canada, the US requested that the Canadians begin using US databases as well as their own when determining admissibility. As a result, information on past offenses that hadn't been visible to the Canadians were available to them. The policy about past DUIs had been on the books in Canada for decades, but identifying individuals who were inadmissible as a result of past criminal records wasn't possible to the degree it is now. At first the rules were a lot tighter than they are now. I think at the time ANY past DUI made you inadmissible unless you went through rehabilitation (a legal process required by the Canadians.) I knew guys that had been going to Canada annually for years that were getting turned back because of records from their teens. In part because of pressure form the tourism industry, they've relaxed that quite a bit in the past few years. It doesn't seem to me that they check your full record in every case when you cross the border even though they do scan your passport. But if they do a full check, and you have something on your record...they'll find it."
1219946,JinxCanada,2010-07-16 22:45:00,1306,PLEASE GET YOUR FACTS STRAIGHT!!! NOT ONE SINGLE 9/11 TERRORIST ENTERED THE USA FROM CANADA!!! THIS HAS BEEN PROVEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN! please do not speak out of turn..or at least educate yourself as to the facts before you post something like this!
