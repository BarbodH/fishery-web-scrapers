1214665,jsmyers,2010-06-29 20:01:00,198,"I could have swore that there were 3 camps on that side of the lake, one across from Gawley's, and two where past where the lake gets wider. I guess the fact that I was wrong is one reason that I couldn't find the name or the website of the 3rd camp."
1215379,Kevin R,2010-07-02 05:39:00,305,Some spots may have two names I can tell you the painted rock was just off Birch Island/Birch point it on the big lake a very heavy fished area across from devils point going towards wine lake/ wilderness camp. Green scum bay is the bay past Aerobus bay to the north. Moose bay is south end of wabby heading towards Keynote but left just past the roost. Will explain more soon have to go for now.
1215413,jsmyers,2010-07-02 08:00:00,198,"Thanks Kevin,That narrows the list down a bit. This is what I still can't locate:Duck PointSandy BeachBeavers DamEagle's NestGull RockHalfway BayThe roostRed Cabin IslandYou're post isn't 100% clear to me however. I know where Birch Island is. Is Birch Point the round point the the NE of the island? Or are the island and the point one in the same (underwater there whole thing functions like a point)?Painted rock is the tiny island due south of Peffley's, and in the middle of the opening heading north, correct?"
1219888,Kevin R,2010-07-16 18:22:00,305,Not the one I think of.I have fished the south end more than the north end thus the names we became used to may not match what other use. The big lake was a long haul in the early 1970's 3-tanks of fuel 6 gal per to be safe & chugging along at about 15mph with a 20-30hp on a 14-16ft tin boat taking a beating & getting soaked from spray on a windy day. Today my boat tops 50 mph & eats up any waves these small lakes make.

1213920,jsmyers,2010-06-27 14:11:00,198,"Kevin,I've never heard most of those names. I'm hoping to get some help learning were they are so I know the names of the places I'm familiar with.After looking back through the thread, these are still the names that are unknown to me:Painted RockBirch PointDuck PointSandy BeachBeavers DamEagle's NestGull RockBirch IslandMoose BayHalfway BayGreenscum BayThe roostNorth BayRed Cabin IslandAny help in learning is appreciated. I'm family with the lake, so describing places to me is fine, I just wasn't told of the names."
1214386,Stu,2010-06-28 23:16:00,472,"I couldn't find Red Cabin Island on any of the maps. It think it is the island that was owned by a guy named Ted. He was a retired Border Patrol agent from the early days. He used to come by and visit us at Tall Pines. From what I remember, he actually owned the island and it had been in his family for years. He was about 80 when I last talked to him and I think he passed away. He knew more about that lake than anyone I had ever met and was my go-to-guy when I couldn't find any walleye. If anyone else knows more about him, let us know."
1214435,jsmyers,2010-06-29 07:45:00,198,I know that on the south side of the big lake is Doe Island and the point to the SE is Devil's point. What is the point to the west of Doe Island known as?Is is Birch or Duck Point?
1214471,jsmyers,2010-06-29 09:50:00,198,"Based on their names and a couple of other clues, I'm guessing that Halfway and North Bays are the triangular-shaped bays off of the big lake, with Halfway Bay to the south (next to Devil's Point), and North Bay to the Northwest.Is this correct?"
1214536,JAY221,2010-06-29 14:14:00,877,"The second island southwest of the Big Rock/Big Nose was referred to as Bat Island by the folks @ Kingfisher. The reason is quite obvious to me looking @ the google map. Later, Jay"
1214542,jsmyers,2010-06-29 14:29:00,198,"Thanks Jay. I never noticed that. I don't remember doing a lot of fishing around there either, but it looks like on my map that the area to the south of that island has a lot of potential.Also, can somebody tell me what the name of the camp right next to Tall Pines is? I believe there are two on the eastern shore of that basin (beyond where the lake gets wide). Am I mistaken? If not, is Tall Pines the northern or southern of the two?"
1214555,JAY221,2010-06-29 15:12:00,877,"Tall pines is on the North end of the channel out from the falls into the lake. South of it is a few houses & then Kingfishers with the green buildings. Later, Jay"
1214598,JAY221,2010-06-29 17:25:00,877,"If you follow around the point & go south from Jim & Julies & stay to the left you will enter Ruby Lake. If you do the same thing but stay to the right you will enter Keystone Lake. Later, Jay"
1214664,jsmyers,2010-06-29 19:59:00,198,"I've learned that I was wrong about North Bay, and that North Bay is another name for McLeod Bay. Still not sure about Halfway Bay."
1212941,jsmyers,2010-06-23 13:11:00,198,"(Edit: I've made some updates to the map, described in other posts.)I've read a lot of post on this board about Wabaskang Lake, which I fished a lot when I was a kid (haven't been back since about 1995). People are using a lot of place names that I'm not familiar with, though I do know the lay of the lake pretty well.Can anybody help me know where these places are:The HotelDevils PointDoe IslandPainted RockBirch PointDuck PointSandy BeachBeavers DamEagle's NestI gather that Aerobus bay is the bay where the creek from Aerobus Lake feeds into. I've seen a few maps online that show a few place names (Gawley's and McLeod Bays), but not many.Also, what are the conventions in referring to the narrows?This is how I understand things: (Google Map I made)Does this agree with others?I've also marked what we called ""big rock,"" an island with a steep cliff. I wonder if one of those names above is actually for this island.Because I'm new on this forum, let me know if I'm breaking rules or conventions of the community, and I'll fix my mistakes.About me: My grandfather took us fishing in Wabaskang pretty much every year until about 1995, when his mobility declined. We stayed at Gawley's and fished for pike almost exclusively. I was jealous of other's walleye catches, and we eventually figured out how to catch them if we decided we wanted to. (We'd slowly troll a crawler on some kind of weighted spinner at the end of what I've labeled on the map above as the second narrows late in the evening.)I'm hoping to organize the clan to go back next year. (My grandfather passed in 2007.) If we do, I'm hoping to try to do a bit of trout fishing, maybe try for whitefish, and maybe put in a better effort for 'eyes; but I'm sure we'll mostly target pike."

I didn't spend much time in that part of the lake when I used to go up there, so I guess I never learned their names."
1213316,go dart,2010-06-24 19:33:00,77,I think its an awsome post. Usually fish Perrault but always been curious bout Waba. Fun to see it on google
1213321,bjoern,2010-06-24 19:54:00,89,I have been there only once and that was about 10 years ago. We did well at Devils point with a leech on a split shot after dragging spinners and jigging with no luck. A native showed us that little trick. It was as low tech as I have fished since a crawler head 6 inches below a bobber for bluegills as a kid. I certainly learned quite a bit from that man about simple approaches. We fished mostly on the near side of the point. My brother got a nice northern just outside the end of the narrows you go through to get to that part of the lake. Wish I could be of more help.Brad
1213419,jsmyers,2010-06-25 08:35:00,198,I've been reading board archives and I have another name to add to my list of unknowns: Gull Rock
1213449,Guest,2010-06-25 11:08:00,0,Mud lake is in the wrong place and Harbeson falls has always been known as Williams falls named after Art Williams who built Wine Lake Camp. Big Rock is also known as Big Nose to others. I have a good map of the lake that shows all of the names you are looking for. Maybe I could scan it and send it to you. My good friend at Sleepy Dog Cabins explained all of the names to me one evening.
1213461,jsmyers,2010-06-25 12:16:00,198,"I would really appreciate it if you could send me the map.Because you are posting as a guest, I assume that you can't private message me.Take the spaces out of this email address and you can contact me:myers 8 (at) clemson (dot) eduThanks!"

1213596,Stu,2010-06-26 02:36:00,472,"Wow, awesome post! I never knew those lakes had names. The Hotel is the narrows between Gawley's Bay and Mean Lake. Supposedly named because walleyes check in there for the night. I'm heading up July 10 - 17. If any of you guys are going to be there, let me know."
1213597,Stu,2010-06-26 02:41:00,472,"There is also a sunken island somewhere between the big peninsula and the little finger sticking out of mean lake. I found it one year by accident. Lots of BIG pike and a nice musky followed our lures, but we didn't boat any. I also saw a smaller musky on the northeast side of Doe island. Couldn't get him to hit either, but he hung around for about an hour."
