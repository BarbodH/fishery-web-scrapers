1219027,dkrusin,2010-07-14 10:57:00,97,I ask a question on what happened to the Lac Suel Outpost thread and it also gets deleted. Whats going on??? I read on the thread both good and bad about the resort. Thats why I read this board. I want information from it's members. Our group spends close to 10 grand a year in Canada and I look to this forum for unbiased information. I certainly hope the moderators of WC are not going to change this. Or are they changing it for just certain individuals. I guess I'd like some answers..
1219053,Fishing Traveler,2010-07-14 11:42:00,19,I agree completely...The title could have been edited or even the first post deleted but why delete the entire thread. I thought both sides were well represented. There was lots of good information for anyone considering that resort/lodge. Forums are one of the best ways to get good information...That's why I frequent this great board. Chris
1219148,Golden,2010-07-14 15:47:00,2172,"dkruisin.....Did you need more information than that thread contained?You obviously read the thread, you should have got everything you wanted from it.....what else did you want to read from it?There was good and bad....that makes it even....right?Why do you want to keep that thread online?It ran its course, it turned into bashing and personal vendettas and neither of those are allowed so I deleted it.There was nothing else to be learned from that thread.If someone starts a thread about you and then others come in (that don't even know you) and start piling on......would you want it to remain?There were people commenting on that post that had admittedly never even been to that lodge.....and yet they were commenting on it?How does that work?It ran it's course, it became a bashfest and I nuked it.End of story.....move on"
1219349,dkrusin,2010-07-15 09:56:00,97,"Golden: I agree personal bashing is not a good thing and should not be allowed. Is it not possible to ""NUKE"" the bad (personal bashing) post rather then the entire thread? Anyway, I'm over it and moving on...Thanks, dkrusin"
1219417,Golden,2010-07-15 13:00:00,2172,"Yea, I could have deleted 95% of the responses and left it up there but what do you think would happen then?It would just start over.......how does that make sense?Everyone that needed to get any value from that thread got it......it no longer offered value.In fact.....it was the opposite.Glad to hear you moved on.This thread will self destruct."
