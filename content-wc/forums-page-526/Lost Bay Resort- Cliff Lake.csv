1217246,Skyraptor,2010-07-08 13:03:00,291,"Thinking about going to Lost Bay in late August. Can anyone tell me about the camp and how it is run? Is there a main lodge, are the cabins ok? How are the owners? Is the fishing decent and if so where on the lake do you find the walleyes and smallmouth? Any information would be appreciated."
1217275,Silverwiskers,2010-07-08 14:23:00,5,"The good LORD willing , I'll be at Lost Bay the first week of August. Have been there many times ( started going there in 1992). Have not been there for 4 years ( been doing a fly in lake the last 4 years). There are a ton of smallmouth, the walleye are a little more work but have caught my 4 largest ones there (28"" to 31"" ). I don't know how the new owners are, but have been treated just fine by all the other owners.I will post when we get back and let you know how we did."
1217389,Obabikon,2010-07-08 20:29:00,2370,"Well... not sure what all went down with Rose and John leaving, but... they absolutely loved it. The new owner (who was their partner) took over when the partners couldn't get along. I really like Rose and John... not sure what all happened, but the fact that they loved the place so much would make me suggest it."
1217500,Skyraptor,2010-07-09 08:32:00,291,Well if Lost Bay is out of the question then what other place would others suggest? It would be myself and my girlfriend who has never fished before and we are looking at a place near Cliff Lake or Perrault Falls for a 3 or 4 day trip with Housekeeping and is not expensive. Lost Bay had 4 day trip under $400.00 plus a 10% discount. Have fished Cedar Lake and Perrault Lake as well years ago. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
1217505,Obabikon,2010-07-09 08:44:00,2370,"I wouldn't say Lost Bay should be out of the question. Just giving you the information I know. But, I'm not well versed in that area, so can't suggest another resort."

1217620,Brian884,2010-07-09 15:36:00,8,"I am also going to Lost Bay Resort on Cliff Lake the end of August. I have not been there either but everyone who I have talked to up there has been really helpfull. I got a few references from the lodge of people who have been going there for years and they love it there. Call Jan at the Lodg she is very helpfull. I'm going blind as well. Good luck, may see you up there."
