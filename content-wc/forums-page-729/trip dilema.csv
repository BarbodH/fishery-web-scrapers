The walleye fishing has been good but with the annoying park fees and the cost of gas, (we trailer our boats with us) we are considering trying Ramsey lake in Ontario. Not the one in Sudbury. The thought is we could all travel in one vehicle and we already have ontario non-resident licences. The camp we would use provides everything. I would appreciate anyone's coments on recent fishing in the lake. Thanks"
