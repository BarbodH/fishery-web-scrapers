Small to me means 14"" to 20"". There were many of this size to go around. We troll the bay with leadcore and shad raps at 10' to 16'. The fish were in all the usual spots on the rocks and flats. We used at times very neutral colors (gray/black) compared to other years when we caught them on bright colors. We caught 15 to 20 greenbacks a day. So we were kept interested. Our biggest was 23.5"" for 2.5 days of fishing. I didn't see many others catch anything bigger than about 23-24"". Fish were also caught on jigs by many people around us. It doesn't really matter in the bay if you are right on a certain spot, just be near robinson rock and to the south. Like I say if you have been there before, you will see the fish are in their usual spots. Have fun we did. 70 degree temps and the sun in our faces sure felt good for once at pine falls. I have been there when I had snow and wind so high that we couldn't do anything. Water temps were 58.6 in bay and 56 at devils island. Mike Mortenson"
