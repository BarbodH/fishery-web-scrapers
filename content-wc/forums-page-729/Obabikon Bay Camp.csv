Last year we only had 3 of us in our group (instead of the usual 8), which I think annoyred our host. Great location, gruff service. I was never sure if the gruffness was just because our genial host was burned out after a long year of dealing with guests, or if he is that way all the time. This year we called him to let him know we wanted to come back, and he said he's closing a week earlier than the dates we planned to come. So we are staying somewhere else. Now I have seen on this board that the place is for sale, which does not surprise me. Anyone else have similar experiences? I love the location of the lodge, but I'm sort of relieved I don't have to deal with ""gruff steve"" any more.... Drift Sock"
