There is four times the normal amount of flow thru the Hydro Dam, the water is murky, and for what we did catch..........I've thrown back bigger perch. Hopefully they cut the water flow back before you get there and things start returning to normal. They had alot of rain in Alberta a little awhile ago, and it all goes thru Tobin via north and south Sask River system"
