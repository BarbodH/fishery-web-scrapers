552474,Guest,2005-10-03 15:38:00,0,"Tmac I heard that the fishing is picking up....supposedly they closed the 3 gates that have been open the past few weeks....things should be slowing and the fishing should pick up. Some guys from town were up prefishing for the tourney and they caught fish (28s, 30,s but no over 31.5s)....I will try and talk with them this week. Not sure how they did in the tourney. The results aren't posted online yet that I can find. Clarkie"

552484,Guest,2005-10-04 07:46:00,0,Tmac I also heard it was the Folden boys....they are younger guys...my age or close (32). They fish a lot of the tournaments in Sask (Sask Walleye Trail). I haven't seen any official results yet though. See you this weekend maybe! I will be pulling in sometime Saturday PM. Clarkie

If you scroll down the page there is a link to an article that has a list of everybody who entered.http://www.nipawinjournal.com/ Here is the Vanity Cup's site.http://www.vanitycup.ca/
