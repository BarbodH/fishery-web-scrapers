552109,Guest,2005-09-14 10:13:00,0,"OK, the rest of you Loomis sales reps, get your testimonials in ASAP! :-))"
552111,Guest,2005-09-14 13:07:00,0,"Your on to us Mohleye, just keep fishing with that broomstick. It will save you money on film because you wont need a camera to have any pictures taken of you with fish...EH!!"
552122,Guest,2005-09-15 07:22:00,0,"G Loomis Rods are great,. I use the 8 foot model continually. I put a koozie on the end with duct tape. I can hand all the guys in the boat a beer without leaving my seat."
552124,Guest,2005-09-15 09:05:00,0,"In 26 trips to Canada, I can think of two days when the bite was so subtle a Loomis rod would have made a slight difference. If you think you need a $200.00 rod to catch walleye, you're probably right."
552127,Guest,2005-09-15 10:12:00,0,"mohleye, Cant say I disagree with you. I have been on 80+++ trips to Canada Walleye fishing and have only fished with a Loomis Rod for one day of that time. But I will tell you that I really believe I felt more bites and all bites better with the Loomis Rod. Anyhow I now own one and while it seems extravagent to own one I think I will get more enjoyment of the Loomis Rod than my brother will get out of his new $400 Golf Driver."
552128,Guest,2005-09-15 10:31:00,0,I'd go with the golf driver. Not only can you play golf but you can club the fish with it.....lets see ya do that with your high dollar rod.
552131,Guest,2005-09-15 12:59:00,0,"Dave, It is not a ""High Dollar Rod"".... ""It is an instrument of sensitivity and perfection placed in the hand of a man who would rather fish than do anything else in world except hold his Grandchildren"""
552134,Guest,2005-09-15 13:46:00,0,"An instrument of sensitivity and perfection. I thought you were describing my girl friend. Wish I could say the same about my wife. Oh well you may be right, besides a guy can only own so many Wal-Mart rods."
552148,Guest,2005-09-16 08:52:00,0,"Selling, Can't say I disagree with you, either. I've used a Loomis before, and they do make a fine rod. And at least your lure will go pretty much where you intended, which may be more than your brother can say for his driver."
551997,Guest,2005-09-09 18:11:00,0,"I bought a new G Loomis rod yesterday and it is the first time I ever fished with one. Im here to tell you that it is without a doubt the best rod I have ever fished with. Its sensitivity, power and hook setting ability is unmatched when compared with other rods I have used in the last 15 years of Walleye fishing. You might think they cost to much but why fish out of your $20,000 boat with anything other than the best rod you can buy."
552000,haybaylarry,2005-09-09 19:33:00,55,I agree with you 100%. I have had loomis rods for about 20 years now and won't think of using anything else...Larry
552004,Guest,2005-09-10 07:04:00,0,"I fish with mostly St Croix rods paired with a Shimano Symetre. I agree that there is a difference between a cheap rod, and a quality rod. You feel so much more than a cheap one. I have relatives in Park Falls, so on the yearly trips, I have to stop at the factory. My wife just thinks I like to spend money and does not understand the 27 rod/reels in the basement. Last year we went out with a guide on Lac Seul and was humbled. I had my combo that cost around $300, and he had a cheap plastic Quantum, with a whippy rod. They were not much nicer than a Snoopy rod and real...and he outfished me 4 to 1 in the same boat. I gave the guide an older combo I had that I take along as an ""in case one breaks"" for one of my friends. Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't G Loomis get bought out a few years ago?"
552010,wpgsteve,2005-09-10 14:41:00,3,"Yes , i think gloomis did sell a few years ago, but the rod still seems to have the same high quality standards as it did before.www.ManitobaAnglers.com"
552013,Ohio fisherman,2005-09-10 20:59:00,989,Try this for a nice combo. A Loomis 7 foot walleye 2-piece rod with a Shimano Sustain reel. That is a buttery smooth combo and will really catch the fish.
