552422,retire55,2005-09-30 10:22:00,1029,"rebelm2001 and others: I sent an email to the appropriate office ([email protected]) to obtain more information about such tax refunds. Here's the response I received today. 1) A non-resident of Canada may claim 50% of the GST/HST paid on a fishing package, as it is ususally made up of an accommodation component as well as several other ineligible components (e.g. rentals, transportation, meals, gas, etc). Should the receipt have a breakdown, the GST/HST paid on accommodations would be refundable at 100%. 2) Procedures are in place to review and adjust applications accordingly. For example: over claimed amounts and fund conversions. 3) Invoices that clearly indicate they are charged in US funds are converted to Canadian funds for system acceptance. The conversion is based on a rate obtained from the Bank of Canada. All cheques mailed by the Visitor Rebate Program, to the United States, are issued in U.S. dollars to minimize the cost of cashing the cheque. If at any time a visitor feels their rebate has not been processed accurately, they may request a reassessment of their application by email, phone, or mail. Their application will be reviewed at that time. They will receive a response and any applicable cheque by mail. If you require more information regarding the Visitor Rebate Program, please visit our website at www.ccra.gc.ca/visitors or you may write or call our office at the following address or phone numbers: VISITOR REBATE PROGRAM SUMMERSIDE TAX CENTRE CANADA CUSTOMS & REVENUE AGENCY 275 POPE ROAD SUMMERSIDE PE C1N 5Z7 CANADA Or call: Toll free from anywhere in Canada 1-800-668-4748 From outside Canada 1-902-432-5608"

I cross the border from Canada to the US every week-end from May to October and I buy all my stuff on the US side and can't get anything back from Mr. Taxes. Lucky you (even if sometimes it take a while to get it back).:)"
552445,Jesse-WI,2005-10-01 21:36:00,534,"All of the various notes at the duty free store in Fort Frances say the same thing. The other item of note is that you can also get the tax back on purchases greater than $50CDN for things you do not consume. Examples include, boat batteries, fishing rods, etc."
552466,JDP,2005-10-03 12:03:00,1457,"I applied for a refund on June 7th and recived the exact refund ($104.92) on September 9th. Applied with: Canadasalestaxrefunds.com PMB 186-816 Peace Portal Drive Blaine, Washington 98230 USA"
552159,rebelrn2001,2005-09-18 12:44:00,1563,"We (mistakenly) went through Custom House Currency Exchange by mail to get our GST refund after our trip this past spring. They get a fee for doing so (I found out later by reading the small print). To date, we still haven't gotten our $ back (about $64). I've emailed them a couple times. The most recent email back said 'if we hear from them (the Canadian Customs and Revenue Agency), we will process your refund'. I emailed back ""IF you hear from, what do you mean IF""? I suggested they pursue it to find out further what the problem is (it's been about 3 months now). Anyway, I'm wondering if anyone has a phone number to the above Canadian agency to see if I can submit my COPIES of my receipts as I don't have the originals (they were sent to this Custom House outfit). Thanks."
552160,Reels,2005-09-18 14:24:00,2876,"Sounds like maybe you were scammed? Maybe you can contact a the local cop shop and maybe they have some info on them. Worth a shot. If you got screwed, probably others did too. <{{}}><"
552161,Trailerguy,2005-09-18 15:21:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]GST would fall under the Ministry of Finance, general inquirys 800-263-7965, retail sales tax 807-625-5840 . I've been told in the past that they require the original reciept in order to keep unscrupulous individuals from filing for multiple refunds. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
552164,rebelrn2001,2005-09-18 18:43:00,1563,"Nah, I belive it is a legit company BUT, they have brochures in motels/hotels in Canada and they kind of made it look like I was dealing directly w/the Canadian Govt (until I read the fine print AFTER I sent it in). We got the brochure at the Makabi Inn.....no fault of theirs I'm sure. This company has returned my emails so far each time but this time when they said ""IF"" that made me mad. They need to step to the plate and investigate...not wait for the Canadians to find my info some where. Thanks for the phone #'s so far."

552210,Lovetofish,2005-09-21 14:18:00,458,"Just got mine back after 6 weeks. Mailed my GST form direct. Never had any problem not getting the refund, but they shafted me again on the exchange. Paid US at the resort, and it's clearly marked on the receipt, but they considered it paid in Canadian. About half the time they get it right."

Our resort accepts payment only in US funds. The receipt was marked as being in US funds, but they reduced the amount they paid us by dividing by 1.25, the exchange rate in the wrong direction. Same thing each of the two years we applied for the refund. I think it is deliberate, they do this on purpose hoping you won't hassle them for an additional $15 or so."
