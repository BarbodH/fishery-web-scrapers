I can't believe this, the government is out to get me. Come on, times change. Prices go up. It's called inflation. The passport thing is a pain, but let's get real, we have had way too lax of rules for entry into the U.S. Remember 9/11? I guess if you have to pay $400 for all of you then it's $40 a year instead of $10 a year. If that's too much, then I guess staying home is your other option."

Our property taxes jumped over 30% last year with another large increase coming. We usually rotate between the children and Grandchildren each year on our trips, and yes they do pay there way. They have also stated that they will not go when passports are required as it will add up to $500 extra for one of my Daughters, and $400 for each of my other 2 Daughters.

This is exactly the problem that caused your first 9/11. Like I said, the threat to ""homeland security"" is not in Canada, it's in America. It's embedded in the belief America controls the world, that the American way is the only way, and in the ""You're either with us or against us"" (Bush) bullying approach. And of course all along, using such crap to pull the wool over the eyes of the American public when ultimately the people making the decisions are simply using fear to get $billions$ more for defense contracts and get a more direct hand in oil money. Yes, the rest of the world understands this, and yes, the rest of the world (particularly those with much less economic fortune) are infuriated by this. The anger is so immense toward American greed and oppression that radical people feel they need to commit huge, over-the-top acts of chaos and destruction (i.e., 9/11) in the hopes that maybe, JUST MAYBE, the American public will wake up, acknowledge such inappropriate actions and stop. But instead the towers go down, and rather than ask WHY?, Why would somebody (or a group of people) want to do this to us? What is it that we have done which would cause somebody to want to commit such horrific acts?, you sit and point the finger at who and where and how!! The question is why?!! Instead of answering why, the powers that be use fear and anger to justify a war against a country that had nothing to do with 9/11 (but coincidentally has a lot of oil, hmmmmmmm?), which will only further infuriate those others, and WILL lead to more acts of destruction. The greatest threat to America sits in the White House, and in the Pentagon, and in the World Trade Centre, etc. That was the message being sent at 9/11 and perhaps not surprisingly it 'flew way over the head' of the American public, thanks in part to the heavily edited media.

552572,Guest,2005-10-10 05:08:00,0,"You talk as if $100 is nothing, when you combine this cost with the energy prices and the rising property taxes, it is one more burden for people on a fixed income. I called to see if there will be any special price for the disabled or children that just go to Canada for a fishing trip once a year, the answer is no. I also asked if this fee can be paid yearly, the answer is no. We have a Daughter and 3 Grandchildren going with us next year. After that it is very questionable if we would be able to pay for the rising costs of everything associated with our trips to Canada. We would hope that the politicians would use some common sense when it comes to US citizens fishing and hunting in the great country of Canada. Also the citizens that cross the border to shop. Or is this just another way for the politicians to raise revenue? Ron"

552546,Guest,2005-10-10 08:07:00,0,A drivers license is the most counterfeited document in the United States. Any illegal person and criminal can even get a driver's license. The guys that crashed planes into the N.Y. buildings on 9/11 had valid driver's licenses.
552523,TKCENTERLINE,2005-10-09 09:18:00,24,"I heard that by 2007 or earlier depending on how you will be traveling by air or land, everyone crossing the Canadian border will require a passport. O boy another cost!!! Does anyone know if this is true and what are the rules? If so what is the dead line and how much will this cost to get a passport. I have never gotten a passport before. Help!!"
552524,Guest,2005-10-09 10:11:00,0,You're looking at a hundred or so. Go to post office for for details.:cheers:

552527,Hump,2005-10-09 15:07:00,578,I just got mine in July and it cost $112.00. That is in Iowa.
552528,Guest,2005-10-09 15:30:00,0,How long are they good for?I will get one but I hope they are good for more then one year.$100 is alot of cash if you go to canada for 1 week out of the whole year.
552529,rpieske,2005-10-09 15:58:00,1276,Used to be good for 10 years.
552531,Guest,2005-10-09 18:37:00,0,"This is not set in stone, not by a long shot! Many of the border state politicians, senators, etc. are really against this, as it inevitably will reduce international tourism, cross-border shopping and so on, on both sides of the border. To paraphrase a North Dakota politician from a business meeting on this and other issues from the other day: ""Look, here is my identification information (holding up his Driver's License). Why do I need to pay $100 for something else that says the same thing. What a joke!"" Who really thinks that needing a passport will stop the cross-border movement of the people whom this is actually intended for? At best, this is a $100 tax on people who want to go fishing, or skiing, or shopping. I think it goes without saying but this is obviously not a Canadian initiative! And, again I think this goes without saying, but the threat to America is not in Canada, it's in America! So yes, we know up here north of the border there is lots of opposition to such a measure, but if you're watching CNN or FOX, then you probably don't hear anything about it. Ooooohh, I'm so scared, lock my doors, put a wall and a gate around my community, Terror is coming to get me!!!! NWO Fishing Bum"
552535,Guest,2005-10-09 22:51:00,0,"You will need a passport to return to the states (maybe). It is not a canadian border issue. Talk to your homeland security people. Do not be so jumpy to ""blame Canada"" for everything."
552536,Guest,2005-10-10 03:09:00,0,"Rainylker is correct the passport is needed to get back into the states..... ""To paraphrase a North Dakota politician from a business meeting on this and other issues from the other day: ""Look, here is my identification information (holding up his Driver's License). Why do I need to pay $100 for something else that says the same thing. What a joke!"""" Now thie ND politician is a little off-base....Canada does not see the the driver's license as a legal identification...as the border gaurd informed me, ""It only means that you can drive legally in that state!"" A birth certificate and/or passport is still needed to get into Canada. $100 for 10 years? People are actually bawling over this? $10 per year? Heck, I just paid $9.00 for a dozen willowcats. I bet that a lot fishermen don't leave a bait store with $10 of items. $10 per year is not that big of a deal. Heck, it probably cost you that much in gas waiting in line to get in or out - lol. Just rip lips and keep a tight line."
552538,Guest,2005-10-10 05:08:00,0,"You talk as if $100 is nothing, when you combine this cost with the energy prices and the rising property taxes, it is one more burden for people on a fixed income. I called to see if there will be any special price for the disabled or children that just go to Canada for a fishing trip once a year, the answer is no. I also asked if this fee can be paid yearly, the answer is no. We have a Daughter and 3 Grandchildren going with us next year. After that it is very questionable if we would be able to pay for the rising costs of everything associated with our trips to Canada. We would hope that the politicians would use some common sense when it comes to US citizens fishing and hunting in the great country of Canada. Also the citizens that cross the border to shop. Or is this just another way for the politicians to raise revenue? Ron"
