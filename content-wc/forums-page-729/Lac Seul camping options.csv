I have e-mailed them all, and none of them have gotten back to me. Goose Bay Camp Evergreen Lodge Golden Fawn Lodge Golden Eagle Resort Whitewing Resort Lac Seul Lodge Some of these have the same e-mail address, whats up with that? Also, if you have camped at one of these places, can you please let me know how you liked it? Also, do you suggest this larger body of Lac Seul for guys in 14/16 foot boats, 25hp motors?"

With that size of boat I might suggest you try below the dam on the English River. Check out Little Canada camp which is just below the dam. While those boats are o.k. on most days, there can be some nasty rollers on the big part of the lake."
