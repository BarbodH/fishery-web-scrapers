552420,Guest,2005-09-30 08:17:00,0,looks like they're heating up....both on the red and at pine falls. heading out mid next week to avoid the weekend rush. (I live in Winnipeg)
552427,Guest,2005-09-30 18:59:00,0,"Pardon my ignorance, but what is a greenback?"
552428,Guest,2005-09-30 19:44:00,0,"greenbacks are walleye that have taken on a distinctive emerald green coloring from the water they live in. I've been told it is due to the limestone in the water. Primarly Lake Winnipeg. In the fall there is a huge migration of fish from Lake Winnipeg to the rivers. Take a look thru the photo gallaries for the Winnipeg/Red River. Should be a lot of ""greenbacks"" in there. Roger"
552454,Guest,2005-10-02 18:50:00,0,"Thanks for the response. I'm curious about how they look, I'll check out the pictures."
552455,Guest,2005-10-02 20:15:00,0,"I heard some comments too that they are genetically different than ""regular"" wallye, and do get bigger. I think the best analogy is that a Greenback is to a Walleye what a Steelhead is to a Rainbow trout. Migratory and has access to big food to be a big fish."
552477,Guest,2005-10-03 20:30:00,0,How about a Greenback is like comparing a US Dollar to a CN Dollar.....same thing only bigger.
552491,Guest,2005-10-04 16:37:00,0,"A greenback in not genetically different and not bigger then a 'normal"" walleye. The do get big in that system but thats just that the system is full of food and lots of water."
