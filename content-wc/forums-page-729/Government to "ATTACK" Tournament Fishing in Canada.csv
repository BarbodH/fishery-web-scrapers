Okay more of the 'for us or against us' stuff. No one in government is advocating the banning of tournaments. However, there has to be a limit. You cannot allow a tourney on a lake every weekend of the year. No matter how much money you THINK you are putting into the process, it pales in comaprison to that of the waterfront owners. There is no outside influence affecting this call for reasonable assurances of a sustainable fishery. The fishery is not just for tournament guys. Rants like these do not serve your cause at all. The government is proposing looking at control measures to ensure tournies use modern and accepted practises of C&R to ensure less delayed mortality. Delayed mortality happens long after the anglers have left town, and is NEVER reported by the organisers. Because you are in the limelight is exactly why you should support these causes by providing reasonable input and not standing and firing rhetoric. Tournies are happening more and more and landowners and recreational fishermen have called for some control. They don't want traffic like that every weekend and they don't want to have to pick the floaters off their beach every Tuesday. It is not 'be with us or against us'....it is 'be part of the process or be left out.'"

Most likely) By the way , a lot of the complaining that has been levied about tournaments comes from Cottage Association members.

Anyone want to wager on that? Absolutely there will be fees. But in our 'user pays' system this is to be expected anymore. Remember the cottagers, whilst likely hypocritical as you say, still pay the property taxes (no small amount on the Kawartha, I might add) and cast votes for the local MP and MPP. Tourney fishermen don't. We do have to keep an eye on the way the legistaion plays out. There's always some fool trying to make a name for him/herself and tries to enter some extra junk. Thats why we have to be part of the process and not standing outside shouting slogans. Politics these days is all backdoor games.

552520,Guest,2005-10-08 11:48:00,0,How much property tax do the cottagers pay on the WATER and does that give them some additional priviledge? Back to animal rights groups. Who do you suppose was behind the end of the spring bear hunt? If you said billionaire Maurice Strong ( aka animal rights fanatic) and the WWF/PETA aliance you would be in the right ballpark at least. Just because these groups aren't directly involved in each and every new legislative act to come down the pike they ARE often directly involved behind the scenes in grooming candidates ( ones that are sympathetic to their cause) to be in positions of political power. Once a WWF/PETA sympathizer is in a political power position there is a residual benefit to the movement. Animal rights groups should be the foremost topic of discussion amongst intelligent outdoorsmen nowaday. They are not to be taken lightly. Calling the topic rhetoric is folly. People often call something they dimiss rhetoric because they have no information to add to the dicussion and want to change the topic to something they are familiar with. P.S. Fees are taxes in disguise.

Fees are taxes in disguise. The locals get the say on what happens on the water because they elect the people in the area. The more weight you have in elections at a local level the more things go your way on items like this. A municipality can put the brakes on any and all tournies if they so desire. Therefore it is in our best interests to be proactive rather than reactive. Discuss the concerns of the locals and address the issues with good-faith compromise. If we just stand there and yell 'screw you' we are gone. Plain and simple.IF we learn to anticipate problems and put measures into place to mediate them we can stay completely off the radar screens. The bear hunt cancellation was a foolish move on the part of our previous Conservative Government.It is proof that any party is susceptible tot he influence of big donation bucks. Staying inside the inner circle can help us prevent further incursions. By keeping a working relationship with all layers of governemnt, we can and will protect our resources and our sport simultaneously. Too many tournies equals too many boats equals too many floaters equals too many pissed off locals.Nip it in the bud before it becomes a 'movement'. And yes the tournies should be paying for the cost of administrating tournies whether it is called a fee or a tax. The jet-skiers failed to reckognise the annoyance they were causing locals on Kawartha area lakes and they are now banned on many waterways.The City of Welland also banned boats on its recreational waterway as a way to control the hoodlums. By the time the boaters got involved in the process, it was too late. Rather than being proactive, they were reactive and lost. The anti's are organised and well funded. What they still lack is credibility. We have to stop giving them photo ops and reasons to complain. We have to remain diplomatic and stay above the frey in order to be the only sane voice speaking. By doing this we can give them the rope and the time to hang themselves. They seem to be good at that."

I think catch and kill tournies during certain times of the year are likely to become reality. With studies showing up to an 80% delayed mortality on some species, it is likely in our best interest to change tactics. What I am saying is that we have to remain fluid. Staying static while the anti's continue to try new avenues is foolhardy. Did the anti's influence the bear cancellation?? Of course they did. MAinly because they are playing the game better than we are. It is not about credibility for them...it is about money.

Would you like to have you weight deductions based on delayed mortality rates? No...of course not. Because if you have read any of the studies you'd know that the delayed mortality rate of bass and walleye tournies is between 20 and 80%. It is such a problem that many states no longer allow C&R tournies during July and August. Of course, you've already left town by then, so why should you worry?? The effective control of tournaments will help PRESERVE the sport by not allowing over fishing during warm water times leaving the residents of the area fuming at all the floaters. Less negative stuff, more positive stuff. See how this works??? Allowing any sport to regulate itself has ALWAYS ended poorly."

552453,Guest,2005-10-02 13:01:00,0,"I have been fishing competitve walleye tournaments in Alberta since 1989, and it completely changed the way I think about fishing.I first did it to learn more about how to catch walleye, and grew to realize that keeping fish became unimportant.The whole idea behind these first tournaments, was to educate people to the idea of catching fish just for the fun of it (it worked on me) and that you don't have to keep fish to have a successful day.Another fact was to educate anglers on the slow growth rate of walleye in our province, proper handling of fish, and the need for catch and release fishing.We were lobbying the government to implement catch and release regs for walleye in 1990, they never did until 1995 (a lot of lakes had collapsed populations by then.)These first tournaments were catch and release long before there was mandatory catch and release walleye fishing in our province.I was a member of the Western Walleye Council back then, and other members and I helped the government with fin samples,habitat reconstruction, restocking, and any other projects they needed help with.It is true that some members of the Walleye trails North and South may only fish for the money, but I know many of them, and they do care about the ""Walleye Fishery"" in our province, not just for what money they may get out of it, just for the love of the sport.We are not against government regulations regarding Walleye Tournaments, we would just like to have some input on what those regulations may be.If you look back at our mortality rates for the (Northern Alberta Walleye Trail)anyway over the past few years you will find it to be less than 10 fish per tournament, which is under 1 per cent.To my knowledge we were one of the first trails to limit the amount of fish in the well at one time ,have weigh boat in a central location on the lake,and restricted our tournaments to the months of May,June and September.All these factors were done by choice and have all helped in reducing fish mortality.IMO the members of the Walleye trails in our province have done a lot more to enhance the walleye fishing in our province than to hurt it.As much as I would miss the competitive side of walleye fishing I will still be chasing them every chance I get, just to see If I can figure out the next ""big"" bite."

I know that change is hard to take and there is always fear of costs or restrictions, but I also believe that a sustainable resource and a program to keep it so, will make tournaments and general fishing better for everyone. In the report I see that a fair number of people are against tournaments. Some of this is from preconceived ideas as to what tournament fishermen/women are and also the potential for negative impact on the fisheries in any province or state. I believe the government knows that there is a fair bit of revenue generated into the economy by tournament fishing, I also believe that they are rightly putting the resource first. I also believe that there could be more publicity about the ""good"" that comes out of the tournament fishing groups....youngsters and families fishing etc. Just my 2 cents worth.

Where I live in NW Ontario,there are lots of derbies going on all over the place, mostly Bass derbies, and they are great, I'm fishing in one on the 17th and 18th of september, but for anybody to say that they don't have a heavy impact on the fisheries, if they aren't done right, is an idiot. The future of these derbies depends on intensive managment, and this calls for regulations."
