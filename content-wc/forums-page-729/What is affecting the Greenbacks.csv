552263,Guest,2005-09-27 02:27:00,0,"It is still a little early for the big ones to be coming in. The small ones just started to come in, with a rare big one. Just like any other year, give it 2 weeks and it will be the right time. The small ones always come first. All we need is a few more weeks and the fun begins. The way things are paning out it will be a better than average year. Just give it about a week and a half before we start to here more big ones being caught. We planed our trip finally for Oct 9-12 for the Red, Hope to see some of you out there!!!"

552265,Guest,2005-09-27 06:38:00,0,"As long as the wind is below 20km and coming directly from the north/north west, Pine Falls is awesome. If you are staying close to Selkirk, Pine Falls is only 45 or so minutes away. If the winds are from the north, there is always the river, there is a lot of huge fish that have come out of the river. I prefer Pine Falls over the Red as it does not have the same amount of traffic. I find the people that fish Pine Falls will give other fisherman their space, unlike the horror I have seen on the red...Catch a fish, draw a crowd. From experience that normally does not happen at Pine Falls. I have on occasion, found the fishing slow at Pine Falls, and put the boat on the trailer and off to the Red I went since its on the way home. Both are excellent places to go when the run is on. Hope this helps Roger"

552285,Guest,2005-09-27 20:59:00,0,"Well, it is Tuesday night, about 30 hours from departure. Sounds like we could have t-shirt weather on Saturday. Cannot wait. Even if it is early, we have tied into some really good greenies over the years in Sept and early Oct... My father turns 75 on Sunday, and just like every year, has a twinkle in his eye when we start packing the stuff. He has his ""christmas tree"" lures all ready to go to take a buck or two off of his sons...Always a ""twoonie"" on the first keeper, a five spot on the big fish of the day and a 10 spot on the biggest of the trip. My dad, brother and I are golfers and have introduced the term ""press"" into our betting. Seems that when someone has what seems to be the big fish of the day in the boat, we ""press"" to increase the winnings. As always, dad will likely bring home the cash. Ya know, I hope to lose to him for many years to come. I can't imagine travelling to Canada fishing without him. I count my blessings every year that I get to joke with him, have a LaBatts and just enjoy our time together. See ya at Pine Falls!"

552252,Guest,2005-09-26 13:59:00,0,"From what I have heard, it is becasue of the limestone in Lake Winnipeg. This is where the walleyes get the green coloring from. All ""river"" fish will not have this emerald green coloring. It is a sight to see when that 10lb+ green breaks the surface!!."

552257,Northern Manitoban,2005-09-26 17:24:00,195,Yes its way to early yet from all the info I have recieved over the years usually October and the second week in is the best times. Water temps is where its at wait like the guys say 55 and colder is prime. Our big Walleye run started 2 weeks ago water was at 56 and the bite is still on. Lots of huge eye's. NM

552221,Guest,2005-09-23 02:13:00,0,"I can hardly take it anymore!!!!! When are those Greenbacks going to start their run. It sure doesn't seem like it took this long the last few years for them to start up. ( or maybe I'm to anxious) What is it guys? IS the water to warm yet, or is the water to high this year? I always thought the higher the water the better. I've heard other people say its to high. I'm just hoping it's the water temperature that needs to come down a little. Are those Greenbacks ever going to come up and feed??????"
552223,chrism,2005-09-23 06:42:00,429,Hey Relax a bit bud!!! - I was out on Wed and we caught about a dozen (1-4#). They are definately just starting up! Did the normal routine trolling the bay and jigging the rivermouth. The water is still in the low 60's - they won't turn on until it drops a bit more. Keep ya posted chrism
552224,Burr,2005-09-23 09:55:00,8612,"And the reason you have had the Greenback fever so bad right now is because of TODD NE!!! Dog-gone-it, he started in the middle of August this year!! That's way too early!! Not time yet, it's not any later this year than it has been in the past. Last weekend in Sept is about the start of it, water temp gets down to 55 and we're there. Work on the honey-does for a bit, and I think we should tar and feather Todd NE at Pine Falls this year! He's single handedly diminished GNP this year with his early posts on the Falls. Just have to give ya some greif Todd - I'm blamin ya!!"
552225,Guest,2005-09-23 10:12:00,0,"It's still early. Although they are starting to move in, the big fatsos will be moving in over the next few weeks. Water temp is still a little high. Also, even though water level is high in the river, it's also high on the lake which will slow down the flow into Traverse bay. You need good flow along with high water levels."
552227,Todd_NE,2005-09-23 17:25:00,1330,"You'll need a lot of tar and feathers. I'm bigger than Brumbaugh! In the words of Ron Burgundy, ""That really escalated quickly"" T Today, redemption is spelled R O N!"
552232,Guest,2005-09-25 18:57:00,0,Fished Pine Falls on Saturday. Lots of fish in the 16-22 inch range. An american group fishing there all week said his group had to fish hard but they had boated a few Masters (over 28 inchers) over the week. Water is 61 degrees F with the nights getting cooler. The run of smaller fish in the river now is a good sign for the weeks to come I think.
