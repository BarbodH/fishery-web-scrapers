I have a bunch of fishing videos to make from my last outings , the very last one being 3 days ago for crappie. Was doing lots of crappie fishing as walleye was closed and was limiting the travel by staying on my home lake. Yesterday my son asked if we could do another cooking video together and so we made Fish Tacos ans filmed the process. https://youtu.be/O2bVbMHehpA"
