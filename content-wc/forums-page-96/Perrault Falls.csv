6429506,team walleye,2020-04-25 19:58:00,336,Thank you for the pictures. My group has been Fishing Perrault every other year since 2003. It's a beautiful area. Truly holds a special place in my heart.
6429518,prov1800,2020-04-25 21:03:00,5010,Our whole area is pretty special.
6429574,Skywagon,2020-04-26 07:16:00,1106,"You are right, even those that live here do not take it for granted, it is a special place. Right now the in-between season is almost here, not many days of ice fishing left and the grouse have started thumping, spring is on it's way."
6429576,team walleye,2020-04-26 07:17:00,336,Yes it is. Hope you get to enjoy some great fishing this spring.
6429578,prov1800,2020-04-26 07:25:00,5010,Have decided to stay off the ice.Shorelines are getting thin and am a lot smarter now.lol.Its been a fantastic season of ice fishing and iam sure we will now see open water within the next couple of weeks.Besides a few more yard projects the bòat will get some attention next.Spring time kinda picks a guy up and always have something to look forward to.
6432406,prov1800,2020-05-01 06:50:00,5010,Wife and ì took a drive up north just to get out and enjoy our great weather.Went to a small pothole lake and it was totally gone.Went and looked at Cedar Lake Lodge dock and couldnt beleive how low the water has dropped there since being so high last fall.Looks like a few more days for the ice to leave on the bigger lakes.Ice out is right on schedule.
6432456,Eckohlt,2020-05-01 07:57:00,3685,"Great pics john,won't be long and you will be posting fish pictures:,that will be torture for us to look at the pics,but in due time we will get our lines wet hopefully sooner than later,takecare"
6432492,prov1800,2020-05-01 08:56:00,5010,Might try off shore in the small lake.cant get my boat in there and dont have a tinnie.Have caught pike from shore there before and some crappies. Nice to get out to.redoing our porch floor and flooring.Pain in a** getting supplies now.have to find all item numbers and then call in and wait till its ready for pickup.Still waiting since yesterday.
6432586,the_bronco,2020-05-01 12:54:00,86,"Thanks for the pictures prov1800, can't believe I will be missing this year on Gullrock, but it doesn't look good for our June trip. Again, thanks for the pictures and stay healthy!"
6432606,prov1800,2020-05-01 13:57:00,5010,Same to you.
6419552,sheepman,2020-04-06 05:29:00,98,"nice picture john, hope to see you catching crappie end of August!"
6419558,prov1800,2020-04-06 05:34:00,5010,Iam with you there.crazy times right now.
6419578,ogilville,2020-04-06 06:39:00,262,I have been going to Wabaskang for over 30 years. It will be such a disappointment if it doesn't happen this year. Thanks for the pics.
6419662,Carnhzkr,2020-04-06 09:58:00,964,"The two waterfalls along 105 have often served as a stopping point for us if we need to kill some time before showing up at Fisherman's Cove, since they like guests to arrive around 3:00ish. Sometimes we buy Subways at Dryden and stop at either the Wabigoon or Perrault Falls for a picnic lunch and climb the rocks, if the mosquitoes allow it."
6419712,chocolatehogbbq,2020-04-06 12:35:00,1,Thanks for the uplifting pictures John! Keeping the faith my friend. Dont think we will see you in May on Cedar but hopefully next year.
6420244,prov1800,2020-04-07 10:04:00,5010,So far it just doesnt look to good.Hoping maybe later in season.
6420376,sheepman,2020-04-07 16:12:00,98,John What is the water level like up there? It was pretty high before freeze up I believe.
6420384,prov1800,2020-04-07 16:40:00,5010,Id say normal for now.thwre will be a bit of run off but most snow is gone and would be much of a factor.It will depend on some spring rains but looking good so far.
6421510,Kevin R,2020-04-10 08:31:00,305,"Thanks for the pictures brings back good memories. I started fishing those lakes in 1970 & had a friend that started fishing them in 1945. The water was very clean & clear in 1970 Cliff Lake in spots had about 25ft visibility Perrault about 16FT with weeds growing 25-30FT long Wabaskang various areas had a huge range in visibility like all lakes but 5FT was about anywhere including Keynote Lake that was loaded with weeds in 8FT or less water. I remember all the nice deep water weeds in Wabaskang & Perrault in the main lake that have all disappeared over the years. Cliff lake never had deep water weeds likely to much rock. The bay that south resort on Cliff lake was on was like a big pool of clear weedy water about 10-15 ft max deep. The darkest water was on Mystery, Evening & Twilight Lakes with 3-6FT visibility. Looking back I realized how lucky I was to have been able to fish those lakes as a kid."
6422210,prov1800,2020-04-12 07:08:00,5010,Cliff is definatly a beautifull lake to spend time on.That clarity is still there.Fishing is still very good as it is not over fished but tge big trout from years ago have vanished.Mystery and evening still get fished some.
6419264,prov1800,2020-04-05 08:23:00,5010,Wife and i drove up to Perrault falls yesterday to get some fresh air and check out the falls.We tried walking to the launch but actually still to much snow for my ankle high hikers so will try again soon as its a nice walk.Water flowing pretty but have seen it roaring at times.Thought a pic of nature might cheer a few guys up.
6419276,Duflebag,2020-04-05 08:36:00,218,Nice to see water flowing. Thank you for the photos John.
6419282,prov1800,2020-04-05 08:40:00,5010,Glad you like them.Never thought to take a short video.Next time.lol.
6419286,That Minnesota guy,2020-04-05 08:43:00,8293,Crystal clear water.
6419304,ia bhtr,2020-04-05 09:33:00,212,Just had to antagonize us didnt ya &#x1f642;
6419312,Bill Krejca,2020-04-05 09:51:00,6107,"Absolutely beautiful to this Iowan's eyes, love to look down into clear water and discover things happening. If you look hard enough, you can sometimes pick out a crawfish, small minnow,etc, something happening! This time of year, it is a joy! Thanks, John!! Bill"
6419360,ia bhtr,2020-04-05 12:12:00,212,"that was a smiley , or supposed to be anyway=^"
6419396,prov1800,2020-04-05 14:33:00,5010,Love the clearer water myself bill.Cedar is becoming quite clear over the last couple years ive noticed. Not as clear as west end but getting close.
6419484,Wall-i-Lama,2020-04-05 19:00:00,1524,"Thanks for the pics. We hope that we can make it up there in July! Started coming up to Ontario about 30 years ago and to your area the last three. Can't imagine a summer without visiting there, so we are hoping for the best."
6419494,prov1800,2020-04-05 19:34:00,5010,Iam thinking july a maybe.
