6428782,KSjim,2020-04-24 08:41:00,88,Interesting to see how the camps and the business has evolved. Most of it has been driven by technology but customer expectations also change. About 10 years ago our group went to an outpost that had an indoor bathroom. After a week it was like wow! Not sure we could go back to an outhouse. At first it really restricted our options but now we see more and more outfitters putting in full bathrooms in at least at some of their outposts.

6429310,kasmere,2020-04-25 10:43:00,20,If you enjoy history of the the North also check out North to Cree Lake. A wonderful account of the Karras brothers during our first depression trapping in Northern Saskatchewan and Cree Lake. My brothers and I have fished Cree Lake several times and actually scouted the remains of one of their cabins. These guys led a tough life.

Although I have never stayed at Bow Narrows, it is on my to do list of fishing spots just because of his writing and history lessons of the area over the years. PjShorthorn"
