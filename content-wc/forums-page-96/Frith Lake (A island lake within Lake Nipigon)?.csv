Passing my time traveling via Google Earth and saw it there. It measures about 1 mile by 0.7 miles. I have been somewhat fascinated by lakes within lakes. Probably since my days as a young man fishing Lake Windigo, contained within Cass Lake in Minnesota. Windigo had a distinct fish species population from Cass Lake. Fishing a lake within a lake added a layer of coolness somehow."

That, to me, would be a multi day trip to access, fish, and return, if the weather is good, once you arrive at Lake Nipigon.Perhaps a different way to get information on that lake is to contact one of the camp owners in the vicinity, then your follow up questions can be properly answered, too.I would contact and listen to Robert Lindsey at Onaman River, or Chad at Pasha Lake Cabins. Either should be able to get you information on the area, and, of course, what your next steps might be in getting to it.Lake Nipigon is a beautiful wild place, one that I go back to regularly.Good luck - sounds like a great adventure should you decide to try it out."
6428004,andreindy,2020-04-22 21:23:00,308,"I will never get there, I am certain. But was very curious if anyone ever had. Something so remote and hidden. Makes you wonder."
