I swear it must have been... I would love to hear some of your best escape stories as I am sure there are many - some you have been telling for years New post is up*https://www.northernjacks.com/post/the-great-escape Cheers Andrew
6429130,prov1900,2020-04-24 22:50:00,544,"Good read as usual. Have caught and landed lots of nice fish in Canada over the years, like everyone on this page. The fish that got away are memorable as well and like you, usually just catch a glimpse of them, versus seeing all of them prior to break offs, etc. One memorable one was also a smallmouth. Saw ""most"" of the body, still 5 or so feet underneath the boat. It turned sideways and I could never turn it. I've caught smallies up to 5 lbs and this one was bigger...much bigger. Of course you know the rest of the story. It seems every time I go fishing, there is one bite, one brief fight that always leaves me wondering, and naturally craving more. Keeps me coming back."
6429146,Pooch,2020-04-25 04:34:00,4618,"I am not superstitious, but once on every Canada trip I get hooked up with a very, very nice fish and manage to lose it. I've told my boat mates that I think the good Lord gives us each one chance per trip for a really nice fish and it is up to us to land it. So far that has proven true. Late summer last trip of the year to LS we were in a remote spot jigging and I hooked ""something"" I'm assuming was a really nice walleye (though logic tells me it was a Northern) as it acted very much like walleye and I could not turn it with a light jigging rod and eight pound test mono. The fish just sat there then slowly started to swim off. After a few minutes I was about out of line (spooled off is the right term) so I started to put a little more pressure on the spool with my finger and as expected the line eventually broke when the fish returned my pressure. The line failed somewhere in the middle and not near the knot. Still kicking myself in the butt for not getting the boat turned quick enough to follow the fish. Those are the fish I always remember because I did not even get a glimpse of it. All I wanted was a decent look to see what it was. Happens once every trip. Those are the fish that keep me making multiple trips back to Canada every year. I can't be the only one.... Pooch"
6429164,BornToFish,2020-04-25 06:33:00,1224,"Greetings,I have fished for walleyes in NW Ontario for twenty years. Despite having caught many thousands of walleyes over these years, I have never put a 30+ inch walleye in the boat. I have netted at least a dozen such fish for my wife and other boat partners. I've put many 29-29 7/8 inchers in the boat.I know that I have had 30+ inchers on my line, but they have all managed to beat me. I'm referring to fish that I simply could not lift off the bottom of the lake. They would just swim around for a while, until the hook pulled out or the line broke.I recall one particular fish from a few seasons ago. I brought her to the surface after a lengthy battle. She was just laying on her side next to the side of the boat, waving her pectoral fin at me. I was thinking ""FINALLY - my first 30+ incher"" as I was reaching for the net. The hook pulled out a moment later. I was heartbroken as I watched her swim away.As Pooch mentioned, I know they are there. Those memories just keep bringing me back.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6429170,HeHooksHimself,2020-04-25 06:42:00,725,"Like everyone else, this is happened to me plenty. However, the best example of what happens in retelling these stories is from my brother-in-law who hooked into a really big northern one year. He and my son were boat mates and they both agree that this one would have broken some records. Original estimates on the length started at the high 40's and it seems now every time they tell the story that fish is approaching 60 inches. Fish On! Hooks"
6429210,Larry S,2020-04-25 07:54:00,665,Back in the 90's at end of July I was at my friends camp 30 miles above Kenora trolling with a Downrigger about 45 ft down. This lake has large Pike & some Large Musky in it. I Hooked a fish and fought it for over a 1/2 hr when the line went slack. Reeled in and the Back Hook on a Large Swim Whiz was Straightened . Always felt this was a very large Pike or Musky. Might have been even Larger than My Largest Pike( 27lbs 47inches caught at Reindeer Lake Saskechewan in 1997) Brings back Great Memories as My friend is deceased since 2004
6429256,Pooch,2020-04-25 08:51:00,4618,"It's been at least ten years. We were trolling Lake Savant and doing fairly well catching low twenty inch walleyes one evening. A very pleasant evening, warm with a light drizzle and few bugs. As I was bringing in another walleye it suddenly stopped moving. Everyone who fishes Canada knows what that means.... After a few minutes I finally raised the fish to the surface as it didn't fight. It just hung suspended and allowed me to winch it to the surface. When it got within inches of the surface I was (literally) shocked and first glimpse called it a Sturgeon, then realized there were no Sturgeon in that lake. That Northern had a twenty three inch (measured it looking for teeth marks) walleye sideways in it's mouth and wasn't about to let go of it. It sat with it's back out of the water and I think it was glaring at me. (probably the fish version of ""the finger"") After a few moments it let go and just sank out of sight. We were in a camp boat and I have little doubt that that fish was as long as that boat was wide. I estimated the head at ten inches wide. I've never seen such a spectacular fresh water fish in my life. I replay that video in my head many times during the off season. I was fishing a bait caster, 15# PP, BB and 12# mono leader with a spinner and leech. Much more confidence lifting a heavy fish than a spinning rod and light line. I've told that story many times and it is as original as the day it happened. It is one story that did not need embellishing in any way. After my heart rate got back to normal I suddenly had more respect for some of the tales I had been told as a kid about fishing up north. Like many of the above posts, I have many over twenty nine inch walleye, but not a TRUE thirty inch fish. Some were close, but close doesn't count for me. I want to see it in an accurate measuring trough. MY measuring trough. Keep the stories coming fellows. Everyone has a story to share. Pooch"
6429290,tandm,2020-04-25 09:31:00,679,"My story comes from near French Portage on LOW 17 years ago in June. We were finishing a successful day of fishing by trolling back to camp pulling bottom bouncers and worm harnesses, when my rod was almost ripped out of my hands. Whatever it was pulled out about a third of my line and then stopped. For 20+ minutes we continued the tug of war, me slowly getting what turned out to be a Northern atleast 10"" deep and well over 40"" long up to the side of the boat. We knew we weren't going to keep her, but did want to measure and get a picture or two. My partner eased the net under her to lift her for measuring and pictures, and left me with a mental picture of the head and tail sticking well above the rim of my 22"" net and the middle of the fish breaking thru the bottom of the netting. After sitting in stunned silence for several seconds and discussing religion and ancestry for several more, I resigned myself to the one fact of life most fishermen are aware of---""The biggest one got away"". Since then, I have pictured several, in the water beside the boat, before unhooking them, but none of them have measured up to the one that got away."
6429496,jabecker,2020-04-25 19:24:00,118,"This was the last time my dad went to Canada with us. Three of us were out in the boat. I was in front, my dad in the middle, and my son in law was in the back. My father wasn't in the best of shape anymore but he wanted to go fish one more time. I hooked into a large walleye and my son in law netted it. After getting it out of the net and measuring it at just under 29 inches my father grabbed my fish and told my son in law to take a picture of it while he is holding it. I was fine with that and I told him when he was done with the picture to hand the fish to me and I would have my picture also. My father was known as a jokester and lo and behold the walleye never made it to me. He threw it back in the lake before I had my chance to have a picture with it. This was one that got away from me."

6430414,billy weaver,2020-04-27 10:20:00,470,"I have been fishing Canada for over 30 years and have caught many good fish. The one that got away would have been my biggest I am sure. I was reeling in a walleye when all of a sudden it got very heavy not fighting but heavy, like a concrete block. When I got it up where I could see it, it was a big pike and I mean big. He had the walleye in his mouth and was just hanging on not fighting or anything, about the time he was along side of the boat he let go. I was left shaken as to what I seen. I know many Canadian anglers have had similar experiences. I am guessing he would have been high 40s."
6430440,fishron,2020-04-27 11:26:00,317,"Over the years I've had big pike release a walleye and some never seen that managed a cutoff, but the one that always stuck with me was long ago. Before driving age I would camp at a Jersey ceder lake campground with my scout troop. Memories of cooking Dinty Moore beef stew on sterno stoves and pbj's that would feed us fast so we could FISH. The dark ceder water produced big perch and pickerel that were so aggressive that they would slash at the oars of the old boats we fished from while we rowed. There were bass in the lake but we never caught them. It happened one morning when three of us were fishing in the same boat. We were into a narrow area were a lazy stream fed the lake slinging bobbers and worms as usual. I hooked a fish on my old first solid glass spinning rod that doubled it over. I had 8 pound mono on and the best I could do was to get it to the side of the boat, never getting it off the bottom. I know it was a big fish because of the thumping resistance it was putting up. (The lake had a good population of really big snapping turtles that would occasionally stick there big fat heads through the surface) One of my buddies, thinking he could help, reached out and grabbed the line. No need to tell you what happened. I still have that old solid glass spinning rod."
6430452,Aspencreek,2020-04-27 11:55:00,2911,"I have not nor any of my boat mates, ever netted, boated or touched the elusive 30"" walleye, due to insufficient line, knot tying ability or just bad luck. Oh, we have hooked them (many times, just ask me)but must be something in our DNA that prohibits us from accomplishing that goal. There is at least 1 time a trip where, ""IT"" happens. For the big girls, I use a floating jig tipped with a minnow or crawler and pinned with a sliding 3/4 oz football type sinker, we were in about 20-25' of water off Manitoba Pt at the break, when it hit. Although I have med-heavy St Croix rods and 12 lb test that fish would not come off the bottom, we trailed that fish for almost 100 yds when for some reason it stopped and I could not even feel it pull anymore. Then noticed on the graph it was wrapped around a sunken limb in 32' of water, defeated, I gave one good lift and the line broke. One morning while backtrolling a tail dancer along a weed line ""it Hit"" a Pike, but it was no hammer handle, this one meant business, wanted to head to deeper water and we followed. That battle went on for a good 25 to 30 min, everytime it came close to the boat it would make a run. My set up was for walleye not a Big Pike so the drag was not screwed down and I let her go, the last run was under the boat and straight for the prop, I was too late and she was too fast. Tired, disappointed, and out 1 tail dancer, my brother looks at me and says ""We really didn't want that in the boat anyway"" to him I said ""it was too big for the cooler too"" That is now our go to saying whenever we lose a big one."
6430470,skindzier,2020-04-27 12:39:00,137,"I've told both of these on here before, however, telling the same tired old stories makes it more like a virtual trip, right? 1.) Lac Seul - fishing a hump, catching one fish after another in the 20"" - 25"" range. Get another bite, start bringing it in, starts normally, but fish decides it wants no part of coming up, peels a bunch of drag & goes back down to the bottom & sits there. Little movement, no head shakes, just hanging out. This goes on for the longest time I've ever seen with a (probably) walleye. Finally I get impatient and start trying to horse it up. I make some ground, drag is peeled again, then I horse it again & slack. Straightened the hook on my jig. Lesson in patience... Pretty sure that was my 30"" (my PB is 27.5). I suppose it could been a big pike but it didn't act like a pike at all.2.) Eagle - Was having the best musky day of my life fishing by myself (of course). Had already caught pair of 44s and a little guy. Hooked another one - immediately obvious that it was in a different league than the 44s. Fight it for a couple minutes, then the whole fish comes out of the water, time slows down & in slow motion I watch it throw my lure in mid air. Pretty sure that was the only 50 I've ever hooked (my PB is 46.5)Funny side note on that day. I caught one of the 44s trolling. I was trolling one side of a narrows & there were some walleye fishermen on the other side. As I'm trolling I get hung up on a rock so I'm backing up, reeling in the slack as I go to get back to the bait (a bit of a pain by yourself). I get within a couple feet of the rock & the Believer pops off the rock & immediately gets hammered right at the boat. I'm in reverse, have one hand on the rod and a musky on the line. A circus follows but I managed to actually net the fish. Pretty sure the walleye fishermen thought I was nuts.Anyway, love the stories!"
6430682,Twins_dad,2020-04-28 04:14:00,38,"I was on a fly-in trip last year. Great trip, but a really nice pike that got away also got away with my Eyecon and Shimano Sahara. The lesson learned....don't fish where there is no tackle store to replenish supplies!"
6430718,vteye3,2020-04-28 06:42:00,496,"Clean water act quickly cleaned up this incredible river in early 70's an went from ""Don't touch it to swimmable in a decade. I was early teens. Smallmouths in fast water between Chicopee & Holyoke grew like crazy and no one caught on for a number of years. Wading water to my hips standing on edge of bedrock, I hooked a big fish. 7 Foot Med/heavy rod, Mitchell 300 with 12 pound line I could not turn the fish. Fish went across the river an when down to last 10 yards held on an snapped. Channel cat or striper (stripers were non existent in the river back then) I don't know. I'll never forget that few minutes I was certain I could turn that fish."
6430900,downriverbob,2020-04-28 13:48:00,880,"Hey all hope everyone is well !!! About 12 years ago my wife and I were fishing the Whitefish Bay section of the Lake of the Woods. Friends of ours Wendy and Jack came over from Winnipeg to stay with us at the Sanctuary Resort. One day my wife Linda and Wendy were fishing with our resort owner and guide Peter Horley. Jack and I were fishing out my boat. We were going to meet up for shore lunch with our Wives and Peter later that day. We were mainly fishing for musky, but were also interested in catching a pike or two for lunch. One of the first spots that we fished was a large complex area of small islands and reefs south of the resort. We fished the west side of the area first and came around the south end to fish the east side of the complex. As we got to the northeast corner of the complex(I was using a silver/blue Double Cowgirl) I saw a good sized fish following. I had seen a good fish in this section of the complex a couple of times that year. This fish was coming in hot, gills flared. It did not commit until I went into a Figure 8, on the first turn going forward towards the bow of the boat she hit. The next thing I know this fish was on her tail and moving away from me on about 3-4 feet of line. To make a long story short being on a short line and shaking her head she was gone in the blink of a eye. My buddy Jack says ""that bleeping fish was 30 lbs"". For some reason I! wasn't that upset. It was just crazy to have a fish like that so up close. I did land a 51.5 musky on the same lure the next year in another area. Bob"
6431146,gordy28,2020-04-29 06:58:00,437,Great story and thats a beautiful musky! LOW is definitely up there on my bucket list destinations Cheers Andrew
6429344,stjoeguy,2020-04-25 11:57:00,979,"My one-that-got-away story is from Lac Seul in September 2014. A friend (IADave14) had invited me to join him on his fall trip to Red Pine on Abram Lake. We spent most of the time on Abram and Minitaki but went up to Lac Seul a couple of days. It was my first time on Lac Seul. We put in at the Deception landing and made our way to Sen Bay. One of the guys with us was used to fishing that area in June so we were looking forward to some good fishing, but it was slow. I was jigging when I thought I snagged a log. After pulling a while the ""log"" started to move. That's when you get that ""this could be something good"" feeling. I fought the ""log"" for a while as it went back and forth under the boat and back. Finally, it started taking out line and jumped out of the water a couple of times before I lost it. I really didn't get a great look at it so ""one great northern"" was what I thought. Telling the story to the Red Pine Lodge owner that evening he said it was probably a musky, so from then on that has become my official story of the one and only musky I never caught."
6429346,gordy28,2020-04-25 12:33:00,437,"Oh some great responses here - love these stories This one is my brothers and my Dads My brother had started college near our family trailer on Balsam Lake (in the Kawarthas) for the first few weeks of school my Dad and brother stayed at the trailer so my bro had a short drive to get acclimated. At the trailer generally equaled fishing for our family so most nights Dad and brother Dave headed out for a fish. Drifting in one of the channels my brother hooked into what he believes was a perch - reeling it back in when all of a sudden rod doubles down and big head shakes start reverberating up the line. As Dave is cranking in the fish surges to the top and launches itself out of the water (I believe their story says 5 feet out of the water ) Dave gets what is the biggest musky they have ever seen up to the boat, they do not have a net and notice that the harness (steel one) has wrapped and line is now very close to gill rakers. Just as my Dad tries to tail the fish it rolls, snap and its gone. Pretty much any time my brother, Dad and I are together and fishing comes up, this story gets told and as many times I have listened it never gets old!"
