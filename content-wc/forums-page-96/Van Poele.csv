This yr due to circumstances we maybe looking at 1 lake in particular...Van Poele And possibly looking at Aug sometime. Our group is a 2nd, 3rd week June group every yr, so no matter which lake the fish tactics will be different. What im wondering is, has anyone fished van Poele in Aug? id love to hear what your fishing #s were like, tactics used, etc. I know VP is an extension of Kag. I know Kag is a fantastic lake for #s. My concern is when i look at VP i see a body of water that looks like it would a great spawn area for walleye and then as the temps rise, those walleye might move into the bigger lake for the rest of the summer. Im hesitant to go to VP, but then have to head out each day into Kag to fish....unless guys have done tht and its really not a bad trip each day. Thx for any info, appreciated Cheers"

There is a variety of structure on the lake if you can search it out you will find fish. We looked for the same water we'd fish on Kag and found fish on them. I'll be on the lake mid July this year for a week and can tell you more after that.
