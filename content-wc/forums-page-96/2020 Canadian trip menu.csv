6430346,Aspencreek,2020-04-27 07:31:00,2911,"I'm afraid I can't take full credit for that one. Another party about 12 yrs ago when we were at Onaway was missing out on the crawler bite, so I traded them about 100 crawlers for the spread and recipe that evening. Enjoy....smoked Gouda a little northern spread on a Ritz and wash it down with a Cold Kokanee on a warm summers evening, nothing finer."
6417872,tweedrules,2020-04-01 07:47:00,107,Love it! We go WAY overboard with how much food we bring. We should just eat fish like you guys and save on the weight. Hope we get that chance this year.
6417878,eyecatcher1,2020-04-01 08:01:00,323,"When I first started going to Canada 28 years ago we brought steaks and a lot of food. Then on the way home we would ask ourselves why we hardly ate any fresh fish while we were there. We then started bringing fewer meats and ate more fish. We always bring a steak or something for the last night so we aren't over our walleye limit on that day, since we bring our last few take home fish in that day."
6417890,lmoore,2020-04-01 08:40:00,40,"Our menu used to be more extensive when my Grandpa and some of the other old boys went. Now we pretty much do fish and potatoes every night except one night of steaks and one night of burgers. Lunches are sandwiches in the boat, and breakfast is eggs and bacon or pancakes. We seem to get a lot more fishing done since the menu has been slimmed down some, although it's still a guaranteed 5-10 pounds of extra weight on everyone when we get back so I guess we don't go hungry"
6417892,eyecatcher1,2020-04-01 08:52:00,323,Most of my trips now are with my wife. She will fry up a few pounds of bacon at home and we'll have BLTs for breakfast. We take sandwiches and snacks for food in the boat and fish with something else for dinner. We've learned to keep it simple and do more fishing and easy meals.
6417936,emma17,2020-04-01 11:23:00,436,"Sandwiches for lunch in the boat has become something our family most looks forward to. We have bobber rigs set up, we found a place out of the wind and with good structure. We anchor, bait the hooks, relax and watch our bobbers for an hour or so. Some days it's not so relaxing-when the bite is on."
6426040,Jack68133,2020-04-18 14:31:00,14,Sunday - Gumbo / Grilled Cheese Monday - Ribs/Cheesy Potatoes/ Corn bread muffins Tuesday - Group Fish Fry Wednesday - Steak Dinner at Lodge Thursday - Walleye Sandwiches / Fries Friday - Walleye Tacos Saturday - Hamburgers/ Poutine Breakfast - oatmeal/ pop tarts Lunch - is usually traditional shore lunch however I think we are going to mix in using Hobo pie makers to make grilled cheese and warm soup in cans over the fire. Maybe some hot dog and sticks one day.
6427980,SteveJ715,2020-04-22 20:00:00,59,"One thing we always bring is a large vacuum-sealed bag of homemade chili for the last night before we head back home. We make the chili well in advance, and the vacuum-sealed bag can be laid flat in the freezer, and then it acts like an extra ice block in the cooler. Hoping we can do it again this year! - Steve"
6429600,RRK285,2020-04-26 08:31:00,44,"We eat shore lunch every day if we can. Breakfast we make breakfast burritos at home, freeze and microwave in the morning and hit the water. For dinner each guy is responsible for a dinner and that person comes in early to cook and prep so it is ready for everyone else Sat-Italian Beef Sun - Pulled Pork Mon - Lasagna Tue - Gumbo Wed - Steaks Thur - Chicken Fri - Burgers & Brats"
6429630,IaDave14,2020-04-26 09:32:00,99,[QUOTE=RRK285;6429600] For dinner each guy is responsible for a dinner and that person comes in early to cook and prep so it is ready for everyone elseI use to work with a guy and his group did this. I like the idea maybe have 2 guys if in a large group and also do the clean-up afterwards. The upside is the rest of the week you can relax after fishing but the downside is if someone can't cook.
6429638,Aspencreek,2020-04-26 09:45:00,2911,"Some of the menu items from our trips are listed below. I am the camp cook generally so I plan the menu, buy the groceries and get reimbursed from the group. When we go each guy has his own job/duty, and I certainly do not mind doing all the cooking. We have adopted the paper plate as a staple on the grocery list too. For dinner Grilled ribeyes, grilled chicken, spaghetti and meat sauce, grilled Pork chops, along with of course Walleye done any number of ways. One yr we even had a chili cook off, everyone did their best chili, and brought it from home frozen in a 1/2 gal zip-lock, the chili was heated and only I along with maybe the cook knew which was which and you couldn't vote for your own, that was a fun night. Lunches are done on shore some place, I have a small coleman grill so we do Brats, Burgers and marinated chicken breasts on the grill with a can of beans or corn. Breakfasts are cereal, pancakes, eggs, toast and walleye leftovers if there is any, most of the time guys will create their own breakfast. We will have walleye for dinner at least 3 times during the week, we do it outside in a turkey fryer, with onion rings and fried potatoes. You may have noticed we do most of the cooking outside. So I can be part of the group too. On day 1, I ask for a just under the slot northern, it gets fileted and then wrapped with butter and onions, salt, and pepper and a sliced lemon in aluminum foil. It goes on the top rack of the grill while I grill something else for dinner. About 3-4 min per side the northern is removed to cool. After dinner I take the northern and flake it up in a large bowl and add Mayo, more pepper and paper thin sliced onion. Then mix, if you think you have added enough pepper add more, and more onion, you want a consistency of a spread. Refrigerate until happy hour the next day. Serve cold with your choice of cheese and crackers. Repeat as needed."
6417602,kettyspanky,2020-03-31 11:48:00,271,"Is anyone else bored out of your mind and thinking about your Canada trip? I am so I started writing down a menu for our trip. I know it's early but I don't have much else to do at the moment. Wishful thinking ahead I guess. We are supposed to go at the end of July and I would hope this situation is resolved by then. So I'm just passing the time and thinking ahead as to what foods we want to take. Be safe and think ahead, it has to get better right?"
6417626,Eckohlt,2020-03-31 13:16:00,3685,"Ketty I hope your right about the end of July that's my second trip,I get the feeling the June 7 trip might be washed out,I started my July menu also most every meals starts with a W no brained menu"
6417634,Walleye2242,2020-03-31 13:33:00,263,"We are a 2 man show so our ""menu"" is not much. alot less than it was years ago with 10 plus guys in the crew where we ate until we busted a gut. I think it was more of a eating trip back then rather than a fishing trip...huge breakfast and then clean up...on the water at like 8ish if lucky...shorelunch and noonish...then big dinner at 5ish. spent more time cooking and cleaning than fishing. I do enjoy a good meal but these days we are simple. Breakfast...eggs and a meat real quick....pack sandwiches for lunch but if noon fishing is slow..back to camp for a bite then back out fishing. Dinners...lots of fish..baked, fried, fish taco's...bring a couple steaks and make some chili to keep around for a quick warm up meal."
6417642,kettyspanky,2020-03-31 14:17:00,271,Yes we eat fish a couple meals but we have a little variety also. Nothing fancy but just easy stuff like BBQ or brats or a slow cooker meal. We fish mainly for Perch so we have a few meals of that. Walleye fishing isn't great by us. We do catch a few once in awhile.
6417658,btyreprich,2020-03-31 14:32:00,1067,"Whats on the menu often depends as what's on sale a week or two before the trip. Costco chicken is always a good value & tasty Pork tenderloin seasoned with Montreal steak seasoning and wrapped in bacon Steaks of some sort - NY strip or beef tenderloin for fillet mignons Pork chops also wrapped in bacon Spaghetti and meat balls - cheap dinner Burgers and corn on the cob Left overs on last night We like to eat well and with four guys helping, dinner doesn't take all that long"

6417856,eyecatcher1,2020-04-01 07:05:00,323,"When my wife goes she does the menu, but when it's me and my buddy. We each bring what we like for breakfast and for lunch and snacks on the boat . For dinner we bring fish breading and 7 cans of beans. Make things easy."
6417864,tweedrules,2020-04-01 07:41:00,107,Man 7 cans of beans! Lot of gas going on in that cabin
6417868,eyecatcher1,2020-04-01 07:45:00,323,That's one can for dinner every day. That's all my buddy likes to eat. Good thing we're outside in a boat all day!
