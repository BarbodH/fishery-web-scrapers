6428996,prov1800,2020-04-24 15:52:00,5010,Got out yesterday with 2 buddies Ken and Ted for some lake trout.Great weather but cool on the ice wind a good breeze.Fishing was good but a slow√®r bite with lots of fish on sonar and chasing lures but no bite.One of us was in 37 ft and did well.Didnt try shallower as we were still catching and just yakking while distancing. Weather up here is getting warmer and will see some ice movement starting.I usualky can get my boat in on around 6-8 of May but might be a few more days longer this spring.
