6431290,Andre (wallyandre),2020-04-29 15:21:00,2274,"Air TamaracDuring his daily press conference, our Premier, François Legault presented the calendar for the progressive resumption of economic activity.We are conscious that there are currently no opening announcements for outfitters. However, as the Premier mentioned, the other economic activities that are on hold are now the object of discussions so specific communications could be issued, soon enough we hope, regarding the reopening of our outfitting business.And today, the Deputy Premier of Quebec announced that the roadblocks that restricted access to the region where our outfitting operation is were to be lifted on May 11th (before the beginning of our season). We are therefore very hopeful that we can start the 2020 season on the usual dates.That being said, we are still waiting on our government to reopen our type of businesses and you would then get your fishing trip preparation package with flight times and more information this year regarding our new (edit ""safety"")............ measures applied at our office, in the planes and at the cabins.For U.S. residents we are also aware that the public officials in both Canada and the United States have extended the border closing to May 21st and we follow that situation as well, hoping that you will be able to join us and enjoy your fishing trip in the great outdoors!Take care of you, stay safe and healthy. On our side we are preparing a great season and will keep you, as always, posted."

6431368,elway12,2020-04-29 19:06:00,335,Thank you for posting the information from Air Tamarac. According to the attached articles the leader of Ontario is taking things a bit slower. My personal thought is that right now it is about a 50/50 chance they open the borders and Ontario province near the beginning of July. Which means there's a chance for my July 4th trip. https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/stay-at-h...ince-1.4917350https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/ontario-u...like-1.4913052

6431462,Andre (wallyandre),2020-04-30 04:59:00,2274,I don't see why it's going to be move. I'm not related to Air Tamarac except has a client and I think the information is appropriate taking in consideration that there is quite a few guys from the site that are clients with a trip book this summer coming.
6431496,Shellback,2020-04-30 05:53:00,8083,"For whatever reason, your last post referencing the border disappeared. Maybe that's what he is referring too. Good information, not sure why the other one got lost."
6431514,Esoxmike,2020-04-30 06:25:00,114,"that was exactly what i was referring to.thanks for the info Andre.i fished with air Tamarac a couple times and they are a top notch outfitter with the best customer service out there.i couldn't figure out why it got moved the first time because it was a link to vital info for anyone who fished quebec,but in today's sensitive world u can't figure out what's in someone else's head,even a walleye central moderators."
