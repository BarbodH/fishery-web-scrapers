6427824,Dacotah Eye,2020-04-22 14:12:00,2722,I used to bring Malkins Jam home for the entire family. My nieces would tell me how many cans of which flavors they wanted.Mom and my brother did too. Everybody loved the stuff. Now I buy it at Runnings.
6428390,wmd,2020-04-23 08:22:00,388,Is it just me or did the flavor and consistency of Malkins change years ago and not for the better? We used to buy and enjoy it but have been very disappointed in it for the last number of years and no longer buy it. wmd

6428652,x4flatfish,2020-04-23 20:40:00,319,"BINGO, yes since Malkins sold out or the name changed, whatever happened, I agree not nearly as good. I no longer buy it either. Used to stock up on our trips. Haven't bought it for years. Just not the same...."
6429216,Aspencreek,2020-04-25 08:00:00,2911,"Maybe it has changed, maybe not, I don't care, it's the 1 of a couple more items I bring back. Besides, does it really matter anyway. Not to me."

6427454,That Minnesota guy,2020-04-21 18:14:00,8293,When I was a kid (many years ago) getting a can of Jam from Canada was a bigger treat then going to McDonalds.
6427556,bigwalleye1,2020-04-22 01:31:00,2632,"Still is. You can buy it in MN, but it's not legit if it doesn't have a French label as well...."
6427564,kettyspanky,2020-04-22 03:40:00,271,I buy my wife and kids some jam every year. My Mom and mother in law get one also.

6427662,Walleye2242,2020-04-22 08:27:00,263,Malkins Jam and Macintosh Toffee. 2 treats that i always remember from Canada and still always get!!!
6427672,Tx Jig tyr,2020-04-22 09:01:00,140,"We just finished out last can from last year. Good thing we are headed up shortly. Also, our adult kids get several cans for Christmas each year. They look forward to it. Tx. Jig Tyr"
6427692,bigwalleye1,2020-04-22 09:31:00,2632,"Both. Malkins was the brand in the old days, now called Canada's. I had my first on my first trip to Canada over 30 years ago. The stuff is so thick you have to cut it out of the can, and the flavor is so intense...."
