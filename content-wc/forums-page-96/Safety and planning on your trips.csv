Didn't have to spend the night, but was prepared for it on Lac Suel about 8 yrs ago when a large rock took off one of the prop blades. It was so unbalanced I didn't want to ruin the lower unit from the vibration, so just made it to an island near a travel route and hunkered in.BTW.......I have been buying those smaller utility bags from Cabelas, they are usually about $12 each and come in a multitude of colors and camo patterns. They can store alot of stuff, all the small things that you need in case if emergency but also the gloves hat, multitool, fire starter, lighter, flares, batteries, flashlight, etc,etc. I have been giving them as Christmas presents as well."
6423406,Overwatchmike,2020-04-14 15:25:00,201,"I agree 110% with the Cabela's catch all bags! Perfect size for your emergency oh $&£ bag!I keep one in my truck, quad, boat,and take a backpack whenever we head off into the bush.Multi tool, first aid kit, emergency blankets, iodine tablets, a small pot for boiling water, fire starting kit ( lint from the dryer in a ziplock baggy is your best friend!), mirror, whistle, flashlight, small fishing tackle kit, rope saw, knife, 550 cord, bug juice, compass, and a couple other things. Always prepare for the worse! Best piece of advice is if you get lost or into trouble stay put! Sat phone if you can afford it, always let someone know where you plan on going. Worse case scenario, leave a note of your plans!Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"

6424000,prov1900,2020-04-15 02:27:00,544,"That was an interesting video! What lake were you on? Saw some good ideas here. I bet you would have paid big bucks for a head net! I normally have those and deet in the boat because my boys can't stand bugs. I'm thinking a foldable hand saw, like a Gerber would take a lot less space than a hatchet. We bring an MSR ""pocket rocket"" stove as well. I'll have to remember to throw some instant coffee in. My bucket trip is Nipigon someday. I'm thinking on something that remote I will be packing my Gore-Tex bivy sacks. Those roll up pretty tight. Of course in my own boat there is tons of storage. A resort boat you would have to really pare down to the necessities."
6424414,gmattbruin,2020-04-15 07:02:00,174,"Hey Live to Jig, awesome video. Great lesson in this....you had some basic essentials with you, so prepared in that way, and more important, you were chill and calm which allows us to think properly...well done. PLEASE dont take this as criticism, just a different way of thinking. Our group has a rule...no one ever goes out alone. Our lake is a big lake and weve all seen how fast it can get ugly. 1 exception has been my son. He has come with us since he was 10...now 23. As any young teen, 10hrs or more on the lake isnt enough for him. So there will parts of some days he wants more. He takes a radio, and is always within earshot of us at camp. Never ventures out into the main lake. We just always feel like having 2 in a boat can solve most problems...weather, mechanical, medical. Has served us well in a few tough situations before. Glad it worked out for you Live to Jig!!"
6424592,dented boat guy,2020-04-15 11:46:00,24,"I sometimes go to Ontario alone in mid to late September so I try be be prepared. I keep two 6 x 8 foot tarps new in the package(lay very flat) for a potential rainy and cold night in the boat or ashore. Also plenty of para cord which has many potential uses. Small folding saw, lighters, matches, 2-3 flashlights, etc."
6424754,Live to jig,2020-04-15 19:26:00,159,"Thanks Guys, I was on O'Sullivan Lake north of Nakina, There always is a risk being in a boat by yourself. We were a 4 man camp and my father didn't feel up to the night bite trip that evening. My other 2 brothers were in the other boat and we fished close most of that evening but I zigged and he zagged the last couple of spots. We always agreed that if we broke down we would just try to get to a main point and wait for help, build a fire if at night. I had plenty of bug dope, bugs were only bad for an hour or so. Lesson learned was, keep some allergy pills in the boat, 1 flashlight, no matter how good, can act up and those cheap orange life jackets make a lousy mattress!"
6424844,gmattbruin,2020-04-16 06:52:00,174,"Glad your situation all worked out for the best. Our group fishes one lake NW of you, Abamasagi. The main part of Aba is large and can **** mean. We never know when we push off the dock and head out what is in store. But you guys had a plan, which is really important. We fish 2nd week June and a lot of our fishing is trolling shorelines, points. Many of these are islands scattered throughout the lake. Ill admit ive thought many times about being stranded for whatever reason....thinking which island would be the best spot, which point would be the best point to set up so we are seen, found. Having a plan of some kind, and remaining calm is the 1st steps to being ""safe"""
6425788,gmattbruin,2020-04-18 07:27:00,174,"I was hesitant earlier on, on this post to write up a story that happened on our lake 1 day several yrs ago. But here it is, a saturday morning, another covid isolation day, and i thought ill write it up, post it up and i hope you guys get a laugh outta this cause its a story tht does end well, but VERY well might not have. Our group of 8 fish Abamasagi each June. TLO has 3 cabins on this lake, but some yrs we will see a group that comes in from Michigan down river into Aba and sets up camp on 1 of the islands. They generally have several boats, maybe 3 and some are paired up and some are solo fishing most days. This 1 day in particular we were all fishing the main body of the lake and its many islands and this group were there as well. My brother and dad were together and happened to be on the opposite side of the islands as our 3 other boats. The lake turned mean, quick. We all keep pretty good track of each other and radio if we are heading off in another direction or heading back to camp, etc. But we also kinda are aware of any other activity too. With some of these ""camp-fish"" guys who are solo we always think...""ya never know"" My brother and dad had been keeping an eye on this 1 solo boat for awhile, but he was quite a ways off and as it got nasty, lost site of him. Then all of a sudden there was a massive boom in the distance. We all heard it from the other side of the islands, but they heard and saw it. A huge fireball rose up from a small island in the distance. They took off toward it figuring the worst. There on shore was the solo guy, burnt pretty good, his boat half assed pulled onto shore. and a tall evergreen burnt from bottom to top. My brother and dad got out to attend to him and ask wtf happened. This where it gets funny(thank god) and is a story we still tell each yr in camp. His explanation for what happened......well, the waves got too much for me, i got pushed onto shore and wanted to send a signal to my other guys to come help me. So he took his gas can, dumped it out on the ground under the tree, set it down and yes, lit it up. Not only did he light up the gas on the ground, but he lit himself, the tree and the gas can blew. He figured if he only lit a small fire they wouldnt notice, so he actually wanted the can to light up too, not realizing it would explode. My brother calmly asked him.....now tht you lit your can, how the **** are you gonna run your boat/ His answer? you guessed it...I dont know, i didnt think of tht. I think my dad and brother gave the guy a lift back to his camp location and we offered any more help if they needed. They were gone the next day certainly a tragedy in the making, but ended well. Hope you enjoy this read Cheers"
6425876,gbin,2020-04-18 09:24:00,1384,"All I can say is... wow, what a moron!I'm presently gearing up for my 1st ever boat. Really benefiting from folks' advice in threads such as this one.Gerry"
6420548,gordy28,2020-04-08 07:16:00,437,"I will admit that I love anything to do with bushcraft or wilderness prep - Survivorman, Bear Grylls the Last Alaskans, Alone - I love it all When we first started our back country trips and eventually fly ins we did some planning for our safety - we did a wilderness prep course and 2 of our group did a wilderness first aid course I usually have a small personal survival pack on me at all times and we bring a big first aid kit packed by a RN Interested in hearing others tips and tricks and I posted my thoughts herehttps://www.northernjacks.com/post/i...ook-in-the-eye Cheers Andrew"
6420566,vteye3,2020-04-08 08:06:00,496,"A good reminder especially about the first aid courses that are available. One addition would be to consider the wildlife likely to encounter and group plan in advance a course of action. I am taking a group on unguided float in AK this summer. Bears are always worth a discussion whether it be Ontario bears raiding a camp, brown bears of AK/Western US, an polar bears above the circle trips. I personally have been given beach speeches in Katmai NP an Pangnirtung NWT, etc. I cherish those memories as you know you are a long ways from home. Big cats, wolves, close encounters with moose, are worth a discussion depending on where you are heading."
6420626,Willie_G,2020-04-08 09:47:00,4,"I agree about the wildlife, you always need to be careful at outpost fishing camps as you don't know what the group ahead of you did in regards to storing food and getting rid of the fish guts. Another thing that seems simple but could be a trip saver is being able to remove an imbedded fish hook. Willie"
6420812,gordy28,2020-04-08 14:55:00,437,Very true - I remember my first canoe trip - when the guide had us putting toothpaste and bars of soap into what he called the bear barrel I remember being slightly freaked out. First late night trip to the Thunderbox was a knee knocker I agree that some general research of the animals and other threats (plants like poison ivy etc) is a solid portion of the prep for each trip VT - your trip to Alaska sounds both amazing and scary (Brown/Grizzly bears are a new ball o wax) Cheers Andrew
6422150,prov1900,2020-04-11 23:24:00,544,"Not bear or animal related, but one thing people don't take into account is the trip to and from, i.e. the actual drive. I see lots of people that are caravanning together, like us, two, three, four or more rigs deep. I see them on the 502 bumper to bumper and that is a recipe for disaster, especially with some of the speeds they are traveling. We ""unofficially"" have an itinerary and we know where we are getting gas and other stops prior to leaving for the trip. We just don't want to fall victim to our own vehicles rear ending each other. Like most of you we also have a rough itinerary on the lake. We don't always travel together to the same spots, but we are very aware as to where everyone is at any given part of the day, in the event of breakdown, or worse. As far as first aid, every one in our group is qualified and experienced at first aid and we take ""combat"" level first aid gear with us, along with the usual bandaids, etc."
6422218,Pooch,2020-04-12 07:42:00,4618,"When we are trailering with multiple boats our rule is to always have a visual on the other tow vehicles. If someone falls behind we slow down to see if they have a problem. The lead guys does not pull away and leave the others. This is especially true on 502. It's also up to the following tow vehicles to keep up. We ""run with the traffic"" speed unless it gets ignorant. Also, once on the water when we leave the dock in the morning we tell the other boats about where we are going to be that morning and what time to come back in for our early afternoon meal. We get off the water for a couple hours during the (usually) mid day slow down. Then head back out later in the afternoon for the evening. We all have hard wired marine band radios. Worth their weight in gold (or leeches!) when needed. Pooch"
6422236,gmattbruin,2020-04-12 08:35:00,174,"When it comes to all of us enjoying are trips ""safety"" has to be paramount. I cant imagine some of the stories these outfitters and especially the bush pilots could tell.We fly-in each yr with our group of 8. 3 of those 8 are over 70yrs of age.Most of us have finished our careers as firefighters. We take in a really well stocked first aid kit and with our yrs of admin first aid we always feel pretty good about most issues that will come our way.BUT....and theres always a but when going each yr and being so remote....**** happens.Imo, the absolute best piece of safety equipment is a SAT phone...100%We ended using ours several yrs ago in an emergency situationI wrote about the incident a few yrs back in a lot more detail. But to summarize....my dad, 1 of the 70+ guys fell, broke several ribs and suffered a concussion.We could certainly triage him and do our assessment, but if he was internal bleeding, spleen, lung puncture then obviously there is no first aid kit gonna solve tht.1 SAT phone call and we were packed up and gone. We got him the hospital care he 100% needed.That phone goes in on every trip. We are lucky. Our outfitter provides. But there was yrs past when he didnt have them and we would bring our own. They can be rented, borrowed, etcI guess 1 day maybe we might see O2, Defib machines at camps, who knows....but we realized on tht day the SAT phone was vital."
6422692,gordy28,2020-04-13 07:29:00,437,All great points! When we fished Ogoki lake in 2018 we generally stayed in the same area and made a point of notifying the others boats (via 2 way radio) if we were making a move since the lake was much bigger than we were used to. Two days we had really rough weather and we stayed close to each other and when it got really bad we headed back to the bay by the cabin to be safe - was end of August but cold enough that hitting the water was going to be dangerous Cheers Andrew
6423100,Live to jig,2020-04-13 20:52:00,159,"Got to be prepared for anything, Couple years ago I ran out of gas on night bite trip, camp had new boats with bigger motors and smaller tanks than the prior boats. Should have checked the gas before heading out again. Spent the night on a big ole rock in the middle of the lake. I had my boat box with my safety gear and extra supplies. We always agreed that if you broke down to hunker down and wait to be found. Not ideal, but I decided to have a little fun with it and made a video.https://youtu.be/ltGE9ETBjDw"
6423128,prov1900,2020-04-14 01:02:00,544,"Always think that is going to happen to us sometime. I always have fire starters (they vary in design, but the common denominator is they are always soaked in paraffin), plus a reliable lighter, a small but very sharp hatchet, and a nylon rain fly in the boat. All these items take very little space and would be paramount to an accidental overnight stay. What else do you carry with you in your boat box? I'm always looking for extra ideas. Of course there is first aid, plus we never leave without rain gear. Its me and my two young boys, so we normally pack enough snacks to get stranded for several days...LOL"
