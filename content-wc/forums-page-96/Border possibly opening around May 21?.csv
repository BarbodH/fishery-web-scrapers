I know that the curves must have really flattened in both countries by then and ""open for business"" must be current in border states as well as Ontario. I can only imagine that US and Canadian officials would need to re-visit data at that time to make a safe decision. Please don't be critical in posts as I'm not encouraging opening borders so I can go fishing if this thing is not deemed under control by the 21st. Just gaging info about what others think the link may actually mean to those who would like to fish Ontario in May or maybe even June? OTTAWA -- Canada and the United States have agreed to extend the current closure of the border to all non-essential travel for at least another month as the fight against COVID-19 continues in both countries, sources tell CTV News. Travel restrictions across the Canada-U.S. border took effect on March 21. That agreement exempted the flow of trade and commerce, as well as vital health-care workers such as nurses who live and work on opposite sides of the border. Set to last 30 days, terms of the arrangement were due to expire on April 21. The extension will see these restrictions remain in place for another 30 days."

Trudeau also says closure will be in place for ""many, many weeks."" Trudeau said in French the restrictions will remain in place for many, many weeks to come and then said in English it will undoubtedly be many weeks. Sounds like past the April date to me."
6427264,Carnhzkr,2020-04-21 10:40:00,964,"There are several ongoing threads on this topic. In one, there's link to Justin Trudeau quoted on 4/14 (not sure of that date but it's close) as saying ""it will be many many weeks before Nebraska wins another national championship"". No wait, I think he actually said, ""it will be many many weeks before the border restrictions are lifted"", so interpret that as you might."
