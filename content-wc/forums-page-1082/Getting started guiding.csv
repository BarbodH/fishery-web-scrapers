They probably won't let you guide right away, but you may be able to cut lawns or do general camp work. That's how I started. Just asked for a job at a nearby lodge when I was 15. Eventually he let me do a bit of guiding and now I will be guiding full time this spring/summer. I'm 18 right now. I would totally encourage it. It's the best job that I've ever had and will have for a while, pays decent and the tips are very decent as well.[font size=""4"" color=""green"" font face=""signature""]River eye[/font]"
