We hit the lake at a bad time though because of a mayfly hatch. We struggled to catch any walleye even though the resort owner took us out and put us on some good spots. I'd be careful about going there during peak mayfly hatches. We were there around the 4th of July. If we had been a few weeks later, we may have had a better trip."
