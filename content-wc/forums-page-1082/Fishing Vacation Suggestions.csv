There will be four people in our party,my girlfriend and his wife. We were considering the Kenora or Atikokan area, but are open to any suggestions. We love to fish walleye, pike, bass. trout etc. Can anyone give me a good recomendation for a fishing camp, that has reasonable rates and good fishing. Please keep in mind that we are lookin for a ""drive to"" location with cabins. Thanks in advance. Erick"

We only take 20-24 guests per week and our fishing quality is very good because we are the only lodge on 14,000 acre Confederation lake. Trophy Pike, Lake Trout and Walleye. Executive Plan includes everything you need including a guide for the week Sat-Sat for $995"
