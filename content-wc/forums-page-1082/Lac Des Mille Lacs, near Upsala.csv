I ordered some on 1-1-00 and still have not got them yet so I don't know how detailed they are. I go to Lake Sturgeon every June, (North of Ignace). Watch out for the OPP in Upsala, I got a ticket last year."
507007,Guest,2000-02-06 18:41:00,0,"all the bait shops have the King Tut Walleye Whiffer maps of the lake. The maps point out the flats, ricok bars, reefs, and the map is designed for gps coordinates. i have one and it works great. if no gps just get a bearing point and compass it out. The map has depth readings so start marking. good luck!! just got back myself and had a great time. the perch were loving the swedish pimples (red or green or yellow prism) tipped with a minnow."
507008,wylie,2000-02-07 18:02:00,3,How can I get my hands on one?
507009,Big D,2000-02-08 08:03:00,61,I don't know if you are refering to Mille Lacs in Minnesota or the lake in Ontario please confirm regarding the King Tut map. I have the one for Mille Lacs in MN. But am having difficulty locating a good map for Lac Des Mille Lacs in Ontario. Thanks!
507010,Guest,2000-02-08 17:53:00,0,"Yeah, a lot of people confuse it with Mille Lacs in Minnesota. I am looking for a map of Lac Des Mille Lacs in Ontario."
