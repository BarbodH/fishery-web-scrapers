507222,Guest,2000-03-01 15:19:00,0,Rainy is a big lake. What area will be fishing from. Let me know and I can give you some info. Make sure you check ice conditions. There is no snow cover and temps have been in the upper 40's during the day and lower 30's at night. Forcast is for more of the same for the next 5 days. This has been going on for the last 2 weeks. Ice is starting to deteriorate. There was a truck that broke through Rainy somewhere near International Falls this past weekend. A 7 month old drowned. So be aware and call ahead. TGG
