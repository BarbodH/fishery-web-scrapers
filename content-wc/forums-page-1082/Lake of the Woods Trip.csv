Just wondering if any any of you guys are headed up there dufing the same time frame? Always nice to have other dedicated Walleye anglers along to share info.KM
507256,Ron,2000-03-01 17:37:00,387,I think I am the one in luck. We are going to same camp but just after you are there. We arrive on July 8th for a week. First time there. So if you can call me or e-mail when you get back I would sure appreciate it. I have a fax also if you can fax a small portion of the map. Also have GPS so can use some coordinates if you can save some.We are looking forward to the trip for multiplespecies that we were lacking in Lac Seul.Thanks in advance and good luck.Ron
