506933,Guest,2000-01-31 17:54:00,0,About 2 yrs. ago I was on Pakwash Lake in Ontario and had a bad fishing experience. After finding this site I hope to make it better with you help. I'm going to be there sometime in September and would be most thankfull for any spots you can lead me to. I have a map of the lake so if any of you would like to direct me I'll mark the map.Thank you in advance
506934,Guest,2000-01-31 19:58:00,0,"I'm going there in June, so if I finds some spots I'll let you know.Where did you stay when you were there last time?an dwhere were the spots not to fish?"
506935,Guest,2000-02-01 17:18:00,0,"Hi Ya Fish Dog,We stayed at Snake FAlls and had a bad week. We caught fish but few and small ones. All directions from Snake Falls Camp. By the way it's a good camp.We fished the area in front of Snake FallsThe shore line right across from it. It looks narrow where we fished. Tried both sides.Highline Bay, as you come around the point on the map half way between the bay and the point, north shore. Also fished the bay.We also fished the trout lake river.The mouth of it then move up and fish the narrow part of it and then we went into east lake the south east area. Just to the left as you come into the lake.Everyone said these were good area but we could not do it.Be waiting to hear from you.Thanks for the reply"

We caught a few fish, but I have caught less than a dozen walleyes in two trips. I don't think the lake is very good personally. We stayed at Pakwash Lake Camp and the service was decent, but the boats only have a 15 horse motor so it took forever to get anywhere. I would suggest fishing Walleye Island...it should be labeled on the lake map. Troll spinners with minnows/leeches on the deep side of the island. That is where we had the best luck for bigger fish...near the fifty foot deep water. Also I would try fishermans bay for northern...spoons or mepps aglia spinners were a sure thing for us. It would be a good place for 'eyes in the early part of the year. One other place you may want to try if in that part of the lake is the weedbeds near the Provincial Park beach. We caught some nice pike out of there. I'm not thinking I'll be going back to pakwash anytime soon...I'm going to LOTW this June. One other idea if going up that way in June is to try Gull Rock...I had a friend and three buddies who went through 60 dozen crawlers in four days catching walleyes at that lake last june."
506937,Guest,2000-02-03 20:49:00,0,Walleye-GuyThanks for the input. I've looked at my map and can't find Gull Rock. Could you come back and tell me where it's by.Thanks
506938,Guest,2000-02-28 20:49:00,0,"Lunker, Gull Rock is just SE of Red Lake, or approx. 25 miles N of Ear Falls. I've never heard of anybody I know bragging about Walleyes they got out of Pakwash. Take the advice of the Walleye guy and go to Gull Rock or stop at Lac Seul. rgds"
506939,Walleye-guy,2000-02-29 14:39:00,15,I would agree. Fish Gull Rock or just save yourself traveling another half hour and fish at Lac Seul. Lots more walleyes there. Best of Luck.
506940,Guest,2000-03-01 17:04:00,0,"Others advice is good....go somewhere else. If you are looking for a more out of the way and off the beated path come out of Ear Falls on 657 42 miles to Confederation Lake, South Bay Lodge, only lodge on lake and it's a boat-in. Take a look at web site southbaylodge.com Not overfished and lots less pressure."
506941,Spinnerman,2000-03-02 09:49:00,24,"I have been going to Pakwash for the last nine years and havn't had a bad trip yet, had some bad weather but we still caught fish. We usally are there sometime in early June. We use spinners and nightcrawlers and thats it. On Pakwash if you find the weeds in the bays you will find the walleyes. We hardly ever fish deeper than 6' sometimes as shallow as 3'. Long line spinners right though the weeds with no weight or maybe a spiltshot or two. Some good spots to try is back in Highline Bay around the highline poles, the Snake River falls area is also good, and the sand at the park is good if the wind is coming in there. Time of year is a big key, early June has always been the best for us. Hope this helps. Don't give up on Pakwash yet, there tons of 20"" plus walleyes in there. Good Luck and maybe I'll see you up there.Spinnerman"
506942,Walleye-guy,2000-03-03 11:44:00,15,"Spinnerman, You are correct by saying Pakwash has numerous walleyes over 20"". I have seen some big ones taken out of there, but I've also seen some big ones taken out of some pretty crappy river systems here in Iowa. Lunker Hunter is heading there in September and Pakwash probably wouldn't be his best valued trip. I've heard and seen pictures of people catching lots of nice sized walleyes there in early June when the fish are shallow and congregated. You fish that lake later in the year and you have your work cut out for you. I'm not saying that you can fish all day and not catch a limit, but fish per acre would be much higher elsewhere. The pike fishing on the lake could be very could that time of year though!!!!!!!!"
