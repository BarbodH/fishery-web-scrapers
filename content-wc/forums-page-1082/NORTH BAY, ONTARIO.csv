To get there you take Hwy 11 North out of North Bay and turn left on Hwy 64. The camp is directly off the Hwy, there are plenty other camps on that lake but none are this easily accessable or have as nice facilities. Your hosts Dave and Betty are great two. No, I do not belong to the camp, but my wife and I would not miss a year without staying at least a week there. If you would like more info, just send me an email."

507159,Guest,2000-02-29 07:05:00,0,"I know some folks that went there last year. It was their first time to Canada and they are more accustomed to fishing for bass and trout here in SE PA (witness: they took a flat bottom jet boat). I heard they didn't catch one walleye, but caught a lot of hammer handle pike. They were also only there for 4 days, so I think the lake is better than their experience would indicate. My take on this lake and it's multitude of surrounding lakes that are accessible via Auld Reekie is they are small, so the fishing quality may be sensitive to people pressure and weather - esp.ly relative to a big lake where there are probably more fishable patterns - if one pattern fails, another may work.If you were willing to look at Auld Reekie, you should consider Taggart Bay Lodge on Lake Kipawa. We've fished this lake for 23 years (where do you think my nickname comes from) and will continue doing so for a long time. Like any big lake, the fish are there, as long as you are willing to learn the lake and listen to the regulars and camp owners when they tell you what to do. I see some people coming here for the first time that complain about the fishing yet they refuse to take advice on location and technique. Check out www.taggartbay.com and email Yves (the owner) or me for more info.A little farther north and west is Bertholet Lake Lodge which is worth considering as well. Never been there, but if I get more vacation we may check it out one of these years."
507160,Guest,2000-03-01 18:35:00,0,Auld Reekis is one of the better places in that area - The Whites sold it 2www.taggartbay.com 2? years ago. Gowganda has some Huge walleye - but numbers might not be great - also some good bass.I don't fish Gowganda itself but maybe once every 2-3 years - but do go to the area every year - last 15 or so. I've seen years where walleye were real hard to fond - others where you could slay them. Lots of other lakes in the area - email if you want more and BTW I'm checking out Taggart right now....GwgandaGreat scenery -remote enough - town of 85 and LOTS of lakes
507161,Guest,2000-03-02 18:30:00,0,"I think you have Taggart Bay confused with somebody else. Taggart Bay (Yves & Lise Bouthillette) don't own Auld Reekie unless they bought it on a whim yesterday. I believe Auld Reekie's new owners are shown on their website, which is a decent site. Frankly I like the way they are handling their catch and release program - probably doing the right thing, considering the size of the lake.Have a good one,Kip#1"
507162,Guest,2000-03-02 18:59:00,0,"Auld Reekie Lodge is now owned by Troy and Vickie Wilson. Their website is:http://www.virtualnorth.com/auldreekie/By the way, I mentioned Bertholet Lake Lodge as being northwest - wrong! It's northeast, past La Verendrye park."
507163,Guest,2000-03-03 17:06:00,0,Kip - didn't mean that Auld Reekie was owned by Taggart at all - looked back at the post - see what 'ya mean - Whites' owned it untll last year.One of if not the best of the upper class camps in the area.How about some more details on Taggart - area - price and fish sound good[email protected]http://members.ee.net/phaskins/
