507262,Guest,2000-03-02 11:57:00,0,I started fishing Hay Bay and the surrounding area last year for the first time and loved it. Did't catch huge fish but I know they are there. I am planning on fishing there more this year. I would love to learn more about the area also. So if you like we could share tips.Robert
