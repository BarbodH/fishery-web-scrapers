522197,Guest,2002-07-07 01:34:00,0,"Just heard the walleyes are biting real shallow, 5 ft and less. The lake is pretty high but the fish are biting. Where are you staying? I'm going up the following week to Jim and Julies and my dad will be there the week you are up there."
522198,Guest,2002-07-07 07:12:00,0,"We are staying @ Iversons kingfishers Lodge. Thanks for the reply. We spend most of our time on Walleyes but will be looking into the Smallies also. It will be the second year for the two 10 year old grandsons in Canada. Later, Jay"
522199,Guest,2002-07-07 19:49:00,0,"I just came back today, walleyes were shallow 8-10, smallies biting even shallower, pike were slow but big. It was 90+ for 2 days, water temp was over 80 but came down to 70 by the end of the week. Fish early and late on bright days and rest mid-day. We didn't get many large eyes on this lake but plenty to eat without too much trouble. Took some trips to out lakes and couldn't keep the eyes cause they were to big. Go figure! I have a cottage on Wabaskang so we'll be back in a few weeks."

Would you please let me know how you did and where it was all happening? :)I was planning to take a flat of crawlers up with me. I know that they have to be in bedding and that's no problem. A flat will cost me $40.00 here in Wisconsin. If you know about price per flat and where to find them there, would you let me know?We will be crossing at International falls.If anyone else has info please let me know.[email protected]"
