523276,Guest,2002-08-05 13:28:00,0,I used to live to catch Pike. But during the last few years the greatest Walleye fisherman in the world showed me how to catch Walleye and I have burnt all my Pike equipment.

Burn all your trout equipment and any fly rods you own, any sail boats, and any albums by the likes of Madonna or Britney Spears that you have in the house and you shall truly be saved. Start drinking real beer...Malt Liquor is even better........."

I felt so much better after the fire. Im free of the ""slimy snake syndrome"" and I now have a necklace with a 24 karat Walleye on it that I wear all the time. My wife says Im a better man because of Walleyes. We can actually sit down and communicate better and Im truly committed to our relationship."
