523315,Guest,2002-08-07 08:27:00,0,"There are two different ways I handle a caught walleye. I lift them up with my hand under their belly, fairly close to the head, and if they have some size to them, I will grasp them with my hand just in front of the dorsel fin. Be very careful of the gill plates. They will slice a finger really deep. I usually try to cup my hand over the fish and the thumb on the right gill and fingers over the left gill. This of course is with the fish facing forward.Remember to be very gently with the fish. Apply only enough pressure to control the fish when taking the hook out. Alot of folks will use a dip net for all their fish which is OK, but the thing I find about that is, they are usually flopped down into the bottom of the boat and can hurt the fish. If he's for dinner, doesn't matter. Gentleness I believe is a key to handling walleye. Take a northern or muskie, get out the gun loaded with buckshot.Eyesnatcher"

I fish with barbless hooks only and the barbless hook makes it easy to remove the hook with the fish still at the water. When I catch one that deserves a Kodak moment I make sure to handle her as little as possible and get her back in the water.

I am always cautious when handling fish and I don't think there is enough of an emphasis on that."
