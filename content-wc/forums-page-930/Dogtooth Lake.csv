Anyone been to this lake before that can give feedback? Would like to know about any camping areas on the lake, any inexpensive or low budget accomodations on the lake, and also how safe it is to run a tournament boat on. They were running a pretty big rig on this show. Just want to know how difficult navigation and hazards are. Also, I'm assuming this is the Dogtooth Lake near Lake of the Woods. Thanks in advance for any info."

Dogtooth lake resort is where we stayed and it is not all that expensive otherwise you can camp on just about any island or piece of shore you can pull up on. I think, but am not sure, that dogtooth lake resort is the only resort on the lake. Wayne and Patti jones run the resort and the biggest benefit to staying there is the map that marks all the rocks that wayne gives you. He is not the most helpful guy always when it comes to finding the fish, but he reluctantly gives some advice. It is an awesome lake for big fish, but you will not probably catch huge numbers. We caught alot of fish over ""25 (30 or so) mostly off of one reef. If you have any more questions you can send me an email at [email protected] and I would be glad to answer them as best as I can."

We got a 32"", 3-29's, 4-28's, and 6-27's. However, we fished 12-14 hours a day and only caught 15 fish a boat. the lake can get frustrating, but if you want a shot and the really big one this is place to go. Have been going for 10 years and have caught many over 30 inches with the biggest being 34 inches. Wayne is good and will help with spots."
