It started out kind of rough, due to a broken leaf spring on my trailer. I was worried whether my boat would be coming home with me at the end of the week! The owners, Jerry and Barbara were more than helpful. They soon assured me that the problem would be taken care of. They held true to their word; they actually picked up the new leaf spring in town for me and delivered it to my cabin. Eventhough I caught more walleye in a week than I will catch in the next 20 years, having friendly owners is what puts a camp over the top. The grounds were very clean, and the cabins were immaculate. The fishing was nothing short of amazing...what i dreamed Canada would be. The people we met were so helpful and courteous. They would go out of their way to make sure you were catching fish. Their handyman, Joe, is great, always making sure your needs (or should i say wants) are being met. Would I go back there? ...i rebooked before I left....Nette B"

""ggg"" was up there last year when we were and had planed to go there again. I haven't seen a post from him for quite a while and wonder if he made it back this year. I didn't. I will be going to Finlayson at the end of Sept. and hope I do as well (or better) there. Where on Press did you do the best? Around the small islands north of the big island or somewhere else?"
523297,Nette B,2002-08-07 15:35:00,39,"BD,When we arrived, Jerry showed us to go to shorelunch island. We fished there and had great success. We then fished the reef west of the big island. It wasn't necessary to fish elsewhere. The fishing was too incredible to leave the spot. We fished in about 24' of water. I thank you for informing me of this lodge, and all the great advice you also gave. I liked the place enough that I already rebooked. Thanks again. Give a report on Finlayson when you return.Thanks,Nette B"
