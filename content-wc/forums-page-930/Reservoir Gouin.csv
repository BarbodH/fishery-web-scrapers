How deep is this body of water? Know any tricks to catching 'eyes here? If you have any testimonials on Walleye fishing on reservoir gouin or Oasis De Gouin, please e-mail! [email protected]"
522165,Guest,2002-07-04 14:24:00,0,"I'm fishing the reservoir for the last 8 years; I've got a fishing a remote camp. You would have to excuse my english because I'm a french canadian but I'll do my best. 1- Where I you going exactly?The reservoir is a very big body of water, faily shallow 10 to 25 ft. but some places can go to 85ft.You can ask your outfitter if he got the map with the depht, they are fairly on the market, there are not perfect but still very reliable.The reservoir is very accessible since the last 4 years because of the new lumber roads and quite heavy fishing but remember it's only on 2 months basis so it can support that kind of fishing.The best way to fish the Gouin is JIGGING! period. The average size is 1 to 3pds. average but if you are lucky or good 5 & 6 pounder are not rare.Good colors: white, orange, green.Don't be surprise to get small pickes (15pds).The water this year is very high, so will not see the beautiful sand beaches.Hope you like your stay.Andre"

522166,Guest,2002-07-15 20:12:00,0,"Thank you for the info on reservoir gouin.Your english is a lot better than my French!!!!!Je ne parle pas francaise. I think I said ""I don't speak much French?"" In response to your question of ""where are we going?"" We are heading to OASIS DE GOUIN our camp is approximatly 74 39 30 W Longitude and 48 28 30 N Latitude (map 32B7). I don't know the names of many of the surroundings. We will be equiped to travel aproximatly twenty miles away from camp at the most. (hopefully we don't have to to catch decent walleye). I'll take any recomendations you can give me as to where to go to get away from people and catch fish! My father and his father have been making the trip to Quebec walleye fishing for over forty years. Up until recently we fished La verendere. But it has gotten too crowded for our liking. Used to be you could spend all day on Birch Lake and not see a soul! Not like that anymore. What do you tip your Jigs with? Crawlers, salted minnows, Leeches, or plastic? How is the fishing in August? Thanks again. JAY"
522168,Guest,2002-08-01 10:08:00,0,Thanks Jay. Found a little info on Reservoir Gouin. Any reports on how the fishing has been this summer? Preferably the east side of the reservoir.Jay
522169,nemio,2002-08-06 14:20:00,96,"Excuse me but was away fishing on the Gouin, Lake Ontario etc...Oasis du Gouin is a very good outfitter, well located, good services. Jigging is the way to go. Colors: white, orange, chartreuse. Water is very high this year so fishing is a bit tougher. Maybe worthed to get a guide for a day and after you know where and how and loose lest time.Good fishing."
