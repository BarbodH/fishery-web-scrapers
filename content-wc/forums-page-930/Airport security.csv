523213,Atlanta Dave,2002-08-01 16:33:00,323,Talked to a fellow fisherman who just flew back from Edmonton and they would not allow him to carry on reels filled with line. We have had to check all lures for some time but has any one heard of any instances where reels were not allowed on the plane. Thanks in advanceAtlanta Dave

I got thru with 4 spools of line and 30 pickeral rig style jigs (made of leader cable) in my carry on. At the Canadian airports, they'll check all electronic devices to see if they work. Do yourself a favor, check your luggage avoid the hassle. Avoid my experiance were a new immigrant with heavy accent, in a security uniform, with a minimum wage income can make life miserable for someone. Lady thought my carry on was too heavy."
