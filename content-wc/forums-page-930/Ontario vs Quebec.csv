523131,Basser,2002-08-03 14:56:00,31,Duffy - where do you recommend in NW Ontario? Aleays looking for new spots. Thanks
523132,Guest,2002-08-04 09:17:00,0,"Quebec definitely has the better fishing......the problem is that potential tourists are put off by the language barrier; it's not as accessible and it's a farther drive for most. But the biggest reason Ontario gets more tourists........marketing. Ontario pumps in mega dollars into advertising. Quebec does not. I live in Ontario, and the fishing here is great.... but in Quebec it's better. On a week's fishing trip you may never even see a single soul for days. FYI, most lodges have someone that speaks English."
523133,Tom,2002-08-06 11:01:00,1063,NW Ontario sucks.... at least that is the message I send to everyone so they don't go to my favorite place in the world.... NW Ontario.
523135,duffy,2002-08-06 14:18:00,49,"Frankie,You must live in eastern ontario where all of the roads are. Have you been to the northern part of Northwestern Ontario? It is so remote and under-fished. Basser,I would reccomend a fly-in north of Red alke ontario or lac seul. E-mail if you want info on a few places. [email protected]. Good luckduffy"
523134,Thumper,2002-08-07 19:21:00,133,Theres lots of fish for everyone in NW Ontario. You could fish a different lake every day for the rest of your life and never even get close to fishing each lake. The acces is the problem. There is some overharvest in lakes close to roads but we have come a long way with the new conservation rules.
523121,Guest,2002-07-30 08:25:00,0,"Seems to me that most of the talk is about fishing in Ontario. Is it that much better than Qeubec? I've only fished Quebec and seem to always do great. Not only do we avoid crowds, but also catch our share of large fish (over 5lbs).Heading to Reservoir Gouin this Friday. Anyone have any stories? Why does everyone seem to prefer Ontario?"
523122,GR8WTHUNTER,2002-07-30 11:06:00,618,I too have done far better in Quebec. I have not fished western onterio though because of time and distance. There are quite a few people on this site that are from the mid west and don't go to Quebec for the same reasons. Just a thought. Rich
523123,phishfearme,2002-07-30 13:37:00,1242,jay - just pull out a map of ontario and look at all the blue in the northwest (and so few roads)!! now look where all the population centers and roads are - mostly in the east and quebec. typically no roads and lots of water equals good fishing. obviously the fish don't care about borders and there's tons of great fishing in quebec but for my money i'd rather go to NW ontario even though quebec is much closer for me (and i've been fishing in quebec lots). phish
523124,Dinky,2002-07-30 16:17:00,307,"Have been fishing NW Quebec for over 30 years now and have never had a bad trip.Sometimes the weather doesn't co-operate,but have always caught fish and plenty of them.Gave up on Ontario years back as fishing was getting lousy. Fished NE Ontario from when I was 12 up until I made the switch to Quebec.Never fished NW Ontario as it is a long haul there from Ohio.Most guys on this board are from the mid-west and its just a hop,skip and a jump to NW Ontario. Quebec has some quirks in thier fishing laws(no live minnows)but I have found a jig and a piece of crawler does just fine.Also where I go the wallies are suckers for a trolled shad rap. The past 6 years I have been fishing the Ottawa river,and Lac Simard. Its about 700 miles due North of me and fishing has been excellent for eyes,pike and smallies."
523125,Guest,2002-07-30 17:31:00,0,"I think you guys are discussing apples and oranges. Ontario or Quebec both have a ample supply of fish. I imagine that the number of people on this sight are heavily weighted from the midwest and therefore Ontario is handy and effective. About five years ago I started fishing in Manitoba and still made my trips to Ontario. One year 8 of us went to a lake in Manitoba and estimated we caught over 10,000 Walleye in six days.....it was fantastic. All it proves is that the ""eyes"" are every place."
523126,Guest,2002-08-01 08:06:00,0,"The really big walleyes are in Kentucky. That is true. The problem is that none of you yankees can catch them. Why, cause they have so much to eat-----Shad and little trout, they are full all the time. Which goes back to another question on this site as to why the fish in nw Ontario are biting so well this year, forgage is down."
523127,Guest,2002-08-01 10:02:00,0,"I live near Louisville, Kentucky. Your right about us having the largest walleye. Lake Cumberland in well noted for the walleye size. As well as the Ohio river for Sauger. Seems that no one down here knows how to fish for them. Walleye are over-looked. Overshadowed by all the bass fisherman ""lazy fishermen"". Bass are so predictable.Anyway, we make the trip to Quebec for the peace and quite. Good comrodery and constant fish without having to dodge other boats! Plus no one can call my cell phone while I'm in Canada!!!!!!!!!!!Vacation means no work!!!I'd like to here more about your fishing in Kentucky. Hows Laural lake? Nolin?"
523128,Guest,2002-08-01 11:35:00,0,Hold it there you all....The Kentucky State Walleye Record is 21.8 while the Ontario Walleye record is 22.5. Now Im not sure but I think that takes of that.
523129,Guest,2002-08-01 12:29:00,0,I have the pleasure of fishing with some good old boys from Kentucky every year in Canada. The first year I fished with them I had to show them how to put on a minnow because they wanted to fish with stinkbait. When they saw there first Walleye they were as excited as the day they married their sisters. They are great guys but they dont fish Walleye in Kentucky and they dont fish Brim in Canada.
523130,duffy,2002-08-01 17:42:00,49,"If you compare eatern ontario to Quebec, Quebec wins hands down. If you compare NW ontario north of Red lake to Quebec NW Ont. wins in a landslide. Trust me, I live on the east coast and make the trip to NW ont. every year after getting disppointed for many years in Quebec and Eastern Ontario. It's worth it."
