523257,Guest,2002-08-05 16:57:00,0,"I was 27 miles north of Red Lake , 2 weeks ago , wish i was still there, great walleye and northern area. However it is too far north for smallmouth, actually i think they would live fine, there just aren't any lakes north of Red Lake that have them . There is smallmouth about 50 miles south at Pakwash. I'm not really sure about lakes in the area that have Musky, but i don't think there are many. With the great walleye fishing , and pike and some lakes have lake trout, i could live without the musky, i do like smallmouth though, but you can't have everything."
523258,Goldfish,2002-08-05 18:19:00,6,When are you going and where are you staying?I'm going to Berens on the 23rd
523259,Guest,2002-08-05 18:34:00,0,"Is there a place to stay up on the Berrons River? Drove all the way up there once just looking around, was kind of turned off by the trash thrown in the lake at the docks."
523260,Goldfish,2002-08-06 03:15:00,6,"Yes,its before the end of the road.contact me by e-mail at [email protected] and I'llgive you more info."
523261,Guest,2002-08-06 13:09:00,0,"WELL I STAY AT A FREIND OF OUR FAMILIES ON COLI LAKE ABOUT 35 MILES SOUTH OF THE BERENS AND 22 MILES NORTH OF RED. WE USUALLY FISH WALLEYES AND NORTHERN AROUND COLI AND BERENS.ALSO SOME OF THE SMALLER LAKES IN TEH AREA(SECRET LAKES). THE BERENS BOAT LANDING IS A MESS BUT ONCE YOUR ON THE RIVER IT' UNBELEIVABLE.LAST YEAR WE FISHED A SMALL LAKE THAT CONNECTS TO THE SOUTHSIDE OF RED(CAN'T RECALL THE NAME) BUT WE BOATED A 36"" AND 40 MUSKIES.. AND LOST 2, ONE BIGGER ONE SMALLER. ALL IN ABOUT 5 HOURS. WE TRY TO FISH A NEW LAKE EVERY TIME WE GO UP. SO ANY RECOMENDATIONS WOULD BE GREAT. WE'RE GOING UP AUG.29-SEPT 1st."
523262,Goldfish,2002-08-06 17:13:00,6,"We stay at the campgrounds at the Berens.We catch walleyes at the out going falls buy the ton.We fish the lake too,but the fish are smaller and spread out more.We used to catch a few big northens by accident but they seem to be getting smaller every year."
523263,Guest,2002-08-06 19:14:00,0,"How far away is the outgoing falls from the boat launch, is there a trail down to it where you could walk down and fish from shore, don't really like fishing from a boat above a falls. I'ts good the lake/river is staying healthy i'm sure it gets netted quite often."
523264,Goldfish,2002-08-07 16:35:00,6,"It's about 7 miles as the crow flies 11 by boat.Yes,there is a portage and a small floating dock(10x10)at the bottom.And areas where you can fish from shore. Does it get netted? The natives are usually moose hunting when we are there."
523265,Guest,2002-08-07 19:06:00,0,"Since The Pikangikum First Nations is located just downstream, I'm sure the whole system is utilized, I can only hope their harvest is reasonable and for their own familys consumption. It could be why the walleye seem spread out and small , their the ones getting through the nets , but that is just a guess, of course they may say it's because there is too many tourists fishing their home waters."
