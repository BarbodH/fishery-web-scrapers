Say you get a really cold spring, survival of the new minnows may be very limited which would cause a possible forage shortage. If fish have a lack of forage to eat, they bite very well. So when the opposite happens, plenty of forage, I can assure you that the bite is not as good. And for sure, angler's are for the most part even with the high tech but not necessarily better equipment not much better then they ever were."
523181,Guest,2002-08-07 05:31:00,0,When I first started fishing Walleyes (1955) the fella that I fished with who had been fishing Walleye for 40 years was a true believer in 1) Barometric pressure-riseing best 2) Wind direction 3) Structure close to deep water 4)Fishing slow 5)Depth changes 6) Cloud cover. I have fished based on these premises for 47 years and the theorys work. I have been fortunate enough to boat thousands of Walleyes all over North Amercia and it has been like fishing in Walleye heaven. But the bottom line is simply enjoying natures gift and fishing with some great buddys. Catching is great but fishing is where its at.
523182,IaCraig,2002-08-07 09:16:00,434,"Reels, I'm with you about Minaki. You seem to be a Minaki regular, how often have you fished it this year and has it been slow most the summer? Our group had decent success (see IaTag's post) but we felt that Minaki was slower than normal this year too, and I talked to a couple other groups who were down right disappointed. But since we were only there for 1 week, I didn't know if it was caused by the greatly fluctuating weather patterns we experienced during that week or if it had been that way for most the summer. (Resort owners tend to paint brighter pictures like ""they were really hitting last week!"") IaCraig"
523183,Guest,2002-08-07 16:29:00,0,Just got back from the best walleye fising trip in Lac Seul in 25 years. Would rank the reasons for coninued good fishing in this areathis way.1. Stable weather - this is a must and although the spring weather was wet and erratic the entire month of July was dry and with almost no rain. Continued winds out of the west mae for an excellent environment2. Slot size - over the years having to throw back all walleye 18-21 inches has done wonders for the system and is being implemented all over.3. Just more fish - due to the top 2 factors the numbers of fish have increased making for better fishing.
523170,Guest,2002-07-31 16:55:00,0,"All right all you rocket scientists, why is the fishing so good this year in northwestern Ontario? Did suddenly a couple of million Erie fish move to Ontario? Why? Is there more fish-----where were they last year. How come so many big ones? Maybe the angler's are smarter. We all know better than that."
523171,Walleye Wacker,2002-07-31 18:18:00,6,"The only Lake I can speak for is Lac Seul and I only have the opinion of a fisherman not a Marine Biologist. Lac Seul fishing has been excellent for the last 6 to 7 years ,at least for our group. I would like to think that part of our success is based on the fact that we have fished the lake for many years and have numerous spots and varied techiniques. We try to match the wheather and wind with the spots and the presentation. It takes a lot of documentation but it has been effective. The big fish this year may have been because of a class year but that is just a guess. We have always caught bigger fish during times of changing wheather and this year the rain and the wind had us moving all the time. WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS WHY THE FISHING WAS GOOD THIS YEAR....IM JUST GUESSING."
523172,tracker,2002-07-31 18:38:00,91,"I was thinking about that same question a few weeks ago so I asked my biologist friend why have we seen an increase in the walleye populations in the Thunder Bay area. My thinking was the reduced limits and the one over 18 was the factor, but what do I know. His answer was that we are seeing the product of srong year classes of walleye from the last 5-6 years."
523173,Guest,2002-08-01 05:39:00,0,"The efforts of conservation such as lower limits,slot protection and fisherman who respect the regulations and also believe in catch and release while only eating the 15"" fish are the main reasons the Walleye population is solid. Walleye fishing is like any other sport it is the participants responsibility to protect the integretiy of the sport and the future of the resource."
523174,Guest,2002-08-01 07:59:00,0,"You are all missing the point. The walleye fishing this year has been outstanding. It's not cause you know more spots, better boat control, or have new baits. The fish that are there this year were there last year and maybe an inch shorter. There is not an increase in fish. The fishing this year is one of the best years in the last decade or two according to many anglers. Why is that the case? Clue what about the effects of spring on the whole eco system!!!!!!!"
523175,Guest,2002-08-01 13:34:00,0,EFFECTS OF SPRING ON THE WHOLE ECO SYSTEM....Could you explain that for us old bobber fisherman????
523176,Reels,2002-08-01 17:58:00,2876,"I was wondering why the walleye fishing was so poor this year in Minaki. I guess lakes go through cycles, and the one I am fishing just happens to be down this year and yours is up. <{{}}><"
523177,Wenty,2002-08-02 10:08:00,15,"From Opener through June I fished more than 30 8+ hour days, as I do just about every season. From my perspective, fishing was off this season. I hold the goofy spring and the ensuing weather patterns at blame. I do not remember fishing more than five days with a wind out of the west or south, and that tends to make a big difference on my lake. On several days there was no wind. And rain? I think when a lake comes up over a foot in five days something will change.Don't get me wrong, lot's of fish were caught and released and they seem to be getting scrappier every year, so it was still a great deal of fun.Looking forward to the September-October bite."
523178,Fuzz,2002-08-06 07:17:00,85,"Bingo, you nailed it Wenty. I've been fishing NW Ontario for 12 years, multiple trips per year and ""WEATHER!!!"" is the biggest factor by far in the success of our trips. If you are fortunate enough to arrive during a period of stable weather and pressure, fishing will be great. Yes, going to the same place, learning the areas and techniques is a big help too. Also, I applaud the restricted limits that Canada has implemented and feel it has helped the fishing improve. Get your fill of eating fish while you're up there and don't worry about bringing a lot of fish home. The key is to get with a group that understands that the ""Fishing"" is always going to be great, but maybe not the ""catching"". Finally, I too would appreciate an explanation from ""Poster"" on what the heck he's talking about.Fuzz"
523179,Guest,2002-08-06 14:26:00,0,Im with you boys I would like a explanation of the ###### ECO SYSTEM EFFECT....I personally think that one factor is that all the fisherman are better fisherman today than ever before. With all the information and technology avaliable to us we better be better.....does anybody think they are worse????.....ECO WHAT ????
