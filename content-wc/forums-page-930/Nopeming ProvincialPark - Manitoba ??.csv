523228,Guest,2002-08-08 14:28:00,0,Windsock lodge is on Long lake. It is owned by Tim and Donna Hastings. Nice people and good prices. Fly out available.
523229,Guest,2002-08-08 18:40:00,0,"We were up to Windsock Lodge in June and had a wonderful time, it is on Long Lake 25 miles South of Bisset, the road was very good when we went up there, even with alot of rain we had. We fished Tooth Lake, had some wonderful smallmouth fishing, Tim and Donna have boats on Tooth Lake, need a 4 wheel atv to get in there, but it is well worth it. We were going back, but had a medical problem in the family so we can't make it just now. Hubby is going with the guys in Sept. Windsock is a VERY clean resort 3 cabins and Donna and Tim are exceptional people very friendly and helpful. Check out their web site www.windsocklodge.com or phone them at 204-785-1711.Good fishingpikelady"

523217,Guest,2002-08-02 05:50:00,0,Anyone have info on this area - just north of Whiteshell? I think there is a Bird lake on the south edge with a resort on it. I also have heard of Quesnel on the north edge. I've heard the road through the park is less than desireable.

523219,Guest,2002-08-02 08:20:00,0,"Have fished Quesnel and Manigotagan lakes (they're connected) for many years - both great lakes for Walleye, Northerns and Smallmouth. There are loads of fish and large fish as well if you know the spots. I've seen quite a few Master Angler Walleye and Northerns come out of Quesnel over the past couple of years.Usually fish quite shallow - under 10 feet. Look for humps in the lake - there are a few spots that rise from 25 ft to 8 - 10 feet. If you find these spots fish them - these humps are usually small plateaus that run 50 - 100 yards and they are usually full of fish. Fishing the shallows we usually use spinners without weights - just a snell, 5 or 6 beads and a blade (tip it with live minnows, leaches or 1/2 crawlers). Without weights this set up will drop about 6 - 7 feet which is perfect if you are fishing the humps. If you find deeper humps add weight (1/2 ounce for every 8 - 10 feet).A great spot (which is not a hump) is the inlet to the bay that leads to Happy Lake. Again, it runs about 6 - 8 feet deep and there are a lot of weeds but it is full of Walleye. We run spinners through the center of the channel (you need a fish finder to keep on track or you will foul up on the weeds) or anchor and throw out small jigs tipped with 1/2 a crawler (using 1/2 a crawler is useful for a few reasons - 1. you double your bait, 2. the cut crawler seeps blood into the water, 3. the shorter crawler results in more hookups with the fish).Its a great lake and worth the drive - the road into the lake is fine, just take it easy and you won't have any problems. However, don't drive the main highway at night, there's lots of wild life. I've had too may close calls with Moose on the road at night that I simply don;t drive it after dark any more if I can avoid it."
523220,Guest,2002-08-05 15:45:00,0,"How about a lodge or resort on Quesnel? Also, down on Bird lake, I think there is a Nopeming Lodge if I'm not mistaken. Any word on either?"
523221,Guest,2002-08-06 06:56:00,0,"The lodge on Quesnel is fairly basic. You can get gas and bait there however, you'll pay more for it (they have a somewhat captured market). So bring your own supplies. I think they rent cabins at $60.00 per person per night and boats rent for around $100.00 per day (includes motor, gas, etc.) They also have a camp ground that costs $17.00 per night. Or you can camp on one of the islands for $17.00 + $7.00 for parking per night ($24.00 per night). These are all ballpark figures. Contact Jackson Lodge for exact info.There is a lodge called the Nopeming Lodge on Bird River - this is obviously quite a ways South of Caribou (Quesnel). If you have the choice go fish Quesnel. It's a much superior fishery."
523222,manitobawalleye,2002-08-06 16:15:00,885,i agrre....fish quesnel and you will not be disappointed.....bird is a tougher lake and more pressured....
523223,Guest,2002-08-06 16:29:00,0,I had an old brochure that I can't find now. I think it was for a Windsock Lodge - I thought it was on Quesnel. Am I mistaken on this?
523224,Guest,2002-08-07 06:31:00,0,"Not that I remember. I'm almost 100% sure that there has only ever been one lodge on the lake and it changed hands a number of times over the past 20 years. It was even shut down for awhile (10+ years ago) due to some shady dealings in and around the lodge - so the story goes. However, the family that has the lodge now have put together a good solid business and I think over time they'll have a top knotch lodge.By the way if you go out there and camp, go to one of the islands rather than the camp ground - #1 island is especially nice and it has great fising all around it."
523225,Guest,2002-08-07 15:29:00,0,Does Jackson Lodge have a website?
523226,Guest,2002-08-08 07:58:00,0,"Ya, but it doesn't really tell you a lot. Where are you coming from?Try this site for info.http://www.worldwidefishing.com/manitoba/b1044/"
