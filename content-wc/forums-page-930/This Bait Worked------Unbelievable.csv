523252,Walleye Wacker,2002-08-05 08:56:00,6,I was recently fishing with a old friend in the Mississippi River and he was useing a bait that I laughed at until he caught Walleye on it. He was useing thin strips of beef liver on a jig. He said that he felt it resembled a worm or a leech and he liked it because it was tough and easy to get. Anybody ever heard of it before???

The fact is, with a little practice a jig can always be placed right into the strike zone and I've never seen anyone outfish a good jig fisher. Jigs have always been the best and least expensive way to land nearly any species of fish."
