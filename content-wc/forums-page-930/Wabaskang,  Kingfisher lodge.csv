He was a good host and was always there to help with tips on where to find fish, etc. Give us a report on how it went once you get back as I am interested in going there next year and would like to get a report from someone first.Good luck fishing."
523245,Guest,2002-08-05 12:56:00,0,I'm sure it's the same lodge. Then name that I have is Bill and Char. Iverson. They have had it for over 25 years as I understand. All of the feed back I've had so far is positive.. I'll let you know how it went with us. thanks for the response.

From what I remember, he owned both the Keystone Lodge on Cedar and the Kingfisher on Wabaskang. Both are really good hosts and will treat you right. Good luck again and please do give us a report. Wish I was going, I have to wait till next year September until Reindeer Lake trip."
