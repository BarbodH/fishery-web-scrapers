6731391,combine_billy,2023-04-12 15:00:00,151,"Taking three new people up north on a fly in with me this year, only one has walleye fished before. It should be a hoot. Also rigging up my livescope to take with me this year, I can't wait to see what it will look like up there."
6731439,NM_Trout,2023-04-12 18:40:00,1094,Whoa... livescope on an outpost trip? You are a madman. What are you going to use for powering that up? What display are you using? I have a GPSmap 1022 and I fear that running it off of a small battery would only last a short while...
6731481,Bigtaproot,2023-04-13 04:46:00,900,The rod you made looks real nice along with the flies
6731505,combine_billy,2023-04-13 07:30:00,151,I am going all in and taking my echomap 126sv. I am in the process of building a portable box for it. Definitely going to be overweight this year but am willing to pay the extra fee just to see what it will show (esp for the lake trout). The boats they have up there have a battery in them for elec start on the 25hp tillers. The motors never shut off all day so i am counting on that combo being able to run it. Think that will have enough juice for me to run all day?
6731519,Eckohlt,2023-04-13 07:51:00,3685,Where you headed Billy???

6731539,NM_Trout,2023-04-13 09:10:00,1094,"My work is currently insane. Might be more sensitized to it knowing that I am going to be quitting this year to ""semi"" retire. All I know right now is that June can not get her early enough."
6731581,Eckohlt,2023-04-13 11:50:00,3685,"Ain't no roughing it at that lodge,good luck!!"
6731597,prov1800,2023-04-13 13:27:00,5010,If you ain't in a tent then your defiantly not roughing it
6731057,NM_Trout,2023-04-10 15:28:00,1094,"I'm bringing a noob with me this year to fish Ontario. What a hoot that is to see somebody get spoiled with fishing. Just bought my license for the trip, and have been digging out gear and pre-packing. Also finished up a new 9wt fly rod... I'll have it on the turning rack tonight.Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. I feel like I am a kid waiting for Christmas."
6731061,JAY221,2023-04-10 15:51:00,877,"I agree! I did a trial packing of the car to make sure I could get the trolling motor & battery in with the other stuff! It all fits and I am ready. Later, Jay"
6731069,Camoclad,2023-04-10 16:19:00,628,I'm jealous. No trip for me this year so make sure you do a good trip report with pictures for those of us who will live vicariously through your trips! Ha!Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
6731125,jambi,2023-04-11 07:13:00,504,Four guys in our group haven't been since 2019 so they are getting pretty excited.
6731149,stjoeguy,2023-04-11 08:57:00,979,"I'm excited! It starts when I finalize the group in March. Then it's on to menu planning and buying more line, tackle, etc. Of course I really don't need anything more, but that's part of the looking forward to the trip. Last year a neighbor came along that hadn't fished Canada before and it was like watching a kid in a candy store. I had as much fun watching him as he did catching fish. This year we've got several guys returning after a year or more absence and a new guy to the group that's fished the lake before ,but it's been many years. I enjoy the planning and anticipation, and the fishing is fantastic, but most of all I look forward to spending a week with some wonderful fishing friends! We always have a great time."
6731221,bthomas3333,2023-04-11 17:19:00,465,Must be in the NM water. Same here! 71 days but who is counting!
6731335,MrSimon,2023-04-12 10:26:00,922,I'm guessing the fly rod is for pike? What kind of flies do you like to use? And what kind of leader material?
6731353,NM_Trout,2023-04-12 11:50:00,1094,"Yes... 9wt will be for pike and hopefully for redfish this fall. It is a beater rod, so not very ornate, just utilitarian. The streamers? I tie them on 4/0 and 6/0 hooks. Lead red head dumbell eyes, red thread. Chartreuse and white crystal flash on some, and others trying to mimic electric chicken with fluorescent shrimp and chartreuse crystal flash.About 4"" to 5"" overall, and not a lot of body. I like being able to cast a little further and the wind resistance from a thick body slows things down. Also get a better sink rate with thinner body profile. I also tie up some that are smaller (1/0 hook), and use them for walleye. ""Tying"" flies is a bit of a misnomer for these. This is closer to bailing hay. No precision required, as the first pike that bites this turns it into a mess anyway. I can usually get 6 to 8 fish on one streamer. I will convert that fly into barbless as well as it is safer for those of us on both ends of the action. I use a 40lb flourocarbon leader about 12 to 18"" long. I tie to the fly using a loop knot (sort of like a Rapala knot) to keep action in the fly. I use a fast sink tip fly line. Usually a short 1x or 0x tippet from fly line to flouro.We also bring a floating line, and we tie on deer hair frogs. We don't catch as many pike on them. I think they work better early in the year maybe when the pike are still shallow? Still... when that wake comes up behind the frog it takes a lot of discipline to not set the hook before the fish grabs it :-) Freaks me out almost every single time."

6731371,nitroman,2023-04-12 13:26:00,368,"Excited here as well. 55 days now! I feel it's appropriate to begin going thru the Canada closet and start the Canada pile in the spare bedroom. We also have a Canada box that contains all of our trip stuff for the kitchen and such so I will need to inventory that soon too as a planner by trade trip planning is in my wheelhouse and I enjoy it a lot. I maintain a vast spreadsheet with tabs for every year as well as our living grocery lists and meal plans. It has a calculator for sandwiches that I just plug in the number of people, and it spits out the amount of meat and cheese we need as well as loaves of bread. I just love doing it and it keeps me connected to trip year-round as i tweak the lists according to the group numbers and fill in the names in the meal plans. The end goal is to make the day-to-day stuff mindless and out of site and let the group focus on what makes the trip fun for them. Plus, as I said I am a planner so..... We also have a group chat that we communicate with each other so that helps scratch the itch too."
