6732025,prov1800,2023-04-15 14:24:00,5010,Went for a bit of a drive last evening to a spot I have had some of the best fishing ever.Hiked in a ways and found there was still ice and only some open water.I did attempt to walk out on ice so I could reach open water with my jig but felt like the ice was spongy feeling so I got off of it.Long story short it didn't pan out.Last year was no good either due to flooding and year before that this place was almost dry.But got to try it out.Nice drive through the country and nice little hike.Maybe next year.

6732035,prov1800,2023-04-15 15:49:00,5010,3 bad years lol.ill keep trying though.fantastic fishing when conditions are right.

6732467,prov1800,2023-04-17 06:44:00,5010,We have snow on the ground again to.Winter came back.Highways shut down again.Glare ice from Winnipeg to Thunder Bay.Ice stopped melting now with cool Temps and below 0 Temps at night.Looking good to get out maybe for day on ice.
6732485,N_of_Quibell,2023-04-17 07:39:00,151,"I second what Mr. Krejca said - thanks for the pictures. I really look forward to seeing the illustrated ""news from the north""."
6732525,rockape,2023-04-17 08:41:00,215,What is your prediction for Ice Out in the Vermillion Bay area this year?
6732537,prov1800,2023-04-17 08:51:00,5010,Well since it's middle of April and weather has got ugly its hard to say.All this week we have -5 to -8 nights.That part slows the process.Slush and snow is off the ice now except the snow we got last couple of days.That will go fast with day time Temps which are above zero.Tomorow am planning on ice fishing as I think shoreline should be hard enough to get on lake.Would think sometime 6-7 of May still should be gone maybe give or take a day or so.
6732559,prov1800,2023-04-17 09:27:00,5010,Here's our forecast.All cold nights.Not good for melting ice.Thurs defiantly not looking good.
6732621,Skywagon,2023-04-17 12:12:00,1106,For those not fluent in metric: 0C=32F -6C=21F +7C=45F -40C=-40F Even though walleye season is now closed there are still several days of good ice left to chase lake trout and crappie.
