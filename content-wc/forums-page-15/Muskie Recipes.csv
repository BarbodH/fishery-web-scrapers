6731969,prov1800,2023-04-15 08:20:00,5010,Although walleye do taste good after the breading process they really don't have any flavor in there meat like the other species we have here in Canada.Crappies are good to but again no flavor.Theres nothing like a pike or lake trout.Also smallies and Whitefish.Rather have one of those anyway.Some of them can be harder to catch so there pretty much left alone.Guests I've had that have eaten the other species have really enjoyed them.
6732677,Ricky Spanish,2023-04-17 15:22:00,1298,"The wife caught a 50-1/2"" musky on #6 mono using a 1/8 oz. jig...sort of. The 10"" walleye she was reeling in got t-boned at boat side. You could just see the tail sticking out of one side of her mouth when we netted it. You can see the white tip in front of her left eye. Got it into the boat and when she opened her mouth she wasn't even hooked. No idea why she never opened her mouth in the 10min it took to net her. Good drag on that Stradic and pure luck the line never nicked a tooth. The walleye was beat up some but swam off too."
6732693,Eckohlt,2023-04-17 16:23:00,3685,There animals!!!!
6732697,prov1800,2023-04-17 16:26:00,5010,Awesome Ricky.Ive had many muskies on walleye gear.you either get lucky or not.Usually if they have a walleye they seem to let go but apparently not all.
6732699,7 Mag,2023-04-17 16:34:00,1887,That's a lucky walleye! Great story Ricky!
6732709,Yellowfin123,2023-04-17 17:23:00,2182,"its probably not but I'll ask anyway, is it legal to use a 10-12"" walleye for live bait musky fishing in canada ???"
6732715,prov1800,2023-04-17 17:54:00,5010,That be a big no no.No game fish.Suckers are legal work quite well
6732835,Ricky Spanish,2023-04-18 08:45:00,1298,"Yeah, definitely not. I've heard the guides joke about guests accidentally catching them on ""white tipped suckers"". I even bought a big rubber walleye pattern swimbait. When a musky chases a walleye to the boat I try to chuck that bait out and never caught one on it yet.Back to the original topic, we cut out the cheeks before releasing it and had fried fish sandwiches for lunch. They'll grow back."
6732891,Eckohlt,2023-04-18 11:53:00,3685,"Next 54incher I catch the cheeks are going in the fryer,1st time to try that!thanks for the tip Ricky."
6731171,emma17,2023-04-11 11:13:00,436,Great story. My dad is the same way- you catch it you eat it. Numerous times now when we fish together I've accidentally dropped a nice sized fish into the lake when removing the hook.
6731385,rockape,2023-04-12 14:19:00,215,"I've never kept a musky. Won't either. I've fished for them in Canada, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Indiana 100 miles north of where I live. Canada is the place to go if you want to catch multiple muskies in a day and huge ones too. I have a 54.5 and 52.5 from Canada on Cedar and Lac Seul. Others over 48 as well. My biggest USA musky is 47 out of Vermillion in Minnesota. That is a great lake for them, but I will always drive the extra distance to NWO to fish for them if possible. I only fish for them a few times a year, but I have the right gear, and rarely get skunked. The thing that gets me are the folks that are fishing for walleye and they hook a big musky. They don't have big plyers, a big net, and if you bring a big fish like that in the boat, there are going to be a lot of problems for both the fisherman and the fish. Then there are the inexperienced ones that do vertical holds on a big fish. Now a side note on the topic. When I was a rookie going to Canada for the first time 22 years ago, I didn't know much about the musky scene, but it wasn't long before I wanted to target them as much as possible. The friend that brought me up for the first time used to have a really remote cabin. They were young in their 20's, drove for 20 hours to get up there, and wanted to fish right away. My friend said he caught a 10lb musky, and they didn't have any food. Yep. They ate it. Probably totally illegal. They said it wasn't bad tasting at all. Smaller fish though. We never keep any walleyes over 17.5"". So who here likes to eat Smallies? YUCK!!!"
6731389,prov1800,2023-04-12 14:34:00,5010,I'll bite.Ive had bass and really find them good to eat.Nothing wrong with them.All the breading everyone puts on walleye tastes the same on every fish you put in the pan.Ive had many guys in my boat that wouldn't eat pike or smallies and when we cooked some up and made sure the right guy got them and sit back and watched them guys eat them and say that's best walleye ever we all smiled.lol.Any fish we have up here are all table worthy in my book.Personally my favorite is lake trout but had some Whitefish the other day I caught and that is pretty hard to beat to. UT I do like walleye also.
6731395,walleyecheek,2023-04-12 15:59:00,2231,I'm not sure a guy could even hold a Big Musky on Walleye gear ! 6lb. line 1/8 0z. Jig head no leader !.......SNAP !
6731403,Eckohlt,2023-04-12 16:48:00,3685,"Had smallies,they are great,will continue to fry'em up when caught."
6731407,Eckohlt,2023-04-12 16:53:00,3685,"You can get them to the boat,just can't reef'm in like the pro bass fisherman do to the bass!Not a problem cheeks!"
6731411,prov1800,2023-04-12 16:54:00,5010,Has happened to me many times some snap some don't.Depends how and where there hooje
6731567,Bigtaproot,2023-04-13 11:06:00,900,I dont eat bass but give me a big carp and put it on the smoker and you have a true delicacy
6731961,Esoxmike,2023-04-15 08:05:00,114,"Only time I've eatin smallies was during tough walleye fishing while on back country canoe trips in the Boundary Waters,and outta there they are phenomenal tasting,in some ways better than a Wally,firmer with more flavor.Out of the crystal clear waters of Knife Lake they can't be beat,they reproduce quickly and taking one or two would never hurt populations"
6731965,Eckohlt,2023-04-15 08:09:00,3685,Ditto that!!
6730743,Lmbkiller,2023-04-08 23:44:00,639,A better rule would be 48 minimum. No one keeps muskies. No one really fishes for them either. I would hate to see a kid catch a over 48 Muskie anywhere in Canada and not be able to keep it if they want too. Muskies are muskies and walleyes are walleyes. This ridiculous elitism that is put on muskies (and other gamefish) needs to stop. People need to wake up and learn about actual fishing demographics. There's plenty of info on the web about it. I already know my little piece that is wi and I'm certain it reflects similar to other states/provinces
6730751,walleyecheek,2023-04-09 05:07:00,2231,"""And Now Deep Thoughts by Jack Handy""..........LOL."
6730873,emma17,2023-04-09 16:45:00,436,"When you say no one really fishes for them I assume you mean in Canada? I've seen lots of people fish for them on LOW and Eagle. I know many people fish for them in WI, it seems there are more people chasing Musky than Walleye in the Eagle River, WI area."
6730879,prov1800,2023-04-09 17:13:00,5010,"Best rule there is for muskie is Lac Suel you just can't keep one.Most other lakes have a 54"" minimum.Those are hard to come by on regular basis.Most serious muskie fisherman that come to Canada come here for a reason and that's our fishing regulations.You don't get fishing like ours anywhere.If you did you wouldn't need to come here.Reason is because our rules.You read the rules you and you see you can't keep muskies so don't come simple deal.Anybodyvthat eats any big species of fish here doesn't have any taste buds.Ive had them years ago and there awfully.People that come here like the peace and quite and they don't have to put up with water skiers,jet skis,etc.If the US would have better rules you wouldn't have to stock your lakes all the time."
6730883,RichA$1970,2023-04-09 17:36:00,1159,I just don’t see the point of keeping a Muskie even if it’s >54”. Take a picture and let it live for another day. Replications are pretty good and that gives most of the honest fisherman and extra inch or 2 for a rounding / BS error.
6731051,Mojo-NC,2023-04-10 14:51:00,1929,"Some 50 years ago when I was a young fishing fanatic, we used to vacation in northern Wisconsin every year. My uncle always had a lake house where we could stay. Back then there wasn't anything I would rather do than go musky fishing. I always followed the regulations, but my uncle was an old Swede with a strong Swedish accent and a mindset from the old country. He hated releasing large fish and would say whenever we caught an undersized musky, ""that's not a musky, it's a nordern"". April Fools Day or not, he would keep pretty much everything he caught when we weren't around to keep him honest. He even got arrested for placing traps on floats around the lake that he had brought over from Sweden. Apparently they could use them over there to catch pike. They were a spring loaded kill trap that he would bait with a sucker or a perch."
6731059,stjoeguy,2023-04-10 15:29:00,979,"My grandfather was also from Sweden. He never fished for muskies, but just reading your comment I can hear him saying ""nordern""."

So we’ll supplement it with a newborn whitetail fawn or 2. I go walk the woods just around the time they’re born (soon!) so they can’t get away and ‘zip’ with the Stanley knife and I’ve got some really tender meat. (I felt bad even typing this).

I also think this topic is ridiculous as I'm sure it was a April Fools Post but you never know who is talking real vs playing on a form. A muskie should not be taken much less for consumption period and most sport fisherman would understand why

6728503,bbheli,2023-04-01 09:12:00,1387,I don't agree with this at all. When I was a kid my dad kept a Musky and they are awful and he had some smoked which were also not good. They are a fleshy fish and the fishy taste does not make them a good choice especially over say Walleye Perch and so on. Also given they are a large apex predator the mercury content can be much higher so we will know if you have been eating them cause you will glow. The reason why they should not be kept goes well beyond the conversation of food and most fisherman get it.
