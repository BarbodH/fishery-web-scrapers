6733591,Eckohlt,2023-04-20 14:02:00,3685,"Less potatoes in the gut,the more eye you can eat,so it's really not a bad trade off."
6733645,JAY221,2023-04-20 15:54:00,877,"No way would we go without potaoes!! I would have had to make the run to town. Probably be setting there in the morning when they open. Potatoes with onions is always ate by us. Later, Jay"
6733647,walleyecheek,2023-04-20 16:30:00,2231,"Come on ! You know better than that ! ....Fried walleye, fried potatoes and onions(with a little Mrs.Dash original and Bourbon baked beans !!!!!"
6733653,Andre (wallyandre),2023-04-20 16:46:00,2274,"False! Except for chips, soda, beer and alcool. Chicken, beef and vegetables are cheaper and the quality and the choices of vegetais much better in Canada and don't forget that a $100 Can cost you $67US. I know what I'm talking about I'm a Canadian that stays in upstate NY for the summer and do my grocery in the state because the rules for the goods is very strict for us Canadians."
6733673,walleyecheek,2023-04-20 17:32:00,2231,Um ! I'd have to beg the differ on the Beef !
6733675,Eckohlt,2023-04-20 17:41:00,3685,I don't know better than that!!!
6733677,Andre (wallyandre),2023-04-20 17:43:00,2274,To get my beef at a similar cost I buy it at Sam's Club. With 25 years of shopping in the US I'm not saving on my grocery and even more costly since our money is at 36% less. I can't see where you are paying more in Canada when your money worth 36-37% more?
6733733,prov1900,2023-04-21 00:07:00,544,"And I will say it (*not that I really/truly am bothered by it)....but where we go there are Canadian check out lines and American check out lines. Pretty sure the math goes in their favor, as in Canadian math when it comes to American cash. But I'm on vacation in God's country and it is what it is. So, even though the exchange is in my favor, the store is winning big time. Illegal? Maybe. But I still don't mind."
6733765,cuamb,2023-04-21 06:15:00,203,The only advantage to buying in the US is it allows us pack everything better. We do buy a lot at the Safeway in Dryden and no one ever seems to have room in their coolers. I guess we just need to plan better. I don't feel it is any more expensive than the US.
6733777,Pooch,2023-04-21 06:58:00,4618,"^^This^^ Grocerie stores in Canada many times have better fresh food selection than here in Central Illinois. They have a couple rye breads that we always try to find, too. Agree, it is easier to pack a cooler before leaving and not touch it until we get to the lake. We always leave one tote empty for food we buy north of the border. Beats having a bunch of loose bags to deal with unpacking. Sometimes what we buy and where depends on border crossing times. Buying food and fuel in Canada helps pay for the roads we drive on getting to where we want go fishing. Support them. Pooch"

6733587,chscwi,2023-04-20 13:58:00,6,"We used to go camping up the Graham Road, +2 hours from the nearest grocery store. One year we stopped in Upsala to get some food & beer on our way up because we bypassed Thunder Bay(our usual stop). They had everything we needed so we went and set up our camp. The next day we caught some fish and got out the bag of potatoes we had bought the day before for our first shore lunch of the trip. Turns out the potato in the center of the bag was rotten. You know the saying one bad apple ruins the whole bunch, well it is true with potatoes too. So then we had to decide whether or not to make the 5 hour round trip to get potatoes or go without them for the week. We decided to not lose a day of fishing over some potatoes. The shore lunches weren't the same but we laugh about it now. So the point of the story is if you are buying your stuff up there(we always do) check anything that can rot before leaving town, Those small towns probable don't get their produce rotated out as fast as the larger towns."
6732983,Terwalleye,2023-04-18 17:55:00,166,Sorry if I missed it folks. Went back several pages looking so apologies in advance. Eggs? Chicken? Poataoes? not being a stcikler just wanna follow the rules. Go stop for perishables either way Thanks in advacne Terwalleye
6732987,Eckohlt,2023-04-18 18:18:00,3685,No live or dead bait.
6733057,prov1900,2023-04-18 23:56:00,544,"Well, just reading the customs page, looks like eggs, as long as they are commercially processed, i.e. stamped product of USA and not from a private farm/backyard....are allowed. Potatoes, commercially packaged and ""grade 1"" are allowed. Same with poultry. All of this ""chicken wise"" is a go if there are no current avian flu outbreaks going on. So that said, I will still buy all my stuff up there. Apparently ""weed"" and firearms are also prohibited. Good to know"
6733077,btyreprich,2023-04-19 04:29:00,1067,I agree with your post - seems like any and all poultry products unless commercially prepared - like frozen fried chicken - are prohibited at this time. You hear about potatoes being banned like every other year but the border guard said potatoes in a sealed bag from a grocery store are fine. Those potatoes from your garden or the local farm stand are almost always prohibited. Border guard told me the bags of potatoes have very little to no soil on them.
6733199,That Minnesota guy,2023-04-19 09:38:00,8293,"This topic always makes me smile. Guys spend hundreds, sometimes thousands of dollars to fish in Canada yet worry about bringing a few dollars worth of food across the border. Another $25-$50 per guy won't make or break the trip yet it would enable most to eat like Kings for a week. Grab your tackle, grab your clothes, grab your rain gear and go. It's a closely guarded secrete but Canada has grocery stores also! Just kidding.....kind of."
6733223,btyreprich,2023-04-19 10:07:00,1067,No argument on this Minnesota Guy! Of course the prices are much higher there than in the states. I was the camp chef and was proud of the meals I prepared for our group and how much I saved by buying groceries when on sale. I know some guys are fine with sandwiches for dinner and that's fine. We preferred to eat differently. Living in the Chicago area allowed me to do this what with the number of grocery stores in the area.
6733229,jambi,2023-04-19 10:17:00,504,We have to get the Canadian Rye Bread at Safeway in FT Frances so we grab all the perishables here too
6733235,guidedfishing,2023-04-19 10:23:00,531,"Nope it certainly won't. That being said a quick read of the Canadian websitehttps://inspection.canada.ca/food-sa.../1389630282362 clearly states, egg's, chicken, potato's commercial packaged and products of the US are OK to bring. I will caveat and say that is what the website says today. To me it's not about stopping or not stopping at the all elusive Canadian grocery store. It is more about the time, typically most groups have their groceries purchased by one member of their group that knows exactly what is needed for the number of folks and days. This is typically purchased a day or two before locally neatly boxed or stored in coolers. It sure makes it simpler to just go fishing, then making an on the fly grocery stop. And for some folks $25 bucks saving per person may be a big deal, IDK. I have done it both ways, and the bigger the group the less headaches having it all pinned down and boxed up before you hit the border. The money savings really does not mean much just saving the headache of doing it on the fly is worth it IMHO. It really comes down to what works for each group, and besides I think about every group has that one guy that has to get the ketchup flavored chips that you can only get in Canada. lol."
6733237,Eckohlt,2023-04-19 10:24:00,3685,"Canada doesn't need to get every penny of a fishing trip,spread it around,the states some and Ontario much more!"
