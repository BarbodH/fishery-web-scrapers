6728057,Lktrician,2023-03-30 14:39:00,32,I have a week booked for the second week July. I was with a different group last year and we did pretty good but hoped that maybe anyone who has been there around that time might have some advice. I'd really appreciate it. Our plan is to jig for eyes but I'm bringing some lures to try a bit of trolling

6728701,fishron,2023-04-02 05:22:00,317,"Don't know if you have followed advice to P.M. Hebert fishermen but here's my take. I like to troll as well as jig but Hebert is a much better jigging lake. It's not a large lake considering the 25 horse motors that Air Tam provides. My three trips to Hebert were all the end of June and 20 to 25 was the effective depth. Although we explored the whole lake there were a half dozen spots that would produce good to insane walleye fishing. My last trip in, I fished one of these spots on our last day and caught 50 plus quality walleyes after our evening meal in just over two hours and left them biting. I probably won't make another trip to Hebert, (pushing 80) and after four hours fishing trout in a cold stream yesterday have come to realize certain limitations. Hebert will remain the hottest walleye lake of my fishing career. Will be fishing Lady Evelyn this June and have high expectations. P.M. if you want info on some spots. Ron"
