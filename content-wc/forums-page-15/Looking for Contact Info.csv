I have been to Morrow Cottages on King's Lake (below ice dam on Crotch Lake) in Township Of North Frontenac, Ontario several times. The area with the cottages is accessable by Morrow Road, which is off of route 509 north of Snow Road Station. My question is...Does anyone have the contact information for the owners of these cottages? I would love to return to this area, taking a couple of friends and family along for the journey. If anyone could assist with this information it would be greatly appreciated."

6731047,maintech,2023-04-10 12:45:00,2,That's the place. Thanks for trying. Im hoping someone can assist.
6731243,Namegosikaa,2023-04-11 19:05:00,61,You might want to post this question in the ontario fishing community site. That sight seems to have a group of people with more knowledge on the eastern side of the province. Good luck

6731333,MrSimon,2023-04-12 10:24:00,922,Where in PA are you from? And where else on the East side of Ontario do you like to fish. I'm also from PA and am always looking for places that are 12 hours or less.
6731383,NM_Trout,2023-04-12 14:18:00,1094,Have you tried contacting someone at www.northfrontenac.com ? Looks like they have a municipal page as well : 613-479-2231
