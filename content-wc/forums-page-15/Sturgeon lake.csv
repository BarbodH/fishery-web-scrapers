6730989,guidedfishing,2023-04-10 07:19:00,531,"Sorry, I just saw your follow up post. Ok I have never stayed at Lumber Jack on the south end. Depends on the time of year. If you are early in the spring and the water is high enough maybe try and get into Jackpot a early spring shallow water bay area if you are chasing walleye. Another option is the run back into Cobb Bay, it will be a pretty good run, through 3rd, 2nd, and 1st bay and ultimately get back into Mosquito bay, you will need to pick your way through some channels. Its been many years since I fished the south end. I moved to the north end as I preferred the walleye fishing on that end, and it put me closer to the out lakes I like if I am so inclined. I expect your camp can help you out on the south end far more than I can. They may even have some boats cashed on out lakes you can use. Great lake trout fishing off the deep edge of Mountain Island, but seriously deep water all over and you can find the lake Trout just about every where. You may find better walleye fishing on the out lakes, and I think the run to the North end is probably out of the question. I prefer the North east arm but that would probably be over a 100 mile round trip for you. Not to discourage you but often first time fisherman of Sturgeon find the walleye fishing challenging. And like all Canadian shield lakes you can be in 80-100 ft of water and the next min your lower unit is missing. Any map you have or chip you use do so with caution and just as general navigation. Sturgeon is notorious for its underwater reefs and rock points sticking up in the middle of no where just under the surface."
6731359,Bill Krejca,2023-04-12 12:08:00,6107,"I fished the north end of Sturgeon a long, long time ago on walleye opening week. For us, the walleye fishing was relatively slow, but we finally got into them, fishing the warmest water we could find. The trout fishing was quite good, relatively speaking, just found an island with deep water very close, used dead bait. I never went back, as it was not a great walleye location, for me, at least, where we fished; time of year, to be fair, seems to have a lot to do with it on this large, deep lake. Perhaps had we run farther, we would have found larger sections of shallower, warmer water where the walleye were more active. Everything previously stated about unmarked rock is correct. Unless the map(s) has been updated, the number of unmarked reefs just under the surface is substantial, my friends who had fished it for a number of years modified their motor on occasion. Those going there could have a great time, it is a pretty body of water, and probably holds plenty of fish, but I strongly advise that your map be judiciously marked up by the resort owner who is renting you the boat and motor. Bill"
6731469,hiwayman,2023-04-12 21:54:00,201,"Thanks everyone. should be an interesting trip. will have my own boat, and, like everywhere else in Canadian water, we won't be going cruising across the lake at a high rate of fuel consumption the first time across the water. Unless we're following someone that knows the way, we go slow the first time and mark the rocks. We fish the English river in the lount lake area at times and unless you've been there before, have to be very careful of the rocks that at times let sea gulls , walk on water lol. In 30 years, we've only destroyed one prop and never had an issue with lower units."
6730719,hiwayman,2023-04-08 19:53:00,201,Has anyone fished Sturgeon lake north of Ignace Ontario? Just wondering how the fishing was there
6730753,btyreprich,2023-04-09 05:20:00,1067,Following!
6730755,Shane Denotter,2023-04-09 05:25:00,39,"I haven't fished the south side but i have on the far north out of trappers point camp. very clear water but watch out for rocks.it can go from 100 ft to 8"" in a hurry. Wife and i only fished northerns and didn't go after any walleye"
6730761,Pooch,2023-04-09 07:02:00,4618,Wife and I fished the middle part of the lake many years ago and it was gin clear and devoid of walleye. Camp was full of Lake trout fisherman.Buddies recently fished the north end and did OK on walleye.Seems to depend on where on the lake you fish.Pooch
6730765,cuamb,2023-04-09 07:06:00,203,My wife and I fished the south end one day last year and boated 11 Lake Trout. We did not try for any walleye. I have friends and family who stay on the north end and they do really well on walleye in both size and quantity. They have been going for years and they do run a long way every day.
6730779,Baseline,2023-04-09 07:49:00,3207,"I haven't been to Sturgeon for awhile as we choose to fish other lakes around the Ignace area. Sturgeon is as good a walleye / lake trout lake as any other in the area. When we went to Sturgeon we stayed at Moose Creek Camp which is on Young Lake. Sturgeon is just a short drive. Moose Creek is a bit rough around the edges, but they were making improvements and upgrades to the cabins the last time we were there the year before the pandemic closed the border. Young is a decent walleye fishery and there are some monster pike in there. We also drove to several other lakes in the area Panasi, Lake of Bays, Eva. Also stopped at Silver Dollar and spent the day on the English River as we made our way back to the USA. Also, check out Agimac River Outfitters which is located just north of Ignace. It is on Indian Lake and you have road access to several other lakes in the area. They have nice cabins and the resort is well run. The Agimac area is also one of few areas where USA citizens can camp. Over the years we have spent lots of time remote camping on lakes in the area. I veiw trips to resorts like Moose Creek and Agimac ""as adventure trips"" as we go to several different lakes and do some organic search and find fishing instead of setting up at a resort and going to the well known fishing hole day after day. Another place to check out is a remote cabin located between Godden and KuKukis Lakes. You access the cabin by water putting in at Heathwalt Lake using resort boats. It is owned by Cobblestone Lake. It is a nice cabin with solar power. Kukukis has no road access except on the far north end which is chore to get to. Kukukis is probably one of the premier walleye, smallmouth and pike lakes you will ever fish."
6730799,Eckohlt,2023-04-09 09:00:00,3685,you sure get around when your in Ont.
6730823,Baseline,2023-04-09 13:41:00,3207,Getting around is one of the benefits in living 2 hours from I-Falls or Pigeon River and enjoying the experience of new water to fish and allocating the time to do it.
6730911,hiwayman,2023-04-09 21:32:00,201,"We're camping at lumber jack lodge on the south end. We picked this lake because it has Lake Trout and walleye.We've fished Canada for many years, but first trip to this lake. Just wondering how it will be.Thanks to all the answers."
6730973,guidedfishing,2023-04-10 06:55:00,531,"Hiwayman, I fish Sturgeon lake at least once a year, I started out on the south end over 20 years ago, and primarily fish the north of the Sturgeon narrows for the last 15 years. Sturgeon is a great lake trout and big pike lake. It also has very nice walleye but you may have to cover a lot of water, and can be a tough nut to crack some days. Since it is big water it can get angry in a hurry when a storm blows through. You can be tucked in one place come around the corner and be facing 5ft plus waves in another. I can try and get you on the right track depending on what you are chasing. A lot of folks that are new to Sturgeon often target many of the out lakes near by for their walleye until they learn Sturgeon. Either on the south end or north end. Lots of good lakes all with a little different attitude. Over the years I have found the Walleye fishing good on Sturgeon as I learn something new every year. Its a huge piece of water largely underfished, its not uncommon for myself to make 1 1/2 hour runs on plane to some of my favorite areas. Also Baseline indicated the lodge on Indian lake, I am not even sure they are open. I fish that corridor as well, and many good lakes in the area. The last two years I have driven past Agimac River camp the place was completely boarded up. I typically fish Flatrock lake via Arethusa which is about 30 miles of sometime not so good dirt road. Agimac is at about the 18 mile mark. Yes good lakes, but many of the landings or trails into to specific lakes are very hard on gear or should not be attempted without at least two 4X4 trucks as some of the landings are steep. I usually fish both these areas at least once yearly, sometimes I sneak in a little more if I can slip time in between family functions. Let me know what you guys are chasing and I will see if I can cut down on your learning curve."
