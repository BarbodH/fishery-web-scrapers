Planning on applying for my 2023 RABC Permit this week,and am noticing that on the 'lists of primary identity documentation' that proof of COVID-19 vaccination must be included. Am I looking at something that is outdated? I thought the borders were wide open now, and that this COVID doc. requirement has been repealed. Thanks in advance. As mentioned, maybe I am looking at something outdated, or perhaps the Canadian govt. is not even accepting these applications yet?"
