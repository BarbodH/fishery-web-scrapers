6732311,prov1800,2023-04-16 13:33:00,5010,Cheaper to buy some OFF cheaper.Diesel expensive.ill see if I can get you bear fat.It will smell better better and won't get get you high.
6732149,Eckohlt,2023-04-16 07:22:00,3685,"The next generation will be reading n watching videos of the last great guide,(prov 1800)"
6732157,prov1800,2023-04-16 07:39:00,5010,Let's hope that's not for a long time yet.Back into winter here here again.Highway shut down again.Semi jack knifed between kenora/vermilion bay.
6732177,Eckohlt,2023-04-16 08:15:00,3685,It's got 34 days left to turn into soft water!
6732179,prov1800,2023-04-16 08:22:00,5010,Be all good by then.we will be on plus side this week during the day but we dip below zero most nights so that tightens ice up again.But month is a long time.May 6-7 should be normal ice out.
6732181,Yellowfin123,2023-04-16 08:26:00,2182,"a club in the boat is still the norm in alot of places today, seems harsh but the fish will have a knife ran thru it a little later anyway i guess, just keeps them from tearing up the boat... i had an old boy tell me that back in the day the native guides would just rub diesel fuel on themselves for the bugs"
6732195,Eckohlt,2023-04-16 08:43:00,3685,Did they light up a cig after there covered in fuel???
6732199,Yellowfin123,2023-04-16 08:51:00,2182,"that wouldn't hurt anything, you can hold a lighter up to diesel and takes a few seconds to get going when burning wood piles"
6732201,prov1800,2023-04-16 08:52:00,5010,So as far as clubs go I still see them for sale in tackle shops.Ive never bought but do have a awesome piece of driftwood I've had for years.Only ever used it on Lac Suel as you can't passes any live fish in the boat.So the club gets used quite a bit when iam out there.Actually bringing some ice in a cooler killing your fish and keep them on ice rather than live fish in your live well tank when water Temps start to warm is a great idea.
6732205,prov1800,2023-04-16 08:56:00,5010,"So keep the bugs off you,possible set yourself on fire and get high sniffing diesel fuel.lol.Some of the old native guides I know used a more natural bear fat."
6732207,Eckohlt,2023-04-16 08:57:00,3685,"Cheaper to just get a strong stick from the woods,same results."
6647126,Obabikon,2022-04-12 06:21:00,2370,"Pretty cool. I cringed a little at the clubbing and gaffing of a 20LB pike, but it was a very well done video."
6647162,RichA$1970,2022-04-12 07:45:00,1159,"I thought the same thing when I saw that. Other than that it was a good watch, however that was a hard life he lived"
6647174,Bill Krejca,2022-04-12 07:59:00,6107,"Ha! Yeah, certainly had some of the old influences pretty well engrained. Not to criticize, we has a different mindset long ago, which slowly changed as the fish became less plentiful. The story just reflected how it was, which made it interesting. I remember making a ""muskie club"" in woodworking class as a kid, teacher had to think about whether this was a good idea at the time, finally let me make it!! Most guides in the 1940's had a club in their boat, as standard of equipment as a paddle. Bet younger folks reading this today never even heard of one!! Times change!Bill"
6647192,Walleye2242,2022-04-12 08:47:00,263,This was a great watch. YES...times do change. My gramps had a club in the boat. Also a Gaph(?) hook and back in 1979 i was taught to hold Northern Pike by the eyes???!!!! I am sure you all remember those days.
6647226,emma17,2022-04-12 10:03:00,436,When I fish with my dad (80+ yr old) large Walleye we caught have several times accidentally slipped out of my hands and into the lake. The only reason we bring any fish home from Canada is to avoid his wrath.
6647318,Walleye2242,2022-04-12 15:11:00,263,So true. Since my dad and gramps passed away....I have not brought a fish home in 15 years now. I keep 1 a day to eat. the rest go right back to the lake.
6647776,dmorgan4,2022-04-14 06:36:00,14,"Such a great video. We stayed in the Highlands area for vacations for over 40 years but not in Algonquin. The lakes, people, fishing are special as were the times our families and friends were there. Times have changed everywhere and it is good to honor a man such as Frank. Special, knowledgeable and practical. I loved the video and the personal memories it brought back. Thanks for posting."
6731971,Esoxmike,2023-04-15 08:21:00,114,"I have the book,great read.Also leaves ya with a tear in your eye"
6732041,Ohio fisherman,2023-04-15 16:36:00,988,"This guy's story is interesting. Back in 1974, I did a 63 mile canoe trip. Went in a big oval. The park was beautiful."
6732123,Esoxmike,2023-04-16 03:42:00,114,"I got to watch it last nite,nice documentary but you gotta read the book.The video doesn't go in depth into his life much at all,struggle with extreme alchoholism,how he met his wife,other characters from Algonquin and the childhood stories are fascinating-If you like the docu read The Last Guide"
6646680,7 Mag,2022-04-09 14:27:00,1887,"Wow, thanks for posting I really enjoyed the video."

6646690,Eckohlt,2022-04-09 15:24:00,3685,"I have the same mind set,simple life,lots of fishing n lots of guiding."
6646706,fishron,2022-04-09 17:02:00,317,Really an interesting story of a guy who lived the dream. I don't see anything in the story that says he ever wanted anything other than the life he chose. Algonquin is a Canadian treasure. My brother and I took two week long canoe trips fifty years ago in the park. Wish I had to opportunity to meet Frank.
6646826,Bill Krejca,2022-04-10 15:16:00,6107,"Thanks, Derb, yup, good story!! Bill"

6646620,That Minnesota guy,2022-04-09 08:13:00,8293,Very good story of simpler times. His business looks to be in good hands. His life and the film is a love story on many levels. R.I.P. Frank.
6646628,RichA$1970,2022-04-09 08:45:00,1159,"Old school. Like he said, no fancy boats, electronics or gadgets. True guide and respect."
6646630,HeHooksHimself,2022-04-09 09:07:00,725,What a way to enrich this day! Great story and we need more of this and less of the strife of what the world thinks is important! Much respect to Frank and all the best to Sharleen as she carries the torch. Fish On! Frankie! Hooks
6646652,Yellowfin123,2022-04-09 10:57:00,2182,"with no tech he kenw the waters better than the fish did.. much respect. you could live the high dollar life on wall st or the complete other end of the spectrum like he did, he had the better life..."
