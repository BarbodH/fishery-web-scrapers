6730645,Ohio fisherman,2023-04-08 11:01:00,988,"That Cherokee is a nice plane. I never flew one but admired them. Growing up in a plane is a privilege. High wing limits visibility as much or more than low wing. The 206 is a real workhorse and fast when not heavily loaded.My father in law owned three nice planes so we flew a lot. Two in Ohio and one in Florida. He was a good pilot. I stopped flying about 10 years ago. Have thought many times about getting an ultralight, but then reality sets in.One time in Alaska, our group chartered an Otter and pilot for the day. We fished at 3 different locations. One location was a large shallow area of a lake. The pilot set up the plane for drifts and I fished from the floats catching big pike. After drifting, taxi across the lake and back upwind to set up another drift. We flew coastlines finding bears. We flew extreeeemly low in river valleys. The pilot was extremely skilled, but a few areas were a little questionable - but everyone loved it."
6730693,Skywagon,2023-04-08 16:56:00,1106,"Moosbunk, my first plane was a 1969 Cherokee 140, good memories, wish I had a picture of it like you do of your dad's. I bought the plane and bartered with the neighbor to teach me to fly. 4 planes later I have settled on a Cessna 185."
6731647,Ohio fisherman,2023-04-13 20:52:00,988,Skywagon - the 185 is a great plane. Would love to see photos. Curious about how you have it configured.
6731679,Skywagon,2023-04-14 05:48:00,1106,"Ohio Fisherman- the plane is a 1980-185F Cessna with a 300 HP IO-520 Continental and a 86"" 3-blade seaplane prop. It has an upgraded panel, IFR, autopilot, with 2-GPS moving maps and a engine analyzer. The floats are the composite 3500 Aerocets (light, tough, don't leak). I added extended wings with VG's which gets it off the water more quickly, plus they lower the stall speed and increase the legal payload."
6731689,Golden Eagle,2023-04-14 06:44:00,2642,Nice!. Did lake water make it to your storage shed last May?
6731749,Ohio fisherman,2023-04-14 11:20:00,988,"Skywagon - you have the plane totally optimized! It must be wonderful to fly with those improvements. Those airframes are great, and perfect to optimize with current equipment. I love the hangar / boathouse. We were going to do the same thing here at our home, but I made the tough decision to stop flying. Long story, but not related to any flying issue. My wife became disabled and could no longer go flying. I realized that if something happened to me, she could not live alone and would need to live in some assisted living or nursing home. The risk was not worth the result."
6731763,Skywagon,2023-04-14 11:58:00,1106,"The water just barely made it into the hangar, did no damage, but I did have to replace 2 of the floating docks. Much higher water occurred at the cabin between Sioux Lookout and Pickle Lake, it was all the way under the cabin but did not reach the floor. I had 7 docks and lumber scattered both up and down the lake, the solar panels that are mounted on logs floated 40 feet to higher ground. Crazy high water! Included are a couple of picture of the water at the hangar. I had the door open when the mechanic was doing the annual inspection, a pair of mallards came floating in and walked around."
6731765,Skywagon,2023-04-14 12:01:00,1106,"Sorry to hear that. Sometimes we have to make the tough decisions, that would be a difficult one, but it is quite logical."
6731795,prov1800,2023-04-14 14:47:00,5010,Nice plane Sky
6732047,Ohio fisherman,2023-04-15 16:43:00,988,"Thanks my friend. What I wrote was not what I meant. The decision was easy, but based upon tough circumstances. The day when I realized that without me she could not live independently, I explained to wifey that I would no longer fly. She thanked me but was a little sad. I told her it was a privilege to do that for her. She is still living at home."
6729965,Eckohlt,2023-04-05 17:39:00,3685,"I just put a extra cushion on the boat seat,then I feel like I'm in a ranger."
6729967,prov1800,2023-04-05 17:39:00,5010,14 ft gets old in a hurry 16 ft much better
6729977,Eckohlt,2023-04-05 18:09:00,3685,"They don't get old when you been using them for 61yrs,what gets dam old is smelling the fumes from those old 2 stroke motors,dam things will kill ya!"
6729989,SweetD,2023-04-05 19:38:00,243,"Eckohlt hit it on the head there!!!! Those **** two stroke motors were brutal. I typically captain the boat I’m in and sucking those fumes day after day after day cannot be good. With the new 4 stokes rarely turn the motor off. Back troll, drift, vertical jig all with motor running. Super quiet, fume free and allows you to stay positioned on the fish without ever dropping the anchor. Rarely do I use an anchor anymore with the new 4 strokes. With the old 2’s would lobby for regular periodic breaks to jig just to inhaling another breath of oil/mixed gas fumes!!! At times felt like a cheech and chong episode with that cloud of smoke following you around.Happy fishing this season and let those float planes roar!!!!"
6729993,prov1800,2023-04-05 20:31:00,5010,Eck you need to upgrade to a different outfitter with 4 strokes.Didnt know some outfitters still use them.lol.
6730019,Eckohlt,2023-04-06 04:02:00,3685,"With a upgrade to new outfitter,you also need to upgrade your wallet,ya there are some that hang on to those old mercury motors."
6730545,Ohio fisherman,2023-04-08 02:55:00,988,"I still fish with Mercury 2 stroke outboards. Love them!I love the sound and sight of a floatplane of course a Beaver is best.My flying days are over, but it was great.My son has a beautifully redone Beaver on floats that he flies all summer in Alaska guiding fishermen.He is a third generation pilot."
6730571,Pooch,2023-04-08 05:46:00,4618,The upside to the old two stokes is.... no bugs. Kind of like fishing with a guy who smokes a big old fat stoogy.Pooch
6730585,Eckohlt,2023-04-08 07:07:00,3685,"Your right pooch there bug free motors,I'll take a few bugs and less noise with a 4 stroke."
6730595,Moosebunk,2023-04-08 07:25:00,211,"The Otters more but the Beavs a little, I don't know what it is but on returns from fly-in trips they can get right nauseating... Flew a lot in a Cessna 206 back in the day and it was and still is the favorite. Do have this old pic of my Dad's Cherokee... Used to keep it at the airport other side of town and take me up often as a kid. I used to think flying towards and into clouds might get us killed. lol. And Dad, he'd practice his stalls up there for fun and scare the shiznit out of me. 400-500 foot drops my butt would come out of the seat and I'd feel the seatbelt strap tighten across my legs. lol. We'd be floating as the plane was falling. lol. Cherokee was a great plane but the wings underneath do spoil some viewing... I guess as a little kid though, just being raised up with one was a privilege."
6729797,prov1800,2023-04-05 10:48:00,5010,Thought some of you guys that flyout would like to hear the sound of a beaver taking off.This was last Aug when I was dropped of with a couple of guests from Alabama to Zizanis Lake for a daily fly in.Turn up the volume.https://youtu.be/DVCu7lyAlJk
6729841,stjoeguy,2023-04-05 12:12:00,979,"I'll be hearing that or an Otter in September. Thanks, John!"
6729845,prov1800,2023-04-05 12:16:00,5010,Gets your blood going when they fire up.
6729899,Skywagon,2023-04-05 14:53:00,1106,"John, I think we are going stir crazy sitting in the house today waiting out this snow storm. I agree, the sound of a radial engine is sweet.Sorry no sound, it's gone silent until open water."
6729901,Walleye2242,2023-04-05 14:59:00,263,I fished that lake for a day fly in way back when gawley owned it all. Fished quite a few of those 1 day fly ins. back then it was like 120.00 per person for the day. cant imagine the cost these days with fuel.
6729905,prov1800,2023-04-05 15:01:00,5010,Got my basement cleaned up and my work bench.Did plow my 2 driveway an some around my wood stove.Theres lots on the ground and will have to probably do it again tomorrow.But your right.Being inside drives me nuts.But weekend looking good and from there on going to get things sloppy
6729913,prov1800,2023-04-05 15:15:00,5010,250 pp now
6729927,Walleye2242,2023-04-05 16:05:00,263,Wow...but i get it. things ain't cheap these days an folks need to make money as well.
6729943,prov1800,2023-04-05 16:28:00,5010,".I used to make 100 bucks a day for guiding back then,now I get 275 in a camp boat."
6729963,Eckohlt,2023-04-05 17:26:00,3685,We gotta suffer sitting a week in those 14 or 16ft outpost boats!poor us!!!!
