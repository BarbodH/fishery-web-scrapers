You mentioned in your post that the Individual Tax # form and the UHT-2900 forms are attached but I could not locate them. Could you please send the attached forms to me in a personal message or I can provide you my email. Thanks!"

6726387,AsianAngler,2023-03-24 11:16:00,67,"Hello All, For those of you who are US-based, but own property in Canada, you may find this information useful. Kudos to Northwoods Realty Ltd. for sending out this information to customers. The Underused Housing Tax Act levies a 1% annual tax on foreign owners of residential property in Canada that has remained vacant for more than half of the year. While the definition of residential is broad, all rural properties, including those in Sioux Narrows, Nestor Falls and Morson, are excluded from the requirement of having to pay this tax, provided you have stayed at the property for at least 28 days during the previous year. There are further exemptions for properties that are not suitable for year-round use as a place of residence, and properties that are only seasonally accessible. Disappointingly, the federal government still requires that non-residents file a return, confirming that they are exempt from paying this tax. The minimum penalty for failing to file a return is $5,000.00 per occurrence. This penalty applies even to those who are exempt from paying the tax. All non-resident owners, who owned property during the 2022 fiscal year, will be required to file a tax return by April 30, 2023, even if the ownership qualifies for an exemption. They will be required to file a return each following year confirming their exemption from the tax. To do so, they will be required to first request an Individual Tax Number from the Canada Revenue Agency (attached) and then complete the UHT-2900 form (also attached) It is recommend that you complete and submit the UHT-2900 in advance of the April 30 deadline to avoid any potential penalties."
6726809,v-bay gord,2023-03-26 10:55:00,3168,Seems like their should have been a few comments about this as I believe there are several posters on WC who own cottage properties in Canada........
6726813,walleyecheek,2023-03-26 11:48:00,2231,1/1/22 ? Thats over a year ago ! If folks don't know about it by now they probably never will......LOL.
6726829,v-bay gord,2023-03-26 14:10:00,3168,Maybe......but the deadline to file is next month.
6726841,walleyecheek,2023-03-26 16:13:00,2231,"How do They know if you stayed at the Property for ""28"" days ?......LOL."
6726845,Eckohlt,2023-03-26 16:45:00,3685,"They check the outhouse,that will give them a idea on how many days someone was there."

6726989,AsianAngler,2023-03-27 07:52:00,67,"I guess that was my point in posting. I am not a newbie to owning property in Canada. I subscribe to a local newsletter and keep in touch with my neighbors that are permanent residents, yet I had no idea that this law came into effect. If it had not been for my realtor, I would've still been in the dark. Surely, the government knows the non-residents' contact information and if not, they could've done a better job of communicating this. I assume that they would have no trouble finding me if I did not file, so that they could penalize me."
6726995,N_of_Quibell,2023-03-27 08:09:00,151,"Thanks for the info - this info is new to me, and I try to keep current. I've owned bare acreage in Ont for about 20 years, but the cottage has never materialized. This new law seems to be aimed specifically at dwellings, so I hope I'm in the clear and can ignore it. What, me worry?"
6727093,stjoeguy,2023-03-27 12:04:00,979,Thanks for the chuckle.
