It was good running on the snowmobiles until we got to the trout lake, it was slush, we stood in water all day. When we headed back the 15 miles of lake riding that was good in the morning had turned to all slush and water, it was a wet ride home. That was the last snowmobile ride of the season. We still have 2 1/2' of good ice on my home lake, but the next time I go fishing it will be in a side X side or 4-wheeler."
