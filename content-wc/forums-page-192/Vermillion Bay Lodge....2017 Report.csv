5573249,pjshorthorn,2017-05-27 07:47:00,5654,Whew. I was thinking that I may have to posts two reports for both alter egos which would take approximately two years to get done. LOL.You may read another post I sent about camp boats. I mentioned that we will have GPS on the camp boat this year so I should be able to send you some coordinates on super secret squirrel spots where we find fish. That is if you are using your own boat and have GPS or a handheld GPS. It may be a little more accurate than my pencil marks on the maps...Ha !!!PjShorthorn
