We will mostly be trolling. We really like to use crawler harness's , but we do also like leeches.Just curious.And if I did get minnows, are they pretty easy to keep for a week? Thanks!"
5600433,Obabikon,2017-06-10 06:15:00,2370,If you're dead set on trolling... crawlers will be fine. SLOW vertical jigging with a minnow is hard to beat though.
5600449,Obabikon,2017-06-10 06:16:00,2370,"As far as keeping minnows for a week... it depends. Are you camping? Throwing a couple rocks in a minnow bucket, and getting them a couple feet bellow the surface will allow them to last all week without a problem. The key is to keep them out of the hot sun and in fresh water."
5600457,The tank,2017-06-10 06:25:00,340,"When pulling spinners we use mostly worms and some leeches. I would make sure you have pink, white, or gold blades these colors seem to work the best on LOW. We used minnows and worms opening week didn't seem to make much difference. I have a Engel minnow cooler so I have no problem keeping them alive. I also use it for leeches. Have a great trip."
5600489,Steeks7882,2017-06-10 06:31:00,9,"We will be at a cabin, so I will still use the rock trick if we do get some minnows!Thanks for the great tip."
5600585,Baseline,2017-06-10 07:43:00,3207,"I like to fish Miles Bay and into Sabaskong Bay when I fish the Morson area. The east side of Horseshoe Island and the drop offs around Garden Island are good spots to start. Fish should start arriving on the reefs so check them out. Don't discount the value of a jig and minnow drifted very slow almost vertically in a likely spot for walleyes. I've plucked lots more walleyes out of LOW with a jig an minnow or 1/2 crawler than a spinner, but then I fish with a jig 90% of the time. Minnows will last a long time if you don't crowd them and keep them cool. I have a 5 gallon bucket that I drilled lots of holes in. I put a rock in the bottom, snap on the lid and sink it in 3 FOW tied off the dock. It will keep 20-25 dozen minnows for a long time. There should be some very good crappie fishing in the Morson area this time of year."

We pulled harnesses the entire time except for about 10 minutes of jigging. Hammered brass and chartreuse and orange spinners worked good and speed was key. As far as bait we used crawlers, minnows, chubs and plastics caught fish on all. Between 2 boats we caught several hundred fish And caught many fish around 24 a few 25's and a couple 27's. Not sure what it was but I've never seen so many boats on this part of the lake before it seemed like there was a boat on every island and every reef."
5603369,Guest,2017-06-11 21:03:00,0,"We just concluded a week near Morson. Our report - much like others. Walleye fishing was very, very good. Most success was 18-22 jigging with a minnow, lots of big fish last week. Lots of 20""+ with my wife taking the prize with a fat 28"" female. So fun to see them swim away after some pictures. Actually had to move from one reef that just kept putting out 20"" fish and we needed one more 16"" eater to take home. Wish I could say it was skill, but I'll take the luck when I can get it. One bit of advice I do have is spots change daily. We had some spots that produced 20 fish an hour one day, and go stone cold the next. Suppose that's natural with water temps rising as fast as they did last week. Mixed in some Perch and Crappie, but usually just 3-4 a day. Agree lots of boats on the lake. Falcon & Mcpherson are fairly close to the NW Angle so probably getting boats from resorts over there. Fished it many times as well - great area but will see some traffic that you won't see closer to Morson. Pretty busy (comparatively speaking) all over. Great to see the resorts filling up. Anyhow - good luck!"
