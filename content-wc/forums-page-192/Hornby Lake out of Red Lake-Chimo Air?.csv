5586249,Golden Eagle,2017-06-02 14:22:00,2642,Check with the guys at Chimo. Outfitters in Red Lake area won't have a camp on a lake that does not have great fishing.
5587105,DavKin,2017-06-03 06:57:00,104,"Hello TMF89, I can help you out. We will be at Hornby the week of Aug. 28. I'll send a pm with my contact info. Dave"
5590985,LoDo,2017-06-05 11:26:00,721,"We use Chimo air annually for our outfitter. Very nice people that'll accommodate most travel situations. Birgit (female) runs the show up there. If you request she'll handle all your produce needs from the grocery across the street. You may buy your fishing license next door to Chimo at the bait and marine. The dock boys are friendly, help with all luggage to and from docks. Enjoy!!"
