5600593,LoDo,2017-06-10 07:43:00,721,"502 from Int Falls to Dryden is fine. There are a few spots where gravel crosses the road but nothing serious. Slow down, take caution. Easy!! If there are any complaints at all its along the shoulder but all vehicles w/ or w/o boats should be fine. Wild life was abundant last night. Several moose, black bear and even a turtle. ha! Drive safe!"
5600633,law57,2017-06-10 08:13:00,1147,"Winters and log trucks. Weight limits on log trucks are much higher in Canada than in the US. 7 axles seems to be the norm. That's a lot of weight roaring up/down the hills of 502. I remember going to Dryden, yearly, before 502 was opened. I never complain about it now - no matter how slow you go it's still much faster than going west out of FF and north thru Nester Falls."
5601049,packpro,2017-06-10 12:48:00,695,"Just drove 502 from Dryden to International Falls yesterday 6/9. Travel time around 10 AM. There are two areas under construction with traffic stoppages. First is approx. 50 miles south of 17. Rebuilding the road edges. One lane traffic with a flag person. The other is 10 miles further down the road. Replacing a culvert under the road. They had 3/4 of the road removed down to the bog. Had to drive on shoulder (?) and what little road was left. That also was an area with a flag person controlling one way traffic. You will lose time waiting to be waved through, and you will lose time as traffic congests 10-20 vehicles long. You will only be able to go as fast as the slowest car in the group with few passing opportunities. There is orange paint on the road in many other areas where the road edges will need to be rebuilt. They are also replacing wood and cable guard rails along the entire stretch. We had no delays going up, but we hit that stretch around 6:30PM last Friday 6/2 . No work being done at that time. Time difference was about 35 minutes. Hope this helps and hope others update as it looks like their is more 502 work to do though the summer."
5581369,wmd,2017-05-31 12:16:00,388,We are driving up to Sioux Lookout on June 9 and taking 502. It seems I read a post a few weeks back about some construction on the road. For those that have driven it this spring is there construction going on the highway? Thanks wed
5581497,Stringbean,2017-05-31 13:06:00,279,Ontario 511 says that there is a bridge replacement going on on Hwy 72 at the southwest corner of Abrams Lake on the way to Sioux Lookout. There is also work on Hwy 11 around the Noden Causeway just east of Ft. Francis.
5581617,rosh1,2017-05-31 13:50:00,275,Last week they had about 20 miles marked out but had not started. Bet buy 6/9 they will have. Going back this weekend hope they still haven't started.
5581625,bigwalleye1,2017-05-31 14:04:00,2632,"They've been working on the Noden Causeway as long as I've been going to Canada. While the construction season is painfully short, I swear that bridge is some folks' life's work, or they intend for it to be..."

5582105,BornToFish,2017-05-31 19:35:00,1224,"Greetings,I drove Highway 502 from Dryden to Fort Frances yesterday. There were two places on the highway where crews were adding or repairing guard rails (wooden posts and wires). There were flaggers on site that were restricting traffic to a single lane. The delays were quite minimal. It appeared to me that the projects were well-underway.There were a fair number of pot-holes in the south-bound lane of traffic. I suspect that there are about as many pot-holes in the north bound lane. I wouldn't be surprised if there is an up-coming project to fill these pot-holes or resurface sections of the road.There were also road-repair projects on Hwy. 17 between Dryden and Vermillion Bay. They appeared to be installing culvert pipes. Again, the delays were minimal. By the way, heed the signs signaling ""rough road"" as they aren't kidding!Kindest regards...."
5587681,Guest,2017-06-03 16:56:00,0,Any updates??
5589953,Aspencreek,2017-06-04 21:09:00,2911,"See previous post, it's only been 4 days, and probably don't work weekends.Besides, it is what it is, going to go by a different route? Those roads are always having work done, they get a fair amount of traffic all year and they need to be maintained, just deal with it."
5590097,fishmanric,2017-06-05 05:17:00,219,Winters are rough on those northern roads. The terrain doesn't help much either.
5597065,mms3rd,2017-06-08 07:58:00,148,Who built all the cairns along the highway?
