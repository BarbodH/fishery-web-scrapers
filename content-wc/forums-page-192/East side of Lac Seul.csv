5596857,Dakota Floyd,2017-06-08 06:50:00,62,"Had a really great trip to Lac Seul. When the wind was blowing we caught fish, a lot of fish. When the wind died down it was a tough bite. Still ended up with over 250 fish for three days. Not to bad. Used jigs with minnows and leeches and fished 3' to 9' of water. Fish were where the wind was blowing into the shore."
