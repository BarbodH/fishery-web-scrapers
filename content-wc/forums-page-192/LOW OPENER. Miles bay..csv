5590465,mt hook,2017-06-05 08:33:00,65,"I don't care if a boat come's in to the spot im on, (when jigging). But BUZZING is altogether a different thing.H--- stop 50yrd. out and watch its ok with me just don't zoom in and out.I don't care if someone comes in and fishes on the same spot, just so we are NOT playing bumper boats.I have met some great fellow fisherman/women all having a great time. And guess what, No one was RUDESee you in Sept."
5590521,1shooter,2017-06-05 08:47:00,1493,Yea. Similar experience with them last year. Was fishing a point close to shore and they came through at full speed between my boat and shore. Made no sense with such a large body of water.
5580865,The tank,2017-05-31 08:36:00,340,"First time I've fish this early in Canada. The weather was cold and misting rain Saturday-Tuesday with temp in the high 40s-low 50s and sun off and on Wednesday-Saturday with temp in the 50s-60s. We boated over 700 walleyes for the week. Really good taking in the fact I was sick all week. Didn't get out fishing before 9:00 any day. Smallmouth and walleyes were deep first part of the week. 20-25ft. Last part of the week 12-18ft. Biggest walleyes were 26"" 25.5"" 24"" 23"" several 20""-22"" biggest smallmouth 19.5"" 19"" a handfull in the 18"" and several over 16.5"" not many snot rockets a few smaller ones. A few 12-13"" crappies but didn't fish for them. All and all a fun week of fishing. Looking forward to go back up in August."
5582209,The tank,2017-05-31 20:21:00,340,I should add that's 2 boats 4 guys for the week. Again for the second year in a row a Shady Roost guide boat come fished with in 10 yards of one of our boats. Kinda weird them coming that far to fish and park right next to you.
5582241,Obabikon,2017-05-31 20:33:00,2370,Be careful... some of them will buzz right by you if they're not going to pull up on you.
5583209,Stizostedan,2017-06-01 08:32:00,9,"I was up there similar time frame. Similar results. Lots of fish, with more nice smallies mixed in than usual. jig and minnow couldn't be beat."
5584313,The tank,2017-06-01 18:02:00,340,I seen your rig at the dock. That's a very nice boat. You left mid week I was hoping nothing bad happened to anyone or anything. None of my business but just hoping for the good. Have a great fishing year.
5587233,bob888,2017-06-03 08:12:00,244,Curious? What was the water temperature the first part of the fishing and also the last part. Thanks!
5587361,The tank,2017-06-03 09:58:00,340,The first part of the week was cloudy and wet so 50 and the last 3 days was sunny. Miles bay on Friday I found 57 and where I fish I found 60-61. Friday was my boats best day for walleye and smallmouth. If the wind wasn't so strong it would have been even better.
5588409,fishanytime,2017-06-04 06:55:00,63,I have had the same experience with a Shady roost boat.
5589281,mt hook,2017-06-04 16:51:00,65,"I don't no what it is about Sloppy roost guides, but most have NO common courtesy.It seems every year they worse! You would think the camp owners would take a dim view on that sortof thing. I know I would NOT hire a guide from there."
5589881,1/4 oz Jig,2017-06-04 20:41:00,90,Maybe the owners of shady roost aren't aware that they're guides do this. You guys could send an email or post on there Facebook page. I'm sure that will get they're attention. Nothing bothers me more on a trip to canada then having a guide from another lodge pull up on me and fish right on top of me. If your a guide i'm sure you know other spots and if you really wanted to fish the spot you could come back.
