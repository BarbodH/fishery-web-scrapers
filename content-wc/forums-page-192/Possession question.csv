5574361,v-bay gord,2017-05-28 06:53:00,3168,"The better question might be ""Why do it?"". If you know it might lead to confusion then why bother for an extra inch and a half of walleye? As far as who is right, I think that the CO would be right to charge you unless you had proof for your story."
5574377,pjshorthorn,2017-05-28 07:00:00,5654,"I don't see it being any different if one were pulled over on 105 at a fish check station while heading home. How would a CO know that you caught a 19.1"" fish on Wabaskang vs. Lac Seul. They would probably start digging into where you stayed, etc. and if the only thing you could produce is a receipt for a lodge on Lac Seul, I think you would get the citation. If one produced a receipt for a lodge on Wabaskang, probably a different story. This is very similar to an experience I had on the Gulf of Mexico where possession of certain species varies dependent on whether a person is fishing in state waters vs. federal waters. State waters are defined as any navigable waters from shore out to 9 nm and once you cross into state waters the possession limits can change. Our trips tended to be quite a long ride and we would have a lot of "" what if"" conversations on many different topics while riding back to shore. One particular trip the conversation was about what would happen if we had redfish on board that were caught in federal waters and then crossed in to state waters where the redfish season was closed. Would we get a ticket for having redfish in our possession while in state waters. There were a lot of opinions amongst our group of four on which way the encounter would go if we were stopped. As we got close to San Luis Pass to head to my buddy's house, we noticed a CO checking boats that were fishing in the pass. Once the CO was available, we decided to approach his boat and ask them what would happen in this scenario. The conversation started off with the normal pleasantries ....How is your day going? How was fishing? Etc. When we presented the scenario to the officers, the senior CO said "" Heck, I can't keep up with the reg changes in state waters let alone federal waters."" He didn't even attempt to offer a theory on how it would play out. We said our goodbyes and kinda scratched our heads on the way to the house. My gut tells me we would have gotten a ticket if we had redfish on board in states waters when the season was closed. PjShorthorn"
5574473,Shortline,2017-05-28 07:31:00,234,"And right there is my issue with it..... Guilty unless proven innocent. We got into a similar situation south of Sioux Narrows, between there and Crow Lake. We stayed in Sioux Narrows due to no vacancies on Crow or in Nestor, and fished solely on Crow Lake. We kept our legal limit of trout (2 per man). On our trip home, we got checked at a roadside fish check and had some trout that were too big for LotW(lotw had a 1-over limit). We also had ciscos(no bait on whitefish bay). Having stayed in Sioux Narrows and fishing elsewhere, we were suspects as soon as we met a warden...... Long story short, we were detained for well over an hour for separation/questioning. It ended with a warden telling me ""I know you are lying to me"". I replied ""I know I am not"". We did NOT receive a ticket, but we did receive a healthy *** chewing and lecture - both of which were unwarranted. One of the guys was on his first trip to Canada with us, and up to then, it was a great experience. He proclaimed that he would never be back. That was in the early 90's and he was right..... The whole ""why bother ?"" mentality makes no sense to me. If I am following laws, why should the warden be able to further restrict my activities? Guilty until proven innocent is a major difference between the two countries. But on the other hand, I still cross the border to fish about 20 times per yr, so I must not be too big of a deal to me though....lol."
5574497,Obabikon,2017-05-28 07:55:00,2370,"Receiving a ticket does not mean you're guilty. However, with most conservation officers around the world... the burden of proof is on the angler. I'm not saying it is right or wrong... but the truth is they write you a ticket. That does not mean guilt or innocence... if you want, you can contest it in the court. That is where guilt or innocence is determined. Paying a fine doesn't even mean you're always guilty. You might just decide that the ticket wasn't worth the time it takes to defend yourself. As far as it goes... I would pack them in the freezer in the cabin, and have them clearly marked ""caught on June 3rd, 2017 in Crow Lake"". The more documentation the better."
5574529,Bill Krejca,2017-05-28 08:08:00,6107,"I think that maybe we can have here what I call an ""eyewink situation"". Perhaps similar to how the length limit on fillets are figured (They can't be. Really.). To be completely on the ridiculously safe side, in every scenario, one would be wise to look up the ""least"" limit for all waters in the province (or state), and then have in possession the absolute minimum size/quantity. On the other hand, what can one do - hand in cookie jar, looks like taking cookies.... Perhaps the best *solution is not to piz off the official doing his job inspecting your fish, it's his call, you know. Still a very interesting point of law type of situation, a situation with perhaps no clear cut answer. Perhaps another law which states it is unlawful to fish different bodies of water not having the same size/quantity rules - but for what length of time? Ridiculous. What would you do as a warden, given these type of rules to enforce? See * above. Bill"
5574561,Shortline,2017-05-28 08:20:00,234,"Obabikon - as a non citizen, receiving a ticket means guilty. Period. The court will side with the officer against a foreigner 100% of time. It is just the way the world goes round - and that's ok. Like I said, it isn't a big enough deal to slow me down. I happily make 20-25 trips per yr to cross the border to fish, and am ticket free so far(and I plan on keeping it that way!)."
5574665,elway12,2017-05-28 09:47:00,335,"Very interesting thread & comments. I have a HUGE problem with idea that a person would just have to you receive a ticket/fine/punishment because they did something they could not prove. If you obey the law(s) you SHOULD NOT ever get a ticket/fine. I know life is not fair but in this case it needs to be! Shortline has some good points. I would have liked to hear the whole story of what the CO's were telling you as they were scolding you? I would also like to know if there are specific laws about fishing more than one body of water or laws about having only one limit of fish from only one body of water per day etc.?? In regards to the original issue. I would do my best to have as much evidence that I fished the two different bodies of water. Hopefully IF it came to being checked, they would investigate and find you were following the law(s)."
5574809,Shortline,2017-05-28 13:05:00,234,"Elway - here are a few facts about our encounter..... We stayed in Souix narrows at the motel which is not on the water We never fished LoTW that trip. We trailered about 1/2 hour to fish crow lake, as we had friends staying there we wanted to fish with. We followed all applicable laws. The wardens at the fish checkpoint questioned us as to staying at Sioux Narrows but fishing Crow.... Crow lake allowed bait and 2 trout. Up at Sioux narrows, no bait was allowed and only one trout above 25-1/2"" if I recall correctly. The wardens (one in particular) were skeptical that we caught our fish away from where we stayed. It was about a 90 minute delay as the angry warden kept us separated and interrogated us. He called me a liar. Having broken no laws(the other wardens at the checkpoint were cordial and perfectly ok with our answers), I didn't feel like our treatment and detention was justified. Maybe he was having a horrid day, maybe he was just a jerk as a person, I don't know. I still go back."
5575049,Obabikon,2017-05-28 16:32:00,2370,"Like I mentioned before a peace officer of any type is meant to take the logical action. If it is more complicated the courts can figure out guilt or innocence. That isn't the job of the officer. If they didn't write the ticket, how many anglers would lie to them? If you want to push the legal envelope, then be ready to defend your actions in court (or pay a fine). Appearance is a big deal. Just because you are obeying the law, doesn't mean it appears that you are obeying the law. Courts will figure that out."
5575377,Shortline,2017-05-28 20:31:00,234,"In the past 30 yrs of fishing up there, I have been witness to two occasions of non-residents(people in my party) receiving citations from wardens. Both were obvious to me that the wardens were trying to make the correct call, but were mistaken. On both occasions, my acquaintances travelled to Kenora for their day in court. On both occasions, it was a rubber stamped ""guilty"" verdict. There was no ""reasonable doubt"" (and I realize that Canada does not have our court system), just a quick verdict of guilty. Period. I truly believe that not being citizens was a major component of the outcome. One of my pals reported after his ""case"" that the worship(judge) asked him directly ""do you expect me to believe your word over my officers?"".....and that was that. Whether my pals report is accurate or not, I can not prove, but I believe him. So yes, I DO believe that a non-res stands about a zero% chance of winning. And please note that there were only 2 times in over 30 yrs that there has been questionable outcomes. It is hardly the norm."
5575585,Obabikon,2017-05-29 04:50:00,2370,"0-2 is a long way from rubber stamped. It also does not mean that it was because they weren't Canadians. You can have your opinion, and I admit that the court doesn't always get it right. However, it isn't always wrong either... the best way to ensure you stay out of trouble is document it. If you show up and it is just your word vs. the officer... I can see why the angler would lose. However, if you can prove that you made a trip to a certain area and caught those fish, the ticket would be dismissed."
5575625,Shellback,2017-05-29 05:15:00,8083,"I pretty much tend to agree a non resident is going to get the short end of the stick. But it isn't a US/ Canada thing only. Here in the states, a non resident from another state isn't going to fair very well either. Fishing regs are crazy, one side of a road may have one limit, and the other side a different limit. Unless a warden actually see's you take an illegal limit, how can they ticket you for what you have in possession back at your cabin. I also agree that given the chance, many anglers would try and beat the system by saying the caught their fish in a body of water it was legal too. It's a big grey area, and I believe the fisherman is going to get the short end of the stick. I fish the St Lawrence, no size limit in zone 20 in my area. A few miles west there is a specific size limit. Off the river and on the back lakes it's zone 18, another set of different limits there. Tough to honestly enforce the law unless a warden visually see's the actual catch. As I said, it's not a US/Canada thing, same stuff happens between states in the US."
5576033,dom14,2017-05-29 08:12:00,17,"I'm still waiting to hear back from the DNR. I read and appreciate everyone's feedback. I'm thinking there is no way to prove where I caught the perch unless I have a witness. Even then, CO may doubt me. I think the GPS idea along with pictures may be enough to ""prove"" I at least fished a 50 perch limit lake. I'll let you know when/if I hear back. I still have a few weeks before my trip."
5576081,martinbns,2017-05-29 08:16:00,1520,"The other way to go would be to just keep 15 perch or eat them each day. 50 is a big number, particularly if there are several of you in your party."
5576257,dom14,2017-05-29 09:24:00,17,The family loves perch so I would like to bring a couple meals home for them. I still don't get the 15 perch limit. Certain locals are allowed to fish them with nets in my area of LOTW.
5577073,martinbns,2017-05-29 18:54:00,1520,Aboriginal rights whether we agree or not are the law of the land.
5594009,dom14,2017-06-06 12:46:00,17,"Finally heard back from MNR,""You can possess 50 yellow perch from another waterbody. You do need to keep the fish labelled so that a conservation officer can identify the species and quantity of fish when you are transporting them. Note: No person who is engaged in recreational fishing from a vessel shall possess more fish on board the vessel than the daily limit for that species. Therefore, if you catch perch in quantities of over 15 from another lake, then you cannot fish in LOW from that vessel until you have taken your perch back to camp."""
5594593,Bill Krejca,2017-06-06 17:58:00,6107,"Makes sense, as far as it goes. Now the fish are cleaned in the freezer at camp. Is the label stating from ""x"" lake still OK? How about if all guests do a label, maybe while out in the boat, etc? I think I'd really have to want the several extra fish very bad to try to work this out all the way from the honey hole lake to the freezer, to the border, etc. Interesting question, tho, eh? Bill"
5574945,v-bay gord,2017-05-28 15:19:00,3168,"The ""why bother"" mentality was directed at the particular scenario you laid out.....staying on a lake with a walleye slot limit and travelling elsewhere to harvest a walleye illegal where you are staying. It is not the same situation you describe in your trout scenario. Degrees of interpretation I'm sure, but if it wasn't a potential issue you would have many dishonest anglers getting away with breaking fish and game laws...........Here on Eagle Lake I have guests fishing a portage lake where the daily possession is 2, but it is only 1 on Eagle.........which means on the ride home they may have one more trout than the possession limit on Eagle Lake. This has not been an issue because the trout on the portage lake are almost always in a smaller size range.......cookie cutter size. On the other hand I tell guests that the Eagle Lake slot size applies to the portage lakes (it doesn't) simply to avoid issues........plus the slot is a conservation bonus, so why not extend it to other waters if I can?"
5575017,Obabikon,2017-05-28 16:25:00,2370,"I completely disagree with this comment. The courts are there to ensure that those being punished are actually guilty. A ticket doesn't prove anything. If you have a logical explanation for having the fish, and the officer has no proof of wrong doing... a court will indeed throw out the case. However... you have to actually show up, be respectful, and state your case in a clear manner without being a jerk... that's the hard part for many people. Judges want to be respected in court, and they should be."
5573561,dom14,2017-05-27 10:34:00,17,"I'll be going to LOTW for the 6th year in row. A few years ago the LOTW perch limit went from 50 to 15. I have no idea why because we catch them by the 100s. I was thinking about going to a neighbor lake where the limit is 50 and catching my 50 perch to bring back home. The problem I might run into is I'll be staying in a cabin on LOTW. Do I need some proof where I caught them? I sent an email to Canada DNR a few days ago asking the same question, but haven't heard back yet. Just curious in someone here has done this. Thanks."

5574049,Bill Krejca,2017-05-27 21:49:00,6107,"An interesting situation. There are multiple different limits, size restrictions, etc on the many lakes and streams. This should be a common problem (?)/dilemma with anyone fishing in unlike limit waters. I wonder how folks/wardens handle this? The GPS angle might be useful, if practicable, but everyone should not have to have a GPS to avoid being pinched. Should be some fascinating stories out there. What say you? Bill"
5574153,Multispecies Guy,2017-05-28 05:27:00,447,Need more info. PM those GPS coordinates for your good perch spots on LOTW to me and I'll evaluate your dilemma further.
5574193,Slushfish,2017-05-28 05:43:00,263,"We fish alot of Michigan/ Ontario boundary waters where Mi. walleye limit is 5 and Ont. limit is 4. The only time it is an issue is, at any given time, your possession limit cannot exede that of which the water you are on. IE...if I'm on the Mi. side I can have 5 fish but if I get caught crossing into Ont. water I better only have 4. Once at home, nothing can be said. I can't imagine them giving you a hassle after you explain. Just don't get caught on LOTW over your limit. Shoot straight, be honest, no hassle."
5574201,Multispecies Guy,2017-05-28 05:53:00,447,That's sound advice. He wants to fish a nearby lake with a higher limit and then return to his camp on LOTW. Reaching his camp requires a boat crossing of LOTW waters. I would not have more than the LOTW limit onboard while on LOTW personally. I highly doubt a warden will accept date/time stamps on GPS coordinates or digital photos as proof you didn't catch more than your limit on LOTW if you have more than 15 in your possession.
5574225,Bstar,2017-05-28 05:58:00,564,"Here's a scenario: I am staying at a camp on the west end of Lac Seul and decide to to go across 105 and fish Wabaskang for a day. I have a conservation license and keep two walleye for dinner. One is 17"" and the other one is 19 1/2"" long. I go back to camp and relaunch my boat on Lac Seul and I'm in the middle of cleaning the fish in the fish cleaning house with a handful of other guys doing the same. In walks a CO to check limits/sizes. He comes over to me and measures the 19 1/2 "" fish and says that it's illegal to keep any walleye between 18.1' and 20.9 on Lac Seul and that he is going to have to give me a citation with a hefty fine and whatever else goes along with it. I explain that I went and fished Wabaskang for the day and that it's legal to keep one walleye over 18.1"" on that lake. He doesn't buy it and gives me the citation anyway. Who's right? I know I legally harvested that fish but the CO has to go by what he sees. I'm guessing that I'm paying a hefty fine."
5574273,Shellback,2017-05-28 06:30:00,8083,"I'm betting the CO is going to go by the limit of the water you are on, or the zone of the cabin you are staying in."
