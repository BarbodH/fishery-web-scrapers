5590761,Obabikon,2017-06-05 10:09:00,2370,You can legally bring crawlers with you across as long as they are in paper meche bedding. Best bet is to get leeches in Morson. I'm not sure who all carries them.
5590777,The tank,2017-06-05 10:26:00,340,You can get worms from Steve lucky bait 24 hours a day packed in bedding ready to cross the border. He right on hwy11 on the east side of baudette. We have not found worms after you cross the border from rainy to morson. Leeches I've got from Buna vista before.
