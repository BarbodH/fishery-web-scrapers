5596089,Jesse-WI,2017-06-07 14:56:00,534,You happen to know the serving hours for either of these places?
5596137,Ricky Spanish,2017-06-07 15:37:00,1298,"At Temple Bay, dinner is sort of staggered, so the whole camp isn't trying to eat at the same time. 4:45, 5, and 5:15 is typical. I was talking to a guy at the bar one night last June, and I recalled seeing him eating dinner alone. I was surprised to find out he lived in the area when I asked where he was from. I suggest calling the lodge 807-755-2172."
