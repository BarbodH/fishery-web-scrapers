5592433,Guest,2017-06-05 19:41:00,0,I see on the Control Board website that the water level is a little down and they continue to lower how much water they are letting out. What's it really looking like? How much is it down compared to last year? Is it super dry job there around Kenora area? 10 days to go!!!

They are trying to bring the level up slowly, or at least prevent it from going down. We could use some rain though."
