5592993,BornToFish,2017-06-06 05:31:00,1224,"Greetings,I returned from NW Ontario with considerably fewer books than I hoped for. Needless to say, I wasn't too happy about this. I sold all of these books, and now have no books remaining in inventory. I know that I am disappointing some anglers. I apologize for this.I do not anticipate having any more copies of my book printed, as the cost is substantial and the market limited in scope.I extend my sincerest thanks to those that purchased a copy of my book and especially to those that offered testimonials on this thread.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5594745,team walleye,2017-06-06 19:11:00,336,Can't say enough about this book. I'm planning on reading it again in a few weeks during my drive up while someone else is driving!
5594865,BornToFish,2017-06-06 20:11:00,1224,"Hey Team Walleye, I thank you again for the kind words. I hope that you and your group have a wonderful time on beautiful Perrault Lake. Go out there and make some fantastic memories!! Please submit a trip report when you return home.Safe travels and good fishing!!"
5595025,David Anderson,2017-06-06 21:56:00,2073,"Just curious, ever thought about selling an inline version?"
5599121,BornToFish,2017-06-09 10:32:00,1224,"Greetings,David, you raised an interesting question about publishing an on-line version of my book.I sold my entire inventory of softcover books. I do not foresee having any additional copies of my book printed due to cost of printing and shipping. The up-front costs are surprisingly high. The ""profit"" in selling my books is entirely on the back end of the proposition and is certainly not guaranteed. I wonder each time I have books printed whether I will even recover my costs.I'm wondering if there might be sufficient interest in an on-line version of my book to justify looking into electronic formats and see what it would take to make it happen. This could make for an interesting winter-time project.What say you? Is there interest in an electronic version about a book pertaining to fishing on the Canada Shield? Obviously, I am not looking for any sort of commitment, but rather simply conducting an informal survey.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5599193,ssscott1,2017-06-09 11:16:00,4,"born to fish i would be interested in obtaining a copy any way you could, be it online, faxed or printed. sounds like a good read scott"
5599385,jkwildhunting,2017-06-09 12:55:00,361,I be game for any way to get hands on copy! Online or book!
5599577,Ricky Spanish,2017-06-09 15:09:00,1298,I would definitely read it. I typically read three or four e-books per month.
5600065,Camoclad,2017-06-09 20:03:00,628,Sign me up...
5600225,bulldogger,2017-06-09 22:46:00,2,I'd be interested in a copy of any form.
5372554,Rich B,2017-03-03 19:36:00,1081,"Just rec'd my copy of this book this week and am enjoying reading it. I fish Cedar for the Spring Opener, and it is interesting reading Mark's take on the Perrault and Cedar fisheries (included in the book is a lot of good common sense boating information. as well as detailed fishing information for any of the waters in NW Ontario). Nice lake photos as well as marked map for Perrault - very professionally written with a personal touch. Rich B"

5377482,dukkiler,2017-03-06 09:31:00,3,I also received mine over the weekend. This is a great reading book with a lot of helpful info.
5377946,Hwy 101,2017-03-06 12:10:00,33,"This book does a great job explaining the seasonal fish movements on a typical Canadian lake. It has information that can certainly be used by fishermen with any level of experience. The book kind of connects the dots from all of my Canadian trips. Some trips we caught plenty of fish, others we really struggled and never fully understood why. I let someone borrow my fist copy during deer camp, and when I picked up more copies my son took one for himself the minute I walked in the door."
5379762,BornToFish,2017-03-07 06:08:00,1224,"Greetings,The reason for this post is to offer thanks and to update the followers of this thread as to the status of my book inventory.First of all, thanks to everyone that purchased one of my books. I am confident that each of my books has found a good home. Also, thanks to those that commented on this thread after receiving my book. Kind words are always appreciated!! I made many new friends in person and through Walleye Central because of my book.Thanks to the Walleye Central Administrator for not ""nuking"" this thread. The profit from the sale of these books is miniscule. The reason for writing and self-publishing my book is that it is rewarding to me to help others enjoy the beauty of the Canada Shield in the way my wife and I have. Like I said above, I've made many new friends because of this thread.I have four books remaining in inventory. I will retrieve a small handful of books during May when I visit a fishing lodge on Perrault Lake. I will update this thread when I return home in later May. Kindest regards everyone.Good Fishing and Tight Lines!!"

5384226,BornToFish,2017-03-08 18:35:00,1224,"Greetings,Please be advised that I have one copy of my book available at this time to sell. If you are still interested in my book, PLEASE DO NOT SEND a payment of any type until we first converse via private message (or by email for those that have already received a reply from me by private message).I should be able to obtain about five additional copies of my book when I am in NW Ontario during May. If so, I will update this thread at that time.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5384402,bergsh,2017-03-08 20:44:00,183,Hoping to get your last book if still available.
5386010,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2017-03-09 18:31:00,240,"Received my copy today. Love it! Will probably have read it from cover to cover by the end of the weekend. This is the kind of writing that I really enjoy. Bill Binkelman has always been my favorite fishing author, but Mark's prose ranks right up there.Would be interesting to learn about more ""hidden gems"" like this, regarding fishing in NW Ontario, by other authors.I hope someday you publish a 3rd edition, Mark. Kudos on the great writing!"
5386058,BornToFish,2017-03-09 18:56:00,1224,"Greetings,I do not have any copies of my book to sell at this time. Thus, please do NOT send any payments to me at this time. I have a handful of copies (maybe five or so) at a fishing lodge in Ontario. I plan to bring those books home with me in late May. If so, I will update this thread at that time.Michigan Walleye Guy - many thanks for the kind words. They are much appreciated.Good fishing everyone and Tight Lines!!"
5337825,eyeboom,2017-02-16 12:41:00,940,Interesting. Mine had been opened and stamped with the same notice.
5338225,BornToFish,2017-02-16 16:47:00,1224,"Greetings,I put each book into the addressed mailing envelope and hand it to the clerk at the USPS. The envelope is sealed after the clerk inspects it to make sure that there is only ""media"" in the envelope. Apparently, redundancy is a key to business success.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5338241,eyeboom,2017-02-16 17:14:00,940,I just figured they wanted to know the info also! LOL
5338417,team walleye,2017-02-16 19:07:00,336,Mine was as well
5341441,bigdaddyguns,2017-02-18 14:04:00,608,I agree it is a great book especially for anglers with minimal Canadian Shield lake experience. The book helped me move up the learning curve on these style lakes as the Canadian Shield is very different from the Midwest and great lakes region i had previously fished. The book is written from the perspective of placing the angler in the best position to be successful based on seasonal movement factors and applicable methods for those locations.
5350689,Hwy 101,2017-02-22 21:52:00,33,"Mark, PM sent. Need to pick up two more copies."
5350841,BornToFish,2017-02-23 05:52:00,1224,"Greetings Hwy 101,I sent a reply.Kindest regards...."
5351225,David Anderson,2017-02-23 08:46:00,2073,"Well, Ordered my copy from Mark and received it last week. I have about finished it and all I can say is Wow, what a great read. Although his book is based on his experiences on Perrault Lake, I fish Lac Seul, just east of there and everything is applicable as well, it really helps to confirm some of my own observations. In addition I will be trying some of his ideas this spring when I head up for the opener, and definitely am going to try for muskies this year. With hard water season almost over it is a great time to compare notes and get ready for this years open water season. Thanks Mark!"
5361385,BornToFish,2017-02-27 10:37:00,1224,"Greetings Hwy 101,It was nice meeting you over the weekend. I enjoyed the conversation. I thought ""it's a small world"" when we realized that we will be fishing out of the same lodge this season. I hope that you are able to get an additional week at the lodge for the first week of the fishing season. It would be nice to spend some time in the boat together!Good fishing and tight lines!!p.s. I hope that your daughter passes her upcoming driver's test!"
5366754,stormerlake,2017-03-01 09:42:00,6,"My wife and I used to own a fishing lodge on Perrault Lake and have personally known Born to Fish for many many years. The book he has written about fishing on Perrault Lake is a very thorough and detailed approach for catching most fish species on Perrault Lake and for many Canadian Shield Lakes. We highly recommend this book and know it will improve your ""Catching"" experience in Ontario Canada."
5287018,BornToFish,2017-01-23 10:20:00,1224,"Greetings,I wrote and self-published a book two years ago about fishing on Perrault Lake in NW Ontario. The content of the book is applicable to many lakes within the Canada Shield. The chapter about walleye fishing is a prominent portion of my book.I am closing out my inventory. There is a thread on the Swap Board that pertains to this book.Good fishing and tight lines!!"

5323729,team walleye,2017-02-09 17:19:00,336,Waiting for mine to arrive! Can't wait to read it and out it to use this June!
5334009,Guest,2017-02-14 16:43:00,0,"I have read both the first and second edition of these books. The information contained in these books is perfect for both the seasoned veterans and the first timers of Canadian fishing. If you are planning a trip to Perrault Lake, these books are a must in my opinion. The author has logged endless hours fishing Perrault Lake. I have personally met and visited with the author. This guy is the real deal!"
5336241,team walleye,2017-02-15 18:26:00,336,I received my book in the mail last week and had it all read by the beginning of this week! Very good workbjt a very experienced angler! Must read if you are fishing Lerrault or any area NW Ontario lake!
5337713,1K1MOA,2017-02-16 11:52:00,90,"I got mine this week as well. Interestingly the envelope was stamped ""opened for inspection by USPS"" Hmmmm...hopefully they were making sure it was a book, since you sent media rate, and you don't have another sideline business using the U.S. Mail they are monitoring for. I thumbed through it and it looks like a great read, can't wait to dig in."
