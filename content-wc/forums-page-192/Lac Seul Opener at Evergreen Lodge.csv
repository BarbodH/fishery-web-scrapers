Pat was extremely accommodating as always and I would highly recommend anyone thinking about a trip to Lac Seul to look into Evergreen Lodge. The Fishing- we had 3 great days of fishing and 3 days that were a bit of a grind due to weather. Saturday was good weather and good fishing. We chased Smallmouths right out of the gate and caught about 6. We got some of the excitement out of us and then decided to chase Walleyes. We figured out the eyes were in 10-12 FOW mostly. We caught very few way back in Sawmill, most fish were caught at Radar Island and further out towards the mouth. We hit the Sanctuary that night and padded the stats with some fast action little guys. Sunday and Monday it rained and was 40 degrees, pretty cold and miserable, especially when the eyes had lockjaw. We caught single digits- we did go to some pike spots to cast and warm up but even the hammer handles weren't biting much. Tuesday-Thursday was good weather again but despite the nice weather Tuesday, walleyes still weren't biting great. By Wednesday they finally turned back on and we got after them the last two days of the trip. We each caught 30 walleyes a piece on the last day! Boated well over a hundred fish that day with northern and perch. We did notice the fish seemed scattered this year, we would get a ""flurry"" of about 2 fish and then would have to wait about 10 minutes for the next ""flurry"". Never found the big schools with non stop action. We fished Sawmill, Sanctuary, Bannatyne and Iran Creek. We got searched by MNR- I can't remember the last time I've seen them out on opener at Lac Seul. We also saw the OPP out checking people but we did not get stopped by them. We caught 399 fish total between the 3 of us. Biggest Walleye of the trip was 25"", Biggest Northern 34"", Smallmouth 3lbs, Whitefish 4.13lbs and Burbot 29"" (Yes my Uncle caught the 2nd Burbot I've seen and it was a long one!) How did you guys do? I'm ready to go back"
