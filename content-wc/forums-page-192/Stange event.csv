5590649,camp chef,2017-06-05 09:20:00,915,We got back from Canada this weekend and had a great trip......I will post a more thorough report in the coming days but wanted to mention something that happened to us in case it can help someone else. We dropped our boat in the water for our 30 mile boat in to our outpost on Rainy lake. While my partner parked the truck I attempted to motor to the dock to wait for him. almost immediately I felt a snap and lost all steering. the power steering cable had snapped inside the sleeve it runs through. No prior warning.Never had an issue like this before. Luckily we were right at the dock and proceeded to loaded the trailer again and frantically searched for someone that could fix it and had the proper cable. Long story short...we found some super people to help at Voyageur Marine and had to run to I falls to get the right steering cable and were able to resume our trip in about 5 hours. We were extremely lucky we weren't 20 miles out in rough water in the middle of nowhere when it happened. In retrospect I don't know anyway we would have been able to avoid this cable failure. Any Input?

Their steering cable broke while going wide open about 55 mph and they were both immediately ejected from the boat. They were both wearing PFDs and had the kill switch attached. Neither was badly hurt but it reminded me that anything can happen at any time. I wear mine now too. You're very lucky it happened when it did. I'm sure the water is still in the 50's F there. Glad to hear your story had a good ending. I for one never want to go for an unintentional swim."

5591129,camp chef,2017-06-05 12:07:00,915,not sure if it was in the (middle) but it was in side the sleeve.
