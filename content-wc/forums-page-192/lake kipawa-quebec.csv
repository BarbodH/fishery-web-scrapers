5583633,walleye22,2017-06-01 11:21:00,59,Any thoughts on this lake in quebec for walleye? Cedar valley lodge or any other lodge reccomendations? Is walleye fishing comparable to northern ontario? Thanks.

Unfortunately for me and many others that live too far away, northwestern Ontario is out of the question, and everything i read about kipawa is about our best option in a drive to lake. Check out kipawa fishing forum. http://www.kipawafishingforum.net IT sends to me that most who shoot kipawa down have not given it more than one trip to learn it, and/or have had their trip ruined by weather or other uncontrollable things. Those are not objective opinions. I was supposed to visit kipawa this year for the first time, but everyone else backed out. Next year im going, even if i habe to go alone.

The kipawa fishing forum site is a good resource as previously mentioned. Folks I have spoken to that have fished kipawa have admitted the fishing is not easy, especially compared to NWO standards. It seems many people go once and never come back; those who do come back are usually from NE Ohio, pa, and any. They put the time in to learn the lake and many fall I love with the lake and purchase cabins on it. My recommendation would be to go to a nearby back lake in ZEC kipawa. Sassahenia or Kikawissi and Ogascanan all have outfitting operations you could look into. Further in the bush is Grassy and Watson lakes. There are small outfitted on those lakes offering cabin and boat rental. From what I've heard the accommodations and boats on these lakes are ""basic"". Neither have websites but I believe they are on Facebook and info might be able to be obtained on the kipawa fishing forum site. Lake day Dumoine is also in the area and by all reports is as good if not better than any of the lakes previously mentioned in my post. I've never been to any of these lakes but have talked with guys who fish them. For a first timer to the area I think the best bet would be Dumoine."
5583897,1-shot,2017-06-01 13:23:00,35,"I agree with fsz; Our group visited Lac Dumoine a few years back. At the time, I was considering the same questions you have, did a bit of research of the area and settled in on Lac Dumoine; Wrote up quick review if you want to search for it here on walleye central. I remember talking to a few people at the bait shot on kippawa before we went over into dumoine and came away feeling that their opinion was that Kippawa was a difficult lake to fish for new-comers. I was happy we chose Dumoine instead. I still feel however that the fishing in Northwestern Ontario is much better."
5584265,retire55,2017-06-01 17:11:00,1029,"I did 17 trips to Lake Kipawa. Last trip was in 2013. IMHO, the quality of walleye fishing decreased due to continuous and unrelenting fishing pressure. Sadly, for years, neither the outfitters nor the fish biologists responsible for its management made any efforts to resolve the situation. Finally in 2016, a walleye protective slot limit (all walleye over 20.9 inches had to go back) was implemented. If we're lucky, the walleye fishery will recover and Lake Kipawa will become a destination lake again."

Skip Kipawa... but if you do ignore the chatter PLEASE POST YOUR REPORT..""I have lived it"" @TBL"
5586241,phishfearme,2017-06-02 14:12:00,1242,"lac kipawa is an oligotrophic lake - characteristic: clear, deep, infertile - not real conducive to producing a large walleye population most all the lakes in NW Ontario (and many lakes around kipawa) are mesotrophic - characteristics: stained, many shallow flats, fertile and river fed - this is the best situation for walleye. this is not just applicable to kipawa but to any oligotrophic lake - some in NW Ontario hold good populations of lake trout but don't think that they are walleye heaven. phish"
5594649,Ira,2017-06-06 18:20:00,6,"Our first Canada trip was last year to Lake Ogascanan (near Kipawa) and we we're fairly successful catching walleye & some pike. While we didn't catch numbers of fish that I've read about in other posts, I attribute that to out inexperience. Our hosts, the Mullens, gave us tips and helped us locate fish. Looking forward to our return trip in 3 weeks - hope to do better with the walleye, but I know we'll have a good time regardless."
