533247,Guest,2003-07-06 17:26:00,0,"sorry,trying to get up to Minni in sept.I have fished on the lake for the last 20 years.The fishing has been excellant the last 10 years when they put slots in on the walleyes (19''-21'').If you need info call Lee Edwardson at Pickeral Arm Camp,1-807-737-2499.Was at camp last year caught many 17'' to 25 '' walleyes, but left early my father who came with suffered a heart attack.HE'S fine after surgery in U.S. Lee runs a first class operation I wouldn't stay any were else.Good luck getting into his camp in june or july."
