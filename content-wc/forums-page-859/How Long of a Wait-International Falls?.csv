532882,TomPGrouse,2003-06-25 19:05:00,124,Will be crossing at International Falls on Friday about noon. What can I expect? Thanks
532885,Guest,2003-06-25 20:02:00,0,"Crossed Friday June 13th at about 11:00am and was about the 3rd car in line. Took all of about 5 minutes. Have been crossing this way for the last 5 years or so and have never waited more than 10 minutes, expect for the year we got pulled over and that took about 20 or 25."

532909,Guest,2003-06-26 09:31:00,0,"We crossed on a Friday afternoon at about 3 and the wait was about 5 minutes. The wait coming back to the US on Sat. morning was close to 45 mins. No problems, very friendly, and professional."

533033,Guest,2003-06-30 07:54:00,0,Around noon shouldnt be a big problem. Later in the afternoon and early evening we've waited as long as 2 hours. Road construction around Chicago/Madison WI/Rockford IL added about 3 hours to our trip. Plan accordingly.
533052,Guest,2003-06-30 12:47:00,0,Crossed two weeks ago at 12:30. No wait at all. No wait at 10:30 the following Friday coming to the states.
533126,Guest,2003-07-01 18:05:00,0,"Tom, Went through on June 21, Saturday afternoon at 4 P.M., was the only car, unbelievable! Also heard the camps are hurting. Saw very few boats heading up that Saturday through Minnesota (53)."
533128,Newby,2003-07-01 19:14:00,148,"Just got back Saturday. Crossing into Canada was a breeze,5min. Coming back took a little longer, but not as long as I thought it would take. There were a ton of cars and boats, and the line was way past the bridge. It only took about 15-20min though. The officers were very polite, and got buisness done. Normal questions, nationality, what in canada for, carring any specific items. Have fun in Can-an-na-da."
533138,Guest,2003-07-02 07:33:00,0,"Went thru about 2 weeks ago on Sat. morn., no line. This seemed odd and now I wonder if the economy is taking a toll on vacations north? What really set me to wondering was when we claimed the extra 3 cases of beer for the 3 of us (6 total) to the Cdn. customs agent, he just waved us through. This has NEVER happened before. We always get sent inside to pay duty. You have to wonder if they've been instructed to be more friendly/lenient to encourage cross-border traffic since their SARS/Mad Cow problems."
