532335,Guest,2003-06-14 15:15:00,0,"Jeff, My wife and I will be there the 2nd and 3rd weeks of July. We have been going to the camp 11 years now ... sometimes twice a year. We love that place, the people that run it, the people that work there, and the friends we have made over the years. Look us up. We will be very noticable ... the only people in camp with 2 Black Labs."
532338,Guest,2003-06-14 19:18:00,0,"Actually I pull a boat and I am very careful with my equipment. It takes me about 40 minutes to do the 6.5 miles. Look at www.witchbay.com for this year's fishing report, etc. I recognize most of the people in the pictures because I see them year after year at the camp. Steve and Gail (the camp owners) are 2 of the nicest, most sincere and honest people you will ever meet. They choose their camp staff carefully for being customer service oriented."
532339,Guest,2003-06-14 19:29:00,0,"Jeff, Last year the waters in LOW were up and down like a yo-yo. They were up in June and then up some more in June and them up some more. When I got there in July they had started to recede and kept receding. They never got back to normal during July. I got their in September for a 2nd trip and the water was about normal level. All through this, once the summer pattern started, it held, no matter what was happening with the water level. Fish were on the humps and on the mud flats and my wife and I caught a lot of them. We did some fishing for smallies, too, and found them in the usual places as well. I would not worry too much about the pattern being affected by the water levels. I would bet it won't be."
533147,IAranger,2003-07-02 10:40:00,352,"Thanks Woof : We will be there the 14th thru 18th, no dogs but probably the only Iowa plates Jeff"
533199,Guest,2003-07-03 10:55:00,0,"Hey Jeff, Don't be on being the only IOWA plates. We have 3 pairs of friends from IOWA that we met in camp 10 years ago and usually show up that same week. One pair cannot make it this year, but the other two pairs will probably be there the 2nd or 3rd week. Look us up. Cabin 7A. If you forget the cabin number, you can still find us ... look for the 2 Black Labs who will be out on the porch watching the world go by ... lol."
533282,IAranger,2003-07-07 11:28:00,352,Will do ... Looks like we have Cabin #1 we will be in late Sunday night Jeff
527966,IAranger,2003-03-16 16:24:00,352,Looks like plans are changing now and we may not be up till the next week ....If they still have availabilityJeff
527967,iamwalleye1,2003-03-17 13:54:00,1589,We are staying @ pipe stone point. We will be there the second week of july for just one week. If you want I could give you a ring on our way home saturday and give you a heads up! [email protected]
527968,IAranger,2003-03-20 18:41:00,352,That would be awesomeI will send you my number via your email We actually could not get in till monday.So we will drive up to the border on sundayand get there early monday the 14thThanksJeff
527969,IAranger,2003-04-28 18:47:00,352,Does anyone know how much effect the current low water levels will affect this area for fishing later this summer if they do not get rain ??
527970,Lunker,2003-04-29 09:25:00,27,"the fishing was quite good when the water levels were low early in the season. 'Course, you know what they say about how the fishing was ""yesterday"". However, I will also note that, for some reason, the smallie fishery was just....""off"" last season. That may or may not have been because of the significantly fluctuating water levels. I really wouldn't worry about it. The quality of the fishery is superb anyway and you may just have to spend more time chasing walleyes instead. And, as you know, the pro staff will do everything possible to help put you on the best bite."
527971,Guest,2003-05-09 17:23:00,0,"I know these people personally and for certain I would recommed the place. Although I have never been their, I have never in all my years here in Kenora heard anything derogitory about them, nor their resort/lodge.Fishing I understand is great, boats are modern, and the folks operating the place along with their staff are very accommodating.Ronhttp://www.kenoraontario.net"
527972,Guest,2003-05-11 06:36:00,0,"Witch Bay is a very secluded camp located half way between to Sioux Narrows and Kenora. The only drive in camp in that area. The fishing in Witch Bay alone has produced 50"" muskie, ten pound plus walleye, 40"" northern pike, and six pound smallies. That's without ever leaving the bay. The camp is a combination of both rustic and modern. Lodge is very charming. Liars nest is a big screened in gazebo overlooking the lake. Has TV, pop corn maker and comfortable tables and chairs. Guests love being in there during the evening hours. The camp boats are as good as it gets. Steve and Gail Hockett run a top shelf operation with a well trained friendly staff. The food is excellent and they give you as much as you want, their sandwiches for lunch are the out of sight. They have a fishing program whereas they put you on the best fishing spots in the area, and it's free to you. I think it's a great place, run by great people, on a great fishery."
527973,IAranger,2003-05-19 06:39:00,352,Thanks Phil:Sounds exactly like what I am looking for !Jeff
527974,IAranger,2003-06-06 13:09:00,352,Only 5 more weeks to go...I am really getting the itch now !!
527975,Brian_MN,2003-06-07 13:12:00,738,"Make sure you drop me a line around July 1st, before your trip. I'll be there working the 20-30th of June, and will have a good report for you."
527956,tyeeguy,2003-02-24 08:04:00,111,"I went to Witch Bay two times a couple of years ago. I thoughtit was a great experience. Everything that has been said is true.I would like to add that I thought the pros on staff were extremlyeasy to talk with and available to answer questions. They willget you on fish and make sure you have a good time.The owners were great! Their web site is one of the best on the net,they answer questions quickly even during the fishing season.I was impressed that one day a week they move the kitchen out tothe fishermen and prepare a real shore lunch - thats if youprovide the filets ;>)The resort has the feel of a fly in because the road tends tokeep people in camp - not a lot of traffic going into town.Their end of the lake is very private, not mamy cabins or boats.Other than the road in, the major drawback to my wife was thesoggy septic field you had to cross to get to the shower house.They have plans to replace it but I don't think they have doneso yet. It's too bad because I can't talk her into going back."
527957,Lunker,2003-02-24 11:49:00,27,"Replacing the septic field has been a long, drawn out process for more than one reason. It is nearing completion and, WORST case scenario, should be done by the end of this next season."
527958,brian1785,2003-02-24 13:59:00,1534,Has anyone heard if the owners are putting indoor plumbing in the cabins?
527959,Guest,2003-02-24 17:22:00,0,Talked to Steve this winter and he told me that he plans to but won't be this year. Are doing a major septic system and time won't allow both. But it is there goal to get it in as soon as they can.
527960,brian1785,2003-02-25 16:40:00,1534,Thanks Phil!
527961,Stealth,2003-02-25 18:51:00,93,How bad is the algea bloom in the mid to late August time frame??What did you have to do or how far did you have to go when you ran into the pea soup??
527962,Brian_MN,2003-02-26 12:35:00,738,"The fishing program is what makes Witch Bay unique. My family has been going up there for the past 5 years, and now I help with the Fishing Program around 20 days each summer. Our goal is to get you on fish as quickly as possible when you arrive in camp. We do this in several ways. In the evenings and before/after meals, we're happy to mark up your map with the spots that have been going recently and talk to you about presentations. In the mornings, we will lead a string of boats out on the lake and fish with you all day, moving as necessary to keep you on fish. Most guests are ready to head out on their own after a day or two of this, but some parties have fished with me every day for a week. You can do as much or as little as you like. In the evenings, I like to take a guest or two out and find them a muskie. We don't have to go more than 2-3 miles from camp to see one usually, and there's a legendary 52+ incher that lives around the first bend from camp, about 1/4 mile away.If you have any other questions, my e-mail is [email protected]."
527963,IAranger,2003-03-02 17:21:00,352,Thanks Brian actaully Brian'sI booked a stay for us 2nd week in July hope to see you there and go lookin for that big musky .... The one with my name on it !Jeff
527964,iamwalleye1,2003-03-03 17:42:00,1589,C P R EMSee ya up there!
527965,IAranger,2003-03-03 18:12:00,352,Hey Bill I am not sure if you remember me but You emailed me some pictures of your boat so I could see how to hookup my transducer as I had lotsa problems with my old boat and interference between the pinpiont and the Lowrance. I got a new boat this year ...another 620 This one is white with black purple and yellow stripes and purple seats. Looking forward to meeting you up there Jeff
527946,IAranger,2003-02-22 10:11:00,352,I am thinking about trying this place on LOTW. Have stayed at the angle last 4 yrs and just thinking about a change> Any input would be appreciatedJeff
527947,Guest,2003-02-22 10:37:00,0,"It is a great place to stay, only drive in lodge between Sioux Narrows and Kenora, twenty miles to each town, very secluded. Has great walleye, smallie, muskie, northern, and perch. Boats are state of the art and has fishing program to put you on the best fishing spots. Owners go out of there way to make you feel welcome. It is one of the better lodges in northwestern Ontario. And for you from Nestor Falls who may think this very praising post is by the owners or workers it is not. It by a person who has been there many times and a lot of other lodges as well."
527948,IAranger,2003-02-22 11:24:00,352,I am not sure why the comments about those from Nestor Falls ? I am looking for honest feedback here and I am not accusing you of anything misleading but maybe if you logged in and we could see who you are that would eliminate something like that even needing to be said. Is there some animosity or dishonesty about this particular resort I should be aware of ?
527949,Guest,2003-02-22 15:10:00,0,None whatsoever. There is this guy from Nestor Falls that criticizes most everytime a person makes a nice comment about a lodge. That is all there is to it. You just never know when you are going to get blind sided on this.
527950,Guest,2003-02-22 18:18:00,0,"I went there two yrs ago. Very nice and well run. They had 2 ""pros"" or guides who would run you out to the lake and show you spots and how to fish them. Meals were awesome. You dine with fine china, cloth napkins and table cloths. Felt sort of funny eating there after fishing all day and stinking like bait and walleyes. Great location for the mid lake summer fishing spots. The only problem is the road in there off of 71. If you are towing a boat it will take you an hour to travel the 6 miles."
527951,IAranger,2003-02-22 19:03:00,352,That was one of my complaints about going to the angle only it was 28 miles of it !
527952,brian1785,2003-02-22 22:35:00,1534,"Been there the last 2 years with my wife and 10 year old daughter. Love it. Everything Willeye said is true. The gravel road is really the only downside of the trip. The fishing is awesome. The ""pros"" who are there show you where to catch fish and are not shy about the information. We are going again this August. If you need anymore information, give me an email and I'll try to help you out. Good luck[email protected]"
527953,IAranger,2003-02-23 10:49:00,352,"Thanks Phil, Willeye, and BrianJeff"
527954,bellbuoy,2003-02-23 14:10:00,490,"I've been there 3 times, and recommend it highly. Yes the comments are true not only about the service and owners but also about the road, one of the other guests called it ""The Burma Road"". But he drove all the way from FL to Witch Bay every year. You may even be there when Mark Brumbaugh of the PWT is there. I was fortunate enough to meet him on my last trip there. Bob Mehsikomer was filming there the first time I was there in '98. He wasn't the highlight of the trip though, I thought he was pretty arrogant.Bellbuoy"
527955,brian1785,2003-02-23 22:35:00,1534,"The first year I was there, Mark Brumbaugh, Perry Good, and Bob ""Messycombover"" were all there. Brumbaugh was awesome. Sit down at your table and talk to you like a close relative. Perry Good and Bob M. on the other hand were very arrogant and into themselves. We didnt even bother with them. All in all, a great place with great service."
