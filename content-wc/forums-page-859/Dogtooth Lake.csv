I told him the same last year. It took him a little while, but he finally figuired it out. Anyone else who has been up there recently with info. we would love to hear how your trip was and what you were catching the fish on. Also, where you were would be helpful. So in other words I want you to do everything but catch my fish for me.jk"

532161,Mattman,2003-06-11 06:23:00,1603,Heading up to Dogtooth next (21st) weekend. Has anyone recently returned? How were the water levels? Can you get back to Kilvert with a smaller (16' w/ 40hp) boat? How was your fishing? Thanks. Better to have and not need than to need and not have! Matt Davis

532254,Guest,2003-06-12 14:34:00,0,"Four of us were up over memorial weekend,Yes you can get up to Kilvert takes a little longer as the water table is really low the creek is really low several lower units and props were lost by people not paying attention to the markers...Fishing at that time was ok for bigger fish lots of 24 26ers not many eaters..Now lots of eaters are being caught,now the bite is switching over to leeches and crawlers. My friend is up there now informed me that he is really happy with the action. I'm going back up Tuesday for 4 days,sounds like a good time to be there. Good Luck.

532267,Guest,2003-06-12 19:27:00,0,I am going up on the 20th-was also there for the Ontario opener. I took my 1890 into Kilvert but that was pushing it. They tore the bridge out and it is real shallow right there. We had ok fishing then but it should be real good by next weekend.
532342,Guest,2003-06-14 21:00:00,0,"Just got back from Dogtooth. Water level is down 6-12 inches I suppose. You will have little trouble getting through with your rig. Just be careful. They brought in big rocks to hold the shoreline after they removed the Kilvert bridge. It looks more like they dumped them in quickly and left. Maybe they settled wrong or moved. Just keep it straight and keep motor tilted through there and where the beaver dam is as it is very shallow there too. Maybe get a little speed up before you hit those spots so you can coast with motor up a bit higher. Fishing was great but eaters were a little harder to find than usual during our stay. We focused more on big fish spots though. If you stay at Dogtooth Resort, tell Wayne hi from The Sheriff. He'll know who you are talking about. Wayne and Patty are great people and run a fantastic resort! Good luck and enjoy your trip. The Sheriff"
532881,Guest,2003-06-25 19:04:00,0,"We are heading up to dogtooth soon and I was wondering if anyone has any recent reports. Water levels, fishing, flies, etc. How is the drive to Kilvert and can it be done in a 17ft. fishhawk. Thanks for any new info."
532884,Guest,2003-06-25 19:16:00,0,My friend just got back. Mayfly hatch is over. Fishing was shut down for five days during the hatch. Two guys caught only 26 fish in four days of fishing. Getting into Kilvert was fine for him (19 foot Warrior). they caught most fish on slip bobbers.
533165,Guest,2003-07-02 14:29:00,0,"We are headed up next week. Has anyone got any new info on where the fish are biting and what people are using to get the little buggers. thanks, chris"
533191,Guest,2003-07-03 07:53:00,0,"Chris, I will also be up there next week. If you want to ask any questions send me an email at [email protected] I would love to hear how your fising is going. i believe we are in cabin 4. Good luck. I heard fising is slow, but big fish are being caught. 5-10 fish perday with none being eaters."
