The seller told me it has been well maintained over the years and they are asking $500.00 canadian.I was wondering what to look for when I go and see it? Thank you Rob"

I'd be slightly more concerned about the motor. By all means, take it for a good ride and put it through the paces. See how the motor starts when cold then run it at various speeds including idle and wide open. If it's all in good condition, $500 is a great price--even if it needs a little work. Just be careful it's not a money pit. You may want to consider taking it to a mechanic. Good luck, Trout"

My son, who is an auto mechanic by trade, reapirs older Johnson and Evinrude Motors on the side and we also collect a few. Generally, if they run and pump water a decent overhall makes them run like new. If you have any questions send me an E Mail at [email protected] Good luck, sounds like a deal on this end."
