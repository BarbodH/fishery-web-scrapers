533228,Guest,2003-07-04 21:30:00,0,I was looking over my hott spots map of erie and was wondering if anyone ever fished grubb reef(just off of point pelee)??? What were your results for walleye?? I was thinking of taking an weekend adventure on lake erie and was wondering if this would be a good spot to catch some trophy eyes???
