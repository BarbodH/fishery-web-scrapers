533329,Guest,2003-07-08 12:28:00,0,"I was at the Tomahawk last fall (early Sept.) We were only using their camping area (RV area as well), so I have no experience with the Lodges/accomodations. But, for us, some of the other facilities were of great importance. The showers and washrooms were top-notch. I even heard they had laundry facilities there. The docking site was great too....pluggins for batteries, gas at the dock. Leave all your stuff at the dock...no one will steal anything. We didn't have too much contact with the 'staff', but one young dockhand befriended us and had a few beers with us at the end of each day. If you can afford it, I can't see any reason not to recommend it. As they told me about their place when I phoned to reserve a spot, they said the extra charge for docking etc. was because they were all about quality...no skrimping. A nice place.....search around they have a website. -J"
