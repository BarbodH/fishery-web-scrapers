Anyone out there with time up there at that time of year? We did this at lac saul and were the only people in camp. the end of the season I guess. I you had a choice would you go back to lac saul or lake of the woods? what lodge would have the best deal do you think? I know there are a lot of experienced people out there, what do you think? thanks a lot alan"
533196,MTJ,2003-07-03 09:56:00,106,"September is a great month on LOTW. We usually go up every weekend. Eyes, Crappie, Muskies are really on by the end of the month and till the end of October. I would personally say that the second week of Sept. to the third week of October can produce the best fishing. The colors are beautiful, the Eagles are busy bulking up, no heavy trafic, no bugs, and best of all I've never broke a sweat in late Sept. All of the resorts in the Morson area are great and usually have openings in late Sept. and October."
533200,Guest,2003-07-03 11:06:00,0,"I agree with MTJ's comments. I spend 10 days at LOTW every Oct. The fishing can be excellent, colors are fantastic, it's fun having a fire in the cabin all the time, and there's a good chance of getting a little snow. The lake is almost deserted. More hunters there at that time of year than fishermen. If you like being outdoors in the fall, there's no better place than NW Ontario."
533213,Guest,2003-07-03 19:47:00,0,"MTJ, What is the pattern for crappie this time of year. Do you all catch any smallmouth then? Don"
533218,Guest,2003-07-04 11:55:00,0,Crappie are suspended a couple feet off the bottom in about 22-25 feet in the fall. Use a crappie rig with white twister tails. Hay Island and Thompson Creek area are good spots.
533221,Guest,2003-07-04 13:26:00,0,"I have spent some time on LOTW in the fall, but much more time on Lac Seul. The reason is because, like the rest of the year, the fishing is better on Lac Seul, at least in my experiences. If you go late enough, you will get a deal at any lodge as the season closes, so price is comparable regardless of the location. I have had many incredible days in September and early October. Like the others mentioned, nice colours, nice temperature, and no bugs. The one bad thing . . . the northwestern Ontario (NWO) climate is highly variable in the fall (i.e., high winds). When combined with the lake-generated wind due to differences between water temperature and ambient air temperature, it can really rock and roll out there. Of course, the fish are often in deep water on breaks surrounding or within the main lake basin at this time, and as such to cath the fish you have to deal with the wind. On Lac Seul, the main lake basin will often have 3-4' waves in September. If you don't mind a bouncy ride and have a good bilge on a good booat you will be fine, and you will catch a lot of fish!"
533234,fourize,2003-07-05 08:09:00,287,"Don't fish lac saul or LOTW, but My Dad and I do fish Ontario in the fall. Sept. 20th thru Oct. 4th this year. Like everyone has said, no bugs, and very light fishing pressure. Last year, we were the only ones at the lodge for a 3 day stretch, had the lakes to ourselves and caught alot of walleyes. The only thing was the weather was unpredictable. We had a couple days that were really warm, you could fish in shorts, and we had days where you would wake up in the morning and everything would be covered with frost. But all things considered, we are definately sticking with fall fishing. We love it. 76 more days!!!"
533291,MTJ,2003-07-07 12:48:00,106,"We usually fish the Thompson Creek area. The crappies are usually in 12-20' on shelvels near deeper water (20-40'). 1/16-1/8 oz jigs with minnows or even twister tails. Have never went looking for smallies in late Sept. or October but have picked up a few fishing points for walleyes. Walleyes are usuall on in October, work points adjacent to deep channels. 1/8-1/4oz jigs with minnows works great."
