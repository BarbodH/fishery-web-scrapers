533270,Guest,2003-07-07 08:34:00,0,"I have fished Clay Lake several times. Find my post on North Star Lodge report and you will be able to gather some info there. Don't know much about Big Canon other than Father owns Canon and the 2 sons own NorthStar(Clay). Very good fishing, very good people."

The cabins are rustic but clean with hot & cold water, shower and flush toilets. Plenty of firewood on the porch for the wood stove and a small frig for drinks. It is American Plan only and the food was excellent. Each group of 2 fisherman will be assigned 2 16 foot lunds with 4 stroke 25 hp electric start Yamaha. One on the main lake and one on the river. We caught lots of 2-3lb smallies on the main lake points using 3/8 oz jigs and grubs and Hot-n-Tots. Lots of 3-5lb lake trout on the main lake slow trolling 3/4 oz blue/silver Little Cleos about 50 ft down at the time. Most of the walleye and northerns we caught on the river. We caught plenty of walleye, but mostly pretty small, 16-20in. We caught lots of northern 25-40in. For musky we portaged to No Name lake, about 2 hours each way, but we caught 9 musky in 5 hours, 30-40 inches. The owners and staff were great and we plan on going back in the near future."
533296,FishTwentyFourSeven,2003-07-07 14:31:00,38,"I went there, uh, three years ago. Man how times flys. Positives are: excellent fishing(big plus), excellent boats, well run operation. I prefer to have a bit less people in camp but they have a lot of lakes to fish. We didn't spend much time on the main lake, due to the small Walleye population, but fished it a couple nights after dinner and found some Lake Trout. They will help put you on fish. Talk to Jeff if he is still there. Negatives are: cabins a little rustic(but clean), food was all right(nothing special), otter kept stealing our minnows. All in all it is a good camp to try out. I think the positives out weigh the negatives. If Seguise is hitting you will have a blast, but I heard that it is on one day and off the next. Cross your fingers. I also heard that his son's camp has been taking a lot of people in there. We had a good time and I don't see why you shouldn't. When I am listing the negatives I am being a bit picky, but if you are not that particular you won't even notice them. Jerry"

She likes the place, great food,good fishing and comfortable camp. North Star Camp is clean and has both older and newer cabins. Quite a large camp but that isn't a problem once on the water as they are the only camp on the lake. There is a public access so sometimes there will be others. We did well on W.E. about 150 in three days, nothing big, 22-23"" although another fisherman caught 2 about 25"". Biggest Northern 36"" Our best luck was by ""West Narrows"" in 11-14'. Any where by rocky points and down by Seguise bay. Sam or Stan should be able to tell you. They can give you a good map of the lake. Smallmouth can be great early,(end of May)down west where the river comes in. We caught a couple while Walleye fishing, wife got a 18"" that was fun. Never really fished them but I have a freind that goes earlier and talks about hundreds. Never fished muskies as you have to go to other lakes. My only experience with Canon lake is one year we went down to the portage where he met us and trucked us across. We did get three or four trout but it was windy and we didn't fish long. Fishnut"
