It had been in the high 80's for several days before we arrived. We caught quite a few fish on Sat. evening, Sunday and Mon. Straight hook and crawler. We fished Keg alot. Wed. morning it turned to 54 degrees , rain and smoke all over the lake, Thursday it was 45 degrees and cold rain. Needless to say, lousy fishing. Oh, almost forgot -- mayfly hatch about everyday. Catching a fish is a plus, well needed rest, cigars and Labatt blue light.and walleye every night."
533308,Guest,2003-07-08 07:07:00,0,Was also there the week of the 21st. Fishing was the worst its ever beenb but as other poster stated it was more due to the weather and mayfly hatch than anything. Fishing should pick up again hopefully by the time you arrive.
533316,Guest,2003-07-08 08:37:00,0,Jeff- You will probably hit them good. My week was one of the ones you dream about not happening! You will have a great time as always.
