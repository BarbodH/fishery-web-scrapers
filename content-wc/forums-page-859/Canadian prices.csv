A note, however, on prices in Canada: Contrary to some posts I read before going, many prices are a lot higher as you cross the border. Gas, in particular, was a lot higher. By the time we calculated litres versus gallons and factored in the exchange, we figured gas was close to double. Also cigarettes were a lot higher. On a positive note, we stopped to pick up some food just across the border. Prices were very good for the most part. One exception was some fresh fruit and vegetables. Good fishing! Trout"
