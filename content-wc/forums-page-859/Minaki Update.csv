Tough going for them fish under 18"" so you may want to bring along a extra sandwich ! The Big Beach is producing lots as are the humps near the beach. St.Johns is holding nice fish. The crank bite has started in the early evening and as always is lots of fun. Lots of fish caught here as well. The west side of Harbour Island on the mud flat has been good, but I expect that to drop off in production. I would say that this year in general has been a very good one....... let's hope it holds out ! Now to a different subject. This will be my last ""regular"" post. I have decided to return to my television career. I will no longer be associated with the Minaki Lodge. It was a different experience being out there, one that I'm chalking up to life's journey. The ownership group of the Lodge are great guys & I truely wish them all the success in the future. (including you Turbo):-) These guys are hard working & dedicated to the success of the Lodge. When the lodge is successful, we all benefit. Good Fishen Rob"

LOL!! Take care and I'll try to get in touch with you shortly. Good Luck Rob!! Rod"

Stopped in at the dockside to eat a few times (nice place.....I especialy enjoyed the red head....LOL) and you were no where to be found. Walleye fishing seemed to be slower than usual but I'm sure that had something to do with the Mayfly hatch. I thought the lodge looked good, in fact I'm going to have to bring my golf clubs next year. Good luck."
