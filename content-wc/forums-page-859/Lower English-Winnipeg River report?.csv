I've heard that the two rivers are great for walleyes and northerns. Also, any reports on Tetu Island Lodge? First time staying there. Thanks"
533255,Guest,2003-07-06 20:11:00,0,Tetu Island Lodge is one of the finest camps I have ever stayed at. The fishing was good but was more like fishing on a river than in lakes for walleyes. My son caught his first master angler there. You will have a blast.
