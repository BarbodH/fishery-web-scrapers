My trip was a complete success, with only a few things I'd do differently: more soda, more water, more oil for frying fish and a tarp for the screen tent. We fished pretty much every day for about 10-12 hours, catching our limit every day, eating fish one, maybe two times a day. We didn't get a chance to get out to ""Lac Seul"" the big lake, however, we did fish the straights going out to the big lake. There is no doubt in my mind, that you could catch walleye in the mud puddles up there, they are everywhere. We mainly fished the west side of a bridge by Webster....ask around, people know where it is and you'll find it. If you find it and see a beaver hut, that is where we fished, you're guaranteed a limit out of that hole - fish the drop off into the 13-15 feet of water for the monsters. WATCH OUT FOR ROCKS....my little 25 HP broke a shear pin on the third day....don't know what I hit, but...... We mainly trolled 8-20 feet of water with a Lindy Rig, copper/gold spinner, dragging a night crawler. Fish went nuts over this. We didn't do a whole lot of jigging, as we really didn't need to. The walleye ranged from yearlings (4-6 inches) to our biggest 26 inches - 9 pounds. We did bring salted minnows in, but tossed them as crawlers were doing a fine, fine job on their own. Northern - perch crank baits were hot all week long (for big walleye too), trolling the shorelines anywhere from 10-25 feet of water. Deep Divers worked well too. I had a hot, hot day dragging a Crawfish painted deep diver that rattled, landed 4 big northern in 30 minutes. Camping was at Country Camping on HWY 664 just before you get to Sioux Lookout. Nice place, water and electricity were provided, along with a brand new shower house with a toilet and sink. A fish cleaning hut was provided with a big freezer to store your fish. 4 guys stayed five nights camping, we only paid $43.00 US per person. Can't beat that in my eyes. www.countrycamping.net Oh yeah, gas is $3.00 a gallon up there, so stop in International Falls and gas up for your week long trip, it will save you a ton of money. On top of that, the gas stations screw you on the exchange rate (I.E. 6 gallons of gas and 2 quarts of oil = $36.00 US dollars - complete bull$hit). Bring lots of batteries as 2 AAA batteries are $5 US dollars, so are AA and D's....... Lastly, watch out for moose on your way in. We saw five coming up and then 2 going home - the trip leaving the US and the rest of Canada has some bumpy and very winding roads. Don't worry about the fires up there, they are under control and probably no where near where you are going. Don't forget your sun block and rain gear, fishing is good even when its 90 degrees and pouring rain. Greatest experience for me was when we landed all our fish early one day, we fished Lake Vermillion for smallies when a huge muskie followed my blue rattler crank bait up to the boat. I have never seen a muskie before, but to see it chace my cranker up to the boat, I almost felt afraid for my life. It had to be at least 50 inches.... Enjoy the fishing guys, you'll never forget it."

533219,Guest,2003-07-04 12:38:00,0,"Yes we did do a little smallie fishing on Vermillion, but it was moreso just to do it because we wrapped up walleye fishing so early in the day that day. My boat didn't land any but our other boat caught a few....nothing too big, they were all thrown back. The best smallie landed was a 16 incher from Lac Seul. However, as you read before, I had that muskie follow my cranker to the boat....boy was that an experience. We also tried to get on some lake trout, however, that got boring real fast after nailing the walleye all day long. I think after a long day on the water in the sun, we were more so just killing time and having fun, patience wasn't quite there."
533222,fishnut,2003-07-04 13:57:00,46,"Wooglin, I've stayed at Country Camping a number of times and I agree, nice place. See any Flying Squirrels??? Does Judy still run it? I suppose you launched at Hudson so where is Webster? We used to get Smallies in Lost lake in the narrows straight accros from the Hudson launch. We would make the long trip down the English to the main lake then west to Canoe Narrows and Grassy bay, both great places. Also the Trout fishing can be good in BV, one day caught 5 in a row about 30 min using big white jigs with minnows. But have also gotten skunked in that lake. Fishnut"
533227,hgf,2003-07-04 20:38:00,199,"I was there the same time, same place, but only two days. Agree it is a nice place. New owner, looks like he is trying to keep it a nice campground. I was in a pickup camper, so never saw the inside of the cabins. But they looked nice from the outside. Fishing was very good in Lac Seul, lots of walleyes. I hit most of mine in pretty shallow water, 9, 10 feet, some at 12 or 13 feet, used minnows almost exclusively. Nothing spectacular, but worth going back."
533233,Guest,2003-07-05 08:08:00,0,"Are you from Iowa, if so, I remember your set up; the big truck camper with the awesome boat. Nice set up! But, there was another truck camper that was there who left a day or two after we arrived, so I am unsure which one you were :). We were down in the corner, two trucks, two boats with four tents on our site. Anyway, yes Judy still owns the place from what I understand, but a guy named Don from norther Quebec was there running the show. He was a great guy, always had the place nice and clean, cutting grass, emptying trash and keeping the facilities in tip top shape. We launched into Lac Seul on a launch site about 3 miles towards Hudson from Country Camping. Webster, I am not sure how to get there by truck/car, but we always made the journy by boat. We had a GPS to rely on, so I really couldn't give you great directions to the bridge. Straight line from the launch, I'd say it was in the Northwest direction. WE'll be back, the price is right...."
