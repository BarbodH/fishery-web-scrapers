Couldn't get out to the flats as it was rough and my fishing partner (my mom!) was a bit frieked out when the waves came over the bow.The Red produced only two walleyes (22 & 25.5"") and saugers every 15-30 seconds!!!. Lots of boats!The feeling is that both spots are just starting to go off - especially the red.LaterChris"

Caught a limit of 1-2lb walleyes to take home, biggest was only a 3lber. Nothing too exciting was happening in the other 10 boats around us who also were trolling around. Fish are not yet concentrated in specific areas, we were picking them up here and there. Couple more freezing nights should get things going."
515064,Hawgeye,2001-09-24 07:32:00,1355,Thanks for the report Chrism. I will be there in 5 days. SOunds like above average temps for the rest of the week. Maybe with cool nights it might start soon. How was the current and water depth? Did you see anyone fishing up by the dam or jigging in the river?
