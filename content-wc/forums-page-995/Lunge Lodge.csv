515017,Will,2001-09-18 18:27:00,70,"Just returned from a muskie fishing trip. Lots of muskies seen including several 50+ inchers. One 50 incher and another 49 incher were caught as well as several more in the 40 - 46 inch range. Walleyes are starting to make a comeback with the slot limit applied. Although the walleyes seem to be slowing down right now, this past spring and summer produced some nice walleyes off of the mid river humps. Diane serves up some great dinners also if you go on the American plan. Beautiful area to fish also. You can send them an e-mail at [email protected] for more info."
