515049,Snowman,2001-09-20 12:27:00,70,Heading up next Thursday (9-27) for the first time. Can't access the Manitoba fishing regs online for some reason. A few questions:1. Will I need to use barbless hooks?2. How many lines per person are allowed?3. Should I concentrate on jigging or cranking?4. Anybody have a current report?Thanks!
515050,Guest,2001-09-20 13:33:00,0,"In Manitoba you must have all your barbs on your hooks bent back wheather they are on the rod you are using or any rod that has a hook on it. You can only use one line per person. The Winnepeg river itself I have found better to us a jig and a minnow on a shallow reef or bar. If you travel out into Traverse bay I have had real good luck trolling Cranks. Anything from #8 Shad Raps, Risto Raps, A bombers. anything that works well at 10-12 ft. It seems that the color of choice is differant every time I go up there. The last report I have heard is that fishing is pretty slow. But that should change with some cold weather and a north wind. I will be going there tommorow for five days and will give a report when I get back. If all else fails the cats are bitting at the Red River at Lockport.Harty"
