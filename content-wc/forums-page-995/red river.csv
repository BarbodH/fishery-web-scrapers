This guide named Mark Svendsen didn't know a thing about fishing. He couldn't drive the boat, almost tipped us when he went to take a leak. He was scared of the fish and my fillets all have bones in them. He didn't know anything about fishing and kept talking about the moon not being aligned right so we won't catch any big ones. To all fisherman this guy is a smooth talker and acts like he knows alot. Don't be suckered in to him guiding you. What a joke!!Pickeral Pete"

514958,Guest,2001-09-18 14:21:00,0,"This Mark Svendson guy sounds like a real flake. I am utterly amazed he sucked you into going fishing with him. It sounds to me like he should take up checkers or something. Geez, geta life Mark!!! Now, i know of a real guide, i cant tell you his name, but just look for the 'SS Minnow'."
514959,Guest,2001-09-18 19:38:00,0,This Pickerel Pete AKA Jamie Duval is some kind of joker. First of all I pick him up at the boat launch and he keeps refering to himself in third party as the Fishin Musician. Let me tell you this guy was the worst fisherman and they only notes he could play were flat. I've seen little kids who could set a hook better than this clown. However he did get lucky enough to snag a sewer bass by the tail. Then he asks if I had any dirty diapers to cook it over. This guy is just wierd. He is a freakin disaster in the boat and if I had to do it over again no amount of money would be worth it.
