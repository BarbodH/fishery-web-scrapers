515053,Guest,2001-09-22 09:11:00,0,I'll be there the 24th - 29th. I heard that the action was very slow. Has it been picking up at all or is there some place better I could catch some big eyes? Thank you
515054,Guest,2001-09-22 21:42:00,0,"i just back tonight from a 4 day trip. This was my first year up there so i really cant compare ""slowness"" to other years, but I have to say, for me, it seemed pretty good. I know I went up there too early and next year will go a couple weeks later, but we got a 12.4 and a couple 8-9's as well as a smattering of 5-6's. But we sorted thru a lot of little ones as well.Hope this helps"

515059,Guest,2001-09-24 06:43:00,0,"Fished Traverse Bay on Saturday (Sept 22nd), although we caught a limit of nice 1-2lb walleye to take home, I would suggest that conditions are still very slow. Fish do not appear to be concentrated in any specific areas yet. Hence trolling crankbaits appears to be the best option currently. Only about 10 boats out on the lake Saturday, most were trolling. Only saw one real big one get hauled in and RELEASED....nice to see. It has gone below freezing the last couple of nights, I think we need a couple more nights like this before things will get hot and heavy."
