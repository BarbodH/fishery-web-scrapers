I'm looking for any info - am going out this weekend (Sept. 22/23) and would appreciate any input. I typically use bottom bouncers and crawlers, but... Location info would be very useful (obviously).Thanks"
514979,Guest,2001-09-17 17:30:00,0,Fished Big Whiteshell 2 weeks ago and it was slow going. Just got some info. from last weekend and things are looking up. With the cooler weather in the fall the fish tend to move onto flats and actively look for food. I like to jig with a minnow while useing the electric to move around. When the water temp. drops I find slower presentation works well. I know of peaple that in the fall do very well fishing from shore with pickeral rigs. I'm heading out there on the weekend so if you need more info. just let me know. Hope things work out for both of us.
514980,Guest,2001-09-18 10:21:00,0,For the fall at Big Whiteshell I would suggest you switch over to jigs and salted minnows for this time of year. Big Whiteshell is a good alternate to battling the boat launch blues that will soon start on the Red and at Pine Falls. Only problem with the Big Whiteshell is when there fall fishing is hot it is hard to get keepers under 15 inches.
