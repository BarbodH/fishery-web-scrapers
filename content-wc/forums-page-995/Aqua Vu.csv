515024,Guest,2001-09-20 21:20:00,0,Hi Rod:Love my Aqua Vu For ice fishing in a hut or fish trap. Look in Oct.-Nov. In Fisherman magazine and see story of updated model (page 63). They now have directional indicator so you know what direction the camera is pointing.Also temperature sensor. And for $27.00 you can buy a image magnifier to change your screen from 4 inch to 10 inch and it will fit most Aqua Vu cameras. Call Nature Vision 1-218/825-0733. I ordered mine today.
