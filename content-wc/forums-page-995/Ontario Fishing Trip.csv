They fish five lakes with portages to all using 8 wheelers and they do trailer boats over for you as well. They also do daily fly outs to another lake but it is not needed because you are already 135 miles north of the nearest road. It is located north of Red Lake Ontario. If you dad likes big pike this place is perfect for you. The walleye and lake trout fishing is awesome as well. Do a search on this board for way north and read some of the posts. Good luck with where ever you go. E-mail me if you want more info.Duffy"
514926,Guest,2001-09-19 12:54:00,0,"I just returned from my seventh trip to Northwinds outfitters. They really cater to the customer. Each night they ask what type of fishing you want to do tomorrow. They take you to a lake that has great fishing for that species. The camp is family run and they treat you like a member of the family. If a lake is hot they will suggest that lake. The guides talk to guides who fish othe lakes every day to find what lakes are working. We fished two days on Lac Suel and our party of four had 33 walleyes over 25 inches. 19 were over 27. Most of the people I know who go there are repeat customers. Just my opinion, I don't work for them but do recommend them."
514919,Riceburner,2001-09-21 07:11:00,436,Hi Fred--Talked to you earlier about St Joe---how was your trip this year?? Any big walleyes?? THX.
514920,Fred_G,2001-09-21 11:19:00,908,"Hi Riceburner! We had a great trip again this year. I think the fishing is getting better every year. My biggest eye this year was a 25"" beauty. Very first fish of the trip in fact. Sure was a great way to start the week. One of the guys in the group had a 26"" walleye during the week, and we caught all kinds of 22 - 24 inchers. My friend John's 10 year old son Spencer caught the big fish of the week, a 43 1/2"" pike, and Dad finished the week with a 40"" pike. Spence also had a couple of 24"" walleyes during the week.I'm already looking forward to next year. There's a big girl out there that broke me off and I want a second chance to boat her. Oh the things we have to dream about.Fred"
514913,Guest,2001-09-12 18:55:00,0,"I looking into a Ontario fishing trip next with with 73 year old father. He is in good health and very fit. I was looking at ""Northwinds Canadian Outfitters"". They are a drive in (American Plan) at a base camp and offer remote fly-in outposts. You can pretty much customize a trip the way you want it, three days at an outpost(fly-in), serveral days at the base camp and one trip to an outpost lake, or fish each day at a different lake that your guide takes you to. They try to stay on top of the fishing action by having the ability to move to different lakes. This can be done in 4 wheel drives pulling deluxe boats or ATV's with smaller boats. They are located out of Vermilion Bay and have access to over ten other lakes.Any info or better suggestings for a first time trip. (I'm looking forward to a fly-in experience).My father really enjoys fishing for northern pike and like walleyes.Thanks"
514914,Guest,2001-09-13 17:21:00,0,"Checkout Amik Outposts. I don't have a number, but I bet you can find them on the internet if you search for them. They have about 6 outpost camps where there's only one cabin per lake. They fly out of Ear Falls. I went to Lake Findlay and had great fishing in late May last year. My friend went again this year with great sucess again.A good choice for big Northern is Little Vermillion Lake in Ontario. It's also a fly-in, but accomodates more people. Again, sorry I don't have a number, but try to search the internet. If you're interested in more info email me at [email protected] and I can get you some phone numbers. Good luck.For a great trip that's not such a far drive, and is as remote as a lot of fly-ins, you can't be Reel 'em Inn Lodge on Lake of the Woods,out of Morson. It's a 25 mile boat-in, the lodge is on an island in the middle of the lake. I've made 8 trips there in the past 6 years. Great fishing, great accomodations, reasonable prices. It's American Plan only, they do all the cooking and clean all the fish.....the only way to go in my opinion. It's truly a relaxing trip with lots less work than my old trips where we did all the work and cooking. Their phone number is 807-488-5802. Winter number is 218-634-1579."
514915,Guest,2001-09-13 17:24:00,0,"I meant to say in my previous post...""you can't BEAT the Reel 'em Inn"". You probably understood, but just wanted to clarify. Good luck."
514916,Guest,2001-09-13 17:47:00,0,Thanks for the reply.Does anybody else care to comment?Thanks
514917,Dave,2001-09-13 18:24:00,258,"Check out Uchi Lake. They fly out of Sioux Lookout. I went 2 years ago and it was my favorite fishing trip to Ontario. I would like to go again but now that I made a large investment in a boat I had better use the boat and not fly-in,anyway it is the onlyresort on the lake with a max. of 24 people at one time. Easy lake to fish with access to 2 other lakes. They offer a full american plan and the meals are great! Fresh desserts flown in from Sioux Lookout almost daily. Made by the owners Mom! I swear this is true. I do not work for them or anything. Just an honest opinion from one person. They do have a website. Check them out for yourself and get references."
514918,Fred_G,2001-09-14 05:35:00,908,"Chester,This isn't a fly in, but a very good drive in. The Old Post & Village on Lake St. Joseph is, in my opinion, one of the nicest fishing camps you will ever encounter. John Grace and his staff really go all out for their guests. The walleye and pike fishing is excellent, for numbers and size. Check out their website at www.oldpost.com.Fred"
514921,Guest,2001-09-16 11:31:00,0,"I recommend Eagle Lake Sportsmen's Lodge on Eagle Lake (very close to Vermillion Bay). The type of trip you are planning is going to be exhaustive even for a young guy! For a lot less $$$ and a huge lake to fish on (along with several smaller lakes accessable from Eagle Lake), as well as 4x4 trips available, a lodge seems better suited to your desires. All you bring is your tackle and food... and there is a liquor store and grocery store in Vermillion Bay. Contact Jim or Cindy Buhlman at (807) 227-5318 for info - and tell them Gene sent you... or check out their website at: http://www.duenorth.net/eaglelakesportsmenslodge You can also email them at: [email protected]"

514923,Guest,2001-09-17 10:44:00,0,"I've done the fly-in outpost thing several times too. I urge you to seriously consider what is best for both you and your elder. In spite of his current physical state, that can change for any of us - but if it should change for him you should ensure there is a way to communicate with the base camp to get help. Cell phones don't work well in the bush, I don't know enough about the satellite phones to guess on their effectiveness. If the outpost has no radio, I'd find one that does. A drive-in venue may be best for all concerned for this time. have fun! m"
514924,Jig Master,2001-09-17 20:35:00,189,Might want to check out Lecuyer's lodge. I went last summer and I'm definately going back. Everything was just great.http://www.lecuyerslodge.com/Jig Master
