514857,Guest,2001-09-20 12:50:00,0,"Hey Doc.We are going to be in the Nester Falls area the 22-29th also.We stay on Crow lake but never fish their, we always fish LOTW. From the resort we can either go to Stevens, Whitefish or Nestor Falls. We do fish around Nester Falls for the crappie, but also have found some other real good areas also. As for Walleyes we have caught some of our biggest fish in the 26+ up in Whitefish. Well we are sure looking forward to another good week of fishing on LOTW as always. Maybe we will cross paths on the lake. I have a Warrior boat.(not many of them on that part of the lake) So if you see me give me a wave and mabe we can compare notes. See you on the Lake."
514858,Guest,2001-09-20 14:55:00,0,"Wallhammer, look for a tan Sylvan Backtroller with a Merc. on the back. Old boat but works great, will keep an eye open for ya. Good Luck, Doc To bad you don't fish Crow, I would like to try for some lakers for a change of pace. Thinking about hiring the guide from Helliar's and giving it a try this year. Can't find a top. map of Crow and hear it is very dangerous with reefs that come out of nowhere. But do know they do well on lakers. Doc"
514859,Guest,2001-09-21 07:15:00,0,"DocI will keep an eye out for you. We are leaving at noon today to beat the traffic at the border. As for the Lakers on Crow, one of the guys in our group does spend a day or two fishing for them always comes in with something but not great. I also know their is some hazards to watch out for on the lake. The water clarity is unbelievable on the lake. Well good luck to you and maybe we will see you on the lake."
514860,Guest,2001-09-23 20:32:00,0,"We did not have any luck as we fished saturday the 15th through tuesday. Worked bottom bouncers and crawlers with some minnows. Real light bite and had to let them have it, do not jerk as it would come out of their mouth - steady pull on tight line. Fished camp mostly and some around Wolf. Crappies were not in fall spots as the water was too warm. I really think you will hit it great. White and Orange blades did the best and we caught most of our crappies on worms rather than minnows. Brother did some northern fishing around Blueberry, but no eys. Good luck and let me hear how ya did."
514847,Guest,2001-09-09 10:12:00,0,My brothers and I are heading up to Sunset Lodge in Nestor Falls LOTW on Sept 15th for a few days. Any word on Walleye and Crappie fishing? How much are worms in Nestor and availablility?
514848,Guest,2001-09-09 10:55:00,0,Worms were $45 us a flat. Fsidhing was so so..crappies are biting ..walleyes around 28 ft.
514849,Wtrfwlhntr,2001-09-09 11:50:00,2,crawlers 45 a flat walleyes are way off 34' nobody getting walleyes anywhere
514850,PWaldow123,2001-09-09 20:44:00,198,"Larry, the crappies were going bananas when I was up there a week ago. It would be a fairly long boat ride for you (about an hour) If you are interested e-mail me and I can give you some details.Paul[email protected]"
514851,Guest,2001-09-12 10:06:00,0,"Hey Larry,Just got back from 4 days at Nestor Falls. The Crappie were numerous and everywhere. The Walleye on the other hand were far and few between - kind of tough sledding. We found that the most consistent Walleye fishing were on mud flats like you find in the middle of GoHere bay (that's the bay just West and South of Wolfe Island. We were catching the Walleyes by dragging bottom bouncers rigged with live minnows and flourescent green blades, white blades and flourescent orange (plus some hammered bronze). We tried crawlers but the live minnows out performed by far.By this weekend maybe the weather will change and the fall patterns will set in. I figure either this weekend or next and the Walleye fishing should be great.Good Luck"
514852,Guest,2001-09-12 19:42:00,0,"Thanks for the reply. Did you fish around the falls for crappies? We usually do not get much past Blueberry, but we have a bigger boat now and may try to explore a bit. We have had luck the last few years for 'eyes in camp bay. Did you try there?"
514853,Guest,2001-09-13 15:27:00,0,"Ya the falls produced. Haven't tried Camp. Always wanted to but we never seem to get there. This probably would have been a good year to try. Definitely next year.Also to note, there was a big hatch of small midges (or something) happening on the mud flats the past week. The minnows were feeding foraciously and all the Walleye had stomaches full of minnows.I think you have timed it perfectly to get in on the start of the fall feed."
514854,Guest,2001-09-13 16:51:00,0,"Larry,are you refering to Blueberry Island? If you are, are you fishing for crappies or walleyes? My wife and I go to Nestor Falls the last week in Sept. every year, for I think this will be #7, and have never targeted any areas around this island. To me it didn't look deep enough for the traditional crappie haunts this time of year. We stay at Helliar's right at the falls, and in the past have had our best walleye action in Big Camp Bay pulling shad raps on lead core. Crappies are also very good at the mouth of this bay. We don't usually travel much past these points but have gone as far as Hay Island, found just as many nice crappies in close to the falls so saw no need to travel unless the weather was great and needed a boat ride. We will be there 9/22-9/29 and can't wait to get there. Would like to here how you did if your back before we go. Thanks Doc"
514855,Guest,2001-09-14 11:17:00,0,"Hey Doc,We were out at Helliar's last week and Wayne was telling us that its been a very unusual year. Just a little too warm. Tell me, how deep do you drag those shad raps on lead core? Also, have you ever taken any large Walleye out of Camp Bay? I've never seen anything larger than 25 inches come out of the Nestor Falls area and would be interested to know about Camp."
514856,Guest,2001-09-14 12:32:00,0,"Jack, we generally troll about 30' and our best is in the 25"" range. Have also had a few respectable slime darts, even a few saugers. I've never seen any large 'eyes but Wayne and Les have told me about some dandy fish taken in some of our favorite crappie spots. Doc"
