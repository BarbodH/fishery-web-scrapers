514281,Northern Manitoban,2001-08-04 23:17:00,195,I would say your chances are very good this is a great trophy lake.I have been wanting to go there for years.I was looking through my master angler book from last year and alot of Trophys came out of there last year and alot in the month of July.I would stay a week if i was you.The biggest that was recorded was 33 inches.Wish i was going.FISH ON.
514282,Guest,2001-08-05 17:48:00,0,thanks for the info fish on. any one else out there with any comments
514283,Guest,2001-08-05 19:10:00,0,"I heard that a Vet from around Lansing, MI owned a lodge up on that lake. Babe Winkleman has shot some nice shows up there, the book says ALOT of huge 'eyes have been caught in the lake, but also that its not a cheap place to go as in well over $1000 for a week, but then hey...its only money!!!"
514284,Guest,2001-09-14 19:39:00,0,"Been going to Gunisao for ten years. Awesome lake, with tons of big walleyes. I always go in the spring. Top notch all the way."
514285,Guest,2001-09-16 21:49:00,0,thanks for the delayed comeback. thats pretty much what we heard. the lodging-is it 5 star-4-3 or what. time to go late may and early june?
514286,Jim,2001-09-18 19:09:00,238,"The lodging is very nice, excellent food and service. Be prepared though for a fairly large outlay of cash. My wife and I stayed for 4 days in July about 5 years ago. Caught 3, 28 inch plus fish. I now go to Lac Seul Chamberlan Narrows and catch more fish per day (50-70) and an occasional 27-30 inch fish for about half the price. However your chance of a trophy 30 inch fish is a little better at Gunisao"
514287,stewart,2001-09-20 11:56:00,100,"I've actually guided there for the last three years. It is an awesome walleye lake. A lot of trophies are never registered so the Manitoba trophy book doesn't even come close to showing all the fish caught there (the biggest one in 2000 was actually 34"").I don't get paid to advertise the lodge, so I'll try to tell it as is. In May the fish are shallow(5-6') in a big bay called walleye hole. If your lucky and really early the fish will still be in the creek. Most of the fishing consists of trolling/drifting with lindy rigs. Jigs work, and cranks can get hot at times. This is easy mostly no brainer fishing.Numbers and size, but this is still fishing and the lake can be streaky.In June the fish are still in walleye hole for a while, and the river at the other end of the lake begins to heat up. At some point the walleyes vacate the bay in droves, and the only exit of the bay is The Narrows. This spot gets red hot. One day three hundred fish, next day they are all gone. Time to head to O'Daniels Bay and the far Rapids. Going there simply extends the spring like fishing till about July. Casting crankbaits on rock piles in the main lake in the evening can be terrific at times. If you like to cast this is probably the best time. Late June/early July the main lake gets good(summer peak). Fishing can be tougher, but I love this time since to me it actually requires more thought to find the walleyes. Once you find them the average size of the fish can usually be better. July can actually actually be a good time if your only looking for trophies since you can target them specifically.Vertical jigging is the main approach. The reefs can be really good.Early August is kind of tough for this lake. Maybe the walleyes are chasing suspended baitfish? Not everything about this lake is completely figured out yet... The northern fishing is really good though, and the pike get bigger as the month grows older. The walleye fishing picks back up as the month goes on too. Keep in mind every year is different. In the 2000 season the lodge closed Aug 1st, but the walleyes had moved back into shallow bays after baitfish (7-8') at that time. Fishing was great.Do you have a shot at big walleyes? Definitely. Can you have a bad trip? Absolutely. You roll some pretty pricey dice. One trip you might catch no trophies, but the next you might get seven. The best time simply depends on too many things to say. My favourite is the O'Daniel bite, but who can say exactly when that will be? If you have any more questions feel free to ask."
