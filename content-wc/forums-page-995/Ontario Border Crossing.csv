515025,Guest,2001-09-18 10:27:00,0,We're heading to northern Ontario later this week. Does anyone have any new information on the borders? How long has the wait been? Is there a better time to cross? Do we need birth certificates or social security cards? Which is the best crossing for time? Fort Francis? Baudette? Pidgeon River? Any advice would be appreciated.

The US folks check under the hood, under the vehicle and thru the contents of the boat. We entered Canada on Tuesday the day of the terrorist attacks and on of our boats/vehicle were inspected that took about 15-20 minutes . We did not need anybirth certificates or social security cards either way. If you anyone under 18, you should have a birth certificate for them."
515027,Dave,2001-09-20 10:06:00,258,We came back thru Int'l Falls Wed Sept 19th about noon. It took abouta half hour. There were 2 agents at each post and they searched a fewbags. It took about 10 minutes. I'm pretty sure they know by now what to look for.

They gave it a thorough once over and checked under the bed and sent them on their way in about 15 minutes. Very polite and professional. They also crossed into Ontario at the Sioux on the 14th and the delay was similar, as was the inspection. Xplorer"
