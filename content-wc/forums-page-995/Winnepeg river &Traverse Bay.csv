514946,cranker,2001-09-14 20:01:00,7,"I would suggest that you have a number of different presentations on hand when fishing up in the Pine Falls area. I usually stick to Rapala crankbaits myself & my most successful colors have typically been the perch, blue black, clown, and fire tiger. Obviously, it all depends on the water clarity which I hear is clear, but could very well change. All of this is for the bay. For the river, find yourself a nice hump that jumps from 15ft. up to around 8ft. & hug it nice & tight! Or, try to find some nice rock structures petruding atop the water surface and drift all sides of it. I have heard that the water is moving pretty quick in the river so you'll need 1/2, 3/4, & 1 oz. jigs of various colors. I have normally used pink/luminous, fire tiger, & gold. I haven't heard to much on water temp., but air temps have been averaging 65 for the high & 44 for the low; so dress warm. Still pretty early for the fall run to begin!If you need any bait, tackle, or info. I would reccomend that you stop of at Pro Am Tackle and ask for Boris. It is on Nairn Ave in Winnipeg. I hope that this is of some help to you. I am headed up there October 4th-7th! Please keep all of us posted on how you did up there & remember to crimp your barbs down! The law demands barbless hooks! Not sure how much the fine costs, but a crankbait could get spendy!"
514948,Guest,2001-09-15 05:33:00,0,"I too will be heading to the walleye wonderland soon. Last year many ""greenbacks"" moved in early. With the higher current, I tend to beleive it will be a little earlier this year as well. My hopes are that those da mn nets are out when I arrive. I am not so much against them doing that because it is legal but it does interfere with those of us trying to catch fish out of a boat. There is alot more of us boat fisherman who spend a lot more money than a few who net the eyes.Could one of you early Greenback fisherman report on conditions? I will be there in 2 weeks and am getting a little excited. My favorite time of year."
514947,Guest,2001-09-15 08:39:00,0,"Thanks for the info. I will be back on the 27th and I will let you know what worked and what didn't. The last I heard is that the water temp on Sept 10th was 66.4 degrees and that the water was high. Reports are that some of the green backs are in from the big lake, but no numbers."
514949,Guest,2001-09-15 19:35:00,0,"Just got home from Traverse Bay an hour ago and fishing is slow slow and slower. Jigged the river mouth, the Bay and the river all day for 4 small walleye. My partner never landed one. Biggest was about 19 inches. Friends trolling around us were skunked as of noon.I live in Winnipeg so it is a 2 hr drive for me but I'll wait probably two more weeks brefore I try it again.Never checked the water temp but it is warm and current is fast.Not many boats out yet.Good luck all and see you on the water."
514950,Guest,2001-09-17 08:09:00,0,Fished Traverse Bay yesterday when the winds permitted. Filled the well with nice 20 inch greenbacks cranking way past the rock pile on the flats. Only one of size was a 5lber which we released back into the lake. As another posting indicated.....it is still too early. Jigging the river produced a couple of little walleyes and the odd silver bass. River current is still fast but the water level has dropped about 2 feet in the last two weeks.Yesterday it was #8 Clown colored Rapalas.
514951,Guest,2001-09-18 08:44:00,0,"Gerry,Can you recommend any other lakes in the area that might be an alternate. We are staying at Drifters in Lac du Bonnet. We are probably going to visit Stu McCay at Cats on the Red if the Cats are still bitting, but may be looking for something a little closer to our Motel. Any info would be greatly appreciated.Harty"
514952,Guest,2001-09-18 10:17:00,0,"I heard from other fisherman that the Red River a couple miles north of Selkirk (around Netley Creek) was producing lots of greenbacks on Sunday, but nothing of any size. Jigging with fresh frozen minnows was the preferred approach down there. At the locks (ie. Lockport) another contact of mine indicated they were only boating saugers.On the September 8/9 weekend we stayed at a friends cabin on Lac Du Bonnet close to the McCarthur Falls Dam. We caught a lot of nice eaters jigging salted minnows.(Lime Green Jigs had the best success). Most spots were 18-20 feet deep.Best locations were in amongst the series of islands that are located between the main lake and the dam. Note on Lac Du Bonnet the keepers must be less than or equal to 15 inches. Nice sandwich size fillets."
