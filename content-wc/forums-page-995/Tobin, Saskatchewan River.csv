515036,Bradnd,2001-09-22 19:29:00,507,"Hello Mike, We got back from Tobin Wed. Weather was beautiful but the fishing was tough. Biggest fish released was 7 lbs. Quite a few small eyes & sauger, but no big ones. The wardens that stopped by us said noone else was getting any big fish either. The river bottom is still full of weeds. We pulled cranks 1 day, as soon as you hit bottom, they were weeded up! Resorted to drifting lindys after that. Still had trouble with moss & weeds. The water temp was 64 degrees, so it should only get better. Remember the slot has increased from 28 inches to 31.5 inches. The bottom end is still the same. Was still nice to be there, even catching the small ones in tee shirt weather! Quite a change from past trips in mid to late Oct. Depending on weather, we may head back up later next month.Mike, let me know how you did when you get back.Take care,Brad"
