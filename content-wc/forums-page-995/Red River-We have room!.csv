515051,Guest,2001-09-20 14:49:00,0,Two of us have a room booked at Stu's (Cats On Th Red) the nites of October 6-9. Our companions in a second boat will not be able to make the trip and we are now looking for another boat (2-3 fisherman) to join us (there is plenty of room and it defrays expenses!). Anyone interested??
