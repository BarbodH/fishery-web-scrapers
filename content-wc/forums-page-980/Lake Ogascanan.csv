That camp is probably 4 years old. I'd guess it is 24' X 20' with sleeping accommodation for 8. Its probably 75 yards back from the waters edge. Beautiful sand beach - would probably be great for swimming during warm weather fishing. Wood stove for heat and outdoor toilet. Hand pump connected to sand point for lake water at sink was considered a poor arrangement (we always had sand in the water). Propane frig and stove were fine. Landing and launching can be very difficult in windy conditions (every day for 4 days for us in 2000).Northern outpost camp was new for 2001. And the Southern outpost camp is new for 2002. The other outpost camps as well as the main camp facilities are much older buildings. Others can probably provide more detail.

I'd suggest taking your own boat, Brad's are too small on this lake. The lake gets rough when the wind blows, which it did most of the week we were there, and it is hard to get out of it to fish. The south outpost was not there when I was, but the location on the map to my memory is rocky and was in the direct path of the wind and waves. My 2 cents worth."
