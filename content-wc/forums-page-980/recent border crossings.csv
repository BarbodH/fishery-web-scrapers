517133,NateW,2002-02-12 11:31:00,96,"My folks winter in Texas each year. Two years ago on the drive home they hit a road block that was set up looking for drugs. Of course they had nothing to hide and were happy to oblige the US officer. While searching my folk's fifth wheeeler, they got to talking to the agent as he was conducting his search. The officer told them about one couple that he had searched a week or so previously. He took the dog through this couple's RV and the dog went nuts next to the fridge. He opened the fridge and found a boxed birthday cake that had been maticulously decorated. The dog continues to flip out at the scent of the cake. This is a well trained dog and the officer knows he's gonna catch #####, but trusting the dog he cuts into the cake that obviously took somebody a long time to decorate. The inside of the cake is solid crack coccaine. The couple was supplementing their retirement with a few ""harmless"" deliveries.I'm going to d\stay out of this debate completely. I just thought you'd enjoy the story. Don't know if the agent was US fibbing to my folks or not, but I have to believe the agents on the borders--both US and Canada, have about seen it all!"
517132,NateW,2002-02-12 11:35:00,96,"Couldn't have said it better, TGG! I've been checked at the border, at cooler-inspecting roadblocks and on the lake. We've always been polite and cooperative and have always been treated with respect in return. I have seen some guys act like jerks and been given their own medicine in return. Coincidence? I doubt it."
517134,Guest,2002-02-12 12:27:00,0,i think youve said it all.
517135,Guest,2002-02-13 06:35:00,0,yeah but did the driver have a dui on his record! you have some interesting viewpoints...dui=drug smuggler. what does to many speeding tickets = arsonist? good thing you have a government that thinks for you!
517137,Guest,2002-02-13 09:30:00,0,Does everyone that crosses the Canadian border have to present a picture id or only if the officer request it?
517138,Guest,2002-02-13 10:05:00,0,Only if the officer requests it.
517136,NateW,2002-02-13 11:08:00,96,"I'm not trying to draw any paralells here between DUI and anything. I am merely using the above as an example of how law enforcement officers on both sides of the border have seen it all. How you could draw any relation from that to a DUI is beyond me. I will say this however, that if you have such a huge problem with the way Canadians pass and enforce their laws, you can do one of three things: A.) move to Canada, become a Canadian citizen and spend the rest of your life trying to change Canadian laws (But then you'd have to REGISTER to vote, wouldn't you?); B.) Take your fishing trips elsewhere and leave those us who enjoy Canada and Canadians alone; or C.) Accept the fact that you're in a foreign country as a guest and like it or not they can do whatever they heck they want and get it over it already.For you, I would strongly suggest B or C. I don't think you'll get too much support trying to accomplish A."
517139,Guest,2002-02-20 22:49:00,0,"I crossed 2/14 and returned 2/19. No problem's at all and no lines. Custom person was friendly, asked a few questions and I was on my way."

517123,Guest,2002-02-12 05:17:00,0,"You are all forgetting that I was in a sense the ""mediator"" of everyone flexing their country's pride muscles in the last thread. If it bothers you that much, then just don't read the thread, it's very simple. I'd like to hear from the people who actually know what they're talking about with regards to the border, not those who want to put down other country's laws and customs."
517124,Guest,2002-02-12 05:38:00,0,this guy's a troublemaker. he's got a beef. let him stew in it. not stew us.
517125,Backwater Eddy,2002-02-12 06:25:00,3871,Friends went through on the ND/MB Pembina crossing this weekend.Both directions and at different crossing times similar precautions were observed equally. The border personal were courteous and efficient. ID checks on all passengers as well as a look through of the vehicle is to be expected.Know the rules and have required documentation ready and the process is no more hassle then getting on a airplane.

517126,Guest,2002-02-12 07:55:00,0,"Thanks for the post Eddy.People on the last thread were saying some pretty horrible things about the new border policies. I have never seen or heard of such things, and was only looking for truth in their claims. I am not looking to stir up anymore trouble from the last thread and feel as though people already think that of me when they see my name without reading what I write on this thread. I can't get one descent response from someone who ""knows"" without getting three posts bashing me for whatever reason. It's not worth my time anymore. I wish you all luck in the upcoming spring and summer.157"
517127,Guest,2002-02-12 07:59:00,0,been waiting for someone to start helping to shut this nonsense down. well done eddy
517128,srj,2002-02-12 09:45:00,971,"I'm puzzled why you got any bashing here. Not warranted. Crossing the border has changed and we need to accept it. I cross quite a few times each year and will travel a bit differently now--just the ID check and a cursory vehicle inspection can potentially add hours to the crossing when the summer tourist season is in full swing. Saturdays in the past have seen long waits at many crossings-the wait will probably be longer now. It is still an awesome privelige to be able to enter a foreign country teeming with fish and game and scenery to soothe the soul. The reasons for increased security are obvious. If this forum/subject can help anyone get across the border rather than getting turned back, it has been a worthwhile thread. Be prepared, do what is asked and enjoy yourself."
517129,Guest,2002-02-12 09:47:00,0,"I think that the bottom line to crossing the border is this:1. If you have a DWI or other criminal convictions then apply for a permit from Canadian Immigration then you can go legally. 2. We US citizens are visitors. We are not citizens of Canada and we must be willing to follow their guidelines. Canadian customs must be increasingly concerned about who is traveling to thier country because of the increased chance of terrorism. 3. Canadians have the right to apply their laws and national values to all visitors. They don't want drugs or drug users in their country. They don't want items that may cause enviromental harm. They want us to pay the duty tax when duty is due. 4. As an American citizen I have a choice. I can freely travel anywhere I want in our 50 states. When I want to travel to another country then I must be willing to comply with what that country requires. Canada has the most liberal entrance requirements for US citizens of any country that we can travel to. So if you don't want to have your vehicle searched. Don't want to show an ID. Don't want to answer questions. You have a choice. TGGPS: I have the good fortune of living close to I-Falls & Fort Francis. I frequently travel across the border to fish both summer and winter. I have had my vehicle searched, had to show an ID, had one of my buddies denied entrance because of a DWI, and answered lots of questions. I must say that I have always been treated with respect and professionalism."
517130,Guest,2002-02-12 10:31:00,0,amen . courtesy and honesty and you'll get through and if you don't get thru don't return. it's simple. all this stuff on here is probably an attempt to hurt trade. maybe it'll take longer to cross. so what. a hour or two isnt going to hurt anyone! if the price we pay for freedom and security is to let these guys do their jobs...so be it! bring along a good book! dui's are not terrorists and the border guys on both sides know it!
517131,Guest,2002-02-12 11:20:00,0,well said...
517112,phidelt157,2002-02-11 12:07:00,191,"I'm not trying to start anything up again (217 posts), but I'd like to hear if all this hoopla about the border is true. If anyone has recently crossed (two months ago or so, for whatever reason) I'd like to know if they checked you as thoroughly as it has been stated. Thanks in advance for the input.157"
517113,David/MN,2002-02-11 13:49:00,249,"I think the right answer here is, could be. I travel through International Falls to Fort Frances at least twice a month. I have nothing to hide, and declare anything I am bringing in (it's not worth messing with my privledge to enter Canada). I have not been asked for ID, I have been asked for, and have shown ID that they have not entered into a computer, and I have shown ID that they have entered into the computer. No pattern, just what they feel they need to do based on the situation.Before Sept 11th I had never been asked for ID, So I guess that is the only change I have seen.Everyone's just doing their job, and we get to visit a great country!dw"
517114,Guest,2002-02-11 14:48:00,0,gee...ya think you're not trying to bring up all this hoopla again? enough. we and the canadians will get along just fine. and we'll work this dui thing too...as we will you...so move along....find something else or someone else to bother.....
517115,phidelt157,2002-02-11 16:17:00,191,"Easy big guy...After the last 217 posts it seemed as though no one was getting into the country, I was just trying to see what kind of truth was behind it. I haven't crossed recently and wanted to see if what people ""thought"" was true, post 9/11. I was only asking the people who have crossed and really know if all the fuss is something to be concerned with, that's all."
517116,Guest,2002-02-11 16:55:00,0,"We went through I.Falls last week . First had to provide photo i.d. to immigration , they ran all six of us through the computer . Then onto the total tear down ,everything out of the Tahoe , uncover the snowmobiles etc . We had nothing to hide of course . Now the clincher , had a one pound package of hamburger in a zip lock and they took it inside and cut it into 4 pcs. who knows !! We are not the type of group that looks suspicious , at least I think we don't . Anyway , after about a hour and a half we were on our way . I do need to add though that it must have been the day as at least 6 or 7 of the vehicles with snowmobiles in tow received nearly the same treatment , but I don't know about the extent of their tear down as we were first in line . I do need to add also that the Tahoe crosses into Canada many times a year and my record is spotless . Must have been a random day for inspections , who knows ??? None the less I am not discouraged by this treatment , as we were completely legal with nothing to hide ."

More ?? than we'd ever heard in 30 yrs. ofcrossing several times a year. Nothing to hide so let em ask, can't be too careful."
