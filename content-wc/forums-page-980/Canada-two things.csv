517424,old fisherman,2002-02-19 17:43:00,545,Has anybody been to Andy Myers' Lodge at Vermillion Bay. Does Helliars in Nestor Falls have a web page? Thanks

Good food, comfortabe lodging.If your looking for a secluded Canadian you might want to look somewere else, as the lodges get crowded, but once on the water, you can find your own peace and quiet. Its a huge lake.Good luck in your search.<{{}}><"
