Won't be heading up till the walleye opener in May, is that a busy time at the crossing?. Also has the ""Flame"" been rebuilt, heard it burned down or something.... Thanks for the help... SWeed"
516845,bphunger,2002-02-01 07:41:00,28,"Sweed,The boarder crossing into Canada and back into the States, is requesting photo ID. You may or may not be asked. And it may apply to all people in the vehicle. We have a camp in Canada and are keeping up to date on the regulations so we can inform our guests. The idea is to prove citizenship. A drivers license does NOT prove citizenship but is being accepted. We STRONGLY suggest you bring a copy of your birth certificate along and for all members of your party. It makes it easier for the customs officer (both Canada and the U.S.) and helps to eliminate problems. Being polite and truthfull is best. Also, note that there is a new office on the Canadian side with 4 lanes for inspection so things will be faster. Have a good trip."

516848,Guest,2002-02-01 14:15:00,0,"I just went through 3 weeks ago. They checked out drivers licenses. My buddy had a DWI 11 years ago and they wouldn't let him in. They waved the other vehicle in our party right through with just the usual questions. There is a big thread regarding this issue located in the Canada section of WC. A drivers license will get you through if you have a clean record. Otherwise, you must obtain a certificate of rehabilitation from the Canadian Govt. TGG"
516849,rainy,2002-02-17 22:43:00,21,eh sweed dont know what you need for I.D. to cross border but the flame is gone and there is a micky dees in its place sorry for the bad news
516850,Guest,2002-02-18 06:23:00,0,Ah the Flame.......Went there a number of years ago. Once was enough. The local boys were a little unsettled between shows.....started fighting.......Police came.....they got to spend the night in the local jail. The bartender gave everyone in the place a free round to make up for the chairs and such flying around. Apparently some innocents had their drinks spilled. The boys were expelled for a week.
516846,Guest,2002-02-18 08:52:00,0,We will be crossing at the Falls the end of Aug. Being from Cent WI we will spend the night and cross the next morning. Would it be advisable to get up real early. like maybe 4:00 and cross then to beat the traffic? What would be the best plan? Thanks.
516851,Guest,2002-02-19 09:24:00,0,"Eh, Just answer the questions honestly and let the chips fall where they may. I bet the average car that is pulled over randomly is is less than 1 in 10. Its more like 1 or 2 for every 100 other wise it would be a heck of alot longer to get through. I no times have changed since last sept but just because a guy had one to many beers when he was younger and got behind the wheel dosen't mean your a terrorist and i think they the border patrol understand that. So have a good trip and dont let it stop you in a enjoyable fishing trip of a life time."
