517323,Guest,2002-02-19 10:21:00,0,"I make my own rod holders using a 4"" piece of 2x4, 2 4"" screws and 14' of PVC pipe. I then use a C-clamp to clamp them on to the inside of the hull. I have pulled in-line boards with them and they work fine, just check the tightness of the clamp screws, especially if you keep them on when you are trailering the boat. The c-clamps are the most expensive part and can be used for other things. I like to mount my tranducer on a 1x2 strip and then clamp it on to the transom. It won't fly off like the portable transducer suction cups do when you are running on plane. Rental boats tend to have too much algae built up on them for the suction cups to work properly."

Most times, providing outfitter equipment is acceptable, we opt to use the outfitters equipment rather than trailer in our own. Consequently, my requirement is similar to yours.Last year, I purchased the Down-East Salty Rod Holder (S-10). You can look them up at http://www.down-east.comI have tried other cheaper rod holders and was not satisfied. I am completely satisfied with the sturdiness and ease of use of the S-10.There may others as good but you can't go wrong with an S-10. Just my 2 cents."
