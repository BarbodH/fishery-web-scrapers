516282,Guest,2002-02-13 00:12:00,0,"Hum, good question. Can only speculate as to why BayView & Rough Rock are for sale. I'm thinking Brian @ Bayview is looking to really retire this time. Kids are married & gone...so he & the wife are slugging it out alone. Just pure speculation on my part. As for Rough Rock, no idea there. Since Black Bear Portage Camp closed the lake hasn't seen too much action. I would think (again speculation) that it is a tough sell to the consumer. That boat ride / cost etc. can be a tough sell when you can stay right in Minaki for the fraction of the cost (?) Granted you may not get the same great service (meals etc.) and have to cook for yourselves (most people eat walleye everyday - which they want to) But being so far away you miss out on the exciting night life in beautiful downtown Minaki ;-}ANYWAYS...... I knew of a plan of Duane & (another guy who shall remain nameless) to purchase the lodge & all it's properties. They had some great ideas but were unable to work out a deal with the CLOWN who owned the lodge. They were SO close, but yet so far......As a *booby* prize, Dick did aquire Holst Point (the most prized piece of Minaki property) He (from what I understand) plans to do some cabins, Rv area & possibly some tenting area. He will not ""over develop"" the area. He knows & respects the area. Heck, he was in Minaki before he was even born ! So he now controls all 3 boat launchs in the area, has tons of property & (as I call him) become the official ""Dick Trump"" of Minaki. Wonder if the ""Donald"" approves of him doing this ? hehehehehe. IF you did however want to launch a boat without going into Dick's world, there is a launch on Pistol lake (access from the highway) tons of parking etc.I am sorry to hear about the ""timeshare"" thing, but not surprized.I persoanlly wouldn't spend 25cents on one of them so-called ""condos""UGLY & have no place in God's country. I will however let you all in on a secret (promise not to tell anyone ? )As you all know, the railway has a presence in the town. The railway has alot of property that they still to this day own. I have heard a RUMOUR that they will be looking @ dumping most of their holdings. The RUMOUR is that the lots will be going far below ""market value""The price I have heard is around the $5000.00cdn mark Now, no idea if purchase will be restricted to ""canucks"" only, but I'm positive if it were the case, I know that I can be ""bought"" in exchange for getting y'all property. hehehehehe Again, this is a rumour (my source is fairly reliable) One drawback..... not lake front property.As for the nets, I have seen them in the past years. The first time I seen them was about 8 years ago in the winter. I have since seen them on the river in ""soft"" water, near The Dalles. One particular year, seen 2 guys pulling nets into small boat.....the net was so heavy with fish that I really thought (and was hoping) that their frigging boat sank. BUT, they do however have the ""right"" to fish. I don't want to drag this into another attack on anybody, but GEE WIZZ.......No family I know can eat that much fish (even in a year)Just one note to y'all, nets are also now out on the system during the summer. I have personally met the guy who owns the nets & he assures me that ALL he is fishing for is white fish.As for the 40 minute trip from Minaki to WhiteDog.... I honestly cannot remember the time it took to get to WhiteDog, BUT it only takes me 20 mins to get from the Kenora bypass to Minaki. So I guess Johnny46Skidoos can vouch that it would therefore only be 40 minutes to Whitedog from Minaki. (but then again riding a skidoo can warp your brain)Good FishenRob"

516358,Guest,2002-02-15 20:49:00,0,WpgRiverdude I sure enjoy hearing all your stories about Minaki. We have been going there for 25 years and would'nt think about going any where else. We stayed at Rosies until she sold to Duane then we moved to Fergies. They are real nice and never bother you til payday. Some of the best Walleye fishing we had was just down from Big North in the narrows before going towards throat rapids. How about some areas where you all have had good luck in the past. Can't wait till June to get back up there.

My wife and I have been staying at Bayview since the first year Bryan and Kay bought it. We have stayed there once and sometimes twice a year since. We know a little about Bayview warts and all. The good things far outweigh the bad. We have a little experience in these matters as through the years we have stayed at resorts on Leech, Mille Lacs, LOW, Lac Suel,a a couple in Manitoba and a couple more in Minnesota. We know what we like and we like Bayview and Bryan and Kay. We go the housekeeping route so we can't address the American Plan. For us to be happy all we need is a clean, well supplied cabin, decent facilities, good fishing, and a cordial, fair, and helpful host. This is Bayview.The Bryan I know took the grandchild of a guest, who had an allergic reaction to a bee sting, to the Kenora hospital and stayed until midnight with him to make sure he was all right. The Bryan I know took my pickup that on the trip up on those smooth Canadian roads nearly had the bumper tore off and had it welded while I went fishing. I don't know this guy you're talking about. I wish I knew more guys like the one I know. I hope the story I hear about it being for sale aren't true."

516273,Guest,2002-02-11 00:47:00,0,"Minaki update: The Lodge has been SOLD ! Last weekend apparently there was a item in local papers about it, BUT of course I was out in Minaki so I havn't seen it. The real estate listing on the web says ""offer approved"", so I can only assume that it is a done deal. One person I spoke to claims that artical stated that the new owner was looking at some sorta ""condo"" set-up, no idea what that means. I understand that $25,000.00cdn is a starting point for the purchase of a condo unit. I am trying to track down more info, so I'll keep y'all posted. ANYWAYS, last weekend out was fantastic. Great riding conditions & the trails are wonderful. Found some trails north of Big Sand & ended up in God knows where. Sure is a lot of lakes so close to Big Sand. Also ended up on Rough Rock, great ride in. Did have some concerns on ice conditions, but after speaking to Rob Bennett he pointed me in the right direction. We left right from Paradise Cove 1, followed his trail (mostly) out towards Big Sand. Big ice ridge by Dynamite Island (little island just after you leave Duanes place)After following Rob's trail, noticed by Gull Island that he headed towards Little Sand..... me being unconcerned with current @ this point could not understand why he headed off in that direction. I understand now....... I personally didn't notice anything during the ride, but the guy behind me claims that I had broken thru the ice as we passed Gull Island. Thank God for going 80 mph. My partner managed to ""side step"" my trail blazing and after we stopped at the cabin he informed me that I had left about a 30ft patch of open water..(he then needed to change his shorts...) All in all it was a great time & it was just great to get out into Gods country. ONE very disturbing thing was the commercial nets that I had seen out on the lake. Most of the nets were on the east side of Harbour Island, just south of the Sugar Loaf. Also noticed nets between Big/ Little Sand near Deadmans Island / Bay and the between Deadmans Island & Whiskey Island. I have heard from fairly reliable people that all they fish for is white fish, but nonetheless nets still concern me. You can't tell me that a net knows the difference between a whitefish or a walleye. YAH, I know the size of net etc etc etc , but still don't like to see any nets out on the lake & given the abuse I have witnessed on the river during the spring, I trust no one.The road up to to Lodge was plowed so some activity has been going on there. Everything else was shutdown tight. BayRidge store open, empty but open. Rode around the lake & looked at cabins etc, all looks fine with them. Doesn't appear to be much activity near any of the cabins. So those of you with property, everything is ok. Water/ice level appears to be back to normal....so hopefully water levels for next year are ""normal"". Well, as soon as I can get more info on the lodge, I will post it.AS for the drive from Minaki to Whitedog dam.......... I recall that it was about 40 mins. That was of course when the road was gravel. Now paved so it maybe a minute or 2 quicker.........Good FishenRob"

The real estate listing on the web says ""offer approved"", so I can only assume that it is a done deal.

516271,Guest,2002-01-26 07:23:00,0,Direction of the river has nothing to do with it. Up or down is simply with (down) or against (up) the current.

516272,Guest,2002-01-28 19:58:00,0,"I'm looking for suggestions as to where to go and what to use in the Minaki area in early September. Last year was not as productive for us as it was a couple of years ago. We usually fish spinner/minnow rigs on bottom bouncers in 30 to 50+ feet of water up around split rock/burnt island/green island, and lower area of Big Sand. Last year mostly sauger although some good walleyes."

516261,Reels,2002-02-02 09:38:00,2876,"Well, I guess I'm most curious about the fish movement thoughout the year. If anyone has it down via water temp, time of year, etc.Also, do you think the town will over come back to life? Whats the local scuttlebut?Thanks,Reels.<{{}}><"
516253,DonC,2002-01-20 21:42:00,93,"Minnow, in June you might catch crappie in 15 ft or so. I have also caught some in late June in 8-10 ft. The better time is late May. They are in 2-3 ft then. Some use a minnow on a bobber. I use 1/16 jig with a 2 inch grub on 6 lb test, tight lined. There is alot of bit offs from pike. You will also catch perch, walleye, and good size smallmouth with this setup, not to mention pike while trying to catch crappie. I fish large bays near the back, near floating bogs with a slow swimming retrieve. Good luck, Don"

516250,Guest,2002-01-16 01:08:00,0,It's that time of year again. Getting really bored & developing cabin fever. This board only seems interested in getting across the border & dui's. Anybody have any good Minaki stories or questions ? I'd love to hear them stories.... how did you do last year etc ! WrD
516251,DonC,2002-01-16 04:21:00,93,Had a great year. Up there in May and June. Smallmouth fishing was excellent. Went crappie fishing and had good success also. My brothers had success muskie fishing. One of the other guys in our party caught a 31 inch walleye. We caught several walleye in the upper 20 inch range. Will be back this May and probably September. We stay at Birch Island Resort.Don
516254,Nitecrawler,2002-01-16 18:28:00,52,"Minaki, We stay at Barber's, took a year but now we stay two week's!Last year was great as always, My Wife nailed a 56 inch Musky while we were throwingSpinner baits at the smalljaws ( go figure)? I did land a couple but it seemed like all theyWanted to do was follow? Wally was great again. We just love trolling Big Sand, when the Cisco'sCome up in the evening, WOW! Pike was good to. I'm just going nuts thinking about being there.Had a bear in camp to, thought I lost one of the dogs. Video'ed feeding the Eagle's, everybodyLoved that. Can't wait!!!!"
516255,Reels,2002-01-16 19:51:00,2876,"Peter shot a bear outside our cabin while the wife was cooking a lasagna and I was in the fish house cleaning fish. Walleye fishing was good, June and August, but not as great as we have had in the past. It all has to do with timing. I will say, the fish do seem to be getting bigger. Must of had a good year a few years back. It was hard catching fish under 18"" for shore lunch.We love it up there, and this will be the 13th year. Cant wait to get back!<{{}}><"
