Do you like to fish for anything else other than walleyes? Etc....... let us know and we can help. good luck I think it's great that you spend that time with your grandson.

They have outposts on may lakes. I would suggest if you can go to a sport show where you can talk to people in person.>Please be more specific as to what you are looking for and >we can help.
