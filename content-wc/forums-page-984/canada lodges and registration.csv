He is almost 100% booked for 2002, but give him a call, sometimes there are cancelations, and he is thinking about building a few more cabins this year. I believe he has 8 now. They are all well spaced, and you cant see another cabin from yours.Peter Barber807-244-6411If you give him a call, Tell him Ron Schaefer says hi. You can e-mail me if you have any questions.[email protected]<{{}}><"
516728,Trophymuskie,2002-02-02 11:00:00,254,You take any post or reply for what it is. If you see and unregistered user then take what he is saying with a grain of salt as if he needs to hide nothing he has to say can be that acurate or true. I actualy won't reply to anon users questions for the same reason.Why should I waste my time replying to someone to lazy to register or needing to hide. There also are times that guys don't want to reply to the public and would do it by e-mail.Keep releasing them allRichard Collinhttp://www.trophymuskiecharters.com
516729,Reels,2002-02-02 11:07:00,2876,"Try not to judge it based on that. When I post from work, I come up as a guest due to the firewall. Not much I can do about it. Im sure other people are in the same boat. Just FYI, just because they show up as guest, does not mean they are lazy, and even though Im registered, Im pretty darn lazy....Tight Lines,Ron<{{}}><"

516733,Buddy13,2002-02-02 15:53:00,17,"I agree, anyone who makes a statement about a lodge (good or bad) should have the courage to post their email address. One should be very careful about making negative comments as your are messing with a family's livelihood here. Then again, telling the truth and signing your name to it sounds reasonable to me.I think asking for references from a lodge owner is appropriate.The Ministry of Natural Resources office closest to the lake you are going should have knowledge as the quality of the fishery, the species, and size ranges. Call them up.Phil"
516731,BD,2002-02-02 16:12:00,739,Then if I don't want your attention I will not register on that particular post. To bad you feel the way you do. You are missing a lot of interesting stuff. In my first reply above I did not mention the resort name but I was refering to a lodge that had been getting bad press on the board for quite a while. Then wonder of wonders it got a bunch of great press all at once from id's that had not posted before. What would you think?
516732,BD,2002-02-02 16:23:00,739,Oh Yeh; Sometimes I'm in a hurry and forget to login!
516717,sdyer,2002-01-29 17:38:00,34,"All,i would like to make a request on this board. If anyone is going to make a reccomendation of lodge or lake to fish I ask that they become registered posters on this board or include their e-mail address for questions. The reason I am asking this I think lodge owners are replying back to posters looking for lodge reccomdations under an alias name and giving ficticiuos reports. This kills the purpose of this great board. I am the first to reccomend the place I go to to anyone who posts and is looking for the type of place I go to because i think it's the best thing since slice bread. But thats an honest fisherman's perspective. I keep hearing about one lodge inpiticular that gets the best reviews and not a single mention of anything bad. We all know that the greatest lodge in the world is not perfect but this place seems to be. In addition I have seen posts from the owner of this lodge in the past so I know he reads this board regularly. This is dishonest. When someone asks for a non bias opinion on anything on this board I hope that they will get it. Is this just me or has anyone ever smelled some thing fishy;-) Good luck to all and ice out is only about 3.5 months away....hurrayDuffy"
516718,BD,2002-01-29 18:06:00,739,There are times when the air is filled with a rather fishy odor. Most of the guys are giving their true experiences though.
516719,Reels,2002-01-29 19:39:00,2876,"Heavy accusations. Care to mention who you have in mind or what lodge your talking about? I dissagree there isnt a perfect lodge. I hesitate to say were I go, due to the fact the guy is allways booked solid and has never attended an outdoor show. Granted, took me a long time to find the perfect lodge, but it is possible.Hey, might be a fun poll. What makes a perfect lodge, or what sucks about the lodge your at?Tight Lines,<{{}}><"

516721,Reels,2002-01-30 18:55:00,2876,"Sure, Barbers Resort up in Minaki. Peter Barber is probably the nicest man I ever met in my life. The cabins are some of the best I have ever stayed in, and he even has a Jacuzzi on the property!Now, what is one mans perfect is another mans #####...There is no bar,No American plan, you have to cook yourself.Nothing to buy there.Thats why I thought it would be cool to get other peoples opinion what makes a great resort.<{{}}><"

516727,bphunger,2002-02-01 07:53:00,28,"I am a lodge owner and read the message board ofter. If some one is interested in a place in Canada I only put in our web address. We are listed on the Fishing Explorer section of the WC site. By the way, I have tied the set the record straight on all the miss information on the DWI question and all I see is more misinformation on this message board. The regulations are changing for boarder crossings. Your camp owner should be able to help if you have a problem. And, as posted before, call the immigration office at the boarder crossing you will be using. Explain YOUR situation, if you have one, and get an accurate answer....."
