516738,Tracy,2002-01-31 20:38:00,376,"I have fished Savant Lake several times over the past 10 years. For Walleyes it is hard to be beat. 70-100 fish a day is average even in poor weather. Fish run 15-25"" an occasional 27-30"" er. our bigest was 31"" only weighed 8.5, guy in our party released a nothern over 50"" 3 trips ago. My big is 42"" 18.5 released. Lots of lake trout too. Wildewood is a great camp, and Richard is as nice a guy as you could meet. E-mail me if you have any questions,Tracy"

516740,docIN,2002-02-01 09:55:00,120,Have you ever fished any of the smaller lakes around this area?You are exactly right with the sizes.Nothing really big but a lot of great eaters.Thanks
516741,Tracy,2002-02-01 17:27:00,376,"I have only been to Wildewood in early June, 1st or 2nd week. I have not been to any of the other lakes in the area There is another lodge on Savant, but we rarely saw their boats in close to any of the places we fish. Not sure on the exact number of guests Wildewood can accomodate, I want to say 28, but I have never seen more than 24 on any trip I have been on. You can e-mail Richard from his web page; www.wildewoodflyin.com and get the details on that. Walleye Fishing is pretty incredible there and easy too! The bank on the left side of the camp bay about a half mile out can not be overlooked for easy pickens after dinner, or all day when the wind is high. Find the white rock on shore and you are in the fish!Tracy"
