516540,Guest,2002-01-23 16:10:00,0,"a group of 6 of us have booked a trip to Andersons Lodge, early June.I have read great things about the outposts and Lac Seul, but I'm wondering what to expect fishing out of the lodge (Sioux Lookout)Has anyone been to the lodge in early June?If so have you been able to catch nice walleyes in the local lakes?or will we have to take the long boat ride into the heart of Lac Seul?How long of a boat ride is it to get into the good fishing areas of Lac Seul? (Miles and time)I sent a letter to the lodge over a week ago asking these questions,w/ no reply.Is that typical of the service at Andersons?I can't wait to get there, first trip to the area, I can taste the shore lunches already."

516542,Jesse-WI,2002-01-23 21:24:00,534,They have responded to my email inquires very quicker. You might try that.
516543,Eye Guy,2002-01-23 21:33:00,40,I guess I should have said that I e-mailed a week or so ago...Is anyone able to help me with some info?
516544,Guest,2002-01-24 07:49:00,0,"Call Andersons and ask to speak to Jody. He is acting manager, and has guided the area for many, many years. He will put you on the fish where ever you choose to fish.All of the people at Anderson's have always gone out of thier way for any need you may have.I have fished the area from Anderson's lodge into Lac Suel for the past 20 years. You really should take the boat ride up, maybe 40 minutes to Lac Suel. You will not regret it."
516545,Eye Guy,2002-01-24 13:31:00,40,"Angle eye,Thanks for the reply, we have reserved guides for the first day. I do want to get up into Lac Seul, You say its about 40 min boat ride?Is that boating from the lodge, or being droped off at the private landing.Do you know roughly what the millage scale is on the Andersons map in their publication.Typicaly how many hours do you get a guide, I dont want to burn all the guide time on a boat ride."
516546,Guest,2002-01-24 15:02:00,0,"I have never stayed at Anderson's camp although they are quite nice. I have always gone to the outposts located on Lac Seul. I'm not sure of the map scale in the brochure, but it seems distorted. Your best bet is to stop in at the Department of Ministries and get topo maps of the area. Jody has a small map of the areas, but I don't find it very useful.Your best bet on fishing Lac Seul is with their guide for a day. I would not attempt to navigate from their landing to Lac Seul without one of their guides. I have a friend who camps quite close to Andersons, and they spend around an hour to get to Lac Seul by boat. He has fished the area for over 25 years, so he has the confidence to get where he wants. It can be very difficult to make it from the landing to Lac Seul unless you have a wealth of experience with the water levels, rocks, and general navigation. I would personally mark the route with a GPS, when the guide takes you up. Even then I would be very careful navigating the route.One thing that I would recommend, would be to spend a day fishing at the musky sanctuary. Check with Jody, I believe Anderson's has boats located on Little Vermillion, which can be taken back to the lake. I believe it is now referred to as Muskellunge lake. Anyway, it is catch and release only, mainly muskie. My brother and Father generally spend a day there and catch between 15 - 30 muskies between 10 and 20 pounds per day. The lake was a muskie sanctuary for many years closed to fishing. It re-opened catch and release only a couple of years ago. If the water level is low you may not be able to get back to it, again check with Jody. If you go, be ready for the Department of Ministry to drop in on you by float plane. They seem to always check whoever is fishing there, also NO BARBED HOOKS are allowed there. It can be an un-believable experience!Have fun, you can catch fish througout the area, but Lac Seul is second to none.Have fun!"
516547,eek,2002-01-31 00:26:00,72,"I am taking my first trip to Andersons this spring, will be there for the opening week of Walleye season. I have been to the area several times in the last several years. I am sure that to get to Lac Seul from Andersons, you will need to navigate a very narrow, shallow, rocky, tight passage to get there by boat. Andersons does keep a number of boats in Lac Seul to use there, but you will have to drive there to use them. If I were you, I would save up my nickles and take a fully guided package, with a guide for each day you will be there. I can tell you that the guide I have gone with for the times I have been up there, is worth every penny you are charged for, and a substantial tip to boot.Do not eliminate Lake Minnataki, Pelican Lake, or the Chute, all have been very productive for me in the past. Sometimes, even with GPS coordinates that worked last year, the pattern changes due to water conditions, temperature etc. and you could spend days, running and gunning and not get into the concentrations of fish that you would hope to find. These guides work together, and most fish 6 or 7 days a week, and by combining their experiance and that much time on the water, they can put you on fish almost every time. Another factor to consider is that up there, especially in Minnataki, it would be VERY easy to run aground on some the many reefs and shoals and just tear up the motor on your boat and really spend some money quick, and maybe even get hurt or worse. I followed our guide back and forth all over these lakes in my boat, and he virtually went in the same path across these huge bodies of water every time, according to my GPS, knowing full well where the shoals and reefs were NOT. In addition, the wealth of odd fishing lore and techniques were absolutely priceless. I pay my guide willingly, tip him well, and even sent him a Christmans present...He is well, well worth it.eek"
