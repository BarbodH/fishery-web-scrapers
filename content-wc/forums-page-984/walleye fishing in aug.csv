516466,Guest,2002-01-24 15:44:00,0,"Cedar or Perrault Lakes (they're connected) have always been great in August. Our biggest walleye last year was 34 inches, but larger ones have been caught. All the resorts except for Keystone fall within your price range, but they are not all created equal (read this to mean that I've had bad experiences at one of them, good at the rest). Most of the lodges are full, or almost full, due to the trophy walleye and musky fishing. Catches of well over 100 walleyes a day are not uncommon. The fishing is good enough that lodges on Eagle Lake, particularly Andy Meyers Lodge, trailer their boats and fish Cedar (which I think sucks, your lodge is on Eagle, fish Eagle!)"
516468,Guest,2002-01-25 05:43:00,0,Greg-Check out Holinshead Lake Outfitters located 2 hrs. north of Thunder Bay. You won't be dissapointed! You can e-mail me at [email protected].
516469,Guest,2002-01-30 14:45:00,0,"I think Jack fish is near Fort Frances more than Nestor falls, Jack fish is a chain of lakes that you can access through Clear Water Lake I hear that Pipestone is good and that is over the north portage out of clear water instead of the south portage of Clear Water to go to Jackfish. I have fished lakes connected with Jackfish but not Jackfish I hear it's OK!"
