The main reason for this is that the exchange rate is contantly changing and by charging in US dollars your clients who booked a trip for $1000 US dollars in the winter will cost them exacly that when they come in the summer. I would rather be the one having to exchange money and have it go up or down on me rather then my clients, that is customer service. You have to remember that a very high percentage of the guess are from south of the border and the lodge owners would hate to lose business just because their pricing is not clear.Keep releasing them allRichard Collinhttp://www.trophymuskiecharters.com"
516631,Guest,2002-01-26 18:10:00,0,"Hello, and as I have posted on many fishing message boards, I have an important question to be answered. Now, I realize, many people have many suggestions. My friends and I would like to plan a fishing trip of a life time, not just our regular weekend fishing excursions. We at first thought, hey, Manitoba is the place to go, but after many contacts and many disappointments ( of my own Country charging us American funds to fish in my own Country )just does not cut it. Don't get me wrong, we have the funds, we just don't want to pay the prices of a 2 week all inclusive trip to Cuba-deep sea fishing and come back and buy a second fishing boat with a second mortgage. So, if anyone has links/contacts to a Northern Ontario destination for a trip of a life time, please respond ( i.e Lake of the Woods, a fly in destination ) Thank you in advance."
516632,sdyer,2002-01-26 18:21:00,34,"jason,I have been going to way north lodge for the last 6 years and I love the place. It is a fly in out of red lake ontario. The 5 lakes that they fish are very close to the manitoba border. We catch many pike over 20lbs, walleyes up to 10 lbs. and lots of medium sized lake trout. I think it's as close to manitoba fishing as you can get in onatrio but it's half the cost of most manitoba fly ins. Feel free to e-mail me and i can send you some more info. and pics. from last years trip. I will be there this year from 6-6- to 6-14. I have reccomended this place to many on this board and most have been very pleased and have retruned for a second time. The website is www.waynorthlodge.ca. They do charge american funds but I am confident that you can work out a deal in canadian funds with the owner. Good luck with what ever you and let me if I can help.duffy"
516633,Guest,2002-01-26 20:27:00,0,"Besides catching tons of fish and a few trophies, what else did you have in mind ? How many are going ? Did you want a lodge atmosphere, remote outpost, drive in, did you NOT want to see any other people all week or do you need some assistance with guides, meals, etc ?lobo"

516635,Reels,2002-01-27 18:52:00,2876,"The resort we stay at just started US funds only. Kinda sad, and takes the fun out of going to a different country in a small way. At first I was kinda angry, but the more I look, it is hard to find a Canadian resort to take Canadian money. Good luck in your search, if you find a good place, let us know. Looking for something a little different.Tight Lines,<{{}}><"
516637,Guest,2002-01-27 19:51:00,0,It is a fact of life that 80% of Walleye caught in Northern Ontario are caught by Americans. The entire industry is set up on the American Dollar. Check out NOTO......they will have links to their member resorts. Good luck

516640,Guest,2002-01-30 14:50:00,0,"I've fished witrh Knobby's out of Sioux Lookout for 25 years or so. Excellent fly-in lakes on the Cat River chain, about an hour flight north. Newer planes the last couple years. New boat engines every year on 14-16 foot Lunds. Some of us think an engine that starts the first pull every time is worth what we pay. Burn all the gas you want. The main lodge at Bamaji has housekeeping available, otherwise you do everything yourself. Solar lights, flush toilet and hot water showers. Our favorite lake is Roadhouse, but all are fine for good pike and as many walleyes as you care to catch. There's an Ojibway village at Slate Falls on Bamaji. They usually leave you alone, but we've been asked for booze more than once. Never had anything stolen. If you want to get completely away from everyone, try Kezik, Fry or Devils Rapids. Roadhouse is below a series of rapids, excellent fishing 50 yards from the cabin. Indians will sometimes shoot the rapids, but not often. There is one cabin on an adjoining lake about 6 miles away, but we hardly ever see another fisherman there. All of Knobby's lakes have moving water, and usually one cabin per big lake. It's not cheap. About $850 US plus license. Take sleeping bags, food, drinks and tackle. Check out knobbys.on.ca or call toll free 1-800-668-3886 in the US, or 1-807-737-3291. And, no, there's nothing in it for me. I just enjoy the place and think others should, too. Good luck."
