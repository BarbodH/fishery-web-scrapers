516573,Guest,2002-02-01 07:03:00,0,Hello FlipWe have been fishing west of Manitouwadge and north of Terrace Bay and this will be the first time to the Pipestone.We have always fished lakes that were secluded with a degree of difficulty in reaching winch in a few places portage a canoe or inflatible that puts us on water where we are the only ones there.We set up a tent in the bush etc. ON the pipestone we probably will see other fisherman but for a one time event we will be alright with that to be that far north and see some new country it will be over 1000 miles for us to make the trip. A buddy who I fish with is going to our old area and is going in with an inflatable--he will be going thru a river lake system then overland into some unnamed lakes that we have found on the maps once he gets it scouted out I will go back in a couple of months.Bush camping and fishing is what we love no lodge no guides no other fisherman just solitude and great fishing we eat what we can and leave the rest don't bring any home. We regularly catch fish pike in the 40 inch size and eyes to eat.len

516564,BD,2002-01-24 16:19:00,739,I have been happy with 622. It's a nice drive.
516565,Fishoil,2002-01-25 11:16:00,1277,Is the road in good shape? Or is it potholes and construction like 502?
516566,BD,2002-01-25 17:32:00,739,There were some spots east of the Fort that were being patched. No construction on 622 last year and the road was in good shape.
516567,Guest,2002-01-25 19:51:00,0,"BD,Could you tell me how many miles (or kilometers) it is from Atikokan via Highway 622 to Highway 17? Also, how does Highway 622 compare to Highway 502 as far as hills and curves are concerned? If you could enlighten me on these questions, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.Jig'N'John"
516568,Guest,2002-01-27 15:51:00,0,Hello FISHOILI am going to Pickle Lake for the first time this spring--going to Horseshoe Lake have you fished that area???thankslenAlso when is the ice out on a normal year??
516569,Fishoil,2002-01-28 09:27:00,1277,"I'm going to a camp on Lake Pashkogogan; I've only been going there for 4 years now, so my experience with ice-out is somewhat limited. We always go the week of the opener (3rd Saturday in May), the camp owners tell me that they sometimes still have ice part of that week. So far we've been lucky, no ice. This camp is about 30 or 40 miles south of Pickle Lake, so if you're going to Pickle Lake or further north, I would consider waiting until at least the 4th Saturday in May. Good Luck"
516570,BD,2002-01-29 16:28:00,739,Curves and hills? There are the required number of those. Provincial government law demands a certain number per 100kms. ;) I don't know the milage but if I find my good map I will let you know.
516571,Guest,2002-01-29 17:23:00,0,"BD,Thank you for the information. I hear you about those curves and hills.Jig'N'John"
516572,Guest,2002-01-30 12:49:00,0,"Hey Len, Are you camping at one of those designated camping areas north of town. Have you done this before, if so how has it been. If not do you know anyone who has or how did you find out about this. This is something I've been thinking of trying, heard the fishing on the pipestone river system is second to non. If you can fill me in with any info I'd apreciate it. Make sure you post your results of this trip when you get back, I'll be waiting, thanks"
