516666,BD,2002-01-27 17:55:00,739,"ggg and I were both there this last year and I have friend that goes there regularly. Search the General Discussion, Canada, and Fishing Reports boards including the archives for past messages. After you get some background info I would be glad to answer any questions you may still have."
516667,Nette B,2002-01-27 18:55:00,39,"We are planning on taking our own boat, and camping at Press Lake Camp. I assume that you stayed there. How are the owners? How did the campsites look? Is there a public launch on the lake? What is the water clarity like? We have a small 14' boat, which does not handle the greatest in big waves, is there sheltered bays to fish? When did you go there, and what baits did you use? How deep is the lake/structure? Alot of questions....but you can never be too sure...ya know??? Thanks alotNette B"
516668,BD,2002-01-28 17:46:00,739,"We have allways used the housekeeping cabins but the campsites looked nice. There is no electricity or water to the sites but there is a shower / bath house nearby. Of the owners Barb is fantastic and Jerry can be a little gruff at times but has allways been helpfull. There is a launch at the camp and another by the burned down bridge. I take a 14' Lund Deep Fisherman with a 20hp Johnson and a buddy of mine uses a 16' Grumman with a 25hp Johnson. Unless there is a strong wind from the north blowing straight in, there is sheltered fishing near the camp. You can also trailer to the bridge (4WD recomended) if you don't want to go by water. The fishing at the camp is for northerns, walleyes, smallmouth and whitefish. The lake is part of the English River system and you will have lightly stained water similar to Winnebago. The structure varies from shallow to deep rocks and mud flats. I prefer to troll and the best baits this past fall were L&S Mirrolure jointed crankbaits, T-Stick jrs., and Fat Raps. Most of the walleyes were still deep (20 to 45 ft.) and a jig / minnow presentation was what was needed for them. If the eyes are deep a depth finder is a must. A good trolling motor or an anchor is needed to keep you on the structure where they are hanging. There is another camp, Finlayson Camp 113, that doesn't have a website. It's just a little north of Atikokan on Hwy. 622. It may also interest you. I'll see if I can find the contact info for you. There are several small to medium size lakes and the Seine River in the area along with the lake the camp is on. Everything from big eyes to lakers to musky and panfish will keep you busy there."
