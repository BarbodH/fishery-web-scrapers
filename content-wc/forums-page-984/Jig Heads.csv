516804,Fred_G,2002-01-31 05:56:00,908,I've found the round style works well for most everything.Fred
516805,Jigger1,2002-01-31 08:25:00,234,"I use round heads. Since I began power jigging with heavier jigs (3/8 Â– 1/2oz) in Canada, I started using heavier jigs on my Wisconsin trips and find the control greatly outweighs the finesse aspect of lighter jigs. My numbers have soared."
516809,Guest,2002-01-31 10:17:00,0,"I use what is called an asprin jig. It is round but has two flat sides to it. Foil eyes can be added to the flat sides. Paul Jenesen from Wisconsin makes great jigs. You can upgrade to better hooks, guaranteed no paint in the holes and very reasonably priced. His web site is [email protected]. Give him a try."

516811,Guest,2002-02-01 15:25:00,0,"I mostly use 1/4 oz. stand up jigs when fishing canadian shield lakes. With the eye in the front and a flat bottom, they slide over the cabbage weeds and when trollin or casting. (A tip picked up at a Spence Petros seminar 15 years ago.) Yea, they can get snagged if you let then sink to the bottom, but those rocky bottoms will eat any jig. Black jig with a yellow or chartruse (double) twister tail works for me."
516812,Guest,2002-02-01 15:59:00,0,"90% of the time I jig for walleyes 1/4 - 3/8 oz, actualy had my best results with a plain lead (no paint jig)and a minnow, no tail.Question...When you folks are talking about fishing jig's w/ tails, what kinda tail are you talking about?If you are fishing jig's w/ tails do you also use minnows?Sorry if this is a stupid question, thanks for the info."
516813,stewart,2002-02-01 18:00:00,100,"Usually a tail is something like a twister tail. Sometimes something more subtle like a fuzz e grub. A twister can make small minnows look bigger, slow the drop some, add color. If the minnow with twister doesn't produce I'll usually pinch the tail off, which just leaves the plastic chunk."
