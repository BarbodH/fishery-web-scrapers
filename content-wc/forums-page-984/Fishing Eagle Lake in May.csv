516126,Guest,2002-02-01 11:46:00,0,"BearWe've fish Eagle Lake the last few years and have had pretty good success. Mostly for Walleyes and Northern, a few Small Mouths and an occasional accidental Musky (45inch). The Walleyes are nice size but most of the Northerns are small. We mostly fish in water under 10 feet. 99% of the fishing is done by trolling or drifting along weed lines or open flats. They will bite on anything from crank baits to live bait, depending on the weather. If I had to bring one lure/presentation to Eagle Lake it would be the spinner and minnow combo. Trolling it or just dragging it on the bottom. Bring several poles rigged for different situations.Weather will vary in May - Two years ago we were fishing in T-shirts and last year it was cold and rained 5 out of our 7 days, but we still caught fish so we couldn't complain much. GPS is a good idea. We get lost on that lake at least once a trip. We have since bought a GPS. If you're going to a lodge, I would buy bait before you get there, it will be a lot cheaper and you'll get more minnows for the $.Good luckMaybe I'll see you up there. We just booked our trip on Eagle for May."

I assume I'll need a few setups to cover the diversity of fish and techniques?3) Clothing and other considerations. I don't know what the weather will be like in May but, I assume it will probably vary quite a bit. At minimum I'll need raingrear and layered clothing. Any suggestions for raingear, boots/shoes or fishing vest? Also, should I take my portable fish-finder and GPS? 4) Anything else the will make the trip more enjoyable?Thanks in advance,Bear"

The fishing was spotty. A few guys had some nice follows from HUGE musky, but no takers. We caught walleyes the first day, that's it. No smallmouth. There are a few portage lakes that were pretty good for small northern and walleyes. I do not know of anyone else that's fished Eagle Lake, maybe because of its reputation. The fishing may have improved since we fished it, but I would do A LOT of investigating before committing to a trip on Eagle."

516124,Guest,2002-01-07 16:50:00,0,"You will be fishing very shallow for the walleye, jig's with a minnow, some small crank baits, crank bait's & buzz baits and anything shiney and bright for the northerns, same with the smallies. you can use live bait also for them. That is the best time for lake trout here on the west arm, we use cow bells with a 6-8 "" sucker. Musky isn't open yet. Bring your winter clothes snow is not uncommon that time of year, it also can be warm. You need to bring appropriate tackle for the job. jim"

If you get one on, don't bring it into the boat for pictures or to get the hooks out! If the fish crosses the plane extending up from the side of the boat and the MNR sees it, you will get fined. Look up their definition of possession in the regs."
