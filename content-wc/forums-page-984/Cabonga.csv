Last year because of the lack of rain the réservoir level was very low. (We do not expect to be any better this season there's barely any snow).If you plan to go do it late spring or early summer.Bring alot of ""Deepwoods or Muskol lotion"""
516531,Guest,2002-01-30 14:40:00,0,i heard (dont know for sure) that cabonga was dammed and it greatly affected the fishing conditions. if youre looking for walleyes there are better spots.
