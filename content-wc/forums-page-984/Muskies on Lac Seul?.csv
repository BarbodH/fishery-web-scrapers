516921,Guest,2002-02-04 11:03:00,0,I think one of the better areas is the North East portion of the lake. The resort we have been to a number of times is at Chamberlin Narrows and is called Ojibway Outfitters. This is a boat in trip with the camp about 40 miles from the landing by Sioux Lookout. That is one of the reasons it is a better area as there is no drive in on that portion of the lake.
