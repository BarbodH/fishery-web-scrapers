516857,Guest,2002-02-02 07:47:00,0,"In June I'll be fishing out of Longbow Lake-thinking about venturing out into LOW. Anyone ever fish in the northern bays (Bigstone,Storm, Route or Thunder? Any special techniques? Walleyes mostly, but would like to find some Crappie also. I'm pretty much a novice so your help would really be appreciated. Thanks JJ"
516858,Guest,2002-02-02 15:00:00,0,"I have fished the northeast section which would be the 6212 hydrographic chart, the best map of the lake. Probably have 800 days on the lake over the last 5 years. Big Stone is good, and then moving south the area through Moore Bay and over to Slate and Gaherty are real good. The humps on the east side of Whiskey are great. Mainly use a bottom bouncer and spinner rig. The area south of the Barrier Islands is probably as good as any on the lake. Am expecting some software with a map reader which will give me GPS coordinates. When I get it I can give you some coordinates, should be a big help.[email protected]http://www.justfishontario.com"
