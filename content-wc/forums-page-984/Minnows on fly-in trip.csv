516677,Guest,2002-01-28 09:41:00,0,Last year we talked with people who took minnows on a fly-in and did very well with them. Any suggestions on taking them in as far as how to keep them all week. Should we take extra minnow bucket to keep some in. We have only taken leeches but after talking to these people we thought about minnows too.We have never had any trouble catching walleye with twister tails. These people said the same but after they took minnows the first time they wouldn't consider flying in again without them. What has been your experience?

Next, we dump them into a cooler and fill with lake water and ice - keep the water cool - as cold as you can. Bring the cooler in during the day - don't leave it in the sun. We run a battery operated aerator 24-7 and change out 2 or 3 gallons of water daily and add fresh ice each morning or as needed. This will keep most of them alive for 6 days at least. Skim out dead ones in the am and pm and feed the gulls. Do not fill minnow buckets and hang them off the dock- they will be dead in 2 days. Temperature is the factor. Someguys 'sink' minnow buckets beneath the thermocline with rocks. I prefer the cooler system."

You paid all the money to get the minnows in, don't toss the dead, you will do just as well them. Just keep em cold after they die.Tracy"
516680,Guest,2002-02-01 07:27:00,0,WW- Tracy makes a good point - dead minnows(halfs or whole) can be very effect. We will use the dead ones when they die while out on the water. In my earlier reference I meant to make the point of keeping the 'minnow cooler' free of dead ones as it tends to muck up the water. I know a lot of guys who salt/freeze dead minnows and have good results.

You need a snap on cover. At camp add a good sized rock to bottom of bucket add water, cover and tie to dock. Bring a long rope so the bucket gets down deep. Don't forget to acclimate minnows to the lake water temp by floating bag in lake water and gradually adding lake water to the bags. Buckets can be used to pack odds and ends."
