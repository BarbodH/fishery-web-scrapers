Que diriez-vous de toi juste faites-le et puis le signalez en arrière dessus ici avec combien l'amende coûtait du billet ! `Heureux de Fishin Walley or you could try this link http://education.mrnf.gouv.qc.ca/
1280917,Guest,2011-03-11 05:38:00,0,thanks I found what i was looking for A nonres. cant even sleep in your boat unless you have a camp permit
1279684,Guest,2011-03-08 15:16:00,0,can you camp for the nite on islands or would i have to sleep in boat would like to try fishing at nite? thanks
1279699,Northern Exposure,2011-03-08 15:45:00,29,"If you are a resident you could. A non-resident would legally have to buy a camping permit if the island was crown land, they are $10/day/person. Are you staying at a resort and just spending one night out? If you are camping you can only have a conservation lisense so I don't know how that would work if you were paying for the resort but camping anyway?"
1279745,Guest,2011-03-08 17:29:00,0,yes staying at a camp just wanted to spend one nite on a island can sleep in boat but nice to have acamp fire and sleep in tent.
1279837,Mondo_)H,2011-03-08 19:39:00,91,This is in Quebec and not Ontario...Correct?? are the laws the same in each provience?
1279967,ohiojmj,2011-03-09 05:48:00,1262,I thought that I read that a non-resident don't need an overnight camping permit if you have something rented that night. don't recall if ON or QC.
1280076,Guest,2011-03-09 08:56:00,0,yes in quebec it is crown land. thanks for any info.
1280192,Bill Krejca,2011-03-09 14:13:00,6107,"Man, if you are going to be camping in your boat, I'd suggest you do it either really early in the season, or mid-Sep or later. The bugs (especially mosquitoes) in most north woods environments can literally drove a person crazy once the breeze lets up in the evening. Bill"
1280229,keek,2011-03-09 15:51:00,1003,"Have you been there before? Most of the islands that I have seen there are pretty rocky around the shore-line and would make landing a boat challenging. Not that it couldn't be done, but I didn't see may nice sandy beach landings. It's a huge place so you might know of areas that I haven't even come close to seeing."
1280263,Mondo_)H,2011-03-09 16:54:00,91,"there are several sandy ""beach"" places on DeCelles, IF you know where to go, because it IS a large area.My question is....In Quebec, IF you want to just go out and camp at a lake in the bush, do you need a camping permit, I know you do in Ontario but what about Quebec?"
1280295,Guest,2011-03-09 17:40:00,0,yes ive been there every year for about 20 years. I know were sandy beaches are im aware of the bugs. just wanted to know if I could build a fire and sleep on an island in there. thanks.
