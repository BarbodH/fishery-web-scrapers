This year my brother and nephew are heading up with us, but will primarily be fishing for everything but musky. They would also be interested in crappie fishing. I have noticed the last several years that the watershed has been puting out some slab crappie. we will be up 7/2 - 7/9 this summer. Can anyone help me steer them in the right direction for smallies and crappie for that time of year. I know lots of my musky haunts are ideal smallie spots, but was looking for any other ideas you guys might have. Also, would a trip down the ord river during that time of year be a good day trip for them to have some fast action walleye fishing? Size really doesn't matter, just eaters is what they'd be interested in. thanks for any info."
