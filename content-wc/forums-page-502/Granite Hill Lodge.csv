The boats were almost spotless clean and full of gas every morning by the time I was ready to hit th water. I do not fish very much and was still able to catch a bunch of walleye. I did catch into some northern even though I wasn't fishing for them. John and Shannon are incredible host and it was easy to see they love what they do. I did stop in at Bingwood to look around while one afternoon, what a beautiful place. The cabins are awesome, and the location is great. I even saw John there the day I stopped in. I'm excited for my trip this year, as I am for sure going back."

We stay on the American plan and have never had a complaint. The boats motors ect. are all top-notch and accomodations are clean and comfortable. I would readily recommend them to anyone looking for a first class fly in operation."
1247433,Seanik,2010-11-07 10:16:00,218,"Hello, I would appreciate any information or feedback on Granite Hill Lodge, It's a fly-in lodge out of Hornepayne, Ontario. I did a search and info is very sparse. This would be a 2nd trip since we are booked at Expeditions North in early July. The group wants to drive once and do back to back fly ins at different lodges. We are all retired, it's on our bucket list. Thanks, Seanik"
1247886,Seanik,2010-11-09 10:19:00,218,I did gleen a bit more information from the Granite Hill Newsletter. Bingwood and Buck Cabins on Obakamiga Lake have been sold to 2 different new owners. Granite Hill Lodge on Granite Hill Lake was retained by the original owners. Any info on fishing these 2 lakes would be appreciated. Seanik

We used to run the boat over there and look around. Always felt it was the Ritz and we were staying at the Motel 6 . Never fished Granite Hill much, always had plenty in Obakamiga. One thing I miss is the perch. We would spend a day perch fishing and bring home our limit of 13"" perch. Best perch fishing I've ever seen."
1264153,Guest,2011-01-23 20:10:00,0,"Hello, I recently bought Buck Cabins, then through a partnership with the Terry family we also took over Bingwood. With 20 years experience in the buisness we are delighted to become owners. Lake Obakamiga is 7400 acres and loaded with bays, points and dropoffs. You can find shelter from rough water just about anywhere. Rarely will you have to stay off the lake due to high winds. The fishery has been looked after for 30 years. By placing a catch and release policy in the early eighties it has insured the future of the lake and that played a big factor in choosing to set our roots there. If you have any questions, feel free to call me at 1(705)-534-1991 from October to May and 1(807) 868-2208 in the summer or check out website www.fishbucklake.com"
1264549,polaris-pete,2011-01-25 04:36:00,343,Was just on your website and looks nice but there is a problem at the bottom where THE NEWS and JUNIOR ANGLERS are.These 2 links are in some kind of alien language that 99% of us English speaking folks cannot read.
1264550,Mike Borger,2011-01-25 05:17:00,1554,Isn't everyone fluent in Latin? C'mon!
1264556,Guest,2011-01-25 05:49:00,0,"The website is still under construction. We should have things wrapped up in the next week. Just waiting for some input from our guests and we'll fill in the blank pages. The Latin is just generic filler our web guys put in to fill the page. If you have any questions send us an email. Thanks, John"
1264558,Mike Borger,2011-01-25 06:06:00,1554,"I think pretty much everyone knows that John. Just curious, do you offer a family package? (mom, dad, and two kids) Shoot me a pm."
