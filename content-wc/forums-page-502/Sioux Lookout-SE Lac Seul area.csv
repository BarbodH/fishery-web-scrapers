Have heard a lot of mixed reviews on the ""Donut"". Lac Seul we like to fish by loon rapids and Bear Paw.Where do ya'll go...if you are willing to share!"
1281972,midwest,2011-03-13 18:34:00,25,"The donut I know is on Minnitaki, and the moose bay I know is on Pelican? Those the same places you're talking about?"
1282107,Ranger319,2011-03-14 07:39:00,166,"yes. Would like to try a few new spots this year. I always see people fishing by frog rapids. Never see a fish caught, but man people fish there! Has anyone tried above or below the chute?"
1282112,tv4fish,2011-03-14 07:44:00,2694,"Ranger: If you enjoy a ""boat trip"" you may want to try heading up to the Picnic Bay area on Lac Seul - we hit areas up there and have found a number of ""favorite spots"". We primarily fish for walleyes and have found nice fish and good numbers."
1282132,IaDave,2011-03-14 08:36:00,476,If you hit it just right in the early season it can be good below and above just like Abrams chute.
1282209,Walleye_Wrangler,2011-03-14 11:49:00,138,When are you going? Time of year makes a big difference.
1282224,BenBeattie,2011-03-14 12:33:00,232,"Early season, Frog rapids and the abrham chutes are full of fish... if you can stand the crowds. So much water up here to fish it's just awesome."
1282253,Ranger319,2011-03-14 14:12:00,166,Has anyone fished wesley point on Lac Seul? It looks interesting on a map.
1282285,Rodney Bondele,2011-03-14 15:43:00,73,Fished Frog rapids and the Abrham chutes several years ago over Labor Day weekend. Caught plenty of fish at each. It was bumper boats at the chute with huge northerns stealing many walleyes. Stayed at Wahkwa Lodge last year and often would not see a boat for hours. I don't think you would have a problem finding fish anywhere in that area.Good fishing Rod
1282888,smallieboy2,2011-03-16 03:04:00,24,the donut is a really nice place to cast in late june/july. awesome smallie fishing there
