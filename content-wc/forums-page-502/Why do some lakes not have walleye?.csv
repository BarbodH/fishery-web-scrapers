I'm sure a biologist would answer this question better, but it seems to have to do with the needed amounts of water temperature, sunlight, oxygenated water, bottom friendliness , acceptable presence of egg/fry eating predators, ample food for the hatched fry to eat, etc, all available during the required time slot. Some lakes just do not fit these criteria. Some deep lakes have excellent walleye fishing/reproduction, but they also have enough environmentally friendly shallows. Bill"
559992,Stu,2006-08-03 20:36:00,472,"I was talling to Mohleye the other day about lakes in Canada without a good walleye population. Specifically, Wawang and Rowan. I have fished Rowan twice. It is a deep lake w/ a terrific lake trout and musky population, but no walleye. His theory is that the lakes may be too deep, without alot of shallow water or weed beds. I have seen plenty of trophy walleye pics from Wawang, but not alot of limits. What do you guys think?"
559993,prov1900,2006-08-03 20:46:00,544,"From my experience, lake trout and walleyes do not thrive well together, unless it is a huge system, like LOTW, that has variety in structures. What are the best walleye lakes?....Ones with current, weeds, rocks, sand, shallow, and somewhat deep, all together, i.e., fertile water in addition to a variety of forage. Lake trout lakes tend to be deep, clear, weedless, and infertile. Muskies do well on both, but my theory for them doing really well on lakes like Rowan, is because they are very adaptible for one, and two, the forage that makes those lakers fat, also makes the muskies fat, i.e. ciscoes/whitefish, etc."
560041,bigboy,2006-08-06 17:20:00,13,"STU I posted a question about WAWANG awhile ago and you said you called about 30 people and asked them about the resort and they all raived about it, know you are posting a question about the lake not having a good walleye population just wondering which is the truth."
560060,Guest,2006-08-07 11:04:00,0,Habitat. Some places have pheasants and some don't. Some places have antelope and some don't. Same reason.
560297,Guest,2006-08-14 14:09:00,0,Those are the lakes that i have fished. It's pretty simple...I caught them all!
560298,River_eye,2006-08-14 14:14:00,1486,I hardly see good walleye fishing as the only critera for a good lodge and lake.......... there are other fish you know....
560304,Mohleye,2006-08-14 16:03:00,368,"On the other hand, this is Walleye Central........."

560417,bigboy,2006-08-17 18:01:00,13,eric Fisrt of all I wasnt talking to you so why dont you mind your own business its guys like you that is turning this web site into a #### fest. All I did was ask a question about a lake that I am going to and I expect to get a honest answer. If someone isnt going to answer a question honestly I would appreciate it if they didnt answer at all......besides what business is it of yours what kind of fish I catch........
1279972,Guest,2011-03-09 06:01:00,0,"I kind of find the origional question strange and i too, bigboy wonder about why Stu has asked. If you search the name Wawang on this site, Stu asks about it, draws attention to its supposed controversy, admits he has never visited but then claims there are no fish. I fish the Upsala area every year and have been to Wawang, Pakashkan, Ermine and a few other sneaky spots and had no issue with catching walleyes at all. I am not a pro when it comes to walleyes and actually prefer northerns, but the physiology of the fish will dictate the times to catch them. As we all know, walleyes have very sensitive eyes and can be pretty skittish. Best times to catch trophy's are openers and end of season when they are gorging up near the edges. Wawang specifically is a clear water lake with no inking at all. This makes for more intensive presentation during the middle of the summer when the sun is the strongest. Upsala area is loaded with lakes and each of them very different...some are as black as tar and Wawang is the opposite. I went in August and it was a supposed slower time for trophies, but I really did well. I stayed to the shoals and didnt back troll at all. I used a sideway jigging tactic that really made it worth my while. I also used natural colors as there was no need for heavy florescent jigs or baits...the fish didnt need help seeing that far LOL. I guess I am a little surprised at the supposed controversy with the lake when OFAH has thier trophy numbers and pictures for almost all of them. I find it hard to believe with that many trophies each year, that there cant be any smaller walleye to catch....I know they are a release lake so those fish are released to spawn and due to thier size, the amount of eggs is going to be increased."
