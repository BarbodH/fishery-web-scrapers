1282135,Mohleye,2011-03-14 08:40:00,368,"I think the year it changed from 7 day to 8 the MNR offered the explanation that they had enough requests from those who did fish at least part of an 8th day that they made the change. We email our info ahead to Four Seasons in Ear Falls, as we need to stop and pick up leeches anyway. Sending the info ahead does save considerable time."
1277156,wallydave,2011-03-02 14:08:00,2151,"Nitro, thanks for the link, do they mail the licenses? I don't go through Nestor Falls on my way to Lac Seul."
1277157,Mohleye,2011-03-02 14:10:00,368,I counted Saturday to Saturday on my fingers....and came up with 8. We also email or fax our info to Four Seasons and they have our licenses ready and waiting.
1277172,tv4fish,2011-03-02 14:45:00,2694,I come up with 10 (just kidding of course) I guess I was thinking MOST guys (non-resident) would have to drive a ways and wouldn't be able to fish all 8 days. I guess it would be interesting to find out how many actually DO fish 8 days. ??
1277251,Glenman12,2011-03-02 17:28:00,762,We used Anglers Pro Shop about 4 years ago and they dont mail them out...they have them all ready for you and all you have to do is pay for them..We got 12 guys in and and out of there in 10 minutes...but now we go up 502 so we order them by phone from the MNR
1277414,Mr Ranger,2011-03-03 06:32:00,272,The reason would be for the few folks that would want to fish the day they leave or the last Saturday. You could fish Saturday to Saturday. 7 day license you could not fish the las Saturday
1277448,Golden Eagle,2011-03-03 07:42:00,2642,They come in handy when your plane is over a day late picking up at the outpost. I've had the experience more than once. Have always bought a seasonal sportsman's license.
1277479,41jims,2011-03-03 08:27:00,30,Could someone tell me the cost of the 8 day sportsman license? Thanks
1277524,tv4fish,2011-03-03 10:06:00,2694,"I think this is current/correct. Also - If you don't have one - you also need ""the Outdoor card"" http://www.seagulloutfitters.com/fishing_canada.htmhttp://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business...02_165336.html"
1281783,OutfitterJoe,2011-03-13 08:31:00,27,"$49.02 CDN for a 8 day Non-Resident Sportsmen's Licence, and the Required Canada Outdoor Card is $9.68 CDN."
1281896,northernbite,2011-03-13 13:36:00,1186,"Our group fish 8 days; travel up on Wednesday, fish Thursday through Thursday, travel home on Friday. We tent camp on Crown Land.Paul"
1276924,Beagle_Nut,2011-03-02 05:26:00,52,"Now that we have our ON Outdoors Cards does anyone know if it's possible to buy your fishing licenses online or through the mail now, and if it's supposed to be possible has anybody done it?Reason I'm asking is that we're thinking of trying to make the trip in one day this year and we'll be pressed for time on our big travel day, plus we're staying at Whitefish Bay Camp and we'll have a 5 mile boat ride to camp so getting there after dark would not be good. Thanks."
1276927,Glenman12,2011-03-02 05:45:00,762,I called the MNR right after the first of the year about this...the gentleman I talked to said the system is still not set up for non residents to order their licenses on line yet...he couldnt say when it would be either..now that might have changed by now as I havent checked back..he told me you can still call 800-667-1940 and order it by phone and they will mail it to you
1276928,Fisherman1792,2011-03-02 05:50:00,927,Have you tried to do it by phone by calling the 1-800#? I know you can buy the hunting licenses that way.Fisherman 1792
1276931,djarz929,2011-03-02 06:12:00,40,Try the 800 # - last year got it in 5 days
1276938,GOBIG,2011-03-02 06:27:00,126,I called for mine in mid-late jan. Got it in one week.
1276967,tv4fish,2011-03-02 07:38:00,2694,Thanks guys --- that's good to know.
1276983,Beagle_Nut,2011-03-02 08:07:00,52,Thanks for the info all.
1277067,scgibby11,2011-03-02 11:13:00,109,"I called this week. They do not have the on=line system set up yet--at least not for non=residents.They did give me an email address to send the request to. I did that. They are now supposed to call me when ready, and I'll give them my credit card numbers.I did it that way because I wanted licenses for the whole family of 4. They would only do 2 licenses over the phone and I would have had to call back and wait in the queue again.Scott"
1277082,nitroman,2011-03-02 11:36:00,368,http://www.anglersproshop.ca/ It's always there waiting for me Saturday morning when I arrive plus I can get Groceries next door at Dalseg's http://www.nwonet.net/~finefoods/
1277140,tv4fish,2011-03-02 13:36:00,2694,"Maybe it's obvious --- But, why do they now sell an 8 day license instead of a 7 day like they used to (when most resorts have a 7 day stay plan)?We stay Sat. to Sat. -- like a lot of the plans ??? Why do we need/want an 8 day license??"
