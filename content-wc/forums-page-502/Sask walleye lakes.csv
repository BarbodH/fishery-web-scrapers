Actually there are a bunch of great lakes along the Hanson Lake road on your way up to Flin Flon. One stop I would make would be Pawistic Lake http://www.pawistiklodge.com/ great walleye fishing here. Also Dechambeault Lake is really good as well. Located right on the Road. I fish all three of these lake regularly and they are really, really good for drive to fishing lakes."

Never got anything (walleye)over 3-1/2 lbs, however. It got netted each spring, no idea if this is still true. Beautiful area. Bill"
