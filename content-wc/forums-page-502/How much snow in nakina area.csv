I guess you could say that I have the dreaded fever! I have been to LS at leat half a dozen times, low, normal and high water levels. The fishing has always been good to great!"
1281308,fishforlife,2011-03-12 02:24:00,77,"According to the ""Experts"" local residents, we definitely will be riding a lot higher in the water column this year, as they have had tons of snow and are looking at April for the all important boost for the season opener with a rainy spring."
