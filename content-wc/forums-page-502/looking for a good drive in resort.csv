1275943,Mich_Fisherman,2011-02-27 15:52:00,292,"Neil Buy a flat or 2 of crawlers at Young's in Wawa, Trading Post (I think that's the name) as you leave the Sault or Skinners Acres in Longlac (awesome fishing store). They all have leeches. O'Sullivan Outfitters will supply you with minnows. Good Seeing you at the show on Saturday."
1276185,wpgriverguide,2011-02-28 10:23:00,55,"Eagle Nest Lodge, 1.5 hrs North of Winnipeg Manitoba.I worked at there drive in location for 3 years and loved every minute of it. Great walleye fishing and I have caught 45"" Northern there and seen much bigger than that. Smallmouth fishing is second to none in the spring. Winnipeg river has ample big fish to keep you occupied for a week. They have a housekeeping plan at the drive in ""Landing"" and will include a day trip up to the Lodge(27 miles away) where you will have a guide and gourmet meal at the end of the day. Boats are available if you need them at the Landing, they are 16.5 ft Alumacrafts with 30hp or 18ft with 40hp. Everything is well maintained, cabins have a beutiful view, internet access, satelite tv. etc. etc. Owner/operator Fred Pedruchny is a great guy, loves his job and same goes for everyone working there. I gaurantee a good time if you head there, heck I will even go out there for a day to show you around the river. PM me, I can help you with any questionsLink deleted"
1281177,Guest,2011-03-11 17:41:00,0,We've done both Wawang and Ghost Lake....both were drive in and both were awesome! Wawang had more trophies but Ghost Lake had different variety

It looked like a nice place with good fishing, doesn't seem like the kind of place that would need to misrepresent itself."

1266934,GWC,2011-02-01 07:35:00,1021,"We've had excellent luck at Poplar Point Resort. We've taken 44 inch northerns & lots of walleye. It's a good lake, it's accessible and the folks at Poplar Point Resort are great. You didn't say if you're taking your own boat or not. The resort has boat & motor packages. We've found their equipment to be reliable and in good condition. We'll be going up in early June."

1266950,Mr Ranger,2011-02-01 08:03:00,272,"Another option could be O'Sullivan's up near Nakina. Bit of a drive but know they have a lot of MI and Ohio customers that come up. Outstanding walleye, good lake trout and northern. Know they do get some big northern but we usually don't fish for them. Walleye and LT keep us busy. Here is the site if you are interested.no links allowedGood luck"
1267010,adempsey,2011-02-01 10:10:00,963,I saw this place on a Fish'n'Canada show: Looked like a nice place to me. Never been though. I have a feeling that almost any lake in that area would be good for walleye and pike.no links
1267160,dosxx,2011-02-01 17:00:00,60,"The group I go with used Osullivan Lake Outfitters (just down the road from Osullivan Rainbow Lodge) and we did a boat in trip to Abamasagi Lake and I would give it a thumbs up. The overnight at the camp (we go up the night before) was adequate for a night's rest. The boat in camp was decent. We had a generator (lights and freezer) and a hand pump inside which I found luxurious compared to most of the fly in trips I have been on. The boats were big and stable, and the motors ran fine, although ours leaked a bit of gas. The fishery is excellent with lots of water to cover. We had large numbers of walleyes, caught big pike despite not targeting them, and there are lake trout but we only gave that a token effort (1 pound snap weight on a walleye rod was just too much). The price is reasonable and you get a fly in lake for a boat in price. The only down side is that there is about 3 or maybe 4 cabins on the lake that are flown into by an outfitter out of Nakina but this is a BIG system and there is plenty of room. Also, it appears that the lake is accessible to others because we had some paddlers come through and also a boat of three that were not from the camps came out of a river and pulled within 20 yards of us, anchored and started catching walleye..it was something else considering the thousands of acres of lake to anchor on... we smiled, wished them luck, and moved to the next hot spot."
1275692,Robert Cardenas,2011-02-26 22:43:00,138,Check out Bonny Bay Resort in Dryden Ont. I have been staying there for the last 10 years. Stayed at many resorts and have not found one to even be close to comparing it to. The PWT went to this lake 2 years in a row and there is a lake map chip of the lake. Good Luck. If you come up first week in June I would be glad to put you on a lot of fish.
