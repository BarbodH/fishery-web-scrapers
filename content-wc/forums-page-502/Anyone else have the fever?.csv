1279215,tackleman,2011-03-07 15:24:00,444,"I talked to my buddy from minnesota last night and we were trying to set up a weekend when we could hit Cabelas in Owatanna but his work schedule was in his office in Wisconsin so he couldn't committ to a date, i guess if we can't work out a mutual time to go, i'll have to pass up imposing on his hospitality and book into the hotel next to cabelas and force myself to spend even more time (and probably money) browsing the fishing superstore. just thinking of this trip is helping me pass the time before open water."
1279242,adempsey,2011-03-07 16:36:00,963,"Well, I tied about 25 pike flies and 100+ crawler harnesses thinking about my upcoming trip.....now what?!?!?Ice fishing has been great but starting to really look forward to the open water. Probably going to turn to shopping now......ugh!!"
1279558,Mike Kansas,2011-03-08 10:14:00,1463,On the second Saturday in June we will be Jigging on Lac Seul out of Black Bay Outpost. I think this is our 25th year there and I cant wait to enjoy the week and the stars at night. The stars are so bright there that it looks like a bunch of holes in the floor of heaven Mike Kansas
1281384,NARDA 1,2011-03-12 08:07:00,636,"I Don't know what your talking about.... 178 days, 23 hours, 52 minutes and 20 seconds... no 19,18,17,16"
1281725,Moosebunk,2011-03-13 03:08:00,211,"Got a sunburn catching whitefish and laketrout over a foot of black ice this past week. It was hot on the face, kinda like a fever too."
1281774,OutfitterJoe,2011-03-13 08:13:00,27,"Yesterday was spent, getting equipment together, pulling out my trailer, going over that, making sure it's ready to load. I have a new outboard and I started that for the first time, one pull, and the 4 hp Merc fired up. I use that to push my guide boat on the lakes that I can ATV into. Today, I live 14 miles from Cabela's in Hamburg, Pa., and I still swear that the only reason that Cabela's choose to build there, was that I lived in the ajoining zip code!! I have 6 weeks to go, before I head north for the next six months..ahh the sound of the Blackflies is calling, the morning scream of the loon..and Walleye everyday..I guess I do have the feelin'!!!"
1281889,bullhockey,2011-03-13 13:23:00,41,"118 days and we head to Nakina and a week of peace, fishing and eating eyes on Kayedon lake. Haven't been there since the mid 70's. Going with three of my kids this year, and one of them will be my daughter. Hope everyone has the best trip of their lives this year !!!!"
1281990,Danbear,2011-03-13 19:12:00,72,"My tackle boxes are cleaned and sorted, my order from Bass Pro has been opened and put away, have to get to Cabelas and pickup my new rod and reel which just came in, now the snow has to melt so I can get my boat out of my dad's extra garage in Door county and along side of my garage.Seems like all the fishing I do in spring and summer is just practice for Canada. Eagle Lake better watch out this year !"
1273958,eye-hunter,2011-02-22 11:43:00,435,"99 days until I head to Lake of the Woods, and the fishing fever is bad right now."
1274026,Glenman12,2011-02-22 14:25:00,762,That should be the 2nd Sat in June...if so we'll be about 15 miles south of you on Cedar Lake..
1274339,wallydave,2011-02-23 11:01:00,2151,I am taking a buddy to Ontario for his first REAL fishing trip! He just sent his paperwork in for his passport! Ony 101 more days before we drown some minnows and feast upon walleye!
1275070,labsrus,2011-02-25 10:58:00,557,Guess its bad for a lot of guys List of things for boat improvements done Went to the Big Outdoor show in PA a week ago Spent a ton at Cabelas Only 134 days till our flyin trip Only 150 days till our family trip to Ontario.
1275109,jsmyers,2011-02-25 12:33:00,198,"Imagine how bad it is for me:I haven't been fishing in Canada since I believe 1996. From the age of 5 until I was about 14, I spent a week in the late summer catching pike in Wabaskang. It was the highlight of my summer as a kid.In exactly 12 weeks, I'll be on the road up there again. It is crazy for me to realize that I'm older now that my father was the first time he took me.My grandfather passed 4 years ago this spring. He always helped to finance our trips and glue us all together. When I was a teenager, we tried to cut the trips back to a closer destination because the travel was hard for him as he got older. We went to Northern Minnesota once or twice; our last year we went to Moon River, ON. I don't think any of us felt like we could go on that trip if my grandfather stayed home, but he couldn't go.I always missed Wabaskang, even when I was in college at Michigan Tech and could pretty easily catch northern.I've already bought my plane tickets to Michigan to meet up with my dad. I still have a few final gear purchases to make, and we have to plan our food for the week, but otherwise I'm just in a waiting pattern. My brand new rod and reel are sitting in the corner of the living room whispering to me.Almost forgot to mention that spring is springing where I live now (Carolina Piedmont). I went bass fishing the other day, but trying to catch largemouth from the shore of a gigantic, muddy reservoir isn't the same as catching fish with teeth in water like nature intended.We'll see if I don't explode from anticipation before I get on the plane."
1275114,wallydave,2011-02-25 12:44:00,2151,"The days just seem to move oh so slllooowwllyy, when your waiting to make the magical trip onto Canadian waters! 99 days to go for my next chance to wet a line, catch lunch and most importantly, enjoy the natural beauty of NW Ontario! My boat/cabin buddy just sent off his passport paperwork! I hope the government keep working so he can get his paperwork processed in time! The waiting just got worse!"
1275182,jigmeister,2011-02-25 14:57:00,34,actually i did the math wrong. ill be there 10 days earlier(wee!!) may 28th thru june 4th
1275441,Catman59,2011-02-26 09:31:00,345,I'm headed up to Sturgeon in 12 days to try my luck ice fishing. It will be a first and something that I have dreaming of for years. That will help make the summer trip a little easier to wait for !!!
1276181,fishman10,2011-02-28 10:08:00,226,i just tied 50 spinners and 100 steelhead yarn flies. i watch w.f.n. 8 hours a day. no i dont have the fever.
1279015,wallydave,2011-03-07 07:47:00,2151,"My boat/cabin buddy and I tried some shopping therapy this weekend. Nothing like a trip to Gander Mountain, or insert the name of your favorite fishing gear supplier here, to help with the ""FEVER""! Jigs for walleye, spoons and cranks for pike, some rain gear and line, just might help treat the fever symptoms, but it is a temporary treatment! Under 90 days to go, not that we are counting!"
1273188,Glenman12,2011-02-20 12:38:00,762,"Im not sure..2 trips to Cabelas, an order from Fleet Farm, a trip to Bass Pro tomorrow..I might have it, not sure"
1273200,ziggysquatch,2011-02-20 13:00:00,28,Normally I don't mind winter because I like to ski and I like it cold better than warm. But this year I bought a boat at the boat show and now I can't wait for spring to come! This snow storm is really killing me.
1273231,turtle chain,2011-02-20 14:24:00,1398,I am a big snowmobile guy but this year I am storing my boat in the garage instead of putting it storage and it is killing me every time I go in the garage I think Walleye I cant wait for open water
1273504,Mike Kansas,2011-02-21 09:52:00,1463,This has been a long winter. I have been building lures and working on getting them loaded up on our website. May have to buy another tackle box to get all the stuff in that I think will catch fish. Its going to be a great fishing year and I hope you all catch a bunch and have a safe and succesful season. Mike Kansas Sirmanski Lures
1273555,wallydave,2011-02-21 12:21:00,2151,"When I stop and think that in a few more days I will have less than 100 days to go, is that a sign that I might have the dreaded walleye fever!?"
1273566,youngcanadianguide,2011-02-21 12:55:00,60,My Dad is for sure. He washed the boat already and today he is headed up to Wawa to go to a meeting and he might (depending on road conditions) go all the way to the camp. I'm getting restless to but I am a little scared to be running my own camp too.
1273813,Babamel2,2011-02-22 05:54:00,414,"I have never had the fever. just because I start working on my tackle in Oct. make sure the boat and motor are in good condition by late Feb. practice casting in March. Read Walleyecentral 3 times a day. Look at camp websites often and start to plan the menu and travel in January, I dont have anything unusual. I am not sure what you mean by ""the fever."""
1273845,tackleman,2011-02-22 07:20:00,444,"I don't have it, I know because I just got back from Florida last week and while I was there, I only dreamt of ice fishing, of course when we got back it was -31 so it kind of takes the thought of making the boat ready fade away quickly"
1273881,adempsey,2011-02-22 08:26:00,963,"Fever??? More like a chronic illness for me. Thankfully I can fish all year round if I choose to....although, my wife probably thinks otherwise."
1273909,jigmeister,2011-02-22 09:21:00,34,"104 days til wabaskang & sleepy dog cabins...wallies and smallies and pike..OH MY!!! muskie,lake trout and jumbo perch, too!!what a smorgasbord"
1272886,Fishin Fun,2011-02-19 14:40:00,218,"I'm almost driving myself crazy. With the warmer weather and the fishing shows on Saturday and Sunday mornings, I can hardly wait to go to Gullrock fishing again this year. I even have dreams about it! I don't know what I'm going to do for the next 139 days until we get there. Yes, I'm even counting the days. Jeez."
1272902,IaDave,2011-02-19 15:16:00,476,I've got the fever too. I have been spending the last 2 weeks recovering from a total hip replacement and can't wait to try out the new hip hopefully for the opener at Minnitaki. Been putting off the surgery the last 3 years so looking to going pain free-maybe it will improve my fishing success. No countdown for the spring trip I go on the spur of the moment depending on the weather.
1272911,Mr Ranger,2011-02-19 15:47:00,272,Back at ya. Anyone know how to put a barcode on a 1/16oz jig? I can't organize anymore. Its coming and a month from now could be putting stuff back in boat for March River fishing somewhere. Was at Marathon County Sports show today. Lots of glazed looks and suspect we are not alone in our frustration Blizzard tomorrow though in Wausau
1272930,keek,2011-02-19 17:18:00,1003,I was practice casting in my backyard with 30+ mph winds and swirling snow. I got the fever. 111 days till Canada.
1272967,wallydave,2011-02-19 19:52:00,2151,"By the time I will be back on Lac Seul this June, it will have been three years since I made the trip up North! I have been buying rodnreels, jigs, line, lures to stave off the anxiety of waiting! It is good that we have WC to help keep us sane while we wait ever so patiently for the sound of the bow, cutting through the flat calm on LS, the cry of the loon, and oh yes the sound of the screaming drag!!"
1272984,Fishin Fun,2011-02-19 20:30:00,218,"I guess tomorrows weather will bring me back to reality. Supposed to get 6-12 inches of snow. They are backing off from the 16 inches they were predicting a couple days ago. BUT back on the subject of fishing. I know what you guys mean by organizing. I've alreay been through Cabelas and checking for anything new. I purchased another $700 fish finder. Been waiting for mount that in the boat. This one has GPS so now I'll have 2 fish finders in the boat. Kind of overkill, but I wanted to have one up in the front of the boat when I'm using the trolling motor. I even had a dream about walleye fishing the other night. Wow."
1272997,Jack77,2011-02-19 21:40:00,168,"112 days until we leave for Brace Lake. I have the fever bad, I spent an hour today watching youtube videos on making your own walleye rigs. I probably won't even use rigs this spring on our trip !"
1273042,MorganMan,2011-02-20 06:49:00,341,"Dang, we don't go for 6 months yet! However.....we are quickly approaching the opening of the Rainy River and catching the big mamas!! Hope it's as good for as long as it was last year!"
1273079,Bill Krejca,2011-02-20 07:56:00,6107,"Re: dreams about Canada - I'd be worried if I didn't have any. No wonder I wake up so tired in the morning, Dad and I having spent half the night pulling those lunkers in! Bill"
1273083,jaggersr,2011-02-20 08:04:00,44,I have it bad to. Have been doing little projects on the boats. Surfing Ebay for good deals. Spending time on the net on fishing sites instead of working. Watching fishing shows on Sat and Sun. Went to a sport show yesterday and planning to do maintenance on all my reals next weekend. I guess I should of said I have it REAL bad.
