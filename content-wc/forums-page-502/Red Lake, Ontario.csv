1280317,Moondog,2011-03-09 18:33:00,362,"Yeah, I wouldn't be any where near Ranger Bay until after June 15th unless you want to meet Officer Mauw. Gull Rock takes it's sanctuary very seriously. Man, that's a long trek from Red Lake.........don't they have any fish there???? <grin>"

This is my first time back to Canada in about 10 years.I know we can get to Gull Rock but I think that would be a long drive. Always an option though. Thanks"
1279337,Golden Eagle,2011-03-07 20:11:00,2642,Where are you staying?
1279343,tackleman,2011-03-07 20:16:00,444,"Gee, I don't know what the going rate for fishing tips is these days."
1279346,Golden Eagle,2011-03-07 20:27:00,2642,For years I got by with Riesens from Wal-Mart for Wendy and dark rum for Kim. It kept them happy.
1279362,Marc63280,2011-03-07 21:05:00,309,I'm going to be staying on McKenzie Island at a buddy's cabin. Tackleman- good tips are priceless!
1279368,Golden Eagle,2011-03-07 21:28:00,2642,Walleyes at the Chukuni River Bridge. If there's room for one more boat.Mouth of the Chukuni River if you can find room for one more boat. Stay away from the sanctuary or pay a fine.

1280146,Pezman38,2011-03-09 12:05:00,3196,"I know a lot of guys that treck up and down the chukuni each day to fish walleyes on Keg Lake and Gull Rock. I have also heard that lake trout is more abundent on Red Lake, Gull Rock population is slim to none (camp owner quote, not experience). I think you will find walleyes shallow at this time of year, weed flats, rocky areas, and sand at depths of 10ft or less is what I would target first. Then work your way deeper until you find them. I believe that during this time Ranger Lake is open, but closes in April. Most walleyes spawn on Ranger so fishing there at the end of May is prolly worth the trip. Presentation would be a minnow harness pulled slowly 1mph or less, jigging with minnow, and casting cranks. You can also experiment with worms and leeches. Most the time we use a minnow harness to locate fish, then drop jigs on their heads. My experience comes from Keg and Gull Rock in August, so these tips are just suggestions on what I would do if I was you."
