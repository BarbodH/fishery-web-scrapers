1281488,youngcanadianguide,2011-03-12 12:18:00,60,"Hey Everyone,I have a question about larger groups. Do you feel it's important to give discounts to large groups? Or do you feel it's a disadvantage because the camp is more crowded and more fishing pressure.Another question, what do you think about renting the whole camp for a week.(Saturday to Saturday) That's 5 cabins, 6,000 acres of water, and no other outfitters or cabins on the lake. The price with conservation license only (not included) would be $3995.00 for up to 12 people and additional charges for the max of 15 people. With regular license the cost would be $4995 for the max of 12 people. This doesn't includes boats, gas, bait, tax, and other purchases. What is some opinion on this pricing? And I know some guys will want to ask where the camp is but PLEASE, I post under a don't ask don't tell policy. Hahahahaha I'm only asking for your opinion not to get business. I hope everyone will understand this. Thanks."
1281510,Golden Eagle,2011-03-12 13:35:00,2642,"I've never bought a conservation license.I don't take walleyes home. I haven't killed a pike since 1976.I haven't killed a bass since 1960.I wet my hands before handling any fish.My fish are out of water only seconds for a photograph.I can't remember when I've killed a walleye over 18"". My walleye dinner will consist of two walleyes around 15"" each.I've bought about 50 seasonal sportsman's licenses.Should I pay more to fish in Canada than somebody (fishing w/conservation license) who brings in a 4# walleye to have a photo taken on the grass in front of the camp sign?I've seen fishermen with a conservation license who are really abusive to the fishery. Discounting for carrying a conservation license is sort of like being rewarded for buying a Chevy Volt. I like the idea of C & R for all pike and bass, plus no kill for walleyes 18"" and over. YCG, don't be offended. We might get some discussion going on this one. Mine is not the only opinion to be considered. Campowners should run camps as they see fit."
1281539,wolverine fan,2011-03-12 14:43:00,71,"ycg- as a business owner and not a fishing camp owner and one who has 15 years of canadian resort fishing, i'll offer my two cents. I would probably start with taking my ""hottest"" fishing demand times, i'm guessing first week walleye,muskie, etc ( im not sure what yours are) and i would try to maximize my revenue for beds/slots available. I would make few concessions and try for the perfect occupancy versus average daily/weekly rate ratio, regardless of group size. I would put huge preferences to those who will put a sizeable down payment as soon as possible. Im thinking revenues are hard to come by in the offseason and each pre payment offers security and way harder to decommit. My shoulder seasons and weeks (im guessing mid august) i would offer discounts to groups over individuals. I say this because in my experiences at camps there seemed to be a ""happier"" atmosphere when there are fewer singles/doubles but larger groups. In talking with the lodge owners they seemed to think there were less problems with larger groups and they seemed to be more self reliant where the singles/doubles etc seemed to need more assistance, service etc. This may have just been the few owners i talked to's opinion but my experiences have been the same, the larger the group we had the easier we were on the camp. Using the same premise, i would think renting the whole place out would be a great idea as long as your revenue wasnt going to be compromised more than u could live with. Good luck."
1281545,dutchboy,2011-03-12 14:56:00,5717,"Your business is built on return customers. You need to ask your self if I rent the whole camp to one group will they return next year? The year after? What about the people who have been coming here that week for years? How will they take being replaced by a group? While it might be nice to get that one fat check from a group I think in the long run it will hurt you.Discounts? No, I think you discount ""future"" trips rather then present trips. When checking out you will know if you want these people back or not. If so hand them a coupon for a discount on next years gas, bait, lodging or whatever. Thats the time to let them know how much you appreciated having them. Better yet would be to send a handwritten note with some photos you took of them while they were there. At that time offering up a discount of some sort for a early booking for the following year may work for you.If you are running a great camp people will be clamoring to get in. Discounts will only be needed to show appreciation.Keep asking questions, it's the only way you will learn."
1281556,v-bay gord,2011-03-12 15:07:00,3168,"A couple thoughts come to mind. With only 5 cabins I don't think you need to worry about having a crowding problem. I do agree with golden eagle that the discount for fishing with a conservation licence does not necessarily translate into more conservation minded guests, and the pricing you are contemplating really penalizes the person with the regular licence. What does it mean in a worse case scenario, they keep two more walleyes? Not a big deal. What about the group on the conservation licence who eats fish every day, does not release bigger fish, has a poor attitude about handling fish, etc. If I was to suggest a correlation between pricing and conservation, I would suggest that a higher price would likely attract a more conservation minded angler. They are generally more willing to pay a premium for a perceived quality fishing experience. You might end up with a better ""quality"" of clientel, granted fewer of them, but in the end the revenue is the same and your conservation goals might be better served as well. If you feel strongly about the conservation end of things, there is nothing wrong with having your own camp policy......ie. some of the suggestions that golden eagle might agree with."
1281650,Obabikon,2011-03-12 18:27:00,2370,"Yes, it's worth it to discount to land a large group. I wouldn't discount simply because they're a large group, but the fact is... a large group has one spokesman. You deal with one person, and it's MUCH easier than dealing with 3-4 groups of 2-4. On the licensing... no. They already get a $20 discount for purchasing a conservation license. Taking home 40 walleyes won't do any damage to the fishery... as they eat more than that during their week long trip."
1281653,adempsey,2011-03-12 18:53:00,963,"Group discounts - yes, a no brainer IMO.I think $550-$600 per person for a week with a boat is a very reasonable price to pay. I also don't think you should list separate pricing for the two license types. Include the conservation license and list that price. If someone wants to go and purchase their own sports license, so be it. There should be a discount for already having a license if anything."
1281767,Guest,2011-03-13 07:58:00,0,freinds fished a camp with 7-8 others rented 2 cabins same week in june for many years owner rented all out at once they never went back owner handled it bad vacation time already booked let them know in april not enough notice for changes in vac.
1281784,jaggersr,2011-03-13 08:32:00,44,"I had a similar experience at a small motel for salmon fishing in Michigan. Wife and I had been booking the same week for 10 years straight. Always paid our deposit for the next year before we left. Last time we went I went to pay deposit before we left and they told us we would have to pick another week as they were already booked for the next year. A group had booked the entire hotel. What made it worse it was initiated by someone that I had recommended the motel to. Needless to say we haven't went back.My thoughts on large group discounts are this. Build your reputation on the quality of your fishery, quality of camp, gear and service and you should not have any issues keeping the camp full without offering discounts. I really think the popularity of quality drive in or boat in camps is going to explode in the near future due to the cost of fly in's continuing to rise. Just my 2 cents."
1281893,youngcanadianguide,2011-03-13 13:35:00,60,"Hey everyone,One thing we would never bump a guest without their ok. We just thought because there is a few week that were not booked, because my parents trying to keep the numbers down for a easy transition this year. Our goal is to have 12 -15 people a week. A loyal repeat guest dollar today and tomorrow is worth more then a today's only two dollars guest. Something I have learned from my parents and I also feel is important.Another point I should add is that at this time my parents and I are mostly just interested in rebuilding and improving this new camp. At this point my income only needs to cover cost, payments and improvements with a little profit for us. It's not like I need a real income at this time of my life, so the way I see it now is to build a good camp and invest time and money now so in the future when I'm going to need to make a living for myself I'll be one step a head for myself. For the record my parents really want me to invest my time and extra money now in the camp and they are willing to help and invest into me now for my future. What my dad is saying to me is let me take care of your needs now and you worry about your future, he has a saying ( and he has lots of them ) Let me invest in you today because all the material things that I have today will be gone with time, but the value's that I instill into my children will last for generations to come. This is my only real gift to the future generations that I can pass on.I hope this helps you guys and bring a little more lite on what and why I'm asking these questions. As I'm slowly growing and learning to run this camp. Running this camp on the business side is just a little different then if a someone different is trying to make a living and/or supporting a family, I still have time with this and besides if golden eagle is right about someone stealing my future female partner for a better life I may be able to live pretty cheap by myself!!!!!! Hahahaha Just a good laugh Golden Eagle with your pass comment!!! Plus one of those little comments from my Dad is  invest all that you can today so for tomorrow you can play"" and the last thing that my Dad is teaching me is build your reputation, then build your camp, then build your fishery and you have just built your future.Now about the discounts with fishing under conservation lic. I'm a little surprised about this. Here are some fun facts that we have found out with our main camp.2003 conservation lic. Sales were only 6% and 2010 they were 51% 2006 when we started our conservation program with the MNR most of our guest were against it. Today most are for it.Biologist shared we would lose guest at first, but come back strong in about 5yrs. Yes, we did lose guest but they were only the ones hardest on the fish. They were replaced with the new conservation minded guest and it happened right away. Conservation program has reduced the amount of walleye harvested thru our weekly fish counts.Based on 50/50 male/female, saving just 250 1.5lb walleye per year = 1,500,000 eggs per year = 1% hatch = 15,000 fry = 150 walleye that reach 17 in 7 years. Now in 7 years with just these 150 walleye this will add another 900,000 eggs to our already 1,500,000 eggs (will be even more due to growth) and the chain reaction will continual, now there is a point that the lake will reach its own limit of fish. This is what I have be learning and helping with during the summers with our Biologist. So this is why just saving 2 fish, that don't go home per fisherman is important to me. It may not seem a lot to the avg. fisherman but to a camp owner this is huge. As far a fisherman cheating with the numbers, if they do it on a conservation lic. then most likely they will with a reg. lic. Only my opinion. Besides when being check by a CO they have a little more thought behind if they should or should not hide those extra fish.My last thought MNR gives discounts for conservation lic. Restaurants give lunch special for small lunch portions and what about all those people that get Senior Discounts or children plates at the restaurants. Because as 16 year old I probably would eat more and they don't give any discounts for me NOW!!!! Hahahaha So all though life businesses do give discounts for taking less. This is just my thought and still very much like to hear everyone's opinion, it's important to hear everyone thoughts, not just mine, so I thought I would share more details about mind.Golden Eagle amazing, my Dad just said this past fall that he would love to get in politics, but he just can't give up his love for Canada. His plate form would be that people need to learn to earn and not just money, but responsibly, respect, honor, and most important how to love and forgive."

1281801,Golden Eagle,2011-03-13 09:12:00,2642,"A late cancellation of a large party (anything after February) puts you in a hurt unless you've collected a 50% deposit. $100 dollar deposit for a large group of no shows is not enough to keep the lights burning.Don't undercharge for your product. Don't let guests pencil whip you. We want our camps to be operating over the long haul. YCG, the success of your current operation speaks well for the way it's being managed. Possibly a certain TOSU dairy farmer graduate should be running for the U.S. Senate. He'd win a ton of votes from this forum for his business sense. Also, don't hesitate to argue any points I've made. If you go too rambunctious on me I'll send somebody up to your place to give you a good whipping - in a game of horse."
