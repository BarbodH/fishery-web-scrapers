1275988,orchard frank,2011-02-27 17:35:00,1900,"Canadian camps can be tricky for US owners. Health insurance for employees, liability, work rules etc. Most successful camps, Canada or US, rely on repeat customers and referrals. Attracting that customer base can take several seasons. Drive-to, boat-to, and fly-to all have issues. One of the biggest challenges is recruiting younger people, time, money and obligation conflicts. How many bad seasons can you absorb? Many (most) costs are fixed regardless of income. Things like gas prices etc. can have a large influence, as well as the body of water you're located on. I've been good friends with a family that has been successful for many decades, and have been told that the rate of success among new owners is very low within 3-5 years. Seems like a great life, and I think it could be, but you have to put a**es in the seats."
1275989,v-bay gord,2011-02-27 17:39:00,3168,That is a very good point!
1275990,Bill Krejca,2011-02-27 17:43:00,6107,"Be very careful, check out a place from as many angles as you can. A lake with pristine blue water can look awfully attractive, but if clients have to fish elsewhere for walleyes, it might be a tough go - most folks like to fish walleyes where the resort is located, trout being somewhat further down the list of preferred quest. Ask about whether netting is allowed, or maybe will be. This can change a great lake into less than good. Water standards are getting more restrictive. sometimes new owners may be required to upgrade water supplies, septics, etc. Check out the present systems for problems - ask around, past clients, nearby plumbing supply stores, etc. Cows don't require a lot of diplomacy when being dealt with, ask yourself if patience and 24/7 service is one of your strong characteristics. The season for making a profit is short, ask yourself whether you will need to seek other employment during the other 6 months of the year. Family considerations also require extensive planning. Keep in mind that there is a reason so many resorts are for sale at the present. Good luck in your decision, sorry to present the negatives, just trying to be of help. Bill Krejca"
1276064,Golden Eagle,2011-02-27 20:57:00,2642,"I started a business from scratch in July 1976 and had a five year plan. I reached my goal, but it was in the 12th year. I found myself at work as early as 6 a.m. on Sundays, without planning to go in. The first two years I was going in at 7 a.m. and leaving at 10p.m. It wasn't easy. Of course it eventually paid off, but there was a time it could have gone either direction. I sold out December 31, 2010, not because I wanted to, but because it's tough finding dedicated employees and as a business owner I was beginning to fear my government. There is too much uncertainty for small business owners. Presently there's no level playing field for public vs private employees.I'd wait at least two years before investing in a new business."
1276135,Fisherman Ted,2011-02-28 07:35:00,461,"I have been thinking about buying a resort for nearly a decade. As a long time guest it looks like the great life, doesn't it? I began looking 7 years ago, narrowed my selection maybe 2 years ago and last fall made the plunge. In two months I will be heading up to Ontario for my first season at Hawk Lake Lodge. I have mulled this decision for years and talked to dozens of owners, hundreds of guests, friends, accountants, lawyers and brokers. Here are a few things I have learned that may be helpful. Right now is potentially the best time to buy a lodge in perhaps a generation. The valuations have been crushed from the double whammy of the dollar plunging and the economy collapsing (especially in the U.S.). Add to that high fuel prices and its not rosy, not at all. Nearly all Canadian lodges as you know rely on U.S. customers who are paying in U.S. dollars. Yet your expenses (for the most part) are in Canadian funds. Those owners that got in at the height of the market are taking it on the chin right now and trying to hang on as best they can. Its not easy by any means. With oil now hitting $100 or more a barrel all of us are cringing about filling up our 500 gallon gas tanks 4 times a year this summer. That hits us square in the face and is unavoidable. What you will also find and what someone pointed out is that your expenses are for the most part fixed. That mortgage payment, insurance, motor leases, oil, gas and electricity bill is not going away. As a first time owner they can be especially expensive I have found as large deposits are required based on your lack of track record. So, for example my electric bill which annually costs perhaps $12,000 also comes with a $5,000 deposit. This was not planned for. Same goes for insurance. Another thing you are going to need to budget for are lawyer and accountant fees, at least for the first season or two. They aren't cheap.The next interesting part is your labor costs. Canadian labor is very expensive (on average twice as much) as compared to the States. It is difficult to bring in foreign workers (other than yourself) so this part of the operation will potentially be your most costly. You will also find that all of your goods are more expensive from food to shampoo, Coke to motor oil. It all comes at a premium and is something I am still trying to get my hands around. And unfortunately trying to import items to save money is a lot of work and can still be expensive as the duties are high. Yes, I can by 400 Rapalas on Ebay for $3 each, but the taxman is going to want a piece of that when I cross the border. From a logistical side of the business this is a hassle I was not fully prepared for. You will also need to carefully project cashflow. With a short season your income for the most part is only in the summer, but your hard expenses are all year long. That will take some good planning to ensure you can meet your financial obligations.You will need to have a good degree of confidence that wherever you buy you have a solid customer base. Look at all audited financial statements of the business, especially the last 2-3 years. I have had owners say my business is worth X because I used to make Y dollars when everything was rosy. True, but if you can't pay the mortgage now your income stream from 10 years ago really means very little. And yes, you also need to have a comfort level that your fishery is one that will continue to flourish and is one that guests will want to keep coming to. Is the fishing getting better or worse? Are more outfitters on the lake or less? Is your lake accessible only via plane or road and if the latter is it open to the public? So, are you now ready to buy? Let's end with the bright side (and again, this is just my opinion).Lodge prices are incredibly cheap right now. You could buy a lodge and receive more in assets than what you paid for them (i.e. the land and assets would be at a nice discount). This could pay off handsomely later on as your up-front costs are very cheap. If you can find a lodge that has a decent revenue stream you could potentially have a wonderful place that will only appreciate over time, very well if you can keep the business going. I have seen lodges that have valuations of half of what they were just a few years ago. If and when things pick up that will pay off in spades. The economy is starting to pick-up and the worst is behind us. As it does there will be more disposable income and hence more fishermen.As the U.S. dollar strengthens that will have a direct impact on your bottom line (for the better). You are buying when it really has hit rock bottom (I realize it could be worse and I am sure someone will comment here but hopefully we are on the upswing). Should things improve owners will directly benefit, you even more so as you bought at the bottom and hopefully got a good deal on your lodge.Bottom LineNow after all of this is said and done what you need to realize (or what I have come to realize) is that you aren't going to get rich (financially) buying a lodge. I can't think of anyone that says gee, let's invest in a Canadian fishing lodge to make money. Couple that with long, long hours and the return on investment is minimal. But what many lodge owners have said, and what I determined for myself is that you don't do this for the money. It's a way of life and something that will change your life for the better forever. Assuming you can make ends meet, you will be living a dream many men only think about and few pull the trigger on. Your job will be enjoying the incredible outdoors with others who love it as much as you do. You will get to entertain guests that are happy to be where they are, want to be with you to talk fishing and everything that surrounds you. They will become your friends and you theirs. You will wake up wanting to go to work, only its not work now is it? Your first view of the day will be looking out at an open lake, your last sound at night will be loons bellowing on the water and in between you will get to experience what few others will ever see. True beauty.Best of luck to you.Fisherman Ted"
1276148,Golden Eagle,2011-02-28 08:18:00,2642,"Ted, you made a great contribution to the thread. All the best to you in your new venture. Your long engagement did much to eliminate most surprises. I became acquainted with the lady half of the former owners when she did shows in Nashville while her spouse worked the Indianapolis shows. For sure, she was a good business person. Having a road to your Lodge is a plus. Flying costs are bringing campowners to their knees."
1276153,Mike Kansas,2011-02-28 08:29:00,1463,"GOOD LUCK...I had the same dream for many years. I looked at probably over 40 Resorts during that period. I would have needed to finance about 50% of any purchase based on Resorts of 700k or less. Havent looked for 15 years and when I was looking there were some nice places we looked at. I could never make the numbers work. By that I mean I just couldnt calculate what I thought was an acceptable ROI. I was told many times that resort owners dont make a lot of money on an annual basis but the growing equity in a Resort normally allows for a reasonable profit when you sell. Taxes become an issue at sale time and finding qualified buyers can be an issue also. One of my friends had a Resort for 20 years and everytime he sold it he got it back which became a pain in the rear after a while. Mostly because of lost customers because of poor service and ignored maintaince issues by purchasers. Have plenty of equity and avaliable cash for operation. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1278024,walleye4life,2011-03-04 14:52:00,54,"I think higher gas prices in time will take a bite out of the consumer but not immediately. High gas prices are really hard on fly-in operators (because typically the flying and gas when you get there is all-inclusive). The bigger issues facing the tourism industry is DUI's, Passports, and last but not least the exchange rate.... if the usd/cad exchange goes below .90 or so I would say that's probably the end of it for many."
1278071,v-bay gord,2011-03-04 16:54:00,3168,Good advice from Obabikon.
1278147,Moondog,2011-03-04 20:07:00,362,There is much wisdom in your post(s). Makes me want to come to your resort!!!! That aside....buying anything that requires 14 hour days plus and a smiley face is not for the faint of heart nor someone that is retiring from something else. When you retire you should be investing in something that has no risk or very little. IMHO
1279079,Obabikon,2011-03-07 10:04:00,2370,"Moondog, we'd love to have you! I agree that as a retirment plan, it probably isn't going to be affective. Right now you'd be much better served in putting money into something like silver or gold... and purchasing a cabin. But, if you're wanting to do a second career, this one is something that can be great!"

I have seen quite a few people that moved to our area and purchased a resort or other businesses and thought they were living their dream, only to be going out of business in a couple of years or wanting to sell. I never understood why someone would put that kind of investment into a business that brings VERY long hours dealing with the public and only make a meager income until hopefully they can sell for a profit years down the road. Not sure what kind of cash investment you are talking about but there a tons of good investments right now........ oil fields in ND for one. Good luck with your adventure and have fun!"
1276540,tv4fish,2011-03-01 07:24:00,2694,"I think Skywagon has a very good point - as that scenario has happened here in northern/central Minnesota. A lot of the old resorts have been converted into privately owned ""cabins""."
1276561,walleye4life,2011-03-01 08:16:00,54,"You're right the age of the clientele is going up fairly rapdily. The number of hunters and fishermen coming in the door in the states is at an all time low. Regarding the future of Canadian Fishing tourism: The people were there in the last 5 years. 09/11 put a crimp on things at the border, then the passport requirement and now the US dollar below parity... perfect storm. The people were there in the last few years my guess is if the exchange rate every is back to a reasonable rate people will not be as leary of going to Canada."
1276591,Mike Kansas,2011-03-01 09:38:00,1463,"Going to Canada is a privilege. I for one do everything I can to help promote my favorite Fishing Resorts to fellow fisherman. Our group goes to two Resorts who have both been in business for years and therefore have a solid repeat business. It is a great advantage to spend time at these Resorts who have the business and assets to continue their top notch service to their guests. If anyone is looking for an excellent Resort I suggest they review Lac Seul Lodge and Lost Island Lodge on Lac Seul. Best Regards, Mike Kansas"

1277851,Obabikon,2011-03-04 07:54:00,2370,"As an owner, and an owner who has purchased a resort in the past 5 years, I'm going to give some advice. There's a lot of things that go into a resort, and cause problems with a resort. First things first, you mentioned your son. It's difficult for a resort that is recently purchased to put the numbers into the ""black"". If you divide the small amount of profits by two... it can be impossible. There are no ""deals"" out there for a resort that's extremely profitable. It's the resorts that are struggling to pay the bills that can be had for a steal. Those are the ""good deals"", but you must be prepared to live off of next to nothing for several years. While working your tail off improving the resort, promoting the resort, and paying off the resort. With your son working, you do realize that you only get so many (actually a max of 2) work permits per resort. It'll be tricky for you, your wife, and your son to all be actively working at the camp. As suggestions go. If you are hard set on purchasing a resort, then purchase one that can be handled by you and your wife. 6-8 house keeping cabins. Take a few shop classes or outboard motor classes, and try your best not to spend money on staff. Do the math, and know exactly how many people on a weekly basis you need to..... 1. Pay the Bills 2. Make a Profit 3. Make improvements. One of the biggest problems with new resort owners is spending beyond their means, because they believe it'll earn them more moeny. ""Let's spend $10k on a cabin, and it'll be easier to rent. We'll make more money"" That's not true. Improvements are for the guests, not for the owners. Rarely does a resort improvement actually benefit the owner, except in the long run (10-15 years). Benefits. The life is great. But, a lot of people go into it thinking it's all fun. 14 hour days (or longer)... and you have to do it with a smile. No matter how bad your day gets, it can't translate to the guests. Otherwise, you'll find it harder and harder to get guests to return. Resorts bank on an extremely high return rate. But, you get to enjoy the beauty of the great northern wilderness every day. My favorite part of what I do is this: Every year my guests work incredibly hard to earn enough to come see us. They look forward to it for months. A lot of times, I get to be a big part in one of the happiest moments of their year... and depending on the fishing, sometimes the happiest moments of their lives! It's a great feeling to be part of so much enjoyment. If you love to fish, and you want to fish all the time... I'd say that it might not be the best of ideas. (unless you go smallter than 4 cabins). All in all... purchasing a resort in this economy is the exact same as making any other investment. It's a risk. The right owner, with the right resort will be successful... if they purchased it for the right price. Good luck, and if you have any unanswered questions, I'd be happy to try to help."
1277864,stinkycat,2011-03-04 08:22:00,2018,Great Post! IMHO
1277910,tv4fish,2011-03-04 10:02:00,2694,"Obabikon --- Can you ""transplant"" your philosophy into every resort owner?? There would be many more ""happy campers"" if you could. The biggest concern I would have about buying a resort NOW would be the impact of the increasing cost of gas. When the price of gas took its big jump about 3 years ago - we saw a dramatic reduction in the occupancy of the resort we go to and also in the number of people crossing the border, using the boat access, etc. I fear that same thing is going to happen this year. Yes, you might get a ""good buy"" on a resort, but you need clients to pay the bills."
1277922,Obabikon,2011-03-04 10:30:00,2370,"I'm not sure I agree. The gas price jump a few years ago was accompanied by the major downturn in the economy. This year, from what I've heard from other owners, is going to be an up year. That doesn't mean that the fuel costs aren't going to deter some people, but we're all at least aware of what fuel will do. If the cost goes up $2 per gallon from last year, and your group goes through 100 gallons of gas in a week (including driving and boating)... a $200 increase divided by 3 or 4, typicall isn't a deal breaker. People aren't as tight with $50 right now as they were 4 years ago. Just my opinion though."
1276179,eye-hunter,2011-02-28 09:48:00,435,"With risk comes potential reward. Sometimes there is no reward with risk  only losses. If reward came no matter what, it wouldn't be risky."
1276247,adempsey,2011-02-28 12:32:00,963,"Hawk Lake Lodge is a fairly high-end lodge [it's been on my to visit list for a few years now!]. Lodges like that seem to be few and far between. I'd imagine such a business would have been impacted far less than your standard drive-to lodge? People with money still have money. It's the average consumer that has to think twice about taking that 12 hour drive now. I'd assume purchasing a typical fishing lodge right now would probably only be wise if you had a lot of cash flow to keep things going until the economy really picked back up, which may take a lot longer than we'd all like. There are always ways to bring in clients if you keep future returns in mind. It would be interesting to know what type of business got hit the hardest the past few years. Family type resorts? Drive to fishing resort with housekeeping? American plan lodges? Fly in lodge? Fly in outposts? It seems like many people skipped one or more of their annual fishing trips over the past couple of years. Did they also skip the cheaper family vacations at the lake resort? or cut them down to a long weekend?I wouldn't even know where to start to try to find this information besides looking through the books from a slew of different places.All I know is nothing will stop me from going at least somewhere for my annual fishing trip!! Even if I had to camp!"
1276262,Golden Eagle,2011-02-28 13:25:00,2642,Fly in outposts have taken a beating. 6 man parties have become 3 or 4 people. Increased unfilled holes in bookings result in high priced flights going or coming empty. Not good. Bringing back spring bear season would help campowners.

Some places had 90% of there clients flying in from the U.S. or were doing mostly corporate type events with American clients. The American economy went south and so did there buisness. The fly in only stuff has had a tuff time with flight costs. In uncertain times people dont seem to travel as far so your drive to places seem to benifit from that."

I believe we would still be two yrs. out from actually buying, but I know there are a lot of things to check out. Me and my wife are not looking to make big money but I have a son who would like to get in on this endeavor also and I dont want to bring him into this venture and see him not make any money. We will keep discussing things."

1276488,Skywagon,2011-03-01 05:10:00,1106,"Just a thought, but the average age of fishermen coming to Canada from the US has to be increasing. Even though fishing has been a way of life here locally (north/west Ontario) even many of our young people are not showing the interest in the outdoors that their parents have. With that in mind, what are the chances that the flow of fishermen from the US will be maintained in the future as the current generation ages and many of the younger ones have other interests and places to spend their disposable income?My guess is that the down trend will continue, many camps will close and be bought as personal residences. Only well run camps on the better fishing water will survive. As Golden Eagle said, the cost of flying is getting salty, with local prices of $7.00 aviation gas by summer, the price of admission to get into the remote lakes will be prohibitive for some. Fishing trips to Canada will be a greater financial decision in years to come."
1276161,dutchboy,2011-02-28 08:54:00,5717,"Ted posted some great observations from his looking for a resort.What he didn't cover was what happens to your 20 years of working if this doesn't work? What if this isn't the bottom? What if we aren't on the upswing?I personally know a guy who sold his farm in Missouri. Came North and bought a place on the U.S side. This will be his 4th season. He has made it, learned some tough lessons along the way. Would he do it all again? I really don't know.Owning a resort is the dream of a lot of people on these fishing sites. Many people punch a corporate clock all their lives looking to live the dream. If you go ahead I wish you good luck. Just look at all the worse case scenarios along with the upside.Best of luck with your project. Remember there is no harm in booking trips to a lodge for 2 weeks every month as a guest vs being the owner!! Save you a bunch of heartache if things don't work."
1276164,Fisherman Ted,2011-02-28 09:06:00,461,"Very good point. Just like stocks or real estate can you ever truly time the best time to get in, or out for that matter? Nope.You need to minimize your risk as much as you can. In the case of a lodge its all about cash flow and customer base. Pull the financials on the lodge, ask around and do your homework. If a lodge owner can't make it work right now what makes you think you will do any better?So to reduce your risk the price needs to accomodate that accordingly which is one of the reasons why prices have fallen. With the reduced price (and hence debt carrying costs) will that be enough to cover you for a few years before things get better? What happens if the economy is still rocky? Lots of contingeny plans for sure.But yes, there is risk in life. That's for sure. With risk however comes reward (and not necessarily financial).All that being said my main point on all of this is that one shouldn't look at this as an investment in the same light as other investments. A large part of your reward will not be financial and one needs to ask themself is that enough for you and your family. What makes you happy? If I was looking for a long term investment I would be buying mansions in Florida right now at 30 cents on the dollar. No thanks!"

He was raised on a dairy farm, went to college (OSU) for dairy, and he worked for a dairy farmer after college. My Dad said a dairy farmer will always make a good camp owner. He knows the long hours 7 days a week with low returns and only hopeful for a good retirement plan.(selling the farm) They have no problem getting along with customers because it's just like working on a dairy farm. Everybody want your milk (for cheap) and it's hard for the small farmer to make any money. My Dad is always telling the story that ever hear of a dairy farmer making money if he butchers all his cows, so as a past farmer why would I let everyone come to this camp and butcher all the fish in the lake. I may be a redneck, but I ain't no stupid farmer and I know where the milk comes from.''(only as a joke guys no offence) This always brings some laughs and a lighthearted understanding of why conservation is important to a camp."
