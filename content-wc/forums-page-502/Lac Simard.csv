Not looking for campgrounds, a cabin that sheds water, has beds, and a kitchen and a shower is all we need. I found Driftwood...are there anymore?? Also if anyone has been there can they provide any info on the Pike fishing. Thanks in advance."

1280163,gpbrown,2011-03-09 12:49:00,359,Thanks guy's I found all web sites except Winnaway. Spoke with both Driftwood and Grassy Narrows people and they both were informative and extremely nice. I was hoping McQ would chime in as he seems to have a wealth of knowledge on Quebec fishing. Anybody heard from him lately? It's not that I don't trust the proprietors it's just nice to get all the unbiased opinions I can on the camps and the fishery. Thanks again.
