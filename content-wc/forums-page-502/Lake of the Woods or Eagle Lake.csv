1279158,klink7,2011-03-07 12:47:00,1,My son and I are going to either Witch Bay on LOTW or Century lodge on Eagle Lake the last week of June. I am looking for some feedback on either of these resorts and lakes. Thanks
1279166,Dodger31,2011-03-07 13:03:00,18,We have a big group that went to Morson on LOTW last year for the first time. We were very satisfied with numbers and avg size of walleyes/perch.Gas and minnow prices were a little steep on the water so now we know.It is a huge body of water so good maps or a GPS chip is a necessity! I suggest the chip so you always have a track to find your way home!We stayed at Red Wing Lodge and really enjoyed our stay.Have fun

If you end up going to Eagle I , personally, would hire a guide for the first day, minimum, and let them give you a feel for the lake.While I have fished Lake of the woods many times, i am not familiar with the witch bay area of the lake but i'm sure between a gps, the camp owner and a good map you should have luck."

I was there several years ago, same owners, Randy was great but the dad refused to listen at check out about the bill. Talked with Randy by phone the next week and refunded the $300.00 we were over charged. The fishing was good. I have fished every section of Eagle. You might want to look at Eagle Lake Island Lodge. If you want to drive a extra 70 mi. north I have a recomendation I feel has much better fishing ( walleyes, northerns, bass and muskies) and consistant. Send me a p.m."

1280439,Thumpr50,2011-03-10 06:41:00,139,"Have fished both bodies of water; my initiation to Ontario fishing was Eagle Lake in 1989 and went there for several years. Had some great years and some so-so; weather was the main factor on the so-so years. Have not been on the lake for 10 yrs so my experience is a little outdated. Eagle can be a tough bite a times. Have gone to LOTW for the past several years on a 5 day muskie trip with some friends; we fish walleyes to take a break and to have some for a meal. Rarely do we have a problem catching what we need. We are quite a ways south of the Witch Bay area; Big Narrows is about as far north as we go. Eagle Lake is big (66,000 acres) and LOTW is bigger; good mapping and GPS is definitely desired although I fished Eagle for several years with just a paper map & compass. Hiring a guide for the first day on both bodies of water would be a good investment. Pay attention not only to where the guide takes you but what are the features of the spots you fish. Is it rocks? Weeds? Sand/mud flats? There are thousands of spots with different features on these lakes; figuring out what areas are holding fish can be the key. Good luck!"
1280442,geareng,2011-03-10 06:49:00,335,"Have fished both lakes and we continue to go back to LOTW. It is the most diverse fishery I have ever fished. Last year caught Walleye, Sauger, Pike, Perch, Crappie, SMB and LMB all in the same week! Didn't try for Musky or Lake Trout, but plan on try for those this year. We stay at Rod & Reel; nice place , resonably priced and nice people. Never tried Witch Bay, but I hear good things about it."
