1279844,Moondog,2011-03-08 20:11:00,362,Beware!!! Taking gas to camp may really P.O. your camp owner. Remember they need some revenue too!! Could we please hear from Obabikon and other owners regarding this practice?

I didn't try to find it but I'm sure the Search function will pull it up for you.Be aware, many camps/resorts do not allow gas - other than that in your vehicles and boats - to be stored in camp. Lots of liability and/or insurance issues associated with caches of fuel in camp."

I would check to see what the cost difference is first to make sure it's worth it, as some years it was cheaper for our guest's to buy from us than to bring it with them. We will be selling our gas at last season's price to start and adjusting the price when we need to buy more. So depending on when your trip is, the camp price could be less. So I would check with where you are going and see what they will be charging for gas."

Anything over this amount will be charged a duty."" For some this incuded the gas in the boat tank and for other's it only mattered on the extra cans bought in. So like they said it was up to the guard at the time.Our only rule is that you have to store your cans in a seccure area. This would be like in the back of your truck, we have had problems of guy's lining up about 20 cans right by their cabins and this is a real safety issue, especially if they smoke.The duty per gal. is .50 to 1.00 a gal. Our guest usually save about on avg. .75 per gal.On the down side this happens all the time. When the guys get to camp when it is very warm, the gas expands in the cans and leaks or the lid pops off and spills or leaks in their boat. My thought on this is, is it really worth the extra $10 or so per guy after you look at 1 The extra time and being pulled over and have to go in to stand in line and pay the duty.2 Is it worth the risk of it spilling in your truck or boat, or the smell that gets on everthing if it leaks.Remember its your fishing trip and time is everthing when you are on vacation.You can always call ahead and ask how much gas is per lieter.(Conversion is 3.78 lieters per gallon) Hope this helps."
