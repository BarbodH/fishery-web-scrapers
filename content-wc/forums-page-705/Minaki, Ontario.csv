557210,ragtag,2006-05-13 22:28:00,19,Any body know this area? Going up in June and would appreciate if I could get my hands on a contoured map. Also any information on the area and also any spinner baits for Pike that you recommend. How difficult is finding Walleye going to be. I know it is a part of the winnepeg river system. I have not fished rivers for walleye very often. Does it fish like a lake in areas? Thanks for any information!
557224,Guest,2006-05-14 13:00:00,0,Buy a navigational chart Minaki to White Dog has everything you need. It maybe the Winnipeg River and there is current through it but it fishes like a lake. Its some pretty big water. There are river areas betwwen Little Sand and RoughRock and south of Minaki.Anything works for northerns but I would try a white spinnerbait first. Anything used for muskies works fine for northerns.

However, the narrow sections have very strong current and can be difficult to fish, but most of these areas hold walleye. The navigational map is great (I have the same one). You can pick it up at a sporting goods store in downtown Kenora. I forget the name of the store, but I'm sure someone else on here can post it or another location to get one."
557235,Guest,2006-05-14 21:31:00,0,"I agree that the white spinnerbait is good for pike, as is other bright colored spinnerbaits. You can order the Winnipeg River topographical map that the Canadian Hydrographic Service created, which are map 6287 and 6286. Here is one link for map 6287:http://www.fishingmap.com/shop/paper...to-kenora.html The other map link for map 6286: http://www.fishingmap.com/shop/paper...to-minaki.html I fish mostly smallmouth with tubes and grubs, though a small spinnerbait will work. Good luck, Don C"

Everybody I know has there secret spots, but in reality if you know anything about walleye it's an easy place to fish. The crowds go one way , and I go the other, and once I have my limit I'm heading back while others are stuck on sticking it out in the crowds. In June they are really on the move to the big lake so if my fav spots are not producing I throw on a spinner and pick a direction, and head that way. Definetly get one of those maps they are a must out there. Make sure you check out Rough Rock. Nice walleys and tons of pike up there."
