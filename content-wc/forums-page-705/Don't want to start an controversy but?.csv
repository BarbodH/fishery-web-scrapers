This guy was thrown off his college for drug use, failed the NFL drug test multiple times and popularizes the ""whizzanator"" but is not a felon. Sorry I don't get it."
557254,jigman 2003,2006-05-15 10:55:00,981,Weed is not treated as though it is a huge evil like here in the states. They've figured out it is a waste of money to through every kid with a couple ounces of weed into prison and spend $40K a year to keep them there.
557257,Guest,2006-05-15 11:41:00,0,But he wasn't driving a car when he was under the influence of a whizzenater. LOL!
557259,Guest,2006-05-15 11:51:00,0,"Was he ever charged with anything? just because he fails a pee test that doesnt give him a criminal record. Criminal record would require a pardon. Toronto Argonauts are looking at contracting Ricky Williams,, again failed many drug tests but hasnt been charged with anything!"
