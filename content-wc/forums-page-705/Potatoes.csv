557205,Guest,2006-05-13 20:38:00,0,Just curious what people have tried to take potatoes into Canada. I know it is illegal to bring in baking potatoes but I was wondering if anybody has fried them up in the states and vaccum sealed them to take across. This would be legal wouldn't it. then all you would have to do is warm them up. I have heard of people bringing up the canned potatoes. Scott

About the same senerio as the beef ban and mad cow disiease. Most fruits and living plants are banned for this same reason, going either direction across the border. Processed potatoes are acceptable, wether they're canned or you cook them yourself. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
