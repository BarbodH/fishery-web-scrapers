We are going to Tobin lake in early June and wondering if some of you that have fished it would be willing to share some good areas and some tactics used that we night try. We are staying on the river and taking our own boats. We are looking forward to the walleye action, but to latch onto a big pike would make our trip as we don't have them around our area in the states. Thanks for any info..the more the better"
557298,Guest,2006-05-16 08:45:00,0,River might be a bit fast in June....they have had a alot of moisture up there this winter/spring. I would head out on the big lake....head to the flats and fish Pike. Stop at Thunderbird lodge (I think that is what they call it now) on the east end of the lake and they will set you up with herring. The flats are a short boat ride from there. Clarkie

Last time I was there we just used a big J hook thru the lip of the herring and trolled it real slow with the electric motor. Next time I go I will use some kind of ""quick strike"" rig with more than 1 hook in each herring. Good Luck!! The pike fishing up there is a blast! Clarkie"
