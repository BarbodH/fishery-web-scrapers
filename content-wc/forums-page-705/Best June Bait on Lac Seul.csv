557266,Guest,2006-05-15 13:58:00,0,guess it's going to be crowded a bit. :-) I just talked to someone there named Judy and she assured me it is in my name. Wonder what they have going on up there? We have been following some gentlemen from Kentucky each year that bring thier own boats...is that your crew Gary?
557268,Guest,2006-05-15 14:03:00,0,Its awful early on our trip to get you and it took 5 days for you to take the bait but you know I have great patience when waiting for a good bite...YOU ARE GUTHOOKED. Grand Master Elite
557269,Guest,2006-05-15 14:06:00,0,"The bad thing is I had just a little twinge that it could be a practical joke, namely by you. You got me good, we sure will miss having you with us in June."
557270,Guest,2006-05-15 14:27:00,0,"Euker, You silly boy. You know that without me you boys would be eating Spam instead of Walleye every night and it would be a waste of your time to go out on the water and fish. If I remember correctly (and I always do)the only thing you knew about Walleye fishing before I joined you was that other people caught them and you had heard they were good to eat. While it is true that you had the reputation of being the ""Pike God"" it is also true that a reputation like that is equal to being a Member of Clinton's cabinet or Hillarys speech writer."
557271,Guest,2006-05-15 15:08:00,0,Dont know you Euker but it appears just like your cousin Bob Euker you may have been catching too long without a mask and caught a few on the forehead. Appears to me that if the GME is going to hurt you any worse he will need a fillet knife.
557276,Guest,2006-05-15 15:24:00,0,"Ouch...you called it. GME has a way of sneaking up on you from behind and making the most of it. Guess he learned that while raising sheep in Iowa. That's the rumor anyway. It's sure not the first time he has gut hooked me, won't be the last. He is a classic. If you want to meet him, you can fill in for me on our annual Lac Sel trip next month. I could use the respite. My high blood pressure can hardly take one more week of the abuse......."
557285,Guest,2006-05-15 20:22:00,0,"Dear Ouch, Euker is almost too easy to get. I think his lack of avoiding being an easy target is caused by the fact that he has spent many years getting kicked in the head in self defense class....he doesen't understand the difference between being a punching bag or delivering percise injuring blows. But he does accept harrasment much better now than he use to. But he needs to accept it better ...it becomes him."
557106,Guest,2006-05-10 15:38:00,0,"Going to Lac Seul for the first time 6/10/06 for a week. Any help that anyone can give me about bait, presentations, depths or just plain catching Walleye would be greatly appreciated. We will be fishing the North Central part of the Lake (Black Bay Outpost)"
557115,Guest,2006-05-10 20:41:00,0,"We have had our best luck using 3/8 to 1/2 oz white glow jigs with about a 2"" plastic tail, tipped with a night crawler. Northern Tackle makes the jigs we use, and we buy them in bulk. We go a few days later than you, and most years we catch them in 5 to 11', last year we couldn't keep them off the hooks in 5 to 7' of a grassy area. Don't be afraid to fish shallow that time of year. Ron"
557116,Guest,2006-05-10 21:05:00,0,"Go with as light of a jig as you can, especially in shallow water. We rarely use a jig of 1.8 oz. Occasionally on a windy day we will go to 1.4 oz."
557120,michigan eyes,2006-05-11 07:58:00,7,"We Outpost the 1st week of june every year...Seems like we go through 20 dozen minnows the 1st 4-5 days or so but a 1 lbs. of leeches was also good last year especially when it's warmer (early spring like last year.) We have found many good spots by casting cranks up in the shallow ledges etc. on the calmer evenings then we camp out on the spot jigging using meat. Seems like the crawlers work good to some years but we only bring 3-4 dozen or so. This covers us (4) guys for the week we outpost pretty good it seems, however we usually catch our bigger fish on crankbaits casting/trolling etc. I heard the smallmouth pop. is increasing but any of us in our group has never caught one in (9) yrs. Hope this helps any Looks like its cooled off a bit up there, (3) more weeks, can't wait! ME"
557122,Guest,2006-05-11 09:47:00,0,"I'll tell yas hows we dooser in the Great White North. 3/8 Jigs whatever colour works for yous. 12 pound test line for those narly fat boys that keep ripping off your jigs. The fattest minnows (chub-chubs) to medium works well also... If fish are active, hook minnow threw the head. Sometimes I'll use a stingers if the little fishies are cleaning me out. If inactive, I'll hook my minnow through the tail. This drives the walleyes crazy. Let the minnow do the work. Also I'll use minnow/crawler combo.. My recipe for the fat boys... During a tourney I'll go thru 6 dozen minnows a day...But if I'm leisure fishing I'll pick up my usual 3 dozen. This works well when crawling or when still fishing (anchored). Windy conditions and drifting I'd hook the minnow through the head. Or try spinners..... Happy fishing Mista Walleye"
557132,Guest,2006-05-11 15:58:00,0,Dont you kid yourself. Mista uses anything that gets to the bottom as long as it is HOT PINK.
557156,Guest,2006-05-12 10:26:00,0,"Heyyyy, Your giving away my secrets... Pink and white is my favorite jig combo... Someone knows me too well.. It's funny, I've had a couple of people from Red Lake asked if I was Mista W... Mista W"
557168,Guest,2006-05-12 13:43:00,0,"I personally always liked big juicy crawlers and never saw a time on Lac Seul in 28 trips that I couldn't get fish to go. The bigger, fatter, longer, fresher-----------the better. I am not one of these guys who need to carry all the baits, however there is one bait that does rank even better then crawlers, that's waterdogs----if you can find them."
557172,grt1,2006-05-12 14:34:00,259,not to mention it's illegal to use them in Ontario
557256,Guest,2006-05-15 11:35:00,0,"Hi Gary, thought you might want to check your dates. I have Black Bay reserved for that weekend. Wondering if maybe you wrote your dates down wrong....good luck...jr"
