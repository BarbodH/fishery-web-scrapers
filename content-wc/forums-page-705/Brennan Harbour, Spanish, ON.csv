In early June the fish are just starting to come out of the Spanish River into the flats at the river mouth. Casting jigs for concentrated fish and pulling crawler harneses behind bottom bouncers for searching does the trick.The fish don't seem to be fussy about colors. I'm not much of a pike fisherman but people do very well in June. I haven't fished the smallmouth either because the season is closed when I go. Nice, comfortable camp run by good people. Shorty, the dock hand has lived in Spanish all his life and can tell you where the fish are any time of the year. Let me know if you need more info."
