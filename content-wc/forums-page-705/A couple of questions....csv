557331,LeeHawk,2006-05-16 21:04:00,12,"I am always pleased with the number of sincere responses I receive when I post a question on this site. Thank you! To answer some questions: 1. ""Dr. Lee"" is a nickname I have been given after serving 11 years as a superintendent of schools in Sheboygan Falls, WI. I have a Ph.D. in educational administration from the U. of Iowa and remain a Hawk fan after 26 years in Wisconsin. I am living proof that a guy with an average IQ can, after spending a lot of time and $, get a Dr.'s degree. 2. Thanks for the feedback on Long-Legged Lake Resort; it is also referred to as North Lake Resort. It used to be a fly in, but a logging road has been opened and now you can drive 40 miles west of Red Lake Road and boat in about 30 minutes to the camp. American or Housekeeping available. There are a series of lakes available to fish with the furthest from camp being about a 45 minute run. Walleye, lake trout, northern pike are all available. Looking forward to the adventure. The guys I fish with annually in Ontario like to fish different water every couple of years. So be it. 3. Thank you for the advice on an extended trip to Ontario. I think the best advice, for me, is to spend a couple of weeks at two different camps. Will be a nice compromise to fish a couple of different lakes and still have time to learn about the lake(s). 4. Trailer Guy: I will be at Wabaskang late in July with my son. We took your advice (earlier post) and have booked at Sleepy Dog. Thank you for yor help. I have talked to the camp owner and he seems very friendly and helpful. I would enjoy meeting you this summer...your cabin must be pretty close to Sleepy Dog. 5. I appreciate the email addresses a couple of you guys have sent me. I will be in touch to get more info. 6. Finally, I have looked at the web site for privately owned cottages that are available to rent long term. Very interesting. I will pursue that option, as well. Again, thanks for the assistance. To quote another ""poster"" on his site...""I wish I was half the man my dog thinks I am."" Regards, Dr. Lee"
557337,Guest,2006-05-17 06:13:00,0,"Dr. Lee, I am also transplant from the GREAT state of Iowa. There are quite a few of us living on the lake shore. My oldest sons and I make it down your way fishing for musky on Random Lake in the fall. My family has been staying at Deer Trail Lodge on Eagle Lake for a number of years and there have been guests who have stayed for a couple of weeks up to a month at a time. This will be our sixth summer staying there. I have stayed at other lodges and other lakes, but seem to have found a nice comfort level with the place we currently stay. A little advice, if you are staying long term look for a lodge fairly close to a town and have a plan as to what type of fishing you wish to do. Every lodge and lake are different and it pays to ask questions. Good luck, I'm aure you'll find something that works great for you....Joe"
557343,driftersifter,2006-05-17 08:35:00,109,I have fished longlegged lake for about 10 years or so and have fished various lakes in the same area. I'm a teacher in Cornell wi. I have relatives in Iowa But rarely admitt it. The fishing on longlegged is tough sometimes but easy others just like the rest of Canada. I suggest you start out trolling rapalas in 8 -10 feet and troll shorelines looking for that big school then turn around and jig it to them. As mentioned there is a lot of variety in that system of lakes. I prefer the lake to the north of the bridge. I will be in the area after the 5th of June fishing some of the smaller lakes nearby. If you need more specifics let me know. Driftersifter
557350,Hump,2006-05-17 11:11:00,578,Is it true that the only time Wisconsonites use a designated driver is when one of the wives gets pregnant? Just curious. Love ya from us Iowans!

557353,Hump,2006-05-17 12:16:00,578,That's not very nice!
557354,jigman 2003,2006-05-17 12:19:00,981,Neither was yours. You should hear the stuff I have for those wonderful people from Illinois.
557364,Guest,2006-05-17 13:54:00,0,"Two families were having a feud. One family lived on the Wisconsin side of the border between Illinois and Wisconsin, and the other family lived on the Illinois side. The feud got serious and the Wisconsin family started throwing sticks of dynamite across the border into the Illinois farm yard. One day, it put the eye of a cow out. The Illinois family became so incensed that it started lighting the dynamite sticks that the Wisconsins had thrown over, and throwing them back into the Wisconsin family's farm yard. Sorry....a little cidiot humor"
557365,Hump,2006-05-17 14:49:00,578,Actually I stole that from Jeff Foxworthy.
557391,Guest,2006-05-18 09:28:00,0,How many wives can they have in Wisconsin?
557227,LeeHawk,2006-05-14 18:29:00,12,"First, I want you to know that I buy something, car, boat, dishwasher, etc., then I read Consumer Reports to see how I did. Duh. Same deal: I have booked a week long trip to Long Legged Lake Resort off Red Lake Road and now I am trying to determine how I did. Duh. Information would be great...primarily walleye with northerns for an occasional change. We will be there the first week in July. Secondly, I am retiring in December of 2006 and will be looking for a month long rental in northern Ontario in the summer of 2007. Will I have any luck booking a regular camp at a reduced price if I am there for a month? I am thinking the last 10 days in June and the first 20 in July, for example. I will need a pet friendly spot (I have a highly trained hunting dog/companion), will bring my own boat, and would be willing to pay extra if one or more of my kids/friends join me for part of the rental period. I can't tell you how fired up I am about this. Thanks in advance for any advice/counsel! Dr. Lee (Will provide email address for more detailed information, solicitations, etc.)"
557230,Guest,2006-05-14 20:52:00,0,"I don't have any experience with Long legged lake resort in fact never heard of it, but I do know you will be hard pressed to find a good resort that can fit you in for a whole month if you are looking to rent a cabin. Many of them are booked up year after year by the same group of fisherman. Ocassionally there are cancellations, but thats a week here and a week there. I would suggest to start looking now for next summer. If they don't have repeat customers year after year I am not sure I would want to go. I would kind of wonder why they don't want to go back. I do envy you though. I be gald to string two week together not alone a whole month. I hope you find what your looking for. Dr. Lee...Just what are you a doctor of? Brent"
557232,Sutsgold,2006-05-14 21:13:00,219,"Brent, depending on when you want to go next summer I may know of a place for you. Email me at [email protected]"
557233,Trailerguy,2006-05-14 21:23:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I think you could get a reduced rate for a month long rentatal, by starting to search now. I'm not sure the largest most popular resorts would be interested, but there are many smaller resorts that would probably be interested in booking a cabin that far in advance. You certinially have time to learn a new lake/lakes in a month. I know an outfitter who has a long standing party that has stayed a month or more in his camp later in the year. By the 2nd week in July through early September can be a slow time, and many camps have a reduced rate schedule for that time frame. Pm me, I'll give you some leads. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
557240,jerry bark,2006-05-15 06:50:00,822,i have a lead for you also if you want to go north of the sault. jerry
557242,Guest,2006-05-15 06:53:00,0,"If I were looking for a month long rental Id be looking for a private cottage rental,, not a resort,, this way there is flexibility in dates and price is negotiable.. do a search for ontario private cottage rentals, there are many sights. Ive had luck on this site. http://www.ontariocottage.com/"
557243,phishfearme,2006-05-15 07:02:00,1242,"dr lee - doing a seach on this site will give you a little info (this doesn't sound like a walleye trip) but asking the outfitter for some references who were there last year at the same time as your trip would be best. and also ask him for contact info for people who will be returning the week before you go there. it may be tough lining up one resort for an entire month (people frequently rebook the same week every year) - but why would you want to? try three or four resorts (too many lakes and too little time) and report back on this site the results! best of luck, phish"
557247,Guest,2006-05-15 09:13:00,0,"I know of the lake and the resort. I haven't stayed there but have been in the area for many years. They work very hard to provide for your needs. The lake is fun to fish and have a nice variety of fish, walleye, pike, musky, and lake trout I think. It will be a pleasant adventure. Enjoy."
