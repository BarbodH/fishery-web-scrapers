The only benefit is a reduced cost to service our government debt, which isn't anywhere near unmanagable, so losses outweight the gains by a mile. While we pleasantly smiled taking the ribbing about the value of our dollar, it fueled a huge economic boon to Canada. Certainly someone is making extra profit cause the stuff we import from the US hasn't dropped in price at all."
557246,Guest,2006-05-15 08:07:00,0,"i've always been reluctant to comment on this dollar issue. as you can see by the comments, some canadians take great pride in the rise of their currency. at the same time, some americans see our decline as the end of the world as we know it. it only hurts americans when you are a tourist. it should greatly help american exporters and hurt canadian exporters. bush has taken a pretty much hands off approach to the dollar in the exchange rate arena since becoming president. if canadians are not seeing a drop in the cost of our exports to you then canadians are getting screwed by the importers."
557265,rpieske,2006-05-15 13:24:00,1276,"Did anyone notice that the Foreign Trade Deficit most recently announced was far lower than in the past. There is a direct correlation between the value of the dollar and trade. When the dollar is high, no one buys our goods. When it is low, our goods are more attractive. When our dollar is low, employment goes up to meet the need to produce more. There are good and bad effects of swings in our currency. If you are going to blame the president for the low dollar...then you should give him credit for low unemployement and increased trade in American goods and services. Personally I think who is president has minimal effect on these swings."
557275,Guest,2006-05-15 15:18:00,0,i noticed that and thought it was particularly remarkable since we are importing this astronomically high priced oil. must have really cranked up the exports to overcome that deficit.

As a side note, I wonder how much gas is being sold at Fort Frances with the dollar difference, I would assume everyone is crossing to the US side to fill up."
557137,HoosierAngler,2006-05-11 21:26:00,3,Not only will it cost more to get there.... $1.00 Canadian = 0.90 U.S. I just read today. Ouch..
557138,bigfish1965,2006-05-11 21:33:00,3210,Actually $1.00 US = $0.90 Can.
557141,Skylane,2006-05-12 05:32:00,101,"Hoosier Angler has the correct answer on the exchange rate. I asked my neighbors (when if was in Canada this winter) if they had seen American made products come down in price, they answered no. I would assume the Canadian middleman is pocketing the difference, at least in some cases. Seems it is hard to win no matter what side of the border we live on. Would be curious if any of you Canadians on this board have seen any benefits on a local level, or only by crossing the border?"
557143,Jig A Lowe,2006-05-12 07:21:00,87,"NO, actually, $1.00 US = $1.09 Canadian. But, the US dollar is certainly on a downward spiral."

I've certainly seen no difference, but I haven't really watched to see specifically what items are made in the US or not. My boat and motor were made in the US, and perhaps that was why they could afford to have the 'special' they were running.THe rise in the dollar should ahve off set alot of the rise in the price of oil for us, but it didn't. Since we buy oil in US dollars, it should be much cheaper than it is now. As for the correct exchange rate...wait till July. It is almost certainly going to be at par or less by then. The Bank of Canada has hinted that it won't match the US interest rate hikes expected through-out the year in order to bring downt he Canadian dollar. Here's hoping."

557162,OntarioAngler,2006-05-12 12:07:00,46,I heard on the radio today the Canadian dollar in 2002 was only 62% of the American dollar. Wow only 4 years ago the banks would charge $1.50 canadian to purchase a dollar US.
