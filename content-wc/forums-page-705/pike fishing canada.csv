557280,OntarioAngler,2006-05-15 17:33:00,46,"I get my material from a guy in Woodstock, ON called Angling Outfitters. (519)539-5494 I would think most tackle shops would carry the Gamma or Seagar flurorcarbon in that large of test. The metal crimps are heavy duty and you crimp it about seven times. The 130# stuff is about $5/3 feet. Darren"

557128,loco,2006-05-11 13:59:00,3,going to ontario first time pike fishing. are the wire leader still the thing to use or do they have somsthing better now? thanks for any help Randy
557130,pikemike,2006-05-11 15:28:00,95,"i still prefer the steel wire. buddy of mine was rigging up in the boat with a $10 titanium 24"" bragging about how expensive it was, he gave it a quick tug and it broke! he cursed, tied up again and the next one broke at the snap! Maybe they've gotten better but i still don't trust them."
557131,north_alabama,2006-05-11 15:29:00,172,"I believe wire is still the standby, but some people do use heavy (~80lb) fluorocarbon leaders for muskies, and toothy saltwater fish."
557134,Guest,2006-05-11 16:17:00,0,Has anyone ever heard of tiger line? I have looked for it and cant find it anywhere.
557135,robwillfish,2006-05-11 17:24:00,13,I'll be in Ontario fishing for Pike as well...I always use 25 to 50 pound fluorocarbon leader tied to PowerPro...I don't lose many fish...my fishing partner landed a 39 incher last year on Fluorocarbon...tried steel the first year...hated it. That is all.. Rob
557136,Square1,2006-05-11 20:20:00,46,I use a titanium leader tied on to 50 to 80 pound Power Pro. I've been using the same one for 6 years now (I had to replace the snap) and it's the best thing going in my opion. I throw alot of soft plastics and the pike just hammer it from any angle.
557142,jerry bark,2006-05-12 05:43:00,822,"wal mart near me has ""tyger"" leader material if that's what you want. it appears to be braided wire that can be tied into a knot like mono. cheers jerry"
557149,Guest,2006-05-12 09:06:00,0,Thats it.Thanks Jerry.
557164,OntarioAngler,2006-05-12 12:14:00,46,"Anymore lots of guys and televsion hosts are promoting flurocarbon leaders mostly because the fish cannot see it and when the pike rolls around during the fight, the fluoro wont chew the heck out of them (like wire leaders) This is especially important if you are catch and release fishing. I use 65 lb steath with 130 lb Gamma flurocarbon leader. The two are connected using Berkley wire leader connector sleeves. Like to see a pike or musky chew through that!"
557209,pikemike,2006-05-13 22:12:00,95,i'd like to see the pike that could chew through that also! i'd give up my steel if i found somethin i thought was dependable. where do you get your material?
