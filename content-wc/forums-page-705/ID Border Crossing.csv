556978,Guest,2006-05-08 14:30:00,0,"We cross the border with drivers lisc. and birth cert. and have no problems at all, Bring them with you and just hand them to the officer, it makes life so much easier. good luck"

556985,Guest,2006-05-08 15:01:00,0,"Actually, it will be December 31 2007 when you need one to get back into the US. This year and next year a DL will work fine."
556988,Guest,2006-05-08 15:37:00,0,"You need to have some sort of ID. They have only ever asked for my ""ID""... and I have always shown them my driver's license. That was always enough, so far. I also carry my birth certificate just in case."
556991,Guest,2006-05-08 15:45:00,0,Thanks for all the info. I will have my DL and BC with me. I just hope I have the right lures. Thanks Again
557222,Guest,2006-05-14 12:02:00,0,Does anyone know if a passport will work with a DL in place of the birth certificate? I would prefer not briging the BC (it's old like me and not in the best of shape).
557223,north_alabama,2006-05-14 12:42:00,172,"Getting back into the US, a passport alone is sufficient (birth cert established US citizenship, DL is identification, passport does both). Passport is actually preferred these days. I believe the same is true getting into Canada, passport or DL+BC."

He blew out his lower back. They had to fly to Baudette Mn. and go through customs there, it was a good thing he had his birth cert. with him!"
