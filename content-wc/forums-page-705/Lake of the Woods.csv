556854,Guest,2006-05-04 06:58:00,0,Looking for die hard Musky fisherman. I am heading to Canada June23 to July 1 and July 14 to July22 and am looking for someone to share an cabin for the week. Ideally looking for one person or two people with one boat. The cabin is located south of Wiley Point and north of NW angle. The cabin is situated on prime fishing water. I have been fishing this area for ten years and know the area well. This would be a great opportunity if you are fishing Canada for the first time. The cabin cost is $50.00 per person per night. Do not miss this opportunity. Email me. [email protected]
