Or language to that effect. I answered ""No,"" because I have never had any symptoms (nor have I ever tested positive). The app then took me on beyond that to the rest of the questions. But does anyone know what comes up, what happens if one answers ""Yes,"" meaning ""I have had symptoms sometime between 14 and 180 days prior to crossing the border?"""
6594588,Eckohlt,2021-09-03 10:57:00,3685,Why would you worry about what happens if you answer yes if you haven't had symptoms?just be truthful it will all work out.
6594604,StonyRun10,2021-09-03 12:04:00,12,"Who has intent to be dishonest? Not me. But inquiring minds want to know. Some folks don't have one (an inquiring mind), I guess. Be helpful or be quiet, I figure."
6594670,Eckohlt,2021-09-03 17:24:00,3685,"Good luck with your trip,hope you inquire plenty of knowledge up there and catch plenty of fish."
6594998,Skiball,2021-09-05 20:39:00,82,I was positive with 180 days and nothing happened. I just went through the quarantine questions and it processed everything without any problems.
