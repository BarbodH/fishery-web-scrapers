6593108,OldFootdoc,2021-08-27 20:28:00,393,"Good evening friends... I did not think I was headed to Canada this year but my son tells me we have plans. We typically go up to Ontario for 4 days in September and cross the border in northern Michigan at Sault Saint Marie, north of Mackinaw. We have each been fully vaccinated with no covid history and I understand I will need my Ontario fishing license, my vaccination card but I am not clear on the testing required or any other requirements. I also know I need to have a mask on when approaching the border crossing and when I am in public in Ontario. Is there any link that gives us an efficient list of what is needed and expected? Thanks in advance for sharing your knowledge..."
6593118,valley366,2021-08-27 21:18:00,193,Many posts on this forum to read but will provide a couple links.Must have qualified COVID test within 72 hours of entry. Note they only allow certain tests make sure you choose the correct one.Must also do the arrivecan entries.https://travel.gc.ca/travel-covidhttps://www.canada.ca/en/public-heal...arrivecan.html
6593142,BuckeyeATC,2021-08-28 05:35:00,88,"Passport ArriveCan App info filled out Negative Covid Test within 72 hours of crossing the border. ( I would recommend trying to get the ID Now test at a local Walgreens. Test takes about 5 minutes in the drive through, it is free and you will most likely get your results in 1-2 hours) Covid Vax Card(s) Pretty simple process for the most part. My wife, daughter and I crossed at the Soo about 3 weeks ago and my parents just crossed at the Soo yesterday with no issues."

6594272,sledman,2021-09-01 21:01:00,13,"So I am crossing tomorrow with my 3 year old and not sure how to add him on my ArrivCan app since when it asks for additional travellers, it requires a passport, drivers license, etc. ANyone cross over with a minor have any advice on how to add them on as a traveller? Thanks"
6594494,Bigtaproot,2021-09-03 04:58:00,900,Go to Walgreens or cvs and get pcr rapid test Ours took 36 hours from test to results Fill out arrive can app within 72 hours Electronic proof of test is ok and was accepted by border If you get random test the wait in not long but you need internet. Go to Tim Horton or Mac Donald's for internet access We got random test and wait was under 15 minutes They will aggressively ask how you feel
