6595022,valley366,2021-09-06 08:53:00,193,Fished out of Five Lakes Lodge on Gullrock from 28 August to 3 September.Border crossing going both directions was no issues and as reported asked for COVID tests and ArrivCan app on the way up. On the way back was standard questions and line was about 5 cars deep at noon on Saturday.Fishing was great. A bit of an adjustment from our normal spring trips. Fish were concentrated on islands and mid lake humps more than the normal shoreline points. We spot locked on top of fish several of the days and caught 15-16 inch fish pretty much steady. On Friday to stay out of the wind setup on the north side of an island and don't think we moved more than 50 yards in 4 hours. Burned through 5 dozen minnows. Most were in that 15 inch range with a few overs mixed in.First time being up there in the fall and considering making the late August the standard trip in the future.

6595032,johnboat,2021-09-06 09:30:00,2014,Thanks for the report. I'm going in 3 weeks. Hoping for much of the same with a few Big'ens mixed in.By then the water should calm down after the traffic from the Red Lake Classic goes home.How's the water level?
6595094,valley366,2021-09-06 14:45:00,193,Probably about 2 feet low. Looked like about 2 foot black stain exposed on shoreline rocks.
6595118,pattmit,2021-09-06 16:03:00,36,Thanks for the update. Sounds like a fast action trip. We are up there 9/25-10/2. Do you remember the water temp? Ready for a nice freeze before we get up there for the big fish to start putting their feed bags on
6595168,valley366,2021-09-06 20:18:00,193,Water temps were in the mid 60's. We probably did our best in the 22-26 FOW water range for decent fish. Bigger fish tended to come from the 30+ range.
6595234,tparker,2021-09-07 07:48:00,100,Thanks for the update. We'll be there this Saturday. First time up there in September.
