6595220,Balzy,2021-09-07 06:49:00,76,Can you purchase a Manitoba Outdoors card when you buy your fishing liscence?
6595240,Huntindave,2021-09-07 08:15:00,2194,Don't understand the question. What is a Manitoba Outdoors card and when did this go into effect? Is this similar to the Ontario Outdoor Card?
6595244,Balzy,2021-09-07 08:33:00,76,Yes or doesn't Manitoba have an outdoors card?
6595250,BIGbmuskies,2021-09-07 09:22:00,9,I live here and have never had a card for Manitoba. Used to be a paper license. Now it is online and I take a screenshot. Hope that works.
