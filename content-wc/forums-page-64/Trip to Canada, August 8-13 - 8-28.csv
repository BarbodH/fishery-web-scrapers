Drove to the border at Pigeon River. 1 vehicle in front, no vehicles behind. 10 minutes later after interview requesting only passports and proof of negative Covid test. Very polite. Told the Border Guard how much we appreciated being able to enter Canada. Paid alcohol duty and headed to Thunder Bay and the Hampton Inn. Good dining next door with cold beer. Good nights sleep. Saturday a.m. Headed to Kakabeka Falls and stopped for 1/2 flat of night crawlers at our usual place. Paid with US funds and requested no refunds. Provided the owner with container for our crawlers. Look term customers. He was appreciative.Headed west from K Falls to Upsala and the home town cafe for home made oatmeal, home made bread/toast, and 2 over easy. Left the waitress a $10 US tip. She was thrilled. On to Ignace and the local grocery for 5 loaves of Canadian Rye + eggs and milk, and gas fill up. Used credit card with $1.00 U.S equal to $1.30 Canadian. $6.00 per gallon Canadian. Small credit card transaction fee. Exchange rate to our benefit.On 599 north to sign for Press Lake Camp. 15 miles of logging road off 599 for a 1 hour drive. Not dangerous, just very slow with potholes galore! Been doing it for 15 years. Ho Hum. Cabin clean as a whistle. Great hosts! Indoor bath with shower. 2 bedrooms for 2 guys. Queen beds, Owner waived 4 guest minimum so paid for 2 guys. Launch included. Cheap ice. One dock per cabin with electric post for trolling motor. Deck with sand beach and dock 25 yards away. 24 hour electricity + wifi. First week: Around 50- 70 walleyes daily and numerous disgusting northern pike (some pretty big). Lots 18 and over 20. Wind cut down on numbers a bit with short hits due to drift speed. Reefs were loaded with big schools. Locator was accurate and drifts were easy with Humminbird way points. 26 to 30 feet consistent fish.Second week: Sunday, Monday about 70 walleye daily. Next 4 days wind was an issue but large schools still on the reefs at 25-30 feet and many 18"" and 20""+ with largest at 24.5"". Also big northers near 25-30"". Probably around 40-50 daily on walleyes. Walleye nightly at camp: Corn Meal, Cajun, Regular, and Buffalo deep fried in peanut oil. Nice sides. 95 degrees F. every day first week. Dropped into the high 60's and low 70's the second week. Great! Never did put on our rain suits! Wow. Left Sat. a.m. and drove to Rice Lake. US Border crossing was a piece of cake, as usual. Nice visit with guards. Over night at Holiday Inn and great dinner at Lehman's. Nice gulf shrimp! Home to Sheboygan Falls around mid afternoon on Sunday. 19.6 MPG towing my Alumacraft with my Honda Pilot. 1,550 miles round trip. Have been fishing Press Lake Camp for about 15 years, and this was in the top five for numbers and size. Back next summer in July for 2 week, God willing and the creek don't rise.I love Canada. Many great friends made over the years beginning in 1987. Thank you Ryan, Barbara, and Lindsay!!!Thanks for opening the border Mr. Trudeau!Doc Lee"
