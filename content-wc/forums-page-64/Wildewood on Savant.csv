Got to meet Pooch who helped me with maps and his years on the lake and then met He Who Hooks Himself later in the week. We caught a lot of solid walleyes (you hear people say keep the 16” to eat and if that was the deal, we would have starved as the average were in the 18-22” size and fat like smallies). Fish were mainly at 15-20.’Andy, Todd and Lori who own it are top notch, excellent facilities and boats with 2 dozen minnows for you every morning and the 3 mile trek into the lake off 599 was good as no weight limit and it’s the only easement onto the 25 mile long lake which could take years to explore. Crossing at Pigeon River we were the only car and it took like 3 minutes no problem. I’d go back in a heartbeat and they are great hosts / owner operators."
