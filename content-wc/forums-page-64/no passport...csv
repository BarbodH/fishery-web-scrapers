As We are crossing the border next Friday (11th) around noon, We believe He can use His Birth Certficate and Minnesota D.L. (along with the ARRIVECAN info ) HOWEVER, He is very worried about getting back into the US the following Sat (18th) ... Has anyone had this experience before? What is the trick ?"

If uncomfortable with, perhaps a call(s) to the border folks would help, tho I sometimes have heard that they don't always give same info. Bill"

6594860,Half oz jig,2021-09-04 20:09:00,4,"Same thing happen to a buddy a couple years back.Going into Canada, all you need is proof of citizenship and a piece of Government issued photo ID. So, Birth Certificate and State Drivers license.the states of Minnesota, Michigan, New York, Washington, and Vermont have Enhanced Drivers Licenses.Americans with an Enhanced Drivers License (EDL) can be allowed to travel to Canada without a Passport.Make sure his DL is an Enhanced one, otherwise bring along a Birth Certificate for back upReturning State Side, Technically, you must have a passport to enter, HOWEVER, if you can prove your identity, such as the above items, an officer will never deny an American from entering the Grand ol' USA. You may need to spend a few minutes in the office at the border to go through the process, but you'll get home."
6594870,eyemike,2021-09-04 22:33:00,233,"2 years ago I misplaced both my wife's passport and my passport the day before we were heading for Canada. Never did find them. We took birth certificates, and showed our drivers license. We had no trouble going to or coming home. Coming home the US border agent smiled and said to me ""In the future let your wife handle the documents."" I had to agree! I was really worried crossing, but, was treated well with no delays at all. Mike..."
6594888,Obabikon,2021-09-05 06:28:00,2370,"He will be allowed back into the US. It is common (especially right now), and the guards will be aware of these situations. Might cost you guys 10 minutes at the border, but that's the worst case."

Those were some of the best trips I’ve ever taken to that part of Lac Seul. Hopefully, I’ll make it to that neck of the woods in 2022.Your bud can rest easy on coming home. Everyone else has already commented on what I would have mentioned.Best Wishes,PjShorthorn"
6594928,jimirjr,2021-09-05 09:25:00,1149,"GOOD NEWS ! He had also applied for an ""ENHANCED D.L."" from Minnesota... He received that late Sat. We are good to go... as long as we are all NEGATIVE covid cases..."
6594930,Baseline,2021-09-05 09:42:00,3207,"A couple years ago I forgot my passport. I stopped by the US customs prior to entering Canada at I-Falls. The border personnel told me as long as I was a US Citizen and could prove it with an ID like a drivers license. Crossing back into the US I had no problem using my DL for ID. The Arrive Canada app requires you to upload a photo of your Passport so I don't know how you buddy will be able to do that. I went to Canada a couple weeks ago and showed my Passport, Vax Card and Negative test documentation. I asked if they wanted to see the Arrive Canada App and he said now, but they did scan the passport. I didn't have any problem entering. A friend of mine in another vehicle crossing at the same time but was at a different booth was told to park and had to wait while they verified his data. He had downloaded, but didn't upload his passport of vax card into the Arrive Canada app. So your buddy may get some extra scrutiny when entering Canada. The US Border guy told me to take a photo of my passport and DL for future use just in case I forgot it again. Not a bad idea for for everyone who travels a lot to do."
