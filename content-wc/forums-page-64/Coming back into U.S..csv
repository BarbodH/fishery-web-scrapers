6594270,johnboat,2021-09-01 20:58:00,2014,Nice! Glad you had a good trip and hope you saved me a few.
6594582,ackermannsacre,2021-09-03 10:50:00,196,"Had to cancel our trip to Gull Rock this year. Have two weeks reserved for next year, how was the walleye fishing?"
6594614,eyecatcher1,2021-09-03 12:30:00,323,Just curious johnboat. How did you keep your streak alive last year? My 27 year streak was broken last year due to covid.
6593286,Walleye2242,2021-08-28 15:48:00,263,"I follow the laws put in place so if I am checked at any time by an officer doing their job, that catches hunters and fisherman that poach and break laws....i have nothing to worry about."
6593288,troutwater,2021-08-28 15:54:00,299,"One year the US border agent seemed rather annoyed when we said we weren't bringing fish home. When we said no he replied, ""You mean you went all the way to Canada and didn't want fish!?"" We explained we were fishing muskies and he just said ""oh"" and sent us on our way. I've never been checked by the MNR or by US fish and game, but I've always liked seeing the CO's on my local lakes."
6593652,fishingMN4eyes,2021-08-30 11:10:00,108,"Same for us on 8/27. Thankfully we got in before it looked like it was starting to back up behind us. Keep your Canadian fishing license and ID handy, the agent accepted a copy of my license on my phone. We vacuum seal all of our fish in clear bags so it was pretty seamless for us. I feel bad for anyone who had to unwrap all of their fish."
6593676,guidedfishing,2021-08-30 12:19:00,531,We arrived at the border pigeon river cross US customs at 11am on 8/28. There were no vehicles in line. No MNR checking lic & fish. Were asked routine questions on where we were what we were bringing back. As that was going on another agent was looking in the back of the truck and boat. We were handed our passports and told to have a good day. Total time at border less than 4 mins.
6593678,v-bay gord,2021-08-30 12:28:00,3168,Good to see in this day and age that some professional cooperation can exist.
6593694,eyecatcher1,2021-08-30 13:36:00,323,"We passed through at International Falls at 11:30 AM August 23 without a problem. Agent asked if we had fish or anything purchased in Canada. He then said ""Welcome Back"" and we were on our way. Didn't even take a minute. There were no other vehicles in line either."
6593704,3M TA3,2021-08-30 14:30:00,2846,"What was the point then? Counting fish and not looking to see what they were. Lets see. 10 suckers, 10 Crappie, 5 this, 5 of that. Something seems amiss. Sounds rather fishy to me."
6593708,3M TA3,2021-08-30 14:40:00,2846,Good friend retired from the SSM crossing he said in 32 years not once did he inspect fishing license's or fish returned to the US. Perhaps it's more unusual depending where you cross.
6594022,lassh,2021-09-01 08:33:00,553,i've been going for 43 years and this was the first time when fish and Canadian licenses were inspected. We crossed at Pembina MB. Officer was professional. He actually had me show him on a map where the cabin was located. He had positive comments on our packaging and labeling.
6594218,drlee,2021-09-01 18:32:00,409,The only time I had my vehicle checked going back to the US was when the border guard wanted to pet my Brittany in the back of my Pilot.
6593212,Fishin Fun,2021-08-28 09:23:00,218,No. They just counted fish and didn't actually look to even see if they were walleyes. I did see some other travelers that had their fish wrapped in paper and they did open them.
6593214,Fishin Fun,2021-08-28 09:24:00,218,Fishing was awesome. Probably the 2nd best fishing we ever had. Water levels are down. They have been terribly dry too. Probably 2-3ft lower.
6593216,Fishin Fun,2021-08-28 09:25:00,218,We were wondering the same thing I guess. They were professional and patient with everyone that I could see.
6593220,Huntindave,2021-08-28 11:12:00,2194,"No different than traveling out of state to fish or hunt anything. You come back into your home state with a dead deer on the hood, you better be able to show that it was legally taken. Going out of the country, then returning, and/or it being fish instead of a deer, is no different."
6593228,Wallychowder,2021-08-28 11:37:00,1567,I wonder if the Canadian MNR fish&game would check a Canadian coming back into Canada that was fishing lake Vermilion in Minnesota ? Hmmmmm. &#x1f914;
6593236,Obabikon,2021-08-28 11:57:00,2370,The US and Canadian border services have an agreement to check for eachother going the opposite direction. If the US guard finds something out of miss... he calls the Canadian MNR officer and that officer arrives at the border to issue you a ticket.
6593258,Eckohlt,2021-08-28 13:30:00,3685,Gotta have rocks in your head if you live in Ontario and head south to fish Minnesota.
6593262,Baseline,2021-08-28 13:55:00,3207,"I had my fished checked once by the US Fish Checkers after clearing the border. Another time the US Border guy asked me the usual questions while entering, but didn't ask if I was bring anything back from Canada. I said ""don't you want to know how many fish I have?"" He said, ""those fish belong to the Canadians not me."" We both had a laugh and I went on my way."
6593282,eyecatcher1,2021-08-28 15:27:00,323,I agree!
6593284,Bill Krejca,2021-08-28 15:45:00,6107,"Yup, reciprocal game checking agreement for years. Checking on the way back not that unusual for both sides of border. Bill"
6593076,Fishin Fun,2021-08-27 18:39:00,218,We just came back into the US today from Gull Rock Lake and US Fish and Game was checking all of the boats coming back into the US making sure everyone had the correct Canadian fishing license as well as number of fish. They were asking everyone to pull over to get checked. Must of had 2 years of quota to meet.
6593098,That Minnesota guy,2021-08-27 19:34:00,8293,Or they were doing their jobs.
6593102,Fishin Fun,2021-08-27 20:02:00,218,Just have been crossing the border for over 30 years and had never seen that before. No complaints. Just for people to be aware of I guess. I understand they are doing their jobs.
6593104,That Minnesota guy,2021-08-27 20:10:00,8293,I'm sure there are less people this year leading to more time for thorough checks. Glad to hear things are moving smoothly on both sides of the border.
6593114,Pooch,2021-08-27 20:55:00,4618,We were stopped (pulling boats) 2018 and 2019 just after we turned south onto 502 by game warden. Checked licenses and coolers. No big deal. We sat and visited for a while as there was little traffic.Just keep your licenses and coolers easily accessible.Pooch
6593134,Shellback,2021-08-28 05:20:00,8083,So Ontario requires you to leave a piece of skin on the filet to identify it. Did the US fish and game look to see if you were following Ontario regs?
6593138,johnboat,2021-08-28 05:25:00,2014,I'm heading there Sept 25th to keep my 21 year streak going. How was the fishing? Water level?
6593140,Wallychowder,2021-08-28 05:31:00,1567,I often wonder if they have people drive through that pole building with the X-ray machine now days ? I believe it was closed for many years ! You never know whats under those boat covers ?
6593188,Eckohlt,2021-08-28 08:22:00,3685,Could be a lot of crawlers under those covers.
6593206,x4flatfish,2021-08-28 09:08:00,319,Why would US fish and game care if you had a Canadian license and check your fish count? Seems to me that any checks would be on the Canadian side....
