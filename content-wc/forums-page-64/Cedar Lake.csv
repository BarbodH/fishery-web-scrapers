6593720,MotorPike,2021-08-30 15:30:00,5,I 2nd that question. Was curious about the same thing. Heading to Wabaskang on the 12th!
6593744,prov1800,2021-08-30 17:38:00,5010,Lol.Its a regular lindy rig.I use 4 ft of floura and a straight hook.Tiday I used it with a 3/8 oz split shot.Dropp it to bottom and ì do 2 full turns on reel to get minnow just off the bottom and rest it on gunwhale or ill put in rid holder.I can see minnow on sonar.Real simple.and deadly.Put 50 walleyes in the boat today in between muskie fishing.Really good bite today in around 23 ft.
6593780,prov1800,2021-08-30 21:51:00,5010,Great day on Cedar today.4 muskies and around 50 walleyes.
6593796,Eckohlt,2021-08-31 04:09:00,3685,John that looks like about a 5ft long Muskie in the pic.

6593818,Bill Krejca,2021-08-31 06:18:00,6107,"Nice fish. re: vertical rig - I use same setup, but a bullet sinker and a variety of bait, mostly artificial, at the end, works great. Sometimes the fish will hit from underneath and bite is very subtle/hardly felt at all, especially if they go up with it, a long rod works best for sweeping the hook set. Hand held rod works best if not using live bait; it pays to keep a constant eye on the depth sounder, as bait will unknowingly be dragging on the bottom if it gets shallower. Bill"
6592920,prov1800,2021-08-27 08:15:00,5010,Decent day on Cedar yesterday.Took off from Clarks in a nasty looking weather day.Was already spitting some rain so on went rain gear for only second time the whole season so far.Fished my close spots but ventured all the way to east end.Fairly windy day also.So along my way did see more boats than I have seen so far.Most seemed to be muskie fishing also.Plenty of space and I did have my spots all to myself.Saw 7 fish and hooked 3.2 got off so ended up with one.Lost a good one trying to net it By myself.If you've never tried that you should especially with a bigger fish.Its a tough job.But enjoyable.spent last hour catching walleyes one after the other.Had 4 eaters in no time but had grabbed around 3 doz minnows at clarks in morning and figured I'd fish a while.Used them up in about a hour.Smaller eating sized fish but kept me going.Jigged a while and was ok but but verticĺe lindy rig was night and day.water temps around 65 f.Found good schools in 23 ft and left deeper fish alone.Definatly a fall feel here now.East end water is all green.west end still clear.My new lure worked well.
6592950,Twodogs,2021-08-27 09:32:00,115,Your new lure look like the stinging caterpillar all over social media lately ....We were to fish Cedar Lake two years ago out of Cedar Point Resort. Have rebooked for Spring of 2022. Going up in two weeks to LDML..always enjoy you post .
6592960,prov1800,2021-08-27 09:56:00,5010,Just needs hooks.lol.You will enjoy Cedar Lake.Hopefully everything will be more normal.The one pic I posted is Cedar Point Resort
6592988,Eckohlt,2021-08-27 12:06:00,3685,"The minnows are your ticket to a fresh dinner of fish,gotta love the price lol"
6592994,prov1800,2021-08-27 12:12:00,5010,The price was good.Self serve though.lol.I did use a vibrato for a while.It worked but not fast.But liked the strike.
6593020,Bill Krejca,2021-08-27 14:05:00,6107,"Thanks, John, surprised the water temp was that cool with all of the hot weather you have been having. Bill"
6593038,prov1800,2021-08-27 14:42:00,5010,Our heat wave has been gone about a week now Bill.Overnight temps are like 10c with highs of 15c. Lots of wind so churning it over.Next week decent weather.See water color in east end.
6593154,Bill Krejca,2021-08-28 06:33:00,6107,"Yeah, I noticed the green, seems fairly typical for time of year on a fertile body of water. No problemo! Glad it is cooling off! Bill"
6593382,prov1800,2021-08-29 09:03:00,5010,And wet now Bill.lol.Lots of rain forecasted now.
6593702,Carnhzkr,2021-08-30 14:19:00,964,"John, can you explain how you use your Lindy rigs vertically? Vertical jigging and pulling a Lindy rig, I understand, but it sounds like you're combining the two. Do you basically use a walking sinker and a short leader on a Lindy and fish it like a jig?"
