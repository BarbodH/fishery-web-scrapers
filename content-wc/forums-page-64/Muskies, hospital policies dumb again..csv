6592910,MDH,2021-08-27 07:21:00,6,"LOTW Nestor Falls 8/16-8/21 The muskies are dumb again. We didn't have many shots at big fish, but we caught the heck out of them. Pressure was higher than I expected. Some of those reef complexes were likely already seeing 4-10 bucktails whiz overhead a week in. Crossing was easy. Trying to get stitches was not. Freak accident, Muskie tooth sliced my opposite thumb very badly first spot of the morning. Lots of blood. Fort Francis would not treat Americans unless life threatening. Nurse was yelling all this to me through glass doors of the âisolation room' I was in doing my admittance over the phone. Now panic sets in. Risk not getting back in due to no test if I went to IFalls. What would my partner do? My boat was at the government dock still! Turns out there is a pop-up shop rapid test in the Falls. Make appointments over the internet. Seemed like the earliest was 3-4 hours out. So we crossed and went there first to see if we could get tested early. The place was dark, no one around. The staff at the hospital was awesome. The doctor gave myself and my partner a test, we had results in a half hours. We were able to cancel the rapid test saving us $160 each. We'll see if insurance foots the bill for the hospital test. I do wonder if the Canadian policy is such because the American hospitals are just a few miles away. Line would they have treated me in Kenora? Back to camp at 2:30 with 6 stitches, a case of beer and lots of water. I'd have to guess. Fun trip. It was hot a ****."

6592936,troutwater,2021-08-27 08:50:00,299,"Crazy story. Two years ago my PB muskie straight up bit my right hand...that was a mess. She even was snapping at me in the net when trying to unhook her. We superglued my hand and wrapped the **** out of it. The camp manager(who is also a nurse) strongly recommended heading to Dryden for stitches, but never did because it was a hot bite lol. Now I have a nasty scar on my hand. Glad you were able to get fixed up and back across. Where were you staying at on LOTW if you don't mind me asking?"
6593410,mms3rd,2021-08-29 10:41:00,148,"Couple years ago, a northern shook its head and put the hook through the web between my thumb and forefinger....2 of the treble hooks. First time in 50 years of fishing it happened. Because of how it was wedged, I couldn't get it out. Went to local hospital and they pulled out the ""get a hook out kit"" and the nurse shouted, ""first one of the season."" No prize. It happened again the next year, but I had wire cutters."
6593784,Aspencreek,2021-08-30 23:32:00,2911,Another couple of good reasons for me to not allow those snot rockets in my boat or even in the net!!
6593786,prov1900,2021-08-30 23:51:00,544,"Had that happen to me with a pike. Husky Jerk, two trebles in the web and one still in the pike. Pike flipped off the hook and one of the hooks backed out of the web. Took pliers and tried to push the hook point through after cutting the other two off so I wouldn't have a repeat. No go....about passed out LOL. Off to ER. That web is a terrible place to catch a hook. That skin is tough! I crimp down my barbs now when pike are around in numbers."
6593902,NM_Trout,2021-08-31 14:18:00,1094,"Ouch... glad this worked out as smoothly as possible. I'm shocked that a highly socialized country with their vastly superior health care was unable to stitch you up in an ER. I bet you could have made an appointment for November if you hadn't been so unreasonably antsy to get stitches I got sliced by a pike years ago, and it wouldn't stop bleeding. went back to camp to clean and dry it and put it back together with super glue. Got a sweet little scar and a story too.Congrats on the great fishing!"
6593910,Skywagon,2021-08-31 15:38:00,1106,"NM-Trout, you are behind the times, now we have to make an appointment for a telephone consultation with the doctor first to determine if we qualify to get an in person appointment. I am not kidding. Socialized medicine is great!"
6593916,NM_Trout,2021-08-31 15:50:00,1094,Isn't there an app for that? Perhaps a tik tok challenge to get you a better place in line maybe?
