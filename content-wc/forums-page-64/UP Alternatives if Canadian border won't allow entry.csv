He's never needed one before as he has a state issued ID and birth certificate. As I was attempting to do the ARRIVCAN thing online for him, I find you cannot proceed without a passport number. I called the inquiries number provided and the guy who answered said if he is an adult he must have a passport. I tried calling the Ontario border folks at the SOO (where we cross) and could not get a live person to talk to. So, we are just going to try to cross and see what happens. However, if we are denied entry, I am thinking we will try to find some lodges in the UP, preferably American Plan. Does anyone have any suggestions? Thanks in advance."
