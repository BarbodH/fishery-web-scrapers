6595310,skap,2021-09-07 13:20:00,58,"I was concerned about it closing again as well, but I was looking online this weekend and Canada is still moving forward with opening borders this week for those traveling from the EU. I think had they stopped that I would have been pretty concerned, but with that moving forward as planned I think everything is good to go for awhile. Also worth noting, Canada posted their results from the random testing at the border between Aug 9th and Aug 26th. They had only 112 positive tests out of 58,878 for a .19 test positivity. They acknowledged that is low positivity rate and even with cases rising in Canada it was still very manageable. That said, I tells me that there is no reason we should not be allowing Canadian visitors to travel to the US as long as they are following similar rules and regulations with vaccinations and testing."

""The U.S. State Department is now urging Americans to ""reconsider travel"" to Canada due to what the Centers for Disease Control call ""high"" levels of COVID-19 infection.""https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/corona...-cdc-1.5567392"
6594100,brown1317,2021-09-01 12:51:00,74,I saw that this morning too. Probably pi** off Canada and they will shut the border down again.......
6594102,MikeAnkeny,2021-09-01 12:59:00,67,That what worries me.
6594474,warefisher,2021-09-03 00:24:00,5,Me too. Getting ready for a solo trip to eastern Ontario on the 18th and hoping they stay open.
6594500,Wallychowder,2021-09-03 05:57:00,1567,I think if the US keeps the border closed come September 21st that Canada will more than likely close their border again !
6594534,Obabikon,2021-09-03 07:37:00,2370,"Zero chance of that happening at this point. Canada is enjoying the revenue coming in, and nothing going out. They aren't going to close. Especially given that a new government will have just been decided. If Trudeau wins, he will credit opening the border. If a conservative wins... no chance they're going to close things."
6594650,djk50164,2021-09-03 14:29:00,370,Why would you close a boarder that is only open to vaccinated and pre-covid tested individuals? Seems to me that would be exactly what you want threw your boarders.
6594662,prov1800,2021-09-03 16:16:00,5010,Exactly
6594674,Obabikon,2021-09-03 17:35:00,2370,"It is not closing down anytime soon. Even if delta explodes, they are not closing it. First... the entire point of closed borders was to prevent the spread of new variants. They know that didn't work. Every variant has still gotten into both countries and spread around. So, they are going to try to entice some people into getting vaccinated in order to travel, and at the same time, try to save their economy. Secondly... even if they were going to close the border again (which is still incredibly unlikely), it would have to be AFTER the election. If Trudeau wins, it will be because he opened the border. It is unlikely that he would then immediately close it after winning the election. That would be an enormous black eye. If O'Toole wins, he will keep it open, because he is pro small business. The US (at this point) are the clueless ones. Unfortunately, they can't seem to come up with a plan. I personally believe it is because there are laws preventing the government from asking you certain medical questions. So, when they do open the border, I think it will be TRULY open. That's why they are going slower... they won't be demanding proof of vaccination or negative tests."
