Going into Canada, presented passport, Covid-19 Vaccine card & paper copy of negative COVID -19 test. Coming back to USA presented passport only. Masking required & no indoor dining. WALLEYE FISHING WAS FANTASTIC!!! BEST EVER IN 17 YEARS of going there!!! Jig & minnow in 18-21 feet! Very few boats on the lake! Lake is 4 feet low. No problems following safe travel routes. Neighboring resorts did not open for the short season. Felt very safe in regards to Covid-19 precautions & was happy to oblige! Can't wait to return next year! RBF 👍❤️🎣🇨🇦"

6594716,shortmag,2021-09-04 05:16:00,70,"Just back from Lac Suel, similar border crossing with less than 5 minutes going in and less than 3 coming back. We had all info as above. My first time on Lac Suel so I have no reference as to catch rates other than other lakes in the area. Fishing was lights out a couple days and excellent a couple and good the rest. We declined fishing one day due to wind/waves. Need to qualify this trip was with my wife."

6594766,rather-be-fishin,2021-09-04 11:14:00,429,Spot lock jigging vertical moon eye jigs 1/4 to 3/8 oz in 21 feet or trolling with jigs in 18 - 28 feet with minnows worked great for us!
6594830,dakota eye,2021-09-04 16:19:00,69,"Thx buddy, will be out fishin tomorrow."
6594832,rather-be-fishin,2021-09-04 16:29:00,429,Good luck & enjoy every minute! I sure did!!! RBF 😎
6594880,shortmag,2021-09-05 05:28:00,70,"We found fish at 14 -16 feet on days with a chop and 28 - 22 on calm, sunny days"
6595086,dakota eye,2021-09-06 14:18:00,69,"As promised, fish mostly 21-23 feet. On windy days found them in 15-17 feet guys."
6595238,rather-be-fishin,2021-09-07 08:13:00,429,"I forgot to mention that the average size of the many Walleyes we caught were 20-25 inches & very FAT Walleyes. Also, we caught many in 17-18 inch range for freezer fish to bring home. Caught very few under 15. Caught more Northern this year than usual & a huge one that bit a hole through the other boats net & got away. Caught 30 & 32, & two 27 keepers and several in 23-27 range & were NOT fishing for them. The resort owner said that the very FAT walleyes is an indicator of early Winter. 😵*💫 We normally go to Lac Seul the 3rd week in July. We enjoyed the cooler weather & no biting black flies, so changed our trip to the last week in August before Labor Day again next year! RBF. 👍❤️🎣🇨🇦"
