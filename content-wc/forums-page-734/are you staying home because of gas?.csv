551692,Guest,2005-08-22 17:13:00,0,"Let's do some math to put this in perspective. My trip to LOW is 1500 miles round trip. Pulling my boat I get abut 13 mpg. That means I burn 115 gallons of gas for that 1500 miles. The price of gas is up $1.25 a gallon or so, which means I will spend an additional $143 for those 115 gallons. The total fee at the camp (with camp gasoline for my 150 Opti, 12 nights stay for my wife and me, a flat of crawlers, a pound of leeches, 3 GREAT meals a day, maid service daily, daily fish cleaning and freezing, etc.) comes to about $3400. I figure the additional $143 ain't gonna break me if I can afford the $3400. I'd rather NOT spend the addtional $143, but it is only another 4 percent of the total package cost. It is an even smaller percent when one adds in meals on the way up, t-shirts purchased, etc."
551562,Guest,2005-08-17 16:38:00,0,the price of gasoline is of little consequence to the experience of a fishing trip - when you work all year -whats a couple of bucks more?
551569,grt1,2005-08-18 06:16:00,259,"Just a quick note to tell you the price in Red Lake is $1.06 a litre, or $4.77 a gallon. that is canadian dollars so you can convert this price to us by dividing by the current rate of exchange and don't forget the canadian gallon is 1/6 larger than the US gallon."
551599,phishfearme,2005-08-18 13:58:00,1242,"you may want to check your math. there's 3.79 liters per gallon so the cost is a tad over $4 canadian per gallon or about $3.35 US per gallon. ""this $2.50 a gallon gasoline makes you want to choke on your $4 latte"" - b. maher phish"

551606,orchard frank,2005-08-18 15:49:00,1900,"This is the first year we aren't going to Canada since 1989. Not because of gas, just a year off. To make myself feel better, as of yesterday, have fished Little Bay de Noc and Big Bay de Noc 56 times since spring. 6 over 30"" so far and fall isn't even here yet. But I love the Canadian experience and will be back at it soon even if gas is $5 a gallon. Good Luck"

551611,1shooter,2005-08-18 19:03:00,1493,Gas could double I would still go on my annual Canada trip. However I can guarantee I will not be making as many trips to Northern MN.

We will still be making our second trip to Tobin this summer...but we probably won't be making quite so many trips into Nipawin to go to Dairy Queen!"
551518,Guest,2005-08-16 17:38:00,0,"we are going to gullrock lake the first week of sept..are there any of you, say from ill., not going to canada to fish because of the high gas price?. we are going there no matter what! pepe."
551521,Guest,2005-08-16 18:33:00,0,"Which is why gas prices are skyrocketing, we will continue to do whatever we want, whenever we want to do it. That's the American way. Good luck on your trip!!"
551522,Guest,2005-08-16 20:01:00,0,Are you kidding. You think an extra $150-$200 in gas is going to keep me away from fishing in Canada....LOL. I'll just have to buy four less cases of beer...
551528,Nimstug,2005-08-16 23:57:00,2605,"My son and I are still planning on going to Rainy Lake, in about three weeks. We've talked about this since the first of the year and have put the money aside. I'll have to see how much over estimated our gas is. Perhaps in the month, with the so-called driving season over, prices will ease a little but I still expect them to be a buck a gallon over my preliminary gas cost. My greater concern is what i see when I look beyond the end of the fishing rod. It's not just gas money for getting to work or the fishing hole.Many things we buy such as food, clothing, household goods, building materials and travel (including trips to visit the daughters in L.A. the Florida Keys) likely will see a higher price due to the cost of shipping and fuels. We may have to put them off for awhile or stay shorter. I can see us taking a little longer to save for those items we were condsidering purchasing say over the next 6 months or so. We'll really try to maintain the contributions to the IRA/403b. We will adjust our thinking on needs vs. wants. Somethings will have to trimmed back or eliminated. We'll probably make some decisions that we can make do with some old items. If enough families do that the economy starts to slow down and a slower economy could effect jobs.

551544,2746,2005-08-17 10:17:00,3206,"Read a recent article that pointed out, when adjusted for inflation, gas would have to reach $4.00/gal to equal the prices we paid at the last crises. The article's conclusion was that we would have to see gas at or near that price before people began to stay home, curtail travel or trade in the SUV for an economy car etc. If prices keep rising maybe we'll get a chance to test his theory."

551546,Guest,2005-08-17 10:43:00,0,"as i said before we are going to go. we have made our plans last winter and paid our deposit. so we are going to go, but it might stop us from going next year. we""ll probably just go to lake erie and have just as good a time. the fishing wont compare, but its a lot closer. if gas continues going higher canada will lose a lot of people that lives 900 miles away. pepe."
