551623,Guest,2005-08-19 09:44:00,0,"As I mentioned in my earier post - educate yourself on this matter. For example, the ""Opps, Insurance"" comment shows you truly do not know the facts. As far as the area being in trouble, I have spent enough time there to understand the problems - THIS IS EXACTLY WHY I AM SAYING THE PROPERTY MUST MOVE AS FAR AWAY FROM POSSIBLE FROM THE ARCHER GROUP AND THAT THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT IF THIS HAPPENS. It's a well known fact the business's in Minaki need that property and VICE VERSA!!! I really don't know if this is the mentality in the Kenora area but there really isn't anything we need to bicker about - I really feel for the creditors who deserved payment as per their arrangement with Archer, but please understand, many of the creditors contributed to this problem to begin with - with their workmanship, billing cycle, and disrespect of Mr Archer's bank account. Phil could have handled the PR thing a little better, but if people were stealing from you, would you continue to empty your bank account?? EXAMPLE The golf shack was to cost $80,000 and the billing came in at over $200,000. His excuse was the price of wood went up...WOW!! or A certain construction company bladed an 8 foot wide trench across the Number 1 fairway to lay down a 4 inch pipe. or A certain construction company was hired to install pipes in the basement of the lodge - many feet a pipe were installed and upon further inspection by an engineer, the pipes were capped at both ends. or A painting crew was found sleeping in one of the hotel rooms at 11:00 am in the morning - they started working at 1 pm and they billed that day for 10 hours that day. When I asked them about this they said, ""the boss said to make the job last - the owner (Archer) is 'bucks deluxe' from Calgary"" Blame Archer all you want...but please move forward..."

551638,kenoraonca,2005-08-20 04:26:00,19,"I can pretty well believe your statements on some Kenora biz's doing exactly what you have said. Seems ""that"" is Kenora's attitude in many cases. Paint a building with a 1 inch brush when it could be spray painted. Just an example. I needed a cheap puter. Around town and various on line swap shops, I got quoted anywhere from $400 to $500. I just bought it on line out of Toronto for under $200 including shipping. Sure might take 5 days to get here, so what. I am not worried about guarantees as I can fix anything in that area. But I got it much less no matter. I seldom shop in Kenora for much of anything except my groceries and since Wal-Mart has opened I have noticed some lower prices on a few things. About time. We have been getting the shaft from the retail sector here for years. You know yourself if you follow the paper. Everything this city has built over the past few years has run into a higher price than originally quoted. Like everything. One million becomes a mill and a half. Why? Those doing the job figure everybody (city coffers included) has deep pockets, and wants in on it. This will never change. One thing never changes. No service. Go into nearly any store. Try and purchase a product. Heck, the person (clerk) knows absolutely nothing about what they are selling. Just the price. That's it. Want it? Give me you credit card and get out of my store. IF you happen to pay in cash, it's funny. Thank goodness the cash registers today total everything and tell what the change is for a $20 $50. The clerks cannot add, subtract etc. etc. Some couldn;t make change for a buck and get it right. Kenora at least has a bad attitude too when it comes to tourists. They want them, yet they do not. Those travelling through with trailers is only one part. (cannot park here or anywhere else) Boat parking on the waterfront, parking downtown, etc.. We need some drastic changes in thinking here if we are to be a #1 destination for the Tourist Industry. Go to the junction of Hwy 71 and the Trans Can. Watch how many turn right and head up to Red Lake and that direction. Quite a few and it's been that way for years. This area is missing out on fantastic tourism possibilities mainly because of greed and certainly lack of vision. It's all lumber this and lumber that. If this mill goes down, maybe they (Kenora) will take a better look at our tourism down the road, but we need changes in City Hall before that happens. And if the mill shuts down as they figure it will the area will be hurt a bit, not as drastically as some predict, but none the less hurt many retail biz's. Who knows what will happen? I do not have a crystal ball."

551440,Guest,2005-08-14 15:05:00,0,"Ethics and Morals and Scruples Oh My!! Sale of Minaki Lodge will wait for decision Ontario Superior Court Justice Peter Jarvis reserved judgment in the Minaki Lodge trial Thursday, after hearing arguments all week on who will be entitled to proceeds from its bankruptcy sale. By Mike Aiken and Peter James Miner and News Friday August 12, 2005 Ontario Superior Court Justice Peter Jarvis reserved judgment in the Minaki Lodge trial Thursday, after hearing arguments all week on who will be entitled to proceeds from its bankruptcy sale. Jarvis said he would issue his decision soon, but gave no date for resolving the debate which involves more than an estimated $7 million owed creditors. While Kenora attorney James Hook argued local contractors with liens worth $1.2 million for their work should be paid first, lawyer Roderick Johansen disagreed, pointing to a mortgage with Celestine Mortgage Corporation. The sale of the property was ordered by a bankruptcy court last November. After taking developer Phil Archer to task during cross-examination earlier in the week over his management practices, Hook dismissed the mortgage in place, saying there was a lack of financial records. Archer also is Celestine's president. This is not a normal mortgage. In my submission, this is a sham, Hook stated. The historic property, located 50 kilometres north of Kenora, was bought by Archer for just over $1 million in 2002. However, the Alberta businessman authorized extensive renovations, before arranging for a $5-million mortgage on the property. Heavy losses resulted from a slow tourist season in 2003, combined with delays in the approval for plans to develop condominiums on the site, as well as a tragic fire that gutted the main lodge on Thanksgiving Sunday of the same year. Investigators were unable to determine the cause of the blaze that gutted the site's main attraction. Despite numerous setbacks, Hook also hinted Archer is still trying to buy back the remaining assets which include the hotel rooms and may try again to develop the property, particularly if the receivership process allows him to get away without paying his contractors or investors. Archer's lawyer Johansen countered that while Archer did in fact operate all four companies -- the Archer Group, Land Development, Minaki Lodge 2002 and Celestine -- there was nothing untoward about it. He cited legal precedence that allowed one person to be involved with different companies, even when they are involved in the same transaction. Minaki Lodge 2002 was created to operate the lodge, while Archer Group and Land Development are his real estate management companies. Celestine Mortgage is designed to raise investments to help finance his developments. Since Archer was the mind behind all four corporations, Johansen said there's no reason why Archer should have to document every step of every transaction. He knows all, Johansen said. You can't expect him to write memos to himself. You can't expect him to have conversations with himself. Johansen also picked the date of April 17, 2002 as critical to the case. He said at that time no contractor has stepped foot on the grounds of the lodge to conduct renovations. Since Celestine had already invested $2.6 million by that point, Johansen argues they should have priority on the first $2.2 million recovered from the sale of the lodge. Randy Seller, a lawyer for the plaintiff, said Celestine and Archer have only themselves to blame for the money lost because of the fire since neither party insisted it be insured. He was the author of his own misfortune, Seller said."

551595,Guest,2005-08-18 13:05:00,0,"I really don't have a response to the postings here other than I am amazed that everyone has an opinion based on a newspaper article. I wish everyone would educate themselves on these facts before they posted. I have decided that I will take the high road and not make any direct comments to any of these post - yes, even you, Trailerguy!! Now, I do agree with the postings that the property would/will struggle under the ownership of Mr. Archer in the future - there are people that will hold a grudge for many years. This is human nature and misery does love company. I feel it is best for Mr Archer to ""cut his losses"" and sell the property to the proper individual or group ASAP. If I had the money, I would buy it in a second. I really believe in Minaki as a whole and have met some wonderful people during my travels there. I will take a more positive stand here and say the area is ready for a new era and that it has never looked brighter. Cheers, Rod P.S. Robbie - you were suppose to call me last week after the court case - Talk to you soon."
