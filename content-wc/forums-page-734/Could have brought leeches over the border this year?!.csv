The rules were already printed but were not correct in that respect. I'm all for and do buy as much as we can in Canada. But, with us and others paying dearly for leeches and as some recent threads have suggested not being able to get leeches. Driving by cheap leeches in Duluth and other shops on the way up is frustrating. Does anyone else know of this? Or, is he full of ""malarky""? I'm not sure who to even ask. Pooch"

But, if you had brought leeches into Canada and you had told the border people you would be up there yet trying to get into Canada with them! No thanks, I like to drive right across and buy in Dryden."
551672,retire55,2005-08-22 09:43:00,1029,Pooch: It has been illegal for several years now for anyone (except someone holding an Ontario commercial baiting licence) to bring leeches from the US into Ontario. Ontario has pending legislation to even stop the importation of leeches by commercial baiters. This legislation was to be implemented 1 Jan 05 but has been delayed for some reason. I will attempt to get an update and post.
551688,retire55,2005-08-22 15:10:00,1029,An Ontario MNR representative telephoned this afternoon to say that the respective legislation (to prohibit importation of leeches into Ontario by holders of commercial baiters licences) is expected to be passed by mid to late Sep 05.

551704,DaveIN,2005-08-23 09:39:00,191,I called a bait shop in Nestor Falls yesterday and was told they do not have any leeches and can not get them. Guess I will use crawlers.
