551514,Lovetofish,2005-08-16 14:18:00,458,Looking for a recommendation for fishing line on a Abu Garcia 5600. I plan to use the reel for trolling raps and spoons with a M/H rod. My casting ability with it stinks. I put on fireline and had to cut it off from the backlash. I've been a spinning reel guy forever.
551535,walley250,2005-08-17 08:04:00,161,Did you put on mono backing first? I also had the same thing happen to me. Now I put on plenty of backing and it works great.
551536,Guest,2005-08-17 08:14:00,0,"I have use Fireline on my spinning reel for years and have loved it. Allow me to take serious your words about casting ability. How do you rate your casting skill regardless of which line type you use? If it is limited regarless of line type, Practice may be a helpful solution, if as you say your casting ability stinks."
551538,Lovetofish,2005-08-17 08:43:00,458,"I didn't put mono on first. I do that with all my spinning reels, but only to keep the line from spinning on the spool when it dries out. I was thinking maybe fireline has to small of diameter for the baitcaster reel."
551539,Lovetofish,2005-08-17 09:00:00,458,"My casting ability using the ""baitcaster"" stinks. Practice would help. I have used fireline on my spinning reels for a number of years, and I handle those reels just fine, no matter what line. Just bought the new baitcaster reel for mainly trolling and wondering if fireline was the right choice of line."

I have several reels and I have used many different types of line and unless you have the drag set right you will continue to have casting problems. When you have your lure tied on you will want to tighten the reel drag up until you have to shake the rod to get the lure to drop after you have pushed the release button. It should drop slowly but smoothly. Once you become comfortable with the reel you will want to work with the drag alittle to improve distance. You will also have to teach your thumb when to help slow down the spool. Its not as tough as it sounds, my wife has even mastered that reel and it only took a few minutes to catch on. Jeff"
551631,Lovetofish,2005-08-19 13:57:00,458,Thanks. I'll give it a try.

Unless it's rated for the weight of the lures you're throwing, the entire process will be off balance. In fact, it may be the most important component. Once all your tackle is in balance, casting is a breeze and with the reel you've selected, they'll be mistaking you for Kevin Van Dam in no time."
