551578,Jimbobwee,2005-08-18 09:11:00,9,Heading up to Lac Seul in a week or so and was wondering what the live bait of choice for some people is? This may be a dumb question but does it matter what live bait to use depending on the time of year? I haven't been up there this late before......... Thanks in advance.

Probably the most important thing to do to catch fish this time of year is to fish some deeper water 20' is the best place to start and work down from there. If you have a good depth finder look for those fish marks and fish slow.
