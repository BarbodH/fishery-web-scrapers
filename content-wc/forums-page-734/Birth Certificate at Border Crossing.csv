Returning back from Canada last year traveling with my Wife and two kids, The U.S. Customs asked for all of our Birth Certificates or a passport. If we had only our driver's license, my guess is there probably would not have been a problem for my wife and I. Not having birth certificates for the kids though probably would have been different."
