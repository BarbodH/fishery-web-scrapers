551399,Guest,2005-08-12 21:24:00,0,"Was at pinepoint about a month ago,no construction or border problems. They said the fishing has been good all year. Was ok when I was there, but the weather has a lot to do with the fishing. We trolled rattle traps and also did will with the deep wiggle worts. Most people jig or use spinners with live bait. Would like to here how you did when you get back. Have fun."
551401,Guest,2005-08-12 22:54:00,0,"hi, thanks for the info. will let you know how we did and how we did it."
551402,pfg1,2005-08-12 23:02:00,52,"I have fished LDML every mid-July since 2001. Our best luck for eyes has always been bouncing worm harnesses over holes and humps together with trolling rapalas, reef runners, etc. Hands down, the best bait for pike is the #5 Mepps Aglia with a Blue Blade and Blue Body. I order them off of the Mepps website. You still have time to get them by UPS. I fish the SW corner of LDML near around the Five Sisters Islands. We had our best year fishing last month and limited out by the 4th day of a six day trip so we spent time scouting new areas the last two days. We found eyes about anyplace where there was 12-20 feet of water. Watchout for table rocks! Ask the resort owner to markup a map for you showing the many rocks and reefs that will take off your lower unit. I know several rocks the size of a Buick that sit 12"" below the surface in 15-40 feet of water! I will watch for you report.....Tight lines, DAVID"

551435,Guest,2005-08-14 09:10:00,0,"david, do you troll the #5 mepps or cast them in the weeds? blue has been a good color for us too."
551438,Guest,2005-08-14 13:36:00,0,"The #5 Mepps is a great casting bait only. It creates nasty tangles in the line when trolled. One tip for walleye baits of every kind: I attach a 12-18 inch length of 15lb fluorocarbon to my line then attach the jig, spoon, rapala, worm harness, wolf river rig, etc. Doing so prevents bite-off by northern pike. I did not lose one walleye bait/rig last month due to bite-off. I recommend using a fly-fishing knot known as a surgeon's knot to join the mono and fluorcarbon line. The walleyes do not appear to be able to sense the fluorocarbon like they can sense a conventional pike leader. As far as trolling goes, in July I use the 10-inch and 7-inch Polish Pike and Polish Perch available at Gander Mountain or Fleet Farm. These baits are huge but deadly on pike in 12-35 feet of water. We caught our biggest pike on a 10-inch Polish Pike (yes, they are made in Poland!). The Polish Perch caught a few pike but nothing like the Polsih Pike baits. Watchout for the nasty treble hooks on these baits once the pike is in the net and in the boat. We use a Boga Grip and jaw spreader with all of our pike. Plus, the Boga has a built-in scale up to 30lbs. Very slick. I recommend keeping a heavy duty wire cutters on board if you use the big Polish Pike baits so you can snip hooks in an emergency. Good luck, DAVID"
551520,Guest,2005-08-16 18:27:00,0,"We got back from pine point on 8-14. The fish we caught were below 20'down to 30', most fish were 17""-21"" at this depth, only smaller ones shallower. Mainly we used white jigs(3/8) w/ red eyes and minnows, if you have deep diving raps give them a try on a good weather day. Talk to Steve or Gary at the dock, they can help with directions and water hazards. I've been going there for 25 yrs, it can be a great time on the water. Good luck and keep the lines tight."
551558,Guest,2005-08-17 15:38:00,0,thanks for the info. will be up there this saturday til the following....can't wait! do you cast or troll your cranks? did you try bouncing with crawler harnesses? we are gonna try a little bit of everything. we have had good luck straight across(opposite shore) from pine point. will check with those guys for conditions. thanks again and will post when we get back. did you buy beer at the resort? was wondering what a case(labatt crystal)goes for. doesn't really matter....just need cold beer to wash down the hot fish!! come on saturday!
551586,Guest,2005-08-18 11:16:00,0,"We troll the baits to get them deep(SR9 shad rap,silver or chrome colors work best). Didn't use any bouncers or worms, but they can work well. The south shore can be a very good spot. I don't know about the beer, as I don't drink it, but maybe it's cheaper at rydens duty free shop."
