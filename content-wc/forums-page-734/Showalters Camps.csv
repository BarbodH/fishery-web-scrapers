He said that he caught hundred + each day of walleyes, but mostly smaller at Action. He moved to Hammerhand where he caught larger walleyes but less. I forgot to write down the third lake's name, but he liked the other two the best. He says he stopped last year going to Showalters only because he does not want to be isolated because he has small kids at home."
