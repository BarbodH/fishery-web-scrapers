551564,Trailerguy,2005-08-17 16:43:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I have a cottage on Wabby,and know both resorts. Tall Pines is newer, and a little nicer, both have relitivly new owners. Last year they both changed hands I believe. I don't think either one would disapoint you or your wife. Just to stirr the pot you should take a look at www.sleepydogcabins.com it's a little smaller and more personal, Tommy also guides. Late June or early July can be a good time, depending on when ice out occurs. The first narrows is often a good spot at that time, or the fish may have moved into deeper water, depending on water temperatures. Whoever your host is they will know where to look for the fish. Good luck to you. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
