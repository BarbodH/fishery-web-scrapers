551602,Guest,2005-08-18 15:04:00,0,The deluxe boats at Evergreen are 18 ft they look bigger then my Pro-v 1800. Of course they are loaded down with all the junk I haul up there every year.
551603,Guest,2005-08-18 15:06:00,0,"That last post should read, ""they aren't loaded down..."""
551608,Hump,2005-08-18 16:36:00,578,"actually, I think they are 19'. AVS you are welcome to e-mail me for any questions. i was in the same ""boat"" last year."
551463,Guest,2005-08-15 13:29:00,0,I just booked a trip w/ Evergreen lodge and we will be making our 2006 trip week of June 10th. I think the sanctuary will not be open till the following week. I have fished the area in the past after the sanctuary has opened. The question I have is: What are some of the hot spots for early June?
551482,Guest,2005-08-15 17:32:00,0,We were at lac Seul This year June 11 -17. Fished 4 days on the lake from 11-14 and was only able to fish 2 days in the santuary. We caught more fish in 2 days in the santuary then we did in 4 days on the lake. We checked the 2006 calander before we left and found if we booked the same week we would only be able to fish the santuary 1 day next year so we booked 1 week later June 17-23. We will be able to fish the santuary the entire week.

551583,Guest,2005-08-18 09:57:00,0,Hi. sawmill bay and below the dam. does anyone ever fish below the dam? we always did and we would limit out in one day with no slot size!
551592,Guest,2005-08-18 12:11:00,0,"We have never fished below the dam and have talked about it. My question is this if you are staying at a camp on LacSuel and catch ""slot"" fish below that dam how do you keep them and prove they were taken out of the lake??"
551593,Guest,2005-08-18 12:41:00,0,"How far is Sawmill? We are staying at Evergreen using the ""upgrade"" camp boats. Im assuming they have at least 40 hp motors, but not exactly sure."
551594,Guest,2005-08-18 12:59:00,0,"Sawmill is maybe 1o to 15 minutes on ""good"" water on rough water could be longer. Thats to the mouth of Sawmill. Be ready for some crowds cause it's like the Mn. fishing opener with plenty of boats."
551596,Guest,2005-08-18 13:14:00,0,Mark were do you stay?
551597,Hump,2005-08-18 13:39:00,578,Evergreen has 50 horse electric start motors. Fantastic boats!
551598,Guest,2005-08-18 13:56:00,0,"Excuse me Mr. Hump? Do you know how long the boats are? I'd ask Pat, but I think I've called/E-mailed her 3-4 time already this week, and hate to wear out my welcome. I'm the type-a guy that wont be able to sleep till June 2006, and could dream up 100 diferent reasons to call/e-mail them. Any info you could give me would be just one less phone call Pat and Gary have to answer! Thank You Mr. Hump. PS I just ordered my map today (Lac Seul Northwest) - I'll start waiting by the mailbox tomorow! I used to drive my folks nuts around b-days and Christmas"
