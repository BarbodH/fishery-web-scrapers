Hopefully no one in the party has a drunk driving conviction. If so, you may be OK if it is old enough and is only once. This has been extensively discussed on this board, so you can do a search for more information. BTW, radar detectors are illegal in Ontario, so leave it at home. Nightcrawlers in worm bedding, no dirt. Do not bring in leaches from US and do not bring in bags of potatoes from US."

Declare it and go in and pay the duty, it only takes a few minutes or better yet buy your beer at the local LCBO. Rich J"
