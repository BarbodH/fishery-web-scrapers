I have stayed at and stopped by several other resorts just to look, and none compare. Evergreen has Misty River rental boats that are 18+ feet with fifties. Nicest rental boat I have ever fished out of. It has tons of storage for rain gear and tackle, and it has front and rear minnow tanks. They also put a wheeled cooler in the boat to use as the deadwell. The dock worker cleaned out the boats every morning and stocked you with minnows so you were ready to go. Blows away the Lund Outfitters I have used up there. Fishing was a little slow for Lac Seul. We fished hard three days, and my boat caught about 75 - 80 fish those days. Two other days we stayed close to the cabin because of wind and still caught about 45 to 50 fish. The biggest was only 25 and we had lots of 20 to 22. It had been high 80's the week before, but it got cold right when we were getting there. We never got over 72 degrees. We bounced 1/2 ounce lead weights and a spinner with minnow starting at 11 feet and went down to about 22 feet. Not many bites deeper than that. I tried crawlers and caught some as well. Tried to buy leaches, but Four Seasons were out for the season. No one had pounds of em. In the past, I have done all of my shopping at home and brought up far more than I thought we would need because the grocery stores in Ear Falls look so small. We ran out of Bloody Mary supplies, and I went in the grocery store right next to Trillium on the main highway. They are affliated with Safeway, and had a good selection, good prices, and a nice little bakery. No more overstocking the car for me."

Gary and Patty are great hosts, Patty is down at the dock every morning making sure people are taken care of and Lori did a great job of making sure all boats had ice, minnows and gas. We did catch some jigging at 24' off a couple of islands SE of Goose and a mid lake hump down by Cox. Most of what we caught was at 17' or less with 13 or 14 ' being the most productive. I was there 3 weeks ago and the same pattern was working then. It seemed that in July and last week most people were anchoring and jigging rather than trolling spinners because of the windy conditions. Rich J"

551653,Hump,2005-08-21 08:33:00,578,We were there in June and had Danny and Trudy at the dock. Are they gone? Danny had quite a personality and great humor.
551659,Guest,2005-08-21 16:45:00,0,Our first day there was the last day for a kid I think was named Ryan. I think he was asked to leave. There was a new woman at the dock who was great and worked hard.
