551683,hoowaa,2005-08-22 13:35:00,6,May or may not be a dumb question.... Looking to go fishing Sept Long Weekend. Perhaps somewhere in Nopiming or Winnipeg River system. Will be my last trip of the year and perhaps for awhile as I have a new baby due and moving into a new home..... I am looking for a recommendation as to a spot for the weekend for some Camping and Walleye fishing. I have a boat/trailer that needs a ramp. I like camping and would sleep on an island if available.. If you were me....where would you go Sept Long ?
