551588,IaDave,2005-08-18 11:24:00,476,I have always used my credit card but I see this year they started charging a small fee to convert to US $.
551591,Guest,2005-08-18 12:08:00,0,The answer is yes unless things have changed since the 1st week in July. I ask before I give them the yankee $$$ but they said no problem.
551600,Guest,2005-08-18 14:28:00,0,Convert your cash to Canadian on the way up and back to US coming home. When you buy with US in Canada most places hedge on the exchange rate and you get the short end. It will save you a few bucks and when you convert to CAN you will feel like you are loaded.
551610,jeffster,2005-08-18 18:04:00,163,They will take your U.S. dollar and most of the time give you change in Canadian money. Get Canadian money as soon as you get over the border and use that for your spending money. Then you don't have to worry about all that math when you get your change back from what ever you bought.

Still not sure how it happened, they must have seen me coming."
