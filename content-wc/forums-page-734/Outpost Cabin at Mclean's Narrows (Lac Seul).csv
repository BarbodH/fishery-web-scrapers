551707,Guest,2005-08-23 12:47:00,0,Does anyone know who runs the outpost camp at McLean's Narrows? We drove past it a couple of weeks ago and it looks like a nice place that I might want to check out. Thanks.

551712,Guest,2005-08-23 14:04:00,0,"I am told by my father-in-law who has fished that area for a number of years. that the cabin is private and that a old logger left it to one of his faithfull logging workers and he is now getting old. He might rent it out or let family adn friends use it but I am fairly sure that it is not an outpost and it is not Anderson's. The weather really affected the bite last week when we were up in that area. Couldn't find any decent sized fish. My graph showed alot of stuff suspended up about 5-8 ft off bottom, don't know if this where they were or what?"
