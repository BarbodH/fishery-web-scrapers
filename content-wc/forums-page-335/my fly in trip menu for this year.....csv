2693898,forgop,2014-04-18 08:58:00,880,No bacon?
2694458,camp chef,2014-04-18 11:33:00,915,"We like to start with fresh chicken cooked slowly on the gill and basted with a homemade Bourbon barrel stout and brown sugar BBQ sauce. We apply sauce a minimum of 8 different times. This chicken is so delicious, moist and finger licking good.All our evening meals are slow preparations. Seems in Canada we are just not in a hurry."
2694930,bullhockey,2014-04-18 14:00:00,41,I cant see taking all that food in. You are catching the best food there is in the lake your on !!!! we eat eyes for every supper. quick sandwiches for lunch. breakfast is eggs and bacon or sausage. some days we have eyes for lunch too. sure saves weight. I guess to each his own. my sons are the best cooks in the world so don't need a chef !!!!! every body have a ball this year.
2694986,Aaron-IN,2014-04-18 14:20:00,500,"I hear ya, I eat like that at home. In Canada it's fish and beer."
2699138,SinOrSwim,2014-04-19 18:00:00,1528,"We have fish at every meal as well but also don't eat ""just"" fish. We do both. Try to do battered fish along with whatever meal we have. But, food is a big portion of our trip. Walleye chimis, cajun seafood/walleye pasta etc. Plus, fried fish with every dinner and shore lunch at least a couple days"

2690410,SinOrSwim,2014-04-17 13:11:00,1528,Was just busting the OP's chops. No harm meant.
2690810,Hawkfan,2014-04-17 14:17:00,237,"No more yankey his fishing line, the Donger need food!"
2691154,Blades-n-Beads,2014-04-17 15:36:00,484,"Chadder123, Sounds like a great shopping list for home but your on a fishing trip! Don't anyone enjoy fish for supper , lunch and breakfast? 200 dif ways to prepair it. Fish tacos, deep fried, baked. Try this one. Baked walleye fillets, warm up some lefsa, put a slab of boneless baked fillet on it and roll it up. Top off with melted butter and salt and pepper! Quick easy and awesome tasting."
2691354,michigan walleye guy,2014-04-17 16:33:00,95,"I find that using the propane grill makes cooking very fast and easy, even after dark. I always plan two meals of steak (ribeye and T-bone), boneless chicken breasts, chops, pasties (baked in oven), and leftovers for the last night.One guy will fix a salad, and we always have a hunk of French or Italian bread with butter, and that's really all you need. Sometimes we fix corn, beans, or a wild rice dish if somebody is ambitious.I do have to admit that we rarely have breakfast, except for maybe once a trip. And we always save that day for when there if foul weather, and nobody is in a hurry to get out there.We always have shore lunch at noon--that's non-negotiable. But we use the camp propane cooker to expedite things. Filleting the walleyes the night before and then putting them in ziplocks until the next day makes the job quicker. At least once on the trip we try to do the old-school shore lunch on an island somewhere, and that takes an hour or two, but time well spent.As Gordon McQuarrie once said, ""I go to the bush to smooth it, not to rough it."""
2691442,SinOrSwim,2014-04-17 16:55:00,1528,"I'm with you. The food is one of the highlights of our trip. But, we eat fish with every dinner. Lunch is eitehr shore lunch or sandwiches. We still pull over and all eat and hang out but no matter what we are eating for dinner, we have fried fish with every meal. I have tried and just can't recreate the food like it is up there. The fish is never that fresh. So, whether we are having walleye chimis, steaks, pasta, whatever there is always some fried fish to wash it down with."
2691474,packpro,2014-04-17 16:58:00,695,Just a suggestion for Chicken night. We buy 2-3 Costco or Sams rotisserie cooked chickens. We cut them into pieces and vacuum seal and freeze. Put them into an aluminum pan with a little broth and heat to serve. We used the gas grill. Total cost for the chickens $15.00. Heat up really easy and saves time cooking and clean up.
2691602,jmsteele,2014-04-17 17:31:00,19,"Eggs and bacon or sausage every morning. Sometimes Ill catch a few walleye for breakfast. Lunch is a summer sausage samich with cheese and a slice of raw onion and a candy bar. Dinner is ALWAYS walleye, fried potatoes, coleslaw, and wash it all down with a few Labatt Blues. Then a few hands of euchre and a cocktail. Nothing better!!!"
2691906,btyreprich,2014-04-17 19:18:00,1067,I am the cook for our group which means I also in charge of buying the groceries / watching the budget. A popular item with our group in pork tenderloin. Freezes well and can often be found on sale for like $2.99 a pound. We prefer the tenderloin all natural - just season with Montreal Steak Seasoning . This will travel well on a fly in an fishing easy to cook.
2692306,forgop,2014-04-17 20:30:00,880,"The best tenderloin is pounded out, breaded, and deep fried. Unless you live in Iowa or Indiana, you won't find many like it. Here's a pic of my favorite tenderloin from a pub 3 miles from my househttps://www.facebook.com/photo.php?f...5973462&type=3"

2689546,Pikeslayer8,2014-04-17 10:35:00,1460,Chicken thighs and corn on the cob are a couple other things you might want to adjust for a fly-in menu as well. Why lug up thigh bones and corn cobs unless you got somethun else in mind.
2689570,SinOrSwim,2014-04-17 10:44:00,1528,Here is a Canada dinner. Walleye Chimi with spanish rice. Not a great picture mind you.http://i193.photobucket.com/albums/z...3/DSCN0197.jpg

2689642,oldfart,2014-04-17 11:14:00,21,"We try to make it simple-instant oatmeal, etc for breakfast(don't want to spend all morning cooking), sandwiches & chips(Pringles) for lunch, fish and a side or two for supper. We take 2 extra meals-one for the last night & one as a backup(usually steaks on the grill) and eggs and bacon for a breakfast or two in case of rain or bad weather in the AM."
2689842,Mike Kansas,2014-04-17 11:50:00,1463,"123chadder I think the boys are just jerking your chain. It all looks good to me. I plan and cook for two trips a year and the rule is...IF YOU DON""T LIKE THE FOOD YOU DO IT NEXT YEAR No complaints yet. I would be remis if I didn't add the fact that our grocery bill per man for 6 days is around $100 a man...not counting booze. Mike Kansas"
2690050,The Donger,2014-04-17 12:21:00,48,"For us it is the fishing, the friendships and most certainly the food. Eating well may take a bit more prep time and cost a bit more but this trip is a big deal and so are our meals. Always a huge breakfast - eggs, sausage, ham or bacon, fried potatoes and onions, toast and a couple mornings with pancakes and real ample syrup. Pack a sandwich, grab a drink and some beef jerky and spend all day on the water. Back to the cabin for cocktails and then 3 or 4 nights we have fish, steak one night, then ham, then grilled chicken. Rotate that with camp potatoes, baked beans, rice, salads, homemade french fries and onion rings. Always have smoked oysters, cheese and crackers, venison sausage, sardines etc. at cocktail hour. Oreos for desert. Lots and lots of Oreos. All of it washed down with refreshing adult beverages. We stay fat and happy and the outhouse gets a workout."
