2713329,bergsh,2014-04-23 08:52:00,183,Just wondering if anyone has any luck with underwater cameras in the stained waters in north west Ontario? I have a 10 year old Aqua Vu that is absolutely useless in those waters. I would be luck to see a foot with the system. Wondering if the new technology is any better in these waters? What do you use and what are your thoughts?

Watched a school of walleye eat our jigs one day till they disappeared. Found out why minutes later when my brother in law watched a big Muskie swim by the camera. After that never really used it as it seemed to be in the way and cumbersome to set up and just took away from the experience. If you know someone that has one borrow it for a trip and see if you like it. I will say u needed to burry your face in the screen to see anything on a sunny day though.

2716761,phishfearme,2014-04-24 04:18:00,1242,the stained water typical of the lakes of the north just wipes out the photo - but on top-end lake trout lakes with gin clear water they work much better. I just don't like to fish these infertile lakes. kinda surprised that someone hasn't offered side scan sonar model of fish finder. there was a 3-D one offered years ago which was not side scan.
