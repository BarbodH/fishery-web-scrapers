2712314,Huskerpike,2014-04-22 22:15:00,4,"Thanks, if you hear who bought it could you share that info with me? Did Clint get out of the industry?"
2714265,Duflebag,2014-04-23 12:48:00,218,"Clint did get out of the industry. He worked the rigs a little last winter then got a regular job. He seems to be very happy with less stress for now. I think it won't be long before he gets bored again. Clint will be stopping by my house in a couple of weeks, I'll see if he has contact information for the new owners."
