2432122,Pikeslayer8,2014-02-08 18:34:00,1460,Excellent recommendation coming from you! There aren't any smallies in Wabakimi. Another one for the bucket list.
2436938,dkrusin,2014-02-10 10:40:00,97,Thanks Ted and the rest...its on the bucket list.
2709874,SinOrSwim,2014-04-22 11:54:00,1528,"Will be spending a few days at HLL in early August with my 9 year old. I can't wait. The largest walleye I have caught was right at 30"" or just a little under Would be awesome if we can both top that!!!! Also, the booking process as I went back and forth on dates etc could NOT have been easier with Ted. To be honest, I was amazed at how quickly all my e-mails were returned etc. and how accommodating he was. He gave me dates open but also dates open when other kids my sons age will be in camp."
2428378,dkrusin,2014-02-07 10:21:00,97,"Have been thinking about trying Hawk Lake Lodge between Kenora and V Bay. Years ago fished Dogtooth Lake in that general area..Big Walleyes. Anyway I google earth the lake and one concern I have is that a little over a 1/2 mile to the north of the lodge appears to be a couple dozen lake homes. The website says NO PUBLIC ACCESS. Anyway, if anyone has been there please enlighten me. It looks like a great place, but that many homes has me concerned. Its not that big of water. Thanks!"
2428650,Fisherman Ted,2014-02-07 11:30:00,461,"Hawk Lake has a few local cottagers on the North End of the lake. They are all weekenders and as such each weekend we see a few boats on the main lake, few fishermen though. During the week as well as May and September we essentially have the whole place to ourselves. There is indeed no public access to Hawk or any other of the 19 portage lakes they have private boat access to. There are no boat launches, no roads, etc. No way for someone to drive in with a boat. The main lake (Hawk Lake) is very good size as are the out-lakes. On the out-lakes we never see anyone on the lakes as there is no way to get to them."
2429530,bassnblast,2014-02-07 16:03:00,56,My brother and I spent four days fishing at Hawk Lake Lodge and didn't see another boat (besides HLL boats)... Go -- you won't regret it (especially if you like smallmouth bass)!
2431122,stillangling,2014-02-08 10:47:00,149,Strange because I just spoke to a guy who ice fished one of them. We are talking about Crown Land here folks. Nothing stopping me from going there today. If you want to whip the locals up tell them they can't go somewhere.
2431594,Fisherman Ted,2014-02-08 14:48:00,461,In the winter you can get on the lake. In the summer you cannot (unless you are portaging through from quite a distance with a canoe).
2431610,tackleman,2014-02-08 14:53:00,444,"i was looking for rates on the web site but couldn't find any, anybody have an idea on the cost of going there?"
2431650,Fisherman Ted,2014-02-08 15:02:00,461,Rates can be found here: http://www.hawk-lake.com/contact.htm -FT
2431674,prov1800,2014-02-08 15:14:00,5010,Very expensive.its a 5 star place.
2431914,MidWestFishman,2014-02-08 17:05:00,44,"I have fished at Hawk Lake twice- spending a week each time at the lodge. The fishing is superb with trophy smallmouth caught daily by almost every group that goes. There are some huge walleye in the waters and they just had Al Lindner there in 2013 and he caught some 30 inch plus walleye. I have seen some huge walleye caught there during the 2 trips that I went. The accommodations are great, the food excellent and the lodge has really nice boats. I can't say enough about the owner Ted Putman- he treats everyone like family. Yes it is expensive but as earlier stated it is 5 star. For the trip of a lifetime, it should be considered as a lodge to go to if you enjoy smallmouth and walleye fishing. There are pike also."
2432082,NWwalleye,2014-02-08 18:03:00,223,"I guided at HLL a few years ago for the previous owner ( Frank )...Hawk lake has a good population of Small Mouth Bass, Pike, Lake trout and Walleyes with most being very large..Outstanding bass fishing on all the portage lakes and several lake have large pike..One certain portage lake ( Mud Lk) has outstanding walleye fishing in it as well as the excellent bass fishing ..I agree everything about Hawk Lake Lodge says 5 star !!!!Haven't had the privilege to guide for Ted, but I did go fishing with him the first year he purchased the Lodge ..Give it a try, I guarantee you will not be disappointed .."
