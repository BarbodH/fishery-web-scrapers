2679153,Golden Eagle,2014-04-14 20:10:00,2642,"Mike, I want to, but I'm no longer into the same kind of trip. I was younger back in 1962. Much younger. I have two trips planned for 2014, if I can hold off on having a second knee replacement. It's going to be close. Should have done it 3 months ago, but wanted time to build up my heart and lungs before surgery. A weak patient doesn't recover quickly. I appreciate the offer."
2679441,Mike Borger,2014-04-14 20:53:00,1554,"No bushwhacking, just flying into a very nice outpost camp within the Chapleau Game Preserve.Standing offer, anytime."
2679481,Golden Eagle,2014-04-14 21:01:00,2642,We'll keep it in mind. For sure we'll catch fish and see a lot of wild life.
2686737,HTHM,2014-04-16 18:07:00,41,"DO clip and paste from the place you have that stored, it is well worth the re-telling!"
2686977,Mike Borger,2014-04-16 18:58:00,1554,"Here you go. Several years back while soloing in Quetico I approached a perfect island campsite on Kawnipi Lake and decided to pull in and set up camp as it was getting late.While unloading my gear an angry little psycho red squirrel with a black slash on his forehead raced around me excitedly, chattering and shrieking like he was rabid (obviously I was on his turf!).Anyhow, after awhile he left and I went about my business. A little while later I had a fire going and was about to start eating a potful of rice when out of the corner of my eye I spotted the little demon seed sitting on the log next to me mesmerized by my rice.Very, very slowly I grabbed the pot lid in my right hand and held it poised above the pot which was resting on my knees. It took a looong time, probably 15mins of sitting motionless like that, but finally the little bugger hopped into my pot and started gobbling up my dinner.I quickly slammed the lid down to capture the demon and all he ll broke loose!He was scrabbling at the pot trying to get out all the while making these weird gurgling noises.Well, as much as he was bugging me I didn't want to kill the little guy, I just wanted him to get lost. I looked around and noticed a tiny rock pile in the lake about 400yds from the island.Aha! I thought, Alcatraz it is for the little beggar!I put the still shrieking squirrel into my canoe and pushed off for the rock pile. Upon arriving, I VERY carefully placed the pot on the rocks, then leaned way over with the paddle, completely unbalanced, and flipped the pot lid off with the tip of the paddle.What happened next is kind of a blur it happened so fast. In my minds eye I see the squirrel shoot straight up in the air about 3 feet, do a 360 to see where he is, then shrieking, he launched himself horizontally right at my face. He was like the Chuck Norris of squirrels.All 4 of the demons little claws sank into my face drawing blood . I freaked and capsized my canoe into the lake. The demon spring boarded off my face and hit the water like he had an outboard in his butt making a beeline back to his island.Squirrels are REALLY good swimmers, who knew?All I could do was laugh. I gathered my wits (and canoe) and made my way back to the island. Thankfully the demon squirrel seemed to be in hiding and the ordeal was over. (or so I thought!)The next morning I packed up early as I wanted to get going. The canoe was loaded and I was just finishing my morning oatmeal when, you guessed it, I spied the demon 2 feet to my right staring intently at my pot of oatmeal. I knew it was the same beast 'cause of the distinctive black slash on his forehead (sign of the beast?)This time it took at least 1/2 an hour...my arm was getting REALLY tired holding the pot lid in the air motionless.Finally, his hunger overcame his fear and he tentatively hopped in. I slammed the lid down on him with a vengeance!. The bizarre, otherworldly noises that came from that pot sent chills down my spine. Without really thinking, just reacting, I grabbed the pot and started to shake it as hard as I could (sorry squirrel lovers, don't condemn me 'till you've walked a mile in my shoes).I shook that pot 'till my arms were sore then threw it down on the ground.Amazingly the demon landed on his feet, standing upright. His eyes were closed though, and he was wobbling around like a drunk.I grabbed my pot, thinking, huh, that'll teach ya!. I was still watching the beast as I turned to my canoe, when suddenly the wobbling stopped, his beady eyes snapped open clear and bright and full of hate! He let out a blood curdling shriek and launched himself at my leg!If any of you remember the killer bunny rabbit from Monty Python and The Holy Grail, well this was pretty similar.Frantically I tried to get to my canoe and safety as the creature attacked. He latched himself onto the cuff of my pants as I ran to my boat. Realizing he was attached to me I kicked my leg out and he flew off (I could have split the uprights at 60yds with that shot).I made it to my boat and pushed off, finally escaping the beasts wrath.By far my most memorable wildlife encounter!"
2687153,HTHM,2014-04-16 19:43:00,41,"Thank you, BTW I still have your book. Been meaning to return it."
2687186,codyhcahoon,2014-04-16 19:51:00,112,That is an awesome story mike
2687378,Knoxabilly,2014-04-16 20:23:00,225,Haha WOW!
2687786,1jigfish2,2014-04-16 21:56:00,110,Thanks for the laugh.
2650777,Golden Eagle,2014-04-07 19:34:00,2642,"Hey guys, Mike has fished a lot of limited access water in Northern Ontario. Mike, have you run into dead lakes or rivers? I'm thinking not too many, if any and you were probably able to move a short distance (but still probably a chore) and find good fishing. I'm talking only of out of the way lakes, without camps."
2651105,Mike Borger,2014-04-07 20:53:00,1554,"Interesting question Connie. Back in my paddling days I explored countless small lakes in NW Ontario. These lakes were not part of any established canoe route and too small to land a plane in, so about as untouched as it's possible to be.You'd be surprised how many of them were fishless! Or if not fishless only held tiny stunted pike. There were lots of lakes like that. Invariably though these were shallow tannin stained muck bottomed lakes that in all likelihood freeze solid in the winter.On the other side of the coin were the small lakes teeming with fish. I remember one in particular adjacent to the Albany river. I was paddling down the river and decided on a whim to bushwhack my way up a tiny rivulet that ended about 1km upstream at the most beautiful turquoise green spring fed lake I've ever seen. I camped on that lake for 3 nights and caught walleye like never before or since. I'll swear on the life of my kids these fish were an honest 4lb average with lots of 6-8lbers. Never cracked 10 but I'll bet I would've.Still dream about that lake."
2651817,Aaron-IN,2014-04-08 07:07:00,500,"I love stories like this, brings back good times for me. I made a similar journey years ago and came upon a smaller lake teaming with 15-20 lb Northern Pike, it was unreal!"
2655249,forgop,2014-04-08 20:33:00,880,Sounds like a great candidate for a fly-in camping trip if an outfitter will get me there...if you can remember how to guide me there. Guess I better start hitting the weights now to even consider a paddling trip in 2015.
2675433,LoDo,2014-04-13 21:45:00,721,"My party fishes Donald Lake in the Woodland Caribou National Park area annually. A few of us were able to get two boats in an area I highly doubt many others have been. An unnamed lake thats probably 10-15' deep at most. We landed several northerns, but nothing in the 40"" range. 30"" were all day. Very few 'eyes."
2675969,UKBDM,2014-04-14 06:57:00,178,"Went into Quetico in late May back in 1999 or 2000. Outfitter put us on a couple unnamed lakes that were unbelievable. We might have been the first people on them that year. The portages had never been maintained (that we could tell) and if water levels had been low I don't know if we would have made it. First lake was a push, pull, drag up a little flowage for 1/2 mile and then a faint path for 100 yards. We caught 2-4lb smallmouth all morning. I had a groove wore in both thumbs. No kidding. Second lake was just 50 yards up a hill from the first lake but it seemed straight up. 3-5lb walleye all afternoon with just a jig and grub. We were not good walleye fisherman back then (or now ) but four of us must have put 40-50 in the canoe in two hours. My back, feet, and ankles have pretty much ended my Quetico trips. I still dream about those two lakes though."
2676338,Mike Borger,2014-04-14 08:45:00,1554,"Cool story! Quetico is one of my favorite places and over the years I've done a number of lengthy solo trips anywhere from one to two months long.I have lots of stories. Plenty of big fish, the time I cut my thumb right down to the bone with a swede saw (packed it in polysporin and bandaged it up LOL!). Then there was a group of girls that decided to pick blueberries on my tiny island campsite on Agnes lake (that's a story that I can't tell publicly ). One of my favorite stories is my encounter with an aggressive red squirrel on an island on Kawnipi lake. That's a beauty. Speaking of lakes off the beaten trail one in particular caught my eye. It wasn't part of any route and had no trails leading to it. Having nothing but time I decided to check it out. I waded up a small mucky creek for a couple of km's upstream pulling and dragging my loaded canoe along with me. It was July and it was hot sweaty work. Finally arriving at the lake I was plastered in thick stinky black muck.First order of business was to clean up so I waded into the lake and couldn't understand why a lot of the muck wasn't washing off.To my horror I realized that the entire lower half of my body was covered with hundreds of big black leeches LOL!There were too many to deal with in a normal way so I grabbed my knife and filleted them off my skin filling one of my pots with the squirming terrors.Setting up camp I thought it was only fitting that the leeches pay for their mistake so I proceeded to tip my jig with them and caught crazy numbers of walleyes. Nothing gigantic, but literally every time I dropped I had a fish on.One of my favorite memories."
2677777,Fisherman Ted,2014-04-14 14:29:00,461,"30 years ago I did a 2 month canoe trip north of Temagami up to the Arctic circle. 1,400 miles of paddling and portaging to lakes no one had ever seen. No campsites, lodges, cabins etc. We didn't see ANYONE for 8 weeks. Surreal. Fishing was incredible of course. I mean, who in their right mind would portage a canoe 200 miles into the bush. Anyway, one lake we did come to was completely dead. Not just stunted fish, but no fish, no frogs, bugs, birds, nothing. We would paddle through the lake and you could hear a pin drop it was so quiet. Very unnerving to say the least. We were told that it was the classic acid rain lake. Very sad considering we were as remote as you could be."
2678489,Golden Eagle,2014-04-14 17:35:00,2642,"Early June 1962 four of us (2 vehicles) camped East of Chapleau on Hwy 101 before the new road officially opened. Fishing was pretty decent, plus we got to try a number of lakes with no name, but road workers and locals beat us to the best fishing. They didn't leave as many as we would have liked. Pike fishing was pretty good. Lakes didn't hold many walleyes. Perch were all over and we found brook trout in just about every stretch of moving water. We carried motors and dragged boats every day. Sold my SW for $20 after we made it back home to Oxford, Ohio. Junk dealer offered $30 on the phone, but dropped the offer after seeing the car."
2678537,phishfearme,2014-04-14 17:47:00,1242,"sounds like the crew on this thread would enjoy reading ""canoeing with the cree"" by eric sevaried - yes by the new announcer. he did an incredible (and kinda stupid) trip north with a fellow teenage buddy in 1930! makes for quite a story. our outfitter on our first 2 week canoe trip down the Albany (from osnaburg lake to miminiska lake (before the lodge got back into business) told us to read it and it totally made us respectful of what they did - although like I said, I still think it was quite dumb - but in a different era. (although if you really want to read about a totally stupid wilderness adventure, read ""into the wild"" by jon krakauer. phish"
