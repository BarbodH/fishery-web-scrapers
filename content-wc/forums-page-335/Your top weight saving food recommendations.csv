I wonder what will they come up with for cost of tax/duty on this one. Great idea for fly in trips or whatever the trip! Powdered bloody Mary's just add ice! Now that's a great idea."

2700130,forgop,2014-04-19 22:22:00,880,"If I drink a 12 pack/day in Canada, over the course of a week is probably what I go through over the course of 6 months back home. Same with the cigars-I bet I smoked 30-35 cigars (good size cigars, not the little ones) in 7 days last year. It would probably take me almost 4 months to do that at home. There's no wife around to nag me about it, so why not take advantage of it? At least Hard Tea (and whatever guest usernames he's picked in the past to flame with) can wear his panties in Canada just like he does back home."
2700242,jaximus,2014-04-20 00:54:00,117,"im surprised that noone has brought up MIO liquid drops for space/weight saving beverages. my group does a week long canoe trip where we have to portage equipment. over the course of a week one or two(for variety) little mio bottles flavors all the water you can drink. if you have a group that doesnt mind sharing you can each bring a different flavor and have variety that way. we do baked lemon pepper fish or a fish fry for 2 meals a day. for sides we bring a couple packs of spaghetti, and the just add water biscuits (cornbread, lemon poppyseed, 3 cheese, and garlic cheddar are flavors i recall bringing in the past) 2 packs used to make one big loaf cooked in a breadpan over the campfire is enough to feed 4 full grown men as a side for a baked lemon pepper lake trout. breakfast is oatmeal most days."
2700906,octanehi5,2014-04-20 07:46:00,1104,"After 25+yrs of doing flyins, We have learned the hard way.Most people who take these trips ,it is there major vacation. They plan and anticipate for a yr. Myself Being 100% Italian,Like to eat top quality foods, Eating fish every day is just not going to happen. All of the guys on the trip come up with the menu,After all you are all paying to take the flyin, Breakfast,Eggs ,bacon, sausage, pancakes, french toast,oatmeal,homefries,toast, coffee, Lunch .Shore lunch, Burgers, Hot dogs, Red hots, Dinner, always a big meal, Home made sauce with Italian sausage & pasta,Rib eye steaks for two meals,Potatoes,rice ,beans, veggies.Poutin, 3 evening fishfries,Burgers and hot dogs on the grill, Not to forget the beers of your choice, Red wine,Italian of coarce, Good cigars. Now you have to convince me and the guys,which one of these things you want to dehydrate.Or not.Yes we do make weight. I have an opening for two guys for this yrs trip 6/20 -6/29. Dried foods just do not make it. My 6 guys last yr only caught 2250 walleyes"
2697210,Mike Borger,2014-04-19 04:52:00,1554,A couple of guys have mentioned Tang. If you're trying to save on weight sugar based drink crystals are heavy.An aspartame based drink mix like Crystal Light is a fraction of the weight and tastes great imo.
2697530,Jack77,2014-04-19 07:42:00,168,"I was going to suggest all of these things, if I didn't know better I would say this guy went with us. I would also suggest powered gatorade, lemonade, or the lightest of them all crystal light. I don't know if this is an option for you but having your outfitter fly in you beer or pop prior to your arrivial is the biggest weight saver of all."
2697570,Jack77,2014-04-19 07:47:00,168,I see some guys here talking about their menus and I have realized that we eat a lot more fish than most crews. We eat fish everday and twice on most days. Shore lunch everyday and we make fish different ways for dinner every other night.

2699034,forgop,2014-04-19 17:39:00,880,"Based on your previous posts, I see you still have no sack. Congrats"
2699226,Jack77,2014-04-19 18:19:00,168,My thoughts exactly. Bad enough this guy feels the over whelming need to troll you but he can't even do it under his own name.
2699290,forgop,2014-04-19 18:32:00,880,He wouldn't want the rest of the board to know how big his mangina really is.
2699458,SinOrSwim,2014-04-19 19:11:00,1528,"I bet we have more fun on our trips than someone like that does? We're the same as you forgop. People roll their eyes at our beer quantities too. But, I can't drink all day long at home. My wife won't let me. But, I CAN do it in Canada............so, I do."
2699570,Clayton69,2014-04-19 19:28:00,80,"I take about a dozen people from the HQ to Temagami Lake every year for a week. We take in freeze dried food from Mountain Equipment Coop/BassPro/SAIL etc. There's a huge selection of meals to accommodate for everyone's taste. They're extremely light weight and each package is meant to feed two people...or one hungry one. They run about $7-9 (Cdn) each, which is very reasonable to feed two people. They're really quite good...just don't read the sodium content. Another plus is the lack of garbage to have to dispose of. They're also very easy to prepare...just add boiling water and wait 15mins. And of course no meal plan would be complete without a selection of fish batter...http://www.mec.ca/shop/camping-entrees/50130+50394/?h=10+50025+50130 For drinks any powdered drink mix seems to work. Although in recent years the single serving Crystal Light packets seem to be gaining in popularity. 500ml of water, tear the packet, dump and go. No measuring required. They also require less powder so there is some weight savings. For fresh water we use a Katadyn drip filter and carry a pump version for backup. Both work extremely well...no worries about 'beaver fever'! http://www.mec.ca/product/1699-438/k...10+50130+50467http://www.mec.ca/product/4013-733/k...10+50130+50467"
2692674,forgop,2014-04-17 22:49:00,880,"Curious what all options you use on fly-ins since weight comes at a premium. I know I took far too much food in last year and looking for other options that go in dry and can be prepared with water from camp. As was the case last year, we'll plan on pancakes for most breakfasts. Shore Lunch makes some pretty good dry soup mixes that I may use for a couple of meals this year. If I do the chili, I will supplement with hamburger and some elbow macaroni. Was also told by a member recently about dried hash browns that you can get at Costco (also found them on Amazon). Saw the mention of the hamburger helper in another thread, but other than those, any other dried foods you always go with that minimize time from a preparation standpoint and are good to eat?"
2692738,roscoe33,2014-04-17 23:59:00,653,"While I enjoy instant mashed potatoes, the dehydrated hash browns or cubed variety doesn't fast good. Take instant mashed, add powdered milk, salt, and butter. Spaghetti works as a side dish, with butter, garlic powder, cheese, or pasta sauce. And while not a dry type food, eggs are a must have. 1 dozen per person, cracked and frozen in zip locks of appropriate size."
2692818,kzoofisher,2014-04-18 04:03:00,5144,"speaking of saving weight, anybody try a gravity water filter and do they work?http://www.cascadedesigns.com/platyp...filter/product"
2692890,green&orange,2014-04-18 05:36:00,28,"I have one made by MSR and it works great. You do need to backwash it from time to time as the flow slows down, but it is WAY better than pumping. Worth the $ IMO."

2696450,packpro,2014-04-18 20:18:00,695,"Breakfast- Everyone on their own. Pop tarts, pastries, bagels, cereal, etc, Lunch- Sammies, chips, energy bars. We take a few spiral sliced hams (doubles for the breakfast carnivores) Salami- lots of added flavor in a little slice.Dinner, Your catching dinner every day. Traditional fish fry, fish tacos, baked lemon pepper. Sides of your choosing. Rice is a good light weight filler."

Granola/energy bars and a sandwich bag of trail mix takes care of everything from breakfast until the daily fish dinner at sunset. P.S. Take a dozen or so chicken bouillon cubes along. When you cook rice crush two or three and toss them into the water you're using to cook the rice. Changes the whole experience.
2696794,adempsey,2014-04-18 21:48:00,963,I put together this article on packing for my website last year. A lot of the ideas in it came from the members of Walleye Central.
