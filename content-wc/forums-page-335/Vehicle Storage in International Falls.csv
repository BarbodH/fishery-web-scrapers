2710194,Simple Man,2014-04-22 13:37:00,92,Our group may be meeting in International Falls and consolidating to one vehicle. Has anyone ever looked into temporary parking in International Falls while on your trip across the border? We will be in Camp 10 days so we would need to be able to find temporary parking for one vehicle in Ifalls for those days. Thanks!

2710378,Simple Man,2014-04-22 14:10:00,92,3.5 hrs north of the border. We can do that but we are only meeting one guy from our group in Ifalls and he is renting a boat when we get to camp so there really isnt any need for the extra vehicle and we have plenty of room. May end up doing what you suggest anyway but just thought I would see if anyone else has ever left a vehicle in Ifalls and crossed the border with another part of their group. Thanks for the reply.
2710626,dutchboy,2014-04-22 15:12:00,5717,It's hard to believe but I have never had any problems with vandalism up there. I know many people leave their vehicles at the VNP visitors center for a week or two at a time while canoeing and camping at the park. A quick call to city hall will answer your question of where you can park. Have fun.
2710850,worthsr,2014-04-22 15:48:00,52,I'd be willing to bet one of the motels close to the border would let you park a car there for a week if you gave them $25. I'd also bet you could park at the International Falls airport for about the same cost. I'd make a couple calls to set it up and cross the border in one car.

Some ideas that come to mind are service stations, the airport, and even a local church if their parking lot is big enough."
2711890,Skywagon,2014-04-22 20:14:00,1106,"Unless it has changed, parking is free at the airport, INL (hint)."
