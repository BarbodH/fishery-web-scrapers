2712713,northernbite,2014-04-23 06:48:00,1186,"So camping on island next to water is Ok? You just can't go back in bush and sit up, right? Paul"
2714073,bigwalleye1,2014-04-23 11:42:00,2632,"Actually, I believe it's just the opposite. Can't camp within 1/2 mile of the water in some areas if you're a non-resident unless you're in a campground. For example, non-resident bush camping on islands in Lac Seul is verboten."
2714106,strength22,2014-04-23 11:45:00,49,Good to see i started a camping thread.
2714170,northernbite,2014-04-23 12:03:00,1186,"I looked it up and I understand. That is in the ""green Area"". Paul"
2714217,IaDave,2014-04-23 12:29:00,476,Good one- I have made a few solo trips and never camped. I find most places will accommodate a single person especially the time you are looking to go- I guess it would just take a few phone calls. I can't help you on that area as my solo trips were on LOW and around the Sioux Lookout area. If interested on those areas send me a PM.
2709010,strength22,2014-04-22 08:20:00,49,Looking for a trip the 2nd week of august and want to go by myself. Usually fish up in the red lake/gullrock area and I really like that area. I am familiar with it. Any suggestions on camps and costs of camps and camps willing to host a party of 1. My usual group is going up the 1st week of june and I can't get away from work at that time this year but do not want to miss a trip. I usually fish alone and prefer to fish alone anyway so a trip alone seems like something i would enjoy. Thank you in advance.

2709178,strength22,2014-04-22 08:51:00,49,That was a thought but I do not have my own boat.
2709562,prov1800,2014-04-22 10:40:00,5010,"Although that is a nice thought and even if you had a boat , camping on crown land as a non resident is not allowed only a half mile from a shoreline.the camp owner organization had that law brought in so you pretty much have to stay at some kind of facility."
2709658,wallydave,2014-04-22 11:03:00,2151,"Give Andrea a call at Goose Bay Camp near Ear Falls. She has daily rates, cabins and boats, plus a bath house if you camp out."
2710482,lenray,2014-04-22 14:40:00,467,Not sure what you are stating here----I am from Michigan--we boat up a river and into a lake about 15 miles and camp there. Are you saying we need to camp 1/2 mile from the water???????????????
2712034,walleye IA,2014-04-22 20:35:00,129,"Yep, I also do trip like lenray. Always put the tent about 20' from the water. Are you concerned about safety at all. A lot can happen. Just saying. Good luck with what ever you decide."
2712098,roscoe33,2014-04-22 20:45:00,653,"You can camp on Crown land in many places, but there are restrictions in other places."
2712234,prov1800,2014-04-22 21:24:00,5010,Your restricted to camping a 1/2 mile from water with a camping permit on crown land if your a non resident.not my rule.
2712705,northernbite,2014-04-23 06:46:00,1186,"Lenray; I think we are fine where we go, you know what I mean. Paul"
