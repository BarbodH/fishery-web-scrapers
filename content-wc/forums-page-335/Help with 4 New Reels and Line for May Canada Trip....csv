I currently have 2 Pflueger Templar 35's, 2 diawa regals in 2500 size , 2 pfleuger presidents in the 30 size and a quantum accurist in the 20 size. Thing I am concerned about is the weight of these options as well as the price I paid for them. Just dont want these to be toooo heavy... Mainly fishing Walleye, smallmouth and pike in canada as well as central WI. Fishing rods (2) 6.0 M Fenwick HMX - Refub St Croix 6.3 M Avid - Refurb 6.6 M St Croix Triumph Templar: 10.4 ($30 on sale at cabelas) Regal:11.4 ($25 clearance at cabelas) President. 8.3 ($40 after trade in and rebate at GM) Accurist: 10.7 ($40 on sale at GM) Let me know what your thoughts are on bang for your buck, reel size and line type..."
