Only baits we ever use are jigs with either white or yellow twister bodies. Nothing fancy but they consistently catch fish. Great camp, lake and boats. Fire me off a private message and I can help you out a bit more with more info on spots we had success on while there."
1072972,cowboyd,2009-01-11 00:52:00,33,Greetings new member wondering if anyone has ever used Air-Dale outfitters and in particular fished the above lake. Our group takes both a spring and fall trip to Canada every year for...........oh heck forever lol and last five or so years we experiment with new lakes on the spring trip. Fall is almost always on Wabakimi.Thanks in advance for any help.Richard
1073653,Guest,2009-01-14 08:29:00,0,"I have been to Apisabigo three times in last six years (once with the guys, twice with my wife and another couple). Our going back is best testimony to the experience, but here are some brief specifics. Cabin: Very very nice, great location on rock above lake with full view of lake. Running water, shower, lots room and big deck. One of top two cabins I have seen in more than 15 past flyins. Service: Always top notch. Very accomodating and never a problem. You will be friends with them forever after your first trip. Fishing: We go in early August and have seen good walleye and scattered pike (we don't focus on the latter). There are two portgage lakes which have produced as good or better than main lake. We have seen a lot of walleye greater than 21"" with the biggest 29"". Their 2009 brochure shows a couple of 40"" plus northerns from last summer from this lake. If you book a trip and want more fishing information and don't mind posting your e-mail, I'll respond directly to you later."
1112462,cowboyd,2009-06-09 22:45:00,33,"Well here is the skinny from our point of view. The cabin is by far the nicest I have ever stayed in for an outpost situation. I clearly shows they take care of the place......heck even the outhouse was freshly painted. They were indeed very friendly but there were a few problems. First the bait order didn't seem to make it even though I had confirmed it with Gary on the phone. I was more concerned about the finger pointing from the aspect that the lake base said Gary had never given it to them and of course Gary said he did. Secondly they fly small four seaters and for the first time in many many years had to pay for a second flight in to bring extra food and of course the minnows. In fact one of our group elected to come in on the second plane because he was just uncomfortable about how it was loaded. FWIW two of us are pretty stout men, one above average and of course a skinny one to make us all feel bad. Even with one of the big men up front it was very crowded trying to get the other three in the back seat. Just keep that in mind because the extra flight was $400.00. The only other problem was we had ordered two cases of coke zero for the diabetic guy and when we got there it was regular coke but we had enough water and diet coke to get him by. Mistakes happen but it did bother me that when we got back and I mentioned it the girl at the base....I mean woman said she just didn't understand it because she had sent her husband out himself to buy it. Bottom line is I would have thought more of them if they had made a gesture just to credit it but they didn't offer and Ididn't ask.Fishing was slow but the setting was great, lots of weather systems from being blown off the lake one afternoon to waking to snow the next morning ( we went in may 29) had some rain and hail for good measure and of course just enough sun to keep up our spirits. I suspect that even though we had to work hard for our fish better weather conditions would certainly make a difference.Before I forget while I will repeat the cabin and facilities were far superior to anything else fly in wise those of you with older members should be aware that the cabin sits above the water and acess is by way of a pretty steep angled rock. Perfectly doable but we did make sure to watch one of our party just in case.Bottom line nice people who take good care of what they have but attitude leaves a bit of room for improvement. I would certainly try it if interested just learn from our trip and double check your bait and beverages as well as watch what you bring. Pricing is very reasonable and even with the extra flight falls right in line or even beats many other camps. Four people is the absolute max you can get into one plane so the fifith and sixth I would have to assume would required a second flight that should be included but check with them. That would more than handle any marginal weight too.good fishingDick"

2692650,forgop,2014-04-17 22:32:00,880,"Not sure what the issue seems to be with regards to the charge for the extra flight as I believe all outfitters will charge you for overweight or at least if you are so far over you require an extra flight. The flight is the most significant portion of your expense it seems, so if your group of 4 can't make one flight, they have to recoup that cost somehow. If you've flown on a bigger aircrat in the past, you're paying for the extra cost built-in for your trip with any other outfitter. As far as the bait/drink orders, that I can understand would be frustrating."

2696426,JayM5209,2014-04-18 20:15:00,1050,"""Anglers may not use live yellow perch and alewife as bait anywhere in Ontario."" From the 2014 Ontario regs found here http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business...ge/198684.html. This is not new. It's been the law for as long as I can remember."

2702714,Guest,2014-04-20 17:22:00,0,"That's an interesting regulation. In suppose its in force to protect fisheries from the introduction of species not already in the fishery. Perch certainly are not an endangered species Looking at the list of allowable species which is quite extensive, I noticed darter species and others that here in Pa. are considered endangered. I know sculpins and darters are in trouble in the great lakes due to the tremendous incursion of the round goby. I was under the impression that if your baitfish was legally caught by allowable hook and line fishing, it could be used as bait. Many times a pike will make that decision for you. Worms (always in nonsoil) in conjunction with jigs and spinner rigs do the job for me. Not to say minnows are not the ticket at times."
