You then boat across the lake, only resort on about 3 lakes. Keith Ammmerman owns it, real nice, low key guy. We'e had average to good fishing all the time. 16ft boats, 15hp motors, excellent shape. Most cabins don't have toilet, one big one does with shower, 50 bucks extra. Keith probably has about 75% repeat business. Lots of places close to cabins, but we usually fish at upper end of lake where river runs into it. Several excellent spots, Keith will tell you where. Can fish Whitemud Lake, one spot there is terrific and worth the long ride up there. We have fished in July and August, never in early June. Go after July 1 to 10, after mayfly hatch is over. Fish have not been huge, biggest we had is an 8lb walleye and about a 10 lb northern. Even if fishing is slow, we get 25 to 30 fish a day per day, more if they are hitting. We don't fish hard though, if we are out 8 hours it is a long day. Also we only ever fish lindy rigs, minnows, little joe spinners,, red, silver and chartreuse. Some jigs, some spoons trolling and casting the rivers for northern. Never have tried crankbaits in the river, but always want to. While I have not reserved yet, due to the other guys not being certain as to time off, I will probably go back up in late july or august. You should be able to email me at [email protected] if you need any more info. If you'r looking for a lowkey, not fancy, cook your self, but good boats and motors, fishing usually ok somewhere, this is good place to go. It is quite isolated, no fishing pressure, no other resorts, but you can get in and leave whenever you want. Don't go in with a new motorhome, (although I did see one guy do it). the last mile or two is a bulldozed lane which is pretty narrow. Email me,, I can add to it."
