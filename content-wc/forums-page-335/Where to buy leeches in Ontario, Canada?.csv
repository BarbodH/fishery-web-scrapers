513897,Guest,2001-07-14 07:04:00,0,"Assistance please:I live in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada and I have been having difficulty finding information on where I can purchase leeches by the pound.I have been to the local Ottawa bait shops and none are interested in selling me black ribbon leeches by the pound. In addition, they don't seem to have any interest in trying to satisfy my requirements (for instance, I tried unsuccessfully to have them order 3 inch ribbon leeches for a walleye trip). Does anyone know of or have experience with an Ontario leech supplier that can cater to mail order leeches similar to Vados (MN) at vadosbait.com. Thanks in advance. Jay"
