Last spring I noticed a lot of boats where trolling pulling various plugs, etc. Just wondered if anyone would be willing to share some secrets on spring trolling such as -how fast to troll, how deep of water, type, size, color of bait to pull, type of structure to target, etc. Any help would be great."
2681801,BreezyPoint,2014-04-15 12:53:00,1581,"What part of LOTW are you fishing? It's a big lake and I have found the walleyes behave differently in different areas.That being said, early in the season, I have caught many walleyes on sandy/mucky bottoms trolling crank baits in 6-10 feet of water, preferably against a developing weedline. Better still is if you can find a spot like that with some wind."
2681817,deadhead1,2014-04-15 12:56:00,193,"I fish north east corner, east of Kenora down to Andrew bay and Allie island area."
2681825,BreezyPoint,2014-04-15 12:58:00,1581,"That's one of the few areas I haven't fished. I have fished the NW Angle, and in general found the walleyes to be deeper there (10-15 feet)."
2685569,stumcfar,2014-04-16 13:25:00,451,"I don't fish the same area as you, but have great luck from opener on (when the ice is out) trolling plugs in Buffalo Bay on the Manitoba side of LOW. #7 shad raps trolled between 2 and 3 mph works the best for me. Alot of people still feel you need to vertical jig to catch fish early in the year, but that is just not true. A few years ago my wife and I brought in a very nice limit of walleyes on opener in Manitoba. We went into the cleaning house and two older fellows were in there cleaning 3, 13 inchers. They immediately started asking questions about where we were fishing and what we were using. When I told them shadraps, the one guy got mad and started calling me a liar along with some other adjectives. I cleaned my fish with a grin as they grumbled and left!"
2695106,benn,2014-04-18 14:55:00,48,We fish the NW Angle in early June. Primarily pull shallow running plugs along the weed lines. Anywhere from 5' to 10'. Wind blowing in is a good thing! We've found speed is not that important.
