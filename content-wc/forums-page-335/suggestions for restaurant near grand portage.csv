Did some tripadvisor searching, but would trust suggestions from fellow fishermen much more than the typical sightseer traveling through.Anywhere from Grand Marais through Thunder Bay would be a possiblility.Thanks"
2690018,Bill Krejca,2014-04-17 12:14:00,6107,"There doesn't seem to be a lot of options in that area, that are on the main road. A few years ago we ate at a small cafe just as we were coming in to Thunder Bay, but it has closed down, the service was poor. As we go to Nakina, we stop for breakfast at a truck stop in Nipigon, but I don't believe you are heading that way. Sorry I can't be very helpful. Good luck. Bill"
2690082,Fishingfinn,2014-04-17 12:25:00,30,"I live in Thunder Bay and there's not a whole lot between here and the border. In Thunder Bay the most popular breakfast place is the ""Hoito"" restaurant on Bay st. Good food and good prices but usually pretty busy. If you're coming from as far south as Tofte, then I highly recommend bluefin bay restaurant. Absolutely amazing food, their smoked salmon omelette is amazing!"
2690338,bode,2014-04-17 12:57:00,39,Might give Hoito a try--had heard some good things about a place on Dawson Rd called Sweet G's. Not too far off the main road and we usually get groceries at a place just off Dawson.Used to go to Nakina for about 12 years or so until the fly-ins got too expensive for our group. Now fish Caribou Lake near Armstrong. Good fishing and tons cheaper.
2690882,KTroller,2014-04-17 14:29:00,237,The casino in Grand Portage has a decent breakfast.KT
2695026,Bill Krejca,2014-04-18 14:28:00,6107,"We've wanted to try it, as we stay there over night. Unfortunately, it doesn't open as early as we need it to. Bill"
2697418,Jarbear,2014-04-19 06:51:00,24,"Blue Water Caf√© in Grand Marais is outstanding. We stay in Grand Marais on our way to Canada. We hit this place for a early breakfast. Good service, great food, large portions, and reasonable prices."
2698122,bode,2014-04-19 11:16:00,39,Thanks for the info--hopefully they open early as we usually head toward the border about 5:30-6.
2701994,drew59,2014-04-20 12:19:00,87,We eat breakfast every year at the Blue Water on our way to Armstrong. It's great but they open at 7:00 AM.
2703530,rockrunner,2014-04-20 21:23:00,205,"Coming into Thunder Bay via highway 61 you might want to try stopping at the Best Western Nor' Wester hotel right on the highway. Nice coffee shop and a popular spot for my 80 year old parents to drive out to for breakfast. Moving right along down the highway and heading toward town as you pass the airport and approach Arthur St. You can make a left hand turn onto Arthur St. and travel West 300-400 yards to the next set of lights and make a left and go to the Valhalla hotel for breakfast. You can see the hotel from Highway 61. They have an nice breakfast and once again not a big detour from your main route, you can finnish breakfast at either spot and be quickly back on the highway. That would be important for me, I wouldn't want to be hunting and driving all over town for breakfast. If you make a right on Arthur St. and travel east you will have a short drive to McDonalds."
