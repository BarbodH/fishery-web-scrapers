2686425,acplumber,2014-04-16 16:50:00,80,G'day I'm one of the lucky ones that booked a week on a fly in for the opener We are flying in north of nakina. Where would u start looking for the walleyes? I know the rivers and current are a good bet but that's about the extent of my knowledge. And what would u use to find em? I wouldn't mind trying bottom bouncers with a harness. Thanks Steve

If you run into a cool weather period where the shallows are not warming fish will often move into nearby deeper water and may not be aggressive......a Lindy rig and minnow may be the best option."

Our group fishes west of Red Lake (fly-in) 50 miles in the Woodland Caribou Park. We are roughly the same parallel give or take. I would fish super shallow and find the warmest water you can. Watch the prop and boat. Im serious, don't ever think you are too shallow. Find streams, inlets/outlets, current and spawning areas. I highly doubt you'll catch anything in 20'+ as the water will still be extremely cold. Jigs, twister tails, lindy's, minnows/worms and you are straight. Bottom bouncers IMO are better for late spring, summer, fall when the fish are deeper. Take an assortment of colors. If you like to cast you'll love to fish this time of the year. I'd grab a few shad raps #9 to #11 and cast until you are tired. I catch a ton of fish casting in the early spring when fish are in the shallows. Have fun!"

We always start at the mouth of the river and jig with twister tails and troll with big hot-n-tots, smithwick rogues or other minnow type lure. All less than 10 ft deep. Being e3arly they are stacked up in the current. Both walleye and pike. We could fish that one spot all week but usually try some others. Find current and rocks and shallow! They will be there. Good fishing."
