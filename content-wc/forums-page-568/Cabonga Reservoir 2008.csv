Looks like a great place from the looks of their site. What month best? Tactics for eyes? Perch(for kids)? Any help would be greatly appreciated.Thanx and Tight Lines, eyecrosser."
569099,joepa,2007-09-20 08:47:00,366,"eyecrosser, I was there three years ago. There are quite a few cabins available that are nicely furnished with running water, indoor toilet facilities and indoor showers. Cabonga is a huge reservoir and we found that you had to travel some distance to get to decent fishing spots. A good GPS and a good map is essential along with a decent fishfinder. I have an 1800 Lund Fisherman and we had problems getting it launched because of the shallow water. The owners will put the boat in for you with their tractor however. I went in the first week of September. The fishing was tough but we did catch some nice walleye and pike. The fishing is reportedly a lot better in July I don't know if it is a place I would take young kids though. It is an easy place to get lost and/or run into some rocks. I dinged my prop a couple of times. If you do go, bring some red & white worm harnesses & lots of nightcrawlers. Single or double red & white blades seem to be the ticket. Also, 3/8 to 1/2 oz. chartreuse & orange jigs with a 3"" chartreuse curly tail grub tipped with about a 1/2 inch piece of nightcrawler worked well. I have gone to Pavillon Cabonga and Deer Horn. I prefer Deer Horn because of quite a few reasons. The 18 mile dirt road to the camp at Deer Horn can be really rough in spots. I have a contraption on the back of my truck that prevents rocks from flying up. It seemed to help. Let me know if you decide to go there and I will give you some helpful hints about where to fish."

569156,Guest,2007-09-24 06:10:00,0,"A group of us have been going to Deerhorn for several years. Our usual trip was just after the fourth of july but this year we went in late june because of other commitments. We know the lake somewhat by now and our last three trips have been exceptional. We've had our traveling limits by the second day and after that its catch and release except for shore lunches. Occasionally we will catch pike in the 24 to 40 inch sizes but our main target is walleye. We do dedicate a day to run for lake trout and we have been successful using lead core. Cabonga is a nice piece of water and I feel the walleye fishing has really come on in the last couple of years due to the high level of water they have maintained. It helps to have someone who knows the lake because its really made up of small lakes connected by narrows. My main fishing buddy who drives his own boat and I know the lake well but occasionally I will ask our fishing partners where we are and they haven't a clue. It wouldn't be a bad idea to hire a guide, (Garys a good one) to get the lay on the lake. Good luck."
569161,Guest,2007-09-24 10:43:00,0,"A group of us are planning a fishing trip for 2008. I did some surfing and came across Deer Horn Lodge on the Cabonga Reservoir.Many years ago the same group went to Dorval Lodge on Lac Fallion (North of Deer Horn).Don't know if the place even exists anymore. We had a great time. Twenty feet of water with a nightcrawler and everyone would have a walleye on at the same time. So, after years of very slim pickens for walleye in Ontario Cananda (Bob's Lake) we've decided to try another spot. We really enjoy fishing and would like to be able to catch walleye. One friend is coming from Mass, another from Conn, a few of us from Upstate Ny so we will be coming from quite far away. The only information I have been able to find on Deer Horn is surfacing around the web and from their web site, which I found very helpful. I'd be interested in hearing from others that have been there. Any information would be most appreciated. Good time to go? How about mid to late July after the black flies go away. How about that 18 miles of gravel road getting into the lodge. Just how poor is it? Of there 20 cottages which would you suggest for 5 guys? If we decided on renting two boats/motors (two in one and three in the other) would we be able to get to the locations on the lake and catch some walleyes. From the postings I'm seeing shall we plan on getting lost as we boat around? How about bait, lures? Gee, I have so many questions, maybe I'll just put this out and see what information I might get back. Thanks so much, RS"
1072422,joepa,2009-01-08 12:02:00,366,"rab or anyone else, do you know how to get to lake andou from the Deer Horn camp on the cabonga? Someone gave me directions several years ago but I know the directions he gave me couldn't have been right. I ended up in a shallow stump infested area with no way to get through."
1074329,gpbrown,2009-01-17 16:58:00,359,"Joepa, You turn right just as you leave the inlet/bay to DHL go past the dam and keep heading in a southerly direction. Hard to tell you exactly with out a map. You have to go through two narrows if memory serves me correct."
1074401,joepa,2009-01-18 08:25:00,366,"Thanks, gpbrown. I will have to get my map out and check out the area you refer. I thought I had it before, but I'm getting older and you know how that goes."
1113918,Guest,2009-06-16 03:06:00,0,"Four of us are going up on saturday. Steve's last report was june 5 and he indicated that the weather hadn't warmed up yet. I don't think that will be a problem this coming week but it may extend the black fly season. Pack your headnets! I wonder if the Barriere dam work has effected the water level. If any poster has been up recently, please give a report."
1115556,RUDE TROOPER,2009-06-22 13:13:00,65,"RAB, looking forward to a post upon your return from DHL. Me and the family will be headed up July 11th for 8 days. Man I can't wait! Good luck and let's here some good stories!"
1115985,still fishin',2009-06-23 23:52:00,69,"Just returned from Deer Horn. Started fishing 6-13-09 and wrapped it up 6-19-09. Worst fishing in years. The weather was hot and sunny with no rain and almost no breeze (drift). Only one in our group of 8 caught more than 10 walleyes during the week. We did manage to boat 4-5 fish in the 20-21 inch range. No doubt the bite will turn on any day now, just disappointed it didn't happen while we were there. We've had many excellent years there and we hope that we got the bad one out of the way. Looking foward to next June already. The black flies were awful (as usual in June) but the water level was normal."
1117589,Guest,2009-06-30 18:00:00,0,"Cabonga reservoir was very different from the past two seasons. The water is high, but I think the cold beginning to June is the reason for the difficult fishing. Gary, one of the guides, felt the season was three weeks behind and that the walleye were not biting as they should. Frank, Steves's man in the office, said the fishing was really tough. Our group of four really lucked out, one of our spots turned on and we caught many walleye. We enjoyed two shore lunches of walleye and our 24 fish take-home limit were all 20 inches and above. All our fish were taken in ten feet or less of water, on minnow, shallow divers with a !!!small piece of worm!!! on the middle hook. If you don't think the worm makes a difference, talk your buddy into fishing without it and see what happens. In my opinion the lake will turn on everywhere shortly and I would love to be there when it does. I hope you guys will be there for it. We marked tons of fish in deeper water but they weren't in feeding position. We were there from Sunday to Thursday -a short trip for us, but we have no complaints. We ran to deeper water on Wednesday and caught several lake trout. I was the lucky one and caught two beauties. Check the website. I got into two photos this year. We didn't target pike but I caught several up to 30 inches. I did hook up with a small perch, I assume, while we were trolling and while bringing it in I had a strike and lost everything including a five inch steel leader. I have caught 40 inch pike in the area and can only guess. The road in is poor condition, take it slow. I hope the fish turn on for you. Please post after you trip. Good luck....RAB."
1118328,RUDE TROOPER,2009-07-04 06:47:00,65,We figured with the weather here in NY that things might be a few weeks behind up north. I talked with Steve two days ago and he said that things were definetly headed in the right diretion. This is the earliest I have been north. Our first 3 trips were so-so as far as quantity of fish. Maybe this is our year to run out of bait!
575782,eatsleepfish,2008-07-04 21:07:00,52,">Just returned from Deer Horn 2 weeks ago. Excellent walleye By the way, how was the water level?"
575830,Guest,2008-07-07 03:42:00,0,"Bringing you own boat even on a relatively short gravel road like the one into Deerhorn is always an adventure. This year I lost the nut to my boats steering arm but that was just the obvious. Who knows what else fell off. We had no problems with black flies on our week but they always say the fishing is best when the flies are the worst. The Cabonga was as high as I've ever seen it, but that might change when they begin repairing the Barriere Dam. The guys I fish with can't seem to get their bearings on the Cabonga. I must have a built in gps cause I make the fifteen mile run for lake trout without looking at a map."
575832,eatsleepfish,2008-07-07 06:09:00,52,"That's good news because we have the cabin with the private lagoon and are hoping that we can pull the boat right in. It's fifteen miles to Stern's Pass? I remember it taking a long time to get there but when we were up there last (2005) all we had was 25hp on a 16 foot tracker and probably made 10 to 15 mph. My dad and got into down rigging for trout the last time we were up there and only caught two small ones. This year, we have a bigger boat, more sophisticated equipment: GPS, Sonar in one screen, and downriggers mounted to the boat - so I think we'll do much better this time around. That road is something. First time we did it, 1981, was in a Diesel VW Rabbit and we thought we were going to die. Over the years it got easier and then when we got our first boat in 2000, it all changed again. The fastest we did it was in 25 minutes (without a boat) and the longest was probably 1 hour 30 minutes the first time with a boat. We'll see how we do this time now that we are pulling a heavier boat. My only fear at this point is whether our cover will last - Cabelas sold us the wrong cover and we have just a week to see if they can overnight us the correct cover. If Steve has internet access, I plan on posting daily fishing reports on my blog: http://eatsleepfish.blogspot.com"
575857,Guest,2008-07-08 03:49:00,0,"One thing I forgot to mention about the road into Deerhorn. On the way in it was a terrible ride but going out, about half way, there was a road grader doing as good a job as one can, to smooth it out. I don't know how long his work will last, but good luck. Steve is posting fishing reports almost daily so he must have internet availability."
1043773,RUDE TROOPER,2008-07-19 11:14:00,65,"I can't believe that another year has gone by. Thank god it has because I am leaving next Sunday for Deer Horn lodge. This is my second year to the Hamel facility. I love the location and facilities. The price, the quality of fishing, the cabins, the docks...everything is top notch! You set your schedule and eat what you brought. Look forward to spending another wonderful week in the Canadian wilds."
1043906,eatsleepfish,2008-07-20 09:57:00,52,"tough fishing! The walleye were initially biting but it was still tough and then the weather changed and it went downhill from there! If it wasn't for catching 3 lakers the trip would have really sucked. Still it was nice getting back to DHL after a three year hiatus and really getting out to new parts of the lake. Having the 90 hp makes a big, big difference! Oh, and I know most of you don't fish for pike up there, but the pike fishing was even worse! I think what it means is that for anyone going up in August, you are going to have great fishing. Steve said that June was really wet and the mayfly hatch was still going on, meaning there's lots to eat. For example, we were fishing south of Ile Fog, right ontop a school of walleyes and dropped jigs on them, trolled through with plugs and worm rigs, and still got nothing."

575748,McQ,2008-07-03 18:13:00,615,"Don't confuse the Clova Road with access to the Gouin Reservoir. The Parent Road (accessed through Mont Laurier) is the new route and has been so for quite a few years now. The reason the Clova Road is in such terrible shape is the lack of logging activity therefore no maintenance, On the other hand the operations are in full swing in the Parent sector and the road is like a four lane highway. Was in and out last weekend and averaged 60 mph all the way. There are a few short sections that were washboardy (we expect that after a heavy rain) but nothing that slowed us down too long. The road is graded on a weekly schedule at this time of year. I'm heading up again tomorrow morning - I'll post a report when I return. By the way the best fish from our group at Nemio last week was a 32 1/2 incher that weighed in at 12 lbs."

575752,Guest,2008-07-03 21:39:00,0,"Just returned from Deer Horn 2 weeks ago. Excellent walleye bite, very few fish under 18"". I boated several over 20"" in 1 day (largest was 25"" and 5 lbs.) Best days were rainy. Used worm rigs and trolled cranks to catch 'em. I'll admit that I'd be lost on the water if I didn't go with several gents who have been going up there for years and know their way around. We did however catch many fish within 1/2 mile of camp. Black flies were the worst in years, but as long as the fish are biting as much as the flies I'll have no complaints. It truly is God's country and worth the hassle of getting there."
575754,eatsleepfish,2008-07-03 23:33:00,52,Where does the Parent Road go? Baskatong? Gouin?

575757,eatsleepfish,2008-07-04 07:07:00,52,">Goes to the Gouin But it's essentially a ""rock"" road, not paved, n'est pa? Pulling a boat down one of those roads is pretty painful. To go to DHL, it's only 18 miles in and can be done in an hour. I forget the exact distance to the Gouin but, somewhere between 60 and 100 miles, you are looking at a three to five hour trip assuming you can maintain 20 miles an hour. Don't forget, most people from the US tend to bring their own boats. Personally, I'd love to fish the Gouin sometime but getting there is the hardest pill to swallow."

569311,Guest,2007-10-01 07:51:00,0,"RAB, Do you know anything about Bark Lake Lodge on the Cabonga Reservoir? Perhaps how it compares to Deerhorn?"
569398,Guest,2007-10-08 11:56:00,0,"Sorry it took so long to reply, been doing some late season vacationing. A four day trip to Southern Ontario produced some impressive walleye fishing for 15 to 20 inch fish. Reguarding Bark Lake Lodge......I've heard of it, have seen their website, but I'm not at all familiar with that area of Cabonga. Just my opinion, but it seems to me that success on semi wilderness lakes like Cabonga is something that is built over numerous trips. Simply put, you get to know the productive areas. Our group has taken some ""wilderness"" trips where the walleye were aggressive enough to be caught in the prop wash. If I were to try Bark Lake Lodge, I would strongly consider taking a guide the first day out, and go it on my own after that. One thing that was reinforced on our recent successful trip, and its certainly no secret, that when you get a consistent wind (we had one for four days) into a particular shoreline or bay on a walleye lake, your going to catch fish......good luck if you get on the Cabonga."
569578,Guest,2007-10-19 06:17:00,0,"I appreciate RAB's feedback on Deer Horn lodge located on the Cabonga Reservoir. I'd be interested in hearing from others that may have gone to Deer Horn in 2007. Perhaps you'd share your experiences on the fishing there, the accommodations, how you found your way around as you fished the many waters. For those that went there for the first time, share your thoughts, what you would do differently, what went well. As we will be traveling many miles/hours from several states in the US any information on the lodge to assist us with planning the trip would be appreciated. This will be our first time at Deer Horn, planning on going in 2008, either last week in July or first week in August. Would you suggest the all inclusive package; boat/motor, cabin, ice, baits, permits, taxes, etc? Is there anything the all inclusive package doesn't include (maybe just fishing licenses) We will have five of us going so we were thinking or either three in one boat and two in the other or maybe get one of the larger boats all five of us would fit into. Your thoughts on boat selection? We do like to troll some so maybe the larger boats would not be the best choice(?). thanks again, RGS"
569580,joepa,2007-10-19 08:02:00,366,"RGS, This message board helped me the most my first time there. Guys were kind enough to send me copies of their maps of Cabonga and some vital points when navigating. I think the first thing you should do if you really have decided to go there, is send for a good map. From Deer Horn, to fish the eastern side of Cabonga, you have to find the channel, bird poop rock, monkey rock, etc. You need to have a good map and a gps. For the first timer, everything looks the same. We passed the channel twice before we found it. You also have to watch for the rocks which in most cases are marked with jugs. Knowing where the jugs are doesn't always mean you can see them clearly. The wind and chop sometimes makes it difficult. Studying the map before the trip helps tremendously. Of course the owners will give you their map that is marked, but I bought a colored waterproof and tearproof one for $25.00. It was well worth it. I think I left my map in my boat, I'll see if I can find it and let you know where you can send for one."
575487,eatsleepfish,2008-06-25 18:41:00,52,"I have been going to DHL since 1981. After a two year hiatus I am heading back up next month and I am excited like you wouldn't believe because I haven't been fishing literally in three years! My father said that Steve now has wireless internet up there. I hope that is the case because I will be blogging each day of the fishing trip. It will also save on calls back home using an instant messenger. If you haven't gone yet and want to ask me any questions on where to go or how to fish, feel free to ask. I think Steve now sells Bathymetric maps from Trax. You can get a chip for the older model Garmin GPS/Sounders but their software doesn't support Garmin's new Bluewater3 format. I just got a Lowrance with the Canada chip! Cost $100 clams at Cabelas but worth every penny because it has depths."

Dorval Lodge is on Dozois Reservoir - which is in the park west of Cabonga. Dozois Reservoir is a big res. as well. Lac Faillon is north of the park off the Penetration Road out of Senneterre
575721,eatsleepfish,2008-07-02 19:01:00,52,Getting to the Dozois is a bear - I hear it's something like 100 miles down the Clova Road (unpaved logging road) and if you are pulling a boat it can be an all day ride. And from what I hear there are always issues on the Clova with wash outs and the like. I'd like to try it sometime but getting there is too painful. The 28 clicks to DHL is enough for me.
575723,Andre (wallyandre),2008-07-03 04:18:00,2274,Reservoir Dozois is accessible by pave road and you launch at the Dorval Lodge.
575736,Guest,2008-07-03 11:48:00,0,"Our group just got back from Deerhorn. The walleye fishing was very good. Solid fish in the 17 to 22 inch class. Had no problem getting limits. Pike fishing is poor. Only got a couple worth deboning, but we don't target pike. Got two 20 inch lake trout on the one day we made that run but that bite seems to chage daily. Good luck on your trip."
569170,Guest,2007-09-25 04:18:00,0,"The logging road into Deerhorn is typical of most in the area. The local native people drive it fast, but they're not pulling a boat. My advice, if you don't want to lose all you fillings, is to take it ""slow"". Black fly season can differ year to. On our trip last year in late june we had no problem. The first couple of weeks after the fourth of july have been good for us. Reguarding information on good walleye areas in Quebec. Most info comes from the area north of Cabonga (i.e. Gouin). Good Ontario walleye fishing is mostly a northwetern Ontario thing with the exception of the bay of Quinte. Dorval lodge is still there (under new management). Used to be owned by the Hamel family who still own Deerhorn. No bumpy road to get there. Our group likes the cabins on the furthest point at Deerhorn, 1 2 and 3. Two of them are large enough to accomodate six. Some walleye fisherman prefer to jig and really don't enjoy trolling. We do both but prefer trolling. Hot'n'tots and Brads E-chips are the hot lures for us right now. (Always put a small piece of worm on the middle hook, you'd be amazed). Everyone has different skills in finding their way around new lakes, more importantly, finding your way back. Its amazing the way the shoreline merges into one undisernible mass at dusk. Even areas close to the lodge were productive last year. Next year, who knows? Steve Hamels rental boats will get you to productive water. Maps are available along with good advice. You may find a group that will help you get to some of the areas a bit harder to find. We've been blessed with our last three trips to Deerhorn. The weather has been decent, the fishing great, we've seen bears, moose, eagles, and beaver on occasion, had great shore lunches, but I must add that we know the place pretty well by now. Many other groups do well on the walleye, probably better than us, and you never seen them out on the water, except perhaps on the run back in and at the fish cleaning hut. There are places way out that hold great potential for good walleye fishing that we have not been to in years. We haven't had to. Hope this helps....good luck."
