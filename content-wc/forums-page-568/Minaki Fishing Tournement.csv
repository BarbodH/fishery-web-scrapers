1119071,woods,2009-07-07 11:13:00,646,"I have a friend who was up there for the tournament, and he said the resort owner where he stayed said Sunday was the worst wind he had seen in the 40 years he lived in Minaki!"
1119104,Guest,2009-07-07 13:18:00,0,It was pretty bad. Ripped our dock from the cribbing Saturday night with four boats attached.
1119481,Pat,2009-07-08 20:54:00,203,that week and the that first weekend (the tournament weekend) was challenging on the water! But during the bad weather we had two of the best fishing days for walleye. Later in the week when the sun reappeared the bite slowed down some but was still good.
