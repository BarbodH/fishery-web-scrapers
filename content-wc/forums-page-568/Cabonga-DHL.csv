1119021,RUDE TROOPER,2009-07-07 08:14:00,65,Well we are T-minus 3 days and counting before departure. Question for the forum. My wife is bringing the laptop and wondering if anyone else has done so at DHL? Any problems with the wireless hook-up? Would like to post some pictures and fishing updates for you guys here. Mike
