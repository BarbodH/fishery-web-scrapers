1118433,Hammerhead Herb,2009-07-04 15:44:00,259,"Looking at my map, I see that there is a bypass aroun Dryden (SW of Dryden - route 594?). What kind of shape is it in and does it save anytime? Also, before you get to the 594 turn-off, there is another road south, that goes to Eagle river. What kind of shape is that and does it save any time. Heading to Ear Falls on the 19th of July."
1118441,v-bay gord,2009-07-04 17:38:00,3168,"The 594 way through to Eagle River does not save time, plus you will be on gravel and a road with many curves. The other road you mention is Ojibway Drive which connects to 502 south of Dryden. This way will save you time. It passes through the native reserve and connects to 594 closer to Eagle River. While not a great road, the time saving is worth it."
1118446,Glenman12,2009-07-04 18:52:00,762,You would know better than me but last year we did Ojibway to 594 and this year we did 594...we really didnt see too much difference in time. Both have some rough spots where you have to go pretty slow..we would almost think that going to Dryden and then west would be just as fast..havent been that way in years though..what do you think?
1118452,Golden Eagle,2009-07-04 19:41:00,2642,"I take a left on 594, then go north on the dirt road to Oxdrift. Then west on 17. I believe it saves me about 12 miles and we avoid Dryden traffic. Be careful crossing the railroad tracks near Oxdrift. Those trains are quiet and sneaky. I turn off the radio, roll down the windows and come to a complete stop so I can look and listen."
1118581,cruiseforever,2009-07-05 14:07:00,177,I think the by-pass is the road that goes to the west of the papermill.
1118934,Steve of Madison,2009-07-06 20:28:00,230,"The road Golden Eagle is refering to is Adams rd. I take it every trip and it saves at least 15-20 minutes. It is gravel, but passable, there are a couple of tight corners if you are meeting someone else going the other way, so slow down. Another benefit is the possibility of a bear, deer, or something else adding to the drive."
1118993,Babamel2,2009-07-07 07:14:00,414,"We always come up the 502 and take the highway (495 whatever the number is-- what you call the bypass) into Dryen. The only issue we have had is one person in our group complained about ""the stop lights could be timed better."" He had to stop at all 3, therefore his complaint. We all got a good laugh from that."
1119304,mata,2009-07-08 08:31:00,78,"take gordon rd west edge of dryden, as quick as any way, no gravel or stop lights!"
