1118630,Obabikon,2009-07-05 18:02:00,2370,"You can also walk around with two pieces of wood and a small chain perfectly legal. However, if you put them together... HAHA, I just think that one's dumb. It's a misconception on what's a dangerous weapon."
1118792,JinxCanada,2009-07-06 11:51:00,1306,"well, the laws don't always make sense man....that's just how it is."
1118833,Guest,2009-07-06 14:14:00,0,"Thanks, What is a CBSA Officer?"
1118857,rebs,2009-07-06 15:46:00,7587,"yes I would like to know that also, I have heard it both ways, that it is considered a firearm and illegal and that it is not considered a firearm and is legal. I asked a US Coast Guard offficer and he said it is legal in Canada, but others have said it is not legal, which is right ?"
1118876,hogridnfool,2009-07-06 16:48:00,349,CBSA stands for Canadian Border Services Agency. My guess would be a border guard.
1111332,JinxCanada,2009-06-05 20:37:00,1306,"besides the obvious hand guns/pistols...please see the Criminal Code of Canada for specifics as to which knives would be illegal, but to make it simple for you i'll break it down.it is illegal to possess:butterfly knives (or any knife that opens by centrifugal force)switch blades knives (or any knife that opens by depressing a button to release a spring loaded blade)any knife which has a handle perpendicular to the blade (push daggers, constant companions such as in a belt buckle etc)any knife which has spikes on it or on the handle (same as push dagger)knives concealed within inoccuous objects such as a brush (handle pulls out to be a knife plastic or otherwise) swords concealed within a cane for example as well.there are NO restrictions on length of blade, double edged, **** you can bring a sword with ya if you want. it is fine and dandy.some other prohibited weapons that will get you arrested when crossing into Canada:stun guns/tasers of any kindthrowing starsnun chaku (nun chucks)morning star (dunno why you'd have one but there ya go)pepper spray or mace etc. i hope this helps"
1111351,Stu,2009-06-06 00:06:00,472,Is it possible to buy bear spray in Canada? I had a close call once and sure could have used it.
1111355,mike0212,2009-06-06 02:06:00,5,yes you can buy it in Canada....
1111387,pegasis0066,2009-06-06 07:08:00,64,Who owns throwing stars
1111448,Obabikon,2009-06-06 12:55:00,2370,Nun chucks? Those are just two pieces of wood connected by a little chain... a sharp fillet knife does A LOT more damage.
1111463,JinxCanada,2009-06-06 14:31:00,1306,"yes, you can have ""dog spray"" and ""bear spray"" it is a loophole in the law...however, make sure you never use it on a person regardless. if the cannister says ""pepper spray"" or ""mace"" it is 100% illegal"
1111464,JinxCanada,2009-06-06 14:33:00,1306,"LOL i never said it made sense, i just put it out there as it is written in the law. technically, you can walk around with a sword strapped to your waist legally. there is a misconception that blades over a certain length (6"" usually i hear most often) double edged blades, etc etc are illegal, which is not true. i'm only putting the facts out there to help people make good decisions."
1112003,elmo,2009-06-08 13:28:00,43,"A buddy of mine and his wife/son went through I Falls with some mace did not even remember he had it until they asked him. He told them he did, we were ahead of him in the next truck and they pulled off to the side and turned around and went back to Minnesota,we thought he left something back home in Missouri. A phone call from our party told us they were told to go and turn himself in to the police in I Falls. He went to a trash can dumpster and sprayed it out and came back through. Of all people to break the law a police officer."
1112020,JinxCanada,2009-06-08 14:16:00,1306,"let me be clear, IF you bring a prohibited weapon/device/item and DECLARE it you will not get in trouble. you will either surrender it to the Crown, or be turned around to the USA to leave it there (as with mace/pepper spray) the ONLY time you will get yourself in hot water is if you do not declare it and it is found. honesty is always your best policy"
1112305,Guest,2009-06-09 13:47:00,0,You seem to know alot about whats legal or not. What about the flare pistol that is sold as part of an emergency boating kit?
