May 14, I was about 10 minutes north of Ear Falls when I got a close photo of a wolf, two bears and a moose, all within 12 minutes. Saw lots more moose and many more bears than usual, both going and coming. Bears were sluggish May 14. Maybe they knew what was coming the next morning.Met your neighbor, Don Maw, May 30 on the way home. Shook his hand, but didn't get a photo of him."
