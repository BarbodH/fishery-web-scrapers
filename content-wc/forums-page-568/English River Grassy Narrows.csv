1115811,greenie,2009-06-23 12:01:00,87,How high is the river this year??? Last year was really high! Made it easy at camp on the island. Didn't have walk as far up and down the hill. Anyone been up there?
1115829,Glenman12,2009-06-23 12:39:00,762,My buddy just got back from that area...he said the water level was the highest he's ever seen it in over 20 years of going up there..
1116101,greenie,2009-06-24 12:29:00,87,Last year the marina - lodge was surrounded by water!!
1116171,Coach BWS,2009-06-24 16:58:00,38,Last year when we were up there in late July they shut off the power to the Marina. Do you know if the power is on at the current time?
1116617,greenie,2009-06-26 11:52:00,87,I don't know about this year? That's why I was wondering how high the water is. Guess best bet is to call Rodney and ask. We don't go up til Aug. 14th!! WOO WHO!!! Can't wait!
1116646,Coach BWS,2009-06-26 13:47:00,38,A group from my home town just left for there this morning so I will be able to let you know when they get back on Tuesday.
1117113,greenie,2009-06-29 05:49:00,87,"Thanks, Coach!"
1117224,ret-ro,2009-06-29 12:36:00,41,"The water is high again. Right up to the front steps of the lodge. Just returned on the 24th. Everything is operational at the lodge. Fishing was really good for us, but the walleyes were shallow yet. The guys pounding the usual suspects in 8-10 fow were mostly catching the little ones. Most of our eyes came from 3-7 fow pitching jigs/twisters to shore and slow retrieve. Many eyes came from the reeds and scattered cabbage areas also. I believe the fish are just beginning to slide out a little deeper."
1118640,Coach BWS,2009-07-05 18:52:00,38,"Re-tro's reply was right on with what I was told about this area. Last hydrology report I saw showed the water going down, but it is slowly. The road down to the Marina office is not under water as it was last year so that is a good thing. They did say the Tommys road going in the last mile or so was the worst they had ever seen it."
