Most of the fish we got were 20-22"" on average. Biggest was 26.5"" off the end of the dock at the cabin. Jig and minnow, Rapala's, Jig and crawler, Trolling all worked. Had a couple big ones but lost them. Couldn't get any in the weeds like last year at this exact same time. I was hauling a 15"" Eye and a 35"" Northern took a swipe just at the same moment the net went in the water and we got the Northern and Walleye in the Net! Northern never got a bite of the Eye but just happened to try at the wrong time I guess!Dman617"
1117756,stevensinks,2009-07-01 11:37:00,330,"dman thanks for the report, My wife and I are headed to Red Lake 3 weeks from today. What part of the lake were you on. Other than the Pike you talked about [ cool story ] did you do any pike fishing?"
1118531,dman617,2009-07-05 08:50:00,117,"We did a little pike fishing combined with walleye. Caught both on Rapala's and spinnerbaits. I managed a 36"" Northern for the biggest. We were in St. Pauls Bay. I would imagine by the time you get up there, the eyes and bigger northern will be in deeper water. Weeds were not too bad yet.We usually fish around Burnt Island and always do well. Find a rock point and start in about 20ft, that's where I'd start. Fish seem to be running on the larger size, we only caught a handful under 18"". It seems like the the fish were scattered quite a bit. Fish seemed to be everywhere within reasonable depth. 5-20 ft. hard to pattern but we did good.D"

1119069,tackleman,2009-07-07 11:06:00,444,"If you cross at that point you are about 1500 miles from Red Lake.Get a map of ONtario and turn to the northwest corner of the province, locate the trans canada highway #17 and follow it to a junction of highway 105 that heads north, take 105 to the end. That is Red Lake."
