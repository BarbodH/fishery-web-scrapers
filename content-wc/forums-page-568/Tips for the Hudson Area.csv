If you have been there recently and would be willing to share, that would be great.If you are going in the near future, will return before July 20, and would be willing to share, that would be great.If you have fished that are before and would be willing to share, that would be great.Thank you for any information you share... I have fished Lac Seul before but not this area, so I need some help.Tight Lines..."

Out on Lac seul we had very good luck directly north of Mahkwa lodge across to what i believe is called Twin points bay.There is a sand bank in the mouth of the bay that has a very sharp dropoff.Sit on that break and have fun. Also if you are near Mahkwa try the area around the stumps and small rock island especialliy in the evening.We caught several trophy walleyes there Good Luck!!!! Im wishing i was back there!"

1118423,LUCKWI,2009-07-04 15:10:00,13,Im not real sure about getting there from Hudson.We always stay at Mahkwa but i do know there is a launch in Hudson.I really dont know how far of a run by boat it would be.Maybe there is someone out there who would know a little better. As far as trailing in to that area you have to be a guest of the First nations resorts(mahkwa is one of them). Mahkwa put in a new boat launch there this year.You might try to call them and see if they would allow you to use the launch They might for a price. Or a new resort called Lac Seul adventures is right there also dont know much about them but they also have a launch which is right at mouth of Vaughn lake Good Luck
