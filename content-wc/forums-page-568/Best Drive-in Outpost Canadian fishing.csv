1116669,Bigfishhunter,2009-06-26 15:36:00,803,"I know that most of the posters on here are di-hard Ontario Goers, but in in my opinion, the best drive in would be - either 1. Bakers Narrows Lodge - Athapapaskow Lake Manitoba 2. Caribou Outfitters Lodge - Cranberry Lakes Manitoba. Google Either one and check them out. They are 7 hours north of Winnipeg Manitoba and well worth the drive let me tell you."
1116764,Glenman12,2009-06-27 06:51:00,762,I just got back from my 25th trip to Cedar Lake..I cant speak to the green bloom in August as we go up in June...Cedar Lake is 19 miles long and has only 4 camps on it..not once have I ever felt crowded or seen all the boat traffic you claim it has..must be only in August..
1117109,Kevin R,2009-06-29 05:24:00,305,"If you fish late July early August you will see a lot of boats when going from Cedar into Perrault. I counted about 30 pass by in less than an hour one day. It seams like more boats come into that river area that connects the lakes, if you stay on the arms of Cedar you will see few boats. I think there is 8-10 camps on the chain of lakes & Perrault has one long row of homes on the south shore. last year seamed like a lot more boat traffic than in the past. Traffic thins in mid to late August & few boats out in September. I have never been on Cedar in June."
1119411,Guest,2009-07-08 16:16:00,0,Do you have any contact information for the 2 resorts on Lake Poshkokogan? I do not seem to be able to locate. Many thanks
1093010,Guest,2009-04-01 00:56:00,0,"id try contacting Gateway North Ourfitters or Showalters Flyin outposts, i couldnt think of any two better outfits, its a toss up"
1093273,drlee,2009-04-01 17:34:00,409,"Just kidding. There are so many great drive in camps out there! I love to fish out of my own boat, so I prefer drive in camps. I have flown in, and its a great experience, too. I have driven into probably 15 different lakes over 20 years. I have settled on two: Lake Pashkokogan, just south of Pickle Lake. It has only two camps and you better take in all the groceries and liquid libations you want, 'cause Pickle Lake is 45 miles. Also, I love Press Lake. Also north of Ignace, about 30 miles. Then, you take a road that is 15 miles long and takes a hour to drive on a good day. Both lakes are large enough to provide diversity, but small enough that if the fish are not biting in one area, is not a half a day run to another option. Both are good numbers lakes for walleyes, though I would not say lots of big fish. Doesn't mean you won't get them...I have had walleyes barely under 30"" on both lakes...just not many. But, if you like walleyes in the 16"" to 22"" range, you will like these lakes. Northerns, which I consider to be a nuisance, are plentiful and get pretty darn big on both systems, particularly Pashkokogan. Some huge small mouth on Press. Camps are both sparkling clean, great owners who are easy to get along with, and guests who are mainly repeat customers; they are willing to share their experiences, as I would be. Both camps are reasonably priced, less than $400 per person per week with your own boat. They do have minimums, usually 4 people per cabin. I see lots of husband/wife teams at Press; somewhat less at Pashkokogan, since there is a central shower house for most cabins (but indoor toilets and running hot/cold water in all). The central shower house is a **** of a lot better than sharing one small shower with 4 ugly guys, in my opinion. Fishing in northern Ontario is an absolute TRIP! I now spend 4 weeks per summer up there and may do 5 next summer (yeah, I am retired). Gotta start packing for my month long trip to Arkansas to fish the White River for Trout and Lake Norfork for whatever I can catch...so, see ya' later!"
1093335,lobo1,2009-04-01 21:09:00,734,great report !!!! thanks for the input on the thread...... I have driven past these areas on the way to Pickle Lake and knew there must be great fishing but never was able to stop. You caught my attention with the Arkansas references - Norfork etc. I was wondering if you could let me know how that goes and what the ins and outs are..........we would like to hear of your experiences....it may be off topic here in this forum but maybe you could send to my email [email protected] There are stripers and huge crappies and walleyes in the lake and trout in the river and lots and lots of gin clear water which makes fishing kinda tough (I was there for a few days a a couple years ago)...was wondering what you thought and get a report when you return if you dont mind! thanks lobo1
1093668,Guest,2009-04-02 22:17:00,0,Might as well say mantion it. Anglers Kingdom on nungesser lake.
1094001,JinxCanada,2009-04-04 08:51:00,1306,"not that it's secluded at all, but i sure hope you plan to drop by the detroit river for the walleye run this april. should be a good one, and you'll catch a TON of fish...we have great smallmouth action too btw, and muskie galore! :-)"
1116337,IowaDave,2009-06-25 08:27:00,69,Any reports from anyone that's been to a drive-in outpost this season? Looking into going to one next year & would like as many suggestions & recommendations as possible. Thanks!
1116388,JayM5209,2009-06-25 12:18:00,1050,"Gold Arrow Camp, north of Vermillion Bay right on Hwy. 105 ten miles south of Perrault Falls. Don and Sharon Moore are at the top of the list as owners/hosts. After 31 years of annual visits, my group and I keep going back. Fish a different lake every day - some you can drive your rig to, others have cached boats. You can spend many of the days on a lake and not see another boat, or maybe one or two. We always go during the time from opening day to mid-June and have never had a bad trip, even the year it rains all seven days! In addition to the species you mentioned, you can drop your rig into Cliff Lake or Aerobus Lake for a day of lake trout fishing.Check out Gold Arrow at http://www.fishandhuntontario.com/index.html."
1116395,Guest,2009-06-25 12:33:00,0,"For a secluded drive in outpost check with Cobblestone Lodge.They have a nice outpost cabin on Kukukus Lake about 20 miles north of the main lodge.Our group has fished there twice(two 5 day trips).You have access to three lakes.When we were there the Northern fishing was fairly steady with 28""- 32"" being avg. a few larger.Walleyes were spotty but good avg. size.We saw a couple other boats out on the big lake-Kukukus,but that was it.For a drive to it's fairly isolated."
1116570,Kevin R,2009-06-26 06:37:00,305,"Many miles of water with conecting lakes, but Cedar is hardly secluded lots of Cabins Camps & boats. Water is dark then green bloom in August. I have fished on many other lakes on 105 some you never see another boat others have loads of boats Cedar, Perrault & Wabaskang have the most boat traffic of all the lakes I have fished."
1116593,IowaDave,2009-06-26 08:39:00,69,JayM....I sent you a PM.
1086101,scoutn,2009-03-07 16:49:00,21,"Looking for advice on a secluded Canadian drive-in-outpost fishing experience for three SD fishermen. Walleyes, smallies, pike, muskies. Any experience with Cedar Lake at Perrault Falls ON? Would like to drive-in with my rig for a week. Typically better fishing late June or mid-late July in mid-to-northern Canada?"
1086108,Glenman12,2009-03-07 17:56:00,762,"This year will be my 25 year of going to Cedar Lake in Perrault Falls..its a great lake and has all four of the species you are looking for..we go the first or second week in June and have had great luck..as for secluded outposts...theres only 4 working lodges on the lake and none of them have outposts...Cedar Lake Lodge, which is on an island, has an ""outpost"" on a smaller island on the lake thats only a few minutes from the landing..but it sleeps as many as 13 and Im pretty sure they prefer a minimum of 6 people..you can call them and ask ..their website is sportfishin.com"
1086302,@Lunker,2009-03-08 16:30:00,835,"Not sure just how remote you want to get because this isn't far enough north for you, but check out www.witchbay.comIt's 2 hours from Fort Frances to the camp road, just a bit before you get to Kenora, and then 7 miles in on your typical scenic, rustic Canadian road - just about enough time to finish a cold one while listening to a little Jimmy Buffet .Closest camp to Witch Bay is about 10 miles by water so there's virtually no competition for fishing spots, which are myriad on NE Lake of the Woods. Fishing for walleye, smallies and pike collectively will be better earlier while your muskie fishing doesn't really turn bonkers until water temps hit 70 degrees, which is mid-July or so, depending on how seasonal the weather is."
1089371,Raymond3588,2009-03-19 19:24:00,3,If you are lookin' for remote you'll have to go 100 miles up Hwy 105 to Red Lake Area. Can recommend Medicine Store Resort or Howey Bay Camps (both in/near Red Lake). You can use your own boat/gear at either location. Make sure your boat has range ability of 50 to 100 miles/day. I know Howey Bay Camps has remote drive in lake options but not sure if they have cabins or you'll be tentin' it. We fished out of Howey Bay in 1970's and 1980's with respectable luck.
1089374,King Canada,2009-03-19 19:32:00,27,You absolutely can't go wrong with Howey Bay Camp. The Town of Red Lake is a fascinating place.
1089438,Bill Krejca,2009-03-20 06:14:00,6107,"West of Nakina is O'Sullivan's Rainbow, on O'Sullivan Lake. Excellent walleye fishing, both quantity and size. It is drive-to, in the middle of the wilderness, and also has an outpost cabin about 5 miles down the lake. Rates are good, owners are friendly.www.osullivansrainbow.com Bill Krejca"
1089486,Waxy,2009-03-20 09:19:00,2938,"If you want true northern Canada wilderness and fantastic fishing (minus the bass), check out the Hanson Lake Road in northern Saskatchewan. Waxy"
1089688,Stu,2009-03-21 05:23:00,472,"Last year we went to Thaddeus Lake. It's about an hour north of Dryden, the last 25 miles are on a gravel road. Very Secluded. It's the only lodge on the lake and there are only a few private cabins. You can also fish Ord and Moose Lakes. No resorts on these either. Excellent fishing for Northern and Walleye. We caught alot of Smallies but nothing huge (we didn't really try). It is also an excellent Musky lake, but we were there before the opener. Saw some really nice ones in the shallows though. Without a doubt the best drive-to lake I've ever fished! All trophies are catch & release as are all Muskies. Good luck - Stu"
1091110,scoutn,2009-03-25 21:59:00,21,Thanks guys keep 'em coming...all the recommendations are fun to check out! We're looking for hardcore fishing for bigger-than-average fish in a remote setting.
1091683,lobo1,2009-03-27 18:25:00,734,secluded. great facility. great equipment. lots of walleye and pike (some as big as muskies) no bass . no muskiewww.oldpost.com
