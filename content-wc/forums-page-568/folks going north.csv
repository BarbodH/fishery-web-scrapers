1118281,alanexpup,2009-07-03 20:16:00,278,Hi. Just looking to see how the economy has affected folks going north this year. is it good or bad this year so far?
1118321,MN_Moose,2009-07-04 05:53:00,965,Our camp owner told us tourism is down 80%. I don't think it looked that bad but maybe down 50%.
1118326,RUDE TROOPER,2009-07-04 06:39:00,65,"We leave next Saturday for a week at DHL. From what I have seen on Mr. Hamels website, all the cabins appear to be booked as normal. We'll let you know when we get back."
1118365,Larry Mac,2009-07-04 09:09:00,530,"We were up Sat June 20 for a week and the camp was full. We are Returning North (different camp) August 1st we will see then. I believe many camp owners have done a great job adjusting to this difficult economy and accommodating their customer base. Great Job!Thank you,Larry Mac"

I can say the traffic was way down to previous years. Also noticed a lot of empty spaces in the motel lots as well. fish everyday like it's your last.....Wallace
1118565,Flip Silverlake,2009-07-05 12:15:00,645,Same folks at the same times. You wouldn't know there is a recession going on or what ever they call it this week.
1118577,Guest,2009-07-05 13:46:00,0,"I just returned from a week up there. In my 30 years of going the traffic was never as light as it was this year. Nestor Falls and Souix Narrows looked uninhabited, lots of open parking spaces around the resorts. I crossed the boarder at 9:00 am on a Friday morning via International Falls and there was not one car in front of me, came back the following Friday at 3:00 pm and not one car in front of me going back into the US. Things looked pretty bleek up there if you ask me."
1118655,172EYES,2009-07-05 19:36:00,22,Just got back from our trip yesterday. We were the only ones in camp for several days. Many people taking trips of less than 1 week. Owner says only one group in camp next week as well and things are tough all over. We did have to wait 25 minutes at the border at during prime time at noon Saturday coming home.
