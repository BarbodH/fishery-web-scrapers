1118004,81Saluki,2009-07-02 10:56:00,97,"Just returned from fishing the Indian Lake Chain just north of Vermilion Bay, ON. Am curious what trends y'all may have experienced over the past few years regarding the number of boats on the water in the area (Indian Lake chain, Eagle Lake, Lac Seul, Red Lake, Gull Rock, Wabigoon, Lake of the Woods, etc.) We've been fishing the Indian Lake Chain since 1994-ish. In ""the old days"", we would compete with 3+ dozen boats for our favorite holes. This year, we pretty much had the whole place to ourselves ... at the peak we only saw 8 boats fishing or searching for a spot. And none tried to muscle their way into where we were fishing. Bottom line: Compared to previous years, how many boats did you see on the water this year and/or the occupancy of the camp you stayed at? Just curious. On one hand I like seeing fewer boats on the water because it means reduced fishing pressure and better catches. On the other hand, it sure has to be hard on the local camps/lodges."

That lot is generally full with at least 40 to 50 trailers. When the outfitter came in to the dock he had ONE boat returning. That should answer the question. It must be really slow. We fished Abrams and Minnitaki Lakes, there wasn't the traffic that we saw 2 years ago. The camp was full most of the time with the old regulars, the younger people were not there."
1118152,Glenman12,2009-07-03 06:14:00,762,Was on Cedar Lake the week of June 13th and there were definitely fewer boats although our camp was full

1118729,stumcfar,2009-07-06 07:21:00,451,Stayed at a camp near Ear Falls a few weeks ago and they said their bookings were down 60% from last year. This a good camp with reasonable rates and great accomodations and boats.
1118744,Hump,2009-07-06 08:41:00,578,How was the fishing? What areas were good. We go in three weeks.
1118761,stumcfar,2009-07-06 09:49:00,451,"For us fishing was good, not great. It warmed up the day we left and got nice the next week and it sounded like the fish really turned on. Our best fishing was in the Herb's Point area and the stumps just before there and also the mouth of the sanctuary as it wasn't open yet when we were there. I would guess that things will have changed alot and the fish will be in different areas when you get up there. Good luck, wish I was going back."
