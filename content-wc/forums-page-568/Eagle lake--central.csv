1118389,eyemike,2009-07-04 12:21:00,233,"fishinnut3446, I'm going up the 8th of August. Staying at Stanley's Resort in the west arm. It's my first trip to Eagle Lake so I'm pretty excited. I hope you have a fabulous trip and lets hear your reports when you get back. Mike"
1118390,Guest,2009-07-04 12:22:00,0,"Eagle Lake is huge and if this is your first trip there, I would recommend hiring a guide for a day or two. They can out you on mid lake humps and show you how to fish for the Summer Walleyes. The other fish like Northern Pike, Smallies, and Muskies are in the lake in large numbers, as well. A guide can give you ideas on where to look for these species and the baits/techniques to use. You can catch fish, on your own, by using your sonar and lake map, but you'll get more fish by having a guide share his/her knowledge with you. Good Luck"

1118959,Eyes_R_Us,2009-07-06 22:36:00,66,I might be able to help you. I fish that same area every year and stay at Pine Beach Lodge which is around the point a ways from South Shore. I usually go up there in June but have been there once or twice in mid July. I will send you a PM. JB
