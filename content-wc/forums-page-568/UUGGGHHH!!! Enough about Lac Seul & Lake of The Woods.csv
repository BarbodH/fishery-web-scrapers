1117893,WalleyeWally28,2009-07-01 19:04:00,298,"Hey Teddi,Sounds like you fish everyday out of Evergreen. Are you guiding for Pat and Gary?"
1117895,teddi,2009-07-01 19:08:00,349,no guiding. i just spend a lot of time up there during the summer and fall.
1117899,lunker99,2009-07-01 19:17:00,236,"I thought lac seul and l.o.w. were the only two lakes in Canada, besides the little pond called rainy. So there's other lakes up there? Just thought they were swamps mixed with the trees on the way up to Ear Falls."
1117901,WalleyeWally28,2009-07-01 19:29:00,298,We'll watch for you on the lake and hopefully we can hook up.
1117953,OFxCoyote,2009-07-02 06:52:00,15,"I notice that lot of you guys keep refering to Ear Falls, what is your take on Long Legged Lake? Five of us are heading there from the 17th thru the 23rd. We're leaving Kansas at 6am on Wednesday the 15th and staying at Hotel 105 Bar & grill until we head to the lodge Friday morning. Just curious about some pointers for the lake. Thanks In Advance"
1118000,joeman79,2009-07-02 10:32:00,417,Are you going to the North Lake? If you are I have been there and it was great walleye fishing and Lake Trout was good as well. PM me and I will tell you what I know. Where I went you boated in off a road north of Kenora like 80 miles of rock road.
1118039,billyb,2009-07-02 14:18:00,3,"Well, there's Savant Lake, Caribou Lake, Lake Nipigon, all VERY LARGE lakes with very little crowds, no houseboats, few if any, private cottages. Plenty of Walleye, Pike and Lakers. Maybe it's time for a change, change is good. There's sooooo much more to Ontario than the commercialized Dryden, Red Lake & Kenora areas. But hey, some people like being fished on top of. FIsh on!"
1118040,billyb,2009-07-02 14:21:00,3,"Hey Lunker, not UP there, but over here. Try central and to the east. Less commercialized, less money, less crowds, = biger and better, fish on!!!! But hey, if your stuck in a rut.....and like that sort of thing, stay to the west."
1118087,Jigger1,2009-07-02 18:25:00,234,"16 days until year 10 at SWWL which is located in the south central part of Lac Seul. Didn't think it was going to happen this year but was able to sneak a trip in with my son. Over the last 9 years with the exception of seeing SWWL boats, we maybe see an occasional boat or two during the day moving across the lake. I think the primary reason we've seen other boats is because we've always been there on Canada Day and it will be interesting to see how many, if any, I see this trip in mid to late July."
1118176,srj,2009-07-03 08:08:00,971,"Geez BillyB, a little extreme I think. Lac Suel is certainly one of the best (if not the best) drive-to walleye lakes in NW Ontario. And a long ways from being crowded. In 30 years of fishing LS, only a couple times have I had a boat move in near me. I'm not familiar with all of LS, so it might be different in other parts of the lake. For what it's worth, there is quite a bit less boat traffic now than in the 80's. And LOW---hard to imagine a better multi-species body of water with easy access. Trophy fish of many species:musky, pike, walleye, smallmouth, largemouth, crappies, whitefish and of course, lake trout in some areas. And of course the huge sturgeon but mainly on the south side. Deep and clear or stained and shallower--it's an awesome body of water. A bit more boat traffic but far from crowded. Gotta tell you, I love Nipigon. One of the most beautiful spots on the planet. The size of the lakers is incredible-so is the size of the lake. But if you plan on walleye for supper, your location options are kinda narrow in my experience. And if you get a NW blow, well, hopefully your boat is on the trailer so you can head elsewhere. Maybe if you stay in South Bay or up NE you could stay on the water but forget the big lake. Sure wish I get my boat into Savant. When you talk fly-in or train-in lakes, there certainly are lots more choices. Time and money limit most U.S. visitors. We are very lucky to have so many great bodies of water to visit. I really enjoy all threads about Canada fishing. Perhaps you could give some insight into the areas you mention---a bit more than ""big lakes"". Good fishing to you."
1117577,billyb,2009-06-30 17:24:00,3,on Lac Seul
1117580,teddi,2009-06-30 17:28:00,349,suck it up dude. low and lac seul are the two most fished lakes in northwestern ontario so live with it.
1117776,bigtimeelectric,2009-07-01 12:24:00,174,"I here you brother, fortunately for me I fish lac seul so I like it....What lakes would you like to talk about? I would like to discuss cross bay near grand rapids,mb however everytime I post on it nobody has anything to say about it......................Anyway leaving for lac seul 1 week from saturday can't wait crossing my fingers for good weather cause I know the fish will be there just gotta patern them........................!"
1117792,Obabikon,2009-07-01 13:14:00,2370,"We could just not make any posts at all. Also, there's one thread on each for the main page. Just skip looking at them."
1117826,WalleyeWally28,2009-07-01 14:47:00,298,"Been fishing LS For the past 12 years. Leaving Fri. for the 1st of 2 trips this year. Can't seem to get enough current info. PLEEEZE keep the posts coming. I'm sure the LOTW guys feel the same way. Hey Teddi, you live there. How about giving us the straight scoop on this supposed chemical spill in the NW part of the lake?"
1117845,teddi,2009-07-01 16:08:00,349,what spill? i have been out on the lake every day. nothing new. a bunch of b.s. fishing is very good as always. some things never change.
1117851,WalleyeWally28,2009-07-01 16:18:00,298,"Teddi,That's what I thought but there have been 2 posts referring to the spill so I thought it should be clarified for everyone. Thanks"
1117855,teddi,2009-07-01 16:27:00,349,where are you going on your first trip? maybe we can touch base if you are going to my area?
1117863,WalleyeWally28,2009-07-01 16:45:00,298,"We'll be staying about 5 miles south of Ear Falls. Weather permitting we usually fish McKenzie on south thru Ghost. One day of the week we always go on down into the Big Lake. We are 2 couples with 2 boats. I'll be in a Crestliner with a 175 Opti and the other boat is an Alumacraft with a 135 Opti. We always run and fish with our tops up so we are easy to spot. Also, we monitor channel 69 on our marine radios. Give us a holler."
1117879,teddi,2009-07-01 17:28:00,349,you are from sioux falls so i may have seen you at the sports show there. i am there every year. look for you out on the lake. look for a evergreen lodge boat.
