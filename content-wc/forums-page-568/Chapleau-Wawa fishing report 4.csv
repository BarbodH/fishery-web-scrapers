The blackflies are almost done the mosquitoes are starting to get badand the may flies are hatching. The bass are starting to hit good and they are in the shallows on their nest. Whitefish are starting to hit. I use orange rapalas size 5 and 7 trolling at 1.4 miles an hour in 6 -12 feet of water. The walleye are deep and a late bite mostly after nine. Its been slow. Until some overcast days come with some wind the walleye will stay deep. For the guys coming next week be prepared for the hot sunny days.(between 86 and 90) Just to warn everyone bring every method of mosquitoe replent their is.(Yes guys wear the nets) With this hot weather the mosquitoes will be swarming soon.Oh, give me grace to catch a fish so big that even I when taklking of it afterwards may have no need to lie-Unknown"

We are having light rain today and we should have a good day of walleye fishing before the guys go home. The weather forcast is still calling for upper 80's and sunny next week.The mosquitoes are out. Leeches were working well for walleye last night."
