This is sort of an extrapolation on the old ""gold versus silver"" experiment. I'll be fishing a lake for the first time and am thinking about how to most efficiently narrow presentations to those that are most effective. I've managed to glean a little information about what's worked for others on the lake, so I have some starting points in terms of baits, colors etc. We'll have 11 days of fishing, so there's plenty of time to try out a lot of things. There's only two of us going, and we'll be in Ontario and limited to fishing one line apiece. I've come up with a list of bait styles and colors, and intend to draw up a sequence for rotating through them until we hit on something that seems to work. We'll start with whatever our host suggests and go from there. I'm giving strong consideration to trolling three-way rigs with crankbait/spinner harness combos to start with, to cover more water as well as get a few more options out there for the fish. I also intend to experiment with being purposefully contrarian. For example, I hear chartreuse is a popular color on this lake, so I plan to give purple a try (roughly the complimentary color of chart), stuff like that. Seems awful complicated for a ""vacation""! What do you guys do when faced with unfamiliar water and not alot of detailed scouting information? Is it worth the trouble planning all this out, or am I best off just winging it? I should add that I won't be fishing on any of the 200 fish-per-day lakes. We'll be fishing a lake with plenty of fish (Lac Des Mille Lacs), but it's likely they won't trip all over themselves jumping into the boat for us, and we might have to work to get them. Im interested in hearing others thoughts, approaches, experiences, etc."

If I can't find anyone with insight on the lake I start with the side the wind is blowing to. The baitfish will be pushed to that shore. Then look for rocky points, weed beds, drop offs, ect. I troll spinners/minnows to locate walleyes. Once you find them try similair spots, and other presentations."
