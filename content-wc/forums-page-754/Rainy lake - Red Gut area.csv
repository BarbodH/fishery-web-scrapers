548752,Guest,2005-06-02 15:39:00,0,"Red Gut as of 5/21 to 5/24; water temp 53 to 55F, Red Pine narrows slow most fish under slot. Most fish 11 to 19 feet, Ottertail River better, Lindy w/ floater around 20'. Locals were doing very well by railroad bridge around the corner from the fisheries, lots of high slots, lots of current. Seine river was 56 to 58F, lots of current, many fish, majority high slot, many 25 to 28"" ended up fishing there most of the trip. By the 18th Blueberry Island and the narrows should be going good."
