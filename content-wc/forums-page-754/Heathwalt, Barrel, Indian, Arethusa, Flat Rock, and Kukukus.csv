I am just wondering if anyone has any current info for these lakes. I know that the water is going to be high. Specifically, I'd like to know if anyone is catching anything at Heathwalt. I have never had luck on this lake. Probably due to my inferior fishing ability not due to lack of fish. Please let me know how it's going up there if you get a chance. Thanks."
