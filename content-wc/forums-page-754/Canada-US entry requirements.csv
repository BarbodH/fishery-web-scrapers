From what I can tell, this is being phased in, and does not totally go into effect until December 2007. (this info is available on the state dept web site). Anyone been to canada and back and had any trouble? It appears that currently they want photo id and birth certificate. How about ID for kids? Just curious, I have a trip planned for July, and don't want any suprises."

Several years ago my brother and I took our nieces fishing in Canada. They were ages 9 and 11. It never ocurred to us uncles to bring written notarized permission or a photo identification for the girls. (The girls did have certified birth certificates) They were taken asside and questioned. After a short delay we were allowed to continue. I think my nieces were a little intimidated by the process. No disrespect to the questioners, they were doing their job and the girls were quite young. I think anything you can do to assist the border authorities establish that the person named on the birth certificate is the child that is with you is a good idea. Many schools have identification cards for students. Have the child bring this as well as certified birth certificate, written notarized permission from stay at home parent or the parents or guardians if the child is not your child. Examples: unrelated, grandchild, nephew, niece. Another source of photo identification is through the state drivers bureaus. In Iowa, the Iowa Department of Transportation requires written consent of both parents and two primary sources of identification plus some secondary identification before issuing an identification card for nondriving under the age of (16?). Before going through the non drivers photo id route, check and see if there is a school identification card. If the child has one, you have the photo id question solved. I think generally, a family group, traveling together will have fewer problems than a nonparent and child. Even though a child's berth certificate or photo id may not often be examined, the border agent can demand them as well as written notarized permission-if applicable. In other words, prepare for the worst and hope for the best! Pooch and Trailerguy on this board are good sources of information on border crossing questions. I'm sure they and others can relay their more recent crossing experiences when children are involved. Good luck."

548952,Guest,2005-06-08 13:42:00,0,Interesting how times change when I took my daughter and nephews across 10 or 12 years ago it never occured to anyone that we would need anything other then the birth certificate. I never heard of the at DUI business either till I saw it on this site. Now in a couple years we'll need paasports to get back and forth.
