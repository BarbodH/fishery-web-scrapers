The weather wasn't very cooperative, but we really caught alot of big fish. With ice out and spawn being early, it changed our approach somewhat, but we managed to boat number of walleye from 23 to 28 inches. More than we could count in the slot. Hard to catch anything below the slot except for the last couple days. The first day of opener was by far the best, but they were all good. Went to an outpost on Lac Seul the second week. My son and I caught 672 fish in five days. Our biggest was a couple 26 inchers. Three smallmouth that were within a quarter inch being ""masters"". And the weather was fabulous. Alot of excitement with bears coming into camp. The mosquitos were getting really bad the last couple days. We flew out of the outpost early Saturday morning. One big disappointment about the outpost trip was the inconsiderate attidude of some fishermen. I always hoped what I seen would never happen among fishermen, but the crappy attidude; I own the lake and no one else is around and screw anyone who gets in my way....you get the picture. My friends in another boat and I were fishing this certain spot with enough room for both of us to fish. Here comes a boat --3910JK (state purposely omitted)ran right between us, never acknowledging we were there, turned came back and anchored right where we were fishing. Needless to say our fishing was over. I tried several times to put a jig in his anchor rope and try to pull his anchor free (there was current)but failed. Then I thought; I would not be any better them him by trying to do him bad. Just one instance.... all in all a great trip. Hopefully, the attitude of some won't make all of us American look too bad. eyesnatcher"

548978,Guest,2005-06-09 08:03:00,0,The place we stay is called: Abram Lake Park. Less then a mile south of Frog Rapids bridge on Hwy 72 south of Sioux Lookout. A great place to stay and I believe very reasonable. Paula and Allan do a great job keeping their clients accomodated. I have taken my 5th wheel there on numerous occasions and also stayed in their cabins which are extremely nice. It is a great place to stay and sits on Abram Lake with Minnitaki Lake next door. Their number is: (807)737-1247 Website: http://virtualnorth.com/abram/ hope this helps...Eyesnatcher

548997,Guest,2005-06-09 14:20:00,0,"Six of us just got back from 4 days on Lac Seul and the fishing was awesome. We caught lots of fish every day and over half of our fish were slot or above. Had our best luck in 4 to 10 ft of water with jig/minnow combo. We tried twister tails and did OK but not as good as live bait. Also caught some nice fish dragging Rapalas behind the boat. We caught several nice Pike with the biggest being 37"". Picked up a few bonus Smallmouth but really didnt fish for them, they were caught while jigging for Walleye."
