Water temp was 54*, they had 5 1/2"" of rain the week before we got there. There hasn't been much sunshine to warm the water yet. We caught fish but they didn't come easy, you had to be on your toes, or you missed them. I talked to another party that fished around Gawley's Bay and they had done well. The cottage thing is ongoing, honey do, you know. ;)"

We also limited out on walleye in 1 hour,16 for four guys. Still had fun catching and released them. We caught more fish toward nite time this year than any other time. The weather was also great too.Can't wait for next year."
