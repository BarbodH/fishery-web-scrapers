At least there is a number that appear close to where they deduct the GST. We always stay at a resort/campground a couple times during the year and we stop at the border to get our rebate. It doesn't take very long, however they charge a percentage, like 2 or 3 percent to process your rebate. That's pretty normal these days. Everyone has their hand out to make a buck. Even the Info Centre at Fort Frances charges 2% to exchange money. Another thing I found out this year is an additional charge by the credit card companies when using your Visa, etc. It is called ""Foreign Transaction Fee"". It amount to 3%. I was really surprised when there was a $21.00 charge for a $700.00 transaction. Hope this helps...eyesnatcher"
