548951,Guest,2005-06-08 13:16:00,0,"I recommend either Mylie's Place (www.myliesplace.com) or Buena Vista (www.buenavistaresort.com) on Lake of the Woods - near Morson, Ontario. Lots of walleyes, smallies and northerns to catch, beautiful scenery and about a six hour drive from Minneapolis going through Baudette. Either place isn't the most beautiful or luxurious resort in the world, but you can get out fishing no matter the wind and they will more than point you in the right direction on where to catch what you're looking for. A cool place I've boated by is Obabikon Bay Lodge (www.obabikon.com) on LOTW - which is a short boat ride from Morson and is on an island. Nice looking place and I hear they have good fishing right off their dock. It's also very close to excellent fishing. It would be a cool experience for a 6yr (or a 60 yr old for that matter)."

548921,Roddy,2005-06-07 22:50:00,488,"I am looking for a good drive in lake to bring my 6 year old to. I have told him for two years that when he is 6 I will bring him to Canada.He is now asking when we will be going. I am willing to drive up to 8 hours into Canada. He is able ot sit on Mille Lacs for 6 hours while only catching two fish. I would like to bring him somewhere that is affordable while having lots of fish (18-22"" Walleyes). We will be bringing our own boat. Thanks for any info. Please provide websites or phone numbers if possible."

548928,Guest,2005-06-08 07:20:00,0,"I would recommend somewhere up around Cranberry Portage in Manitoba. Reed Lake, Simonhouse, isquasum (spelling), Locke...etc. Should have good northerns and walleyes. If you go just a bit further, Kississing would be a good bet for walleyes as well. Big lake, get out to the west end and the walleyes are a blast. Decent numbers of Northerns as well. I have always camped, so I cannot help with resorts at all. Steve"
548929,wooglin,2005-06-08 07:29:00,371,"Whoops. 8 hours INTO Canada. Well, if you're willing to go that far into Canada, I'd suggest anywhere on Lac Seul."
548932,Guest,2005-06-08 07:36:00,0,"www.witchbay.com Its not an 8 hour drive into Canada but its sure an awesome place and they will point you in the right direction on where to fish. Maybe not the cheapest place but after going to approx 8 other places this is one of the best ""values"" for a upper class type of drive in camp, and fishing is simply... fantasic!"
548933,Guest,2005-06-08 08:04:00,0,"suggest http://www.islandvacationretreat.com/ on Red Lake. don't know where you'd be crossing from, but Red Lake is a 5 hour drive from Int'l Falls, MN. Drive to Cochenour where you'll dock and then boat 5 minutes to the modern resort that is on Mackenzie Island. if you don't want to pull up your own boat they have adequate rentals and will pick you up at the dock. Harry and Alice will point you to good fishing for walleye & pike areas 5-10 minutes from the resort, or there's 5 lakes and the upper and lower chiquini river(almost 70,000 total surface acres)in the district to explore. plenty of shore lunch and primitive camping locations with walking trails will provide adventure for you and your son. we've been going back year after year."
548934,Guest,2005-06-08 08:08:00,0,"http://www.ghostrivercamp.com/index.htm Try this camp. I have never been there but have talked to a few guys that have, and they loved it. If you go in July, or August, they have a special price if you have a child."
548945,Gary_IA,2005-06-08 12:21:00,144,"Don't know about the size range that you mention. My brother and his family stayed at Camp Wenasaga just north of Ear Falls and Lac Seul about 7 years ago. Good Walleye fishing and a one resort lake with a public boat access. My then 9 year old niece was catching fish before Dad got other lines baited and into the water. The lake has about 10 niles of shoreline and is fed by the Wenasaga River. www.wenasaga.com There are a number of nice resorts on Lac Seul but its a huge body of water. The Chamberlain Narrows at northeast corner is a long boat trip in and may be out of your price range. It would have the number and size of fish you want. I have no association personal, familial or financial with any of the the resorts mentioned."
548949,Guest,2005-06-08 12:39:00,0,"I have an eleven year old son. Next week we are leaving on our 6th trip to Canada fishing. The first two years we went for a one week stay and each time my son would cry when it was time to go home. We now go for two weeks and would stay longer if we could. We have tried a few different camps but enjoy Lac Seul Lodge the most. The fishing on Lac Seul will keep your son excited. We drive up also and live in Kansas so we have about a 20 hour trip. It's worth every minute behind the wheel. Good luck, I know your son will love it."
