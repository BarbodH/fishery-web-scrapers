The water was choppy, they didn't have their life jackets on and they didn't have the motor kill switch tether on their wrist. When the people came across the boat it was going around in a circle full blast. They were in a 16 ft boat with a 50 horse 4 stroke. To stop the boat they had to throw a rope tied between two logs to stop the prop. The Davis Bonny camp went over all the safety equipment with us, went over the operation of the boat, told us to always wear the safety kill switch tether and life jackets when out on the lake. They took us out on the lake and showed us around before we were allowed to go out on our own. This is the first camp since we have been going to Canada that has ever took the time to go over safety boat operating procedures. They are not sure what really happened, but I feel if they had been wearing their life jackets and had been wearing the kill switch tether they may have had a chance to make it. Wabigoon is a large lake and sometimes you don't see another boat for hours, so being safe is your responsibilty. I feel the camp does everything in their power to keep their guests safe, but if the guest don't use the safety equipment what can they do. This has been a big wakeup call for us, and it should be for anyone that goes out in a boat no matter how big of lake it is. Use your safety devices when out on the water and tragedy's like this can be avoided. :-("

I would guess, depending on the model of boat, you could get her up in the high-20's to low-30's mph with two guys and a 50. Was the motor running clean with no damage or did the hull have damage. To hit a rock, eject two men, and cause no damage to the boat or motor does not add up. What do you think the chances are, they'll release the full details of the autopsy to us here on Walleye Central??"

They had only recovered one body , so they had to keep searching for the other. We had to leave early saturday morning so we didn't hear anything about if the boat was damaged or not. Please be safe out on the water, you think it will never happen to you, but this hit too close to home for my liking."
548935,Guest,2005-06-08 08:09:00,0,"A similar tragedy on Eagle last year which drowned the driver of a boat and put the passengers in the lake may have been attributed to a split second where the driver took his hand off the tiller. With the steering friction set a little loose and giving the engine some throttle to get up on plane, there is considerable torque which would put you into a ""spin"" before you knew what hit you. All the more reason to have the tether switch on as well as the life jackets....but since I do neither who am I to preach. Still think todays equipment may be too much for some people to handle, but as always accidents do happen. Glad to know the resort was on top of the safety aspects and passing them on to their guests. As my wife keeps telling me....wear your life-jacket....this is probably good advice I may have to take."

I must admit I don't use the tether but I always were my jacket. I'll make an effort to use that tether, or at least hold it in my hand when running unfamiliar water. Most of the spots I fish I am very familiar with BUT....."
548972,Jesse-WI,2005-06-08 23:02:00,534,"Several years back in my early boating days, when I was stupid and did not wear either the vest or attach the kill switch I had one of those wake up calls. We were traveling at high speed when a wave we did not see on a very normal day suddenly shifted the boat hard to the left. The driver was thrown to floor of the boat and the passenger was hanging half way out the other side of the boat. WIth the steering wheel not being manned, the motor quickly turned and put us into an extreme hard left turn that caused us to hit the same wave again. The passenger was then thrown on top of the driver who was trying to reach the steering wheel. It was only luck, the driver was able to grab the kill switch tether and save us from certain disaster. Since the day, jackets and the kill switch are mandatory or you do not ride or drive in the boat. If you have people who care about you, please show them some care by practicing only safe boating."
