548939,Guest,2005-06-08 09:36:00,0,"Ha ha, the queens warehouse that would be slang for customs seizure and stored at the canada customs warehouse. You see Canada is a Commonwealth Country. So all seized goods then get sent over to England. You may want to check with Buckingham Palace for your confiscated goods!"
548162,IaCraig,2005-05-20 10:55:00,434,"What am I missing here? Why would anyone intentionally risk ruining a trip and reputation of others, as well as fines of hundreds of dollars to save a few dollars in duties? It is a vacation for crying out loud, budget for it. If it were me, I'd try to establish some ground rules with the group and what the consequences will be. Maybe you can divide into 2 cars, the smugglers in one and the non-smugglers in another. If you are the only one who views it as a bad thing, maybe you need to be looking for a new group to go with. My 2 cents IaCraig"
548169,Guest,2005-05-20 13:47:00,0,Just curious if anyone knows how late the Duty Free store is open and what price they get for a case of beer?? We usually take extra and pay duty but maybe it makes more sense to buy it there.
548234,meie0062,2005-05-22 19:36:00,28,"We had a guy about 5 years back try to sneak extra booze and smokes across. They found them *right* away in the boat (in the livewell), and then proceeded to strip the boat, truck, and topper down. Short of tearing out the floor in the boat - they had it completely apart. They dumped out the tackle trays right on the ground. After spending about 2 hours going through it all, they took everything they found, fined him about $200 and now his truck is blacklisted - he took it up the next two years and each time it was stripped down again. Finally back in 2003 it was old enough to trade in and he hasn't had trouble since. Just declare it or leave it at home...."
548237,MTWalleyeHunter,2005-05-22 20:17:00,61,Locked up for not declaring booze!?! That would be a first. However Customs Officers WILL make you life a living heck if they think you are trying to pull one past them. Like many have already said.....its just not worth it.
548260,bubba800,2005-05-23 19:35:00,559,"This topic belongs with the one trying to take a teen across after being busted for pot. I'm sorry but, Stupid is as Stupid does."
548380,Guest,2005-05-25 21:04:00,0,Being caught smuggling spirits into Canada will result in ALL alcohol products in the said vehicle being seized by Canada Border Services.After paying the fine you will be allowed to proceed.
548381,gus,2005-05-25 21:13:00,17,"thanks all, I think he got the message he is going to pay the duty"
548532,chaim52,2005-05-30 08:36:00,8,I wonder what the Canadian Customs do with all the seized booze????
548556,Guest,2005-05-31 00:24:00,0,they save it for their christmas party of course and thank the stupid americans that keep bringing it up.
548592,Guest,2005-05-31 12:13:00,0,"The guard said something about the Queens wherehouse,they were taking alot of stuff,2 flats of crawlers(maybe the bedding), rifles,booze,and 3 tanks of gas the last time we were there.What exactly is the Queens wherehouse?"
548101,gus,2005-05-19 08:08:00,17,that has to try and sneak extra booze with him. what will happen if he gets caught will they make him just pay the duty or will they send him packing back home. anyone had any experiance with this? would we all get turned back.
548102,wooglin,2005-05-19 08:20:00,371,"There is nothing illegal about bringing extra booze. Just don't lie about it. If they ask, tell them what you have, they'll decide whether or not you pay duty. We brought a ton of extra booze last year, had to pay big duty on it at the border. I suggest just buying your extra booze at the duty-free store just across the border. Not sure what happens if you lie about your quantity of booze and they catch you. I suggest you don't try though. It is, afterall, Customs and they can lock you up if they want."
548105,Guest,2005-05-19 08:32:00,0,"The words sneak and caught pretty much tell the story. I got away with sneaking some stuff across when I was young and stupid. The Customs officer came pretty close to opening my cooler with the ""excess"" I about soiled myself. The duty you/he would pay is nothin compared to the world of stuff that would happen if caught. They have always asked the driver what there is to declare so he should know exactly whats in his vehicle."
548111,Guest,2005-05-19 09:45:00,0,"Have both sneaked-in beer and been busted in younger days. Once 5 of us in a van with a luggage carrier had our allowed 5 cases inside the van and 10 more cases in the carrier on top. Got searched but they never opened the carrier above. Another time one of the guys ""forgot"" about the quart of Jack under the seat. They confiscated the quart and fined him about $40 US and sent us on our way, in to Canada, not back home. Those were the old days, years ago. These days, don't even bother. If you want to take extra, declare it and pay the duty. Its not that much compared with the grief if you get caught. Last time we paid duty it was about $8 CDN per case. The only reason we even take extra is if we get there after the beer stores close. Usually we just buy it on the Canada side and don't worry about it."
548114,Guest,2005-05-19 10:19:00,0,"A few years ago, a buddy of mine was driving his RV over the border with 7 friends who played poker all the way up. When they got stopped at the border, Dan was taking a nap in back. The guy that was driving said that they had only 8 cases of beer, and nothing else. They did not believe him and searched the vehicle. They found about 20 cases in the bedroom. They fined them for the extra beer, and they said that they were confiscating the vehicle. The RV never moved, and stayed parked at the side. They then had to pay a fine to get the car out of being confiscated. He said that it added up to about $500 total fines for everything. My friend was angry because he would have told the truth, but his buddy was the cheapy. Last year, I went up in a Navigator, and the guys in the other car stored their food in my car because we had the extra room. My friends had 10 pounds of spuds in their bin that I found when I got to the cabin. Not sure what they would have done to me if I had been caught with spuds."
548115,Guest,2005-05-19 10:40:00,0,"Two years ago we understated our cigar limit and alcohol allowance to the customs officer. For whatever reason, we were asked to turn over our driver's licenses and wait in the office while they did a background check. We had two vehicles, and once the background checks were complete and it turned up that one of our members had a valid pistol permit (but no pistol, of course) they requested a more thorough search of our contents. At this point they were still under the assumption that we were not over the limit on booze or tobacco. They pulled their portable x-ray unit up to our vehicles and requested that we remove all items and place each parcel, bag or box on the conveyer so that our contents could be scanned. We figured the jig was up and they'd pinch us for the two extra bottles of liquor and the 100, or so, extra cigars. They did not. I guess that their concern was more for weapons. No mention was ever made of the booze or cigars and we were on our way. In other years past we declared more than the allowed quantity of tobacco or booze and sometimes they'd charge us the extra duty and sometimes they'd let it slide. I guess paperwork is paperwork wherever you go and some folks would rather not have to deal with small potatoes."
548124,Guest,2005-05-19 13:20:00,0,"It isn't worth it. They make the best blended whiskies (Rye) in Canada, anyway. If he wants to bring some in, declare it and pay the tax. If he tries to hide it and they find it...it will make them mad and they can keep you at the border a long, long time while going through everything you have. It isn't worth it."
548130,orchard frank,2005-05-19 14:51:00,1900,"Buy what you need after you cross, why cause yourself problems? Last time I checked, they had plenty of whiskey in Canada, and some brands that may be new to you. Live it up, buy some good stuff. The crossing personnel are trained to spot nervous people, if it is worrying you already, you'd be toast."
548141,Guest,2005-05-19 20:51:00,0,"Got poped for undeclaired extra fuel. Had to pay the duty, name/license was recorded into the Canadian database and was given a warning. The warning was for 2 years and then would be cleared from the records. Was told that if I was caught with illegel/undeclared item that I could be banned from entering Canada. The minor amount of duty is worth every penny when you consider they can have every box, suitcase, boat compartment, trunk, and seat torn apart. The best part is YOU get to pay anyways and repack all that stuff back into the vehicles. Figure at the minimum 2+ hours dealing with all that. Is it really worth it????????"
548144,Guest,2005-05-20 02:26:00,0,"We took a pop-up camper one year,the guy who brought it uses it every other week,well we got searched and the border patrol was looking in it and found a half bottle of booze,my buddy just about passed out, the bottle was from 3 weeks earlier,the guard asked if that was all, and he said yes,the guard looks and finds another half bottle,my buddy explained that the bottles were from other trips that got stashed and were forgotten. The guard confiscated them.By the time it was all over we were all laughing including the guards.If you lie they will know it, if you tell the truth they will know it to. Thats what they are trained to do.Being honest and polite is is the best thing you can do."
