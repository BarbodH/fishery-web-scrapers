548887,phishfearme,2005-06-06 17:26:00,1242,"kyle - i think they go by ""Canadian Flyin Fishing, Inc."" now. we've been to two of their lakes - springpole for 11 days and shearstone (before they got the shearstone LUP it was a portage-in lake with excellent adventures out of their brownstone lake outpost). in any event, they are the ""high priced spread"" and are not ashamed to admit it but they really deliver the service. they have a motel right at the base that enables you to fall out of bed and onto one of their otter aircraft. their cabins are very well maintained and the lakes - especially the northern lake like blackbirch - get nothing but rave reviews. i would highly recommend them. ask bruce or deb or john or rena for references for blackbirch and also do a search on this site. the old saying that you get what you pay for applies to these guys. good luck, Phish"
