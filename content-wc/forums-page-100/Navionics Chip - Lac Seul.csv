6405090,Carnhzkr,2020-03-08 14:44:00,964,You're right. I lost my patience. I apologize.
6405394,CamoHunter,2020-03-09 08:17:00,363,"Lodo, Not sure what your problem was with mine or Carnhzkr's post?Myself, Pooch, Lmbkiller, Carnhzkr, and many others, have all posted about our actual true experience with maps of all brands on Lac Seul, many times over. And that's exactly what we did again in this thread. I've spent the money, and provided feedback so that: 1.) people know what they're getting when they spend the money, 2.) people know not to trust the depth contours there, 3.) can decide for themselves whether they want to purchase it just for the shoreline map or not. You posted about 'something you heard from a guy', about a completely different lake, and thought it 'might' be good for Lac Seul too. That's no help for anyone. Yet, you ripped on us for our comments? Should I not even post next time, and care less is someone tears up their boat because they trusted a completely inaccurate depth map?Trust me, we'd love a great contour map of Lac Seul as bad as anyone else. The fact is, there isn't one, we've probably looked harder than anyone else. I've fished on Lac Seul more than 20 trips, and mapped a ton of fishing areas there for my own use, and could provide dozens of examples where the available maps don't even come close. And as we've stated many times, as well as earlier in this thread, it's basically only good for recognizing where you are on the lake, and seeing where your own boating trails show up in proximity to landmarks. Dozens of other users have posted the exact same feedback.I've also provided links to other social map sources such as Humminbird LiveShare and C-Map Genesis Social Map, which at least provide some depth data that has been shared by others on different parts of the lake."
6405412,prov1800,2020-03-09 08:54:00,5010,One day i suppose they will upgrade the chip.whether they do or dont doesnt matter to me.Ive lived in the Vermilion Bay since 1980 and have fished about every lake that shows on the map even the lakes we had to cut trails into. Those were fun days and no chips or gps.We were always very proud when we found fish.Fishing lakes like Lac Suel and Eagle was a real challenge back then and actually enjoyed that.Fishing has improved as far as numbers of fish so fishing now is so much easier since them days but we had good and bad days.Now that i have all the tech stuff i still fish areas and spots as i did years ago.I go out with my guests sometimes in there private boats and and run all the lakes without a gps i just point where they should go and they are getting a safe route as we go.Sometimes ill get them to stop and ill take them to a sometimes hittable rock depending on water levels.They all kinda go whoa.ive been in boats with all kinds of units none of them have showed those kinda dangers.As a example of how impatient some people are.one day i was going to Broad Lake in a Onaway Lodge boat.Had some guys in a big *** ranger catch up to us and he wanted to pass me in the worst way.For you guys that have made the trip you know theres a bad rock half way up by a tree sticking up.you need to go to the right and slow down and go around it.well this guy figured it was his chance to pass me.Bad move.That was it for that engine.Need to have patience everywhere until you gave checked it out slowly.Sometimes its a matter of a couple of ft left or right.
6405426,Carnhzkr,2020-03-09 09:15:00,964,"Sorry, guys. Let's reel it in a bit. I don't think anybody was necessarily ripping anybody. That's the problem with words on a screen, it's easy to read more than what's there. I take responsibility for getting off track when my reply Lodo. I apologized, let's move on."
6405728,Skis,2020-03-09 17:56:00,1523,Thank you for the input!! I think that I am going to purchase the chip. Can't wait to be back up there!! We had a blast 2 years ago!!
6405760,Carnhzkr,2020-03-09 18:43:00,964,"I would highly recommend that anyone fishing LS, or any other lake in Canada for that mater, purchase the Navionics Canada chip. It's great for what it is, but just don't assume that it's totally accurate or you might find one of the many unmarked hazards that have been mentioned. Before I had the chip, I used to run straight through Ghost Narrows, but looking on the Navionics map, you can easily see that the main channel actually cuts west and through two islands. If you didn't have the map, you would think the main channel goes straight. I had been getting lucky in that area, but I'm smarter now, thanks to the Navionics Canada map.I bought mine here off the Swap Board for $50 or $60. It's an older version, but the LS map hasn't changed. The newer versions have added a few more lakes."
6405796,Aspencreek,2020-03-09 22:04:00,2911,"When you discovered the errors of your ways, did you get a little tingle. My first trip in the area we didn't have a GPs or even a good map, but we did have a great indian guide. We fished the area of Ghost narrows and he told us where the main channel ran. Where you went is full of old stumps and boulders, great Northern fishing tho. Getting a chip leaves lots of fellows with a false sense of security on LS. I have brought back to camp 4 boats so far that were either lost or had a damaged lower unit due to just going where they shouldn't have. The chip is great for travel routes, but if you get off those routes you have to be carefull. Particularly if you travel north along the island before passing thru Ghost. There are some boulders the size of buicks and in normal water years they are just under the surface, and they come up out of 30' of water. The land mines and reefs are everywhere, saddles between islands look like a safe passage but do it only after making sure it is deep enough, most are not. Reminding guys that LS is not a bowl is paramount, but that is also why the fishing is tremendous."
6405924,CamoHunter,2020-03-10 08:08:00,363,"Part of why I love it there is that it isn't mapped, and a person can still discover new spots on their own. Also part of why I love it there, is that I have discovered lots of good spots, and I have them mapped really well from time spent fishing on them and saving the sonar recordigns. I go back and forth. It's always fun discovering a new hump, flat, or dropoff that I didn't know was there, and fishing a new area. I've saved my sonar recordings for 10+ years now, and just by spending time fishing new areas we've created some extremely useful maps for the areas we fish."
6405994,valley366,2020-03-10 10:14:00,193,Having played with Lowrance community forum charts (CMAP Gennesis) for a while and now buying a Humminbird Helix I am amazed at how much more data is on the Bird community page compared to Lowrance for Lac Seul. Looks like some people really spent some time there making maps.
6406520,CMesserschmidt,2020-03-11 10:52:00,1006,"Lac Suel is such a massive lake that's far enough up that its hard for any manufacture to get updated maps for.As for as maps to use, any of them work and I have used them all. I prefer Navionics for a few reasons.For a navigation aspect its actually pretty decent for navigating the lake. You still need to take caution though as with any other manufactures chip.The other reason is this......Navionics and other manufactures are crowd sourced for map updates. Meaning it most likely won't get updated unless we the people run SonarCharts Live, or Genesis Live or AutoChart Live, etc.. I have run all over that lake and my SonarCharts live (which I keep open to the public NOT private)is going non stop the entire time I fish for the week. Now I fish the same spots so its hard for the lake to get updated from just me. If others would take advantage of it even if they keep it private, your maps will be that much better in the future. But on the other hand I do get why people like to keep stuff private. They have certain areas or spots that are secret that they don't want to share with the world.So in my opinion its a catch 22.....People want more and better mapping, but don't want to give up there spots."
6406610,prov1800,2020-03-11 13:27:00,5010,Who can blame them.thats what fishing is about.
6406678,1100 Remington Man,2020-03-11 16:20:00,73,Odds are the fish might be there and might not. As they move around a lot. I seriously doubt if the Lac Seul will ever be pressured because of its location.
6406738,Lmbkiller,2020-03-11 18:42:00,639,Lac seul receives PLENTY of pressure
6406802,Andre (wallyandre),2020-03-11 21:05:00,2274,I always run with my Lowrance link to my IPad logging map; when I'm on spot that I want to keep private I just uncheck SonarChart live on my IPad. That way I can improve the map and keep my spot.

Behind an island, out of the wind, check out that shoreline/weedbed, explore that open area between 2 islands where you never see anyone go, head on up that stream coming in just to see where it goes and what it does. I have found spots that I have never seen anyone else on, found spots where I know the guys flying by are going ???? My biggest walleye was caught in an area that 90% of the guys on this site who actually fish LS, have and never will even try. I go there to get away from the wind and the crowd, and have a ball. Even the Camp owner thinks I'm a little nuts, but the proof is in the results"
6402140,Skis,2020-03-02 16:32:00,1523,"Would like some user input/replies regarding the Navionics Chip for Lac Seul? Making our second trip to Lac Seul 7/31 - 8/6/20. Staying at Lac Seul Wilderness Resort south of Ear Falls (NW Corner) My readings on the chip is that it doesn't show a lot of contours, but does offer a navigation through the entire lake. However, since I've already been there, I marked the tight areas with rocks while navigating to the Big Island, etc. I run a Lowrance HDS 12 on the dash for navigating purposes. Does the chip show some of the contours and/or some of the reef areas? Any input would be greatly appreciated before I spend a good bit of money on something I may not need or be disappointed in. Thanks!!!"
6402150,Lmbkiller,2020-03-02 17:22:00,639,"Short answer not really, not well, not all of them, but some are. That being said I would still buy it, just another decent resource to have to stay safe and know where u are"
6402166,Pooch,2020-03-02 18:05:00,4618,"^^ Agree The chip shows land and islands pretty accurately. Depths are some times close and other times just down right dangerously wrong. Accurate contours? Not really. Some islands are shown as shoals and some shoals are shown as islands on the chip. At least you are aware that ""something"" is there to be cautious when anywhere near. I would not navigate the lake without this chip, but unless you are absolutely, positively, 100% sure and very confidently familiar with an area or a track, don't rely on it at speed. I have many, many hazards marked as waypoints (red X) in what the map indicates as deep or ""should be safe"" water. When traveling my eyes are on the depth finder and looking ahead every moment. LS fluctuates a lot during the open water season. A few years ago when the water was very high, old shoreline timber was re-floating all over the lake and hitting logs just under the surface kept the driver and front passenger on full alert. Great lake, it just needs to be respected.https://webapp.navionics.com/#boatin...y=ma%7BqHtvxrP Pooch"
6402200,prov1800,2020-03-02 20:00:00,5010,Its the same old map thaþ ive had for around 12 years.it does the trick but like whats been said you have to be carefull.i ive run to lake for 30 years mostly without anyrhing in old days and found hidden nuggets that way.lol.basically its fairly safe as far as iam concered.it does have the safe houseboat routes on it.you could run that lin all the way to siouxlookout and i have.if you go off that line just be carefull.i have my own routes now to take shortcuts but wouldnt recommend doing that at a high speed.i boufht a hook 7 for portable trips and it has a new chip in it but nothing much different except a few new lakes.its a safe trip from eafalls to mckenzie bay.mostly marked.but fishing wise where your comng from has excellent fishing.
6403466,CamoHunter,2020-03-05 08:24:00,363,"I'd echo the comments of lmbkilller. The navionics chip leaves a lot to be desired for Lac Seul. In my opinion, the one and only thing that it is useful for, is for knowing where you are on the lake, and seeing where your boat tracks/waypoints lie in proximity to islands and marked hazards. This being your second trip there, you should be well aware of all those granite hazards near or just under the water surface. The navionics chip has quite a few of those hazards marked with the red square/plus symbol. But don't count on them all being marked. Probably the best option for Lac Seul right now, is a Humminbird unit with the social AutoChart Liveshare map downloaded. There's been several people contribute to the Liveshare site for that area and a halfway decent map is starting to develop on the west end of the Lac Seul. Pair that with AutoChart Live mapping on the water, and you can have a pretty good headstart on a fishing trip."
6403482,jb_wi,2020-03-05 08:37:00,212,"I was on Lac Seul for the first time last year and used the Navionics chip. As others have said, it works good because it has the navigation routes, but the contours are hit and miss. My best luck was had by using the autochart feature on the Humminbird. I would explore new areas carefully (deeper water) and watch for any reefs. When I found an unmarked reef, I would then autochart the reef, then hone in my position with that data. We were there in July so the walleyes were on those deeper reefs, and the autochart helped immensely. The Navionics will give you general contours here and there, but mainly used it for navigation. We found more reefs unmarked than marked when using the Navionics. When not traveling on the navigation route, we were very careful, as there are a LOT of unmarked reefs and rocks out there."
6404598,LoDo,2020-03-07 18:17:00,721,I was told by the marine in Red Lake the Hummingbird Helix 5 w/ chip is pretty solid for Red Lake. Perhaps for Lac Seul too.
6404620,Carnhzkr,2020-03-07 20:27:00,964,"Oh, then by all means you should buy the Navionics chip and go WOT where ever it shows you're in 20 of water. Look, this topic comes up every 3 days and each time the same people give the same opinion. It's better than nothing, but don't just go blindly or you'll eventually find out where it's inaccurate. It's the Navonics chip. Humminbird Helix 5 has nothing to do with it. You buy the Navionics Canada chip and pop it into whichever sonar unit you have. It's exactly the same map as you can see if you go to here:https://webapp.navionics.com/#boatin...key=mqyrHvcvuP It shows the lake in 10 foot contours so there is a lot of room for error. The map is not based on a detailed depth survey. I can personally attest that there are hazards in areas where the map shows it is clear."
6404972,tandm,2020-03-08 09:31:00,679,"I have fished the same areas of Lac Seul and LOW for 10+ years. Finding and marking new structure every year. Navionics is the best option, but, unless a track is marked, keep your eyes on the depth and your hand on the throttle.Update your own card by marking structure and saving routes."
