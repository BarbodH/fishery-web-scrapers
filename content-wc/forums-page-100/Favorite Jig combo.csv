6386900,The tank,2020-01-16 18:43:00,340,Glow blue jig with glow white tail have caught me more big eyes than any other. For numbers I like pink jig with pink and white hoochie koochie tail.
6386926,tandm,2020-01-16 21:19:00,679,1/4 oz. unpainted jighead with yellow twister tail
6386928,Live to jig,2020-01-16 21:27:00,159,Sometimes a unpainted jig and a crawler threaded on just right!
6386964,The tank,2020-01-17 04:07:00,340,I forgot to put 3/8 mostly sometimes 1/4. Dont use 1/8 much any more.
6387028,prov1800,2020-01-17 08:36:00,5010,I have every jig color you can imagine as i have a buddy that makes jigs and i can order up to 3 combo colors.they do look pretty in my tackle box.1/8 -1/4 oz is about ill ever use.They will all catch fish but some seem to catch more on diff lakes depending on water quality.Clear lakes a black jig seems best and on stained a chartruse/orange seems to do the trick.Lately ive been ice fishing in fairly clear water and have had a pink/white on in a 1/8 oz and its been doing great.so why change.
6401018,1100 Remington Man,2020-02-28 17:41:00,73,"Every year is different pink/white, orange/chartreuse, Chartreuse/chartreuse, Black or Blue all in 1/8 1/4 and 3/8. Now for one 3/8oz two tone jig head in Chartreuse Green/ no plastic just minnow."
6401042,tandm,2020-02-28 18:24:00,679,"I start with a plain 1/4 oz. jig and either a minnow or a nightcrawler. From there, black or chartreuse depending on water clarity or stain."
6401088,DaBirdman,2020-02-28 21:21:00,164,"For size, I prefer 1/8oz 75% of the time when shallow and/or on calm days. 20% of the time I use 1/4oz when going deep or on windy days to maintain contact with the jig. 5% of the time I'll use 3/8 when fishing aggressively using plastics. As for color, my go-to is a black/orange combo. But I change it up a lot such as an all white, or all pink, or a chartreuse. Not all fish in any school prefer the same color or size. I have a plethora of jig sizes, colors, shapes and brands. They're all in play on any given day."
