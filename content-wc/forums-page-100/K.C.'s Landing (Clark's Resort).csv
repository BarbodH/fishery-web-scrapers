I know the general rules of boating up there, but I'm more wondering if any of those neck downs and channels between the lakes can be extra treacherous for someone in their own boat. Looks like there are plenty of options for multispecies action and a variety of structure and possible techniques? Thanks guys!"
6401410,prov1800,2020-02-29 17:07:00,5010,"Iam out there quite often.As matter of fact was out ice fishing.As far as summer/fall goes fishing is pretty good of course you do need to some experience on it.Walleye fishing is very good but walleyes tend to bite very early and then again towards evening.So other types of fishing such as smallmouth/muskie and lake trout are available throughout the day As far as travelling the lake it is very safe even in the narrows..Id say first trio through slow down and get famikiar with it as the second narrows is full of stumps.Kc,s landing is a greàt camp to stay at.Really good docks to tie your boats to.Feel free to msg me for any infornation."
6402812,Yooper61,2020-03-04 14:05:00,80,Going for the first time myself mid August. Using camp boats and staying next to KC's Landing. They have a house rental in a bay next to KC's (Birch Bay I think). Looks great. Like the free bait. Is GPS needed? Their boats have depth finders but not GPS. Wondering if I should get a portable unit for navigation. Fished Eagle lake several times and GPS was needed to get back to camp. Thanks in advance
6402822,prov1800,2020-03-04 14:20:00,5010,You wont need one leave camp and 2 ways to go straight to indian lake or hand a right and that will take you to cobble and boulder.all good going.do it once and youll be a pro.
6402824,prov1800,2020-03-04 14:24:00,5010,You will love that cabin and being by yourselves.youll need the bait but fish early like 5 am then cast or do something through mid day and go out after supper þoward sunset.very close to camp bring lots more minnows.lol.
6403500,Yooper61,2020-03-05 09:00:00,80,"Thanks for the insight. This will be the first time that I will be targeting Musky's specifically. Definitely looking for walleye/smallmouth in am and pm but hope to spend some time going after ski's. Fishing for 40 years, but a newbie with Musky's. **** baits are expensive! The rental house became available and I can't believe how nice it is. The owners daughter and her husband(pilot) live there during the winter but summers being so busy, they rent out their house. It is very close to K.C.'s Landing so we just need to boat over to pick up minnows. There boats look great so our group is leaving personal craft at home. I might try to borrow a portable GPS unit, if not for navigation, maybe to mark humps, etc. Thanks again"

I watched both parts of it this a.m., and it is a good view. Never watched 'Outdoor Junkies,' but it is a good show. Looks like John is guiding on these episodes!"

6403530,prov1800,2020-03-05 09:35:00,5010,Sounds good.
6403560,prov1800,2020-03-05 11:28:00,5010,might be a good idea or a handheld.they have sonar units on there boats.but i always bring my own portable.
