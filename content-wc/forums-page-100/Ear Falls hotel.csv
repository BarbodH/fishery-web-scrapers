6406680,JAY221,2020-03-11 16:23:00,877,"or a Starbucks or McDonalds or a Burger King. Just don't exist. But a lot of good people. Later, Jay"
6406748,Spurgery,2020-03-11 18:56:00,79,I got a room reserved at the Trillium. Now for the wait. Two trips this year. One with my dad in late May and one in August with buddies. Knotty pines lodge and nungesser lake lodge.
6405972,Spurgery,2020-03-10 09:41:00,79,"Anybody have lodging suggestions for one night stay in late May? Could stay in Dryden but would rather stay near Ear Falls since we depart from there in the morning. Don't need fancy, just clean and basic will do. Thanks!"
6405976,Golden Eagle,2020-03-10 09:45:00,2642,It's more than adequate. Reserve yesterday as today may be too late.
6405980,Spurgery,2020-03-10 09:56:00,79,What place are you referring to? Thanks.

6406076,Mojo-NC,2020-03-10 11:37:00,1929,I chuckled to myself when I read the title of your post. I didn't even know that there was a motel in Ear Falls. We can't check-in to our cabin until 9:00 am on our Saturday of arrival so we drive the last 1:45 from Dryden or Kenora the morning of our check-in. We stay in Dryden when coming from International Falls or Kenora when we fly into Winnipeg.
6406294,neldog257,2020-03-10 18:41:00,16,I have also stayed at the Trillion Motel a few nights. Nothing fancy but clean. It also has a nice caf√© connected to the motel that serves a great breakfast.

6406426,the_bronco,2020-03-11 07:28:00,86,"Trillium Motel, Phone: +1 807-222-3126, with a very good cafe attached, also nice bait shop just across the highway, ""Four Seasons"" where we get our bait after reserving ahead of time. We also get our licenses here along with some other stuff we don't need . I would call sooner then later though, not very big motel."
6406588,pnnylfr,2020-03-11 12:53:00,114,"Flew with Showalters last year and 10 of us stayed right across the road at at a small resort. Cabins were dated but clean and comfortable. Full kitchen, toilet, and shower. Basic, cheap, and had a good night stay. Will try to find contact info."
6406636,JAY221,2020-03-11 14:38:00,877,"Another vote for Tillium. Stayed there last year and have reservations for this year already. Have ate there in years past but stayed for the first time last year. It is actually a lot bigger than I thought. Later, Jay"
