6405948,valley366,2020-03-10 09:16:00,193,I often recommend the Sunset Country website to people looking for resorts. I have found their search engine to be good and shows on a map where things are located.https://visitsunsetcountry.com/
6406404,johnboat,2020-03-11 05:19:00,2014,You'd love Mylies Place. Just 1/2 hour across. Nice little beack at the camp and several others on the water. And great fishing close.
6402968,Bergy,2020-03-04 19:56:00,83,Trying to plan a trip for June and only have 4-5 days this year. Would like to stay closer to the border since it will be a shorter trip. Mainly fish for Walleye. We would bring our own boat and cook our own meals. Looking for a cabin. Have looked at some places on LOTW and Rainy. Would like a camp with nicer cabins since my wife will be going. Also want the option of decent fishing without having a 30 minute boat ride. Thanks for the suggestions.

6403876,The tank,2020-03-06 05:41:00,340,June maybe hard to get in this late. Buena Vista resort with a nice restaurant. (Morson). Labellas birchwood camp on rainy. Mylies place (Morson) I would recommend Obabikon also but I think Jarods all American plan and you said cook your own food. Grassy narrows good area to fish. (Milebay) out of Morson. Rex Toltons milesbay camp is where we stay. Cabin 1 has a in door toilet but you use a central show house but its roomy and nice.
6403910,Baseline,2020-03-06 06:44:00,3207,"Rainy Lake - Taylors Cove - Nice cabins, quiet resort and located dead center between Red Gut, Seine and Swell Bays. Lots of walleyes, pike, SMB and crappie available. No long runs to access fish unless you want to. June is prime time"

6405424,Bergy,2020-03-09 09:14:00,83,"Thanks for the replies. We want a drive to resort. Would cook our own meals. Any other activities (beach, kayaks, etc.) a bonus. Any other places on other lakes that others would recommend?"

6405602,prov1800,2020-03-09 14:52:00,5010,Be a hard landing right now.
6405792,Bergy,2020-03-09 21:02:00,83,"Clark's sounds nice, but we are planning a long weekend and don't want to add the distance. Other suggestions welcome. Thanks."
