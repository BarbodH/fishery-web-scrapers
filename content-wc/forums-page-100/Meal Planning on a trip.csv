We pack for weight and this is perfect plus good for ya. Walnuts, raisins, honey, cranberries etc make it great plus few dishes and we're out fishing. Also... no bread for us just soft shell tacos and such. Pack better and even work for brat nite. Bacon and eggs one day and save some bacon for a pot of bean souo on last day with soaked beans. Fish almost every day heck ya. Last thought, although we do take spuds and brown rice.. the dehydrated mashed are actually quite good and again save weight. Living like kings"
6399160,kona77,2020-02-24 12:05:00,236,"I have seen a few posts that have mentioned ""blackened Walleye"" that have my interest.. I have had blackened fish on a couple of occasions and I get the general premise to fry/cook the fish in a hot cast iron skillet.. Most recipes I see on line call to coat the fish in butter and then apply the seasoning and then cook a few minutes per side.. Have seen various home made seasoning recipe's and was wondering if any WC members would care to post their technique and seasonings used.. Thanks"
6399210,KSjim,2020-02-24 14:38:00,88,Highly recommend Chef Prudhomme Blackened Redfish Magic. We used to coat the fish in butter first but now generally apply the seasoning directly to the fish and fry a few minutes per side in a lightly oiled hot skillet.
6399378,prov1900,2020-02-25 00:55:00,544,"I also use the Chef Paul stuff. I've tried others and it doesn't stack up. I've seasoned the fish first, then coated with butter, and vice versa, but now we just season, heat the cast iron with butter, and before the butter turns dark, drop the fish in until they are crispy black then flip. All the ways taste the same, just a little quicker (less cleanup) with the last way."
6399530,kona77,2020-02-25 10:19:00,236,KSJIm and Prov1900- Thanks for the replies about the Chef Paul/blackened fish seasoning. I see it is available on Amazon and will order some for a taste test before our trip in June..
6399562,KSjim,2020-02-25 11:54:00,88,You can also get it at magicseasoningblends.com You can use it on any meat as well as fish. As good as it is on walleye it might be better on chicken. Blackened the chicken on both sides in a hot skillet in the oil of your choice and then finish in a 375 degree oven. Really good stuff.
6400192,gordy28,2020-02-27 07:03:00,437,This looks great - going to check it out and see if I can order into Canada or will try to pick up the next time we are across the border - we have some time before our August trip lol (176 days to be exact)
6401428,joeflip,2020-02-29 17:29:00,75,"One idea I picked up from WC a few years ago was freezing my eggs, for 6 guys, I freeze 60 eggs, 10 each in one quart freezer bags, the key is to only break the yokes and not over beat them prior to freezing, they also take the place of ice in the cooler, as they take forever to thaw, if you flush all the air out of the freezer bags and freeze them flat, they take up a quarter of the space as in the shell."
6401458,forgop,2020-02-29 18:35:00,880,"I like to bring in chili and items from the smoker like pulled pork and beef brisket to put in gallon size bags and freeze. Cook like sous vide over the stove and you've got the comfort of really good food with virtually zero preparation. The only thing I prepare from scratch at camp is walleye and fried potatoes. I expect if I had a food dehydrator, I'd even slice up my potatoes in advance and add water there, but until then, it's always fish and freshly cut taters. I'd never thought of the egg freezing suggestion above, but I like it."

6396034,kona77,2020-02-14 07:48:00,236,"Bstar, As far as the bacon wrapped walleye, or in my experience, wrapped shrimp, I've never had an issue of flare ups as long as I am using some 'meatier' bacon. Indirect heat, or placing them on the top rack helps prevent the big fires. Got to keep an eye on them, in fact, don't leave their side. Yes, you need to be diligent when making this meal..One of the tricks we have picked up is to start the bacon/fillet's directly on the grille and then transfer to a cookie sheet about half way thru to cooking process to control flare-up's..I did make the mistake of bringing up thinner/shorter toothpicks the first year and it made skewing the bacon/walleye fillets a chore. I saw some comments about freezing meals ahead of time and using these meals as ""ice-packs"" on the trip up.. That is another good suggestion we have been using for years. Can get 15-18 scrambled eggs in a quart freezer bag and I will also do this with our spag/meatball meal in a gallon bag.Cut the meatballs in half before freezing and lay the bags flat in your freezer.. Makes for handy ice packs and just thaw and cook at the outpost."

6397306,gordy28,2020-02-18 07:31:00,437,Thanks for sharing - that sounds great and would be a nice switch up! I will be honest - I can't really handle more than 1 (2 max) sessions of fried fish - just seems to disagree w me. Last trip we did more pan fried and grilled and I (and my stomach) loved it This is going on the menu!
6397324,kona77,2020-02-18 08:24:00,236,Thought I would try the fish creole suggestion and I substituted some crappies left from last season. Turned out great and I served over some long grain rice..Easy to make and it would be even better with some fresh Canadian walleye chunks in the creole.. Another good fish option for our trips.
6397628,prov1900,2020-02-19 02:56:00,544,"Agree with the fried fish. Love it, but it gets to be taxing on the (now 50+) digestive system. A big hit for our group is blackened walleye. It is spicy, but it is still fairly light fare. It is on the menu twice during the week. These threads are my favorite year after year on W/C. Good food and fresh ideas drives our trips!"

6395136,TUNASUB,2020-02-11 13:35:00,88,"Outside of bringing 10 lbs of steak jerky, candy bars and snacks for late night. I'll let the resort do the cooking. The resort in Canada we frequent serves food until 10 and we can order ahead and re-heat if fishing late. The resort bar/diner is open until 1am or later if busy. They open early for breakfast sammies and coffee, about 6am I believe. By 7am full menu and the bar is open. By then I'm way into my first or second drift. If at a stand alone cabin, then it's a standard grocery store run that includes just about everything for meals, and snacks. Then frequent quick mart runs for whatever the kids gotstahaves. I always have to have cookies around. I hide them in the boat with the candy. Jerky in the boat for sure. Some great ideas on new things to try out here.."
6395196,brett13,2020-02-11 16:48:00,51,"Breakfast is on the run. Bagels, Granola bars, banana's etc. Lunch is our big meal of the day. Surf and Turf, burgers, brats, fish, more fish, roasted potatoes, etc. Supper is easy b/c we normailly fish until 8:30ish. Sandwiches, frozen pizza, left overs. Hope ya'll have a great year this year. Tight lines!"
6395344,Esoxfeign1313,2020-02-12 06:43:00,79,"I’m going on my 3rd fly-in this June. We try to keep it simple for obvious reasons. For one, we don’t really eat breakfast. Lunch consists of cold cuts and quick stuff like that. Dinner, however, is when we cook legit meals, such as burgers, venison, fried walleye, etc. No doubt being at any camp calls for good food, but between weight/space restrictions and wanting to fish as much as possible, we keep it simple."
6395374,gordy28,2020-02-12 07:47:00,437,Some great responses I dont think we have tried BBQ sauce on the bacon wrapped walleye but will give it a whirl this year on Miniss In general we are in the keep it simple and hardy group - one thing we really liked on our last trip was bringing a bunch of little candy bars - like the kind you get a walmart for a $1. They were a hit at lunch time as a nice pick me up Cheers and thanks for all of the replies Andrew
6395410,hoppy63,2020-02-12 09:50:00,367,"I agree on the great responses. Our group is older and some in the group have had 30+ trips so we do not rush to get out first thing in the morning. Sometimes its 9:30 before we hit the water. For us it's just as much about the relaxation and experience/scenery as it is the fishing. That said I do like the bacon wrapped walleye idea and the dried hash browns are an awesome idea if they are as good as advertised. One question I do have on outfitter flying beer or oil and beans, etc. in ahead of time.....I bring my own beer usually and pay the duty and then buy a case or two of Kokanee (we pronounce COCAINee because one just makes me want another) because it is still cheaper. Does the outfitter not charge you to fly it in ahead of time, and is it cost effective as compared to bringing you own? For the most part I'm the only beer drinker in our group so I'll generally take 4 cases for me then the rest of the group may have 3 cases between them so we may have a total of 7-8 cases."
6395470,Mojo-NC,2020-02-12 12:36:00,1929,"Our outfitter did not charge us for anything that he delivered prior to our arrival because he was on a routine mid-week check on the previous group (except for the actual cost of course). We had 12 cases of beer (4 Canadian, 4 Blue, and 4 Kokanee) and 10 gallons of water delivered. We were there for 9 days and popped the last beer open at 11:00 pm on our final evening. How's that for planning? I'm kind of ashamed to admit that we had some bacon left over at the end of the week. Inexcusable, it won't happen again!"
6395538,troutwater,2020-02-12 15:21:00,299,"Great topic! Last year I pre-made and froze some pulled pork that turned out great, but one of my favorites is wrapping filets in tin foil and grilling it. This is super easy, fast, and delicious. I just take the filet and put it on a piece of tin foil, add dashes of garlic powder, garlic salt, lemon pepper, and black pepper. Throw in some strips of onion, bell pepper, and then some butter. Wrap it up and throw on the grill....after 10-15 minutes it's all done and flakey. This is my favorite when I dont want to go through the hassle of frying fish."
6395910,Rich D,2020-02-13 18:18:00,75,"We always make a ham and macaroni salad at home and take that up for the first night's dinner, it also serves to make sandwiches or fried up for breakfast throughout the week. We also make and freeze a giant pan of lasagna. It serves as an ice pack for one of the coolers on the drive up and is a quick reheat on the 2nd night. We'll grill burgers and dogs one night, chicken one night, we plan on fish 2 nights, and a meal at the lodge on the last night. I also plan on a case of water per person per week, we alternate between eggs and cereal for breakfasts and everyone brings their own snacks and other beverages. A quick stop in the closest town to pick up fresh fruit, lettuce/salad stuff, bread, milk and other fresh foods and we are good."
6395914,AsianAngler,2020-02-13 18:23:00,67,"Some great ideas, I will have to look for the dehydrated potatoes. We only fly-in occasionally so weight is generally not a factor and this past year we bought a place on LOW, so cooking is not so difficult as I can stock my own kitchen. Anybody like teriyaki out there? One of the simplest marinades to make. Don't buy that bottled stuff. This recipe is for about 1 whole chicken cut up. For the best flavor cut into very small pieces, e.g., a drumstick would be cut in half. It is a lot of work to cut up that small, so if you are not into it, buy boneless chicken and cut into smaller pieces. This recipe is very good with salmon and beef too. 1 cup of soy sauce 1 cup of sugar 1 or 2 cloves of garlic peeled and flattened 1/4 tsp ginger 1/2 tsp of dried mustard Stir to dissolve the sugar as much as possible. Marinade the meat at least one hour or overnight (turning once or twice). If you choose a shorter time, consider massaging the marinade into the meat. For oven, 400 degrees for 45-55 mins depending on size of pieces. You do not need to discard the marinade if you bake in the oven. Turn pieces once during cooking. Absolute best is cooking on the grill, sugar burns a bit so watch that, but the crispy, sweet, smoky taste is terrific. I serve it with plain, white rice. Next morning, dice some bacon, fry til crisp. Throw in leftover, cold rice and enough scrambled eggs to barely cover the slightly broken up rice. Cook until eggs are done. Don't stir too much or the rice will get mushy. I like to serve this with a bit of ketchup. Enjoy! Oh, only thing I ever took on a fly-in that I regretted was powdered eggs... Yuck! Even the gulls wouldn't eat them!"
6394538,prov1900,2020-02-09 23:01:00,544,"Thanks for the bacon wrapped walleye idea! We usually do jumbo shrimp, adorned with bacon, but that walleye looks fantastic!"

We then hit the water and it is up to each boat if they want to come back to the cabin for any mid-day snacks, sandwiches etc.. We are always on a 7-day trip so we have 6 evening meals..One is steak night with egg noodles/gravy (save weight on tators). The other is spag/meatballs with garlic bread sprinkled with cheese.. As others have shared fish taco's are a great meal and we started having the bacon wrapped/walleye's the last two years.. I would highly recommend folks try them, they are as good as scallops in bacon!!! Will look at the dehydrated tators.."

6394770,Matcaz,2020-02-10 13:56:00,22,"Last few trips have been family trips (Wife and four kids w/Grandma and Grandpa). Until the couple trips with me they are all Canadian fishing camp novices. I want to make the trip as relaxing and enjoyable for the family as possible so they all want to keep coming back so that means meal planning and most prep is left for me. We usually keep breakfast pretty simple w/cereal, oatmeal, granola bars etc, but I do like to have one or two large hot breakfasts. I usually go w/browned sausage crumbles then add eggs to make a large pot of scrambles eggs w/sausage. The warm/toast some tortillas for breakfast burritos w/salsa, cheese etc for each to add to their liking. For our family situation, it usually works out best to come back to camp for lunch. But like breakfast, at least twice in our week I want them all to experience a true shore lunch. I start by frying cut up bacon in my cast iron skillet. Once the bacon is cooked I add onions, green peppers (already cut up at the cabin) and canned cooked and sliced potatoes. Because the canned potatoes are already cooked I simply have to warm them up. While fixing the taters I have a can of beans and corn warming in the side. I drain half the juice from the corn out and add half a stick of butter, season salts and pepper. When the taters are finished I wrap in foil to keep warm. Then I start frying the fish. Nothing fancy here and I vary the batter for variety. Sometimes dry batter, other times a box of shore lunch mixed w/beer w/extra seasonings added. Pretty easy and everyone seems to enjoy. Dinner at the cabin depends on lunch that day. If we had a fish shore lunch I will grill burgers, brats or steak. If we ate at the cabin and didn't have fish I like to wrap walleye fillets in foil w/butter and lemon pepper and bake them on the grill. Super easy and is done in less than 15 minutes."
6394848,Bstar,2020-02-10 17:49:00,564,"Ok, I like the idea of bacon wrapped walleye but how do you keep the grill from becoming a complete flaming inferno from the bacon grease? Over the years I've gone to a much simpler but good menu. Breakfasts are simple, cereal or oatmeal with a few pancakes and sausage, bacon and eggs, biscuits and gravy thrown in. I've also started pre-cooking and freezing the bacon. I put it on a rack over a baking sheet and bake at 400° for 10 minutes on each side. Put it in a zip lock bag freeze it and just warm it up in a frying pan at camp. Lot less mess and time and just as good. It's a breakfast staple. Our main meal is like a late lunch. We fish until 2-3 PM go back to camp, have a few barley pops and maybe a shot or two of Fireball or whatever bourbon is available, eat and go back out for the evening bite. Our main meals are beef sandwiches on the first day- very easy and filling after a long day. We have fish three days with one of them being fish tacos. One day we have pierogis and grilled sausage. Grilled steaks, baked potatoes and salad round out the week. The last day is leftovers and try to clean out the fridge. Nobody starves and as long as the fish are biting and we bring enough liquor then everyone is happy!"

We found them at Costco and decided to give them a try. All you do is add some hot water and let sit for 12 minutes, then pour into the frying pan with some cooking oil and butter. These potatoes make awesome hashbrowns. We were surprised how good they were and they don't cost much or weigh anything when packing for a fly-in trip. They are now a staple for our Canada trips and I make them at home now too. Give them a try. An example below:https://www.amazon.com/Idaho-Spuds-P...s%2C162&sr=8-1"

I have definitely evolved over the years, having learned that is not necessary to plan three meals per day. On a 6-night outpost trip, I plan for 4 breakfasts, 2 shore lunches, and 6 dinners:Breakfasts:Fishing camp breakfast (see previous post) x 2Blueberry pancakes with bacon or sausage x 2Dinners:Fish fry: I like to use the following for walleye: Mike Borger's panko recipe, beer battered walleye, a blend of corn flake crumbs and seasoned flour, and the old standby, shore lunch cajun breading; french fried potatoes, grillin' beans, and corn.**I have used everything from lard to Crisco to butter-flavored Crisco to peanut oil to fry fish, and it's all good--whatever is left over from the year before usually gets packed first. If I am going to pan fry fish, I like to use smaller fillets, dip them in milk, dredge them in corn meal, and fry in margarine. It is crisp and delicious!Ribeyes, baked potatoes, caesar saladGrilled brats, fresh made potato saladGrilled salamini, blackened walleyeGrilled boneless chicken breasts (marinade first), caesar saladUtilizing the grill makes meal prep. very quick and easy. Also, and leftovers from the grill are great for a snack the next day.We always have the outfitter fly in our beer, pop, and water in advance. Some outfitters will fly in Crisco and beans, too. The extra cost is well worth it, once the bags go on the scales prior to flying out."

We get up, make coffee with Starbucks Via packets or another similar instant coffee, head out and fish and come back to camp around 9:30 or 10:00 am. We cook and eat a large breakfast, then fish again until dinner. They we play cards and enjoy some liquid refreshments until it's time to cash in for the night. Get up the next morning and repeat. We also discovered that leftover fish filets baked on buttered bread or buns with cheese melted over them make for a pretty good breakfast sandwiches too."

The only issue I had was at breakfast one day we were all told we can have 2-1/4 pcs of bacon only. Of all the things to ration bacon should never be on that list. I had to chuckle -what next you can only have 1-1/2 eggs.
