6392954,ek2008,2020-02-04 12:22:00,7,HI Folks - Looking for camping information for this lake. Four of us will be looking to camp here for a week to try something different. We don't want to stay at a resort like Pasha and prefer a campsite on the lake. We have done Onaman lake 2 years now and don't want to hike in all our gear to the cached boats. Anyone need advice for this lake please holler I am happy to help. thanks in advance! EK...

The camping I've seen there was in the access to the creek that flows into the lake. There is a turn around ""parking"" spot that had several spots hacked out in the bush that people camped in, presumably around the opener. I fished there end of June beginning of July most years, didn't see anyone there, just the leftover mess. I can only warn you that out of the wind and in June, that spot will be a challenge. Checking the lake for camping sites could be done, in my time on that lake no one was camping there. I can only imagine that the creek outlet to the lake being both full of submerged trees and shallow poses a problem. It would be spectacular though if you decide to go ahead.Rgds"

6403804,hiwayman,2020-03-05 21:09:00,201,I've also fished North wind a few times. Can you just camp anywhere on crown land? my understanding of the laws are that it has to be a designated campsite? Maybe some of our north of the border friends can clarify this?
6404026,DBH,2020-03-06 10:34:00,89,"I did a little research to validate the designated campsites and didn't see that requirement. There were cautions about ""red zone"" areas that were not available for camping, and the requirement for non-residents to have a permit ($ 10/day 21 day max) in Ontario at least.In Lake Superior there are conservation areas that don't allow access at any time to residents or non-residents. Lake Nipigon has some areas that are off limits for specific periods of time in the year to protect endangered species.Road 801 has been posted with some information at the entrance, however I'd be cautious enough to ask at the local conservation authority for up to date information prior. It's a no-win debating with a CO on location."
