6401776,gordy28,2020-03-01 16:48:00,437,The past few years I had been having a debate with myself. *As my daughter continued to show an interest in fishing and I wanted to be able to do day trips on weekend I kept thinking - should I buy a boat or a kayak? Then my older brother and our friend Mark kept talking about fishing kayaks - interesting Well after a bunch of debating I bought myself a Feel Free Lure kayak and my daughter a smaller Pelican Kayak I am quite happy with my choice - but I will say I think I may spend the $$ and get the pedal drive for my boat - its not a cheap addition but I think it will help with positioning and will help with getting from spot a to b on bigger lakes* New trip report up from an outing in October to Haliburton to fish in our yakshttps://www.northernjacks.com/post/y...-in-haliburton Thanks in advance for the read Andrew

It’s so stealthy, and because you’re so close to the water, the action can be pretty intense. I’ve also had pike/musky pull me around, which is a lot fun."
6401874,yooper911,2020-03-01 22:21:00,143,I bought a Perception Pilot pedal drive kayak 2 summers ago and love it . Just picked up a second one. Clearance at Gander when they finally closed in October. The pedal drive is generating as it frees up your hands for casting
6401942,gordy28,2020-03-02 06:48:00,437,Nice - both rigs I looked at - its a real thrill being that close to the water for sure. In the post I mention my brother hooked into a good smallie - trying to net that thing was interesting to say the least I am really thinking I will add the pedal but right now I cannot find anyway to get it in Canada - hoping FeelFree works with MEC where i bought my kayak
6402440,walleyenewby,2020-03-03 12:51:00,36,Bought a Nucanoe for my teen son thinking it would be perfect but he never really got into it. He ended up selling. Fortunately it held it's value pretty good.
6403440,rzep,2020-03-05 06:29:00,1196,"I wonder what age group you guys are in ? I am contemplating kayak but not sure if this is something for ""over 50"" crowd."
6403458,Esoxfeign1313,2020-03-05 07:54:00,79,"I’m in my mid-40’s. I think I definitely push it more than the average kayak fisherman, because I’ll go on overnight camping trips that often require lengthy paddles/portages. However, I see no reason why someone in their 50’s couldn’t handle your average fishing trip. One thing I will suggest is to watch the weight of the kayak, because you will have to carry it/load it on your vehicle. Some brands are heavier than others. Mine weighs about 60#. I’d love to upgrade to a kevlar model. They weigh about half that much, but they’re pricey."
6403472,tandm,2020-03-05 08:28:00,679,"I'm 70 years old and bought my first pedal kayak last spring. It's great for fishing small ponds and backwater areas. I limit usage to protected areas, minimal currant and fish mostly early mornings and evenings. I made a 2-wheel cart to transport it to and from my truck. Weight is , definitely, a concern, as well as accessibility. I bought a sit-on kayak because of the ease of getting in and out, and try to go with another person, whenever possible. L"
6403548,gordy28,2020-03-05 10:49:00,437,I am 45 years old. Per some of the other comments I think it depends on how you plan on using it My kayak weighs about 75 lbs and it is ungainly. I have a pickup with a 5.5 box and bought this bed extender so getting it in and out is fairly easyhttps://www.amazon.ca/Erickson-07605...3430393&sr=8-5 My kayak (FeelFree Lure) also has a wheel in the nose that helps to drag it on paved or compact ground I would be leery of carrying my rig over an extended portage or rough terrain. Hope this helps

I went out on half frozen lake, took a wave, about didn't make back to shore. It was mostly my fault, but that was enough. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
