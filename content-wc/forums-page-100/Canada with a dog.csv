6402538,muskyed,2020-03-03 18:18:00,727,"We fish with our dog all the time. Wouldn't have it any other way. A few safety issues to keep in mind with a dog, keep your boat picked up with no loose lures or hooks. Have water and a dish, have a spot they can lay down at times, and have some shade for them if need be. We have a Bimini top now, but have draped a towel or coat over a chair and the dash at times. Ours can only make it about 6-7 hrs before having to go, so plan accordingly. My wife is fine with that one, so it works for us. When trolling for large fish, salmon and such, we now clip her up to a short leash when landing a fish, as not only do we not want her caught in hooks, but she will try to help us land the fish and jump in, if not restrained. We have a Britt, and if it moves, she wants it. We also have her wear a life jacket when running, or in rough water.Really helps to get her back in the boat when she goes in after fish, seagulls, ducks and whatever as it has a handle on the top to grab."
6402670,ChuckD,2020-03-04 08:28:00,1581,I've taken my lab across the border several times for hunting trips. He's clearly visible in the back seat. I've never been asked for any documents.
6403654,drlee,2020-03-05 17:10:00,409,"Used to take a dog in with me annually. In fact, the only time I was checked at the border, going back into the US, the officer asked me to open the back of my SuV for ""inspection."" He seemed to be taking quite a while, but I was patient. He came back up to my window and said, ""Sorry to keep you so long. But, your Brittany was really nice and frankly, the only reason I asked for an inspection was so I could get a good look at her. I think she likes me."" Made my day!"
6405802,Aspencreek,2020-03-09 22:22:00,2911,"X3We had a guy come with us on our trip, drive to camp, and he brought his dog. Now I love dogs, but this was not a dog it was the devil incarnate. Had to sleep in the owners bed or it barked. Stole food off the table, jumped on the chair and on the table. Wanted to fight with the camp dog, jumped on anyone who made eye contact, had to be on lead if let out to do it's business or it would run, and the owner did nothing to control his behavior and thought he was wonderful. By the end of the week I didn't know which one I disliked more. When we were about to leave in separate vehicles another guy in our party told the owner to ""invest a nickle and shoot that thing"", he didn't ever get invited back. And let me get this straight you are taking this dog on a Fly-in?? So you are sacrificing space and weight for a dog! Oh my.Note to self....you may think your dog is wonderful, others may not."
6405812,prov1900,2020-03-09 23:31:00,544,"Crossing into Ontario a couple years ago, the border agent was all business and kinda short with us. Had me roll down the back window as my two kids were with me, as well as our Black and Tan Coonhound. Window rolls down and the dog was sitting in the drivers side rear. Dog stared straight ahead, like ""Oh boy, they are going to take us all to jail if I make eye contact"". Border Agent busts out laughing and runs out of the booth to pet her. Clearly he was a dog person. You could tell his day was made after that. As far as the original question, I have been asked to produce shot records on occasion, and other times not. Dogs are part of our lives and the one I bring doesn't bother any of the guys I go with. In fact, it is expected she comes along every year. I wouldn't bring her if I thought it was going to bring down anyone's trip. Never did a fly in with her...yet."
6399806,Jdconins,2020-02-26 06:01:00,62,"Good morning to all of you, Chomping a the bit here and already thinking about our fly in beginning of June. This year my one brother will be going with us, had a brother that always wanted to go but he suddenly died at age 48 way to early so I guess you never know. I'm sure I can call customs to find the answer but I'm sure I can get an answer here with some of you who have taken your dog to Canada. What documents etc. are needed when taking your pet across the border? Proof of shots? I've already checked with the outfitter that accepts dogs and the motels along the way that are pet friendly.How did the dog react being in the boat affect your ability to fish, did it get in the way? My fishing partner is okay with the dog going with us. Thanks, Janitor"
6399814,eyecatcher1,2020-02-26 06:31:00,323,This will be my first year taking my dog to Canada also and when I checked a while back all I needed was proof of a rabies shot. I'll check again as the trip gets closer.
6399824,Fisherman Ted,2020-02-26 06:57:00,461,I cross the border every year with my 2 dogs and I have never been asked to show anything. That being said all you need is a current rabies vaccination document. -FT
6399854,BornToFish,2020-02-26 08:08:00,1224,"Greetings, The incident that I will describe happened about fifteen years ago. I had friends that brought their dog with them to Canada. They were allowed to cross the border into Canada with their dog, but were not allowed to bring the dog's food with them. They had to discard the dog's food in the United States, and then purchase new dog food from a store in Ontario. I don't know if this practice is still in place. It may be that it was a one time situation such as with potatoes, eggs, poultry, meat, etc. I mention this incident as I know of dogs that need to have certain foods only and not others. This could pose a problem if the original poster's dog has food allergies. Very kindest regards..."
6399870,CI_Guy,2020-02-26 09:00:00,2118,Two Ontario resorts I've stayed with my son and his dog required proof of vaccination for kennel cough. At the border he always handed the dogs records to the border agents with his passport so they never had to ask for them.
6399938,spurs101,2020-02-26 11:35:00,635,You need a vet examination document. Good for thirty days. It verifies shots and health. I've taken my dogs on several trips.
6399942,GBS,2020-02-26 11:39:00,2271,"Always good to check the official Canadian customs sites. My understanding (which I will test out later this year!) is that you should have proof of all vaccinations. AND - make sure the dog food is in the original packaging, so they can verify country of origin, etc. Unmarked food will have to be thrown out. Much more important - if you don't know how the dog will behave in a boat, especially for longer periods....you MUST take him out locally for a couple of trips. Some are fantastic fishing partners. Some are unbearable. Of my last 3 dogs: #1 - perfect. Loved going fishing with her. #2 - same breed. Insane - constant barking at the bobber, then later transferred that to anytime I cast. That dog NEVER goes fishing. Boat fine. Fishing, NO! #3 - Same breed as #1 discovered that swimming is fun by falling in once - so jumps off the boat a lot! And is very reluctant to come back in. So besides disturbing the fishing, better make sure the others in the boat don't mind a wet dog shaking himself off a lot. (that dog gets to stay home, a lot, also!) And then there is that airplane ride........I would never fly in a loud, shaking bucket of tin with a dog that has never been. Better insist on at least the dog being in a crate. And it may ruin the dog for life when being around other loud machinery like noises. Of course they can be trained/acclimated to it. But needs to be done before the big trip. Might be best to just say no. Claim that you are the one with the allergies, if you must."
6400006,Carnhzkr,2020-02-26 13:20:00,964,Wise words. Especially the point about the airplane ride. Some of those shaky rattly birds are LOUD.
6400138,Fisher-man,2020-02-26 21:34:00,422,"I've crossed multiple times with my dog. Had the current shot records from the vet, but have never been asked. And my motto is don't say anything other than what they ask for. If they don't ask about a dog, I don't mention it. He is usually sitting up in the back seat, so they can see him, but, again, never even been asked about him. And he is great in the boat. Sleeps in the bow, unless we are moving. Of course, he's the greatest bird dog to ever take to the field, so I wouldn't have expected anything else from him."
6402488,Jdconins,2020-03-03 14:41:00,62,"Thanks to all that responded, reached out to Canadian customs and was told all a dog needs is a valid rabbies certificate. The part about the dog food having to be discarded is no longer in effect, a few years back as the previous posted indicated, certain types of dog were not allowed in the country."
