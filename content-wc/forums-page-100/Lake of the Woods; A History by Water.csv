6404936,DeBo,2020-03-08 07:25:00,211,Per the US Largest lakes Wiki page it is #7 behind Great Salt Lake and the Great Lakes.Al or your memory of what he said is way off though compared to the Canadian lakes. Number 15 on that list. Great Bear is roughly 7 times larger.Big lake and a ton of fun to fish and explore. Those history vids are awesome and Iâ€™ve watched them multiple times.
6404962,Shotgun,2020-03-08 08:51:00,759,"Carnhzkr, thanks for posting. Enjoyed the history and the video of the country. We've fished some of that area and have traveled through there numerous times."
6404968,tandm,2020-03-08 09:22:00,679,"Two years ago, a father/son team got lost after heading out of Nester Falls for a day of fishing. They got lost and ended up spending the night on an island near French Portage, where we were staying. They, apparently got disoriented after clouds and haze moved in, and were traveling north instead of south.They, finally, ran out of fuel ,paddled to shore and were able to turn their boat over to provide shelter overnight. Authorities were able too find them the next day. They, apparently, had a marine radio, but I wonder what they had for navigation aids. When I fish big water I carry a hard copy map and a compass as a backup for my gps unit, as wall as a drybag with emergency supplies and seasonal clothing.Because of the size of many of the waters I fish, I always carry a marine radio."
6405048,Carnhzkr,2020-03-08 12:13:00,964,"I agree. I double-checked to make sure Al said largest in North America and not United States, and he does in fact state that LOTW is the 6th largest ""fresh water"" lake in NA, but that's just wrong. It is the 6th largest in US since Salt Lake is not fresh water. Here's the show and it's at about the 15:30 mark:http://theontarioexperience.tv/witch-bay-camp-show-10/"
6403622,Carnhzkr,2020-03-05 14:40:00,964,"I ran across this two-part documentary on LoTW and found it to be quite interesting. The narrator circumnavigates the lake by boat telling bits of history. Part 1 goes from Kenora to around Baudette on the western side. Part 2 continues on the eastern side. He spends a good bit of time in the Sabaskong, Turtle Portage, and Whitefish Bay areas. They're about 35 minutes each. Check 'em out if you've got some time and are interested in the area.

6403638,Lazy Fisherman,2020-03-05 15:19:00,276,I had already watched the videos and found them interesting and historically informative. Thanks for posting. May have to watch them again.
6404052,Pooch,2020-03-06 12:01:00,4618,Thumbs up!Thanks for sharing. I know nothing of LOW so this was all new to me. Much more development than I would have expected.A very pretty lake.Thanks again.Pooch
6404062,Cornholio,2020-03-06 12:34:00,353,"Thanks for sharing. I was surprised by how many islands there are on that lake, it's crazy."
6404178,Twodogs,2020-03-06 18:59:00,115,Thank you.. that was really enjoyable to watch .
6404222,prov1900,2020-03-07 01:29:00,544,"We went to LOW for the first time last year so I scoured YouTube for everything I could find. That was a worthwhile watch for sure. This will be year two for us, so I watched it again!"
6404252,That Minnesota guy,2020-03-07 05:13:00,8293,Lots of islands thats for sure. But you need to take a good look at a map to realize just how big a piece of water you are talking about. That lake is huge.
6404320,stjoeguy,2020-03-07 07:37:00,979,"Great videos. Thanks for sharing them. The trees, rocks, islands, wildlife and water like that are what keep me going back to Ontario as often as I can."
6404358,Carnhzkr,2020-03-07 08:54:00,964,"Surprisingly huge. I was watching one of the Linder shows when Troy was at Witch Bay and in a cutaway Al asks if you can guess how LOTW ranks in order of the largest lakes in North America. I was thinking maybe 7 or 8, but according to Al it ranks 6th behind the Great Lakes. Apparently it's larger than Great Bear, Slave and Winnipeg. I didn't realize that."
6404360,Bill Krejca,2020-03-07 08:57:00,6107,"Good videos, an excellent opportunity to gain a wide perspective on the huge water shed and its diverse landscape. Bill"
