6400042,Mojo-NC,2020-02-26 15:31:00,1929,"We've been going up to Canada for 20 years now and we pretty much have it down to a science. However, this past year we did our first fly-in. Of course we knew the basics, but there were a few unknowns and those specifics were keeping me up at night. How important is the weight? It turns out, not as big of a deal as we thought. We only had 4 guys so it wasn't even an issue. We did try to keep our packing to the bare necessities. Food has been covered in several other threads. Bring a good rain suit and pack accordingly for dressing in layers. Nobody cares if you wear the same jeans for 3 or 4 consecutive days unless they really get ripe. We brought different clothes for travel days and for fishing. Bring a good fish finder with GPS and a map of the lake if one exists. We dropped waypoints all over the lake and could immediately get right back on fish or unique structure once we located them. I can't imagine going without one. It was probably the most important factor in our success. What about electricity for recharging the fish finders? There was a small generator that we used to charge our fish finder batteries every day - easy peasy. We charged the batteries while we were preparing and eating dinner. I had a 3 amp charger so my 9 amp gel cell batteries took 3 hours or less to completely recharge. Our cabin also had solar powered batteries to provide electricity to power lights in the cabin (unless of course you have a guy who likes to leave the bathroom light on all night in case he needs to get up to pee). It's worse when he runs the batteries down immediately prior to the two only rainy/foggy days we had during the week, so we were without lights other than our flashlights for 2 days until the solar powered batteries finally recharged. Duh! Lesson learned. We were lucky enough to have indoor plumbing in our cabin and a nice shower. The cabin also had a propane refrigerator. All of the water in the cabin was pulled from the lake, but that worked just fine. We had our outfitter deliver 10 gallons of drinking water and several cases of beer during his midweek check in for the previous group at no additional charge and it saved a bunch of weight. The fish cleaning shed had a freezer in it. We froze our fish guts in a 5 gallon bucket every day and then brought them across to the other side of the lake to dump them the following day so they wouldn't attract bears. The eagles and gulls loved us. Bring plenty of rods and reels in case you have an incident. One of our guys had a pike pull one rod and reel overboard in 30' of water - no getting that one back. Another broke on a hook-set so he was down to two. We each brought four apiece, two spinning and two casting. I only broke one. Don't forget a stringer - one per boat! What a PITA that was! We didn't keep many fish, but when we did it was difficult using the stringer we had to make with some rope we found. Don't sweat the small stuff - we had the time of our lives. What did I forget? Any other tidbits from your previous experiences?"
6400094,That Minnesota guy,2020-02-26 18:51:00,8293,"While waiting on the dock for our plane to come get us I had one thought. Did the group next to us (waiting for a plane also) bother buying a fishing license? If so why? They had enough beer to last for God knows how long. I'm not sure they even had food with. When it was our turn to weigh in the guy just chuckled and said you are fine. Now those guys over there, not so much. I think their group of 6 was over weight by like 500 lbs if I recall right. I'm all for enjoying the trip and having a cold beer but I think being able to remember part of the trip should be a goal also."
6400100,tandm,2020-02-26 18:57:00,679,"2 items I take in are my own life preservers and my own landing nets. Most outfitters furnish these two items, but they don't guarantee the condition. I have seen dirty, musty life preservers and landing nets with rotten netting and/or holes in the net. Not an issue with all fly in outposts, but clean, dry life preservers and a good landing net don't add much weight and can make the difference between a great experience and the one that got away."
6400108,tandm,2020-02-26 19:19:00,679,"The plane that picked us up at the end of our week had 15 cases of beer and a case of whiskey for the six fishermen that were fishing the next week. I guess , if it's your vacation, you can enjoy it however you want."
6400114,adempsey2.0,2020-02-26 19:29:00,611,"Weight CAN matter. It depends on the outfitter and if the plane is being chartered. Sometimes it's simply a matter of paying $1-1.50/lb extra. Worth doing if necessary. Sometimes they are very strict. Find out ahead of time, so you don't worry about it unnecessarily.Pre-fly in all of your drinks/oil/water if the option is available.Make sure you check that all pilot lights are lit and that you have full tanks of propane and gas BEFORE the pilot leaves.Do NOT leave food for the next group. Especially in the fridge and freezer. They DO NOT want it. Non-perishables are OK, but it's still a rare occasion when you need to use 1 of the 10 leftover packs of fish batter.Manual water filters are amazing. The gravity filters (e.g., Platypus) or single serving (Katadyn BeFree) are simply amazing. You don't need to bring any water with these, although we usually bring a couple cases if weight allows. The cases of water are the first to be left behind if we are overweight.Bring a sheet and pillowcase. Maybe even a pillow if you have room.Bring Sandals. I never used to, but now I always do. Getting up to pee in the middle of the night...sandals are very useful.Learn how to Ranger Roll your clothes. Not everyone likes it, but I do. Also, think in layers. I still bring too many clothes, but I am working on it!Good sponges for the boat. I love a nice absorbent sponge to keep the boat dry and clean. I always bring my own now as the ones usually at the camp are no good or non-existent. I usually leave the ones I brought behind.Spare hats and sunglasses. These are must haves for me and if I lose either it really sucks. So, I bring a couple of spares. Same with reading glasses if you use them.A gift for the owners/pilot/camp caretakers. This is in addition to the tip. Just a nice gesture and a good way to start your trip."
6400158,Eckohlt,2020-02-27 04:26:00,3685,"Oh the old days of drinking on fly in trips wake up in the morning go to boat and there is 30 to 40 empty beer cans in the boat,get back to Minnesota and people ask me how was your trip my reply was I don't know I can't remember it,those days are long gone sober now for 37 years,much more enjoyable now,just have to worry about running out of bait now ."
6400190,gordy28,2020-02-27 07:01:00,437,One thing for me to try to remember this trip is to be ready on the AM of pick up day but leave at least 1 rod and some lures out - in general we have never been picked up before 1 PM but have just spent our time lazing about wit everything packed up tight I did write about things I feel are essential on a trip https://www.northernjacks.com/post/5...-guest-editors Cheers Andrew
6400240,Golden Eagle,2020-02-27 09:31:00,2642,"When in the bush, don't throw anything away. It might be needed later. I've experience being picked up late three times: 30 hours 12 hours - flying at treetops. Expecting to land on a lake to spend night. Hoping for a shelter. 3 days - this one went easy as I was with 3 Canadian camp owners. All 3 quite capable. Catching fish was not an option. Boiled water for drinking worked. Dried beans and cornbread mix fed us well. Of course our take home fish were eaten. Most fishermen take extra pills, just in case."

I can say that 45 fly in trips later,plus the canoe trips taken and a dozen or more bear hunts . There is nothing like the feeling ,as the float plane leaves and you have week in the wilderness . Enjoying the lake, the bush, the quietness ,catching and eating walleye !!"

6405756,Pink Unicorn,2020-03-09 18:39:00,83,"I am the same way but because I take two trips with two different groups, I have different reactions. My guys trip (usually 4 or 6) actually appreciates the OCD. We compete to see how light we can pack and consider it a big accomplishment to be under weight. My family trip (between 8-26 this year!) I've learned to chill out. We bring up giant inflatable pool toys for beach days and I put no restrictions on alcohol or food. I guess life is about balance!Regarding water- I'd recommend everyone to pick up a life straw water bottle. Makes lake water safe to drink and takes up next to no weight!"
6406962,gmattbruin,2020-03-12 08:15:00,174,"Our group of 8 have done abt 12,13 flyins now. Spend as much $ as you feel you can afford on the best rain gear you can....Very few weeks in June will not see at least 1 day of rain, cold.....really good gear will keep you out on the water instead of in camp. No need to fly in bottled water, hand pump your water, its amazing. Tackle can be reduced to jigs, few body baits, made up worm harnesses....simple!! We take all food tht can be frozen in coolers. ALL other food and stuff tht will get used in cardboard boxes which get burned on last day. We also bring in a can crusher. We dont skimp on beer, but dont drink like yrs ago. We can get all our beer crushed down into 1 large garbage bag. Sure helps the pilots out when reloading to come out. We also now put any booze, eg whiskey, rum into collapesable plastic containers of same size. Less weight than glass, and when done the plastic goes into our gear bag. Also helps on weight and pilots loading. We have all seriously cut back on clothes, extra gear,etc. Most bring in a good size duffle bag or backpack as opposed to a hockey bag size. It really is amazing how little you need for a remote fly in camp for a week."
6402332,jveri,2020-03-03 08:10:00,70,"bring a 8"" and 12"" inch non stick frying pan and leave them behind when your week is done, most of our trips the cabin had pans that were destroyed to cook on. 25 bucks save a few hours of scrubbing during the week. Bring a few sharp chefs knives as well"

It is important to point out that I limit the length of the rods to 7'6"" or less. Not ideal, but good enough.Of course you can get away with 1 rod if you wanted. For Pike, I bring up to 2 spinning rods, 1-2 baitcasters and a trolling rod depending on season. I want to throw and troll bigger baits. If I had to throw just 1oz spoons for a week, well sure I could do that and likely be successful. However, if I don't need to, I won't and I think it increases my success rate.

I understand this could be a whole new thread, but my point here, I believe fits in to the ""lessons learned"". I have seen many groups pack stuff in garbage bags (pillows, sleeping bags, parkas, etc...), harmless enough....light weight, keeps items mostly clean and together but beware (I dont speak from personal experience but through another in our group) in the confusion of loading out of camp and flying back to base to go home, you have all of your gear, baggage, etc.. along with trash from your week in the bush, staged at or near dock. Now the plane arrives with the new group. You help them offload, keeping their equipment and baggage separate from yours....( you can probably see where this is going). Now it's time to load your baggage....handing everything to bush pilot to pack for flight back..... now when back at float base while being off- loaded the dock hands grab those garbage bags to dispose of while you are busy hauling stuff to your vehicle, or going to bathroom, or settling with outfitter or what have you....if you are not mindful it is easy to see how you could get home and that bag with pillow or sleeping bag or whatever is missing and most likely on way to a dump in Canada......."

I have seen (only once or twice, but that is enough) things like sleeping bags, jackets and/or pillows accidentally getting bumped off the dock, which on a cold and rainy week, is a real pain. I have about 3 or 4 dry bags of varying size that I use for all of my trips now, and someone is always welcome to use one of my extras."

I also now bring clear safety glasses for fishing in gloomy conditions after I got hit in the head with a pike lure when not wearing any glasses... luckily no hook set !We tend to bring 2 off walleye rods per guy plus one heavier pike rig for trolling or lakers. We bring one spare reel and ensure all reels are packed separately in a proper reel case.

6402274,Waba,2020-03-03 05:29:00,25,"As a fishing guide at a fly in lodge in Northern Ontario, I have seen hundreds of guests land for their once in a life time or ""annual"" fishing trip.The difference between the once in a life time groups and the annual groups is amazing. I guess the first to establish is that my experience is guiding for a full scale lodge with cabins as opposed to some of you who I am sure are speaking about ""outpost"" trips. 1)The first mistake I see guests make is not communicating with us prior to arriving. Ive seen countless party's arrive with very little actual supplies as they were saving weight for the beer. I think folks would be surprised that many lodges will simply have your beer waiting in your cabin when you arrive. I have herd horror stories about MASSIVE fee's added on for such a service but I don't think that's the norm. 5-7$ per case as a delivery fee seems to be fairly standard. 2) Easy on the rods and tackle guy's! 2 rods per person is more than enough. I've had clients attempt to bring 7-8 rods in my boat! So much clutter and absolutely no need. If anything just tuck a spare reel in your bag,and a spool of extra line. Again communicate with the lodge before going on the inevitable pre -trip tackle shopping spree. I keep the lodge stocked with tackle that is actually hitting on the lakes at the time you arrive. Most lead guides do the same at most lodges.The only question then would be how much of a premium is the lodge adding on to the tackle? Ask! You will be pleasantly surprised that many lodges are charging a rate comparable to Walmart! 3) I think most would be amazed at the amount of people who bring 5, $300 rods and 2 grand worth of tackle yet bring in a 10$ set of rain gear! If you are planning a trip to Northern Ontario for a week plan on spending at least one day in the rain. I've seen many many guests just miserable and uncomfortable in the boat (or even call the guide day short) because they were more worried about their fishing gear than appropriate clothing. I always feel bad for them. 4) Last but not least bring a drift sock! I don't know of any lodges that outfit their boats with drift socks. As a guide that's on the water 99% of the time I can tell you a huge portion of my clients success is simply my ability to maintain a proper horizontal drift or troll at a appropriate speed. If you end up arriving at the beginning of a very windy week you will thank me for this one! Those are the obvious ones I can think of right now. But number one tip I have if visiting a lodge style fly-in..ASK,COMMUNICATE, and follow the advise you receive. You may be surprised how much stress and anxiety a good outfitter can alleviate for you. Tight Lines, Waba"
6402302,adempsey2.0,2020-03-03 07:06:00,611,"While this may be true in certain situations, I assure you there are many times I can easily justify bringing 8 rods. Trophy pike fishing alone is usually 4 rods. Add on Walleye and maybe Lake Trout or Brook Trout and you can easily see how the amount of tackle can go up and up. Even when you try to use the same setups for multi-species.A guided lodge maybe less so because, as you said, you know what methods are working. Normally I wouldnt bring all my rods into the boat either unless I plan on fishing 3+ species. It definitely is not pleasant when I do and prefer not to.Regardless, people love their tackle and these trips are the excuse to 'use' it! So don't be too hard on the tackle junkies either Sent from my SM-A530W using Tapatalk"

As a former gear junkie (who often re-lapses for years at a time) Ive also been guilty of telling myself I need 8 trophy pike rods ,a dozen rods for walleye,not including my bouncer rods, ect.. When talking to guests (usually the ""once in a lifetime crowd"") while waiting for the plane at the end of their trip,it never fails I hear "" why did I bring all this gear!?"". I agree, if it were myself heading to a outpost camp, I would tend to pack a little gear heavier. p.s..know whats really sad about my addiction? I'm also a fly gear junkie. The struggle is real."
6402312,1100 Remington Man,2020-03-03 07:43:00,73,Not true a Bait Casting Rod for Northerns and a Spinning Rod is all that is needed. Northern's are not Muskies leave the Bulldogs at home. As the Pilot if everyone brought 8 rods you will have a problem on the plane. I have been at the Kenora Airport and seen fishing rod cases left at the Airport because there was not room on the bush plane. Just Saying

Screwdriver, adjustable crescent wrench, allen wrenches, duct tape, zip ties. My first fly-in was compromised because of a single allen wrench (left on my workbench). It was the one used to tighten the bolt on the portable transducer bracket that keeps the transducer at your desire angle. Had to get creative on how to hold the transducer in place."

Two other boxes with Northern Pike lures. This was more tackle than needed. Rods 2 one spinning 6lb mono one casting 17lb mono. I had a home made rod case 7ft of 2 inch PVC pipe glued end cap on with a little foam cushion other end glued on a end screw out cap. It can be stranded on and is unfazed.

Just my observation."

Waking up miserably hung over or being out all night and driving the next day and pulling over so guys can throw up on the side of the road. We had a good time but man...i do not miss that at all!!!! Couple drinks at night and thats good enough for this old man. I have only done 1 fly in trip and it was great...other than the unusually hot weather the week we went. Was so hot was very hard getting sleep at night. The fishing was fantastic.
