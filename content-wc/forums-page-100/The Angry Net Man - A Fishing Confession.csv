6400220,pjshorthorn,2020-02-27 08:27:00,5654,"Great blog post. Reading it brought back a lot of great memories ( maybe not so much in the heat of the moment ) fishing with my buds offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. A good friend was always in pursuit of big fish and pushed his vessel further and further out into the ocean as each year went along. A few of us were dedicated to being part of that cause ( think deckhands...LOL) and we saw the good, the bad and the ugly over those years that we all fished together. We had a lot of success in catching big fish across numerous species over the years and when one or more rods would start screaming , our Captain would turn into a boot camp drill Sargent barking orders faster than you could process them in your mind.The orders were filled with language and name calling that would make the most ardent of sailors blush. When a big fish was on, organized chaos ensued while trolling 7-8 knots ( 8-9 mph). El Capitan normally would be at the helm ( unless it was his turn to land a fish) and the rest of us would go to our designated spots. Once all other rods were cleared, there was one at the helm, one on the rod, one on the gaff ( or gun) and the 4th person manning the fish boxes under the deck to quickly contain an angry fish ,while still hooked , once it came into the boat. If we had a fifth person on board, they just got the heck out of the way and went to the bow to watch the show and take photos. One of my most vivid memories was when our buddy Denny was up to bat and the center rod off the stern just started screaming. Then it started...... Denny, get the GD rod NOW !!! Who the #&&@$ is on the gaff ? Hey @#$&# . What the #&@$@ are you doing ? Listen to me you #$@&@# , get over here and stay the @#&#$ out of the way. Denny, why are you over there? You are moving too @$#&#& much !!! Stay there @##&&. The barrage of orders was non stop for a few minutes.....and then we saw the fish jump during the fight. It was a 50+ class Mahi-mahi. Then the orders got worse for me because I was on the gaff....the most critical spot in successfully landing a big fish....just like netting that trophy Musky, Pike or Walleye. Hey @##$&, you sure you can gaff this fish ? Just run the @##&& boat, I'll gaff the @#$&. Don't lie to me @##$&, you got this fish ? And that discussion went on for what seemed like an eternity. The worse thing one wants to have happen is to knock a fish off with the net, miss the fish with the first gaff on the first attempt, or worse yet , have the fish come off the gaff when it is lifted into the boat. Think about a huge northern or Musky flopping around the deck while still hooked when no one is wearing shoes.....not a pretty sight. Yep, it happens to Denny on one trip...right through the top of his shoe and big toe. I wasn't sure how this was going to turn out, but I was totally committed. At some point, I just blocked out the yelling and focused on Denny and the fish. Eventually I got my opportunity to gaff the fish and it immediately went into beast mode nearly ripping my shoulder out of the socket. The yelling got worse...... It took a few seconds to regroup and muster the strength to lift the fish out of the water and then swing it over the gunwale and directly into the fishbox that was already open. No pressure at all.......a flopping fish that is still hooked in the cockpit was always the worst case scenario. Thankfully, everything worked out and Denny had a trophy fish in the box. After many high fives, a smoke and waiting for the fish to chill out in the box......the apologies ( kinda) would start to come out. The standard response was.....Hey, I didn't mean anything by it. I just got excited.  LOL. We all knew how El Capitan was in the heat of the battle and we embraced the moments because many of them were truly memories made for a lifetime. If I pulled into the driveway of his beach house today , unannounced , he would give me a lot of grief and start walking towards the boat lift and say..........@##& it, let's go fishing. You can figure out which @##&# I am from attached the pictures. Don't get me started about what it was like when we had a big cobia on that had to be dispatched with a .22 pistol before coming in the boat. PjShorthorn"
6400306,gordy28,2020-02-27 11:16:00,437,Wow - what a great story and so awesome that you have pictures!I keep reminding myself that I need to get better at recording stuff on our tripsmemories are great but pictures help jog the memory lol
6400368,emma17,2020-02-27 12:36:00,436,"Great post topic and stories. Unfortunately I share your adrenaline blast when a netable fish is on, and when there's been an issue, too many times it's my own fault. Like, I've got a fish on my casting rod and I call for the net (code is we're going to need a bigger boat). Of course the net man/woman never arrives fast enough for my liking. Then I look over and see they are trying to untangle something from the net to free it up. Well that just gets me right up on my high horse- I told you to keep the crap off the floor and free from the net. I knew this was only a matter of time.... Naturally it all works out and I have to feel silly. But it gets worse when I hear my son say, hey dad, the next time you use your jigging pole you'll need to retie the line. Why I demand to know. It was caught up in the net."
6401342,troutwater,2020-02-29 15:24:00,299,"Good read. I'm definitely anticlimactic when I have on a nice fish. 2 years ago I caught a 47 3/4 muskie with my friend. I had it hooked for about 10 seconds before I just said, ""Hey I think I got a fish."" He turned around and saw my rod thumping from headshakes and ran around like crazy getting the net. Last year I caught a 48"" and never even said anything. He heard the thrash of the strike and just got the net. I wasn't in the boat when this happened, but my buddy caught a 51×23 muskie a few years ago. When he told my brother to get the net the response was, ""**** you"" and kept fishing LOL. Pretty sure if anyone in our group ordered people around and yelled they'd end up at the bottom of the lake."
6399834,gordy28,2020-02-26 07:22:00,437,Was out with the guys in my group to discuss a few things for our upcoming trip to Miniss Lake (in August but a good excuse for beers and wings) As always we spent a good amount of time reliving past trips and ripping into each other. One thread that kept coming up for me is the way I get when a fish is on the line and it spawned a new post https://www.northernjacks.com/post/the-angry-net-man Thanks in advance for the read and would love to hear about anyone else's fishing challenges
6399860,Willie_G,2020-02-26 08:48:00,4,"Great blog Drew, you definitely get amped up when the fish approach the boat. You definitely don't want me as your net guy I'm pretty tragic. Willie"
6399866,MN_Moose,2020-02-26 08:53:00,964,brings up a good point. we take rookies along to Canada and expect everyone knows how to react with a big fish on the line. I've been thinking about nettin' practice. Practice using a dock buoy. Have one end of the buoy tied on with yellow rope (the head). Throw it out and bring it back in. Coach your rookie to net it from the yellow rope side and not the back end. Teaching them not to stab at it. I'm certain I'd get razzed by my crew for being such a dork wanting to practice netting a fish.
6399880,Hot Runr Guy,2020-02-26 09:13:00,16061,"Great read, thanks for sharing. HRG"
6399892,Hewhocookstomuch,2020-02-26 09:45:00,66,"This has happened. If you are going to use a camp supplied net, make sure there are no tears or holes in the net before you leave the dock. Over the years some nice fish have been lost due to a bad net."
6399898,cast_and_blast,2020-02-26 09:54:00,1098,Funny stuff and I can relate. Need the net? I'm on it!! I expect the same when I need the net...doesn't always happen.
6399992,Esoxfeign1313,2020-02-26 12:40:00,79,"On my first fly-in to Canada, I caught my first trophy pike on literally my last cast of the trip (I estimate it was between 40”-45” and >20#), which was great, except the only net we brought had to be cut to free a pike that my friend caught the day before. I ended up having to do a boat-side release, which was rather anticlimactic. Needless to say, we brought 2 nets on the next trip."
6400036,Ltrain,2020-02-26 15:05:00,4145,"Haha great read Drew, and I thought I was the only one like that"
6400178,tv4fish,2020-02-27 05:50:00,2694,"When my boat is in Canada - it always has 2 nets - a nice ""rubber"" net for the walleyes and a large net for the northerns/muskies. That rubber net is great for the walleyes - makes it much easier to handle them - it just wouldn't handle the larger pike............. Like Mikey says -""try it - you'll like it"" ........."
6400184,Esoxfeign1313,2020-02-27 06:42:00,79,"Those rubber-coated nets are nice. Funny enough, the one we had was like that, but my friend is a spaz and brought his one big pike in too green, and it just wrapped itself up so bad that he had to cut the net. You have to tire those big ones out a little! Smh"
