6398722,bigcreekdad,2020-02-23 07:51:00,74,Looking for a fly in within 4 or so hours drive from the Sault. Don't really want to drive to NW Ontario area. Any thoughts...thinking both outpost or full service lodge. Thanks

Or, drive just a little further than Hearst and go to Nakina. In my opinion, the Wawa/White River area outfitters have nice cabins on decent lakes with pretty good fishing. Its a great experience. The outfitters out of Hearst and Nakina have rougher cabins, but the fishing is definitely up a notch."
6399046,gordy28,2020-02-24 07:45:00,437,This would be very similar to our groups experience We did two trips with White River Air and would highly recommend them but we did find the fishing much better out of Nakina If you are interested trip reports on: Pickle Lake w White Riverhttps://www.northernjacks.com/post/5...r-first-fly-in And Shekak Lake w WRAhttps://www.northernjacks.com/post/l...fish-to-happen Thanks Andrew

Ther are a number of AP lodges on Esnagi, Kabinakagami and Nagagami Lakes that are worth a look. I dont think the lodges on Obakamiga Lake offer American Plan, if that is what you meant by full service. Nice lodges though.I think my preference would be Nagagami Lake for a lodge. I have not been to Esnagi though.These lodges fly out of Wawa, White River or Hornepayne.Train-in lodges on Wabatongushi as well (and Esnagi).Sent from my SM-A530W using Tapatalk"
6399186,Guest,2020-02-24 13:43:00,0,Been going 11 years here after driving forever to NW Ontario for previous 10 years. We cut our travel time in half and enhanced the quality of our catch over previous camp in NW Ontario. We go (and I highly recommend) Expeditions North but there are three other camps on this large lake. Doesn't feel overcrowded to me but certainly not the adventure that I had in NW Ontario.

6402276,Waba,2020-03-03 05:47:00,25,"Check out Errington's Wilderness Island Resort! Air service is located at Hawk Junction (just outside of Wawa). Great prices, Outstanding fishing, Great cabins, cedar strip boats.https://www.wildernessisland.com/"
