6405334,BornToFish,2020-03-09 05:40:00,1224,"Greetings, I recently watched the episode on youtube for the show filmed on Anishinabi Lake (spelling ?) - very interesting and entertaining. I saw the segments of the show that featured guide John J. I had the clear suspicion that I met this guide somewhere along the way based on his appearance and voice. Since watching the show, I've been trying to remember where I might have met John. ProV: I met a guide at Manotak Lodge on Perrault Lake about five years. This would have been early in the season. This guide and I had a nice conversation at the dock late one afternoon. Per chance, might that guide have been you? If not, I have no idea where we might have met one another. Very kindest regards...."
6405342,prov1800,2020-03-09 05:59:00,5010,Although i do guide on Perrault Lake that wasnt me at Manotak Lodge.I do guide at the camps on Cedar Lake and that is how i get to Perrauĺt.I guide at a number of camps from Eagle Lake to Lac Suel either in a camp boat or in my own boat including Clay Lake and the Indian Lake chain.Might of met somewhere along that route.Changing up lakes really keeps it interesting for me.The show was fun.Troy is a really nice guy and loves his fishing.We caught a lot of fish on that show just didnt come up with any big ones and can only show a few of each.Only spent a day and a half fishing and day 2 was not a nice day wind wise.But thats fishing.Where do you normally stay.
6405400,BornToFish,2020-03-09 08:30:00,1224,"Greetings,I fished for many years on Perrault Lake from Manotak Lodge. I now am fishing on Stormer and Kirkness Lakes from Stormer Lake Lodge. Meeting you at Manotak Lodge was my best guess as to where I might have met you. Now, I'm thinking it might have been at one of the sport/All Canada shows.Good fishing and tight lines!!p.s. There are some really interesting shows on the website for The Ontario Experience. I watch a youtube video most days while eating lunch."

6402416,prov1800,2020-03-03 11:43:00,5010,I missed it this morning.got to watch the time zones.lol.
6402542,jackpotjohnny48,2020-03-03 18:36:00,153,"Thanks for the heads up. I'm planning to watch it, but I don't get the Sportsman's channel. So I always end up having to wait a week before the videos are uploaded to YouTube or to the Ontario Experience webpage. And then I watch the episodes on my phone while I'm doing my treadmill workouts. They usually upload the most recent episode on Thursday or Friday every week, so it will be another 2 or 3 days before I can watch the episode. But I'm looking forward to checking it out..."
6402546,jackpotjohnny48,2020-03-03 18:41:00,153,"And here's the link to where I usually watch Troy Lindner's Ontario Experience. As of today, they have only uploaded the first 9 episodes of the 2020 TV season. The Clark's Camp episode (at Anishinabi) is episode #10. As I mentioned in the previous reply, I'm expecting this episode to be available online by about Thursday or Friday of this week, as that seems to be when they usually upload their most recent episodes....http://theontarioexperience.tv/watch-episodes/"
