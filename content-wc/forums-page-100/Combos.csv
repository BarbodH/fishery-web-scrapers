6405900,Mojo-NC,2020-03-10 07:54:00,1929,"It doesn't matter how many rods I have with me, I would probably only use four. Spinning rods: one is a 6'8 medium-extra fast Mojo Bass rod that I use for pulling spinner rigs, and the other is a 6'6"" medium-fast Fenwick HMG that I use for jigging. Baitcasting: one 7'0"" medium heavy - moderate fast Mojo Bass that I use for lighter crankbaits, and a 7'0"" medium heavy - moderate Eyecon that I use for the larger spoons, spinnerbaits, and crankbaits. Even if I had 10 or 12 rods with me, these would likely be the only ones that I would use."
6405964,stjoeguy,2020-03-10 09:31:00,979,"Bringing my own boat or using a camp boat on fly-ins, I'll bring 3 rods and spinning reels. One medium-heavy for casting & trolling spoons for northerns and 2 medium-light for pitching jigs for walleyes."
6406004,Camoclad,2020-03-10 10:23:00,628,I am all for that!
6406342,pikeandtina,2020-03-10 20:18:00,145,I love this response so much!
6405188,Guest,2020-03-08 16:40:00,0,"The fly-in rod and reel combo thread got me thinking, for those of you that bring your own boat, or use a camp boat, how many combos do you bring along? Me, I'm thinking I'll bring up 6-8 this year."
6405296,prov1900,2020-03-09 00:52:00,544,"I'm going to attempt to bring less. Less clutter in the boat, plus I always end up using only a fraction of what I bring. So...8-10"
6405344,prov1800,2020-03-09 06:05:00,5010,Thats a lot of rods lol.
6405354,port1042,2020-03-09 07:01:00,509,"I take 4. All St. Croix spinning combo's with Pflueger Reels. A light/fast 6'6"" for perch and crappie. A med-light/fast 6'6"" for walleye jigging. A medium/fast 7' for throwing cranks. A heavy/fast 7' for soaking cisco's for pike. I usually have the first 3 in the boat and take the heavy rod when I'm on a mission."
6405368,prov1800,2020-03-09 07:30:00,5010,"Depends what the day calls for. If iam in a camp boat i bring 2.Favorite is my tournament 6'8""med extra fast that will detect the slightest bite and a tournament med heavy 7' 2""bait caster in case tge plan from walkeye changes to toothier stuff.If iam in my own boat i do happen to have 12 in my rod locker.lol."
6405442,Eckohlt,2020-03-09 09:50:00,3685,"Just go buy a bunch of glx loomis 6 and 6 n half ft rods medium fast action your good to go,you can feel dead minnows wiggle on them"
6405458,Guest,2020-03-09 10:28:00,0,"I have been taking 5 up lately. 6'8"" St Croix Avid with Quantam Smoke reel, 6'9"" Fenwick Walleye Elite Tech with Smoke, 7'0 St Croix Eyecon casting with Quantam reel;, 6'10"" Carrot Stick baitcaster with Lew's and a 7' Cabelas Prodigy with Quantam KVD spinning reel (for back up) I rig the two spinning reels with different jigs and/or swimbait. I rig one baitcaster for bottom bouncing and the other for trolling/casting cranks and spoons."
6405568,Camoclad,2020-03-09 14:00:00,628,"For a camp boat, I usually bring 2 or 3 rods depending on how much space/weight/other gear we have. I like a 6'6'' medium/fast spinning rod for jigging, and then either a 7ft. med/heavy spinner or baitcaster for casting to structure or trolling. For our fly-ins I usually take ugly stick rods because they travel easy and are pretty durable. At home I use Fenwicks or Lew's in my own boat."
6405606,That Minnesota guy,2020-03-09 14:55:00,8293,Just bring the 7' med heavy baitcaster for those Pike & Smallmouth. They will even bring in the rough-fish ( Walleye) should you accidentally snag one.
6405656,valley366,2020-03-09 16:15:00,193,"Packing for my 2 sons and I we probably bring too many rods for some folks. I pack for each person 2 - Med Light spinning, 1 - Med trolling, 1 - Med Heavy Pike. My 11 year old has also started using a bait caster and has plans of adding that to his arsenal this year.The ML rods get used the most. Like having different color combos and being able to swap colors quickly. Also like having the second rigged so if get on fish have one ready in case snap a line. We do drive in resort with using their boats. In the event that I decide to bring my own boat the rod lockers will be full."
