I know that at times lakes like LOTW, Georgian Bay, and even St. Clair can be good. What are some others that you can reccomend? I don't mind driving far if the fishing is worth it. The ony conditions are that it has to be between June 1st and the 3rd week of August, the docking facilities have to be good enought that I can take my boat up there without beaching it, and I dont want to go to a lake that redefines the meaning of boating hazzards if I can help it. Thanks for any ideas you may have. Ruddiger"

The best place to access it is north of Minaki at Whitedog or Caribou falls. There are some muskies below whitedog, but not too many. If you want muskies, just spend some time at Minaki."

It's a big lake(240,000 acres) so it might be worth your while to hire a guide to get you on the real hot spots,but pike are everywhere and usually easilly catchable.+you catch the odd muskie once in a while. Good luck."
