538561,Brax,2004-03-31 20:02:00,52,"It all depends on what time you hit the border. I tried staying in FF 2 years ago. Got to the border around 4 pm on Friday and still had a 45 minute wait. I think if you get to the border before 9 am you should pass through with no wait. Not sure how long the lines last into the evening. My plan this year is to stay at the Day's Inn ($64 a night) in IF, get up early and cross the border. once on the otherside I will stop for breakfast. Brax"

538567,Guest,2004-04-01 00:31:00,0,like everywhere lese they have a rush hour too thats why we stop at the holiday Inn and have dinner before crossing. it seems like around 7 pm there is no line and you drive right through. I cant wait either.

538643,Guest,2004-04-05 11:39:00,0,We always stay at the super 8. You need to make a reservation now though they fill up every year. Oh and go have dinner at the 19th hole. You'll love it. If you don't eat the walleye go for the ribs.
538661,Brax,2004-04-06 14:33:00,52,"Where is the 19th hole? I love ribs and walleye, which do you think is better there? If your coming from Southern Wisconsin, stop at Mike's Smokehouse in Eau Claire. Hands down the best ribs I have ever had."
538662,Guest,2004-04-06 14:37:00,0,If your not eating Ribs in Kansas City ...you are eating inferior Ribs.
538668,Guest,2004-04-07 05:57:00,0,"To get to the 19th hole restaurant go north on hwy 53 and turn right on 4th St. Follow it about 5 miles its on the left off the highway. You'll see the sign. Oh and Mike in Kansas, I'm in St Joe just a short ride to the KC ribs."

538527,Guest,2004-03-30 10:51:00,0,"Why stay in I Falls? Cross the border in the evening and stay in Fort Francis. Next morning sleep in, eat breakfast and best of all you don't have to wait in line."
538528,Guest,2004-03-30 11:33:00,0,"airkiller1, Where in Fort Francis is a good place to stay. I like your idea...Thanks for the info."
538538,fishmaster,2004-03-30 17:11:00,209,Our group stays in Fort Frances and we stay at the La Place Rendez-vous. very nice place nice bar and good food. here is the web site and number for you.www.rendezvoushotel.com 1-800-544-9435 Hope this helps you out. Take the time and cross over and enjoy the evening you won't regret it.
538549,Guest,2004-03-30 23:29:00,0,Just for the reason stated above. cross the border the evening before and save the headache of waiting in that stupid line for a couple hours. before we cross though on friday when we get to international falls we have one last good meal at the holiday inn and then check in la place rendevvoux. good luck. make your reservations now though because they fill up fast. we usually make next years reservation when we are checking out the next morning. thats a year in advance.
