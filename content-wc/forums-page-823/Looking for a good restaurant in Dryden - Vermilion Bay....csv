538720,Hammerhead Herb,2004-04-09 10:28:00,259,"As usual, we are making our annual trek up to Ear Falls this year in prep for our flyout. We always stay at the Trillium and like it. However, since we take the one day to drive up from North Central IL , we end up in Ear Falls about 8:30 to 9PM and all the restaurants are closed. Therefore, we thought we should look for a dinner stop somewhere in the Dryden to Vermilion Bay area. Any suggestions for a place that will serve a decent meal? :9"
538722,Guest,2004-04-09 12:06:00,0,We like the restaurant on the north side of the road and on the west side before you turn to Ear Falls. There is a gas station and some little stores there also.
538728,Guest,2004-04-09 14:35:00,0,Keep going west on #17 past hwy 105 turnoff about a mile and the restaurant next to the last filling station on the southside of the road has decent food. I believe it's called Bratlands.
538734,Guest,2004-04-09 18:14:00,0,"Bratlands is out of business. Try the Travler across 17 from the ESSO station. I eat there, when I""m at my deer hunting camp which is just east of the Bay. Foods good!!"
538737,rebelrn2001,2004-04-09 19:11:00,1563,There is a McDonalds in Dryden. Great Food!!

538747,Guest,2004-04-10 22:15:00,0,"If you are looking for a nice restaurant my suggestion would be the Riverview Lodge in Dryden. It is located at 148 Earl Ave,(a couple of blocks south of the mill) they serve until 9:00 PM. They have steaks, seafood,ect."
538753,Guest,2004-04-11 13:50:00,0,"In Dryden, there's a pretty good restaurant, I believe it's called Kuypers(?), or something like that. I'm sure any gas station in Dryden can give you the correct name and directions. My family and I go there each year, when we're up there fishing. Just be careful with the french fries, they like to put brown gravy on them..lol"
538785,Guest,2004-04-12 19:45:00,0,I agree that Kuppers is very good but they used to close at 5:30 PM. Read in the Dryden paper that they changed hands so the closing time may now be different. I think the gravy must be an aquired taste thing.
538788,Guest,2004-04-12 21:16:00,0,Take the drive about 15 miles east of Dryden and eat at Huber's Lone Pine Resort(Wabigoon). Great German food. The chef comes in from Munich every summer.
