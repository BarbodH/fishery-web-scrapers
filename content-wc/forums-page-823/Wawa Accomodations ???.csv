Then would like to stay in Dryden - Eagle River, Ontario area the second night. Any recommendations for places to stay would be greatly appreciated. Cost is not a factor, taking the extra time, since I will be retiring prior to this trip."

It's clean, non-smoking and a short walk to the Cedarhof Restaurant which is, hands down, the best eatery in town. Congratulations on your retirement. One you get to the North Shore, The Captains Quarters in Terrace Bay (I think or it could be Schreiber) is a good B & B with a very nice restaurant on site."
