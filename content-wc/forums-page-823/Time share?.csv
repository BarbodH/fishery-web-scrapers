538696,Guest,2004-04-08 07:22:00,0,"I an actually in Singapore right now...we have plans to open the golf course, dockside and perhaps the cabins if the demand is there. Obviously, thier are still some wrinkles to sort out but I think we can get past most of them. How have you been? Getting ready for Spring I bet????"
538697,Reels,2004-04-08 08:33:00,2876,"Singapore, wow. Don't spit on the side walk.... Been out a few times this year already fished the IL RCL as a Co-Angler and fishing the Erie RCL in a few weeks. I will be up first week of June. Hopefully dockside will be open, but if not, will have the martini shaker just in case. Take care and travel safe. <{{}}><"
