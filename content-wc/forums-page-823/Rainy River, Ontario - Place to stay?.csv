I would like to fish the Ontario side of the river, and don't want to mess with the remote boarder pass. Not to mention, I always get an annual Ontario fishing license. This way I wouldn't have to buy a Minnesota license. So, my question is: Does anyone know of a place to stay on the Ontario side to fish the Rainy River? It could be east of Rainy River, Ontario, just somewhere in the general area. Thanks in advance, -John"

Nothing fancy, but there is a bar downstairs for 'intresting' albiet small town entertainment. The Emo Inn, which is about 40 miles east of Rainy, and is a more full service hotel, along with a bar and restaurant. Fort Frances is about an hours drive east of Rainy and has many hotels and motels, varying in prices and comfort. Plus in Fort Frances you can hook up with some great sturgeon fishing this time of year. Hope this was some help, good fishin'"
538663,FlyBoy,2004-04-06 16:08:00,631,"Thanks BassBlaster. Do you have a number for the motel in Rainy River? I drive through Emo all the time on my way to LOTW (Sioux Narrows), but I would like to stay closer to the river if possible. Thanks, -John"

538692,FlyBoy,2004-04-07 22:18:00,631,"Good info guys, I checked them map, I didn't really realize where Emo was in relation to Rainy River (Never paid attention I guess). Do a lot of walleyes run up to the Emo area? Aren't there rapids at Birchdale that the walleyes don't make it past? Sorry if I'm all wrong here (very possible) Thanks for the help! -John"
538709,Guest,2004-04-09 00:36:00,0,Don't forget about the Roadrunner Motel right in Rainy River. They have some newer rooms as well as the older section. The CN makes the roadrunner look like a Palace. They have some chester fried chicken there now too I think. Right on HWY 11 in the middle of your way through town.
