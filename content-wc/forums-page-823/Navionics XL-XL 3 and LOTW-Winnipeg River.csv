If so, how far north? To Minaki? To Sand & Whitedog? Further north and west? If so, how useful/accurate do you find the river information? For lakes in the general area of LOTW, like Dogtooth, Black Sturgeon, Crow (Kakagi) and Eagle, for example, while I believe there's no hydrographic coverage, is the shoreline detail/lake outline at least up to the same level of accuracy as the portions which cover LOTW? Thanks, (Don't wanna be) Lost"

I have not tried them but am seriously considering it. Take a look and see what you think.http://www.canadamapsales.com/"
