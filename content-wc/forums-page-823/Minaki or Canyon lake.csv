538821,Guest,2004-04-13 17:13:00,0,"My family and I stayed at Blythes Canyon Lake Lodge and it was the worse experience of our lives. The old man was a total jerk to everyone in the camp. His side kick of a wife was equally as bad. My kids went to go swimming during the 90 degree heat and the old man blew a gasket. We almost moved across the lake to stay in the other camp. Fishing wasn't all that good either. There were a lot of Muskie's biting but no walleye and very little bass. So if you don't mind a grouchy old man and woman and poor fishing then I guess you might like this place. Kodiak Oh yeah, watch out for the nails in the drive way as well as the beach."

538204,MrBor,2004-03-17 07:05:00,5,"I am late this year booking a trip. Want to get away from Lac Seul this year and find something different. My group is looking for mostly Walleye, and some Northern/Musky fun as well. Two places that still have openings for my group in August are Bayview Lodge in Minaki, and Blythes Canyon Lake Lodge. I am looking for any input on either lake and resort, as well as any other suggestions for a drive to housekeeping plan lake. Does Bayview have new owners? And is that good or bad? I stayed at Scout Lake Resort last year. The motors would die when backtrolling (all the time), the docks were an obstacle course, and the owner was about the most UN-friendly I have ever met."
538218,Reels,2004-03-17 16:47:00,2876,"I don't care for Bayview, and the owners are moody. I have not heard of them selling it. Try Barbers. Much much nicer place and less money. You can drive your car right up to the cabin, with Bayview, you have to boat all your stuff a 1/4 mile to the other side of the river. I have stayed at both for many years. I am not affiliated in any way.http://216.19.71.95/Barbers_Frame_Whole.htm <{{}}><"
538223,Guest,2004-03-17 21:39:00,0,Try Pakuni Lodge on Pakwash Lake. The lodge is located about 25 miles NW of Ear Falls. I was there the third week of July last year and had a blast on walleye and northern.

We always go housekeeping.I guess you could say Bryan is moody LOL.But if you want inexpensive and a dry roof over your head that's the place to go.We have never had any problem with things not working.If you are not a high maintainence group you'll do fine.We just fish all day and come in after dark, eat, sleep and do it over again the next day.We hardly ever see him or are bothered by him LOL.If you are a bunch of complainers or want a 5 star resort this isn't it."

538715,Guest,2004-04-09 08:25:00,0,"If you go to Minaki, stay at Barber's. Peter is very nice. Drive right to your cabin. Private dock. Good boats. Good cabins with full baths, kitchens, ceiling fans, and tv. However, I dont like the Winnipeg River, too much deep water. Be prepared to fish in a lot of 30' water. If you go to Canyon Lake, stay at Canada North Lodge. Very nice cabins."
538739,Guest,2004-04-09 21:40:00,0,"We stay at Birch Island Resort. Very nice lodging and equipment. I love the smallmouth fishing. We try some crappie also. The walleye is good, but not as much as Lac Suel. Plenty of musky. Pike everywhere. Don"
