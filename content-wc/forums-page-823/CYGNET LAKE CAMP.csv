Nice perch, some smallies and some big northerns once and awhile in Cygnet I caught many fish at Cygnet and had lots of fun there. New owners are good people but the prices got a little high and they are bringing in lots of campers. I understand the need to pay the bills but I liked the way Cygnet was not what it seems to have become. Our group has moved to a different place in Canada now and have stopped going there. You can access Swan Lake by paying a launch fee to an Indian family just north of Cygnet Lake Camp great smallies below the falls there. Swan lake is big and I fished only a small portion of it. If you go to Swan watch out for rocks!!!"

The road heads up to Whitedog First Nation and the dam that crosses the Winnipeg River System. I have never fished Cygnet during ""soft"" water season, only ice fished it so I can't really help you on anything particular. While you are up on that highway you will also be able to access Sword & Worth lakes. These also have some good fishing, but again I've never fished these during soft water. I would think that your best ""option"" would be to stay in Minaki, fish the Wpg River system & the five lakes - then if you want, make a day trip up to these lakes. They are not that far to drive to, anywheres from 20 - 35 mins. Thats what I would do.....if you need more detailed info, contact Duane @ Paradise Cove in Minaki. He would be able to give you way more info than what I could provide..... He does have a web site www.paradisecoveminaki.com or just do a search here on walleye central, they do have a link to his site. Hope this helps & have a GREAT trip ! Good Fishen Rob"

There is a good population of smallies if you look for them. The northern are like any other lake, you can catch some nice 30-38 inchers if you work at it. Overall I always enjoy the place since there is little pressure. On most weeks, the weekends are busy with campers but they are locals and generally clear out on monday. If you want more info let me know"
