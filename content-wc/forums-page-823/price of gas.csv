538489,Guest,2004-03-29 09:41:00,0,Is the future price of gasoline stopping anyone from going to canada this year or causing any rethinking about it?
538490,Guest,2004-03-29 10:16:00,0,"Gas won't hamper my trip. If you think about it, gas is up lets just say $.50. On a 1500 mile round-trip trip, the truck we use will probably get 20 miles to the gallon with a 18.5 gallon tank. That is probably 4 full tanks we'll use, plus probably 30 gallons of gas for the boat for the week. Thats about 104 gallons used in a week, and at $.50 per gallon extra, thats only $52.00 additional out of pocket expense (split between my bud and I = $26.00 per person). That won't keep me locked up at work for the week. Gas could triple in price, and I'd still be going fishing."

Just think about it a Guy will go into a bar and pay $2,50 for a 12oz. bottle of beer. Theres about 11- 12oz. beers in a gallon, that would cost you $27.50 not including tip, I think gas is pretty cheap at $2.00 a gallon. Just think of it as your boat and truck have a drinking problem that you support. You'll notice the better gas you feed your rigs the better they will perform. I enjoy good Beer my truck and boat enjoy good gas."

538508,fishmaster,2004-03-29 16:52:00,209,Think about it you pay $1 or $1.25 for a bottle of water when you stop for gas and you don't hesitate. Don't think many of us are going to let $1.75-$2.00 a gal stop us from taking our yearly trip to Canada.
538542,the_bronco,2004-03-30 17:59:00,86,"I can only spend one week a year in Canada, the other 51 I think about how I can hardly wait to get back there. No, the price of gas will not stop me from going. It could triple in price and I would still go. As pointed out by Wooglin, by the time it is all added up and then divided out, it just is not that big a factor in the over-all picture. However, after stating this it occurred to me that you may be on your own(I go with 8 to 9 other guys!), and driving a 4 M.P.G. mobile home?. That would ( and only for this, or a similar reason) cause me to maybe think of alternatives. Jim"
538546,fourize,2004-03-30 19:50:00,287,My Dad and I aren't going to let something like the price of gas stop us from going to Canada. 5 more months!!!
