538698,Guest,2004-04-08 08:50:00,0,I am looking for a motel a little north of Winnipeg on or near Highway 6 for a June trip. Several are listed in the Manitoba accomodations book. Is anyone familiar with either Rockwood Motel in Stonewall or Ericksdale Inn in Ericksdale? Any help or suggestions would be appreciated. I also need parking for 3 boats. Thanks

538708,Guest,2004-04-09 00:21:00,0,"I've had a few drinks at ""The Rock"" (lounge/bar at the Rockwood in Stonewall.) I would have to say it's a pretty scary place and I'm not exactly a little guy. Not sure how the hotel itself would be, but I don't ever plan to find out. Try the Daerwood Hotel in Selkirk or something in Gimli if that isn't too far. A lot of those little towns only have hotels so you can put in a beverage room and rake in Video Lottery Terminal dollars. Jazzy"

538725,Guest,2004-04-09 13:17:00,0,"Thanks! We will be on hwy 6, so Selkirk and Gimli are too far east."
538727,Guest,2004-04-09 13:42:00,0,there are several small town motels within an hour north of Winnipeg. Lundar and Ashern on right Hwy 6. Nothing fancy but a bed and some food in the vicinity.
538732,elbowlkmb,2004-04-09 17:20:00,7,"We have stayed several times in Ashern at the ""Sharptail Motor Inn"", the rooms are fine and the food is good. We have also stayed at the motel in St. Martins junction. Have a great trip."
538748,Guest,2004-04-11 06:55:00,0,The Sharptail sounds like what I am looking for. Is there room to park 3 boats in a relatively secure overnight environment?
538750,elbowlkmb,2004-04-11 10:07:00,7,"Hi Bill, There is usually plenty of good parking at the motel. We have parked up to four boats there without any problems. I would advise you to call ahead for reservations tho. to be assured of a room. Good luck."
538757,Guest,2004-04-11 19:05:00,0,"Thanks, I'm lined up!"
