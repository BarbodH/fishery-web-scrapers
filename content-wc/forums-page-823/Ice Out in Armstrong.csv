538744,AL,2004-04-10 16:15:00,89,Is the ice starting to melt in the Armstrong area? I've been watching the weather daily and its been above freezing for a few weeks now. Or are the weather sites off the mark like they tend to be in the US.
538766,Guest,2004-04-12 09:53:00,0,I'm in Thunder Bay and are lakes are getting pretty soft. I'd say ice will be out before end of April on lakes around Thunder Bay (2 hrs south of Armstrong).
