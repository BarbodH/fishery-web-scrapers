No guarantees though. Also if you are stopped this summer and have beer in the boat you might get off if you explain to the Officer that you are aware that Canadians get off this charge and want to be treated equally in the eyes of the law. I guarantee you'll get the Officers attention."
538657,Guest,2004-04-06 08:57:00,0,"Luv it. Between you and ""why"" some really excellent sarcasm. :) Good to see some folks can still pull a leg."
538602,Guest,2004-04-01 12:57:00,0,If im in my boat in my garage can I throw the cans on the floor and do I need to have a lure over the side of the boat. It is so tough to remember all the rules I just might stop drinking......nope I thought about ...cant stop.
538618,Guest,2004-04-03 05:42:00,0,"Can't understand why you would want to drink on the boat, i don't need you out there impaired.Why don't you get a whole bunch fishing patches put on your shirt and look like a pro and go sit in the bar and impress the people in there.Because guys like you don't impress me at all, You need to find another sport because your not representing this one worth a dam. Just my Thoughts"
538619,Guest,2004-04-03 06:26:00,0,"""Why"", you need to lighten up a little. The reason there are some unusual responses to this is because 1.) it is APril fools and 2.) because this topic has been butchered to death over the last couple of years and the ""regulars"" on here are a little amused at the regularity of this question which leads to some sarcastic humor. In argument with you, the beer is not the culprit, it's the one that is not responsible enough to only have one or two and becomes impaired while on the lake. No different than ""guns kill people"" comment. I enjoy a beer now and then but 1 per hour is my limit on the lake. I have never been impaired while fishing or boating but if I am responsible, I don't feel it is your job to tell me I shouldn't have any beer on the boat. If it is legal, go somewhere else to spout your tea-toddling holier than thow opinion. If you or anyone else thinks I am drunk, send the calvary! It won't ever happen because I am responsible to take care of myself."
538620,Ivy,2004-04-03 14:27:00,556,Hey how long was I out? Seems I have missed a few chances to chime in on my favorite rant. Darn this working all the time. Doh! Ivy C.E.O. of the Beer in the boat Gang a.k.a B.I.G.
538623,ankorklankor,2004-04-03 19:12:00,273,"Fishindog I agree with you ""Why"" appears to be wound a little tight. Maybe a couple of ""brewskies"" is what he needs. A responsible person can have a couple of beers in a boat while fishing and not become impared. Some of us enjoy the taste of a good beer once in a while, especially if it is one we brewed ourselves. I spent 20 years in the Navy where it was against the rules to have a beer on the ""boat"" so now that I am the Captain I'll have a beer when I feel like it. I will climb down off my soap box now. Thank you."
538625,Guest,2004-04-03 23:06:00,0,maybe someone can shed a little light on how this rule came to pass. It always takes a few idiots to ruin something for everyone else. I always think that death is gods way of removing the idiots before they hurt someone else. does seem to work to well though.
538626,ankorklankor,2004-04-04 06:03:00,273,"Probably the same way gun control was enacted in Canada. Someone got their shorts in a bunch over a personal incident, took on a personnel crusade and was a good salesman about it. The masses must suffer due to the actions of a few idiots. And you are correct, accidents are those events that occur to remove those from the food chain who should not be reproducing anyway."
538642,Guest,2004-04-05 09:42:00,0,It's only legal for Canadians. They have the right to do whatever they want. Americans and other foreigners have a different set of rules.
538647,Andre M,2004-04-05 15:32:00,86,It's not only legal it is mandatory for a Canadian to carry a 24 in the boat at the end of the day it should be empty.
538651,PJM,2004-04-05 23:11:00,3516,Canadian Guy I was waiting for your responce and I like it.

538566,Guest,2004-04-01 00:27:00,0,the short answer is NO. unless you are in a houseboat type boat moored to something. we have seen many boats pouring their beer into the lake while the dnr or police boat standsby.

538569,Guest,2004-04-01 05:18:00,0,In Quebec you cn drink beer in any boat as long as ou are not the driver and our boat is not moving. Remember that drinking while boating is not illegal in every states and provinces but is stupid in all of them

538570,bigfish1965,2004-04-01 06:46:00,3210,Not only is it legal...it is mandatory! Drink up or get out! That's the motto here! Have a good April 1st!

538594,Guest,2004-04-01 08:18:00,0,"Good one. Ever notice how many Canadians take these posts too seriously? There are so many rules, Perhaps because we must spend a great deal of time memorizing them all, the seriousness has become imperative."
538601,Guest,2004-04-01 12:31:00,0,"Yes, as long as the boat is on the trailer and the trailer is located within a legal location to consume and you are of legal drinking age. Inside your garage with the door closed would be an example."
