538660,McQ,2004-04-06 12:16:00,615,I'm going in to the Nemio River for the first time at the end of May. They are a new advertiser in the business directory and I look forward to a different perspective on the fishery at this location. Is anyone else making the trip to Northern Quebec this year?

I will be staying not far from you; so why not meeting on that occasion, if you're stay is in the same parameter as mind. Send-me a PM and we will arrange something. By the way I look to the directory and it's cool, Quebec outfitters are now contributing to WC! Looking forward meeting you. Good fishing!!"
