I have Auto Chart, not Live, on my Helix 7 and Auto Chart Pro on the PC for making my own maps. I have found it awesome for mapping the lake I fish because it doesn't have a contour map. I can't say that I've experienced any bugs, but maybe I just haven't realized it. TIA."
5400194,Woollybob,2017-03-15 19:42:00,158,The bugs are with autochart live. It stops mapping every mile or so and also does not show the old maps ahead of you - so you have to constantly keep one hand on the graoph and reset autochart live every minute or so while you run across the lake. Very annoying on a 30 mile run.
5400866,lawson2343,2017-03-16 06:14:00,459,Thanks for the info. That is terrible! If I had AC Live I'd be all over Hbird about that as I have long runs too! Can't believe they even released something like that. Makes me feel much better about just having AC and creating maps on my PC via AC Pro! That works all the time!
1664881,CamoHunter,2013-04-12 11:22:00,363,"Something worth mentioning. Navionics will soon be releasing (or maybe they already have) their SonarCharts program also. It will only work with Platinum Navionics cards, but essentially you will be able to upload sonar logs online, and a day or two later be able to download contour data from yours, and other peoples contributions as a separate layer on your map. Basically, you'll be able to start collecting data to generate contour maps for places that don't have very good data.Another idea I've had, is buying a software program called DrDepth. Same concept, you can import saved sonar logs and create your own lake contour maps. More than likely, I'll buy DrDepth soon. From the youtube videos and information I've seen, it looks like a nice program with some cool features."
1665041,revitup,2013-04-12 11:56:00,140,Dr. depth is in process of being sold. All sales at this time have been suspended. See information about this at Illinois Fish talk
1665385,CamoHunter,2013-04-12 13:02:00,363,Dang! Guess I should have bought it two weeks ago! Interested to see who bought it and what comes of it in the future.
5348449,adberg199,2017-02-21 22:51:00,1,"Hello rnnonmt, Can you recommend simple ways for preparing a good lake map? Thanks in advance."
5348633,bigwalleye1,2017-02-22 06:12:00,2632,"Just remember, Wooly, you draw less water on plane...."
5349913,David Anderson,2017-02-22 16:12:00,2073,"Regarding the Navionics, I have the ""North"" map and it certainly has Lac Seul on it, as well the Canada version does. As it has been stated, the depth is general and yes there are plenty of ""X's"" marking known hazards and although my experience is they are not all accurate, they are worth paying attention to and if there's an X assume it's a problem area. Secondly the maps do have what are known as Houseboat routes marked on most of the lake and will provide safe passage throughout most of the main areas of the lake if they are present. The third thing is that for the most part it is land/water boundary accurate so once you have the lay of your safe passage, you have an excellent view of the lay of the lake including islands, points, etc. You can certainly add danger waypoints to those areas where you are nervous and it is critical to create trails and save them. We motor in from Deception Bay landing to La Seul Outposts, a 37 mile run, and have trails marked from following the camp boats and a shared history of trails for safe passages. The Navionic map is invaluable for navigating. As others have stated, I just updated my units and chip for the SonarCharts Live feature (Only available with Navionics) and look forward to mapping some of my favorite fishing areas however the main map and trails will continue to be the basis for getting around."
5369546,Woollybob,2017-03-02 13:57:00,158,"Yes - you do draw less water, but when you see the depth number on its way up that fast you don't know where its going to stop... Always scary on the low-water years when you see new rocks sticking up that you wonder how you missed in years past. I spent a few years building my own maps: Logging depth readings on a Garmin handheld that was networked to my Lowrance depthfinder. Would get home and post-process the data to make lines/contours of anywhere we tracked. A lot of work, but yielded a few new spots to fish. Now I have AutoChart Live on a Humminbird Helix - Maps as you go. Spent one week on LS with it last year. Nice feature in theory, but still has quite a few bugs that I hope Humminbird will work out sometime soon. Have not been that impressed to-date."
5371106,prov1800,2017-03-03 09:13:00,5010,As far as the mapping on most units i think there all decent.if its showing you were you are andcwherecyour going great.i fished and learned lac suel in a 14 ft naden with a 15 hp mariner.no electronics and bad maps.best way i still think to learn a lake.i do now have a 10 year old hd8 with a chip thats just as old.dont need to look at it much as i know where everything is without it.i guide out of private boats without it.mind you i might need a few extra minutes to find some of those mid lake humps but i find them.but at least i know how to get back from some of those 25-30 mi trips if my unit ever quit.i think personally people depend on there electronics to much.nothing like using your own brain and slow down and look for stuff.there not going to save you from finding rocks.you have to find them and remember them just in case one day your unit goes down.and depending on water levels from year to year.hiting a rock with a 15 hp is a lit diff than a 150.
5385754,Lake Of The Woods,2017-03-09 16:00:00,124,PM me and I will send you detailed depth contour maps.
5395538,Aspencreek,2017-03-14 06:39:00,2911,"Others have given you good options on Lake chips, BUT, for the most point they all stink for lake contours and finding those routes to certain areas. Nothing beats experience and knowing for yourself. LS, unfortunately for many new to that water is NOT a bowl. There are submerged rock, reefs, humps, etc. etc. all over the place. Every year I see some unsuspecting soul cut between 2 islands or round a point to sharp, or generally think that if the are floating they are ""good to go"". TIP: mark your routes everytime you move, and just leave the thing on all day marking spots along the way, I wish I had done that starting a long time ago."
1647441,Guest,2013-04-08 06:16:00,0,Is there a chip for nw lac seul? thank you
1647777,ScottL,2013-04-08 08:00:00,733,"I believe the Navionics Canada chip is your only choice. I use it on the SE part of Lac Seul. It's not 1' contours, but it better than nothing."
1647881,rnnonmt,2013-04-08 08:20:00,992,I am assuming you want a map on an SD card for your FF right? If so Navionics is the only one I know of for Lac Seul and unfortunately I dont think its even surveyed in high detail. If you are just looking for a map of Lac Seul for a hand held GPS there are a couple options like Trakmaps. I have the trakmaps version of lac seul as a back up on my garmin colorado 300 if my FF were to stop working. I also have the navionics canada for Ipad. I think it was 15 bucks a year ago. Its not a bad option for when you are back at camp going over where you fished that day etc etc. I can send you some screen shots if you are interested of what the different map detail looks like.
1647913,Guest,2013-04-08 08:23:00,0,yes I want it for a lake map on fish finder
1648257,WalleyeWally28,2013-04-08 09:17:00,298,The Navionics North Edition (N) which covers the Upper Midwest also covers a few lakes in Canada including Lac Seul. I've used the HotMaps Premium Edition for several years but just noticed that Lac Seul is also listed under the Platinum Edition. Check it out on the Navionics web site.
1648505,cuamb,2013-04-08 10:13:00,203,I have the Navionics Canadian and the North chip. Both have Lac Seul on them.
1649041,SinOrSwim,2013-04-08 12:08:00,1528,"My Navionics North or Midwest includes Lac Seul and all hte midwest states. I think MorganMan may have tried to look at the newer version last year and it wasn't included so went ahead and got the Canada chip? I can't remember. But, it is definitely on the Canada chip. Not HD, like others have said but it does have many of the hidden rocks you need to stay away from marked. Gives a lot of peace of mind after you navigate through an area to be able to just buzz right through there on the return as long as you stay on your line. I periodically mark way points as I'm going so I know the same route the next year. I'd send you the fishing spots I have marked but they suck. LOL"
1652849,Woollybob,2013-04-09 11:40:00,158,"If you can find an old Navionics LOTW 2k chip, it has Lac Seul on it as well.All of these maps share one problem: They suck. They are similar to the MN DNR maps that are based on aerial imagery. They give you a rough idea of the 'lay of the land' but many times I have been screaming across ""80 feet deep"" water - according to the map - only to see my depth finder scream up to 3' and then back down again... High pucker factor.Having said all that, the maps do locate many of the hazards and show the recommended main travel routes, so they do serve some purpose. And to be honest, I like the adventure of finding those nice pieces of structure that are not on the map and making those my 'secret' spots. Nice reward for putting time in on the water."
1659665,Guest,2013-04-11 05:52:00,0,"I know a few of those spots that you will be flying by in 40 ft of water and the next thing you know its at two feet. must agree high pucker factor. I want to try fishing down around the narrows and and make my way to mckenzie bay . we stay around ear falls area and have fished the lake for 13 yrs now, Im like you I love to find those spots to call your own. and we putt around looking for new spots all the time. would like it for some of the marked danger spots I dont know about thank you"
