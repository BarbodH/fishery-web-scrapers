5440642,v-bay gord,2017-03-31 11:23:00,3168,Sorry Mike if you feel I jumped all over you. As I said it's been a pet peeve of mine for years and apparently you are the first opportunity I have had to vent. Got that off my chest. Thanks for being gracious.
5440658,prov1800,2017-03-31 11:33:00,5010,No respect
5440714,Mike Borger,2017-03-31 11:50:00,1554,"It's fine Gord, you made a valid point that I never even considered."
5440922,prov1800,2017-03-31 13:39:00,5010,I think most of us with a little age on us have made a few fires on the ice or on a shoreline to either cook something or warm up.that might even include you gord.i dont do it anymore and havnt for years as i thought there was a law against it.have gone outcwith friends that brought a stove along forcthat reason and then dumped ashes on shore.which wouls get washed into lake anyways with the thaw or rain.still see a lot of it going on in specific spots in the area.i personally cant see a problem with it.mike was on a guided trip and enjoyed his week and thatscwhat counts.if you dont like the fact therecwere fires on the ice call the outfitter and vent on him.id rathervsee a few burned logs than the garbage some parties leave behind.forest fires leave a lot of burned material in the lake to so dont think a few fires are that big of a problem.i havnt heard of anybody getting fined for that either but i could becwrong.
5441226,v-bay gord,2017-03-31 16:30:00,3168,"I don't have a problem with making fires on the shoreline.....that's where they should be. Ignorance of the law does not make it right. As far as the rest of your remarks, Mike posted the video so the comments were directed at him...I understand that it was not his initiative. There are a bunch of laws that the MNR enforce....this is one that they should.....but I'm pretty sure you are aware of others that they do......"
5441258,Shellback,2017-03-31 17:31:00,8083,"Another great video Mike, I enjoy them all. Looking forward to your adventures in the coming season."
5442082,prov1800,2017-04-01 08:53:00,5010,Dont we all.was made aware of one that i didnt know about.transporting live fish in your livewell.really didnt know that. you are supposed to drain the livewell when you pull the boat out.since i guide with my own boat at a number of different lakes that is a good thing to know.normally i carry ice in a cooler anyways.best way to keep fish fresh when the water is warmer.
5429946,Mike Borger,2017-03-27 20:44:00,1554,"Full story on the trip is forthcoming, but here's a highlight reel video of the entire trip from beginning to end.I was fooling around with a new camera that shoots in 4K, so the quality is pretty awesome if your monitor is capable of handling 4K.Not real thrilled with the fish eye aspect, I think I need to work on that.Nonetheless it's a pretty cool video. No huge fish but just incredible numbers all 3 days we fished. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HR70TEZKJ4"
5430282,prov1800,2017-03-28 06:11:00,5010,Cool video mike.looks like you had a great canadian experience.
5430634,Bstar,2017-03-28 08:12:00,564,Another nice video Mike.
5430994,pjshorthorn,2017-03-28 10:09:00,5654,Enjoyed the video Mike. It reminded me of my childhood days ice fishing with my Grandfather in central Wisconsin. The unknown factor was whether I could get to the tip up fast enough to actually land a fish... LOL. Those were fun days for me as a kid. I look forward to reading about more of your adventures this season. Tell your son that I look just like him when I put on sunscreen. It looks like I got slimed PjShorthorn
5431090,Mike Borger,2017-03-28 10:27:00,1554,"Thanks fellas!Thanks Pat, Bren was racing around from hole to hole pretty much non stop the entire time. Was pretty comical. I'll let him know he has a kindred spirit when it comes to sun screen."
5438114,adempsey2.0,2017-03-30 16:22:00,612,"Great video! All of my ice fishing videos may as well be a still frame photo, that's how exciting they've been. ;PNW Ontario would definitely make a nice winter trip. Hopefully one day."
5438242,v-bay gord,2017-03-30 17:25:00,3168,"An interesting video.....thanks for posting. I have to say though, that a pet peeve of mine has always been those that build fires right on the ice. I think the old saying of leaving it better than you found it applies to ice fishing as well. I'm glad the MNR feels the same way......http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/f...howtopic=50523By the way, I'm not bringing this up to stir the pot, but I think feedback such as this might be helpful going forward in future fishing productions."
5438410,Skywagon,2017-03-30 18:18:00,1106,"I agree 100% Gord! I hate to see all the junk/wood, a very few people leave behind on the ice. In my case it is usually some remote lake, which ticks me off even more....picked up a plastic juice bottle on the trail to a trout lake today. We live in one of the greatest places in the world, why would anybody want to trash it up?"
5438778,Mike Borger,2017-03-30 20:28:00,1554,"Well....I didn't light the fire, but I did enjoy it. I kinda see your point, but really, what's the problem with a few small chunks of wood floating around on a remote back lake once the ice breaks up?"
5439074,v-bay gord,2017-03-30 21:52:00,3168,"The problem is it shows no respect for the next person who may want to fish there. It shows no respect for the next person sledding by and hitting the few ""small chunks"" of wood buried beneath the next snow fall. It shows no respect for the majority of anglers who would make a fire on the shoreline, or who would haul a ""hot pot"" out to make a fire and then dispose of the residue properly. The other issue, from my experience, is that 90% of the times I see evidence of a fire on the ice, I also see peoples garbage.........beer caps in the fire residue, flagging tape on those willow branches, and pieces of trash. I don't want to travel dozens of miles over pristine wilderness conditions to fish next to someone's fire garbage.........someone who was too lazy to think about the next person. If you can't leave your fishing spot as clean as it was when you arrived then you don't deserve to be there in the first place........and you definitely don't deserve to promote such behavior on your video. Have some respect for the lake, the wilderness and the 16 inch trout you were killing. I'm I pissed? You bet..... You may not have made the fire, but your defense of it is lame.....especially from someone who apparently loves the wilderness and was passing along his passion to his son. I'm not impressed."
