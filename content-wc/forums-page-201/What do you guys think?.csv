5403658,pikeandtina,2017-03-17 08:07:00,145,"Mike, Awesome job! Is this going to be a syndicated fishing show? If so, I need the details. I've sent it out to several people already. I think this is the natural next progression for you. Would agree with what some of the others said about the audio, but otherwise"
5408810,Mike Borger,2017-03-20 05:16:00,1554,"Thanks for the kind words! It may be something I evolve into, but at least for now things are status quo."
5409218,fldoc1,2017-03-20 08:11:00,69,"Yes, some minor issues but well done. You have a passion for fishing so let it shine through. I liked the lure tips. I use the regular Doctor spoon but have not tried the weedless plus will try adding the skirt and grub. I was also interested in your laker baits. After watching this I am thinking of buying a go-pro camera. I am going to send my friends your site as some interesting video on familiar lakes. I have fished Whitewater some 30 years ago plus our group has fished St.Joe twice and were hoping to go there this year with Stjoeguy but date conflicts. I went to Whitewater in 1981 flying with Ferring Enterprises, staying on the east end at Whitewater Camp 2 which was near the Ogoki river outlet. Cost $235 for 4 days. At that time a new camp was being built where the river comes in at the western end of the lake. Randy from Duluth"
5409618,Mike Borger,2017-03-20 10:30:00,1554,"Thanks Randy! I think I fished with Bill Ferring as well years ago (think that's his name). Also remember paying $250 for a week long fly in trip many moons ago, times sure have changed eh?"

5295066,HeHooksHimself,2017-01-27 08:37:00,725,C'mon Pat. You get in trouble WHEN you go fishing. I checked with Gord and he had a story about his upgraded boat and something about yoga pants. Hooks
5295074,HeHooksHimself,2017-01-27 08:38:00,725,"Mike, your videos and reports make the winter pass. I love the new venture and I thought you did a great job. I wish I had your life, other than maybe the most recent awards..... Hooks"
5295130,pjshorthorn,2017-01-27 08:50:00,5654,"So what I hear you saying is that Mike and his crew would get in trouble fishing with me I've been known to dress a little differently on occasion and tear up a boat or two for the sake of a good time,but just to clarify.........I've never walked off the dock chasing Pokemon nor have I run out of gas on the lake Edit.....I normally tore up the boat before getting too far from the lodge so running out of gas just doesn't happen. Now the looks I have gotten from fellas about my attire ,willing to tow me back in ; that is a different conversation altogether. PjShorthorn"

5296306,pike50plus,2017-01-27 18:50:00,584,That would be a terrible insult!
5400210,walleye IA,2017-03-15 19:47:00,129,"Mike,Sorry I'm finally replying. I very much enjoy the video. I personally can't get enough of the ""how to"" stuff. You couldn't give me enough info about the fishing. I realize there are other parts of the trip you need to capture, but I watch for the North woods fishing.I think you should do a episode on one of your remote canoe trips. Just give it a thought anyway."

5402906,the_bronco,2017-03-16 19:11:00,86,Very nice...made me want to go fishing!

5294170,Mike Borger,2017-01-26 18:23:00,1554,"Okay, you want unpolished and silly, watch this LOL! Filmed last fall at Echoing Lake. (you need to crank the volume up to hear exactly what Chris is saying near the end. )https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk7fJVkdKtM"

5294330,ElectricSlide19,2017-01-26 20:29:00,147,"What type of mic are you using for the voice over? Just a suggestion, but you might wnt to look into using a mic specifically for voiceovers, that way you do not get an echo or sound like you are talking in a box. Also, I would suggest a wind cover if you do not have one for your camera and even then it can be tough with wind. Rode makes some good ones. Now a days, the things that separate good youtube videos from just ok ones is the audio. Everyone has great video, but the audio is key. I watch a ton of youtube videos, I definitely liked your story line and thought it had a good theme, shore up the audio and you will be good to go! Nice Job!"
5294346,Multispecies Guy,2017-01-26 20:35:00,447,"I really enjoyed the video but have to agree about the audio, especially early in the segment. I look forward to future videos."

Nice Job!I had a small boom mic on my DSLR for the voice overs. The guy in the boat with me filming was using some kind of high end camcorder with a gigantic fur covered boom mic. You're 100% right of course, and I agree with everything you said. Like I said, first attempt. Whether there's a second remains to be seen, but I'm hopeful!

5293594,Blackmacs,2017-01-26 11:42:00,2121,Very well done.
5293602,Bstar,2017-01-26 11:43:00,564,"I seen it the other day on FB. I thought it was pretty good for your first show. You seemed a little nervous in your narration which is very unlike your videos that you do for your reports. I'm sure you'll iron that out though. Heck it won't be long before you'll be saying stuff like ""Holy Buckets!"" like Babe Winkleman or ""Son!"" like Roland Martin! Maybe even sitting in a chair and quoting verses from the bible like Al Lindner! Lol! All kidding aside, good luck with it and I hope you do well with it."
5293634,MrSimon,2017-01-26 11:57:00,922,"Like I said on FB, it's great! The ONLY criticism (and it really isn't) is to encourage you to let your personality show. YouTube fishing shows are a dime a dozen ... they all have great production, huge fish, and amazing scenery. What sets the great ones apart from the good ones is the HOST. A fun and engaging host makes the show SOO much better, in my opinion. Also, polish isn't always good. Silly moments are more fun to watch. My absolute favorite YT fishing show is Uncut Angling. The dude has so much passion and it shows. He is incredibly entertaining to watch .... not to mention his 39 hour program was the best fishing-related content I've ever seen."
5293658,bthomas3333,2017-01-26 12:10:00,465,Excellent job! The production quality was right there with many of the 'name brand' shows. I thoroughly enjoyed the video!Brett

Honestly we did something like 50 takes for those stupid voice overs. I wasn't real happy with any of them but didn't have the will to keep trying for more. Believe it or not, it's not that easy!

I'm sure we stayed at the same hotel in Saskatoon and transferred planes in Stony Rapids. I appreciate the tip about the Doctor Spoons and dressing them up with the plastic skirt and twister tail. I'll file that one away for my next trip."
