5395882,The tank,2017-03-14 08:54:00,340,"I've seen a few 30"" walleye caught and weighed. I think that chart is pretty heavy. The most I've saw was 10.40 and the least was 9.68. Other than the one my oldest son caught when he was 9 years old it only weighed 3.15. I think it was dieing. But did measure 30.5 inches. Two last year I seen both a titch over 30 and one was 9.15 and the other was 10.01. I did see a 35"" that weighed 15.32 caught by Benatine creek. Nice but not over 17lbs like the chart says."

5398970,Crede,2017-03-15 10:25:00,134,"A long time ago my father told me that for Northwestern Ontario walleye: Under 25"" weight didn't matter. 25"" = 5 lb. 26"" = 6 lb. 27"" = 7 lb. 28"" = 8 lb. 29"" = 9 lb. 30"" = 10 lb. Reading this thread and considering the variability of walleye, I think this may actually be about as accurate as any other chart."
5399946,Lake Of The Woods,2017-03-15 17:15:00,124,"This chart is almost bang on for a Walleye my son caught on August 25,2009 at around seven forty five in the evening while casting a 10 inch black bucktail with silver blades fishing for Muskie off the point of an island in about 15 feet of water on LOTW.This fish measured 33 inches long with a 16 inch girth and weighed 15 pounds."
5399978,Lake Of The Woods,2017-03-15 17:24:00,124,"The one excerption to this that I know of are the size of the Shoal Lake Walleye in Northwestern Ontario.On average they are easily the same size as the Walleye that are caught in the Southwestern Ontario waters of Lake Erie.I think there is an exception to every source of data we may come across.I believe a record Walleye, Muskie, Pike, ect., could easily come many bodies of water situated in the south or north."
5389562,fsz,2017-03-11 17:09:00,144,"In my opinion the true measure of a trophy is the length. Weight varies seasonally to much. That said, if you take the girth of your fish in addition to length, you will get a more accurate estimate of its weight. Done quickly, this is not stressful for the release, in contrast to hanging a fish on a scale or boga grip (vertically) is sure to cause damage and stress. No doubt that available forage plays a role in how heavy a fish can get, and in many small waters forage is limited. But its not just the quantity of forage that makes a difference but also the quality. A lake with a good whitefish or cisco (especially dwarf cisco) population will produce big fish. These are high fat food sources. Some infertile lakes can produce huge fish, although they may not produce good numbers of fish so your chances of catching one are low. An example is erie vs ontario. Chances of getting a fish over 30 are better on erie, but inch for inch the ontario fish will weigh more (think alewives). You'd be surprised at the percentage of walleye in the great lakes that are truly over 30"". While fish from 30-31 are not uncommon, fish TRULY over 31 are quite rare."
5392138,prov1800,2017-03-12 17:20:00,5010,Fish weights will be different across the country.but normally in nw ontario by the time the walleye season opens most will have have had enough time to recuperate.although the weather still plays a big part in all this. early spawning is always better as far as fishing goes and will have fish much fatter then say on a late spawning.food sources are all diff in certain lakes.if there full of smelt you will find bigger and fatter fish than the ones that dont.
5395170,FuzzyIL,2017-03-13 19:59:00,906,"As a general rule in CN the 25 to 28 thinner fish are males. The thicker fish are the dollies. In the great lakes, males eat more. We once caught a 25 inch sauger on LS that I could have pushed through a paper towel tube it was so skinny. It tasted great!We had a mix fish fry of sauger, perch and walleye that night with our cabin neighbors that had a bad day on the water."

5395458,NWwalleye,2017-03-14 05:37:00,223,"HEY PEOPLE !!!! You got remember this as an average chart, not the "" Holy Grail"" of all fish weights.. lol There are many variables, that can factor into the weight of any fish .It is what I use as a reference and do consider the over all heath and appearance of the fish caught .. I find the age / length ratio helpful, when asked by client ""How old would this fish be ? """
5395466,NWwalleye,2017-03-14 05:41:00,223,"I see the chart I have has been doctored from this site to read North Western Ontario. lol Not Northern Ontario as in the link above ..Also here is the statement on the last line above the chart,,Quote *All figures and statements are a compilation from various scientific sources that have been significantly generalized. Numerous exceptions to this chart should be expected.*"
5395586,Mojo-NC,2017-03-14 07:06:00,1929,"Keep in mind that these weights are supposed to represent the 75th percentile of walleye. Any other disagreements or disputes will have to be taken up with Dr. Rob Neumann and In-Fisherman because I lifted the chart from one of their articles online. BTW, I think they are way to high too!Tight lines!"
5395850,pjshorthorn,2017-03-14 08:50:00,5654,"I believe the chart you posted is the same as the link from Thunder Bay's post which the exception of the aspects you mentioned. I think it is a pretty good estimator to get a person within the ballpark for weight and age. The outfitter we used on Red Lake in 2014 had a growth and age chart which very well may have been the same as the one posted. What I found to be most interesting was not the estimated weight of the fish, but moreso the age of the fish based on its length. I caught a 44"" northern on that trip and my son caught a 27.5"" walleye. The estimated age of the northern on the outfitter's chart was 23 years and the walleye was 24 years. I may have those ages reversed as I never wrote them down, but suffice it to say, the chart in this thread is pretty accurate on what we read at the lodge during that trip. If I want to know the weight of a fish, I still use the old length x girth X factor calculation to get a basic idea . Hardly ever hang a fish on a scale to get the weight. Just old school and stubborn I guess. PjShorthorn"
5373098,Mojo-NC,2017-03-04 06:49:00,1929,"I noticed over the years that the Canadian walleyes overall seem to be skinnier than their southern counterparts. Last trip up to Canada I started to make a chart of all length - weight measurements in half-inch increments. I was going to finish it during my next trip, but now I've lost it all because I dropped my phone in the lake. Has anyone else noticed this phenomenon as well? For instance, if you compare the Canadian walleye actual weights against the Northland Tackle size chart, all the Canadian walleye weights are lower. We go in late May or early June, so maybe it's a seasonal thing."
5373122,BornToFish,2017-03-04 07:04:00,1224,"Greetings,I paused on the original poster's suggestion that the weight vs. length correlation might be a seasonal thing. I've noticed ""seasonal"" relationships on the lakes that I routinely fish in NW Ontario. I don't weigh fish at all, but sometimes measure their length. I catch myself thinking ""hmhh, nice fish!"" from time to time.I sometimes fish during the opening weeks of the season in NW Ontario. The fish seem normal to me in terms of their length versus weight relationship. The fish are normally post-spawn in the early season.The majority of my fishing has been during August and September. I occasionally catch a walleye that seems skinny to me during this time of the year. I've ascribed these fish to being unhealthy for whatever reason.On the other hand, the majority of my walleye catches during the late season are what I consider to be hefty fish. It seems to me that the walleyes start putting on weight when they get around 17-18 inches. These fish can seriously bend a fishing rod.It would be interesting to see actual data for length versus weight for walleyes in NW Ontario. Other followers on this forum might have insights worth hearing.Thanks to the original poster for starting this thread.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5373218,Obabikon,2017-03-04 08:54:00,2370,"Walleye weights are constantly fluctuating. Different lakes have different food sources too. So, hi fat content on their primary food will create fatter walleye. However, seasons are probably a bigger reason for a higher or lower weight than expected."
5373242,bthomas3333,2017-03-04 09:07:00,465,Doesn't the sex of the fish play a role too. We also say the big fish are female so it seems to me that a 17in female might be a bigger heavy fish than a 17in male. I guess we need a biologist to comment.Also wonder if time of year might make a big difference. A 29 inch just spawned out female in May might look at lot different in Sept.B-
5374818,martinbns,2017-03-05 07:27:00,1520,"I used to fish the Ottawa River and our Sportsmans Club did quite a bit of work with the MNR. I remember being out in the shockboat with Biologist who told me the strain of Walleye in the Ottawa were very slow growing. I suspect lots of strains of the species, with everything under the sun being relevant to the length to weight ratio."
5374898,Pooch,2017-03-05 08:05:00,4618,"I think most, but not all Canadian walleye as they age can really get thin. We've caught a lot of twenty eight inch fish that I consider skinny and or just look old. Then last year on LS my partner put a 28.5"" walleye in the boat that looked and acted very young and I'm sure weighed much more than any 29+"" walleye I've ever boated in my years in Canada. Girth was just huge along it's entire body. I lost a very similar fish my wife had on earlier in the year on the other end of LS because I screwed up the net job. Very very nice fish and very athletic! Didn't understand the meaning of give up. Both largest fish last year acted like a northern when netted. Just went berserk.PoochDepends so much on the forage base."
5376946,Bill Krejca,2017-03-06 06:49:00,6107,"A stated, it seems to depend on the forage available for the body of water. Discounting the to-be-expected weight loss immediately after spawn, my observations have been that waters which are fertile, i.e., shallower, less clear water, with an abundance of incoming streams, seem to have fish which are, on the average fatter. Clearer. deeper waters, many times referred to as infertile waters, seem to have fish which may not be as fat, even somewhat skinny, by comparison. This does not mean all fish, sometimes the longer fish in infertile water can be quite fat. It also seems to matter in any body of water where the fish are located. My experience, and I know it may vary, has been a general observation that fish taken from mid lake rock piles, for example, may be more on the thin side, whereas weed taken fish seem to be fatter. As I understand it, crawfish, which usually are in rocks, do not have the amount of nutrients which minnows, et al ,have, so this, I think, may be the explanation. My thoughts above, I realize, are a generalization, and other folks may have deducted otherwise, it is just the way it seems to me. Bill"
5377210,Aspencreek,2017-03-06 08:20:00,2911,"The thing I have noticed, and done completely with no scientific data, is that without question the fish I catch in June/early july are skinnier that those in August. But I always assumed it was because of the long winter then spawning opposed to gorging on minnows, the the mayfly hatch, and the warmer temps. It just happens to be the opposite for myself, again no specific scientific data to back it up."
5377930,Mojo-NC,2017-03-06 12:05:00,1929,"Even though I love to fish for walleye, I'd have to say I'm primarily a bass fisherman. I practice C&R and typically measure the length, get a quick weight, and then pitch the fish back into the lake. I realize most walleye fishermen measure only length, but out of habit I still like to do both, which was the basis of my original question. My group has caught two 30"" walleyes, one was a pre-spawn fish and it weighed 9-6, nearly 2 pounds lower than the chart below. I caught a post-spawn 30"" walleye and although my scale wasn't working that year, I know it wasn't over 10 pounds either. In fact, I would have to say all of the fish we catch in Canada are significantly and consistently lower than the weights indicated in the chart shown below. Walleye Length To Weight Conversion Chart (75th percentile fish, copied from In-Fisherman Online, Dr. Rob Neumann, 2016) 12 in 0.62 lb 13 in 0.79 lb 14 in 1.01 lb 15 in 1.25 lb 16 in 1.54 lb 17 in 1.87 lb 18 in 2.24 lb 19 in 2.66 lb 20 in 3.13 lb 21 in 3.65 lb 22 in 4.24 lb 23 in 4.88 lb 24 in 5.59 lb 25 in 6.36 lb 26 in 7.20 lb 27 in 8.12 lb 28 in 9.12 lb 29 in 10.20 lb 30 in 11.36 lb 31 in 12.60 lb 32 in 13.94 lb 33 in 15.38 lb 34 in 16.91 lb"
