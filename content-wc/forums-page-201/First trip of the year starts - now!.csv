5397754,Mike Borger,2017-03-14 21:47:00,1554,"Well, my bags are packed and I'm leaving early in the morning with my son Brendan for Sioux Lookout.This year rather complain about winter I'm embracing it with an ice fishing trip to Sunset Country. It will be interesting to experience the fishery up there in the winter, my guess is I'll be spoiled now when it comes to ice fishing. The best part is the temps look like they're going to moderate a fair bit when we're there. (thank goodness!)Should make for a great story!"
5397810,Lake Of The Woods,2017-03-14 22:59:00,124,"I lived in Kenora for many years and spent many days ice fishing the LOTW and many smaller inland lakes.It is a blast and fishing should be very productive.However, if driving on the ice make sure you stay on the designated ice roads.My friends tell me that they had some very mild weather over the winter and the ice may not be as thick as it normally would be for this time of year. Had a friend put his 3/4 ton Ford through the ice and it sank to the bottom because he ventured off the ice road near Treaty Island in Kenora.All three passengers got out alive,...barely.In the spring he rented a barge and pulled it from the 50 feet of water and had it back on the road 3 weeks later.****,...I told him if it was a Dodge he could have drove it out of the lake to the landing, Watch out for those pesky ice ridges if travelling by snowmobile,...I hit one years ago on a bright sunny day and went for a 15 foot sail through the air,...the snow machine was a write off. Also went through the ice while hunting one winter.Was walking on a narrow slow flowing river that had over two feet of ice over it.What I didn't realize was that there was a Beaver dam that stretched the width of the river hence a weak spot with thin ice along the way.Good thing I was only about 4 feet from the bank which allowed me to reach it and escape.Biggest adrenaline rush I had ever experienced.It was -25 celsius that day and the water on my coveralls froze solid before it could leach through to my under layers which kept me warm enough to get back to my truck before hypothermia could set in. Anyways, have a safe and productive trip to the Sioux.Lot of good fishing to be had there."
