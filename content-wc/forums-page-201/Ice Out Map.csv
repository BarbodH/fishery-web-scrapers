If it keeps up at this pace iam guessing it will be gone at the end of april."
5436570,LOW1,2017-03-30 08:27:00,2828,Where in NW Ontario? Lot's of current and historical information on this site regarding the Lake of the Woods area of NW Ontario: https://icepatrol.wordpress.com/ My guess/estimate is that there would be a 5-10 day difference between what's happening on Lake of the Woods and what is happening with the ice on Red Lake. The satellite view that you can access would also help with your particular area.
5437114,DeBo,2017-03-30 10:48:00,211,Ice patrol is awesome to follow. modis has great images as well. Can only zoom to 250 miles though. Make sure you mess with the true color and false color settings. Usually have today's images up in the afternoon some time. Sucks waiting for cloudless days though. The far upper left corner of USA3 includes a pretty decent portion of NW Ontario and you can compare to MN.http://ge.ssec.wisc.edu/modis-today/
