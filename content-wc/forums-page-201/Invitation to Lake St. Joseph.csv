Two of the group I first met through Walleye Central, have fished with many times since, and have become good friends. (Yes, Jim, you're a good friend, too, but we didn't meet through Walleye Central our kids getting married took care of that introduction). Usually the group has a few other friends or neighbors mixed in, but life happens, schedules conflict, health changes and the group morphs with it. So four of us are going so far this year but six to eight would be comfortable. This is an invitation for any W/C guys interested in fishing Lake St. Joseph to join us. The trip will be Friday, 6/9/17, through Saturday, 6/17/17. As my name implies, I really enjoy Lake St. Joseph and have fished it for 16+ years. We fish primarily for walleyes but others target large northerns. (See Mike Borger's posts). Sorry, there are no bass, crappies or muskies. Lake St. Joseph has two camps on the NE end, this cabin 25 miles into the lake and a couple outpost fly-in cabins at the SW end of the lake. Regulations require single, barbless hooks and a special permit to fish that limits fishing pressure and has allowed Lake St. Joseph to be a premier walleye lake. The cabin, 25 miles from anyone else on the lake, has solar power, generator, full bath and kitchen, internet, sleeps 10, and is on a sheltered bay. It's a boat-in trip. We're bringing two of our own boats and camp boats are available. The cabin is booked all summer so this is a good opportunity to try St. Joe without putting together a group and waiting for an open week. The W/C group members are all St. Joe veterans, ranging from early 50's to 70, and a pretty easy going, low key group. There may be a non-W/C member or two added, also, as several friends have expressed an interest but haven't committed yet. Total cost will be roughly $1,300 each, not counting license and any new equipment or tackle that you just can't do without. Jigs and twister tails will do, however. Let me know if you have any questions, are interested in this trip or would like to be notified about future trips."

If I wasn't heading up to a lake NE of the Soo that same week with my wife and family, I'd be in contact with you. I know that St. Joe is a great fishery....and would be a memorable week with good guys.....kudo's to you and your friends for opening up your cabin and week so others can enjoy the St. Joe. Rich B"
5324185,wallydave,2017-02-09 20:26:00,2151,Hey guys and gals! This trip sure looks interesting! I would be signing up for this trip if I didn't already have plans! I hope this trip happens for some lucky fishermen!
5324377,forgop,2017-02-10 00:20:00,880,"Sounds like a great chance, but I can't pull off a 20 hour drive each way. Sucks cuz it's a rare week I have off in between classes."
5324497,Multispecies Guy,2017-02-10 05:29:00,447,Thanks for a very generous offer. Having two Ontario trips booked for this year eliminates me from considering it. Have a great trip.

Through the forum a W/C member and his uncle are joining us from Michigan and another W/C member from South Dakota will be joining our group. We're at 8 now and that's a good size, so our group is set. Thanks again, W/C."
