5428162,MrSimon,2017-03-27 09:37:00,922,"I've crossed at the SSM many many times. We generally cross into Canada just after dawn with zero wait time at the booth. We've never had an issue, a cranky officer, or a vehicle search. Ever. Coming back into the US we usually hit the border in early afternoon on a Friday or Saturday. We usually wait at least 30 minutes and sometimes an hour."

5428234,pjshorthorn,2017-03-27 10:05:00,5654,Yes sir. Very familiar with this website . It is very helpful when one is actually heading towards the border on their day of crossing. It is pretty accurate from my past experiences. Thanks for sharing. PjShorthorn
5428586,fishpoop,2017-03-27 11:06:00,630,I can't really add anything to the discussion because I've never been in the area but the mention of The Canadian Carver got me curious so I did a quick search and found their website. Looks interesting. I'm sure my wife would have loved this place if she was still alive. https://pancakebay.com/

You are in for a scenic treat and Lake Superior Provincial Park is a good choice of where to stop along the way.I do remember the water being quite chilly even in the middle of summer when swimming.I only had one bad experience crossing the border at Sault Ste. Marie from Canada into the USA.My son and I were making the trip to Windsor to visit family and we crossed the border at around 12AM one summer night.We were the only car at the crossing but ran into a real militant jar-head , who almost refused to let us through due to a very small chip from the corner of my birth Certificate that was missing and did not in any way, shape or form remove any vital information from what is required for proper identification.He tried REAL hard to piss me of to the point of saying something out of line to him which would result in refusal of entry and maybe even a strip search,...but I didn't bite and instead decided to set a good example for my son to follow if he should ever encounter a similar situation.I gave the Border Crossing Guard the ol',...Yes Sir!,... No Sir! routine that would satisfy his appetite for dominance and superiority and would save me that LONG trip around Lake Huron and through Toronto on my way to Windsor.So, just be prepared with all proper documentation because you never know what type of border guard you will have to deal with."

He said, "" There ain't no way in $)$&@ that I'm going anywhere near 75 through Detroit. ....LOL. We will be taking 23 up to Flint and then pick up 75 there. This way we can stop in Ann Arbor and pee on the Big House too . PjShorthorn"
5422394,pjshorthorn,2017-03-25 04:47:00,5654,"I know, right? The problem is that a fella may never make it to the Soo on Friday with that kind of stop!!!! Made it to this location shortly after it had opened up. It was definitely a nice store. I'll be pushing to leave early enough where the store isn't open yet when we blow by it ...LOL. PjShorthorn"
5422434,Shellback,2017-03-25 05:23:00,8083,"Two years ago I made the trip to Chapleau through Wawa coming from S.E. PA. Friggen traffic was nuts! Didn't affect me, but huge back up I-75 heading north on my return home on Friday. This year I'm heading due north and crossing at the Thousand Islands and snaking my way up to 17 around Petawawa. Mapquest actually shows it's about the same distance and time."
5422578,Overwatchmike,2017-03-25 06:41:00,201,"Guys, after doing the trip for 18 years now from eastern Ohio trust me when I tell you to pick up 23 off the turnpike!Sent from my SM-G920V using Tapatalk"
5423514,kzoofisher,2017-03-25 14:10:00,5144,"When I lived on the east side I hated 75 for northern trips. Many a good weekend was ruined by the awful traffic on the way home. Sometimes we would stay way late on Sunday just to drive back in the quiet times. East siders seem to think since they make the cars they can break 'em all, too."
5424114,Live to jig,2017-03-25 20:28:00,159,"Mike you are correct about 23, we then take 96 to 127 all the way back to 75. NO traffic! Plus we stop at Jays in Clare every year, better and different gear that Cabela's or BP"
5424226,pjshorthorn,2017-03-25 23:59:00,5654,You guys are killing me !!!! Now I have to consider stopping at Jay's for a couple of trinkets on the way up. PjShorthorn
5426698,pike50plus,2017-03-26 18:44:00,584,went in early on Friday am to finish drive to Nakina and came back through SS late Sat night

5421994,Live to jig,2017-03-24 19:02:00,159,"We cross every year on Friday about 11am, and may see a 20 minute wait but it looks like they are opening more lanes for a total of maybe 5/6 . You must pull into the scenic over look on Agawa Bay, easy to miss but oh what a view. Only a small sign on right side of road, with a drive on the right that goes up. Stop a Wawa for some great poutine at the Chip Shack just past Tim Hortons on the right.....it's our favorite tradition."
5422018,pjshorthorn,2017-03-24 19:14:00,5654,Got it !!! PjShorthorn
5422034,pjshorthorn,2017-03-24 19:18:00,5654,Thanks for the tip on the Agawa Bay pull off. That is an awesome view. We are staying in Wawa Friday night so we will see how the group feels about Poutine for dinner PjShorthorn
5422050,Live to jig,2017-03-24 19:22:00,159,I'm glad you didn't ask about coming back on Saturday into the US.....we hit it around 2/3pm...up to a hour!
5422074,pjshorthorn,2017-03-24 19:36:00,5654,"We have a pretty good pull from Vermilion Bay back to Wawa on Satuday when heading home so we are going to stay in Wawa and cross early Sunday morning .....so I hope it will be pretty quick then. I remember those long waits crossing both ways at I Falls on Saturdays. I'm not in a big hurry this trip,but I do like to keep moving. PjShorthorn"
5422138,jigger47,2017-03-24 20:18:00,39,Another vote for old woman's bay.
5422266,kzoofisher,2017-03-24 21:27:00,5144,Maybe you already take this route but jump from 75 to US23 at Maumee and avoid a ton of bad traffic. I generally hit the Soo somewhere between 5 and 7PM on Friday and never wait long.
5422282,Rich B,2017-03-24 22:04:00,1081,"AND you will drive right by Cabela's at Dundee, Michigan on US23 which is worth a stop....it is a larger Cabela's store and worth a quick stop. Safe travels, Rich B"
5419506,pjshorthorn,2017-03-24 05:47:00,5654,"This year I will be taking a new route over to Vermilion Bay Lodge on Eagle Lake and will be crossing at Sault St. Marie. Just curious what the crossing is like in terms of general times, number of lanes, etc. We will most likely cross about mid afternoon on a Friday so I don't suspect it to be too busy, but thought I would check and see what other's experiences have been. Also, has anyone spent time exploring the provincial park on the shores of Lake Superior ? The park would be just south of Wawa. We may have some time available to explore Friday afternoon. Thanks for the input. PjShorthorn"
5419570,Juls,2017-03-24 06:07:00,13414,"When we go up...we cross at 4 in the morning and we are the only vehicle there, usually. On the way home...it takes a bit longer, but it's still pretty quick. I'm not sure of how many lanes there are, but there's at least 4."
5419626,prov1800,2017-03-24 06:23:00,5010,My wife and i are planning a trip to pelee island in mid may.leaving from vermilion bay and planning to drive through international falls toward makinaw and then cross into can from detroit.anybody driven that route.
5419706,Overwatchmike,2017-03-24 06:33:00,201,"As of October last year they were still working on tearing down the old building. The new building has 6 lanes which should help with traffic flow. The real problem is that you cross a 2 lane bridge before coming to the 6 border patrol officer's. Friday afternoon will be busy! I normally cross at 6 in the morning but have done the afternoon thing before.Once out of the Soo you'll be following Superior and there are a ton of beaches / pull offs to explore. You have to stop at the Canadian Carver! It is a huge gift shop with all kinds of native crafted things.Also, mental note..... Once you leave the Soo there are no stores, food joints, or gas stations until you get to Wawa besides Canadian Carver.Sent from my SM-G920V using Tapatalk"
5419954,onetimedave,2017-03-24 07:35:00,502,SECOND that on stopping at the Canadian Carver. They have what ever you need even if it is nothing. About 40 miles North of the SOO.
5420210,Crede,2017-03-24 09:16:00,134,We have crossed at SSM several times on Friday early morning thru mid-afternoon. Have never waited more than 5-10 minutes.
5420330,alberta bum,2017-03-24 09:34:00,312,"I would look at your route thru Michigan. I-75 on the south side of Detroit is shut down for 2 years, too repair replace the bridge over the rouge river.. from what I hear it's a real cluster getting around that area.. and not really the safest area. Pro-V let me know when you plan on being on the island.. that should be really really good walleye fishing around that island right about then."
5420498,prov1800,2017-03-24 09:56:00,5010,Ill find out.i have friends in windsor that say its not very good as all walleyes up up the detroit river.but i never go anywhere without a few rods.lol.i have invites to fish the river si ill see.mainly going to tour island and look at some birds.
5420618,Guest,2017-03-24 10:23:00,0,"I have done the Sault to Wawa many many times, Canadian Carver great place to stop , however it is closed in the winter , so don't necessarily count on it for gas in march or april . After that the highway starts getting to be great scenary and high hills and various pull offs, Don't waste your time on the "" Agawa native hieroglyphics at top of Agawa river hill , it is long way in after you drive a ways to park , all to look at some red ink on a rock........ by far the best five minute stop is OLD Woman bay which is maybe 20 miles before Wawa . Nice sand beach but HUGE cliff on left side for spectacular pictures , and usually good waves. You will have come down a long long straight hill and bottom will be sign to turn to left for Old Womans bay park picnic area."
5420970,Bstar,2017-03-24 12:24:00,564,Ditto on the Carver and Old Woman Bay. Spectacular scenery along that stretch of highway.
