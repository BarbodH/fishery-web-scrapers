5418314,Golden Eagle,2017-03-23 13:25:00,2642,Will I be seeing lawn chair prints at the Bug River bridge on my way to Red Lake May 16? Maybe a few cigar ashes in the sand?
5420954,gullrockguy,2017-03-24 12:20:00,44,"you may see the lawn chair prints but not the cigar ashes, i quit that 4 yrs ago. now i have copd and dr. tells me smoking is to blame, i blame my asthma."
5392194,Moondog,2017-03-12 17:37:00,362,Does anyone know if the cell tower at Gullrock supports AT&T? I know that Verizon works well but thinking of switching.
5392362,gullrockguy,2017-03-12 19:09:00,44,"don't know moondog, maybe the guys who are on the board who stay at the gullrock camps can help out here"
5394906,gullrockguy,2017-03-13 18:27:00,44,"Moondog, i checked with my neighbour Greg, you know him, and he said he has always had verizon when up here but he buys a Canadian package when he heads up, for the internet he uses Rogers (canadian provider available through thunderbay tel ) . hope this helps, weather is getting warmer -5 today. see you in a couple months"
5395002,Tonyo,2017-03-13 19:02:00,212,I have AT&T and unfortunately it works just fine. I would rather not worry about it but it does work and works pretty darn good. TonyO
5401554,Moondog,2017-03-16 09:27:00,362,"Yes, I know Greg. We use Verizon too without difficulty but I was going to try to get a better deal from a different carrier. I guess we will stick with what we got. Tackleman did you change your Title to Gull rock Guy?"
5402514,gullrockguy,2017-03-16 15:11:00,44,"yup, i had to change my name because when the walleye central folks made us get different passwords, i couldn't remember mine and i had to re-register."
5404050,The tank,2017-03-17 10:06:00,340,I had the same problem. Had to change everything. Couldn't remember my password. I don't know about at&t but us cellular worked better than my verizon phone did. I even have the canadian plan on my verizon phone.
5413330,Moondog,2017-03-21 15:05:00,362,What's your ice prediction???
5415746,gullrockguy,2017-03-22 12:18:00,44,"was on the ice a couple days ago talking to the neighbours who were ice fishing beside the house and there was about 3 feet of ice, it is just starting to warm up (last night it was -18) so i am leaning toward 2nd week of May possibly a week earlier, i guess it depends on how hot it gets and how much rain we get between now and then."
5418194,Moondog,2017-03-23 12:29:00,362,Wow.......guess this won't be an early ice out year. Stay warm!
