1289386,phishfearme,2011-03-31 19:55:00,1242,"we fished evans lake where the teodat river flows into it - out of the lakes you're talking about. right where the flowage is was very good - but one thing you should recognize in these ""james bay lowlands"" lakes is that they are shallow, flat bottomed, featureless and can get stirred up during windy times such that fishing can literally shut down - especially for the large pike that this region is noted for. the evans lake bay where the teodat rivers flows into was never deeper than 3ft and we thought our sounder was broken - but putting a paddle into the lake confirmed the 3ft depth - for miles and miles. otherwise this region should produce a good trip for you - but i always found them very expensive and you typically have to have a ""camp manager"" who's main role is, as far as i can determines, to drink your beer and eat your food (welcome to quebec) as long as you know what you're getting into. phish"
1289610,psherbo,2011-04-01 11:15:00,13,Thanks for the info. How do you get to lake Evans? Drive or fly and by what route? Thanks
1291534,phishfearme,2011-04-06 08:37:00,1242,"we drove to metagami and flew from there - one of the most expensive trips we've ever done. walleye fishing was mediocre but we went for trophy pike and all of us caught one over 36"" up to 42"". we just didn't like the featureless, shallow, mud bottom of these lakes (kesagami in ontario is the same) - we just prefer the schield lakes with tons of structure and i think better walleye fishing. personal preference though - some people love these lakes. phish"

I just returned from five days on the lake in mid-August, 2012. Only myself and a relative were there the entire time--we had the lake to ourselves and during the five days caught a total of 691 fish, including 41 Pike and 650 Walleye. Just fantastic."
1490808,psherbo,2012-09-27 13:15:00,13,"WV fish,Thanks for the info. Made it to Theodat this year and had a great trip. stayed with Abel Kitchen rather than put up our tents. The fishing was very good also. We wanted to make a side trip to Legoff and Tesacau but it didnt materialize. Thanks, psherbo"

1902066,brochet,2013-06-27 08:34:00,88,planning a trip to legroff..how is the road from teodath to legroff?how big were the pike?
5104721,Guest,2016-09-09 13:48:00,0,the road from theodat to legoff is nearly impassible;
5442834,Guest,2017-04-01 18:56:00,0,"fished legoff in 2016 road from theodat to legoff is horrible (only 12 miles) and you risk getting stuck on boulders/and or ruts in many areas at launch point at legoff, unfortunately, it now looks like a garbage dump; local cree have no respect for environment or the fishery have observed them take hundreds of fish back to waswanipi in a few days had gas/food items stolen while out fishing they stay up and party/drink all night long sad will never go back"
