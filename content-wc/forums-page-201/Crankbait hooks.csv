I prefer to cast or troll and am thinking of removing at least one treble from my Husky Jerks and similar baits for an upcoming fly-in trip. I already crimp the barbs, but 3 trebles seem excessive. If I take off hooks, does it matter which are gone? I may even take off the front two trebles but I don't want to affect the action."

First, I suggest having all treble hooks on your lures when you depart on your trip. Then, when you are in the cabin or boat, try removing one hook at a time and set it aside as a spare. You might just need a spare hook should you have to cut a hook.Second, I suggest starting your experiment by removing the middle hook. I often find that predators attack the head of my lures (i.e. front hook) when there is an aggressive bite. Conversely, predators often overtake the lure from behind and get hooked on the rear hook when the bite is more passive.Bottom line is that I would remove hooks in the boat rather than at home.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5438946,wallydave,2017-03-30 21:27:00,2151,Removing the front treble hook makes for easier fish handling! Lake St Joseph calls for single barbless hooks. It's just easier for both fish and fisherman to remove the extra hook!
