5441282,That Minnesota guy,2017-03-31 17:36:00,8293,Never fished Red Gut but have heard guys fish Muskie up there.
5441650,Baseline,2017-03-31 21:16:00,3207,I take trips to Red Gut a couple times a year. When are you planning your trip?
5441922,Rapripper,2017-04-01 07:13:00,5,Probably not until July
5442506,Baseline,2017-04-01 15:01:00,3207,"I've don't think much of Red Gut for mid summer fishing. I like the end of May when the walleyes are streaming out of the spewing areas which are all restricted. We fish the pinch points leading out of Porters Inlet, Crooked Narrows, Red Pine. We also find lots of walleyes in the big bays adjacent to these spots. Crappie action is very good. I also like late fall fishing some of the reefs for walleyes and crappies. I've never fished for Musky in Red Gut or Rainy for that matter. I know the M's are there, but there isn't much fishing pressure on them. If you want to try another area of Rainy go to the US side. The big reef complexes on Seine and South Bays are on fire in late July and early August. The only downside of the US side is that wind can be a factor."

5443658,Rapripper,2017-04-02 07:52:00,5,Is it a fairly featureless part of the lake compared to the north or south arm?
