When I was a kid in the fifties, we had an older neighbor who was a muskie fisherman. One day he opened the cavernous trunk of his 98 Olds and showed me the huge muskie that seemed to go from fender to fender that he had caught and was soon to go to the taxidermist. He pointed out the .22 bullet hole in the head of the fish, which was a standard practice of the day to safely boat such a fish that was to be kept. Of course, that was a different time. andersaki"
5391322,Nimstug,2017-03-12 13:11:00,2605,I wonder how many of those old boats had bullet holes in them....
5391346,andersaki,2017-03-12 13:15:00,1426,"I think that most of the shooting was done over the side of the boat. Them that shoot on board, well......... I guess that they would be up for the Darwin award. andersaki"
5391986,pan-man,2017-03-12 16:04:00,299,"Anything under 18"" flipped. Most bigger fish reach under belly and bring in or just unhook while in water. Net comes out maybe 2 times a day."
5392954,stumcfar,2017-03-13 07:37:00,451,"We flip pretty much everything 16"" and less. On Lac Seul, somebody would be constantly on the net if you netted everything. All pike get netted, but what a hassle as they wrap themselves in the net a dozen times!"
5393074,Bakefish,2017-03-13 08:24:00,1077,Lot's of followers met their demise that way withouth ever tasting the hook.
5394602,Aspencreek,2017-03-13 16:37:00,2911,"Interesting thread, we net everything except Northerns and Muskies. They are not allowed in the boat, unless I intend on keeping a Northern for a special recipe. But I switched my net to a large mouth rubber several years ago and the fish rarely get ""spunky"" and no hook tangles etc. We only keep what we are going to eat, so if I'm going to release them I want it done with as little stress as possible to the fish."
5394898,Bfgilly,2017-03-13 18:25:00,18,"I used it flip most walleyes under 18"" in the boat until I broke a rod doing so. I now use Boga grips on most of the fish & it works really well (it also saves your hands from getting cut). Pike never see the bottom of the boat."
5395122,FuzzyIL,2017-03-13 19:42:00,906,"Yes, we 'flip'.We also call for the net when it's needed too. I use 4lb Ande mono with 5' 10"" IMX graphite. She uses 6lb berkley mono with a gary roach walleye 6 foot rod. Never broken a rod, never broken a tip, never broken the line. Stop being a *****."
5395138,FuzzyIL,2017-03-13 19:47:00,906,"Plus flipping is much better for releasing walleyes. No net mess up. No banging on the bottom of the boat. No lost slime. Flip in, grab the fish, Un hook and release it."
5389914,BornToFish,2017-03-11 20:00:00,1224,"Greetings,I watched an episode of ""Sportsman's Notebook"" on the television today. They were fishing for walleyes on Lac Seul. I noticed they frequently were ""flipping"" walleyes into the boat. By this, I mean they were bringing their walleyes into the boat with their fishing rods, rather than netting or ""hoisting"" the fish. Watching this episode caused me to think about how I bring my fish into the boat.I rarely ever ""flip"" a walleye into the boat anymore, having once broken the tip off a very expensive spinning rod in this somewhat daring maneuver. I sometimes ""hoist"" a walleye into the boat by grasping the leader and lifting the fish into the boat. I almost always net my fish. My wife does the same.How do you bring your fish into the boat to be unhooked?Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5389922,That Minnesota guy,2017-03-11 20:11:00,8293,When I was younger I fished for Bass. About anything under 3 lbs. we flipped in the boat. Hammer handle Pike we also flipped in. As I've gotten older I have realized it's healthier for the fish to net them and bring them in. In many cases I leave the net in the water and release the fish in the net. This is especially true with Pike. About the last thing I want is for a Pike to flop around on the carpet and loose some if it's protective slim coat.
5390226,BornToFish,2017-03-12 05:53:00,1224,"Greetings,Thanks to Minnesota guy. You raised an interesting point. My comments for the original post assumed the fish were to be brought into the boat. Bigger pike and muskies are almost always left in the net for hook removal. They seem calmer in the water than when brought into the boat. I only bring these fish into the boat if we are to take a picture or measure length.I believe that if anything were to happen bringing an angry fish + hooks into the boat, it most likely won't be good for the fish, me and everything else in the boat.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5390658,GWC,2017-03-12 08:35:00,1021,Don't recommend it. Had too many hooks come loose. It's just too easy for that hook to end up in someone's body. What a way to spoil a day on the water. I always use a net these days.
5390698,packpro,2017-03-12 08:43:00,695,"Eater Walleye (17"" and below) get the flip. Anything larger gets netted. Not to brag, but on some of our portages to remote lakes the fishing is just that good....Netting would be a hassle. Also on the portage lakes the boats are smaller. Does take much to get them over the lower sides of those boats. We also use heavier line on those trips."
5390738,prov1800,2017-03-12 08:52:00,5010,"Like backpack said.smaller eater fish can be flipped in or reach down over the boat and grab them or run your fingers down to jig and bring them in.pulling out the net a 100 times a day gets annoying.ive brougjt up some 20""+ fish when i get lazy.have never broke any rods doing that but should be aware of the jig coming out and either getting you hooked or hitting you."
5390898,Obabikon,2017-03-12 09:49:00,2370,"I'm a flipper also. I try to take good care of the fish. If it isn't a keeper, I flip over the top of the water (so if it comes off, it doesn't hit the boat)"
5391034,Multispecies Guy,2017-03-12 10:36:00,447,Small fish flipped. Bigger fish netted. I've found small northerns to be the most dangerous. They always seem to thrash when my hand is about 2 inches away from grabbing them.
5391218,Baseline,2017-03-12 12:19:00,3207,I flip fish under approximately 16 inches. I reach down to the water level and grab most any walleye bigger. About the only time a net comes out is for landing big walleyes 28 plus.
5391242,Bill Krejca,2017-03-12 12:26:00,6107,"Small pike do seem to be among the most dangerous. Once, within 20 minutes of each other, I took hooks out of two friends hands, both hooked while trying to release small pike. I agree with previous comments re: release in the water for large fish - they just seem to be less reactive while in the water. Bill"
