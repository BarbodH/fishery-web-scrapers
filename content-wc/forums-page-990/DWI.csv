515757,Guest,2001-12-19 20:23:00,0,I have been reading a few posts about having a DWI on your driving record and coming to Canada. I am doing a fly-in tis summer with a large group. Have no idea if any of the guys going have a DWI. Is it just the owner of the vehicle or anyone on the trip? Information will be appreciated. Thanks
