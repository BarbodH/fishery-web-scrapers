I was at this lodge last year and had good luck, we caught tons of walleyes 0-3 lbs. , but only about 10 or so in the 3 to 7 lb. range and none larger. We also only caught 1 northern over 10 lbs(2 fisherman). As this is only my 2nd trip to this lake I have limited knowledge of this lake. Any tips on how or where to catch some bigger fish? I have some good maps, and I am learning to use a GPS. Thanks in advance, Jeff."

Lac Seul is so big and the are more than enough fish for everyone. Just hangout at the fish house and ask questions. If it's only two of you, ask to tag along behind. You might learn more than where the fish are."

Is this the week you'll be there? I've fished Lac Suel for the past 10 years straight. It's a fantastic lake. I'll be in the ""big"" cabin straight up from the dock. I'll be in the gray and black Lund 1775 Pro-V. e-mail me at <[email protected]> for more info. Ron"
