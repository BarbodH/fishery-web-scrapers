The river can be challenging, sometimes hard to find the fish. Maybe I should hit the smaller lakes. Any suggestions or info would be greatly appreciated."

On real calm evenings the Cisco'sWill come up and dimple on the surface, guess who's just under them?Lot's of big Northern to.We also fish the Smallmouth and of course Musky.Two years ago Moby Dick undid me.I really understood the Musky Bug then. Ouch!"
