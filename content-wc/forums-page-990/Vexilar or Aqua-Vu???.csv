In my opinion that will that takes the sport out of fishing and and can leed to over harvesting mainly in pan fishing. When you use a depth finder at least you have to use your head. I have drilled alot of holes to find fish when ice fishing to mark a flat and I use an FL-8 and they are nice, but the big thing there is if I mark fish I don't know what there are until they come up. It's like a hunting dog, you want him to use his nose to find the bird and not his eyes. Buy an FL-8 because trying to find the edge of a flat with a camera might take you a while because you have to drop it all the way down. The FL-8 you just drill the hole check the depth or sometimes you don't even have to drill a hole just put in on the ice."
