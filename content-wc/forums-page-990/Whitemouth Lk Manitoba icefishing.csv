515725,River_eye,2001-12-23 16:59:00,1486,"I have no idea whether people have been out there yet. I do believe that the ice would be safe for snowmobiles and 4-wheelers, but I would not trust it for driving my vehicle out there, it's been a little to warm this fall."
515726,Guest,2001-12-24 07:26:00,0,Are there any fish left in the lake?
515727,River_eye,2001-12-24 16:24:00,1486,"I've only fished there a couple times, just to try it, we didn't do very good at all, but the conservation officer stopped by and said that some guys were doing pretty good on a different part of the lake. Guess you just have to know where to go."
