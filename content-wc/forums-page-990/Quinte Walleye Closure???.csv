For more information tune into Toronto's Fan 590 tomorrow morning (Saturday, Oct. 27) at 8:00 am and listen to Angelo & Reno Viola on the Barklays Outdoor Journal Radio Hour. They will have a guest on the program that attended the meeting. This should be both informative and a great opportunity to phone in and speak your mind."

515338,Guest,2001-10-29 11:54:00,0,"DISCUSSIONS UNDER WAY ON THE BAY OF QUINTE WALLEYE FISHERYThis article was taken from www.Thefishingnews.com. It seems that the Bay will be closed starting this winter for 3 years.PETERBOROUGH - The Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) has begun talks on the status of the walleye fishery in the Bay of Quinte. An initial meeting has been held with a small group of anglers, members of the tourism industry and commercial fishers and discussions will continue with interested stakeholders. MNR is also in the process of initiating discussions with the Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte. The talks will include whether to close the Bay of Quinte to all walleye fishing. ""The protection of walleye and support for a future fishery can only be achieved through a co-operative effort. Walleye harvest is now a serious cause for concern,"" said Lake Ontario Management Unit Manager Sandra Orsatti. ""Taking action to reduce the harvest now may prevent a collapse of the walleye population, and help sustain a small, healthy, naturally reproducing fishery in the future. This will only succeed with the support of all those who use the fishery."" If walleye fishing is closed in the Bay of Quinte, the closure would include the Bay, its tributaries and eastern Lake Ontario. Fishing for other species, such as yellow perch, bass, pike and sunfish, would remain open. Walleye populations in the Bay of Quinte have been declining rapidly since the mid-1990s. Excessive harvest and a changing environment in the Bay have contributed to the decline. Water clean-up efforts and zebra mussels have resulted in clearer water and an increase in aquatic plants. These environmental conditions are less supportive of walleye production. The Ministry of Natural Resources is concerned the existing rate of fish reproduction, coupled with the current rate of harvest, has put a severe strain on walleye. Even with additional protection, it is unlikely walleye will recover to the levels of the early 1990s. The Bay of Quinte has been a world-class recreational walleye fishery that stimulated and supported local business, tourism and fishing derby interests. There is a small licensed commercial fishery in eastern Lake Ontario for walleye. The Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte conduct both spear and gill-net fisheries for walleye. MNR's position has been that they may fish for food, social and ceremonial purposes but cannot fish commercially. The Ministry of Natural Resources and the major resource users are involved in discussions to find ways to maintain walleye and best manage for a diverse Bay of Quinte fishery in the future."

The Lake Ontario fishery, while probably one of the top 3 in the world for walleye ( in terms of fish size) does not sustain a huge population like Lake Erie. If you ask me the salmon stocking is partly to blame. Constant harvesting led to the decline. I find it hard to believe they will go to a complete shutdown, but maybe it's for the best. The western Lake Ontario population is still supporting the same numbers as usual, but the fish are rarely harvested. Most people closer to the Niagara River are fearful of eating them. Hopefully a slot limit and reduced limit will be offered as a compromise instead. The French River in northern Ontario has enjoyed robust walleye growth since they implemented reduced bag limits and a strict slot limit. Not so coincidently the musky population has also blossomed."

515343,Guest,2001-12-24 13:24:00,0,IT IS SAD TO SAY THE WALLEYE FISHING HAS GONE SOUR FOR THE BAY OF QUINTE.i MYSELF HAVE LIVED IN TRENTON ALL MY LIFE AND I DONTWANT TO POINT ANY FINGERS BUT SINCE THE SO CALLED CONCERVATIONIST INDIANS STARTED SPEARING AND GILL NETTING YOU COULD CATCH LOTS OF WALLEYE.dont give me this crap about zibbra mussles cleaning out the bay.its just the ministry being chicken to put there foot down and finding the easy way out.
515344,retire55,2001-12-25 12:44:00,1029,"Jamie:Total Bay of Quinte walleye harvest for 2000 was 121,000 walleye (MNRdata). Recreational fishermen harvested 32,000 walleye (27%). Legalcommercial fishing netted another 3,500 walleye (3%). Aboriginalsharvested 85,000 walleye (70%) either through spear fishing (8,500) or through gill netting (77,500) during the spring spawn.MNR scientists warned the minister that walleye breeding stock had declined to dangerously low levels and that a temporary closure (3 years) was required to permit breeding stock to recover to more sustainable numbers. Unfortunately, the minister wouldn't listen to his own expert staff and he just announced (24 Dec) that the Bay of Quinte would remain open. Consequently, another spring spawn massacre of walleye breeding stock will take place this coming April/May. Jay"
