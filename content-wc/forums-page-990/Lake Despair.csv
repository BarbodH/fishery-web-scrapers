Had decent luck although it could be spotty at times. Always did ok on either side of the entrance to Dispair, and near the curves in the mile river.We fished mostly for walleyes.Panroma was good from northern if you are up for the portage. Bob Baker was a good guide we used several times, also had a guide named Jerry who was top notch also. I liked fishing the chain on weekends it got alittle crowded"
