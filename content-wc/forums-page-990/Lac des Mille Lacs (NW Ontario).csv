The OMNR should be commended for righting a wrong and also spending some of their limited budget money on a study of the lake. As well all the hard worl of the Ice Fishermans Alliance and NOSA has paid off. It pays to belong to an outdoors related club and keep abreast of politics and issues in in your area.
