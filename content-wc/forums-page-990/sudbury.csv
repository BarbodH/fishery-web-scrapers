515583,Seanik,2001-12-14 10:22:00,218,"Fished Indian Lake with Sudbury Aviation July of 2000. Marge runs an excellent Operation, overweight loads not a problem, cabins just ok,boats and motors good. Indian Lake can be driven to with a short portage and is fished hard."
515584,phidelt157,2001-12-17 10:13:00,191,any advice about the lake? I spoke with another guy and he says the lake is productive. Thanks for the response.
515585,Seanik,2001-12-17 16:22:00,218,"When we fished Indian in July of 2000 the Walleye bite happened only early morning and last hour before dark. A good spot near camp, as you leave the small bay cabin is on turn left,go south on eastern shore anchor off rock face with minnows or mister twister jigs. We also got a few near the chiminy and the islands west of there. The best fishing took place at Zack Lake which produced an all day bite, bigger walleyes and Northerns till your arm got tired(no trophies but nice size). Zack Lake is about 8 miles north on Indian past I believe Blakes Camp and bear right. The entrance to Zack is a creek about 100 yards long which is shallow and rocky and you have to pole and paddle to get through it.Zack is about a mile long and worth the effort. Marge runs a great outfitter service and I highly recommend Sudbury Aviation. If I can motivate my fishing buds I'm thinking about booking Otterpelt Lake. Hope this helps."
