515702,Guest,2001-12-12 18:35:00,0,A group of us would like to do some camping in the bush up the Graham road north of Upsala and do some fishing. Has anyone fished any lakes in this area? How far can one go up the Graham road?
515703,Guest,2001-12-15 00:09:00,0,"I've fished up there several times. There is a camp about 30-40 miles up Graham Road that is on Wawang Lake. They have campsites with shower houses and you have access to many other lakes within a short drive. Twining lake just up the road is quite the adventure as it goes into 3 other lakes. There is a beautiful place to camp on the third lake in and we have done really well in there. The folks at Wawang can help you out with the details of getting in there to fish. Wawang itself is a rather clear lake and beautiful as well. Many big pike in there and good walleye fishing if you know where to look. I spent more time catching big pike there. Good luck. It's a great adventure, just remember to watch out for the logging trucks!"
