515711,Guest,2001-12-13 15:04:00,0,"T-Bird -Try calling Castle Baits in Ignace, Ont (use net yellow pages for the number) they should know. There is another bait shop in town as well.Hopefully they have the maps or know where you can get them. There is a outfit in near Thunder that sells maps(over the net) of almost every lake in NW Ontario but they lack detail (structure, depths, non topo) - you can find him by searching the for Ontario Lake Maps or something like that. Good luck,Fuzzy"

515714,Walizz 1,2001-12-14 01:52:00,535,"I've been fishing this area for 30 years. There really isn't any maps to speak of. I do have a photo copy of Elephant lake I'd be happy to send you. I also have a map of entire area with all lakes on it, and can give you number off it. You should be able to get one from local US and Canadian Map service. I don't know where your staying but the lodge should be able to give you the info you need, and so can I. U.S. Canadian Map Service is located in Neenah, WI. 920-731-0101. e-mail me if you have questions. Good Luck.Ginny Frank NPAA #844"
515715,BD,2001-12-14 16:04:00,739,Check out canadamapsales.com(?) It is a Manitoba gov. site that carries charts and maps available nowhere else. It is the only site that carried the charts of Press Lake near Ignace where I took my wife this fall.
