I think we managed only one decent sized W' in the whole 5 days. It's a nice lake and big enough so you can find some priviacy. TGG"

She got a couple of BIG snot rockets and some nice eyes. There are reports allready posted from ggg and myself. Search ""Press Lake"" on the Canada board and check the postings by me and ggg."
