BOOM BOOMHas anyone tried those new style propane heaters by Coleman or Mr. Heater? Their claim is that you won't get gassed out as much.I would appreciate your comments good or bad...Has anyone been to Annama Bay last winter? I use to make many trips in the past few years but I have found it dead, and didn't go back last year. When a guy could go to Whytemouth and pound them it was hard to miss a weekend from there last year.thanksPaul"

It's probably bigger than I really need, it's a little klunky carrying around in the sled, but it warms up the 4 man tent quickly and makes it very comfortable. I alway keep a little ventilation going, and haven't had any problems with fume buildup. Good luck."
515465,Guest,2001-12-04 13:23:00,0,Any guess on when one could expect safe ice on the Red? I was hoping to make a trip week before Christmas. Where is Netley Creek?Thanks.

Netley Creek is a short drive north of Selkirk on the Red River. On December 9,2001 there was 4.5"" of ice, and people were walking on at the creek. Fishing was slow. One 3 pounder and 2 small saugers.Well thats fishing."
