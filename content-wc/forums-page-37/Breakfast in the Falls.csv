Open at 5:00 am every day as I recall. Parking lot WILL fit your vehicle and boat. Parking lot needs some patching so go slow. Hours may reduce when fall/winter sets in. Say 'hi' the Brook and her friendly staff. We're up here for our annual 5 month visit and try to support all the locally owned and operated places."
