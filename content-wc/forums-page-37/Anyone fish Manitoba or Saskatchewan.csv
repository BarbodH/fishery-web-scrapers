6669668,krazyk711,2022-07-02 10:36:00,26,I went to Aurora Nights and the flood was the best thing that could happen to it !!! Aurora has very little fishing area and the staff didn't want to put forth any effort in taking people up river..probably because the boats leaked and the motors didn't work. which was the case at the main camp !! Big Pike camp is a fish factory however the accommodations and staff leave alot to be desired. I'm only trying to be informative and not get attacked as is so typical ! Bottom line is go to Trout Rock if you want the best of both worlds..Better book now cause they're filled to 2025 !!!!
6669674,bthomas3333,2022-07-02 11:14:00,465,Fished Trout rock and yes they run a quality experience. Yes Trout rock is nearly impossible to get into. You feel like you won the lottery when you get a slot. I have fished the other two and disagree based on my experience. You just need to adjust your expectation due to a different price point and the additional travel distance. Everyone needs to find their place and 'know thyself'. Looks like you found yours! Good deal! Brett
6669678,Eckohlt,2022-07-02 11:29:00,3685,"Do you need to hit the lottery brett, to go to Trout rock?"
6669700,bthomas3333,2022-07-02 13:05:00,465,Maybe just a decent scratcher Ecko. LOL. It is around 5250 plus tip for a week. I did 3 days for 2400 at the time. It is amazing pike fishing for the 830a - 5p you get to fish minus the 60-120min shore lunch.It is 'only' a 15min flight from yellowknife. If you towed your boat up to Yellowknife I would guess in 1-2 hours you could be fishing the same area. Both of the Taltson river spots are around 100 miles from Yellowknife so anyone without a BIG boat to cross GSL or a floatplane doesnt have summer access. This distance plays into ammenites and price.Saying someone camp was better off flooded out is pretty harsh too. That is someone's life and livelihood.B-
6669706,Eckohlt,2022-07-02 13:50:00,3685,Thanks for the info.
6669960,isolveit4444,2022-07-03 14:55:00,30,I went to Gunisao Lake a few years back. The walleye fishing was fantastic. I got 4 over 28 inches and too many to count over 26. it was pricey and a guide was required.
6669964,Eckohlt,2022-07-03 15:24:00,3685,What did you pay the guide?or was that included in the price?
6669990,reddemon2,2022-07-03 16:24:00,255,"1 guide is provided in the price for every 2 fisherman it looks like, Just can justify spending upto $7k to catch 28"" walleyes, Now if they were 35""+ i may consider it"
6670002,Eckohlt,2022-07-03 16:57:00,3685,"Hhhhmmmmm $7k that could turn into 7 Ontario trips,,,,,7 weeks.gotta go with it reddemon2!!"
6668850,Esoxmike,2022-06-29 03:27:00,114,"Don't you sleep,lol."
6668856,Eckohlt,2022-06-29 04:45:00,3685,Up early don't want to burn any daylight lol.I'm up at 4 am on fishing trips also waiting for light to go ruin the start of the walleyes day.
6669284,krazyk711,2022-06-30 20:11:00,26,"FYI I've been all over Manitoba and Saskatchewan and to be honest nothing compares with the fishing in NWT. Sure it costs some money but I just got back and my buddy and me landed 54 trophies over 40"" with 40 of those over 41"". Biggest 3 were 46"". The amount of fish we caught was insane and to quote my friend ""this is stupid""! Also these fish are built like tanks no rails !!! I only wish I would have started going up there sooner..Great Slave is a pike fisherman's paradise and I'm not referring to the Taltson River Camps....thats another story..."
6669320,Eckohlt,2022-07-01 03:07:00,3685,Cost more than some money!
6669342,prov1800,2022-07-01 06:14:00,5010,If you got it than spend it.Depends on what it takes to make you happy.doesnt take much to make me happy.
6669370,bthomas3333,2022-07-01 07:19:00,465,"I've fished 4 different places on Great Slave they were all awesome and different which makes sense since it is a HUGE lake. There is a fantastic fishing there and glad you had a good trip. I guess I would rather hear where you went that was so fantastic as opposed to a side-ways slam against ""Taltson River Camps"" whatever that is. The river camp is called Aurora Nights and it was flooded out of existence 2 years ago. They are struggling to rebuild. The other camp is Taltson bay camp and many people have had fantastic trips there. B-"
6669414,Eckohlt,2022-07-01 11:23:00,3685,Free minnows what would make a guy more happier?Probably nothing.
6669450,reddemon2,2022-07-01 15:33:00,255,"I'd say www.grandslamlodge.com on Reindeer Lake is a pretty sweet deal, $350 CDN a day that includes a guide for 9 hours that even cooks you shore lunch, Looks like a nice place. Add that to my Bucket List also"
6669456,prov1800,2022-07-01 15:45:00,5010,Better jump on that deal Randy.
6669464,Eckohlt,2022-07-01 16:04:00,3685,Plus tip!
6668418,reddemon2,2022-06-27 16:13:00,255,"Wollaston Lake was on my bucket list, should be a fun drive"
6668488,SweetD,2022-06-27 21:21:00,243,Been once to MB in my 30+ years going North. Was not one of those high-end lodges where guides guide you and cooks cook for you. It was a small outpost cabin with 5 great buddies on the Berens River. It was a great trip. Not hundreds of monster pike or trout. Just your typical buddy trip to the bush pounding eater walleyes and hooking up with 2-3Pike over 40”. It is the experience I continue to desire all these years later. On our own schedule doing our own thing without anyone but us to care for us. The big dollar “experience” places so many people talk about I’m sure are once in a lifetime and maybe many times in a lifetime for some. I wouldn’t trade my simple on our own housekeeping trips with my closest friends for any of that but then that’s just me. It’s really what you make of the experience and the comraderie you can only get in the bush!
6668518,moondog71,2022-06-28 05:06:00,22,GBS would you mind letting me know the name of the lodge/outfitter at Reed Lake?
6668632,DeBo,2022-06-28 11:16:00,211,Been wanting to make the journey to Kinoosao and head out on Reindeer. Anyone ever done that??
6668740,reddemon2,2022-06-28 16:30:00,255,That's another lake on my bucket list
6668744,prov1800,2022-06-28 16:39:00,5010,Have 2 guys from wi up up here and we got on the subject off fishing up northThey have been to many in sk but they said out of all the lodges they have been to Scott Lake they Saud was the best
6668754,reddemon2,2022-06-28 17:01:00,255,"Only problem with Scott lake is the cost, $7000-13000 US"
6668758,prov1800,2022-06-28 17:32:00,5010,Yup and he brought 5 of his kids with him.lol.
6668792,SweetD,2022-06-28 19:02:00,243,No freaking way when I could make 3-5 fly in trip for that amount
6668848,Eckohlt,2022-06-29 02:50:00,3685,More like 5-10 flyin trips
6667892,reddemon2,2022-06-26 07:32:00,255,"All i ever see is ontario, I'm going upto Wollaston Lake, Sk in Sept and Have 2 trips to Manitoba next yr"
6667912,Eckohlt,2022-06-26 08:23:00,3685,"You may have sk all to yourself,seems no one fishes there.Probably cause it's a heck of a road to drive there for most."
6667914,reddemon2,2022-06-26 08:24:00,255,Only 1400 miles for me to SK one way lol
6667920,prov1800,2022-06-26 08:36:00,5010,"The good fishing is way up north.I have a buddy from British Columbia tgat guides at wollasten lake Lodge.He has been catching lots of 40""+ pike and some good lake trout.Ice finally gone there.Great fishing but very expensive if you can afford it.Water does not warm up there so tgats why pike fishing and trout is so good.Fish don't go that deep there so easy to catch"
6667924,ukats18,2022-06-26 08:40:00,4,"Many many years of fishing in both provinces. No longer there but a fabulous place was Anglers Rapids on the Churchill River just north of La Ronge.Although mostly in Northwest Territories, Scott Lake Lodge was the most high end I’ve ever been. Great place. Manitoba was mostly Dogskin Lake growing up and the outposts lakes they use to have. Jackson’s Outfitters in eastern Manitoba we used before also. For those of us that live in South US, driving is usually not a economically conducive considering loss of work etc…and Winnipeg is (at least was) an easy place to get to.Dave"
6668156,h8go4s,2022-06-26 20:40:00,1673,"I did a few trips between 2008 and 2015 to Reed Lake, Manitoba. We tried to time it just after ice-out and caught lots of pike over 40"", plus walleyes and lakers. Left in the morning, drove straight through and arrived at the campground the next morning. Not very smart. Trying to sleep in the back seat of the truck doesn't work very well. We were all exhausted when we got there. But the fishing was great."
6668162,GBS,2022-06-26 21:05:00,2271,"Only one trip to Reed Lake, but as noted many Northern over 40"". My best was 52 (!). Easy to catch walleye starting about 1/2 hr before lunch. Didn't try for trout, as it was later in the season, and didn't feel like going deeper."
6668214,Bstar,2022-06-27 05:23:00,564,Next year our group is going to Marshland Outfitter's camp on Burnett Lake which is northeast of Wollaston Lake. This is a bucket list trip for us. Can't wait!
6668294,bthomas3333,2022-06-27 10:43:00,465,"Hello, Just returned from Broken Arrow Lodge on Cree Lake. Excellent trip. I'll write it up when I get caught up with work stuff. I've also fished (Dunlopsx2 in MB). I am headed to God's River Lodge in Sept for Brookies. Next year headed to Misekumaw in June. Back to Broken Arrow on Cree in Sept 23. You didn't really ask a question but yes a lot of us have fished different places in SK and MB. Thanks, Brett"
