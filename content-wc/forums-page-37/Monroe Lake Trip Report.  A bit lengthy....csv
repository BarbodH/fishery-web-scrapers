6668702,NM_Trout,2022-06-28 15:19:00,1094,"We are back from our trip. It was a good trip. This was Monroe Lake with Loon Haunt Outfitters. About 25 miles NW of Red Lake Ontario. Lake is here : https://www.google.com/maps/search/re+lake+ontario/@51.3785773,-94.1063081,13.61zFrom the outfitter : http://www.loonhaunt.com/monroe/Our trip in was mostly uneventful. We flew into Grand Forks ND so we had a long commute. Got most of the groceries at Walmart in Grand Forks, then the produce, meat and eggs at the Safeway in Kenora. Border crossing was a breeze. Two cars in front of us, and a 30 second interview with the official. No random covid test, thank God. BTW, the Walmart in Kenora sucks for groceries. I made a note in my journal about that. 105 just north of Vermillion Bay was still closed, so we had to take the bypass. I have heard that it is now open. Quite a few parts of 105N to Red Lake were washed out and temporarily repaired with gravel. We saw 7 moose, two bear, and a red fox on the way up. Arrived Red Lake at about 10:30pm and repacked into small duffels for the float plane before bed. We stayed at the ""new"" Super 8 by Wyndham. It was clean and comfortable. We flew out of the owner's Red Lake residence. Bill and Louise Coppen have an in-town house on the water in Red Lake. He picked us up at 0730 in his 185 and we were at Monroe shortly. Sunday was great. We set up bug nets over the beds, unpacked and rigged, and were out on the water by 10:30. The camps run by Loon Haunt are darn near perfect. Monroe is an older cabin, and starting to settle on one side, but everything inside works great. Boat motors worked just fine the whole trip. I asked Bill for a set of oars (easier to position the boat when the person in the bow is fly fishing) and he had a set there. The lake was up by about 16, and the high water and ice this spring wrecked their dock. They stitched it together with rope and 16p nails to make something usable until permanent repairs could be made. It was just fine for our needs. Sunday weather was perfect. Light wind with walleye chop, slightly overcast skies. We caught fish right away in the ""usual"" spots. Using an Impulse Paddle tail electric chicken plastic with a fluorescent pink jig head was the hot lure of the trip. I would never have guessed as much, what an ugly lure!We made a run back to the cabin, cleaned fish and set out for our first shore lunch. Last trip we waited for a shore lunch until the end of the trip and the weather was not good. We now do shore lunch at earliest opportunities. We just enjoy them so very much. We had 3 or 4 shore meals this trip. The Dad on the dad / daughter trip forgot the beer batter mix, so we ended up only using breading. We used Zatarains cajun fish breading and found it to be excellent. We brought some Chik-fil-A sauce with us and we both enjoyed that on fried walleye. Weather alternated good and bad on a daily schedule. A couple of the days the wind was just too much for us. We learned to play Farkle :-) My daughter got motion sickness one day due to heavy waves, so we came inside the cabin to rest a bit. The lake is currently about 75% surrounded by burned up trees from a large forest fire last year. Aside from the aesthetic hit, many trees have dropped into the water along the shore, so shore snags were more problematic this year. However, we noticed what appeared to be a tenfold increase in baitfish in the lake. I think that the bait has better cover and bait is reproducing at a higher rate. Seems like this could drastically improve the already-fantastic fishing over the next few years. Time will tell. The other issue with the fire was that the hike to the portage lake is compromised. The trees died, some roots burned, and then erosion cut out underneath the trees. So there were lots of problematic areas where you had to step on roots in order to hike to the portage lake. Below those roots were holes of 2 or more feet of depth. A wrong slip could easily sprain or break an ankle. We worked with the outfitter to clear the trail to the portage, and he said that he is going to re-route the trail through a more safe area. The boat at the portage lake had a can of gas under it which ignited, and the aluminum boat was melted. Quite the sight. We are not great lake fishermen (we are more cold water trout fly fishers) but we have learned to follow the wind and fish points and structures and water flow on the windward side. We did very well. Of course, you could be a complete noob and still do very well here. No large walleye were caught, our largest was 22. We each caught pike in the mid 30's.We didn't keep count every day, and we were catching somewhat slow, as we were mostly fly fishing. We did try and see what we could do one evening and we finished the night with about 75 fish. One of us got a sliced thumb by a pike, and the back of the boat looked like a crime scene before things got shut off with super glue. I'm not mentioning anybody by name, but he is currently typing this and hitting the space bar with his wrong-handed thumb. Fly fishing with large streamers that I tied up was a complete hoot. My daughter caught a personal best fly rod pike. Not a giant by any means, but certainly exciting for us and a fun time on a 8wt fly rod. Rest of the trip was the normal walleye-factory fishing. Evenings were fantastic. We looked for areas where water was coming and going to the lake, and that attracted minnows which attracted walleye, which attracted pike. Mosquitoes at the end of the trip were voracious. We would slather on picaridin, and the mosquitoes would just hover off our faces by about 3. We finally gave up and put on head nets. We ate too much, stayed up too late, slept too late, and just goofed off for an entire week. We started slow with big breakfasts and then fished hard. We have a couple of geocaches up there, and we rebuilt the one that got damaged by the fire. Trip back was ok. No weather delays and we got back to Red Lake around 8am. Trip back to Grand Forks seemed very, very long. We were both exhausted. (As a side note, I won't ever lodge at the Staybridge in Grand Forks again. I thought I was splurging on a little bit nicer hotel for our last night before flying out. The only thing missing from our room was a chalk image of a body laying on the floor.)I can't recommend Loon Haunt outfitters highly enough. They are kind folks, and they completely invest in ensuring that you have a fantastic trip. I've been outfitting with them for 20 years now and have never been even mildly disappointed."

6668794,KC Walleye,2022-06-28 19:31:00,274,Great report. Thanks for sharing!
6670098,kona77,2022-07-04 05:54:00,236,NM Trout- Nice report and so happy to see you are still fishing with your daughter. I agree about Bill and Louise Coppen being great folks and outfitters. Our group fished Cherrington Lake with them for many years and I remember seeing your posts on their site back then. Only switched outfitters when they stopped leasing Cherrington and we lost our spot with the new outfitter. I know Bill/Louise were talking about retirement years ago when we fished with them and I hope they are both doing well..

6670112,HeHooksHimself,2022-07-04 06:59:00,725,Thanks for the report. That is a great read and it makes me wonder why younger folks aren't finding ways to make these kind of memories. Hats off to you NM Trout!
6670204,Old Timer,2022-07-04 10:30:00,255,NM_Trout: Thanks for your thorough report. I enjoyed reading it.
6670206,NM_Trout,2022-07-04 10:36:00,1094,"My daughter loves to fish. She has an old soul. I remember when she caught her first fish at 3.5 years old. It was a pay to play pond. $0.50 an inch sort of place, and if you hook it you have to keep it. I think I spent about $40 back then and I was internally groaning. But I have a picture of her from that day, and you can darn near see her vibrating from the adrenaline. At 6 she was rigging her own rod and would fish Big Meadows CO reservoir below our camp. I also remember her not understanding that it is a *daily* limit. She caught a limit, brought them to camp, and while I was cleaning them she ran back down to the lake to catch another limit. We had a long talk about that. She started fly fishing at 11, and her first trip to Canada when she was 13. I taught her to keep a journal on that trip. We started getting more serious about bass fishing when she was 14. When she went off to college far away I darn near cried for a month. She started a fishing club in college, taught fly casting to other students, hosted tournaments, and bonfire parties for catfish outings too. When she graduated, she got an offer from Major League Fishing as a project manager, but she said it sounded more like it was a bass fishing hooter girl and she said no thanks. She'd rather fish instead of bring snacks to those who do. She's married now, so this was likely our last dad/daughter solo trip to Canada. I don't know how many hundreds of hours we have spent together holding fishing rods, or behind a windshield towing a boat, covering every topic under the sun (and me trying to be calm when some tough topics came up). It's still hard for me to fish without her as I am always looking upstream for her or waiting for her to yell ""yoo-hoo"" just to rub in that she hooked another. No telling how much all that cost, but it was worth every penny. At the very end of my life, if I am remembering shore lunches with her, well... that will be exactly as I'd want that moment to be. C'mon grandkids! Ready to start all over with crickets and worms. I can't wait."
