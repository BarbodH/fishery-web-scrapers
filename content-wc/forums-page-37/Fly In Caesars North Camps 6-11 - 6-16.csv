6668612,Phillypat,2022-06-28 10:43:00,12,"I am pretty new to the whole fly in walleye thing and used this forum to get tips and research guides so I figured I would return the favor and give some back. I live in Philadelphia and we have a short walleye season in the colder on a very marginal population in the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers. This is the only previous walleye experience I had prior to my first fly in trip in 2019. I find the Canadian shield is wayyy different.I first went with Oliver at Caesars North Camps on the opener in 2019 as guest of a group that needed another guy to go. I found mid-May in the north is cold, the main Gouin reservoir was frozen over and there was still unmelted snow on the ground. I suspect the water temps at our camp at Gouin 1 were in the high 30s or low 40s. Fishing was brutally slow and we only hit double digits on fish one day but I enjoyed being so remote. We also had major travel hangups both to and from and got to a hotel so late going up we could not check in and had to sleep in the car in like 40F weather! Needless to say I was pretty pissed at our group's trip planner for screwing this up!Overall I appreciated the service Oliver Brossard gave so I decided to book with him again and was able to get 1 person to go along with me and go later in the year. After booking Little Gouin for June of 2020 our trip got pushed back 2 years before I finally was able to fly into the lake on June 11th 2022. Heading up we drove 7 hrs from Philly to Ottawa, got lunch, got beer, and hit the grocery store. We then drove another 2 hours to Mt Laurier and stayed the night there. The next morning we did dirt road to Clova. Props to my CRV for handling the road well and getting from Philly to Clova on just 2.5 tanks of gas! Oliver greeted us with an open fridge of beer and flew us to our lake. Now for the fishing:Day 1: Warm beautiful weather for flying in and fishing. We got about 15 walleye and a few pike on the evening bite. My friend and I were walleye and Canadian shield novices so I was satisfied.Day 2: Woke up to a cold front. Colder (~50F) and windy with constant downpour rain. This seemed to put the pike down for a few days but the walleyes were fired up. We ended up with 30 or so walleye on the day while doing tons of exploring. Day 3: Had that ""post frontal"" weather situation. Cold, and windy with alternating clouds and wind. All the fish seemed a little put down but we managed to put a bit of a bit together. The pike were totally shut down. We did tons of exploring hoping to find a good pod of hungry fish but couldnt get it done. We ended up with around 25 fish or so hopping around all dayDay 4: We decided to make the long haul and go to one of the hike in lakes. We mismanaged our time by hitting our main lake spots on the way back and didnt get to the hike in lake til after noon and the bright sun was beginning to put the fish down. Lake Nico produced our biggest pike of the trip tho, 33"" and at the time our biggest walleye 25"". Overall it was slow though although I think that had more to do with time of day. We closed the night fishing near our cabin. Probably another 30 fish or so on the day. In the evening we watched a moose swim across the lake which was awesome!Day 5: The weather warmed back up our final day we got up super early and decided to just focus on the main lake spots and get our numbers up. In the morning we ended up with our best walleye of the trip, 28""! After hitting our walleye spots and doing well we decided to see if the warm weather woke the pike up. It seems that it did and we had at least a hit in every cove! Most were 25""-30"". My friend hooked up with a fish over 40"" that unfortunately wrapped him in a log and broke off.Day 6: Cold front came through again and our pilot did a wonderful job maneuvering the plane on a windy and choppy lake. Stayed the night in Ottawa and bar hopped on our first night back in civilization. Lovely city and I will sure stay again!Closing Observations:I had a pitch counter with me and only counted walleye and pike and had 153 fish in 4.5 days between 2 guys. We did tons of exploring and it took us a while to nail the pattern down so I will say this was pretty good . Our top walleye lures were bright colored grubs, fork tails, and paddletails. We also caught walleye trolling hot n tots as well. For pike spoons and 7 inch zooms rigged texas and weightless were the top lures We had a few eat our walleye jigs too. With the changing wind conditions on the lake, we used anywhere from 1/8 to 1/2 oz jigs.Fishing was great early in the day, would lull in the afternoon, then picked back up again around 5pm and then would slow down around 8pm. The twilight lull seemed very unusual for walleye but we noticed it every day. The stomachs of our walleye were primarily filled with mayfly nymps.Oliver runs an A+ operation and I will be up again next year. Hoping to use this trip as a use case and get a bigger group to another lake. He even kept my price from 2020 despite the price of literally everything having gone up.Black flies came as advertised but high percentage deet bug spray would keep them away. On the windy days no bug spray was needed.WE SAW A MOOSE!Thanks to everyone in this forum who helped me without having known it and many thanks to anyone who reads this long report!"
6668666,fishron,2022-06-28 13:49:00,317,"Pat, I really enjoyed reading your post on the trip. My fishing has been with Air Tamarac next door to Caesars in Clova. We fished Lac Hebert toward the end of June and the walleye fishing can't be believed. I grew up in Philly and then Bucks County and caught my first walleyes on the delaware near New Hope. Nice fish but never close to the taste of Canadien walleye. Your experience was a challenge but it only gets better as you gain more knowledge. Big walleye and pike and Lake trout have come my way over the years within a days drive of SE pa. Again, thanks for your report. Lots of good information on this site. Ron"
6668976,Peterpikes,2022-06-29 13:27:00,33,"This will be my 20th year in a row with Ceasars (minus the last 2 Covid years). My family started going to ceasars back in 80’s when Oliver’s father owned it. Oliver and John are both class acts, they will do whatever it takes for the customer. We have tried some of the remote lakes, but our favorite cabin and the one I spent the last 15 years at is Gouin 3. It’s on a nice part of the gouin with access to many areas and a ton of structure. Years ago it was their VIP cabin and the boats there are 16’ which is larger then their other outpost. We always catch fish, but it’s fishing and results vary year to year. We’ve had weeks where we only caught 100 fish per guy and weeks we were close to 400 fish per guy. The weather during your stay can make or break the bite. Largest walleye to date in the group was 32” almost 11 pounds and largest pike 47” and 25+ pounds. Overall I’d recommend ceasars to anyone. If your looking for more info on the cabin or wondering what lures we have success on let me know. How was the water level when you We’re up there? I heard it was very low last year and was wondering if that has changed. I’m headed up in 3 weeks, can’t wait. -Pete"
6669114,vteye3,2022-06-30 06:03:00,496,"Nice report PPat - our group did half dozen trips on the Gouin mostly on the southern end of the Resv near the dam. We have great memories including one week we spent 3 days swimming as temps were at 100 degrees in mid June. My sons, father and brother were along on that trip. Your fishing results sound good as it takes a few trips to figure out were the fish will be asweather, water levels vary year to year. Great memories of the Gouin"
6669834,Phillypat,2022-07-03 08:58:00,12,I was told the water levels were high as they had a ton of rain and melt this spring. We were noticing the water levels would go down a few inches every day.
6669846,That Minnesota guy,2022-07-03 09:26:00,8293,Sounds like you had fun which is the point right?
