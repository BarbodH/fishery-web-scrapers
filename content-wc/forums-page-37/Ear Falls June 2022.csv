We did encounter a detour in Vermillion Bay as a portion of HWY 105 was washed out and being repaired. Got into camp (Little Canada Camp) and found Lac Suel up about 6' and the English River below the dam at Ear Falls was up about 8'. I have never seen this much water and I have been coming up since 1988. The current was so strong that our normal fishing spots were pretty much unfishable. The key to finding and catching fish was finding slack water and current breaks just off of the main current. You had to work for the walleyes but we caught plenty and had a few good ones with 27 1/2"" being the biggest. No big northerns this trip but there seems to be plenty of small ones. We will be heading back in October. Here's some pictures as well."

6668698,ackvil,2022-06-28 15:10:00,177,We were there at about the same time. The water level was high and the amount of floating debris was incredible. We saw one boat being towed back after it hit a rock that was underwater and floating logs. Most of the fish we caught were well above the slot size.
