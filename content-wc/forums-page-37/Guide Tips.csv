6667702,Eckohlt,2022-06-25 12:44:00,3685,"All my good friends that go on the trip,whoever is in my boat I charge him 300 for the week,usually when I ask for tip he will give me a 4 letter word or use a finger."
6667740,Cgillespie,2022-06-25 15:29:00,120,"The guide we had guides just about every day from the lodge starting in May and ending in September. He lives in Winnipeg in the winter. From what I've been told, there is a shortage of guides this year due to so many leaving during Covid and not coming back. Several of the staff at the lodge were not local and were brought in from other parts of Canada. I know one came from the Toronto area and another from Newfoundland."
6667752,Eckohlt,2022-06-25 16:19:00,3685,What resort did you stay at??
6667798,Obabikon,2022-06-25 19:11:00,2370,"So, we charge $250/day for a guide. Between EI (employment insurance), WSIB (worker safety insurance), SI (Canada's social security), gas, food... we try to break even on guides. I actually have one that I lose money on, but he's been with us forever. They also work at the camp when they don't guide... but at a different rate. As far as tipping... $50-$100 is a starting range. If the day is unbelievable, throw in some more. If there are more than 2-3 people, throw in some more. If you used any of his equipment, throw in some more. There's lots of factors, but the reality is... no guides out there are getting rich. If we want this profession to be around in 10 years... we need to pay them pretty well. Gold mines and other forms of work are out paying... and we're losing many of the best guides! This is just my opinion."
6667878,kim n indiana,2022-06-26 06:52:00,62,i did shooting star twice. both times they took me out on lake/river and showed me where to fish. both times we did a portage so it wasn't just a drive by. over an hour each time. they were the ones that had a bear in camp that ended up saving my life i'm sure. but that's a story for campfire next month.
6668436,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2022-06-27 17:06:00,240,"I make solo trips to the boundary water lakes of Minnesota/Ontario each July. I have fished with the same guide for over 20 years now. I tip him $100/day, no matter what the fishing is like and no matter what the weather conditions are. I'll tip more if appropriate. I like to use a guide when having only a week to fish. We usually get on fish right away (but they don't always feel like chewing), and we are usually able to do the multi-species thing without too much of a problem. Not having to tow a boat/motor, not having to navigate a lake like Saganaga, with all its bays and islands, and not having to fillet fish at the day's end is a luxury. One I only use on my boundary waters trip."
6670570,Sylvanboat,2022-07-05 09:59:00,94,"Guides, like other professionals, come in all sizes and flavors. I have been going to Canada since the 70s and using guides since the 80s. A great guide deserves to be paid, bad guides don't. One thing I have learned is guides in Canada pay more for baits. On our trips I show the guide the baits I have and let him suggest what to use. At the end of the trip I let him pick any bait I have to keep. This is on top of the tip. These guys have seen two years with no US guests. They are struggling. We are going end of July. I will take very good care of our regular guide."
6667454,Eckohlt,2022-06-24 17:49:00,3685,If your not a guide guy why are you paying the guides??is it just for info???
6667472,SweetD,2022-06-24 18:34:00,243,This is a bit off topic but if a group was struggling I would think its in the best interest of the outfitter to help the group locate fish and offer tips on techniques including what’s hot and what’s not!!! I have even experienced an outfitter that (as part of your trip) took the group…….everyone followed him around to spots and locations that generally hold fish. It was literally like a 4 hour introduction to the 12 mile long lake! We caught lots of fish on those spots he showed us. We did tip him at end of week for overall experience we had! I don’t think many outfitters go to that length but most of the really good ones provide solid intel on their fishery!
6667476,Baseline,2022-06-24 19:02:00,3207,The guides at the resort are likely guys from around the area who work at the resort. It's likely they are just taking you fishing for the day to some well known resort spots. I'd say $20 per man with a max of $50 for the boat per day or $100 per guy for the whole week.
6667478,prov1800,2022-06-24 19:15:00,5010,On a normal bases 50-100.per day.
6667494,'Taterguy,2022-06-24 20:03:00,33,"Timely topic for me. I hired a guide for a lake in Wisconsin next week. 6 hours, boat, bait, gear, picks us up at the resort: $250 for two people. I figured $50 tip. I asked for a walleye and pike day. We'll see. I'm doing it mainly for my B-I-L, we can catch all the bass and pan fish we want in his ponds but he has never caught a walleye or pike. I drive the rental pontoon when we are up there and I just can't get us in good position to catch much of anything. Plus I'm hoping to lean how to better use electronics and specific techniques. $250 sounded kinda steep at first, but if it helps us up our game for future trips it will be worth it."
6667622,Bakefish,2022-06-25 08:39:00,1077,"Hired a guide several years ago for a trip we made to Lake Despair. There was a 40 degree temperature drop from the previous day, so fishing was just awful. We hired this guy for one day just to show us the lake and put us on some spots. He worked his butt off for us. He even showed us his personal spots that he doesn't show his clients because we had such a hard time catching fish. We explained to him that we understood the situation with the front passage and tough fishing, but he still beat himself up for not putting us on fish. When it came time to settle up he refused the tip. It got to where we were almost begging him to take our money, but he still refused. The week continued to be tough for picking up fish, but we kept fishing his spots and caught some decent fish, actually we were the envy of the camp. For the life of me I can't remember this guys name, but he was the best guide I ever encountered."
6667674,Old Timer,2022-06-25 11:08:00,255,"Eck: If you want to learn new, big water like, let's say, the north arm of Rainy or the Yellow Girl and Big Island areas of LOTW, a guide can speed up the learning curve. Or if you're taking elderly people, and maybe children, a guide is invaluable in those situations too and beyond just finding fish. Now, if you're one of those folks who fishes the same outpost year after year a guide is unnecessary. You just start with the outfitter's map, what the previous group tells you and what you've learned from earlier trips. For me, most of those outpost lakes lose their appeal after the first year or two. Like I said before, I've been amazed at what I've learned from guides, even on waters I thought I knew really well. I get it may be an ego trip to say I've never used a guide and if you're one of those people, good for you. But I suspect you too would learn something useful if you get an opportunity to fish with a really good guide. By the way, what Canada lakes are you fishing this year? That may help me understand your perspective. Maybe I was there fifty years ago."
6667678,Eckohlt,2022-06-25 11:31:00,3685,"Gotcha!!,,,,I fished wapesi lake June 13,going back there july17,Aug going to keikewabik,sept going to abamasagi lake near nakina all flyin."
6667684,Old Timer,2022-06-25 12:12:00,255,Eck: You have a full fishing schedule. I fished Keikewabik and Kabikwabik back in the 50s and early 60s. A friend from Waukegan Illinois owned a tarpaper shack on the north side of Kab about where the outpost is now located. We'd portage in from the far end of Red Pine Bay. We took a lot of nice fish from those lakes.
6667692,RLundin,2022-06-25 12:27:00,22,"If you pay the lodge (NW Ontario) $250-$300 for a guide for the day, how much of this goes to the guide? I assume it makes a big difference if the guide is a lodge employee vs a guide the lodge had to find an outside guide."
6667376,prov1800,2022-06-24 14:09:00,5010,Depends on what you can afford.I don't get paid by camps.They just direct people my way and we talk on the phone and make a game plan.Iam at 275 US a day if I come and use camp equipment 500 US if my use my truck and boat.My equipment and fuel and bait.Any lake you have in mind.Any species.Guys I take out tip very generously.ive gone to some far off destinations and hired guides myself and always treat them good no matter what type of day we had.
6667390,SweetD,2022-06-24 14:54:00,243,"Prov1800, so what is a reasonable tip(or range) for guided fishing on an 8 hour guided trip per man? I assume you take 2-3 when you guide?"
6667392,walleyecheek,2022-06-24 15:07:00,2231,Yeah I'd be happy to tip a guide quite generously to fish Tarpon in the Keys ! But not so generously to catch a walleye in CANADA. Lol.
6667406,Eckohlt,2022-06-24 15:52:00,3685,is that a generous tip for 1 tampon or many??
6667414,walleyecheek,2022-06-24 16:01:00,2231,Eck ! What the **** what'd ya do fall off the Wagon ?
6667418,Eckohlt,2022-06-24 16:08:00,3685,"Naaa,did fall out of the boat 10 days ago,floaties on each arm saved my life,otherwise be at the bottom of wapesi lake,leech bait!"
6667428,reddemon2,2022-06-24 16:25:00,255,"Prov1800 is the only guide i have found under $450 day, Others are between 450-600"
6667430,Eckohlt,2022-06-24 16:38:00,3685,"I would want to catch a walleye for each dollar I pay to the guide,then you'll know your rod n reel n arms are going to get a workout."
6667438,Old Timer,2022-06-24 17:03:00,255,"I'm with Sweet on this one. And I'm not guide guy either. But let's say you buy a fishing package from the lodge that includes a fishing boat and motor, but the guide is extra. On a lake like LOTW the extra guide fee is like $200-250/day. For me, the tip is $25-50/fisherman. If the guide goes out of his way to mark my map with hazards and good spots we didn't fish, I'll tip on the high side of the above range and maybe more. If it's just a rum-dumb trip I'm inclined to tip towards the low side. I don't judge a guide by the number of fish. I can tell pretty quick if the guide knows his craft and puts out the effort I think we deserve. And I'll tip accordingly. I always tip the guide directly and in U.S. cash. That's like a 20% spiff right there. I've fished Canada for more than sixty years and almost entirely on my own. But I've been amazed by what I've learned from a good guide, even on lakes I believe I know well. Maybe 50 years ago an old fella told me never try to beat a man at his own lake."
6667448,NM_Trout,2022-06-24 17:41:00,1094,15 to 20%. I tip more % if the guide fee is less and the fishing good. I tip less if the guide fee is higher or the fishing poor.
6667322,RLundin,2022-06-24 11:40:00,22,"1) What percentage of the guide fee do you pay a guide in tips? (average day of fishing) A) Guide provides boat, lunch, drinks (maybe makes shore lunch)? B) Guide rides in your boat and doesn't provide you any food/drinks/gear (just fishing location, knowledge)? 2) If you pay a lodge for a guide and the lodge finds an independent guide for the day (not employee of lodge), what % does the guide typically get?"
6667330,Eckohlt,2022-06-24 12:11:00,3685,"If he marks a map of fishing spots he doesn't need to go with you,just extra dead weight."
6667332,SweetD,2022-06-24 12:11:00,243,"Not a guide kinda guy personally but I would say a guide is there to put you on fish. With that said weather, fisherman proficiency can impact success. I don’t think all the “fluff” should be expected personally.I would think a $25-$50 per man tip (for a $200 day guide) would be appropriate with success dictating the lower and upper end of the range. So two guys fishing with a $200 guide. $50-$100 seems reasonable and appropriate to me.I guess if fluff or extras beyobd putting fish in the boat is what you are looking for and they provide that by all means feel free to add or take away accordingly &#x1f60e;"
6667340,Eckohlt,2022-06-24 12:25:00,3685,"200$ an 8 hour day,25$ a hour ain't gonna happen! Prov1800 can chime in on this one sweet."
6667350,Cgillespie,2022-06-24 13:02:00,120,"The lodge we stay at recommends $25 per day/person. We fished with a good one for five days, and I tipped $70, $50, $50, $50, and $100 for taking care of my wife and myself."
6667354,7 Mag,2022-06-24 13:19:00,1887,"I look at it as the same as a tip at a restaurant, for really good service 20-25%."
6667358,Eckohlt,2022-06-24 13:38:00,3685,What was the guide fee per day??without the tip.
6667368,Cgillespie,2022-06-24 13:57:00,120,"Don't know, it was baked into the price of the trip by the lodge. I'm sure I could go back and look at the difference between guided and unguided and figure it out. There is no way I'm going that far and not using a guide, especially on a huge lake."
6667370,Fisherman Ted,2022-06-24 13:57:00,461,$75 for a guide tip is a good tip. I've seen more or less. Guide tips in Montana for float trips are typically in the $100 range. In the keys they are north of that. $25-$50 for a guide tip for a full day is light.
6667374,Mojo-NC,2022-06-24 14:02:00,1929,"^^^ Yup, this! ^^^ I want to learn something from a guide. Location? Yes. Technique? Yes. Using a guide is all about where to go and what to do at that particular moment, not last week, or last month, or last year, but now. We only use a guide on unfamiliar waters. They can be worth their weight in gold. Our first trip up to Canada we used a guide. He put us on fish, showed us how to catch them, and cooked our shore lunch! We had the best time ever! I felt cocky one day and challenged our guide to a smallmouth fishing contest. I was using a Carolina-rigged Senko and he was using a tube. He put the smackdown on me. Lesson learned."
