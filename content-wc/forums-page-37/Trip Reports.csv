6670344,dakota eye,2022-07-04 18:07:00,69,Thx Pooch!
6670386,Bill Krejca,2022-07-04 19:27:00,6107,"Yeah, figure the clouds seen on the screen are mayfly nymphs rising to the surface, fish could be anywhere re: depth. Perhaps trying closer to the surface. Bill"
6670390,Golden Eagle,2022-07-04 19:40:00,2642,Hatch occurs at different times in different locations on a lake. Keep looking for trends and at all areas of the lake. It's a good time to fish moving water.
6670530,mwh624,2022-07-05 08:50:00,183,"Find the soft bottom areas in bays where the bug are hatching, some of the best fishing of the year."
6670182,IaDave14,2022-07-04 09:36:00,99,I really enjoy reading them but weeding thru all the stupid comments a few feel they have to add can be frustrating. For those few that feel they have to reply to every post why don't you take the time to post your trip report. I would rather see that then some replies that are only there to get attention or maybe you are practicing for a career in stand-up comedy.
6670190,Eckohlt,2022-07-04 10:03:00,3685,"Should have a report for ya come July 23,won't be long report,fishing details."
6670212,IaDave14,2022-07-04 11:00:00,99,That's great hopefully I will have one in Sept still trying to put a trip together.
6670214,Eckohlt,2022-07-04 11:04:00,3685,"Sept usually quite up there,should be able find a great place to go that time of year,I know that's my fav time to go,also going on a flyin sept24."
6670290,Pooch,2022-07-04 14:42:00,4618,"On Lac Seul right now. Fishing out of LSL. Fishing much slower than past trips. Really having to scrounge for fish of any size. The pattern is that there is not an obvious pattern. Few concentrated fish, just pick up a few here and there. Maybe one spot might give up three or four fish then the next you pick up one and the rest develop lock jaw. Fished Steamboat yesterday and caught a half dozen over slots with a 25.5"" (walleye) as largest. At most ten or twelve walleye all day Went to McKenzie today and did a little better though still below average. Highlight of my day was in one spot trolled up a Musky, a Northern, a walleye and a little Small Mouth witihin minutes of each other. Catching several large Jumbo Perch everyday. Never done that before. Still no ""numbers"" for our two man boat. Water clarity is mucky. LS appears up about two foot in the Bay of Islands area. Four days left. Pooch"
6670292,Eckohlt,2022-07-04 14:48:00,3685,Mayfly hatch going on??
6670306,Pooch,2022-07-04 15:35:00,4618,Mayflies covering boat in the mornings and some on the cabin exterior walls. That certainly is not helping fishing! Water clarity is cloudy. Pooch
6670308,dakota eye,2022-07-04 15:42:00,69,Hey Pooch what depth are you mainly in? Trolling or jig fishing buddy? Thx
6670310,Eckohlt,2022-07-04 15:51:00,3685,"4th of July here,do have any M-80's to drop that might wake'm up.Just kidding,keep pounding the water until you strike gold."
6670318,Pooch,2022-07-04 16:22:00,4618,"Probably 15 to 25' seems to hold better fish. Less than that and we are picking up Dinks. In or near weeds hold small fish hoping to survive long enough to become large fish!Trolling spinners with plastic or crawlers. Crawlers doing better than plastic. Though plastics did well first afternoon. Jigging is hit or miss same as trolling. Have pulled cranks, spinners, plastic, plain hook and leech all with the same results. Poor.In the evenings we are seeing unbelievable masses of fish in the 20' depth range. Something is happening to fill the screen with nearly solid fish arches. They are feeding on some kind of hatch or bloom that has attracted baitfish? Go through that same area the next morning and it is barren of marks.A very different trip this year.Pooch"
