6668858,Eckohlt,2022-06-29 04:47:00,3685,"You are right aspen cotton,I've been a tree trimmer now for 48 years."
6668860,pjshorthorn,2022-06-29 04:54:00,5654,Cottonwoods where I live were terrible this year. Walked out on morning in early June and the grass was covered .looked like it had snowed. Only experienced this issue in Canada and it wasn't too bad. PjShorthorn
6668866,ILScott,2022-06-29 05:25:00,139,"Was in Canada June 4th to the 11th. This cotton substance was awful and to make it worse we had no wind to push it to shore. The places I wanted to fish close to shore looked like you could walk on it because it was so thick. This made fishing hard. Plus when you got a fish on it would block top eyelet and couldn't reel in the fish. So my week had no wind, cotton substance and super high water but great weather. Scott"
6668868,10point,2022-06-29 06:32:00,102,Eagle lake first week of June. It was awful.
6668876,SterlingArcher,2022-06-29 07:07:00,92,"Poplar, ash, cottonwood and other trees all drop stuff like that in the spring. Not much to be done about it."
6668986,Eckohlt,2022-06-29 14:01:00,3685,That probably make some great cotton underwear.
6668708,ackvil,2022-06-28 15:23:00,177,"We were fishing in Lac Seul in early June. Every time the wind would blow - which was constant -a cotton-like substance would fall onto the Lake and end up on your fishing line. It would stick to the line and that would make casting difficult.The camp owner said the debris was from an Ash tree but to me it looked like something a cottonwood tree would have. Now that I am back in the U.S. I have attempted to remove the ""cotton"" substance from my fishing line. This has turned out to be a very difficult process. Has anyone experienced this problem? Is there a solution short of stripping all the line off of the reel? Thanks."
6668718,prov1800,2022-06-28 15:34:00,5010,Yup.went through that here for a couple of weeks.Stuck to braid real bad.I would just cut off my leader line and then yank it down to the end and it came off fairly easy that way but could not pick it off.That stuff has been gone now for a while.
6668720,Barley,2022-06-28 15:36:00,10,"We had the same thing happen on Shoal Lake a few years ago. The trees were shedding the stuff in bales all over the lake and it was fouling up our spinning reels, all of which are spooled with braided line. The fish were biting, as usual, but we could not fish in the usual way. I ended having to retrieve my lures with the tip of my rod under the water. Quite a hassle, but it worked."
6668734,wally28,2022-06-28 16:26:00,65,Probably Cottonwood
6668742,7 Mag,2022-06-28 16:31:00,1887,"The cottonwoods were really bad in northern Mn a couple of weeks ago, it was so bad I couldnâ€™t cast my line without it snagging on the eyelets. Had to constantly pull them off which was a pain, I would switch rods and let them dry, they seemed to pull off a little easier."
6668750,That Minnesota guy,2022-06-28 16:56:00,8293,You can try running the line through a small bead similar to a slip bobber bead. The bead should collect the debris and prevent it from getting to the reel. It will require cleaning so the closer to the end of the rod the better. I haven't tried this but i seems it might work.
6668774,Clairebear,2022-06-28 18:27:00,937,Cottonwoods and or poplar.
6668802,Lmbkiller,2022-06-28 20:10:00,639,"I seriously doubt there's cottonwoods 5hrs north of the us Canada border, gotta be some other tree"
6668804,mrwalleye5,2022-06-28 20:13:00,1922,Poplar and Ash. White fluff is hanging like jack rabbits.
6668820,prov1800,2022-06-28 21:18:00,5010,Would agree with the poplar
