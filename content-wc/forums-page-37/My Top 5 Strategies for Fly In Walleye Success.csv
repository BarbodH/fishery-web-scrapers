6668994,Peterpikes,2022-06-29 14:07:00,33,that is assuming a northern FLY-IN lake would be mapped on navionics.. most are not.[/QUOTE]Correct. I was just adding to what Mojo said about having the navionics chip. If your lake is mapped out and you don’t have depthfinder/gps this was a viable option. Even if the lake you’re fishing isn’t mapped out for depth it’s still nice to have gps navigation up there. It’s easy to get lost if on a new body of water.

Or you can use a little technology instead of looking at a paper map. Just letting people know there is an option that doesn’t include buying an expensive hand held GPS or depthfinder/GPS combo. Is it necessary? No. Is it piece of mind for someone making their first trip? Maybe. Not sure about where you go, but I fly-in to a large body of water and I will sometimes be 10+ miles away from camp. Throw in a bunch of islands that all look the same and it’s easy to second guess where you are. I went years without gps. Now I have it and I’m more comfortable exploring further away. Another major plus is I’m able to see the location of the 3 other boats in my group. If someone has engine problems or doesn’t show up for dinner we know exactly where to find them. To each his own I guess."

I am sure others have some great tips as well. Always great to share, especially for first or second timers or even for guys like me who live for a new tactichttps://www.northernjacks.com/post/t...fly-in-walleyeCheersAndrew"

6667132,SweetD,2022-06-23 19:28:00,243,"1. Get intel from group leaving the fishing grounds!2. Relax, the fish will come Just enjoy your surroundings and experience in the bush. It is a beautiful, magical place…..take it all in! 3. Slow down. Take time to fish the known areas. There are often times a spot within a spot where you will catch fish. 4. Spread out. If multiple boats everyone go to one of the marked spots and fish it and then share with the group if a hot bite!5. It’s not a contest. Help your compradres out and if someone is struggling offer some insights and assistance. Everyone will have a good time if you share the wealth and generally there are is plenty of wealth to be found on a fly in lake!Thanks for getting the juices flowing Northern Jack!!!!"

6668560,Mojo-NC,2022-06-28 07:22:00,1929,"Great list Gordy. The only point that you made that I somewhat disagree with is the importance of having a ""fancy"" fish finder. Can you get by without one? Sure, but...I think having a Navionics lake mapping chip in a fish finder with GPS functionality is critical, that is provided that the lake is mapped (not all are). We also studied the lake contour map on our computers prior to the trip. Those maps are not 100% accurate but are very close. Prior to leaving on our first trip to completely unfamiliar water, through our outfitter we were put in contact with a guy who had fished the lake for years. We were able to pick his brain for about 30 minutes one evening on a teleconference. During our discussion he even shared 3 waypoints with us to give us a good starting point. We then spent most of the first afternoon fishing the reef he identified and we laid down additional waypoints to mark the 25' contour line (his waypoints were from June and were much shallower than where we found the fish in September). Once we found that 25' magical depth, we applied it to pretty much the entire lake. Using that technique, we were able to lay down many other waypoints around the lake at various points, around islands, and along structure where we caught multiple fish. We found around 10 major places on the lake where we knew we could always go and catch fish. We would also often troll between the locations we identified (pulling spoons, crankbaits, spinner rigs, etc.), always trying to follow the magic 25' depth contour as closely as possible. That allowed us to find other places around the lake where it wasn't always obvious why fish congregated in those specific spots. We would pay attention to where those spots were and try to figure out why fish were there, and often times we would mark them too. As a side note, we fished the same lake 2 years later at the same time of year and all of the waypoints were still effective. We fine tuned them of course, but I'm sure if I provided you with those waypoints you could go fish the lake and immediately catch fish."
6668934,gordy28,2022-06-29 11:28:00,437,"So I totally agree. We started w basic finders and on small lakes they were fine. A few trips ago some of the guys invested in Helix 5 portables w GPS and the bottom mapping functionality. They are awesome, especially on big lakes. When we were on lake St Joe and explorer the maps were awesome as a few sections of the lake were maze like I just meant that at the bare minimum being something that shows depth and water temp. But if you have it or can afford it the systems w GPS are amazing Andrew"
6668948,proguidedream,2022-06-29 11:59:00,345,"couple things for the old school walleye guys.. switch to plastics. not just the classic ""power bait"" or a twister tail. Walleyes LOVE LOVE a ned rig ! if you catching them on jigging bait, put a ned worm on the jig, 2-3"" long. they will slurp it up and you will catch dozens of fish on the same bait.. if your big into pulling spinners or crawler harnesses, switch to plastics as well. i love pulling plastics behind a slow death hook or blade. the main benefit is the fish cannot steal your bait. so they generally keep biting untill you hook em. and the action is much better then a live leech or worm. casting paddle tails and dragging on bottom. get some nice Z-MAN minnowZ or similar . cast and retrieve slowly. them canadian walleys love it."
6668966,Peterpikes,2022-06-29 12:45:00,33,"Just an FYI for anyone without a fancy fish finder. You can download the navionics app on your phone, find your lake and download a selected area of the map. When up in the wilderness your phone obviously won’t have a phone signal, but the GPS function still works. You will have an interactive depth map that shows your exact location. Excellent for navigating and finding the structure and marking spots. If you put your phone in airplane mode and just use the app your phone battery will last 2 or 3 days. You can buy a usb charger on Amazon for around $15 that works off of AA batteries to top your charge off at night. Leaving in 3 weeks, can’t wait. Happy fishing fellas."
