6669096,troutwater,2022-06-29 21:25:00,299,"I'm up at Tamarack right now and brutal is right. No break from the howling wind all week and the storm surge messed up the maintenance shed, and the fish cleaning house is in really rough shape. The high water is crazy, a guy had to be towed back today because he tore his lower unit off hitting a reef/island that was once above water. I made it a point to go find the rocks Todd told me about and mark them on my Navionics app. Also found a reef that had a jug on it 3 inches underwater. As for the fishing....a lot of us are riding the struggle bus for muskie this week. I haven't even caught a pike for the week, thats never happened to me before. Walleye have been really good though"
6669142,Bill Krejca,2022-06-30 08:52:00,6107,"So sad to hear of all the heartaches caused by the high water, hoping camp folks recover from it, the last years have been hard on the camp owners - first covid with few customers and now this devastating high water. On another note re: fishing - if I had access to the applicable area, I would be spending some time fishing the Turtle Lake area. I assume the high water is rushing through the narrows and through the old portage creek bed at the end of the lake. Perhaps it is even going through the crank-over portage portion. At any rate, the current should be bringing in fish. Back in 1950, I stood on the bank near the old portage and caught as many fish in the current as a 12 year old could handle. Bill"
6669366,steve.a,2022-07-01 07:16:00,274,I just got back from Nestor Falls and the water was soo high that you had to get wet just getting to the floating docks but the fish did not care at all. The lake was a ghost town compared to pre covid times. Not sure if is more from gas prices or vaccine requirement but the lodge owners were singing the blues. Can not wait to get back on the last week of September!
6669382,prov1800,2022-07-01 07:57:00,5010,Water is going down in the vermilion bay bay area.I launch my boat all over the area by myself and still need to bring rubber boats or sandals to get to front of boat.The docks at most camps are back to normal.Definatly quieter still on the lakes and iam sure it's due to either vaccinations or fuel.But still leaning towards getting the shots.
6669404,walleyecheek,2022-07-01 09:53:00,2231,What lodge were you staying at ?
6669408,Short Strike,2022-07-01 10:48:00,56,Anyone know of any regularly updated web cams in the area to get visuals on water level fluctuations (wind driven) besides Red Wing's?Thanks
6669418,steve.a,2022-07-01 11:42:00,274,I stayed at C&C motel at Nestor Falls close to the public ramp. Will stay there in September also. Good people.
6667958,Obabikon,2022-06-26 09:48:00,2370,"Wow, the past few days have been tough to say the least. The wind surges can raise the water levels as much as 12"" in just an hour or two. Our camp has been very lucky, but many are struggling. Just a couple suggestions if you're making a trip. 1. Be prepared to get your feet wet. Pack extra shoes and rubber boots. All the boat launches and marinas are getting beat up. We're all doing the best we can, but mother nature is not cooperating. 2. Please be incredibly over the top considerate while boating. Do not do ""drive bys"" of camps... anywhere there's docks or cribbing, just assume it is a no wake zone. The damage some of the bigger boats can do with a wave is unbelievable. It's frustrating, because the culprits are typically gone by the time the waves crash in, and have no idea what they did. Be careful, be safe, be considerate. LOTW's is approaching the 1950 record. Actually, it is just a few inches away. It is more than a foot higher than the 2014 record. This morning at 6, aided by the wind, the water was more than 12 inches above where it was at the same time yesterday. This already has backed down, but we have not peaked. In Hanson bay, out of Morson... please be advised that has officially gone no wake."
6667960,That Minnesota guy,2022-06-26 09:58:00,8293,I saw you have a massive area of rain again this morning. Strong NW winds will also make things interesting. It has been a **** of a late spring / early summer. We are still sending you huge amounts of water from Rainy Lake......... you're welcome.
6668136,Further North,2022-06-26 19:43:00,2008,"We were there last week, on Whitefish Bay.Water is an easy 6 ft. above normal, and at least 12"" - 18"" deeper than when we were there for the 2014 high water event.That said, fishing was still very good, plenty of smallies, pike, several muskies and a 30"" walleye in the boat.Wind had more of an impact on fishing conditions than the high water did, IMO."
6668356,stumcfar,2022-06-27 13:27:00,451,"The resorts on the Rainy River and on the south shore of LOW on the Minnesota side were devastated this past weekend with very strong northwest winds. Many cabins flooded, boat docks destroyed. It is going to be tough for some of these resorts to get back in business for the rest of the summer. They will be able to do some things on a limited basis. I hope they all can get some aid and make it through year. Here is a picture of my camper on Sunday and this was one of the drier parts of the resort. I know this is a Canada thread, but just telling about the MN side since we share the same lake.https://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...1&d=1656357995 to next yea"
6668548,PRO-V16,2022-06-28 06:24:00,454,That picture looks like Morris Point Resort. My buddy's camper is just past yours. Not good.
6668578,stumcfar,2022-06-28 08:10:00,451,You are correct. People in a rental cabin woke up to several feet of water and waves Sunday morning and literally had to walk/swim to their truck and drive through bumper deep water to get out of there. The wind switched yesterday so hopefully has given some reprieve.
6668592,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2022-06-28 09:34:00,629,"Pictures taken Sunday PM of the devastation created to S. Shore resorts around the ""Bostic Crk area."
6668594,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2022-06-28 10:02:00,629,Still around Bostic Crk & Graceton Beach S. Shore! P.S. I apologize for the orientation of 3 of the Pics

6668796,PRO-V16,2022-06-28 19:45:00,454,Looks pretty bad &#x1f614;. I'd especially hate to be the new owners of Morris Point Resort. They just took possession of it the Wednesday before opener. Al and Michelle dodged a bullet there.
