You can fish all of Rough Rock and the current breaks to the White Dog dam. Just watch where the Rough Rock guide boats are fishing. If you want something closer to town you can start with the railroad bridge and the current breaks along the islands going north. I suspect there is a strong flow pushing north so the breaks in the main channel will be easy to find. Good luck up there. Jig and meat."

Not a lot of action on Big Sand yet, but I suspect will be when you get up there. But they where schooled up and plenty eaters to catch in Little Sand. Small mouth fishing was fantastic this year. Northern a bit slow, but good muskie bite. Water is about 5 1/2 foot higher than normal. Highest it has been since the 1950's I am told. Still rising a bit. Be careful of floating debris, docks, propane tanks and logs. Plenty out there. Good luck!"
