6664696,drlee,2022-06-14 21:56:00,409,"Right there with you. Crossed at PR every year for the past 20 years and it is a piece of cake. Last August, filled out the ARR CA forms and fully vaccinated. No issues. I would add that potatoes are a no no this year. We leave on Friday of this week and 10 guys in or crew. Our group goes every year. Stop in Upsula for lunch or all day breakfast and you will be rewarded!! Tight lines. from Doc Lee."
6666330,Rebel8,2022-06-21 14:51:00,49,"Crossed into Canada at PR on 6/11 at about 1:30 PM EST 2 lanes open 8-10 cars in each lane took 15-20 mins in line. Usual questions Any liquor, where ya staying, how long, etc. and NO eggs, poultry or chicken parts allowed, along with no live bait. Crossed back into the USA on 6/18 at about 11:15 AM EST they asked if we had any poultry I answered NO and they said welcome home. The line waiting to get into Canada was already across the bridge to the other side of the river. I am guessing 1+ hour wait as I have been there in years past. Fishing was definetly one of the better years as I have been going for 20 years. Mosquitoes and gnats were one of the worst in 20 years. Tight Lines"

6666522,Bfgilly,2022-06-22 08:15:00,18,"Just crossed on June 11, 2:00 pm. There were two lines open with a line of about 7 each. I tried to hand the ArriveCAN app to the agent, he said he did not want it. I then asked him if he wanted our shot records with the passport, he said he only wanted the passport. When he asked what alcohol we had, I went to hand him the receipt from the duty free store (since we were three cases of beer over) he said he didnâ€™t want it, he wanted me to tell him what we had. Although he was a little grumpy we crossed with no problems at all. Coming home there was no line, the agent took our passport & said welcome home. It seems like everything totally depends on the agent when crossing. Fishing was very good!Bfgilly"
6666554,Eckohlt,2022-06-22 10:17:00,3685,"He was grumpy cause your trying to hand him stuff,let him ask you what he wants next time,all's they want is your passport everything they need is inside the cover."
6666978,guidedfishing,2022-06-23 12:27:00,531,"Potato's are perfectly fine, just as long as they are commercially bagged grade #1 per the Canadian website no issue. Although we did not bring egg's we were not asked. The Canadian website said no eggs from the restricted states so we picked up on Ontario side no issue. Not sure where the no potato thing keeps cropping back up. Crossed a Pigeon river on Jun 10th, not an issue other than he did want to see our ArriveCan receipt because we were not showing complete in his system. Took a look at our paper receipt and said all good and we were on our way."
6667496,Mr Ranger,2022-06-24 20:05:00,272,"Crossed into Canada today at 4pm. Only car in line, less than five minutes."
6670496,Mr Ranger,2022-07-05 07:32:00,272,"We crossed into Canada on June 24 at 4pm we were the only truck, 3 minutes and we were in. We crossed into US on July 2 and were the fourth car. Again maybe three minutes and in. Easiest crossing ever."
6670500,Eckohlt,2022-07-05 07:41:00,3685,"It's seems very easy to get in and back,but I'm sure the random test is on everyone's mind when pulling up on the Canadian side,the best words heard at the crossing are,ok good to go have a nice trip."
6663646,kettyspanky,2022-06-11 12:27:00,271,Just wondering how the crossing is going at pigeon river? Anyone get the random? How are the wait times? We will be there in 5 weeks but was wondering how it is now. Thanks for any info.
6663672,elway12,2022-06-11 16:56:00,335,Would love to know this information as well. We will be going across at Pigeon on July 7 if all goes well. 26 Days!!!!!
6663674,andreindy,2022-06-11 17:00:00,308,Been 2 year wait for us.
6663686,jbohne,2022-06-11 18:06:00,6,Just went through on thursday 6/2 and it was a breeze. All 3 of my groups cars through in 10 minutes or less.
6663694,Jimmy Mac,2022-06-11 20:16:00,96,"I've crossed at Pigeon River four times since the border reopened last year. There were no issues. Make sure you use the Arrive Can Ap within 72 hours of crossing and remember you no longer need to show proof of a negative COVID test to enter Canada. I still like to have paper copies of my Arrive Can receipt, vaccine card, and passport in the event I suffer from a technology glitch. Related to any of my trips where I crossed at Pigeon River, no one I was traveling with were required to take the random COVID test that may be required by the Canadian Authorities. Lastly, make sure you check to see what you can bring across. The last I heard, live bait, eggs, and poultry were no no's. There may be other things too, so it'd be a good idea to do a little research in advance of your trip. I understand if you have any of the forbidden items, the Canadians make you take the stuff back to the states and dispose of them on U.S. soil. Good Luck!Jimmy Mac"
6663734,kettyspanky,2022-06-12 05:18:00,271,"I'm kinda curious on the wait times at the border. I know weekends are usually bad there. We are going July 16th and I'm going to try to get there before the ( noon crowd ) gets there. Last year we went the first weekend the border opened, that was a little over 2 hr wait. I'm hoping it's not that bad this time around."

6663850,kettyspanky,2022-06-12 12:17:00,271,I've looked at the list before. I don't believe its on there. If it is which one is it?
6664004,lawson2343,2022-06-13 07:09:00,459,"It's not on there. We crossed on Friday June 3 at 12:30 at Pigeon River. There was one line open. 11 vehicles ahead of us. Took us about 1/2 hour to get to window. Border agent was cordial and we got through quick after the usual questions. Coming back to US on Saturday June 11 at around 12:30 again, two cars ahead of us. US agent asked two questions and we were through. Looking across at the lines entering Canada, there were two lines open and maybe 10 deep in each line, so not bad for a noonish timeframe."
6664032,NAV165,2022-06-13 08:23:00,412,We crossed on June 1 around 1:00pm - one lane open no cars in front of us. Returned to the USA on June 7 around noon and no cars in front of us. Much better crossing than the last time I went via I-Falls.
