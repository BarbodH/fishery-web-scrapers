6669520,Prop Chopper,2022-07-01 19:34:00,18,I was up there end of may beginning of June. Pat hasn't sold it yet and I gathered that there is now a 20 percent surcharge for foreign buyers so that MAY slow sales down. Great camp. Excellent fishing.

6669356,rockape,2022-07-01 07:04:00,215,"I got back a week ago from Cedar Point Lodge. It was my first visit. Went with a friend that hooked up with a group that has been going there for 20+ years. I've stayed all over NW Ontario and fished most of the big lakes. This was the nicest and cleanest cabin I have ever been to. Air conditioning in a cabin? Yep! One day it was like 93 out. The AC and a cold beer were awesome when we came back in. They clean your fish for you too. I've eaten quite a bit when up there and here back home. Not a single bone!!! Boats were great too. Lots of great fishing spots close by. The fishing was great. Be on a good spot, wait for the feeding window, and get ready for a fish on almost every cast. I had a few beers with Pat. Great guy. Yes the place is for sale and it was not sold as of a week ago. I can tell you for sure that they aren't slacking off. Like I said, great cabins, great boats, great service, and a good vibe. Enjoy your stay!!!"
6669358,7 Mag,2022-07-01 07:06:00,1887,Thanks i appreciate the info!
