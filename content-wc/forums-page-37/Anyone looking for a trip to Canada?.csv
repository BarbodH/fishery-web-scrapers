6668862,english bob,2022-06-29 05:11:00,14,We have an opening for one person to join five guys on their trip to Root Bay Outpost with Slate Falls Outposts from September 2nd to September 7th. There is a seat available in our van leaving 25 miles south of the Twin Cities on September 1st. All you need to do is turn up with your personal and fishing gear as everything else is arranged. Send me a PM if you are interested.

6669014,bthomas3333,2022-06-29 15:44:00,465,Jeez thought it was free.
6669028,reddemon2,2022-06-29 16:25:00,255,5 guys in a van sounds horrible
6669030,Eckohlt,2022-06-29 16:27:00,3685,"Might even be a mini van,plus gear,not sure though."
6669076,bthomas3333,2022-06-29 19:47:00,465,All kidding aside this is a great time to be in NW Ontario. Ill be elsewhere in Canada this week but get time of year.
6669086,SweetD,2022-06-29 20:39:00,243,"English Bob, we are at Root Bay 7/14-7/23 so will let you know if any eyes remain after we put a whoop’n on em! We were with Ryan at Arc last Fall 9/4-9/13 and had a spectacular week of weather and fishing. Man, If I could make it work would I love to make it back for another sampling of the pin cushion. Good luck. I remember seeing on the share a seat forum a single was looking to join a group. May want to take a look over there!!"
6669274,Mark R,2022-06-30 19:33:00,1538,It’s not 5 guys in a van it’s 6 I think I would do a little meet & greet before 9/1
6669452,reddemon2,2022-07-01 15:37:00,255,"My math is not very good lol, Anything more than 2 guys is too many in any kind of vehicle"
6669462,walleyecheek,2022-07-01 16:01:00,2231,That's what two men and a truck said !!!
