6665130,Eagle1,2022-06-15 20:36:00,28,"We drove up from Wisconsin on Saturday 6/4, arriving at the border around 2:00pm. The line was long, wrapping around on Hwy 11 about a mile or so. It took 1hr 45min to finally get through the border. Typical questions, plus they added the poultry/egg questions this year. All 6 of us had the ArriveCan filled out, so we just handed them our passports and everything was in there. No random testing for us thankfully. It was sad to see all the flooding on the Rainy River, with many homes being sandbagged along the river. We stayed in Vermillion Bay, then drove up to Clark's on Sunday morning via the detour around 105. The detour probably added 30 minutes to the trip, yet it was scenic. On the way back we just went around the road closed signs and stayed on 105. The Buller Creek bridge was dry then. We flew out Sunday morning for our 50 minute flight, and were fishing by 11am.Kapikik is a large lake, 7 x 14 miles, with plenty of islands and moving water. The water level was historically high. We're guessing that it was at least 3-4 feet higher than the other years we've been here. This caused many of the landmarks that I've used to not be there, as they were under water. We also found that due to the heavy current in some areas, the walleyes were moved slightly off of our normal spots. Fishing was incredible! We do fish fairly hard, putting in at least 12 hours each day. The best bite was always from 8-10pm, which was unbelievable some nights, though we found fish throughout the day. Water temp was 51F when we arrived, and hit 58F when we left the following week. Air temps were as low as 38F and might have hit 65F later in the week. We only had a couple instances of rain, but the wind made it challenging at times. The females were spawned out, though some of them had their spent ""egg sack"" hanging out. There were a few males that were still ""milking"", though not many.Our group of 6 caught 4956 total fish, 275 of them northerns and the rest walleyes with a few saugers mixed in. We use clickers to count the fish. Most of the pike were caught while jigging for walleyes. We had 4 instances during the week of guys boating 200+ fish. We had 15 northern 35"" plus, and 11 walleyes 24"" plus. Biggest pike was 39-1/2"" and big walleye was 26-1/2"". Jig and the Clark's supplied minnows were the bait of choice, though we also used plastics occasionally when we ran low on minnows. It was so good to finally be back on a Canadian lake, eating fresh walleyes and hearing the Loons calling out to each other at dusk. We were all very pleased with the trip, as Clark's run a top-notch operation. Looking forward to going back again in 2023...or sooner!"
6665140,SterlingArcher,2022-06-15 21:01:00,92,Sounds like a great trip! I should bring my clicker along this year to count fish.
6665144,prov1800,2022-06-15 21:38:00,5010,Whow what a trip.sometimes interesting when things change and you have to adjust.
6665222,SweetD,2022-06-16 08:25:00,243,Was at Kapikik many years ago. Was a fun lake to fish for sure. I recall making runs to Jackpine Lake (I think that was the name) and fishing a little inlet there full of Pike. Also caught piles of walleyes at the channel entering Jackpine lake. I can imagine the Cat river inflow and sections were near impossible to fish with water so high. Sounds like it didnâ€™t really matter!!!Love hearing from others about their trips. PS Better keep your reservation at Kapikik for 2023 next year as sounds like it can be a challenge to get in.
6670338,kona77,2022-07-04 17:37:00,236,"Our group also just returned from a trip to Kapikik and had a great week of fishing. Walleye's were plentiful and the Northern's were very active chasing walleye's at the boat (the most I have seen in 25+ trips).. We actually netted 34"" and 35"" Northern's that attacked a 17"" walleye and 19"" Northern at the boat and would not let go .. Most fish caught in moving water which makes the 16""-19"" walleye's feel even bigger in the current. Biggest walleye for the week was 26"" and Northern was 40"". Very windy the last 3-4 days which forced us to stay closer to the cabin but the great thing is 2-3 of the best spots are very short boat rides and offer some shelter. Bought shorts and some tee-shirts but never wore them with the cooler/windy weather. Actually prefer the cooler weather. Cabin is just great with lots of room, running generator at night and lots of freezer space. Minnows are always a nice bonus but once we found active fish we just switch to Berkley/Gulp minnows and other plastics. Kept track one night and caught 21 walleye's on the same Berkley power minnow . Our group had two medical emergencies in the last few weeks and we almost cancelled. The Clarks' were very accomodating to our group and we were so thankful for their efforts to switch dates around for us. 10th trip on five different lakes with Wayne/Karla and all have been great trips. Looking forward to 2023.."
