6665498,Mr Ranger,2022-06-17 14:35:00,272,Thanks all for input. Will see what it looks like next Friday. Sure they are blasting north on 61 somewhere anyways You all drive safe.

6665510,kettyspanky,2022-06-17 16:05:00,271,Mr. Ranger let us know how 61 is also. I saw on the website there was alittle construction by twin ports I believe. I'll be heading that way in a month. Thanks
6665514,Larry S,2022-06-17 16:21:00,665,Coming up 35N from Minneapolis is there any screwed up detour to connect to H wy61?
6670498,Mr Ranger,2022-07-05 07:37:00,272,We went through Duluth on June 24 at noon. Followed the detour signs. Other than waiting for a train no issues. Came home on July 2 at noon. 53 exit east was closed and detour took us to Hwy 2 Bong Bridge. No delays again. MAJOR redo of the whole interchange. Will be nice when it's done. Travel safe.
6670504,DeBo,2022-07-05 07:55:00,211,As of my two trips in mid to late June no issues. There was a little construction on 35 closer to the cities but only slowed us a little bit traveling up on a Wednesday morning. No issues in Duluth going from 35 to 61. They are doing lots of work but there are 2 lanes each direction so no big deal. 61 there are a couple of construction zones east of Two Harbors. One around Betty’s Pies and another one east a bit. No issues although towing a boat through there isn’t a real treat with lots of oncoming traffic.
6670510,That Minnesota guy,2022-07-05 08:12:00,8293,They are resurfacing but they have a crossover so it will be fine.
6664964,Mr Ranger,2022-06-15 13:13:00,272,"Having lost our last three trips to Canada I missed the fact that the major interchange in Duluth with 53 and I35 is doing a three year make over. Badly needed. We leave next week Friday from Wausau, WI to Nakina ON. I see Google has a detour going both ways via Garfield Ave in Duluth. Another note I saw suggested taking the Bong Bridge over then north on I35. Just curious if anyone has gone this way in the past 30 days and any suggestions. Thanks"
6665020,patricktjms,2022-06-15 15:10:00,67,Also curious
6665028,N_of_Quibell,2022-06-15 15:25:00,151,"I went thorough there both ways a couple of weeks ago. Going north, I got off of 53 and followed 2 through Superior across the Bong to I believe 35 briefly to 2, then to 33, and back to 53. Same coming home. I tow a small camper trailer, and the Blaknik bridge on 53 always gives me the willies anyway - I'll be taking the Bong in the future, construction of not. I'm not saying it's any shorter, but I liked it. Hint - coming south on 53, be careful not to turn prematurely onto 33, unless you'd like a scenic tour of St. Louis Cty backroads;-)"
6665032,Mr Ranger,2022-06-15 15:28:00,272,LOL on the good tip. Appreciate the insight and will keep that as a solid plan. Glad you made is safely my friend.
6665034,SterlingArcher,2022-06-15 15:34:00,92,The Bong is the way to go.
6665046,7 Mag,2022-06-15 16:11:00,1887,"I went through there last weekend, no issues following the detour signs."
6665068,Eagle1,2022-06-15 17:16:00,28,"I also drove up last week from Wausau, WI. I followed the detour without any issues, and got through the cities promptly. On the return trip this past Sunday, my navigation unit wanted me to turn quite a bit earlier, but I just followed the detour signs again without any problems!"
6665094,Bill Krejca,2022-06-15 19:08:00,6107,"Have fun, Jerry, say hello to Bob (and Shelly) for me! Bill"
6665338,Mr Ranger,2022-06-16 20:08:00,272,Will do Bill. Miss ya Buddy.
6665438,camp chef,2022-06-17 09:05:00,915,We came back 2 weeks ago. One vehicle took one route. The second rig took the other. We both arrived at Gronks for lunch about the same time.
