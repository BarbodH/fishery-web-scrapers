6668996,Peterpikes,2022-06-29 14:14:00,33,Has anyone been up to the Gouin recently? I heard the water level was very low last year and was wondering the status of it currently. Thanks

Norman, Jesse and Danielle (the care taker) are awesome and make our trip exceptional. The water level is not low. It's very high. Some of the highest we've seen. But it was declining as the week went on. Conditions were really tough. LOTS OF WIND AND RAIN. Some days we needed to pull up on a bank to ride out the waves. Really cold. I had a winter hat on most of the days. It was in the 40ies one night. Fishing was tough too. Our group does not keep exact counts of fish caught. We are there to get away from the exactities of real life.lol. We estimate that we usually catch 60-80 fish a day per guy. We caught maybe 75 each guy for the whole week. According to the people at camp they did worse. The care taker said fishing was tough all June due to the weather. We caught enough Walleye to have two meals and take fish home so we accomplished our goal. We found trolling around 20 feet was our best depth. Greens and bright colors worked best. Perch colors were good as well. Jigging was tough. We could not find leeches so we used worms. We normally don't use plastics but we went to white single tails with worms and the jigging picked up. Depths varied. Throwing spoons in the weeds for pike was tough due to the wind. We found some protected areas and back bays to spoon but had some varying results. Two guys in our group did catch 40 inchers which was great. One caught on a half wave and one caught on a Frisbee made by Sutton spoons tackle company in Naples NY. GREAT UNKNOWN SPOON!!!! Hope you have a great trip!!!!"
