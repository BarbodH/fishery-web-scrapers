6663210,Mr Ranger,2022-06-09 12:52:00,272,I have not seen any reference to wearing of face masks at border or within Canada. Are they still required anywhere?
6663256,muskyman73,2022-06-09 17:47:00,401,Do they require people to have their boosters as well as both vaccines ?
6663260,pan-man,2022-06-09 17:48:00,299,"I have been twice since opener. None of the stores (5) I went into to required masks but encouraged social distancing. On second trip, a Canadian border guard handed me a mask to wear when talking to him. Did not require my passenger. So on safe side maybe where mask when talking to Canadian border guard??"
6669110,guidedfishing,2022-06-30 05:48:00,531,Just a friendly reminder that the ArriveCan App recently updated and the new version is now V3.0.2. The content is relatively the same and subtle changes on different screens.

6669130,Pooch,2022-06-30 07:17:00,4618,Seems there is always conflict between the border folks and the suits. Our local sheriffs department is short staffed on the street and within the jail guard positions. Those close to retirement bailed and new hires are scarce. This whole labor shortage thing I do not get a clear picture of nor understand. Pooch
6669134,Honkerslayer,2022-06-30 07:54:00,238,We went up June 3. Didn’t wear a mask at any point and never saw anyone else wearing one that I recall. Our travel route is Manitoba/Sask border. Border crossing was a breeze. Less than 5 min.
6669214,hoppy63,2022-06-30 11:48:00,367,We crossed at the Soo. There is signage requiring masks when you pull UT to window.
6669250,pjshorthorn,2022-06-30 16:13:00,5654,"Just filled out my ArriveCAN info this morning. They only ask for the type ( Pfizer vs. others), the date and country. You fill out the app for 1 st and second shot info. No booster info needed. PjShorthorn"
6662662,Andre (wallyandre),2022-06-07 19:08:00,2274,In the last month I cross 6 times back and forth and never had any problem. Fill-up the ArrivCan the day prior crossing and everything went smooth.
6662694,Lmbkiller,2022-06-07 23:34:00,639,"Dumbest thing a border guard could ever say Not sure what they're doin or what they're worried about but when I crossed 2 days before Canada walleye opener there was 7 vehicles in front of mine and from the time I got in line til I got back in my truck after paying some duty, 55min, sorry but that's absolutely ridiculous. The guy at the booth wrote down word for word every answer to every question he had, that I gave him. Most were redundant questions I'd already filled out on ArriveCAN. Easily one of the dumber crossings I've ever had out of 50 or so I've done. And I'm over their country their rules. To me it seems like tourists really still aren't wanted. Canada should be careful what it wishes for"
6662704,walleyecheek,2022-06-08 04:32:00,2231,Well you have to take into consideration that they are scraping the bottom of the barrel for help ! Nobody wants to do that kind of work !
6662708,Eckohlt,2022-06-08 05:01:00,3685,"I'll do it,just as long as the people that drive up to the booth don't wake me up,they can just drive through,wonder if I get payed weekly or every other week,can you check into that for me cheeks??"
6662728,Bill Krejca,2022-06-08 06:48:00,6107,"My experience has been if the fellow is writing down my answers, he(she) will proceed to do a check down search of my vehicle/boat. At a minimum, come out and look things over very thoroughly. Bill"
6662738,stumcfar,2022-06-08 07:15:00,451,"Yes, he had received the second shot but prior to 21 days being up. Luckily he had gotten his booster!"
6662760,NM_Trout,2022-06-08 07:53:00,1094,"I would say yes. I work in high tech and I trust none of it :-) Plus, I think the only document other than your passport (or other official statement of citizenship) is your Vax card. I taped my vax card in the back of my passport, so not much effort is spent."
6662844,guidedfishing,2022-06-08 11:15:00,531,"Yup Agree, passport and hardcopy of vaccination record. + ArriveCan properly submitted with receipt of submission. Not much to argue with that on hand."
6662918,walleyecheek,2022-06-08 15:11:00,2231,"I went ahead and checked on that for ya Eck ! Turns out they pay you with ""confiscated"" night crawlers and then it's up to you to get as much per dozen that you can !"
6662988,Eckohlt,2022-06-08 17:08:00,3685,"I'll get premium price for them,I'll own that bridge in no time!"
6661888,redcopper,2022-06-05 15:53:00,6,"Nope no bait. We have been crossing on and off for 40 years and am well aware of that problem. Covid border closures kept us away from crossing for the past two years. Three years ago all we needed was our passports. Our friends in Canada never told us about the app and we had our passports & covid cards. So no- us down here in the mid-west were uninformed. I told my neighbor who is flying with her family to B.C. this week. She said that after making her flight bookings, an agent called her back to inform or ask her if they had completed ArriveCan. She did so then. Lucky for them."
6661892,Eckohlt,2022-06-05 16:03:00,3685,"Well you should be dialed in now on what to do next time around,hoping sometime down the road they ease up on requirements.Did you catch some fish??"
6661906,redcopper,2022-06-05 16:36:00,6,Never got a chance this time. We were archery bear hunting and all three of us were successful.
6661908,Eckohlt,2022-06-05 16:38:00,3685,Lol no wonder you didn't have any bait!

I have cell service and so does Pat for Canada on my phone so you can use phone if you need too on trip to n Caribou Larry S"
6662454,phishfearme,2022-06-07 09:29:00,1242,"Thanks Larry - good to know your calling plan works in Canada - Joe's does also. we are flying from the US to Toronto/Thunder Bay and i hope the Customs/ArriveCan process is as easy as you found driving across the border. We plan to enter our ArriveCan data when the permitted window opens (three days before we arrive) - i did a dry run doing this and i hoped to be able to ""Save"" it all but that option did not appear - only a block saying that i was not in the permitted time window. let's hope the weather will be better. phish"
6662472,NM_Trout,2022-06-07 09:53:00,1094,"When you open the ArriveCan app on your phone, you are in the home screen. Note that there is a ""travelers"" tab down at the bottom of the phone. You can pre-load your traveler information there. Upload passport information and a copy of your vax card too. You can get most of the info done there, and then add in the travel dates when you get in your 3 day window."
6662498,bigwalleye1,2022-06-07 11:48:00,2632,Is it worth the effort to bring sling in hard copy the documents that you upload ?
6662508,stumcfar,2022-06-07 12:11:00,451,"We had a guy in our group who was a part of the initial Phizer study group. He had received his first dose in June of 2020. Because he was part of a study group, they didn't wait 21 days to give the 2nd dose. Had he not gotten a booster at some point the border agent said he would not be allowed in because his first two shots were not at least 21 days apart."
6662628,Lktrician,2022-06-07 17:37:00,32,So did he actually get the second shot but was denied because it was not 21 days after the first one?
6659522,bthom,2022-05-27 10:04:00,9,I called ArriveCan regarding travelers grouped together on one arrivecan app. Was told as long as everyone is in the same vehicle you're good.
6660466,phishfearme,2022-05-31 08:04:00,1242,"this no longer works - i tried and the ""save"" option does not appear - and called the help line and was informed that even if you ""fake it out with a date that is within the 3 day window"" it requires that you submit it and cannot save it. this option was available to us last year but no longer. phish"
6660568,guidedfishing,2022-05-31 12:07:00,531,"Phish, I though well that sucks, but then I went and confirmed that I did have the latest version which I do V2.29.6 and when I opened the App up it took me right to where I left off. I went through and completed everything and at the end it gave me the option to Save and Close just like it always have. I then exited the App and signed back in and it came right back to where I was so basically it still works. I don't really consider faking it out. I am just not sending it in. Still works the same for me. I did see they added the requirement for the address back into the latest version again. Same as it was when I went last year. Thanks"
6660570,Golden Eagle,2022-05-31 12:08:00,2642,"It was available for me when I crossed the border May 19, 2022. Same for 6 others in our party."
6660612,phishfearme,2022-05-31 13:57:00,1242,hmmm - maybe it's because i'm using a PC laptop rather than the phone app. the agent was clear though that you can't save and you must submit - maybe not for the phone though. what do you guys do for using a phone in Canada? do you have a calling service usable in Canada? i don't and that's what is driving me to do the PC route. phish
6660736,Nimitz,2022-06-01 06:37:00,20,I am filling out the ArriveCan 72 hour notice. How accurate do you have to be on the arrival time in Canada? We are driving. I am sure I can get within +/- of an hour of arrival time. Just wanted to know what others have done that worked. Thanks!
6660764,Andre (wallyandre),2022-06-01 07:51:00,2274,"The time is not that important, it's the date of your arrival that is."

6661872,redcopper,2022-06-05 15:30:00,6,"We arrived at Slt. Sainte Marie on Friday May 20th, totally unaware of the ArriveCan requirement until being directed back across the International Bridge by the Canadian Border Patrol to return to the USA and downland the app. Fortunately the US Border Patrol was very understanding and allowed us to park and complete the process if possible without paying another set of tolls. Doing this in the front seat of my pickup was a challenge and it took over an hour for us to complete this entry process for the three of us. Covid card entries & pictures, passport pictures, and we have never had an address for ""bear camp', we had to call and get an address to include. We then went back across the bridge to now find a new Canadian Border Patrol agent on duty, who was totally unaware of us already being there and answering all of the other agent's questions successfully. Finally we were permitted to proceed. Shortly thereafter, my phone began to act strangely. It would not show any navigation, internet, and kept rebooting on and off. I have an international plan so it wasn't my plan. On May 28th after re-entering the USA my phone shut off completely and when we got back to Nebraska I made a visit to the cell phone repair store. My phone had and still has a malware problem that even after deleting the ArriveCan app is causing me problems. It may take a factory re-boot to fix the issue-but it began with the ArriveCan app. I hope no one else experiences this problem. We are no strangers to crossing the border into Canada. But we had no knowledge that this was needed and found it difficult to complete. I would suggest anyone needing the ArriveCan app, do this procedure from home and not the front seat of your vehicle."
6661880,Eckohlt,2022-06-05 15:42:00,3685,"I find it very hard to believe you have not heard about the requirements to cross,it's been going on like,it seems forever now.hope you didn't have any bait with you?"

6657210,Riding high,2022-05-18 13:49:00,69,I can tell you one thing that if you don't finish the arrivecan you won't get in. They run my passport last year and he said I hadn't sent the arrivecan. I said I thought I did but couldn't get past a certain question. He took my phone cause that's what I filled it out with. He finished it for me laughed run my passport again and it showed up. We made fun of how illiterate I was with modern technology and was free to go. Nicest agent I've ever dealt with.
6657262,SJC305,2022-05-18 16:29:00,154,I wanted to follow up on the previous question of adding people (other than direct family/spouse/children etc.) I have a trip with two uncles coming up and was going to originally add their info to my arrivecan app to have it all together. Now I'm second guessing myself. Anyone have trips through were they added fishing partners and got over okay?
6657292,hoppy63,2022-05-18 17:50:00,367,Any info on these questions?

I did load my passport and Vaccine data and used the 'save"" button under the Traveler's section. Our trip is at the end of June and I know you are supposed to load the rest of the data 3 days before your trip. I see some folks have mentioned loading the rest of the data but then do not use the submit function. My question is are you guys just entering a date within the 3 day window just so you can proceed ?? I see it also asks for a time when you will arrive at the border. I know we have a general idea but of course we could be off by an hour or two. Assume that should not be an issue. How much more data do you have to load after you enter the entry data ?? Thanks in advance for any feedback.."
6656460,RRK285,2022-05-16 11:04:00,44,Do you need cell service to run the app and access the docs or are the saved within the app?
6656490,guidedfishing,2022-05-16 12:12:00,531,"Your data is saved within the App. However, you need internet connection to access the app, update, and submit. There does not appear there is a way to work on the app off line.kona, yes you can just pick a date time within the current 3 day window and complete everything in the app, its even easier now than it was before April. When you get to the end just hit save and close do not hit submit. just come back and update when your are in the window for your arrival then submit."

6656896,kettyspanky,2022-05-17 15:46:00,271,"I know the app gives you a confirmation number. I printed it out on paper. They border agents didn't ask for it but I guess they can. We don't have service at the pigeon river crossing. We didn't have trouble last year so, I guess I did it right. I filled out the app stuff the day we left. I'm not sure if that helps you or not."
6657052,RRK285,2022-05-18 07:01:00,44,"Yea, that is my question. I lose service always once I get to Int.Falls. Can i open the app if needed?"
6657086,elway12,2022-05-18 07:59:00,335,"The way I have been told it works is that once you enter all of your travel information into the ArrivCAN app then the border agents will have it/be able to access it. You don't have to have the app ""open"" at the border station. Still have your passport and vaccination cards ready to be inspected when you cross."
6657162,kettyspanky,2022-05-18 12:10:00,271,I believe you are right elway. When you go on the app and submit it everything should be in it. My understanding was if you had the confirmation number you were good to go. That means you accept everything that you put in the app and the app accepted it also. Pretty hard to change it when there is no service. Good luck.
6654856,Andre (wallyandre),2022-05-09 14:44:00,2274,You present your passport has you always did before. The ArrivCan is link to your passport
6654868,Eckohlt,2022-05-09 15:18:00,3685,"Andre is right,just let the border ask what he wants before you start handing him stuff.It will go very smooth if everything is filled out correct."

6654974,pjshorthorn,2022-05-10 05:19:00,5654,I bought a document holder that your passport and vax card fit in so both are visible when opened. One thing to hand them now that we don't have to have a negative test copy with us. PjShorthorn

6654850,elway12,2022-05-09 14:21:00,335,A question for those of you that have gone across the border last year or this year. Are you required to physically show your passport and/or vaccination cards? I am assuming you don't have to since everything is downloaded and read thru ArriveCAN app. **I plan on bringing my physical passport and vaccination card with me either way**
6642016,hoppy63,2022-03-21 18:23:00,367,"I crossed last year I believe 2 days after border opened. I was all nervous because I am not the most computer literate and I was worried about a small mistake could cost us our trip. After doing it and passing through border in less than 5 minutes, the weight or (wait) of the world was lifted off of chest. I just dont remember all the particulars. Question here is I believe it has to be submitted within 72 hrs of crossing but 1) Do you need to upload Vax card and passport again? 2) Can you fill it all out early, like anytime, except for your ETA of crossing, and submit it within 72 hrs? Any ideas or thoughts on this???"
6642072,guidedfishing,2022-03-22 06:29:00,531,"Hoppy, new trip/crossing equaled a new upload of passport and Vax card for me. It did not store my information from the previous trip which I thought was a little inconvenient, but not a big deal. Yes you can fill it out early and let is sit as long as you don't submit, You just need to put the dates when you are making updates no further than 72hrs out. Just don't hit submit and come back and adjust dates.I have not seen any recent updates come out for ArriveCAN on the appstore as of yet. It still asks if you have proof of a valid negative test result which is to be expected since the requirement does not change until Apr 1 so I would expect an update to the App to come out near that date. My only suggestion is be patient, as it all settles out and any updates come out to the App. Hopefully by the time May rolls around things will be a pretty straightforward."

6642114,maddogg,2022-03-22 08:52:00,178,About the ArriveCAN app what if I don't have a cell phone?
6642120,Eckohlt,2022-03-22 09:19:00,3685,Laptop or desk top will work if you have either.
6642122,guidedfishing,2022-03-22 09:19:00,531,"A couple options, you can fill out the ArriveCAN on a desktop/lap top PC, or if you are going with a group of folks you can consolidate the ArriveCAN on one persons phone and submit as a group. Good for families with younger adults and kids, or groups of guys. One can manage all, you still need to give them your info to upload into the App."
