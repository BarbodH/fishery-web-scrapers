1843961,Guest,2013-06-06 15:30:00,0,"I fished Glitter Lake in the late 1980s. I recollect the cabin being nice. The boating equipment was more than adequate but not extravagant. I didn't have any kind of boating sonar/gps equipment, so we flew by the seat of our pants. There were no maps of the lake available at that time either. I recall that we had nice fishing for walleyes and small mouth bass. I recollect that we caught a lot of our walleyes off of a point diagonally across the lake, in around fifteen feet of water. The fish moved into the bay as the morning sun climbed in the sky. I also remember hitting a rock spire in deep water on the way to/from this point. All in all, it was a good trip. I also recall that the folks on the trip agreed to keep walleyes for a fish fry the first night. One of the couples had their fish with strawberry jam spread over the fish."

Walleyes can be caught right in front of the cabin in 10-20 ft. We also had lots of success by the two small islands. Most walleyes come by way of jigs and crawlers or Gulp. Most are the 15-21"" variety although last year we had a 27"" and 28"". Northerns are abundant. Our biggest is a 43"" and came on a 6"" Jake bait. But we had some high 30""ers on cleos and spinnerbaits. Smallies are also in front of the cabin by the island. Topwaters, Rapala skitterpops, and spinnerbaits. Plenty in that 16-20"" range. Although we caught plenty of smallies among the walleyes on jigs too. NWO now has a map on their webpage so that helps alot. Cabin is comfortable and you will enjoy the evenings on the deck. The lake is also small enough that should a storm be brewing, you have time to get back to the cabin. One downside is the lack of areas for a shore lunch but a few exist on the opposite side of the lake from the cabin by the outlet stream. If you have any further questions let me know."
1849473,stumcfar,2013-06-08 22:04:00,451,"Do you bring a flat of crawlers? Do you bring minnows? Any tips on things we should bring? This is our first fly-in. If you could, you can email me at [email protected] . Thanks. It is great to hear from someone who goes there. Are there rocks to worry about?"
1849817,Guest,2013-06-09 07:16:00,0,"As I mentioned above, I was at Glitter Lake about twenty years ago. All in all, it was a great trip with good memories. I suggest that you contact your outfitter and see what he/she has to say about bait availability. Back then, I took in with me around ten dozen minnows that I bought from the outfitter and were placed in plastic bags. The minnows died after a few days, but were kept cold. They still worked great. If I were to go today, I would also bring in nightcrawlers and leeches. This is the time of the year when one type of live bait can be hot today and cold tomorrow. The leeches will do double duty for the smallies. Rock hazards are absolutely normal for lakes on the Canadian Shield. Have your outfitter mark up a map of known hazards. The general rule of thumb is to ""stay in the middle"" and avoid cutting corners and be careful near shore. You might want to spend a part of your first day or two trolling around the lake to get a feel for the layout. Ask your outfitter if he/she puts out marker buoys for known hazards. I mentioned that I tagged a rock spire in what otherwise appeared to be deep water. I hope that your group has a great trip!"

1857561,Pikeslayer8,2013-06-11 16:17:00,1460,"I fished Glitter a couple times some 35 years ago. As I remember, there was a small sand/gravel channel that Is so clear you were sight fishin walleyes. I believe it is near the south end of the lake. Have fun and let NWO take care of ya. Brad, Chris and Brian are the best bust pilots around. IMHO"
3210593,jwcedar,2014-09-29 18:49:00,1,"I have been there about 20 times and the lakes South, Shakag, Pipio, Dasant, Pallete Bell. We have used it for moose hunting and fishing. All we use is salted minnows. Buy shiners in Wisconsin and salt them and let them dry in the sun until they are like cardboard & put them in the freezer. You can catch all the fish you want anytime of the year. We have closed it up in late October and were the 1st ones in in May a couple of times. There is so many placs to catch fish that vary during the year. The outside cooker at the cabin is hard tto beat for shore lunch. I read that somebody complained about no place for shore lunch. Use that little island on the RH side before you go thru the narrows on the South end. The glacier has made a nice natural boat ramp and it has been brushed and we hung a sign. We were the guys that put the arch top window in the cabin. The Northern Wilderness folks really take care of a person. They even flew in a Birthday cake and ice cream for my 50th when they were picking up moose meat. Great place and I tell people my dog could catch fish at Glitter. We started back in 1991 1st moose hunt and 4 moose for 4 guys and we've had a couple trips with 50""+ bulls opening day and 3 moose by noon on the 2nd day. GREAT JOB NWO"
