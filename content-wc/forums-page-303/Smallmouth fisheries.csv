The Cliff Lake launch is right on 105, literally. Every time you've driven up 105 to Ear Falls you could spit on the launch if your window was down as you went by! If you remember seeing the small RV park on the bluff on Cliff (west side of 105), the public launch is just south of there.P.S. The Cliff Lake launch is quite decent and easy. However, you back in between two rocks, one of which is often hidden by grass. Those rocks can take trailer tail lights off! Yea . . . don't ask."

3201562,skindzier,2014-09-25 07:03:00,137,"Kakagi (Crow) Lake near Nestor Falls is a great smallmouth lake. Lake Trout & muskies too. No walleye in Kakagi, however several of the resorts on Kakagi share a launch on Lake of the Woods, which is literally across the street from Kakagi."
3201626,prov1800,2014-09-25 07:19:00,5010,Both lakes have a public launch.they are so so.but useable.if your on lac suel theres no need to travell for smallmouths ascthere is awesome bass fishing there and i would say larger fish at that.dont hear much about them as there are not many fisherman targeting them.my largest smallmouth to date came of lac seul at 23 1/2 inches.right now at this time of the year is the best time to fish for them.they are all sitting on a shallower hump and are very aggressive.walleyes are ten ft below them.lakes are starting to turn over as all species are on the move.
3201906,Thompmd,2014-09-25 08:45:00,320,"Thanks to everyone for the response(s). I am currently researching the suggestion(s) and have some interest in Young's combo trip having part of the week in camp and part in a fly-out to Kishkutena. I tried sending them an email for some more information but for some reason their email wasn't accessible? I have fished Nestor Falls/Kakagi and have had good luck and seasonal timing is definitely a factor.I was wondering if anyone had any thought(s) regarding the NW arm of Rainy(Labelles) or Shoal Lake? Personally I think places like St Clair, Erie, Sturgeon Bay etc have better overall quality but they cannot even remotely compare to a Canadian experience and that is what I want to share with my wife.Thanks again and I appreciate any suggestions you think may fit what we are looking for."
3202490,BuckeyeBill,2014-09-25 13:01:00,76,"My son and I fished for smallies on Big Vermilion Lake this past June. It sits in between Hudson and Sioux Lookout in Northwestern Ontario. We stayed at River Edge Outfitters which is a housekeeping camp. Very nice cabins, clean grounds and excellent docks. Very nice couple who run the camp. The smallmouth fishing was nothing short of outstanding. Averaged between 15 - 19"". Lots of them were caught on topwater - what a blast!! We also caught Lake trout, pike & muskies. We are taking our wives in 2015 and can't wait.www.riveredgeoutfitters.ca"
3202930,prov1800,2014-09-25 17:01:00,5010,"Very good lake, get to fish there a few times a year, mostly for muskies."
3211177,Guest,2014-09-30 06:40:00,0,"Try Gow-bush-Kon Lodge in Gowganda, great small mouth on the main lake. There are lots of other lakes near by just as good. One lake you can catch over 100 fish a day with some over 4-5lbs."
3211441,prov1800,2014-09-30 07:58:00,5010,"Haha.theres usually some red plastic taillight material laying there.launch is real bad right now.water is very low and there is also a rock in the water that the right trailer tire will hit due to havingvto back in farther.had a tough time on the weekend.there is barely a foot of water now for quite a ways out.if i go there next time i will launch at lost bay if there there or sharpes old camp.+2 this morning, gloomy and windy."
3219257,elkman99,2014-10-03 07:30:00,180,"Pipestone Lodge on Pipestone Lake. Unbelievable smallmouth fishing. Not to mention there are largemouth, great walleye, muskie, lakers, and pike."
3196898,Thompmd,2014-09-23 09:55:00,320,Looking at Resorts in Ontario(can be places other than Ontario) that has incredible smallmouth fishing. I would be bringing my wife along so it needs to be clean and a place you would take your spouse. We have our own boat and want a housekeeping plan. I would not rule out a fly-in but I think she would prefer not. We might do a day fly in/out for that experience.We can go anytime during the year. Thanks in advance.
3196962,jfaisten,2014-09-23 10:27:00,1060,Very interested in the replies you receive -- I'm looking for the same thing -- SE Ontario
3197418,Obabikon,2014-09-23 14:05:00,2370,Kishkutena Lake is probably the best smallmouth fishing in North West Ontario. It is truly amazing at times. It is a fly-in though. I would highly recommend going in June! The numbers you will catch (plus some accidental muskies) will blow your mind!
3197442,SinOrSwim,2014-09-23 14:20:00,1528,"Hawk Lake Lodge fits the Bass criteria but not the plan or boat. It's all American Plan and camp boats. But, really nice camp boats. The smallie fishing is amazing. So is the food."
3197842,trapper_john,2014-09-23 18:01:00,83,I would recommend Kingfisher on Wabaskang at Perrault Falls. Lots of nice Smallies and a great camp with great people. We've been going there for many years and have never been disappointed. Give it a shot. Great for the wives. Nice cabins.
3198186,Guest,2014-09-23 20:21:00,0,"Wabaskang is a okay Smallie lake that is getting better every year, but if you're going up in that direction I would suggest Cedar Lake...many excellent resorts right off the Red Lake Road. A much better Smallie lake currently along with Walleye's, Muskies and Crappies starting to flurish from reports on this site."
3198562,Hawker,2014-09-24 05:31:00,3967,"I would vote a hearty ""second"" and double thumbs up for Kishkutena Lake being a phenomenal Smallmouth fishery!!! I too would recommend June as a prime time to go. LOTW also isn't too shabby at the same time of year.I can and would highly recommend Young's Wilderness Camp as your destination. Their camp is clean, neat, well organized, great staff, even greater owners who truly care about their guest. They have several plans, including housekeeping with fully modern and comfy cabins. They also have a fly-in outpost cabin on Kishkutena Lake that will accommodate up to 8 people and have four well kept boats too. Young's does have a split trip plan, something like 3 days at the main camp and 3 days on Kish (flight included) that might work well for you.My wife and I have both made the trip to Young's for the past 23 years straight and spend a full week there each year and wouldn't dream of looking anywhere else for many reasons. Well worth checking into, trust me!!(http://youngswildernesscamp.com/)"
3198570,prov1800,2014-09-24 05:41:00,5010,I agree with the above post.i have been fishing cedar quit a bit lately and the bass fishing has been fantastic.spring smallies are everywhere and good mid summer action.right now the bass have moved up in thecwater column and are very active.by having your own boat you could easily trsiler it across hwy 105 to cliff lake for a day there also.five minute drive.cliff lake would be faster action with some hog bass.clarkes northern lights has great cabins and all the bait for free.
3199442,ftfarms,2014-09-24 11:02:00,444,"I would say the first week of june this was by far the best smallmouth fishing we've ever had and it was LOTWs We caught over 250 smallmouths over 16 1/2 inches with most being over 17"" and a lot over 18"""" it was stupid good because we didn't really fish for them. I really like the area we stayed in cause we fish miles by Obabikon bay and the rubber island area We stayed at grassy narrows in miles bay. Great place to stay. We caught over two hundred crappies standing on the dock. I would also say cedar lake for a smaller lake We stay at cedar point resort when we go to cedar. I like the area it's located at also. Love both lakes. hay Jarod how about those Cardinals."
3199546,vaquero01,2014-09-24 11:54:00,101,"Are there any public launches on Cedar and Cliff lakes. We stay at Onaway Lodge on Lac Suel, so these lakes are an easy drive. Next year we are going for the first 2 weeks in September, so we would have time for some bass fishing."
