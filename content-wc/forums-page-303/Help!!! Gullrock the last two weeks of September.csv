3177273,Strickers cut,2014-09-15 07:40:00,33,"Well, Gullrock did not dissapoint once again. I fished 9/6-9/13 staying at Wrights Wilderness Camp. I kept track of the fish count this year via a clicker and our boat caught 648 for the week. Most days we fished 8:30/9 till about 5 pm. Made the run clear to Pipestone bay on Red Lake, what a beautiful ride that is.Gullrock truely is a great fishery. I dont know how anyone couldnt hammer the fish there. We didnt have a consistent wind all week, it switched every day and was both calm and blowing at 20+, so not good conditions at all. We caught fish from 9 fow out to 30 fow."
3206826,tackleman,2014-09-27 21:26:00,444,"went out this afternoon for a couple hours . I went to fishermans point with 6 minnows in the bucket. left home at 2:15 and was home at 4:45 . brought back 4 for dinner, threw back a 27 inch northern and 6 walleye, the largest was 20 inches. not bad for a catch on 6 minnows. water temp was around 61 degrees but tomorrow the day time temp is dropping into the single digits on the Celsius scale, this could be a game changer....."
3209017,dynamite,2014-09-29 07:32:00,20,It is like we rented the whole lake for ourselves this week. Saw 2 boats on the lake all day and saturday and no other boats sunday. Fishing is great dozens over 18 and many eaters. This is the best time of the year for fishing here. You just have to be prepared for the weather. Saturday was high 70's and today low 40's. Still able to catch fish with wind from any direction.
3143249,J Arendt,2014-09-02 09:19:00,45,Hey guys looking for some help. Have an opportunity to fish Gullrock the last two weeks of September. What might be my best approach for walleyes that time of the year. Any comments would be helpful.
3144761,bobbylfishermon,2014-09-02 15:48:00,241,"Troll #5 or #7 shad raps or Berkley flicker shads in crawdad or perch colors in less then 10ft., and hold on!"
3150209,Strickers cut,2014-09-04 07:24:00,33,"I would guess the fish would be deeper then. I go 2nd week in September (Leaving tomorrow) and the fish are in 20+ fow.Jig and minnow would be your best bet, the larger the minnow the better"
3150393,boo-yah,2014-09-04 08:19:00,58,The boot and marker island were the best for us in second week of sept in the past. About five years ago we had a big weed bite by clay banks so we touch that every year. Pretty equal crawler harness to jig and minnow. Good luck
3152521,GWC,2014-09-04 16:51:00,1021,"Bandit 300's & Reef Runner 600 long lined behind the boat work this time of the year too.The walleye like them but so do the big pike.The rougher the water, the bigger pike seem to be more active. Caught a 44 & a 46 inch on the last September trip. The walleye were nice too. Fishermans Point can be good in mid to late September."
3153577,Habitual Eyer,2014-09-05 07:06:00,144,"Jig & minnow....no doubt. Keep graphing structure until you find one loaded up. Sit on top of them picking them off. Give a little time before you set the hook and Gullrock likes very low to almost no jig hop. Should be able to have 75 fish days with bigger fish being more active during the day that time of fall. Hot jig colors can sometimes not matter...but purple, chartreuse, orange, black, green, blue all work. If I can't fish it with 1/4 ounce, then I find a spot that I can. Magic depth that time of year (I am guessing) would be 15-22 feet. What a great lake !!!!"
3155281,tackleman,2014-09-05 16:30:00,444,"September is a hard month to fish gullrock, I find it very hard to find the fish and when I do they are generally pretty small. it just makes you wonder where the big ones go, but then again, I been wondering that all summer. I just think that i'll have to go out tomorrow morning and try to find them one more time, darn it all. looks like the weather guy is calling for colder temps next week , down to the single digits on our ceslius scale. so if you are coming up pack the long johns."
3156673,GWC,2014-09-06 09:37:00,1021,That's one of my favorite times to fish Gull Rock. Frost on the docks & chilly during the day. The fishing has always been good for us in late September. Fish getting ready for cold weather & feeding pretty hard. Just remember to go a little deeper & around structure.
3156898,tackleman,2014-09-06 12:15:00,444,"just spent some time out there today, tried around the clay banks but only got a couple little northerns, then I went to fishermans point, there was a half dozen boats there, ended up at the drop off heading toward 3 sisters. put on a bobber just for the heck of it set it at 18 feet and got fish after fish. it was kinda fun watching the bobber take off , pop up, then take off again. had to admit it was a fun way to fish for a change."
3156978,rockrunner,2014-09-06 13:30:00,205,"I have only fished Gullrock once and it was last year in September. This year on my lake in Northern Ontario the fishing has been tough. Several well known lakes in the area have also seen tough bites. Currently the fish have been on structure close to deep water. As of last weekend the fish have been consistently in the 18-22 foot range and a few beauty's around 25 feet. As mentioned, find the rock piles / structure that are holding fish with your electronics and try jigging with a decent size minnow. Last weekend I bounced a worm harness around my buddies boat and I clobbered nice size Wally's while he struggled to put a 15 incher in the boat jigging. The walleye seem a little scattered last weekend so covering water seem to work. I like to compare Grouse hunting to walleye fishing. That being said , when we hunt grouse in Northern Ontario we are on the move , hunting trails with Quads, mountain bikes , trucks etc... Always on the move searching and looking. Well walleye fishing is similar. Get on the water and get on the move searching and watching your electronics. I always tell my buddies, you wouldn't park a lawn chair on a trail in the woods and wait for a grouse to pass by. So why would you anchor in one spot and wait for a walleye to come by. Remember if your on a good size rock pile make sure you scan it good with your electronics or bouncer. Quite often they are in one corner of the rock piles, this is often referred to as the spot on the spot. Good luck."
