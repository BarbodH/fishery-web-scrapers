3183642,Algoma Guy,2014-09-17 10:40:00,48,Ok I guess I should clarify......it doesn't have to be a whole tree it can be a partial one. I think basically what you are seeing is a water logged log that still has some bouancy. Try to drag it if it doesn't move then yes it might be anchored somehow. I just don't know why anyone would want to do that and put a hazard in the middle of everything.
3186281,Pymbet,2014-09-18 10:58:00,42,"After thinking some more and googling around for ""dead head"", I lean toward the conclusion that these are neutrally bouyant logs, that are heavier on one end (like a normal tree, which is wider at the bottom). They seem to stay in the same or similar locations because the lake only has so many areas deep enough for them to be in their preferred vertical postion. We have seen these at Quantz over a period of five years and at least one seems to stay in or about the same location (we also use it as a guide for walleye fishing). Maybe that one is jammed into the bottom by the winter ice or is restricted to a small area where the bottom structure is like a hole.I don't think they are there by someone's intent. No camp owner would want them in their lake. One or two of these at Quantz might even be considered a plane hazard, let alone a boat hazard. I also think they started out as trees that fell in the lake and look like ""logs"" mainly after years of weathering."
3186561,MrSimon,2014-09-18 13:15:00,922,Is it out in front of the cabin? That particular one is the one I was able to shove underwater. Its not jammed into or touching the bottom in any way. It is definitely floating .... but it is also definitely held in place somehow. It's quite odd. I agree with you that these were not intentionally put there. But most likely an un-intentional result of logging or cabin building. I know for a fact that the cabin was built with logs taken from the large island SW of the cabin .... and the floating log is almost directly between those two places. Dozens of big logs must have been moved from that island to the point - it makes sense to me that a cable system was used. I wonder if the Hearst pilots know what it is.
3188041,Pymbet,2014-09-19 06:31:00,42,"The one I particularly remember from year to year is further south down the lake closer to the east side but still out in 15 to 20 feet of water. There was one closer to the cabin which is probably the one you checked out. On our in and out flights, there was a south wind and the plane landed northeast of the cabin. The pilot did not get near these logs on either leg."
3177265,MrSimon,2014-09-15 07:38:00,922,"We were on Quantz Lake a couple weeks ago and there were a handful of logs sticking up out of the water a little bit, maybe 4-12"" of wood showing. I thought they were just big snags, but they were in 20-30' of water. We drove up to one and I could shove it down under the water and it would pop back up. It was FLOATING. But, it didn't drift or move at all. It stayed in the exact same spot the entire week. So it was clearly a very large log (or piece of log) that was floating vertically, but somehow tethered to the bottom of the lake. What the heck was it and how did it get there? When they built the cabin, they cut trees from an island and moved them to the cabin location on a nearby point. Our best theory is that the floating log is somehow leftover from that operation. Maybe a log with a big cable hanging from it. Maybe intentionally left there as a permanent marker buoy? Any thoughts?"
3177297,Obabikon,2014-09-15 07:50:00,2370,"I don't know much about Quantz lake. However, many people sink trees to provide cover for fish. Especially when crappie are in the lake. My guess is they had a top and bottom anchor on the tree... one end came loose, and allowed half to float to the surface."
3177337,Bill Krejca,2014-09-15 08:06:00,6107,"Back when the logging industry used the lakes as a storage/transportation vehicle, logs were dumped into a huge boom of floating connected logs, i.e., a sort of interconnected log chain, if you will. Between each link, a very strong chain was attached to connect each log to the next, etc. This floating flotilla would then be pulled by a tug to a removal area. Occasionally a chain would become detached from the log chain, and the system would be free to let the logs inside free. While the chain was being reconnected, some of the logs would escape, sometimes with some of the chain logs. Due to rough water waves,etc, some of the logs were never retrieved. As the escaped chain logs became more water logged (wonder where this term came from?), the end of the log , being heaviest, sank to the bottom. eventually the chain might get stuck in boulders, etc. Probably the log in question is one described above. Log booms can still be seen today at some pulp processing plants. At one time, many of the northern lakes had occasional piles of logs along the shore line, remnants of the broken booms. The logs were a great source of firewood for the locals, logs were generally only taken from rock shores, as those on beaches had sand embedded in them, which ruined a saw rather quickly. Even today, old logs never recovered are still to be found around some beaches, examples of this logging history. Sorry for the wordy explanation. Bill"
3177369,Smitty123,2014-09-15 08:12:00,11,Sounds like part of an old timber crib - they use to make a large square 100ft by 100ft or larger gather up a bunch of logs from the river and tow them to the mill or where they are building the cabin - that would be my guess - very common on the Ottawa river back in the logging days.
3177913,Pymbet,2014-09-15 11:15:00,42,"Was at Quantz a week before you and saw the same logs sticking up. In fact, we have been there three other times in the last five years and we remember seeing several of those logs (or similar ones) then too. Logging is a thought on many lakes, but Quantz is well north of the logged area. They are mystery to me. Whenever I see something like that, I think there is probably an equal number that stick up about six inches below the water waiting to get you."
3180225,Bill Krejca,2014-09-16 08:16:00,6107,"Perhaps surprisingly, much of the entire north woods has been logged at least once. Once in the water, logs pretty much rot very slowly. As an example, I know of specific log clusters in LOW that were already old when I was a kid, back in the 1940's. Bill"
3180489,tv4fish,2014-09-16 09:28:00,2694,Along these lines - Anyone else fish a flooded open pit mine area? It really was/is neat to look down in the clear water of some of the mine pits around Crosby and see trees sticking up from the bottom.
3182498,Algoma Guy,2014-09-17 04:26:00,48,"They are called ""Dead Heads"". And no not the Greatful dead fans. When a tree erodes from the bank it's roots and every thing end up in the water what you are seeing is just the top of the tree with the rootball on the bottom. They are very common in the rivers around me. Can be very hazardous to boating ........especially at night!"
3182746,MrSimon,2014-09-17 06:35:00,922,"I do not think they are dead heads. When I push on the log, it goes under water and pops back up. It feels to be a log about 10"" in diameter and no more than 6 or 10 feet long. No way its an entire tree. Its also obviously not secured tightly to the bottom, but it must be anchored in some way because it does not drift at all. As others have said, it must be left over from a logging (or cabin building) event .... and some sort of cable or chain must be anchoring it. Either way, the one out in front of the cabin on Quantz marks a fantastic walleye spot!!"
3183410,Bill Krejca,2014-09-17 09:35:00,6107,"Just another thought - At one time,instead of the buoys seen today, some waterways were marked with ananchored wooden log. They could have had a type of colored stripe around the top. As they tended to sink deeper in the water, most eventually got replaced with more permanent floaters. Some of the log markers just disappeared during wind and water changes. One of these comes to mind - it ended up in a bay and was a great place to fish around. It seemed to sort of clear out weeds as it swung around in an otherwise very weedy area. On an aside, back in 1994 we spotted a gigantic deadhead floating (almost) end up. in LOW. It seemed to be captured by some circling current, an effect of strong wind. At the time, it was near Black Island. Bill"
