The camp is clean, I mean the cabins are immaculate. The camp is well maintained and run very well. The one down side is they do not rent motors. Through the years they have weeded out the roudy people who go to Canada to drink a lot and do a bit of fishing when sober. It is very family friendly and the host will treat you like family."

We found one spot where we pounded them for five straight hours. Our first journey ever into Butler, Olson and Larson was a blast. Amazing how much wild water is out there. Fell in love with Butler. Already dreaming of next year. Mitch and Sharon are the best."

They were allowed entry into Ontario on a work permit for the camp; however, they do not meet residency requirements defined by the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act.In 2006, conservation officers found Mitch Gusick with an Ontario resident hunting licence and warned him to correct it, as he was not an Ontario resident. In December 2007, Sharon Gusick was found to have upgraded her Outdoors fishing card to an Ontario resident hunting card. In November 2008, conservation officers again caught Mitch Gusick with an Ontario resident Outdoors Card.On November 10, 2008, the Gusicks were advised they did not meet the requirements of Ontario residency for hunting and fishing in Ontario. They were also advised that an investigation in Ontario was underway with the assistance of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources to determine their residency status. Less than three weeks later, both Gusicks renewed their Ontario Outdoors Cards online, claiming resident status.Justice of the Peace Edith Baas heard the case in the Ontario Court of Justice, Dryden, on April 20, 2010.For the purposes of obtaining an Ontario resident hunting and fishing licence, a resident is a person whose primary residence is Ontario, and who has resided in Ontario for a period of six consecutive months during the previous 12 months"
3201162,2746,2014-09-24 21:16:00,3206,"Ranger, your posting a 4 1/2 year old article dealing with a residency issue and insinuating that these folks are posting incognito. Sounds like you've got an ax to grind."
3201610,fishmanric,2014-09-25 07:17:00,219,"It would seem to me that someone is jealous of success. They could have beaten that false rap if they had pursued it. They are in camp nine months a year. Anyway, I had another wonderful stay there and am amazed at the constant upgrading of their camp. It was in very rough shape in the first years."
3201682,v-bay gord,2014-09-25 07:34:00,3168,"""a resident is a person whose primary residence is Ontario"" Never heard of Pound, Wisconsin as being part of Ontario. Running a camp for nine months does not make you a resident of Ontario. All you have to do is look at your drivers license to tell you where you live."
3202178,fishmanric,2014-09-25 10:21:00,219,"It's time to put this to bed and focus on the lodge. Nothing but wonderful times and experiences from two hard working wonderful people. Pine Sunset Lodge is good for Canada. Great rates, friendly service and big water are the perfect combination for a fun adventurous fishing vacation."
