Cloudy days being the exception, much of the spring walleye fishing is done dusk into dark. Shoreline trolling has been complicated by the explosion of Eurasian milfoil, which they are attempting to control with wievils In the spring the milfoil isn't as great a problem."
3218945,Shellback,2014-10-03 05:59:00,8083,I'll have to give Wolfe a try next year. Thanks for your post.
3212561,fishron,2014-09-30 14:49:00,317,"Seems things are a little slow on the board, so I thought I would mention a trip four of us just returned from. We were just an hour over the border at the thousand island bridge. The lake is gin clear and we hit a couple of bluebird days with no wind so we played golf. We don't get the great fishing further north but when the conditions are right its as good as it gets. We caught walleye to 24 in., several smallies over 4 lbs., some chunky largemouths, rock bass to 11 inches, perch over 12 and a few eater sized pike. The lake is dear to us and we will make this easy fall trip as long as we can as we have for almost thirty years. Almost all were caught on road runner jigs with worm. Good fall fishing to all, its almost time for stripers and blues off the Jersey coast."
3212721,JayM5209,2014-09-30 15:48:00,1050,"Thanks for the report. Love those Road Runner jigs! They're an under appreciated tool in the fisherman's arsenal. Glad you had a good trip.No strippers where I fish the surf, but I'm already day dreaming about the reds, specs, and pompano I hope to tangle with when spending February on Mustang Island, south Texas."
3214073,jcrushford,2014-10-01 09:24:00,32,We do a June trip every year to Bob's Lake. It's about 1 hour after you cross over the thousand island bridge. What lake did you guys fish?
3214089,fishron,2014-10-01 09:28:00,317,We have done Bob's lake in the past. It's a great bass lake. We fish Wolfe lake. I have a hard time getting my group to fish bass.
3214809,jcrushford,2014-10-01 12:08:00,32,"We have never fished Wolfe Lake, but seen it on the map. We put a fair amount of time fishing walleyes on Bobs, usually ending up with only 5 to 10 after 5 days of fishing. This past year crappie fishing was unbelievable. We were catching 12 to 14 inch all day long. Maybe next June we should plan on spending a couple of days on Wolfe. Do you have any spots that you would recommend? Thanks!"
3215073,fishron,2014-10-01 13:24:00,317,"I wouldn't recommend fishing wolfe in June unless it was after the bass opener. Smallmouth spawn almost the entire shoreline on wolfe in June and the local cabin owners are fiercely protective of them. Moreso than I have seen anywhere else. In May the walleye bite can be very good. If you are catching crappie's of that size from good water such as Bob's, I would be quite satisfied because they are on a par for eating with walleye in my opinion. Fall fishing for smallmouth around Wolfe's numerous shoals can be truly awesome. The potential for 6 lbs and over is there along with fifty fish days. Wolfe being gin clear is best fished with a constant wind of ten to 15mph. Give it a try, you can launch right alongside the golf course."
3215297,trapper_john,2014-10-01 14:37:00,83,I got turned on to road runners a couple of trips ago on Wabaskang. That's all I use now. All I've ever tried are the white ones. They are my go to's now.
3215785,Shellback,2014-10-01 17:43:00,8083,"Thanks for the nice report. Does Wolfe have any public launches? I spend about 4 weeks a year on the St Lawrence in the Gananoque area. Two in early June, and another 2 early Sept. Actually did 3 weeks this Sept. I've fished Charleston, Opinicon, Cranberry, Newboro, Buck and Bob's Lake. Never been on Wolfe. Next June I'm thinking of bringing my 1652 Mod V boat and puddle jump a lot of the inland lakes rather than fish the river."
3215921,fishron,2014-10-01 18:18:00,317,"Wolfe has three public launches that I know of. One is right next to the golf course. You can get maps of the lake through google. I'm familiar with some of your lakes and the St Lawrence. Wolf is unique. Always a clear lake at the top of the Rideau system and now gin clear due to zebra mussels. Her shoals are marked with buoys for the most part. Wolfe is not a stocked walleye lake. They reproduce freely. Ontario in the past used the lake to stock others in the area. Wolfe's walleye are shoal spawners. No major stream feeds the lake. It's spring fed and somewhat raised by a small wood dam at the outlet. Other than the dam, it's glacial. As I said, without a wind or early morning or evening, it can be a challenge. If you like to night fish it can be rewarding."
3216481,Shellback,2014-10-02 04:36:00,8083,"Thanks for that info. The St Lawrence has been tough for me lately, and my Canadian friends aren't doing much better. Next year I'm thinking of bringing my smaller boat and hitting the inland lakes. Looking at a chart, Wolfe has some 50 foot + water. Maybe the last 2 weeks of May would be better than the first 2 of June."
