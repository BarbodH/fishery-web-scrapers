There would be three of us, only my son would bear hunt, I would fish with my 11 yr old grandson. I would appreciate information on Murray lake and any other lodges within 10 hours drive of Toronto with decent fishing and good bear hunting. A question I have about Murray Lake is there any private cottages there and is Murray Lake lodge the only outfitter. I'm ready to send a deposit but would like more insight about Murray Lake.

Jeff & Tina are great hosts and will do whatever is necessary to make your trip enjoyable. The cabins are clean and well equipped. When we were there in the winter months, Jeff would guide us into remote lakes for some fantastic fishing."
