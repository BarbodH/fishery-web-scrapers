3086865,Fishdreaming,2014-08-13 16:22:00,1,"Kirk,It was a pleasure meeting you up at Witchbay this year. I still want to fish Lake Geneva when you get a chance. I have been bringing my two boys up to Witchbay Camp for 14 years and have made some great memories. I wouldnt trade a minute of our time up there for anything.The camp was excellent this year as always, apart from a financial side, I cannot see why anyone would want to fish anywhere else. We have never had a bad year fishing there. Some years are a little harder than others but hey, its fishing not catching.See you all soon!"
3208593,Gregking,2014-09-28 20:46:00,2658,"Just got home from one of the best walleye count we have ever had. I simply love this place. 27"" jigging minnows. My favorite style of fishing."
3217673,emma17,2014-10-02 14:05:00,436,"That's a fine looking fish Gregking. I meant to post a while back as I spent 3 great days at Witch Bay in mid August. My son and I were accompanied by my wife- her first trip to Canada. This was probably one of the best camps I could have taken her to for her first visit. The accommodations were fantastic, the service excellent, the weather great and the fishing was very active. We took full advantage of the fishing expertise offered, going out three times with guided help (no extra charge). Our only disappointment was a lack of size- our biggest was 22"". That won't keep us away though, we hope to make Witch Bay our annual fishing destination."

3068865,emma17,2014-08-07 14:55:00,436,Yeah there is that one too. The Bobby Brown referred to in the angry post is an actual song by Frank Zappa- I believe. It's a pretty crude song but really funny as long as the listener doesn't get all politically correct. As for Witch Bay- this place sounds great and I hope to visit it soon.
3068913,@Lunker,2014-08-07 15:18:00,835,"Now I'm putting it all together Greg. You and your family welcomed me to your table - lunch and dinner - a couple of times just as you arrived. Then I was assigned to another table. I was, and still am, amazed at your 4 generation /18 person group. Good for y'all for doing that while your dad is still with us. Pleasure to meet you. Wish I would have known...... David"
3069353,mrmusky14,2014-08-07 17:46:00,148,"Lunker I was there last week as well and did get to meet Greg and his family, loved meeting his dad, quite a man. Great stories."
3069945,KM1,2014-08-07 21:54:00,374,to see so many go to Witch Bay Camp....they deserve the business as their reputation earns said business. Hope to see you all there next summer. Will...hopefully....be there twice next summer if things work out as planned.
3070073,Gregking,2014-08-07 23:41:00,2658,Funny how we meet people. I wish I could have chatted with you more but some there at the table I had not seen since Christmas. Watching what dad ate and trying to remember what mom said he couldn't have was taking some of my attention also. How was your trip @lunker?
3070497,elkman99,2014-08-08 07:01:00,180,"you are on the wrong board. You should really spend your time on Muskies First, you'd fit right in. I bet you constantly walk around with a black eye and a fat lip???"
3073241,3 Z's,2014-08-09 07:05:00,133,"Amen to this. No place like it in my opinion. The sharing of information between camp staff, guides and other campers is what makes the experience for my family. If anyone is looking for a family Canadian fishing trip you can't go wrong at Witch Bay."
3073385,3 Z's,2014-08-09 07:51:00,133,Here is my daughter at Witch Bay in July
3073665,NP4ME,2014-08-09 09:07:00,378,"Hey elkman, You think zeebee is really sworral??? They definitely seem to have the same personality."
3064593,Guest,2014-08-06 08:34:00,0,Sounds like someone is a little jealous of a guy who works hard and spends his money in a way that he chooses. Congrats on a nice trip and great experience.
3065177,Larbo,2014-08-06 11:14:00,231,Nice story and better pick Gregking...
3065345,MrSimon,2014-08-06 12:33:00,922,Its awesome to see young kids having fun and catching fish .... especially huge walleye like that! Witch Bay seems like a really great place that offers a a lot of service to their guests.
3066073,camp chef,2014-08-06 16:42:00,915,Really???????
3066161,Richard B,2014-08-06 17:25:00,735,"Zeebee - Why would you type this? If my kids would have wanted to go fishing with me when they were 5 years old, to a lake I had never fished, or rarely fished, I would have gotten a guide for a day or 2. What parent would not want their kids have a great time catching fish? With a guide the dad had an opportunity to watch his children have fun, catch fish, not worry about positioning of the boat, baiting the hooks, etc., etc .. I applaud Gregking for taking his kids fishing. How many dads don't want to take small children fishing with them because they would get in the way, get tired, want to go in to soon, etc., etc.. My kids did not want to go when they were that young but when they got to 10 years old they both went and I had a blast taking them. One of my best memories is of my daughter walking up to the bow of the boat, taking a few casts, and then laying down and taking an hour nap. Did we have a guide? Nope but we were fishing a lake that I had fished every year for 10 years straight"
3066649,Da' Walleye Assassun,2014-08-06 21:10:00,358,Zero Balls is an internet coward that enjoys insulting people.
3066729,KM1,2014-08-06 22:30:00,374,"as well as many other lodges (in my 45 years of fishing). In my opinion....you cannot beat Witch Bay camp for food, service, fishing, etc. Yes you spend more money....but also.....you spend more time fishing and less time cooking and cleaning for sure as the higher expense includes food.....good food.....and plenty of it. And THAT is what I go to Canada to do....FISH!!!Add to that Gail and Steve (the owners) and how well they run this camp...well...it is a first class, premier, yet rustic, fishing camp/experience. Will go here over anywhere else (choose it over a fly in hands down)....and as I've said.....been to many (and not just on LOTW).There are several Pro Walleye anglers that like fishing out of this camp as well....just sayin......some very good fisherman fish out of this camp.Nice pic Gregking....your guide was Brad.....we met him for the first time this year....he is a great guy....as are all the guests and staff at WB.If you are a knowledgeable fisherman or a beginner....Witch Bay is a good fit for ALL. You do not have to use the guides if you don't want to....but they are there if someone wants them. And I believe........they come with the price of your stay.....they are INCLUDED....but only if YOU WANT TO USE THEM.From my perspective, even though we don't use the guide services, it is worth every penny you pay."
3067153,Gregking,2014-08-07 07:03:00,2658,"KM1 said it perfect. The staff and owners are hands down some of the very best. While my time there last week, in fisherman came in for a few days. Met some great people like Jim Edlund and Jim Perry. Like I said earlier I met mrmuskie14 and got to have some great conversations with him. We had a group of 18 and my boat, my brothers boat and a nephews boat. We were pretty full. My other nephew who was a first timer had Brad as a guide and took his two kids out (that's his daughter in the pic). I did however go out with Michael for muskies (I'm not a Muskie guy at all) and took my daughter and dad out with Russ fishing one morning. Russ and Dad are pretty good friends and I wanted to get some time with them two together one morning. Russ has forgot more about walleyes than I will ever know and I enjoy his company every time I am there."

3067721,Bill Krejca,2014-08-07 09:36:00,6107,"Nice fish, nice story, nice memories! Bill"
3062665,Gregking,2014-08-05 14:57:00,2658,"I have a great story to share. My nephew and his 5 yr old daughter was out last week (hired a guide since all our boats were full). She grew tired and set the pole down, my nephew noticed the tip take off when she sat the pole down. He grabbed it, set the hook and gave it back to her. She grew tired fighting it so he kept pressure on the line while she rested quickly then she took over and landed the fish. 29"". Pic is with her and the guide in his sweet kingfish boat Great time up there. Finally got to meet mrmusky, seems we have a lot in common."
3062729,Gregking,2014-08-05 15:08:00,2658,I myself had a blast. Finally got everyone in my boat talked into jigging which is my favorite. Now if I could get scheels to pay me for advertising. Lol
3062841,Ndstallmann,2014-08-05 15:34:00,549,Witch Bay camp my favorite place on earth.
3063017,fishin29,2014-08-05 16:46:00,37,beautiful fish
3063625,mrmusky14,2014-08-05 20:21:00,148,"Great job with the fish, that's a fish of a lifetime. I also like jigging the most as well. Fantastic picture of those two, over the top service and hospitality as usual for Witch Bay...Special mention to all the staff that make the camp operate from the cook(STU) to the deckhands(EMAN,MIKE,CORY) to the girls in the lodge(Laura,Carmen,Heather,Liz,Kaitlyn) to the fantastic guides(Russ,Brad,Bird,Mike) to the owners,Steve and Gayle,they all work to make your trip the trip of a lifetime.."
3063785,@Lunker,2014-08-05 21:00:00,835,Excellent story. I too am a fervent WB follower. But I'm curious......WB offers guide services free of charge. You had to hire Brad?
3064329,zeebee,2014-08-06 06:41:00,1144,"Guides, jigging and expensive lodges....sounds like a lot of fun. Right up there with watching a full season of Oprah back to back. W(h)itch bay do I go to if I dont know how to fish and toolazy to learn but believe $ makes up for it?God Oh God Im so fantastic.............. a week up north and Im still a fishin spastic. But Im a self strokin son of a *****.......give me a crank and maybe I'll switch.."
3064385,Gregking,2014-08-06 06:56:00,2658,"Sorry, reserve = hire in this situation"
3064417,Gregking,2014-08-06 07:04:00,2658,"I had a nice story to tell and this is the best you can come up with. I had reserves about posting the pic if some on here couldn't handle a 5 yr old catching a bigger fish than them, But it appears the burn you feel is yours to hold. Have a nice day"
