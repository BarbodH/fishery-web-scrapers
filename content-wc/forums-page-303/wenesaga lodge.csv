Had a great week multiple walleyeyes over 20 largest 27 3/4 nice northerns also. cabins are nice, wood heat, showers were a little small but everything was very clean. nice fish house and screen in porch was nice for sitting outside enjoying a adult beverage. we were able to catch the packer game at the lodge/game room. minnows are included and seemed to be the prefered bait. The only negatives were water depth it was a struggle to unload and reload boat. somebodys going to get wet if you dont have waiters. We didn't and did. Water was only a foot or two at the dock had to use trolling motor for the first hundred yards out from the dock after that not many places to worry about on the lake. its a small body of water and is influenced by direction of wind as to were you'll find fish. caught most fish in 14-15 ft. hardly any snaggs and a pull on the line with your hand pulled most of them loose. purple was a hot color with orange coming close second. Great drive to lake if your not taking your own boat. But in september water levels not great for bigger boats."
