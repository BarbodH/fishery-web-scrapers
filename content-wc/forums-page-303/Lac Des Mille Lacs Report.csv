3195554,Wenty,2014-09-22 15:20:00,15,"Six of us just returned from fishing LDML last Thursday through Saturday. Thursday was pleasant but on the tail end of a cold front. Did manage some nice walleyes off the west side of Burn Isle (off Broad Point) with a south wind and anywhere from 16-25' of water. Friday was a soaker. I'm guessing 2+"" of rain. Burn Isle and Ted's Island continued to produce in a SW wind. Saturday began rainy but got nice towards noon. Fished Boot Bay, more exploring than fishing but managed some nice walleyes in 19 - 25' of water. Decent NW wind blowing right down the gut along Broad Point and hit north face of Ted's Island early afternoon. Excellent action for more than two hours. Nothing big (biggest was 22"") but just a bunch of fish 16-19"". Most were returned to the water. Virtually all fish were caught with 1/8 jig and minnow. Bigger minnows produced best. Some luck as well with worm harness and crawler Last trip of the year. See you next May LDML"
