So, you won't see as many, but you're still getting hits. Walleye are in soft bottom areas... muddy/sandy bays in 15-20 feet of water. Crappies are just starting to bite up in the elbow! Have an amazing trip!"
3169057,castnblast,2014-09-11 11:46:00,111,"Ya, NWO is in the midst of a big cold front. Last few days have been brutal! Good luck on LOW"
3169201,thyme to fish,2014-09-11 12:23:00,307,"I was up there for 5 days.....aug 23-28....... I just fished for musky,,,,,,lots and lots of musky and the smallest pike I caught was 30""..... biggest musky to the boat was 46......biggest I lost before the boat.....omg I hooked into some complete monsters,,,,learned some good lessons I did spend some time in the ""stony-portage"" area......lots of fish"
3169489,Obabikon,2014-09-11 14:42:00,2370,Walleye have still been biting like crazy... even through the cold front.
3169793,jimirjr,2014-09-11 16:55:00,1149,Boy.... We are hoping They stay in a BITING Mood!!!
3172961,zeebee,2014-09-12 20:31:00,1144,Yup...cold weather fishing separates the true walleye fisherman from the smart ones.
3179905,1700SS,2014-09-16 05:53:00,104,"So far fishing has been great. We have been catching walleye up to 28"" on points and humps. 18-24' depth. a lot of them on the sharp break. All jigs and plastics. have not tried necked down areas yet. Crappie, cleaned 35 (my group is 4 guys) from Thompson creek area. All plastics as well. Water temp 59 around morson. 63 up at Thompson creek."
3185218,Bill Krejca,2014-09-17 21:29:00,6107,"Nice fish, looks like a good bite on the crappies. Wishin I was fishin. Bill"
3185282,muskyman73,2014-09-17 21:49:00,402,"this year was incredible for big crappie, we caught some toads that we could barely bounce in the boat ! lol"
3188257,Shorelunch,2014-09-19 07:58:00,554,"We're heading up for the weekend, fishing for walleyes - and also trying muskies for my 13 and 10 year old. Anyone fish for walleyes in the Sunset/Miles/Burrows areas lately, and if so, what types of depth/structures have you been finding them? I'd appreciate any info for muskies - we usually try a couple areas in Burrows, but haven't had any luck. May also try up in Obabikon, too for muskies. And maybe try Obabikon for crappies too. Any and all info appreciated!"
3188313,jimirjr,2014-09-19 08:37:00,1149,"My Group, also, will be near the Yellow Girl area on an HB beggining next Weds. Looks like the weather might be getting a bit better. Have the ""fall baitfish"" hatched already?"
3160137,1700SS,2014-09-08 08:27:00,104,Heading up 9/12 for a week. Anybody have any recent reports? Water temp? Crappies starting at the elbow? Thanks Brett
3160177,Obabikon,2014-09-08 08:37:00,2370,"Crappie are not in the Elbow yet... at least not in the way you mean. They have been around sunken trees for a month or so. However, that all should change after the cold hits us on Wednesday. Fishing in Miles has been awesome too. Walleye are biting like crazy."
3163809,1700SS,2014-09-09 13:09:00,104,"Looks like the cold front has already hit. What do you think, couple days of slower fishing?"
3165321,steve.a,2014-09-10 06:24:00,274,I will be up there on Sept. 19th. Staying at Nestor Falls and was wondering when the crappies might show up there on the fall pattern? Miles is a pretty good trip from there but if the fishing is that much better it would be worth it. Crappie used to show up at the bottom of Hay island but the last few years I did not find them there.
3166497,Obabikon,2014-09-10 13:45:00,2370,Walleye fishing has been awesome still. Crappie are hit and miss...
3166953,1700SS,2014-09-10 17:17:00,104,"Thanks Jared. Steve, I will try and give a couple reports as next week goes on. I have a feeling that Bill Krejca will also be up there the week you are.Brett"
3167265,Bill Krejca,2014-09-10 19:36:00,6107,"Brett, Nope, not heading up this fall. Be the first fall I've missed to LOW since 1963. Great catches to everyone! And give us a report. Bill"
3168257,jimirjr,2014-09-11 07:51:00,1149,We will be Up Weds. 24th for 10 days out of Sioux narrows on a HB... We just hope it doesn't SNOW... Never had success targeting CRAPPIE.... I think We will give it another shot this year...
3168329,Pikeslayer8,2014-09-11 08:08:00,1460,Sounds to me a perfect setting to conduct your ALS Ice Bucket Challenge thrown down by the Pikeslayer. Lol Just make sure you got some chowder on the stove to warm you up!
3168769,jimirjr,2014-09-11 10:02:00,1149,"It's on MY BUCKET LIST, Bill !! Along with Your CHOWDER !!!"
