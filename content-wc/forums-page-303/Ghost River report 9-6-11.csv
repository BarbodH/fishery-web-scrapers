The weather was spotty the first few days good then a cold front hit and slowed the fishing some. There were 4 in our group and the fishing was by far the best we have ever had at Ghost River. Numbers were not terrific but the size of fish we caught was phenomenal. We caught 28 walleyes that were 26-28 inches and caught at least twice that number from 21-25 1/2 inches in length. Eaters were always present. As usual the service was excellent with any reasonable request handled by Darrell, Tena, Donnie and staff. I believe fall is the best time to fish in Canada for several reasons. No bugs, larger fish but not always the numbers vs spring, generally more stable weather, and usually fewer people than spring or summer. This year however there were more people in camp than I have seen before in the fall. wmd"

We fish Lac Seul and we see boats in the fall but we saw A LOT of boats this year. Multiple times if we were fishing I could look around and see 3, 4, 5 or more boats within sight. Then, driving back and forth to camp you really could tell."
3175505,lassh,2014-09-14 08:52:00,553,"I do like fall fishing. You typically catch fewer fish, but usually get some bigger ones. I disagree about the weather though. The weather can be very bad in the fall with sustained high winds, multiple storms and cold temps. You do get some storms in spring but the sustained high winds seem worse in fall. Fall is not a time for fair weather fishermen. You can have good luck and great weather in fall, but I wouldn't expect it."

3195514,Skyraptor,2014-09-22 15:09:00,291,"Hey Larry, Enjoyed your post and photos from GRL. What were you catching the walleyes on? Besides minnows what baits do you recommend? I see you got some smallies as well. Where did you get those nice ones? 17 days to go!"
