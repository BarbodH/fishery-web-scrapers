He's got a break from school coming up in mid October so I'm trying to think of a good place to go for a three-day weekend. I'm in Cedar Rapids, IA and would like to keep the drive at 5 hours or less. My first thoughts were Winnebago in WI or maybe Mark Twain in MO, but I'm open to any and all suggestions. I've never been on either of those two. Any thoughts on a quick and easy trip in Southern MN or WI, or Northern MO? I really don't care if it's walleye, crappie, carp or whatever, as long as there's action."

Or head a little further downstream and fish musky. But that is gonna be a little beyond your 5 hour limit, and will be difficult to get a room if the Packers are in town. Winnebago can be tough if you've never fished it. Pepin, as suggested above, might be your best bet."

Minnesota stocks the crap out of this lake, but half the lake (southern half) is closed for goose hunting, but the northern half remains open for fishing, and is the best anyway. Accomadations, bait, and cleaning station right in Appleton. Jig, troll cranks, or rigs, lots of fish and no pressure."
3213993,camp chef,2014-10-01 08:43:00,915,"Winnebago is a good choice, It has been hot all summer.I am going tomorrow to a place on the Wolf river north of Winnebago. It is all part of the Winnebago system. I will let you know how it goes. Water is high and that usually signals great river fishing this time of year."
3216265,unclejoe,2014-10-01 20:31:00,22,Mark Twain is a corp lake and a good bet for crappie. the average length now is a good eater size 8-9 inch occasional bigger fish. Walleye are not targeted on the lake except a few folks who have them dialed in at certain times of year. Bass fishing is average to good.
