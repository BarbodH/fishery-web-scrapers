I know what mine was from Ohio to Northwestern Ontario. 6 cylinder Nissan 4WD truck towing 18 ft Lund Rebel - ouch!! But we are already booked for next year - can't wait!! Please post after your trip and let us know how you did."

Seen too many bears, but no real close encounters. I attached a picture of our camp and my 29"" Walleye. As you can see, my wife is not great at taking pictures. Good thing she make up for it in other area's, like letting me go fishing."

3181865,roscoe33,2014-09-16 19:06:00,653,"See if you can keep the boat on the trailer, and still load it up onto the truck. Will save the disassembly/reassembly, and save room in the truck bed for a lawnmower and whirlpool. Seriously, my uncle loaded his boat and trailer upside-down , as a unit. Glad you had a good trip."
3188481,Fishoil,2014-09-19 09:50:00,1277,That fish picture is awesome!! My wife and yours must have attended the same photography class.
2994978,GeoFish,2014-07-14 15:10:00,70,"Heading north Thursday, 1800 miles one way, on our yearly fishing trip.My wife insists on taking our two dogs and I agree.Since lodges don't allow pets, and a lot of campgrounds don't, we will wilderness camp somewhere north of Fort Francis.This may be the record for taking too much stuff.Ram 3500 Cummins.In the truck.Four Boys boat loader.Lund SSV 14.Custom 16 foot boat trailer.10 Gal of diesel.Aluminum loading ramps.Deep cycle battery.Yamaha 9.9 & gas can.Work & Play 275 toy hauler.In the toy hauler.Built in generator.30 Gal. of gas in the built in tank.Yamaha Grizzly 700 EPS.Too much gear."
2995122,skindzier,2014-07-14 15:44:00,137,"Actually there are quite a few lodges that take dogs. We take ours every year. My wife wouldn't do the tent/trailer thing. That said, based on the pix, I think you have enough stuff to live in more luxury then we do."
2995226,Golden Eagle,2014-07-14 16:04:00,2642,Good way to prevent being robbed at home while you're on the road. Take everything with you.
2995570,Skywagon,2014-07-14 17:40:00,1106,Do you have a camping permit? Might want to check with the MNR ahead of time to see what is necessary.

2996474,zeebee,2014-07-14 21:01:00,1144,"If you search hard enough you will find lodges that allow dogs....heck, Ive even heard rumor of some that allow wives.And, they wonder why Im single."
2996546,castnblast,2014-07-14 21:28:00,111,nice rig! have a great trip.
2996882,Guest,2014-07-15 05:02:00,0,"I would head north to the campground at Goldpines. You still have the opportunity to ""rough it"", but you're not that remote from civilization. They also accept dogs, so that is not a problem. Good fishing is close by."
2997058,bigcreekdad,2014-07-15 06:08:00,74,"Consider Crane's Lochaven Lodge on the French River. Dogs are very much welcome. Crane's has 3 labs of their own. I was up there two weeks ago and there were 5 labs, and 3 other breeds. Arf!!"
