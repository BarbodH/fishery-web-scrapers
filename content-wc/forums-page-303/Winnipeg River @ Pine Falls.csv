3186689,luv2huntnfish,2014-09-18 14:24:00,73,Thanks for the two replies. I can wait for the response from the party heading up on the 19th who was planning to stay a week but was curious to hear from some fishing the system currently. What does it's happening mean to you? Looking to hear about the numbers of fish per day and sizes of fish. Thanks in advance for providing additional details.
