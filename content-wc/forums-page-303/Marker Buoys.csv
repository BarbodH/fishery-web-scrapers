3189873,adempsey,2014-09-19 22:56:00,963,"Lol. Too funny.To the OP, can't help, my buoy's are still going strong. I'd probably just buy new ones if I lost the weight. Maybe I'd find a rock, since they are free."
3190297,Pooch,2014-09-20 07:52:00,4619,"Braided cord about the same size as came on the marker when new. Braided poly or nylon last the longest. I use a bright color so you can see the cord underwater when you go to pick up the marker if (when) the wind unwinds the marker. The chain links are cheap and work well.Taking anything that doesn't belong to you is wrong. No arguing that point. Especially in the woods or up north. People depend on items left in a particular spot to be there when they come back. If a marker isn't yours, leave it alone. It's none of your concern why it's there. No one around? Fish it and see what's there, but don't ever take it.One camp we fish throws a marker on a lake trout hump each summer so guests can locate it on the large open water. There is probably a reason a marker is left or colored tape tied to a shoreline branch. Maybe someone lost a rod there and keeps coming back trying to snag it. Rant over....Has anyone ever noticed that after throwing a marker that it seems to attract fish? Just an observation I've made a lot the past few years. ""Structure"" and fish are just attracted to it?Pooch"
3190489,JayM5209,2014-09-20 09:32:00,1050,"I would never remove a marker of any kind. It's based on a personal experience. So as to not hi-jack this thread, I'll just give the short version of a very long story.Some 25 years ago six of us, in three 14' camp boats, were fishing a lake that was the 3rd lake from camp, each lake connected by a 35-45 minute creek ride. Just at dusk two of the guys capsized their boat. Fortunately, we were done fishing for the day and had meet in a bay sitting in the boats drifting 30' or 40' apart and just shooting the breeze before starting the trip back to camp. After pulling 2 guys out of the water, getting them in any dry clothes we had in other two boats, and getting their boat righted, we spent a half hour trying to snag any gear that was at the bottom of 12' of water - got none. It was now totally dark. Before heading for camp, we tied a floating minnow bucket to an anchor to mark the spot so we could return in daylight to try to retrieve gear.The second camp 6 hp Johnson would not start, for unknown reasons. The only running outboard was my old 15 hp Mariner, so I towed the other two boats through the creeks, across the lakes and back to camp. The next day - after borrowing a rake from camp and lashing an 8' beaver pole to the handle - we went back to look for rods, tackle boxes, etc. When we got into disaster bay, the minnow bucket marker was gone! One rod floating by the shore was the only thing recovered.Upon returning to camp the owner asked if we found anything. When we said our marker was gone, he replied that another party in camp had brought it back. Their story was that ""Someone marked their fishing spot with a minnow bucket. Since that's illegal, we cut the line and brought the bucket back for you."" His reply to them was, ""If you guys want to live, you better get the **** out of camp for the rest of the day. 'Cause a group of really p---ed off guys is going be back here soon and they'll be looking for blood.""So . . . . . . . . I'll never remove anyone else's marker. We still fish that lake, and always pause for a minute when we enter what is now referred to as Tippy Boat Bay."
3190697,Pikeslayer8,2014-09-20 11:02:00,1460,"Well, pretty much sums up the issue to remove a marker or not! Magnificent story Jay!"
3195074,bcmss396,2014-09-22 11:25:00,296,"Where we fish you generally don't want to be anywhere near any type of marker. Sometimes they're bleach bottles, sometimes water bottles, sometimes old fish markers, etc... These are almost always on rocks that you can hit!!!We always leave markers out and often won't even go near one we see to investigate. Not worth the risk.Blair"
3196098,2746,2014-09-22 19:30:00,3206,"I use a buoy to assist me while fishing a spot but would not intentionally leave it thinking I planned to come back later in the day or tomorrow. That somehow feels messy to me.....leaving stuff floating in the lake. Btw, how the heck would anyone know or even guess that a floating minnow bucket was marking lost equipment? That's a significant story but to get hot over someone picking up a floating minnow bucket is a bit of a reach.....at least in my opinion. (I've gotten my prop wrapped up in the line of left and moving buoys a couple times....that may affect my feelings on the matter. )"
3203210,Hewhocookstomuch,2014-09-25 19:03:00,66,"We fish Lake Saint Joseph every year and have a favorite area we call the Grassy Knoll. Without GPS it is hard to fine. It is an area 100+ yards by 200 yards, with a 25 foot drop off on the edge, which most of the time is holding a great number of walleyes. The knoll is a small rock pile with dozen blades of grass , hence it name. The Knoll is on one corner of the rock pile set back 25 yards. This year I made a buoy out of a soap bottle, pvc, swimming noodle,coat hanger wire, duck tape, spray foam and rocks for balance and anchor. We were able to see the a half mile away. Saved time looking, and we got right on the fish. At the end of the week we retrieved the buoy to save for next year. If anyone would have tried to removed that marker the might have ripped out the bottom of their boat. Anyone is welcome to fish off the Knoll, except if I am there first. Kidding a very large area."
3204114,Coyoteman,2014-09-26 09:23:00,209,"These marker buoy stories remind me of my last trip to Canada. I would never mess with one until this happened. We had been fishing a break line that stretched over a half mile for a couple of hours one day. I had a line marked with my I-pilot and we were catching lots of fish each pass. There was a boat a ways away from us that I assume was not doing very well, I saw them watching us net fish with a pair of binoculars. It wasn't long the older couple worked their way very close to us. We netted a nice eye and they threw a buoy out right on top of our lines. Of course I was a bit po'd but kept my cool. We continued our passes, every time we had to get off our line to maneuver around them as they started jigging that spot, what ever, its not a private spot. They caught a couple and kept watching us net fish along the break. The old guy moved his buoy at least 3 times along our line the same way as he did the first. Now I'm really pissed and the old guy tried to have a conversation with us, didn't take long for him to figure it out. He then tells us on a pass that they were going in for lunch and were leaving the buoy out so they could find their spot when they came back out. Needless to say that buoy was not where he left it when he came back."
3204146,JAY221,2014-09-26 09:34:00,877,"My son-in-law had an anchor stuck out on Wabaskang this year. We tried everything short of going in after it which is what the daughter wanted to do. I told him to mark it with a marker and we would see if the camp owner had anything to maybe get it loose. It was there a couple of days while we tried different times to get it loose. Eventually we cut the rope as far down as we could. I have it marked on my gps and will take a ""tool"" with me next year to try to get it. Later, Jay"
3188761,BornToFish,2014-09-19 11:48:00,1224,"I have been using Lindy Little Joe marker buoys for many years and have been quite satisfied with them. I like the way they ride high on the water's surface and are easy to store. Over the course of many years, I've replaced some of the weights with duck decoy weights when the original weights were lost to rocks. I've also replaced the line on some of the buoys due to breakoffs and fraying. Some of my buoys have been troublesome in that they drag the weight along the bottom, the weight hangs up part way to the bottom and the buoy drifts away, or the marker buoy is completely spooled in rough water. I just realized that my ""problem"" buoys have the replacement weights or line. What are you folks using as replacement weights and line? Many kind thanks."
3188993,kzoofisher,2014-09-19 13:58:00,5144,"Decoy line and what ever the weight is, it has to have enough surface area that it doesn't hang up easily. A couple of strap style decoy weights can be bonded together nicely. Your question brought to mind something that happened on my last trip to Ontario. Somebody left a buoy on a hump, very far from the lodge and about three miles from the nearest occupied cabin we knew of. We kept an eye on it for three days and then wondered if we should pick it up the night before check out. We didn't want to leave garbage in the lake but we didn't want to steal somebodies buoy either. We only passed the spot occasionally and the owners may have still been fishing that spot and not had a GPS. What would you have done?"
3189177,forgop,2014-09-19 15:48:00,880,I would leave the buoy but dropped a line and jigged the heck out of it.

3189369,2746,2014-09-19 17:34:00,3206,I'd have picked it up.....buoys shouldn't be left in my opinion.
3189385,forgop,2014-09-19 17:36:00,880,"On a fly-in lake, I'd agree with you. It sounds like it was a lake with multiple cabins, so someone else could still be on the lake that left it there and may very well go back."
3189449,Aspencreek,2014-09-19 18:20:00,2911,"Or somebody forgot to pick it up, we've all done that a time or two. I have a special bouy, One that is intended to catch fisherman, you know the ones, I throw out my decoy bouy in the middle of nowhere, then go and fish my spot, hoping to catch an interloper or 2 that figure they can snake a spot somebody else found for them. Catch a couple every year, interestingly enough, they usually have their own boat with big time electronics."
3189521,Skywagon,2014-09-19 18:46:00,1106,"I use 6-3/8 chain links for weights after I break off the original. Unless it is a fly-in lake with no one else on it, I would consider it theft to remove a marker."
3189649,zeebee,2014-09-19 21:14:00,1144,"OK, I woulda prayed for God to give me the wisdom to do the right thing and to not take any action which might otherwise harm my fellow man.Its an unattended bouy....Christ........do whatever you want."
3189793,mrwalleye5,2014-09-19 21:58:00,1922,Funny you should mention this. Just came back from a fly in at a 5 star resort. I just about jumped out of the boat when the guide thru out a Shimano bait caster as a weight For his marker buoy. This was common practice as one guide told me that the deal they get from Shimano on reels it didn't make sense to get them fixed.
