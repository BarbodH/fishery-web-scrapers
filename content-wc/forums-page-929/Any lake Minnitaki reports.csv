That's near the edges of the reef where it drops off to much deeper water. I'd guess that the other mid-lake reefs were just as productive. Some days it was like a parking lot though - 15 boats by mid-morning.The usual spots from early July were non-productive. Redpine Bay and English River were empty. One or two boats long enough to realize the big fish were in the main lake in deeper water.Fishing was overall spotty. Good fishing for 30 minutes, then nothing. Move to another spot, same results. Fan-casting big five-of-diamond spoons worked for pike and really big walleye in Southwest Bay."
