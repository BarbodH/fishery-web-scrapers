523386,Guest,2002-08-10 19:38:00,0,"Just got back today. Great Wallie and Smallie action all week, at all locations. Had only one Muskie strike and some northern. Got a 36 incher on a suick. Wallies were 25-30ft. Buddy Cliff had a 34 inch wallie on the side of the boat. We caught him around Cliff ironicaly at a point at Cliff Island. Stayed at Totem resorts.Traveled 30 minutes north for the wallies and smallies. Have a great time. Try and get the 34incher in the boat. All wallies caught on leeches."

Maybe as far as Rope Island. We will be on a houseboat from Floating Lodges in Souix Narrows. Look for a tan Sylvan Backtroller, with WI stickers and say Hi. Good luck, Swede"
523389,Guest,2002-08-11 22:47:00,0,"Just got back myself from Sioux Narrows. As Blake said, the walleye fishing was great. Just wished I had a bit better luck on smallies like Blake did. For me, didn't bag any trophies, but loads of walleyes up to 22 inches. Can't tell you how many, because when it is that good, why bother counting. 1/4 oz jig and minnow was the winning combination in 18-35 feet of water. Fished mostly from Long Bay up into the Sunset Channel. When fishing an area, definitely look the area over with your graph and stay on top of the marks.A big unexpected bonus was the perch that were in with the walleyes.Nice sized jumbos and not wormy like alot of Canadian perch.I went out of Red Indian Lodge. For a family vacation, it is hard to beat. Lots of activities to keep kids busy. Since I brought my own boat, I arranged for an independent guide service. I went with D'Arcy Finlan for 2 days. D'Arcy posts up here during the off season.He is busier than a one legged man at an a$$ kickin contest right now.However, he is a young go-getter type of guide and works very hard to put you on fish. His rates are also quite reasonable. I would highly recommend his services if he has an opening. I found his web page on the Just Fish Ontario website. If you try to contact him, be patient as he many days, he is putting in 12-13 hour days on the water.This was my first time there and we really enjoyed it."

If you work the right depths, you can get great fish in Whitefish Bay.The water is clear so work a little deeper, about ten feet for walleyes deeper. 30' range give or take. Good luck."
