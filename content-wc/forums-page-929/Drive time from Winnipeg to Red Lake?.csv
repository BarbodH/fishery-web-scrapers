523480,WillieB,2002-08-13 06:14:00,292,"Flying into Winnipeg this Thurs. at 11:40 A.M. Figure by the time we get our baggage and the rental car we'll be leaving the airport at 12:30...what's a reasonable expectation for arrival in Red Lake?We're running a bit tight on time...hoping to make it to the floatplane base with enough time to fly in to the outpost lake that evening.Also, if I could ask my Canadian friends, which weather forecast is more accurate...www.weather.com or www.wunderground.com for that area? Radically different forecasts between them.Thanks in advance!"
523481,duffy,2002-08-13 07:23:00,49,I haven't driven it before however i fly out of red lake every year and the people i have spoken with every year say it takes about 5 and half hours. make sure you don't do it in the dark and watch out for the moose on 105. good luck. Where are you going?
523482,WillieB,2002-08-13 08:19:00,292,"Thanks! We'll be putting in 10 days on Kitty Hawk Lake, on the edge of the Woodland Caribou Provincial Park near the border of Manitoba and Ontario...northwest of Red Lake thru Jubilee Outposts. Flying in, of course, with the fine folks at Chimo."
523483,Guest,2002-08-13 09:33:00,0,Definitely a 5+ hour drive. Duffy's right - don't do it in the dark - moose are nasty to hit. Go with www.weather.com they're the Environment Canada people adn pretty accurate within 5 days.
523484,Guest,2002-08-13 10:58:00,0,I've made that same drive each of the last 5 years. We leave at 5:30 AM and arrive by 10:30ish in Red Lake with one quick stop.Figure the drive at 5 to 5:30 and you will be fine. I have never done the Red Lake Rd side in the dark and I don't think it would be a good idea. We are usually late getting back into Winnipeg but that is no big deal.BTW...Did you consider flying Bear Paw from Winnipeg to Red Lake. RT is usually only about 220 USD.Brett
523574,WillieB,2002-08-13 11:09:00,292,"Yes, we checked into Bearskin. The big reason we opted to drive the last leg is we hardly ever get to see that part of Ontario, and compared to our usual drives in the states it's beautiful! Also, Bearskins flight times had us sitting in Winnipeg for 4 hours. That part of the trip I don't mind...it'll give us a chance to leave part of the ""usual"" world slowly behind...far behind!!"

523575,Guest,2002-08-13 11:22:00,0,Enjoy the ride. The first two hours are about like driving across IA or SD. The last three hours are wonderful. I always wonder how the fine people of Ontario managed to draw the border almost right when the scenery changes;-) It could be the park that you enter when you leave MB too. For me the drive has lost some luster but it is nice to change gears. I just prefer to do it on the flight into the cabin.I only mentioned the airline because it does a good job and I like to support someone who makes it possible for me to leave my desert home and be fishing a remote Ontario lake in the same day.Enjoy!Bob
