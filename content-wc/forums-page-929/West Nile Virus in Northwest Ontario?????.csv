Especially due to the fact that they have there share of mosquitos. And what is the provincial government saying about it."
523299,Guest,2002-08-06 18:25:00,0,"I live in Sault Ste Marie, Ontario. We just had our first West Nile confirmation the other week. It was from a dead crow. I would guarntee north western Ontario has it as well."
523300,Guest,2002-08-06 18:59:00,0,"according to the usa cdc, it's in michigan, wisconsin and minnesota. cannot imagine that it has not made it to nw ontario. it is also all over africa, the middle east, europe etc. get used to it. it's everywhere."
523301,Guest,2002-08-06 19:02:00,0,"oops, also north dakota"
523302,Guest,2002-08-07 06:35:00,0,"Yup, its in NW Ontario, but who cares - the chances of getting seriously sick from the virus are about 1 in a million (that's not an exaggeration). You have a better chance of getting hurt driving up to NWO to fish."
523303,Guest,2002-08-07 11:28:00,0,That maybe true 1 in a million... but you dont know my luck!
523304,Guest,2002-08-07 13:30:00,0,Ha!! I hear ya!
523305,Guest,2002-08-07 15:46:00,0,"They must have a lot of people in Louisiana then cause they figure 300 people are going to die from it by fall. You can laugh about it if you want, but you shouldn't say that it's not serious when in fact it is very serious."
523306,Guest,2002-08-08 07:52:00,0,"The media is stating that there will be 300 deaths. Over the past 4 years there have been less than 10 deaths in New York State. New York State has what, 25+ million people. You do the math.This stuff sells papers. I suggest you check out the web site at the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta that they've set up for WNV.I repeat, you are much more likely to die in a car accident on your way to NWO than catching the disease."
523307,Guest,2002-08-09 09:24:00,0,It also typically hits people over 55. If you are healthy and take regular precautions like bug dope and stuff I would not worry about it in the least.
