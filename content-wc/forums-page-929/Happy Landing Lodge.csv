We caught alot of walleyes with the biggest being 29.5"", we caught two muskies 44"" and 51"", and lots of smallmouth. The cabins were very nice and we had very good food. I am planing a trip in late september. If anybody else is looking for a good trip I think they still have a some space for this late fall. check out their web site at www.happylandingfishing.comGood fishing"
