I have always done fly-ins to outposts and I have had spectacular fishing. I am thinking about driving in to Lac seul next year and I'm wondering about the Mosquitos and black flies. I can put up with them, but they ruined a couple of trips for my wife (maybe thats good since she lets me go with the guys any time now)anyhow I would like to take her again and I am wondering if there is a best time for good fishing and the least bugs there of if there is a bug problem at all. If it weren't for them I would spend my entire summer in Canada (retired @ 50 got lucky). The canadian hospitality is second to none."

523378,Guest,2002-08-10 05:01:00,0,Go up in August very little mosquitos and blackflies are around and the fishing will be good too. I have been up 3 or 4 times then and was plesently surpised to find no bugs bothered us.
523379,Steve,2002-08-10 19:33:00,259,Just back today from our trip. The bugs were not too bad this year flies did bother us one day out on the water with wind blowing. But they came in the cabin some place at night. We never found the spot that they came through. GREAT weather! and the Lake Trout started to bite.

523381,Guest,2002-08-11 17:09:00,0,"I like the first of September, very few bugs, the fishing is good, although the walleyes may not be in the same locations as they are in August, and the weather changes quicker, maybe even have to fire up the wood stove at night. Oh man, fresh walleyes in the skillet, the smell of wood smoke, the loons calling across the lake, I can't wait!"
