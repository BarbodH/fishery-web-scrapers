523202,Guest,2002-08-13 14:25:00,0,I share your feelings as well but for the sake of my own safety I would report the net to the OMNR and let them do what they do in those cases.
523191,Guest,2002-08-01 07:55:00,0,I was fishing on a remote canada lake trolling cranks when my buddy and i got snagged. We both thought it was some think weeds well we were wrong. Yup you guessed it an old gill net with some old rotted fish and even some more recent fish. I was spitting venom at this time. For those of you that have the right to net fish at least finish what you started and clean up your nets. Unbeleivable thats all i can say right now!!!!!!!
523192,Guest,2002-08-01 08:11:00,0,"I have been around the natives. I lived on an island on the Woods some years ago, I had an ice road, and sure enough the natives came out on my road and netted under the ice which is not as difficult as one would imagine. Anyway, they showed up about every three days or so to take their pickings. They also left their garbage all over the ice. So the fish are usually in the nets for a couple of days before they get processed, add a week to market and that's the crap you eat if you buy walleye at the market. Not me, buddy."

523194,Guest,2002-08-01 16:55:00,0,"I do not have a problem with an aborigional family netting for their own familys consumption, I do have a problem with fish being wasted, and sold. I think the M.N.R. should make sure that their nets are properly identified , and that their harvest is within reason. If not then those individuals should be fined, and possibly lose their rights to fish."
523195,Guest,2002-08-01 18:35:00,0,"I agree, however the MNR does not have the ***** to take on any native issue. They do as they please. Marking nets is a safety issue and I see nothing wrong with having to put your name and status card number on your nets or traps."
523196,Guest,2002-08-03 08:48:00,0,"A few years ago while trolling I snagged a gill net on the Winnipeg River. It was unmarked, kind of frustrating. Cut my crankbait loose and proceeded on!"
523197,Guest,2002-08-05 13:55:00,0,YES PLEASE MARK YOUR GILL NETS!! I HOPE THAT IS NOT TO MUCH TO ASK!!!
523198,Guest,2002-08-10 16:49:00,0,"The natives have the right to net, but it is my firm opinion that it should be for their family's consumption and not for sale to commercial markets. This practice rapes the population of walleye in any lake. The most recent issue of In-fisherman magazine states that the average density of walleye in natural lakes is 4-9 walleye per acre. The nets nowadays have no restrictions on mesh size and I believe the M.N.R. should address this problem."
523199,Dave,2002-08-10 22:34:00,258,"Well gentlemen there is another way of looking at things also. Some folks posted above that: The native people should only be allowed to net for the families consumption.What about the fellow that never goes fishing? Will his family never eat walleye unless they know a fisherman willing to share his catch?I agree that any mess should be cleaned up, but, I have snagged and seen worse crap in my time around launch sites, and on the water, but never a gill net. Dave"
523200,Guest,2002-08-13 09:18:00,0,Whatever you do don't fool with their nets. There have been armed confrontations between people fooling with nets and natives here in NW Ontario.
