523320,Jigger1,2002-08-07 14:35:00,234,"Hey Folks, I'm looking to make an investment into a quality baitcasting combo and need some specific help on narrowing down my search for a reel. I've always been a spinning reel fan, but saw first hand this year how much more effective it is to use a baitcasting rig while bottom bouncing. Any help would be appreciated. Regarding rods, I'm leaning towards the G-Loomis Walleye series rod - WBBR813C, it's a 6'9"" fast action/medium heavy rod.Thanks Â– Jigger1"

They have a ""factory Outlet"" site where they sell overstock and discontinued products and have the Tournament Pro reel (TP5600) for $86. It is a nice unit, smooth as silk and solid.http://www.ffo-tackle.com/detail.cfm?PassProdId=720Paul"

523323,manitobawalleye,2002-08-10 07:39:00,885,i believe the badger is suggesting a flipping switch....
523324,Kelly,2002-08-10 14:20:00,108,"I would STRONGLY recommend a Shimano Castaic reel for bottom bouncing. It has the instagage feature which allows you to engage or disengage the spool without using your free hand on the reel crank. This means you can let out little bits of line to try to remain on or near the bottom due to varying depths. This feature I've found to VERY useful especially for those of us who always have to run the boat, bait hooks, take off the wife and kids fish, etc. Do look into it as I've seen alot of reels for bottom bouncing but this one is by far the most practical and after all it is a Shimano. As for a rod you're definitely on the right track with a GLoomis as well. They are pricey but you get what you pay for and that definitely holds true with rods and reels. Good Luck!"
523325,Jigger1,2002-08-11 09:26:00,234,"Paul & Kelly,Thanks for the info. I'm leaning towards the Shimano Castaic with its low profile and the instagage feature. (that's really what I was looking for) I'm a Shimano fan and have been very impressed with my Stradic spinning reel.Thanks again - Jigger1"
523326,the badger,2002-08-11 09:58:00,0,"NO,I DO NOT MEAN A FLIPPING SWITCH. A THUMBBAR REPLACES THE TRADITIONAL BUTTON FOR RELEASEING THE LINE SPOOL.IT'S MUCH MORE CONVENIENT THAN THE OLD FASHIONED BUTTON RELEASE."
523327,Bryan,2002-08-12 18:03:00,244,Jigger1:I use the Loomis WBR813C with the Shimano Castaic and I think it is an excellent choice. It's a great combo for bottom bouncing. Maybe Kelly can sell you one cheap cause with the baby coming his fishin days are over. LOL!!!
523328,Jigger1,2002-08-13 18:58:00,234,"Bryan,Thanks for the confirmation! I'm pretty sure I'm going to go in that direction. Now that the kids are older I can finally start to invest into more fishing equipment!Jigger1"
523329,Kelly,2002-08-14 06:45:00,108,"Bryan, you've got it all wrong see. Now I need twice as much gear(God, that's a scary thought-but a good thought). I guess I'll never be stuck for a partner though, all's I'm going to need is a seat to strap the kid into the boat. Or I could use one of the storage compartments, heck maybe the kid can drive, it can't be no worse than me and some others on the tourney trail."
