522493,DarrenB,2002-08-13 09:03:00,28,"Good guess but I don't buy that argument. Puerto Rico, the Dominican, Yucatan Mexico, Bahamas etc.. are all off the coast of Florida and Americans flock to those destinations like ants at a picnic. Yet, Florida's tourism is still relatively strong. I doubt one more island as a vacation destination would put that much of dent in the Florida tourism. Plenty of people from around the world are going to still visit Disneyland, Universal, Tampa Gardens, Cape Canaveral, etc... You won't find any of those attractions in the islands."
522494,Guest,2002-08-13 09:11:00,0,"I think the Cuba US thing is personell ......the only people suffering are the poor people that live there in third world conditions. Lack of medical supplies and food are widespread. Quote by Castro....""We have some of the best educated prostitutes in the world""...Sad but true that these people are forced to do this to make ends meet."
522495,Guest,2002-08-13 16:41:00,0,"if these people had one collective gonad among them, they would rise up and overthrow their leaders. i don't feel a bit sorry for them. i can remember vividly when castro was importing nuclear weapons as a part of the soviet empire. what do you suppose he was gonna do with them? he also exported soldiers to foment communist dictatorships all over the world. what are you people thinking about? tourism? nonsense. i wouldn't go there if all of the trip were free."
522483,Guest,2002-07-28 05:57:00,0,"There are lots of good cigars, some cubans are inferior to a good South American cigar. Beware of imitations. I like cubans when I can get them for a good price. I but them off of Canadians who holiday there and bring them back. $5 to $6US for a good Cuban."
522484,Dave,2002-08-08 21:16:00,258,"How utter ironic!Canadians who vacation in Cuba pick up a box of Monticristo # 5 for $55.00 USA bucks. And only USA bucks. As a point of interest, the only difference between a #1 and a #5 is the lenght of the cigar. It may also surprise you how many American pose as Canadians and vacation in Cuba. Dave"
522485,Guest,2002-08-09 04:20:00,0,Don't get caught.....The fines have been up to $5000US sometimes even years after US people get back from holidays. Don't understand why there are travel restrictions placed on you folks. It should be none of the governments business where and what you do with your time.
522486,Dave,2002-08-09 20:06:00,258,"Canadian Guy, do you mind if I ask how old you are? I am certin that it is alot less than 40. The missile crisis of 63 is the reason that Americans are not allowed to visit or trade with Cuba. It is the same reason that they use today 39 years later. The real reason is that it would devastate Florida's tourist industry.Dave"
522487,Rick,2002-08-12 16:27:00,226,"From someone who is old enough to remember the Cuban Missle Crisis I find it ironic that we can nuke Japan but visiting there is no problem. I believe we can visit Viet Nam now but we still can't take a trip to an island 90 miles off our own shores because the USSR temporarily put a few nukes there. I'd bet that there is a US sub closer than 90 miles to Russia right now with 24 multi-warhead missles aimed at them.I know, its all political, Castro and all. But lets face it, this embargo hasn't worked. Castro has outlasted 8 US presidents and like the EverReady Bunny, he's still going... Come on now, all we want is a few good cigars!"
522488,Guest,2002-08-12 16:46:00,0,better not count on any embargo being lifted during the gwb administration which should last about another 6 years. that country is a total basket case. the embargo hasn't worked? the only reason that some countries trade with them is that they are willing to deal with the devil. free trade (nafta) ruined the canadian economy. the socialist european economies will trade with anyone. i can live without cuban cigars. the free countries of the world should do so also.
522491,Guest,2002-08-12 19:21:00,0,I never did understand American Foreign Policy........
522490,Guest,2002-08-12 19:24:00,0,You guys could overrun Cuba anytime....all you have to do is lift the embargo. Half of Cuba would leave to go to the other half in Miami. The rest would be too old to do anything.
522492,Dave,2002-08-12 22:28:00,258,"Like I said the real reason Americans cannot visit Cuba is because it would be the end of Florida's tourist industry. GWB knows it and his brother does also. It seems interesting that you are allowed to visit any other country that you had a war with, except Cuba. Was that 55,000 killed in Nam. But you can go there. I read where GWB is talking with Russia about buying oil from them so you do not have to depend on OPEC. But you still can't visit Cuba.Dave"
522489,Rick,2002-08-13 06:31:00,226,"I think the goal of the embargo is (was) to oust Castro. After over 40 unsuccessful years, maybe someone should re-think this plan. Free trade would remove Castro faster than an embargo.US policy deals with dictators and others more oppressive than Castro every day. Look at China and Saudi Arabia. They make Castro look like an amateur when it comes to human rights abuses and torture. We trade and visit with them every day."
522473,Guest,2002-07-15 00:01:00,0,Does anyone know how many cigars one person can take across the border. Thanks in advance.
522474,Guest,2002-07-15 07:27:00,0,Last year it was 50 cigars.

522476,Guest,2002-07-24 17:15:00,0,can you buy liquor across the border
522477,retire55,2002-07-24 17:53:00,1029,Jim:A rhetorical question I'm sure!
522478,Guest,2002-07-25 19:01:00,0,Canadians don't drink. The only place you can get beer and smokes and honest businees executives is in the USA.
522479,Guest,2002-07-26 07:56:00,0,I think the big question is --Can't you buy Cubans in Canada?
522480,Thumper,2002-07-26 13:51:00,133,Cubans are very available in Canada. I smoke Montecristos and Bolivars. Greatest cigars in the world.
522481,Guest,2002-07-27 11:24:00,0,"Hey there. The big question is.....why would you bring cigars with you, when you can buy yourself Cubans in Canada? You can find Cuban Cigars most anyplace. Cigar shops have become quite trendy and the selection is huge. FNE."
522482,iamwalleye1,2002-07-27 11:47:00,1589,50 per person! I have found when crossing @ international falls the cigars are a little high in price and not a great selection. just my 2 cents
