523271,Guest,2002-08-07 14:59:00,0,"Rog, Me and a friend of mine went to wabatongushi last september, the fishing is pretty good, alot of slot size walleye, we caught maybe two to three pike all week, but lots of small eyes, Who are you staying with?"
523272,Guest,2002-08-07 19:55:00,0,"We are staying at Loch Island , I was there about 5 years ago and we really had to work for the walleyes. I spent most of the time near the lodge which is near the dam, very deep water. I was thinking of going toward the north end where its a lot shallower, maybe the eyes would be more reachable."
523273,Guest,2002-08-08 15:27:00,0,"we caught most of our walleye straight across the lake from the lodge, trolling between the two points, we had to fish deep also.We talked to a guy that worked at one of the lodges on the north end of the lake and he said that the walleye fishing was much better on the south end of the lake. a good trick for the lake is a nightcrawler behing a bottom bouncer with no spinner or anything"

Bear Is and the northern end produced. My boss was there the same time as me and his group of 4 got over 300. Stumpy Bay was a little slow."
523270,Guest,2002-08-12 17:27:00,0,"Well my friend got back on sunday, didn't do as well as he had hoped, didn't get any walleyes over the new 22"" slot but caught a lot in the slot, he said the best spot they found was a spot called the ""rock pile"" up toward the north end of the lake. Thats about all he had to say, I think they did a lot more drinken than fishin.Rog"
