Is anyone familiar with Cliff Lake and any fishing camps there, or any other lakes. Please no large lakes like Eagle, Lake of the Woods, Lac Seul etc. ThanksHunter 1943"

I'm assuming you mean drive in lake? Been fishing there for thirty years and can tell you without a doubt that it's a great smallmouth fishery."

There are better lakes if you want to target smallies, others will give you suggestions, I target Walleye and when I stumble upon a smallie it's a bonus."
