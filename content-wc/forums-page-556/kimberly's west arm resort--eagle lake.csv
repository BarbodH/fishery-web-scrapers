Maybe give both of them a try. The staff at Andy Myers will put you on fish, even if you don't fish the lake regularly. That is there main goal. I obviously would not be going back there for 16 years if it weren't great.Squirt"

My wife and i called many times and left e-mails and could only talk to the owners son, who would only say to contact their dad, who would give us a price for my wife and kids for a week. We left two messages on the owners phone with no replies this year. Business must have been to good this year to accommodate us."

Steve Herbeck gets personally involved with you to ensure you and your group catch fish, regardless of what you are fishing for. I've never experienced anything like it. The guides, the staff, the food, the fish, the assistance are all second to none. Walleyes - expect to catch 50-100 per day, with a REAL chance to get a 30""+ fish during a week long stay, people often catch 1-2 30""+ fish each day!"
