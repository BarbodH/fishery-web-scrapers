1147488,Guest,2009-11-10 17:56:00,0,Just like the title says. What are your favorite cranks for fishing the river?
1147591,Johnnie Candle,2009-11-11 08:40:00,1037,"My biggest fish the last three years have came on #11 Deep Tail Dancers. Purpledescent is a great color as well as clown. This year I had some cusotm painted in Blue Berry Muffin and Lights Out and they did really well. Reef Runners work good as do Deep Thundersticks. Those are the only three baits I have caught fish on up there for the past few years. Long ago, we used Luhr Jensen Power Dive Minnows and Bomber 25 As with success."
1147597,hangneyes,2009-11-11 09:37:00,25,"we have always done well on bomber 25A, we also use Mann's stretch 20 and reefs. We did catch some fish on taildancers this year also. It seems like for us, the dark colors, black or purple, have been the best at night, and something with orange on it during the day."
1147701,Arkansas Dave,2009-11-11 19:03:00,56,What Johnnie forgot to tell you is that Firetiger has caught the first fish 8 of the 9 days we have fished up there in the past 3 years!
1147885,demasterangler,2009-11-13 06:17:00,196,"Wondering how you are fishing these , we have alot of trouble catching fall walleyes here in alberta .I have read quite a bit about cranking at Tobin , Pine falls , Red River . Are you presenting these some special way or just trolling . When I think of it I have a couple tail dancers ( never been in the water ) ... Riggin & Jiggin I guess I'M stuck Thanks DMA"
1147893,Guest,2009-11-13 07:05:00,0,"Not sure what type of lakes you would be fishing in ( Reservoirs or Praire Lakes ) At the Red River we run Crank baits upstream in early fall well the water temp is still warm & anchor up with jig fishing later in the fall. Pinefalls some guys will Crank the river upstream with down deep type raps or Cranks the large big lake ( lake Winnipeg ) mud flats with smaller cranks again this is in early fall & late fall anchor up with jigs on the lake mad flats. Slip fishing structure in the current on the Winnipeg river ( Jigs ) also can produce some nice fish. Reservoirs & Praire lakes with very little current most walleyes can be located just out side of weed beds, along rock/mud points or small feeder Creeks/Rivers."
1148055,Johnnie Candle,2009-11-14 11:55:00,1037,Don't quit trolling till the water is frozen!!!! We troll up stream 99% of the time. Find the channel edge and saty a few feet either side of it. Speed all depends. I have pulled cranbaits at Tobin as well as many other bodies of water with ice partially covering the lake and still smack em good.
1148202,Guest,2009-11-15 16:31:00,0,Johnnie how your hands?
1148356,Guest,2009-11-16 14:48:00,0,Thanks guys. It sure would be nice to be closer to Tobin. 12 degrees celcius today and 10 tomorrow. You always here people talk about Reef runners for Tobin. Is there a certain model or do they all produce? Thanks
