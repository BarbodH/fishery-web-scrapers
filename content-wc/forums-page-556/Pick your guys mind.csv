1141119,Obabikon,2009-10-09 16:02:00,2370,Oh come on! Women like shiney stuff... Buy her a stainless steel prop!
1141147,Moondog,2009-10-09 18:29:00,362,I wanna join the S.F.T.P.O.S.F.A.B.D.I.A. How do I sign up?
1141149,Guest,2009-10-09 18:29:00,0,Some really good ideas. Have two daughters who would love the spa thing with their mother. Wife doesn't like to fish and gets sea sick so we've never done the cruise thing. Girls do get together for a night out when guys are fishing but that's about all. They talked about a buss trip to Branson. Missionary trip sounds really good too. After last year's trip told my wife found a new girl in my life......6.5oz STELLA!!!!! Everything I hoped she would be.
1141884,Babamel2,2009-10-13 11:16:00,414,Why not pony up some counseling time so that you no longer feel guilty about spending the money. Then you could be comfortable not buying her anything. ( LOL )
1142548,Guest,2009-10-16 11:43:00,0,"Just be happy if you have a wife that can be ""bought off"" with a trip or a couple of shiney's. Trust me, there are some that would rather just save it up...would rather keep collecting points against, and never want to spend any of them. I love it when my bud's say: what ya gotta do is, get her a trip to a spa, girls night out, flowers, etc....if it were only that easy. LOL"
1142614,SinOrSwim,2009-10-16 19:51:00,1528,Get her a nice vacuum or a carpet cleaner. Maybe a new washer and dryer. Some nice embroidered sponges and towels. A monogrammed maid outfit? Let her know you didn't want her to be bored while you were fishing. Just kidding!!!!!! Anything Coach or Tiffany in the blue box and you can't lose.

You just might be surprised to find out by the time you get back she's even Steven, and then some! Remember, they are smarter than we will ever be. Keep'er On The Bottom, JohnB.O.A.T."
1144406,WalleyeWally28,2009-10-26 07:05:00,298,"I consider myself an extremely lucky man as my wife is as passionate about fishing as I am. She is my fishing buddy and I wouldn't have it any other way. She gets as excited as I do about a new rod, reel, fishing trip or gadget for the boat. We spent our honeymoon fishing Lac Seul for a week and had a great time. We take a Caribbean cruise every winter but It has nothing to do with getting even for summer fishing trips. Actually, we have gone deep sea fishing a couple of times during those trips. Fishing gives us the opportunity to spend some real quality time together doing something that we both enjoy. Yes, I do consider myself lucky as I know many of you have wives that have no interest in fishing and do not understand the passion we have for the sport."
1144408,rebs,2009-10-26 07:16:00,7587,"I like the getting her a very sexy french maid outfit, its a win win for both of you. LOL"
1146832,celticbass1,2009-11-06 18:44:00,67,"I agree with most everyone else, send her with friends to somewhere she wants to go, my wife visits a friend in Seattle."
1140923,Guest,2009-10-08 17:10:00,0,"Every year I try and buy my wife a gift equaling the cost of my fishing trip. Have bought jewelry (grandmother's ring, diamond earings, neklace.) Looking for something new. Any ideas? Anybody do something like this for their significant other?"
1140928,SkeeterJeff,2009-10-08 18:19:00,31,"Ummm... I buy my wife a fishing trip too. In fact, she is the one that convinced me to take our first fishing trip to Canada. Jeff"
1140932,rpieske,2009-10-08 18:57:00,1276,"Buy her a weekend package at a fancy spa. If you have a daughter, maybe for the two of them. They will love the chance to get away together for some ""special"" time."
1140944,Obabikon,2009-10-08 19:42:00,2370,"Vegas baby... that's where my wife is going in a couple weeks. (with her sister, while I baby sit at home) A cruise is a nice less expensive trip to take... New car, upgrade her wedding ring w/ more diamonds, the theatre, a new shiny calcutta bait caster..."
1140950,Hot Runr Guy,2009-10-08 20:14:00,16062,"Mrs. HRG would like the equivalent value in cash, that she could spend guilt-free as and when she desired. Of course, as long as you use multiple credit cards and checking accounts, she'll have a hard time determining what YOU really spent on your trip! HRG"
1140974,46Harley,2009-10-08 23:22:00,149,Last year the wife went to China with a group from our church. This year a road trip to the Grand Canyon with her girlfriends. I think she has this figured out.P.S. Don't let your wife read this.
1140979,Terwalleye,2009-10-09 02:36:00,166,"This has to be a wife posing, to get her hubby to pony up some diamonds. My wife gets the house to herself for the week."
1141006,Pooch,2009-10-09 07:11:00,4619,"My wife likes to go someplace warm for a week or so in the winter. Sometimes we go together and other times she and her friends go together without the hubbies. As long as I'm spending time in Canada doing what I really enjoy, then she should be able to spend time where she can do what she enjoys. In the not too distant future we will most likely be too old to do the things we truly enjoy. As long as a person can afford the expense then I believe you should do it. Many of my buddies are now gone without ever getting to do what they wanted. Others have lost their wives. They waited too long thinking that they had time, but they did not. Do things with your wife, even if it's not what you like to do. Heck, on occasion I've been known to hang out in Quilt shops. These little mini-dates are fun and you will never regret them when the show is over and the credits are rolling. Interesting subject and along with others we have all pondered this at some time or another. Pooch"
1141058,bob oh,2009-10-09 10:49:00,3936,Maybe she isn't by herself??? LOL
1141092,Lovetofish,2009-10-09 13:34:00,458,Buy her a new boat. LOL
