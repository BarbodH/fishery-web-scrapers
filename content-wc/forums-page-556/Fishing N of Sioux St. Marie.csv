1146337,saulteyes,2009-11-04 13:13:00,32,Do you mean sault ste marie or Sioux Lookout?
1146579,Babamel2,2009-11-05 11:20:00,414,"I shoud have said, Sioux St. Marie, Ontario, North of Mackinac Michigan"
1146645,celticbass1,2009-11-05 17:24:00,67,"It's not really north of the Sault but I think it's about two hours mainly east. This is a camp that you drive to a boat landing, they boat you about 45 minutes to an island with about six cabins on it and you get your boat and motor once you arrive. The main lake is really a series of many large lakes that have been combined because of a dam and it's HUGE (thousands of acres). We did not find the fishing on the main lake to be particularly good but many of the outlying lakes were superb. Some of them were a challenge to get to but if you don't mind short hikes and carrying some equipment then this would be a good trip for you. If you or the wife don't want to walk and carry things don't bother because the fishing on the main lake was that bad. The cabins were very clean and well situated so you weren't right on top of each other, they ran a generator every night until about 11:00 P.M., there are only pit toilets but they were as good as pit oilets can be. They have showers with hot water and the boats were VERY nice. The price was pretty cheap but a little high for a boat in and make sure that you get the total price in writing. By the way the area was one of the most beautiful we've been to in Canada. It's in the La Cloche Mountains of Kilarney Park and the views were amazing. It's about 10 miles south of Espanola Ontario and took us eight hours to get to from Kalamazoo, MI. Hope this helps."

There's another camp nearby that has cottages on both sides of Hwy. 129 on the shores of both Tunnel Lake & Cummings Lake and should be within your travel criteria. Talked to the owners of Grand Falls Camp a few times & they seemed like very nice folks. Never had an opportunity to stay there yet. Tunnel is a reservoir created by a dam on the Mississagi R. The lake has decent s.m., walleye & pike fishing....and not overly populated. Haven't fished Cummings. I recall there being other camps along Hwy. 129, north or Thessalon and south of Chapleau as well. Good luck with your search. Ken"
1148424,saulteyes,2009-11-16 20:02:00,32,"There are no walleyes in Cummings lake. Only lakers, whitefish and smallies. Rocky Island lake is another res. lake that has cabins and good walleye fishing. I don't know what the cabins are like."
1149008,michigan fish magnet,2009-11-19 11:18:00,14,Rocky Island is pretty remote. I wouldn't bring your wife unless she is hard core. Walleye fishing is fair. The outfit supply co. is who use to run it a few years ago. 7058423560
