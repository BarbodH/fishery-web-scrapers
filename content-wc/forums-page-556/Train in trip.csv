O'Sullivan is probably as far north as we have gone. We will be coming from southwest Michigan and typically have around 900 pounds of gear for four guys including beer, food, clothing, and fishing gear. We would like to stay on a remote lake and would like to be in a cabin rather than having to haul in camping gear, is there such a place? I wouldn't even mind being up near Moosonee but we would like to keep it around $700.00 per person with boats motors, cabin included, is that possible and if so what are the logistics of getting on and off the train etc... Thanks."
1146876,Gary from Iowa,2009-11-07 05:29:00,74,"There are a number of resorts along the Algoma Central Raiway. More than 20 years ago my brothers and a sister-in-law met at St. Ste. Marie and drove to Hawk Junction and boarded the train to milepost 210, Oba Lake, Sonny-Bob Lodge. We put our gear including beer, clothes, food and a 6 hp Johnson outboard in a freight car and rode in a passenger car. When it came time to leave. We flagged the train down and reversed the process. As I recall weight isn't an issue and you were allowed so many parcels per person (we taped 2 cases of beer together to reduce the parcels). There are a number of resorts along the railway. I think if you could haul a canoe up the railway and depart and reboard in a similar manner. Do a Google search for resorts along the Algoma-Central Railway.BTW, VIA serves some lodges: Allenwater Bridge and Flindt Landing Camp come to mind. I'm sure there are more.Good luck and good fishing!Gary"

The lake is famous for its large perch and walleye fishing. I haven't fished there but have thought about it. Nice to have someone else do the driving. I am pasting a link to a resort that promotes such trips.http://www.lakeviewlodgedl.com/ice.htmlGary"
