1145835,Mike Kansas,2009-11-02 07:32:00,1463,"Lac Seul, Lost Island Lodge....We are primarily Walleye fisherman but have caught at least one 40""++ Pike on every trip there. Last year the last day my wife caught a 42"" and four more over 36"" on our last day casting a 1 1/2 oz spinner bait. It was the first time we spent a half day just Pike fishing. I was driving the boat and she was casting. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"

1146047,WalleyeWally28,2009-11-03 08:30:00,298,"Lac Seul is one of the finest walleye fisheries in Ontario and also offers decent fishing for northerns. You can choose drive-to or boat-in resorts (american or housekeeping plans), outpost cabins or houseboats. My wife and I have fished LS for the past 13 years and have never been disappointed."
1144989,reconssd,2009-10-28 16:06:00,147,"Greetings everyone. My fishing party has fished Eagle, Crow, and LOTW. We are looking for a new fishery within 4 hours of the border. We have fished lakes farther north too, but the goal in 2010, is to not drive more than 4 hours. Are there any lakes or lodges you would recommend? My fishing group fishes more for Northern Pike, however, 2 of the guys like walleyes too. Any ideas, experiences, or recommendations are greatly appreciated. Thanks for taking the time to read this post and thanks in advance for your replies."
1144992,Nimstug,2009-10-28 16:25:00,2605,"I've been to Camp Narrows on the North Arm (the far west end) of Rainy Lake twice. About 15 miles west and 15 miles north of I.F. It's a boat-in, American plan, or cook yourselfGood walleye, northern, and smallmouth fishing. The times we've been there in mid September, there was always a group of 3 or 4 boats that fished exclusively for northerns.Lots of islands and bays so wind is not an issue.Have fun shopping.NimstugSupport The Right To Keep and Arm Bears!"
1144994,dutchboy,2009-10-28 16:27:00,5717,Lac Seul.Everything you are looking for and then some.
1145000,JDP,2009-10-28 17:23:00,1457,"What are you and your group looking for in terms of a lodge /resort amenities: What is important (Housekeeping, American Plan, etc) Are you open to a Houseboat? This will help get you get even more suggestions. JDP"
1145005,rather-be-fishin,2009-10-28 18:04:00,429,"Lac Seul is an AWESOME WALLEYE lake.....there are northern too, but LOTS more walleye!"
1145011,reconssd,2009-10-28 18:41:00,147,"Thanks to everyone for your replies. JDP - to respond to your question, the cabin and lodge isn't important to my group. The quality of the fishing is the most important issue. We are certainly open to doing a house boat."
1145096,JDP,2009-10-29 08:53:00,1457,PM sent to you.
1145195,Guest,2009-10-29 18:31:00,0,About 4 hours from the border would put you around the twin cities I'm not sure about fishing in that area
1145273,Guest,2009-10-30 05:09:00,0,one extra hour drive and you are in the redlake area
1145275,81Saluki,2009-10-30 05:44:00,97,"Take a look at the Indian Lake Chain. There are 4 lodges available ... Indian Lake Lodge, Clarks Camp/KCs Landing, and Forest Lake Lodge. We have a cabin on Forest. Good walleye, northern and smallmouth, great muskie. 3 hours north of IFalls near Vermilion Bay. I've heard it's better than Eagle."
