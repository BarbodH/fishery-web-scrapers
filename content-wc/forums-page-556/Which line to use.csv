1147317,IRISHATTACK,2009-11-10 05:05:00,44,"I am going to Anglerskingdom in June. I was wondering what kind of line to buy and what LBS. I normally use fireline, but I have been reading about Power Pro. Any thoughts would be great.."
1147325,Whopper,2009-11-10 06:19:00,340,"Irish I fish the next lake downstream and here are my set ups For walleye sticks I use 8lb Berkley Fireline and tie on a 6' 15lb fluorocarbon leader, this set up will land any walleye in the lake and help with those pesky pike bite offs. Pike rods, I use two set ups both on heavy rods 80lb Power Pro for fishing heavy cover and 50lb Power Pro for open water, both with heavy fluorocarbon leaders. Hope this helps"
1147975,celticbass1,2009-11-13 16:19:00,67,"I have no idea where or what lake Anglerskingdom is but on two of my walleye rods I use the old standard 6lb. Stren Clear Blue Florescent. On the other two walleye rods I use 12-2 pound fireline with no leader of any kind. The mono rods I use for jigging and the other two I throw cranks and senko worms. For pike I use two medium baitcast rods, both with twelve pound mono and a steel or titanium leader. Never had any trouble loosing fish. Sometimes I loose quite a few jigs with the 6lb. mono but I've always considered it the cost of doing business."
1148362,Steve of Madison,2009-11-16 15:15:00,230,"All of my reels are filled with XL 12lb. Over the years I have followed the crowd to florocarbons, braids etc etc and always felt that it didn't make any difference. In the stained water of LS mono is plenty good. And I use that heavy because when I get hung up on a rock I can roll it over and when a Pike hits at least I have a chance.My pike rods have Power Pro but get ready for the twists and birds-nests associated with light, very limp braid. If you use a baitcaster check your magnets regularly!!!"
1148366,Javelin360,2009-11-16 15:41:00,548,I like Stren 12 lb Hi Vis gold for Walleye. I like to fish in early spring and late fall and find it stays supple at colder temps. Suffix and some of the others don't.
