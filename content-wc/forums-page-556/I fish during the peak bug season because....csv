1148958,Lovetofish,2009-11-19 08:57:00,458,I like late July for the same reason's Steve of Madison wrote. The only thing I might add is that the water is usually warm enough to jump in and the kids love it. It's going to be a long winter.

For us, a personal choice was mid-August. Stable weather, big fish are on the reefs, and cold weather was a very rare occurance. Fall can be fantastic, but you have to be ready for it. The earlier seasons, for us, were less predictable. Fishing was good, but weather could be nasty. Bugs were never a big factor either way. I did a few trips to eastern Ontario some years back, where the blackflies and skeeters made the trip miserable, in the boat, on shore, or in the cabins. Wouldn't care to repeat those."
1148690,keek,2009-11-18 06:19:00,1003,For those of you that do fish Canada during the peak bug season is it because it's the only time you can pull off the trip due to other responsibilities? Or is because it's FREAKIN' CANADA BABY!! and there are fish to be caught and you could care less about bugs?I'm in the middle of putting my first trip to Canada together and would like your insight. Thanks

As for the bugs we dont plan our trip around them at all..theyre just a nuisance at best..but the no seeums did tear me up last year..
1148699,Guest,2009-11-18 07:04:00,0,"This is, in my opinion, the best time to fish if you have stable weather conditions. Deet is a wonderful thing. Bugs are rarely an issue on the water. They certainly aren't a problem in the cabin. So really they are a pain for the time it takes to get to the boat fom the cabin and vice versa. Not a big deal. Don't let them deter you from having one of the best experiences of your life."
1148712,AB,2009-11-18 08:18:00,61,"The bugs can be hit or miss at anytime, normal weather is what I like best too. Repeat trips at the same time period helps the learning curve."
1148719,rapp,2009-11-18 08:55:00,48,I live in northern Ontario and June is your best bet especially on the first full moon. Some year we have a late spring then you may consider the last Two week of June. The Bug high season is also a hit & misses again depending on the weather. The peak only last a week. Very few bugs on the water. Opening weekend always good in the rivers or at mouth of the lake.
1148748,2746,2009-11-18 11:15:00,3206,What bugs? The only time I've ever noticed them is in evening when we are sitting on the deck with a cold one or deep frying fish. A little spray and all's well.
1148789,Guest,2009-11-18 14:54:00,0,"My group went consistently in early June for many years, and we enjoyed and gained lots of advantage by learning how a lake fishes in the same time period year after year. However weather conditions (late spring/early spring, etc) still meant you couldn't take things for granted. As for the bugs, I agree with what the others have said....they aren't a problem on the water, and you might have a lot of bugs in camp, or you might have a cold night or two and knock them back for a few days. As out group got allder we started having kids weddings and graduations, and early June started getting hard to do. Lately we've gone anywhere from mid-June to mid August, and really enjoy that too. The fish aren't stacked up like they are in spring, but it's fun exploring and finding the next hotspot. So I agree with the others, I would never try to plan a trip around what the bugs might be doing. We had one year where the ankle biting flies tormented us in the boats all week, that was mid-summer and more annoying than any early June bug situation."
1148808,keek,2009-11-18 16:07:00,1003,"Thanks for the input everyone! This is great, especially about returning the same time each year to give yourself a learning comparrison of what/where/how the fish are biting during that time frame. Man I can't wait to get up there. I just winterized my boat today and I'm already looking forward to ripping that tarp off!"
1148833,johnboat,2009-11-18 17:33:00,2014,Bugs..Smugs. Let's go fishin!
1148836,Steve of Madison,2009-11-18 17:36:00,230,"We go in July...why? Because it is easier to find a week when the group can go, the weather is MUCH more stable, the big ones are supposed to be where the big ones live, the weed lines are defined, and the fish are hungry. Now if you have been to the great White North in recent years all of these factor have not been in place at the same time...but they are supposed to be.As for the bugs, spray or a Thermo Cell both work great, in the boat, on the pier, or on the deck waiting for the fish to cook, unbelievable, and I don't want to know why, just know that they do.Finally...if you are lucky, the Northern Lights can give you a show of a lifetime duing the warmer evenings in July."
