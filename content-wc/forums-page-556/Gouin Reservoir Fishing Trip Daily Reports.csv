1127345,slug72,2009-08-08 19:33:00,34,"Hi all, I know many people on this site focus on western Ontario but this board has helped me immensely with information on my Quebec trip to the Gouin Reservoir. So, I am repaying the help by utilizing the satellite internet from Nemio Outfitters to post daily reports about our trip. I hope some of you find this thread helpful to future trip planning. First, I need to tell you that we are walleye rookies. I am from PA and focus most of my efforts on smallmouth bass. Most of my past Canadian trips have focused on pike and bass. So walleye has only been an occasional target for me. I am also fishing with my dad and two sons (ages 14 and 11). All three do most of their fishing on yearly fishing trips. So, much of my time is spent helping them try to enjoy their trip. So however we do, I am sure others with more experience and aptitude could do better. Ok, let's start with the ride into camp on dirt roads which has been a focus of much discussion on this and other forums. I have to be perfectly honest. I didn't like it. I didn't like it at all. I drive a subaru forester which is the minimum I would recommend for the trip. Yes, there were others seemingly doing fine with minivans and small cars but I wouldn't have felt comfortable with it. I was able to average about 40 mph. Sometimes, a bit faster but my advice to anyone who hasn't done it is take it slow. Was the drive worth it? I'll tell you at the end of trip. We got to Nemio Outfitters about 2:45 and were immediately greeted by the very friendly hosts, Ron and Rosie. I don't think we are going to have any issues with them. I'll let you know if we do but my guess is that we won't. For Americans who are concerned about English/French issues, you will have no issues with Ron and Rosie. We finally got to some fishing about 5:30P after settling into camp. We decided to staty in the Nemio River for the evening rather than heading out to the Gouin. The spawn was not good on the Nemio this spring and it doesn't have as many fish this year. But we seemed to pick up a walleye or two everywhere we stopped. No one got skunked and everyone caught a few. I think 13 was the total and a number of fish were missed. All in all good fishing for walleye novices on a new body of water. Nothing big but very pretty golden fish. No pike this evening. We used mostly jigs and Gulp Alive shiners and leaches. Shiners seemed to be getting the nod. The owner told us not to worry about jig color too much but we found that pink jigs seemed to be working better than anything else. Fish were in 10 to 14' of water. Forgot to say, that we saw a lynx on the way in. To sum up the first day, rough drive but very pleasant evening on the water. Chris"
1127390,McQ,2009-08-09 05:23:00,615,"Hey Chris - good to see you have arrived. I m stuck here at home and will have to be satisfied following your adventure thru this thread. Had a reaction to my meds that created a mobility problem with my legs, improving daily but will take some time to get back to normal. Looks like the fishing is over for this year. Fell free to email me - my address is in Rosie s computer - it would be a pleasure to help put you on fish. You re right - the road can be a challenge when you experience it for the first time, I ve seen it as rough as it can get and also as smooth as a super highway over the years - just have to adjust your driving to the current conditions. Bill"
1127425,phishfearme,2009-08-09 08:39:00,1242,"slug - keep the reports comin'. always like to hear how others are doing. as a fellow PA'er, i've considered the gouin many times but always seem to end up in NW ontario - abit of a longer drive but good roads and an incredible amount of water. thanks, phish p.s. McQ good to hear from you - always"
1127477,slug72,2009-08-09 13:24:00,34,"Unless the weather changes a bit, I think we are done for the day. A morning fishable drizzle has turned into pretty steady soaking rain. I am sure some of you would fish through it and I might if it wasn't for the boys. But I've learned (the hard way) that making a fishing trip enjoyable for kids means sometimes playing cards in the cabin. Ok so the fishing, we decided to fish the river again because of the weather. Probably a wise decision as it doesn't seem like those who came in from the Reservoir fared much better than us. This morning found us amateurs stumbling on a few fish. The boys and my dad kept me busy with a triple at one point. That provide some excitement and a lot of smiles. We didn't knock them dead but caught enough to keep us entertained for the morning. Biggest fish was a decent sized 20 incher. One small pike was thrown into the mix. Jigs with Gulp shiners worked along with live leeches which my oldest son wanted to use but I don't have the knack of handling. My boys decided to head back to cabin at around 11A. My dad and I stuck with it until about 2p when the rain really started to pour. We tried to troll up some pike but only had one eater walleye on a blue and silver hot n tot. Well, it stopped raining as I am writing this so there may be some hope of getting out after supper. By the way, the meals here at Nemio are fantastic. I'll report back if we go out. One other note, the stomachs of the walleye we've kept and cleaned have been pretty empty. They just don't seem to be feeding much unless you put the meal right in front of their nose. Chris"
1127782,NYBowHunter,2009-08-10 16:46:00,35,"Thanx for the update on your drive to Nemio - I've been wondering what the drive was like on that road from Parent. During the '80's and early '90's we used to access Gouin via the Clova road and while adventurous the first couple of times, it got to be downright annoying, expensive and even dangerous the more we went. The last trip we made on that road was in '94 - recent rain had washed out the ""road"" and it was seven hours of driving on perpetual speed bumps. I lost my complete muffler system, front passenger side shock and the complete disc brake assembly also on the same side. Since we got out to the main road late, I had to drive the truck home in this condition all night. Since then we've always flown in which may seem more expensive but I wonder after you factor in the wear on the vehicle and safety factors."
1127823,slug72,2009-08-10 18:57:00,34,"Today was a tough day. A bit frustrating for me as I can't determine whether the fishing was just slow or if I am not doing the right thing. The other group I spoke with caught about 7 this evening but in a short 20 minute span and they fished for several hours. But judging by their tackle, I am not sure their real walleye experts either. We made it out to the actual Reservoir this morning. You can't appreciate the size until you are out there. We only saw a tiny fraction of it and it was huge. Somewhat initimidating. We picked up one walleye early but that would be our only walleye for the day unless you count one goofing around at the dock and one about 5 inches. Pike saved the morning for us picking up a few up to 28 inches. I know some walleye fanatics don't care for pike but pike helped keep excitement in the boat this morning for us. Feeling a little discouraged tonight but I put a lot of pressure on myself to try to keep the fishing decent for my dad and kids. Probably too much pressure. The Reservoir is a bit intimidating but I know the fishing can be sensational out there. I am torn between fishing the river where we've had some success and heading back out to the Reservoir for another try tomorrow. I'll make my mind up in the morning. Chris"
1128398,slug72,2009-08-12 19:40:00,34,"Today was a day of two halves. The morning was rough. We went to a spot recommended by Bill McCue. Looked like a great area but the boys had little concentration left. They've done so well this week that I couldn't be upset. After about an hour of trying to find fish, I asked them if they want to go swimming. Big smiles crossed both of their faces. After playing around shore for awhile, my oldest son said that he could swim across the small bay. I said no way. Following him in the boat, he successfully crossed the bay and was very happy to prove his old man wrong. Then I took them back to the camp for the afternoon. My dad and I went out for a couple hours of trolling for pike. I trolled one of my favorite big pike baits, a 6 inch white swimbait. On one pass, I missed a decent pike. The next pass, I hooked into a really big walleye. I didn't land him but it was big. How big? Not sure but it was certainly a trip maker. Then this evening, we followed the owner's father, who spends a lot of time up here, out to a spot. He showed us how to fish it. No one knocked them dead but we had ok action. They are really biting very soft. The owner's dad said that they really aren't feeding that actively right now, especially compared to the last couple of weeks. Oh well, we had a nice evening, beautiful sunset, beautiful scenery, and a few walleye. Finally in all of my years of handling pike, I've never come into contact with their teeth. Tonight was my first. It was just a little hammer handle but their teeth are sharp. My thumb bled all over the boat. Hoping the fish turn on tomorrow. Supposed to be real hot. We'll see... Chris"
1128416,slug72,2009-08-12 20:40:00,34,"A lot of people ask me why I go to Canada when there are good places to fish in PA. I just came in from staring at the stars, beautiful, stunning, awesome. I have a hard time explaining to people the lure of Canada. But when I looked at the stars tonight, I knew exactly why. Chris"
1128449,McQ,2009-08-13 05:19:00,615,"Chris - you've discovered the very reason why I've been heading north for so many years. It's really not the fishing but the vast expanses of the area, there is nothing like the evening sky following a glowing sunset and as the stars emerge WOW - it truly lets you know just how simple life shoud be. Back to the fishing = the area I've directed you to to is comprised of all the structural elements that are a mecca for walleye. You will have to spend some time picking apart the grid but I guarantee you the walleye are holding in the general area. Using your sonar follow the contour of the points and humps in water from 25 -15' you will run across the pods. the weather is improving and the winds will be light so maybe try back trolling for better speed contol and precision. Fine tune your harness presentation - 2 oz bottom bouncers and rigs with #4 holograpic blades or chartreuse are the prime colors - tip each hook with an alive leech or 3"" minnow. Slow is the key so watch your speed, you just want the blade to turn easily. If you are using cranks SR 7's in walleye or perch patterns are the goto for the 15' levels and to cover the 20'+ use black/gold Hot n Tots. Walleye this season are not running as deep because of the cooler temps and the prime bite will be between 10 AM and 2 PM during the height of the day. They will be tight to the edges so you have to be precise when you're covering an area. You can also take advantage of an evening fish and troll the sandy beach areas with SR 7's from the 10' level up to the surface. You need to troll to find the fish, simply because of the large area that has to be covered and once you run into a pod set the anchor and jig up your limit. Man, do I wish I was there."
1128451,Golden Eagle,2009-08-13 05:50:00,2642,"Half moon today. Might expect to experience a bump in fishing, especially between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. Thanks for bringing the reports.Good luck."
1128488,Larry Mac,2009-08-13 08:21:00,530,"Hi Chris. I am very happy that you and yours are enjoying all the different aspects of the Great Canadian Wilderness. It has been said many times that catching fish is just a bonus, I truly believe this.When we were in Canada last week with the kids the walleye bite was truly a very soft (light) bite. When we located the fish I taught the boys the fishing technique that I call ""Dead Sticking"" and they could not believe the results. What we do is fish the smallest possible jig you can get away with, no twister tail just plain, and add a piece of meat (minnow, crawler or leech). Let the jig fall all the way to bottom, reel up 6"" to 12"", run the line over your index finger of your reel hand and hold the rod perfectly still. Keep you boat still and watch your rod tip and feel line with your finger for the slightest of movement or change and set the hook. The bite we were experiencing was lighter that any small perch or bluegill pecking at the meat. We were catching 18"" to 24"" walleye like this. It is truly amazing how light a fish can bite. Many times all we would feel is no jig at all. I hope you and yours continue to enjoy your trip North. You are creating memories of a lifetime. Have a great trip.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1128542,Guest,2009-08-13 11:56:00,0,"You have me wondering with your statement that that prime bite will be at mid-day 10 till 2. You have spent more time on the Gouin this year than I probably will get to spend there in my lifetime, and I highly value your advice. Any further thoughts on why mid-day will be the best bite? It seems to contradict everything I have ever learned over the years about 'eyes.....that being that they are light sensitive and bite best at dawn and dusk, or after dark. My gang might embrace this with ease.....we can stay up later at night playing poker over a few beers, have a leisurely breakfast, and hit the water at 9:30 ! Any further thoughts are much appreciated. Thanks!"
1128548,McQ,2009-08-13 12:39:00,615,"Buzzard - the mid day bite is something I've learned over the years and although contrary to accepted advice holds true and especially in August. Fishing Canadian walleye tournaments in the past with a ""no live bait"" rule provided a learning curve in adapting. I have fond memories of a week in the company of Tony Puccio from Bait Rigs tackle, we were on the Gouin for a series of television shoots and one day while looking for fish Tony asked me if there was a shallow reef in the area, as chance would have it there was and Tony proceeded to give me a lesson in shallow jigging walleye pulling 3 - 5 lb fish from 4' of water under bright blue bird sky conditions at noon of the day. On another occasion two years later that same reef produced 62 fish in an hour for my for partner and I, no giants but non stop fun. The bait that day was 1/32 marabou crappie jigs. If there is one piece of advice I can offer anyone it's important to adapt, sometimes to the point of throwing the book away. When it comes to the Gouin and it's shear size and varied waters there are a couple of elements that make the mid day bite so strong. 1. There is ample deep water surrounding mid lake structure that makes it easy for fish to move up and down at their leisure. 2. The competition for limited food is intense so an agressive bite can be discovered virtually anywhere. 3. On the main the month of August provides stable conditions and the food fish will settle into areas generally related to jumbled rock and sand edges. The rock holds miniscule food that the bait feeds on and the sand is just a bit warmer than the surrounding deeps and also has a food base. When you run across mid lake elements or shoreline features that hold promise give them a try, you'll be pleasantly surprised. The spot on the spot is the target here. Put the pattern together and your day can provide intense fishing and ample time to follow other pursuits like food, beer & poker. ps: a number of my better fish came out of 2' of water (largest 7 lb) at the end of June this year. Some on harnesses with the blade spinning in the prop wash. So much for spooking walleye shallow EH!"
1128693,kyle870,2009-08-14 05:16:00,26,Great thing taking the boys they will never forget it maybe even haul you up there when your old and decrepit been taking mine since he was 9. Got access to lead core and hotntots? The old metal lipped ones will bounce off the rocks hard to hang up. a moving boat is alot cooler. They will fish 25 ft easily Gold nblack goodluck.
1128723,Guest,2009-08-14 07:56:00,0,"Thanks again for the info. We'll definitely try to vary our routine and see what happens. When you only have the one week in paradise you tend to obsess on the ""tried and true"" and not experiment a lot. Two of our group this year are very psyced to give the Big Nords a try. We arrive in 2 weeks....my thought is that shallow bays off deep water might be the ticket to tangling with a large Nord. Me? Unless the walleye wear me out, I'll be sticking to the walleye fishing. These next two weeks are sure going to drag. Keep the threads coming guys!"
1128725,Guest,2009-08-14 08:05:00,0,"So glad to hear you and the boys had the experience of being in the right place at the right time and catching a bunch of walleye. My twin boys are 19 now.... and to this day, you should see their faces when they tell the tales of their first Gouin trip. Time well spent Sir, and a bond that will last forever with your boys. You'll be back! Good fishing to ya for the rest of your week."
1128875,slug72,2009-08-14 19:13:00,34,"The infamous last day of the fishing trip. We had another really good day to tease us with how good fishing can be on the Gouin. This morning was really good for #s and size. We caught about 25 in 3 hours. The last fish we caught about 11A (Read post by McQ earlier in the thread) was the biggest of the trip in at 3 1/2 to 4 pounds. Leaches in 20' of water was key. We also caught our biggest pike of the trip measuring just over 30 inches at this same spot. The pike gave my son Cole a thrill as it leaped out of the water as he was pulling his bait into the boat. It hooked up and after a short fun battle was landed. Amazingly all week, we did not have one pike slice our 8lb monofilament. All pike were caught in the corner of the mouth. Back to walleye...today's fish averaged 1 1/2 to 2 pounds without many small ones in the mix. All week the stomachs of the fish that we have been catching have been empty. Today one of our fish had a 5 inch partially digested baitfish in its mouth. If you are coming to the Gouin in the next few weeks, I suspect you may find some real good fishing, especially if the weather stays stable. We only fished for a few hours this morning for a few different reasons but I suspect we could've added to our numbers if we would have fished hard throughout the afternoon. On one hand as a fisherman, I would've loved to keep fishing but as a dad, I made the right decision to not push it. This evening we got out for a few hours after dinner. Fishing was good. We put about a dozen in the boat. Nothing real big tonight but a solid pound average. The consistent bit just stopped around 7:30. Another group in camp experienced the same thing. I'll put a summary up when I get home."
1129632,slug72,2009-08-18 10:07:00,34,"Thanks again to everyone for thier input and suggestions. I thought that I would put one final post up with my reflections about the trip now that I have been home for a few days. 1) We hit a tough fishing week. No one in camp had much better results than us. The stomachs of all the fish that we cleaned were empty. They just didn't seem to be actively feeding. The last two days that provided good fishing were after a couple days of pretty stable weather. According to the owners, they just haven't had much stable weather this summer. Even though fishing wasn't up to Gouin standards, we caught a bunch of fish. We weren't skunked on any day and each day caught at least 5 or 6 walleye. I can't compare it to Northwest fisheries like Lac Seul, Gullrock or Wabaskang since I haven't been there but I don't know many places in Eastern Ontario and Quebec that will produce at least a half dozen walleye on the toughest of fishing days. When the fishing was good, they were pretty easy to catch. I am very confident that day long fishing by decent walleye fishemen would've put 100+ walleye in the boat on both Thursday and Friday. 2) Using Gulp Alive produced mixed results. Its hard to say but I think the slight edge has to go to live leaches but the Gulp Alive minnows were a close second. We tried the Gulp Alive leaches jigging with mediocre results. We did not troll as the kids just weren't into it. So, I can't comment on the effectiveness of Gulp Alive leaches on crawler harnesses. Based on these results, I will be sure to carry Gulp Alive minnows on future trips. By the way, this was my first time using any Gulp Alive products. 3) Nemio Outfitter - These folks were first class all the way. Rosie and Ron were terrific. We had no issues throughout the trip so I can't comment on how they handle problems. We did the meal plan for breakfast and dinner. Food was terrific and very filling. Their boats were perfect for jigging with 2 adults and 2 kids (14 and 12) in the boat. They were very stable and fast enough for our purposes. If you have any concerns about going to French speaking Quebec, this is not a concern at all with Ron and Rosie. Rosie's first language is English and Ron speaks excellent English. 4) Ok, one last comment about the roads...the roads treated me much better going back. I think I understood how to drive them better. I averaged about 40 mph when on the main road. The first 27km from camp, you have to go much slower. A lot of people went faster than I did but I was able to maintain a good consistent pace without as many adrenaline rush moments as I had on my way in. That said, I still didn't like the dirt roads and they were the only real negative for the entire trip. 5) Finally, would I go back? Absolutely! I also couldn't see us going anywhere other than Nemio for a return trip to the Gouin. My daughter will be going on her first fishing trip next time (probably 2011). So, I'll have to consider whether the walleye and pike only set up on the Gouin is the best place to introduce her to fishing trips or not. But I wholeheartedly and without reservation recommend anyone who wants to target walleye to go to the Gouin and specifically visit Nemio Outfitters. If you have any questions, I'll be glad to answer. I did this thread to help others like myself who are considering a trip to the Gouin. I hope it was helpful and good luck fishing to everyone."
1129853,McQ,2009-08-19 05:55:00,615,"Chris, I'm happy the overall experience was so good - certainly the results would have been better if trolling would have been part of the agenda. It appears you were able to keep the kids involved and thats a great thing for the future. The road is just another part of the trip and another reason to enjoy the north. Well I've been challenged to stop feeling sorry for myself by an old buddy so will be going up on the 26th for a few days. The legs are working a bit better so getting to and from the docks shouldn't be an issue, more important of course is getting to the dining room for Rosie's cooking, LOL. If a future trip presents itself make sure to email me and I'll do my best to be there. Bill"
1131653,Guest,2009-08-26 08:15:00,0,"The gang and I leave Saturday for our week on the Gouin. I promise to provide a detailed report on our return. Anticipation? I have one foot in the boat and it will be 3 days before we hit the water. Today is pick-up day for our partner who is flying up from New Orleans for the trip. He's even more psyced than I am....if that is possible. The weather report says low temps early in the week to be in the 30's. Have long johns, will travel."

1134561,Ark_Man,2009-09-08 15:03:00,1,"Here are my observations/opinions after fishing Gouin during the week of Aug30-Sept4th.Over all fishing  pretty difficult this year due to high water; it seems like many holes that we found weren't holding that much fish because of extra water which did not require fish to be stocked up in holes only. We only found concentration of fish once, but were picking up few fish in many various places that we tried, 15-20ft of water. We had sunny conditions pretty much every day, so mornings and late afternoons seemed more productive.Walleyes  there seems to be decent number, but a lot of small fish. I wanted to fish lures only, (cranks, plastic and bucktail jigs) and they were pretty difficult to catch on those; many short takes. We managed to get a few over couple days, decent size, but not large numbers. We tried worms later on (tipped our jigs with half of a crawler) and we got better numbers, but many small fish, a lot of them in 12-14 in range. Small jigs in bright colors (orange, pink and chartruse) were the most productive. Pike  I expected little larger pike but no avail. We targeted them almost as much as walleyes. Typical pike spots (weed edges/drop offs) produced only in one day when there was overcast before it got sunny for rest of the week; rest of the pike we caught were relatively deep, feeding on walleyes in 15-20ft of water. We caught quite few jigging for walleye and trolling with deep running cranks. I think I got about 5 hammer handles on 3inch grub in 20 ft of water, which was little surprising. 2 larger once we caught and kept for lunch (30, 27) had 10 inch walleyes in their stomachs. We found a lot of pike-looking water (weedy bays), but they were not there, deep water produced much better.Other species  managed to catch quite few large chubs, few with jigs and few with spinners. I think they were still feeding on leftover mayfly hatch. Also one decent size perch on a jig.Nature  aahhh, that was the best part. The trip was worth just for the solitude we got; very few people outhere, we only saw 5 or so boats the whole week, and most of them Thur-Fri before Labor day weekend. Orange sunets, full moon and bright nights were perfect sceneries for camp fires. Fresh air and spring water we drank sharpened our senses and were much deserved break from chemicals and concrete world I live in every day. Loons were singing their funky tunes wherever we went. The nice bonus was seeing big bear mother with 3 cubs trying to cross the lake in narrow channel; we managed to get very close to them before the mother heard us and swam back to the shore, followed by the young ones. She was pretty angry but patiently awaited for every last one of their kids to get back to the shore before they all jetted into the forest. That was my closest encounter with black bear and lucky for me I was in the boat at that time. Outfitter  we were flown by Air Melancon and stayed in their cabins which were sold to new outfitter this year. We were the last costumers for the season.Service was top notch, amenities much better than I would expect to get in this secluded area. Camp keeper was pretty cool guy who worked hard to make sure that we had the best experience ever (thanks Gilles!). Boats were every reliable and we were able to rent a fish finder with GPS and detailed maps, which allowed us to visit many places in the area which we would not be able to otherwise. I would definitely recommend using them if You are considering Gouin and want to fly in (I think new outfitter is building road for car access, so that could be another option)."
1146423,NNYorker,2009-11-04 18:51:00,11,"Hello all - New to the board. I have fished the Gouin out of Tamarac Outfitters about 6 or 7 times and have always had very good success with the Walleyes. First couple of trips we took worms, but found that we could catch just as many jigging with a 3"" twister tail so we stopped hauling up live bait. We have always gone up around the end of June, early July but next year are thinking of going up in August to try and avoid the heat and bugs. We would be staying on Mattawa Bay. Was wondering if anyone knew how the fishing is in that area that time of year."
1133298,McQ,2009-09-02 05:18:00,615,"Our quickie trip last weekend was a mixture of elation and frustration. The winds howled for two days and low temps accompanied by rain made for some misery on the water, didn't get out on Saturday at all. The walleye bite was slow and tough but for whatever reason the Northerns were plentiful. Did manage enough walleye for dinner on Friday evening and the cooler carried some northern filets back home. The walleye were staged tight to the edges of mid lake shoals and you really had to work to stay on the spot which was a challenge all the time but the Northerns were hunting up on top and we kept busy sorting through the short fish and put two 40"" ers in the boat on Sunday. When we left Monday the skies improved and the forecast for the next 10 days is for very moderate conditions - warmth and sunshine: so will try to get back before the season closes on the 18th. Gulp 5"" alive leeches were the ticket on harnesses and thanks Chris - the tubs you left for me came in real handy - appreciate it."
1134508,Guest,2009-09-08 11:45:00,0,"This was a trip to remember for our gang. It was a measure of our patience and perseverance that we prevailed and had a great time in spite of the obstacles thrown our way. It all began at 4 AM at the Border Crossing. One of our group of 6 was turned back for a DWI infraction from 29 years ago. We had a hard eyed, young crossing guard who punched in each and every of our passports. He did his job, and our man was turned back. Rules are rules, and we are guests in Canada. None the less it is tough to think that a 55 year old man with a spotless record since that time (1980) posed a threat to society as a passenger in a vehicle. We had to take him back, sort through carefully loaded gear, say goodbye and head on up the road after a three hour delay. This also meant that one of us had to fish alone in a boat with no partner for the week...we took turns....keeping the one man boat close by one occupied by two. We drove through the remnants of tropical storm Bill, over some badly eroded gravel roads (the last 1 and 1/2 hours at top speed of 10 mph) to arrive at the base camp, where it was raining hard with a very stiff wind. Our french speaking outfitters were at a loss as I extended my hand and said who we were and that we were there to occupy their remote camp....their book keeping was suspect and they had no idea who we were at first. Luckily I had brought along a copy of our deposit and the letters back and forth between the lady and myself....after I went back to the vehicle to dig stuff out they eventually found their papers. As I said, the weather was bad with a high wind. The outfitters came through and gave us a camp near the office to spend the night in, and we headed up the lake for the 2 hour boat ride to the remote camp in the rain early the next morning. It would have been suicide to attempt that trip in the dark with high winds...it was a relief not to have to attempt it after a grueling 12 hour trip up there from home. The week was one of constant wind, mostly from the south or south west. The weather was variable, with rain at three separate times during the week...very un-settled which made the walleye fishing a challenge. We're old hands, so we put in our time and caught fish...as McQ said in his post, the fish were on structure in 25-30 feet of water. It was tough to hold your track while trolling or hold your anchor in the wind. But as anyone who has ever taken a week of vacation to fish learns....you take your chances when you book a week a year in advance. When all was said and done we caught walleye, and had enough to put together two great meals of fresh walleye washed down with ice cold Canadian brew. Biggest walleye was a 24""er. Many, many small 12 "" to 13"" walleye, which bodes well for future trips. The Gouin is a remote paradise. We put the fish guts out on a nearby island point and watched the eagles, ravens, hawks and seagulls wheel and deal for their share. The birds would clean up the site within an hour, it was amazing how fast they found their meal. We were visited one morning just at the break of day by a 150# Black Bear....who was looking through the screen window at one of the guys from a distance of about 4 feet away. The bear wandered around for a few minutes while we scrambled for cameras...had we been prepared we would have had a prize winning shot of him eyeballing the open door to the outhouse (where does a bear do...?). My buddies claimed he was there due to the deposit that I had left on the previous evening. Could be. I should mention that the Northern fishing was better than usual. Lots of Pike in the 20-30"" variety, the biggest anyone caught was 32"". We were not targeting the Nords though, maybe we should have spent some more time at that. Walleye was the name of the game. Through sadness at the turn-back of our buddy to a week of unspectacular walleye fishing....we all agree that none the less we will be back. And we'll make darn sure every member is good for the crossing next time!"
1128588,Guest,2009-08-13 15:59:00,0,"McQ, Thanks for the hints on walleye fishing, much appreciated. Can You share Your opinion about targeting larger pike at the end of August at Gouin? I know it can vary, but what is in Your opinion a better bet around that time, more of an open water or weedy bays ? I would imagine large ones could be following whitefish/fallfish schoals in deeper water but this is just my speculation."
1128592,kyle870,2009-08-13 16:31:00,26,"We have been fishing the gouin since 93 mostly in june once in august, the one common trend was fishing the windy shores. We troll harness's cover water, dont count out any spot till you drag a bait thru it. The gouin can be a cruel bugger, but believe me the trip can turn around right now! Just go at it like you just got there. I caught fish this year pulling gulp leeches and minnows on harness's Could be worse you could be me!"
1128638,slug72,2009-08-13 19:46:00,34,"Thanks again to everyone for their advice. Thanks Bill for your detailed information. I got it this afternoon. I am not sure if we will have time to do it. Despite the potential for the daytime bite, it is hot up here with bluebird skies. The sun really beats down and makes it real hot on the water for tired fishermen. I think we're going to take advantage of Rosie cooking us up some walleye for lunch tomorrow. That's right...I said cooking up some walleye. We had a real good night tonight as the owner's dad, George, took us out in his boat. Nemio is a place where they will work hard to make sure you are having a good time. We caught about 50 fish in 3 hours and George said the fishing is still slow. Huh? 50 walleye in 3 hours and that is slow fishing. Well, it was just what the doctor ordered for us as we had a great time. I am very appreciative of George taking us out and then even cleaning the fish for us. We caught them jigging live leaches. Gulp was also working but the live leaches seemed to get most of the fish tonight. Fish have generally been in 20' of water. We fished one of the islands near the mouth of the Nemio river. Nothing big tonight but all of the fish bent the rods and provided fun. We also caught a few pike today with the biggetst topping out at 30 inches on a white 6 inch swimbait. Tomorrow, we will probably start out fishing the same spot where we left off tonight. I will make a judgement call with the boys as to how hard we'll fish during the afternoon. Chris"
1128049,Guest,2009-08-11 13:03:00,0,"Thanks so much for the reports. My group arrives in 18 days....can't wait. I'd hate to think that you're up there with your boys and not slaying the walleyes...it sounds like you're struggling a bit to boat some fish. A couple of quick thoughts, for what it's worth, being that you're not a seasoned walleye guy by your own admission. Are you fishing deep enough? By that I mean is your rig bouncing on the bottom with occasional snags on the bottom? Most often that's where the action is, right on the bottom and I'd guess at this time of year in 15 to 20 feet of water. Try fishing around rocky points, or sunken islands, always a good place to start...they usually extend out under the water. Do this with just a hook and sinker with a crawler on the hook. Leeches if you've got 'em. If you're getting any wind, fish the shore where the waves are breaking....we did phenomenally well one time casting crankbaits to the shore and doing a slow retrieve to the boat, much the same as fishing for bass. I'm sure you'll enjoy the trip and the memories regardless of the number of fish...but I know it is great to have it all (lotsa fish too!) Hope this helps. Good fishing to ya."
1128085,Guest,2009-08-11 15:37:00,0,"Slug, Reports much appreciated ! I am counting days to my trip starting Aug 29. It will be my first time on Gouin, so I cannot offer any advice., but will report what I manage to learn when I get back. Good luck during the rest of Your trip."
1128086,Larry Mac,2009-08-11 15:44:00,530,"Hi Chris, We have never fished the Gouin Reservoir so I cannot give you advice on specific spots. We are walleye fisherman and fished Northwest Ontario last week with the kids and I must say we really had to work (i.e. locate) the walleyes. Buzzard1 gave you some very good advice. If you are jigging you must be able to feel the bottom. This will increase your chances. Have the lodge mark a bunch of locations and set up a plan to work them logically (Time management). If you are not catching fish, move to the next spot. On water as big as you are describing maybe you would want to hire a guide for the day, the shore lunch experience alone is worth it. I am also a believer in pink jigs and a piece of meat especially if the water is stained.I like to keep it simple.Like Buzzard1 was saying you are creating memories and having a great time no matter how many fish you catch. I take my kids twice a year every year and they cannot wait until the next trip. Last week we also faced, like many on this board experienced all year, challenging weather. We still had a great time as I know you and yours will. I am sure you will find your ""honey hole"" with persistence and advice from the people in camp. Please do not put to much pressure on yourself and enjoy the moment. Have a great trip and keep the reports flowing.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1128155,slug72,2009-08-11 19:48:00,34,"Thanks everyone for the replies and advice. Bill, thanks for your email. All of it is appreciated. Today was another tough day. We managed about 10 walleye total but size was lacking. Also, 5 of them came from tossing jigs from the dock. My son caught what the owner called a lush. I had never heard of it but it was pretty cool to catch something we never caught before. We decided to go to their back pike lake after dinner. A couple of hits but you could see fish on the sonar suspended in 30 feet of water. They stayed there the entire night and appeared to be in a very neutral position. We had 2 strikes trolling and never hooked up. My son was trolling a 6 inch swimbait at one point and missed a fish. The plastic swimbait's tail was bitten up and the body was gouged with teeth marks. I am not sure how the pike missed the hook. Oh well. We had some fun. The only consolation for us is that it doesn't seem that we are the only one's struggling. The owner and a frequent guest went out for several hours today. They went to one of the owner's ""honey holes"" and had to work hard to get 6 walleye. They were nicer than the ones we managed but they certainly didn't catch a lot. The owner and his wife also took out another group in camp out tonight. They managed about a dozen fish and missed a bunch more from a soft bite. By everyone's account, these aren't typical Gouin numbers. Tomorrow's another day and we'll give it another shot. We are going to try a new spot Bill McCue emailed me. I'll let you know. Chris"
