1146895,hangneyes,2009-11-07 10:10:00,25,"did you get your fish down by the number 2 rock, we fished alot between that and eagles nest, but didn't go past number 2. we got a couple of 13lbers right north of the bridge and a couple others on the south side of the bridge, up by the tower."
1146904,Johnnie Candle,2009-11-07 12:37:00,1037,"You got it. We trolled from #2 to #3. Did a little bit at Eagles Nest. Never tried teh bridge, need to do that next year."
1144503,uzzi,2009-10-26 13:28:00,349,"Well, was out all day yesterday again. Few other boats too. Looked like most were having similar luck, few small ones (2lbs). Nothing big for us, nothing big for anyone else we talked to. Pulled cranks for a three hours as well, from dusk into dark, and not a single thing. Unfortunately it might have been my last trip. We used minnows, leeches and cranks. All fish came on lindy/leeches. However did have a couple bites on minnow/jig but no fish to show for it Water surface temp was 42. Air temps still to be plus side of freezing till Sunday it looks like. Certainly not the most stellar fall at Nipawin for fishing! Who knows, maybe the best is still to come in early Nov if it doesn't freeze up."
1145147,Johnnie Candle,2009-10-29 15:08:00,1037,"Now it is my turn to repay. Got home late last night, fished Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. It was a fun trip, as Nipawin always is. Sunday, 20 fish, Monday 15, Tuesday 14. We lost two monsters Tuesday night, but that is fishing. All fish were caught on cranks. #11 Deep Tail Dancers, Reef Runners and Deep Thundersticks seemed to be the best baits. On Sunday there was much less current than on Monday and Tuesday. Speed Sunday was 1.6 to 1.8 GPS. Monday and Tuesday best speed was 1.1 to 1.3. The bite was best from 5 o'clock till about 9. Never fished past 11 cause we needed to get in to town before Wild Bill quit delivering pizza. LOL!!! All the big fish came after dark. We caught most of our fish from the Eagles Nest toward the lake, very little came above the Eagles Nest. Never caught a fish at the White Rock, which is a first for me in 4 trips now. Colors were all over the place. From Lights Out to Blue Berry Muffin to Fire Tiger, they all worked. Even tried a few custom colors on lures that normally don't come that way and had luck with them too. Biggest fish of the trip was 12.2 with only 4 over ten pounds. A bunch in the 6 to 8 pound range and the small ones were all around 3 pounds. It was an average trip for the fishing, but we had a blast at the Kingfisher Inn Saturday night. Met a few locals and made some new friends. I swear, I could fish there everyday and never get tired of it. Great place. Hope to see you next year."
1145153,Riceburner,2009-10-29 15:24:00,436,"Curious of your preferences, if you care to comment --Do you pull cranks with Fireline or other no-stretch line, always pull against the current, work the channel edge or flats? Nipawin fishing is always a rush, no doubt. THX."
1145199,uzzi,2009-10-29 18:41:00,349,"Sounds like you had decent luck Johnnie. Our Sunday was very slow, and you're right about the current Sunday, it was pretty quiet. I was down to about 1.9 mph with the big motor trolling, guess I shuld have put my socks out and gone slower. This was a weird year for us with cranks, not a single walleye on a crank the last 3 outings. Oh well, guess thats fishing for ya. Luckily I'm only an hour away, pretty luck to have that water body so close"
1145204,Johnnie Candle,2009-10-29 18:54:00,1037,"We pulled two FireLines at 50 to 55 feet back and then a mono rod with 85 to 90 feet out. The Deep Tail Dancers and Reef Runners run about the same depth so the lure choice didn't matter much. The Thundersticks take a little more line. The fish came on both types of line. I will say this, those big fish on FireLine are a rush. We worked the inside of the turns and try to stay on the edge. 19 to 22 feet was best for us. We trolled both up and down stream when the current was nill, only upstream when the current picked up. Caught fish going both directions. I sure wish it was closer, I would go two or three times if it was."
1145663,tillerdude,2009-11-01 08:00:00,46,"Went out on the river Saturday Oct 11th and had a fairly good day. We caught over 40 walleyes most of them being around 3 to 6 pounds. We did manage to get a couple bigger girls also. Our largest being 13.4 pounds and another one just under 13. We also caught a few that were around 9 to 10 pounds. It was pretty cold with the temp in the minus, wind was blowing pretty good and snowing straight sideways. All and all it was definetly worth going out for the day."
1145996,Pikeman(SK),2009-11-02 23:20:00,6,"Hey Johnnie! Pro fisherman don't lose fish, especially not the elvis of walleye fishing, must have been one of those **** locals you took out! Seriously though, thanks a lot for taking me out, had a great time, hopefully we'll see you at the king fisher again next year! -Travis"
1146099,Johnnie Candle,2009-11-03 12:31:00,1037,"Travis, It was a blast. Good to meet you too. Hoping to get back next year as well. If I do, we will hook up for sure. Have a great ice fishing season."
1146748,hangneyes,2009-11-06 08:58:00,25,"Johnny, were you pulling the 900 series reefs? We were up there the same time as you and pretty much struggled for a week. We caught some fish, but not many, and very few at night. We fished every evening until the earliest 10pm, usually we do really well, but for some reason it was a tough bite for us."
1146839,Johnnie Candle,2009-11-06 19:06:00,1037,"No, just the larger size deep diver. I am not sure the number. The #11 Deep Tail Dancers did well for us also. We caught very few fish during the day. It seemed things got good when the sun hit the tree tops every night."
1142433,tillerdude,2009-10-15 19:06:00,46,Was out last weekend and did pretty good. We caught over 30 on saturday that were between 3 to 11 pounds.
1142434,Guest,2009-10-15 19:10:00,0,"Thanks for the reply Tillerdude, can I ask if you were live baiting or cranks? We plan on cranking most of the time were going to be up there, anyone know where Leaches are available late in the year? Twin Marine closes on the 18th."
1142453,Johnnie Candle,2009-10-15 22:14:00,1037,"Thanks for all the replies. I have a few friends there now and it sounds like the bite is getting a little better. Still slower than the norm, but picking up. It is always fun there. Besides, it only takes one bite in that river to make it the trip of a lifetime."
1142541,uzzi,2009-10-16 11:02:00,349,"I'll be going Sunday. Yes, Twin Marine is closing Saturday, said they might be open Sunday, but not open for lunch We will be using Lindy/leeches, jig/minnow and cranks. I'll report back on how we make out."
1142983,hangneyes,2009-10-19 08:10:00,25,"any new reports, we are heading up later this week, any info would be appreciated."
1142995,uzzi,2009-10-19 08:54:00,349,"Was out all day yesterday. Quite a few boats out, was decent day once it stopped raining. Action was slow for us, and the bite is very light/tentative. Largest of the day for us was a 8lb3oz football. Lost several on the hookset.....so be patient! BS'd with a few guys out there, all having about the same luck. Saw lots of guys catching, but no monsters, at least none we saw. We missed seeing a 13-3 the day before, think it was BARDFROMEDSON above that caught it. Last 2 trip have had 0 success with cranks, all fish coming on lindy/leeches or jig/minnow. Current isn't very quick either. Surface temp is 47 and dropping. Will be back out there next Sunday unless its snowing! Good luck everyone. I have a feeling its picking up a bit finally!"
1143125,Johnnie Candle,2009-10-19 19:55:00,1037,"Is there anywhere up there to get bait this time of year? In my experience, salted minnows are pretty easy to come by, but not leeches. I don't mind stoppin gon my way up there if there is a place worth checking. Thanks."
1143194,oldblue2008,2009-10-20 08:04:00,313,"you can try Great Northern Rod and Reel in Regina , 1755 Park Street, or phone 306-359-7378. I also bought leeches 2 weeks ago in Weyburn at the co-op sporting store , Outdoor Adventures, 306-8483687, and Edwin is your man there. If you are looking for quantity, like several dozen, don't get your hopes up at this time of year. Happy fishing, gonna try Rafferty today with my leeches. oldblue2008"
1143220,bardfromedson,2009-10-20 09:21:00,7,i would try and find some minnows as well before you come up. the town is sold out of all kinds of bait. saw a few people jigging minnows and catching. i caught my 13 pounder on a lindy with leech. long leaders and small weight. we did get an 8 pounder the first night cranking in the dark right next to the eagles nest sign. cranking was hard because there was a ton of floating weeds in the water in a lot of areas.
1144324,Guest,2009-10-25 18:48:00,0,Any new reports from this weekend? Were heading up on Wednesday
1141839,Johnnie Candle,2009-10-13 08:12:00,1037,"I am heading to Nipawin in a few weeks. Just checking to see what is happening up there. I have heard that it is pretty tough right now, but maybe it is still a little early for the big girls to show up. Any reports are good reports. Thanks."
1141879,hangneyes,2009-10-13 10:52:00,25,"i am also going up, we will be there the 24th through the 31, looking forward to some reports"
1141897,uzzi,2009-10-13 11:57:00,349,"Bring your ice auger! Haha, been a cold week or more, with highs each day just at freezing. Supposed to see some better weather this weekend, with highs around 10-12C. Bite was very tough last week. I was out on Monday, another buddy out on Thursday. No trophies for either of us, biggest fish were at the small end of the slot. And the bites were few and far between. Surface temp was 58, so I'm thinking with the week of cold, it will have dropped greatly below that. There was lots of boats out, talked to some guys that boated a 29"", but that was the best report I'd heard."
1141908,Guest,2009-10-13 12:39:00,0,"Were heading up there on the 28th - 1st, hopefully that water cools down some more by then and the bite takes off."
1141934,bardfromedson,2009-10-13 15:35:00,7,im heading there for the 16-19th. 17ft sylvan. stop by and say hi. we can share tips and bs
1142008,Guest,2009-10-13 21:41:00,0,The fishing has been terrible and the water is cold but there is no flow. I will be there this weekend hope it picks up.
1142131,WARRIOR,2009-10-14 14:16:00,195,Fished last week with 29 the biggest and 6 @ 27-28. Fishing got worse as week went on. No water flow with tons of weeds floating waiting to run down the line.
1142155,Guest,2009-10-14 16:12:00,0,"Ive seen a couple people mention the low water flows, is it because of low water up dam/river or is it no need for electricity? Last year was awsome, if we catch half as many fish this year it'll still be a good trip!"
1142176,Riceburner,2009-10-14 18:00:00,436,"We were there the week after the CUP---had several nice walleyes in the 27-29 inch range on leeches, and finally one that went 30""+ and 12# on a crankbait. Water temps dropped from 58 to 53 degrees --with the blowing snow and sub 30 degree nights, it's bound to be lower now.....Looks like this weekend should be warmer on the hands--wish I was closer. If you get a calm day, the big lake has some feisty northerns available too. Please release the fish gently--doesn't it bother you too when someone just tosses her back in like a stick of firewood....?"
1142229,Guest,2009-10-14 21:01:00,0,"was up at the tourney,the big girls are there ! just have to work for them,leeches rigs work well but by experence jigs and minnows should take off soon if not already,cranks too"
