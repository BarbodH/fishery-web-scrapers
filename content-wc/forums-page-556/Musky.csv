1145162,Gibson,2009-10-29 15:57:00,17,Going to book a trip for Musky next Spring/Summer in the Lake of the Woods or Minaki area. When would the best time be for Musky in this region?

Besides, the season doesn't open until later (don't target them myself so don't know for sure).But I do know that the muskies on LOTW start to turn on when water temps reach 70 degrees, which is after the season opens. So, in other words, think after July 1 through the rest of the season into fall.You might want to check out www.witchbay.com especially the fishing reports section.Have fun and good luck."

Last week he caught a 46"" and 54"" right down the shorline from our camp on LOTW. He likes the fall best sept and oct."

This past summer the weather was such that we didn't see 70 degree water until September. The fall fishing was great this year for both numbers and size. Weather is a big determining factor on muskie fishing. If you enjoy crystal clear Lake Trout waters, then the opening week for muskies on lakes like Crow (Kakagi) can provide lots of action. Make a list of all the factors important to you for muskie fishing and then give me a shout. I live on LOTW in Nestor Falls from mid May to mid September. I'll help you any way I can. Good Luck!!!"

There is no question on where one should stay either. Steve Herbeck and Andy's Meyer's Lodge, (AML). I've been traveling to Canada, every year (but 2) for the last 29 years and have stayed at several different locations. Nothing compares to AML if your soul purpose is to catch fish. Steve and his crew go out of their way, they hold training classes during the week and individual attention if you are still having difficulty. Here's what I have experienced during a week long stay for the last few years: * Follow's from several fish 50""+ * Boated at least one 50"" * Follow's from at least one GIANT, 54""+ * Boated at least 1 fish every other day (sometimes 4/day) from fish 45""+.(Weekly averages of course)"
