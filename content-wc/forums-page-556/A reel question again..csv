Go easy on me, as I am old (70) and delicate. What I am trying to find out is if anyone has used the RSC ""Rapala"" Line Counter Reels?I have the oppurtunity to buy a couple of New Rapala Line Counter Reels Model # RSC30LC at a very attractive price. These reels as I understand it were made and sold in Canada. The problem I am having is that I can't find any information on them except the following.http://www.rapala.ca/products/rapala/linecounter.phpThey appear to be a decent reel but I would like to hear something from those who have first hand knowledge of them. Thanks"

I think I would take the deafening silence as a ringing non-endorcement. To me they look very heavy, more off shore type tackle, than any reels you would find in any of the boats fishing the lakes we do, other than the Great Lakes."

At least then you'll know you're buying a proven reel. The Rapala may be good, but with no reviews why take a chance (unless the price is REALLY good)."
