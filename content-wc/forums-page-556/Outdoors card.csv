1138574,kliph,2009-09-26 21:32:00,2337,I don't know why we need an outdoor card but still need to buy a fishing tag every year. Maybe I'm missing something. Can someone explain? Thanks.

1137909,1shooter,2009-09-23 18:16:00,1493,Wife and I purchased our 2nd week in June. She received hers 3 weeks ago and mine arrived today.
1137996,WalleyeWally28,2009-09-24 07:16:00,298,"I posted yesterday that my wife and I received our cards. Got to looking closely at them last night and found mistakes. Both our eye colors were wrong, my height was listed at 154 centimeters (5') when I'm actually 6'1"" and my wife's gender was listed as male. Called the 800 number this morning and was told that these corrections are important and they will re-issue cards in about 20 days. Call took a total of about 5 minutes of talking to a very pleasant and accommodating lady. I suggest everyone take a close look at all the info on their cards to make sure it is accurate."
1138009,elway12,2009-09-24 07:49:00,335,I too just got my cards(from a mid-July fishing trip) in the mail and it is wrong both weight and eye color. Guess I will have to call...
1138042,WalleyeWally28,2009-09-24 09:08:00,298,That's height in centimeters that is on the card - not weight. I don't see weight at all. I caught the mistake because they showed my wife at 160 cm and me at 154 - found a conversion table and figured out I was only 5' tall.
1138087,Glenman12,2009-09-24 11:27:00,762,Im glad I kept reading this thread..I thought the 180 on my card was weight..but the conversion is accurate for my height..I wish I my weight was only 180
1135943,JDP,2009-09-14 22:14:00,1457,"I ordered my license over the phone March 30th, received the license and temporary paper Outdoors Cardabout April 14th. Got the Outdoors Card today... However, I noticed that the card expires December 31, 2010....only a 2 year period. I thought it was to be 3 years. I think I'll call the 1-800 number unless someone on WC can explain . Thanks, JDP"
1135954,Glenman12,2009-09-15 04:51:00,762,So the last two numbers in what looks like a credit card number are 10 and not 11?..if thats the case I would call them
1135961,rebs,2009-09-15 05:49:00,7587,ours also expire in 2010what gives with that ? only 2 years and not 3
1135962,Ia Walihntr,2009-09-15 05:51:00,320,"Bought mine May 16th---received it yesterday, Sept. 14th. Mine expires 2011."
1136000,JDP,2009-09-15 08:10:00,1457,"The last two numbers are ""10"". I called the Outdoors Card Centre (1-800-387-7011). Apparently there were cards incorrectly printed with only two years of life. There were supposed to be pulled and replaced before being sent to recipients. I will be receiving a new card in 20 days with an expiration date of 12/31/2011. The call took less than 3 minutes. JDP"
1136005,rebs,2009-09-15 08:38:00,7587,just called and will recieve news cards in 3 weeks also
1136006,deputy dog,2009-09-15 08:39:00,305,"so you DO NOT need one prior to arriving in ontario for a trip, correct? planning a possible trip with mattice lake outfitters next summer and want to be legal."
1136010,JDP,2009-09-15 08:54:00,1457,Correct! The way I understand it: The OC will allow the purchase of the 2010 fishing license over the internet or at the very least over the phone in 2010. I believe you will still be able to purchase the fishing license at a retailer and get a temp OC (paper) when you purchase a fishing license in Canada as you always have. You do not need to do anything before you leave. JDP
1136118,Opti-Mist,2009-09-15 15:33:00,1402,"Mine came yesterday, the 14th. Expires 12/31/11."
1136120,2746,2009-09-15 15:45:00,3206,"Bought ours May 10 and it also shows 2011. Do you suppose if it was purchased prior to the season starting that it's considered 2008, 9 and 10? Doesn't make sense does it?"
1134727,WalleyeWally28,2009-09-09 07:54:00,298,Bought ours July 4th and haven't received them yet.

Was told they no longer accept credit cards. Needless to say, ran short at the card table once we got to camp however, we did get our outdoors card the day we got the licenses. wonder why with so many out there still without theirs........???"

See https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...t=outdoor+card.It's a great idea, especially for the camp owners and bait shops that sell licenses.

The permanent (3 yr) plastic cards are supposed to be mailed out before the end of the year. You should call the MNR at 1-800-667-1940 and see why theres a hold up on your temp."

1126805,Lovetofish,2009-08-06 09:51:00,458,How long is it taking to get the outdoors card in the mail?? I was up July 10th.
1126814,WalleyeWally28,2009-08-06 10:20:00,298,"A previous thread said, if you bought it along with your license after arriving in Canada, it would be mailed out in the fall. I was there from July 4th-11th and haven't received mine either."

1126851,Guest,2009-08-06 12:10:00,0,what is an outdoors card?
1126912,2746,2009-08-06 16:28:00,3206,Was there the second week of the season (late May) and no card yet. Just hang on to the receipt they gave you. Govt. there works about as fast as ours does.
1126923,hogridnfool,2009-08-06 17:04:00,349,Its part of Ontarios (don't know aboot the other provinces) modernization of their licensing system. You will need it in order to get a hunting or fishing license. The cost is $9 and it is good for 3 years. You can get one by calling 1-800-667-1940 and charge it to your credit card or you can get it where you buy your license in Ontario. This will be a temporary paper form. The plastic cards should be issued by years end.
1126932,bluedog,2009-08-06 17:36:00,14,got my lic in janwere up ice fishing !still no outdoor card blue
1126962,rebs,2009-08-06 19:36:00,7587,I bought my license in January and paid for the card and still no card
1126981,Guest,2009-08-06 20:57:00,0,It sound like a new way to squeeze another $9.00 out every angler. w/o raising license fees.
1127003,Catman59,2009-08-07 04:50:00,345,............ it's EVERY angler. The Canadians are complaining about them too.
