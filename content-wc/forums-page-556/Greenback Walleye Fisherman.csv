1148451,avidangler,2009-11-16 22:47:00,3,The fishing at Pine Falls has been good the last few trips.Out in the bay has been the best with as many as approx 50 per day between 2 of us.. No real hogs but good numbers of fish from 22 inches..to 26.The weather looks like it will be at least another good week of fishing with no terribly cold temps forecast.Heading out tommorrow actually Hope I can sleep tonite lol

Not going to get more chances like this, they are forecasting great weather this weekend. Go to environment canada for details. Also I am working on an new web site for Clarks. If you have some good pics from the weekend or the past fall email to me at [email protected]. Thanks, hope to see you all out there."

1148065,manitobawalleye,2009-11-14 13:29:00,885,pinefalls yes.... the red no.... weather forecast is good for next week
1148068,LeeMB,2009-11-14 14:46:00,83,Manitobawalleye is right. The Red is dead..........fish Pine falls!
1148069,mrwalleye5,2009-11-14 14:49:00,1922,"i second manitobawalleye, although I'm not a Red fisherman, but give me Pine Falls. Lots of 22 inchers (5lb). But ya just never know. W5"
1148157,Backwater Eddy,2009-11-15 08:27:00,3871,"Did the higher dirty water hit the Red, is that what turned it off Manitobawalleye?FYI: Fell fast now, cleared up quickly too here in the Central Red River Basin. Velocity is still up there but slowing some. Walleye bite here is strong and larger fish are being caught..and lots of pesky snaugers too."
1148199,Bandit,2009-11-15 16:12:00,140,Yes & Pinefall was hot Thursday/Friday? Slow down a little with less wind on Saturday/Sunday?
1148262,manitobawalleye,2009-11-16 04:28:00,885,Hi Ed I do not think you can say either place had a banner year. Seems to me to be more of a baitfish issue.
