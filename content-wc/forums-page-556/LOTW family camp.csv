1144820,Guest,2009-10-27 21:54:00,0,"Does anyone know of a good family camp on LOTW? We are looking for a camp that would cater to families that has some other thing to do other than just fish. A nice clean sandy beach would be a must and maybe a decent sized town within 30-40 minutes. Flush toilets too. I want to give the kids (5,8,10) a semi-remote canadian experience with an outlet for other things to do. I would consider other good fishing lakes in the area as well, maybe Rainy Lake. The kids need to be able to catch fish to keep them interested. Thoughts?"

Kenora is only 40 minutes away with all kinds of things to do there. If you are adventerous and have good weather, you could travel to Kenora by boat and take in more of the LOTW."

Super clean and organized. Mini golf, golf, restaurants, grocery and tackle a couple of miles away in town, just 40 mins to Kenora which has everything. Dock facility is second to none, staff is super friendly and helpful. Fishing is great, it's LOTW! Good luck with your trip! Jerryhttp://www.tomahawkresort.com"
