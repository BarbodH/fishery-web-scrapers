1144560,phishfearme,2009-10-26 18:40:00,1242,a neat factoid (at least i think it's a fact) about the great white north: Canada has more lakes than the rest of the world combined. Canada is an Indian word meaning ' Big Village .' phish
1144573,Moondog,2009-10-26 19:20:00,362,I like to FISH Canada more than any other nation and earth!!!
1144605,fishforlife,2009-10-27 00:54:00,77,"Phish, You've got to be kidding. You know Pittsburgh has more than Canada,( If you count the ""POTHOLES"" )Very interesting, did not know that. Can't wait to get back up there. Hope all is well in Steeler Country. Take Care.Rob"
1144918,phishfearme,2009-10-28 10:23:00,1242,rob - i think they were referring to lakes with fish in them. pittsburgh potholes are only stocked with volkwagens. phish
1145627,fishforlife,2009-10-31 22:29:00,77,"Phish, You are correct. I worked at VW in the assembly plant for 6-years and we made 6,000 of them a week. Had to be going somewhere. Go Steelers !!!Take Care,Rob"
1145673,fishncamp,2009-11-01 08:34:00,49,"we have our share of potholes too.....ours are full of Tahoes and Expeditions Over 100,000 lakes in Manitoba alone!"
1145973,pegasis0066,2009-11-02 19:45:00,64,"I think Ontario has more lakes than all of the US. A Canadian friend of mine joked that Minnesota is 'The Land of 100,000 Lakes"", but Ontario has at least 400,000 lakes."
1146493,Bigfishhunter,2009-11-05 06:50:00,803,"I believe minnesota is the land of 10,000 lakes, not 100,000. In fact Minnesota has 11,800 and some lakes that are over 10 acres in size. Sorry, but 100,000 just did not make sense in my mind."
