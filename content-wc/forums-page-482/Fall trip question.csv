1321065,Nimstug,2011-06-21 18:02:00,2605,Something we've done to spend a bit more time on the water with less daylight is to have 'dinner' around 2:00 then stay out until dark. Sandwiches 8:30 - 9:00.
1321264,LOW1,2011-06-22 08:00:00,2828,"Mid September is an ideal time to be in the Lake of the Woods area. Great sleeping weather. Few people or bugs. The maple trees really are the color on the Canadian flag. Early mornings and late afternoons can be cold, but I am a firm believer in fishing only during banking hours so that doesn't bother me. And the water stays surprisingly warm-my kids have swam off our dock in late September. October, however, can be difficult."

1320411,tilldawg,2011-06-20 10:07:00,55,"I am thinking about doing a fall trip to NW Ontario this year. My question is, what is the weather and fishing like in late August to mid- Sept. up there? I have never been up there in the fall.Thanks"
1320432,camp chef,2011-06-20 10:32:00,915,Mid September can be 80 degrees in the morning and stormy and 40 by the afternoon.We have had some of our roughest weather (and best fishing) the third week in Sept. You really have to pack for all possibilities.
1320476,Golden Eagle,2011-06-20 11:30:00,2642,The first week in October has been really good to me. Have missed only a few in the past 20 years.
1320483,NARDA 1,2011-06-20 11:44:00,636,"We have been going to Eagle lake the 2nd week of September for the last several years and have found the weather to be fairly nice during the day 60 -70 but can get cool at night, we actually had snow flurries on early morning. Have found the fishing to be quite good and less people on the lake and that is why we contiue to go at that time."
1320564,REG,2011-06-20 14:21:00,445,The leaves should be changing colors around the 2nd week of Sept. Fishing should be good for walleyes and northerns. And the best part - no (or very few) bugs by that time of year!
1320638,Golden Eagle,2011-06-20 17:49:00,2642,"I usually go in when there's an empty seat on the airplane and several times I've stuck around for Thanksgiving dinner with the campowner's family and moose hunters. I leave when there's an empty seat on the floatplane.I've also gone in a week after the moose opener. Got pinned down by a heavy snow. Didn't catch fish for two days, but put my fillet knife to a hind quarter of moose hanging in the fish cleaning house. The experience is great. Just like the people I stay with."
1320723,Bill Krejca,2011-06-20 21:24:00,6107,"Yeah, all of the above. Mid-September is my favorite time to be up there. I really enjoy the usually cool nights, the coloring of the trees, overhead bird migrations and just the changing of the seasons. Oh, yeah, the fishing is pretty good, too. Bill Krejca"
1320731,Nimstug,2011-06-20 22:08:00,2605,"Go.I fish in the morning in 4 layers and by 1:00 down to the short sleeve shirt. About 5:00 the layer go back on one by one. Great time to be there, but when is a bad time?"
1320749,MorganMan,2011-06-20 23:18:00,341,"We too are doing a trip this year at the end of Sept. We have been doing fly ins for 18 years, but usually the end of Aug or first 10 days of Sept. Little worried about what the weather might bring going that late, but have heard fishing is usually good. Headed to Lac Seul for the first time and looking forward to it."
1320979,mr-fish,2011-06-21 14:51:00,58,"Not sure when you go up or how much you are on the water in a normal day.The thing that i found the hardest to adjust to was the shorter daylight hours, from our normal june trip. I believe it worked out to around 2 hours a day. Just seemed like we lost a day of fishing somewhere during the week."
