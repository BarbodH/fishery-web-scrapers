Notre Dame Cathedral is amazing. Montrealers love there smoked meat sandwiches a steamed lean ruben sandwich is the best. Check out restaurants ""Rubens"" 2 locations on St Catherine & Schwartz's for smoked meat. Great, clean, friendly city with jazz festival in July. Check out Bell Centre event schedule. Enjoy."

Walk St. Denis street and St. Laurent for tons of original stores and restaurants - and, if you can, venture up north to St. Sauveur and Mont Tremblant. The ride up is gorgeous and the towns are simply beautiful (although the first is getting a bit laden with factor outlets).L'Avenue restaurant on Mont-Royal (somewhere between St-Denis and Boyer) is nice for breakfast even if there is always a line-up. I haven't been in a while but the menu was creative and the ambiance always interesting. If you want more casual there's a Cora restaurant nearby with little or no line-up. There are a lot of small places for coffees and croissant nearby too.if you walk along St-Laurent Blvd, you will cross Prince Arthur which also has a choice of restaurants (mostly B.Y.O.B.). Continue walking on Prince Arthur, cross the parc and you will reach St-Denis. If you like smoked meat, be sure to find Schwartz's on St-Laurent as the other member already suggested - don't forget the cherry coke!i could go on forever..but one last thing...poutine! order a poutine (poo-tin) before you leave. you'll be making them when you get back home..i assure you!have a great time, in the most beautiful city in Canada!"
