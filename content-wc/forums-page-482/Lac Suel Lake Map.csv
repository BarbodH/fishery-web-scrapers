1320580,JDP,2011-06-20 15:15:00,1457,"Lakemaster does not have a map at all.Navionics has a map on their Canada (North) chips.Link: http://www.navionics.com/LakeFeatures_HMPlatinum.aspthere are various other printed/paper maps but for the most partthey have similar information.Lac Seul, I believe, has not been surveyed in the mannerthat lake of the Woods, rainy lake, etc. have been."

Just they do not show in great detal underwater rocks, points, ect. Be carefull and watch your depth it can change fast. Have a great trip. You are going to walleye heaven.Rodney Bondele"
1321170,rnnonmt,2011-06-21 22:42:00,992,I have the navionics hotmap for my humminbird and trakmaps on my Garmin handheld gps. Both are the same quality IMO. Don't buy the premium version of navionics as Lac Seul was not surveyed in hi def. Navionics was $99. Trakmaps was $79 and I believe it's only compatible with Garmin. Hope this helps.
