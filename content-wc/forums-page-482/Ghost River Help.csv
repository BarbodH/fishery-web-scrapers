Reagrding to walleye fishing tactics would you concider it mostly a Jig bite? Have you ever bottom bounce with spinner rigs or used ""Roach Rigs""? I see on Midwest Outdoor videos they use live minnows. Has anyone has sucess with Leeches, Crawlers or Salted Minnows? How about Gulp as opposed to live bait? With all the portgaes available are there any must do portage lakes? Any other helpful hints would be appreciated. Thanks,"
1320898,mroyle,2011-06-21 11:31:00,74,Used jig & twister tail almost exclusively. Trolled with a HotnTot every now & then to locate fish then jigged. We used crawlers and minnows and sometimes just a jig & twister tail. Crawlers worked as well as minnows. We fished clamshell a lot & caught lots of walleyes there- just as you enter clamshell we slow trolled all thru the area with jig/twister. Also fished Stanzhikimi with success. We also fished the twin falls area a lot & the area around the railroad bridge.

I have also used Gulp and Gulp Alive with mixed success, seems ncurrent improves the bite with plastics. Bottom bouncers and cranks will work where don't they and will allow you to cover more water quicker. Clamshell is fun and you should try Singapore it can be fantastic. Darrel will point you in the right direction and Don and Sturgeon River camp is really good and will show areas and spots to fish. Tell then hello from Bill in South Dakota they run a top notch camp, you will want for nothing if you ask for it.wmd"
