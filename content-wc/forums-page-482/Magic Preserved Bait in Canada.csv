1319830,GMANNN,2011-06-18 18:52:00,8,Has anyone tried the Magic preserved shiners or leeches on a fly in trip? We have run out of bait in the past and gulp did not attract a hot bite so I was thinking of picking up a bag of shiners and leeches. Any input would be greatly appreciated.

Although non-Canadian residents are not allowed to trap baitfish, based on the regulations summary, it looks like you can trap leeches. Probably should double check on that though.From the Fishing Regulations Summary:Only one leech trap no more than 45 cm (17.7 in.) in any dimension can be used day or night to capture leeches. Leech traps must be clearly marked with the licence holder's name."
