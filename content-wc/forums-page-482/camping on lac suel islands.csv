1320666,sammy2964,2011-06-20 19:01:00,17,I was wondering if you can legally camp (overnight - 5 days) on any islands on lac suel??
1320675,tly,2011-06-20 19:27:00,1900,"Up until about mid/late 80's you could camp about anywhere. We loved Taylor's island and Kekabeca area Next you had to buy a 'ticket' from a roll much like theater tickets, one for each person, each night. Tickets were available at most sport shops. In the eastern sector this was rigidly enforced by a huge MNR agent with an equally huge sheperd who has a tan Glastron and was everywhere!! Now in the 90's a new concept came into being. ""outfitters"" had specified camp site which you rented. It was the responsibility of the outfitter to keep the sites clean. It limited the number of places you could go but I believe the experience was better. Several happy years @ Ojibwa #7 Now the outfitters have ""remote"" sites, which are cabins, not camp sites I would check with MNR but I doubt camping is allowed."
1320681,jswinter40,2011-06-20 19:38:00,127,if you are not Canadian you cannot camp on Lac Seul. Clearly stated at all public accesses I have been to.
1320759,Skywagon,2011-06-21 04:30:00,1106,Correct answer.
1320846,falkopat,2011-06-21 09:03:00,44,"we looked into this 3 years back, there is a legal way to do it but almost impossible to do tactically. you have to be 500 ft from the water and you cannot leave your boat in the water, it must also be 500ft from the shore. so if you want to camp in the middle of the woods and can drag your boat in 500 ft every night you could try. that is what we found out from mnr office in sioux lookout. The 500 ft may be 500 meters dont remember. pat"
1320853,MikeMcC,2011-06-21 09:31:00,72,Would sleeping on your boat be considered camping? Perhaps use the complete top-set/bimini top to keep the bugs out. Remove the seats and inflate an air mattress. Screened tent on shore to eat and relax in prior to sleeping in boat?
1320936,falkopat,2011-06-21 13:13:00,44,"after 20+ years up there. no way am i sleeping outside, i have seen and felt some of the storms that come through there. Its bad enough when the houseboat starts a rocking with the real bad storms. can not image 18ft boat. also not sure on the legality of that. pat"
