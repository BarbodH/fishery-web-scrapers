1320999,tly,2011-06-21 15:28:00,1900,"This is about a successful family outing that they are proud of. Not an issue of $$$ vs $$$ float or cabin, only the initial concern of not being on a familiar houseboat. It is rewarding to see such trips come off, 3 generations bonding and creating memories. There are few too many of those any more."
1321003,jswinter40,2011-06-21 15:32:00,127,"sorry, just trying to answer a question.. no doubt the best thing is the experience no matter the cost. sorry again."
1321018,tly,2011-06-21 16:05:00,1900,"The conversation evolved, that's all. With 20/20 hindsight this subject should make a very interesting thread. Many of us have gone both routes, lots of good stuff to bring out on the choices. Someone want to start this?"
1321023,eddieshere,2011-06-21 16:23:00,2,"I have personally stayed at LSO 7 or 8 times even when it was Andersons, Ken and Brenda have a First Class Operation and well worth the money, for the last 8 years we have now been Houseboating. Either operator out of Hudson is Great! We like LSFL the best, as far as that 7 or 8 hour boat ride is one of the best days, sit back relax unpack and cook a lunch and you're there. There is nothing better than having your own island out on Lac Seul. Getting ready to go in two weeks, hope we get the same kind of weather!"
1321074,rnnonmt,2011-06-21 18:17:00,992,tv4fish: Yes that is what I paid for the week.
1321090,rnnonmt,2011-06-21 18:41:00,992,"No worries and no blame here either. Just wanted to share a great trip with some of the WC'ers that helped me choose the cabin over decades of using the houseboat. Fortunately for me I was able to have a great time, great fishing, awesome hospitality from Lac Seul Outposts and most of all with my Family. In another few years there will be another of my sons old enough to go and hope to share those same moments. We will definately be re-booking next year at LSO. LOL... maybe I can get my Dad to stop putting the choke hold on his fish like in the picture on the initial post page. Here are a few more teaser pics to enjoy"
1321174,Hawkfan,2011-06-21 23:02:00,237,Those are some great pictures. Thanks for sharing.
1320611,rnnonmt,2011-06-20 16:54:00,992,"Just wanted to say thanks to the walley central croud that gave us some information on areas just south of Chamberlain. This was the first year staying at Lac Seul Outposts and I have to say we were a bit hesitant staying there as we have been die hard houseboaters out of Hudson. I can't say enough good things about the staff at Lac Seul Outposts in Chamberlain. A big thumbs up to their hospitality. Not one of our requests fell on deaf ears. Ken, Brenda, Garrett, Chris, Danny and Christine.... thanks for a memorable trip and keeping us taken care of, gassed, iced, minnowed, fed, hotspots and tips, the shore lunch and more. My 11 year old son and my Dad accompanied me along with other family/friends. We stayed 7 days (12th-19th) and had beautiful weather, never once putting on rain gear. Infact, I got quite the sunburn. My son landed the biggest walleye (30 inches) I have ever seen in the 15 years I have been going. Couldn't have been more proud of him....and a bit jealous too. My best was a 41 inch Pike and my Dad with a 42 inch musky."
1320624,eyemike,2011-06-20 17:11:00,233,Nice pics of some very nice fish. It looks like one proud boy you have there and a prouder dad from the sound of it! Mike
1320632,Lazy Fisherman,2011-06-20 17:33:00,276,Sounds like a very memorable trip.
1320727,Iowa Hawkeye,2011-06-20 21:34:00,90,Some nice fish there. Was the cost per person comparable to using the house boats? Thanks
1320744,rnnonmt,2011-06-20 22:42:00,992,"Thanks for the comments as yes I am definately Jealous of the big walleye my son landed. As far as cost goes it was a 7 day trip with a pick up/drop off at Deception ramp, in a cabin with electric, hot/cold water, toilet, shower, full kitchen (less microwave), bbq grill, deep fryer, propane, all utensils, wireless internet, boats with 30 hp mercs, 5 gals gas/daily, and ice for $1000.00. Groceries, liquor etc and bait are not included AND we were fishing within an hour of being picked up in Deception. Total cost for me was $1300 not including my transportation to/from Deception Landing. Not much price difference from the 65 foot houseboat rental. Within a hundred bucks or so. We fish the NE section of Lac Seul and what really makes the difference in our trip is the travel time in the houseboat. Driving the housboat at a blazing 7 mph that far north consumes 7 hours up and 7 hours back. Thats 14 hours of fishing time lost. Not to mention the $800 dollar gas bill for the houseboat from last year. My opinion is that I would personally won't be going back to the houseboat option."
1320816,jswinter40,2011-06-21 07:41:00,127,"Where the houseboat becomes more affordable is where you can split cost with a larger multi-paying party. For example, we have 9 guys going in a couple of weeks to split the costs. In contrast, it would cost each person the $1300 minimum not including gas to Sioux Lookout no matter how many people come. Gonna cost me appox $750 for full week (door to door) and this includes everything including gas on the way up and back and all food and bait.Lac Seul Outpost is in great spot and is in no way a bad choice or worse than a HB. Its like comparing resorts that pay by the person vs paying by the cabin."
1320832,Bitinlight,2011-06-21 08:33:00,95,"Fished a ton of places in Ontario for over 30 years--camping on islands, staying at resorts, fly-ins, and boat-ins. Most were great trips, and a few not so good because of the weather, etc. My fishing partner found Lac Seul Outposts, and we decided to give it a try. Might cost a few extra bucks, but the accomodations, hospitality, and fishing found here makes me want to look no further. We now make two trips per summer--one in June with the guys and one in July with our wives. I like watching the houseboats move slowly down the lake, but have no interest."
1320839,jswinter40,2011-06-21 08:46:00,127,"don't get me wrong, I didn't want to come across bashing Lac Seul Outposts because it is where I would go because of such a great location and accomidations. I was just simply stating the cost difference. That said Lac Seul Outposts is priced similar to most camps. There are some cheaper but definitely not on that portion of Lac Seul."
1320870,Bitinlight,2011-06-21 10:12:00,95,"I would agree. It's what each person is looking for and can afford. I would stay on a houseboat if it provided the facilities that Lac Seul Outposts provides, and I didn't have to drive it to that part of the lake and back. I have a boat very similar to the ones provided there, but I also like the idea of not taking my boat and just paying to use theirs--16 foot Lunds, padded seats, and 30 Merc 4 strokes that you can go all day on less than 5 gallons. It's nice fishing out of your own boat, but sometimes it can be a hassle getting it there, and then, if you have trouble, you have another problem."
1320933,tv4fish,2011-06-21 13:05:00,2694,"JS and rronn-- You're confusing me here (sometimes pretty easy to do) Js: Are you saying that EACH of the 9 guys on the houseboat pay $750 for the week.AND rnn: Are you saying each member of your party paid $1,000 each for the week or $1,300 for the week?"
