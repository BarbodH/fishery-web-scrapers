1319051,#lakes.area75,2011-06-16 12:50:00,19,JS- we usually fish the upper northeast portion of the lake. we go out through lac seul floating lodges. what about you? Pacman- glad to hear it was a good trip and you are very lucky to get that second trip! I could only wish for two trips
1319079,jswinter40,2011-06-16 14:18:00,127,"Kurt,We will be going with Sioux Lookout Floating Lodges. Fishing up the east/northeast side. Can't wait, great place. hoping for some warmer weather up there then what it has been. if we get some consistent weather i don't see why it won't be great fishing. This will be my 8th year there, not all on a houseboat however. good luck. by the sounds of it the water is rising some and the houseboats are going through the ""RAGS""."

We find the fish in the same spots as June except maybe a little deeper and use jigs with crawlers or minnows. The wives seem to always catch the biggest fish ranging from 26-28 inches. If you have a wife that likes to fish walleyes, there is no better place than Lac Seul."
