1315465,midnight-12,2011-06-07 10:02:00,3,i am going to eagle lake this coming week....we are staying on the western end of the lake - i have never been to eagle lake before....i would like to focus on walleyes and smallmouth bass. what should i expect fishing wise? is this a good end of the lake to fish or should i be going somewhere else? any lure/bait suggestions and depths to start looking? i am guessing the fish will be shallow...under 10 ft or are they deep during the day even this early? TIA midnight

That said, if you were a little more specific than the ""western end"" it might be easier to steer you in the right direction. The camp where you are staying should have suggestions. There are always more than one pattern going on at any one time. Next week, the pattern that I would look for would be an emerging weed, mud flat bite for walleye.....8-12 feet of water with some variation depending on the weather conditions. Trolling cranks, or jig and minnow. Bass are on or near spawning beds.......warmest water in the back of bays would be a starting point. If you need more suggestions you can download a free fishing tips e-book for Eagle Lake that I have just put up on my website..... www.vermilionbaylodge.com (hope that isn't considered blatant advertising, but the question was asked....)"

1316904,midnight-12,2011-06-10 15:25:00,3,thanks for the help Gord....i printed out the e-book to take and read with me.....i'm sorry i should have said the farthest west you can (i think) @ stanley's resort (wasn't even sure of the resort at the time since i'm going with friends and they book everything)...i will certainly talk with them (stanley's) as well but was kind of looking for a starting point for packing tackle/gear as well as other people's opinion...which you gave me...i will post a reply on how i did or didn't do...i'm not that good of a walleye fisherman (i mainly musky fish and lake michigan fish). thanks again. midnight
1316980,v-bay gord,2011-06-10 20:20:00,3168,Thanks Midnight.... Hope your week goes well. Talk with John Bratland while you are there (he guides at Stanley's) for suggestions.......also Rob the owner. Hopefully they can steer you in the right direction. Look forward to hearing how you do. The water temps are just now starting to warm up...I think the next couple of weeks will see some great fishing.....I hope you are part of it!!! The suggestions in the e-book are all proven to work.....use them!

1318337,v-bay gord,2011-06-14 16:08:00,3168,"Whitey...we can make it work! Fishing this week has been great. Weed edges, working windy shorelines, 6-14 feet of water, jigs/minnows, or trolling crankbaits......it all works when the fish are turned on. Weather has been improving too......it's all good!"
1320686,midnight-12,2011-06-20 19:44:00,3,"talked with the guys @ stanleys before heading out tried trolling shore lines and rock reefs with cranks.....no hits....fished 12-25ft of water caught some fish fishing SLOW...jig/twister, jig/ring worm, jigging spoon, jig/minnow, lindy rigs, jig/leech and minnow/bobber....8-20ft of water not big numbers but quality fish...only 2 under the slot...most in the upper end of the slot...and 2 over the slot i did better than most in my group but also fished the most....2nd biggest in group...25 inches saw some real big muskies just drifting with the current a few feet down over deep water....i'm guessing sunning themselves to warm up???? midnight"
