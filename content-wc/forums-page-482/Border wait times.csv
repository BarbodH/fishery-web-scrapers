We always have about a hour to a hour and a half wait. Anybody else have short wait times? Do you think it is less people going to Canada?
1320913,Guest,2011-06-21 12:10:00,0,I think between the econony and gas prices (eventhough they are coming down) there are less people coming north. I also think the issues at the border with prior DUI's are taking a toll. We lost two from our group because of that issue alone.
1320915,Mike Kansas,2011-06-21 12:12:00,1463,Same thing about 11:00 am last friday. One car in front of us. Sure helps travel time back home. Last year almost 3 hour wait.

1320946,illiniharrison,2011-06-21 13:38:00,4,Yes less How long ago were there dui's? What border crossing was this? Dont remember what it actually called but did they try to pay the $200 fees to help them cross. Going in three weeks and this might be a issue for our group as well.
1320994,Guest,2011-06-21 15:20:00,0,"There were two one was less then 5 years old. They let him in for $200.00 the other guy had two or three long past. The let him in for $200.00 they crossed in N Dakota where I29 goes into Canada. I thought they were lucky to get in at all. But, they didn't want to do the PW to get in this year so they dropped out"

Going up 71 to Kenora the resorts in Nestor Falls/Sioux Narrows areas looked half full at best. Our resort was only 25% occupied. Water temps at start of week were 56 degrees and only 58 at end of week. Fishing was just o.k. Boat traffic on north end of LOW was very low."
