I have read on other forums and spoke to the owner Art before at shows in the past and know its a primitive camp. How is the equiptment and cabins etc. I have read before that they are rough and they have someone new running the operation. Thinking about going into kipawa area in september and considering this as well as the outpost, ogascan kikwissi and kipawa. Any input on this and others will be appreciated"

We know all the hot spots and techniques and will share them with you if needed. Cant speak for the other outfitters but Bush has servicable cabins outhouses and an older fleet of boats and motors that get the job done. Meal plan is offered but your better off eating all the walleye you catch. Prices are in line with the others in the area. Location on the lake on an island is the best in that part of quebec. The outfitter on the south end of the lake has a few cabins worth checking out in the middle of the lake, they are nice and close to some of our honey holes, we have always caught a bunch of bigger walleye near these cabins. Check out Kipawa.net for couceesee and ogascanan reports and a bunch of Kipawa stuff. Taggarts is one we are thinking about for a future trip as well as club trout lake and osullivans in Maniwaki. FYI Art is no longer there, he has a new guy named Norm House operating the camp. Some of our group wanted a lil different camp this year, one that has flush toilets a meal plan and modern boats for a decent price so we are headed through the soo which is new for us on up to Timmins to fish Horwood lake. Our number one camp though is Bush Country, a samll group of us is going up in Aug/Sept also, maybe we'll see you there."

It was a hard decision to make, but in the end I let my father choose and he picked Horwood (I think it was because they have food, lol). I probably would have picked Two Moon, but I was really excited to try either place.As Jacksonie mentioned, the Kipawa message board is a good place to do some reading - although, they are all die hard Kipawa fans =)."
