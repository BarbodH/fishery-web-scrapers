1241556,Bearfangary,2010-10-10 17:37:00,22,"Sorry for the late report.Sept 17 thru 23, 2010 - Fished Bear Paw Lodge on Caribou Lake, near Armstrong Ontario. I was told this was originally a boat-in resort, but the loggers got a little close and the owners put in a road about 4 years ago. We had the lake to ourselves (26 miles long) and shared it only with a few moose and bear hunters.There are 4 cabins (our group had 2) on a small bay on the southern end of the lake. We took our own boats, but the rentals they have are 16' Lunds with 40 hp Merc, trolling motors and electronics. Cabins were well kept with gas heaters and decks and a nice fish cleaning shack. They supplied coffee makers and each cabin had a dishwasher! They also supplied minnows and when we asked if they could get bigger ones for Lakers, the owner went out a trapped us a few small suckers.The Walleyes were deep (30') when we got there and as the week went on we caught them up to 50' down. Biggest was 25.5"", but most were 15"" to 20"". We did a lot better in the northern part of the lakes amongst the islands (easy to get lost though). We did have some slow days and the wind made it pretty rough a couple afternoons. Walleye were caught on minnows, leeches, crawlers, and gulp.Biggest northern was 38"" (caught by mistake), and we got several lakers (biggest 26""), some while we were trying for them, others while walleye fishing. The lakers moved shallow later in the week and I caught 2 on the top of a 6' bar.We were well treated and plan on returning next spring. If you want more information about this great lake and lodge, message me and I'll be happy to share. BFG"

1313242,Bearfangary,2011-05-31 20:35:00,22,"Did well enough last fall that we're going to do the spring trip at Bear Paw. Leaving on the 10th, overnight in Thunder Bay, and then fish gods willing, I'll be on the water by 2PM Saturday. Picked up some nice downriggers to cover more water for lakers, and got a few bucktails for northern, Walleyes I'm set for but I've mostly jigged for them and from what I've heard planner boards do real well also. I'll post results and pictures, unless they offer me a job, then I might just stay. - BFG"
1313378,camp chef,2011-06-01 07:59:00,915,Have a great trip Gary.Stay out of Skippy's wake. He has a new machine.
1316125,Bearfangary,2011-06-08 19:35:00,22,29 hours to go. I hate when everything is packed ahead of time. I've gone through everything twice more to make sure - BFG
1320680,ole timer,2011-06-20 19:38:00,34,How about a report on the Caribou Lake trip. I'll be going in Sept.
1320879,bode,2011-06-21 10:40:00,39,"Thanks for your post about Caribou. Our group has gone the past 9 years to Caribou Lake. We go the end of July and do most of our fishing in the area of Beaver Island, Fred's Point, and Green Island.We are going a second time this year around mid September, so I was very interested in your report from last year's trip about that same time period.Good luck on your upcoming trip--we won't be there until July 30th."
1321119,Bearfangary,2011-06-21 20:01:00,22,"Hi All,The trip is always fun and its great to get away, but the fishing for us was downright poor. After a great trip to Caribou last September, the 2nd week in June this year didn't turn out too well. Four of the days we had temps from 80 - 90Â° and some of those days there wasn't much wind at all. What wind we did have was out of the southeast. The guys in the other cabins were from Thunder Bay and blamed the slow fishing on the wind and the full moon on the 13th. It was only cloudy one day (the best fishing day), and we never had a drop of rain. The rest of the week was very sunny and very hot.Biggest Walleye of the group was 29"" and was caught in 30+ ft of water. Those who did ok on eater size eyes found them in very shallow water (2 - 6ft) but only early and late in low light. We mainly fish jig and minnow-leech-crawler, but the presentation that worked for some was minnow hooked in the tail with a small hook and a split-shot 18"" up. Cast up to the shallows and wait for an eye to swim by. We had to cancel one shore lunch for lack of fish and brought 9 home (out of 8 guys).I trolled for lakers with downriggers and marked a lot of fish 30 - 40' down in 60+ ft of water. Only hooked up with 3 and those were quite small and released unharmed. As a group we caught 10 lakers in the 24 - 29"" range, but the funny thing was they were all caught while jigging for walleyes in 12 - 20 foot of water on small jigs tipped with small minnows or crawlers.We were treated well by Darcy and Joy and the trip both ways was uneventful. On the way up we were stopped by an OPP check point (probably smelling for drink, but we were clean) and on the way back there were a lot of bear crossings (no moose though). We take our time going up and overnighted in Thunder Bay. Had a great steak at the Keg (pretty pricey but worth it). BFG"
