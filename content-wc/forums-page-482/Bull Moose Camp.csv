We fished Mamakwash Lake a lot more than Upper Goose because we had early success on Mamakwash. Fished only for Walleyes but caught quite a few Northerns as well. Fished mostly with a jig & twister tipped with a crawler and trolled with a HotnTot every now & then. Some other guys in camp fished Upper Goose exclusively and also caught tons of Walleyes--a lot in the 23-25"" range. The camp was nice, boats/motors good & owners accomodating. FYI--- Green Airways has a camp on Mamakwash. You might wanna consider Trout Lake out of Red Lake as well. Fished there as well, once in July & once in August. Caught tons of Walleyes here as well. Was very tough to get any under 18"" and caught a lot in the 25-28"" range. Stayed at Booi's once and Cat Island Lodge once."
