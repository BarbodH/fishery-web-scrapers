Purchased our extra-large Minnows from their camp store in Sioux Lookout for the first time and Vicki really provided the best bait we've ever had. Lots of Rainbow Dace and very few suckers. Just fabulous!! We had 3 guys and caught 1170 walleyes in 7 days. Blue bird sunny skies all week, mid 60's and very little wind. Surface temp. was 60 degrees, a little too warm but we still caught plenty. Thought I died and went to heaven. 3/8 and 1/2 ounce silver and gold Strobe Jigs and Chartreuse were the best producers with some also on white/glow jigs. Most fish were caught from 20' to 27' vertical jigging. Keep the bait moving side to side and lifting and dropping. 40% of our fish were under 18"" 30% in the slot and 30% over the slot. Biggest was 28 1/2 with a few 27's and lots of 24's and 25's. Very little other boat traffic a couple of Musky troller's and only 1 house boat. We did get checked on Thursday and Friday by the DNR, no problems, very nice polite and friendly young warden. Found out that they have a cabin at Pickeral Narrows so they can stay over night. Just play by the rules and no problems. IMO it can't get much better! Now just waiting for Little Bay De Noc next month. Milfish"

Although not a rookie, our fishing spots are determined by my friends who have been there 20+ years. I think they like to fish memories, if you know what I mean. Most of our fishing was done in Wapesi or south in Tuk. Did you mark a lot if fish in the areas you were fishing and were you far from camp?"
4255762,milfish,2015-10-10 07:41:00,249,"Hi David, Normally we would go to Wapisi, Scaler and even South of Bear Narrows. This year we found fish around the corner from Camp towards Tom Camp (Andersons) on the first day and decided that North would be our direction for the year. Spoke with another group that went South with poor results so that had us go North also. Birch Narrows, Pine Island, In-a-bit/Out-a-bit were are areas of primary focus. Many times we wouldn't mark any fish but as soon as you raised it up about 3' and slowly dropped the bait they would appear and strike hard. Color was very important. I always had a gold and a silver ready to change up at the ready. if the sun went behind a cloud for 2 minutes, I would switch from silver to gold and vie-versa. Always seems that sunny=silver and cloudy=gold. I can't stress the importance of the Strobe Jig also. made with long shank Aberdeen hooks for big minnows hooked Canadian style. Sometime as many as 3 fish on a minnows hooked this way, with the record being 6 fish on the same bait. If you haven't used the strobe jig, get some!"
4256818,David Anderson,2015-10-10 22:58:00,2073,"Thanks for the reply. Wapesi was pretty bad and as you state, around the corner was our go to spot for supper! I like the long shank jigs but maybe I need to give up the challenge of trying to out fish with white and chartreuse. I like your idea of bringing in the big minnows from their camp store. By chance were you the guys at the landing on Friday morning? Good luck on LBDN, Maybe we'll see you up there some time."
4259514,milfish,2015-10-12 13:13:00,249,Dave we always boat in around 5PM on Fridays and out on Saturday AM. Going in on Saturday Morning can really be a mess depending on how many are leaving and how many are coming in. Son it wasn't us there on Friday morning.
