4294082,lama231,2015-10-31 07:57:00,29,"This is my first post here and I am looking for help. We are located outside of Chicago and had a bad experience on the Clearwater Pipestone chain this summer. Lots of fishing pressure and bad resort, oh well whats done is done but am looking for advice. We will be traveling mid July 2016 and will probably go to the Vermillion bay area. Considering the Indian lake chain, Indian Lake Lodge or Eagle Lake Vermillion Bay Lodge. I am a little concerned about Eagle with the big water also have read horror stories about non marked reefs and rocks as I ran into a problem last year with unmarked water and cost me $850.00 in damage when a guy come flying through the South Portage channel on Clearwater and the lower unit was damaged.mI have not been able to find much info on the Indian lake chain but what I have read so far is that chain is more Musky water. We are primarily looking to fish Walleye and Smallmouth although we may pitch some big lures to try to hook a Musky. For us action is more important than hunting down trophy fish although some big fish would be nice. There will be six of us, three to a boat and we are not interested in taking a guide. Any help would be greatly appreciated"
4294154,bigwillies,2015-10-31 08:35:00,515,The Indian lake chain would definitely be easier to navigate being a smaller system if u are worried about that. Most lodge owners will usually help u out the best they can and point u in the right direction and tell u travel routes. eagle is a big system and Indian smaller. Don't think u can go wrong with either. Try doing a search on both. Should find some useful info
4294266,bobbylfishermon,2015-10-31 09:19:00,241,"My wife and I have been staying at Indian Lake Lodge for 15 years, the cabins are spotless and well equipped for house keeping, the camp lay out is flat and easily navigated, the camp boats are deep V's with 40hp or up grade to 50hp's, the owners, Lance and Cheryl Delorme are very genuine people and will do their best to make your stay enjoyable. Now to the fishing, the chain is a numbers fishery, tons of smaller walleye, 13-15 inchers (eaters) but there is also a chance to score some big fish,( my wife and I have caught two 29's, a 30, and a 32incher (walleye)in the last 2 years. Lots of muskie too, the wife got a 50incher this Sept, (the picture in in the Albums of this web site), northerns, and smallies are also around, and if you are having trouble finding fish, Lance can help put you on them. We are picky about camps and would not recommend something that does not fit our eye, hope you find what you're looking for, any questions, PM me and I'll try to help out..."
4294434,fishlipz09,2015-10-31 11:05:00,26,"I have fished out of Vermilion Bay Lodge for the last 2 years in mid June and would definately recommend it. If you are concerned about big water it is near the West Arm and plenty of smaller water. Our biggest problem this year was catching walleyes under the slot. That's a great problem to have. Gord will definitly help you get on fish if you need it. He is also the best I have ever seen at cleaning fish. We bring our own boats but his looks to be more than adequate. This is my 1st post also, hope it helps."

4294666,lama231,2015-10-31 13:38:00,29,So far Indian lake seems to be winning. Keep posting Thanks
4295218,ftfarms,2015-10-31 19:15:00,444,Of the two I would go with V-bay Gord eagle lake.
4295858,pjshorthorn,2015-11-01 05:16:00,5654,"I have never fished the Indian Chain so I can't offer any first hand experiences but based on the many posts by WC members, it sure sounds like a great fishery with many nice lodge choices. . I have fished Eagle Lake out of Vermilion Bay Lodge and found it to be a wonderful place to go with easy access to town if necessary.The lake is very easy to navigate if you pay attention and don't get overly anxious to get from point A to point B. I only came across one reef while trolling that I thought could be a problem if a person were to go ripping across that area. It was associated with an island so I tend to take extra care when motoring off/around islands and mid lake reefs where structure is visible. There were many other reefs that were well marked and matched up perfectly to the map I was using along with some feedback from Gord.The lodge and cabins are very, very nice and the service is outstanding. I have posted a trip report on WC so just look it up , using the search function, under my name and there will be a more detailed narrative about our experiences. I also posted a video of the trip on youtube under my name as well.The lake offers multi species fishing with a few portage lakes that are accessible only for V-Bay Lodge guests. I believe one of the lakes is an outstanding smallmouth lake. The lakes offer walleye, northern, lake trout, muskie, whitefish, perch, smallmouth and bourbot so one will never be bored if you want to fish for more than one species each day. Our group did just that and had a blast exploring and trying new things with runs of up to 8 miles or so. The chance at a very nice muskie is ever present. During the week we were there, three fish over 40"" were landed and released by others in a two day period. The equipment is quite nice. We rented an upgrade 18' Alumarine that had a new 40HP Yamaha with electric start, H-Bird fish locator and a new Minn Kota trolling motor with Terrova. Couldn't have asked for a better boat. We fished in 2-3 ft. chop during a couple of stormy days and it effortlessly handled the waves with a dry ride and minimal porposing while running at a decent speed. The upgrade boat was also very affordable and I won't fish any other way when at V-Bay Lodge. Tons of room for two people and easily allows 3 people to fish comfortably. The price for 7 days is extremely competitive and in Canadian funds.... which is a bonus with the current exchange rate. With a group of 6, I'm not sure you will find a more reasonable rate. Check out the V-Bay Lodge website for the rates. Just sent in my deposit for 2016 so we will be returning to learn the lake even more the first week of August. Gord will put you on spots that hold fish....just ask. The catching is up to you though .If you would like more info. on V-Bay Lodge or Eagle Lake, send me a PM and I'll be glad to help out. Attached are a few pictures of some nice fish we caught. The walleye we caught were up to 27+ "".PjShorthorn"
4296866,bobbylfishermon,2015-11-01 16:11:00,241,"Hey lama, first of all, no offence to anybody, BUT, let's get real, ANYTHING on Eagle will cost you $150-250 per head more and the chain doesn't have a salvage co. coming in to salvage props and lower units that the dozens of camps and their customers tear up every year.... Eagle is big water and when the wind blows, you better know what you're doing, and you better have good equipment, and in july there will be a ton of pressure with all the camps, the fish will be down deep, and all the humps and reefs will have BOATS on them.. Sorry guys, my money will spent at the chain...."
4297410,pale ryder,2015-11-01 19:59:00,1937,"I have been fishing out of one of Clark's resorts for 25+ years, and I trust them completely. They have always been honest and run a good operation, everything clean and in good repair. We fished out of Clark's Camp on the Indian chain until 2005 when we switched to Clark's Northern Lights resort on Cedar Lake. I am sure their having their other camp for sale would have no effect on KC's.Anyhow, I highly recommend either the Indian chain or Cedar for reasonably skilled walleye and or musky fishermen. They are both small enough to be fishable in almost any weather and big enough so I don't get bored. In the same day you can catch fish in water less than 5' and deeper than 25' in weeds, wood, rocks, and suspended. Also they both have enough walleye to have very good fishing, but it is still enough of a challenge as to keep it interesting.I fished Eagle in the early 80's, and it is huge with all the good and bad that comes with it.Edit to add; The Indian chain has okay smallmouth fishing, but Cedar has much better smallie fishing and crapies."
4298642,bobbylfishermon,2015-11-02 14:42:00,241,"het lama, just want to be fair, the chain can be rough when it blows, and you better know what you're doing, and you better have good equipment to fish the wind, in july some of the fish will be down and the reefs and humps will have a few boats from 2 camps, there might be a little pressure, maybe.... there are a couple spots on the whole chain, where you might hit something, just wanted to be fair V-bay Gord, is that fair enough, or what???????????????????? Like I said, the truth......"
4298738,v-bay gord,2015-11-02 15:44:00,3168,"The truth is it's hard for me to attach the comments you made to the fellow who came and talked to me last year...b@tching and moaning about the lodge he was staying at.....and that's the truth. .....by the way, I haven't been able to find the number of that salvage company that works Eagle Lake....."
4299474,lama231,2015-11-02 23:13:00,29,"Boys Boys I don't want this to become an area for bad blood. Gord you were terrific when I called and it was your idea to try this board for some opinions. All I am trying to do is gather as much information as I can to make the most informed decision possible.What I really hoped for was somone out there who has fished both systems and get the pros and cons of both. I am torn by my memory of great fishing when I was there and my experience on Lake Vermillion which is a very large body of water like Eagle. I know it is your home lake and you can navigate it in your sleep but I was there 42 years ago and we had a guide every day, and with 3 in a boat already that would be difficult not to mention the expense. I realize that Eagle most likely has larger fish but in the Indian Lake chain there are small lakes that are easier to navigate hence my quandry. I appreciate the replies so for and all I want to do is make the best decision for my family. Thank You all and keep the comments coming"
4299674,v-bay gord,2015-11-03 06:17:00,3168,"Lama......no bad blood. Sometimes on this site opinions can be taken to task. For what it's worth I know your concern about size of water. In that regard the chain would be a good fit. Your other concern about the Clarks having one of their lodges for sale should not worry you. Wayne and Carla have built a great business over many years and are here to stay......bringing their daughter on board the business as well. Selling one of their camps would be a business decision and not anything else. If you did select the chain, you would be in close proximity to what you remember as ""Little Norway Camp"" and would be welcome to pop in for a visit and reminisce. So many options......so little time. Good luck!"
4301338,strength22,2015-11-04 08:16:00,49,"We fished out of clarks for like 4 years....great cabins and Wayne is amazing...however, I will say the fishing is average at best. Having fished all over Ontario there is much better walleye fishing in the red lake area rather than indian or even like the cedar, Perrault lake area which we fished as well. Not saying the fishing is bad at all...just saying I have found better fishing farther north is all. Not as much traffic that way. Now I have done the flyin lakes that clark now owns(they were doug gawley when we did them) they are ridiculous fishing. Eagle lake is way to big for me to even want to fish."
4297034,lama231,2015-11-01 17:18:00,29,"Actually the prices are about the same but VBL includes gas, not a deal breaker either way but I tried to compare like size lodges and prices. to go a little further the main reason that we are considering VBL is because I was there when I was a kid and the place was called Little Norway. I am 56 years old and was there twice when I was 13 and 14, a long time ago but we completely killed them plus the nostalgia of going back to the same camp after all these years. I told you we had a terrible experience this summer and here are some of the details. We stayed at a resort that shall remain nameless, I am not here to bash anyone but our group had some special needs that were explained to the owner before we booked. One was a cabin near the water because I have no cartilage in my right ankle and long uneven walks are a true pain for me. The second was 2 two bedroom cabins. Our friends who travel with us have a snoring issue and do not sleep in the same bedroom any longer. Well turns out the resort was once 2 separate camps and they told us that they sold one of the camps, the one we were supposed to stay in. I think the bank foreclosed but that is my opinion. The problem was that nobody bothered to pick up the phone and let us know what was going on. We were moved to a four bedroom cabin and a single room cabin about 300 yards from the water and down a hill. Had that been explained to us we would have found somewhere else to go, but no courtesy from the owners. The husband left on check in day to return to their winter home to go back to work because the resort was losing money, which left the wife and 1 dockhand to run the resort. They tried very hard but were way over their heads. The reason I have gone on this rant is because my first choice was KC's landing on the Indian Chain. The prices looked great as did the cabins and their prices included minnows and gas. Here is the problem. That resort is part of Clarks Camps which they have 3 drive to resorts plus a number of fly in outposts. As I was researching different resorts I found that one of their resorts Clarks Camp is listed for sale. After what happened last year I am very leary about getting into the same situation again But at the same time I feel like we are settling for our second choice if we book at Indian Lake Lodge. So that is my situation. Sorry to go on and on but I wanted you guys to know our issues from last year and I am trying to make this years trip something to remember"
