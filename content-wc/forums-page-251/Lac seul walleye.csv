4274666,DeBo,2015-10-20 15:13:00,211,Lac Seul is in the Green Zone for camping. No non resident camping. Might even be the same for canadian residents. You could check some of the lodges mentioned for some camping options. It's not roughing it out in the wild when you camp at a resort but it will save some $ if that is the goal.
4272338,Walleye will,2015-10-19 11:19:00,218,Any thought if the walleye fishing is better by ear falls or souix lookout.
4272530,wallydave,2015-10-19 12:58:00,2151,"Will check with Pat about the Souix Lookout Walleye! I have fished the Ear Falls area, mainly in the spring. The fishing can be great early, lots of traffic and some rude behavior. Late season Frank has had some good fishing, check with him too!"
4272642,bigwalleye1,2015-10-19 13:57:00,2632,"I think it depends a little on your style of fishing. More sand on the west side, so the riggers tend to do better there, jig guys seem to like the central part of the lake more. Don't know if they're related, and I may be reading something in to your posts, but your other post mentions camping on crown land in the Ear Falls area. Might want to do a little more research if camping on crown land to fish LS is your goal. I'm no expert, but I think non-residents are barred from camping on crown land within something like 1/2 mi of water in that area. Others will jump in, and maybe I'm reading more into your posts, but..."
4273026,ftfarms,2015-10-19 18:51:00,444,In my mind I would ask what time of year your going? In the spring walleye fishing can be good in all parts of lac suel. As the summer moves in I like the central part better but fishing around soix lookout is also good. Seems like for numbers of bigger fish the area around earfalls slows down after the water warms up But that's what we've found maybe just us.
4273882,skindzier,2015-10-20 09:38:00,137,"I've fished both, but spent more time on the Ear Falls side, generally around the beginning of July. Here's some observations... 1.) Though I've never fished either early in the year, consensus is that fish are close in to Ear Falls and pretty easy to find. I don't go early in the year because I also fish muskies. 2.) As you get into summer, on the Ear Falls side, there's a migration of the fish toward the main lake. The good news is that any reef or point in McKenzie Bay is likely to hold fish with good size likely mixed in. The bad news is that it is 20+ mile boat ride from Ear Falls through big water, so in high wind you simply can't do it. I've also had a couple white-knuckle trips back when the wind has come up mid-day. You have to look at a forecast before going out there. That isn't to say that there aren't fish closer in - my experience is just that it is better toward the main basin in summer. 3.) The beauty of the Sioux Lookout side from the Deception Bay landing is that much of it is more like river fishing - narrow with some current. You can fish there under almost any conditions. I've never caught as many on that side, but I've always caught fish. I've also not fished that side as much, so I don't have as many ""go to"" spots."
4273922,milfish,2015-10-20 09:48:00,249,"I can't really weigh in on the Ear Falls area having only been there one time in the mid 80's. Ever since we've been going to Chamberlain Narrows and see no reason to change. We average between 55 to 75 fish per day per guy, 40% shorter than slot, 30% in the slot and 30% over the slot. Always the last weekend in September/first weekend in October. Very little traffic with no issues fishing the spots you want too. I'm sure there are times that the fishing is better in the NE section and the mid and SW sections but we can't complain. Very relaxing! We really don't fish too hard either. On the water around 9:00 AM to start fish till 1:30, break for shore lunch 1:30 to 3:30 then 3:30 til dark (around 7:00 pm). Basically, 8 hours per day 7 to 10 fish per hour. Don't need anything better than that."
4274170,Walleye will,2015-10-20 11:34:00,218,"Where would u suggest to go for big walleye, central part? How far is ear falls from mekensie bay?"
4274226,rather-be-fishin,2015-10-20 11:48:00,429,"If you want to fish McKenzie Bay or main basin look at staying at resort closer to that area South of Ear Falls. Check out: Onaway Lodge, Lac Seul Lodge or Fisherman's Cove resort. Or, If you are trailering a boat you could launch it at Scout Bay landing. RBF"
4274290,skindzier,2015-10-20 12:22:00,137,"As RBF said, the resorts south of Ear Falls are closer to McKenzie, as is the Scout Bay ramp. I would say that from Ear Falls proper to McKenzie by water is 20-23 miles. From the Scout Bay ramp (which is close to the resorts south of Ear Falls), I'd say closer to 10-12 miles by water. In both cases you have to cross stretches of big open water to get to McKenzie (more so on the long ride from Ear Falls). Really once you are in & around McKenzie just fish the windy side of reefs points & islands. There is also sometimes a good bite off the Big & Little sandbanks, which are further into McKenzie and are marked on the Lac Seul maps. Any of the reefs marked on the maps with x's will usually produce."
4274298,skindzier,2015-10-20 12:24:00,137,"Also you asked about big walleye - I've definitely caught more big walleyes in McKenzie than anywhere else. We typically catch many 22"" + fish with the biggest usually in the 27"" range. I've yet to get a 30"", but I think it will come. I had a fish in McKenzie straighten the hook on a jig & it definitely was acting more like a walleye than a pike or musky - just hanging' on the bottom."
