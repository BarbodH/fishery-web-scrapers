Steelheading in the spring, and then working in the far north of Ontario on the Attawapiskat River at Eddie Norths for the better part of spring, summer, and fall. Caught my personal best steelhead this spring and then my pb walleye this september. Lots of amazing experiences, wildlife, and adventures. Managed to target sturgeon properly for the first time as well and landed a few nice fish. Hope you enjoy! Cheers, Matthttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKzE-RzxDTE"
