4267370,BornToFish,2015-10-16 07:42:00,1224,"I've been watching this topic from afar, as this 2/4 proposal for walleyes doesn't really matter much to my wife and me. We might keep three ""eater size"" walleyes (total) from time to time for a shore lunch. We didn't bring fish home with us the last several trips. The pieces seem to be falling together for me, having followed this thread. It appears as though someone came up with an idea (i.e. the 2/4 law referenced above) for LOTW, likely based on perception rather than fisheries management data. The idea was eventually translated into law, so that someone could gain an advantage. However, time showed these same people that they disadvantaged themselves in the larger picture. Now, these same people want their 2/4 law spread more widely throughout Ontario to ""level the playing field"", again without having any fisheries management data to support their proposal. Hmmh, sounds like politics to me. I have several good friends that own fishing lodges in NW Ontario. Thus, I occasionally see glimpses of the fishing lodges and industry, not just from the perspective of a guest, but rather from the perspective of a lodge owner. The comment in a previous post that the proposed change in Ontario law would only apply to non-residents causes me to be glad that I don't own a fishing lodge. It seems to me that at least some lodge owners might be wondering as to why the Ontario government isn't helping the tourism industry. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4267834,v-bay gord,2015-10-16 11:05:00,3168,That pretty much sums it up. The question then becomes why expect the government to help the industry when the industry is more interested in stabbing each other in the back? ..
4264922,johnboat,2015-10-14 20:06:00,2014,Is the sportsman's license and the conservation license one in the same?
4264994,wallydave,2015-10-14 20:51:00,2151,"Conservation is a limit of 2 walleyes and 2 Pike. Sportsman is 4 each, at least in Ontario."
4265026,johnboat,2015-10-14 21:10:00,2014,"Ok. Thanks. I should have Googled it. I guess I have always called the sportsman's license or sports fishing license as it's called on the Web page I checked, a full license. Hence my cornfusion."
4265426,Obabikon,2015-10-15 08:00:00,2370,"So basically.... a bunch of other lakes will have to deal with the idiotic head ache of 2 fish per day 4 total possession. LOTW's can handle it, because eating crappie or perch for shore lunch, isn't a big deal (even though I still hate the rule). The 2 per day 4 total is just silly, and completely useless/unproven. Just my 2 cents"
4265954,v-bay gord,2015-10-15 11:32:00,3168,"Yes, and there's the politics of the issue. While the rule makes no sense it has support from some short sighted operators in the southern zone, for no other reason than they feel it levels the playing field. .........but like I originally said, it has yet to get final approval."
4265994,Downrigger,2015-10-15 11:48:00,60,"Gord, it is my understanding from the regs covering Zone 5, that currently both the daily catch limit and the possession limit is 2 per person. Am I reading that correctly?"
4266026,v-bay gord,2015-10-15 12:07:00,3168,"That would be on a conservation license. Currently the sportsmen license allows a daily limit of 4, with a total possession limit of 4."
4266498,Obabikon,2015-10-15 17:26:00,2370,"Rather than force everyone else into the idiotic rule, it would be better to go the other way... back to 4/4 so that everyone has a ""level"" playing field. But, Government isn't going to listen to me."
4266634,v-bay gord,2015-10-15 18:29:00,3168,You do have a lobby organization in your area..NWOTA...that could benefit from your views....
4267242,Obabikon,2015-10-16 06:59:00,2370,NWOTA is the one that pushed for it on LOTW's in the first place. I do give my opinions to them.
4262026,wallydave,2015-10-13 14:03:00,2151,Has anyone heard any chatter about the Sportsmens license being changed in Ontario?
4262210,rosh1,2015-10-13 14:37:00,275,Went to a meeting in v-bay. MNR thinking of changing limits to 2.
4262578,v-bay gord,2015-10-13 16:45:00,3168,"There was a proposal to change the daily walleye limit to 2, 4 in possession (the reduction is in the daily limit, not in the overall possession limit). This is in Fisheries Management Zone 5 (north of the border but south of Lac Suel). It hasn't been approved yet........"
4263714,BornToFish,2015-10-14 07:56:00,1224,"I believe that I first learned about this proposed change in Ontario law about one year ago, having read about it on Walleye Central. I promptly brought this matter to the attention of a good friend that operated a fishing lodge in Ontario at the time. He asked some questions and reported to me that the proposed change in law was targeting a reduction in the fish harvested by ""day trippers"". I assume ""day trippers"" are primarily residents of Minnesota that make trips to fish in Ontario and then return home the same day. The lakes that such fishermen target are likely within a relatively short distance of the U.S./Canada border. This is consistent with previous comments on this thread. My friend also reported that the proposed change in Ontario law was not based on fisheries management data. That is, the proposed change in Ontario law is most likely based on someone's ""common sense"" or ""politics"". If ""common sense"" is driving the proposed change in Ontario law, I would like to think that at least someone is trying to conserve Ontario's fish resources - a noble endeavor. However, with an absence of data, this topic seems to degrade into ""politics"", as no one knows if the proposed change in law will make a positive and measurable difference. It's comforting to me to know that ""politics"" are likely the same in both of our countries. I hope the above information is helpful. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4263794,tv4fish,2015-10-14 08:21:00,2694,"WELLLLL - We all know that those 2 terms do NOT always ""go together"" (in fact - very seldom do they coincide)........."
4263874,LOW1,2015-10-14 08:36:00,2828,I don't have the Border Waters rules in front of me but on Lake of the Woods would this change not provide the same limits for Canadians as it now does for others on the Border Waters? And would it not be an increase in the limit for non-Canadians on the Canadian side of Rainy Lake?
4263986,Bill Krejca,2015-10-14 09:05:00,6107,"It has been my observation that limits have been/are being gradually reduced in certain Ontario areas due to an increasing harvest of available resources in that sector. This may or may not be as a result of harvesting other than that of rod and reel techniques. A quick and easy nonpolitical solution for slowing that fishery population decline is just to reduce the limits for those who are using rod and reel. If past actions are any indication of possible future changes, i would expect this kind of ""problem solving"" to continue. Bill"
4264866,v-bay gord,2015-10-14 19:36:00,3168,"Totally correct on your analysis. The only fisheries management data used to come up with this decision was a one time lake survey of a number of lakes in the zone. Is a ""snapshot"" significant in determining a trend? Obviously not. The proposed change was not a recommendation of the fisheries advisory council (members include lodge owners and other users), nor of the overseeing steering committee (MNR representatives from the zone). The decision was made by the 4 MNR district managers in the zone. It does tend to ""level the playfield"" in terms of spreading present ""border water rules"" further north......this is a political decision, not supported by biological or social rational. The fact that it applies to only non-residents is problematic in my mind."
4264874,v-bay gord,2015-10-14 19:39:00,3168,It does not increase the limits for the current border water zone. It extends north the reduced daily limit of 2 walleye for non-residents only.
4264882,v-bay gord,2015-10-14 19:43:00,3168,"One solution to cutting limits is to look at the Eagle Lake model (slot size) which has resulted in an improved walleye fishery based on the MNR's own netting surveys. Reducing daily limits to non-residents is a knee jerk, and unproven reaction to a problem that hasn't been shown to exist."
