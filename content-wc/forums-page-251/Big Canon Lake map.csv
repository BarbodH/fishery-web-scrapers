4242050,adempsey,2015-10-04 13:58:00,963,"Didn't see it on any of my cards (Navionics, Garmin Inland, Trak Maps). I do have a PDF depth map if you want me to post it up."

None that I know of with water depth info. but there are some with the topography, islands, etc, that certainly can be used for navigation to find the way back to the landing for dinner! Mine is a Navionics chip. Good luck, as you know the ""newbies"" will have a great time."

4245362,ackermannsacre,2015-10-05 19:12:00,196,I think a couple will have a gps so I can make sure they waypoint the docks on the lake and river. Thanks
