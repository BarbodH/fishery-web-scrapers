There would be 4 of us fishing. I fish LOW quite frequently, just looking for a change of scenery and some good fishing a little further north. Thanks"
4246202,Baseline,2015-10-06 07:30:00,3207,"If you want a change of scenery and have snowmobiles and portable gear Musky Bay Resort on Crow out of Nestor Falls is a good choice. They can get you on some lake trout and have several walleye lakes off of portage trails they fish. They are in the same neighborhood as LOW, but it would be different scenery with out driving too far."
4246370,Mark R,2015-10-06 08:24:00,1538,Evergreen Lodge in Ear Falls offers ice fishing. I think they do pretty well
4246418,123chadder,2015-10-06 08:40:00,429,"good question,id also like to know"
4247714,prov1800,2015-10-06 15:58:00,5010,I do take parties out for ice fishing.just basically have parties stay at the motel in vermilion bay and if you have sleds and the main essentials i can do the rest.
4248266,zachstafford90,2015-10-06 19:23:00,5,Thanks everyone for the responses. I will have to take a look at some of these places.
4248994,Xplorer,2015-10-07 07:20:00,244,"I've had friends go here in winter and seemed very reasonable, however you do need to have sleds to get into the cabins and lakes to fish. Walleye and access to some incredible lake trout water (White Otter). Out of Ignace Another option might be Browns Clearwater West resort. We have only fished trout there in winter (lakers, splake, brookies and browns are available in nearby lakes) but there has to be some walleye lakes close by. North of Atikokan."
4258306,chris165,2015-10-12 05:48:00,128,Crawford's Camp in Sioux Narrows is great. Owner Matt Ryberg will put you on fish.
4265314,BenBeattie,2015-10-15 07:22:00,232,"In the Sioux Lookout area (Minnitaki, Lac Seul) Winoga Lodge rents snowmobiles and all equipment is available, as well as cabins. Moosehorn has cabins available in the winter. I take some trips as well, but like ProV1800 said, you need all all your own equipment. More info on my website benbeattieoutdoors.com"
