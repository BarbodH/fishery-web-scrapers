4285394,mlure,2015-10-26 12:37:00,15,Came back a week ago. Did excellent on crappies at Hay. 42 fow using crappie rigs. Much better size than Miles or Obabikon. Saw way too may dead fish floating.
4285802,Bill Krejca,2015-10-26 17:19:00,6107,"Thanks for the info. Crappies caught will start getting the ""bends"" from about 22 feet on down, +/- a little, apparently due to weather conditions (pressure). A certain number will return down if flipped when released, providing they are not bloated. Did you have to dodge the gourging eagles? I try to fish a little shallower when they go that deep. Bill"
4260210,FishinFreaks,2015-10-12 18:59:00,386,"Heading to Sabaskong on Lake of the Woods this week. Have been planning to troll muskies, but the water temps may be a bit on the warm side for them to put the feedbags on just yet.Have heard crappies are going good. But I'm not much of a crappie guy. What jigs/plastic combos would be good? Any help is appreciated.Tanks."
4260274,1700SS,2015-10-12 19:25:00,104,"1/8 oz with light winds. 1/4 oz when it gets breezy. Any color jig will work. I like chartreuse. Any color 2"" twister tail will work. I like chartreuse. 6lb mono with smallest swivel you have couple feet up from jig to minimize line twist. I also like using 1/8oz tubes. I did real well at the Elbow in Obabikon 4 weeks ago. They should be going good at Thompson creek also. Just look for the boats and join in on the action. Good luck!!"
4262834,Bill Krejca,2015-10-13 18:41:00,6107,"Tubes work well for me - bigger lure, bigger crappie, up to 2-3/4"". Red/white, red/chart, black/chart, yellow/white. I also use a hand tied jig in various colors which works very well in bright sunlight - it has silver or gold mylar.Bill"
4266098,Baseline,2015-10-15 12:51:00,3207,We're heading to Morson on this Friday. We fish for crappie around Stevens Bay and Miles Bay. I generally use a 1/8 oz jig tipped with a small white twister and a minnow tail. I was up to the Canadian side of Rainy 10 days ago and the water temps were at 52 to 54F so the Muskies should be on the prowl. Walleyes should be still present on the reef tops and off of the major island points. It there is current all the better.
4267898,Bill Krejca,2015-10-16 11:37:00,6107,"Please give us a return report on the trip, I'm very interested in your crappie success in Stevens. bill"
4268034,Baseline,2015-10-16 13:45:00,3207,We put the trip off till Sunday afternoon as the weather forecast looks a lot better for the Monday - Thursday. I'll post when we return.
4282498,Bill Krejca,2015-10-24 16:28:00,6107,"How about a report on the crappie fishing? Thanks, Bill"
4283226,FishinFreaks,2015-10-25 07:02:00,386,"For us the trip was decent. Not bad. Not stellar. We were finding the crappies in about 22 fow when we did find them. I would say they were scattered. We only located one decent school. We tried deeper and shallower with the same results. We found walleyes in 22-30 fow. The slower the better. Not many hits. Mostly very light bites. Your line woukd just be heavy all of a sudden, and then set the hook. Power bait or meat didn't seem to make a difference. Muskies were very slow. Water was still anywhere from 50-54. I'm sure it's down to the upper 40s now. We're heading back up this Thursday to give it another go. Hopefully the muskies are on the chew better this week."
4283874,Bill Krejca,2015-10-25 14:38:00,6107,"Thanks, FF. Anything (crappies)around Hay Island? The last time I was up, the best crappie spot was the narrows about 2 miles directly west of Young's. Bill"
4283986,FishinFreaks,2015-10-25 17:09:00,386,"We did not try around Hay. Talked with some guys that caught a few, but not hot and heavy."
