4117793,birddogger,2015-08-10 19:42:00,43,"I have the Lakemaster chip and it is very accurate. The only problem I have is that it keeps freezing up and screen goes white and sticks saying ""loading charts"". I have to repower the unit 10 -15 times a day and some days that doesn't even clear it.I got a second sd card and is better but still same problems.Anyone else have this problem?"
4118081,KHedquist,2015-08-10 21:37:00,4367,What sonar?
4118417,birddogger,2015-08-11 05:32:00,43,My boat is up at the lake and I'm home. I believe a 597c.I bought it just to run the lakemaster chip as all my units in the boat are Lowrance and lakemaster won't run in lowrance units. The lowrance unit have never had that problem in the 9 year life of the boat.I'm calling humminbird back today.I couldn't get through yesterday.
4121825,srj,2015-08-12 08:09:00,971,"Kirt, I love the Navionics webapp...probably my favorite app on any platform. The mapping on the webapp may be as good as the older Lakemaster for Lowrance, but is nothing like the detail and accuracy of the newest version of Bird/Lakemaster, at least for the Sabaskong/Little Traverse area of L-O-W. You would have to see the two side-by-side to compare. I will not be buying Bird stuff but I might have to borrow one when I go back to that part of the lake, which is about once a year. I don't expect Navionics to update their map as must be very few users compared to many other areas. Take care."
4122393,KHedquist,2015-08-12 11:39:00,4367,Yes please I would like to see some side by side comparisons of the same area.
4282042,srj,2015-10-24 09:31:00,971,"It's been a while but here is a screen shot of Marvins Island from a Hbird with the latest Lakemaster chip. Compare that to the Nav chip and see what you think. In case your map doesn't show Marvins Island as a name, it is just off the SW corner of Boomstick Island. There are two small islands and Marvins is the westerly one."
4110057,srj,2015-08-07 12:50:00,971,"Just returned from the Morson area and was very surprised how poor the Lakemaster Woods/Rainy mapping is compared to the latest Bird Lakemaster version. For Lowrance units, is their something better than Woods/Rainy V9? It was pretty weird...some areas were quite good while some areas were way off on location or didn't show structures at all. The V9 chip is great on the MN side and even on the Canada side until you get east and north of Big Island. If I fished that part of the lake much, I would have to buy a couple Birds. Suggestions?"
4110673,fishpoop,2015-08-07 17:32:00,630,If you have one of the Gen II or Gen III Lowrance units you can make your own maps. http://www.gofreemarine.com/insight-genesis/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDkOQT-KLashttp://www.gofreemarine.com/mapsYou can choose to share your created maps and download maps created by others. In time I expect all of LoTW to be mapped to 1 foot contours by using this. My Lowrance units are older and not able to do this. So I don't know either what I would do for a more accurate map now. Will be interested to see other replies.
4110977,BreezyPoint,2015-08-07 19:29:00,1581,"You should note that the Lakemaster maps were made using GPS technology. The inherent error of GPS is around 20 feet at best. So assuming an error of 20 feet, the specs for GPS say you will be anywhere within a circle 40 feet 95% of the time. This is about right on the published spec. GPS is not magic and is not as accurate as people think. The Lakemaster maps suffer from these inherent accuracies.I was at Red Wing Lodge when the Lakemaster folks mapped Sabaskong Bay and Burrow Bay. I saw them in action in Burrow Bay. Quite interestingly, they we're staying at Red Wing Lodge.So things like spot lock and return to a point with iPilot all suffer from this inherent inaccuracy. If they have improved the accuracy, that would be great.BTW, the 09 Lakemaster chip is far superior to the 6214 hydrographic map. I have found some big issues with 6214, including sagging reference lines in the center of the map. Maybe those are fixed with the latest version.And also, I know of numerous dangerous rocks that are not on Lakemaster or 6214. Several of those missing features have turned into favorite walleye spots and were found as near misses in my boat.Frank"
4111161,fishpoop,2015-08-07 20:37:00,630,Finding out that 6214 has errors in it is rather scary. I hope none of the uncharted rocks you mention are in high travel areas. I always thought that map was pretty accurate at least as far as lower unit wreckers are concerned.
4111201,BreezyPoint,2015-08-07 20:43:00,1581,"Here are a few: Just inside Mamiou Point came up to three feet this summer - could easily hit during low water. Another off the islands west of Duck bay Resort ( I hit this one) and finally another on the north side of Sunset Channel. There are several in the open water south of Sunset Channel, but I don't know where they are.Frank"
4111353,Obabikon,2015-08-08 05:28:00,2370,"I like the Lowrance Elite Pro map, but at the same time, I have found that the Lakemaster chip is as good as it gets for our area."
4111586,srj,2015-08-08 08:31:00,971,"Breezypoint, I almost found two rocks recently, both on structures not shown on my Lakemaster chip (V9 which I think was the last of the Woods/Rainy for Lowrance). I was going slow enough to grab reverse and avoid. However, they were both shown on my friends Bird unit with the newest and very much updated Lakemaster for Hummingbird. The difference between the old V9 and newest Bird chip is astounding. I like maps of all kinds. This dates me, but when we built our cabin on Whitefish Bay, the Canadian hydro map you referenced had not yet been published. Travelling the lake was interesting to say the least. It was a revelation when the new maps were released with depth contours, reefs, etc shown rather than just routes, some rock hazards and islands, some with names. The first Lakemaster Woods chip was another revelation to me, and now it seems the Bird Lakemaster chip is yet another....it is that much better, at least for the portion of LOW we were on. I very much like my Lowrance units and don't plan on switching, but if I was on Sabaskong and up into Little Traverse very much I would reconsider. I posted hoping to find that Lowrance had something better than my old Lakemaster, but it doesn't seem so. Maybe Navionics will someday get in the game. Their chip for the Big Traverse side is good now."
4111602,BreezyPoint,2015-08-08 08:35:00,1581,They must have gone through and done some more mapping or gotten feedback from users. That's good. My Lowrance units can't take the newer maps so I am stuck with what I have. I can't afford the huge cost of new electronics.Frank
4114265,KHedquist,2015-08-09 14:37:00,4367,Have you looked at the Navionics mapping for the area? Go to the web app online and you can preview the mapping. Be sure to click on the SonarChart view (sonar icon on the lower left) SonarChart is available on Nav + and Hotmaps Platinum. I have never been here but the feedback I have gotten from anglers that have been their it is really accurate. Check it out give me your feedback. http://webapp.navionics.com/?lang=en#@6&key=orbpGbpzwP
4115745,Shorelunch,2015-08-10 08:22:00,554,"I have an HDS7 Gen 1 that I run the Lakemaster LOTW/Rainy chip in and an HDS9 Gen 2 that I run the Navionics Platinum chip in. Overall, the Navionics chip is ok. However, when I compare the two, the Lakemaster chip (flaws and all) is much more detailed than the Navionics chip (in my opinion). Humps, sunken points, and reefs are far more detailed on the Lakemaster chip, where the Navionics chip seems more generalized."
