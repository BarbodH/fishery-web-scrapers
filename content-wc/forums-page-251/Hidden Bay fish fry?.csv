How was the walleyes? I had a Blue and some salmon at home instead. Maybe next year!

4271394,Guest,2015-10-18 21:53:00,0,Hey! We fished with Hidden Bay this past summer. Probably some of the best fishing I have every experienced. We fished on Miniss for 4 days. We rebooked for 2016 before we even paid off our 2015 bill at check out. A great operation they run there at Hidden Bay. They treated us like family. Would not hesitate to recommend!

Thanks to Walleye Direct they fried up 30 lbs of walleyes, plus all the fixens! Like Miniss fishermen we had a group of 3 on Miniss in early Sept. Fantastic fishing, nice cabin, top.of the line customer service! Anyone else!?"
