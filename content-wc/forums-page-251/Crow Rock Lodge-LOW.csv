4298498,Dog,2015-11-02 13:47:00,210,"I have never fished out of Crow Rock but have been to Witch Bay several times. The walleye and smallie fishing is great. We have taken several 30"" + walleyes out of that general area over the years. Witch bay is a great place, they will treat you great and you will probably put on about 10#'s before you leave. Fred"

The smallie fishing was excellent by the way. The lodge is nice, the cabins are small but very nice. Boats were very good...and have GPS lake chip sonar...which I could not imagine not having on LOW! I'd been lost in the first 5 minutes. A little pricey is the only downside."
