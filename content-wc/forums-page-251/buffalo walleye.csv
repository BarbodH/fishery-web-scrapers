Fry fillets in oil.To make Sauce, mix the following in a pot:1 Tablespoon of butter1/4 Cup Olive Oil [or you can use all butter]1 teaspoon each of paprika, cayenne pepper1 teaspoon of chopped garlic1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper1/4 Cup Frank's Hot Sauce or other Cayenne Pepper Sauce1/4 teaspoon of Worcestershire sauceHeat on medium for about 5 minutes, until butter melted and sauce has heated through.Put fillets in a resealable container, add sauce and shake to coat like you would when making chicken wings."

The combination of the rich and slightly sweet Alfredo sauce keeps the buffalo from getting too out of hand.The secret to our receipe is that the walleye fillets must be cut in exact small pieces. We aim for a piece that is around the size of a chicken mc nugget. This will give a ratio of breading, crisp and fillet that reminds you of a buffalo wing.This is a two man operation as one guy needs to prepare the noodles and the Alfredo sauce. I Am the buffalo guy not the Alfredo guy so I don't have his Alfredo receipe but it's a straight up Alfredo sauce that will immediately clog all arteries. If you want what we did for Eddie make it from scratch, but if you want quick buy the premix or the pre-made sauce in the container.While the Alfredo guy is mixing boiling and cooking, the buffalo guy needs to take the mcnugget size walleye fillets, dip in egg or milk(whatever you like) and toss with hooters breading. (I don't think the hooters has anything special about it ....it just puts me in a good frame of mind when I think about wings and beer and ........) anyway, deep fry the walleye and toss in franks red hot buffalo. If you buy the franks red hot you will need to add and melt a little butter in the sauce. The franks buffalo is ready to go and does not need butter. You can jazz up the sauce if you want but I think it's just about the right amount of heat for most folks.Serve the buffalo walleye nuggets on a bed of fettuccine and Alfredo noodles and enjoy."

4290202,Pikeslayer8,2015-10-29 09:46:00,1460,"Lol. I just think it's great that T2's group enjoys a dish such as this with the Alfredo. Sure, I do it with the Blue Cheese Linguine, but unclejoe might just be on to something........ I really like how unclejoe has a clear process to prepare this dish with an Alfredo guy and himself as the Buffalo guy. Spoken like a true Camp Cookie."

In addition another favorite shown on the grill (yes, this recipe was pimped off the board too). Definitely two of my favorites though."
