4286578,LOW1,2015-10-27 08:19:00,2828,"Mike, I would encourage you to consider adding to your magazine articles that are not directly related to fishing. For example, I would think that articles about remote construction projects, mining operations, early outfitters, First Nations, etc would be of interest to many.Also, reprinting well written outdoor stories written decades ago about the area may also be worth considering. Authors like Calvin Rustrum, etc."
4286690,Mike Borger,2015-10-27 09:46:00,1554,"Thanks for the advice, it's a pretty good idea imo. Can't believe you mentioned Calvin Rutstrum though - I've always enjoyed his writing but he's not widely known! It's definitely food for thought and I appreciate it!This board in general has been an incredible resource for me as I really respect most of the opinions. Cheers"
4287170,Fishoil,2015-10-27 14:54:00,1277,"I'll second this thought. I spend a lot of winter evenings googling and reading about the history of the northern Ontario areas that I fish or am interested in fishing. There's lot's of great stories about Hudson Bay Company, early aviation, trapping, native settlements, winter travel, etc. that need to be told to those of us who dream about the great north when we can't be there in person."
4287178,Fishoil,2015-10-27 14:56:00,1277,And now I need to look into that concrete dam too....
4287394,Ogoki,2015-10-27 17:34:00,291,"I have fished Mojikit twice and the Ogoki Res. 12 times and I am booked for next June . Needless to say I am am curious about anything I can find about that water system along with any history of the area above Armstrong . I read someplace that 12% of the water that goes over Niagara Falls comes from the Summit dam . I cannot find where I read that at this time. I actually came across a retired airman that was stationed at the air base at Armstrong . He had some interesting stories about his time at Armstrong. Mike ,I think there are many of us that would enjoy any history that you could add to your magazine . In around 1991 , I actually flew to Mojikit to look at purchasing the site , where Wilderness North has their camp in the channel. The place was a dump and the boats would barely float . The owner of that Land Use Permit quoted me $440,000 for the place . Jack Mark purchased the LUP and basically started over . I have no clue what he paid for it. The guy who owned it went by Greystone Outfitters ."

These days you cant sell a comercial LUP to a private individual anyway, although I think it sometimes happens. (people can always find loopholes)."
4288106,SinOrSwim,2015-10-28 08:52:00,1528,"I know I will be subscribing. The dam question is interesting. Some other things I think would be interesting would the the history of the camps and lakes you write about. The owners, how they got into the biz, and their history of the lakes? Maybe some of their ""fish stories""? We fished at Hawk Lake earlier this year. We had a guide that day and even though the fishing was very slow it was one of the most fun days I've had on the water. We hit spot after spot but the guide was also awesome with telling stories. How many times have I seen a loon on these trips.......but I never knew how far they dive for food. We stopped a couple places and there were pine cones my son grabbed. The guide started telling my son how these trees reproduce and how fire is what opens up the cones to release the seed. The needles fall and get caught in the tree to actually increase the chances it burns hot enough. I really enjoy that you include everything about your trips. The shopping, the flights, the food etc. We have been going up for over 20 years and we don't fish sun up to sun down. It is the whole experience. The food, the shore lunch the different things we have come up with over the years. Walleye chimichangas etc."
4288258,Ogoki,2015-10-28 09:27:00,291,"Mike , At that time I checked with the Ministry and was told I could run that camp commercially as long as a manager or owner was on site . If I was to purchase outposts , I had to have three and a base of operation at Armstrong . I also looked at the camp on the inlet of Whitewater . Actually an outfitter wanted to purchase it and have my wife and I run it . At that time my wife's parents were both alive but in failing health , so we did not want to make the commitment as we knew they would be needing her here at home . After they passed away my, the same year her Dad died , then my Dad starting having serious health issues . So that dream of ours never materialized."
4288402,castnblast,2015-10-28 10:36:00,111,Don't forget about Edwin Mills! Good luck with the venture!

Too bad it didn't work out for you guys, but knowing how tough this business is you might have dodged a bullet! Quote: Originally Posted by castnblastDon't forget about Edwin Mills!Good luck with the venture!Thanks, Edwin Mills is another good one. The one that jumps out to me is the now deceased George Theriault and his fantastic book, Trespassing In God's Country. I reached out to his son a couple months back about printing an excerpt and he was all for it, so stuff like that is already on the agenda."
4281386,Mike Borger,2015-10-23 20:49:00,1554,"Finally found the time to piece together my write up on Mojikit lake with MLO. In a nutshell the camp as expected was super nice. It may be the most ideal spot I've ever seen for an outpost camp.As usual we focused on big pike and although we did get some, the reality was it was a grind!Walleye fishing was ridiculous! We got a handful of bigger fish including one fat 29"" specimen, but the vast majority were thick 16-20"" fish. It was as easy a fishing as any I've experienced! Walleye guys, especially ones looking for fast action would love this lake.Weather was tough to say the least! Lots of strong winds and a fair bit of rain, but we persevered. All in all a very good trip!If you're interested you can read the full write up here along with a large amount of photos and embedded video:http://www.canadafishingguide.net/ex...-mojikit-lake/Cheers"

4281818,Pikeslayer8,2015-10-24 07:08:00,1460,"Just baffling to me, the herculean task of building a concrete dam this remote. Wonder the cost in today's dollars? Great report! Worthy of this new ""Canada Fishing Guide"" magazine we can't wait to see!"
4281922,Mike Borger,2015-10-24 08:52:00,1554,"Thanks Bill! That actually raises a question I've been struggling with. Looking long term any place I travel to will certainly be written about in the magazine, then after the piece is published I'll release a lengthy online report.Short term, meaning any issues of CFG coming out next year, anything I might be able to write about has already been covered in a lengthy online report.I'm wondering whether people might feel cheated if the first two issues or so have stories by me that have already been documented online? Obviously what's published in the mag would be vastly different writing than the online version, but I'm still concerned about it."
4281978,Pikeslayer8,2015-10-24 09:08:00,1460,I think we all understand that there will be a grass roots process here in first development of your publication. It's not like a proper guide would give us good info on waters unfished!
4282010,Mike Borger,2015-10-24 09:18:00,1554,"I'm hoping everyone feels the same, thanks Bill! Obviously I'll have a ton of fresh content from other writers in the first couple of issues as well, so it's just my stuff that's a concern."
4282194,That Minnesota guy,2015-10-24 10:36:00,8293,"I'm so apprehensive each time I read one of your reports. I know there will be BIG PIKE and the thrill of getting them. If your adventures were about nothing but Pike fishing I would be happy, but toss in the bait fish (Walleye) and it makes for a great read. Thank you."
4282202,retire55,2015-10-24 10:37:00,1029,Another great report Mike. Thanks for sharing.
4282210,Mike Borger,2015-10-24 10:43:00,1554,"I'm with you 100%! I have some pike trips on tap for next year that will blow everyone away I think.Quote: Originally Posted by retire55Another great report Mike. Thanks for sharing.Thank you, glad you enjoyed it!"
4286410,chris.brock,2015-10-27 07:18:00,112,Awesome write up Mike. MLO is one of the best outfitters I've experienced.
