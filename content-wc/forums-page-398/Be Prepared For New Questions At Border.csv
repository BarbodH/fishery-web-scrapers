1505002,Terwalleye,2012-11-16 23:40:00,166,Especially to Jay Cutler's TD to Interception ratio.And if we don't bring all that cheese how else do I avoid using the outhouse for days at a time?
1505270,bigvenison,2012-11-18 06:05:00,15,"Anyone, including Canadians, crossing from the US into Canada is allowed to bring per crossing 1 turkey, 44 lbs of chicken, 44 lbs of dog food-- as for milk 44 lbs [about 5 US gals] if total value is $20 or under and the same for CHEESE but I wouldn't worry about anyone getting nasty at the border for a few of this or that over --won't happen --have a great trip"
1505374,zeebee,2012-11-18 15:35:00,1144,In fact our cheese here is pretty good...that Wisconsin profile thingy is home grown.....prob is getting the good stuff in N Ont.
1505433,Tomv,2012-11-18 20:35:00,21,It all has to do with the export and import of natural gas...we don't want Wisconsinites coming up to Canada and cutting the cheese...the government needs to tax you....
1492014,Nimstug,2012-10-01 21:11:00,2605,Our experience at the border this year was quick and professional. But there may be a few more questions in the near future.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/...legations.html
1492016,zeebee,2012-10-01 21:22:00,1144,"Too funny ...we have supply controlled pricing for dairy and a few other commodities here....rationale is to protect the producers. You would think the ""powers"" could be chasing bigger prey. Its those cheeseheads in Wisconsin that represent the biggest threat to our sovereignty...geez for cheese."
1492081,NathanH,2012-10-02 07:47:00,697,I know the next time I go to Canada I plan to purchase some of gas cans and bring them back. The new ones here are the worst. Wonder if they would stop a guy with a bunch of gas cans? Seems everyone is worried about something today.
1492146,Nimstug,2012-10-02 10:13:00,2605,Those north of the cheddar curtain are a threat on MANY levels.
1492162,Blackmacs,2012-10-02 11:09:00,2121,Any Wisconsinites should be screaming profiling!
1492210,@Lunker,2012-10-02 13:42:00,835,"Notice the issue of quality. If it ain't from 'Sconsin, it ain't cheese."
1492238,camp chef,2012-10-02 14:37:00,915,Of course I'm packing cheese.....Never cross the the border without at least 3 varieties and 3 vintages. Cocktail hour would not be the same without some 10 yr old cheddar and a 2 or 3 yr old brick.
1492305,hogridnfool,2012-10-02 18:35:00,349,Aged Brick and Limburger for me.
1493878,Steve of Madison,2012-10-08 19:05:00,230,"Me too! I'm not sure if my camp owner would let me unpack if I din't bring in some aged Cheddar, Colby, and Farmer."
1493991,Medds1,2012-10-09 07:35:00,18,3 day old squeeky colby for this group!
