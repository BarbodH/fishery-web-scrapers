1489452,Golden Eagle,2012-09-24 05:08:00,2642,"tttI suggest taking a better look at zeebee's offer. He's talking about a great fishery, good people and a good time. Plus he's volunteering to share his knowledge of the lake. Betting he's a great guy and a good fisherman, with a lot of energy and eagerness to do well.August is a great time for NW Ontario walleye success.Good luck, zeebee."
1489511,Cash,2012-09-24 09:11:00,73,"I might be interested. I've actually had my eye on that resort for a while. I'll be on Minnetaki at Pickerel Arm Camp the 3rd week of June. I'd have to start working on my wife now. If it starts to come together, send me an email. - Jeff[email protected]"
1489521,camp chef,2012-09-24 09:22:00,915,"Gracious as always,Connie"
1510509,FoxLaRocks,2012-12-05 16:14:00,18,"I am Zeebee's son... The one who caught the 33lb Laker hah.The owners of the lodge are amazing! Super nice folks, that are more than happy to assist in anyway possible. The most beautiful cabins I've ever stayed at on a Fly-in. Boats have Honda motors, quiet and reliable. Massive lake, massive fish, massive fun."
1489301,zeebee,2012-09-23 09:03:00,1144,"What if I were to organize a 1 week (or whatever) fly in trip to a 1st class resort north of Red Lake for next August......a dozen wonderfully equipped cabins for a group or individuals as the case may be. Wives would be cool too.I believe we could get very wallet friendly ""group rates"" and have great walleye/NP/laker fishing. I would set up a boat or two with downriggers for LT.Is this something worth persuing? We could even crown it as the 1st WCWT unsanctioned tourney......will be a hoot.I know I can coordinate such an event...PM me if the idea is of interest to you."
1489307,Golden Eagle,2012-09-23 09:49:00,2642,"No new thoughts here, but how could I benefit from fishing with someone who would want to fish with me?"
1489310,zeebee,2012-09-23 09:58:00,1144,"not sure I undestand the ? ...the lake is so big you can have all the solitude you desire but have a group setting during off fishing hour...you know, that socialize thingy where we sing around the bon fire till someone falls in. all things said I will catch a bigger fish than you will"
1489313,zeebee,2012-09-23 10:07:00,1144,Thinking of this lodge...Ive been going a couple of years....mid August is empty but the fishin is great (think opportunity and good rates).......dozen of walleyes daily if you jig...bigees if you troll cranks. Caught a 46.5 NP this year and a 33lbs laker the year before. The fishing/accomodation/hosts are great. http://www.boois.com/I have no financial/family or otherwise connection to the lodge.....just a woderful place.
1489314,Golden Eagle,2012-09-23 10:09:00,2642,"Sounds good as I've always wanted to see a big fish. What water are you thinking about?I have several friends in Winnipeg, but not sure they know very much about catching walleyes. I usually have to feed them."
1489316,zeebee,2012-09-23 10:19:00,1144,True winnipeggers eat raw polar bear....you claim to know the fishery north of Red Lake........prove it!
1489318,Golden Eagle,2012-09-23 10:26:00,2642,For what reason?
1489319,Golden Eagle,2012-09-23 10:45:00,2642,"A year ago tomorrow my wife and I were riding on Jim's Cessna 185 to drop us off at another lake. Picked us up October 6 for return to Red Lake. Had a ball with Ron at a Nashville, TN All-Canada show many years ago. Good lake. So is Joyce. Good luck with your offer. You'll please some fishermen with a good trip.I'm flying out of Red Lake Thursday morning and will return when I'm ready. Looking forward to Canadian Thanksgiving turkey with friends, hunters and a fisherman or two. Trip will make my life better. One of my Winnipeg friends will probably be around camp while I'm there, since he's originally from Red Lake. He was the only university level basketball player ever produced in Red Lake. Rest are short. Skaters, I guess.Do you know Kim and Derrek, who worked Booi's a few years ago?"
1489341,tackleman,2012-09-23 13:47:00,444,"hey Golden Eagle, i would fish with you. (no fool like an old fool, i guess,)(the fool would be me). maybe you could show me a few things."
1489345,Golden Eagle,2012-09-23 14:23:00,2642,We'd need somebody to help us in and out of the boat.I was playing with zeebee a little. Hope he understands.
