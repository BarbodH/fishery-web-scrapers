1507365,Pikeslayer8,2012-11-26 12:03:00,1460,"Mike, I was totally about glow jigs for many many fishing trips. I had a couple of those charging light thingys on a lanyard around my neck with my line clippers and jig eye buster. I would even try em out late in the evening hoping that they would up my numbers a bit. To tell you the truth I had hopes that they worked better but in all reality, maybe not so much. My favorite color was white but hey, it usually is when it comes to jig heads. Now if you are planning on expanding you jig line, I would be a big proponent of a glow head Road Runner/Capt. Redbeard style jigs."
1507466,BenBeattie,2012-11-26 16:40:00,232,"Glow, white and chartreuse are my 3 fav's. But to be honest, at least half the time it really doesn't seem to matter...black, white, blue, pink... they all work. I think color is more important to anglers than it is to fish. Having said that, I know a couple Lac Seul guides who only use glow!"
1507488,wallydave,2012-11-26 17:40:00,2151,"I have tried some white glow captn redbeard jigs, they seem to have worked. LS has stained waters, and we were fishing during some cloudy days. Those days they seemed to work. I had the jigs in the sunlight a day or two before. Like Ben said, along with others, the colors catch the fisherman, not the fish!!"
1507549,SeulAreaWalleye,2012-11-27 06:02:00,100,That would be me for sure....white glow all the way. Buy them by the hundreds and provide them for my guests to use too!
1507591,Bill Krejca,2012-11-27 08:44:00,6107,"I use glow in waters that are stained, not sure they help much in clear water. I also place a touch of glow on the bottoms of some jigs, just feel it helps, but have not conducted extensive study, etc. I like to use a product called ""Tulip Glow."" It is used for lettering on sweatshirts and such. It drys to a rubbery texture that stays on very well. Different colors are available, but they all come close to the same color in the dark. Sometimes I'll paint the entire head with the stuff. Bill Krejca"
1507865,unclejoe,2012-11-27 21:22:00,22,"We night fished off one of the buoys around Taylor island first week of august. Those of you who fished those weeks know it was lite bite for a period of time. Anyway 3 boats tied off basically deadsticking from 9-12 p.m and one guy (the ""pike fisherman"") out fished us by factor of 5 times. When we got back to the house boat he admitted that he was using glow jigs and he was the only one. It's not scientific but he is not the ""best "" vertical fisherman so something gave him an edge. I believe it was the jig head. Or perhaps he is better than I give him credit for.......in case he is reading this."
1508798,tsquared,2012-11-30 15:37:00,57,"As a matter of fact I am reading this. My recollection is that I outfished him by infinity as he didn't catch any fish. I always use the glow jogs, nobody cared until I skunked them. I am not sure if it was fishing skill, or the fact they were drinking some stew. In all fairness though, he is correct, I am not the best vertical fisherman...."
