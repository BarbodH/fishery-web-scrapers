Conventional leaders suck as their mass impedes the action of lures and I wont compromise the walleye bite just to save a lure. For the upcoming season I picked up two new (to me) leader products that I believe negates many if not all the issues associated with wire ""rope"" type leaders. Both are the same diameter as my 10lbs mono and are tiable...No kidding! TIABLE!!!Its not so much the loss of lure I lament as the loss of that big NP; I am still haunted by memories of big solid hits while trolling for eyes that I know were monster NP's only to have the line go slack as those teethy fish compromised the archilles heel in my tackle. Here are the products...I will file a report down the road but I am optimistic the weak link may have been addressed. http://www.afwhiseas.com/Coated-Knot...x-7-s/2261.htmAND,http://www.tuf-line.com/products_Spe...-Lines_20.htmlGot em in 13lbs and 10 lbs test respectively and man are they thin......same as mono. I truly am excited about this stuff. Let the kids have their latest edition of IPhones ...I dont care cause I got wire leaders as thin as mono. God bless American ingenuity. HAH."

1511997,zeebee,2012-12-10 17:38:00,1144,"Suppose my teeth would look like your high school sweetheart's.Test tied a few knots last night... simple clinch knot, some spit, slow going and turned out perfect. Nail clipper easily handled the tag end."
1512031,2746,2012-12-10 19:49:00,3206,Did you know her too!?
1512062,zeebee,2012-12-10 21:14:00,1144,"Know her.....heck I married her after she told me she wanted to show me a ""little man in the boat"".......thot she was taken me fishin!"
1512450,Skywagon,2012-12-12 05:52:00,1106,Good one!
1512461,bcmss396,2012-12-12 06:42:00,296,Looks like an interesting option.We started tieing all of our Wallye rigs using Fireline (original 20lb) in brown/smoke.We haven't been bit off since we started this practice.Blair
