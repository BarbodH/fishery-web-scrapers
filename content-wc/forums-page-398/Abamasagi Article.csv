1501854,Mike Borger,2012-11-05 16:57:00,1554,"Hey guys, this is certainly not that big a deal, but still I thought I'd share. I recently wrote a short piece on O'Sullivan Lake Outfitters Abamasagi lake camp north of Nakina for Ontario Tourism.It's not a long article, but it's the first time I've actually been published.http://www.northernontario.travel/fi...e-outpost-camp"
1501860,gmattbruin,2012-11-05 17:07:00,174,"good article Mike,short and to the point. Aba has certainly become our favourite fly-in or as you mention with Howard boat-in. Only problem with articles like these there is no more secrets.lol"
1501877,RickOnt,2012-11-05 17:59:00,217,"Hey SoloFantastic, well done! Congrats on the First publishing!Always enjoy your reports.Thanks for taking the time and thanks for posting.Rick"
1502010,lenray,2012-11-06 08:38:00,467,NICE READ AND PICS You have a talent for the written word.
1502066,Larbo,2012-11-06 11:36:00,231,Just love articles about family's catching fish together. Makes me smile and remember where I came from... Thanks Solopaddler
1502095,vteye,2012-11-06 12:35:00,812,Congrats Solo - Glad your reports are getting the deserved attention outside of this and Ontario site. My favorite read is the Sutton rivertrip and hope you someday get paid to do trips...
1502179,5richards,2012-11-06 17:54:00,131,Was that a subtle inference?
1502228,Pikeslayer8,2012-11-06 20:23:00,1460,"Well boys, I think we have seen the first of what should be many more published reports yet to come. Way to go Mike!"
1502247,gmattbruin,2012-11-07 05:11:00,174,"not sure if you ever kept a log or diary of your canoe or fly-ins, maybe a book someday? One of my best reads,ever was when someone gave the story of Dick Proeneke, who built a cabin in the Alaskan interior at around 50yrs of age and basically lived there till in his 80s. Cabin is now in the hands of Alaskan dept of lands&forest. Something about this man makes us wonder if we all have a little of him in us. Yours could be a great read as well!"
1503089,Walleye Wanderer,2012-11-10 07:04:00,101,Congratulations Mike! Keep up the good work and hope to be reading more our your publications soon.Rob
