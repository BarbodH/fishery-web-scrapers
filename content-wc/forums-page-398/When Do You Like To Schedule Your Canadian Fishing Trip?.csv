1505449,zeebee,2012-11-18 22:37:00,1144,Like the last two weeks in August:1) like to troll cranks and thats particularly effective then2) Camps are quiet...fewer guests3) Rates can be up to 40% less4) weather usually great5) do one week with my son and my girlfriend......one week on my own....best of both worlds
1505633,stjoeguy,2012-11-19 15:12:00,979,"We've been to Lake St. Joseph anytime from the last week of May to the first week of July. Mr. Sauger's line about whether you like cold rain or warm rain pretty much sums up the difference in the weeks. I don't think the fishing really changed much. Since we prefer occasional t-shirt days rather than occasional snow flurries, we now go the last week in June."
1505646,Nimstug,2012-11-19 15:45:00,2605,"I like to go in sometime between September 8th and the 23rd, depending on how the weekends are arranged. Usually it's just the son and me. I really enjoy fall fishing and sometimes the colors are spectacular. Most of the time the boat-in camp where we go does not have all thee cabins occupied, and if they are all occupied like this year, they aren't full. There were more hunters than fishers this year.

1505696,zeebee,2012-11-19 18:59:00,1144,Got my worst sunburn in mid august...burn during the day ....sleep well in the coolness of the night. Just gotta change fishin tactics. More sunshine come August as fronts seem less voaltile. Ive found it to be the most rewarding/relaxing time to go fishin. Winds seem to be more behaved.
1505715,3M TA3,2012-11-19 20:08:00,2846,Wow. Canada is a pretty big country. Where are you thinking of going? Lots of bugs in early June. I prefer roughing it and combining bugs and bear together. Lots of fun. June is definitely a great time to do that in North Central Ontario.
1505798,Bearing Man,2012-11-20 08:34:00,30,"Mid-June most years. But we have endured the no-see-ums and hordes of mosqitoes, occasional snow and drastic changes in weather over the years.Last year went about 2-1/2 weeks later, 2nd week of July. Stable weather and warm, actually too hot. Walleyes good early & late in the day but not much good mid-day. Pike were almost non-existant due to heat.No 2 years ever seem exactly the same. I think if you use live bait, warmer temps in summer are o.k. Years when we only had artificial, then June was better, before water temps rose."
1506073,1860Angler,2012-11-21 07:24:00,2642,"June & September for Canada. I save May and October for MN. July and August are family time, tubing and swimming and boating and a little MN fishing."
1507653,Babamel2,2012-11-27 11:53:00,414,I usually schedule them before I leave camp. That way I am assured that I will get the same week and the same cabin. If I need to cancel or change I can. but at least I am scheduled.
1504238,Sportdog,2012-11-14 15:37:00,6735,I'm in the final stage of booking my Canadian fishing trip for next year. What time of the year do you like to go and why? I'm thinking the first two weeks of June but am certainly open to other times. Thanks.
1504269,vteye,2012-11-14 17:45:00,812,"I think you have tradeoffs fishing spring, summer or end of season. Some species will be easier to target during a given season ie shallow water pike first couple weeks after ice out. A family vacation would consider July and August so that you had good swimming etc. We are going last week in May to target pike. Weather will be a consideration. June/July bugs can be fiercious another consideration."
1504273,CSH Kucinski,2012-11-14 17:53:00,1340,"We like to go the second or third week in June due to the fact that the air temp is warmer as well as the water temp. Going earlier than that we have found to be quite challenging for many reasons. Float plane can't flight due to rain and wet snow, cold water and air temp (slow bite if any bite at all)."
1504290,wallydave,2012-11-14 18:52:00,2151,"We used to plan for the first week of June for several reasons. First reason, my boat/cabin buddy's birthday was June 1st, and secondly, we used to be able to fish the ""Santuary"" the Wenasaga River feeding into the NW end of Lac Seulune 1st. Now he is a school teacher, and he takes his family North for trips, so we go to Goose Bay Mid June. Plus the ""Santuary now opens in mid-June so we have been mking the trip a little later.True the weather in June either the first week or mid June can be completely up for grabs! But the fishing can be nothing short of fantastic! To be honest the last couple of mid-June trips the fishing has been tough, and the last couple of years in mid-June the temps have been all over the place. I have never been up North later than early July, a late season trip is being developed with Pikeslayer for 2014. No matter when you go, you are up North!! Away from all of the day to day grind! The best time is when you are North of the border! Each season, early, mid or late has its own pluses and minuses."
1504299,tlars,2012-11-14 19:24:00,137,"Late August through mid September. The walleyes are grouped. It seems like if you catch one you'll be on fish for awhile. Plus, we find fish of similar size grouped together."
1504324,Hawkfan,2012-11-14 20:49:00,237,"Our group is a late season group as well. We have gone mid August, but usually early to mid September. Bugs are usually non-existent, night temps drop to make it nice and cool in the cabins, but still nice out on the water during the day. Fishing is also great and you have the potential to hook into a big one getting ready for winter. Check with outfitters as well, some will give you better rates to get a group in camp later in the year."
1504444,onetimedave,2012-11-15 10:40:00,502,We like to go the last week of May or the first two weeks of June. Both walleye and pike (our targeted fish are very active and easier to catch. Our trips are done via a fly in out of Nakina. The weather can be iffy but we mostly have nice weather and very much enjoy our trip at this time of year.
1504455,Babamel2,2012-11-15 10:54:00,414,"our group has often preferred to go late August as by then the days are a bit cooler. We have gone in June, when we experienced cold weather and rain. Now that it is just the wife and I we prefer cooler days, even if the fishing may not be the ""Prime"" time."
1504501,Bigstorm,2012-11-15 12:07:00,799,"When we started going about 8yrs ago, we went at the end of July for the 1st 4 years. After that, we moved it up to the 3rd week in June for the next 4 years thinking that the fishing would get even better plus having a better shot a wallhanger.After 4 years of fishing in June, we are now switching back to late July. The fishing didnt seem any better going 4-5 weeks earlier, we never got a wallhanger and the weather seems to be more stable in July.We did do a 2nd trip in early September last year, fishing was pretty tough because the water level was 6ft lower than it was 8 weeks earlier in the 3rd week of June"
1504550,Guest,2012-11-15 14:18:00,0,"Late June or early July is my favorite. -weather is nice, also stable -fish are in 6-16 fow - easier to find -long days=more fishin time on the water We asked our outfitter if June or July was better. He replied: do you like cold rain or warm rain?"
