1518909,JLDII,2013-01-02 12:25:00,4128,Alabama's O line is going to dominate this game. They are so good Aaron Rogers wishes he played behind them in Green Bay!
1518912,CSH Kucinski,2013-01-02 12:38:00,1340,I hope ND wins. Should be a good defensive battle though.
1518926,Freedom1955,2013-01-02 13:14:00,331,I don't know enough about either team but I'm pulling for ND.
1518934,grasshopper armory,2013-01-02 13:44:00,320,the people that sell the trinkets and the t- shirts win
1518940,nitecrawler128,2013-01-02 14:10:00,264,"Alabama wins 24-20. Notre Dame has a great team, but Bama's SEC schedule has them toughened up to pull this one out!"
1511104,zummy,2012-12-07 14:59:00,821,"Every time I see that commercial that says ""Most of us will go professional in something other than sports"" it makes me ill. How many of these guys are out therehttp://chronicle.com/article/The-Edu...asmine/132065/Oh yeah Bama by 17"
1511134,Guest,2012-12-07 16:30:00,0,"Both ND and Alabama are the big ""money"" programs. There is nothing that takes place in the SEC that does not take place at ND. Curious why they are all of a sudden relevant againHowever the tide will destroy ND, the actually national championship game took place last week. TT"
1511141,PeterB,2012-12-07 17:00:00,153,"Let's seee now, let me guess BullDogs Vs. Bama ?BD down the field late .. Could not get it innnnn. ROLL~TIDE ROLL~TIDE Oregon deserves some recognition to mo, as they're where bullwhipping everyone else pretty good. Other then that loss to the Tree. Ducks deserve consideration as National contenders no? YeahBaby ROLL~TIDE"
1511235,onetimedave,2012-12-08 06:12:00,502,I like whomever beats Yoder Dame and whomever beats Alabama.
1511412,Justfishing,2012-12-08 17:06:00,1571,I think that article show more about his upbringing prior to college. His family failed to insure that he learned to read and the local schools must not have done much to help. At least in college he has made some progress but he will not get a degree. Like the counselor said you cant make someone care. It boils down to someone taking advantage of the opportunities and clearly he didnt. The problem is that there are people having kids that arent willing to be parents and its only gotten worse.
1511429,zeebee,2012-12-08 17:59:00,1144,Im taken bama by 7. ND has Manti Te'o. He's a Mormon and they aint winning much these days.
1512311,lcwhit,2012-12-11 15:38:00,104,i think the national championship game was alabama-georgia a few weeks back.
1518829,LOW1,2013-01-02 09:10:00,2828,Any more votes?
1518838,bigdaddyguns,2013-01-02 09:33:00,608,I like Alabama 34 - 17
1518870,Buck Snort,2013-01-02 10:44:00,1484,Alabama will win in an absolute blowout. I hope not though. I really like ND and wish them the best in their shot at the title.

1511058,JLDII,2012-12-07 12:38:00,4128,"Alabama has too much team speed on both sides of the ball for ND to win. I really hope they prove me wrong and send Saban home with his head hung down, but I just don't see it."
1511061,patroller,2012-12-07 12:48:00,318,"Alabama...Tough schedule, tough conference, experience all on their side."

1511066,2746,2012-12-07 13:06:00,3206,My heart says ND my head says Alabama.
1511067,karpbuster,2012-12-07 13:07:00,6629,I say tie.
1511072,dutchboy,2012-12-07 13:27:00,5717,"Luv 'em or hate 'em, Saban can coach. Give him this long to get ready and he is tough to beat.I don't know what to make of Notre Dame, I think Kelly has them on the right track but I'm having a tough time gaging how tough their schedule was.Put a gun to my head and I would pick...............LSU."
1511086,Mr.Seaguar,2012-12-07 14:22:00,1174,Saban has assembled the best team money can buy. The NCAA has no salary cap. Everything is easier when you just dont care.
1511097,dutchboy,2012-12-07 14:49:00,5717,"Umm, ever think the NCAA doesn't care because of the amount of money these schools bring them? (not just Alabama either)Every year these super power coaches do their job. They suspend some poor kid for the bowl game so the NCAA can flaunt their concerns for academics. The NCAA is more transparent then the wardrobe of Victoria's Secrete."
1511101,Mr.Seaguar,2012-12-07 14:55:00,1174,I know thats why the NCAA doesnt care. Its all about the dollar. Sad
