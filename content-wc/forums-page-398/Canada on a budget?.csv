1509429,Cut a deal,2012-12-02 19:19:00,38,"Of course you don't Gord your a operator aren't you ? For one sec forget my little over priced flights and weight limits. I believe that all lakes-crown land should be open for First nations people-all Canadians and all our American friends to fish and nothing should be for operators only. You have a problem with that statement ? I believe that as long as you follow the fishing rules if you can get there by access road -logging road -plane-ATV-Snow Buggy -limo or pogo stick you should be allowed to pitch a tent and fish on crown land everywhere with no special rules for operators. You know exactly whats going on in Chapleau, Wawa and Timmins. Locals don't like it when the lakes they have fished for years have roads blocked by the MNR and special treatment for fly in operators. So next time one of your fly in friends has superimposed a map of Ontario that make in look like the fly in is 3/4 of the way to Hudsons Bay instead of the actual 12 min flight from base and a bunch of locals have found a way in deal with it.Bill close as I can tell 95 gal and burns 91 litres a hour with a 4 hour limit and a 2100 lb payload."
1509449,v-bay gord,2012-12-02 21:00:00,3168,"Like I said ""cut a deal"" has an agenda.....and by the way I am an Ontario resident as well. I won't validate your viewpoint by getting into a discussion on it. All lakes in Ontario are accessable to anyone willing to make the effort."
1509493,Skywagon,2012-12-03 07:20:00,1106,"Cut a deal,You don't have a clue. To start with, airplane empty weight is figured without fuel, avgas weighs 6.4 pounds per gallon, you have to have enough fuel in the plane to fly the mission + at least a half hour reserve. Do the math; the weight of fuel detracts from the payload. Second, have you researched what the price of these planes is? Interest on investment, operating costs, including costly required commercial inspections, ongoing maintenance, insurance, $7.00 a gallon avgas, pilot wages. Since you have not thought this out very well, it probably did not occur to you that the fishing-tourist season is short in Canada, the farther north the shorter the season, this holds true for most of the fly-in operators as well as the lodges (maybe 3 months to make a year's wages). These business's need to make enough money to cover expenses and hopefully make a profit, I don't know of any of the plane operators or camp owners getting rich, most are barely making a living, unlike the US Government, they cannot operate at a deficit and just print more money to keep operating. The fly-in fishing here has been good because these lakes are not very accessible and have had limited boat cache permits issued, opening up roads to these places would not enhance the fishing. There are plenty of lakes available by logging roads if one wants to go to the effort of getting to them, the handful you are talking about amounts to nothing. If it really bothers you, buy a plane and fly yourself, there a no restrictions on that and according to you, the real cost of flying must be very little. If you don't like the rules here, go to Alaska fishing, I am sure the cost of a fly-in trip there would be a bargain."
1509494,Guest,2012-12-03 07:28:00,0,"Not to add fuel to the fire but, I remember when these residents a few years back, had their arms in the air complaining about first nations being allowed to hunt in the Chapleau Crown Game Preserve. Everyone was crying let the first nations hunt their traditional ways. (Canoe, bow and arrow, and walking)(No rifles no guns no vehicles or boats and motors.) In my opinion you can't have it both ways. As a local resident, without names, I think everyone should know some of these very people are also pushing their own agenda. Another point, some of these access roads put in by logging companies are put in for the sole purpose of extracting logs for the mill. If the road were never there, SOME (only saying some) of those lakes would never have been accessed with ease. Again, in my opinion, their agenda over road access puts jobs at risk at the local mills. Remember the roads are how logs keep jobs. If pushed too hard jobs could be affected with restricted areas. This COULD be other results with their unintended agenda. I'm not saying this is their main agenda but this could happen in the future for access roads. Not all results are the intended results of some groups main actions. Just remember enjoy what we have now, that way EVERYONE has something. JOBS from all sides!"
1509503,Guest,2012-12-03 08:03:00,0,"Another point of view. The communities of northern Ontario have a fragile economy. Whether it's big companies (logging, mining, or railroad) Government (MNR, OPP, or Town) local small businesses and tourist operators all keep and bring jobs in the area. Take one of those away and the rest will suffer. Loosing just a couple jobs is not good for any northern town. The economies are too fragile and dependent on each other. Remember, all jobs are equally important. After reading more of the above posts, tourist operators do add to these economies and support jobs. Maybe their dollars are not as many as the big employers of the area but a job is a job and even their money helps keeps the community afloat."
1509527,bruiser,2012-12-03 08:40:00,274,I agree 100%. We stayed there. Fishing was tough because we had a major blow all week (lake gets really mirky) but the people were awesome!!!!
1508501,Cut a deal,2012-11-29 17:53:00,38,Flights to the north are a outrageous ripoff. Say you wanted to catch some char take the family do some sightseeing maybe a musk ox or two. 2 adults 2 children 3 hour flight from Ottawa to Iqaluit about a 1200 miles. How does $7152.28 grab you ? Same 3 hour flight O'hare to LAX about $300 and change return .You could fly the whole family and grandma on a 20 hour flight to Austrailia cheaper to catch some southern walleye. There is little competition you are stuck with First Air-Canadian North and a bit of AC.Throw in lodging and a couple of $80 pizzas and your out 12 grand for a week. They are not flying props but Boeing 737-200 which is a 60 seat plane almost daily.2 Adults: 3247.60 + 2 Children: 2944.84 + fees and taxes (base fare includes surcharges): 959.84 = 7152.28 CAD
1508682,turtle chain,2012-11-30 10:13:00,1398,I totally agree you can get good fishing all over the mid west and not pay for the flight!!! Canada is great I love it but at a price?? most Fly ins have small walleye the great lake's have huge walleye at half the cost . I love your country not your $$$$$$$$$$ for every little thing
1508699,Cut a deal,2012-11-30 11:19:00,38,Here is another. You and your buds save up for trip of a lifetime Plummers Lodge $4995 all expenses to catch a lake trout the size of a Buick. Not so fast Plummers pick up point is Yellowknife NWT . You gotta get there at your cost . Say you live in Dallas and you need a flight from DFW to Calgary to Yellowknife return plus couple days hotel at your cost .Well add another couple grand per person your up to $7000 each.http://www.plummerslodges.com/plan-your-trip
1508733,Cut a deal,2012-11-30 12:36:00,38,"One more weight limits on fly in which is also a total rip off. Beaver floatplane I also have stats on Otter and Cessna . The Beaver is 3000 lb empty 5100 lb loaded. So you have 2100 lb to play with the pilot weighs 200 lb so were down to 1900 lb. Me and my 3 friends are jockeys we weighs 100 lbs each. So we should be able to bring 20 cases of beer and half a cow. Now Billys and 3 friends are Bears fans they weigh 350 lbs each so they only have room for a box of twinkies. If you divide 2100 by 7 you get 300 lbs each no ? So fly in trips should ask you how much you and your friends weigh.General CharacteristicsCrew: one pilot Capacity: 7 passengers Length: 9.22 m (30 ft 3 in) Wingspan: 14.63 m (48 ft 0 in) Height: 2.74 m (9 ft 0 in) Wing area: 250 ft² (23.2 m²) Empty: 3,000 lb (1,360 kg) Loaded: 5,100 lb (2,310 kg)"

1506682,Guest,2012-11-23 14:58:00,0,"My advice would be to narrow your selections of lakes down to 4-5, then look for a private party to rent a cabin from. Our group has done this on many trips (Rainy, Dogtooth, etc..) And have found great cabins for $1100-$1300/week. Split amongst 6 guys that is very cheap! There are plenty of sites to find these cabins on the web. Plus, we have found the owners to be very friendly and much more private than any drive in resort."

1507023,dogrodder,2012-11-25 07:52:00,400,"As stated, find a drive to camp. Flying is expensive. Forget an American plan if you are watching your money. Do your own cooking. Many camps offer tenting if you really need to conserve money. Attend one of the many All Canada Shows and ask around for what you are shopping for. Put a group together that you can get along with and you'll come in way below 1000.00 per person. If you really want to rough it. Bring your own boat from home and tent camp in the bush. You'll need a permit. Check with the MNR. I know a group that does this and they get the trip done for under 500.00 per person."

The 16 and under free is what convinced me I had to give the place a try. Got to fish several different lakes in the area and plan to go back next year. Our biggest expense was gas.

Paying down college loans for 2 of my sons.We have gone with several outfitters over 20 + yrs., both pitching tents & cabins. Total, costs, inluding travel, groceries, beer, etc. have ranged from $1000 for a short flight, camping trip to nearly $3,000 for a cabin trip. Never have driven into the site.Any one have suggestions on a budget-minded drive-in or cheap fly-in? Tent-camping, maybe to keep the cost down. We would still need to rent boats. And of course, want good fishing.Thanks."

1506051,MrSimon,2012-11-21 06:20:00,922,"You can easily have a week long trip including travel, boat rentals, and all other expenses for $800 per person. There are a TON of lodges in Canada that offer solid fishing and good accommodations for budget minded anglers. Drive-in outposts are often a great idea and many times rent at a fixed cost for the week ... meaning the more people you bring, the lower the per person cost is. We spend a week this summer at Happy Day Lodge on Lake Windermere and the total cost was just a bit over $800 per person. We stayed at the Outpost and rented two of their nicest boats. For us, we've found 6 people to be the perfect number. We can all fit in a large SUV or minivan and split travel costs six ways. It puts three people per boat which keeps rental costs down, and if the cabin is per week, BINGO, cheap trip. In our non-Canada years, we go The Log Cabins in upstate New York on Black Lake and get travel, three days of fishing, boats, food, etc etc etc for $300 per person. Its a steal!"
1506070,MN_Moose,2012-11-21 07:20:00,964,Sunnyside Camp near Kenora on the Winnipeg river is one of the most economical camps I've been to. Drawback is the tough keep regulations on the Winnipeg River. Easy to get to.http://www.sunnysidecamp.ca/cabin_rates.htm

1506086,MrSimon,2012-11-21 07:54:00,922,"We didn't catch any monsters .... but that's mostly because we don't target them. We are more about numbers and exploring the lakes than specifically targeting lunkers. I have a trip report on here somewhere about our trip, but in short, we LOVED it there. I can't say enough good things about Happy Day .... and especially their outpost cabin. Check the website - lots of good info. Our biggest walleye was 24"", biggest pike was 31"", and biggest smallie was 21"" We kept cost down by really thinking out our menu and preparing a lot of things ahead of time. We all went in one vehicle, which helps a lot too."
