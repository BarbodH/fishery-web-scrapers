But I am wondering about the stay options. I think the Algonquin park lodges are a bit confusing to choose. Recently I got recommendations of Killarney lodge and Bartlett lodge. Which one is preferable? If anyone of you knows about this place, please let me know which the best is."

There are plenty of cottage resorts along Highway 60 heading into the park from the south and the west (in Whitney). I usually just stay at a hotel in Huntsville when I go up there, but I just hike in, fish and hike out. So, I guess it depends on what you're planning to accomplish on your vacation. If you're looking for more five star type accommodations, I heard the the Couples Resort in Whitney is nice."
