1512321,Mr Ranger,2012-12-11 16:04:00,272,We were on Mink a number of years back. Loved how remote it was (Except for the visit on Friday from the OMF ) Great outfiter and caught a ton of fish. Lots of number but little short on the big girls which did not matter. Fun lake. Surprised at how shallow it was. Think the deepest is only 20 feet or so. Enjoy
