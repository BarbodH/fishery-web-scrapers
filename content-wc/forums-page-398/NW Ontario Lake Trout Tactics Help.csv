1508031,Sportdog,2012-11-28 12:13:00,6735,"I've done my share of fishing Lake Trout in Lake Michigan. My normal way of fishing for them is to fish close to the bottom, usually from 40-60 FOW with downriggers. Here on the sunrise side of the lake we have a very gradual slopping sand bottom so snags are not a major issue. I think that way of fishing would be a receipe for disaster on those Canadian lakes so my question, ""What are some of the tactics and tips that you guys use for targeting Lake Trout in those Canadian lakes?"" I have a good supply of trolling spoons, larger minnow baits, and cowbell rigs. Thanks for any information and tips."

1508056,Mohleye,2012-11-28 13:45:00,368,"That's some really good information, and the ""jigging for lake trout"" section is really all you'd need to know on most NWO trout water. I've done a lot of trolling, but have gone to almost exclusive jigging, just because I find it much more enjoyable. You can still cover plenty of water either by drifting if there's a breeze, or bumping the motor in gear every now and then."
1508088,zeebee,2012-11-28 15:50:00,1144,"I have downrigged in Cdn lakes for the past 30 years and in that time rarely picked up a jig outfit.....not that the latter doesnt catch fish but for me, not nearly with the consistency or average size a rigger offers. Nor, during that time have I ever snagged a cannonball....just keep an eye on the depth and maybe run over unfamiliar waters to determine changes in bottom relief. This is also a good time to be ""marking fish""...if Im not marking, I move on. Talk to the locals to determine where the deeper and productive pools are. Lakers, it seems to me, are a little more predictable than some other species.I like to focus on lakers beginning in Aug when they tend to concentrate in the deeper pools and are 60-75' down usually over much deeper water (100+). I also, for the past few years have used just one spoon...a large size (1 1/8 0z...4 7/8"")Len Thompson in fire tiger (platinum series). It consistently outfished, by a large margin, every other spoon/plug I threw at them in every body of water so that now I dont even carry any other spoons and Ive yet to regret that decision. Lakers in the larger waters can exceed 30 lbs but I run clear 10 lbs mono and have never had a breakoff. The spoons are run clean....never found the need for cowbell type hardware.Good drags are a must. I troll only fast enought to impart a nice wobble to the spoon but do vary the path, occasionally cutting an ""S"" pattern to slow and speed up the spoon. For me, mid day lakers are a great diversion from the morning and evening walleye hunt in addition to tasting great when butterflied, stuffed and baked. Have fun and feel free to PM me if I can further help. Below is a link to the Len Thompson home page:http://www.lenthompson.com/charts.html"
1508269,Mohleye,2012-11-29 07:44:00,368,"Zeebee, you raise a good point....when I think of the bigger trout I've caught over the years, most of them were caught while running downriggers. I guess I've gone to jigging mostly due to the fact that I enjoy it more, and I can tie a heavier jig on and be trout fishing in a minute or two while out walleye fishing. Mostly we are just looking to spend a couple hours at it, and we are fishing out of camp boats, meaning portable downriggers."
1508476,rdbalmer,2012-11-29 17:07:00,279,"I haven't used downriggers myself but friends of mine have and it does work really well. I don't have them on my boat so I usually jig for them. I generally use a 11/2 oz. or 17/8 oz bucktail jig, usually either white or chartreuse or a combination of both. We drop them all the way to the bottom and then crank them up, giving them a big jig every so often. Reel them all the way to the surface each time. You will be surprised at the number of trout that will grab your bait very near the surface. We do this in water as deep as 125 feet. It does definately help to have good electronics to help see the schools of bait as well as the individual trout. Another method we use is to tie a 2 oz. bead chain sinker on your main line, tie a 4' leader on and use a crank bait to insted of a jig. Fish it the same as the jig, drop to the bottom, start cranking, jigging occasionally. One of our best baits is a hot n tot. There again white or chartreuse. I think feeling the initial strike is the most impressive part of fishing lake trout, the fight is great too, but that is one reason I haven't invested in down riggers yet. Maybe some day. Just a little different twist on a great way to have fun. Good Luck, Rob"
