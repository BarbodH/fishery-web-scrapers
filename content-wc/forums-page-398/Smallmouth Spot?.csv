1502594,Guest,2012-11-08 09:42:00,0,There are so many crazy smallmouth lakes in manitoba and NW Ontario that a fly in would just be a waste of $$. I would stay to smaller lakes as they are so much easier to fish and easily can get 100+ fish a day. Also you do not have to be on a large body of water for Sm bass unlike walleye and Pike. I would be fishing Nopiming provincial park in MB and some smaller lakes just over the border into Ontario and a few up the Minaki road like Catastrophy.
1503523,TroyMansfield,2012-11-12 07:05:00,92,"little vermillion is pretty awesome for smallies, youll def catch lots there, you can also go to big vermillion which is the upper basin to little vermillion, you would have to trailer your lake around to get to the other landing and that has awesome smallie action too. with good muskies and pike too. you could also hire a local guide to take you up on Lac Seul or Minnitaki lake, you wont get the numbers there like the vermilions, but you will get bigger smallies and any where from 45 to 90 smallies a day upwards of 20 inch mark. but you will prolly need a guide to find them and to avoid rocks on these lakes and to navigate it. the vermillions water is ""Gin clear"" and you can see rocks coming before you get close to them, just gotta keep your eyes peeled, big vermillion has amazing lake trout too, you can easily catch a pile of them if you try. no oraganic bait though on Big Vermillion so you know. good lucl on your search"
1504559,Hawker,2012-11-15 14:41:00,3967,"A RESOUNDING second to Kiskutena last of May or first of June!! Have been in there a dozen times in as many years and every time is just as amazing as before. There are about a dozen, maybe less fly in camps on the lake, but have never seen but one or two other boats on the water. Have caught more than a few smallies over 21"" and a ton in the 19-20"" size. Muskies are thick on Kish too, but not in season when we go, but are a hoot to CPR when using smallie tackle. We use Young's Wilderness Camp as they have an outpost cabin there with excellent accommodations! (http://www.youngswildernesscamp.com/outpost.htm)"
1501201,gordy28,2012-11-03 05:48:00,437,Check out Lauzon Aviation and Hastie lakeFly in Lake for smallmouth and largemouth. I have no personal experience with the lake but have watched a few Fish N Canada shows filmed on the lake
1501399,shadrac,2012-11-04 06:07:00,20,Thank you to all who replied and to the PM's. Your responses have given my group some great suggestions. One of the group is dying to go to BeauchÃªne in Quebec. I think its a little too pricy but-we will see- and I will report back on our trip. thanks againShadrac
1501498,lassh,2012-11-04 11:28:00,553,"Berry Lake with True North outfitters has very good smallmouth fishing. Chuck Mossbeck flys out of Clearwater Lake near Emo, within an hour of International Falls."
1501713,MrSimon,2012-11-05 09:15:00,922,"I went to Happy Day Lodge on Windermere lake this summer for the last week of August. We caught a ton of smallies. They were big. They were aggressive. The lodge, location, water were perfect. I can't say enough good things. Their bush lakes were pretty much a smallie fisherman's dream come true. We all caught multiple 18"" fish and even a few 20"". A 15"" fish was a small one. We caught them on topwater, spinners, trolling, spoons, and crankbaits."
1501744,elkman99,2012-11-05 11:53:00,180,"Without a doubt, you need to checkout Pipestone Lake near Emo, Ont. Stay at either Pipestone Lodge, or Cedar Island Lodge. Check out Jamie at www.customfish.com for a reference and pictures of his past pipestone trips."
1501802,Mike Kansas,2012-11-05 14:11:00,1463,"Been fishing Lac Seul for 30 years and the Smallmouth population has really boomed the last 10 years. Our first trip every June is during the second week of June and when we fish Smallies we literally catch them all day. Lots of 17"" to 20"" fish. They are still bedded at this time and soft plastics, small cranks, spinner baits and surface poppers all work well. If I can be of any help to you email me. Mike Kansas[email protected]"
1501836,Hillbiehle,2012-11-05 15:54:00,66,"If I had to pick one place for Smallies....it'd have to be Lac La Croix. It's remote, but not Canada Remote. However the closer distance can make it very appealing for some."
1501894,joeman79,2012-11-05 19:11:00,417,Big North Lodge out of Minaki has a Fly Out Lake called Roger Lake and it has Awesome Smallie fishing.
1501920,nwont,2012-11-05 20:04:00,16,"Cordingley Lake. A lot of you have probably flown out of it flying out from Nakina. The tournament guys pull huge bags out in the local tournament, I'm thinking 19lb daily bags. I know you can easily catch a 17-18 inch average. Its not big unless your in the 21-23 range. There are more 3lb smallies than you can believe. My largest from there is just over 23, and have no idea how many over 20, way to many to keep track of."
1501922,zeebee,2012-11-05 20:19:00,1144,"Ummm, if in Canada...Provincial Campground.... not too many states here."
1500701,shadrac,2012-11-01 16:50:00,20,If you could pick a Canadian lake or camp with most of your fishing energy going to smallmouth bass - where would it be and when?
1500711,MidWestFishman,2012-11-01 17:19:00,44,I would pick Hawk Lake Lodge. I have been there twice- in the first week of September and the first week of July and did great both times. Catching a 17 inch smallmouth there is almost aneveryday occurance for every person there and many catch 19-20 inch bass during the week. When the top water action gets going it is a blast to see them jumping all over the tiny torpedos I was fishing with. Every night back at the lodge everyone gets together and it is usually the same story from all- great fishing!
1500723,Rich B,2012-11-01 18:05:00,1081,"IF you gave us some idea of where you'd like to fish (i.e. eastern/mid/western Ontario) or other provinces, a lot of the folks here could share good Bass lakes and camps with you. As well, are you looking for a fly-in, drive-in or boat-in location ? What about costs ? There are outstanding lodges with great SM Bass fishing, as well as more modest drive-in camps with both an American Plan or cabin rentals....and for you to get good information for the type of lake/camp worth fishing for SM Bass, provide a few more details and I'm sure you'll get plenty of good suggestions. Good luck with your search. Rich B"
1500775,shadrac,2012-11-01 20:04:00,20,"Hi Rich- I guess I was too broad in my question. Where in Canada- anywhere from Winnipeg to western Quebec. Drive-in is preferred because we would like to use our boat. Having said that - if the best lakes require fly-in -then so be it. I fish with a couple buddies and when we talked about this we figured we would drive to the Kenora area (about 20 hours from home in Ohio.) Costs- mid-range and up. This trip will be next year and have already started to save for it. The 2 guys I fish with are fine with fairly modest accommodations, or if the fishing is good- paying more is fine too. We looked into a Boundary Waters trip but my one friend ""can't do canoes for that long."" thanks againShadrac"
1500855,dhottle,2012-11-02 06:57:00,163,If you don't want one of the great lakes try lake simcoe. Great numbers & quality size similar to erie & lake st clair.
1500870,Larry Mac,2012-11-02 07:28:00,530,"Hi shadrac, based upon our own experiences we would pick Cedar Lake in Perrault Falls Ontario or Crow Duck Lake in Whiteshell Provincial Park in Manitoba. We would fish both lakes in the spring. Have a great year!!!Thank you Larry Mac"
1500885,LOW1,2012-11-02 08:03:00,2828,My favorite place to catch SMB is off our dock or from a kayak on Lake of the Woods.
1500897,Jimmy Jig,2012-11-02 08:17:00,1905,Little Vermillion Lake south of Sioux Lookout. One camp on the lake and a state camp grounds with good ramps. Great SM Bass and Muskys. No walleyes gin clearwater and the lake is deep.
1500928,dkrusin,2012-11-02 09:13:00,97,Years ago we did a flyin with Wilderness Air out of Vermillion Bay to a lake called Campfire. Never caught so many large smallies. It was a catch and release lake so I assume it is still good.
1500995,Fisherman Ted,2012-11-02 11:30:00,461,I just sent you a private message. Fisherman Ted
