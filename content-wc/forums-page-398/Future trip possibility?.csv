1504608,unclepaully,2012-11-15 18:21:00,112,Has anyone fished with Jackson's Lodges & Outposts in Manitoba? I was looking at their site and I thought the outposts looked great along with some promising bodies of water. http://www.jacksonslodge.com/index.html

1504696,zeebee,2012-11-16 06:10:00,1144,"A buddy and our two sons fished Bradburn Lake bout 10 years ago in mid August. Lots of walleye of good size including a 29"" caught by my son. Jigging produced lots of numbers as action was literally constant with salted minnows. You can easily hit triple digits per person per day.The bigger eyes came on cranks in silver and gold finishes; I distinctly remember the bright colors (parrot) produced far less. The water is quite stained.There is a small creek entering the river system on the north side as you approach the Ont border and, running parallel to the weeds you will find a narrow channel that is quite a bit deeper than the surrounding bed.....its loaded with eyes.Lots of northern too as I remember starting to run outta cranks by the end of the week due to bite offs.....take leaders. Easy river to navigate, accomodations were good. Highlite was watching a massive bull moose swim the river not 75 yds from the boat. Their (Jackson's) territory covers some of the best walleye water in the country so I cant see you being dissapointed."
1504763,Larry S,2012-11-16 09:14:00,665,I fished Amphiban lake in 1998 & 1999. It is a nice lake for both walleye & pike. At this time the cost wasn't very high$ 1400 a week for a full service lodge. Also the camp had great people Pete & Geri Czorny running it. This was before Jackson's bought this camp.As I said the fishing was excellent for size and numbers of pike & walleye Larry S
1504871,unclepaully,2012-11-16 13:40:00,112,"Thanks guys. Zeebee, Bradburn was one of the lakes that caught my eye. I really like the location of the cabin being on an island. Good to hear that the fishing equals the amenities. Looks like some of the outpost even have indoor toilets. The other lakes I was looking at were Artery, Eardley, and Whiskey Jack. From what I can tell, looks like pretty good size bodies of water with good flow coming in. I would think most of their lakes would produce both good numbers along with quality size."
1504888,wallydave,2012-11-16 14:25:00,2151,"I checked the website, the operation looks very nice!! Just for grins I Googled the directions, from my front door it would be a 16hr drive to the airbase! Not to bad, thats about average for my drive in lake!! Now by ""bucket list"" just got one lake longer!!"
1504916,zeebee,2012-11-16 16:15:00,1144,"The fishing exceeded the amenities which in themselves were quite fine for a fly-in. Yes the island provided some comfort from wandering wildlife. As I recall, we boated the gut pail to the mainland where the eagles would then feast. Ive fished quite a few lakes in that Bloodvein watershed and the walleye/NP is superb. The waters get far less pressure then those in NW Ont. I certainly would return without hesitation although I seem to favour larger bodies of water for extended stays if for no other reason than variety."
