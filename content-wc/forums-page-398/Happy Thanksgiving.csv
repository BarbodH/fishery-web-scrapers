1506353,zeebee,2012-11-22 07:09:00,1144,Not Thanksgiving north of the border but nevertheless wish all you americans a great day with family and friends.
1506383,2746,2012-11-22 08:44:00,3206,Anything similar in your national holidays?
1506387,v-bay gord,2012-11-22 08:53:00,3168,Our Thanksgiving is in early October.......maybe due to earlier harvests in the Great White North......or perhaps our metric calendar.
1506418,Golden Eagle,2012-11-22 11:17:00,2642,"I would have doubled up this year, but the October 5 snow encouraged me to head home the next day. Travel was tough in the Red Lake area."
1506548,Skywagon,2012-11-23 06:49:00,1106,"Business as usual on this side of the border, but I did eat way to much for lunch yesterday, (in sympathy with the rest of you). I missed the first one too Connie, as well as the opener of moose season."
