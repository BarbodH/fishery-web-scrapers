Looking for fly-in, in nakina area, or anywhere in that direction coming from the soo. Good fishing and good equipment most important..... And outfitter of course....accommodations secondary. Not sure how late in year fishing season is....looking at 1st-2nd week in sept.... Thanks in advance for any info.."
3996698,dog2,2015-06-24 20:42:00,198,I know that Remi has several openings at Kayedon and one or two @Melchett.good luck

I am pretty sure Bear is open by then, so you are likely to be competing for cabins with hunters that time of year. I believe Moose opens Sept. 19th. I assume you are thinking Walleye and Northern. Brad is a great outfitter out of Nakina and can set you up with some nice options if he has some openings. www.nakinaoutpostcamps.com"

Looking at going with them again, to another lake.......was just looking to see if anyone had any other suggestions. Always open to new ideas."
4001266,vteye,2015-06-26 10:30:00,812,Kayedon - just fished it see my recent post but I also hear the water levels can be really low in late summer. I fished Kayedon 2 years at seasonal water levels and was difficult. I have no interest in fishing Kayedon at low water levels you will spend the entire trip rock dodging.. Suggest asking the outfitters about water level on any lake being recommended.
