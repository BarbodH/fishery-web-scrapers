3995146,Carnhzkr,2015-06-24 10:16:00,964,"Funny, I also ran my rainsuit through the washing machine using Nikwax, after having seen the recommendation on WC. It's yet to be seen if it'll help with the repellency, but it definitely looks and smells great right now."
3999322,man164,2015-06-25 17:24:00,693,"Mark R do you have bibs or just pants? I used to have the same problem with the pants I had, went to bibs and no more problems. I think it was more from gettingup and down than water getting through the pants. I bought a set of Bass Pro bibs and they work great.....pricey, but keep me dry."
3991194,Bob_Loblaw,2015-06-23 07:38:00,109,"I bought a Frabill suit like that this spring, and it's as good as advertised. I typically am NOT a fan of Frabill products, but bought on a recommendation from a friend. It's awesome. I've fished in a couple of downpours this year, and stayed really dry. Highly recommended."
3991314,Bill Krejca,2015-06-23 07:51:00,6107,"Yup,that's it! Bill"
3991330,Bill Krejca,2015-06-23 07:59:00,6107,"Right on! This works really well, on the occasions that I can get someone else to run the electric up front. Even with I-pilot, it is much more efficient fishing-wise to run the motor while sitting by it, and watching the depth finder. Plus shifting weight towards the back makes the now higher bow more susceptible to wind gusts. Bill"
3992058,cuamb,2015-06-23 11:12:00,203,I have experienced the wet front with multiple gore tex rain suits. I purchased the Cabela's guide wear and I stay completely dry. They have inner sleeve in them that will keep your arms dry also. I have had other Cabelas rainwear as well as Tech20. I like the guide wear.
3992426,NLpike,2015-06-23 13:06:00,28,"I too had a Cabela's rain suit that I liked. Unfortunately the waterproofing was just wore out of it after 5 years. I still keep the jacket and wear it on rainy days on land. The replacement I chose after many hours of research was Stormr Fusion. I wore this suit for one solid week in Canada and loved it. It has all waterproof zippers with back flap for extra protection. The sleeves have form fitting rubber cuffs that allow you to put your whole arm in the water and nothing but your hand will get wet (tested this, works like a charm). There is an interior lining that wicks sweat and keeps the cold wet outer shell from ever touching you. The bibs were the best part. They have flexible knee pads built in for all the kneeling you will do when getting fish out of the water. Between this and Cabela's, there is no comparison. Cost wise, Fusion is about 500 USD for the jacket and bibs. Cabela's Rainy River suit is about 330 USD. My cousin paid 470 USD for Bass Pro 100MPH and he loved it. It also looked very quality, but it wasn't black, and it didn't have the rubber cuffs."
3992938,Carnhzkr,2015-06-23 16:02:00,964,"I'm curious if anyone on this board has a SIMMS rainsuit. I'd like to hear if they're worth the money. I figured my next will be Cabelas Guidewear, due to all of the positive press they get on WC, but every time I go in to my local Scheels, I salivate over the awesome looking SIMMS raingear. They are pricey, at about $400 per piece."
3993098,NLpike,2015-06-23 16:38:00,28,"For the Pro-Dry it's $500 for the jacket and $400 for the bibs. The G4 is $550 and $700. You have to remember it's just a shell. They are amazing at repelling water and wind, but there is no insulating value to them. So it's great for summer, not so good for early spring or fall. My brother swears by his SIMMS. He also sleeps with the windows open in the dead of winter. I still say Stormr is better at half the price."
3993922,stillangling,2015-06-23 20:35:00,149,Cabelas Guidewear. Another nasty musky opener this weekend. Wild trip down the lake on Friday through driving rain and periodic rain until Sunday afternoon. Dry and can't say enough good things about the suit. Too many years of fishing in cheap gear that did not breath. Never tried a Simms but managed to get my cabelas suit on sale for less than $400. Don't think you could beat it for the money.
3994610,Mark R,2015-06-24 07:40:00,1538,"I have Cabelas Guidwear and it keeps me dry except when I sit on a wet seat for a few hours, the water seeps thru the bottoms and I end up with soggy shorts. Anyone else have this problem?"
3994850,pjshorthorn,2015-06-24 08:49:00,5654,How old is your suit? May just need to be reconditioned. I had a number of suggestions to use NixWax on my GorTex. We shall see how it holds up this year if I have to fish in the rain. PjShorthorn
3989714,drew59,2015-06-22 18:39:00,87,"My rain suit has given up after many years of good service (Cabelas Gortex). Here's my question: Is there a suit that doesn't leak at the jacket zipper? When sitting the jackets buckle creating places for water to pool (at least that's my experience). I always end up with wet spots up and down my torso along the zipper line. Anyone had a different experience or is getting ""a little"" wet just part of fishing in the rain?"
3990218,Bill Krejca,2015-06-22 20:58:00,6107,"One answer is to get a 3/4 length rubberized slip-over parka, one having no zipper. I have one which works quite well, don't recall the name, but it is a name brand. That solves that problem. Now to find a solution for keeping underneath sleeves dry - I haven't figured that one out yet, don't expect I ever will. Bill"

3990322,Aspencreek,2015-06-22 21:20:00,2911,"The new ones from Cabela's have a storm flap over the zipper, keep it closed and you are good to go.I've tried the PVC, rubber, etc, etc. They all shed water but I'm wet from the inside sweating/condensation etc. Besides, a little seepage at the zipper is a very small price to pay for what you get in the long run. Get the longer coat and bibs, it will last another 10 yrs!!"
3990738,TNtroller,2015-06-23 05:46:00,525,"Most if not all gore tex suits will have storm flaps over the zippers, but some water can get thru depending on conditions (wind and heavy rain). BPS has a suit in the Ascend line that has the waterproof zippers, and no more $$ than other GT suits. Getting wet while out fishing is just part of the sport. It's amazing how we spend so much $$ to stay dry while out on the water. I don't mind getting a bit wet/damp during the summer but during the winter time, not good at all. I am a firm believer in GT suits, rode motorcycles for years, stayed dry in numerous downpours and long days riding in the rain while on trips."
3990746,pjshorthorn,2015-06-23 05:52:00,5654,"Storm flaps are the ticket. We will never stay 100% dry , but Gor-tex gets us pretty close. Last fall I wore my Guidewear suit to a college football game......conditions were similar to fishing in early spring or late fall.....rain and a high of 45 degrees. Guys were actually coming up to me at the game asking where I got the rain suit and wished they had one... PjShorthorn"
3990770,Obabikon,2015-06-23 06:01:00,2370,"frabil just came out with an awesome rain suit. A rep gave me a set to try out. It has a waterproof zipper... it's hard to describe, but there's actual rubber in the zipper. It poured all day yesterday, and I was dry as a bone. It isn't as heavy a suit as some... which is also ideal for summer fishing."

3990810,clawman,2015-06-23 06:16:00,2078,Or if you get a top for your boat and sit under the top your zipper won't leak!
3991186,phishfearme,2015-06-23 07:38:00,1242,those flaps leak - period. the better suits like those listed by obabikan have zippers that do not leak - no flaps. they are NOT cheap - but my north face suit has lasted about 10 years now and NO wet fronts. I've said it a hundred times on this site - you cannot pay too much for a good rainsuit. phish
