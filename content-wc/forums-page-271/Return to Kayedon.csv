I found many of the marked off hot spots unfishable. Remi built a dock over the existing dock as appears to be a yearly occurrence. Our group included 3 experienced fisherman 2 guys from Atlanta and another novice. We had a great trip with each boat averaging 100 fish per day about 50/50 walleye and pike. We rotate partners every day and some boats targeted just pike and others walleyes. Best fish were a 28.5 inch and 24.5 eye with dozens of eyes between 19-23. Pike we seemed to snap off or have pike bite off a number of trophy class fish. We only caught 6 pike over 30 inches but I did land a 45 inch ""Hummer"" if you read Mike's report. Camp is blessed with a lot of eagles, we saw plenty of moose a bear, sand hill cranes on the drove up and experienced fantastic weather. I cannot wait to go back."

3995314,vteye,2015-06-24 11:29:00,812,Ride from Kayedon camp to mouth of Ogoki was cut in half as no rock dodging this spring. We caught a lot of fish at the mouth including the 28.5 inch walleye I mentioned. We did not venture beyond a mile or two into Ogoki and did not fish lake near speckled trout falls that produced in prior trip.
