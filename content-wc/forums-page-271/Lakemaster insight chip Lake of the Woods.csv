3981066,Obabikon,2015-06-19 09:27:00,2370,"It works in Morson. By ""North of Nestor Falls"" do you mean Sioux Narrows/Kenora? Or actually in the Nestor area?"
3981410,tjandy,2015-06-19 11:19:00,107,In the Nestor area. We are renting a houseboat there. thanks
3981962,tyeeguy,2015-06-19 14:57:00,111,It does not cover the northern 25% of the lake. They use to put the Canadian map in its placebut now they no longer include it. It is just the lake outline.See the pdf for coveragehttp://www.cabelas.com/assets/produc...y_lakelist.pdf
