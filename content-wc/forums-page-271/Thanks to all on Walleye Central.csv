1998794,firstfrok,2013-08-01 12:20:00,12,I joined this site in late winter to see if we could fill an opening for a trip to Lake Evans. Never got the spot filled but not a big deal. But what i did get was a lot of usefull information that helped me plan this trip. I even received a few lures that were hand made from an individual on this site. We leave two weeks from today and just wanted to say thanks to Walleye Central and all the folks that shared valuable information.

Our trips up north would have been much less enjoyable without you. Plus, just reading the posts is a hoot and gets me really anxious to go. 12 more days and we'll be on Lac Seul. Thanks to all who contribute!!!"
