3948297,Scot,2015-06-09 02:00:00,8,"Oh, and yes, I understand that I was suppose to unhook the muskie in the net, and not remove it from the water for a picture. The fish was released very quickly and healthy. I also went over the 80 km speed limit, and probably didn't have my running lights on early enough one night too, I hear the fines ringing up the more I talk, lol. Good luck everyone."
3949377,payswell69,2015-06-09 08:52:00,3,"In your case Mr. Prez., it would be Vodka clear!"
3949705,rockape,2015-06-09 10:13:00,215,And you probably had beer in the boat too! NICE accidental musky! You were fishing for Pike. What did it hit on?
3950377,Scot,2015-06-09 13:43:00,8,"The muskie hit on a 1/4 ounce Johnson silver minnow(the smallest one they make) with a paddle tail minnow. No beer in the boat, i'm not asking for trouble, i'm just not afraid of it"
3999762,Terwalleye,2015-06-25 19:51:00,166,"A little slow on the report. Got back Saturday the 20th. Over all no complaints about our week on Cedar. Weather could not have been much better. On average it was 70 degrees, sunny and a slight breeze. Maybe not the best for catching but was certainly ideal for trying. It was kind of a weird year for our group. Weird in that there were not many weeds yet. The water temp was upper 60's and even 70 in some shallow bays. Those temps usually = full grown weeds and the fishing pattern that goes with that. However the crappies and Smallies were full on spawning. Smallies could be caught at will anywhere there was rocky shore (we are priniarily live bait guys and caught them on leeches under a slip bobber.) Crappies were staged for spawning and we nailed 'em. Nice average size too. Our walleye spots didn't all produce this year like in past years. We could catch a bunch of 17"" no problem if we tried but finding the larger ones was a different story. Most walleyes came while anchoring in 12 feet and fishing from under the boat to 6 ft deep towards shore. Points, humps and rock walls all produced depending on what day it was and the wind direction at the time. Thanks again to Wayne and Karla at Clarks Northern Lights. A grade A operation. Cabins, boats, bait etc."
4000346,Gipper,2015-06-26 04:56:00,76,Thanks for leaving some for us Mark. We are leaving in 2 weeks.
4002258,pale ryder,2015-06-26 19:52:00,1937,Thanks for the report Terwalleye.
4002274,pale ryder,2015-06-26 19:58:00,1937,I'll be up there in two weeks also. I'm staying at Clark's Northern Lights. I'll be driving a white Skeeter with a blue stripe.
4003994,Gipper,2015-06-27 19:09:00,76,Cedar Lake Lodge. I'll look for you. Black Alumacraft
3913250,rockape,2015-05-28 11:01:00,215,I'll be with the walleye wrangler 6/13-6/20. Can't wait. Sounds like the water is really low. Pretty safe lake overall compared to Eagle and Lac Seul. I don't know what cabin we are in. We will have 7-8 guys. Looking forward to all of us catching a lot of fish.
3914362,prov1800,2015-05-28 18:21:00,5010,Water is not that low.we have had a couple of good rainfalls today included.watch the rock in time swaure last time i was out there there was no jug on it.enteance to nelson is low and by the the burned bridge.need to go slow through those areasthe rest is WOT.
3914746,1jigfish2,2015-05-28 20:44:00,110,"Prov1800, I want to commend you for showing that couple your spot that you caught fish. There are a lot of fishermen that will not do that. We do the same thing as you. If we can help someone out, by showing them a spot, or showing them how we fish, we do it. We figure that everyone pays a lot of money to get up there, the goal is to catch fish, so we help. We have been thanked a lot. It makes it worthwhile, just seeing them smile as they catch fish. Most go back in the water anyways, so it is not hurting anyone, just making someones trip a bit better. Tight lines"
3914794,prov1800,2015-05-28 20:51:00,5010,Appreciate that.
3915778,rockape,2015-05-29 08:15:00,215,I know that rock well! Last year it was underwater with weeds breaking the surface. I'm sure there are plenty of lower unit chunks on the bottom around there! Thanks for the info.
3943465,jld235,2015-06-07 11:17:00,11,"We fished out of Cedar Lake Lodge from 5/30-6/5. Water temps were in the upper 50's to start and topped out around 61 by the time we left. We found plenty of walleye in 10-12 fow. We usually used a jig and minnow but a jig with gulp twister tail also worked. Most fish walleye were right around 14"" with some 16-22"" inchers to be had along the way. All of our walleye fishing was on the west arm. Crappie were easy to find and easier to catch. We did well on Nelson Lake around the island and around the islands in Peephole. The crappie size ranged from 10-13 inch with very few fish under 10"". Crappie were hitting small jigs with twister tails tipped with artificial products. They sure were fun to catch! We searched and searched for sizeable perch with no success. We have a strict 10"" size restriction with most of our perch coming under. We also spent a day on Cliff looking for Lake Trout but no success. The wind was nasty so jigging deep was not an option. We trolled 20-30 fow with no success. The only Lake Trout we marked were in 60-70 fow and they were very scattered. Thank to everyone for your help with suggestions and tips. PM me if I can return the favor. Jeff"
3944921,prov1800,2015-06-07 20:29:00,5010,"Sounds like you guys had a good time.cedar is a fun lake to fish.the fish you marked on cliff would most likely be whitefish.lakers are not that deep yet, caught some there last week in ten ft."
3945129,jld235,2015-06-07 22:06:00,11,Now you tell me! Ha! A good time none-the-less. We love to catch Lake Trout. I'll have to find some help next time up. We are new to the Laker game. Good luck everyone. Jeff
3948249,Terwalleye,2015-06-08 23:51:00,166,"Heading up Friday and cant wait! year six on Cedar and it has yet to disappoint. I am curious about one thing though. I had heard the water was gin clear this year vs. past years. We stay on and mostly fish the West side too. How was the water clarity? Also, if I may. What height and weed growth? Anyone?"
3948289,Scot,2015-06-09 01:30:00,8,"We were on cedar may 30th to june 6th. The lower west arm was clear and was about 3 degrees cooler than the lower east arm. Cabbage was not to the surface in the west arm, but was breaking the surface in the warmer bays on the east arm. As we got closer to time square the water got more stained, then very stained down the east arm. We caught walleyes anywhere from 6 ft in weeds, to 22 feet on rocky reefs, and on structure in between. While casting for pike with a 6 1/2 ft jigging rod, and 10 lb test braid, I managed to hook and land a 53 inch muskie. Snapped a quick picture and sent her on her away. It was a fish of a lifetime"
3904538,prov1800,2015-05-25 20:19:00,5010,"Well first week is done and in the books.i fished Saturday on the opener.fishing was fantastic.weather was also very good.first dry opener in years.fish were very shallow as usual.we caught good numbers at some of my spring spots.didnt get ouf sun/mon. Due to weather.didnt go out again till Wednesday. Again fishing was terrific.walleyes didnt move much from the weekend and wereceasy pickings again as werevthe smallies.water temps had dropped back to the opener temps of around 45 on the main basins.needed to find warmervwater to catch them.i saw people fishing summer spots and dont think they would havd done well.got out again this last weekend with my wife and the two of us caught a hundred fish sat and sun.water temps bitting 60 plus.fish were still shallow and saw camp boats fishing summer spots again.with probably not much luck.went drifted into some known muskue spawing grounds and they were definetly in there saw bunches of them.had one come clise to ander my biat.fins were somewhat beat up so they are spawning for sure.cant wait for that opener.so with that all being said.it wad a reallg good week of fishing for me.want to thank clarkes northern lights resort forcalways letting me launch and testing out their awesome minnows.fishing will improve for those coming in the next few weeks as fishing does get easier.this week iam going to be checking out cliff lake for walleye, bass and lake trout."

3909634,nitroman,2015-05-27 11:45:00,368,Huck34 and Walleye Wrangler. We will be there the week before you so I will try and leave you a fishing report with Ray and Kathie as far as where we were finding fish and what was working for us on our week. Do you know what cabins you are in? If not I will leave it with Kathie with your walleye central names on it! Shoot me a PM to remind me before next Thursday and I will try my best to remember LOL!
3909706,Huck34,2015-05-27 12:03:00,4,Thanks Nitro! Have a safe and successful trip! Would love to see some pics!ThanksHuck
3910794,jld235,2015-05-27 18:31:00,11,We are heading up on Saturday. We will be on Cliff either Tues or Weds. Have you heard how deep the Lakers are yet? Last year this same time they were split...we caught active fish in 20 fow but found most fish in 60 fow. We will be in a tan Alumnacraft with a net standing up in the middle. Stop by and say hi if run into us....I'll probably be shadowed by a crappy Princecraft...give those guys the 1 finger salute for me (fishing buddies). Good luck. Let us know how you did.Jeff
