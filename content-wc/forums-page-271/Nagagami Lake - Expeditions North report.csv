Used minnow type cranks in water around 7 to 10 feet. Others in our group fished the same depths with other techniques (jigs w/ gulp and bottom bouncers) and were also successful. Went where the wind was blowing the fish into. We worked in water we had never fished before so you never know what you will learn from one year to the next. Biggest walleye was 28 with several slightly smaller. The Foch river yielded many eaters with a few in the 20 in range. Unusual in that I met up with a guy and his group from our same area back home. They had been coming up to the same lake for 20 plus years during the same week. We have been going for only 6 years. They use a different camp and fly-in so we never ran into each other. I had seen him the night before at the Continental restaurant, but swore it couldn't have been him. What are the odds right? We eventually fished the same area and saw each other."

Several mid 30's from what others reported during the week. Dave and Adam were good. Jesse is the new camp hand and he did well for the week. He came on Adams recommendation. Had a great camp fry on Wednesday with lots of fish and plenty of good sides compliments of the camp hosts. Dave bought four new boats. Double walk through and it was wider than the normal Lund. Only problem was that you had to stretch a little more to rinse your hands in the lake. Good Luck"

3999786,Mich_Fisherman,2015-06-25 20:12:00,292,"Our group was also at Expeditions North the same week. This was our sixth year at Nagagami and Expeditions North. As noted the weather was good, fishing was great like previous years. This wind was a challenge for 3 Days but we were still successful. The biggest walleye was 29"" and the largest pike (caught while walleye fishing) was 34"". Our group mainly used minnows but I experimented with twister tails which worked pretty good. . We also used slip bobbers and a little trolling. Accommodations and service was once again top notch as David keeps attention to the detail. Adam, Jesse and Sam made sure the boats were ready for the next day fishing. The only unfortunate thing is I have to wait another year to go again. ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜’https://images.tapatalk-cdn.com/15/06...ca718de2e4.jpghttps://images.tapatalk-cdn.com/15/06...f9213483c1.jpgSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
