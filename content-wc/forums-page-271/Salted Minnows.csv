3998682,ziggyzag,2015-06-25 13:03:00,125,"Hey looking for some opinions about which works better on the walleye when it comes to salted minnows ""Fatheads"" or ""Shiners""??????????? which do you prefer?"
3998882,Fishoil,2015-06-25 14:16:00,1277,"I don't think it really matters but all I ever use is fatheads and they work just fine. The same goes for stateside when I use live minnows, nothing but fatheads."
3998914,ziggyzag,2015-06-25 14:28:00,125,Thanks for your input I am with you on fatheads vs shiners just getting a feel for those harden die hard walleye guys.
3999090,Bayou,2015-06-25 15:30:00,52,"Nice timing on the salted, now off to find the company that I've seen mentioned before."
3999154,Fishoil,2015-06-25 16:19:00,1277,"If you have a bait dealer near you that will sell you live minnows by the pound for a good price, they are very easy to salt yourself. Do a search for my thread ""How to salt minnows"" for the directions. The only thing I do differently now is I use a colander to rinse them. It makes the job MUCH easier."
3999234,ziggyzag,2015-06-25 16:49:00,125,Found this place on line he will ship salted minnowswww.dicksmithslivebait.com
3999290,michigan walleye guy,2015-06-25 17:11:00,95,"www.minnesotabaitandtackle.com is where I get my salted minnows. $55 will get you a gallon of fatheads, but the minnows are fairly small---probably raised in a pond. Good quality, nonetheless. They ship the salties vacuum packed in about 5 or 6 different bags, which works out good. They also sell shiners, but are sold out more often than not."
3999314,ziggyzag,2015-06-25 17:22:00,125,Thanks just check it out very good prices. Good luck out on the water.
4000274,BornToFish,2015-06-26 04:29:00,1224,"I have been using Fishoil's method of salting minnows (see above) for the last few seasons. The method works very well, is easy to do and keeps the minnows in good shape for a long time. Fatheads run about 15-18 dozen for $7.00 (U.S.), depending on size. I would think that a gallon of minnows costs me about $20. Fatheads are readily available all season, whereas shiners are seasonal (spring and autumn only). I tried salted fatheads and frozen shiners during my May trip to NW Ontario. They were pretty much the same in terms of results. I said ""pretty much"" as I noticed that the walleyes wanted something fairly big. Some of the fatheads were on the small size and didn't work as well. I bought several pounds of fatheads two weeks ago and noticed this batch was consistently running bigger in size, as compared to last year's batch that was purchased in early September. I will purchase a few pounds of shiners and fatheads next spring and have them salted. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
