4003746,rnnonmt,2015-06-27 16:38:00,992,"PJ, I am getting more familiar with the spots in the SE section. This is my 4th year in that area. I have 20+ trips to the NE section so I feel like the NE section is still better probably because I have more time on the water up there. All in all the SE section is getting better for me because I have been learning spots that I can go to. If it gets a little tough than I start going back to the basics until we can find some decent fish. One of the days we had a blast and never left the Z. All we did was point hop. Most of the points would produce a 30-40"" pike just into the calm side of a wind blown point. As soon as we would catch the ""point guard"" we would blast up to the next one. I did notice that the fish seemed to be leaning more towards summer patterns because we had a lot of fish hitting at the boat which means we were on top of the target zone or too shallow. But then we would be proved wrong again by casting into 2-3 feet of water and hitting slot fish. It was a bit weird. My son Caleb was out-fishing us and we were all throwing the same lure... a fire tiger rattlin rap. This one seemed to be the multi species go-to lure. I noticed a lot more slot fish this year for both walleye and pike. If it wasn't in the slot it was a dink. Smallmouth were very aggressive. I stopped counting at 20. Usually we only get a hand full each year. We don't target smallmouth so it was unusual for us to catch so many. I think the MNR should reduce the slot limit on smallmouth so we can harvest a few of them. You have to throw back anything over 13.75"" and this year we actually got 2 under the slot so we kept them. Most of them were 15-20"". Ive never eaten smallmouth but heard that they are good to eat prior to the warmer summer water temps so we kept the 2 small ones. The 5 of us from AZ came home with our limit so I am certain we will be having some fish fry parties once the AZ summer heat drops under triple digits around Sept (geesh)!!! I'm rambling a bit but our largest pike on my boat was 40"", largest pike for our group was 42"", largest walleye on my boat (and for our group) was 28"", and the largest smallie on our boat (and for our group) was 20"" although we had one that was 18"" and had to go at least 5lbs... it looked like it was going to pop! I haven't fished Deception lake but we do launch from deception landing. The usual route is deception landing through Bindo under the loon rapids bridge and to the Z. I heard way back when the loon rapids didn't have a bridge and the guys from out group used to see who could shoot through loon rapids the fastest. From what I understand it used to be about 60 feet wide until the bridge was built and they used to fly through there on plane. Now its only about 20 feet or so wide and there is a dog leg turn which is blind so we usually don't go through there fast anymore. Hope you and Jimmi have a great trip this year. Be sure to share the stories and fun with us."
4003882,pjshorthorn,2015-06-27 17:58:00,5654,"Thanks for the detail on that area. Another bucket list item Jimi is next on the trip list so he has some work to do to top a 28"" walleye and a 42"" pike !!!!! My report will be a total fabrication no matter what PjShorthorn"
4004026,jimirjr,2015-06-27 19:14:00,1149,"Holy Geezus... The GAUNTLET has been thrown out there... I'll do My best... I just can't seem to break the 27"" mark on Eye's... NO MATTER where I fish....."
4004282,pjshorthorn,2015-06-27 20:53:00,5654,"Based on where you are heading and your preference in fishing techniques, my prediction is that you will have at least 2 or 3 28""+ walleye if not a 29""+ walleye. Easy Peasey... Vandyk1 is coming back from their trip and hopefully he posts some results. They were going to the same area you are heading. I have a really good feeling about your trip !!!!!! No Pressure PjShorthorn"
4005626,rnnonmt,2015-06-28 12:51:00,992,"Jimmi, There is a 31-32""-er waiting for you at the ole trapper cabin where we let a 30""-er go a couple years ago. You know the spot... I marked it for you on the map!"
4006066,Limeyangler,2015-06-28 16:50:00,563,Great video man! Have fun sorting through the rest of the clips lol can be tedious.
3999642,rnnonmt,2015-06-25 19:35:00,992,"Thanks to Limeyangler he inspired me to pick up a GoPro and do some video. This is my first attempt at taking video, creating, and editing. Hope that you enjoy the video. Thanks Limey! Catch the vid herehttps://youtu.be/qRp-T4KqPS0"
4000362,pjshorthorn,2015-06-26 05:09:00,5654,Nice job on your video. I liked the slo-mo shots!!! What model GoPro did you get? What area of Lac Seul did you fish? PjShorthorn
4000666,jimirjr,2015-06-26 07:16:00,1149,"OH YEAH !! Nothin like a little ""STP"" for background.... I'm a bit partial to ""Slipknot"" .. ""Slayer""... ""Megadeth"" and ""Metallica"" Myself.... LOL! Great Videos which give a great overall feeling of a day at Lac Suel !! NICE FISHIES, Too !!!"
4001034,rnnonmt,2015-06-26 09:29:00,992,"PJ its a Gopro 3 silver +. It was 299 I think. I picked up a suction cup mount and a couple batteries and micro sd cards. By the time you are done ""accessorizing"" plan on spending at least 100 bucks above the camera purchase. I wish I had purchased the remote control for the Gopro so you can stop and start recording without running back and forth to the camera. One other thing that was cool with this camera is it has wifi so I could view what was being recorded on my IPhone in real time but having the wifi turned on in the camera reduced the run time of the gopro battery. All in all it was a bit of a learning curve because Ive never monkeyed with video before. I still have 3 days of video to go through yet which I will try to get another video together. I have some footage of my 15 yr old sons 40"" pike and some under water release of it. Pretty cool toy!!!"
4001050,rnnonmt,2015-06-26 09:31:00,992,"Jimmy, Ive got a ton of Metallica if you are serious! LOL"
4001074,rnnonmt,2015-06-26 09:35:00,992,"PJ, I forgot to answer.... we were in the SE section of Lacseul (Mainly in the Sen Bay area), Into Archer, the ""Z"", Thorsten creek, We have a lot more spots in that area that don't have names so we gave them our own names. ""Dougs bay"" Brians Islands, Shotgun Creek, Budro bay, Bay of Pigs. LOL. Are you fishing Lac Seul this year?"
4002698,pjshorthorn,2015-06-27 05:59:00,5654,"You Sir, have just unlocked a 20 year old question I've had about the SE section. Over all the years that I've studied my Lac Seul maps, I've always wondered what fishing was like going from Deception Bay up through Loon Rapids, Bindo Lake, the Zig Zag and ending in Sens Bay and Archer Lake. It sounds like you fellas have cracked the code and there is quality fishing in these areas. Ironically, MWH624 from this forum reached out to me about a month ago asking for suggestions in this general area. Although I had not personally fished it, I suggested a lot of spots you mentioned , along with some others, as the maps and water contours just look dang fishy. I think he is leaving soon to go up so hopefully he will post a report as well. I also want to try The Hole In the Wall off Decpetion Bay one time in my life to see what kind of results it would produce. I've passed that bay so many times and never took the time. Lac Seul......so much water.......so little time. I hope that I'll eventually be able to make a couple trips a year to start exploring some of these spots that have always made me take pause and wonder what they are really like. Expanse Lake ( just NE of Archer ) is another spot I've always wondered about . It has the Vermilion River flowing in and it empties into Scaler Lake. I'm thinking it is a year round sanctuary but portaging a canoe in there for a look at the secenery and wildlife would be pretty cool as well.Did you guys launch at Deception and make the run each day up to Sens ? Fortunately and unfortunately I'm not going to make Lac Seul this year. Fortunately, I'm branching out again this year and going to Eagle Lake and staying at Vermilion Bay Lodge so I can harrass V-Bay Gord all week in person and to pick up my ""fabulous"" prize from the gift shop for winning the ice out contest this year. Looking forward to spending some time hunty River Monsters there this summer with Breezy Point . Unfortunately, I miss Lac Seul every time I read great reports about the trips folks took. I can't wait till Jimirjr gets back from his HB trip in July to hear how they do as well. Heck, I think I have as much time invested in pulling maps and info. together for him as he will just driving there from Colorado. LOL. !!!Thanks for the GoPro Info. I need to do a little research on that. It is cool to watch the vids and a nice way to document a trip.Tight Lines,PjShorthorn"

Man, I'm gonna need to force Myself to take extra pics just For You Guys !! BRIAN, I've ALREADY been informed that I can ONLY play ""MY MUSIC"" for an HOUR a day while We drive up... lol! Little do They know that I've purchased ""ear plugs"" for all of Them ...."
4003322,pjshorthorn,2015-06-27 11:19:00,5654,"Hey, if you are driving then you are ""Radio/Music Captain"" . Rock on while you are driving, but get some Warren Zevon and George Thorogood in the mix to balance out that heavy metal I feel like we are sending our child off to the first day of school....called Lac Seul LOL !!!!! PjShorthorn"
4003658,rnnonmt,2015-06-27 15:26:00,992,"Jimmi, When you guys travel up there do you travel in a convoy with CB radios? If so, turn on some heavy metal and key up the Mic on the CB so everyone can enjoy your music!!"
