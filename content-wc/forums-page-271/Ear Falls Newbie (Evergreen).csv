3990418,Aspencreek,2015-06-22 21:48:00,2911,"I've got that chip, and I have a minimum of 5 underwater humps and reefs that don't show up on the chip. All marked when the water was way down in 2002. What a gold mine that year was for future fishing.Best advise is get SPECIFIC travel routes from your camp, mark what you find as you go, and go slow when you are moving island to point and back again."
3992130,Bstar,2015-06-23 11:25:00,564,X2 on the Navionics app. Inexpensive and easy to use. I'll still take my handheld gps for backup.
3992362,Carnhzkr,2015-06-23 12:24:00,964,Backup is always a good idea. I have GPS in my boat and still take my handheld and phone with Navionics app - just in case. That's why I wear a belt and suspenders at the same time.
3996402,fish007,2015-06-24 19:12:00,120,I just looked at my navionics premium Canada chip and it appears to have a detailed depth map of Lac Seaul. I used it on a fly in to Smoothrock last month and found it to be quite accurate. It's worth looking at.
3984418,rwz1,2015-06-20 14:53:00,6,"Hoping you can provide some guidance as we head up to Ear Falls for the first time on 7/18 staying at Evergreen. We have been going to Willams Lake Lodge to fish Lac Seaul together for the last decade, my fishing partners for the last 18 consecutively. It's been great, but looking for something new to raise the excitement level a bit. However this new journey comes with a little anxiety too with the pressure of learning a new area, including where to avoid donating a lower unit. We focus on the usual, Eyes, Pike, and Smallies, generally in that order depending upon the bite. 1. I haven't found any maps of the Ear Falls area let alone any with a starting point of where to fish. Any suggestions? 2. How difficult is the navigation in this area? Do you recommend a handheld GPS? We knew the other so well it wasn't an issue, but every year someone at the lodge spent the night out on the lake becuase they either got lost or damaged their boat/motor. Thanks for all of your help...."
3984626,teddi,2015-06-20 17:33:00,349,"Pat at evergreen will give you a lake map and Moose will help you with the hot spots. Don,t worry every thing will be good. Hope you have a good time."

We knew the other so well it wasn't an issue, but every year someone at the lodge spent the night out on the lake because they either got lost or damaged their boat/motor.You need a GPS. Just as important to having a GPS, you need to know exactly how to use it before you leave home. I've seen so many guys show up in any camp and take their brand new fangled GPS out of the box and try to figure it out then and there. Usually that is the last time you see it.Learn how to leave tracks and how to save or delete them. Deleting a track by mistake is easy to do and there is no ""undo"" button that I'm aware of. If your GPS accepts a Navionics chip, buy one. Money very well spent for many reasons.Pooch"
3985778,mswope13,2015-06-21 08:47:00,73,"Pat runs a great camp, clean cabins, BEST boats out there. Moose coming back is a great plus as he will navigate you to some areas. Only draw back is fishing late in the summer out of Ear Falls, you will find yourself heading south to Steamboat Bay to find your most consistent fishing. This is about a 30 minute boat ride. My group has fished out of Evergreen for quite a few years now, the last 6-7 years have been the 3rd week of July. If you are there in June, the north end of the lake will always produce, but the eyes seem to move south as the summer goes along. Hit the small island with a bouey marking the northeast end of it, located just before you hit goose island. You will see the small island on your right. Then head down to Steamboat Bay, and fish the islands that sit to the east of the north bank of Steamboat. You will find them in 15-25'. Last year was absolutely phenominal, best of luck!"
3986106,Fisheroffish,2015-06-21 11:08:00,5,"Couldn't agree more with this statement. We just got back from Evergreen last Sunday and had a blast. Fishing was better than it has ever been for us, but we were having trouble finding anything big consistently. Talked to Moose on the dock the last day and he recommended a spot. We caught four fish 26"" or over in about three hours, as well as countless smaller fish. Ask questions and you will be more than fine."
3987474,Aspencreek,2015-06-21 22:37:00,2911,"GPS is a must, and yes know how to use it before you leave the dock. That area of Lac Seul, shucks everywhere on LS, there are underwater reefs and humps and boulders that will ruin your trip. THIS IS NOT A SOUPBOWL LAKE!! Have them mark good travel routes and stick to them, watch your depth finder and NEVER cut points or go between islands without knowing depths. It's a great way to at minimum lose your prop or drop a lower unit.It is to easy to get turned around out there, go around a couple islands while fishing and start island hopping and you are lost without a GPS. And spending a night on an island is not fun, take it from someone who knows.Have fun, but be safe, it's a fantastic fishery!"
3988258,SteveZ,2015-06-22 09:57:00,271,"Do yourself a favor and give the dam below Ear Falls a try. The fish are consistently bigger and trophies eyes are common. We just got back and did crazy good. We caught 100's in the 20-22"" range, 20-30 in the 24-25"" range, a number of 26"" eyes and 1 29 1/4"" eye. We go there every year and most years someone in the group catches a 30"" eye. Our biggest northern was 40"". A GPS is always a good idea, never know when you are going to need it."
3988314,Knoxabilly,2015-06-22 10:08:00,225,Fishing from shore below the dam or did you put a boat in?
3988634,rwz1,2015-06-22 11:39:00,6,"Thank you very much! Glad to know. Getting a handheld GPS here in the next couple days to play with it for the next few weeks before going. Thank you for the news about heading south and to ask Moose. They want you to catch fish so you come back! Deffinitely aware of the dangers in this water. The last few years we kept exploring more into the central body of water from the southern end. Man, driving into the sun it seemed fine going out to the islands, but as we headed back we were startled to realize how many times we just missed a reef, and we were at least 100-200yds from any shore. Really need to understand where the dangers lie, another reason for the GPS."
3988850,Carnhzkr,2015-06-22 12:55:00,964,"For $15, you can download the Navionics app to your smartphone and it will do everything a handheld GPS will do. It will show you where you are on a map of the lake, allow you to set waypoints, and will trace your route so you can follow your trail back. The Navionics map will give you a ""general idea"" regarding depth, just the same as an expensive hand-held. Keep in mind that there have been no accurate surveys made of the lake, so any map, whether paper or electronic, provides only a general idea of the lake's contour. You shouldn't just watch your GPS map and assume you're safe if it says you're in 20 feet. Your best bet is to have your outfitter mark up a map showing safe routes and try to stick to that whenever possible."
