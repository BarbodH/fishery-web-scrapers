3977978,Big Mike,2015-06-18 09:17:00,35,"Just a quick report on my first trip of the season. This trip is with 8 or 9 guys that like to fish hard...and party harder! lol Most of the action in my boat was focused on walleye because they were stupid easy to catch! We primarily fished shallow, 6 to 8 feet with 3/16 or 1/4 oz jigs tipped with minnows or plastics, primarily ring worms or various shad bodies. I would say the meat out produced the plastics 5 to 1 but the plastics accounted for bigger fish. We did most of out damage on the big lake wherever we found new cabbage coming in. Keeping the bait away from the boat was critical in the shallow water especially if the sun was shining which was most of the week. We managed several fish over 22"" with 24"" being the biggest. Disappointed that the big 28 inch plus fish were not cooperating. We also did well on windblown rock points and most of our bigger walleye came from these classic structures including: devils, doe, and north shore. The walleye bite should really heat up for the bigger fish in the coming weeks as the weeds continue to get better, for me it will be time to throw big jerk baits at them in the morning/evenings. Pike fishing was slow for big fish but the amount of 25 to 27 inch fish we caught while walleye fishing was incredible. It was a lot of fun catching them on light tackle but I have to admit the amount of jigs I lost this year was very aggravating! You gotta love the fight these pike put up on this light walleye gear though. Biggest pike for our boat was 42"" along with 9 or 10 others in the 36 to 37 inch range. Not bad but a few weeks away from the peak of their shallow activity. If I had my choice this week would be the number one for bringing young kids because the fish are very, very shallow and easy to catch with small lures. Bass...we didn't fish them but caught a few on walleye tackle. The other guys in out group had a lot of fun with them targeting beds and areas of rock close to bedding areas. Tons of 19 inch fish were caught by them and others. Good luck to anyone heading up soon, pray for a short lived mayfly hatch and good weather. I will report after the next trip in late June...Mike"

3978730,shortmag,2015-06-18 12:56:00,70,"Geez, you really know how to get a person fired up. We've got a month to go. Hope the mayflys are done by then. We had to delay our trip so this later timeframe will be new to us. Thanks for the excitement."

4006178,UKBDM,2015-06-28 17:39:00,178,"Just got back this am. Awesome trip. Cloudy early in the week followed by sunny/hot late. Walleye were still shallow although I think the big ones have moved to deeper structure. North wind blowing into the 2nd narrows was very good two different mornings with 3-5 fish caught every drift. 1/4 chartreuse jig with either orange or white grub tipped w/ a piece of crawler was best especially when the water was stirred up by the wind. Did catch a 22"" and a 24"" one morning on the big lake with a crawler harness w/ chartreuse and orange blade but jigs ruled this week. Smallmouth were leaving the beds by the end of the week although we had good topwater action around big boulders/rocky shorelines. I think there were 6-7 19"" plus fish caught in camp this week. Didnt fish for pike much but a lot of nice perch were caught in the weeds. Did a little lake trout trolling late in the week up in Aerobus Bay and caught a 19"". Several in our group spent more time at it and caught a couple over 26"" and a couple in the high teens. Dipsy's and silver/green or silver/blue spoons was the ticket. 40-50' deep. Waited in line 75 min Sat am to get back to US. Left earlier than normal and hit rush hour I guess. This was our 6th year at Jim and Julie's and fishing and fisherman keep getting better. Last year saw 3-4' over normal water levels and this year 2' low. Still caught lots of 14-17"" fish with no difficulty. Did hit a rock Wed am and damaged skeg. Prop was a little scuffed but no problems until i got home this am. Lower unit oil dripping in driveway."
