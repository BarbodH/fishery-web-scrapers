The walleye were there but were not playing, and when we found some bass that did want to play my fishing partner that day was less than enthusiastic to play for anymore than 1/2 an hour, especially when I had to break it to him that the bass we were catching were too big to keep because of seasonal size restrictions. So back I went, this time with Roloff my chocolate Labrador, hoping the fish were in a better mood .https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxmVoZ4E-eI"

4000986,retire55,2015-06-26 09:10:00,1029,A stupendous video Simon. Some very nice sized walleye and a fishing partner who is always interested in what you're doing. Can't get better than that! Thanks for sharing.
