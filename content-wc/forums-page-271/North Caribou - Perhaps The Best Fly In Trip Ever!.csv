3998706,Golden Eagle,2015-06-25 13:15:00,2642,If Mike and his guys keep fishing the lake for 6 more years there'll be nothing left but used fish. Better head up there soon.
3999266,Ferrispata,2015-06-25 17:01:00,63,"I am fine with ""used"" fish. Although from the sounds of it, it is so large we never have to worry too much about that."
4001642,fish007,2015-06-26 14:09:00,120,Great job on your report of your trip ! I just came across a speckled trout trip you were on with your son and enjoyed it thoroughly also!

3990114,law57,2015-06-22 20:26:00,1147,"A good friend owns and operates North Caribou Camps. I was at his 'old' camp last week. I go there (old camp) every June and sometimes in September. His 85yo mother still lives in Dryden. I had lunch with her last Tuesday. I wish she'd write a book about building a camp from nothing in her youth and now being in cyber space... Everything you read about N. Caribou is true - big fish and lots of them. If you go, tell Dusty that Bob says hello..."
3990298,Mike Borger,2015-06-22 21:16:00,1554,Was that you with the other two boats heading into the honey hole as we were heading out? If so then I saw you at camp later in the day when Dusty fixed your motor.

3994698,Jeler,2015-06-24 08:02:00,92,MikeAnother excellent post! Top notch photos and video too!Thanks so much for sharingJeffIowa
3994898,forgop,2015-06-24 08:55:00,880,Me thinks this should be my next trip for 2016. Now to just see if I can find a group and someome that can serve as a guide.
3994930,HeHooksHimself,2015-06-24 09:01:00,725,Another destination for the bucket list. I am glad I can vicariously experience all of these great places through your reports Mike. If only time and money were no issue.....Green with envy here. Fish On! Hooks.
3985178,Mike Borger,2015-06-21 00:21:00,1554,"I know, I know...every trip is awesome right? Well I said last year that my trip to North Caribou was the best trip I've ever done and I meant it. In the process a new camp record for numbers of pike over 40"" in a week was set.This recent trip if anything was even more incredible, even though we battled through some pretty tough conditions.Once again my group set another camp record for pike, and honestly it could have been even more incredible if we'd have had nice stable weather.Still, I'm not complaining. If anyone's curious a VERY lengthy report on the trip can be seen here complete with a disgusting amount of photos and a pile of video.Cheers, Mikehttp://www.canadafishingguide.net/fa...e-fly-in-trip/"

I picked up a ton of tips and ideas from it that I can use on my ""home"" Canadian waters and I'm sure when I spend another hour reading/watching it again I'll find more.

Obviously you actually read the text Bill LOL!The group of 12 was a large corporate group with a bunch of clients with them - great bunch of guys! They did very well actually, although probably did more walleye fishing than us. You need to focus solely on the Hummers if you want to get a lot of them.

BUT perhaps we should talk, I'm always looking for people to join me.It was a gross amount of work to churn this out so quickly, but I have a timeline and needed to get it done. Tuesday morning I leave for the NWT with my son.All told it was roughly 24 hours of editing photos and video spread over three days then yesterday morning I sat down to write the thing and started at 8am Sat and finished at 2:30 am Sunday. I'm really glad it's done!"
