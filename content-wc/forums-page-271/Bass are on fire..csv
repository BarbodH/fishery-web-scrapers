The roads up there are like driving on tarmac almost, right upto the last 200 yards before the landing, whether you come past Silver water wheel route or the William's Creek route. The walleye bite was probably the worst I have ever had, although we met plenty of folks at the landing that had no trouble finding them in numbers and size.We saw lots on sonar but was difficult to get them to bite, not so with the bass.We must have caught at least twenty in almost as many minutes, definitely on the beds right up on shore....almost impossible to catch anything under 18"", definitely more fun than chasing walleye with lockjaw!VIDEOhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWyM6gU6uOA"
3994250,JDP,2015-06-24 04:46:00,1457,but you still got what you needed!You still got some dandy walleyes and beautiful smalliesdespite the poor walleye bite and the rain.Thanks for sharing the video.
3995482,rnnonmt,2015-06-24 12:10:00,992,"Limey, thanks for the great vids. This year our trip in the SE section of Lac Seul produce a lot of smallies. More than I can remember. Here is one of the toads we caught. I picked up a gopro Hero 3 silver + this year and a suction cup mount and had it on the engine for most of the trip. We took a lot of video with the looping feature.... now its time to go through all of them and put together a montage. Is the Gopro video editing software anygood for a first timer? Thanks, Brian"

Thanks, Brian ]LOL that Bass is about to POP! I gotta start using that looping feature a bit more too. The GoPro editing suite is actually very, very good, i would recommend. If you have an apple computer I would recommend their iMovie software too, a bit more you can do with that.Quote: Originally Posted by jimirjr""FK--G PIKE""..... Thats FUNNY !!!LOL oooops. You should have heard the choice words I yelled across to the William's Lake Lodge crew that thought it was cool to come within 20ft of where I was fishing yesterday when there were no other boats within 2 miles of us! F bombs galore but they moved on LOL WELCOME TO CANADA!Quote: Originally Posted by Draco1206I believe that's ""English"" for ""shagging"".nothing wrong with a good shagging .lol.Quote: Originally Posted by new hipsThanks for sharing........(missing my Ontario trip )Hopefully next year...........Keep those videos coming....it's almost like being there.That sucks NH a video from yesterday uploading as I type."
3997426,Pezman38,2015-06-25 07:09:00,3196,Windows Movie maker is very good free editing tool that I find easier to use and better than the GoPro software. Imovie is great for apple people.Nice videos Limey
