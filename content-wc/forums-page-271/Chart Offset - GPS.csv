I noticed earlier this month when I used the lake map for the first time, that my GPS screen showed my boat as being ""on shore"". I was quite disappointed in this display. I called Humminbird yesterday afternoon and learned that there is a ""chart offset"" feature within the Charts menu. I understand that this option will essentially shift the lake chart so that my actual boat position and position on the map are in the same spot. Have you tried this feature on your gps/sonar unit, be it Humminbird, Lowrance or other brand? Did it work? My wife and I leave in a few hours for another fishing trip. I will give the offset a try to see if it works. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
