4001618,Slab Seeker,2015-06-26 13:49:00,14,"Sorry Coming in way late on this as I don't get on this site alot. Going back to the original article reference: We were at Nungesser lake Lodge last year in August and may have been there shortly after this happened. They warned us more than once that the MNR can boat/fly in at any time and went over in detail the limits. They met us at the dock each and every time we came in and immediately took the fish and cleaned them and gave us a count of what we had in the freezer (freezer was in the shack at the dock with each cabins fish were clearing marked and sorted). Like someone posted before, my guess is they cleaned them out on the lake and brought them up to their cabin freezer in a cooler. Again, just guessing. I do know the owner had just retired from his fulltime job last year so probably caused him to be more engaged and made him step up the awareness to dock hands. Our party had a meeting on the dock each morning to cover what we had in possesion and who could keep what type of fish and what size. All comes back to how you were taught to respect the resource. We had a first timer with us that trip and he caught a 44"" Northern and we spent a long time making sure it was recovered and back to full strength again before we left the area."

If revenue was the main goal of the MNR they would let an individual purchase multiple licenses and let an individual harvest as many fish as he has licenses for or simply raise the cost and fish limit of the license. Monetary fines collected and used appropriately towards the conservation of the resources is one way to punish criminals and lifetime revocation of fishing privileges is another. A combination of those is probably the best method of protecting the resources. Personally I think that a lifetime revocation of the fishing privileges is just in this case because they broke the law by a long shot. In fact, I think that there should be some bi-lateral agreement between Canada and the USA that you lose your privileges in both countries. So the main comment is: If you catch and eat your daily limit or catch and keep your daily limit it is still the same number of fish right? Yes, but only if you obey the law. Completed."

You can't tell me that people that fish with 2 poles and throw walleye in the bottom of the boat before unhooking them don't know that they are killing fish.

3274922,Obabikon,2014-10-31 06:32:00,2370,A huge percentage (if not MOST) fish purchased at a restaurant/store are farm raised now.
3275386,dkrusin,2014-10-31 08:38:00,97,"Salmon, cat fish, tilapia probably farm raised, not sure about Walleyes being farm raised. Personally am not a big fan of any fish that is farm raised. This is off topic, but some restaurants will advertise their fish as Alaskan Walleye which is in fact Alaskan Pollock (fresh salt water) and not bad. A local sportman club has an annual Walleye feed. A buddy of mine bought a 10 lb box that they had left over. These fish were huge (guessing 4 to 5 pounds) skin was still on, so no question they were Walleyes. Box was stamped ""Product of Canada"". Not saying they were taken illegally, but I'd bet they were gill netted, and if people continue to buy this product, they will continue gill netting them.I think there is a processing plant in Red Lake, Minnesota. Advertising fresh Walleyes year round. The great thing is the Minnesota DNR gets to restock the lake for them."
3275650,Obabikon,2014-10-31 09:46:00,2370,"This will be my only post on the topic, as I just finished getting caught up in another netting conversation. FACTS! 1. Netting kills a fraction of the fish that anglers do. 2. Large lakes can handle some netting 3. I do not like netting, however it serves a purpose. Many people can't fish 3 times a week, but want to eat fish 3 times a week. 4. As long as fish populations are monitored and protected, there is no reason that legal netting shouldn't occur. 5. LOTW's has had commercial fishing off and on over the past 30 years. It currently has the absolute best fishing in my entire life. Take it from someone who spends EVERY DAY (not a 1-2 week trip every summer) fishing on the lake. I wish that netting wasn't a service needed. However, there is a demand for it. Personally, I want to eat walleye in the winter, but I can only take 4 walleye home. Only options right now.... poach them, don't eat them, or buy them legally. Last comment, and I'll be done with the topic. Netters in general are actually good people and outdoors men. The horror stories of abandoned nets and abuse of rights are typical ""bad apples"". Just like this story. It doesn't reflect the majority. This isn't an ""us vs. them"" situation, as most are just trying the best they can to make a living and provide for their family. I just hate to see them vilified."
3271346,JayM5209,2014-10-29 11:33:00,1050,"The quick answer is, No. The easy way to think of it is, ""I can take home one daily limit."" Check the 2014 Ontario fishing regs., page 7 and page 10 specifically. The catch limit (daily) and the possession limit are the same unless otherwise specified in the regs. They are limits per species, not an aggregate of all fish. Also, folks need to read the regs. for the zone in which they will be fishing because there are rules that differ from zone to zone, and even within zones on particular bodies of water. But I have always found the Ontario regulations to be clear, simple, and easy to understand.The WC moderators always have a link to the current regs pinned as a sticky at the top of this Canada forum."
3271370,LOW1,2014-10-29 11:51:00,2828,"But we don't know that. If one angler fishes one day and kills 10 walleye he has killed eight more than his daily limit of two. If a second angler fishes five days and kills two per day he has not killed more than his legal daily limit, but is still in violation of the possession limit. I am not saying that the second angler is not in violation of the law, but I am suggesting that his conduct is not as reprehensible as the first angler and should not be punished as much. Why? Because if he had caught the same number of fish and ate them each day he would not have violated the law. And under your interpretation, would a person not have to stop fishing (even catch and release) once two fish were in his freezer? After all, being in possession of a live fish is still being in possession of a fish. My understanding is that there is a special rule in place for Lake of the Woods that allows fisherman to ""store"" their two live fish, continue to fish, and to then return one of the previously caught fish if a better one is later caught."
3271386,LOW1,2014-10-29 11:54:00,2828,And there are special rules for nonresidents in border waters. At first glance the rules appear very complicated but once you know where you will be fishing at they are much more understandable.
3271466,FloridaRigger,2014-10-29 12:22:00,335,are you responding to my post? I never said it was an excuse. Just a lot of people are ignorant and it probably happens a lot more than you'd think.
3271762,MrSimon,2014-10-29 14:41:00,922,"This has been an educational thread for me. I didn't realize that the possession limit was not additive. It makes complete sense though - I just hadn't really thought about it since I never take fish home. Interestingly, on my 7 day fly-in this year, my group probably killed 60 fish and ate them throughout the week, legally. If the group who got fined all that money didn't eat any fish during their stay, they actually killed LESS fish than my group did. I don't disagree with the laws how they are written ..... its just interesting to think about."
3271834,Fishing nut,2014-10-29 15:21:00,95,"I don't understand why people do this. If you need the fish for food...don't go to Canada. Put the money toward your family. I love catch and release. Makes me feel good knowing all those fish are still there. If there really biting I like to try new baits, colors and ways of catching them."
3271882,JayM5209,2014-10-29 15:45:00,1050,"The way I understand the regs., if the season is open for the fish already retained you can continue to fish - catch and release - if no additional fish are retained. This is based on the following language excerpted from the 2014 regs. (page 7). The underlining for emphasis was added by me:_____________________Generally, daily catch limits include all fish that are retained for any period of time and not immediately released. The catch limit is the number of fish you are allowed to catch and keep in one day and includes fish that are not immediately released and any fish eaten or given away.The possession limit is the number you are allowed to have in your possession on hand, in cold storage, in transit, or anywhere. Possession limits are the same as one day's catch limit except where otherwise specified. _______________________LOW1, no argument from me on anything you're said on this subject, although we may have slightly differing opinions on what penalties should be imposed in certain instances."
3271898,port1042,2014-10-29 15:48:00,509,"I go to Onterio twice each year, spring and fall. When I'm there, I eat fish. When I come home, I come home with a limit. I keep, either to bring home or eat, smaller fish. I feel no remorse or guilt in doing this. I'm always within the legal limits. When I home I enjoy a of couple of fish fries with family and friends. I buy a sportsman's license rather than a conservation license so I keep get enough fish to do that. Anyone object to that? Now, here's a puzzle for you. My fishing partner and I can make a great meal out of one 24"" northern or out of 3 14"" walleye (or 3 13"" small mouths). Which is the more responsible choice?"
3271922,3M TA3,2014-10-29 15:57:00,2846,Don't understand your question. Responsible choice is to consume what you kill.
3271930,Obabikon,2014-10-29 15:57:00,2370,"This would be different in every area. Depends on fish population across the board. For our area of LOTW's... Ranking by easiest to replace... 3 - 14"" walleye 1 - 24"" northern 3 - 13"" small mouth The walleye and Northern are very close, and if you go up to Obabikon Lake, they would reverse. SM are by far the most difficult to replace in our area."
3271122,Kartman35,2014-10-29 09:09:00,245,Am I the only one who finds it weird that four guys with fifty fish were 40 fish over their limit? So 4 guys are allowed 10 fish? There must be something wrong with the story or else this jurisdiction has a limit of 2 and a half fish per person...
3271138,tparker,2014-10-29 09:16:00,100,Sounds like 3 conservation limits (2) and 1 regular limit (4).

3271210,LOW1,2014-10-29 10:07:00,2828,"True, but at the same time the anglers' intent should be considered in determining the sentence. If they only killed their combined limit of ten walleye per day and stored them for five days, in my opinion they are far less culpable than if they had killed all fifty in one day. Why? Because they did not deplete the resource more than what was permitted. Instead, they only accumalated what they were permitted to kill and if they had eaten what they killed instead of accumulating it there would be no problem or violation. People who kill more than permitted should be punished much harsher than people who merely store their legally killed game, in my opinion."
3271218,Lovetofish,2014-10-29 10:13:00,458,"So your saying they drove from Indiana all the way to Canada and didn't eat a fish?? Sorry, I'm not buying that."
3271234,LOW1,2014-10-29 10:20:00,2828,"No, I am saying that we don't know what they did, that people who kill in excess of their limit are more culpable than people who do not, and that people should be sentenced based upon the proven facts of their particular case."
3271274,JayM5209,2014-10-29 10:48:00,1050,"Except that they DID kill fish in excess of their legal limit. Everywhere I've fished in NW Ontario the possession limit is the same as the daily limit. So, if a member of the party in question had a sportsman license and had a limit of four fish in his/her possession - whether in the boat, in the fish house freezer, or in the cabin refrigerator - keeping a fifth fish is illegal, even if that 5th fish was caught the next day. Sure, the 5th fish was not over the daily limit, but it sure was over the possession limit and should be charged and prosecuted as the crime it is.Am I missing or not understanding something?P.S. It would be very, very hard to convince me that this event was just a mistake or just being unaware of the rules. Any group fishing in Ontario for a week - even if the 1st time ever - that has that many fish over the legal limit knows full well what they were doing. The penalties imposed were not excessive, regardless of the circumstances or the stories told as a defense."
3271298,MrSimon,2014-10-29 11:05:00,922,"Clarification question here ....If my conservation license says I can keep 3 fish per day. Can I fish for 5 days, keep 3 each day, and go home with 15 fish? Assuming I didn't eat or kill any other fish on the trip."
3271330,bigwalleye1,2014-10-29 11:24:00,2632,"Others may weigh in, but in Ontario, I believe conservation license allows you to be in possession of 2 fish at any given point. You can keep two, eat them for dinner, go out the next day and catch and eat 2 more, but when you leave for home, you'd be best served by not carrying more than 2 fish. You DO NOT get a limit for each day to vbe added to the previous day's posession."
3268554,Pezman38,2014-10-28 08:13:00,3196,Perhaps the lodge asked the conservation officer to stop by? I know when I used to go the camp owner never checked the freezer and never visited us in the cleaning house. Hopefully that is because he trusts our group who had been going to the same lodge collectively for 100+ years. Perhaps he did it after hours to be less noticeable but pretty sure the lodge isn't responsible for patrolling the freezer.
3268586,Obabikon,2014-10-28 08:20:00,2370,"Someone empties the fish guts though, right?"
3268650,Pezman38,2014-10-28 08:37:00,3196,"Yes they do, but there are many more things to check for besides quantity, the chain we fish has a under 18"" requirement for walleye and similar requirement on pike under 30"" I think (don't quote me). So if you are over your limit, and all the fish were too big the penalty should be more severe IMO.A fish over in both categories is allowed but highly frowned upon and something we always honored."
3269010,Moondog,2014-10-28 10:38:00,362,"This person, in the Gull Rock case, lost gear but lawyered out for $1500. Easily had 20 maybe 30 walleye over and unknown harvesting of large northern. He also lost his license for ONE YEAR. You can bet if this dude shows up again in camp that there will be plenty of ""tips."" In hindsight there is reason to believe that this has been going on for years with this same individual. It is also this kind of person that does have the cojones to come back and pretend he did nothing wrong."
3269026,Lovetofish,2014-10-28 10:46:00,458,Wouldn't be surprised if the poached fish were cleaned out on the lake and brought back in a cooler.
3269114,Moondog,2014-10-28 11:20:00,362,Apparently this guy would wait until the fish house and gut buckets were cleaned and then cleaned fish after everyone was in bed and throw the stuff in the lake. Then he would take the cleaned fish fill his freezer and then put his paper sacks full under everyone else's fish and groceries that were in the community freezer. You know..........you just don't expect people to be like this.
3269610,unclepaully,2014-10-28 15:21:00,112,"I would say the fine was very just. For comparison, here in Michigan these guys poached over 22,000 lbs of walleye in one winter and they estimate up to 72,000 lbs from 2004-2009.

They are brothers John Schwartz of Gladstone, Andrew Schwartz, and Kevin Schwartz, both of Rapid River. The three tribal members were found guilty on 79 of 105 civil infractions, including illegally setting nets in Little Bay de Noc to catch walleye, taking thousands of pounds of fish out of the lake, and selling them for profit through a tribal commercial fishing operation and a state-licensed wholesaler. In addition to the guilty verdict, the court ordered fines and costs totaling $13,175, four snowmobiles and nets forfeited, and a permanent revocation of their fishing licenses. The charges stemmed from an investigation by the state Department of Natural Resources and Environment (DNRE), which alleged that five Sault tribe members and one non-native were illegally catching and selling walleye caught in Little Bay de Noc in early 2009. The DNRE conducted a yearlong investigation before citing the suspects in March 2009. In accordance with the 2000 Consent Decree, a legal agreement among the state, the federal government and five Michigan tribes, the tribal members were turned over to the tribe for prosecution. The Tribe has a deep respect for our natural resources and what the Earth gives us, said Sault Tribe Chairman Joe McCoy. We respect the court's decision and hope this will deter others from abusing the law and the environment. The 2000 Consent Decree recognizes and affirms the tribe's rights under the Treaty of 1836 to fish in the ceded waters of the three upper Great Lakes. Tribes covered by the agreement have the authority and responsibility to prosecute members who fish illegally in the treaty area.http://www.stignacenews.com/news/201..._de_Noc_F.html"

After any sort of spill or other man made environmental accident damages need to be assessed and there are formulas for doing so. In Michigan there is a professor at MSU, Dr. Frank Lupi, who has a specialty in the economics of natural resources and in designing surveys to figure out the values of fish species, birds etc. I'm sure every state has its own baseline numbers for the value of walleye and no doubt the provinces do to. You have to remember that the value of a 30"" walleye may be very high to you and me but next to nothing to the golfer next door. The average value across society is where the law has to base its fines, no matter how low that might seem to us."
3270522,FloridaRigger,2014-10-28 21:05:00,335,"believe it or not most people are unaware of possession limits. the devil's lake poacher story was posted on the Wired2Fish Facebook page (a predominantly bass fishing site) and most of the comments were confused and upset that they got in trouble. they all thought it was ok as long as you didnt go over your daily limit. I'll admit that I was unaware as well, although I rarely keep fish."
3270994,walleye22,2014-10-29 08:01:00,59,It is YOUR job and responsibility to know the limits and the rules and regulations. Your camp owner knows these laws and will give them to you. Holy Sh*t I can not believe a grown adult even posted that as a valid or even possible excuse. F'in Dummy.
3267138,Mike Borger,2014-10-27 13:38:00,1554,Good question.
3267562,67ZL1,2014-10-27 17:42:00,277,I was going to ask this very same question earlier this aft. I would find it hard to believe that the lodge was unaware that four of their guests had 40 walleye in their freezer. Unless if the freezer was in the customer's cabin or room. Regardless the lodge should make it clear to their clients about catch limits and possession limits. Either way the anglers should have known the rules regardless.
3267626,WalleyeMatt,2014-10-27 18:05:00,93,"I hope gear means their boat also so they are unable to fish anymore unless they swim. Also I hope their fishing privileges are taken for life. They do not deserve any. Yes, we should be thankful the Canadians allow us the privilege to fish there. Matt"
3268042,Moondog,2014-10-27 21:49:00,362,Same type of thing happened at Gull Rock in 2012. The person was so effing arrogant!!! Really pissed me off. Had large northern cut up in pieces frozen and an unknown large number of walleye over the limit. I really felt bad for the MNR officer having to take all that crap off this guy and then he got off easy in court. The camp operator may have tipped off the MNR and if this guy has the balls to come back? Well.......he better be ready. Too many people saw and were not happy. Another case of ENTITLEMENT.....ah.........need I say more?
3268106,Juls,2014-10-28 03:40:00,13414,Words to live by..... This sign was hanging in the main lodge at the camp we stayed at this past August.
3268218,Richard B,2014-10-28 05:46:00,735,"These people are thieves! They should be fined $500 for each fish and then thrown in jail for 5 to 10 years. They are stealing from the public. Why do the courts allow them to pay a small fine and then let them go? Do they really believe that these individuals care about a fine or taking of their fishing or hunting license? These types of individuals, I am not talking about an individual or group 1 fish over, do not care about the laws and should be punished severely!"
3268338,JAY221,2014-10-28 06:44:00,877,"If the punishment does not include being banned from entry in to Canada it isn't enough in my opinion! Later, Jay"
3268354,MrSimon,2014-10-28 06:49:00,922,"Slow down there partner. A $2,500 fine and loosing all your fishing gear (could be worth thousands) is a fair and just punishment for first time offenders (maybe they did it before, but maybe they didn't). I'm sure their ride back to Indiana was not fun. Jail for 5-10 years?!?!?!? Really? You want to ruin lives and families because of a freezer full of fish. Lets keep things in perspective."
3268386,Jatar,2014-10-28 06:52:00,169,"$10,000.00 - Could'a bought a lot of fillets at Border Bob's"
3268434,Obabikon,2014-10-28 07:08:00,2370,"I actually think the fine was right on. They're paying $250 per fish over, AND lost all their fishing gear. Walleye run $10-$15 per pound at border bobs (3 fish). So, if they'd all just bought those fish... it would have been less than $200 worth of fillets. Instead they paid 10k and lost all their gear. As far as resort culpability... like mentioned in the Gull Rock situation, it wouldn't surprise me if there was a ""tip""."
3266714,Blue Lk,2014-10-27 09:42:00,269,Hopefully these guys never come back.http://www.ckdr.net/news/93644587/an...er-legal-limit
3266794,walleye22,2014-10-27 10:08:00,59,I love it. I hope they never get back in to fish the beauty that is Canada. Glad they got caught. People that do not respect the laws of natural resources are NOT true outdoor people.
3266834,Mike Kansas,2014-10-27 10:37:00,1463,I'm afraid that this type of thing happens to many times without people being caught. It is a total show of disrespect for the entire fishing industry and should be dealt with harshly. We were Sauger fishing on the Mississippi River a few years back and noticed two guys who were keeping everything . We turned their boat number into the Warden and he called us back later telling us that they had over 400 Sauger in their freezer. They should have lost lifetime fishing privileges and I know they got their bank accounts tapped pretty good. Mike Kansas
3266874,walleye22,2014-10-27 10:49:00,59,"I don't want to get off on a soap box rant but it is not only keeping fish over limits but I cant stand when people do not respect anything about it. I cant stand littering. Cant stand watching people throw their smokes in the lake or cigars. Little things like that just wear me out. Was fishing up on gullrock a few years back by myself as usual and there were like 3 boats tied up and jigging and catching fish. they were drinking which is fine but were throwing their smokes in the lake and if they caught a fish they would take it off and chuck over their shoulder back into the lake and crap like that. I finally had enough and went over and told them to respect the fish, the fishing and mother nature herself a little more. Doubt they cared but I believe in karma."
3266898,bigwalleye1,2014-10-27 10:53:00,2632,"Hopefully Canada won't LET em come back. Too bad the law was so lenient on them. One over may be agrued as a mistake. At some point, it's definitely intentional, and the punishment should go accordingly. Perhaps $2500 per fish....."
3266978,Knoxabilly,2014-10-27 11:32:00,225,That's disgusting- who thinks they can do that?
3267010,troutwater,2014-10-27 11:46:00,299,"I hate to hear of this happening, especially since I'm an American. The Canadian people and government is kind enough to let us come visit and use their natural resources...we should all respect them."
3267058,castnblast,2014-10-27 12:42:00,111,"I was born, raised and live in Canada and have been an avid angler as long as I can remember. NOTHING pisses me off more than that."
3267074,phishfearme,2014-10-27 12:48:00,1242,does the lodge have any culpability here?
3267130,Lovetofish,2014-10-27 13:24:00,458,"5 people from Wisconsin poached 100 walleye from Devils Lake this summer. Article said they were fined $1,750. Happens way to much."
