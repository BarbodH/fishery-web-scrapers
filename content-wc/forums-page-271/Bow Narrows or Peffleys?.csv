573089,Guest,2008-04-24 17:35:00,0,"Went to Peffleys a couple of years ago. The cabins are great and the view of the lake is beautiful. If you want to catch fish though, Peffleys is not the place to go. My son caught an 18"" smallie off of the dock and Dave told him to throw it back. He also tried to overcharge us on our cabin. I have not been to the other resort you mentioned so I can't comment on it. I do fish the Mahkwa side of the lake and it can't be beat, maybe I'm just spoiled cause of that."
573093,Guest,2008-04-24 21:24:00,0,"Just curious as to the ""Mahkwa"" side of Wabaskang Lake. Fished this lake for many years and have NO idea what you are talking about. There is a resort on Lac Seul called Mahkwa."
573094,Guest,2008-04-25 00:09:00,0,You are right. Mahkwa is on Lac Seul. I guess when I think of that area you can be on one side of the highway and fish Wabaskang or the other side of the highway and fish Lac Seul. My bad. The point remains.....Wabaskang is the dead sea.

Sounds like your doing well, haven't thrown crankbaits on the main lake much, we're usually there in late Sept and Jig/minnow combinations work well as the big walleyes seem to be very deep then, hard to get them baits down to 35-40 foot..:) When I get back up there I'll have to try cranks in the evening, it is fun using them. Got a friend who fishes the tourny up there, he has a place on McKenzie (sp?) island, great lake and we thought of getting a cabin, but just to far for us to use on the weekends. Good luck on building the cabin. Al"

572670,Donald,2008-04-07 21:31:00,1,"Have been searching for boat-in fishing in the Red Lake country for a 2009 trip for the opener as well as a trip again in August. After much research and archives work here, have narrowed to these camps. Anyone have experiences with either Bow Narrows or Peffleys (good or bad) that you'd like to share? Price is pretty much equal for housekeeping plans at both places. I'm wondering about numbers of fish (more than size) and also overall quality of the camp and cabins. Thanks in advance for any advice or info you can offer!"
572688,Guest,2008-04-08 21:05:00,0,Bow Narrows is my pick. I started fishing that end of Red Lake last year and plan on spending alot of time out there this summer.
572691,Guest,2008-04-09 08:33:00,0,"I have been going to Peffleys for seventeen years now and can pretty much guarantee the following statements. (1) The quality of fish in Wabaskang for size, numbers and variety is quite remarkable and very consistent year after year. They believe in and promote catch and release of the larger trophies. Dave is very knowledgeable of the lake and takes time to go over or show you exactly where to fish. If Dave is not around ask any of his guests and they will also help put you on fish. The friendly atmosphere of Dave and his guests makes you feel right at home. (2) Both weeks you have selected are excellent fishing weeks. (3) While Daves cabins may not be the newest cabins in the area, they are the cleanest. We fish out of 14 and 16 foot Naden boats powered with 15 and 20 hp. Yamaha. Boats are super clean when you get them and I have never had a problem with my motor. Don't know the price of the other camp but it's hard to beat Peffleys price for everything you get. Good luck and good fishing to you."
572696,stevensinks,2008-04-09 11:24:00,330,We are going to Bow Narrows the 8th of June. This will be our first trip to the camp and to Red lake. If you guys have any tips for us it would be great. Thanks

572706,Guest,2008-04-09 16:32:00,0,"Now Tackleman, an old Red Laker like yourself don't need any lessons you probably catch more walleyes in 1 day using that Gullrock tackle, then I catch in a whole season. By the way did you sign up for the 09 fall classic. I just got back in town and went in to sign up I'm boat 72 it won't take long to fill up at that rate."

572790,Guest,2008-04-12 14:26:00,0,"I would agree. We have been going to Peffley's Camp for 14 years. Eleven years under former ownership and all three years owned by Dave Peffley. We have continued to return to this camp for the total package. Excellent multi-species fishing located close to the camp, with clean accommodations, great service and at a reasonable price for a wilderness camp. Like us, there are many repeat guests of this camp and for a good reason."
572874,Guest,2008-04-15 09:11:00,0,"heading up to bow narrows, have the option of going either in mid june or august. anyone with a recomendation of which one would be better fishing, and what can we expect for size and numbers, thanx."
573060,sidewinder,2008-04-23 06:51:00,96,have not been on in a while. Probably because i do not have any current plans for going to canada this year. So I do not want to listen to guys talking about fishing. Been to Peffleys once Wine Lake once. Dave was great host and I considered it a great value. Seemed like most boats were coming from south end and fishing up in the north end. I would pick end you want to fish the most. Sounds like you cannot make a bad decision so pick and fish.
