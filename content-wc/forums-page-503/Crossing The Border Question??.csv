1277239,outdoorsron,2011-03-02 17:11:00,843,"Hello: Your figures come out to 28.5 beers a day for a 7 day week. Why don't you drunks just stay home and drink, hope you don't show up at the resorts I go to. I pray that you guys aren't out drinking and driving. That could turn a vacation in to a disaster for you and possibly some one else. O - R."
1277245,SinOrSwim,2011-03-02 17:20:00,1528,"We FLY-IN. Not sure where we are going to go ""drinking and driving"". And because we fly in I'm guessing you don't have to worry about us being at your lake. But, take your 28 beer average and take out cans for beer batter, spills, some get warm and poured out and then the extra we usually end up with and it's nowhere near your 28 number. Now, take that number and factor it into a huge range of hours from morning to late at night playing poker and there is a lot of time in between. Like I said, we aren't the type of group that fishes from the time we wake up until late at night. It's the whole experience for us. A group of guys/family getting together to do some fishing, relaxing and gambling. Whats the word...........vacation."
1277247,outdoorsron,2011-03-02 17:26:00,843,As drunk as you guys would be you probably do spill a lot. Just kidding. Have fun on your fly in. I lost a very good friend to a drunk driver and I guess thats why I get so upset. Good Luck O - R
1277276,MorganMan,2011-03-02 18:17:00,341,"There is a limit I think. I know a group that was told they may need a liquor license?? I don't know how serious that was. Otherwise, do the math. Depending on where you buy your beer and the deal you get, it's cheaper to take it and pay duty. If you can get it at Sam's club and keep cost down, then that's the way to go. Expect to get searched also."
1277297,JinxCanada,2011-03-02 19:05:00,1306,"you do but for alcohol (rum etc) it's around 40 liters before you need an import permit and licence. not sure how much beer, but it would be a lot"
1277379,Pikehunters,2011-03-03 04:47:00,100,"Hit the nail on the head sinorswim! We are actually gone for 9 nights 10 days that changes the math. Also at a fly in with the only cabin on the lake. there is no drinking & driving envolved, get there safe have a good time & arrive home safe if there is a problem with that than i guess i have a problem & will continue to have problems for a very long time!!. Ever have beer batter pancakes or Beer batter french toast We will be bringing the beer across with us & paying our share of duty & taxes as required."
1277469,ohiojmj,2011-03-03 08:14:00,1262,"I bring several cases Labatts from Ohio because it's $17.50, plus tax, no deposit and I can save time and skip the duty free on the way up. I also bring a bottle of liquor. While over the limit, I always claim it and they never make me pay at the Peace Bridge in Buffalo. On the way back, i buy the 3 pack of Crown Royal at duty free shop, claim it, never pay duty. Relatives in Buffalo go visit for 1/2 day and bring 3 duty free bottles home. Modest excess is apparently tolerated.Beer at the beer stores is outrageous."
1274674,fishman10,2011-02-24 10:11:00,226,"30 cases, wow that is something even compared to canadian standards. do you guys need a guide?"
1274752,Guest,2011-02-24 13:23:00,0,"I believe there is a limit. We were stopped and detained for about an hour because the 2 of us had 2 liters of Vodka and 10 cases of beer. We were told we were over the limit, then we said we were buying for guys following that evening and they let us through. We had to pay the duty of course. When we cross at Fort Francis, we buy our beer at the duty free shop. You get 5 cases for the price of 4 and then you pay the duty. It works out to be under $20 a case for Moosehead, Labatts Blue or kokanee, your preference. Whenever I've bought in Canada its been $35 to $40/case. Big savings at the Duty Free Store and you get to drink Canadian when in Canada."
1274770,SimilarIsland,2011-02-24 14:16:00,121,"Yep, we do the same. Pretty hard to beat. During the season, they're open at 5 am on Saturday also."
1274842,Pikehunters,2011-02-24 17:42:00,100,"I followed the link & called on the taxes & duty that is charged. WOW for a $19.00 per case, not a 30 pack understand all that, it was $25.00 additional to bring across. A little bit excessive in my eyes!! It forces people to take a chance & attempt to get away with it & yes if you get caught your done not going fishing & that sucks!! Bottom line if your gonna play your gonna pay, guess I'll just put a little more $$$$ away"
1275015,Jack77,2011-02-25 08:45:00,168,"My experience was that it ends up costing about the same as buying it in Canada, which is the whole point of charging the duties and taxes in the first place. A lot of the time they figure that while they have you pulled over to pay the duties and taxes they might as well use that time to fill their quota of inspections."
1275136,NARDA 1,2011-02-25 13:34:00,636,Call Duty Free Americas in International Falls 218-283-2556. They should be able to tell you everything you need to know plus they might offer some kind of discount on that amount.
1276897,JinxCanada,2011-03-01 22:33:00,1306,you will NOT be turned back if you lie and are caught. your alcohol will be seized and you will not get it back...but that alone is not enough reason to turn you back to the USA. please get your facts straight.
1276907,SinOrSwim,2011-03-02 02:09:00,1528,"Technically there isn't anything wrong with what you are doing but you might get hassled at the border. We take a lot of beer with us every year. What amounts to 1 case (24) per person per day. This is for a night before and a 5 day trip. We use beer for beer batter, we drink playing poker in the cabin and there are ALWAYS those full beers in the morning when at some point you though it was a good idea to open one and then decided against it. We are on vacation and while we love to fish aren't they type of group that fishes from sun up to midnight. Anyway, we have had a year (maybe last year???) they tried to tell us we needed a liquor license to bring that much beer. Eventually, somone who wasn't being a dick took over our process and we paid our fee and were on our way. We have been searched plenty of times to verify we were actually bringing that much beer for that many guys. Some may think that is a lot but we plan for extra because when you fly-in you can't just pop down to the corner store for another case if you run out. We have never really figured out how/what they charge. Been going for 16 or 18 years now. But, it is definitely cheaper to take with you and pay the duty. Not to mention if you happen to cross at an odd time the beer stores have weird hours. Have fun and I'm glad to finally see there is someone else taking as much beer as we do. LOL Oh, and I guarantee you someone at the border crossing will say something along the lines of .............have fun...if you remember it.......lol Happens everytime."
1276963,tv4fish,2011-03-02 07:32:00,2694,"Thank you Jinx for providing the CORRECT information - I think the same is true if you bring in ANYTHING that you are not supposed to (bait, cigars, etc.). I'm sure there ARE some things this will NOT apply to though."
1277091,Pikehunters,2011-03-02 11:48:00,100,Good to see we are not alone. nothing wrong with a toast at the dock before a morning fish. Maybe two if the weather is good. Don't forget about the days sitting at the table waiting for the thunder storms to pass before getting on the water. either way bringing it wiht us buying it up there the beer is going in & a good time will be had!!
1274274,GNO,2011-02-23 07:49:00,153,"I believe you are allowed 1 duty free and then can pay duty on up to 5 cases per person. If you paid $19 per case, and add $10 for duty, you are at Canadian prices. Bottles are $30 and cans are $35 now. Plus, a 30 pk does not count as a case, a case is 24. That means you will be bringing 50 - 24 pks, 6 duty free, and paying duty on 44 cases. It might be worth it to you, but if there is a long line inside to pay duty the extra time might not be. The other thing is if anybody in the group has a previous DUI, it will definately be brought up if you bringing in that much beer creating another delay."
1274294,camp chef,2011-02-23 08:45:00,915,Not that it is any skin off my nose but bringing beer TO Canada would be like bringing frozen fish along for a shorelunch. I'm just sayin'
1274413,Pikehunters,2011-02-23 15:19:00,100,"I will bring the info to the group. Wanted to check on current pricing by the case & glad tgo see that the pricing has droped, wish fuel prices would drop like that!! No DUI's in the group so we are safe there, just trying to save a buck but also pay our dues for entering the providence. Keep info coming & thanks"
1274429,hogridnfool,2011-02-23 16:01:00,349,"You are allowed 24 - 120z cans/bottles (1 case) of beer or 1 - 40oz container of booze per person (http://gocanada.about.com/od/canadat...quorborder.htm) anything over that and you will have to pay duty and provincial taxes. When you are asked if you have any liquor tell the truth about the amount. If you are searched and found to be untruthful you will be turned back. For more info use the contact button on the Canadian Border Services Agency website, http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/ Not directed at you Pikehunters; I see you have every intention to pay the required fees."
1274435,hogridnfool,2011-02-23 16:11:00,349,Frozen fish! Why didn't I think of that. I've been bringing a can of Tuna to shore lunch. (maybe?)
1274437,Moondog,2011-02-23 16:22:00,362,Another consideration.......the additional weight of all that beer is going to cost you at the pumps. We bought Lakeport last year at the beer store and I think 24 bottles was around $24.
1274536,scotttheguide,2011-02-23 20:56:00,73,"You know that you cannot have beer in the boat, right? With 6 Guys that is a lot of beer to drink at the end of the day, how long do you plan on being in Canada? Better be careful, the fines are not cheap. 40 30 packs, thats 29 beers per person/per day on a 7 day trip...wow!Have fun, bottoms up"
1274556,Gale Johnson,2011-02-23 23:07:00,577,"One time i went to Minnesota and we averaged over a case of Grainbelt Premium per person, per day(fishing sucked on that trip) i thought the fishing was better in Canada so you might not need that much beer, or you could just stay in Minnesota and get really ripped for cheaper just joking with ya, have a good time, sounds like a fun trip with the guys"

I don't think there is a law about fying under the influence We will fly in 25 cases for the wwek in the bush. The rest is for the night before & the night before we get home. Its a vaca no rush up & definetly no rush to get back!!Love the quote about frozen fish GOOD ONE!!!"
1274594,Reels,2011-02-24 06:30:00,2876,"They do not charge you per case, kinda.... They charge duty on what you paid for it. Example. I bring busch light and told them I paid 12 bucks a case, I paid duty on that price. Brother brought Heinekin and said he paid 30 bucks a case, he paid duty on the 30 bucks for ea case over. A huge difference. They have never asked us for receipts, just how much we paid for it. Same goes for the vodka we bring. So, if you bring a bottle of crown royal and a case of bud, pay the duty on the bud and claim the expensive stuff as your allotment."
1274096,Pikehunters,2011-02-22 17:16:00,100,We are crossing the border with 6 & need to bring 40 ~ 30 packs of beer. All intentions of stopping to pay the duty tax as required. Question is there a limit of cases allowed to take across while paying the duty tax ?????
1274100,3M TA3,2011-02-22 17:24:00,2846,YEP. yOUR VEHICLE HAS TO BE ABLE TO CARRY IT
1274148,JinxCanada,2011-02-22 19:13:00,1306,"yes there are limits...please call the liquor control board of Ontario. after a certain amount you need an import permit, but I'm not sure how much it is."
1274159,Glenman12,2011-02-22 19:47:00,762,if that is for a 1 week trip then all I can say is wow!!!
1274165,Mark R,2011-02-22 19:55:00,1538,we bring three 24 can cases per man when we go and no problems.
1274170,walleye4life,2011-02-22 20:01:00,54,"You shouldn't have any problems, but check with the border service to make sure you are A OK."
1274209,walleye88ia,2011-02-22 21:47:00,35,"labatts blue or kokanne is better than american beers. (busch light sucks). buy in canada,pay a little more, its much better, and its on vacation and no duty!"
1274228,Jack77,2011-02-23 01:45:00,168,Do the math before you go. Once you add in the duty and taxes you end up paying almost as much per case as you do in Canada.
1274237,Pikehunters,2011-02-23 04:55:00,100,The math is easy I plow a beer distributor for a case per plow. Currently 43 plows . Price for a 30 pack is $19.00. I ordered beer 3 years ago & paid $45.00 for a case of 24. I could be wrong & feel free to correct me but duty & tax is $10.00 per case ???. Great info this site is great Thank you in advance!!
1274258,v-bay gord,2011-02-23 07:00:00,3168,A case of Labatts Blue (bottles) is $30. Just remember beer in cans is more expensive in Ontario than the same stuff in bottles. Plus there is a $2.40 deposit on the cans...or the bottles.
