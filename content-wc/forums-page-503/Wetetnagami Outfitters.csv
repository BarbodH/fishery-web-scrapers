Lake Wetetnagami is located North East of Senneterre, Quebec. Does anyone have any insight or feedback on the lake or outfitter?This is our first trip to the area...we typically fish the Clova Road areaThanks,Cbass"

Did you see the pics of the 17 1/4 lb 38 incher, apparently last year was the time for huge fish - many fish over ten were taken. This lake is an amazing fishery with many options."
1279496,Cbass42,2011-03-08 08:07:00,2,"Thanks McQ and Mondo,We are very much looking forward to the trip. Father, brothers and I have been booking our Northern Quebec trip for 15 plus years running now...it never gets old and the excitement is always the same. McQ, I did read your report and appreciated how detailed it was...sounds like two trips in one...lake fishing and river fishing. We are booked at Camp Julien which is at the mouth of the South river. Do you have a PM email address? Since it is a large body of water with so many options, I was hoping to chat more about technique, what to look for out on the water, potential starting points...etc. Thanks in advance guys for the help, we really appreciate it !Cbass"
