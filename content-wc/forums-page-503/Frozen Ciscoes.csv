1278755,midwest,2011-03-06 14:16:00,25,"Thanks for the info. It says smelt may not be used as bait, but no reference to cisco for zone 4. The general regulation list cisco as a legal bait. I'm assuming since they are not listed specifically as prohibited on the zone 4 regs that they are in fact legal. It alsos states that it is illegal to bring any live fish in as bait, but no references to frozen fish. From the way I read the regulations, it would be legal to cross the border with frozen ciscoes and use them as bait in zone 4. If anyone has any different thought, please share them. Thanks"
1278803,plumberjoe,2011-03-06 16:21:00,54,We bring frozen shiners from home and they work for both the trout and the northern in the spring. Usually have enough left from icefishing throughout the winter.
1279070,Mohleye,2011-03-07 09:51:00,368,"My recollection from researching this in the past and discussion on this forum, was that it was illegal to bring frozen cisco across the border. At the very least, you might have a hassle convincing the agent they are cisco rather than smelt, as they look very similar. Personally I would just buy it on the Canadian side, and I wouldn't bother with it at all unless you want some for trout fishing."
1279148,midwest,2011-03-07 12:31:00,25,I tried to get some last trip and could not find any in Canada. We cross the border at 2 am and nothing is open at that time. The bait shop in Soiux Lookout did not have them.
1279171,Mohleye,2011-03-07 13:18:00,368,"That makes it tough. Maybe ask your campowner? He may know a source. Not that you asked, but that Ft Frances-Dryden trip is a little iffy in the wee hours. Lots of moose and a long way from help if you have a breakdown or other issue. Not trying to preach, we did it many times when we were young and bulletproof."
1279177,midwest,2011-03-07 13:35:00,25,"Yeah, 502 is definately the worst part of the trip. We came real close on a bear once, but luckily no moose encounters....yet. It just works out that way. I'd rather drive it in the dark and get to fish on Saturday, then to wait until daylight and not get to camp until the afternoon.I've got an email into the camp owner. I just like to have everything in my possession and control. We go the cheapest route possible with the camp. Seems like when we rely on others for things, they never show up."
1279198,Walleye_Wrangler,2011-03-07 14:42:00,138,We have bought them in Dryden before. Not sure of the name of the place but it is on the corner close to the paper mill. It is a small gas station that has fishing tackle.
1279354,steve03,2011-03-07 20:37:00,22,"I usually by some frozen ciscoe by the gas station across from the chocolate moose restaurant in International Falls, MN. I have used them for pike and have had some success with them. We go in the summer. When fishing is a little slower I like to have one out there to try and catch bigger fish. I believe they work better in the spring. Hope this is of some help."
1276417,midwest,2011-02-28 19:58:00,25,"Anyone have any experience crossing the border with frozen ciscoes? Wanted to give them a try this spring for big pike, and can't seem to find a place to buy them. Thanks"
1276438,Outfitter17,2011-02-28 20:32:00,127,"You can buy them at Sportsmans Service in I. Falls, right next to the ford dealership on your way through town towards the border. They always have the best ciscoes around."
1276445,Topwater,2011-02-28 20:47:00,484,What border? Some places they are readily availible in every gas station. Some places like the province of Alberta they are considered a sportfish so if you are caught useing them for bait they will slap your pee pee very hard. Steve

1277018,Walleye_Wrangler,2011-03-02 09:18:00,138,How successful have you been using them?
1277090,midwest,2011-03-02 11:47:00,25,So it is legal to cross the border with them?
1277416,Mr Ranger,2011-03-03 06:35:00,272,Be careful in that many areas no longer allow any cut bait. We used to use smelt for lakers that worked very well. Then they stopped that so we went to the Ciscos and were then told we could not use any cut bait directly from the officer. This was the Nakina area and know it does change by region. Cisco did not seem to work quite as well but only did it one year until we had to stop.
1277418,midwest,2011-03-03 06:42:00,25,"I wanted to use them on Minnitaki. I'd read about other people using them there on this forum, but the laws may have changed since then. Any know for sure?"
1278716,midwest,2011-03-06 10:47:00,25,Surely someone on this board knows the answer?
1278719,Mr Ranger,2011-03-06 11:06:00,272,"Hey Midwest, I don't have your direct answer but hopefully this might help. Here is the page for regulations. If you find the region you are in you can go from there. It took me some time to find our region but it was in their. Good luck!http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business...02_163615.html"
