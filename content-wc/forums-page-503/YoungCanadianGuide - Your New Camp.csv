We hope you don't think they were directed toward you.For sure, your family is prepared for success due to your experience and ready made bookings created by the overflow of your present camp. When are you going to change 15 to 16 in your profile?"
1279195,adempsey,2011-03-07 14:39:00,963,"If it's the camp I think it is, it already had a pretty good reputation as it is. With the addition of overflow from another popular place I don't think they will need to worry as much as other places would.I wish them all the best and am sure it will be successful."
1279256,youngcanadianguide,2011-03-07 17:04:00,60,"Hey Golden Eagle,I know it wasn't directed towards me. I appreciate everyone who has helped me and I hope in the future everyone is still as helpful. As for the new camp I am scared but it's a good scared. Plus if I wasn't scared my dad would be more worried than he already is. My Dad is asking me questions to help me through this. Also, as much as my family has learned we all still learn more every year. This profession is never mastered. hahaha.One thing that does worry me is gas prices. My friends and I were talking about it today at school. It took my one friend $75 to fill his truck and I told him if you think it's expensive here, in Canada it costs about $1 to $1.50 a gallon more with conversion.Now on a lighter note I'm still looking for that daughter or granddaughter as a business partner. hahahahaI have been working to get my license as soon as my birthday comes on April 1st. I didn't think about it till now but maybe my parents are pulling the biggest April Fool's Joke on me with this new camp. I know that isn't true because the MNR just transferred the L.U.P.'s over.Thanks for all the good wishes for business and I have a few questions I will be asking later."

1279306,youngcanadianguide,2011-03-07 19:06:00,60,"Hey Golden Eagle,Hahahaha If you are saying that I need to find a cow moose I'm not quite that desperate yet."
1279307,Golden Eagle,2011-03-07 19:19:00,2642,We'll check you again in August.
