1263506,Northern Exposure,2011-01-21 08:45:00,29,"Have had good luck fishing some of the small bush lake located in the area but never fished Wawang. Whenever someone brings up this lake it seems to hit a nerve with the majority that have been there. Pakashkan is in the same area and I have heard alot better reviews for it but have not personally fished either lake. If you would like some info on the bush lakes up the road further I could get you some but there are no lodges or resorts on any of them, camping or day trips only."

I loved that it had hot running water and our own functional kitchen and bathroom. We went up in August two years ago and caught 12 northerns over 43"" and 17 over 37"" but below 43"" I tried my hand at walleye and was able to catch at least 15-20 per day and from what I have heard, that time of year is supposed to be difficult. The lake is crystal clear and I used common sense and figured I would find them in the deeper areas out of direct overhead sunlight and found to be successful The hosts were pretty good. Terry was often busy taking care of the grounds, so we often dealt with Tami. She was kind and knowledgeable about the lake and kept track of what had been caught and where to help us along. It is a small resort so it was easy to find her and get adequate service. Everyones taste is different and I didnt go up there to be waited on hand and foot, I went to fish and was successful! When I did my research, I checked out OFAH and realized pretty **** quick that they had pictures for almost every claim and I appreciated that they could back up some of the sizes. Truth be known, the fish are there but if you are a true fisherman, you will realize that it is a sport.....you cant expect to put your rod in and get something every time. If it were that easy, there wouldnt be such a selection of baits and and techniques. I was told by a few of my friends that are regular that if you are trying to hit, get in there early season and late season...temperatures are more accommodating to both species if not to us HAHA"
1279299,drlee,2011-03-07 18:49:00,409,"Just want to provide a couple of alternatives to Wawang. Let me confirm that I have NOT been to Wawang. However, my son has been there...he has fished a number of other northern Ontario lakes with and without me and says that Wawang is a place he will not re-visit. His group of six guys caught a fair number of northerns but nothing of any size. They caught virtually zero walleyes on Wawang. A portage lake was good walleye fishing, but they were limited on the number of visits they could make, charged extra, and discouraged from going beyond the area in the portage lake close to the entry point. In fact, they ignored the warning and caught most of their walleyes beyond the recommended area. His group had luke warm reports on the cabins and the relationship with the owners. (My son can walk into a bar and have 5 new best friends within 15 minutes.) I have fished at least 15 different lakes in northern Ontario over the past 25 years. I catch lots of fish. I would recommend the following camps, given my experiences... 1. Press Lake Camp 2. Austin's Wilderness Lodge on Lake Pashkokogan (no web site, but PM me) 3. Thaddeus Lake Lodge 4. Sleepy Dog Camp on Wabaskang 5. Lac Seul Lodge on Lac Seul I would highlight the following on each of the above camps... 1. The owners are really nice, honest, helpful people. 2. They are reasonably priced camps with no ""hidden"" costs. 3. The fishing is very good...but be patient...you have to learn a bit about the lake! 4. You can take your own boat, or not. Good boats are available at each camp. 5. The cabins are clean and comfortable. 6. You won't have people fishing right on top of you. 7. All are accessible with a standard vehicle, though some take longer to get to than others. 8. All have good populations of walleyes and northern pike. Muskies, perch, smallmouth, not so much. 9. All lakes are easy to navigate with the exception of Lac Seul...not a criticism, just a factor of size. 10. I would virtually guarantee that you would thoroughly enjoy any of the above!!! Feel free to contact me for more info on any of the camps I have recommended...and remember, there are probably lots of other great camps on great lakes...northern Ontario is a paradise. The Canadian people are the best! (The only down side is they like hockey and ice fishing.) Good Fishing!"
