The fellow who ran it (called himself ""Agate"" on WC) also teamed up to run another Canadian fishing web site. He had some very interesting posts on both sites, I was sorry to see it end. I spent some time at the camp (different owner)back in the early '70's - an adventurous part of the north woods. Bill"
