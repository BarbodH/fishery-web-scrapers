I just got a glimpse of it as we drove by, is this the Boston Pizza chain? We got reservations at the Super 8 this year after staying at the Red Dog the past couple of years. Ten years ago it was fun to stay at the red dog(cant recall the name now) and have a bite to eat and have a few drinks before we continue on the next day to our resort but last year was the place hit rock bottom. Used to enjoy their hot wings.What can you tell me about this Boston place? Hows the food? Is it a sports bar as well?"
1272882,KSauers,2011-02-19 14:28:00,385,Had pizza there last July and thought it was pretty good. Better than expected actually.

I have not eaten at the one in Fort Frances, but it should be pretty much the same as the ones I have eaten at. One side is usually a sports bar like, and another side a restaurant. It is a nice place to unwind and have a few drinks.Fisherman 1792"
