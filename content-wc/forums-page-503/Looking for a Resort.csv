Things have changed over the years and I will say each year gets better and better. Great lake that takes time to learn and once you do the fishing just gets better. The size of fish have grown over the years with the slot size. Sure you can want to try something different but don't base your experience on 15 years ago. I have been going to Eagle since about 76 and the last 10 years we have been going to Vermilion Bay and like I said it gets better with each passing year."
1278479,balsl6,2011-03-05 17:05:00,426,Check out this website. It is a great area to fish and you can fish Mn or Canada. All the resorts on this site will treat you pretty good. Sportsmans has Eagle ridge cabins that are lower cost and secluded so you are on your own. Young's Bay resort is also a little cheaper than the resorts on the Islandshttp://www.lakeofthewoodsresorts.com/ Good Luck!

1278083,NathanH,2011-03-04 17:22:00,697,I am trying to plan a trip to Canada with my father next year. I wanted to get some suggestions for places to stay. I would be looking for the following:1. A drive in Resort. We would be coming from MN or WI so Ontario would be best.2. Walleye are a must3. Looking for good action and nice sized fish.4. Would like to keep the cost down so nothing too fancy. 5. It cannot be Eagle Lake. We had a bad trip about 15 years ago and stopped going to Canada. Thank you

1278125,SNOPRO,2011-03-04 18:51:00,108,"I've Been going to GullRock for the past eight years in late August and have never had a bad experience. The lake is an awsome walleye lake with big numbers of 20""+ fish. Lots of islands and bays for protection on breezy days. I stay at Golden Hook Camp. Very nice cabins, Great new docks, and a super fish cleaning house!!!!!!! Have a lot of other friends who stay at Poplar Point, Wrights wilderness Camp, and Five Lakes Resort. Don't think you could wrong with any camp on the lake cause the lake is that good!!!!!"
1278177,Robert Cardenas,2011-03-04 22:29:00,138,"I would suggest Bonny Bay Resort, www.bonnybay.com I have been going to this resort for the last 10 years with my family and every year gets better. Great cabins, nice boats if you want to rent instead of hauling your boat and price is very reasonable. Fishing is awesome. I went up there late Aug last year and will be up there first week in June this year, fishing was great in August and I know it is good in June. Its worth checking out. Its located in Dryden Ontario on Lake Wabigoon, this is where the PWT went two years in a row for there tournament."
