1278069,v-bay gord,2011-03-04 16:47:00,3168,Where are you heading to....and when?
1278088,Pikehunters,2011-03-04 17:29:00,100,Need reg. & insurance cards. Be careful don't get a bug to go on the trails without a permit. The fines are hefty
1278155,Catman59,2011-03-04 20:46:00,345,"Sturgeon Lake next Saturday. What do the consider ""trails"" ?"
1278212,Pikehunters,2011-03-05 04:55:00,100,"They have, in my opinion, the most advanced & best trail system for snowmobiling that I have ever seen or had the pleasure of riding on."
1278299,HighTech,2011-03-05 07:42:00,75,"Perhaps someone like V Bay can confirm, but I think as long as you are just fishing and have fishing equipment, you can travel to and from the lakes using any trail without a permit. That Is what I recall for residents, I am not sure about non resident. It's worth asking about."
