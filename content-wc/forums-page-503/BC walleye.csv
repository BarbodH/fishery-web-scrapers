1276636,BCKevo,2011-03-01 11:34:00,6,Where abouts in Wa are you located. Most walleye spots in BC are in the Northeast portion of the province which would make the journey a little long. I am from BC and have a few jewels in my hip pocket. But you know us walleye fishermen. we like to keep our secrets. There are a couple of good holes in washington as well that some folks do not consider as well.Kevin
