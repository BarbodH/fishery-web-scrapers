1275979,Guest,2011-02-27 17:15:00,0,I love going to Ontario every summer. Gas prices are scaring me to go back to Pickle Lake area. I do like more sheltered fishing- so what are people's thougths on fishing Rainy Lake verese Lake of the Woods? I am a walleye fisherman mostly- where is best area on LotW for end of July? Is going in out of Morson better than the Angle area? Can a person find sheltered fishing for walleyes on Rainy then? Many thanks for answers

It's about 15 miles west and 15 miles north of Fort Frances. I'll be there again early September.That part of Rainy has a multitude of islands and bays where you can get out of the wind or if you are good at boat control, hold on the calm side and fish the edge of the wind driven current. I've never been blown off that part of Rainy, but traveling from spot to spot could be fun.You might go to Google Earth and zoom in on the areas you think you might want to fish and get an idea of the amount of shelter you can expect to find.NimstugAlways thinking, always forgetting...."

But, thats the same for LOTW. If you launch in Morson, your about a 15 minute boat ride from some very good walleye fishing, thats next to a beautiful camping spot with a nice sheltered beach.Seriously, you could go either way on this decision, you can't lose.Just remember to bring a chip if your not familiar with the waters, both lakes can get some nasty weather/waves. However, some of that can be avoided on Rainy lake by launching towards Devlin instead of Fort Frances, it eliminates the majority of the boat ride as well. If you launch from North of Devlin(cant think of the name right now?), its about 5km boat ride to fish the north arm, which is far shorter than launching in Fort Frances.Hope that helps"
