1274834,wallydave,2011-02-24 17:24:00,2151,"Have you thought about crossing the border at night and staying in FF? My last trip we crossed on Friday night on our way to Ear Falls section of Lac Seul. Friday night crossing was a breeze, maybe one or two cars ahead of us. I have a room at the Rainbow Hotel in FF for this years trip back to Goose Bay. Saturday crossings can take a couple of hours. Good Luck!"
1274846,walleye4life,2011-02-24 17:49:00,54,"A good place to stay is between IFalls and the Iron Range in the town of Orr, MN. The Gateway Inn (former AmericInn) is quite nice."

1274880,Beagle_Nut,2011-02-24 18:56:00,52,"I second the vote for the motel in Cook, but we know it as the Country Store. Inexpensive and clean, only bad thing I could say is the proximity to the RR tracks and associated noise but we're usually so tired by the time we get there it's not an issue. Also if you want to eat at a restaurant other than McDonald's or Subway do that in Virginia or before."

1275203,lcwhit,2011-02-25 15:46:00,104,thanks guys. virginia will be about 10.5 hours for us. thats enough with women in the cars. my wife refuses to drive with me in the truck. no idea why. normally we do cross the border and stop in fort frances. even stay at the rainbow. thats gonna be a bit of a pull this july. we will probably do that when we go back up in august---all guys. thanks again. whit
1277266,MorganMan,2011-03-02 18:05:00,341,"I would recommend the Americinn or the Holiday Inn Express in Virginia. The Americinn is right on RR tracks too so might be issue, but its right next to great bar/restaurant ""Sawmill"". If noise is an issue, go with Holiday Inn Express. I know the Americinn is $80-90 and don't know the Holiday Inn. Orr Americinn is nice too....more than just a pool if you have kids with you. Slide and all."
