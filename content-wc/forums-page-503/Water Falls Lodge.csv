There are multiple cottages on the lakes and it does receive plenty of fishing. We did find medium sized walleye and some smallmouth, nothing to make us return. We also did get a few pike, again nothing fantastic. We fish structure around Lake Erie for smallmouth and had some success, but is was just tough. That said, one of the absolute highlights, was the ATV trip to an outpost smallmouth lake. Not only was the fishing very good, but the adventure itself was absolutely worth it. If you go, it is a tremendous setting, no question. Fishing on the lake at the lodge, fair. TAKE THE ATV TRIP! It was outstanding! GOOD FISHING!"

We did take the ATV trip and it was a good time, caught lots of fish. I would not go back, there are far better places to go in Ontario.P.S. we ended up leaving 2 days early"
