I think on a good spring or fall minnow bite it would work well. When I get out this spring I hope to catch em with it Manitou!"

1274870,cody123,2011-02-24 18:39:00,16,"in 2008 I emailed Canada MNR----game fish I keep, can I use scraps of those fish for bait-- Reply--example theye gave me--using a perch eye would be legal in most areas of the province but using the whole dead perch would not be legal. Google Canada MNR they have a site to ask questions. bk"

1276295,wallydave,2011-02-28 14:46:00,2151,I mostly fish the Ear Falls section of LS. Two tone chartreuse and orange jigs have always worked well! Minnows come with the cabin and boat package. Mostly I like the jigs with a walleye on the end
1276615,Leeches,2011-03-01 10:25:00,106,"Manitoubass, I haven't been lucky with gulp minnows, would sure like to use it more but just don't get the walleyes. Bass seem to like it I'm pitching it shallow with variety of jigs and retrieves, is it a time of year thing? What am I doin wrong? Thanx in advance manitou."
1276627,ManitouBass,2011-03-01 10:56:00,201,"I use the black shad color and they work great, even in stained water. I've tried some of the other colors though with absolutely no success.It might just depend on the body of water, each lake/river is different.I use a jigging retrieve, like cast out, let it hit bottom, then lightly jig with a slow retrieve back to the boat, and it works like a charm. They dont seem to work too well for me just jigging below the boat though, but thats just my experience."

The temps are dropping and spring fever is BEYOND set in...SO what is everyone favorite jig combination?I have had great success using orange jig head with a green/gold flake 4"" grub. Tried Trigger X and that was fairly impressive."

1267111,JCsGoneFishin,2011-02-01 14:30:00,34,Anyone like Northland Whistler jigs? How about Reel Bait Walleye Flashers (long shank)? These are 2 I am looking to make my favorite on our trip this year....
1267116,keek,2011-02-01 14:36:00,1003,I like the whistlers but be sure you don't push your bait/twisty tail too far up the shaft or you will limit the prop spinning.
1267139,Larry Mac,2011-02-01 15:42:00,530,"I am in agreement with Jack77, 1/4oz Northland Fireball Jig tipped with a minnow. IMHO Northland makes one heck of a jig. Have a great yearThank you,Larry Mac"
1267427,Bigstorm,2011-02-02 12:49:00,799,"my favorite jig is a 1/4oz in chart, orange, pink or green. I make my own. I'd feel bad about losing 100 jigs that cost $4 per 10. Plus is it kinda neat catching fish on something that I make myself"
1267453,ole timer,2011-02-02 14:06:00,34,"I like the walleye belly too, or a piece of gullet, but is it legal in Ontario?"
