1275667,Outfitter17,2011-02-26 21:31:00,127,"Golden Eagle is right, just have Wifi available and eat the costs. I am assuming the main reason to look into this option is the camp needs internet and you want to share/recoup the costs through the guests.We istalled a satelite internet and satelite phone system in 2008. It was about $1500 for the equipment and install and we get charged $249 per month for the top internet package and unlimited phone usage including long distance. We don't charge our guests for wifi usage, nor do I charge them for phone calls. They get the service free of charge. I needed the internet for my business at the camp and I also wanted a backup phone system. It was $199 for the top internet package and only a $50 add on for nationwide calling for the US and Canada, it was a no brainer to do with a price of only $249. Since I needed it anyways and the long distance was free, why not let the guests use the service for free.I would have had the same install price and same monthly price if I was the only one using it, so why not let the guests use it also. They think its great they can call home or check a few things on the net and it doesn't cost them anything, they thinks its great its free and it didn't cost me anymore to make it available to them.Don't nickel and dime the guests - everyone hates to be nickeled and dimed."
1275829,jaggersr,2011-02-27 09:52:00,44,"For many years I would go north for two to three weeks at a time and never have any contact with the outside world. Loved it and always came home relaxed and refreshed. My wife got tired of that so she now goes with me. I have been to camps that had radio phones and I now use them to stay in touch with parents due to age and health(mid 80's). Have been to camps with internet, but have not used it even though I have my lap top with me. We started taking a laptop a few years ago and maybe 4 or 5 DVD's to watch in the evening. Kind of nice to pass the evening. Last year I could get cell service if I stood on the tailgate of my truck and held the phone to the sky and talk on speaker phone. Either way I still enjoy my bush trips and come home relaxed, refreshed and with great memories."
1275905,2Labs,2011-02-27 13:50:00,685,"My wife and I use the internet to keep in touch when I am in a Canadian camp with my brother or by myself. The camp has wireless hookup via satellite ... along with TV. It gives me peace of mind to know that things are ok back home and she is not running into anything she cannot handle. I feel bad enough when I go on a trip without her ... she likes to fish too, just not as many weeks as me.I also use the net for keeping up with weather forecasts and U.S. News. I hate coming back from camp and having missed out on 2 weeks of news.My wife and I both use it when we are in camp together. She likes to stay in touch with her relatives (scattered in the U.S. and Europe). That doesn't stop ever.I don't know how much of that expense to the camp is included in our bill nor how it is figured. Sorry. I know we are not charged by the minute. It is not itemized on the bill. People gather in the 2 buildings that have the wireless access and you will see a half-dozen plugged in at any time late in the afternoon after a day of fishing. The TV is usually on, but I generally ignore it ... or if I am alone I turn it off."
1276040,luv2fishcanada,2011-02-27 20:15:00,41,"I've been going to Canada for the past 30 years and the best part about it is that my cell phone plan now ends at International Falls. The camp I go to does not offer the American Plan. I think with these type of resorts, people want to be left alone to fish for the week. Our camp, a drive to camp south of Red Lake, has a phone both where you can buy a phone card for $6 and I believe there are over 150 minutes on it. With gas prices going up again, it is nice to not see huge rate increases at the camps because someone wants to watch tv or check the internet. Just my two cents."
1275482,BrianinVA,2011-02-26 11:18:00,160,"I used to completely disconnect when I headed north by am no longer able to do so as my line of work requires me to check in frequently. Many of the people I have tried to recruit are in the same boat -- no internet = no fishing trip. Needless to say, the lodge we go to has it free of charge and internet access would definitely be something I would look for if we ever decide to switch resorts. If you are going to have internet do not charge for it -- eat it as an expense of operating in today's uber-connected world. Your next generation of customers will come to expect it. Also, realize that during the course of the week many of us young'ens will likely share photos of our trip with our friends via email or, more likely, Facebook. Many of your more ""mature"" customers might be doing the same as 55+ is the fastest growing Facebook demographic. If you are having a hard time with the cost remember that this is free advertising for you. Peer-to-peer advertising is often the most effective so make it as easy as possible for your customers to spread the word about their trip and your camp. I'm amazed by how few camps have taken advantage of Facebook to promote their operations but that's a whole other topic..."
1275488,youngcanadianguide,2011-02-26 11:34:00,60,"Hey everyone,Thanks for all of your opinions. I appreciate how many of you commented on this already. All of these replies will help me make my decision. adempsey, I think you have a good point on not if but when because the newer generation (My generation) is coming up to Canada and enjoy having internet. Tonyo, that's a good idea for pricing. The problem is that people don't like paying for something they aren't using. Thanks for the idea.Golden Eagle, I agree. I have a hard time not getting on here at least once a week to tell everyone what's going on up there. Camp chef, the TVs wouldn't be in the cabins just in a public area because I understand that people don't like it to be that close. A saying my Dad has is ""if your neighbors are watching T.V. you have more of the lake to yourself and more fish to catch."" But I want you to know thanks for your point of view. I enjoy hearing all points of view because it betters me as a camp owner in trainingKeep the comments coming guys. It's good to have all different point of views and whats important to each of you."
1275493,wmd,2011-02-26 11:51:00,388,"I travel for a living and if there is one thing I do not like that is paying for something I do not use. There is one chain of motels that charges for the safe in every room, granted it is only $1.50, but I won't pay for something I do not use. You can get it removed but.... My company accepts the fact that I am on vacation and it is the one week out of the year that I can get completely away and relax. If you need it at the resort, and I do understand that some people cannot stand to be out of touch, charge according to use. I would change resorts if I knew that they were charging me for something I did not use. Very unacceptable way to lose a customer. Think it through and make a wise decision."
1275494,youngcanadianguide,2011-02-26 11:55:00,60,"EddieNorth, I agree with that for sure. Guest love having the amenities that make the trip more fun for them. Even the little things that they don't realize we put in but still makes it easier for them makes me feel good too. Thanks for the offer for help and you might get an email from me soon.BrianinVA I agree that the free advertising is great. My dad actually just got a call from a previous guest. He was 16 at the time he came up and is now 22. He actually remembered us from when he was younger and wants to bring 2 friends and himself on a bear hunt. My Dad remembered him as well and even remembered what lure and the color of the lures he fished with! He couldn't believe that my Dad remembered such a detail from that lomg ago.wmd, That's how I feel about it, pay for what you use."
1275501,Moondog,2011-02-26 12:18:00,362,"I think it also depends on what kind of camp you have. We stay at South Bay on Gull Rock and Mary caters to RVer's, most of which travel a great deal and rely on wifi to communicate with family etc. Many of us stay for much longer than one week. I can only think of a few people that don't use it and the cabin folk are always in the office checking on email. Don't YOU use internet at camp for inquiries regarding availability etc? Putting up an wifi antenna isn't that big of a deal if you do it yourself. Not terrifically costly. Do you communicate with your clients by email? If so why don't you take a poll and see what they think? IMHO"
1275511,youngcanadianguide,2011-02-26 13:01:00,60,"Hi everyone,Thanks for your response. Just a reminder, the reason we have to do satellite internet and radio phone is because we are too remote for other options including cell phone coverage. The satellite internet equipment and installation (due to our remote location) will be about $1500. The monthly cost for high speed (most guys like) will be around $226 and low speed is about $126 a month. The Radio phone with a small call plan is $189 a month. This is the pricing I'm looking at,Phone service; $1.50 for phone calls for the first 5 minutes (included) and then 10 cents a minute after that. The internet I was thinking $4 per day or $20 for the week. This would be unlimited access."
1275568,Golden Eagle,2011-02-26 16:33:00,2642,You're already spending $226 a month for internet service. Only additional (one time) cost if offered to customers would be for a wireless router and a repeater or two. .................unless those Canadian companies are charging for extra use. Your customers will figure out how one party can buy your password and share it with everybody else. I say have wifi available and eat the cost. Fisherguys who don't want it will never know it was available for their cabin.
1275621,Guest,2011-02-26 19:03:00,0,Cut the radio phone cost and use vonage or magic jack. It uses the internet as a phone line.
1275629,keek,2011-02-26 19:19:00,1003,For those that don't want the internet they won't use it and will be happy. For those that do want internet they will use it and be happy. More people expect to be connected these days whether we like it or not. The Magic Jack idea is a good one. Have a timer above the phone and charge people for 5 or 10 minutes of use.
1275659,Guest,2011-02-26 20:53:00,0,You are getting ripped off in Wawa. We are remote and our guests use our radio phone by asking for time and charges. Be sure to add taxes and it is a win/win for you and your guests. Our satellite internet install was 500 bucks. The antenna reaches from the back end of our campground to the left all the way to the last cabin to the right. Cost is around 90 bucks a month (alomst twice hi speed in town but what the heck). We eat it of course - we use it too and only have it for guests that can't live without it. Satellite TV? NOT IN MY LIFETIME!!
1275350,dirt,2011-02-26 01:33:00,144,"I understand that some people may need connection to the outside world while fishing. But it´s just not me. It´s nice to be without that stuff for a week. The camp I go to has a Radio phone we can use to call home if necessary. We all use it once in the week we are up there. Otherwise, I´ve never missed TV, internet or phones for the week."
1275393,Stu,2011-02-26 06:53:00,472,"I agree w/ Adempsy. The resort where I stayed last year provided internet access. Although I did not use it, several others in the camp did. I'm not much of a techno-nerd but perhaps you could set up a modem in your maim lodge w/ wifi access and allow those w/ laptops to log in?"
1275406,Tonyo,2011-02-26 07:31:00,212,"As many have already stated, it comes down to a personal issue for each and every guest that you will have throughout the year. My only comment was about how much to charge for the internet service in camp. Our group has been going to the same camp for 9 or 10 years now and they have just added wireless service 2 years ago. They do not charge on a per minute or per use basis. They have adjusted the camp rates to include this at no charge and the use of it is unlimited. I know this may not be the best solution to your issue but a minor increase to each guest for an entire season may be the easiest way to go. I realize that not all of your guest will care or even use the service but if I had to pay on a per use basis I think I would just pass. I am in the middle on accessing outside information while on our annual trip. I didn't care at all 4 years ago but now that I started to bring my son with me, it is nice to have the internet so he can talk to mom a couple of times while we are in camp. Just my thoughts. TonyO"
1275415,Golden Eagle,2011-02-26 07:49:00,2642,"It's tough for a dedicated fisherman to go 11+ days without logging onto Walleye Central. My wife and I went 7 weeks when our only communication with folks back home was through general delivery mail service at the Chapleau post office. It worked well even though we made it to town only every week or so. We had no phone in our small tent.In 2005 I spent 3 weeks in May at a fly in camp and would have been stretched to spend one week without internet, due to my small business obligations. I've also been in two outpost situations where we were picked up a day late due to weather conditions, but it was not a problem. We had no communication system."
1275439,camp chef,2011-02-26 09:27:00,915,We look specifically for remote accomadations...We would never book a cabin that had a television in it.
1275450,Manitou,2011-02-26 09:57:00,125,"People who are hooked up these days will carry a Blackberry or Iphone and already have mobile internet access to email, etc. At my camp on Lake of the Woods we get three TV stations, CBC, CTV, and TVO. It's kind of quaint, and plenty enough contact with the outside world."
1275451,Golden Eagle,2011-02-26 10:01:00,2642,Not even if you could watch Julia Childs episodes? Good cooks should support one another.
1275458,camp chef,2011-02-26 10:15:00,915,Her days of needing support are long gone.
1275465,dutchboy,2011-02-26 10:32:00,5717,"Have your connections and antenna set up in the cabins. Buy a couple flat screen TV and have them available for rent.( keep them out of sight in the office) Those that need the TV fix can pay for it.Central location for the Internet for those that need it.Phone service for emergency's only.I'm one of those business owners that likes to keep in touch. But, the reason for a Canadian trip is to get away!!"
1275481,EddieNorth,2011-02-26 11:15:00,32,"Personally I dont think we could ever supply enough Amenities for our guests,we have wireless internet,voip and sat tv with a flat screen in the mini lodge all at no charge.The prices we pay the suppliers arent bad for the service we get to supply to our customers and a happy customer is the most important thing.We have some clients that never use the phone,internet or tv but on the other hand theres some clients that could not come for a week if we had no internet because they still need to work and check messages and problem solve during thier stay.This is very important to people that have thier own business.Also lets not forget how the mothers like to check on thier little boys from time to time ( and the husbands hahaha).Keep in mind we are an hours flight from anywhere so emergency service is factor for us too.In April we will be going to Italy to a trade show and a holiday.The hotel we have booked was a must for us to have wifi or we would not have booked with them.During our hunting season the days are shorter,guys like to watch the world series at night and the opening of the NHL season,so bottom line is the amenities we supply have been a big hit.If you need any info on our equipment and prices for your camp send me an email,,,,,,[email protected],,,Hope you have a great season!!!!Cheers,Eddie North"
1275282,youngcanadianguide,2011-02-25 19:22:00,60,"Hey guys,I have a question for everyone. Currently the new camp we will be running doesn't have internet or satellite T.V. (NOT IN CABINS JUST IN THE STORE) Do you think one of these or both are important at a camp? Satellite internet costs about $226 a month plus equipment for setup. So if I would put internet at the camp, how much do you feel is a good price to charge per day and/or per week? I don't want to make money on this I would just like to cut the cost of the internet because of its high price compared to at home. I know I like it when I go to a place and internet is cheap or free.As for the phone, we have a radio phone that we charge $1.50 for 9 minutes. (Thats less than 15 cents a minute to call Canada and the U.S.)My question is do any of you go to a camp and pay for the internet and if so how much? Do you pay by the day or by the week? If the camp doesn't have internet would you be willing to pay to have it? Would you rather pay by the day or for the whole week and how much."
1275286,P. Norts,2011-02-25 19:37:00,396,"This is just my 2 cents, but I prefer for the entire family to leave their laptops at home when we take a family fishing trip. Maybe it's because I am the mom, but I feel our family vacation is suppose to be family time. I can't lie, my husband is the worst. However in the past we have sent him into town to the coffee shop with wifi if he has to connect with the rest of the world. Honestly, I think most people leave their business world at home when they vacation and if they don't they should . Why call it a vacation if you take your headaches with you? Just my opinion. Mama Norts"
1275299,Mike Borger,2011-02-25 20:04:00,1554,"The only scenario where I want satellite internet or phone is if I'm at an extremely remote fly in location and strictly for safety reasons. Beyond that no need or desire at all. I have no use for TV especially when I'm up north fishing. If I were you I'd concentrate on making sure the cabins are clean, updated and neat. Good boats, motors and docks. The rest is nice for some people but largely unimportant."
1275302,Catman59,2011-02-25 20:11:00,345,"The camp I go to has free internet which is OK , but other than check the weather forecast a couple of times --- I have no need. They also have a radio phone that is no charge. I go north to escape TV, telephones and computers ."
1275309,Golden Eagle,2011-02-25 20:30:00,2642,$1.50 for 9 minutes. Less than 15 cents per minute. Your school is messing with your math. Better get back to home schooling. Are you thinking about running wireless and installing a repeater?
1275312,Pooch,2011-02-25 20:42:00,4619,It's important to leave all the craziness and constant distraction out of my life for several weeks while in camp every year.Internet in camp has only real value for emergency communications. In general not worth the cost for me. Have used Wi-Fi (via satellite link) in camp to look at weather radar. That was at most kind of handy. My theory is that if something bad happens at home I'll be notified and with a couple days driving to get home there is little I can do to help in the meantime.Quiet evenings after fishing with a book is one of the finer things in life. Staring in awe at the night sky is a gift to our spirits and humble our sense of self. If I wanted all the trapping of home I'd probably just stay home. I suppose many would disagree with me as we are each individuals.Good luck with he new camp.Pooch
1275314,Guest,2011-02-25 20:45:00,0,"I have had people not be able to go because they could not reach work. Typically people who have their own small business. Also, If you get internet service, you can get an IP phone like vonage or magic jack for dirt cheap. All you need is an internet connection."
1275326,youngcanadianguide,2011-02-25 22:04:00,60,"Hey everyone,Thanks for your feedback on this. I understand that many of you don't like having connection with the outside world on vacation. My dad is the same way he doesn't mind me talking to friends but he likes to have family time as well. KROK, I have to agree with you many of our business guest use our internet service. Plus my parents are an example of that, wherever we go they check their emails and phone call messages twice a day.Also, when we put T.V. in 2 of our accommodations people said they didn't want them and said they wouldn't use them but when I walk by they always seem to use them. hahaha just a fun fact. Golden Eagle your right but because of the snow storm I didn't have to go to school so I guess my brain wasn't working today.(I go to a local public school in the winter) Thanks for checking my math I guess I get a F for today. hahahaha"
1275340,adempsey,2011-02-25 23:16:00,963,"You need to plan for the future. You need to stay competitive and it's an additional selling point. Regardless if people will use it, if you have it available it will make your resort that much more appealing. It was part of my decision process for choosing a resort this year because not all of my group fish as much as others. It wasn't a make or break feature, but it still played a role. If it were me, I would at the very least offer internet access at a central location for people to send and receive emails. It's cheaper than using the phone. Your future customers are from your generation and you already stated how you feel about having access. I think it's more a question of when, not if. Over time you will get a feel of how important it is to your customers to have access from their cabins. Especially since your camp appears to market itself towards families and not just hardcore fishermen."
1275342,Nimstug,2011-02-25 23:23:00,2605,"I personally have little to no use for the outside world when I'm in a fishing camp. Now I'm not a business man that 'has' to keep connected (what did they do 10-15 years ago?). I would select a fishing camp because they had access, neither would I rule it out. You may have to look at who you is your market. Higher end my expect all the possible amenities. Regular Joe's and Jane's may not. The boat-in camp where I go has a satellite tv in the lodge. Never hung around to watch it. We get our weather via my uhf radio and baseball scores with the am radio / alarm. 'Net access in the lodge only might be a good compromise.Nimstug.....and being a Cubs fan, I usually can do without the ball scores for a week."
