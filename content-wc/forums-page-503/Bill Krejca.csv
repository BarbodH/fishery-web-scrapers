1277128,tooski,2011-03-02 13:14:00,393,I try and do a solo trip every year after the family and/or all guys trip. Your book is a part of that journey every year. Thanks for sharing...

On the down side, he told me that in January 2006. I caught the disease while catching 6# pike in Michigan 63 years ago and have been working on a cure ever since. Bill's book is on my shelf. I've bought several copies for fishing friends."
