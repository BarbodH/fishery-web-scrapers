1279118,camp chef,2011-03-07 11:40:00,915,We fish 8# siverthread excalibur tied to a snap swivel when jigging.The snap not only eliminates line twist but also reduces Northern saw jobs dramatically.
1277894,Moondog,2011-03-04 09:24:00,362,"Question to all you power pro, swivel, fluoro/mono guys:Why bother with the leader when jigging with braided line??? If you are using 8lb test PP, for example, the diameter of the line is so thin (equiv to 1lb test) what is gained by using a thicker piece of leader? Then you also have another opportunity for more knots to fail. I am puzzled. Would seem logical to tie the jig to the Power Pro when vertically jigging."
1277898,scotttheguide,2011-03-04 09:44:00,73,"I tie directly on Power Pro when jigging with 8# & 10#. I tie my soft plastics directly on also when casting with 15#. I use both Red and Green on LOTW. All my rods have Power Pro on them. I tie directly on with 80#, no leader when Musky Fishing."
1277903,Bill Krejca,2011-03-04 09:50:00,6107,"Moon, There has been a lot of discussion on this, sorta like the rivets vs welded threads, with many opinions out there. My opinion is that it maybe doesn't make much difference, but in very clear water, I will either color several ft above the lure with a dark marker (I use bright yellow line), or use a ""clear"" leader. I do this to just feel more confident in most cases. Bill"
1277912,Larry Mac,2011-03-04 10:03:00,530,"Hi Moondog, I use that system to help eliminate line twist and invisibility under water. Have a great year.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1277918,adempsey,2011-03-04 10:18:00,963,"Personally, I hate tying/cutting braid so using a leader makes it easier for me. I also use braided line that's has a diameter of 6-8lb mono, since there can be issues with spinning reels and the thinner braids [based on what I have read].Otherwise, I am of the belief that the visibility of the braid would probably make no difference where I fish."
1277954,DROP SHOT,2011-03-04 12:00:00,10,you should use a leader you will find you get more and if you fish very stained water fish can still see your line and just go braid if you are flipping for bass or top water because it is reaction strike.
1277996,scotttheguide,2011-03-04 13:40:00,73,"Something else to keep in mind, the weakest point between you and the fish is the knot. I use green Power Pro when I fish White Fish Bay on LOTW. I used to use 3' Flouro leaders all the time but got tired of rigging and tying so just started going with out, did not see big difference still caught Walleye, Lakers, smallies, crappie, Largies in open water. If you are fishing real shallow, you may want to tie on Flouro leader. But vertical jigging humps, it don't make a difference. Power Pro is pretty invisible under water, try jigging with it in the evening as the sun gets low. You cant see your own line at the tip of your rod let alone under water where lite penetration is lower. The best way is have one guy with leader and one without in the boat and test for yourself. My vote is leader not needed, but it is personal preference."
1278442,Jack77,2011-03-05 15:01:00,168,I use Power Pro braid tied directly onto all of my jigs. I like the palomar knot the best when tying directly onto jigs.
1278475,Mike Borger,2011-03-05 16:52:00,1554,"Braid may indeed be thinner in diameter, but unlike translucent mono or fluorocarbon, it's opaque. Even the thinnest braid is much more visible than fluoro or mono. In clear water it pays to use a leader."
1278979,Larry S,2011-03-07 06:21:00,666,Crystal Fireline is less visible than mono or flurocarbon besides being a lot stronger. For me I can feel the fish a lot better than any mono or flurocarbon
