You can bang it into the rocks alllll day long, or for many seasons for that matter. They will outlast and out perform everything else. You can buy them on e-bay."
1270021,fishforbrains,2011-02-10 16:21:00,12,I am a big O fan but my new walleye central friend says his Bandits will out fish me What has been your most effective crank for smallies. I fish late July. The hundred dollars worth of big Os in my box says I will be hard to convince
1270044,ManitouBass,2011-02-10 17:17:00,201,"dt 10's from rapala are hard to beat, especially the minnow pattern.but lots of cranks, almost any, will take smallies on lotw."
1270045,Esoxchaser,2011-02-10 17:24:00,1576,"Xraps, deep and shallow versions are hard to beat for smallies."
1270055,ManitouBass,2011-02-10 18:02:00,201,"Yep, the x-raps work well also"
1270153,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2011-02-10 22:02:00,629,"I spend my fair share of time chasing the ""Smallmouth"" on LOTW. In the 10seasons that I have concentrated on them, the Rapala ""Jointed"" #4,#5 & #7's have been one of my best producers. I predominantly ""Longline"" around multiple island on the Ontario side of the lake, but have also casted the shorelines with the same plugs. I'm sure you understand that the larger the # indicates its ability to go deeper. So depending on the depth of water I'm fishing dictates which one of the (3) I use. Another plug I exclusively will throw the shorelines & rock piles; is a #3 or #4 ""Red & White Mepps"" w/squirel hair. It should be mentioned that I use braided line for both trolling or throwing. This allows me to achieve a liittle greater depths with the plugs. With the #7 Rapala I will fish water upto 12 to 15 foot.That's my story & I'm sticking to it. Have fun & set the hook. CRJohn"
1270181,Bill Krejca,2011-02-11 06:01:00,6107,"One of my best LOW baits for smallmouth has been a Mepps or similar spinner with a single hook, tied with guinea feathers and red hackle. I tie them myself. Even took 4 or 5 muskie on it, best being a 48"". Bill"
1270202,Mike Kansas,2011-02-11 07:17:00,1463,I have great success with the Shadski on Smallies. I also like to use jig spinners with plastic tails attached. Mike Kansas
1270237,scotttheguide,2011-02-11 08:31:00,73,"Want to catch big Smallies on LOTW, leave the crankbaits at home....PM me for more info."
1275452,Manitou,2011-02-26 10:04:00,125,For sure's on dat.If I want to catch a bass I use a jig with a power grub.The bass up here aren't very fussy and would probably hit a bare hook if you jiggled it the right way.
1275530,ManitouBass,2011-02-26 14:30:00,201,"They are like that here in Manitou as well, their not terribly fussy, especially in the right conditions.My favorite crank though is the Rapala DT 10's,the DT 6's, the dt 4'sAll time favorite for smallies though is a black jig with a black/silver salted grub."
