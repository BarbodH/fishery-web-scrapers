I am particularly interested in finding out about required safety equipment and how it applies to various sized watercraft. Thanks in advance for any assistance."

539357,rebelrn2001,2004-05-07 20:57:00,1563,I see in this web site that they show a 12 guage arial flare gun. http://www.ccg-gcc.gc.ca/obs-bsn/sbg-gsn/6mpower_e.htm Recently on W/C there was a post saying this was illegal now. What is correct? I have hand held and arial's. I was planing on taking out my 12 guage for my trip but I think that would be the most effective method of alerting someone of my distress. Can I bring it or not?
539359,Guest,2004-05-08 01:00:00,0,i contacted somone up a while ago about the 12 gauge flair and they said that a safety device recognized in the US as a marine safety device is also recognized as a marine safety device in canada. So yes it is legal. Just dont shoot anyone with it or they will cancel that rule.
539383,phern,2004-05-09 11:11:00,151,"Yes, the flare may be legal but if the device is a shotgun, there are certainly tons of problems concerning bringing firearms into Canada. From what I have read, the fee is 50 dollars and the demand must be made at least 60 days before entry into Canada. But dont take my word for it because I am no expert. Here is the link to the info which is updated regularly: http://www.cfc-ccaf.gc.ca/en/visitors/"

Last year she did (by about 2""). She left me a note a few days ago saying ""If I catch a 33"" Northern and you don't catch any, you owe me $165, right?"". We have a bet this year that the largest fish caught minus the length of the other persons longest fish, the the looser pays the other person $5 per inch. I will win, even if I have to lie....just kidding (I fish alone quite a bit)."
