539309,Mike M (Sask),2004-05-05 08:03:00,374,Here's a site called Gas Watch. You can check the gas prices all over Canada and USA.http://www.gaswatch.org/
539318,Brian_MN,2004-05-05 11:08:00,738,"Ontario is about .84/litre today, and the exchange is 27% today, so that gives you about $2.32 USD per gallon."
