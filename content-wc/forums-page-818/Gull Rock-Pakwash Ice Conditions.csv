539408,Guest,2004-05-10 11:07:00,0,Thanks for the report Pakman. Maybe see you on the lake when we get there or stop by your place if I knew where it was. Anyway thanks again Bruce
539037,Guest,2004-04-21 12:48:00,0,Any reports on ice conditions on Pakwash or Gull Rock? Any ice out predictions?
539062,Guest,2004-04-22 17:05:00,0,"Just got off the ice on Pakwash, went out with the auger to check it and there is about 18 to 20 inches, but some of that is slush ice and water. Good question as to when it goes out. Depends so much on the weather we get in the next while. The weather is still getting below freezing at night and only getting up to the low 40's during the day. Chance of flurries tonight. But Saturday should be about 60. My best guess is if the warm weather stays ice out would be about May 8-10, same as last year. Keep your fingers crossed."
539067,Guest,2004-04-22 20:38:00,0,Thanks for the info Packman. We'll be up May 22 through 29th at Snake Falls Ice out earlier would be better but had good luck last year. Been coming here for about 10 years love the lake and the eyes. Do you live on the lake? If so would be nice if you could post again when the ice goes. Thanks Again. Bruce

539225,Guest,2004-04-30 09:32:00,0,Anyone know more about the ice conditions here??
539236,Guest,2004-04-30 11:55:00,0,"Yes I do live on Pakwash Bruce. On the East side near the Park. The ice has melted around the dock just enough to put a boat in. At least it was enough for me. Managed to break enough out to get a hole about 50' in diameter. Drove around in tight cirles for about 5 minutes and had to stop I think my wife was ready to call the people with the sleeveless jackets to take me away. Going to be touch and go for ice-out on the opening week. Got snow today but not as much as Red Lake, cool for the next couple days, then warming,, I hope. Ice is very rotten but still need some good weather to get it the heck out of the way. Time will tell."
539261,Minnow Man,2004-05-02 09:46:00,85,"Was up to Red Lake yesterday, Rob At Snake Falls Camp on Pakwash Lake has lots of water at his end of the lake, He has his boats in the water ready for the opener. His Beaver float plane is in the water. Trout River is open , Chukuni River is open, Bay at Golden Hook Camp on Gullrock Lake is open, Stoney Bay on Gullrock is almost clear of ice. Bug River is open water to Five Lake Lodge on Gullrock, looks like you can get to their dock, but can't see up the lake from the hwy. Howey Bay, Red Lake is still iced over, but eveything is off the ice , no snowmachines or ski planes, looks very dark, need a weather event to break it up, rain or wind. Ice will be gone before the opener. Can hardly wait for my first feed of fresh Walleye."
