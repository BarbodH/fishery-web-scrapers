539416,Guest,2004-05-10 15:51:00,0,there's a place called four seasons or four winds. something like that. can't remember. it's right on the main drag as you enter town. sell license and bait. pretty decent place. good luck.
539420,Guest,2004-05-10 20:16:00,0,Four seasons is on your right an Smitty's farther north on your left.
539448,Walleye_Slayer,2004-05-11 16:32:00,134,My opinion is go to Smitty's unless you want a bunch of useless info and exactly how to catch and release fish because unless you are ready to admit that you don't know the correct way to fish you will be at loggerheads at the other place.

539449,Guest,2004-05-11 17:51:00,0,I've never been to Four Seasons. Always stop at Smitty's. Free coffee!
539451,Guest,2004-05-11 20:25:00,0,I second the fact that Four Seasons get 2 thumbs down. What ever you have isn't right from the bait to your boat. If you want an opinion go see Mike! Been there and won't be back!
539467,Hammerhead Herb,2004-05-12 14:45:00,259,"An excellent place to buy bait in Ear Falls is D & E Minnows. Their phone number is 807-222-2496 Their website is www.deminnows.ca They were the only Ear Falls bait retailer not to run out of bait in 2003 We've been using them for about 3 years and are quite satisfied. They are about 2 miles down Goldpine Road. There is a place in their website that shows how to get there; it's not hard. Also, their parentss live in Ear Falls. If you call ahead, they have brought them to town and had them waiting for us. I recommend that you go to their place of business; when they scoop them out of the tanks, they give you a lot more than what you asked for. We drive up from N Cent IL for a fly out. I call them up before we head up to Ear Falls. Then we call them again when we are at the Trillium. We head out to their place and they are waiting for us and package the minnows while we are there. We pick them up around 8 in the morning and they pack them up real nice with air in the bags because we are not able to get them in the water at the lake until about noon. I don't know if they sell licenses though."
