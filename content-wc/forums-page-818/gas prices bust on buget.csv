539368,rebelrn2001,2004-05-08 19:47:00,1563,"The way to look at it is this: I get about maybe 13 mpg towing my boat (maybe more..this will be the first long trip w/this vehicle/engine). Last year gas was about 1.80? This year 2.00--maybe more by the time we leave in 13 days. If I drive 1500 miles round trip, that equates to 115 gallons of gas. If gas is .20 more this year..it will cost 23 dollars more to go this year than last year. Is that enough to stop ANYONE? I don't think so. Plus, if you have more than one person splitting the cost, it is a lot less. Yes, gas prices SUCK but it isn't out of reach... YET!!"
539370,Guest,2004-05-08 20:16:00,0,The price does stink but I'm going if it costs $4.00 a gallon. 32 days and counting
539373,Guest,2004-05-08 21:24:00,0,"Ahmmm, yeah, I had this discussion with my parents and brother tonight. If anyone is willing to b!tch about gas being too expensive, then they should be kicked in the @$$ the next time they pay $3.50 for a bottle of beer, or $5.00 for a 16oz. cup of Starbucks. We are fortunate gas is only $2.00 per gallon.... I will be fishing this summer if gas goes to $10.00 per gallon. Big deal..."
539387,Trailerguy,2004-05-09 12:33:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Let's see now $5 for 16 oz. of Starbucks.... that's 480 cups to a 30 gal fill up or $2400. Ya, when was the last time you bought that much Starbucks? Or even $1680 for beer in one week? Most of us just want enough left at the end of the week to go fishing!"
539390,the_bronco,2004-05-09 19:33:00,86,What they said!!!
539391,Guest,2004-05-09 21:49:00,0,"10 bucks a gallon? You are a simple simon!!!!! You must work for exxon or bp. Oh sure its not that expensive, think before you open your piehole, you are the reason it keeps going up, I have the money and this is insane, everyone needs to boycott this mayham. Peace"
539399,Guest,2004-05-10 06:15:00,0,"No, I am not the reason the gas prices go up. Its politics, thats all. You could boycott gas for a month and they'd still be high....You may be able to put a price on your trip, but my trip to Canada with the guys I see only a few times a year is priceless, not an obligation as you make your trip sound. Sucks for you."
