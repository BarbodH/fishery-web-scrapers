539362,Atlanta Dave,2004-05-08 12:47:00,323,Does anyone know if in Quebec if you have to have a life jacket in the boat for every occupant? Also will a seat cushion satisfy the regulation. We will be on Gouin Res. Atlanta Dave
539365,Andre M,2004-05-08 15:47:00,86,Dave it is mandatory to have a life jacket or a seat cushion per passenger.
539367,Alces,2004-05-08 19:03:00,35,"correction: you must have a PFD that fit every person on board, child must have children size and adult, adult size. You don't have to wear it but it must be on board"
539371,Andre M,2004-05-08 20:38:00,86,Good point. Absolutly right!
539381,Atlanta Dave,2004-05-09 10:54:00,323,Is a seat cushion all you need? You mention it but then say the life jacket must be the right size. Atlanta Dave
539382,phern,2004-05-09 11:02:00,151,"Yes....a PFD for every occupant and the PFD must be ""approved"". I think some of the older flotation devices are no longer approved because of more recent ""normes"" (I think since 1999 but not sure) and I would take a close look at the cushions that were ok a while back because they may not have government approval anymore. In the past few weeks, the CANADIAN SAFE BOATING COUNCIL, is pushing to make it obligatory to ""wear"" your PFD (while under way) in all water craft less than 6 meters long. So, there is a possibility that next year, your cushion would look kind of funny tied to your tummy and holding up your chin. Here is the link to Canada Shipping Act concerning obligatory equipement aboard water craft under 6 meters in length : http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/S-9/C.R...html#rid-54630 Here is an interesting tidbit. I remember about 20 years ago, the inflatable flotation vests were not approved. So, to get around that, some guys would wear their vests but have an approved cushion to sit on. Now, lets say you are big....and I mean big....and you have rigged up something to keep you afloat. You know it works because you tested it and you feel comfortable and safe with it. So...use it and bring along an approved PFD to stay within the law. Here is the link to ""recalls"" of safety equipment :http://www.ccg-gcc.gc.ca/obs-bsn/recalls_e.htm"
