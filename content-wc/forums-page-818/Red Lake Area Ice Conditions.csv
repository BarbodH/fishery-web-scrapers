539388,Guest,2004-05-09 13:37:00,0,Still Ice on all those lakes. Probably won't be gone till early June. Worst year I've ever seen.
539393,Pakman,2004-05-10 05:15:00,7,Ice went out on Pakwash yesterday and last night. Howey bay on Red lake still had ice yesterday but things change quick this time of year.

I suspect it will be ok to land a plane in front of Booi's and Cat Island Resort, but the ice will more then likly be in the main lake to the North..Bring an axe and ice chisel..also lot of clothing In the 25 plus years I have been fishing Trout, we were never ice out on the open,until five years ago. Three out of the last five years were tough to travel, but the fishing was outstanding.. A great lake and this year will be great as usual..We will be in the second week with a group of ten. My son-in-law with 20 and another friend with 8.. Call Booi's the best place on the lake for your update.. 1-888-879-2664"
