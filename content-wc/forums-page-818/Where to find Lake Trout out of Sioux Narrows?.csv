539429,Guest,2004-05-11 04:43:00,0,Hi. I fish out of there too but in june. I have been told many times that at this time of the year the water is soooo cold the lakers are right at the dock.
539436,downriverbob,2004-05-11 10:58:00,880,What area are you talking about. If you were a little more specific about where you are going to be you might get more of a response !
539440,downriverbob,2004-05-11 12:21:00,880,"I guess I should have said what resort are you fishing out of, if you let me know I will give you some ideas. I fish out of The Sanctuary Resort which is on the island directly west of Highrock Island in the middle of Whitefish Bay."
539441,Guest,2004-05-11 12:32:00,0,"Two years ago we were up on LOTW from May 15-22. We caught several decent lakers (largest 16#) all in shallow water. We stayed at IndianHead lodge, just south of Sioux Narrows in Snake Bay. The week we were up there, the ice had just gone out the week prior and water temps were only in the mid-upper 40's by the end of the week. We actually caught our first laker by accident in 10 feet of water. The lake trout began surfacing mid-week and were feeding on baitfish very near the surface. It was a blast! All we did was sit in the smaller bays (it only worked when the water was calm), and wait for one to surface. We then would buzz over to the spot and cast small crankbaits into where we saw the fish and usually got them to hit. They were very aggressive. By the end of the week, we saw very few surfacing. It was only good for about 3 days. I think depending on how you hit the water temps while you're up there, you should head into snake bay in the evenings on a calm day and check it out! Good luck and have fun. We were targeting mostly pike so the lake trout were only a bonus for us. One more tip.... I know the guide from the resort takes clients to cigar island (East side of Whitefish Bay) and fishes long-lines with ciscoes for lake trout. They usually do very well. They start in 80-100 feet of water, drop their lines, then troll to shore and set their rods on shore and wait for a strike. They catch several in the 30 pound range every year, and big pike also. They fish the ciscoes weightless using a small baitkeeper hook. Good luck! -RyanHunts"
539442,wiggle,2004-05-11 12:45:00,400,"I will be staying at a cabin on Lobstick bay. I have never caught a lake trout. I was told that spring was the easiest time of year to catch them. Not looking for big fish, just want to try and catch a few. Will there be any lake trout in Lobstick bay this time of year? Regina? Or will they be on their way to deep water? Just looking for some help here. Thanks again, wiggle"
539443,downriverbob,2004-05-11 13:41:00,880,"There are a couple areas in Lobstick Bay where a reef or hump comes out of deep water that will produce lake trout. Casting medium/deep crank baits on these reefs will produce. Also very slow trolling of spoons with an inline keel type sinkers will produce lakers. You will probably hook up on an ocassional pike or walleye using these techniques. The ice is out about a week earlier this year and water level a little above normal levels. Buy yourself a map #6213 titled Whitefish Bay and it will cover the area that you are staying at. If you venture out into Whitefish Bay be aware that there at lot more islands and reefs out there and more things to hit with your motor. If you have a GPS use it ! If not watch where you travel, a lot of people get lost on LOTW more than any other body of water that I have fished."
539450,bronzeback77,2004-05-11 19:09:00,97,"I have fished LOTWs the end of May for the last 7 years, staying at a lodge in Snake bay. I have always had good luck on Lake Trout near the powerlines that lead into Snake Bay and near the deep structure off of Annie and Russell Islands. I like to throw a big White Twister Tail, we caught quite a few last year the biggest was 13 lbs."
539480,Guest,2004-05-13 08:17:00,0,"The lake trout bite has been moderate, weather has been not to good, snow and rain.This will keep temps cool and the lake trout should stay shallow.Areas to try are mouth of Knickerbocker,Whitefish narrows, the enternce of Snake bay.I'll be doing a little trout fish this weekend if you see a blue bass boat stop by."
539484,wiggle,2004-05-13 09:41:00,400,"Thanks for the replies everyone. Darcy, I'll keep an eye out for ya. You've always replied to my questions, thanks wiggle"
