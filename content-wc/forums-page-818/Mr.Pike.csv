When the sun gets high in the sky and the wind dies down, we hit the weed beds and cast for a couple of hours. Just as much fun as fishing for walleyes. One of my brothers thinks it's MORE fun!"
539248,Atlanta Dave,2004-04-30 21:43:00,323,stil would like to hear back from the guy that had the 35 lb pike . Atlanta Dave
539249,Alces,2004-05-01 07:33:00,35,"Just posted a 25 pounds 49,6 inches pike on the fishing photo site caught last year at the Gouin reservoir"
539252,Guest,2004-05-01 11:10:00,0,"There has to be more people than this that fish for pike,Doesnt anyone have a story"
539254,orchard frank,2004-05-01 12:50:00,1900,"I know Salty, and he probably was exagerating. I bet that pike wasn't a bit over 34lbs 12oz. I have a hard time keeping the poor guy in lures big enough for the fish he catches. I have caught pike at Seul up to about 22lb and my son had one hang onto a walleye long enough for us to see that had to be pushing 30 (and yes, I do know the difference between a pike and a musky). I'm going up there earlier than I've ever been before, plan on a little gator fishing in some of Salty's secret spots, I'll take pics. Good Luck"
539256,Guest,2004-05-01 19:11:00,0,"TRUE PIKE STORY LAC SEUL....I believe it was in 1996 that we took a Missouri Crappie fisherman with us to Lac Seul. He had never caught any big fish and like all Canada Rookies he was very excited about the prospects of fishing Canada. He had a terrible time casting with a casting rod but was still enjoying catching some nice Pike. Than as only the fish God can do lady luck struck the Crappie fisherman. He hooked and landed a pike that was 46"" long. I really dont know what she weighed but she was big enough to eat a 5 lb Walleye for supper and another for dessert. She was an awesome fish. She looked way to big to be normal. We usally caught a lot of 32"" to 36"" Pike and one or 2 38"" or 39"" fish every year but this was a special treat ...especially for a Crappie Fisherman."
539257,Atlanta Dave,2004-05-01 21:07:00,323,went to camp in 2002 the second week of June . Lake about 90 percent ice wait two days to get out of bay where the camp is located to a prime pike spot. Our boat had 11 pike from 20 lbs to 26 lbs that day I had 8 of those and it is a record I will not probably ever surpass again . Atlanta dave
539427,Guest,2004-05-11 01:06:00,0,"Hey guys. I would have to agree on the 35lb pike being a rare thing. I have seen quite a few 20lb plus pike, and have even caught a 26 pounder myself. If there is a way to post pictures here I have one of some friends with a 35 pounder that I took. It was 49 inches long. That was the biggest pike I have ever seen and probably won't see one much bigger than that."
539117,Guest,2004-04-26 20:49:00,0,Doesnt anyone fish for pike when they go to lac seul?
539119,Guest,2004-04-26 22:21:00,0,"Good question. I have seen some pretty good ones latch on to a walleye or two each year, surely there are some good places to fish for them??"
539120,Guest,2004-04-27 06:19:00,0,"We do, why not? When you fill up on the walleye you can take with you, what else are you going to do? Plus, the pike are just fun to catch!"
539123,salty,2004-04-27 07:00:00,8,my lagest gator up here is 35 lbs got him on my bass rig .I have caught alot of high teens usualy one or two a year in the twentys. I am now getting in to fly fishing for them .Wat a riot!!
539127,Guest,2004-04-27 11:26:00,0,I was just wondering because when we go up there we love to fish for them acouple hours a day.and there a blast to catch.
539128,Atlanta Dave,2004-04-27 12:39:00,323,Mr Pike would love to see a pic of the 35 lb pike. That is truly a great trophy that most pike fishermen will never come close to.What kind of scale was it weighed on? Also curious how long it was. We have fished for years on a great trophy producing pike lake much farther north than you and the biggest at our camp has been 30 lbs.Now our camp has only been open 4 yrs and only gets fished by 8 men per week for about 8 weeks each year but most of the fishing is for pike with some time spent on lake trout. Atlanta Dave
539131,Guest,2004-04-27 13:43:00,0,"Our group used to do a lot of Pike fishing on Lac Seul. We always had the best luck fishing in and adjacent to weedbeds with 3/4 oz spinner baits. This was always the first week of July when the weeds were getting visible. We go in early June now and fish Walleye mainly but every once in a while we catch a 35"" toothy critter on jig and minnow in one of our Walleye spots."
539137,Atlanta Dave,2004-04-27 16:24:00,323,Salty Please look up my post after this it was meant for you. Atlanta dave
539138,Atlanta Dave,2004-04-27 16:45:00,323,Mike I believe the 35 inch pike I have trouble with the 35 pound pike mentioned in the earlier post. Yes they are a blast when you get into a mess of teen size pike that are agressive. Atlanta Dave
539140,Guest,2004-04-27 18:36:00,0,"I agree, i have a hard time believing the 35lb Pike story. I have fished Canada for about 30 years. You don't even hear of fish that big. If you caught one that big, you should feel very fortunate. Have a great fishing week !!"
