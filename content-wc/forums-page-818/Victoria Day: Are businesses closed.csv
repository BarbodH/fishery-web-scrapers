539400,Guest,2004-05-10 06:33:00,0,You will not have a problem. Pretty much everything (accept possibly government operated liquor and beer stores) will be open.

All government offices and banks will be closed as will all Beer Stores, all LCBOs, Canadian Tire stores, etc. No doubt, there will be gas stations still operating and some convenience stores. However, most major chain grocery stores will most likely be closed."
