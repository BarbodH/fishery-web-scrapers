538702,Guest,2004-04-08 19:22:00,0,Are all the camps full on Lac Seul for opener or has the fear of ice or the gas prices caused some cancellations??
538713,Guest,2004-04-09 07:25:00,0,"There are a few opening week openings around as this year is an early opener, it also coincides with the Minnesota opener and may interfer with some travel plans. Ice should be out, but is always a concern with the early opener; doubt the extra $20-$30 per person for gas would keep a true fisherman from enjoying some of the best walleye fishing around."
538740,Guest,2004-04-10 04:51:00,0,The Ice is going quick. My guess is Ice Out by April 30 to May4.

538819,Guest,2004-04-13 17:00:00,0,"I've always found crawlers to be a hit or miss bait here on the west end, seem to work best in wet weather and high water. Have had some good crawler bites the past couple summers; but minnows have always been the most consistant bite throughout the year and it's easier to keep and offer one bait type here at the resort. I also don't appreciate the usual mid-western method of fishing crawlers; a two hook crawler rig with 2 small hooks. The usual presentation is to let the walleye take the crawler for several ( I've heard 15-20 seconds or more from fishermen in my guide boat) and then reef like h**l to set the hooks; usually deep and often in the gullet. This is not a great way to treat slot walleye and other good fish that should be released. Way to often the fisherman is too hard headed to cut the line and digs the deep hooks out to save a couple pennies. I've been experimenting with a homemade quick strike crawler harness using #2 circle hooks that you can tighten up on and start reeling right away; it presents the crawler well and the circle hook(s) are real easy to remove from the corner of the mouth. With the larger hooks I've not had a real problem with hook sets, don't know if any are commercially available yet, but circle hooks work great."
