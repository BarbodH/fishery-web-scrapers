539413,Guest,2004-05-10 14:05:00,0,Rumor has it that the water level will about the same as last year. They are still working on the Dam and that will determine the low level.
539418,Guest,2004-05-10 19:34:00,0,"Lac Seul is higher than July 2003.It is at the upper end of the average for May, and the inflow is 5 times the outflow so I would anticipate the level to keep rising for the next little while. If we get one good spring rain storm the lake level could rise quickly and be at an above normal level. See the graph listed below.http://www.lwcb.ca/pdf/LacSeulGraph2004.05.10.pdf"
