We have added a couple of days to our trip this year to try for some musky. None of us have ever fished for them, just looking for some general suggestions on rods, reels, line, lures ext. And also if anyone has fished there in the past for muskies I would love to know some hot spots (we've been there before and know the lakes fairly well). tight lines"
539342,Mark_NE,2004-05-06 12:06:00,58,How early in June are you going to be there? The Muskie season doesn't open in Ontario until the 3rd weekend in June (opening day in 2004 is Saturday June 19th). Mark
539344,snaggletooth,2004-05-06 14:40:00,135,"Your choice; it depends if you wish to spend money getting heavy-duty tackle to horse them in quickly and cast big baits or just fish for musky. Bass tackle with slightly heavier line is all you really need to get by, especially in spring. Many large musky (50 inches and bigger) are taken every year on bass tackle. Large lures are not a must either. Bass-sized baits will work fine. Be sure to bring 4-6 quality steel, or better yet titanium leaders per angler. You should expect to spend $3-$10 per leader for good ones. Cheap leaders are a big risk. You can do just fine with a quality brand, 20 lb. test line. Spinning reels on medium weight rods are fine, too. If you wish to invest in heavy tackle; get an Ambasseduer 6500 baitcast reel and a good quality 6-7 ft. graphite musky rod. This will cost about $85(reel)+ $50-$150(rod). St Croix rods are considered the Cadillacs among musky anglers. You can get a good South Bend Tony Rizzo musky rod for $50-$60. I consider that one a ""best buy"". Spool the Ambasseduer with 80lb test Cortland Spectron super braid. Be careful, you can only cut ths line with a sharp knife. Nail clippers are woefully inadequate. You still need the steel leaders with this rig because musky teeth slice super braid in no time. With this rod & reel you can pitch the big stuff. It doesn't take many to run up quite a bill on musky baits !! Have fun up there !!"
539355,Guest,2004-05-07 12:42:00,0,We will be there June 14-21 and we're staying at the North Lodge. On our last trip we stayed at Stork and were not impressed with the equipment nor the hospitality it was as if the camp manager was trying to keep alot of the fishing spots to himself. So we are going back to the north lodge with Jerry.
