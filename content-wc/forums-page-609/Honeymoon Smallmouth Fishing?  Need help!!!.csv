I have been reading these forums for a few weeks....too much info. Of course she has a couple of MUSTS so I'm looking for suggestions for lakes that fit the bill. 1-Remote Drive-in or Boat-in 2-Outpost Cabin(No nearby neighbors)Running Water/Showers 3-Excellent smallmouth fishing 4-Sandy Beach I only have a 14 Gruman/25 HP, so HUGE lakes are out of the question. We are both avid smallmouth junkies. Driving from Thunder Bay, Ontario and willing to drive 12 hours in any direction for huge smallies and cozy accomodations for our honeymoon. Completely self sufficient...just need a remote place to call home for a couple of weeks. I hope that I can find such a lake in such short notice. Jason:thanks2:"
