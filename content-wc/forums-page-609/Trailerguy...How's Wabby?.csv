574334,Guest,2008-05-27 10:58:00,0,"Can't speak for Trailerguy, but I've spoke to my brother at camp and he's said the fishing has been good for size but not as many numbers at this time. Obviously cold water temps are making things different this year but I'm sure the fishing will really be great when we get into June. I leave June 6th and hoping for warmer temps between now and then to get things going. Good luck this year."

Im leaving the same day...will be about 15 miles south on 105 at Cedar Lake..The weather service shows about 7 days in a row where it will be 70 or higher before we leave..hopefully that will do the trick"

574358,Guest,2008-05-28 07:19:00,0,Big Mike I grew up in Alden and my thoughts are with the people in Parkersburg. I'm heading to Wine Lake on June 6th. What resort are you staying at on Wabby?
