I don't mean wimpering and sniveling in the back aof the boat I mean relly bawling. You know like a little kid does when some takes their candy?"

574942,jigman 2003,2008-06-11 13:39:00,981,"So pulling up 10 yards (30 feet) away from someone at a spot is absolutely necessary to catch fish? Are these boats stacked like cord wood? I know that some spots in WI get stacked with boats in the spring, however most of the time better fishing can be had if you don't go play bumper boats with them. If someone pulls up 10 yards away from me when there is room to fish farther away, then yeah, that's too close."

575026,Guest,2008-06-13 10:43:00,0,Not from Leach Lake but fished there often. I have fished on LS where the boats were so close you could reach touch the boat next to you with your fishing rod. I thought that was a little to close (about 8 ft)at the time but now it seems funny. I didn't let it ruin my trip. The jagoff that came in so close was in a Grady White from MN. My guess he was from the the Twin Cities doctor or lawyer. He was showing off for his teenage kids. I would rather fish in a secluded spot but I'll go where I know and know where I can catch fish. Good Luck to you this year
575044,Guest,2008-06-13 18:08:00,0,"That will happen on LS, but usually only near the sancutary early season, but then again most people know that. My point is that on a fishery like LS there is no need to do that the rest of the year. Boats can get pretty close on the Sand Banks, Manitoba Pt, and even in Ghost Narrows, but those are the only spots some guys will even try. That's why our group avoids them. There is 1000's of miles of shoreline, endless numbers of coves, humps, points and weedbeds to find fish. Why hit the Sand Bank evryday for a week when there are much better spots to explore if you are willing to try."
575056,Guest,2008-06-13 21:00:00,0,"Steve, don't get me wrong I pefer to fish in alone and not in a crowd but I do what I gotta do to catch my fish. If i'm crowdin anybody just let me know and I'll back off unless the bite is good. LOL"
574855,Obabikon,2008-06-10 07:34:00,2370,"Since this was brought up, let's put together some general rules that everyone should follow. This isn't going to be a ""reactionary"" list... like ""dont' throw beer cans at people who fish next to you"" or ""don't do doughnuts around boats that upset you"" 1. Slow down around all docks and people fishing in boats. Even if you're not stopping, do not fly by a dock or a group of people fishing. Wakes can cause damage to docks and be very frustrating to people affected by incosiderate boaters. 2. Head on traffic stays to the right. This shouldn't need to be said, because we're not in England. Drive on the RIGHT side when traffic is headed towards you. If you're going through a small channel, you get the right side... not the left side or middle. Passing boats get their right side. (not all that complicated, since we all have driver's licenses) 3. Do not litter or leave trash at shore lunch spots. There's quite a large fine, and I'm a firm believer that it should be 30 days in jail. There is no need to knowingly/intentionally litter. Throw it in the boat, and put it in a trash can when you get back. If you can think of more (and there's lots), post them in here..."
574858,jigman 2003,2008-06-10 07:45:00,981,"My pet peeve is cigarette butts. Guys just throw them in the lake, on shore, etc. I smoked for 17 years so I know that it isn't necessary. Pinch the ""cherry"" off, stomp it out if on land and put the filter in your pocket or a container. The world is not your ashtray."
574859,Guest,2008-06-10 07:56:00,0,Maybe we could attempt to keep the launch stuff civil and organized. Eastern Guy
574860,AllenW,2008-06-10 08:29:00,11482,"Used to be ""do onto others as you'd have them do unto you"" but with the sick puppies we have wandering around now days, that probably won't work. But I guess leave it in better shape than you found it and stay as far away from other fishermen as possible/reasonable is a start. Al"
574883,Guest,2008-06-10 14:11:00,0,how far is a reasonable distance away? Spots like Steamboat Narrows on Lac Suel can get pretty crowded. Is ten yards to close?
574885,Guest,2008-06-10 14:14:00,0,If someone pulls within 50 yards of me or even a hundred yards if I am in a beautiful remote place I simply relocate.
574888,Obabikon,2008-06-10 15:10:00,2370,"It depends on the spot/type of fishing. Shorelines... if you're wanting to fish a shoreline that someone else is clearly fishing, then fish behind them. Do not jump infront. They were there first, and deserve the first crack at the fish they are clearly targeting. Sunken trees/humps... if someone is fishing a specific spot, stay away from it. You can fish an area within sight, but dont' fish the specific structure they're fishing. Beaches/coves/narrows... these areas tend to be a little more spacious. It's acceptable to fish near by, but if you have an option of fishing somewhere else, do so. There are a ton of fishing holes out there, and if you don't know anymore... find one. It's fun and rewarding to find new spots. I've grown up on LOTW's, and I find new spots every week! Trial and error is the best way to broaden your repetoir. There are some exceptions. Especially in the fall. When the fish school up in specific spots, everyone's used to sharing those areas. There are no other spots to fish, and everyone knows it. Feel free to pull up and fish, but dont' run other boats over. Always keep aware of where you and other boats are, and where you and they are headed."

If you can here them talking about what a jerk you are for jumping the spot, you can consider that to close. There are some really good points being made here, the best is that finding a spot that holds fish that you found all by yourself is really someplace special. Our goal is to find at least 2 new spots every trip, more often than not we find many more. My map is littered with highlighted spots that depending on the wind may or may not be hit again this year, but we know where they are."
574921,fourize,2008-06-11 05:59:00,287,Leave only your footprints.
574922,AllenW,2008-06-11 06:18:00,11482,"For me reasonable is staying far enough away so my fishing doesn't interfere with some one else's fishing. Varies depending where I'm at, but never so close our lines can get snagged with another boat or you need to play bumper cars with the boats. The further apart the better. Al"
