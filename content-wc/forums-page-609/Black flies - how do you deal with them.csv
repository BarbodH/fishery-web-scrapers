The ankle biters are not black flies. Here's a picture of of a true Black Flyhttp://cache.eb.com/eb/image?id=6675&rendTypeId=4 We just call them ankle biters... the big thing is I've found is do not get fish slime in your boat. If you don't have to use the net, don't do it. They seem to love that stuff. Land the fish by hand, and don't let them touch the floor of the boat."
574934,jigman 2003,2008-06-11 09:57:00,981,"Yep, that's a blackfly. I'll take the ankle biters over those darn things anyday."

574944,Guest,2008-06-11 14:21:00,0,All the bugs are bad here in NW Ontario. Worst year I've seen in a long time. Layer your clothes and wear a bug net. I set up a screened in tent to sit out at night. Dragon flies are starting to show up. They will start to feed on the crop of new bugs but it takes a while.

574898,lassh,2008-06-10 17:20:00,553,I've heard the black flies are bad in some areas this year. Have any of you found an effective way to deter them or at least to keep them from biting or away from your ankles? Thanks--3 days and a wake up!
574899,phishfearme,2008-06-10 17:34:00,1242,"tape the cuffs of your pants shut and spray the area with something that's 95% DEET - and wear thick socks. my biggest problems are my ears - the only thing useful for that is maintain a DEET coating in that area - which sweats and washes off way too fast. sorry to say but keeping yourself too clean is like ringing the dinner bell for blackflies. in this case, dirty is better. phish"

Last year at Wiley Point the files were brutal in the boat when the wind layed down. My ankles were getting chew up bad. A buddy in the boat had a Thermacell and never used it. I said pull that bad boy out and let's see if it's all it's cracked up to be. Suffice it to say that I bought one the day after we got back home. They flat work. I've used it now on Lake Michigan salmon fishing and it keeps the little flys away out there too and it works great turkey hunting with the mosquitos. Try one!
574902,lassh,2008-06-10 17:55:00,553,I think my wife might have bought one of those a few years ago. Do they use butane? If we still have it I'll give it a try. Thanks.
574903,deputy dog,2008-06-10 17:57:00,305,"we use the ""off"" brand wipes. after we wipe our hands and necks put the used wipe on the back of your hat under the band and let it lay on your neck. works good! saw the thermo cell on tv and wondered how well it works and how long the ""charge"" lasts?"
574904,lassh,2008-06-10 17:58:00,553,You're probably trolling on Lake Michigan. Do they work while you're trolling?
574905,Guest,2008-06-10 18:04:00,0,Yes they work while trolling. I keep it on the cooler in the cockpit of the boat. It works in about a 15' circle so that area is bug free. They do run on butane and I'd suggest getting several refills. They seem to last about 4 hrs a crack maybe less some days. But well worth it IMHO.
574907,idapaul,2008-06-10 18:22:00,82,spray wd 40 on ankles about 1 an hour to hour and a half. not on skin just on pants and socks. a can lasts all week
574914,Guest,2008-06-10 20:48:00,0,"We use a product called Flys off, made by a company called Central Pet, it is made to spray on horses and dogs. We spray down the carpet on the boat and never have a problem, you can but it at Country General or places like Pets Mart"
574915,Guest,2008-06-10 20:52:00,0,Those flies like white socks or it seems to me they do. I put duct tape on my socks/ankles worked for me. They did not bite the bare skin above the socks. But they loved those white socks.
