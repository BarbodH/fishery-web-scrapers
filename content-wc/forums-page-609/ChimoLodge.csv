574815,Guest,2008-06-09 13:28:00,0,I'm thinking about taking a fly-in trip with ChimoLodges to to Wagin Lake. Has anyone ever stayed there and have information/reports on the fishing? How are the portages? Any input or feedback would be appreciated. Thanks.

Good size and numbers overall. Portage lakes: My experience with Walleye lake was less numbers, better size. Bee Lake good numbers variety of size and I never have made the long portage to Northern Lake. Main lake was very productive and I spent the greatest amount of time there, as the numbers and variety of size was good. Northern and walleye were productive, but I spend most of my time walleye trolling. As for Chimo. Peter is a gracious host that takes care of his camps and his customers alike. Well cared for accomodations and equipment. I keep going back just for these reasons :)"
