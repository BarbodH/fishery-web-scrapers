574901,Guest,2008-06-10 17:42:00,0,Has anyone fished or going to fish Kaby Lake this year. Been there once. Just thought I would check here to see if anybody had any luck there. Flying in in late July. Thanks
574928,Guest,2008-06-11 07:59:00,0,We are going for a week starting on the 6th of July. Where do you stay?
574952,Guest,2008-06-11 20:15:00,0,We stay at Pine Portage Lodge. Like the Hilton in the woods. Very comfortable and the food is great. We usually have enough to stay at the conference center. Looking for some hot fishing spots. Have a map with some marked from our last trip. Have you been there before? Any good tips? thanks

574977,Guest,2008-06-12 07:54:00,0,We stay at Pine Portage also. I have been there 7 times starting back in the early 90's. We have had some big groups also. But this year there are only 4 of us. We usually go later in July. But decided on the 6th this year. There are 2 spots that I have never failed to catch walleye at. The back of Daveys bay on the weed edges and just north of no fish bay there is a small island. Anywhere from right at the island to about 50 yards west. If yo haven't seen this map before here is a link. Just click on each red dot and you will get a larger map of that basin.http://www.mackinacseaplanes.com/srsaire/map.htm
