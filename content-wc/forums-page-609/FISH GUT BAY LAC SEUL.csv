This year going up with a new boat with a 150 hp opti on the back & wanted to travel & try different places for a day or two. We always go to Mckenzie Bay & Manitoba point & catch plenty of fish, but want to try new places. My question is how far from Scout Lake to central part of Lac Seul past Manitoba point, the areas around Fish Gut bay, Black Bay & Aldous Bay. Anybody ever travel that far? How long? I know I can catch fish closer, just want to travel & try new places. Any help would be appreciated, thanks! EE"
574732,JDP,2008-06-06 11:08:00,1457,"It is approximately 14 miles to Manitoba Point. Approximately 18 miles to Fishgut, afew more to Black Bay and 32 miles to the far east end of Aldous Bay. I made these runs many times from Fsherman's Cove (which is located just north of SLC). When are you going to SLC? JDP"
574734,Guest,2008-06-06 11:25:00,0,I will be ariving on June 20th & staying for the week. This will be our 6th time to Lac seul & were just wanting to try new places.
574749,MOfish,2008-06-07 05:23:00,39,"This is my first post on this site. I've been lurking for about a month now, just reading about fishing. I had to start an account once I read this post. My group will also be heading to Lac Seul on June 20th. To say we're excited is an understatement. We will be staying at Onaway Lodge which is close to Scout Lake. This will be my 3rd trip and I've never fished for smallmouth because I was told they were few and far between in this region of the lake. Our last trip was 2004 and I've been reading more and more about the smallmouth. Is it worth fishing for them or should we just stick with the northern and walleye."
574790,Guest,2008-06-09 08:06:00,0,"We don't target the smallmouth, but we do seem to catch more & more every year when fishing for walleye. We've decided to try & target them this year in some of the places where we have caught them before. The central & south portion of the lake seem to have a higher population than the area around Scout Lake."
574791,CH47,2008-06-09 08:18:00,29,We fish LS around the Vaughan Bay area and have a lot of fun catching smallmouth. We find a rocky bay in the evenings and throw #7 shad raps right onto shore and drag them out and catch all kinds of smallies. Most are 18-20 inches. Of course if you get the bite at just the right time you can throw topwaters and watch the water boil. Only a couple of weeks left until our trip! CH47
574814,Guest,2008-06-09 13:23:00,0,"MOfish....what has already been said about catching the smallies is correct. I also target them in South Islet, down by the waterfall and the islands in South. Rockie points and shorelines, some of them are getting really nice size. Blair will show you where I am taking about. If you have not been to Onaway before you will Love it. Best docking and boat/fish house around, great part of the lake, and Blair and Kathy are the best. And, feeding the pet walleye and Northern under the boathouse is something to see. I will be there july 4 and have already started packing."
574847,MOfish,2008-06-10 05:05:00,39,"Steve, Thanks for the info. This will be my 3rd time staying at Onaway. You're correct. Blair and Kathy are top notch people and the accomodations are great. The only thing I could do without is the rough water when the wind picks up. Around Manitoba point can get pretty rough later in the day. I'll post how we did when we get back. 9 days and counting!"
