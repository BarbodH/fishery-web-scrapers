574986,Guest,2008-06-12 11:47:00,0,Too funny its called a unit knot two knots one at each end lol.Double uni knot is funny :rotflmao:
574987,Guest,2008-06-12 11:48:00,0,correction on spelling uni-knot
574941,fisheagle,2008-06-11 13:25:00,44,What knot do you guys use to tie super lines direct to florocarbon leaders? Specifically 10lb Fireline to 10 lb floro.

574945,Guest,2008-06-11 15:03:00,0,Yep - uni knot. Used it all year last year without any failures.

574973,Obabikon,2008-06-12 04:43:00,2370,"uni is also the knot I use. Easy to tie, strong hold!"
574980,Guest,2008-06-12 08:47:00,0,"Actually, you need to tie with a double-uni knot to keep the lines from slipping."
574983,Guest,2008-06-12 10:41:00,0,You are correct - double uni. LOL thinking about just tying a single uni on one of the lines. If you did that what ever bait/lure you had on would slip right off with your flouro leader - too funny!
574984,Guest,2008-06-12 10:46:00,0,Palamar. Won't slip and easy to tie. There isnt a better knot out there. Works for mono as well as any of the braided lines.
