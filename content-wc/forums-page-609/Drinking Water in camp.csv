574639,Guest,2008-06-04 04:32:00,0,Obabikon is correct Brita pitchers do not filter bacteria. Pur brand pitchers will.
574641,jigman 2003,2008-06-04 06:47:00,981,"Well, guess you guys are right. Did a bunch of reading and can't find anything about the Brita pitchers filtering giardia. The PUR Plus pitcher is the only one I can find that states it does filter giardia. Guess it's time for a new pitcher."
574652,Guest,2008-06-04 09:47:00,0,Just got email back from Brita and no they don't take out bacteria
574657,Obabikon,2008-06-04 12:48:00,2370,>Just got email back from Brita and no they don't take out >bacteria Thanks. I've had this conversation before though. Sound like PUR is the way to go!
574661,stevensinks,2008-06-04 14:21:00,330,We leave Friday so I dont have time to order a Pur. Who sells them? Maybe I can pick one up on the way? Thanks
574669,Obabikon,2008-06-04 15:47:00,2370,http://www.walmart.com/search/search...filter&ic=48_0 Your local walmart should have them.
574680,joeman79,2008-06-04 23:26:00,417,I got one today for Stevensink and our group. 28 hours and a wake up!!!!!!!!!
574866,alanb,2008-06-10 09:20:00,56,"I looked at the PUR box @ my local Walmart. They put the disclaimer on that you should only use water that comes from a known, safe source (e.g. what comes out of your home faucet). Just a CYA for PUR of course. My friend uses a hand pump reverse osmosis when he climbs mountains. It has a draft tube that you drop into the water. You can get these in the camping section of any sporting good store. A lot of work and time to get a single glass with this method."

Infact, we're supposed to test the pH and chlorine levels of our water on a daily basis. The sand system I use for the island is set up with 4 large filters that are replaced every 3-4 weeks. The goal is to not allow anything bigger than 1 micron into the water (I believe). Anyhow, they are backwashed every day, and are perfectly safe to drink. If a resort gets checked, then they can have some VERY hefty fines."
574606,Frankm,2008-06-03 06:11:00,154,This year with the new laws our owner put in those 5 gallon dispensers in every cabin. We were bringing bottled water the previous years. That will be one less thing next year.
574607,jigman 2003,2008-06-03 06:13:00,981,Take along a Brita pitcher and extra cartridge. We did the faucet filter at an outpost one year. It did work but due to lack of pressure it took forever to fill a jug. The last few years we just used the pitcher. Pretty amazing little deal. Water goes in with that tannic stain and comes out looking my well water at home. Also tastes much better.
574617,Guest,2008-06-03 11:07:00,0,"Tell me about the Brita. Will a new filter work for an 8 day flyout? Is it a simple as it looks, water in water out? Have you ever made Ice using it and is the Ice clean looking? Any recomended model? Thanks, looks like a perfect solution."
574620,prov1900,2008-06-03 11:46:00,544,"I got the giardia thing last year and was not impressed. Twenty trips to the toilet a night makes for little sleep. Not sure how I got it because I never drank from the tap, but brushing teeth maybe? Anyway, this year, I even brushed my teeth with with bottled water. I am at the point where I should have it by now if I am going to get it."
574621,Guest,2008-06-03 12:18:00,0,"The Brita pitchers are way easy and the filter will last weeks, at least the one in our fridge does. And the kids use at least 1-2 pitchers a day. Works good on our midwest hard water. You can't hardly stand to drink it without running it thru a Brita filter. I have never taken one to canada but will next time I go on a fly out for sure. 3 days and I will be in PARADISE!!!!"
574624,jigman 2003,2008-06-03 13:33:00,981,"Don't know the model number of mine. It's just the basic pitcher. I think 2 quart capacity. A brand new filter should do a week just fine. It does for us anyway. I usually bring an extra just in case, but we've never needed it. Never made ice with it, but would imagine the ice is clean looking. The water appears nice and clear, so I would think the ice would be similar. It is just as easy as it looks. Pour water in, wait for it to ""percolate"" through and drink. Takes no time at all."
574627,Obabikon,2008-06-03 15:50:00,2370,"I don't believe Brita's kill or remove bacteria (which is what actually makes you sick). They are more affective at removing metals and things from the water. Maybe I'm wrong, but I was always under that impression."
574631,Guest,2008-06-03 17:21:00,0,I think they do filter out bacteria. Filter system is pretty much the same as pump type water purifier I use elk hunting in Back country and it takes The bacteria out. I will research and let u know.
574634,guidedfishing,2008-06-03 18:50:00,531,"Let me tell you from personal experience, there is NO stream, lake, river, or crystal clear spring water that is perfectly safe. You are just kidding yourself. 30 years going to Canada and in 2004 I picked up a case of Giardia. Now it takes about 10 days sometimes a little less for this little beast to kick into high gear. So if you are only up for a week you will at least already be home by the time you need the antibotics. This was camp water being pumped and filtered from the lake. I now take bottled jugs, or boil the water. This is not a little case of run of the mill diarreha. I will spare you the wretched bloody details. This will damage your gut if untreated. Take care of your water supply, wash your hands and cook your food. This is coming from a guy who spent a good part of his younger life in the field as an infantry soldier. good luck all GF"
574574,Guest,2008-06-02 13:44:00,0,Do many people bring bottled water into camp? Does anyone still dip water from the lake to drink? Where does the water in camp come from? Is it pumped from a well or does it come from a pipe on the bottom of the lake?
574575,Guest,2008-06-02 13:54:00,0,I'll drink tap water at the outpost cabin as well as lake water during the day. One person in my party did come home with girardia (sp?) a.k.a Beaver Fever one year. Tough way to lose ten pounds. One guy insists on two cases of bottled water.
574576,King Canada,2008-06-02 13:55:00,27,I know the water I drink up by Red Lake comes right from the lake.
574577,rpieske,2008-06-02 14:06:00,1276,"I have both here on Lake of the Woods. I have well water running to the kitchen sink and the refrigerator. I have lake water everywhere else. The lake water is run through a sand filter and a paper filter. I drink both types and have never had a problem. Girardia was a big problem after the floods a few years back. All the beaver dams in the whole watershed burst and that water flowed into LOTW and other lakes. The incidence of Beaver Fever increased after that. I seldom drink unfiltered lake water without boiling out on the lakes, with the exception of Crow Lake which is primarily spring fed and crystal clear."
574580,back357,2008-06-02 14:47:00,106,"I know the camp I go to uses lake water for the taps, but does have well water that the owner uses to fill 5 gal containers for each cabin as often as needed. We bring bottled water (or Gatorade) for out on the boats."
574589,Oldschool,2008-06-02 18:59:00,163,"According to the camp owner where I have fished for some years, Ontario legislated that camp owners provide only filtered water to the guests.

574592,Pooch,2008-06-02 19:42:00,4619,"One remote camp we fish pumps lake water into an elevated fiberglass tank. (Set up like a water tower) Then has a filter on each cabin. We have never had a problem. To avoid any problems on a trip, last year I took a filter that screws onto the faucet and ran our drinking water through the filter into a large pitcher we kept in the fridge. Filter is slow, but has a bypass when you want dish water or wash your hands. The filter came from Wal-Mart or one of the big boxes. Grab an extra filter cartridge while your there. It might be a ""Pur"" filter, can't remember. Made my wife a lot happier. Pooch"
574593,Guest,2008-06-02 19:54:00,0,Play it safe and only use bottled water to drink. Nothing worse than having the Hershey squirts while you are on a long awaited Canadian fishing trip. Have fun!
574595,lassh,2008-06-02 20:20:00,553,We don't take bottled water on a flyin. We used to boil a big pot of water every day for drinking and ice just to be safe. Now we use a filter pump for drinking water. I think its called a Katydid. Its for hikers and campers. They have them at Gander Mt. It will filter out Giardia.
574599,Catman59,2008-06-02 21:31:00,345,I drank water out of Sturgeon Lake for several years . That was all they had. As of last year they now have fresh well water in camp.
