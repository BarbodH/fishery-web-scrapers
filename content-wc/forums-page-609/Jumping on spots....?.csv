574926,lazyk,2008-06-11 07:36:00,26,"A few years ago I was fishing a reef with my brother`s boat thirty yards away from me on a lake near Kenora. It was a beautiful evening with no other boats in sight. As we were fishing, a boat trolled up the shoreline and curved out toward us and eventually trolled right between our boats. Now this was a day after we were fishing another reef and a boat from Missouri pulled up a few feet from our boat. I was already very frustrated. So I got a little mouthy and mentioned what I thought about his ethics. He trolled away and I thought that was that. The next day when I was going across the lake to another spot I noticed a boat following me. When I stopped to fish, he pulled up real close and it was around then that I realized he was the same guy from the night before. Now it became apparent he was very mad at me for `calling his wife names`, which I didn`t. Now as I think back it struck me as a fairly dangerous situation. I actually thought for the first time he might have a gun in the boat and there is no law on what types of people can own boats. Cooler heads prevailed and we explained why we were frustrated and he backed off. But I`ll never forget him pulling up aggressively like that and being in a remote area, the last thing I want is someone to go postal on me. I just can`t understand why people would want to invade someone`s space like that. It`s the same feeling I get when someone cuts in line or when traffic goes down to one lane and some one drives past on the shoulder only to cut ahead of you. Just remember to keep a cool head or we`ll soon be reading about `boat rage` incidents in the newspapers. Lazyk"
574930,PJM,2008-06-11 08:16:00,3516,"Obabikon I can't believe you are the guy that posted this topic Proper fishing etiquette"". The spot you were fishing you probably stole from someone else and as owner of a resort I am surprised you ad mitt to doing something so childish as that."
574931,Guest,2008-06-11 08:41:00,0,Very interesting reading these posts I think there is another category of fisherman out there the one that just flat out don't know any better they fish once a year and really enjoy the social aspect of it. Don't get me wrong I'm not saying its right but I have a friend that is Mr. Chatterbox and I had the misfortune of fishing in the same boat one year and literally every spot he picked that day he would run right up next to another boat and started chatting how they biting? Where Ya from? Where ya staying? How are the owners? Just a chatten away it was embarrassing a couple a times I would say something to him but it just whistled over his head That's just the start of it I have to deer hunt w/ him I can actually here him get into his stand 300 yard away of course its an hour after I've gotten into my stand cuz he's wondered the woods looking for his stand w/ his trusty floodlight. I think some people are just kinda clueless when it comes to this. He's my best friend and I wouldn't trade him for anything!
574852,Guest,2008-06-10 07:00:00,0,I live in Canada and we have the same issues in my part of the country--boils down to lack of respect for others. Last weekend I found some walleyes in a short area and had a few boaters see me net them and then decided to troll on through--I'm used to this so I was able to backtroll parallel to them to keep them far enough out--that happens pretty frequently. The best I ever seen though was last fall there was a floatilla of boats fishing a deep water shoreline for smallies--a lot casting up to shore. We were fishing the deep fish off a piece of structure and doing very well---lots of fish and good size. Anyway as we were somewhat stationary I would move off my structure a bit if a boat was trolling up the shoreline casting baits looking for shallow fish (Which I noticed were smaller)--I figured we were not targeting the same fish so I was trying to be polite. Here's the kicker this one nice person came up the shore and again I moved back to allow him to work the shoreline and he pulled up on my spot and stayed---now that was the height of inconsideration---funny thing was I guess that Triton bass boat did'nt make him a better fisherman. Sorry for the length--I'm not sure where mankind is headed but there going without basic values. Eastern Guy
574853,Obabikon,2008-06-10 07:18:00,2370,">Teach'em a lesson. 75ft rooster and cutting donuts around >their boat and thrownin full beer cans at them. That shows >them what character is all about. I'm sure they will be more >respectful next time I'm not saying it's right, there's definately a lack of etiquette on the lake these days. Two wrongs don't make a right, but the 2nd wrong did make me feel better about the jerk who was trying to steal a spot that he didnt' even know about. It's a lack of respect for fishing. I swear that golf is the last sport that proper etiquette is even talked about."
574857,Guest,2008-06-10 07:43:00,0,"Well the point of our trip is to have a good time and catch some fish. We don't let the little stuff rub us wrong or if it does it usually doesn't last long. Having fished alot in Mn. during the opener and fished early on Lac Suel near the sanctuary I am used to fish CLOSE to other boats. If it get to crowded I move on HAVE A GOOD,SAFE,FUN vacation and above all RELAX"
574862,alanb,2008-06-10 08:49:00,56,"I agree on the lack of respect. Why should we expect people who drive their cars like jerks to behave any different when they drive their boat? We were up for opening weekend and this happen twice! First was in Obabikon Bay - drifting over structure and had someone motor right past us while we were on the drift and parked over a spot - should have let the boat drift into them! Second was trolling around a point - got a nice walleye and before we could get turned around to jig the spot, a boat with a guide was on the spot. At least for us, the jumping on happened with local fishermen. Perhaps we should replace the word ""man"" with something more appropriate."
574864,Guest,2008-06-10 08:58:00,0,"Oh boy, you guys would love the mouth of the river up by Ear Falls. You get 20 boats within a 9-iron of you. Great stuff, literally can hold 'talking' discussions with them...."
574882,Guest,2008-06-10 13:56:00,0,"Do what I do when you mark a bunch of fish. Mark it on the GPS, move a couple hundred yards, take your bright pink marker bouy and fling it as close to shore as you can get it. (with out being to obvious) Then watch them zoom in and snag on the rocks for a hour or so. JohnB.O.A.T."

574910,Hump,2008-06-10 19:49:00,578,"Many years ago my Dad owned a cabin in Minnesota. Our bay was big and great for fishing. Every evening around 7:00, here came the resorters, as my dad referred to them. One night, he went and placed a milk jug, with about 70 Ft. of line and a big rock ,as anchor and dropped it in the middle of the lake. we then went and had cocktails on our dock and watched as the ""resorters"" would barrel down, drop anchor by the jug and then proceed to drift down the bay, pull up, go back...etc. It was a fun night and one I will always rember and laugh about."
574912,JDP,2008-06-10 20:01:00,1457,"I was on Lac Seul May 17th-24th this year. My partner and I were anchored about 40 feet from shore in a bay. There were maybe 2 or 3 other boats in the bay no closer than 1/2 mile from us. We were eating our lunch and float fishing for walleyes with our floats between 5 and 15 feet from shore. Along commes a boat trolling with a bow mount MINNKOTA. HE ATTEMPTED TO TROLL BETWEEN MY FLOAT AND SHORE!!! MY FLOAT WAS LESS THAN 10 FEET FROM SHORE AT THE TIME. HE PROCEEDED TO RUN UP ON SHORE WITH HIS MINNKOTA!!!! UN&$%^%&%^BELIEVEABLE! THE ""DRIVER"" PROCEEDED TO LIFT THE MINNKOTA UP AND PUSH AWAY FROM SHORE, NEARLY RUNNING OVER MY LINE---WHICH I WAS REELING IN AT THE TIME. Never in my over 50 years of fishing have I seen anything like that!!!! JDP"

574825,Pooch,2008-06-09 17:56:00,4619,"Phish, It was a fly-out lake! That's what makes it so incredibly nuts. This is a lake that you can find fish virtually any place you stop. Reef, weeds, points whatever. Pooch"
574827,orchard frank,2008-06-09 18:34:00,1900,"You are making an assumption that you ""found"" the spot, others may have known about it for years. Not excusing people moving in too close, but it is possible that the other boat was saying ""oh no, somebody is on OUR spot"". I had about a hundred waypoints on Lac Seul, had a guideboat from Anderson's give me an earful because he thought I was on on of his spots, even though I was already there when he came around the corner. The tounament thing can work both ways too. Try to be out fun-fishing someday on a hot spot during a tourney. You are likely to see some pretty aggressive behavior from the contestents."
574831,Guest,2008-06-09 19:22:00,0,"There is no such thing as ""your spot"" so if someone moves in either out fish them or move on"
574834,Guest,2008-06-09 19:50:00,0,"Here's one........this guy and his wife came roaring up to where we were fishing between 2 islands and he plops down his trolling motor and trolls right up to us (we were drift fishing walleyes) and starts chatting!!! ""Where ya from?"" the whole time he is tossing his jig right on top of ours. Then our friend in the another boat about 70 yds away catches one and he trolls right over there (mach 1)and does the same thing...""Where ya from??"" Must be a new technique.....pretend you are friendly and poach someone elses fish."
574837,Obabikon,2008-06-09 20:25:00,2370,"I agree there is no such thing as ""your spot"". However, the first person fishing the spot should get dibs. Unless you're fishing on a small lake, it's rude to pull up next to someone. Even if they're fishing where you'd like to fish. Fish somewhere else until they leave, and then you can have the spot."
574838,Pooch,2008-06-09 20:38:00,4619,"I don't think anyone said anything about ""my spot"" or ""your spot"". The original post was talking about staying away from another fellow who like you, just wants to enjoy a little down time. Common courtesy. Not pulling up next to other folks and interfering with their enjoyment because you can't find your own fish or haven't done your home work before hitting the water. How many times have most of us on this board spent half an hour or more motoring to a distant ""spot"" only to find another boat already in the area? Not a big deal. The right thing to do is to leave them alone and go someplace else. Whether we agree or disagree with doing that speaks volumes about our character. Pooch"
574843,dirt,2008-06-10 00:56:00,144,Totally agree Pooch. If our group comes across people fishing a spot we want to we just leave them be. We fish on a big lake (Gullrock) and there are usually plenty of places to fish. I go fishing to get away from it all. The last thing I want is a crowd. :cheers:
574848,Guest,2008-06-10 05:49:00,0,"I've had this happen to us a few times in Canada while fishing for walleye. It is annoying, yet the Minnesota guys in our group seem to take it in stride (as 'a given'?) -- it must happen a lot more often in MN? I've gotten so I just put up with it or leave. What bothers me more is when I've been working a shoreline for nice smallmouth, and someone that's been watching us for an hour off shore (as they walleye fish) decides they are going to work the same shoreline -- and cuts in 50 yard ahead of us. One year we ""Leap Frogged"" about 2 miles of shoreline with one boat; neither one of us would give in. However, lately I just go to the other end of the shoreline and fish toward them until we meet. ...but on the 'drive by' I like to make sure the jackplate is set to throw a 75' rooster tail! Chuck"
574850,phishfearme,2008-06-10 06:19:00,1242,"pooch - sorry, i wasn't clear when i said fly-in outpost - i shoulda said the rent-a-lake type where you're the only cabin on the lake or lake system. seeing anybody else on these lakes is a minor miricle - usually canoers. in any event, spot jumping is just plain irritating - i did like the ""get naked"" idea. adding a ""gay"" voice imitation may help further! phish"
574851,Guest,2008-06-10 06:57:00,0,Teach'em a lesson. 75ft rooster and cutting donuts around their boat and thrownin full beer cans at them. That shows them what character is all about. I'm sure they will be more respectful next time
574810,Pooch,2008-06-09 11:57:00,4619,"You don't have to be catching fish for them to move in on you! Surely with nearly 100,000 acres of good fishing and seldom more than a dozen boats on the lake there are more fish to catch than under another guys boat. Besides being naked do we have to wink at them also? I think I hit a nerve here. Pooch"
574811,Guest,2008-06-09 12:31:00,0,"Sorry guys, just a little jab from my guiding days.....lol"
574812,phishfearme,2008-06-09 12:39:00,1242,"pooch - what you experiened is one of the reasons we started doing fly-in outposts - it's only your group there. there's a biological maxim that is very true - in a given body of water, 90% of the fish reside in 10% of the water. those spots are all yours at a fly-in outpost - but it sure is getting expensive!! phish"
574813,Guest,2008-06-09 13:09:00,0,"Pooch...This has been a more and more common in recent years. Guys actually running over the bouy marker, cutting into an area less than 20yds from my boat while trolling, etc. etc. Yes the lake is free to fish where you wish, but common decency and having a moral compass should account for something. I really like the idea of doing donuts around the offender. Last year my brother and I were fishing a very small hump (2-3 ft deep) between 2 islands (about 40 yd between)when this very large boat comes blasting through cutting right between the islands, throwing a wake big enough to capsize us, luckily for him (unluckily for us) he did not hit bottom with his prop, but it had to have been close. After waving with the one finger salute, we moved on, to locate another mid-lake hump. We tossed out the markers to begin a drift and here comes the same boat roaring in to share our spot. When we got back to camp the owners calmly said ""must be from Leech Lake"". How do you create a traffic jam in MN? Throw out a marker bouy!"
574816,dirt,2008-06-09 13:58:00,144,This has been a more and more common problem for our group as well. Once we had a group of three boats (all from the same cabin) fishing a hump. We were taking turns going over the hump and with each pass we´d pick up a few eyes. Suddenly this moron shows up and actually serpentines between our three boats at one point coming within about 5 feet of one of the boats! There was hardly another boat on the lake! I don´t see how people can actually not feel guilty about that kind of behavior. We now carry a couple of old Marker bouys without string or weight and throw them out if people get too close. Call it idiot bait. I´m thinking about making No Trespassing signs for the boat this year as well. :banghead: Can´t wait - we leave in 11 days!!!
574817,AllenW,2008-06-09 14:00:00,11482,"It works both ways, years back I had a tourny fisherslug come up to me and demand I move as I was in his spot, I wasn't in the tourny but I did tell him that if he got any closer than the 10 yards he was from me, I was gonna imbed a reef hawk in him. 4-5 years ago I had two old timers back troll right into our anchored boat, musta been deaf as we yelled and they never heard us. Had to stick our feet out to stop them...go figure. A little consiteration goes a long ways here. Al"
574818,Muskygary,2008-06-09 14:06:00,137,I do something simular with marker buoys also. I make up some spare buoys out of Pennzoil cans (bright yellow) attach some old fishing line and a bottom weight. When you go into a bay throw them out three or four hundred yards from you in deep water. Most of the boats spotting them will go over and fish around them!!
574819,Guest,2008-06-09 14:40:00,0,Do it all the time. If there is a community spot where there are 4 5 or 6 boats fishing I stop and give things a try. Boats come and go never had a problem with fishing next to people. I like to sleep in so if I drive across the lake and there is someone fish where I planned to fish well that's where I'm fishin
574823,Guest,2008-06-09 16:26:00,0,That is why we go to Canada early in the spring and very late in the fall.It seems that there are less community spots when the community is smaller and more considerate.
574824,Guest,2008-06-09 16:27:00,0,"Use to happen to us on Gullrock ALL the time. That is why we fly in now! Anyway, they would come right in behind us or beside us. We even got lines caught in there prop trolling before cause they were that close. Also came up beside when jigging--my buddy finally whipped a full can of beer at them one time--we were pissed cause it was a full can!!!"
574784,Pooch,2008-06-09 05:30:00,4619,"I had thought this wouldn't happen in Canada, but it did. Last year we had boats drive right up to us and park on a spot that we had found. We could be anywhere and see them motoring across the lake and they must spot us or any boat and you could see them turn and head right at us. Huge Canadian lake, few boats on the lake. It was really frustrating after a few days. We finally would move before they got to us or as soon as we noticed they were headed our way. What's up with that? Is this behavior just the way people are now days? What a shame. I suppose it's just another sign of the dumbing down and lowering morals of our people. Sorry for the rant, but this really saddens me for our collective society. Pooch"
574793,CH47,2008-06-09 08:24:00,29,"Pooch, I guess you and your crew are just too good at catching fish so that is whey they want to follow you! Next time, try this: When you see them coming at you, everyone in your boat strip naked. When they get within earshot give a friendly wave. I'll bet they won't stick around long."
574794,Hump,2008-06-09 08:27:00,578,"It happened to us also. We were trolling a very small area, went to turn and there they were. The ironic thing is I believe it was someone that i corresponded with about the lake and places to go. He told me he would be with his son and he was from Nebraska. The person( I am being nice) has a young man in the boat and a Neb. hat. I is just plain courtesy not to do that."
574796,luv2fishcanada,2008-06-09 08:32:00,41,"Had the same thing happen to me last year. Was working a weed point all by ourselves trolling back and forth with crawlers when a guy pulls up and drops an anchor right were we had been going. Snooze you lose pal, I was there first and I let him know it."

574803,Guest,2008-06-09 10:39:00,0,"I've never felt like I owned a spot because I got there first. But I always thought you should go with the flow.(if people ar trolling troll, drifting then drift etc) We were at a flyin lodge and had three boats. We had found a spot that we could drift over and get a couple everytime. We would take turns drifting through this spot. After about 20 minutes of this a boat came driving up and anchored right over the spot. I guess they knew about it too."
574804,Guest,2008-06-09 10:41:00,0,"Seems to be happening more all the time. We see it virtually every time we are out in WI and IA, as well. Last year, in Canada, we were fishing a spot, with nobody in sight. Before too long, three boats came into the bay we are on (about 500 acres, so big bay). All three boats zeroed right in on us and fished in the same small area (one good cast away). Walleye fishing in some pretty skinny water and one boat was loud, banging tackle boxes, yelling, etc. Well it did not take long for a good spot to become marginal. It does seem as if the problem is getting worse, but perhaps its just because there are more boats out there than ever before. Cheers,,,,IA Walleye (3.5 days and counting until Lac Seul)"

(Even when you are not catching) It gets frustrating at times, the worst offenders are the tourist up here. I understand that they want to catch fish on there vacation,I can appreciate that. I freely give them information on non tournament days."

574809,Obabikon,2008-06-09 11:51:00,2370,"Weekenders in their own boat are the absolute worst. Too cheap to hire a guide, so they try to steal everyone elses. I was fishing crappies in Obabikon Lake once. We were catching them off of one of the sunken trees in the middle of the lake. It was getting later in the day, and a boat pulled up and started fishing within 15 feet of us. Of course they weren't catching a thing, because I held the boat over the tree. They moved even closer, and I said, ""come on man""! The idiot goes, ""it's a free lake"". I ask my friends to pull up, and we did doughnuts around their bass boat. It wasn't the most mature reaction, but they eventually left. We spooked off the crappies, but we were done anyways. Either hire a guide, or find your own spots."
