574096,Guest,2008-05-20 17:18:00,0,Hey Guys and Girls Well I just made it back yesterday from our annual May long weekend fishing trip - it is a group of 10 to 15 guys that make an annual trip to find some walleye and pike...well this year 12 guys made it out and we hit Nemio on the Gouin Reservoir - thanks to the recommendations from Bill (McQ) When we left on Thurs evening the weather did not look promising - but it we only received some scattered showers on Sunday and that was it...nice blue skies all weekend. We arrived around noon Friday morning after a great drive in - the road was in great shape - met with Ron and Rosie (which are 2 of the nicest lodge owners I have ever met) - they really go out of there way to make sure you have a great time and catch fish - also Bill was there - it was great to finally meet him also and have a couple of beers with him. We quickly stored our stuff in our cabins and hurried down to the boats - Ron took us on a guided tour of the area - pointing out hot spots to try along the way as well as the rocks - we then arrived at our destination a small section of water near the spawning area - what a great spot - we fished this area most of the weekend and it produced some very nice fish - our largest walleye was just over 5 pounds and our biggest pike was around 17 pounds - it is an amazing fishery - I have never had fishing that great....our group immediately booked for next year. Nemio is a first class operation - one of the best ran camps I have ever seen - a few guys in our group did the American plan - and they raved about the huge portions for both breakfast and dinner. Can't wait for May 09 Uncle P
