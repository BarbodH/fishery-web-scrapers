574328,Guest,2008-05-27 07:14:00,0,"Going up the following week and am interested as well. For those that know - how is the water level? Are the northerns active or was dead bait effective? From a previous post I had heard the mouth of the river at the east end of the lake is a spot to try, but what other spots have been good?"

Also, got stopped at the US side, and they went through our stuff, nothing major though, just a quick check. Fishing was good. there were several eyes caught in the upper 20's with 29.5 being the biggest that our group brought in. Fish were in 17 to 23 depth range. Didn't fish for pike much."
