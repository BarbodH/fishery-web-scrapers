534931,Guest,2003-09-11 21:43:00,0,I would put serious consideration into Buenavista resort in the morson area of LOTW. The will treat you well and there is always somewhere to catch fish!
535104,Guest,2003-09-21 07:25:00,0,"check out Trip Finder on http://justfishontario.com/trip_finder.htm you will hear from a whole bunch of lodges that are offering just what you are looking for. it worked for us last year, we found a new camp and it was great. The Woods is a good bet. Big everything there."
535144,idapaul,2003-09-23 15:48:00,82,"i suggest sand point,namakan,kabetogama or crane lake. these lakes areright on the border,and are part of the rainy lake system. prices are cheaper and fishing is just as good. have fished up there for 10 years on both sides of the border. there is no muskie but the northerns are fun and there are lake trout. smallies are very good on all of these lakes. any questions e mail me"
535146,NC,2003-09-23 19:55:00,231,"idapaul, Thanks for the input. Any resorts in particular? Would like a shot at muskies, but big northern are fine as well. Have you caught many there? Thanks for the help. NC"

Have >you caught many there? >Thanks for the help. >NC no resort preference but there are two ways you can go. the area on the us side is voyageur national park and there are 140 camp sites spread throughout the park for free. as far as resorts there are only three main areas, kabetogama lake which has two of the areas, the web site is kabetogama.com and ash river trail, web site is ashriver.com. the other area is crane lake, web site is visitcranelake.com. my biggest northern to date was 13 lbs caught on a 10 inch sucker. every year that i go with scouts i put the kids on many in the 25 to 35 inch range. if you pm me i will tell you some of the resorts i did not like and the reasons"
535188,NC,2003-09-26 12:18:00,231,"NC, Thanks for the info. My email is [email protected]. I check it every few days if you want to send me more info. We would only consider the resorts (camping isn't out thing), but thanks anyway. I'll check out the sights and be in touch. NC"
534877,NC,2003-09-09 14:18:00,231,"Looking to schedule our first trip to Canada for next year. Like to fish for Pike/Muskie, Smallies and Walleye in no particular order. Live in Des Moines, IA and am really not interested in going 4-5 hours into Canada. Is LOTW my best bet or are there some lakes w/in an hour of I.Falls which we should consider? Any links to websites would be apprecieted. Also, we do bring our own boats so the docks/harbors must be nice. Best time of year? Thanks, NC"
534878,Gary_IA,2003-09-09 15:14:00,144,You might try Phil Rolfe's website tripfinder. You input what your wants are and the resorts contact you. The website is: http://www.justfishontario.com I suggest you check out Canadian Resorts on Rainy Lake. This is a huge lake so you might want to use a shore based resort rather than a boat in resort several miles away.
534879,Gary_IA,2003-09-09 15:23:00,144,I should add look at resorts arroung the Morson Ontario area. The website with links to resorts and lodges:http://www.kenoraontario.net/Morson/resorts.htm
534884,Guest,2003-09-09 21:32:00,0,I'm in Morson on Lake of the Woods. For info check buenavistaresort.com
534887,Gary_IA,2003-09-10 03:44:00,144,Website with links for Fort Frances area:http://www.cottage-resort.com/ontario-fort-frances.htm
534890,Guest,2003-09-10 08:04:00,0,For your first trip I would recommed the following resorts. The owners and staff will take very good care of you. You should be able to track down a couple hundred fish a week at any of these resorts. LOW - Morson - Red Pine or Hidden Island LOW - Souix Narrows - White Pine on Snake Bay Rainy - Fort Francis - Taylor's Cove Lac Suel - Ear Falls - Golden Fawn or Evergreen
534891,Guest,2003-09-10 08:37:00,0,"For your first trip go to Lac Seul. It is a Walleye factory and holds plenty of great Pike and bonus Smallmouth. I have not seen one poor fishing reprt from a Walleye Central user on Lac Seul. The fish are plentiful and have great size. Many fish 22"" + and 26"" + are not uncommon."
534893,Guest,2003-09-10 12:58:00,0,"Lac Seul is 4-5 hours from the border, but well worth the drive. Plenty of places in LOTW, but I would still recommend the extra drive to Lac Seul."
534897,Guest,2003-09-10 16:56:00,0,"www.witchbay.com Look especially at the ""Fishing Reports"" and ""Gabbin' with Gail"" sections to review just what customers think about the place. They have a significant amount of repeat customers. Good luck and have fun with whatever you come up with. Lunker"
534901,fishmaster,2003-09-10 20:25:00,209,Check out Eagle Lake and Vernilion Bay Lodge. Only a little over 2 1/2 hours into Canada and the fishing is great. The lodge site for you to look into iswww.vermilionbaylodge.com
