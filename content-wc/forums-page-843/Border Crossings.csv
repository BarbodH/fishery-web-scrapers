535139,IaDave,2003-09-23 09:02:00,476,I went thru Ft. Frances and they asked us if we had any and we didn't and I got a strange look when I said no. The taters for our group was in another vehicle which came thru 10 mins. after us and they didn't ask them.
535143,idapaul,2003-09-23 15:37:00,82,i went into canada with a group of boy scouts at a remote crossing on sand point lake and they took a hundred pounds from us. we just bought some canadian potatoes from a resort on the canadian side end of problem. i'm told dried potatoes would have been ok.
535175,Guest,2003-09-25 20:10:00,0,"We crossed with forty pounds of potatoes (there were ten of us in two vehicles) on Sept 12. We were never asked whether we had any potatoes. Perhaps in their glee over collecting $160 in duty for the 32 cases of beer and two gallons of booze we hauled in, they just forgot."
