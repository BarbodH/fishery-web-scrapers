The fishing was excellent and believe it or not we got board of catching Walleye and spent some considerable time seeking out smallies. One question I had was in regard to the number of Walleye species that are in Crowduck. We caught numerous what I would consider typical Walleye (dark green, perch colored) However in the mouth to Dark Bay we caught a species I have not seen before, they where almost trout colored and had an irregular skull, almost appeared like humps above the eyes. They where also skinnier and not much of a girth. Has anyone else seen these and what or where did they come from."

By definition, different species can't mate and have offspring that will be fertile. You can have different but closely related species mate and have offspring but they will be infertile (can't produce offspring). An example of this would be a musky and a northern pike. Their offspring are infertile and will be 'tiger' musky's. Subspecies occur when species are geographically separated for long periods of time and thus will develop different characteristics which allow for better survival rates. Over a longer period of time, they may ultimately become different species and be unable to successfully mate."
