Nice to see the sign put up to advise people to prepare their boats on top of the hill. Now all they need is a sign for the inconsiderate ones who park in the ""turn around"" spot. Can't believe someone would do this when there is only 12 boat trailers there??? Water is easily a couple of feet lower, for those coming up soon do be cautious going past the first red buoy heading out to the lake (stay to the right of the buoy....like one should). Was jigging on the humps south ofthe red buoy and ran across 5-6 feet of water. Also watch around Treaty Island...same story. Fished the river and lake all day and only managed to boat a pile of white bass, silver bass, mooneye, and one lonely sauger. No greenbacks in our boats and the ones around us. Water is still warm.....forecast is calling for 1C and 2C on Tuesday and Wednesday night. Hope this gets things moving. No current."

Some other ""notes"" * Clarks Corner has got their live minnow tanks back in business. * Clarks Corner also has added a collection of Breyers Hard Ice Cream flavors! Nice treat after a ""hot"" day of fishing. * Highway #304 - some nice ""patch up"" work on the last 10 minutes into Pine Falls."

Ice Cream and live bait, two of my most favorite things Eh. ;) With a bit of new rain maybe the new flows would pull the baitfish up and the walleye with them?
