First of all, I have never seen the water this low in the 17 years I have been fishing this lake. It certainly didn't affect the fishing for us. Considering the numbers and size of the fish we caught it was certainly one of, if not the best, weeks I've ever had on the lake. Hats off once again to Jerry and Sally Lundy, owners of Lundy's camp. I can't imagine there being a better run fishing camp with more accomodating hosts anywhere in Ontario. We caught a lot of very nice fish with four fish 24 inches plus released and probably a three dozen or more 20 inches plus released. There were too many 18-19 inch fish to begin to count. The most productive spot was about 60 to 80 yards directly west of Devil's Point in 28-32 feet of water. Most were caught on Hopkins spoons with some of the other guys catching them with jigs and minnows. The flats between the two points east of Birch Island were also very good, particularly in the evenings. Most were taken in 28-35 feet of water with either Hopkins spoons or jigs and minnows. The northern pike fishing was pretty slow, but we didn't make much of an effort at it. We were too busy catching walleyes. There was one 38 incher taken and a few other 30 inch plus fish. The smallmouth fishing was slower than in the past few years also. With the low water levels and warmer water temperatures, the smallies weren't in their usual spots. There were several nice smallies in the 16-18 inch range taken, but they were not as plentiful as in past years. We got 5 1/2 inches of rain Tuesday night and Wednesday and the lighting kept us off the lake Wednesday afternoon. It didn't seem to slow the fishing down at all as we topped off the week with another great day of catching walleyes on Thursday. I wish the Candadians would go to 24 hour days like the U.S. Those twelve hour Canadian days just make a week go by way too fast."

Sounds like nice fishing right now too."

535097,Guest,2003-09-20 21:21:00,0,"When we were at Lundy's camp, Jerry wouldn't even speak to us unless we were ""the pit boss"". Anything we wanted at their camp had to go through ""the pit boss"". After being there a week and not being spoken to once, we decided once was enough!"
535098,Guest,2003-09-21 02:19:00,0,"I can only base my opinion on my own experience. I'm not the so-called ""pitboss"" of my group and I've always found Jerry very approachable. I've been going there since before he bought the camp and have known him from the start. I will say this. Jerry works very hard to make sure that his guests have a pleasant experience in his camp. He has a tremendous amount on his mind and doesn't have a lot of time for small talk. I've always understood that and have never had a problem with it. I do know that if you have a problem that it will be attended to promptly. After raining all night Tuesday night, Jerry was down at the dock well before daylight Wednesday morning bailing out our boats before we went fishing. It takes a lot of work to stay on top of things at any fishing camp. With that camp being on an island twelve miles out, Jerry has a unique set of problems to deal with that most camp owners don't. I've been to several other fishing camps and Lundy's is head and shoulders above any of them. That camp runs at or nearly at capacity for the entire season year in and year out so they must be doing something right. Your mileage may vary."
535099,Guest,2003-09-21 02:24:00,0,"Hey Jim D, nice report. Spoke to some guys from here in Allison, IA that did really well this week also up there. Their props were even still in good shape!!! Heard alot of horror stories this summer from different groups hitting rocks, but the most unusual one was supposedly a couple weeks ago a guy was anchored out on Wabby and decided to start up the boat and take off. He had an inboard motor and got a little ways up the lake when the motor just quit. They couldn't figure out what happened until one of them noticed the anchor rope all frayed off the side of the boat...man I'd hate to have that happen and have to explain that to the guys in camp about leaving the anchor out!!! I guess it tore the motor to pieces according to a friend that was there when it happened. I've waterskiied my minnow pails several times but not the anchor yet. Was wondering also what are Hopkins spoons, and were they catching fish at same rates as jig/minnow?"
535100,Guest,2003-09-21 02:53:00,0,"Here is a link to the homepage for Hopkins lures. http://www.hopkinslures.com/index.php We were using 1/4 ounce spoons jigged vertically over the side of the boat bouncing them fairly rapidly 12-18 inches off the bottom and letting them fall. The walleye take them as they are falling and go after them much more agressively than they do a jig and minnow with a much smaller percentage of misses. They seem to work equally as well and many times better than a jig and minnow when the fish are really active. Three of the four 24 inch plus fish and a good majority of the 20 inch and over fish were caught on the Hopkins spoons. The 38 inch northern pike (13 1/2 lbs) was also taken on a spoon while fishing for walleye in about 30 feet of water. There were also a few smallmouth taken (one of them 18 1/2 inches) with the spoons so they are a very versatile lure. There were and usually are occasions when the fish seem to want the live bait only, but I fished almost exclusively with the spoons for four of the six days and about half and half the other two days."
