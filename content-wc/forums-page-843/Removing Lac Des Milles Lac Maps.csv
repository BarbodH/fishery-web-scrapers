There was no literature on these maps other than Marge's Print Shop and they went out of business years ago. I went and assumed I can use these maps but the M.N.R. has copy rights to them. They gave me an option of basically advertising for them and other places that are going to be selling newer versions of this map but I opted out as I would not be able to add any more maps and they would ""tell"" me what goes on my site. So therefore these maps will be removed by Wed night. Hint Hint. Roger Mayer."
