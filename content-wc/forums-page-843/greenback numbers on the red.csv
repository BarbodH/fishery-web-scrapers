535113,walleyedude,2003-09-21 20:51:00,34,"Not exactly the most scientific analysis, however your data seems to be a bit odd.2002 and 2001 were considered to be the worst years for greenbacks in recent history, 1998 and 1999 were among the best in the 20 years I have been fishing the river.I live in Winnipeg so I fish the Red a lot. 1998 I logged 22 walleye over the Master Angler minimum of 28""of which 10 were over 30"".1999 I caught 17 Masters, of which 11 were over 30""( 6 in one outing!)My records for 2001 and 2002 were 9 and 7.My data for Pine falls is close,16 for '98, 14 for '99, 3 for '01 and 1 for '02. I do not fish Pine falls as much as the Red.The year 2000 was just an average year, 13 on the Red and 9 on Pine falls.So far this year I have 2 on the Red, both just over 28"", hav'nt been out to Pine Falls yet. Fluctuations in fish numbers on both systems is normal,I will not worry until we have more than 3 bad seasons in a row."
