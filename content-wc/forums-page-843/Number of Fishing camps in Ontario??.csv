535103,Guest,2003-09-21 07:22:00,0,I would say close to 800 camps. there are 70 on http://justfishontario.com/ and this is only about 1/4 of what is in northwestern Ontario. Bet the farm on this one.
534724,Guest,2003-08-31 13:55:00,0,"I need your help. an acquaintance of mine claims there are only 155 resorts/camps in all of Ontario. he normally is right about everything, however, I think he is way way off on this one. Does anyone know of a place I can get this information? Thanks."
534726,Guest,2003-08-31 15:25:00,0,"I have no idea but I would be willing to bet $1000 he is wrong on this one....after thinking about some more....make that $10,000."
534728,Guest,2003-08-31 16:33:00,0,"Remember, there are about 100,000 lakes in Ontario alone. Even if only 1% of the lakes have a resort on them, that is 1000 resorts. We all know, many lakes have many more than one resort on them and at the same time, many more lakes than not probably have no resorts on them at all, BUT, my money still is that it is WAY more than 155 resorts total in all of Ontario."
534737,Gary_IA,2003-09-01 07:59:00,144,"I'm not sure of the total number but I believe NOTO, Northern Ontario Tourism Outfitters Association has more than 470 members and not all of the resorts are members. I suppose you could go to the Ontario government website and start searching and searching. Some bureau must have this information."
534759,Guest,2003-09-02 09:44:00,0,"He has to be WAY off, there are probably 1/4 of that on LOTW alone."
534761,Ia Walihntr,2003-09-02 11:51:00,320,"Has to be well over 155 resorts on Lake of the Woods and imeadiate surrounding lakes. (Crow, Caliper,Clearwater-Pipestone chain, Minaki lakes on Winnepeg river, etc.)There are 15 to 20 resorts within 10 miles of Morson. Probably 20 resorts or more near Nestor Falls. Probably 20 or more near Sioux Narrows. Probably 20 more in the Angle-inlet Clearwater Bay area. Probably 20 more in Warrod-Baudette-Sleeman area. Probably 30 or more along the north side of LOTW. Counting just these, I think we're close to 155 already and we've only counted LOTW area. My guess would be at least 400 drive in resorts alone. Shall we include the fly-ins--------"
534771,bigfish1965,2003-09-02 16:05:00,3210,I live in Niagara...there's more than 155 here alone. :)
534772,McQ,2003-09-02 16:18:00,615,"As a reference point Quebec has over 700 outfitters - knowing that, the Ontario numbers should be over or around a 1000."
534781,Guest,2003-09-03 07:34:00,0,"Having served on the board of directors of NOTO and such I can say that there are approximatly 1600 licenced outfitters in the province, about 1/3 are NOTO members( the figure of 470 is close,maybe a bit low). There are other 'bootleg' operators also, always someone looking to beat the system and cut corners and taxes. Point is, your buddy is a bit low to say the least."
