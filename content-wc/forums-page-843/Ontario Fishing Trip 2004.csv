534742,Gary_IA,2003-09-01 11:09:00,144,"If you want to try close to the border for an older basic no frills fishing camp with daily rates, you might try Cascade Camp, next to Devil's Cascade Falls at the north end of the north arm of Rainy. The cabins are utilitarian-you can see the wiring, twoXfours, and a mix of appliances-some rusty on the outside, but they work The cabins have flush toilets, hot and cold running water, showers and each cabin has a propane grill next to it. Outstanding smallmouth bass, some northern and walleye and big crappie. This is a long boat ride in your personal boat and the water could be rough and there are rock hazards to your motor. When I went the camp operator arranged pickup in a good sized boat-large enough to hold 5 people, food and gear plus the boat driver and his friend. There is a charge for the boat trip in and a charge to park your vehicle at the government docks while at the camp. I think the ride was 30 to 45 minutes going wide open on a nice day. Cascade Camp does not have a web site but you can find its phone and address on the internet. In the Ear Falls area, my brother fished out of Camp Wenasaga. Lake Wenasaga is about 8 miles long, is fed by the Wenasaga River (falls) and empties into Lac Seul. Good Walleye Lake-don't know about size of fish. Morson, Ontario on LOTW has a number of nice resorts, some along the mail shoreline, others that you reach by boat."
534745,Gary_IA,2003-09-01 14:43:00,144,"I should add I have no financial or other interest in any resorts in Canada or elsewhere. I am adding further info on Cascade Camps from my old brochure: Winter contact: Jo Becker, 525 Sixth Street, Stillwater, MN (651)439-5430-Oct 31 -May 1; Summer: Cascade Camps, Ltd., Box 657, Fort Frances, Ontario, Canada P9A 3M9, phone (807-274-9030. Jo and the staff are pleasant and helpful. Jo helped land a smallmouth I caught off the dock in front of her cabin. Although an old and basic camp, the lawns are mown and the fishouse is clean and useable. There are 3 docks that are useable but are old and requires care when walking on them. The outboards were 15 hp and were a year or more old. I believe the boats were older 16 foot aluminum boats. The boats did not leak."
534774,Guest,2003-09-02 19:07:00,0,"We go to Golden Eagle Resort. Not the newest cabins but won't find any that are cleaner. 1 Mile outside of Ear Falls, they have good sound equipment, docks are great, people are extremely helpful. Give Scott a call toll-free # 1-866-384-0117. Best of all, you're on Lac Seul."

534944,Guest,2003-09-12 07:25:00,0,I second www.witchbay.com. My brother and I spent 5 days there in July and all I have to say is WOW.... what a place if you enjoy awesome fishing and Fantastic food!
534990,Guest,2003-09-15 13:13:00,0,"Lac Suel in the Sioux Lookout area. In 2002 it was Lac Suel and we caught several large fish, both Northern and Walleye. I am sure we also averaged about 100 fish per day. Many of the Northern were caught on top water baits which was a riot. This year we decided in Lake of the Woods and although good, it did not compare to our Lac Suel experience. Have fun"
535014,Guest,2003-09-16 14:54:00,0,"I agree 100% with Lac Seul. We have been going there for 15 years and have tried other places on yearly second trips. Lac Seul is the most consistent lake to catch Walleye on of all we have fished. Its not hard to have a day where you catch more Walleye than the Lord should allow and they will all be nice sized fish...once in a while a ten pound Pike will grab your jig or a 17"" Smallmouth."
535101,Guest,2003-09-21 07:16:00,0,The best way to find that trip of life time is go the Trip Finder page on Just Fish Ontario and fill out the short form. He will email it to all the lodges on his web site which I think is over 70. We found a great trip this year at a lodge we never heard of and would have not found. It was painless and we did not get bombarded.http://justfishontario.com/trip_finder.htm
534603,Guest,2003-08-24 19:17:00,0,I and five friends are looking for a lake in Ontario above the International Falls area to take in one boat and fish. Would like to rent a cabin at resort or a lake. Would need to rent 1 to 2 boats. Want to catch walleyes and northerns. Thank you for the info.
534633,BD,2003-08-26 00:24:00,739,There are many places you can go not far from the falls. The Atikokan area between the Falls and Thunder Bay has several good resorts. http://www.ontariofishinglodges.ca/r...ownid=Atikokan If you will consider driving a little farther I would recomend Press Lake Camp north of Ignace. It is the only camp (the only buildings) on a 9000 acre lake. If you decide on Press Lake get your reservations in now. They always fill up early. http://www.presslake.on.ca
534650,Guest,2003-08-26 16:28:00,0,www.witchbay.com Take a few moments to check out the entire website and especially the FISHING REPORT and GABBIN' WITH GAIL sections. Those will let you know what people really think of the place. Good luck wherever you end up. ~Lunk~
534651,Vitreum,2003-08-26 17:06:00,221,"i would recommend the ear falls area of lac seul. about 3 1/2 to 4 hours north of border. accomodations are moderately priced when compared to many other areas. fishing is nearly always great. i would also recommend waiting until july to go. you will be much more likely to have stable weather then. 2 foot walleye and 3 foot northerns are ""just nice"" fish in that area. real trophies are a possibility. water is stained, so you can fish walleye all day long. stay away from those clear water lakes if you want to catch lots of fish. many guys will catch 100+ walleye per 2-man boat per day."
534659,bronzeback77,2003-08-27 11:09:00,97,"White Pine Odge on Lake of the Woods, I have been going up for the past 5 years and plan on going back every year for the rest of my life. It is 1 1/2 hours north of INTL Falls. Walleye and Pike is outstanding. their website is www.whitepinelodge.ca or you can email me at [email protected]. I would be happy to give you more info."
534660,bronzeback77,2003-08-27 11:10:00,97,I meant White Pine Lodge
534713,Guest,2003-08-30 09:47:00,0,Wabaskang Lake is 200 miles north of I'Falls and is an excellent walleye and northern lake. It is at Perrault Falls.
534715,fishmaster,2003-08-30 15:24:00,209,"I would suggest trying www.vermilionbaylodge.com Located on Eagle Lake and has great fishing. Fishing is getting better each year been going there a few years now, you can't beat the hospitality."
534718,Scott Richardson,2003-08-30 20:56:00,268,Andersons Lodge on Lac Seul near Sioux Lookout. There is none better. Scott Richardson
534734,Guest,2003-09-01 06:25:00,0,Pakwash is a great lake for what you are looking for. Fairly large stained lake but very easy to find your way. Just type pakwash lake in about any search engine and you will find some great resorts. Pakwash is in the Ear Falls area(3 to 4 hours north of border)the lake is about 12 miles long and 4 miles at its widest point. Great fishing. Catch a bunch.
