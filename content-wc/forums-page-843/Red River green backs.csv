535128,Guest,2003-09-22 15:12:00,0,I will be fishing the Red in a couple of weeks and don't know what to bring can some experienced eye hunters help. What weight jig for the river any good colors to have along? What to use for bait. Good bait shops in Selkirck? Typical depths and general stratagies? Best streches of river? Thanks Walleyes
535134,Guest,2003-09-23 07:35:00,0,"What dates are you going and where are you staying? We will be on the Red Oct 5 thru 10 and are staying at The End Of Main. If we are there at the same time maybe we can share some info. This will be our 4th year and we use jigs 3/8 oz with salted minnows and will drag a crank bait once in a while. Chartreuse, white and orange seem to be colors that work. Our best luck is normally in 10 to 15 ft water. Watch where the boats are at and you can find some action. Mike"
535137,Todd_NE,2003-09-23 08:16:00,1330,"The Red is murky and can be a tic fast depending on where you anchor up to jig. I like what Mike said. 3/8 - 5/8 jigs Glow White (make sure you keep them glowing) Orange/Chart Lime/Chart Pink Pink/White Northland Whistlers and Walleye Flashers can be hot on the Red (the whistlers with the colored blades are real good) and I like the 5/8 Lindy Fuzz e Grubs with the ""keel"" head. I also usually use a small piece of power bait on the hook shank in a contrasting color. I've seen a lot of ways to hook salties, I go in the mouth and up through the skull. Personally, I always use a stinger and superline on the Red. I also usually like to jig like a heartbeat. Pause..... twitch Pause....... twitch Another good one is three hits on the bottom, then lift it and hold for 5 seconds, repeat. For some reason I never do as well there jigging very rapidly or in a straight cadence. I like the powerlines above the power house, the buoy line, the birdhouse/flag area, ramp side of sugar island, and the cable car area (I think that's what they are anyway). Sometimes early and late anchoring right on the break above the hole by the power house can be awfully good and is rarely fished. I hate to say it, but the community holes are pretty good and there for a reason if you look at your depthfinder you'll see why. Most have breaks, or ripples, island tips - classic stuff for fall walleyes. Make sure you bring a heavy anchor with some chain and a good rope. MORE anchor than you think you need so you can short rope. I like the boat to swing a little back and forth so I don't double anchor. make sure you have the fish & chips and some kokanee's at a place called Barney Gargles in Selkirk - pretty good stuff.

535141,Guest,2003-09-23 09:33:00,0,"What - what ever happened to a 10K generator and chain-link fence??? Oh Ya - thats how we Bass fished in Omaha!!! Just Kidding - but for folks that are new up here - like I am, you can always stop in to Cats on The Red and check with them for help. Even with the water being as low as it is - the South Side Ramp is still working out fine. ""Now where is that lighter??"""
535142,Todd_NE,2003-09-23 15:05:00,1330,"I forgot you asked about trolling. Bring 7-9 Shad raps and cd5 & 6 wally divers, Frenzy's, etc. Troll upstream slowly trying to nudge the bottom now and again. Hope you don't mind losing cranks. You will. I like jigging to start and if it dies switching to trolling mid-day then back to the jigs. It's really hard to troll I think because of the constantly changing bottom, though it can be fun when they're hot. It is truly the ""within 6"" of the bottom"" or you don't get bit river fishing I think. Bait shop is on the right side of main about halfway through selkirk. Another tip, buy various saltie brands, they can work better for some reason. Don't get unsalted and don't lick your fingers. I open them and buy the biggest ones I can find. A buddy likes to put on two or three on at a time, each his own. T Yup, got her... oh yeah... feel that head shake!"
535145,Guest,2003-09-23 19:41:00,0,"Todd The Man, When you are trolling what kind of line and what test do you use? What color of cranks do you perfer? What depth of water? Would you mind just getting in our boat and giving us a first hand lesson in ""Greenback Catching""? YOU ARE THE MAN."
535149,Guest,2003-09-24 06:42:00,0,"I'm certainly not the man on the Red or Winnipeg, that's for sure. Rob Carlson and some of the guys up there are the real help. I like white or firetiger on the Red. I have no idea on the depth this year, just try to follow the shelf edge to the main channel, the bottom is constantly changing but I seem to remember 10-14' mainly. Not sure this year. It's just like fishing anywhere, experiment and make good decisions. Watch what's going on around you and communicate on the bank with the other guys. And stick to shad raps, did I say that? Other stuff works but those are my favorite. I like fireline, but if it's shallow you might have to use 14# mono or 30# superline that is thick to get your lures out a little. It's always fun to meet people up there, some day maybe we'll fish together. T"
535151,Guest,2003-09-24 12:20:00,0,Thanks for all the helpful advice guys! Now if the big girls will just show up!
