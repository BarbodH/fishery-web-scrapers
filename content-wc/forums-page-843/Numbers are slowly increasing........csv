So far the fall run has been painfully slow to commence, but we're overlooking a very important element, water temperature! The water temperature must cool down before any mass migration will take place. That's the way it has always been and that's the way it we remain! If you stop and observe the foliage on the tree's, you will see that considering it's nearing the end of September and the foliage is barely showing signs of fall color. It simply hasn't been cold enough to date to trigger the tree's into turning........ Last weekend the water temperature on the Red was still sixty plus degree's. Now that we've had some cool frosty nights this past week, the water temperature is now about mid fifty and is continuing to decline. This is good news for those of us that are patiently waiting for the run to get underway. There has been a few trophies caught over the past few days and it's my opinion that we'll begin to hear more positive reports coming in the days ahead. Let's hope the cooling trends continue and that the run continue's to improve. Fish ""HARD"" Forever!"
