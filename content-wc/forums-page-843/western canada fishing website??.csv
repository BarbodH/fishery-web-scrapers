535107,Pikeman,2003-09-21 16:16:00,93,"Hey guys, I'm hoping tonight is the night for the site to be back up, i'm calling my server guy and we're hoping to get it all fixed around 8 tonight. The main page has a completely new look as well, and we will be doing live results from the vanity cup again this year. I really appreciate everyone being more than patience as this has grown into a much longer delay then i had expected. For the guy who is heading to Tobin, when are you going? Thanks everyone, Travis"
