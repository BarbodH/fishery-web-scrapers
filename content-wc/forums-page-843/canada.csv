Just got back from LOTW. spent a week at white pines lodge, south of sioux narrows. the weather was great for fishing- very cool and rainy almost everyday. caught a lot of northerns but still had to go to yellow girl for the walleyes. That was about 20 miles each way. Been at work for a couple of days and i am ready to go north again. Nothing is better than a week in canada or mabe 2 or 3 or 4 you get the idea. The bass were just not biting for us. I would like to see canada change their ""in posession"" limits for walleyes back to what it was. The DNR warden explained that it was because of Minnesotas govenor Jesse Ventura that the limits got changed."
