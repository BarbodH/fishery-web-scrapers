535106,Hawgeye,2003-09-21 15:05:00,1355,"Ragardless of whether the fishing is good or not or whether the access is good or not, I agree with 'Stayhome', STAY HOME! Okay, that statement is a little selfish since I like having the fishing space to myself. I have a local contact and have heard a little different report than 'stayhome's' assessment. Sounds like with the increased shiners, things will be just fine this year...doesn't matter either way...I'll be there. Last year when I had heard the fishing was terrible, we hammered them. No trophies but I have caught plenty of them. There were enough fish too big to keep the ""walleye twitch"" working. SEE YA IN 10 days!"
535001,Hawgeye,2003-09-15 21:25:00,1355,"I have been in touch with a few locals who claim there are some issues with the local paper mill access. Apparently their was a person was injured there and the mill shut down the access for awhile. I understand it has since been opened but only on a temporary basis. Another concern discussed is that the water is extremely low and the access to the river is very difficult. Can anyone elaborate, confirm or deny these comments? I am concerned since I will be there in 2 1/2 weeks with my 73 year old father and my brother. Have any walleyes been caught yet? Thanks and can't wait to go get them!! Your old friend Hawgeye..."
535025,Guest,2003-09-17 08:12:00,0,"Was up at pine falls a couple weeks ago, and yes the launch was closed for awhile for repairs. It reopened on the tuesday following the labour day weekend. The water levels are low but very easy access to the river and to traverse bay. Took my usual route down river and lowest water i saw was 6ft where there is normally about 10ft. The south winds at the time may have played with the water levels a little but i'd doubt that a north wind wouls bring them up significantly as the water is low everywhere. when i was up there, there were approx 10 boats out, just bass and stuff being caught, no greens. The water is still too warm. Hopefully we'll start to get some cooler night to cool off the waters to get the hogs moving. Fish On! Roger"
535033,Guest,2003-09-17 10:38:00,0,"What is the status on the shiners in the river system? I would assume that if the shiners are in the system in the numbers I've heard that the greenbacks will soon follow. Isn't the water temperature the reason the shiners start to move in the river system, and if the shiners come into the river won't the greenbacks follow no matter what the water temperature is? Isn't the greeenbacks only concern feeding and breeding, the latter coming in the spring? Here's hoping the shiner and greenback run will be large in numbers and that access to the system will be available. :)"
535038,fishcop,2003-09-17 19:02:00,11,"Yes the shiners are in the river in abundance! Pineview shiners is grinning ear to ear, compared to years previous. As for the temp, it is still warm, but with the forecast, it should be dropping quick. This year saw alot of high water temps, so it may take longer for things to start. as for the launch, it is fixed and ready to go!"
535042,mrwalleye5,2003-09-18 06:25:00,1922,What did they do to fix up the launch? Last year I thought it was pretty good except a heated cement pad to keep the ice off would be nice lol.
535049,Guest,2003-09-18 17:43:00,0,my advice is stay home or go some where else..no fish and low water..and im not kidding have not heard of a fish been caugt over 3 lbs and not many of the the tournaments will be a joke..you know there are no fish cause the nets are not even out..last week we fished for 2 days and 2 sauger...access is ok but i hit bottom coming out....worst fishing ive ever seen...

535051,Guest,2003-09-18 18:07:00,0,"Where were you fishing and what were you doing.... I'm not going to get into the debate of fish no fish this year because its way to early to tell. As far as the net go there are nets out and I'll tell you where and what they are catching.. No i am not a comercial fisherman but I talk to alot of people who are. If you had your motor trimmed all the way down when you were taking your boat out at the launch yep your going to give it a rub. I have been to that boat launch 3 times this year and have not had a problem. ""no its not a twelve footer with a 15 on the back"""
