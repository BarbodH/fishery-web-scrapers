567238,Jigger1,2007-07-09 21:32:00,234,"IA Walleye - I think I'll get a chance to meet you next year. I'll be up there June 22 with my youngest for four days and then up with the guys for five the following week as usual. Nine days on Lac Seul, what a dream! 2008 will be year nine at SWWL and for some reason it always feels like the first. Tlars - So how's late September fishing on Lac Seul other than a little colder than us June/July crowd?"
567304,Northpoint,2007-07-11 15:07:00,38,"Denis, Was the giant killer a red spinner or red hair? My wife and I get to go back the end of July after having spent a week there in June and greatly enjoy SWW. I would agree with others that the service is top notch, the meals are fantastic and the fishing for walleyes has been way beyond what I ever imagined possible. Thanks for any info. Bob"
567315,Guest,2007-07-11 18:22:00,0,"Bob, I was using a silver blade giant killer with red hair. I really dont think it matters that much though. I left my musky box at the resort that day, full of bucktails. I wasn't planning on northern fishing that day. All I had with me was my small spoon box with a couple ratty old bucktails in it. The other reports I was hearing were very good from the resort. Just find some cabbage next to deep water and have fun. I did notice there wasn't many fish further back in the bay even though there was cabbage there. They seemed to like the weed lines next to deep water. Have a good trip! Denis"
568160,Northpoint,2007-08-07 15:34:00,38,My wife and I fished out of SWW the last week of July and had a wonderful time. The first two days it was sunny and calm with highs in the 90's. I was very impressed by our guide who tried some new spots with us and put me onto two 28's in dead flat and very hot conditions. We also caught one just shy of 27 and several 25's. One day we had to really work hard to get four fish small enough for shore lunch. The next two days the wind blew hard enough to make boat control a challenge but the guide managed to do it all and still keep us on the fish. Substantially all of the fish were caught on jigs and minnows and I am not cetain of the most productive depth. Good luck to all.

567100,Guest,2007-07-07 17:36:00,0,"Just got home on friday night, fished for 6 days out of SWWL. Lac Suel is an amazing lake, I would say the walleyes averaged right around 22""-23"". Big fish for the trip was 30.5"", my wife always gets the big fish! I had two that went 28"", one 27.75"" and 5 26.5"" and 5 26"" eyes. I thought leeches and crawlers were the best. Did good on gulp crawlers and gulp minnows also. Minnows seemed to work well in the am until around noon, then they seemed to get a little picky.Did well on lindy rigs with 6'-10' snells and a bead. In some areas where the fish were scattered we pulled spinners with 6' snells pretty fast at 1 mph. to 1.6mph. Had to hold on to the rod tight, they were wacking the spinner pretty good. Fished for smallmouth for 4 hrs. one day, that was a blast. Lots of doubles and I couldnt believe the average size of the bass, I would say right around 16"" with some up to 18.5"". Caught mostly on topwater, a white jig and white twister worked well also. Just cast and reel strait in, medium speed retrieve. Fished for jacks for 2 - 3 hrs the last morning of our trip. We ended up with one 38"" and two 37"" all on a red mepps giant killer. We caught around 20 walleyes while fishing for jacks. I coudnt believe it, they were slamming the big buck tails and spoons. Only bad thing about the trip was having to come home! Denis"
567134,Jigger1,2007-07-08 19:39:00,234,"Denis - Our stays overlap by a day or two every year. I'll make sure to say hello next year as we again booked the same days. This year we left early Monday and I was wondering if you caught the bigger fish later in the week. We again didn't get a monster but our group did catch & release 32 over 25"" including 4 - 27's. The number of thick healthy fish in 22-24 range was unreal. Our first day was spectacular and then things got tough by Lac Seul standards as we had little wind and every day gave us a different direction so no pattern could really develop. We caught fish all over the place from 8 to 35 feet of water but almost every large fish came from over 20 feet. Like IA Walleye posted from his stay it seemed like we would hit pods of fish and then slow until we found another. Most came off of jig and minnow and we had some success with bouncers. Great trip as always to SWWL, came back about as relaxed as a person could and it took a day or two to get back into the swing of things. Hats off to Mike and his crew once again. By the way every year you two seem to catch a monster or two or three. You both fish pretty good, look forward to seeing you next year!"

567145,Guest,2007-07-09 06:14:00,0,"We caught the 30.5"" on wed out of 31 fow using a spinner with a 6' snell and a crawler. It was pretty hard for us to put together any kind of good patern for big fish. I tryed trolling cranks over 30-50 fow fiahing anywere from 12' to 30' down. But the fish we caught doing that were no bigger. I'll try againg next year. I agree Mike sure does a great job at SWWl, I've never seen a resort owner so concerned about getting big fish. Any other resort I've been to normally has 2"" minnows for sale. Mike gets minnows up to 6"" long and are included in the package. I really think the big bait makes a difference. Cant wait for next year. Denis."
