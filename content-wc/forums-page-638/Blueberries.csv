568165,Guest,2007-08-07 19:54:00,0,Did anyone buy an ice cream bucket of blueberries this year? What's the going price?
568167,Guest,2007-08-07 20:08:00,0,"In Rainy River I believe they were going for 30 a bucket (which is a gallon or so, right?). We actually picked 7 gallons and froze them for pancakes, muffins, and pies later on!"
568195,Trailerguy,2007-08-08 16:22:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]They are also $30 a gallon at Dutchies in Perrault Falls, plus they put your name on a waiting list. No one appears to be real ambisous about picking them. The wife and I picked 11 gallons last weekend and froze them for future use. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"

568198,Guest,2007-08-08 18:35:00,0,LOTW's area had absolutely ZERO rain in July... the early batch of blueberries were quite big... They were thick by the 6th or 7th of July... but lack of rain kept them from getting bigger.
568204,Guest,2007-08-08 19:30:00,0,Will there still be berries in early September?
568210,Guest,2007-08-09 04:52:00,0,"I've never seen them out that late... infact, they're starting to disappear now."
