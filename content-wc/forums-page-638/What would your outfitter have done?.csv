568126,Guest,2007-08-06 15:17:00,0,We just got back from our 2nd trip up North to Northern Ontario. The cost for the beer and to get it to us was 46.00/case from that outfitter.So it has went up some since this spring.
568131,Guest,2007-08-06 16:41:00,0,"getting hosed?? dont think so. Go to the beer store in Ontario. 40.00 per case of blue in the cans, you can go online and check the prices yourself and verify the price. That means 6.00 a case extra to have it flown in ahead of time before the trip so it wouldnt be counted against the weight. I believe there are alot of other fly in outfitters who charge about the same price or more. gettimg hosed, hardley. who's your outfitter??"
568135,v-bay gord,2007-08-06 20:52:00,3168,I would think that a fly in outfitter has more pressing issues on his plate than worrying about every groups beer consumption and preferences. Perhaps what you thought you told him and what he heard was two different stories. Its only beer for chr#st's sake!!! Bring your own beer next time and quit *****ing and whining. Do you want him to open them for you too?
568137,5thsuit,2007-08-06 21:53:00,54,"Bush put your crack pipe down! The outfitter told him $42 a case plus $1 a pound over, near as I can figure $62 a case would be on the high end. He was charged $72 a case! If your outfitter cant treat you honestly, NEVER GO BACK! He was hosed! And for the record I have never paid more then $42 a case flown in in advance! And that is alot of beer each year!!"
568141,Guest,2007-08-07 05:34:00,0,"Your last post came under the 46.00 a case that was getting hosed and I was simpily referring to that 5thsuit as your last comment came in below. I agree, outfitters word means everything. If he was told something and told diffently when they arrive, I wouldnt go back either. Theres plenty of good fishing out there, why go back? For the record, I can do math too. Its not that hard. Bush put your crack pipe down! The outfitter told him $42 a case plus $1 a pound over, near as I can figure $62 a case would be on the high end. He was charged $72 a case! If your outfitter cant treat you honestly, NEVER GO BACK! He was hosed! And for the record I have never paid more then $42 a case flown in in advance! And that is alot of beer each year!!"
568142,Guest,2007-08-07 06:39:00,0,V-bay gord thanks for your anonymous advice. Your right he shouldn't have to open my beer but having it iced down would be nice. I'll try to do better. Phil
568067,Guest,2007-08-03 23:53:00,0,I don't get it. You would pay $3.00 a beer in a bar in the US ($72.00 per case) but wouldn't expect to pay that at a fly in where it cost them $20.00 per case just to fly it in? shouldn't they make a small profit to stay stay in business or am i missing something here?

GOOD POINT
568070,phishfearme,2007-08-04 05:49:00,1242,"i think the last two posts have totally missed the point - what was promised and what was delivered were two different things. i doubt phil would've even made his post if what he and the outfitter agreed to had occured. to me, honesty and integrity in an outfitter are expected traits. there's just too many great outfitters around to mess with someone who would do this. phish"
568072,5thsuit,2007-08-04 08:19:00,54,"What difference does it make where the beer came from?? He had to fly it in from somewhere which cost him money. If he wants to stay in business I would hope he stockpiles a little beer. Its a pretty good bet someone at one of your outposts will want BEER, and driving to the store for each separate order makes no sense! On the $300 extra cost? Was that for the beer or for being over your weight limit on everything?"
568073,AllenW,2007-08-04 08:53:00,11482,"Sounds like Phil picked one way to buy beer and the outfitter did it the other. Seems worst case is I'd call this theft, doesn't sound like the price of the beer was the main issue, but the fact they wanted to go one route buying the beer and the outfitter went the other. Ending up with appears to be more profit for the outfitter. Best case is a outfitter that didn't care what Phil wanted and did what he pleased. Either way, it'd be the last time I went there or had a good thing to say about the outfitter. Leastwises from what Phil says anyway. Al"
568114,Guest,2007-08-06 10:51:00,0,"When I got to the camp and spoke to the owner, he remembered our talk at the sportshow. As I told him, he could charge 10.00 a can for beer at his lodge. I don't care. What we had agreed to was that he would supply beer from Winnepeg and we would pay the extra shiping cost. For 10 cases of beer from Winnepeg the cost and shiping was 420.00. When we got the bill it was 720.00. He would not refund the extra cost but would give us a 300.00 credit for the next year trip. Thanks but no thanks. phil"
568117,Guest,2007-08-06 11:36:00,0,$42.00 x 10 cases = $420.00 $1/lb x 200 lbs (20lbs a case) = $200.00 Total bill should have been $620.00 Seems like he only got you for $100.00
568120,5thsuit,2007-08-06 12:09:00,54,You guys got hosed! Who was the Outfitter?
568123,Guest,2007-08-06 13:47:00,0,Math man the beer cost 24.00/case. Weight of 1 case 18lb. 18 + 24=42X 10=420.00
568124,Guest,2007-08-06 14:39:00,0,$24.00 a case? Are you sure there is acohol in the beer? The beer store charges charges $35.45 a case for Bush Beer and $40.00 for Blue. I don't know of an outfitter that would only charge $24/case. Is it cheaper in Manatoba than Ontario? I don't think we paid less that $45.00 a case the last 4 years and we always have them deliver it for us. This year we are going to be paying $70/case. That's the price you pay for having it delivered by Ice Truckers!
567955,phishfearme,2007-07-31 16:37:00,1242,the outfitter that we used this year has a rate for 4-6 people and a higher rate for three or less for his fly-in housekeeping cabins. one of our group of 4 had to cancel due to a medical condition and we went with three guys. we also had paid a $100 per person deposit. how would/should the outfitter handle this with respect to the trip cost and the deposit status? i'll let you all know what happened in my situation. phish
567993,phishfearme,2007-08-01 14:13:00,1242,"with 26 votes in, i think the answer is clear that the vast majority of outfitters would (should?) charge the 3 person rate. i know one that would charge the TOTAL fee for 4 then the remaining 3 would have to split it - i stopped using them for that very reason. anyway - our group was treated extreemly well and was only charged the 4 person rate times 3 AND we were able to carry over the one deposit for a 2008 trip (but only 2008). couldn't ask more of an outfitter than that! thanks for the feedback. phish"
567996,Guest,2007-08-01 14:50:00,0,"They treated you well, I asume you booked with them for 2008?"
567998,phishfearme,2007-08-01 15:45:00,1242,not yet but probably will - i just hope though that our group size doesn't deteriotate even further. phish
568000,Guest,2007-08-01 16:14:00,0,Did you catch any fish worth telling about?

568052,Guest,2007-08-03 12:40:00,0,"Our group made resrvations for a fly-in last Jan.. The outfitter would buy our foodstuffs for us. At that time it cost a 1.00/lb overweight. He could buy beer in Winnapeg for us and charge us 42.00/case flown in with us and our foodstuffs.. The other option was to buy beer from his lodge at 72.00/case. We told him to get beer in Winnapeg. We would pay the 1.00/lb shipping cost.After getting to the plane to fly in 6 months later our bill which had to be paid before we can flyin is 300.00 over what we expected. Closer look at bill shows that they supplied beer from the main lodge. Now the ownner is up at the main lodge,they wont't let us get on plane till billis paid.We can't wait to long or plane will leave to the lodge.What would you have done??"
568055,Guest,2007-08-03 13:16:00,0,"Been upset or mad. Paid the bill, forgotten about it because nothing you can do, went fishing, caught fish, had a great time with friends, drank beer, played cards, told lies and then maybe not book with them next year."
568056,Guest,2007-08-03 13:36:00,0,That's exactly what we did. We did not rebook!
568057,phishfearme,2007-08-03 14:00:00,1242,and i hope you provided appropriate feedback on this board. i think you did the right thing in just pay the bill and go fishing but i hope you made it clear to him that there'll be nothing but negative feedback on the fishing boards. phish
