568151,Guest,2007-08-07 13:39:00,0,"Just a heads up for anyone fishing the Minaki area and need a little help. I just spent the last 12 days there on vacation... fished every day (and night almost) and had a blast. The current has picked up and therefore the river walleye bite has as well. River is down 6"" at least from last week, lots of exposed ""slime"" on shore. Many of the usual ""walleye spots"" south of Minaki are really good. Was trolling Reef Runners through the Little Dalles and hammering fish like crazy... Walleye, Pike, Smallmouth. Walleyes up to 25"" caught there. Early morning was best in Little Sand, we had an 80 Walleye morning (from 6am to 10am) on August 1st. Rocky shorelines and points were best. Smallmouth are hanging with walleyes now, so expect to catch a lot of those. Lindy rigging with leeches definitely worked best. Also tried minnows and crawlers... leeches out fished those 4 to 1. Most fish were running 18 to 23 feet, which surprised me cause the surface temp was around 78 degrees. Usually I would try fishing at 30 - 35 feet when the water is this warm. The evening Trolling bite in Big Sand is getting hot. All week was awesome. Many 22 to 25"", 27"" and even a 29"" and a 30"" near the beach. Perch Color Taildancer was the hot ticket. It seemed the windy evenings had the better bite. This however was not working during the day... suspended fish were a lot deeper and when I clip weighted my cranks to what I figure was around 45 feet... I was catching Pike. Big Pike too! 39 incher was the biggest. Fun Stuff. Also, the 30 incher we caught suspended near the beach had a fairly fresh and quite large bite mark on it side. You could see a defined half-oval which was swollan... I'd like to catch whatever thought that was lunch! Rough Rock Lake was crap... lol ... or maybe I don't know how to fish it. But I was there for the better part of a day and caught a bunch of saugers and perch. Water was very green, lots of algae. Musky Bite was slow... Raised a bunch of fish in the 39 to 43 inch range, had them follow my lure to the boat, smile at me and swim away. I had one at the Brushpile open its mouth on a figure-eight but didn't commit. All fish seen were on the rocks now and moving very slow. Warm weather must be kicking the tar outta them like it did to me. My 10"" suick raised the most fish. No action at all on topwater or bucktails. On another note, has anyone ever heard of or seen a Lake Trout being caught in the Minaki part of the Winnipeg River. Some old dude I was talking to told me that his grandfather used to troll right down the middle of Big Sand and catch them in the spring. That water would suit them as it is very deep (215 feet at the deepest) and big. When I troll for suspened Walleyes, I see tons (and I mean TONS) of fish at the thermocline and below.. is that all whitefish? Whatever those fish are, there are trillions. Hope this helps out some making there way up there in the next few days. Bring bug spray... black flies are the worst I have ever seen."
568153,phishfearme,2007-08-07 14:05:00,1242,"good report - concerning you ""seeing"" tons of fish at the thermocline - unless you were SCUBA diving i assume you see them on your sounder - the thermocline itself frequently shows up as fish on most all sounders. the software just can't discern the difference between fish and the rapid water density change associated with the thermocline. by the way, how deep was the thermocline? i found it at about 12-15 feet while at way north lodge - saw tons of fish there like you did, donned my snorkel gear and dove down to see nothing - except an immediate headache when my head hit the extreemly cold water. phish"
568154,Guest,2007-08-07 14:09:00,0,"Yes, I saw them on my Lowrance sounder. It was showing at 45 feet now... surface temp is really warm at 78 degrees. There is also alot of fish under that depth too. All the way down to 200 feet."
568163,Guest,2007-08-07 16:55:00,0,Thanks for the good info. We leave the 31st for Paradise Park. From both your posting and the previous Minaki postings it sounds like we may do real good this year. We might even luck out with the gas prices going down too. Any problems at border? What time did you cross. Randy in Chicago
568173,Guest,2007-08-08 08:14:00,0,J.P. I can't remember what year it was (around 97-98) but It was the first of May and there was still Ice on northern part of Big Sand and I caught an 18 inch lake trout just north of Sugarloaf Island. That's the only one I've ever caught in 30 years of fishing up there on that lake. I really wasn't that suprised given that Vermillion Lake drains right into it and it has a ton of lake trout in it.
568177,Guest,2007-08-08 09:49:00,0,Vermillion wasn't nearly as good as previous years. It was like it was over run with pike. For years I never knew it had pike and this year pike to lake trout were 4 to 1. J.P did you fish pistol at all ???

I really wasn't that >suprised given that Vermillion Lake drains right into it and >it has a ton of lake trout in it. That's really cool. Lake Trout are my favorite fish to catch. I used to think that there was really only Walleye/Sauger, Northern Pike, Musky, Smallmouth Bass, Whitefish, Burbot, Perch, Rockbass, etc in this system. But in the last few years, now that I really fish hard, I have seen/caught Sturgeon, Crappie, Largemouth Bass... and only heard of Lake Trout. Now that Sturgeon I saw... I still don't believe it. In the 2003 Minaki Walleye Classic, we were fishing near a place I call Funk's Boathouse. That is just the the north of ""High Cliff"", and to the eat of the Brushpile. My Brother and I in my boat, and my Parents fishing near us in their boat. My mother hooked on to something she thought was a big log... it was slowly coming up when she pulled. Then is started moving around slowly... so now she thinks she has the biggest Walleye of her life. She kept playing with this thing, then after a few minutes we saw large bubbles come to the surface... so I'm thinking that's gotta be a Lake Trout. Well after a few more minutes and my Dad thinking if he brought the boat shallow, they might have a better chance of landing whatever it was. Well once he did that, the fish swam sharply to the surface and did one of those jump and head shakes. My Mom screamed, and everyone else crapped themselves. It was a HUGE Sturgeon... I never would have thought a Lake Sturgeon could get this big. I know that no one really believes that story, but there were 4 witnesses and I saw it myself so... I would probably guess that it was close to 7 feet long with a girth of at least 32-35 inches. It was really thick... had a gray/yellow color to it. I like that story, lol."
568180,Guest,2007-08-08 10:56:00,0,"I always wanted to fish Vermillion Lake. It's a tough one to do though as I dont think there is a road that goes there and you need to drag or portage a boat into there. Any big lakers in that lake? It's funny. We have a family cabin on Pistol, and I never fish it. I go everywhere else. I have seen some nice fish caught. Last year a group staying at Paradise Cove caught a 33"" walleye off the rock with the red buoy at Pistol Lake narrows. But it seems that good fish days are few and far between in Pistol. Have you ever had good Walleye days in Pistol where there was good action and good size to them?"
568187,Guest,2007-08-08 13:25:00,0,"Brian.....yep, there are some monster pike in Vermillion."
568189,Guest,2007-08-08 13:35:00,0,"I saw a very large Sturgeon just off of our boatdock up on Harbour Island a few years ago.....it came right up the surface for probably 30 seconds or so. I also found a dead one floating in the River to Rough Rock....it was a good 40 inches or so. There are goldeneyes in that system. When I was a kid (25 years ago or so) I went out with the guy who had the whitefish netting rights on that system and he was netting several of them (not to mention all of the huge walley, musky and pike.....as I remember it)."
568194,Guest,2007-08-08 16:14:00,0,We use to portage into Vermillion out of Ena years ago (90's). Two of us would troll Blue/silver rapalas and two of us would sit on a rock point and throw out sucker meat on a treble sitting on the bottom while sipping a beverage of choice and enjoying the Canadien air. We always got nice lake trout and some nice pike too. Use to be some boats stashed we rented on the south end of the lake. This was 3rd of 4th week of MAY. That lake was always COLD. JJ
568208,IaCraig,2007-08-08 20:57:00,434,"Thanks for the report JP. I had always been told that there were no lake trout in that part of the system, but I figured they were ther but just not in fishable numbers. I picked a bad year to skip my Canada trip, but I am very happy for everyone that it is producing so well this year, especially the resort owners. (I thought it was great last year too). IaCraig"
568181,Guest,2007-08-08 11:21:00,0,"In vermillion a limit of 3 - 5 pounders are the normal. We've had a few 8 pounders and 1 close to 10. Also my personal best pike came out of there at 48"" It's a real easy trout lake to fish. Pick a shore in spring and start trolling. As the water warms in june we fish the main part of the lake along the north shore. If your looking for big lakers we fish clearwater bay. Except now you need a tag to keep. last week I had a 29"" walleye in Pistol along the point in front of the beach on the east side of the lake . Over the years I'm trying to fish pistol more and more. It's amazing how many eye's there are in that lake and with next to nobody fishing them at all. On the topic of sturgeon in the fall I've seen them roll on the surface in the rough rock narrows. Also on the topic of other fish in the area does anybody know how and where to fish for whitefish, and does the wpg river there have goldeye's. I had heard that you can catch goldeye's by the kenora by-pass but I've never tried."
568183,Guest,2007-08-08 11:32:00,0,"I should also note that this year in pistol I've had a hard time getting fish in the slot size. Lots of 18"" - 20"" fish with a few bigger mixed in. The eye's in pistol seem to move around all summer long. Where they are 1 day the next 200 yards down the shore and so on. I would like to try billings bay but it really doesn't look like walleye waters."
