568003,campownerchick,2007-08-01 17:57:00,13,"As a campowner I would like to know what is important to you and how you make the decision on where to spend your vacation time. Is it price, a glowing referral by a friend, distance from home, fishing, equipment, accommodations or all of the above? Would you make a snap decision at a sport show and sign up on the spot? Would you go back to an operator if the cabin and equipment were so/so but the lake was great? Thank you for your replies."
568005,Guest,2007-08-01 18:46:00,0,If they have girls available to fly in for ya or bring into camp about mid-week!!! Ha. JK!!!!
568006,PIKEMAN1,2007-08-01 19:00:00,14,"The best fly in trips we ever had ,by far,had the worst cabin and boats I have ever seen.The lake was just wonderful.The fishing was not a lot of numbers,but the size was very good. After a day or two getting things fixed up and getting settled in this place was the most pleasant camp I have ever stayed at. We went there four times in a row.As I set here at the computer there is a replica mount of a very nice pike caught at this lake just above my head.I would still be going there if it was still available.What I guess I'm saying is no amount of fine cabin and equipment can make a great trip if the fishing is poor,but great fishing and good friends can make a wonderful trip even if you have to rough it a bit. ""Good Fishing'"
568008,phishfearme,2007-08-01 19:08:00,1242,"number 1 = we go there for the catching AND the fishing. i NEVER ask the owner about the fishing. whatta YOU think they all say. this board is the best source by far for the real story. number 2 = the lake - it's our preference to ""rent a private lake"" hopefully with a portage lake or two but this is our preference some others want a lodge or whatever. (never tell someone that you're the only outfitter on the lake when there's a half dozen private cabins on the lake.) number 3 = the facilities - cabin (solar lights, water pump, well functioning fridge, bed layout, etc.) boats, motors, etc. none of us want any problems here - again this site is the best source of info here not the outfitter. number 4 = the price - just be competitive. we all know these trips aren't cheap - just don't nickle and dime us to death. number 5 = the outfitter himself and his history of service, here again, this board is the place for this info. hope this helps. i think you're the first outfitter to make such a request. you may want to state what you provide (lodge, american plan, housekeeping, drive-in, fly-in, etc.) best of luck to you. phish"
568011,Guest,2007-08-01 19:34:00,0,"I would have to second the last post from the phish- we come to fish first- next would be the equipmnet and faciclities- i dont want to be a maintenace or repair man all week - have good equiment and comfortable lodging the rest i agree with completeley- treat us fair- our group had a great trip years ago but the outfitter had seveal surprize charges, starting with extra charge to fly you from his manditory checkin station- we have never even thought of going back and have now been with the another outfitter about 12 years . and all things being equal the outfitter and his staff will tip the scales his way also hopes this helps and thanks for asking wg"
568012,Oldschool,2007-08-01 19:40:00,163,"Some things that are important to our group: Good fishing. Simply means that an average angler can expect to find and catch some fish. A minimum amount would be enough to have a major meal of fish each day. Hassle free time there. All of the equipment should work as expected. New is not needed, only good functionality. Owners that are attentive to the needs of the fisherpeople. Owners that are true to their word. Having facts presented up front to avoid surprises. If the flights in and out are as scheduled and all other logistics are handled well, the stress of traveling and placing oneself into others' hands is minimized. Sociability with ethical behavior of the owners. Treating the guests with respect, but expecting such treatment in return is important. The cost is expected to be higher than drive-ins, of course, and they should be in line with other camps offering similar services. No increases in service fees should be realized upon arrival. Examples: gas price increases this year have been reported by some with accompanying fees to the angler. This is not necessary and is unethical. Communications are so easy now that this should have been done well in advance of arrival. Hope this helps."
568013,lassh,2007-08-01 20:45:00,553,"I'm going to have to disagree with Oldschool on my definition of ""good fishing."" I agree with everything else he says, but you asked for opinions.In my opinion, a trip where you only catch enough fish for a major meal each day is not good fishing by fly-in standards. Unless there were some really bad conditions to account for the slow fishing, I would not return to that lake. I agree pretty much with Phish's list. What I look for in a fly-in lake is good action with a number of good sized fish. Most fly-in lakes are not trophy walleye lakes, but we look for a lake with good numbers of 21 to 24 inch walleyes and multiple fish in the 25"" to 28"" range. Also its nice to know that it is possible to catch a 30, but not expected on every trip. For northern, numbers of 33"" to 37"" are nice with a real chance at a 40. If fishing for smallies I look for a lake with lots of fish in 15"" to 17"" range and would like to catch a few 18 and above. Please don't get me wrong. I'm not one to pout and complain if the fishing is slow. I don't let that ruin my trip. Once you are on the lake that you've chosen, the camradere, the vastness, the beauty of scenery, the sounds, the raw nature and the solitude are the drivers for the wonder of the Canadian fly-in experience."
568019,RANGER,2007-08-01 23:14:00,4341,"BINGO!!! I could not have said it better!!!!!! NUMBER ""1"" AND FOREMOST - Integrity!! Don't blow smoke up my butt!! If you can't muster it - then forget it!! NEXT - is the attitude of the staff! We are spending good money to be there, the least you can do is make us feel welcome (not, necessarily, privileged)! Attitude goes a long way!! This includes those of us coming there. ""What goes around - comes around""!! I/we can deal with lesser cabin facilities (but not junk) if everything there WORKS. All I/we need is a place to sleep comfortably and eat without mosqitoes (screens) and to be able to get cleaned up. We want facilities that are void of wetness. This includes the cabin itself and a porch that is also dry and out of the weather (roof) for those days that we have nothing to do because of the weather. Boats and fishing/catching are at the top of the list! If I'm always involved in trying to start/fix engines/boats/etc. - it RUINS the trip and I get JACKED! If there is nothing in the water to catch, it leaves us lacking! Not catching all the time, BUT, not ""skunked"" either = multispecies water!! These are not unreasonable requests, IMHO! Considering the cost!"
568020,thunderatwork,2007-08-02 06:26:00,79,"for us-my group, fairly remote and good fishing. location of lake is not important,however the base we fly out of is. we like to drive up in one day with just two drivers as our kids are to young to drive. we like the food package our outfitter has setup as part of the package. boats must work,hot water is nice. If we wanted to fish in a crowd we would stay 400 miles south in wis or minn. Due to time constraints we have to go prtty much in the mid-late summer(next week) fishing can be real slow then so our choice of lakes include running water with deep holes to fish near. I went once in this time frame to a lake with out much deep or running water and it was a real chore to find fish in the first part of aug. costs need to be close to what others charge."
568085,Guest,2007-08-04 20:36:00,0,"After 30+ trips in 25 years, I imagine I have sampled just about eveything. I enjoy a nice cabin with a comfortable bed but in NWT have learned to sleep on a board in a tent. Good cooking is a must when on the American plan or I can choke down my cooking on a housekeeping plan. When renting eqiupment we expect motors to work properly with no break downs. On a fly in once I had a motor that broke down every day. After day 3 they changed the motor and gave me a motor that broke down on day 4. Now I prefer to bring my own boat and equipment if possible. I have fished many small secluded lakes on fly-ins but after a few days I tend to get the feeling that I am fishing in fish bowl. I prefer bigger water, LOTW, Lac Suel, Eagle etc. where I can boat in to a cabin and always have a true chance at a trophy. To me, after 25 years, quality is more important than quantity. IMHO I believe most all outfitters try their best to keep you satisfied and I can say I've only been screwed twice and not by the same outfitter. Since then one of them burned down and the other has fired his deceptive sales people. As far as booking at a sports show, I can not because I never know more than a month ahead as to when I can take my vacation. I use the sport shows to update my "" hit list"" and dream list ( the places I can not afford to go ). I realize that every fisherman likes different things but I believe that everyone would like to feel that they recieved a fair deal. Best Fishes ! ggg2"
568091,Guest,2007-08-05 08:27:00,0,"I think Phish is right. One reason I go back to the same outfitter is that they treat me like a friend, and that they want me to be there as a customer also. They never tell me what maybe I would like to hear but what is fact. My outfitter is the type of guys you would want to fish with all week,people trying to make a living like me."
568023,ONE TIME DAVE,2007-08-02 08:38:00,110,"""HONESTY"" on the part of the outfitter. Be honest and up front about what you provide. If you mislead our group once we will not be back. Have used the same outfitter 12 times. GOOD fishing. No suprises about $$$, facilities, equipment, etc.:cheers:"
