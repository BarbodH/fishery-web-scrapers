568207,Guest,2007-08-08 20:30:00,0,I am considering purchasing one of these in the next few days......anyone have any experience with this unit? Need some feed-back.

To get the most out the unit I think the map chips are critical. I'm pretty pleased with the unit. I mounted on a Ram mount and no matter what the light conditions I can see the display and easily read it no matter where I am in the boat. The lakemaster chip is great for the lakes I fish the most so far in WI. I used the navionics Canada chip on Lac Seul in July. The water was very high at the time we were there but I do believe that chip and the ability to track over the same path going to and from different spots and an idea where it might be shallow saved me from dinging my prop or skeg for the first time. I'm sure the high water helped but it was really nice being able to know what to expect in terms of depths. On the negative side the Navionics chips accuracy was off at least 20 feet in a few places so it isn't perfect. I think we covered a lot more of the water because we felt better about our ability to understand where the shoals were with regard to us and we could easily find our way home in low light conditions. If you have specific questions drop me an email or message and I'll see if I can help. Chris"

Did you find most harazds are marked on the chip? We are fishing the SW section of the lake which is the Vaughn Lake area and North."
568228,cspierings,2007-08-09 15:33:00,230,I can't speak for the whole lake. The end I was on which would be about the western 1/3 towards Ear Falls I found it pretty good. No everything wasn't marked but when you see your trail heading for shallower water its time to slow down a bit and pay attention. I used the chip to tell me where to look for deep water and if the depth finder showed that it was deep we were able to make real good time. The other area the chip is really shaky is the area up in the inlet of the Wenesaga river. Most of that isn't even mapped in the chip. If you believe the chip you aren't going ot get anywhere near the rapids because on my chip (2007) that is drawn as dry land for quite a ways. Chris
