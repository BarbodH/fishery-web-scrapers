Paul & Debbie that run the camp are great hosts, and went out of their way constantly to make sure we were taken care of. Any more questions let me know."
568159,Mohleye,2007-08-07 14:49:00,368,"I agree that I have never been able to tell that jighead color makes any difference whatsoever. Tail color, yes. Years ago in our youthful enthusiasm we painted thousands of jigs in every color, we will never use them all. I'm pretty sure we could have caught the same # of walleyes on unpainted jigheads. I did have a lot of success with the Blakemore Roadrunner jig this year. Also have done well at times on the Northland jig with the rattle. Do you stay at the main camp at Woman River, or one of the outposts?"
568161,KSauers,2007-08-07 16:11:00,385,"Only use 2 colors,orange/chartruese and pearl white. Almost always use 3/4 or 1 oz. in deep water . If they're actice o/c or neutral I use white."
568172,Guest,2007-08-08 06:29:00,0,"Mohleye - Woman River Camp doesn't have any outposts...perhaps you are thinking of one of the other outfitters up there. The main camp is on Little Bear Lake, which is on the southern end of the river/lake system. We fish anywhere from camp to about 20-25 miles north. There are also about 6-7 portage lakes you can fish. Also agreed with the previous poster - if not using live bait tail color is probably much more important than the jighead color."
568175,Mohleye,2007-08-08 08:39:00,368,"Yeah, I'm familiar with the camp and area. There's an outpost on Shabumeni that I was under the impression Woman River Camp owned. But maybe they sold it, or lease it to one of the fly-in operations."
568107,Guest,2007-08-06 07:42:00,0,Going to lac suel in a week just wondering what the better jig color of choice is. Always use yellow but hear good stuf about gold.
568111,Guest,2007-08-06 09:32:00,0,Been on Lac Seul many times and any jig color will work. My favorite Chartruese.
568127,Guest,2007-08-06 15:57:00,0,"Last year it was a green / chartruse combo. However, I believe location and presentaion are 99.9999% of story."
568136,Guest,2007-08-06 21:19:00,0,"I think that you could give them an unpainted lead and if you gave it to them right, they would bite it."
568145,Guest,2007-08-07 09:57:00,0,"More important than color is weight and presentation. Keep the jig as close to the bottom as possible and NEVER let it have any slack. Work it up and down with a tight line so you can feel the bite. Anytime you feel anything heavy set the hook. Walleye love to just ""hang"" on and sometimes the weight is all you will feel. Use the lightest jig you can that will get you to the bottom. Lighter jigs allow more sensitivity."
568147,Guest,2007-08-07 12:33:00,0,White has always worked great for me. Also have had incredible success at times with very HEAVY jigs (1/2 - 3/4 oz) banging them hard off a rocky bottom...lighter is not always better.

Bouncing larger jigs on rock bottom can be very effective at times. I use that technique in the river on occasion and have had success with it in lakes also. My recommendation for lightest jig possible is for non current situations wher you are depending on feeling the bite. There are many times when the bite is so soft that unless you have light jig you can miss a bite. Thank God for Walleye Fishing and all Jig sizes."

I have had good results with Lindy Techni-Glo Fuzz-E-Grub Jigs and Northland Whistler Jigs while river fishing. I believe it is because their design allows for more action in current. They have more resistance than a ball jig. Blakemore Roadrunners operate on the same principal. Good luck on Woman River. I have heard it is awesome fishing."
