568090,Guest,2007-08-05 06:13:00,0,"I just returned from my 16th year in a row at Holinshead. Another fantastic week. The fish numbers were up having many 100-125 fish days. This lake is far better than any fly-in lake I have been to in Ontario. I highly recommend it to anyone and would be more than happy to mark maps and help out in any way I can for you. We caught several fish in the 20-25"" range again this year with the average running between 16-19"". The facility is great and is the only one on this 6500 acre lake. E-mail me at [email protected] and I'll be more than happy to help you out. The website is www.holinshead.ca"

I will second your remarks on Holinshead, nice lake, good accomidations, good host and the catching was good. Glad to hear you had another good trip! Whopper"
568129,Guest,2007-08-06 16:17:00,0,I have been to the lake many times. The fishing can be good but I find the boats small and underpowered. Too small if the lake blows up and the anchors in the boats are lacking( a pail with concrete) The cabins are OK but in need of upgrades. I find the bait situation when we were there to be lacking. Years ago bait was almost unlimitted and readilly available not the case today. A lot of dated equipment. Generally an OK place but we're looking elsewhere.....
