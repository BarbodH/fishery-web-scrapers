I've been trying to contact the owners for directions for the past several days, but all I get is an answering machine (which they apparently don't check). Does anybody out there know how to get there from Highway 17? Is it before or after Ignace? Are there signs to the camp we can follow? Last time I was there was 1991 and my memory can't summon the info. Other questions I had for the Gummesons were: 1) Do they have grills outside of each cabin or do we bring our own? 2) Do they have life jackets on the boats? 3) Do they a fishing net in the boat? Thanks! Otis"

Caught mostly smallmouth bass on Mamiewegess. Skunked on Indian Lake, but someone caught a 28-inch walleye while I was there, the biggest of the summer so far. Cheers, Otis"
