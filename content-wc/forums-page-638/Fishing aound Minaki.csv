Catastrophe has some nice smallmouth, walleye and pike that don't see a lot of pressure. There are plenty of good banks to work all around the lake. You can spend the better part of the day beating the banks! Just be careful on Catastrophe, there are a few rock reefs that are about 1' under the water -- running sideways across the center of the lake. Until you learn where they are, I don't suggest motoring at high speed. I guess that's why they call it Catastrophe. Chuck"

Just checking to see if anyone knows if it >is worth it to pull out for day and head down there. I was in that area on July 22 for the day. The place to launch is at Goshawk Lake, which is on the reserve. There is a $30 launch fee (ouch!). I would say its worth it to go at least once a year if you are in the Minaki area. It is 37 km up hwy 525 to the launch area and the first 35 km are paved, (nice road ends at the border of the reserve). Goshawk Lake is similar in size to Pistol Lake... from there you go by boat through a large channel that eventually comes into One Man Lake, which is almost the size of Big Sand Lake. There are numerous Islands, Flats and Rock Reefs in this lake. Nothing is marked of coarse. I found lots of places to fish (nice walleyes on every one). From there you head North and go into Umfreville Lake which to me, is just huge. Bigger then Big Sand!! The beauty is that you don't need to go all the way out there to catch lots of fish... Just stay is Goshawk and work the points and small rock reefs and you will catch nice fish. My first one of that day was 28"" in Goshawk. The Natives have strict rules for keeping fish... they will outline them when you pay your launch fee. Anymore questions, just ask. One neat thing you will notice, is that the further you travel from Goshawk down the English River... the water turns red. It starts of like Minaki... decently clear, see down 4 or 5 feet. Must be a lot of minerals in the riverbed."
