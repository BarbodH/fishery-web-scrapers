567966,Guest,2007-07-31 21:43:00,0,What can I expect for weather and the bite in early September? Always go early June but bringing gkids for their first trip. Time to bring my grandkids up North before they start screwl. Mike
567969,Guest,2007-08-01 05:34:00,0,"you can expect the same great fishing that you get all summer long and maybe get a few bigger fish as they seem to bite better once the water and air temps get lower. I have learned through years of september fishing the lake the presentation has to slow down. Even though I usually pull a spinner bait for the walleye, I have to resort to jigging when the temps drop."

Ain't that the truth, we go later in the month and the Columbia quad parka is standard wear some days, ice on the docks one day, sunburning the next...:) Think layers. Al"

The year before, a week later in Sept., I wore every winter item that I brought. 1/2"" frost on the dock and boat one day. The bite is always good... jig and minnow or a worm rig works good for the W'eye. I would try the dropoffs down to 30', but, I caught some big ones in as shallow as 10-12'. Pike are huge this time of year. I use crankbaits and spoons. I'm not sure where to try first this year, NOONE IS POSTING!!! A GULL ROCK REPORT? Procyk's is a nice place to stay."
