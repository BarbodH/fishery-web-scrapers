567788,Guest,2007-07-26 06:53:00,0,I havn't fished Red since last week but the fish were in 17 to 20ft water is around 75 degrees and warming St.Puals bay yesterday was 81 degrees good thing is no mayflies this week.

Big northerns up there also. You need to get right up as close to the rapids as you can, left side looking at the rapids, then drift back, you'll catch a few snags, so try and just bounce the jigs off the bottome every 5-10 seconds to just keep above the bottom. Or achoring to the left side and fan casting that side will work also. Get there early, its a popular spot.. Al"
567794,Guest,2007-07-26 08:44:00,0,Have you tried below the flume dam?
567796,Guest,2007-07-26 09:24:00,0,"Fishing has been a bit tougher the last week or so with the extreme heat we've been experiencing. Try fishing the mouth of Slate Bay (either side of the mouth), Post Narrows, and East Bay. We've been catching fish at 24 to 30 feet of water. Good luck and enjoy our amazing fishery. Remember.....the big ones aren't good eating....if you do (or when you do) catch a big one....take a measurement and photo and put it back in the lake for someone else to catch it."
567800,freespoolin,2007-07-26 10:45:00,472,"We have a boat rule, nothing kept under 14"", nothing over 18"". I know from personal experience a long time ago that the big ones taste like wood. The entrance to Slate Bay has been good in the past. Thanks for the tips. Anything at Wolf Narrows this year?"
567843,Guest,2007-07-27 06:27:00,0,"I fished yesterday found fish in 22-25ft water temp main lake 74 degrees, fish were scattered. It's hot & sunny up here right now."
567856,Guest,2007-07-27 14:50:00,0,"Wolf Narrows I find is a bit slower than the other spots I mentioned. Although, the fish I have caught in the West End tend to be consistently bigger. I took my step-son fishing in middle narrows on Tuesday and he managed to achieve person bests in walleye (27 inches) and northern (46 inches)."

But we caught walleye every day, fished in the Slate Bay-Mackenzie Island area. Ian Cooke has just started pre-fishing for the Labour Day tournament, hoping to do something that's never been done; a back-to-back win."
