568075,Guest,2007-08-04 10:05:00,0,We just got home from Wabaskang. All we used was a 1/4 oz jig and a crawler. Everyone caught Wallys and Bass on um. A lot of walleyes caught. Weather was hot and very windy. Fished the reefs on the windward end of islands. Fish were from 12 feet to 4. It all depended on the time of day.

567979,Guest,2007-08-01 09:27:00,0,All of these baits work very well with a wide varity of tactics. I have and will continue to fish them all depending on the Lake and the sructure and the time of year. Minnows are hard to beat on any rig.

567988,Guest,2007-08-01 12:06:00,0,I have always been a minnow fan but the last two years fishing in early june on Lac Seul I have had the best luck on jig/crawler. More fish and bigger fish than others in the boat fishing minnows. It surprised me but it is a fact.
567990,Guest,2007-08-01 12:20:00,0,Have fished NE Lac Seul late July early August last nine years and a jig and a twister tail tipped with a third of a crawler has always worked as well or better than anything else being used. Has always proved to be the most economical and easiest to transport and keep also! Locopoco a
567992,phishfearme,2007-08-01 14:08:00,1242,"loco - it seems tipping a twister with a minnow will totally negate the ""twisting"" effect of the twister? wouldn't just a jig minnow be as good if not better? phish"
