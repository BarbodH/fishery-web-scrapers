568100,wooglin,2007-08-05 12:48:00,371,"hahahaha, if only that were the case! Thanks for the e-mails and the pics, look forward to future discussions. I'd love to find an acre or two on Lac Seul or the river systems....that'd be ultimate."
567752,wooglin,2007-07-24 14:36:00,371,Do you have any specs on this? Location size of house # bedrooms # baths size lot

567793,AMPHIB206,2007-07-26 08:19:00,191,"If you google Ear Falls Real Estate, you'll see a picture of the property. It's a nice place on the shore of Lac Suel along Gold Pines Road. A bit pricy fro most locals. The owner priced it in US hoping to find a wealthy American to buy it. Is it worth 500K? It's been for sale for awhile."
567795,wooglin,2007-07-26 09:11:00,371,"Links man, links!"
568082,walleye54,2007-08-04 17:06:00,8,Property does come up for sale on the NW end of Lac Seul along the Gold Pines Rd. I bought a two acre lot 6 years ago. The house next to my lot is for sale and is on Timberlane Rd just down from Timberlane Lodge. I believe it might be listed on the Evergreen Lodge website.
568083,wooglin,2007-08-04 18:38:00,371,Is your 2-acre lot on Lac Seul? Is the property that is for sale on Lac Seul?
568084,walleye54,2007-08-04 20:21:00,8,"Yes, on Lac Seul."
568086,wooglin,2007-08-04 21:00:00,371,"Links? The info on Evergreen Lodge is bad, at best."
568087,walleye54,2007-08-04 21:30:00,8,Call Pat at Evergreen Lodge. She can give you all the details and link you up with the seller.
567477,Guest,2007-07-16 22:05:00,0,"Anyone know of any private cabin/house on Lac Seul that someone rents out? Would be interested in staying at a non-resort area with a little more privacy, own fish house, dock, etc. Have stayed at a few other places on Lac Seul and are great but just interested in something a bit different. Spencer"
567696,wooglin,2007-07-23 08:11:00,371,Bump.
567716,Guest,2007-07-23 17:17:00,0,Hi. I did a lot of searching for the same thing. I would even take forest land and build on it. I was told by a lot of people over the years this same thing and that is that canada is not allowing this to happen on lac saul at all because they saw what happened to lake of the woods. on that lake there are homes on every island and piece of land almost all the way to yellow girl. So I doubt anyone except a lodge has private property on las saul. good luck though.
567717,Guest,2007-07-23 17:46:00,0,"There is no such thing as private land around Lac Seul, except what is grandfathered in and whatever you consider the Reserve to be?? Thankfully, we are far too intelligent to allow anything else. And even that took alot of people several years to accomplish. We are finally, FINALLY, with regard to resource and natural area management, achieving success in converting people to realize the intrinsic value of not just Lac Seul, but any natural area. Almost all the U.S, including most of the U.S. upper-midwest lost their chance to preserve such value decades ago, and most poeple know it, whence why thare are so many fishing trips taken to Canada. The '60's, '70's and early-80's witnessed a similar trend as the resource expliotation continued further north, and fisheries like Pike on Lac Seul are still suffering from that time. But the rise of environmentalism thankfully has started to reverse this trend. Multiple lodges have outpost camps on Lac Seul, which from your description, would meet most of your desires. NWO Fishing Bum"
567718,the_bronco,2007-07-23 18:11:00,86,"And I applaud you and your counterparts for your efforts. I just wish that we in the states had the opportunity to witness what was to come and then the foresight to act upon it as you did. In any event, I hope the politicians in your more populated areas don't ruin it for the rest of us outdoorsmen/women who realize what a jewel northwest Ontario really is-whether we are Canadian or American!"
567741,kimh,2007-07-24 12:13:00,4,"I know of a beautiful lake-front property on west end Lac Seul for sale (no realtor). Magnificent home, large garage-shop, floating dock, manicured yard, surfaced road, electricity, well. Approx 2 acres. Ready to move in - no work needed. Only one I know of that can be purcahsed by US or Canadian Resident on Lac Seul."
567742,Guest,2007-07-24 12:27:00,0,Can you give more info on this and maybe a price range.
567743,kimh,2007-07-24 12:50:00,4,Thanks for response. Seller does not want tire-kickers. Are you serious? Price is not cheap but most likely worth it. If you want to be on Lac Seul not many options. Respond back for price range.
567746,wooglin,2007-07-24 13:19:00,371,Would be interested. Please e-mail or PM me more info. on this place.
567751,kimh,2007-07-24 14:19:00,4,"They are thinking $475,000ca but negotiable. It is very nice"
