567507,Superfluke,2007-07-18 13:49:00,13,My group is heading up there next week. I'm wondering if anyone knows about the water levels as I'd like an idea of how far north I can navigate as well as on the south end of Mistassin...From all the map sources available it appears that there is a lot of potential water to fish as long as access is not an issue.
567508,Mr. Walleye,2007-07-18 14:21:00,74,"I haven't been up there this year, but was last, and am hoping to go next summer. I talked to Ryan the other day, and it sounded like the water levels were up. Even if they weren't, Blackbirch is a large lake with plenty of water. Make sure you go up to Mitassin; you won't believe the fishing!!! Have a great trip and post a report when you get back."

568240,Superfluke,2007-08-10 07:35:00,13,"We returned last Friday from our week at Blackbirch Lake Outpost with Northern Outposts. We had a group of 6 which included one guy's 13 year old son. This was the first time at this particular outpost and so of course quite a bit of time was spent learning the water. Similar to Shouldice and Aldred, on both BB and Mistassin, there is a fair amount of very shallow unfishable water that we had to explore and quickly eliminate. The fish on this body of water really seemed to be concentrated, so when you found the deeper cabbage the pike were there and deeper water (10'+) near the shore usually held at least some walleyes. Things were complicated a bit by some problems I had with my locator on the first day - somehow the waterproof seals were compromised and some water got inside. Fortunately, I was able to get it apart, dry it out for a day, play with the screen settings and get some usefulness out of it for the remainder of the trip however it will need to be replaced. My dad and I fished eyes prob 85 % of the time and the other 4 fished pike probably 90 % of the time. In terms of the fishing, our group in total got 9 pike over 40"" and the tally on 35"" was at 51 given our best count estimate. Two of the 40+ came from the portage lake. Did not track 30-35"" fish but I'm certain it was in excess of 50 as well. The 2 largest eyes came in at 24"" and 25"". My dad and I had a few 100 fish days fishing exclusively with jigs and powerbait minnows, 5"" zoom flukes and of course the reliable 3"" twister tails. In terms of the eyes, they seemed to be in all depths from 3' to 16' and we pretty much fished/explored different areas everyday, rather than going back to previous spots where we experienced success. Compared to Keezhik where I have been about 8 - 9 times, I would say the overall numbers of fish are lower however the quality for both eyes and pike are better. One day we caught 25 eyes that went 21 - 23"" on Mistassin. Weather was pretty good for the most part of the week with a couple of days where it rained a bit. This changed on the last full day of as by about 1:00 pm there were 3 foot swells on Mistassin and Blackbirch with heavy wind driven rain which drove everyone off the water. The good news about this was that despite the waves that were rolling over the dock, a few of us were able to mess around and catch 30-40 walleyes off the dock, including all of our take home fish (conservation license) and our fish fry that night. All in all we had a great trip and will be going back there or Keezhik next year."
