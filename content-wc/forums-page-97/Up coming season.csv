6426388,tandm,2020-04-19 12:03:00,679,"Thank you for posting this link. I signed up for the daily email updates to, hopefully, stay abreast of the Canadian situation. I travel to NW Ontario three times each summer, stay at three different lodges, and have become good friends with the owners, operators, support staff and guides at each camp. I know how important the 4-5 month income season is to them and am more than willing to help them thru their plight'. We will be forfeiting this year's deposit to any camp that is unable to accommodate ourgroup. The cost of the deposit is offset by the travel expenses I will not have and , hopefully, it will help carry them thru this difficult time. Hopefully, this Fall, I will find they have weathered the storm, and will accept my deposit for 2021. Hopefully, others will do the same."
6426394,Fisherman Ted,2020-04-19 12:58:00,461,What a nice post Tandm. If only others would feel the same way. We will get through this together.-FT
6426402,kzoofisher,2020-04-19 13:47:00,5144,"It very much sucks. I don't know how the Canadians are going to deal with it and wouldn't presume to tell them. My feeling for here is that a one time bailout will cost far less than the long term support that will be needed from many businesses going bankrupt. Covering unavoidable costs, *holidays* for debt servicing, and enough money to keep people fed and safe would do it IMO."
6426410,Fisherman Ted,2020-04-19 14:23:00,461,"You would think that wouldn't you. Tourism is one of the top GDP producers in Canada. Pumping tens of millions into the economy with many tens of thousands of jobs. When this thing is over Canada will rely heavily on many of them to help lift them back up. So, it would be in their best interest to make sure they don't go under. And with only 4 months to make revenue for an entire year they will go under first. They cannot just open back up in October, season is over. But hey, what do I know."
6426138,kzoofisher,2020-04-18 18:05:00,5144,"Border closing was just extended another 30 days.

We can hope.."
6426234,hoosiercanadian,2020-04-18 22:32:00,104,"I have added CBC news to my phone . I check it daily for the latest news updates all across Canada. As a property owner in Canada the border being closed has me very worried . ......edited................ I am 66 and i do not want anything to do with it. If we get reckless here in the states , that border will probably remain closed . And i can not blame them ."
6426278,Skywagon,2020-04-19 07:22:00,1106,"For what it is worth, keep in mind that CBC is the PBS of Canada, same slant. We see/read about all the uncertainty that is part of this crisis in Canada on our national news feeds, everyone has an opinion with the usual bias's, facts seem to be a moving target and evolve as the weeks go by. Our Provinces have enacted different rules on this thing, just as various states in the US have, there are even concerns in Province to Province travel, let alone International. In N/W Ontario up until now there have been very few cases of this problem, but the ones there were have all tended to be travel related. People here are antsy to get back to work and want to get out, just like is the case in the US, but the consensus here seems to be to use caution before opening the border. A tough situation for the tourist operators and a disappointment to US walleye fisherman, but in an area like N/W Ontario that has limited hospital capacity and an aging population, caution trumps all else."
6426282,eyecatcher1,2020-04-19 07:32:00,323,"I agree Skywagon! I've been going to NW Ontario 2 or 3 times a year for 28 years now and sure would hate to miss a year, but if that's what it takes to keep everyone safe than it's fine with me. I'm just missing a few fishing trips, but I really feel for the resort owners who depend on us to be there to make a living."
6426296,penner,2020-04-19 08:21:00,348,"I'm from Ontario (Canada) and we have some property 6hrs away in Quebec. Was hoping to start a cabin build in May but that's been put on hold. In our property area, they have the bridge crossing the Ottawa river closed to tourists as well as the access roads from the North. Called up to a local last night and he said they have no cases YET. I figure I'll be lucky to get up there late summer, but so be it. Better safe than sorry."

6426374,kcguy68,2020-04-19 11:23:00,51,"I have been selfish in the thought that it is very probable, that I will be losing my 2020 trip. This is very short sighted. The camp owners and small businesses are the ones that I am concerned about now. Over the years I have come to appreciate the hard work that it takes to keep a camp running from year to year. I make it a point to stop into Bobby's Corner, and buy stuff that I don't need, but it's my way of supporting a local business that have been around forever. The Canadian fishing trip is not everyone's cup of tea....but it is certainly my vacation of choice. Hopefully we see a turning point within the next month."
6425576,v-bay gord,2020-04-17 17:45:00,3168,"Things are up in the air. If you need to cross the border to get to your camp you are in a bind. Hopefully things can be resolved on that front. It's hard to hire staff and proceed when things are so unsure. Some camps will be able to bounce back at the last minute...others will not. Distance, staffing, size are all considerations. If you have a reservation I would hang in there and hope for the best....hopefully reservations will be moved to a future date. The real remote camps will be the most suffering in this...costs are so high, and there is no room for error. The bottom line folks, is take this situation seriously. There will only be openings if things are on the right track....politics is bullcrap and should be ignored."

6425596,RichA$1970,2020-04-17 18:58:00,1159,"Tough question is at what date is not worth the investment of opening for a partial season and if that would impact any government funding? I know it depends on the camp, ownership and other factors, so I guess camping if the parks do open might be the option."
6425614,v-bay gord,2020-04-17 19:51:00,3168,"The border will likely be relaxed once things look good or other positive factors come into play. I don't want to be political, but here in Canada the social isolation and other mitigating factors seem to be accepted. If the US takes a different approach (individual freedom to decide) then that might delay things."
6425832,Skywagon,2020-04-18 08:24:00,1106,"Good chess move Gord, you went just far enough that nobody can respond without getting dinged Hopefully a quick-definitive test will become available in quantity soon that can be used by both of the borders upon entry, this would be a means of keeping both sides safe until a better solution is available. To be fair, I could see that the person entering the border should be responsible for the cost of administering such a test. That would certainly diminish cross-border travel, but would give those that are serious about crossing a means to do so."
6425868,v-bay gord,2020-04-18 09:16:00,3168,Check mate... The idea of a test would be a possible solution....let's hope it happens!
6425884,emma17,2020-04-18 09:31:00,436,I'm with you guys - a swab check at the border paid for by the traveler- seems like something to really hope for. Technology is moving fast right now.
6426002,KSjim,2020-04-18 13:12:00,88,"This is a very fluid situation. Hopefully a year from now, all will be well, and we can examine what approaches we need to take in future such situations. Use your best judgement and stay safe!"
6426048,Jack68133,2020-04-18 14:55:00,14,I spoke with my outfitter this week and he said that this could be a real possibility. This solution would mean longer waits at the border but it would be a workable compromise for everyone.

6424800,Braggart,2020-04-15 22:01:00,22,"Personally, the discussion of may vs sept shouldn't be about weather, as both months can be unpredictable. I'm sure everyone has had stellar weeks in both spring and fall, as well as weeks where you throw on every piece of clothing you brought in an effort to stay alive! For me, the biggest difference is the amount of available daylight. I really enjoy fall fishing, the dry air, the changing leaves, the noticeable absence of bugs...but when it starts getting dark at 630-700pm, I come to realize that time is short and the season is soon coming to an end. Late May is still hit and miss. It's time to dust off the gear and get back on the water. It's seldom ""entirely"" enjoyable, more often than not it's a battle with the weather (up here in Canada anyways). As noted above, Sept is enjoyable, but it gets dark far too early. It also doesn't get light as early. Oct is even worse. It really condenses the day on the water. June...especially early June is my sweet spot. Lots of light early and into the evening. The weather is improving, the fish are predictable. I can only hope and pray that by June I'll be allowed to launch as planned... Fingers crossed! B"
6424832,Eckohlt,2020-04-16 05:42:00,3685,"Braggart in the fall you are correct about day light,just have to have the boat motor fired up at sunrise pack a sandwich and don't shut the motor off until your back at the dock at dark,I fish in the fall with a sandwich hanging out of my mouth lol"
6425038,v-bay gord,2020-04-16 14:37:00,3168,"I had posted a link regarding the US Canada border closure...apparently it was too controversial and was deleted. Was it the news source? Content? It wasn't political. Basically the title was ""Canada not close to relaxing border restrictions"". That was the extent of the story as told by our Prime Minister. Sorry if some out there can't tolerate a different narrative. Just thought the anglers in the crowd might like to know...."
6425046,Golden Eagle,2020-04-16 14:55:00,2642,"Wear plenty of orange. Don't fish in a creek mouth or back of a bay. Check locations and times with moose hunters so you won't spook their animal or get shot. I fish humps in big water when out early or late in the day. Fishing can be outstanding, but a week of really strong wind can steal your pleasure. I've been in camp for a 12"" snow and a 15"" snow. October 2020 will find me in NW Ontario. Walleye opener has little chance for me this year. My party of 14 for July 18 week is a strong possibility. If July trip doesn't happen, I'll go in late September and come out sometime."
6425056,Carnhzkr,2020-04-16 15:17:00,964,"I didn't see your post Gord, but thanks for sharing it. I did a search on ""Canada not close to relaxing the border restrictions"" and there are lots of links to articles siting Trudeau as stating that Canada won't be opening the border anytime soon. Unfortunately, it is still vague and leaves when ""anytime soon"" is completely up to the imagination. Is it the end of May, June, July or December? It's still a waiting game. Moderators, this is crucial information to many faithful readers of this site that have Canadian fishing trips planned. I check this site daily hoping to see updates from key folks such as Gord, Ted, and Jared - people that keep their finger on the pulse of the current border crossing status. I realize moderating a forum such as WC isn't an easy job and I applaud the effort to control the political mudslinging, but this is information that directly impacts our Canadian fishing trips and the reason many of us read this site. I hope lodge owners and others that may be aware of current border crossing news continue to share that information on this site."
6425072,Fisherman Ted,2020-04-16 16:19:00,461,"Ironically lodge owners look at this site to get a feel for what's going on as well. LOL. I saw your post title and was disappointed when it was pulled. Open communication is crucial in times like this. I try to be up front (sometimes to a fault) when I tell you what I'm thinking. In no particular order. I just got off the phone with 2 high end lodges in Alaska that are both closing their doors this summer. Too much of an unknown. No flights. And the kicker is the liability potential. We are starting to hear wavering and or nebulous answers from our insurance companies on liability. What would happen if our staff or guests got sick when we open? Or God forbid died. Bloomberg just reported that some insurance companies are not covering businesses if this were to occur. I just talked to my agent who said they were in talks with company lawyers on this situation. To be blunt. If we aren't covered we aren't opening. Plain and simple. This up in the air situation has been seen on many industry calls with numerous boards. Until we get an answer sorry, I am closed. That aside it's starting to hit home that no way are we opening anytime soon. There are no grants or bailouts in the works either. Talk is cheap. There is a 40K interest free loan some can get access to. But that's about it right now. The wage subsidy announced doesn't cover seasonal businesses. So that's out. Every week I sit on a call the more it starts to hit home that the season is slipping away. My only hope is that your favorite lodge can hang on another year and be there when all this is behind us. Be safe -FT"
6425348,wmd,2020-04-17 08:43:00,388,Many lodge owners would normally be going into their camps in the next couple of weeks to prepare for the upcoming season. What do you think they are going to do? Get ready for the season as normal or do some prep work so they would be able to complete the tasks needed in a short period of time? There are so many unknowns at this time I would hate to be in their shoes.To say nothing of the expense necessary to have the supplies needed to open. I wish all owners the best of luck and hope they can survive this situation with minimal losses. wmd
6425368,Fisherman Ted,2020-04-17 09:00:00,461,"Well they just extended the border closure for another 30 days.So I am not going anywhere, and the season opener is toast. But we knew that already. Now its just more concrete.Assuming we have any season at all there are many variables. If we ASSUME we can open (and we even want to) we would have to be able to get in the country. And then get it operational as fast as possible. And make sure our staff are still available and willing to actually work.Yes, some work can be done ahead of time depending on the operation. But the more expensive or hard it is the more risk of it not getting done. Why as an operator would I start to fly supplies to remote outpost cabins and or open them up if I am unsure we are going to open. A lot of risk/expense. In my situation with a drive in the expense is less. But it is still a big undertaking opening up 18 lakes, 45 boats, water, septic, fixing stuff etc. I need to be there to do much of that. At some point the call gets made by every operator that it isn't worth it.-FT"
6425376,Carnhzkr,2020-04-17 09:12:00,964,"So what does the 30 day extension put the new ""official"" date at? May 31, with a tentative open on June 1?"
6424432,prov1800,2020-04-15 07:50:00,5010,So as spring is slowly showing up in North Western Ontario i would like to reflect on the new year.Started off with a bang and running smoothly.Thanks to Wayne and Karla Clark for once again allowing me to fish there fantastic ice shack and using there awesome minnows.Met up with some of there ice fishing guests and fishing at Anishnabi Lodge.Then BOOM.The virus showed up and changed all of our lives.Some worse than others depending where you lived.Here in the north it doesnt seem to bad compared to other big centres.So glad i live as remòte as i do and cant imagine living in a place like New York.We can still go about our lives fairly normal except for the social distancing which we take seriously as some do not.Some people are still working and others not.Borders are closed and nobody is quite sure when they will be open.So as far as our tourist season goes that's a no go as of the next few months i would think.So whats a fishing guide to do.lol.Since we live in Ontario and all rules and regs come from Toronto with there huge populations there* we are stuck here with there rules of no crown land camping and the possibility of publuc launches closing like whats happening in the states.But a lot of us dont need to use those so fishing will happen and think we can social distance on any lake without any problem.I would probably think we wont see another boat.Hopefully the border will open at sometime and be safe enough to allow a part of a season to happen.Good luck to all.Hope to see some of you.

6424518,bthomas3333,2020-04-15 10:22:00,465,"No to be preachy about this. I think we should all assume May and June are lost. If our finances are hanging in there take what you would've spent in May and June and get a trip for July (maybe) or Aug or September. The lodges will certainly need it. Honestly all of us fishermen will need it too.If we are all being honest when we say the intangibles of fishing are more important than the species or numbers or size then what does it really matter if you fish in August vs June. (I didn't say September because it is so good and quiet I want to keep it a secret...lol) I know a LOT of us have finances which are a mess right now so maybe it is good we keep the money in our pockets, but if you can still afford it. Quit being sad and make plans and go fish!B-"
6424524,eyecatcher1,2020-04-15 10:29:00,323,"I agree and since I'm retired I'll be heading north as soon as we can and the resort has a cabin available. As far as September fishing goes bthomas, who told you about it? LOL! In September of 92 I went there and was the only one at the resort. The resort couldn't believe that I wanted to come up there then. Since then it's caught on, but still a lot fewer fisherpeople than earlier in the year."
6424530,prov1800,2020-04-15 10:39:00,5010,As a fisherman who does fish late season and will admit it can get cold but if you can handle it the fishing is definatly worth it.Dressing right is the ticket.I find Sept basically is not all that bad with a lot of days warmer than what most people would imagine and have fished into october where it was gorgeous out.Some openers here actually most of them can be colder than fall.lol.
6424560,bthomas3333,2020-04-15 11:15:00,465,Agreed on the September weather but as a guy who has fished the Ontario opener around Red Lake weather in May can be REALLY tough. I have fished in all day snow / sleet / 39f with less than great results. Trading May weather for Sept isn't really that big of deal in my experience.
6424610,HeHooksHimself,2020-04-15 12:05:00,725,"Our pattern has been a trip with a group in May and a trip with my BIL Doc in September. We are both aging gracefully and can see that there will be an end to our Canadian fishing adventures, hopefully later rather than sooner. I am an eternal optimist, so believe it or not I am still holding out for our scheduled trip for opening week. I think things could open up as fast as they closed down, so you never know. Our May trip is at our go to place but we always try something new or different for Fall and this year we are booked at Savant Lake. I am so glad we have these arrangements made because I would think there will be quite a demand for late season fishing. In any case I hope all my WC friends are safe and I am so thankful for WC so I can see Simon's adventures (Limeyangler) and Gordy's insightful posts. It seems it is about time for PJ Shorthorn to start shopping for yoga pants and gathering his flamingoes. Some things have to be normal! I can't wait to be saying: Fish On! Hooks"

Some Labor Day trips the weather was fantastic and others we like to froze to death.Fishing was good in September, though ""different"" than August. Had to adjust and do more hunting and changing things up.Don't be afraid to go late, but plan on some cold weather many years. Layers, layers, layers.Pooch"
