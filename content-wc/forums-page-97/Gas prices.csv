6426240,Lmbkiller,2020-04-18 23:27:00,639,Certainly don't disagree with those statements. Big oil can eat it. I hope I'm wrong but I bet gas is $5 a gallon in a few yrs in this aftermath. The chickens will come home to roost for the US basically giving money away at ridiculous levels. Ridiculous prices of goods and services isn't too far away
6426244,Guest,2020-04-19 03:29:00,0,Wautoma Wi in Central Wisconsin .91 cents a gallon at most stations. Shell .94 but if you have a Shell Rewards card 5 cents off a gallon .89 cents. I can't fill anymore gas cans they are all full.
6425606,hoppy63,2020-04-17 19:20:00,367,curious of how (much) the oil market is affecting gas prices in NW Ontario......in NW Ohio I've seen $1.19 gal......how about your areas?????
6425612,Stringbean,2020-04-17 19:34:00,279,"Actually, the gas prices like everywhere else have come down nicely. I have posted this link for the Dryden area. https://www.gasbuddy.com/GasPriceMap...696128467&z=15"
6425638,Lmbkiller,2020-04-17 22:01:00,639,Still about $2.28/gal us.....over $1 per gallon more than here but much better than last few yrs
6425694,tv4fish,2020-04-18 05:27:00,2694,Here in central Minnesota - paid $1.29/gal. at a local station -- in the Metro St. Paul/Mpls. area - still around $1.79.
6425786,Lund1875#,2020-04-18 07:26:00,280,$1.30 central Kansas. I had 70 cents off on fuel points from Kroger....30 gallons for 18 bucks.
6425882,Ltrain,2020-04-18 09:31:00,4145,"Don't worry it'll be going up shortly. OPEC and Russia just came to a deal for OPEC, and Mexico and the USA to scale back oil production."
6425886,Rock Lobstar1,2020-04-18 09:34:00,134,55 cents in Calgary. I'm going to fill up everything before the price starts going back up.
6426128,bus33,2020-04-18 17:37:00,289,We had .94 in Central Iowa yesterday. Sucks there's nothing to do so we can burn some gas. My mower only takes 6 gallons
6426224,Lmbkiller,2020-04-18 22:19:00,639,"Disagree itrain, basically no one is using it, so it doesn't matter how much production is cut"
6426236,Ltrain,2020-04-18 22:42:00,4145,You very well may be right.....until the travel bans are lifted at least Btw by me it's 1.55 and in Chicagoland area its still 2 bucks and higher. From 1987 til 2000 oil was lower per barrel then it is right now. Then the production slowed and we ended up near 100 bucks a barrel for a time which is crazy. Artificially controlled market to suck us dry. Prices should have always been where they are now. Big oil still making plenty of profits
