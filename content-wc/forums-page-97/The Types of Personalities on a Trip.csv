6419616,Aspencreek,2020-04-06 08:16:00,2911,"Love this thread!!!! A couple of ""guys"" have come to mind. My brother invited an old friend along, gave him the specs of the trip, made sure he understood what he needed to bring, etc. etc. My son, brother, myself and ""Dave"" head to Canada in my truck, get to the border and Dave doesn't have his Passport, but the real delay is when we find out Dave has also had a 2 yr old DUI. He can't get in, turned around at the border. After discussing the problem with the group, we dropped Dave off at a hotel in I Falls and told him to catch the bus back home or use whatever means of transportation he chooses....I'm going fishing. I also made the mistake of inviting an old friend and ""best man"" at my wedding several years ago. He was going thru a tough time, divorce (his 2nd), kid in jail, the list was long. We had a last minute cancellation and decided to ask him to join us, maybe the Canada air will help........nope, let's call him Debbie Downer. He was always in a bad mood, never smiled, complained the whole time, couldn't get him to laugh or joke about anything. And my son can get anyone to come around. It was a struggle to be in the same boat, no conversation, didn't give a wit about anything. I even asked if there might be some place on the lake he would like to jump in and end it all, because I was willing to accommodate him. Thankfully we made it through the week, I dropped him back at his home and we haven't spoken or seen each other since."
6419630,Dacotah Eye,2020-04-06 08:48:00,2722,I invited a friend to be our third person on a Canadian trip. We travel in the same vehicle and stay in the same cabin. Two days before we were to leave he called and said his dad couldn't go so he wasn't going. I have no idea why he would think his father was included on a three man trip. Luckily I had another friend who took his place and went every year. He was asked on Wednesday and had to drive 300 miles to Minneapolis to see his lawyer in order to leave at 5 am on Friday. He liked Canadian fishing so much he went three times a year once we got him to try it.
6419676,Aspencreek,2020-04-06 10:40:00,2911,"Wow....big assumption! My question to you is, if he showed up to leave and had in fact brought his father, which one were you going to leave at home?"
6419680,Golden Eagle,2020-04-06 11:04:00,2642,Sometimes we make it too easy for other members of the party.
6419682,Dacotah Eye,2020-04-06 11:14:00,2722,"I really don't know what would have happened since I had fished with his family for years. My brother and I were not real close as we should have been, but did do things together occasionally. Many years ago our mother offered to pay for a Canadian fishing trip for the two of us to get us together as brothers. I invited him to go with me and he said he would get back to me. When he called me in a couple of weeks he said he didn't want to go because his buddy couldn't get the time off. He passed away two years ago and we never did much together as brothers because he wouldn't do anything without his best buddy being there also."
6419688,JOE WALLEYE,2020-04-06 11:29:00,753,"We have a guy on our trip that over complicates everything. We call him the doodler. EVERYTHING is a process with him. Tying the boat to the dock takes no less than 20 minutes as he adjusts 6 ropes and puts equal tension on each and then adjusts each rope time and time again until he is satisfied. Breading fish at shore lunch.....we just stand back and snicker as he adds beer until it's too wet, ads more dry mix until it's too dry, back to the beer, back to the dry mix. This can go on for ever if you let it. He also mixes the batter 22 times between each filet (we counted one time) LOL. We trade off on which boat is going to come in early to cook dinner. When he is cooking he comes in 3 hours early to make chicken on the grill. Don't get me wrong it's delicious chicken but I don't want to trade 3 hours of fishing time for it. He really is a great guy and now that the rest of us have learned to accept his quirks it works out fine. But don't get in a hurry around him or you will be frustrated beyond belief."
6419696,gordy28,2020-04-06 11:36:00,437,So glad this thread has provided so much entertainment - I am guessing many of us are spending more time online than in the past and a good chuckle is much needed Mr Snags a lot could be me. On our Ogoki trip we had one spot where the driver was getting fish every pass and I just kept getting snagged! I think I broke off 2 bottom bouncers which is hard to do lol I must also say I fall into the category of fish butcher. I feel bad for the two guys who are our main filet knives and offered to help. I think I got through one fish when they demoted me back to being gut bucket guy!
6419702,Dacotah Eye,2020-04-06 11:48:00,2722,"We had four guys, two boats and one cabin one year. My buddy and I decided to get off the water and shower early. We got our showers over with, made Lake Trout for supper and finally ate it since they weren't back and it was dark. When they finally showed up they wanted us to clean their six Northern Pike while they ate and took showers. I didn't feel like cleaning someone's slime bags because they wouldn't get off the water until they had their limit. One of them was the guy who told me cooking, cleaning and dishes was women's work. To them maybe cleaning fish was also. Scratch two more. lol"
6419718,Aspencreek,2020-04-06 12:55:00,2911,"This is a great Thread.I actually thought that I had all the weird friends and family, now I know I'm not alone.When I plan the trip it is always just 6, 3 boats. And the normal 4-5 that go all know what job they have around camp. The filet guy (my son), the cook (me), the dishes guy (my brother), the bait and ice guy (a friend) he fills the bait buckets and bait wells and supplies ice for every boat every morning including crawlers and leeches, and he loves his job. Mainly because he is always the first one up and drinks coffee so strong it would remove rust. And finally the bartender (another friend), we are an easy group, Kokanee, Blues and Weisers and Coke but he also delivers, to the fish house, while tending the fish frier, during meals, etc. Whenever someone else shows up we tell them to rotate to just help out, once in a while we will get the non-starter, or the one who is more concerned with his own comfort above all others, they can't ever figure out why they are not invited back??"
6421684,Golden Eagle,2020-04-10 15:49:00,2642,Thinking it's more likely he'll show up sometime with only 1 eye. Coat hangers can be made into dangerous weapons.
6421728,andreindy,2020-04-10 16:50:00,308,"Emma17, you are so right about Fish On guy! That is a great one. With my group, ALL 6 of us are ""Get the Net!"" Guys. That gets yelled so often and so unnecessarily by everyone that to illicit an actual response from your boat mate it needs to be followed with escalating threats ""I really mean it this time"" or even ""I'm going to kill you if I lose this fish""."

I'm in the fish cleaning shack and tending the fish fryer while others are mixing drinks and starting sides. We know what we are good at.How about the you should have been there... guy. When the fishing is slow the 'you should been on the trip we took to X' comments come rolling out. It is usually tied to the first day or two when we are trying to figure out a new bite, basically because of his impatience. Yeah, I'm sure glad you are telling me about the trip I didn't get invited to where the fishing was so much better than it is now... How about the 'you should have been here yesterday guy.'

6420818,Matcaz,2020-04-08 15:14:00,22,"Reading some of these brought back a memory that makes me smile every time I recall it, and laugh out loud every time I tell it. My best friend from childhood, best man in my wedding, and favorite fishing partner was with me on every one of our Canadian fishing trips. He has a problem with dry hands and often gets cracks in his skin on his fingers. THis problem is magnified after a week long fishing trip handling and cleaning fish. On our 23 hour drive home after one trip we stop to get gas. My friend goes in the gas station an buys a bottle of hand lotion to remedy his dried and cracked fingers. They only have one type and the bottle is quiet large. As he approaches the counter and lays his merchandise down, the cashier gives him a strange look. Bless her heart, she didn't say a word to him. But the expression on her face betrayed the thoughts she held privately. He got into the van as we were ready to leave and asked the others in our group if we thought she was acting oddly to us as well. For me it was obvious, but he just wasn't connecting the dots. You see, along with his hand lotion, drink, and snack he had also purchased....an adult magazine. I'm smiling even as I type this. Good times and memories for sure."

6421254,RichA$1970,2020-04-09 16:13:00,1159,"We also have one, my father, who would be classified as the “Meltdown.”It could be something so stupid as bringing leeches vs crawler in the boat for a day, not trolling at the right speed or you name it and kaboom, a major meltdown that had to be somebody’s fault. After an *** chewing and several minutes, all is well. The other personality is the “Pervert.” We have an old guy who has fished this fly in for over 15 years and he takes us there one summer. His literature would have made Larry Flindt proud and when we landed I threw my ruck sack on a bunk and the little twerp said that is where he always bunks so I said no problem n grabbed the other bedroom. Low and behold his special bunk was next to the bathroom wall and a perfect peep hole was next to his pillow. His previous trips had wives and girlfriends so I bet he spent a lot of time in that special bunk."

With the old bunch we were on the water by 6:30 am and off by about 5:00 pm. With my son running things I get up and start breakfast about 7:30 am and he heads to the shower house. When he gets back about 9:30 am he has cold bacon and eggs and I have lunch ready for the boat. We hit the lake and get off fairly early to enjoy a beer or mixed drink before making supper. It makes for a relaxing trip for the two of us and I'm looking forward to the next one. Maybe some day he will tell me why a shower and shave takes two hour, but ot is his vacation time."

6419826,ILScott,2020-04-06 18:23:00,139,"I have been on trips with up to ten and as little as four. The group of 10 had some characters. We had the boozers that drank all day and stumbled into the cabin at night. The all nighters that stayed up until 3 or 4 every night just sitting around bs'ing. We had the young bucks that had to be told what to do but most of the time were out fishing and just came into eat and did very little chores. We had a magazine man that brought up adult magazines. We had a tackle guy that brought the kitchen sink of tackle all the way back from the 60's until now. That group branched off to other groups Then I had a group of 5. 3 kids and me and another dad. The kids all newbies loved it and helped out. They went and got ice in the ice hose, got water for doing dishes. The oldest even fried the fish. I did less work with the 3 kids than the 10 person group. They made sure we had gas and bait every morning. We even let them clean fish. So these boys would be called super kids. All five of us are planning to go back this year, hopefully. My last trip was with 4 people and it was an easy trip. We did have the tackle guy but kept him to what worked. But in this group we had what I called wanna be 21 year olds. Two retired guys thinking they are still 21 when drinking. It cost them a half a day fishing because the recovery time was a little longer.Still a fun time and even the owner asked what was wrong with those two the next morning at noon."

Or the guy who, about 10 years ago, was going to bring chicken and potatoes across the border, and never mind the bans in place. Or someone who thinks he can hide a pound of leeches in an orange juice container. (To be fair, though, the last example was something I heard about from a friend.) Years ago, the Russian-roulette border crosser also included guys who might hide a few extra walleyes under the seat when coming back across the border, but you don't hear much about that anymore, the fines being way too high."
6420234,emma17,2020-04-07 09:21:00,436,"We do have two of the why don't you just go in the cabin before we leave the dock crew members. Last year I brought the snap-on toilet seat w 5 gallon bucket for the wife. Well, I guess when people are really comfortable around each other, there's no rule that the bucket be limited in its use."
6420332,Hwy 101,2020-04-07 14:04:00,33,"We had a guy that was planning on bringing home way over his limit. He was a BIL of one of the groups regulars. We had been warned that he was potentially going to be a loose cannon, but the group has been together for long time and was good at over coming obstacles. He was always cleaning fish that never made it into shore lunch. The dock hand tipped us off that there were unmarked bags in the freezer knowing that our group never takes fish home. The last day someone went back to camp and grabbed all of the excess fish for our shore lunch. The look on his face when the old guys thanked him for supplying all the fish was priceless."
6420538,gordy28,2020-04-08 06:15:00,437,Forgive me if this is a repeat - our friend Mark earned the nickname the jigging gnome on our trip to Shekak Lake - his boat looked like a hovel and he was only focused on the fish and the nickname was born. I am not sure what I would label the personality - maybe the Pigpen - the guy whose boat looks like a bomb went off and throughout the week he is constantly looking for things he believes he has lost but the are simply buried under all of his other crap. This guy is fine in the cabin its his boat thats the mess and its due to his complete zen like focus on catching fish Here is the post I wrote about the Jigging Gnomehttps://www.northernjacks.com/post/t...of-shekak-lake
6420542,lmoore,2020-04-08 06:44:00,40,"Not with our group, but a couple ""If it can bite, so can I"" guys used to go to the same lodge our group goes to every year. They fished out of flat bottom type boats and they would keep basically everything they caught and just throw it in the bottom of the boat. Come in at the end of the day and they would have a whole stinking mess of fish with them and clean every one of them. A few people said something to them and it fell on deaf ears, do the lodge owner waited for them to get in one day and sat there while they released every fish still alive enough to swim. Haven't seen that group in a few years"
6420736,andreindy,2020-04-08 13:33:00,308,"OK, one last one because I feel like this personality should get their due. I will call this personality the Happy to be Alive Guy. This is the guy who generally does not seem to get as irritated, as angry, as bothered by routine nuisances, set-backs or hardships while on the trip. In its purest state, this guy is not sanctimonious, this guy is just genuinely happy to be alive. He is a ""stop and smell the roses"" guy and he puts his hands into the water to actually FEEL the water. He smells the Northern Pike slime on purpose. He marvels at the baitfish under the dock and laughs at the clouds of mayflies. This guy is noticeably less dismayed from a missed morning of fishing because of a storm. It is not that he doesn't have preferences, it is just that they are reasonably suspended by this gratitude and inner directive to take IT ALL IN. The Happy to Be Alive Guy is sometimes shaped by a life experience. Health scare. Health reality. It could be advancing years. Or the kind of epiphany that sort of rattles our understanding of our mortality. Maybe none of these things. This guy might be the guy that just lays down on the end of the dock and you can't help but join him."
6419724,gbin,2020-04-06 13:25:00,1384,"One summer when I was a boy my uncle invited me to join his family on a week-long trip to a lake resort owned by his in-laws in Canada. We weren't close, but he knew that I was crazy for fishing and figured that way he'd always have a companion on the water (none of his family were into it) and at least somewhat of a buffer between him and them, as well. His heart was generally in the right place, but that's about the only thing that ever was.He drank heavily whenever he was ashore, and his wife did, too. They got into I don't know how many drunken shouting matches that week, and one drama after another with the kids, too. And of course he was foulmouthed, racist, sexist... I bailed on the cabin on Day 1 to get away from all of it and instead slept in their stinking pickup camper. ( I swear, that guy never bathed, either!)He was difficult to put up with on the water, too. On one day's outing, for example, he aggressively berated me when I started casting a TX rig out to some rocky shoals we were slowly passing because the passage was relatively narrow and quite shallow, though our guide for the day (one of his in-laws, a nice guy) was just fine with it. He actually started all-out yelling at me when he thought that I'd snagged in the rocks. ""We're not going back for it! You'll just have to break your line!!!"" I would have been fine with that, but of course it was unnecessary; my retrieve wasn't particularly difficult or time-consuming, and the 4 lb smallmouth I'd caught put on quite a tail-walking show to keep us all entertained.On another day he and I went out alone and trolled weedlines for northerns. We each caught only a few hammer handles, with me throwing mine back - and again getting yelled at for it - and him keeping his. That was bad enough, but then as we were heading back to the dock he hollered to another boat that was also going in to ask them what they caught and they held up a couple of very nice pike - and when they asked us in turn he quickly shouted ""No luck today!""... and after they'd motored past us he took his now mostly dead fish off his stringer and let them float away behind us. I chewed HIM out for that one when I saw what he'd done.The thing is, I well knew what he and his family were like before I ever agreed to go along on the trip, so none of his/their antics actually surprised me. Pretty much always disgusted and occasionally even angered me, yes, but never surprised me. And I did manage to have some fun here and there, too, just as I'd hoped. One day I even limited on walleye for my first time ever!I just thought of (and thereafter referred to) him as... The Price of Admission. Gerry"
6417982,emma17,2020-04-01 14:55:00,436,"I can really relate to this one Andreindy:Our version of this guy is the ""master caster"". The guy that loves the challenge of casting the expensive lure into the exact spot on the shoreline between the log in the water and the rock. Never mind the overhanging branch, he'll hit his spot. NOT. And since he has 100 lb test, he's going to pull and pull that sucker out of there, so now, we all have to be on ""lure in the eye"" watch in case he frees the snag. And for those times when he can't yank it out, it's head into the shallows time. You know, the time where you stand on the bow and control the minn kota by hand, lifting and steering around all the rocks just waiting to take your prop out."

And when he does make it to the dock, suddenly a 6 pack shows up about 10am. 3) The Picky eater guy....like was said before....don't get me started. Look BUD, do I look like your wife??? Besides I've eaten your wife's cooking, my dog turned his nose up and walked away, and you order haddock at the fri nite fish fries, we are having walleye now, go sit in the corner. 4) The ""cant do enough to please guy"" although fun to have along and would do anything to get invited back.

6418304,Matcaz,2020-04-02 10:39:00,22,"While reading through this thread I can say that we've been lucky enough to have groups where everyone is of like mind and puts out the same effort (for the most part). I there are a couple categories that I would like to add. 1. The Bartender: On our trips we had an individual who lacked any type of competency regarding the ability to fillet a fish. He was admittedly open about it. He would rather someone else clean the fish than have him butcher a fillet. To compensate, he would go to the cabin and grab/mix everyone's drink of choice and bring it down to the cleaning station. And like any bartender, he kept late hours so naps in the boat at mid-day were a necessity. 2. Mr. Homeless: This person was really the only one of all our trip that gave us issues, and he only lasted one trip. He was not willing to put in the work others did. Instead, he would crawl into his bed and take a nap. This applied to cleaning fish, packaging fish, cooking, dishes and was, to put in nicely, untidy. As the week would ware on his hygiene, or lack there of, made him match the description."
6418408,KSjim,2020-04-02 15:26:00,88,The one type I have never understood over the years is the guy that seems to be very willing to do whatever you ask him. But on the other hand is very willing to do nothing if not asked. It seems like even a nubie after the first day or two would pick up on the pattern that each day is kind of a rinse and repeat of the previous and just do some of the chores on his own.

But this pretty much sums it up. My personal least favorite is the opinionated ghost. Have had a couple of them and hate them the most. I love the tackle guy and the nervous Nellie cause I can learn from them and experience humor at their expense with them acknowledging. All with love of course. I tolerate most everything and everyone but the guy bloviating about everything, and doing nothing to help, is the guy never to come back. You combine the two and he comes back....hmmm. That.

We were driving a 4 cylinder mimi van and had to stop every 100 miles on the way north because ""We always stop here on the way up."". On the way back we were worried about finding a station before running out of gas. Everything had to be done according to how things had been done ""for twenty five years-. No depth finder in his boat because ""the guides know how deep the water is"". The worst part was that we travelled about 800 miles to fish for hammer handle Northern Pike that I throw back in South Dakota. I had ten days to spend in Canada and as soon as we had our posession limits of hammer handles he wanted to go home. Just one more who didn't make a second trip. We did eventuslly end up with a crew of eleven and we all got along great. Too bad I am the only living member of this bunch of guys and no longer make the trip.

6418996,andreindy,2020-04-04 09:38:00,308,"This made me laugh! You nailed it. Last year we all learned how to fish vertical over rocks somewhat quickly, or experience significant frustration. It is inevitable that someone decides to pitch way out horizontally to cover water they believe holds the large walleye they intend to flaunt in their boat mate's face. From a distance I watched my brother in law do this in the 14' Naden he shared with my brother and nephew. Snag, of course. The decision to pursue that pink 3/8 oz. VMC Mooneye jig with a Northland Impulse 4"" Paddle Minnow in Electric Chicken was a fateful and pivotal one. The wind and waves were blowing into a large mid lake hump of exposed boulders precariously close to mr.jig. I turned to my Dad when I fully understood their intentions and said ""Oh boy. Hand me the popcorn"". They idled up, got jostled around by waves, boat swung around, overreactive throttle corrections, a few yelps of panic, motor dies, desperate yanks, pandemonium, stumbling over each other. But it was all for naught. The rocks got them...and the jig of course. They all had to go into the drink to get out of that mess. In the end, we laughed, learned and would become slightly less of fools because of it."
6419380,Guest,2020-04-05 13:35:00,0,"What about the guy who fishes 16-18 hours a day for a week, and eventually leads everyone to the where they are hitting and what they are biting on? I usually assume that role, so everyone else can fish when they want and still catch plenty. Especially handy on a new lake."
6415708,Mojo-NC,2020-03-27 07:33:00,1929,"I'm the planning guy and also one of those guys who brings a lot of tackle and always packs more stuff than I really need - clothes, jackets, camera, binoculars, etc. I'm not quite sure exactly where I fit into the spectrum. When I find a hot bait, I'm always willing to share if I have more. However, the running joke when I'm tearing them up on a specific bait (often times a homemade spinner rig), it's always my last one and if anyone else wants to use it or something very similar, the price is very high."
6415766,Moosebunk,2020-03-27 08:57:00,211,Crazy that some can be all these types rolled up into one.
6415770,MikeF,2020-03-27 09:08:00,895,Some are just more versatile than others.
6415854,Walleye2242,2020-03-27 11:53:00,263,"I guess I am the planner. We only have like a group of 4 now. I cook..others clean basically. We all do out individual parts and makes the group work. We did have the ""lazy"" guy for a few years...never cleaned, never filleted fish, never ran the boat. Never really bothered me until one night we were out late fishing...i cleaned the fish...was starving...he went straight to the cabin...after i cleaned the fish....headed to the cabin, looking forward to a nice bowl of chili...walked in just in time to see him finishing off the last bowl."
6415926,Rock Hound,2020-03-27 15:01:00,51,"Our group for sure has a Tackle Junkie, Nervous Nellie, and an an Opinion person (maybe two). We used to have a Ghost, but doesn't come with us anymore. We also have our fillet masters, grill master, and fish frying guru!Our group usually takes turns with the chores, and at least with the adults, the work is divided pretty much equally.All of the personalities on our trip our great, and if someone couldn't make it, I would miss them greatly. I think there are a few other personality types that are on trips too . . . Such as:Rip Van Winkle - sleeps all the timeLiquor store - the ones that always have a lot of boozeCribbage Master - always up for a gameStory teller - usually several on a tripAntagonist - the one that stirs the postNegotiator - the one that settles things downNovice - this person is really just along for a good time, not really a fisherman, but love the camaraderie! - They are always fun on a trip!Wise Master - The one that usually looks at the wind, weather pattern, etc. and is the one everyone looks to as the location for the day to try first . . . usually has a good answer too!What others are there?"
6416616,gordy28,2020-03-29 08:16:00,437,These are great - I kind of played with the idea of: The CEO - always has the plan but the expectation is that others are responsible for actioning that plan. For example the CEO will point out that the water jug is getting low and walk by it on his way to the outhouse. His job stopped at pointing it out lol
6417694,andreindy,2020-03-31 17:06:00,308,"In my limited 3 seasons of Canadian experience and 6 person group, I have been able to profile a few additional types or characteristics: ALWAYS SNAGGING HIS JIG GUY: This isn't just the guy that snags (because we all do), but that they always and OFTEN snag their jig at the worst time, like when you finally got the perfect drift, or you have a nice fish on and need their assistance. But the most annoying element of this personality type is the expectation that you take all the time and effort necessary to free up said snag, including repeated back and forth motoring, pulling, popping, using retrievers, etc, regardless of any time or external conditions (3 foot waves or impending doom). LATE TO THE BOAT GUY: This is the guy that can't get himself efficiently organized enough to not have his boat partner waiting 10-15 minutes in the boat every morning while he runs around finding his rain gear, topping off his crawlers or deciding what spoon box he wants to bring. You can't help sometimes loving this guy (more so when he is someone else's partner that day) because he is often thoughtful and grabs something that you yourself forgot. Or an extra bag of beef jerky. This person often knows this about himself and usually becomes the butt of many camp jokes. AFRAID OF BEARS GUY: Who doesn't think of bears when making the late night walk to the outhouse. But this guy has an irrational concern that bears are lurking around most corners and often his brain melds most natural rock formations or stumps into appearing like bears in his mind. You can get a lot of mileage out of teasing this personality. Don't get me going on PICKY EATER GUY."
6417706,Pooch,2020-03-31 17:36:00,4618,"AFRAID OF BEARS GUY: Who doesn't think of bears when making the late night walk to the outhouse. But this guy has an irrational concern that bears are lurking around most corners and often his brain melds most natural rock formations or stumps into appearing like bears in his mind. You can get a lot of mileage out of teasing this personality. Sometimes that guy is right. Years ago the camp dogs woke everyone up with their insistent barking. Not all that unusual, but this night they seemed much more agitated than other nights. So I got out of bed and went to the front porch and just scanned the camp. (Only one small night light on for the entire camp) My eyes went past what looked like the silhouette of one of those cheap colored plastic chairs that are common in camps. Then when scanning back over the camp the ""chair"" had moved about ten foot. I had to stare at it in the moonlight to realize the true source of the dags agitation. It was a black bear about half grown just checking out the camp. Eventually with enough of the camp awake and now shining lights on him he wandered back into the bush. After that we had a couple guys who ""held it"" until daybreak the rest of the trip. Lots of bear stories over the years. Most of them funny, but all serious at the moment. If it were not for all of the different personalities in a group, trips would become boring. Pooch"
6417714,tandm,2020-03-31 17:53:00,679,"I've taken a lot of fishing trips and accompanied one, or more, of every one of the types we have discussed (and cussed), Some multiple times, some one time only. But one thing I learned, early on, was I could ignore him, her, or them, and still have a memorable trip, or I could let their actions, or lack of, ruin a hard-earned trip. End of the day, it has , always, been my trip to do with as I please. With that attitude, I can, truthfully, say I have never had a bad trip. Like the old proverb "" a bad day of fishing versus a good day at work."" Like Pooch says"" If it were not for all the different personalities in a group, trips would become boring."
6417814,prov1900,2020-04-01 02:46:00,544,"Our group used to be very large. It was at a time when only a few of us had boats so to make the trips affordable, we would invite ""enough"" people to make it affordable for all. That was a recipe for failure, but it was never so bad it ruined trips. There were never any fist fights...lol. Now as we've gotten older we've settled in with the same core group of guys that get along great and everyone does their part. The varied personalities are still there, but tolerance has come with age. This too, has been an enjoyable thread. Stay healthy everyone and keep fingers crossed that this will blow over so we can not only get back to Canada, but back to our ""normal"" lives."
6412876,valley366,2020-03-21 19:11:00,193,"Don't know where I fall in your categories as tend to be the planner, communicator and supply purchaser... I want you to classify this guy. How many times do I need to send you the shopping list of supplies intend to purchase and you ask on day 1 where the peanut butter is that was not on any of the supply lists I asked to to verify. Or how many times do I need to remind you to bring your own towels and have you show up with none.I love the guy to death and did 8 annual trips with him but really on year 5 show up with no towels?"
6412890,tandm,2020-03-21 20:10:00,679,"The opinion guy managed to earn us a vehicle search at the border, with just one inappropriate comment. Next trip, he was politely asked, with a few unprintable adjectives, to please not speak. Never a problem after that incident, but the officer who, nonchalantly, unpacked our tightly packed vehicle is , probably, still laughing. Not sure where to classify the member who, when we were doing liquor inventory, volunteered he had a bottle, which is what the driver declared at customs. At camp, he produced 4 bottles. Not a problem, anymore. He's no longer part of the group. Excess liquor consumption took his health."
6414696,Dacotah Eye,2020-03-25 10:50:00,2722,When we returned home from a Canadian trip we uncovered my boat to take our gear out of it. One of the guys went into my battery compartment and brought out a couple of frozen black bear paws that he had stashed there. That got him an azz chewing from me and he was told that he would never going with me again. He had ruined a lot of the trip because he couldn't get along with the rest of us anyway.
6414860,Pooch,2020-03-25 17:15:00,4618,"I would consider contacting a game warden and reporting him. He put you, your boat, your tow vehicle and all concerned in jeopardy. I would be enraged if someone did this to me. I would truly have came uncorked. What a POS. JMO Pooch"

6415114,ogilville,2020-03-26 07:18:00,262,Years ago I went with a few guys on a fishing trip. The guy that invited me and let me know what I needed to bring was the same guy that insisted he could be ready to go with everything he needed in about 15 minutes. It didn't take long to figure out that meant that he forgot several things that he should have brought with him. Not to worry if anyone else had an extra of what he needed they wouldn't mind sharing it all with him. He was the same guy that thought it was funny if he ate up something that could have been shared or didn't hesitate to drink plenty of our beer. He also was the ghost and seemed to have an excuse when came time to cook or do the dishes. We still managed to have a good time and I did go back with the same group the next year. This time we reminded him to bring more of the things he was going to need. Since then he has not been on the trip and it has evolved over the last thirty+ years to me and one buddy making our annual trip. We get along fine and share the work and rarely have any problem.
6415400,Dacotah Eye,2020-03-26 15:56:00,2722,"I had a guy along that thought dishes, cooking, sweeping and vacuuming was woman's work so I asked him if he thought I was his personal b___ch. When we went back inside the cabin he decided to try vacuuming. It didn't appear to harm him. Last trip for him too."
6415692,gordy28,2020-03-27 07:01:00,437,"So many interesting types of people I guess lol We had one guy show up for a camping weekend with nothing but beer, smokes and 3 packs of hotdogs. Our first impression was ""great this guy is going to eat everyone elses stuff"" but turned out that all he needed for 3 days in the bush was beer, smokes and hotdogs!"

6410902,Pooch,2020-03-18 17:46:00,4618,"Comical. Though not totally accurate. ""Ghost"" seem to get overlooked when planning the next trip. ""Tackle Junkie""? There's always one in every group. Good thing about them is that they are constantly rotating rigs and sooner or latter stumble onto a hot setup for that particular moment. You can either learn from them or be entertained. Your choice.""Nervous Nellie"" could be anyone who is the trip organizer and feels an obligation that things go well. Most of our base group used to be ex-military/LE and we were extremely organized. Trips went off like clockwork with no surprises. Then and yes.... then... I was invited to join a group from ""The Cities"". Biggest cluster I've ever seen. I was totally in awe and entertained every moment by their lack of planning and total obliviousness to any type of organization. Turned out to be one of my favorite groups. Every moment was a something I had never even thought could happen moment. Love that group. I learned to make sure that I had what I needed with me ratted away in the truck. Good thing it was a drive to lake. TP??? Who runs out of TP??? Good grief.Good read and brought back some really good memories. After nearly seventy trips over the border I figure nothing will surprise me anymore, but every year something new and usually very funny happens. Memories, memories, memories.Pooch"
6410924,Golden Eagle,2020-03-18 18:21:00,2642,"I don't understand how a guy could make more than a couple of trips and not be able to butcher a walleye, but it happens."
6411306,jackpotjohnny48,2020-03-19 05:08:00,153,"Hey thanks for sharing that blog post. I read it, and got a chuckle out of it.I must confess to being a ""Tackle Junkie"" at times. I showed up last year with 28 rods and 26 different reels for a 9 day trip at an outpost cabin. However, once I get onto a pattern and find what's working, I'm actually pretty good at narrowing things down, and leaving most of my gear back in the cabin. But I do tend to take about 500+ crankbaits with me when I cross the border.I generally only end up using about 15 of those crankbaits throughout the duration of the trip....BUT... (in my defense)… I never know WHICH 15 baits it's going to be until I've had a chance to fish the lake for 2 or 3 days on the trip.For subsequent trips to a lake that I'm more familiar with, I tend to scale back and maybe only take about 450 + crankbaits with me Now as far as other characters are concerned, I think I know 1 or 2 people who may be a combination of ""Nervous Nellie"" and ""The Opinion"" We'll just refer to that guy as ""Opinionated Nervous Nellie""Typically, ""Opinionated Nervous Nellie"" doesn't get along real well with ""Tackle Junkie,"" especially when ""Opinionated Nervous Nellie"" is of the opinion that ""Tackle Junkie"" has brought too much tackle. Because ""Opinionated Nervous Nellie"" is certainly not bashful about sharing his opinion...At least that's been my experience.Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go check out FishUSA. I'm very much looking forward to their next sale on Smithwick Perfect 10 Rogues, because I'd like to pick up another 20 to 30 of them to have custom painted in ""Blue Cisco"" for my next trip to Pipestone Lake.... (just in case it proves to be the hot color, which I suspect that it may).Cheers,""Jackpot"" John Schroeder"
6411324,RichA$1970,2020-03-19 05:55:00,1159,We have an old timer in the crew that would fit the role of Pervert.
6411342,Wally Walleye,2020-03-19 07:01:00,142,We've had the same group of guys going together for the last 30 years.We have those who assume the chef role.Some who make the post meal clean up duties their job.Some who are better at cleaning the catch.As far as tackle issues everything is open to anyone.If some one is short on the hot bait the others if able will make sure every one is covered.We've had some people come and go. The first year is to see if they fit in. If the majority don't feel comfortable they aren't invited back.It's worked for us and now our sons and Grandsons.
6411354,gordy28,2020-03-19 07:30:00,437,Thanks for all the comments and I am glad the post brought out some good memories - part of why I think I have really enjoyed writing is for the same reason As the main planner I can definitely be the Nervous Nellie - I think on our first fly in the guys were ready to throw me out of the plane if I mentioned weight again. I would also consider myself a but of a tackle junkie. My wife always jokes that I have hobby OCD - when I get into something I go pretty hard. Since I have been fishing for some 40 ish years I have accumulated a lot of stuff lol I will also say that our group has a great rhythm in camp as well and we definitely don't have any ghosts. We have two chefs so the rest of us generally do all of the other camp chores as they are prepping dinner. I love seeing the variety of eagles and such that show up when we dump our compostables and fish guts so I like being the bucket boy! My brother is a big guy who fancies himself as a lumberjack so he always seems to be prepping wood for the nights fire and so on.
6411382,Matcaz,2020-03-19 08:42:00,22,"My annual guy trips have been replaced with an semi-annual family trip. This includes my wife, MIL and FIL, and four kids 15 and under. So I have assume the role of Tackle Junkie and Nervous Nellie. Not because that is my personality, but by necessity. I have to provide all the tackle for my family plus some extras for the In-Laws. My wife and her parents are not fisherman, but love camping and the outdoors. So having extra tackle is a must. I do not want to lose our current arrangement of a fishing trip every two years, so I also take on the roll of nervous nellie to make sure the trip goes off without a hitch (as much as can be avoided anyway). My MIL however, she takes on the roll of The Opinion. But I love her just the same. Even though it is just as much my vacation as everyone else's, I try to do as much work as possible so the others can relax and enjoy. Again, I don't want to lose our vacation deal. So I do all cooking with some help mixed in. I clean all the fish, and do at least 50% of the dishes. It is a lot of work for an eight person group, but it is worth it to keep the tradition alive."
