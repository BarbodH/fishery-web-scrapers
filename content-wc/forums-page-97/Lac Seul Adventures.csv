Can also search by lake name which will give all lodges located on or fishing that body of water. Enter Lac Seul in the ""water body"" box and you will see all lodges there with maps of their locations. Looking for a new or different lodge this year? Great place to start."

Maybe when sanity returns to this thread, someone sober will chime in. How many more weeks of covid-19 ?? Sounds like liquor rationing needs to be considered, atleast by some WC members."
