I have been mulling the idea of an Eastern Ontario trip for some of the huge musky that are found there. Can anyone who fishes in the eastern province comment on this? I have thought about going to the Lower French River, Ottawa River, West Arm of Nippissing, and even the 1000 Islands area. One of the things I love about the NW Ontario region is the sheer beauty and lack of pressure. How is the scenery in the places I listed, and how is the boating/fishing pressure? Thanks!"

I don't fish for Musky however Ive boated around this area many times building cottages on different islands. The fishing pressure is much greater than that of northwest Ontario, however there are more bays then you could imagine to get away from others. I would also think come prime musky time, (fall) most cottages would be closed for the year and the only traffic you'd see would be other fisherman."

6425866,elkman99,2020-04-18 09:14:00,180,Anyone know of where to stay on the Ottawa River? Are there any resorts on the water? I can't seem to find anyplace that is in the best musky areas.

One of the top sections of the Ottawa. Also see John Anderson Guide Musky Factory Or if you want 5star with Muskie at the shoreline check out Fairmont Le Chateau Montebello on the Quebec side. Lots of big Muskie spots to cast and troll between those 2 accommodations. GL."
