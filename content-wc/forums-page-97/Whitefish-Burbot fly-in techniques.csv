I've only caught 2 burbot and never caught a whitefish but would love to target them!The lakes in reference are 80' deep max, roughly 8 miles long by 3 miles wide. 14' boat with 9.9"
6423116,Da' Walleye Assassun,2020-04-13 22:10:00,358,I have done well on whitefish using a half ounce Rattletrap in perch color. Target weedline edges and you will also catch northern pike. I use a light six inch wire leader and remove the split ring on the rattletrap and use the snap on the wire leader. Whitefish are strong fighters.

I believe that whitefish prefer cool water temperatures, bordering on cold. Whitefish can be found shallow in the first week or two of the open water season, as the water temperatures are still fairly cool. I commonly catch a few whitefish while targeting walleyes in the very early season, most often where creeks empty into the lake. It seems that the whitefish just mix in with the walleyes from time to time. Thus, I am not suggesting that I put up numbers of whitefish this way, but I do manage to catch a few whitefish on each trip. I will note that these are pretty big whitefish, often in the 4-6 pound range. It doesn't take long for this pattern to break down, as the whitefish head deep when they think the water is about to start warming. I believe that most whitefish spend the majority of the open water season in the main lake basin. This is when good electronics are important. Look for marks on the sonar unit that are fairly deep, often below the thermocline. These whitefish might be suspended fifty feet down in eighty feet of water. I just vertical jig just above them (e.g. with a Swedish Pimple) when I mark them on the sonar unit. Honestly, I don't spend much time doing this as there are other things to do that are more interesting to me. Whitefish can be aggressive when they want to be. But, most of the time they aren't that aggressive - it's more of a cat and mouse kind of game. Think of it as playing with a kitten, rather than playing a power game. I play to the whitefish's curiosity. Detecting the whitefish's bite can be tricky, especially when they are not in an aggressive mood. The mouth of the whitefish is angled downwards, sort of like a sucker. They often lift the bait into their mouth, such that the whitefish's bite is an absence of weight on the line. They are very spirited fighters when hooked! Whitefish are excellent table fare! They are best consumed fresh as they do not freeze well. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6423392,JBaranek,2020-04-14 15:08:00,35,for whitefish use a small slip bobber and micro grub jigs. early morning and late afternoon into the evening you should see them cruising the weedlines. For burbot you will need to be deep. A jig with a minnow on bottom will get them. Bang the jig into the bottom to stir up sediment and it will attract them.
