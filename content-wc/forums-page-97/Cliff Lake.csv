Ran a bit farther on the lake today and tried a different spot.Drilled 4 holes and started catching fish right away till noon.Lots of fish again coming on sonar again.Beautifull day and best day so far with around 25 lakers and some walleye at 50 ft.

6421892,Bill Krejca,2020-04-11 06:37:00,6107,"Wow, that's a bunch of trout, a very remarkable day!! Nice going! Bill"
6421898,prov1800,2020-04-11 06:59:00,5010,Thx guys.yeah was a fun day.Ted is definatly hooked now.Ice will be going soon.Lost some ice and mostly from underneath.weather is really going to warm up next week.In tge 16รง temps.mifht get some days yet but will have to be carefull getting on the ice. Got some areas with current we will try fishing this week from shore.should be good the last couple of days of the walleye season which ends on the 15 th.Then let them do there thing.
6421936,prov1800,2020-04-11 09:04:00,5010,Ron.They didnt take any tubes. I had switched to a road runnet type jig with a small blade.Not sure who makes them.That is what caught the walleye.Ive caught walleye on Cliff before deep like that.They might be adnusting to that depth as they showed no ill effects.No bladders showing in the mouth and eyes whete normall.Bonus fish for the day.They came up toward my bait like a laker.They just dont fight like a laker though.Ugly here today.A lot cooler and real windy again.Got lucky yesterday.
6421982,Eckohlt,2020-04-11 11:54:00,3685,"Gonna be ugly here in southern mn also Sunday afternoon until Monday possible snow storm,thanks john for that 50ft walleye ice fishing lesson I would have never thought,they all taste the same whether 6ft or 50,takecare my friend"
6422264,prov1800,2020-04-12 09:14:00,5010,They tasted just fine.nice treat.tgey are forcasting 30-42 km winds for monday so probably a stay home day. Got lors of stuff to do on the ugly days.Oil changes on my truck and wifes car.Change out winter tires. And my Grizzly needs a oil change to.I enjoy doing that stuff so its not like it becomes a chore.Then boat needs a bit of attention soon.Have been getting summer tackle cleaned up and sharpened a couole hundred jigs and my muskie hooks are sharp and touched some uo with new paint and clear coats. Lide hasnt changed mych except for visiting freinds and a lot fewer trips to store.Gas orices droooed some but not as much as in wpg but really nit going far any ways. Plus i drive a ford ecoboost so easy on gas.haha.
