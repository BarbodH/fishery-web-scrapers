Overall, it was a great trip with great numbers of fish, once the weather cleared up a bit. Our flight in was delayed for 3 or 4 hours due to weather, and the ice cold temps and north winds that greeted us on days 1 and 2 were not exactly what I had spent all winter dreaming about.I had intended to do more pike fishing this year than ever before, but the scads of 10-14 lb. pike that hit our walleye jigs and minnows made casting crankbaits for big pike unnecessary. This was my 17th trip to Larus, and I can say without a doubt that the pike get longer, thicker, and stronger each year. These are not small, bothersome pike, but rather 30-37"" fish that take a long time to subdue on ML rods and 6 lb. Trilene. My biggest pike was over 40"", and weighed over 20 pounds. I had what I estimated to be a 45""+ fish T-bone a 20"" walleye at boatside and thrash about for over a minute.Walleye fishing was great, too, with piles of 20-26"" fish, especially in the inlet rapids. Again, these fish are much heavier than what their body length would indicate--a 25"" walleye is easily a 6 lb. fish. I would say we lost the equivalent of a 1/2 day of fishing over the 6 nights we were there, but that is the peril of a late May trip.We had a bear in camp, which added a little excitement to the trip. No Moose sightings, which is unusual for Larus. The beach cabin we stayed in is a real gem. Hard to believe such plush accommodations exist in fly-in outpost fishing.Can't wait for our Clear Lake trip later this month. It bears repeating that if anyone is looking for a great outpost experience, Dave and Michelle's outpost fishing is as about as good as it gets. I really look forward to reading others' trip reports. Thanks!!"
5590313,lassh,2017-06-05 07:32:00,553,Good report. Thanks for posting.
5590641,RCDuck,2017-06-05 09:18:00,18,"Thanks for the report... I'll be at the Larus Beach Cabin June 15-20... can't wait. I have 5 first timers going this year, which is always fun. You gotta love the T-bone action at the inlet rapids... I had what I estimated to be a 42-45"" pike t-bone a 26 inch pike last year.What do you bring for bait (live/artificial)? I just found out that Angler's Pro Shop has changed hands again and been renamed. I usually bring live minnows for my trip, and a few leaches. Also bring Gulp, but really don't have as fast of action with it. I usually have at least 3 kids with me, so I like it to be easy for them. This year will be 3 dads and 5 daughters... should be interesting and fun. 3 of the girls just graduated from high school, so it's kind of a graduation trip for them/us."
5592529,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2017-06-05 20:07:00,240,"Yes, Angler's Pro Shop has changed ownership. The new owner is a very, very nice guy, and he gave us a good discount on 100 dozen minnows. But, and this is a big but--we landed at Larus Lake without any bait tamers. These were always provided to us without even asking, so I never thought to bring it up. My mistake. We ended putting our minnows into a 10-12 year old homemade wire minnow container, which was tenuous at best. The next day, our pilot dropped off some gear we had arranged to be delivered, and in the rough weather, the plane smashed the bait container, and there went at least 2/3 of our minnows. So make sure you have some bait tamers of your own. I just went to Amazon's site, and ordered two bait tamers, so that I will always have them.Because I had a few pounds of leeches, and because Dave did sent us 40 dozen minnows the next day, we were none the worse for wear, but I won't make that mistake again.Salted minnows are a good, viable alternative, as long as you fish them with a fuzzy grub or powerbait, to bulk up the presentation a bit. The frozen minnows we get from Minnesota Bait and Tackle are effective, but they are very, very small.I hope you have a great trip! I will look forward to hearing how it went."
5592745,RCDuck,2017-06-05 21:35:00,18,"That's very good information... I placed my order with Bite Me Bait & Tackle last week and asked specifically about the bait tamers. The lady I was speaking to said that they do not provide them, but NFO did. I'll need to check with Michelle on that. I honestly can't remember who provided them in the past, but I thought it was Angler's Pro Shop. I hope somebody will provide them, because I have to fly commercially to MSP, so it's not fun to travel with more gear than I have to. I know how disappointing it is to lose a bunch of bait, especially considering the cost. A couple of years ago I made a dumb mistake trying to acclimate the minnows to the lake water. I put the bags in the lake inside the bait tamers, but I opened the top of the bag and didn't release them into the tamer quickly enough, and killed the majority of the minnows.... very frustrating. By the way, do you have any more info regarding the bear in camp? Wouldn't mind seeing one, but I don't want it to be problem either."
5594457,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2017-06-06 16:11:00,240,"Yes, NFO has the bait tamers you need; just remember to ask them to include the tamers on your flight--I assumed they did, and, of course, my mistake. Never assume.Re: the bear in camp--he seems to be splitting time between the beach cabin and the bay cabin. Hasn't been a problem yet. I woke up the other morning, and there he was, right outside the window, sniffing around. He walked around the perimeter of the cabin, then ambled off. Sadly, there is a high probability that he will become a problem, and eventually need to be taken care of. It's only a matter of time before the fire pit becomes a grease pit for leftover fish fry oil, or people start leaving fish carcasses near the fish cleaning station."
6421900,GetTheNet6,2020-04-11 07:01:00,11,"Hi, we are doing a trip to Larus Lake Ontario this year late August into early September. We've been there before as naive fishermen a few years back. My family does a fly in once every year with our dad now. Anyway, Dave from NFO set us up by instructing us to fish the inlet rapids, which was a very nice spot. This time we are looking to explore more of the lake, and would appreciate any guidance or advice ? Any good artificial baits?"
6422140,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2020-04-11 21:52:00,240,"I've been at Larus 17 times total, all in late May/early June. Flat out best fishing of my life for piles and piles of 18-22"" fish. Between 6 guys for 6 days, someone will get a 28-30"" fish, and maybe a few others close to that size. The guys from my hometown who introduced me to Larus say that the number of big fish have definitely declined over the years. Why? Hard to say. Dave and Michelle offer 2 cabins on Larus, so in peak season, there are 18 guys fishing the lake. I learned to get up early to fish the inlet river, for sure. My opinion is that lindy riggers hook a lot of the big fish in the throat, and injure the fish trying to get a 2-cent hook out. What has increased are the numbers of big pike. I can truthfully say that, just using walleye spinning tackle, I have caught a pike at or over 40"" each year, and the scads of 30-37"" pike are just off the charts most years. Hard to say what a person could pull out of that lake if he/she really targeted these big pike. The Larus beach cabin is the nicest outpost cabin I have ever seen, and there are lots of cow moose/calf sightings on the beach right out the front door in the a.m."
6422458,bthomas3333,2020-04-12 15:54:00,465,"Thanks Walleye Guy,That sounds legit. I fished a lake in Caribou PP forever 20+ years. It was also a numbers factory pushing out 16-21 in walleyes. LOTS of 100 fish days. Makes sense it is only about 20 miles from Larus. We would usually pick up one or two bigger fish in the 25-26 inch range. The cabin at Larus look awesome! Looks like a sweet location too.Looks fun.Brett"
6422470,RCDuck,2020-04-12 16:24:00,18,"Michigan walleye guy is spot on.... I've been to Larus probably 15 times in 30 yrs, including yearly trips to the beach cabin in early June for the last 7 years.I can't say much about the late summer timeframe, but 17-21Â”walleyes are abundant. Our group of 8, mostly kids and inexperienced fisherman, usually will catch maybe 3-4 each in the 25-28 range. We usually catch maybe 6 pike in the 37-40 range on walleye gear.Really hoping the covid mess clears up enough to let us make the trip this year.... June 8th."
6422570,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2020-04-12 19:42:00,240,"My group was probably replaced by the party that leaves when you guys get there. Not an exaggeration to say I was devastated when I had to give up our late May/early June slot a few years ago. Trying to get a group of 6 in this day and age gets more problematic each year. If you guys ever need someone to fill out your group, I would do all the fish filleting, cooking and KP duty for the week just to get back to that lake. Dave and Michelle would vouch for me. I'm saying this half tongue in cheek, but I would do just about anything to get back to that walleye paradise. I go to Onepine now, and while it is a very, very good lake, it's not Larus. Hope we can all go on our June trips this year!"
6423148,GetTheNet6,2020-04-14 05:41:00,11,"Thanks for all the input. I'm pretty sure the late August bite will be different for walleye, even at Larus. I'm optimistic though. June trip sounds fun"
6421942,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2020-04-11 09:24:00,240,"UhHi--you are lucky to be going back to Larus. I had to give up our slot in 2018 when 5 or 6 of the regulars decided that they either didn't want to spend the money anymore, or were getting too old, etc. That really crushed me, as I know it is very unlikely I'll ever fish that lake again, given the minimum party size of 6.Anyway, in regard to your questions, keep in mind that I have fished Larus only in the cold weather late May/early June time period. Dave was right about the inlet rapids, the fishing is fast and easy there, although in late August you may need to drift out into deeper water. The only bad thing about the inlet rapids is that if the 4-5 boats from the other cabin decide to crash the party, it gets a little crowded. And that can happen a lot, which is why I would recommend getting up early. Get out there first thing, and have a late breakfast later.One thing I know about Dave is that his maps are spot on. You could spend weeks and not fish all the spots marked on the map. There are some spots marked on the map by the ""moose hunters"" island which are very good, but you need a good portable depth finder and a marker buoy or two to find the spots and stay on them.As far as baits, jigs and minnows, shad raps, bottom bouncers/spinner rigs about covers it. If casting for pike, bring a good 7' medium-action casting rod and a good reel like the Abu Garcia Revo MGX.It is unlikely that you will find leeches that late in the year, and minnows don't last long in warm water. If you do buy minnows, make sure you have a good bait tamer, and sink the bait tamer in the deepest water off the dock. Bring crawlers for sure, but stay away from the 500-count flats. It may cost more, but buy crawlers in the 2-dozen cottage cheese containers, and keep them in a Yeti-type cooler with lots of ice. Of course, that's just my opinion.Before you fly in, have Jon/Dave go over the maps with you and mark his favorite spots for August fishing. I now fish Onepine and Clear with Nestor Falls, and I learn new spots every year by doing this.Let me repeat how lucky you guys are to be fishing Larus. If you ever need an extra body, let me know. Larus is the lake of my dreams, for sure. Good luck!!"
6421984,Eckohlt,2020-04-11 11:56:00,3685,"Larus been on my radar but a little out of my price range,but sounds great for big eyes"
6421994,bthomas3333,2020-04-11 12:33:00,465,"No real talk of the quality of fish other than it is good. The website says 28in walleyes daily which sounds a bit ""optimistic"" but who knows. Can someone who has fished it talk about the quality of walleyes.Brett"
