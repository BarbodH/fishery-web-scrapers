In some areas it does not seem to matter where you drill holes, they are everywhere and some nice size ones too. Ice is going to go fast this year as soon as night time temps approach the +â„ƒ, GET 'EM WHILE YOU CAN!VIDEOhttps://youtu.be/SFQCAfUQ9OU"

It does not seem to have affected the walleye fishing or any other species, if anything the walleye fishing has gotten better in the last few years and I think the slot regulations for walleye on Wabigoon will help that too, time will tell. I'd be more inclined to lower the limit on crappie to preserve what is an amazing fishing experience, but with the absence of data to inform my opinions its just that, an opinion."
