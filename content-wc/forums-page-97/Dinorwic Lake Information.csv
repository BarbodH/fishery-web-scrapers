6270094,fishmanric,2018-12-19 13:14:00,219,"I fished Dinorwic and Wabigoon twice for about two weeks each time. The fishing was awesome. Both have now become crappie factories along with the perch. Walleye fishing was outstanding once you located them. Musky are abundant as well as pike. Smallmouth fishing was out of this world good this year. The sad part were people filleting 20+ inch fish and there were many. I also fished Lac Seul the last two years and yes it's a walleye factory. We caught many 18-23 inch fish, some in the 25 inch range and one over 28. For strict walleye fishing that's where I would go but for unlimited species Dinorwic would be my choice."
6359190,fishmanric,2019-09-18 05:04:00,219,The Lake is now a crappie factory.
6359914,troutwater,2019-09-20 18:39:00,299,"Dang nice crappie. What part of the lake do you find best for them? I was told this summer the pencil reeds heading into Butler was always a good place to hit, but never fished for them. I love Dinorwic, I fish out of Huber's so it's only a short boat ride to either lake. Caught my personal best muskie there a few months ago, and my friend raised a super tanker the next day."
6359940,fishmanric,2019-09-21 05:47:00,219,"Hi troutwater, we catch them early in the reeds, weeds and shallows and late off island drops. We caught three just over fifteen inches this year. We too love the Wabigoon system."
6420258,Mrxlh,2020-04-07 10:48:00,210,"Realize this is an older thread. I fished Wabigoon last year for the first time, we enjoyed it and have 2 trips scheduled back there this year at Bonny Bay Camp. (For reference we have been fishing the Dryden Area for the past 11 years Route Lake Lodge with trips to Lac Seul, Gilbert, Bailey, and Bluett) While the numbers were not Lac Seul numbers, the actual quality of Walleyes were better in my opinion. My best advice is make sure you have a GPS and Lake Map Chip."
1246942,Limeyangler,2010-11-04 19:37:00,563,"I have been watching this post now for a while and thought i'd chime in. I live on Lake Wabigoon, have only been here 4 years but fish at least 4 times a week on average, softwater and hardwater.I have no hidden agendas as has been suggested about previous posted replies, just a real passion about fishing. I enjoy fishing Wabigoon and it is convenient to launch your boat from your back yard or walk down with my auger and drill a couple of holes in the winter.No doubt Wabigoon and Dinorwic are excellent walleye fisheries, but even though i live right on the lake i would fish Lac Seul or a few other local lakes over the Wabigoon chain given the choice and time.I am not a professional fisherman and it blows me away every year when the Walleye masters weigh in with some really nice fish, when the PWT was here (no longer) same story....these pros are pros for a reason. In fact all my 30"" + fish have been from Wabigoon, my PB 32"" Walleye came from shore right off the front of my of lawn, so why would i fish elsewhere given the choice? simple.....there are lakes around where i experience a 'hot bite' almost every time i go, whereas on Wabigoon/Dinorwic i rarely experience this, and when i do the fish are way smaller on average despite having caught some really big fish on the Goon.I am only retelling my experience of Wabigoon and Dinorwic...there are people that do consistently well and are quite rightly very secretive about how they produce 'the goods'....hopefully in time i can figure out this lake....it certainly is challenging and fun trying...but for a non pro and relative new comer to the Lake...despite the amount of time i actually do spend fishing on it...it is a tough nut to crack compared to some other lakes around here where given even my average fishing skills i have been to even for the first time by myself without a guide and hammered fish regularly.Wabigoon in my experience has great fishing, but it can be real tough in my experience, there are lakes around...IN MY OPINION...that are way better. Maybe i would change my tune if and when i figure it out...as without a doubt the lake is full of fish...big ones too.maybe this is not the best thing to say for a town that is struggling, and the camps deserve all the support they can...but they seem to be pretty busy still despite the economy and i dont think my post should deter people from fishing the Goon, this is just my experience of a fantastic fishing Lake...there are in my opinion better lakes.....some well known...some ièm sworn to secrecy about(lol..just kidding...kinda)Hope this dont p*&? anyone off...not my intention...just the the way i see it.Tight lines all"
1247411,elkman99,2010-11-07 08:26:00,180,"I have had reservations for Brown Bay Camp now for the past 2 years, but due to the economy, I haven't been able to go. I am going to try to make it this July however. I will be mainly targeting musky, but with the occassional walleye and perch fishing. Does anyone on here do any musky fishing on Dinorwic? How has your success been?"
1251931,IAranger,2010-11-26 21:00:00,352,I appreciate your honesty
1450265,Guest,2012-06-17 08:50:00,0,"We are going to Pine Sunset in late July and are wondering if there is anything we should know before we make the trip. We have not been to Canada before. Do we need barb-less hooks? What works for bait? We know most people do not want to share their secrets, but any help would be great. Thanks"
1450297,Guest,2012-06-17 10:26:00,0,"On the plus side,my daughter and I caught small walleyes from the dock.We worked the points and managed to catch a small quantity of walleyes dragging the bottom with jigs and minnows.On the negative side, the owners were not real friendly to us.I asked them for a favorite location and they told me the whole lake was good.Second,if you want to catch quality fish you must travel to the other side of the lake.If you have a small boat and you go against the wind,you'll have a white knuckled trip.I did notice that the owners treated repeat customers with open arms.This camp is a fishing camp....if you bring young children THEY will be disappointed.One note: the fish fry was excellent."
1450459,Guest,2012-06-17 20:26:00,0,The owners don't always treat returning customers with respect. Better places to fish and spend hard earned dollars.
1477590,Guest,2012-08-21 16:26:00,0,"Was at Pinesunset Lodge on Dinorwic from August 4 through August 11. Weather was great with mild temperatures cooling at night. Fishing was exceptional. We mostly fished the weed edges in 5 to 12 fow and had great success on walleyes, northern, smallmouth and perch. Lots of fish but no monsters. We had good luck on jigs and minnows early in the week. That got a little boring and we switched to crankbaits which was a whole lot of fun. Silver ratl traps, husky jerks, spinners, and shad immitation baits all worked well. Nothing like catching walleye on crank baits in the middle of the day. Biggest problem was the snake northerns that liked everything that we were throwing. We mostly fished the bays, not the main lake. Couldnt have asked for better conditions. The Pine Sunset Lodge was great and we had a nicer cabin than last time. It looks like they have really updated the resort. New cabins, fish house, and gathering spot for the camp dinner. I would like to give a shout out to Sharon, the owner, for removing a fish hook that got buried in my finger. She used a thin wire and a stick and did the old I will pull it out on the count of three. Then she counts one, and rips it out. It didnt hurt at all. Sharon also put us on some great blueberry spots where we picked bucketfulls. Gotta love fresh blueberrys. I would recommend this place."
1477626,walleyerichard,2012-08-21 18:01:00,23,Going there the end of Sept. Glad to hear it is a nice place.
2930633,fishmanric,2014-06-24 09:01:00,219,"It seems to me that some of the locals are restless about the fishing on Dinorwic and Wabigoon lakes. Over the last eleven years, I have been up to PSL almost thirty times. I have both camped and stayed in cabins and have had nothing but wonderful experiences. My son and friends have all enjoyed this fishery in which I can only recall a few days where fishing was on the tough side. (My son grew up fishing this body of water). It's a river system and the fish are always on the move and it's best if you stay on the move locating them. I'm not even close to being a professional but have had no problem catching fish in this body of water. To many times people are stubborn and won't change techniques or won't ask for advise. New customers get a lake tour along with fishing information, plus the owners are always scouting. These lakes total around 55,000 acres of water and that in itself can be a challenge but also was one of my determining factors in picking a place to stay. I guess what I'm trying to say, is that there is enough water for everyone to fish and all the lodge owners on this body of water seem to be first rate and affordable. When times were tough while going through a divorce, because of price, I was still able to visit Canada the beautiful and all it's friendly people. Catching fish was a bonus."
2931505,Simple Man,2014-06-24 12:40:00,92,"I have no skin in the game reference the posts here, but I will offer that our group made a trip to Dinorwic and stayed at BBC. We only fished it for a few days but it quickly became one of my favorite lakes. Likewise, BBC is one of the best camps I have ever stayed at....we will be back and when we go we will be at BBC again! In terms of fishing, we mainly target Musky, but found Walleye fishing to be great as well. BIG northerns to be had there as well. Absolutely love this lake!"
1243503,Lambertson Rock Guy,2010-10-19 13:53:00,20,"Looking to book with a lodge on Dinorwic Lake next year in late June. What can I expect as far as fishing? Probably will spend about 40% of our time on the water chasing walleyes, 40% northerns, and 20% muskie. I have fished Lac Seul and Lake of the Woods and have had some tough days, good days, and great days as far as catching goes. Just looking to try a new area and would like to hear from someone who frequents the lake. Thanks in advance."
1243548,Skywagon,2010-10-19 17:53:00,1106,"I fish Dinorwic some, but there are better places to go for walleye, I do not fish for northern or musky. There are a few days that it is all right, but compared to Lac Suel or many other lakes in the area, day in and day out, for me there is no comparison. The fishing has declined for reasons I can only speculate on. I can say that the lake is heavily fished through the ice near the spawning area in spring and it is legally netted by the natives all year, including through the ice. Draw your own conclusions. Also, look in the archives for threads on this subject. I wish I could give a glowing report, as it is a more convenient lake for me to fish. Here is some interesting information I ran across on the Pine Sunset Lodge owners, thought I would pass it on for those interested. This was reported on the MNR site. http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business...OD_067249.html April 26, 2010Pair Fined $5,000 For Illegal Hunting And Fishing LicencesTwo Wisconsin residents have been fined a total of $5,000 for illegally possessing Ontario hunting and fishing licences.Mitchell and Sharon Gusick of Pound, Wisconsin, pleaded guilty to having void Ontario Outdoors Cards and making false statements on their applications.Court heard that the Gusicks purchased a tourist camp in the Dryden area in 2000. They were allowed entry into Ontario on a work permit for the camp; however, they do not meet residency requirements defined by the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act.In 2006, conservation officers found Mitch Gusick with an Ontario resident hunting licence and warned him to correct it, as he was not an Ontario resident. In December 2007, Sharon Gusick was found to have upgraded her Outdoors fishing card to an Ontario resident hunting card. In November 2008, conservation officers again caught Mitch Gusick with an Ontario resident Outdoors Card.On November 10, 2008, the Gusicks were advised they did not meet the requirements of Ontario residency for hunting and fishing in Ontario. They were also advised that an investigation in Ontario was underway with the assistance of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources to determine their residency status. Less than three weeks later, both Gusicks renewed their Ontario Outdoors Cards online, claiming resident status.Justice of the Peace Edith Baas heard the case in the Ontario Court of Justice, Dryden, on April 20, 2010.For the purposes of obtaining an Ontario resident hunting and fishing licence, a resident is a person whose primary residence is Ontario, and who has resided in Ontario for a period of six consecutive months during the previous 12 months"
1243953,Skywagon,2010-10-21 15:22:00,1106,"Lambertson Rock Guy, not sure if you got my PM, if not, sent one again to me with your e-mail and I will respond."
1244552,Babamel2,2010-10-25 07:11:00,414,"I have been fishing Dinorwic for a number of years and have noticed the average size of the Pike has been getting smaller, however we are cattching more walleyes that years ago. As SKywagon says, there are many lakes that are more productive, however compared to the options I have in Indiana I Dinorwic beats them by a long way. This past year we did get several pike over 36 in, Also, a few years ago I got a 30 in Walleye. I have been staying at Brown Bay and have appreciated the camp. THe owners keep it well organized and keep the clientele top notch by limiting the ""drunks"" It has been great to go to a well run camp and know the people and the lake. feel free to leave me a message."
1245055,Lambertson Rock Guy,2010-10-27 07:12:00,20,Thanks for the information. Anyone else fish Dinorwic and willing to share their thoughts on the fishing?
1245230,Guest,2010-10-27 19:33:00,0,"I live in the area as well. I regularly fish both Dinorwic and Wabigoon. I have fished Lac Suel and fishing is good, but realisticly I don't know why I would want to pound my boat all the way up there when I can go out any day and catch all of the walleye that I want, lots of nice eaters as well I regularly catch eyes in the mid to high 20's as well as a few over 30. Both lakes are second to none for pike and musky! I am sure that you would be more than happy fishing there. I suppose if I lived right on Dinorwic I may post negative information about it to, to prevent people from fishing in my favorite spots.."
1245309,Skywagon,2010-10-28 07:58:00,1106,"Hey ""Gatorslayer"", I like your new handle. Business a little slow now? The obvious answer, (since Lambertson Rock Guy is a seasoned fisherman and has fished Lake of the Woods and Lac Seul), is if he decides to fish Dinorwic next summer, maybe after returning home from the trip, he would be willing to share his experience with us and compare catches with the other lakes he has fished. I would second Babamels suggestion on Brownbay Camp, the owner is a nice person and quite a baker."
1245461,Guest,2010-10-28 19:27:00,0,"Yes Skywagon that would be good! Actualy business is good this year without the mill being shut down in Dryden things have been better. But I don't know what that has to do with fishing? I am sure if you keep posting negative comments like that you will have the lake to your self like you would prefer. That would be fine with me to, although it doesn't really bother me to share the fish in any lake. Have a great winter!"
1246605,Fishsniffer,2010-11-03 12:38:00,1,"Gatorslayer has a good point. Skywagon must have his own agenda regarding Dinorwic Lake. You asked about Dinorwic Lake and not about where else to go. Look at it this way If the Pro's (PWT) chose Wabigoon/Dinorwic System for it's Walleye tournaments over any other lake in Ontario that should speak for itself. Whether you stay in a motel or at a camp I do recommend hiring a guide for a day or two but be careful. You'd be surprised at how many guides off the street say they know the lake but really do not. I got burned by one before I went threw a camp. There are only two camps on the lake and it shouldn't matter which one you chose but they should have guides you can trust and ask about a free lake tour. Pine Sunset Lodge has a well-marked lake map with GPS coordinates for hazards that I have not found anywhere else. Navionics could use this. A lot of your experience with fishing hot-spots, presentation and especially hazards should not cost you any extra and who should know best then the camp owner. That should be their job. The people at PSL make it their job. I am not advocating going threw a camp but when learning a lake for the first time it my be a smart idea. With all that said I have fished Dinorwic for many years and enjoy the lake immensely. With only two camps it does not have the pressure as many other lakes and you have the option of all five species. Walleye, perch, small mouth, northern and muskie plus a bonus with access to lake trout. We have been there in good and bad weather and there was always something biting. There are many small lakes attached which makes for a lot of fun and the feel of being remote.Good fishing to you."
1246645,Golden Eagle,2010-11-03 15:19:00,2642,Skywagon is my friend and I am positive he would not mislead you about a fishing lake. Dinorwic is probably a decent fishery that is close to some super great fishing opportunities. Some can be driven to and others can be reached on Skywagon's Cessna with floats. Shoot him a PM and he'll give you the straight on Dinorwic. It could be just the lake to bring you all the happiness and success you expect.
