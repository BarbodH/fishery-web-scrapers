6420772,Guest,2020-04-08 14:13:00,0,In my minds eye I can see & hear the water lapping against the shoreline in Gods country.
6420776,prov1800,2020-04-08 14:15:00,5010,"Its finally starting to look like spring.Lots of ice yet.plenty of cool nights and below 0c.so not a lot of melting overnight and takes a long time to start melting in daytime.Forcast is also for cooler temps and freezing over night.But it will be like normal ice out around may 6-7.i hope,season or no season looking forward to sitting back in my boat."
