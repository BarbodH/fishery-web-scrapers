6425356,spoonchucker,2020-04-17 08:55:00,82,It is great reading- did so when first came out. But dated as to references to Miminiska but makes you want to hit that Albany River Area.....

6426176,jackpotjohnny48,2020-04-18 19:35:00,153,"Yeah, I bought the book last fall, and read about the first 100 pages so far (I'm about halfway through it). I most purchased it because I found it for $4, and I also have fished Pipestone Lake for the past couple years (and have another trip to Pipestone booked for this summer), so I wanted to see what he had to say regarding Pipe. Based on the parts that I've read so far, it's easy to see how Babe was influenced by Buck Perry's ideas, as a lot of the info seems striking similar to a lot of the Fishing Facts magazines that I remember reading as a kid in the early to mid 1980s. You can definitely tell (by reading this book from 1983) just how much the technology has changed in the past 37 years. And I think some of the theories and techniques have changed quite a bit since this book was first written. For example, I recently watched an episode where Babe was fishing walleyes on Dogtooth Lake, by trolling deep running crankbaits in 80+ feet of water for suspended walleyes. (This would not be a technique he would have used much, or written about, back in 1983). So, it kind of felt like getting in a time machine and reliving my childhood reading all the Fishing Facts magazines. But overall, I have found it to be enjoyable, and for $4, I figured I couldn't beat the price. ""Jackpot"" John Schroeder"
