ONce they have moved out, I believe that dead minnows will outfish Gulp or any plastics. That was my experience in eastern Manitoba. I also have fished Elbow lake in the NW."

6421566,GBS,2020-04-10 11:21:00,2271,"Wow, my very own zombie post! I was the original poster! So, the trip was to ""Grassy River Lodge"". Sort of near Flin Flon, if anything up there is near anything. Guide supplied for each day Mostly Northern fishing. My biggest was 52"". Yep, 52""! Several a day in the mid-40's. Too many to count in the 30's. We only really fished for walleye about 1/2 hr before shore lunch. Wife decided to throw raps at a walleye spot, the guide insisted that was no good. She proved him wrong in about 3 minutes. We used salted minnows. In one spot, I reeled up and notice my bait move! Turned out the dead minnow had gotten off, but I had caught (in the mouth!) a 3-4"" native minnow of some kind- sharp spines on the fins. Lodge did a one day fly out to a remote lake. There I learned a bit more how to feel for a fish on the jig. Most of the time I didn't feel them, but the guide would prompt ""set the hook"", all from watching the slight movement of the rod tip. Probably caught near 50 that day. A few years later, went with ""the boys"" on a fly-in to Fletcher Lake Resort. Live minnows allowed there. By day 3 they had pretty much all died. Spent the day at the mouth of a river. Layed out a handful of dead minnows on the bench next to me. Jig was about 7 ft. down from the rod tip. Put a minnow on, lower it in, pull up a walleye, flip it off the jig, repeat. And repeat. And repeat. No reeling needed. Caught well over 100 in about 3 hrs. Ran out of minnows, so switched to Gulp the next 2 days. Worked just as well. So now, yes, I am a bit better at jigging. Not great, but I have a little bit of a clue."

Sounds like the really wacky color ones might actually stand a chance of catching a fish! Wonder how a circle hook works with the barb mashed down?[/QUOTE] yes bring a good assortment of spinners, jigs, spoons and some plugs and you should be good for everything the lake has to offer. I usually just clip two of the three trebles off the hook and pinch the barb and you should be fine."
6424724,pike50plus,2020-04-15 17:35:00,584,"I usually just use regular berkley power bait, not gulp. Early season youmay just be better searching with Not nTots and minnow bait also. IMHO"
575562,GBS,2008-06-28 13:14:00,2271,"First ever Canadian fishing trip. Just got off the phone with the resort in Manitoba that we will be going to in a few weeks. They said that all live bait is banned, and I would have to use jigs and frozen minnows (which they sell, of course). Can anyone fill me in on this ban? Province wide, because we will be fishing in a Provincial park? Or...??? Is this all live bait, or just minnows? More to the point - use frozen minnows for walleyes, Mimic Minnows, or Gulp Alive?"
575567,Dore,2008-06-28 16:47:00,43,Here is a link to the Manatoba fishing regshttp://www.gov.mb.ca/waterstewardshi...on/08guide.pdf
575574,GBS,2008-06-29 06:28:00,2271,"Thanks for the link! I had navigated close - but not close enough. Yep, no live bait in the region I am going to. I'll jump over to the fishing forum to ask the ""how to"" questions...."
575575,GBS,2008-06-29 06:49:00,2271,"Though better of jumping forums - this is a Canadian fishing question, so may be more to the point here. So, on to the questions: First Canadian trip coming up (Manitoba), and I see the regs are as noted in the subject, for the region I'm going to. I'm a bit inexperienced in the walleye game, grew up primarily doing the trout thing. Have only ever caught three fish so far on a jig - non-walleye at that! Most of my walleye have been on spinners or bobbers with minnows, crawlers, and leeches. Part of the reason for the trip was to learn better how to jig - guess I get the advanced course! So, the questions: Mimic Minnows, Gulp Alive, or twister tail style? Frozen minnows are allowed. Should I plan on using as an enhancement, or skip the plastic? Any opinions for using dead instead of fake, or vice versa? Any recommendations for quantities to take of plastics - 5 days fishing, 2 people. I've heard leeches aren't so great as bait in Canada - true? Should I consider also packing some Gulp Alive leeches anyway? I assume barbless (ie - squashed barbs) is the same as in trout - never, ever give them any slack after a hookset. Any other tips?"
575576,AMPHIB206,2008-06-29 07:01:00,191,"What region are you going to? I'm a Manitoban that trolls this board. If you are going on a fly out, you need not be concerned as much as to the presentation of bait. Fishing for walleye and pike on a remote lake is very easy on the ego. Bring a few jigheads 1/4-3/8 in white, orange, chartreuse; you can't go wrong. A few L'il Joe spinners in the same colors. Twister tails, Gulp, will work good. Have a contest to see if frozen bait outfishes soft plastics. Most people back troll; it's effective and you get to see some beautiful shoreline with a great chance at seeing wildlife. Because you are fishing in a boreal forest and the Canadian Shield, other than it's beauty, you'll get a few snags while trolling. Bring a good rain suit, and some insect repellent with as much DEET as you can find."
575578,manitobawalleye,2008-06-29 07:57:00,885,"where are you going? manitoba .... a 100,000 lakes how many walleyes ???? i will never have enough time...."
575582,Bill Krejca,2008-06-29 08:44:00,6107,"I've noticed little, if any, lost fish due to pinched down barbs. Just keep tight line, and you'll be alright. It is very easy when switching baits to forget to pinch the barb, sometimes before you know it, you are fishing a barbed hook, trust me on this one. One nice advantage is the fish will usually become unhooked after netting, so it saves a little work there. I'd take some plastic leeches, Berkely or others."
575616,Guest,2008-06-29 21:18:00,0,We salted our own minnows this year and just killed the walleye on them in Canada. One gallon would be more than plenty for three guys for a week. Good luck.
575628,Riceburner,2008-06-30 11:51:00,436,"Little trick that helps on the barbless hooks--- You will keep the salted or preserved bait on the hook better if you slide the bait on the hook (assuming you are lip hooking), and secondly, add a small piece of plastic tail or pork rind on next on the hook. Another note--the barb needs to be pinched on the lure in the water--not all the lures in the tackle box. Have fun...."
575655,GBS,2008-06-30 21:16:00,2271,"Going to the Northwest area - Reed Lake, Grass River Lodge. Special regs - only 2 walleye. I'm not heartbroken - that's good enough for shore lunch. The focus of the resort is on big pike, but the walleye are there too, along with lake trout. Plus, day trip fly-out to other lakes, if desired. Back trolling you say? I can bring along my 29 kazillion spinners I use at Kabetogama each spring. Sounds like the really wacky color ones might actually stand a chance of catching a fish! Wonder how a circle hook works with the barb mashed down?"
