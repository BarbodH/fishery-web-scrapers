6536840,prov1800,2021-03-11 14:53:00,5010,It sure is.This vaccination deal in Canada is like the worst in the world.Unreal how our Gov screwed that up
6536842,prov1800,2021-03-11 15:03:00,5010,few pics
6536850,Eckohlt,2021-03-11 15:33:00,3685,"By the looks of your hands you need more than the vaccine,those must be some meen fish john,dandy eaters my friend.So it's been about a year now since I was there hitting my head on that dam door frame"
6536854,prov1800,2021-03-11 15:47:00,5010,I was thinking the same thing Rod.Wish you and Ron were here now for round 2.Mornings are great and evenings to.Havnt gone in afternoon for a while.never touched a free minnow today.Walleye on the menu from yesterdays catch.
6536878,Eckohlt,2021-03-11 16:36:00,3685,"Lucky minnows they get to live another day,looks like fun to me"
6536938,prov1800,2021-03-11 18:52:00,5010,Great time.Fun catching them on the vibrato.Its a totally diff strike.They just smash it.The pike and muskies have been hard on my supply of them but Clarks brought them into the bait shop so if i run low Wayne brings some back for me.I know you would live some of this action.
6533332,prov1800,2021-03-02 15:32:00,5010,"deided to head to Clarks at Edward Lake this morning.Havnt been there since last week.Got there at 8 am and saw fish right away on my sonar.Had instant action and it was that way for a solid hour then it slowed down.Should of been there at 7 am.Walleyes today all averaged bigger and had tough time trying to get my 13-14""eaters so had to settle for 17"".Threw a few 20""ers back.Got into a few pike to but they didnt get my favourite lure.Melting here today what a switch in weather."
6533374,7 Mag,2021-03-02 17:03:00,1887,You know itâ€™s a good fishing day when you have to sort fish to get enough eaters. Looks like you had a fun day John.
6533382,prov1800,2021-03-02 17:14:00,5010,Iam not complaing.lol.

6533404,Eckohlt,2021-03-02 18:18:00,3685,"John you caught more in an hour than rob and I in 4 days,you sure your putting a gill net down the hole hahaha"
6533422,prov1800,2021-03-02 19:17:00,5010,When you guys came it was like last week.There were guys at camp on weekend and heard it was real slow.They disappear sometimes.But like when you guys left it turned back on.Caught every fish today on a hard bait to.
6533424,prov1800,2021-03-02 19:18:00,5010,Ill try to keep them coming.
6533550,Bill Krejca,2021-03-03 07:35:00,6107,Love it! Bill
6533556,prov1800,2021-03-03 07:46:00,5010,Love it to Bill.Weather seems to be on the up swing here so more outings coming.Today headed to Cliff Lake and try for some trout and hopefully the whitefish will be there to.
6536828,prov1800,2021-03-11 14:41:00,5010,"So just want to let everyone know that besides all the problems in the world the fishing is absolutly fantastic.Only problem i can see is that there are to many fish in the lakes and something has to be done about that before it becomes a bigger problem.Iam trying my best but can only keep 4 till i eat them.Last 2 days over at clarks shacks ive caught over a 100 walleyes in maybe 5 hours of fishing.Yesterday i tried out a new muskie/pike lure[Bondy Wabbler] and caught a nice pike on it.This time i had a steel leader on and that did the trick instead of loosing lures.Border wil open when Canadians get vaccinated which is going at a snails pace.Nothing else will matter,just ge tus done.Al lof US could be vaccinated and if we are not no border opening its that simple.To much talk not enough action."
