6538670,prov1800,2021-03-15 16:21:00,5010,"whow,iamshocked you said that.Are your crawlers better than ours.I hear most crawlers in states come from canada."
6538702,Wallychowder,2021-03-15 17:37:00,1567,"no not better, but we have always just bought them from the neighborhood kids that go out and get them......and they even put them in bedding !"
6535204,Wallychowder,2021-03-07 07:15:00,1567,Reminds me of the Dolly Parton song.....Coat of many colors.
6535238,kzoofisher,2021-03-07 08:38:00,5144,"Off topic but... Benjamin Harrison was the 23rd President (1889-1893) and grandson of the 9th President William Henry Harrison (1841). William Ruffin Tyler is the grandson of John Tyler, the 10th President (1841-1845) and is living in Virgina. His grandpa was president 180 years ago!"
6535290,Eckohlt,2021-03-07 10:33:00,3685,"Zoo you must be a history teacher,wonder who made the first jig ever used?"
6535298,kzoofisher,2021-03-07 11:41:00,5144,"Oh, man, it's a fascinating subject. Maybe I'll start a thread on it. Briefly, and noting that there's plenty of argument, the earliest hooks date back 40,000 years, lures made of bones and bronze 4000 years, earliest mention of fishing with a fly is 1900 years ago. The Brits claim they invented metal lures 500 years ago because, they're Brits. Who first put some weight on a hook? I'll have to look into that."
6535314,Eckohlt,2021-03-07 12:31:00,3685,"Zoo your on the ball man,I think I have some of those hooks made of bones there kinda dull though, now that you mention 40,000 years ago I don't suppose they were catching walleyes"
6535316,Eckohlt,2021-03-07 12:35:00,3685,You should go on jeopardy you could make a million or 2
6536006,Bill Krejca,2021-03-09 08:11:00,6107,"Re: who used first jig - I have no idea, but going to more recent fishing history, my observation/opinion is the first use of what we normally refer to as jigs were commonly used in salt water for a number of years, before their use in fresh water. Jigs for fresh water, according to my observation/experience, started to be commonly used in the late 1950's, usage expanding to their presently high fresh water usage. Use of salt water techniques in many types of rigs has evolved, and like will continue, into general fresh water acceptance. Bill"
6536070,Eckohlt,2021-03-09 10:35:00,3685,Thanks for the info bill and to you also kzoo
6536960,GreatWhiteNorth517,2021-03-11 19:30:00,286,"I don't understand all these folks buying crawlers in dirt. Ask for a ""Canadian flat "". In legal bedding ready for border. Sheesh!"
6537044,Pooch,2021-03-11 23:52:00,4618,"Seems I remember jigs (close to what we know them today) as being in survival packs issued to the military in either WWI or WWII? Does that ring a bell with anyone else? As to ""who"" invented them, I've no idea, but they have been around in one form or another for a long time.When I was a kid, I remember pinching a split shot onto a long shanked hook and catching suckers in our creek using manure (Red) worms or raw bacon strips for bait.Pooch"
6535056,Eckohlt,2021-03-06 17:17:00,3685,Crawlers are a good buy in Ontario not out of whack price at all
6535064,Wallychowder,2021-03-06 17:29:00,1567,yes !
6535068,NARDA 1,2021-03-06 17:49:00,636,What do you normally pay for a flat of crawlers?
6535092,Pooch,2021-03-06 18:49:00,4618,I think a lot of the crawlers come from Canada. If so they accumulate a lot of miles before they meet their maker. Pooch
6535100,kzoofisher,2021-03-06 19:49:00,5144,Pretty reasonable.
6535116,KC Walleye,2021-03-06 20:56:00,274,Lol. Wow
6535142,Guest,2021-03-07 03:28:00,0,We just talked to the customs and dnr in fort francis. They stated that each person could bring 120 dead or saolted minnows into ontario. They asked that we make the packagese easy to view the salted minnows. 120 each fisherman not 129 each fisherman
6535166,Wallychowder,2021-03-07 05:58:00,1567,You haul all your groceries up there from home ? Why not buy them all up there ???????

6534900,Eckohlt,2021-03-06 04:54:00,3685,Where did you read no salted minnows allowed?
6534906,h8go4s,2021-03-06 06:15:00,1673,"Here's a quote from the Ontario fishing guide:""It is illegal to bring any crayfish, salamanders, live fish or leeches into Ontario for use as bait.""Frozen minnows are not ""live"". I didn't see anything about nightcrawlers; maybe I missed it. It has always been my understanding that crawlers were ok if packed in bedding, not dirt. Check it out yourself.You can read it yourself here:https://files.ontario.ca/books/mnrf-fishing-regulations-summary-2021-en-2020-12-10_0.pdfIncidentally, Canada is a pretty big country. The above applies only to Ontario."
6534928,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2021-03-06 07:47:00,240,"""resident and non-resident anglers alike are prohibited from taking minnows and leeches (live or dead) between bait management zones."" I believe this means you will not be able to bring dead (salted) minnows into Canada, in the first place. ""non-resident anglers are advised to purchase their minnows and leeches from a licensed baitshop, as close as possible to the area where they will be fishing, and to keep a receipt on hand to show proof-of-purchase location."""
6534932,prov1800,2021-03-06 08:06:00,5010,Great rule.If trying to keep invasive species out of our waterways iam all for it.Allready have smelt in our waters and they are causing lots of problems with Lake Trout in those lakes they got into.Why not just buy bait from the area your going to fish.
6534938,NARDA 1,2021-03-06 08:24:00,636,"This was taken from the page I posted earlier https://www.ontario.ca/page/fishing-live-bait Can I dump my bait bucket into the lake? It's illegal to empty your bait bucket, drain the water or release live baitfish into a lake, river or other waters. Instead, you must: drain your bucket onshore (30 metres from the water) freeze the excess minnows for another day catch your own bait from the lake you fish in So, does this mean you cannot hang your floating bait bucket over the side while you are fishing? Does it also stop you from using the bait well on your boat, because you would be pumping water from your bait well into the lake?"
6534942,prov1800,2021-03-06 08:38:00,5010,Narda if you buy bait from the camp your at you can hang your bait bucket over the side or bait well can be used if your bait comes from that zone.Most minnows boughthave been trapped in that zone to begin with.Bringing bait from other areas is not recommended especially from states.My bait comes from Clarkes and that bait is used from Red Lake to Eagle and All the to northern fly out resorts.One other thing i might mention since i fish all over the place is that you can not leave your catch in your live as you travell.So fish need to be put in cooler with ice and drain your live tank even ifyou would normally dump water in your own yard or well away from he lake that is a no no.I was stopped a couple of years ago and was reminded by a CO.No ticket just a warning.
6534954,Wallychowder,2021-03-06 09:02:00,1567,What if i buy minnows at Bite me bait and tackle in Nestorfalls and head on up the road to lets say White Fish bay ? Can i hang my bucket over the boat ?
6534974,NARDA 1,2021-03-06 10:17:00,636,"Thanks for clarifying, John. We buy our bait at the lodge."
6535016,Wallychowder,2021-03-06 14:39:00,1567,I'll say this.....Canada ever does ban crawlers crossing the border that'll be it for our group !
6535048,v-bay gord,2021-03-06 16:35:00,3168,I was thinking the last time I bought a flat of crawlers it was about $70 Cdn. Is that so far out of line pricewise that you would cancel a trip over it?
6534794,Wallychowder,2021-03-05 16:19:00,1567,So whats new ? We haven't been able to take minnows or leeches into canada for years !!!! I dont really give a rat finky about FROZEN shiners ! All i care about is crawlers.

6534870,drlee,2021-03-05 19:42:00,409,"I really find this to be less than interesting. Sorry. I have always bought crawlers, leeches, and minnows (rarely minnows) in Canada. When I look at what I spend on a Canadian fishing trip, and when I consider the short season Canadian lodges, bait shops, grocery stores, gas stations, etc. deal with, I have NO problem buying Canadian. I do use credit cards to pay attention to the exchange rate. I live in Wisconsin and feel the same way about what I spend in tourist heavy sites in my home state. They ain't getting rich, folks."
6534882,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2021-03-05 21:30:00,240,"Sounds like this new rule will affect Canadian fishermen more than U.S. anglers. Basically, Ontario will be or is divided into four 'zones.' Neither residents nor non-residents can transport minnows or leeches between zones. Does not say anything about crawlers. We are advised to purchase bait from a licensed baitshop, as close as possible to the area we will be fishing. All anglers need to keep a receipt on hand to show proof-of-purchase location. The proof of purchase is valid for two weeks. But bringing salted minnows across the border will be a thing of the past, according to this summary. Again, there is nothing about crawlers, just leeches and minnows."
6534896,tv4fish,2021-03-06 04:15:00,2694,"Our group also primarily uses crawlers. And, of course, you cannot bring crawlers into Canada if they are in dirt - has to be Buss bedding, or similar. SOOOO - I go into Fleet Farm to buy some nice, fat crawlers............. Guess what, they ARE packaged in dirt. And, right on the package it says something very similar ""Product of Canada , or prepacked in Canadian dirt.........................."
6534898,7 Mag,2021-03-06 04:37:00,1887,"Yes I've noticed that as well, Canadian crawlers packaged in dirt but you can't take them into Canada. Hmm!"

""To address the spread of aquatic invasive species and disease, non-resident anglers cannot bring minnows or leeches into Canada"". is the lead sentence. usually in-fisherman is a pretty reliable source...."
