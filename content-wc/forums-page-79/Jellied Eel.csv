Just the pie and mash? Yes. Leave off the liquor. Eel fishing on the east coast is a big money game. The eels spawn in the Sargasso Sea then live in fresh water water for a while as elvers which is when they're most valuable. European and Japanese stocks collapsed and the price went through the roof resulting in some very unscrupulous behavior and at least one murder. It's much more regulated now. A single night's fishing can gross $30,000.And then, in March 2011, a massive earthquake hit Japan near Tokyo, and the tsunami it caused wiped out huge stockpiles of eels being cultivated in aquaculture operations. Over that year and the next two, elver prices were way up, skyrocketing from $185 per pound in 2010 to $1,868 on average in 2012, with a spike up to $2,600 near the end of the season.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAecgK1Xr1I"

So I guess fisherman (mostly from the Netherlands) fish for freshwater eels in the Thames river in England and sell them to restaurants. The eels get chopped up, boiled and it releases collogan and then they cool it down to make a clear jelly with eel chunks inside. It's served cold. I remember a friend of mine caught an eel pout on Eagle lake some time ago. Can't imagine eating it. Anyone ever have it?"
6537124,Eckohlt,2021-03-12 07:38:00,3685,I think I'd be sitting next to a restroom when I tried that jelly eel
6537170,Huntindave,2021-03-12 09:06:00,2194,"I think I will someone, anyone else try it and report back. I'll take their word for it."
6537186,tweedrules,2021-03-12 09:21:00,107,I live in NY and fish the Delaware river near Bethel (the woodstock site). There is a family there the Case family who sets up an eel trap there. They sell the eels they catch for BIG money. They ship in dry ice all the way to Japan. It's big business.
6537188,BrianinVA,2021-03-12 09:23:00,160,It's said to taste like pickled herring but with a less fishy taste. Freshwater eel (unagi) is delicious in sushi and donburi so I'd totally be down for trying it jellied.
6537314,andersaki,2021-03-12 12:57:00,1426,"Man, that sounds good. Next time I cook up a batch of lutefisk, I'll serve jellied eel as an appetizer. Lol Mark"
6537320,Husker525,2021-03-12 13:04:00,720,I think I just threw up in my mouth a little. Hard Pass!!!
6537354,andersaki,2021-03-12 15:24:00,1426,"Seriously, eelpout, AKA ling, lawyerfish, burbot or freshwater cod as my great uncle called them is every bit as good as walleye. The backstraps and tail meat is the best. Mark"
6537562,pjshorthorn,2021-03-13 06:12:00,5654,There has been a rumor floating around for years that VBay Gord was a prolific Eelpout guide on Eagle Lake in his heyday. He probably has some great eelpout receipes. PjShorthorn
6537564,RichA$1970,2021-03-13 06:21:00,1159,I used to see it a lot in China at the breakfast buffets in the hotels. Tried it once but preferred smoked salmon over it.
