6540480,Skywagon,2021-03-19 09:18:00,1106,"True! With the high mercury levels coming down the Wabigoon river from Dryden, most people don't fish, or at least don't eat the fish from those waters."
6540554,Eckohlt,2021-03-19 11:30:00,3685,"Right on,and also if you fished it I think you would need a tackle shop right by the bridge"
6540622,prov1800,2021-03-19 14:06:00,5010,ive guided and fished there for years.We have always eaten fish from there.I know the guys that own cabins and they eat them all time.The mercury was from a long time ago and is covered up byknow.All the guests at North Star eat them.Doesnt seem to bother anyone.Fishing there is second to none for all species.
6540628,prov1800,2021-03-19 14:13:00,5010,I fish here just before season closes.Fantastic bite from shore
6540660,Eckohlt,2021-03-19 14:52:00,3685,"John if you get the go pro figured out shoot a video of shore fishing there,do you use slip bobbers there?"

6540672,jambi,2021-03-19 15:10:00,504,Those falls are awesome. I always stop if I have an FNG on the trip. (FNG = effen new guy). I tell him our flyout lake has similar falls that we'll be navigating.
6540688,Skywagon,2021-03-19 16:23:00,1106,"But John, think of all the tax payer dollars that have been spend and will be spent to appease those (that we can't speak of) that say differently. I will admit to once having eaten a giant ling from down river, it tasted good cooked up as poor mans lobster, with the side benefit that since I now have ingested all of that mercury, I have the element needed to make my own thermometer."
6540694,prov1800,2021-03-19 16:36:00,5010,Them ling are ugly and i hate touching them vut your right they are good eating.I also read that mercury is one of the ingredients they put in the vaccine so maybe you wont even need a shot.Äºol.

6540208,pjshorthorn,2021-03-18 17:48:00,5654,I love that spot. It is a beauty of a falls for sure. PjShorthorn
6540216,prov1800,2021-03-18 17:58:00,5010,PJ did that vid go through
6540220,pjshorthorn,2021-03-18 18:10:00,5654,I couldn't open the vid. I just know the spot you are posting about. PjShorthorn
6540238,Eckohlt,2021-03-18 18:33:00,3685,"I bet below that falls is one snag infested rats nest,full of logs"
6540270,Stringbean,2021-03-18 19:44:00,279,Are you fishing the south side of the bridge at the bottom of the falls? Or are fishing the tailwaters on the north side of the bridge?
6540348,Eckohlt,2021-03-19 05:51:00,3685,"I really don't think anyone is fishing either side,but don't quote me on that"
6540350,pjshorthorn,2021-03-19 06:00:00,5654,"[QUOTE=Eckohlt;6540348]I really don't think anyone is fishing either side,but don't quote me on that[/QUOTE I would agree. The only chance may be around the pool below the falls during high water. The falls are all rocks and log jams. PjShorthorn"
