6535996,Bill Krejca,2021-03-09 07:55:00,6107,"To add a little history to the oar/paddle discussion, it used to be very common for a guide to sit at the back of a boat and use a paddle to slowly move a boat along shore line casting spots. The ability to provide a means of allowing a client to hit all the pockets was a thing of beauty to watch. Boats were smaller then, easier to maneuver, and people were not in as big of a hurry. The reason oars were not used was due to the fact that guides were required to have their eyes on the client(s) at all times, so that pretty much ruled out using oars. Rental boats at the time referenced, however, normally came with both oars and a paddle. How times change! Anyone who has used both a paddle and oars to move a boat understands that a paddle makes a poor means of moving a boat for any long distance. Since my boat is large enough that trying to fit oars to it would be impracticable, I do carry two (2) long paddles which can suffice, slowly, for a time, with a paddler at each paddle. To address the original post, it would be a great idea to provide oars on any fly-in camp boat. Bill"
6536002,maddogg,2021-03-09 08:09:00,178,"I should have clarified there were connecting lakes,not just one."
6536050,Huntindave,2021-03-09 10:07:00,2194,"I'll bite, why would that rule out using oars? Last time I used a set of oars, I was taking my girlfriend out for a nice quiet boat ride. You can bet your last dollar I had my eyes on her the whole time. Never needed to look at the oars hardly at all. As I remember it, even the guide I had in Michigan a few years ago ,used oars while he watched me cast."
6536058,NM_Trout,2021-03-09 10:17:00,1094,"Yeah, the boats I am used to are fairly small, and the oarlock sockets are far enough to the stern that I use them from the back bench seat. I have to reach for them a bit, but it is very do-able. The forward moving stroke is actually a push instead of a pull, so it isn't an efficient way to cover a lot of ground, but typically we are creeping / drifting with the wind along the shore, and I just need a way to rotate the boat, and make minor adjustments. My eyes are on the fisherman the whole time. I've done this since I was a kid about 45 years ago, and maybe it is just second nature at this point.BTW, I did some quick looking around, and did not find any telescoping oars. Only telescoping paddles. I did find a two piece aluminum oar that looked likely.However, I need to figure out a way to buy them in Canada, or in International Falls, as flying with them on an airline might prove to be a challenge :-) I'd likely leave them in camp, or stashed in the woods and hope that porcupines don't eat the rubber caps off the handles. LoL."
6536110,Bill Krejca,2021-03-09 11:47:00,6107,"Fair question. Normally, in less hectic times, the front of the boat was considered the prime spot, the caster trying to hit his spots ahead of the boat before the boat got too close. Normally in the earlier1900's boats of the north woods, most boats just rowed better by the rower facing backwards, just easier to move. Pulling is easier than pushing for most folks. With the boats designed for trout float fishing, the boat design is such that forward facing, especially on streams can be manageable. As to further why, hafta ask one of the guide pioneers, except none are left. 'Jis explaining my observations and what I had been told, many moons ago. A man would be just plain crazy to place his girl friend where he couldn't see her, so I can relate very well to the passenger placement logic! Bill"
6536280,kzoofisher,2021-03-10 03:52:00,5144,"I think most river boat designs have the rower facing forward. The current is doing 99% of the work and the rowers job is to avoid obstacles and control speed. We always think of any fish caught as a shared success, if the rower can't put you in a position to make good casts you aren't going to get much. Maybe a good analogy would be trolling and the guy driving the boat can't keep a straight line for 50' and varies his speed from .8-3mph. Rowing a small boat is a very pleasant way to help someone new work a shoreline and learn. It kinda sucks if you want to fish too."
6536642,Bill Krejca,2021-03-11 08:14:00,6107,"Yet one more on the rowing routine - Back when I was a kid, casting, working the shore line was the way to fish. To overcome the rowing ""disadvantage"", all took their turns rowing - each one hour and the rower pulled a bobber and minnow on a fly rod. It used to be very common while casting to have walleye followers and I think some of the rower's fish came this way - sorta like predator calling, maybe. Sometimes the rower got the most fish. Bill"
6535664,Wawajake,2021-03-08 12:10:00,413,"My previous boat , a 14 ft alum with 9 hp merc, I outfitted with a pair of oars for the exact reason the original poster wants them at fishing resorts. I also thought them far more useful to get boat back across lake when the motor broke down. My new boat a much larger vessel, I included the required by law one paddle. But lets be honest, no way that will propel you anywhere in emergency, although it makes for a good flag to get other people's attention to rescue you. &#x1f642;"
6535666,Wallychowder,2021-03-08 12:21:00,1567,One problem with that scenario ? You might not see another boat on some of the Canadian lakes ! So a flag will be a nogo.......start paddling !
6535672,Wawajake,2021-03-08 12:23:00,413,Plenty of us Canadians still on my area lakes. Boat sales went thru the roof last summer.
6535680,pjshorthorn,2021-03-08 12:43:00,5654,"I guess you better hope you never need to make the choice between a set of oars or a paddle. In your case, I'm not sure it would make a difference on which one you chose. PjShorthorn"
6535720,Wallychowder,2021-03-08 13:50:00,1567,Maybe i'll take both....... &#x1f914;
6535760,Pooch,2021-03-08 16:26:00,4618,"In the early 1990's I met a guy and his wife using one paddle working his way back to camp as we left for a day on the lake. He had been paddling all night and just getting back to camp about seven in the morning. Motor quit the evening before. He was tired, very sore and very out of sorts. We pulled him the rest of the way in. I'm sure he would much rather have had a set of oars and not a single paddle meant for a canoe. Just saying. Pooch"
6535766,NM_Trout,2021-03-08 16:45:00,1094,"Mike Borger (I think) has a write up about his time his motor broke down on him and he had to use a single canoe paddle to get back to camp, and I think it took him most of the day. I've often thought that I should stash a boat midway on the lake somewhere when I am out on an outpost trip, just in case. I think I'll look into those expandable oars too."
6535770,NM_Trout,2021-03-08 16:50:00,1094,"Oh... and BTW, I do carry a SPOT transmitter with me with the lodge owner on the contact list. If I get broken down more than a mile because his motor let me down, I'll likely be pushing that button to have him come and get me :-)"
6535776,Wallychowder,2021-03-08 17:07:00,1567,Maybe a guy ought to take along a transom mount trolling motor and 12 volt battery if renting a camp boat for the week..........just saying.
6535792,maddogg,2021-03-08 17:38:00,178,Don't tell my outfitter but when I flew in with just my wife I would put another outboard in the boat as a spare. Sometimes we would be 20 miles from camp and I figure my wife wouldn't be very happy if we had to paddle back with 1 paddle.
6535460,NM_Trout,2021-03-07 21:49:00,1094,"Just thinking about how I miss having oars on the boat at the outposts.I like to maneuver with the motor off, while my daughter fly casts around the rocks and weeds for pike. Using a paddle is a pain. Do any outfitters provide oars for the boats? I've thought about just buying a pair and donating them to the camp."
6535490,kettyspanky,2021-03-08 04:24:00,271,I have 2 in my boat that came from fleet farm I believe. It's one that telescopes in and out. It's like 2 foot long when telescoped in and like 4 foot long when it's all the way out. Very compact and works very well. It's something you could take with you on your trip. Just a suggestion.
6535538,Bill Krejca,2021-03-08 07:25:00,6107,"For those who have never fished with a person at the oars, it is easy to not understand the degree of absolute control one has over the boat. I would go so far as to label it the ultimate in finesse fishing. As I was raised using oars as ""manual spotlock"", I, too, recognize the advantages of oars, which on most fly-in size boats, would be ideal for superior maneuvering. Bill"
6535542,maddogg,2021-03-08 07:31:00,178,"All outposts I've been to have always had a canoe paddle in the boat. It would make more sense to have oars,in case you had motor problems."
6535550,Wallychowder,2021-03-08 07:48:00,1567,I believe its a law that rental boats must have at least one (1) oar ?
6535622,Wawajake,2021-03-08 11:03:00,413,Sadly it looks like a few here don't know the difference between an oar and a paddle. &#x1f642;
6535632,Wallychowder,2021-03-08 11:19:00,1567,"Paddle , oar ...who cares , they'll both get you to where you wanna go.......&#x1f92d;"
6535640,Huntindave,2021-03-08 11:32:00,2194,"NO,,,,,,,,,, if you ever compared the two forms of propulsion when used in the typical 14 ft camp boat, there is no way in heck that you would say ""who cares""."
6535642,Wallychowder,2021-03-08 11:43:00,1567,Oh geez are we going to debate this now ? Hey in an emergency give me one or the other.....i dont really care ! All I'm saying is I'm pretty sure a rental boat no matter where it is ! Needs a oar or oars or a paddle (and i dont mean a paddle fish)
6535644,emma17,2021-03-08 11:44:00,436,"It's understandable how some may think it's splitting hairs w semantics. As I grew up using a row boat I became very accustomed to two oars that had a metal ring around them with a metal peg. One oar's peg is inserted in metal receiver on starboard side and one on port side. Face backwards and pull the oars in same direction for forward propulsion, then use them opposite directions for precision. A paddle is basically the thing you use in a canoe. It is also used as emergency propulsion if the motor doesn't function AND if you do not have oars. I like oars too, but they take up space."
