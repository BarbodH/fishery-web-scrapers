6534520,prov1800,2021-03-05 08:02:00,5010,Headed out on Eagle Yesterday morning from Vermilion Bay.Attempted to go catch a Big lake trout.Fished a couple of hours and saw lots of fish on sonar.Nothing would bite until a bit later.Instead of lake trout in 50 ft of water it was walleye.So quite fishing there in case i caught slot fish.First walleye that came up was toast but a 17 incher so got lucky there.Besides that had a awesome morning taking in the beautifull veiw around.Nice weather and no one else out.
