6538492,Eckohlt,2021-03-15 11:46:00,3685,Your cousin probably became your best friend
6538674,97roughneck,2021-03-15 16:23:00,899,Can't win if you don't play. So no.
6538732,Bigtaproot,2021-03-15 18:35:00,900,I married my second cousin and we are still happy after 41 years and 8 kids
6538832,gbin,2021-03-15 21:31:00,1384,"I enjoy gambling, but lotteries are sucker bets - not for me! If other people want to waste their money on such then that's their business; I just wish there were separate cashiers/lines at convenience stores so lottery ticket buyers didn't hold up everyone else.Gerry"
6539054,SullyToad,2021-03-16 12:16:00,5,I've never won more than $25
6539160,Mojo-NC,2021-03-16 15:40:00,1929,"To me lottery tickets are good stocking stuffers and presents for the ""I don't know what else to get them"" people. There's always that chance of picking a winner - somebody has to win right?"
6537558,pjshorthorn,2021-03-13 06:05:00,5654,"Just curious....what caused the stress in yoir career ? I don't know the ins and outs of the lottery business, but I guess it is no different than a large corporation which can have stress related to jobs. Been there done that in Corporate America for a long time myself. It can take a toll on a person after awhile. PjShorthorn"
6537568,RichA$1970,2021-03-13 06:25:00,1159,"Don’t play it but I bought a fake scratch off and gave it to my buddy and a real one for my son and me. He won $5,000 on it and it was an awkward response from him on how’d we split it. Then he goes back into the gas station and the hillbilly in there said it was an Indiana ticket n my buddy argues with her that I just bought it 5 minutes ago. Finally after further review the 2 rocket scientists figured it out and it was hilarious."
6537582,Beagle_Nut,2021-03-13 06:52:00,52,I was an actuary and we referred to the lottery as the stupidity tax. Yes some people win but overall you'd have a better chance at a million bucks by looking under rocks in your yard.
6537588,Ltrain,2021-03-13 07:17:00,4145,"Not a scratch off but came close to hitting the big lottery 3xFirst-( it was my parents) was when the lotto was first starting out in Chicago, we hit 5 of 6 numbers for the 6 mil jackpot. It paid 900 bucks. Second- I had a quick pick for around a 40 mil jackpot, two lines. I had all six numbers on the one ticket but first three on first line second 3 on second line. Of course that paid zero . Oh if it was only the other way around. Third time and this one stung- about 10 years ago my work crew( 7 guys) goes in on about a 250 mil jackpot. We get 5 of the 6 and the last one was number 23 and we had 21. So close to all of us retiring early! We split 10k , no early retirement but put a little in the pocket and shared some what if stories with the fellas if that 21 would have popped. Oh well, maybe someday"
6537592,Mojo-NC,2021-03-13 07:37:00,1929,"In my college days, one week I was down to my last $2. I bought a lottery scratch-off ticket and won $20. I went out and had a few beers with my buddies. Ahhhh, the good old days..."
6537616,Wawajake,2021-03-13 08:45:00,413,"My first ten years was when scratch tickets were live money, and I was Distribution Supervisor for all of Northern Ontario and my staff of 6 couriers that were basically driving Brinks trucks covering everywhere from Red Lake in west to Mattawa in North East. and my high security warehouses. Then Barcoding science made them just pieces of paper until activated. Last 16 yrs I was a Senior Buyer with high value contracts. My biggest RFP contract I did was worth 40 million. So yes a stressful but the coworkers on my teams were great."
6537650,grizzley,2021-03-13 10:03:00,2518,"I also saw this referral to lotteries![QUOTE] "" the most efficient voluntary tax on the poor that anyone could have possibly come up with""We also have PA SKILL gambling machines all over the place, a lot of people who play them really can not afford to play them, but they do!"
6537748,Eckohlt,2021-03-13 13:46:00,3685,"You are right I looked under the rocks in my yard and there it was million bucks,I would never have found it without your tip,whooooo hoooooo"
6537952,Larry S,2021-03-14 08:01:00,665,"In 1986 I missed 6 Million$$$$ by ONE number in Regular Lotto, Won $ 3,000. Have seldom played the scratch off tickets"
6538474,MN_Moose,2021-03-15 10:47:00,964,"not me, but my cousin won $25million in the early lottery. just had the last of his 25 annual payments."
6537374,Bigtaproot,2021-03-12 16:04:00,900,Have any of you guys ever won anything in a lottery scratch off
6537402,Wallychowder,2021-03-12 16:31:00,1567,yes
6537404,Wawajake,2021-03-12 16:32:00,413,"Yes I did, I won a pension after working for Ontario Lottery for 26 yrs. &#x1f642;"
6537422,grizzley,2021-03-12 17:10:00,2518,"^^^^^^^^^^^ Now there's the smart one! ^^^^^^^^^^Keep scratching, you will eventually win, every one I know who scratches lottery tickets has won something. I personally know 2 people that won 1 million on PA scratch off tickets, one of them was sold in our town and there is a rumor going around right now that another million dollar winner was just sold in our town."
6537428,Wallychowder,2021-03-12 17:27:00,1567,If i were you I'd start scratching !
6537472,Eckohlt,2021-03-12 18:59:00,3685,He's probably scratching his head
6537476,brad34,2021-03-12 19:03:00,892,I've won $5 a couple of times. I guess that counts...
6537498,grizzley,2021-03-12 20:11:00,2518,"Yea, but I also knew a guy who scratched those $30 scratch offs in bunches and didn't win much at all, he was a donator like most others!"
6537506,Bigtaproot,2021-03-12 20:22:00,900,Lucky man. I was always looking for a govie job that was no stress and had a good pension.
6537554,Wawajake,2021-03-13 05:38:00,413,Unfortunately tons of stress in that job just like any business job these days.
