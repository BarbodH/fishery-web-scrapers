I enjoy reading about all the happenings and thoughts around here ...well most of them....and hopefully we can get all these tourist camps up and running again and get the ""good times"" rolling around here again. Last fall were the lowest water levels I've ever experienced and made for some sketchy navigation around the waterways.Sorry folks,but I'm hoping for a very wet season in these parts this year..and I'm talking monsoons....water levels are way too low for my liking and the forest turns into a tinder box really quick.If you make it out this way make sure you pack some good raingear and look for the guy on the shoreline out front of a cabin wearing a ""Where's the Beef"" speedoo...doing a jig..that will be me doing my raindance...stop in for a chat."

6541626,Esoxmike,2021-03-22 03:59:00,114,and this has what to do with a wolf encounter%?

6538842,Laketripper,2021-03-15 23:05:00,103,"Spot on about securing the food sources better.She installed the gray well over 10 years ago and that was first time any animal bothered with it. The previous property owner had the drain line dumping straight into lake.The bear was tagged in the ear, meaning that it had been relocated because it was being a nuisance somewhere,now I guess the bear is her problem. As for the wolf,I figure it got off pretty easy...I'm pretty sure a kick to the ""familly jewels"" would have been her next move...assuming the wolf was a male. Gotta love those northern Ontario gals."
6538846,Juls,2021-03-16 00:31:00,13414,"Yeah, that was cute...."

6539430,Laketripper,2021-03-17 10:41:00,103,"Let's ""belly up to the bar"" folks I have another story to tell. Bring your kleenex ...this one's a little sappy.The ""anti-American folks"" mindset is alive and well in NW Ontario.As btthomas3333 says, it is a lifelong predjudice based on family values that are passed on.Now, they come by it honestly because of the ""raping and pillaging of the land"" and the money that went ""home in suitcases"" with older generational American tourist camp operator.Not all of them but alot of them.If you don't believe that it's time to get your head out of the loon$hit.Talk to any old-timer Canadian tourist camp owner,if there are any remaining ,and they will educate you on the reasons for this stigma. Last fall a group of us were at a buddies tourist camp(Canadian) helping him level cabins.One of the guys there was also a tourist camp owner(American).Lots of banter going back and forth about how we could solve the world's problems.Of course American issues arose and my American friend became quiet and distant.I looked him in the eye and said ""there are the same type of a$$holes in Canada as there are in the States,just seems like more so in the States because of it's population"". He looked me back in the eye and said ""Thank You"".( pass the tissue now and another whiskey) Now what I learned from that day seeing that young American busting his back helping out a fellow camp owner,not just this one day,these guys are bartering their skills back and forth to help get through the troubled times, is that there is a new generation of American tourist camp owners that have a different mind-set about the tourist industry in NW Ont. Not just with this one fellow here but alot of the other""new generation ""American camp owners I've come across. My brain is not wired for that type of thinking, but the boys over on the ""Interesting"" post ...not sure if that's the right post...v-baygord,wawajake,and obabikon...seem to be hashing out some constructive solutions...good example of bartering skills between camps. I will stick to leveling cabins and other camp maintenance but I don't understand why it's being done over an open forum like this.Far too many interruptions for the task at hand.Why not just e-mail each other with your input ...that way the interruptions can go to junk-mail...sight unseen."
6539464,Eckohlt,2021-03-17 11:44:00,3685,"Let's talk fishing,did you do any fishing in 2020 and if so how was it?"
6539506,Laketripper,2021-03-17 12:41:00,103,I got out fishing a bit...busy with cabin maintenance mostly...that's why people rent I guess. When I did get out always managed to bring supper home.I target only walleye....if I'm gonna spend time fishing I feel much better if I can at least bring dinner home . Seemed to be lots of smaller ones 5 and 6 inch or so...but where the small ones are there's always some big boys hanging around.
6539592,Eckohlt,2021-03-17 14:30:00,3685,Thanks
6538520,Laketripper,2021-03-15 12:38:00,103,"A ladyfriend of mine was outside her cabin last fall(remoteish,off grid,Northwest Ont.)stacking up some firewood when a wolf sauntered out of the bush and walked right up to her.She shoode it away with her arms and told it to go away as if it were a stray dog.The wolf looked at her like she was nuts,sniffed the air and continued on towards the front of the cabin.She promptly went around to enter her cabin from the rear to get her camera and there was a black bear licking away at the gray well it had dug up. The bear spooked and bolted for the bush.The wolf then sauntered over to the graywell and spent 20 minutes or so finishing the bears lunch.Bear never came back and the wolf eventually left the same direction as the bear. Just happened to be a rotting carcass of a woodchuck under the wood pile which probably was what the wolf initially sniffed out.Somebody suggested that the wolf possibly was kicked out of the pack for bad behaviour(not agreeing with the leader of the pack perhaps) It wasn't a big wolf , young still. Initially thought it was possibly a coyote but pictures prove it to be a wolf. Are there any animal experts here that can weigh in on this wolf behaviour."

6538620,Juls,2021-03-15 15:19:00,13414,Neat story....I don't know what a greywell is....what is that?
6538626,Wallychowder,2021-03-15 15:22:00,1567,All i could find is that its a village in England ?
6538642,Wallychowder,2021-03-15 15:41:00,1567,I think a greywell is kinda like a henway !
6538672,GBS,2021-03-15 16:21:00,2271,See the following:
6538698,Juls,2021-03-15 17:32:00,13414,"LOL...okay, what's a ""henway""?"
6538714,Eyecatcher23,2021-03-15 18:05:00,383,About three pounds.
6538754,kzoofisher,2021-03-15 19:07:00,5144,A gray well is a pit that gray water runs to and seeps into the ground. Gray water comes from faucets sinks and showers. Black water is sewage. Probably some tasty bacon fat in the gray well. Cool story but I'd seriously consider securing food sources better if both bear and wolf are being attracted.
6538768,Bigtaproot,2021-03-15 19:47:00,900,My suggestion is switch to old spice from brut. Cheap cologne attracts animals
