Yesterday my new Out Door card arrived. My fishing license type was printed on the back. I've not called the MNR, but it might be that the Out Door card also now doubles as a fishing license? Anyone have an actual insight into this? Pooch"
6534952,KC Walleye,2021-03-06 08:50:00,274,"You are correct Pooch. If you buy an outdoors card and 3 year license at the same time, it will come printed on the back and thus serves as your required license documentation. Makes it easy. You must be hopeful for the border to open, I wish I held your optimism. After getting my refund for last year I decided to wait on buying new 3 yr license and outdoors card until clarity is given. Hopefully you get to use it this year!"

6535090,Pooch,2021-03-06 18:47:00,4618,I tend to be of an optimist. Life just seems better that way. Some folks are always looking at the dark side of everything. I'd rather be looking up than down all the time. Too early in the year to to be calling the border either way. I wonder if the odds makers in Vegas have a pool going on the border?!?! Pooch
6535188,eyecatcher1,2021-03-07 06:51:00,323,I renewed mine in 2019 and got the same thing. I sure hope the border opens so I can use it two of the three years that I paid for.
6535250,kzoofisher,2021-03-07 08:46:00,5144,"Same when I renewed mine in '18. Haven't renewed mine yet and hope others do the same; loss of revenue for the gov't gets their attention and maybe, just maybe, they'll accelerate their efforts to reopen which will help outfitters too."
