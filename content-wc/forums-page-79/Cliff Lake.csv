6539738,Eckohlt,2021-03-17 19:14:00,3685,"If they smell good you didn't get them from the guys,cause you know where most wallets are kept lol"
6539740,Eckohlt,2021-03-17 19:16:00,3685,I won't be able to sleep tonight wondering how big that envelope is
6539786,prov1800,2021-03-17 20:27:00,5010,i keep it in my gun case.its pretty thick.was going to use it in states for a trip to wyoming .yellowstone plus a mule deer hunt.kinda in the same boat you guys are in trying to go south.lol.so might cash it in and go to yukon .wife retireing this summer.take off for a month or so.yes iam bringing fishing gear
6539846,Eckohlt,2021-03-18 05:02:00,3685,"Yukon sounds like a great idea,do you drive there or fly?"
6539880,prov1800,2021-03-18 06:17:00,5010,we are planning to drive to Jasper and hang out there a while and if we feel like driving further we will.Its a long drive.
6540044,Eckohlt,2021-03-18 12:07:00,3685,"Not a lot of roads in the Yukon,looks like some wild country.Probably need a few spare tires,might be hard to find a holiday inn lol,where is jasper john??"
6540050,prov1800,2021-03-18 12:19:00,5010,the yukon/Alaska hwy is a very good one and you go through quite a few towns.Tires i wont worry about my spare should do the trick.Its actually real touristy.Lotsof attractions.Thinking a slide in camper strong enough so a bear cant get in lol.
6538460,prov1800,2021-03-15 10:28:00,5010,Got out Saturday on Cliff Lake.Nice day butn very windy at 40 km winds.But warm enough at +6c.Rode a ways on lake to a good spot but had to be carefull on the glare ice as you had no control and didnt leave any tracks to be followed.Drilled 6 holes but we each only fished one and had plenty of action so no need to try other holes.Picked some snow to drill in so we wouldnt kill ourselves walking on the ice.We got 20 trout up and a few bass to in 45 ft.Fished from 9-12 so had a enjoyable day.
6538464,Eckohlt,2021-03-15 10:35:00,3685,"Put some boards up we could have a heckuva hockey game on that ice,john you can be the ref"
6538476,prov1800,2021-03-15 10:51:00,5010,For sure.Was hard to turn and couldn't let of throttle to fast as engine brake kicked on.lol.That put you into a spin.Ive screwed self taping screws into my lugs before which really helps but havnt done it yet.Just took it easy went about 5 miles.Great looking weather this week so planning to go back and a day on Cedar for crappies.
6538490,Eckohlt,2021-03-15 11:45:00,3685,"At least someone is letting the fish know,that not everyone is locked out,good luck on the crappies"
6538656,prov1800,2021-03-15 16:07:00,5010,will see where i get to.It doesnt really matter.Few more weeks of ice for sure.Depends on weather which is looking pretty warm.Just nice to get out.
6538776,Golden Eagle,2021-03-15 19:50:00,2642,First time I've seen that stretch of highway since October 2019. I like it.

6539676,prov1800,2021-03-17 17:41:00,5010,"Got out with my buddy Ken again.He pulled a night shift but met me at 8:30 this morning.Had another great bite.Got another 20 lakers and some bass and whitefish.Cool morning and windy but not hard to take catching fish.They were a lot shallower today.Started by our old holes but we worked back toward drop off and ended up catching them around 40 ft.Few bass again and whitefish.Not a bad outing for 3 hours.Ice is at 20 "" so still will be able to get out.Miss having my ice fishing guests up as iam sure there missing being up here.So tired of all this."
6539692,Eckohlt,2021-03-17 18:12:00,3685,I thought that guy in the lower right was me but I looked closer and said nope it ain't me
