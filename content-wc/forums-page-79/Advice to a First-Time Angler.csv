6535364,BigBadBucky2,2021-03-07 17:01:00,4,"I think a lot of good selections such as getting a lake map, getting a depth finder or upgrade boat, and getting some advice about trip planning from people who have gone or sites like this. I think my one thought on advice that I don't hear often is to fish a style or tactic you are comfortable and familiar with. When I first went to Canada I heard all kinds of talks about trolling methods, trolling baits, crawler harness rigs, drop sinkers, bottom walkers, etc.. Where I fish, trolling is illegal. I only jig fish or occasionally cast structure. So I studied up on all the new techniques, bought all kinds of new gear, only to get there and discover the style of fishing I knew and was comfortable (vertical jigging) works great and have never used that other gear I bought (TBH I also have about every color of jig under the sun, but usually only use white with a red and black eye.) I'm not saying don't be afraid to take advice and try new things. However, maybe start out using a technique you are comfortable with and at least your presentation will likely be correct. If that doesn't work after a day of trying different spots and depths and structure, then maybe consider trying something new or different that you have never tried."
6535626,Wawajake,2021-03-08 11:09:00,413,Just curious....I have to ask where is trolling illegal in Canada ?
6535740,emma17,2021-03-08 15:44:00,436,"I'm guessing the poster was saying trolling is/was illegal where he fished in the US (thus, it wasn't a method he had gear for). I know Vilas County in N WI didn't allow trolling until just a few years ago- that's why my boat didn't have trolling gear."
6514222,prov1800,2021-01-05 15:02:00,5010,"Just enjoy your time.Dont try to become a pro right away.Just do the basics and try diff spots,you will find places and have fun."
6514352,emma17,2021-01-05 20:31:00,436,"It's funny, the original poster asked for the ONE most important piece of information, ala City Slickers, yet many people have posted lists. I think fishermen tend to follow a set of protocols they establish over time- so every protocol seems equally important. I'll approach the question with my son in law in mind. He's never fished and I really want him to love it. My ONE piece of information would be this: I'd have him stand on a porch and hold a jigging rod - I'd sit on the ground, hold the jig and try to mimic that awesome feeling of a walleye nibbling at the bait."

6516068,PA troutguy,2021-01-11 16:59:00,58,"Do your research if going alone and pick a quality lodge that fits your needs and target species. I know this is heresy but I target pike, musky and bass. The previous comment listen to the lodge owner is accurate they want you to be successful for any number of reasons, pay attention and ask questions. I have graduated from newbie using lodge boat and American plan for a week to my own boat, staying in a cabin cooking and fishing the same lake 2 week stretches for a few years now. I have yet to reach the far end of it 12 miles away, lots of fish in between. Don't be afraid to explore and SAFETY first. Enjoy the experience for the cow and calf moose to the wolverine sightings."
6521300,LoDo,2021-01-28 09:33:00,721,If you are the captain of the boat remember the boat and motor is priority #1. Often times a newbie will pay far more attention of the fish on the line than where the boat is on the lake. I've seen too many times where the boat ends up crashing into rocks due to captain paying more attention to the fish on the line.
6522632,Rock Hound,2021-02-01 11:57:00,51,"OK, to give just one answer, it would be to bring quality rain gear. Don't skimp on this item! Hopefully you don't need it, but you cannot control the weather, and if you get a few bad days, quality rain gear can make the difference between a good or bad week on the water!"
6527430,NM_Trout,2021-02-14 19:09:00,1094,"LoL...this ^ I scrolled all the way through this to find what my ONE bit of advice would be, and there it was :**** Buy the best rain gear you can afford... top and bottom. You can make do with a $50 rod, but once weather turns bad, you will wish you had some serious goretex or better. I've been on trips before where it rained every day, almost all day. Sometimes blowing too. Without good gear we would have been absolutely miserable instead of just a bit annoyed.*****OK, since I can't resist chiming in on the rest, I am commencing full ""dad"" mode advice : 2) Bring good bug gear : Mosquito nets for beds, good repellent, ""smoke"" coils.3) Don't overdo the basic toiletries. Small portions. Bring good sunscreen. Do overdo the first aid kit. Include superglue as part of wound care, and be ready for both diarrhea as well as constipation. Get your doc to prescribe an antibiotic. Allergy meds and sudafed, burn and bite ointment, basic pain meds. 4) Bring a journal, and use it every day to record, when, how, how many, weather, rambling thoughts, whatever. You will learn to love that thing. You will love it more in the winter time when you are stuck at home and spending time with a beer remembering the awesomeness of those trips. 5) You really don't need all those lures. Swap treble hooks out for barbless single hooks. (The first time a pike thrashes and buries a 1/0 treble hook with barbs into your hand you will know why) Favorite lures : Chartreuse plastic behind 3/8 oz jig. Rapala Jerk bait. Large spoon in classic DareDevil red/white, and spoon with yellow / red. 6) Don't count on your phone to work as a gps. Splurge. Know how to navigate. Always set a home waypoint before you head out that first time.7) Out of all the gear I have used the least, my depth finder is probably it. 8) Get a small water purifier, such as a sawyer mini. 9) Bring ear plugs :-)10) Bring a small rod repair kit with extra eyes.11) Don't forget a kindle or at least a good book. 11) Keep an emergency bag in the boat with a firestarter, some dry clothes, a flashlight and some minimalist first aid stuff. 12) Don't feel like you have to fish all week. Spend some time looking up as well as down. Sit on the bank. Take extra time for a shore lunch. 13) Get up really, really early at least one day and watch the sun come up over the lake. 14) You don't need bait. 15) You I almost always bring too many clothes. I've gotten better at this. But do bring an extra few pairs of socks to change into when done for the day. (wash your feet first for extra luxury, lol). If you have lightweight, small packable slippers, bring them. Don't forget a wide brimmed hat and a buff to keep the sun off. 16) Nobody makes a cast unless everybody is wearing eye protection of some sort.17) When travelling with a group, use the Kitty system. Everybody throws X hundred $ into an envelope, and all shared expenses comes out of that. Everybody pays into it if more is needed. 18) Beer / Alcohol / Pop / Tobacco are not shared expenses.19) Late in the trip, it's easy to get grumpy. Avoid this in yourself, and forgive it in others. Nothing like a blow up to completely ruin a trip. Get some time away by yourself if there is a means to accommodate it.20) Be gentle on the fish and the resources. You are going to catch way more fish than you can take. Do your best to put them back only slightly worse for wear. 21) Never make a list that has two #11's. :-)"
6527966,brdd,2021-02-15 23:15:00,1,"I have had an Ontario license for 41 years, most years a season license. If I had to give one piece of advice to someone who wants to begin this activity of fishing trips to Ontario, I would say it is not so much about the lake, or the gear, or the number of days or anything else as much as it is about the people you go with. Good fishing buddies are hard to come by. Build a great group of fishing friends and you will never have a bad trip."
6528048,lassh,2021-02-16 07:31:00,553,What NM_Trout said. Great list! I really appreciate #19 and will try to focus on that more on my trips.

As much as I love the guys- 4-5 days w them put me in the mindset of looking forward to going home. Once we started going on our own, and for weeklong trips, I've dreaded having to return home. I'm not saying we didn't cause the others stress, but for whatever reason we found peace w just our group."
6508642,Lakefront,2020-12-16 14:38:00,179,Very good advise about pitching in. Have traveled with family's in tow and have experienced this on both fronts. We look forward to the day when the borders open up again as I just retired and will not have to drive 20 minutes to town to check my voicemail or emails
6509570,Moosebunk,2020-12-19 20:46:00,211,"Same simple advice applies to anyone and anywhere one might go and fish but, especially to first timers.KNOW YOUR LIMITATIONS. ... which can be applied to plenty of things if you think about it."
6509600,ILScott,2020-12-20 05:20:00,139,"I have been going to the same lake system since 2000. I know the lake system but I still look at Google satellite to see if I am missing any little streams that empty into the lake system. Google is a great way to get a feel for the lake your are going to. Along with this see if you can get a map of the the lake you are going to go to. The other thing is to ask questions. About depth and what to use. When I go I try to figure out the depth of fish. To do this I pull a bottom bouncer with a spinner rig. Once I targeted the depth it stays pretty true throughout the lake system I fish at. Two years ago my son and I had no problem catching fish and talked to many people in camp that said they were struggling to catch walleye. When I told them we were catching walleye in 6 to 8 feet with bottom bouncers and then jigging for them once found, they were surprised. Couple guys have never used or seen bottom bouncer with spinners before. So I gave them a couple setups and the next day they were successful. So the big thing is try different approaches not one way will always work. I will be honest bottom bouncing has worked for me a lot and close to shore. The last thing I have found is to play the wind. Watch the wind on a daily basis and if it blows the same way for multiple days find that shore line the fish will be there."
6509614,HeHooksHimself,2020-12-20 06:27:00,725,"Hey Scott, like you, I missed our trip to WLC last year very much. What are your plans this year? In '19 we did a trip in August and the fishing was completely different than when we usually go (opener). Fortunately Nick took us out and showed us where and how to fish. Whatever it takes, including vax if required, I sure hope to get north this year. Did Nick take care of you by transferring deposits and stuff? He is a little evasive, but we had 8 guys scheduled last year and only four this year. I still am not sure if we will get credit for all $2400 or just $1200. One of our guys became a paraplegic since then and couldn't possibly go, two of them come from so far away that they can't plan convoluted travel plans on a hope, and one of them is in charge of a total department at his job so he can't make last minute plans. We have a week scheduled for Minnesota opener so if the border opens for Canadian walleye opener two of us will do back to back weeks and the other two will meet us to go to Canada. Should be interesting. To everyone reading this far except Scott, sorry for such a personal reply, I probably should have PM'ed Scott, but I have no secrets! Fish ON! Hooks"
6509628,ILScott,2020-12-20 07:12:00,139,"Hooks, Yeah we got taken care of. Right when we got cancelled we got in towards the end of June. When a cabin came open for a week earlier I contacted Nick and he moved me up. Hope everything is good for you. I hope we can get up this year."

Gear, food, clothing etc. 2: Talk to the camp owner(s) upon arrival. They want you to be successful and will tell you everything they can about where to fish what to use etc. That's why they are there thru the week making small talk with you and gleening info to give to next weeks guests. They know the lake better than anyone of us! 3: Don't go to cheap on the rain suit as you may spend all day every day in it. 4: Fishing is just one of the things you are there to do. Look around, have great all day convo's with your boat Partner, play cards, take a nap, have a beer with the neighbors, invite the owners up for diner and get to know them better. 5: Enjoy. Every.

6514104,Mojo-NC,2021-01-05 11:01:00,1929,"Aside from what has already been mentioned, be humble. We normally rotate our guys each day. It is amazing how much one can learn from fishing with other guys. Each individual seems to have a specialty of their own, be it casting for pike or jigging/rigging for walleyes. Take advantage of their knowledge and techniques to increase your skill level. One year we had a young pup about 20 years old that acted like he already knew everything. He was the son of a guy that we had invited. He wasn't catching many fish but he still wouldn't take anyone's advice or use their tackle. We tried as hard as we could to offer him an opportunity to use our jigs and rigs so that he would have an opportunity to catch more fish. Nope! We finally waved the white flag and gave up on him. He never did catch many fish and definitely wasn't invited back."
6502866,Ricky Spanish,2020-11-30 14:45:00,1298,"#1. Be willing to take and follow advice from those that are in the know about current conditions. Drowning worms two feet under a bobber doesn't work in many conditions. #2.

It is supposed to be a vacation so ignore boards like this, put a 3/8 jig on and a white twister tail enjoy the scenery and time with your friends. And, by the way, money spent on a good rain suit It is well spent. I should know I almost froze to death in July"
6503004,ogilville,2020-12-01 06:02:00,262,"There has been lots of good advice in this thread. I have been going on fishing trips to Canada for almost 40 years. There have been many different groups of people from experienced to beginning anglers go on the trips. When the fish are biting and you are catching fish it is fun and easy. Sometimes after a few days and the fishing slows down and the weather is rainy, cold, windy or hot and sunny and you are getting bored or tired you might feel like laying down the pole and doing nothing. You are allowed to do that, heck its your fishing trip. But remember you do have to have a lure in the water to catch fish. Sometimes the bites are few and it isn't going to be you that catches the nice one if you aren't fishing. That's my tip to beginners."

6503172,Braggart,2020-12-01 14:35:00,22,"I've been fortunate enough to have visited almost every province and territory in Canada as a younger man, and have fished every one that I did visit. These days I tend to stick to a select few areas/trips, those that I particularly enjoy. Part of it is age, as being north of 50 one tends to start considering mortality and ""time left"", and I would rather spend time in areas that have special meaning to me. Part of it is the fact that after all these years, I have whittled down all those experiences to a select few that fit my own personal criteria, namely: ...entirely DIY (take in all my own equipment, accessible via truck/boat. No planes, no lodges, no guides. My meager boat, my tent, my gear, my schedule). ...as remote as possible (the less people the better, none is best). ...unspoiled beauty (hard to find these days). ...and great fishing (whatever that means...to me...every one of these areas has a different allure). I often take beginners and newbies to these areas, as I do enjoy the company. We do have a core group of guys that have come and gone over the years, but I still enjoy taking someone (those who have similar interests) who has not experienced fishing in an unspoiled area. Due to the fact that I have frequented these areas often, I know what to expect. Newbies do not... Every trip I start with the same advice as we start our journey/drive, namely ""enjoy every part, from this point forward"". Even the gruelling 12+ hour drive will result in memories going forward. Too often we rush thru experiences waiting for the highlites, the ""good parts"". As a result, we end up missing the parts in between that make for the whole experience. In addition, during the trip I often make it a point to stop and describe that ""particular point"" in time, trying to create an image in space that we can relate to later on, usually in the dead of winter, when our minds wander back to the time we spent on the water. Identifying these moments in time makes them real, makes us appreciate them all the more. Rushing thru ""the bite"", trying to put 100 fish in the boat, trying to get that ""first cast"" into that weedy bay at times makes us crazy and we risk losing sight of why we are there in the first place. Stopping and enjoying the moment as the mist slowly dissipates from the shoreline, the sunrise as the rays break thru the trees, the calmness of the water in the early morning is at times lost on us in our rush to put fish in the boat. Long winded, for that I apologize, but the takeaway in all this is...slow down. Slow down and make every point in time count. Enjoy the planning, the drive, the company. We may go on these fishing trips for the ""end game"", which by all accounts is catching ""many"" or ""big"" fish, but the true beauty is in the whole experience. From start to end, and everything in between. Slow down, enjoy the ride. B"

Once that plane leaves, I love the feeling of knowing that for one week, everything at home has to take care of itself or get dealt with when I get back. I have not found another way to get this feeling other than to fly-in fish where there is no connectivity. Someone mentioned that most guys would have some experience fishing/outdoors but we have had folks in almost every group we have taken on fly-in trips that had no idea which end of the pole to use! For those guys, my advice would be to pitch in with what you can do (clean, cook, refuel the boats, stock minnows,etc), once on the water the others in the group that are experienced will help you catch fish.

6502832,Duflebag,2020-11-30 10:55:00,218,"My #1 piece of advice would be to first learn to fish NW Ontario with a guide. Under that piece of advice is to do your homework long before you take that trip and start fishing with that guide. First part of that process would be research. The internet has vast resources such as this forum. Read and as questions as you develop them. Fishermen like on this forum are always happy to share their knowledge and opinons. Determine what type of experience you want. Area of Canada. Fly-in remote cabin or all inclusive american Plan resort and all of the options between. What species are you loooking for. Are you looking for numbers or trophies. Multi-species lakes or single species. Once you have an idea of what you are looking for, then research for the guide that best fits your ideas. Do you want a guide that will teach you to fish. My sons and many of my friends were not very good fishermen when they first went to Canada. My guide taught them all to be excellent fishermen. He is patient and a great teacher. Do you want a guide that is engaging and interracts with his party, someone that jokes and becomes part of the group. Do you want a guide that does not talk a lot but, knows his lakes and spots. One thing that is of prime importance no matter the personality of the guide is their knowledge of the lakes. Knowing those spots on spots and specific presentations and techniques that really make a trip. Ask questions on forums such as this after you have an idea of what you are looking for. I found my guide by asking fishermen and other guides in Canada of who would best fit my ideas. My search came up with the ideal guide for me. We are now 33 years of fishing together both in Cananda and Central and South America sishing on vacation together. Taking the time to follow this type of progress can truly pay off for your Canadian fishing experience. My two cents. I have never had a bad experience fishing in NW Ontario."
6502858,RichA$1970,2020-11-30 13:48:00,1159,"I go back to my days in the infantry on a couple of keys:Land NavGet a map n study the lake, islands, bays drop offs, feeder creeks n points. Pack LightYou won’t use most of the crap in that fancy 25 pound tackle box. A lot of jigs, several spoons, cranks n spinners n your are set. It’s not a fashion show, you can get by on 2 sets of clothes. 1 good set of rain gear. Have your girl spray you with a garden hose for 5 minutes n if you are dry, you are set before you go. Once you land, enjoy the surrounding lake as it’s truly God’s gift to us. Finally, see if anyone brought fish clickers / counters and gather them all and throw them in the lake. Those things are about as honest as a Chicago Voting Commission n all the BS people say of thousands of fish per week. No need to a tally, you’ll know if you had a good time without the a-holes who double / triple count to make some game of it."
6502460,BornToFish,2020-11-29 06:02:00,1224,"Greetings,I have talked to hundreds of first-time anglers over the decades that were guests at the fishing lodges in North West Ontario that my wife and I fish at. This advice became the foundation of the books that I authored about fishing in Ontario. I thought of an idea to throw out on this forum, as we approach the grand season of ""winternet"". If you were to chat with someone contemplating fishing in NW Ontario for the first time, what would be the single most important piece of information that you would want to share with that person?I thought of at least six things that would be ""most important"" for me to mention to someone. But again, what is the ONE and MOST IMPORTANT thing that you would want to share?My most important advice would be along the lines of understanding that the waters in NW Ontario are different than most waters found in the mid-western states of the United States. The lakes that I fish in NW Ontario are colder, deeper and more sterile (i.e. less fertile) than the lakes that I fish in Wisconsin. Hence, I approach angling differently in NW Ontario compared to fishing in Wisconsin.What is your most important advice to offer to a first-time angler in NW Ontario?Good fishing and tight lines!!"

6502536,NARDA 1,2020-11-29 10:36:00,636,Hire a guide for at least one day at the beginning of your trip and pay attention! This will quickly show you what works and where to fish.
6502548,Pooch,2020-11-29 11:21:00,4618,"Assuming the first timer to Ontario already knows all of the above and already knows how to fish, here are some thoughts. Know the fish's seasonal movements and which season it is the day you are one the water. Get and familiarize yourself with a map of the lake before you leave home. Know how to use and understand your electronics before leaving home. Know what restrictions there are before reaching the border. If you are using a camp boat, treat it with respect. Repairs are expensive and in the current world situation replacement parts may be hard to get. Plus, you are going to pay for the repairs, plus spend the night stranded. Everyone knows to pack light, but few actually do. You don't need clean jeans everyday. Undies? Yes. Pants? no. It's a fishing trip not a style show. Unless you stink, your cabin mates don't give a Rats' Azz about your trendy outfit. Spend money on a GOOD rain suit and light weight boots. This is the last thing you want to go cheap Charlie on. I see numb nuts in cheap rain gear soaked to the bone on the docks every trip. Do your homework and look at what the old guys are wearing. Dress in layers 'cause mornings are chilly on the water, mid day sun can be pretty hot and evenings get cool to cold. You will actually use about twenty five present of the tackle you pack. Again, look at what the old guys bring or don't bring. Taking your own boat? Get the trailer bearings repacked every year by someone who actually knows how to do it. Bring a spare prop and hardware and tools needed to replace it. Scrutinize every inch of your boat, motor, trailer and tow vehicle. Being broken down along the road in Ontario is a whole different dog than being broken down along the road back home. Plan accordingly. When traveling in multiple vehicles, always keep each other in site. Cell service is improving, but still has huge gaps. Especially along 502. Speaking of 502, if you have cars stacked up behind you, pull over so they can pass. People will tell you ""that you do not need live bait in Ontario"". That is true sometimes on some lakes, but if you choose to go that route, bring along some extra hot dogs 'cause you will need them sooner or later. You don't need a boatload of rod and reels. Look at how the old guys set up. Most I fish with carry a medium bait caster for trolling, a medium light spinning rod for light jigging and a medium spinning rod for jigging larger plastics. The bait caster could double for the heavier jigging plastics in a pinch. Bring a couple spare rods and reels within the group. Everyone does not need a full set of spares. Leave them packed in the cabin. Don't stand your rod tubes on end. That's how tips get broken. Your list could go on and on. Just common sense is all that's needed. Good luck with your book or whatever. My first trip to Canada was a pathetic. None of us had ever been across the border before. That was seventy trips ago... Pooch"
6502552,Mojo-NC,2020-11-29 11:32:00,1929,"BTF, that's a loaded question. I have to assume that most people who are making the investment of time and money necessary to go on a fishing trip to Canada would already have the interest and at least a little experience fishing. Therefore, my most important advice would be to advise them to speak with someone who had fished Canada previously. That said, if I were that someone, the first and most important thing I would do would be to attempt to determine their baseline by finding out what their expectations are for the trip with a short series of questions. As in how much do they mind ""roughing it"", do they plan to cook their own meals or would they prefer to have their food prepared for them, do they prefer to fish big or small water, and I would determine if they are planning to bring their own boat or use a camp boat. I would also ask if they would prefer to catch a larger number of smaller fish or fewer fish with a potential for something trophy-sized, and determine which species they prefer to catch. My advice would be very different for an inexperienced angler as compared with advice for an experienced angler, and would also depend on their responses to the questions above."

Keep your eyes open and recognize successful fishermen, see what they are using and where they go. If you are a veteran but going at a different time than usual, the fishing will be completely different than you are used to. Most lodge owners want you to be successful, ask them what works and buy it from them. Even the greenest rookie will be amazed at how successful they are. Don't invade the spaces of others, but take note of where they are fishing. Depth and structure are critical pieces of information, try to replicate what others think are successful. Use a depth finder, it will help a lot. Fish On! Hooks"
