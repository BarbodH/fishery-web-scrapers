6542880,bigwalleye1,2021-03-25 09:47:00,2632,Methinks the hatchet job by some group members is intentional.....
6542912,Eckohlt,2021-03-25 11:24:00,3685,If someone in my group butchers a fish on purpose a arse chewing is going to take place
6542966,Aspencreek,2021-03-25 13:03:00,2911,"Hahaha, I can relate. Our group had one a few years back who basically said he was doing nothing also. While everyone else did their part to keep the cabin clean, cook and do dishes, he did nothing but drink beer, talk loud, and sleep late, keeping his boat partner to wait on the dock. Like you, it didn't go over well. So by tues, his boat partner jumped in with my brother and I took his camp boat, leaving ""bill"" without a boat for the entire day. When we returned we found him passed out on the porch, again doing nothing all day but drink. He left camp the next morning, when we all decided to kick him out. When I see him now he still says he is sorry, but ""fool me once""......... We are very careful now. On our trip to South Dakota pheasant hunting we had a new guy invited by a longtime trip member. This guy too, made himself comfortable, was the first to the table to eat, never did a dish or offer to help, always volunteered to be a blocker, shot over others head, shot when he shouldn't have, claimed birds that were obviously not shot by him, borrowed my brothers ""extra"" gun because his didn't shoot right without permission, dipped into others shell boxes and loved to drink and talk politics. LOUDLY! There was a point made to never have him invited again. These guys are a point of conversation, but not fun to have as part of a hunting or fishing trip."
6542970,Aspencreek,2021-03-25 13:08:00,2911,"That MIGHT be true, if you think someone would actually put that much thought into getting out of doing it. Because my son does almost all of the fileting, if someone is struggling he will interrupt and take over."
6543004,Eckohlt,2021-03-25 14:49:00,3685,"Good thing you weren't on a fly in that guy would have had a long walk through the bush to his vehicle,those type of guys for the most part are far n few between,most are willing to chip in around camp"
6543022,Aspencreek,2021-03-25 15:45:00,2911,"Very true, anyone new to our group (if we ever have a group again) is WELL aware of his job or duties while in camp. It's just the fair thing to do."
6543060,Eckohlt,2021-03-25 17:34:00,3685,"I like to go alone in oct,don't have to deal with anyone it's kind of a nice peaceful break"
6538170,pjshorthorn,2021-03-14 16:20:00,5654,It wasn't me in this case....LOL. PjShorthorn
6538220,gordy28,2021-03-14 18:43:00,437,Oh man I can empathize with this thread On my first ever trip to a fishing lodge we really struggled to catch walleye or pike of any size. We caught lots of smallmouth though and since I was desperate for a fish fry we kept a few for the pan. Fast forward to my brother and I cleaning them in the lodges fish hut in front of another group who had a) a nice stringer of walleye and b)knew how to filet a fish Rather than scoff at us they eventually offered some pointers and also graciously pointed out a few spots for us to try for walleye after realizing we weren't having much luck To this day I am still pretty brutal w the filet knife (slightly better at catching walleye) but thankfully one of the guys in our group is a whiz w it Cheers Andrew
6538328,Eckohlt,2021-03-15 03:41:00,3685,What happens if the whiz can't go?
6538498,wmd,2021-03-15 12:09:00,388,"Years back we had 2 Veterinarians as part of our group. Neither could fillet a fish to save their soul, it was really ugly. One turned in to our cook, he was really good at that, and the other was our gopher, beer cocktails etc. It was amazing that any patients survived on the surgery table the way they butchered fish. Both were very good Vets but poor fish cleaners. wmd"
6538572,Eckohlt,2021-03-15 13:52:00,3685,"Not a lot of people take fish to a vet,so no experiance for the vets"
6538796,gordy28,2021-03-15 20:21:00,437,Ecko I think I and a few other guys would middle through but it's a good call out. I think I am going to practice some this summer at the cottage. Maybe the 5 filet method on some pike cause walleye are rarer species on that lake lol Andrew
6538858,Eckohlt,2021-03-16 05:21:00,3685,"There are many videos on YouTube of taking y bones out of pike,if you watch them enough it will stick in your mind where to start and where to finish up,it can be alittle tougher to do on real small pike,just have to go slow and take your time starting out,I use to do the 5 fillet method that's works to."
6539926,gordy28,2021-03-18 07:46:00,437,Thanks - will definitely plan on some youtube fileting this summer = assuming I can catch some pike Andrew
6541320,Aspencreek,2021-03-21 09:31:00,2911,"Thanks for the stories and tales. I feel much better now that others have struggled too. In our group, everyone has their appointed jobs, mine is to cook, my son does all of the fish cleaning with who ever wants to help. I tried to teach him, but failed miserably. Blair at Onaway showed him how to do it properly for walleye and northern about 15 yrs back. That left me off the hook and stay away. Some things are better left to those talented enough to do them."
6541372,Eckohlt,2021-03-21 11:38:00,3685,"Went on a trip years back most were in our 50's but one guy brought his son in his 20's,I told him his chore for the week was to sweep the floor once a day,and his remark was WHY should I do that I'm on vacation,that remark didn't go well lol"
6537604,andreindy,2021-03-13 08:14:00,308,"Had to smile at a Canada memory today and remembering my brother JP struggling to clean fish our first trip to Ontario. Drive to lake, O'Sullivans up by Nakina. It was important that everyone learn. So one evening we are alone in the camp fish shack and I gave another lesson...blade angle, how to use the tip, pressure, etc. He says ""I got it bro. I will clean the rest of these walleye up"" so he put the next walleye on the cutting board. As I was preparing to leave, a gang of grey-beards walk in with their catch and settle directly across from my brother JP. The kind of fellas that could bonelessly fillet a fish with an ice scraper. My brother got a really anxious look on his face, and I smirked and abandoned him. As the story goes, my brother took the next eternity cleaning those 3 walleye. Like for-real sweaty arm pits, praying to look competent eternity. My brother would butcher them so badly that he even caught one of the guys wince. He said it was like taking a final hands on exam in front of Al Lindner. I was in the cabin kitchen preparing the pan fry when JP walked in, pale, deflated and he mumbled out the story above. Well, where are the fillets? Over there, he points and we both look to an empty spot on the counter. ...his fillets were so bony and awful they were mistaken for scraps and Dad threw them in the garbage moments earlier. JP said a few choice words and almost fell over. God, I love reminding him of this story. And they will remind me of the first time I tried boning a northern..."
6537758,HeHooksHimself,2021-03-13 13:58:00,725,"The first time I ever went fishing I had a pocket knife. I caught a walleye, probably bigger than allowed but I didn't measure it, was unaware there was even a slot. My buddy said you clean it and I will get a pan ready. I had no clue and after half hour and a bloody mess I just threw it all in the trash. We had hot dogs. I am still no surgeon, but I am much better at it now!"
6537868,Mojo-NC,2021-03-13 19:47:00,1929,"The first year I brought my my new battery operated filet knife with me to Canada, the Ontario Wildlife Officers decided to stop by our camp and check our boats, catches, freezers, and even our cabin refrigerators. We were all legal but it was incredibly intimidating to have these guys watch over my shoulder while I was cleaning our fish. I did ok and didn't hack them up too badly even though I was really nervous. They turned out to be very friendly guys but I suspect they wouldn't have been so nice if we hadn't been legal. They were definitely thorough."
6537878,tandm,2021-03-13 20:41:00,679,"My Grandfather taught me, and all of my cousins, how to clean fish when we were barely tall enough to work on the fillet table. Some of my fondest memories are of him holding my hand as we guided the knife thru the first several fish. After cleaning enough to his satisfaction, he would retire to a cold beer and let us finish. If my grandmother would have known what we were doing, she would have thrown a frying pan at him. His teaching was effective. None of us ever got more than a nick from the sharpened butcher knives he used, I've honed my skills over the last ** years, and I now enjoy a cocktail as my grandchildren fillet the daily catch. Thank you Grandpa. You'll never know how excited I was when you told me to take the knife myself and finish."
6537942,Walleye2242,2021-03-14 07:37:00,263,Was 7 on my 1st trip to canada. was taught how to clean fish. Then we went into town for a few supplies and dad bought me my 1st rapala fillet knife. He said....do not open it in the car...wait until we get back to camp. What do i do....open it in the car and cut my finger open. Now i yell at my kid for not listening.
6537962,pjshorthorn,2021-03-14 08:06:00,5654,"I think we have all been on the fish cleaning struggle bus and everything that comes with learning how to clean fish. I can't recall anyone teaching me during my youth. I just started to do it on my own and made a ton of mistakes along the way.....including filleting my finger in the middle of nowhere. Duct tape fixes that  minor issue and prevents infection too I did ask VBay Gord to give me a few tips on cleaning fish, since he is a master at it, but he threw in the knife after one fish. PjShorthorn"
6538026,bbheli,2021-03-14 09:50:00,1387,"Man that is exactly what happened to me. My dad bought me the knife, said it was extremely sharp don't open it yet and of course I could not wait. I still have the scar. Deepest cut I ever had needed several stiches."
6538102,ackvil,2021-03-14 12:03:00,177,"Two knife stories cleaning fish. Last year we were cleaning fish when my buddy borrowed my fillet knife. My fillet knife is sharpened on both the top and bottom portion with the top used to cut through the tough skin and the bottom portion to make the fillet. My buddy did not give me a chance to explain that and got a nasty cut A few years ago one of the guys at our cabin was new to fishing. He had purchased everything new including a nice looking fillet knife he got at Wal-Mart. Unfortunately, that knife was not all that sharp when he bought it and got worse after using it just one time. No matter how we tried to sharpen it, the blade would dull after cleaning one fish. Well, he insisted that the knife would work and he started to clean a walleye. When he got done with it you could not imagine what the mess looked like."
6538128,Hewhocookstomuch,2021-03-14 13:28:00,66,"One of the regulars got a new knife. There were three others who cleaned our fish. He wanted to get better at cleaning so they let him try. On the very first fish he slipped and almost removed his thumb. Luckily we had a medical professional in the group. That's right we called him Doc. He stopped the bleeding and after a couple of shots(for Doc) he sewed Pat's thumb up. Thankfully no infection and hardly a scar. Pat is great at cleaning fish now that he knows to cut away from his body. Me, I am the cook and do not want anything to do with cleaning fish."
6538152,stjoeguy,2021-03-14 14:36:00,979,"Heck of a way to get out of cleaning fish, Pat!"
