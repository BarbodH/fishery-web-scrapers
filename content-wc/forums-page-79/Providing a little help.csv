Good luck with your business and hope 2021 works out for all of us! ""Dignified Members, As an American who has spent 27 years and hundreds of thousands of dollars bringing groups of tourists up to NW Ontario for fishing trips, the border closure of 2020 was a significant blow to our spiritual connection to the land. While I fully respect your decision to close the border for safety, your inability to support the businesses that were forced to close is alarming. I own a business that was also forced to close in the US and am proud of the way America has supported us. The tourism outfitters in Ontario and across Canada are suffering and need the kind of support the US has provided. Any money spent towards them will be paid back with tax revenue generated by us Americans. If you fail to act you will decimate an industry and thousands of lives. Thank you for your consideration, Neil Byers"""
