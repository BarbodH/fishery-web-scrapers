Yeah, I bet the crappie spawn this year will be unreal, and produce a very successful spawn, imagine population will explode with few folks pulling them out from the beds. Also walleye, to a maybe lesser extent. My guess is that the areas not open also normally benefits the crappie spawn, the rest of the water normally being open to removal of the crappie spawners. I have always figured the biggies spawn earlier than the smaller fish, just a guess, tho. Bill"
6539916,prov1800,2021-03-18 07:12:00,5010,Your right Bill it will be crazy this year.As far as i know last year i was the only person and my wife that fished for them.Iam expecting a incredible catch this year.I have found a places where they spawn and no one ever fished them as most people just go to the hot spots never trying to look into other places.Good for me.If i need live bait for muskies Clarks always has a great assortment of live suckers available at all times.Surprised you have never caught a whitefish on Cedar there are plenty of them and whenyour there in the fall is the best time to get them.They normally spawn late in oct or nov.Any creeks coming into lake.We used to dip net them when my kids where young.Flashlights and hip waders.Was so much fun.The tulibees i never catch in the boating season either.Only get them ice fishing.
6539216,prov1800,2021-03-16 18:19:00,5010,"today was my planned trip to Cedar for some crappies.Got lucky and found them and a bunch of annoying tulibees but they were fun to catch,Beautifull day and glad i went.Enjoyable ride through the bush.Action was good and got all 12-14""""crappies in around 28 Ft.Once they commited to coming up to lure they nailed it.Was only person on lake today isnt that awesome."

6539222,Eckohlt,2021-03-16 18:26:00,3685,"John what's going to happen to the tulibee,will you have it mounted and put on your office wall?oopppppsssss I forgot your office is the prov"
6539224,prov1800,2021-03-16 18:33:00,5010,Those will be Eagle food. I actually have a office.I used to have a taxidery business so i have a lot of mounts all over house and my shop.
6539294,Eckohlt,2021-03-17 05:27:00,3685,Looks like early spring there n probably early ice out
6539366,Bill Krejca,2021-03-17 08:19:00,6107,Nice crappie. Re: tulibee - trout bait? Bill
6539682,prov1800,2021-03-17 17:47:00,5010,you never know but that would be nice.7 years ago it happened.We had 200 yds of open water and brought a 12 ft naden and rowed out and caught walleye none stop 3 days before the season closed.That was amazing we could sight fish them in 3-4 ft of water on Cliff Lake.Could see lakers and muskie swimming bythe boat.would love to do that again.
6539686,prov1800,2021-03-17 17:56:00,5010,"Might be a bit big at 20"" Bill but muskie would swallow that in a second. Crappie population in fine shape Bill.This years spawn is going to be crazy.Wish you could be here for that.Ive got a got pro Clarks loaned me just have to figure out how to use it.Plan to get some good videos this summer."
6539690,Eckohlt,2021-03-17 18:09:00,3685,"It's not fair john you get to have all the fun,it's like Xmas for you everyday of the year,all's we hear about is all the great stuff we are missing"
6539710,prov1800,2021-03-17 18:35:00,5010,"Yeah sorry Rod. I dont understand our Government.Even though were not""POLITICIANS""i know there's ways to bring in all off the fisherman into Canada.Somehow there using this covid deal to keep the border closed.I understand its dangerous as a good friend in states just spent 85 days fighting covid-19.He is home now and plain told me you dont want this.But with vaccinations,getting a Covid test prior to border crossing and prove of intenary from yourself and from the camp would prove your no threat to any Canadian and also save from us.Iam more concerened with the cases here and not getting vaccinated then coming into contact with a safe person from US.I think something else is going on.Whats your take on all this."
