(Well I will say a small bead of sweat may have appeared when all of the beer hit the scales)https://www.northernjacks.com/post/the-weight Cheers Andrew"

6538360,Baseline,2021-03-15 07:07:00,3207,I made 30 or so trips into the Boundary Waters Canoe Area in Northern MN. One incentive to make weight is when you have to carry every ounce you put in your pack over multiple portages some of which can be over 1/2 mile long.
6538870,gordy28,2021-03-16 06:33:00,437,Thanks all - definitely some things are learned by experience I think My tackle box is much smaller now than it was on my first trip for sure and we have also found using a water filter vs brining in bottled water saves a lot of weight Cheers Andrew
