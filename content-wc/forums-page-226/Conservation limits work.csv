4942801,Bill Krejca,2016-06-21 21:45:00,6107,"We do know that the 30 incher will transfer its genes to it's offspring, so even if some of the eggs are not as fertile (as we tend to think, maybe, even though there are considerably more eggs), the fact that it reached 30 inches is a fact. The 18 incher could, baring unforeseen curtailment, or may not ever get that big. I just can't buy into the theory of larger fish having very poor recruitment. Bio articles I have read( I can't share any, off the top of my head, bare this out. Bill"
4943777,Guest,2016-06-22 09:55:00,0,"Not saying that they aren't still productive, but that they have already passed on those genetics numerous times and are nearing the end of their life expectancy."
4943849,Guest,2016-06-22 10:30:00,0,"I just looked up the fisheries survey data on the MN DNR Lakefinder site for LOTW. The 2015 sampling showed 1588 walleyes with 4 of them in the 30-34"" size bracket. That's 1/400 of survived fish being over that magical 30"" mark. This tells me that my bump board may be telling me the truth after all."
4944145,SterlingArcher,2016-06-22 13:47:00,92,"That sounds about right. They're rare, but not like unicorns. I have caught 4 over 30"" in my life, two on Mille Lacs, two on Leech Lake. None in Canada. In fact I don't know that I've ever caught one over 29 in Canada. Certain bodies of water produce the giants; most don't."
4944561,yoopertrout,2016-06-22 17:57:00,1172,"I haven't fished Ontario consistently enough to say from personal experience whether more restrictive regs have helped. It makes sense that they would, though, and I applaud Canada for being forward thinking enough to implement them. I wish some of our midwestern states would follow the lead. I hope that the mentality of ""It's hardly worth going to Canada if I can't bring more fish home"" is changing. I recently heard of two Wisconsinites who can't seem to get on board with modern thinking. One, a friend of a friend, told my friend that he just got back and that, between himself and two others, they ate 300 walleyes in a week. Another told me a couple years ago that he eats a limit for lunch and another for dinner. It's really hard for me to understand such ignorant and illegal behavior. If fishing is all about getting meat to eat, the grocery store is cheaper. I guess these are the guys who have to eat themselves sick at an all you can eat restaurant. Some of these guys can't mature past the sense of entitlement and the macho bragging. On behalf of all Americans, I apologize for these asshats."
4944969,Ogoki,2016-06-22 20:59:00,291,"Yoopertrout, Your thoughts are right on. What does a guy bring home after 18 holes of golf or a trip to the Nascar races ? If a person doesn't enjoy being in the Canadian wilderness, smelling the awesome air, hearing the loons , watching an eagle , hearing a white throated sparrrow., then they better just go buy some fish, much cheaper. Not seing hords of people . Not hearing news for a week. Soo much more than just bringing home 4 walleye. I have not been home 2 weeks from Armstrong and l leave tomorrow for Northern Michigan and then on to Nakina on Sunday , for another round of catching and eating walleye . Then there's 2 weeks in August to look forward to. Fish and hunt bears ."
4940313,v-bay gord,2016-06-20 19:31:00,3168,A 30 and a 31 inch walleye caught a couple weeks ago. They are an exceptional catch on Canadian shield lakes. That's what makes it a challenge. It's not a given........
4940489,Lmbkiller,2016-06-20 21:03:00,639,"Obviously those are nice fish vbay. I'm not saying they aren't 30 and 31. My question is who measured them? What did they use to measure them? How come I never see a true 30in walleye on a bump board with the fish squared up proper, in a picture? Plenty of pics on here with mid/upper 20's on bump boards, how come there aren't any over 30's in pics taken the same way?"
4940529,v-bay gord,2016-06-20 21:32:00,3168,The boats they were using have bump boards so I suppose they came up with their measurement from using them. I don't have a reason to doubt what they claim.....
4941137,kcguy68,2016-06-21 08:15:00,51,"I would say the fishing at Eagle Lake Ontario has improved every year since I started going back up 10 years ago. We are catching bigger walleye with more frequency. One of our ""complaints"" last year was the fact that we had days where we struggled to catch some eaters as everything we were catching was too big. That is a nice problem to have in my opinion. At first I was a little annoyed with the stricter conservation laws in regards to slot, but over the past 10 years, I can see first hand that it is working."
4941617,emma17,2016-06-21 11:10:00,436,"Thanks for sharing. My goodness, Walleye (especially big ones) are just beautiful fish."
4942113,Guest,2016-06-21 15:29:00,0,"Lmbkiller - what do you do that you have handled that many fish? In mn, I have personally had 4 eyes that were 30""+ in my boat that I myself personally measured on a bump board. Mouth closed, jammed into the stop, tail fanned. 30, 30-1/2, 31, and 31-1/2. All but the 31 on either the rainy river or lotw. In Canada, I have measured a couple more. We never took any pics of them on the bump board, so maybe our tales are suspect? That's ok if you don't believe it, because my partners and I have the memories, and those can't be taken."
4942449,Lmbkiller,2016-06-21 18:55:00,639,"I work in fisheries for the last 11yrs. Have conducted many surveys from fall yoy assessments to spring comprehensive surveys. Walleye pe's, musky pe's, etc. Using fyke nets, electrofishers, gill nets, etc. There is endless amounts of data out in the web world. Very little, if any, has any 30""+ walleyes on it. Look up the surveys conducted over on the west side Green Bay tributaries (peshtigo, oconto, menominie)......not 1 walleye 30"" or over. If no 30""+ walleyes on one of the greatest walleye fisheries on the planet, then where? I bet Erie has some. Not many other places. They certainly aren't swimming every where like people proclaim they are. I believe in data. I don't believe in pictures of big walleyes that say ""got my 30 incher again"", with the fish held out in front of the person. When people say it was 30 and a half, 31, 32, I shake my head. Our work boards are in one tenth inches. That leaves little interpretation for ""rounding up"" (ex. 29.5 isn't 30). When you've handled over 60000 walleyes in your life and have never seen a 30"" fish and u study other data from other fisheries professionals and they don't have a 30"" fish well.......if it's too good to be true......"
4942537,v-bay gord,2016-06-21 19:31:00,3168,"Your experience only proves that genetics play a role in how big walleye can get. There are many fish factories that just won't produce fish over 30 inches. Some of the trout lakes in NW Ontario are not fish factories but the genetics are there for extra large, slow growing fish. All the more reason to release the giants......they have the genetics to produce more."
4942569,Lmbkiller,2016-06-21 19:57:00,639,"I very much agree vbay. Genetics is a large part. Many trout lks (or deep, clear, oligotrohic lks) can grow extremely large, unique specimens of fish. They are usually Cisco forage based, which also helps. Plus, densities of walleyes in these lks is extremely low so competion for resources is low, allowing for larger than usual growth. The big problem I have however, is that guys that go to Canada to fish walleyes almost never pick these lks to go catch walleyes, because no matter what u won't catch many because they just aren't there in high density. Some how though they are getting all these 30"" ers every where else"
4942601,v-bay gord,2016-06-21 20:06:00,3168,"The two fish I posted were caught on a trout lake, so your observation is correct. Eagle Lake has trout and I have caught a 30 incher personally, but they are rare in my experience. The low density, large size lakes do not attract the average walleye fisherman. The bottom line is a 30 plus inch walleye is very rare. Some lakes have them......others just don't have the genetics, no matter how great a fishery they are."
4939265,Ogoki,2016-06-20 10:50:00,291,"My first fly in trip was in 1971 , when I was 16. Fell in love with northern Ontario. I made my mind up then and there that fly in fishing was going to be "" my thing"". Bought land , built house and when that was paid for I was going to work and play hard . At 30 until now at 60 , I have 39 fly in trips and numerous canoe trips behind me. .When the length limits and daily limit was cut back to 4 walleye I felt this was going to be better yet. With the fishing pressure on the fly in lakes curtailed due to cost of flyiing in and the changing demographics , the lakes that I fish have gotten even better. The thread on the CO's checking people got me to thinking more about this . If we didn't have the city , county and state traffic law enforcement ,red light running , driving at high rates of speed etc , would be rampant. Same goes with enforcemennt of our fishing rules and laws. I feel the vast majority of people droppng $1500 to $2000 on a fishing trip ar going , to have a good time, follow the rules etc. Who wants a ticket to put a damper on their trip.?Back to my original thought , are most of you finding better fishing in both size and numbers than you were 5 , 10 or 15 years ago ?"
4939353,Pooch,2016-06-20 11:50:00,4619,"Back to my original thought , are most of you finding better fishing in both size and numbers than you were 5 , 10 or 15 years ago ?Better fishing on lakes like Lac Seul that have a more restrictive slot for sure.Declining fishing on another lake I have fished for many years and I had felt was one of the best in Canada that has no special limits other than the generic MNR limits.Lake Savant is in need of a slot similar to Lac Seul. All camps allow too many large fish to be butchered. Makes me angry and half ill when I see a over 24"" fish being harvested for lunch when the lake is full of 17 to 21"" fish.Just my observations after sixty plus trips fishing Canada.Pooch"
4939385,Obabikon,2016-06-20 12:04:00,2370,"The entire attitude has changed. I remember as a kid people saying ""let the little ones go, so they can grow up to be big"". That isn't the correct attitude. Let the BIG ONES go, so they can reproduce. Eat the little ones, because they are much easier for a fishery to replace. Eating two 14-15"" walleye is much better on the fishery than eating one 20"" walleye..."
4939409,SterlingArcher,2016-06-20 12:12:00,92,"That's interesting. I can count on one hand the number of times in my nine trips up there that I have seen a fish over 21"" come in to be cleaned. With the amount of fish in Savant and only three small camps on the lake (and only one fish over 18"" per person allowed), I don't think the lake is in any danger. Last year was the the best year I've ever had on Savant for size. Of course, it could be that after a decade of fishing it, I am just learning to be a better stick on that lake I 100% agree with you, though, that it's important to leave the mommas in the water to make more walleyes, and with the massive amounts of 16-17"" fish Savant has to offer, there isn't any good reason to kill a 24 or 25"" fish."
4939425,Ogoki,2016-06-20 12:19:00,291,"When it is just my wife and I , which is the majority of the time, we bring in 3 -16 to 17 inch fish to eat. If you butcher a 18 plus inch fish it is never gong to be any larger . I had a guy ask me to fillet his 4 take home walleye .( another guest where I was). I showed him that he wasn't really getting all that much more fish to kill one over 18 . I hope I educated hm a little , as he was new to fly in fishing . On a trip with 3 guys from church , they made such a big deal out of taking fish home , that when weeks end came , they asked if I had mine put back. Told them I wasn't taking any that , I ate enough while there. I will bring my 97 year old Mom a couple as she really loves it."
4939577,packpro,2016-06-20 13:09:00,695,"Gets better every year. Our trip in 2014 was a trip that saw a huge leap in in size and quantity. Our 2015 was a duplicate of 2014. Could be limits, and/or a more conservationist approach to the fishery. Those years were also a late ice out for our lake. We were one to two weeks ahead of schedule on water temps. This year was more of a normal ice out. Fished the same spots, but the fish were smaller and not as plentiful. I think in 14/15 we caught them schooled up and competing for food right after the spawn. Don't get me wrong, 2016 was still a great year, but 14/15 were off the chart. Seasonality makes a difference. We do fish one lake that has had scattered small walleye for the past 19 years. Each year near the spawn more fish and bigger fish are being caught and released. This year more 30"" 10 pounders were caught/released. As a 100% CPR lake it gets better every year. The same is holding true for the smallmouths on the lakes we fish."
4939625,HeHooksHimself,2016-06-20 13:42:00,725,"I think the number of walleye in the low 20's has increased drastically. In our favorite spring destination though, it seems the number of large pike is decreasing. Pike in general seem to be on the decrease. (Which I would have never thought possible) It is becoming uncommon to be walleye fishing and have pike bothering you. Ten years ago, pike were much more plentiful. Now, this might be specific to our ""go to"" place since the decline in pike seems to be in concert with the takeover of smallies in this system. We caught our first smallies in this system about 10 years ago and now we catch them everywhere. This spring, only 2 pike were caught over 36"" for our party of six. Ten years ago everyone would have caught at least one of that size I personally only caught 3 over 30"". Admittedly, we don't really fish for them. For the walleye though, conservation has resulted in it being difficult on some days to find them under 18"". Fish On! Hooks"
4940121,Guest,2016-06-20 17:55:00,0,Is it better to harvest an old female that has already spawned numerous times with only a few left or an 18incher that will spawn for many years? Which one will produce more walleye? The 18 will never reach 30 if harvested.
4940185,Daveygravy,2016-06-20 18:28:00,88,"The lake system that I had fished for the last 10 years was pretty consistent every year. Plenty of 16 to 20 inchers, none over 26. The lake that I would like to know about is Red lake. Back in the 80's ,my high school offered a trip to Red lake and I went all 4 years. The camp we stayed at had big groups of high school kids all summer, if I remember right you could bring home 6 pike and if you were lucky some walleye. Everybody brought home their limit of pike. Then throw in the amount of fish that sat in their parents freezer until becoming freezer burned and tossed out( Sad!!! ). I'm glad attitudes have changed as we have been educated by the pros on how fragile these lakes and rivers are. Conservation works and more knowledge will only make it better."
4940257,Lmbkiller,2016-06-20 19:00:00,639,"If I was forced to put a number on it I would say not even 1/1000 of 1% of all the 18in walleyes in North America will EVER reach 30in. They exist in so few waters. I know I know, everyone has caught one. To that I say I've handled 100x more walleyes than any 20 guys on this forum combined through work and sport, I've never handled a 30in walleye. A handful between 29.0-29.7, but that is NOT 30in. Sorry but not sorry for being skeptical on the ""30in walleye myth."""
