There were 4 of us in our group and we found very good fishing for pike and walleyes in Brace lake and also Meta lake. The walleye were in 5'-8' feet of water and primarily taking jigs/worm or jigs/salted minnows for us. Pink/white, white, and chartreuse bodies all accounted for some fish and we primarily used these colors. My friend also caught some on a light colored gulp. Size ranged from 12"" to 22"" with many in the 18""-22"" inch range. We only fished about 3-5 hours per day for walleye and averaged around 30 fish per man per day. Meta lake proved to be a little better fishing at this particular time but Brace lake also has many walleye in it. The other hours we searched for pike and caught them in shallow as well on topwater and various swim baits. The large pike the lake is known for were in a transition period and while we saw a few and had them slashing near our topwater baits we did not land any over 40"". Trolling deep for suspended fish accounted for them at this time of year. We did manage about 2 dozen fish between 28-""38"" with the biggest being caught on Zara spook and devils horse type lures, which was very entertaining. We averaged about 15 pike per person per day but the lake has potential to catch quite a few more than that especially by returning guests. All in all a very nice time, Kyle and Teri are very good owners, took care of everything we needed and provided us with clean cabins, comfortable beds and nice big boats with new motors. Full electricity in the cabins was nice and the generator is quiet and too far away to be heard at night. Babe Winkelman had been there in May and will have a show airing in the future about the fishing there. Should give everyone interested in going there additional information on Brace Lake Outfitters and the fishing there."

4939433,Guest,2016-06-20 12:20:00,0,"We talked to him about August fishing. He said that alot of the walleye at that time will be caught in the deeper cabbage weeds scattered all over the 3 lakes. You can run a jig around the weeds by sight fishing them to keep from always being snagged up. I suppose they also will be found on some of the points adjacent to deeper water. I would suggest those Storm perch swimbaits in the 8-10"" range to troll for the trophy pike as well. If you can find them. He says fishing is usually very good at that time and location of fish depends on what the weather and water temps are doing. We have a secret spot you might want to try but am not sure if any will be in there at that time. But they could be."
