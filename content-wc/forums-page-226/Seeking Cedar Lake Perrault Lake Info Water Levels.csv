4918881,Andyeye,2016-06-12 05:58:00,179,We will be arriving at Cedar Point Resort on the 24th of June. Our group has been there the last 2 years but it was in August. I'm hoping someone can give me some information on the water levels. We want to head up into the lakes North of Burnt Bridge and South and East of Perrault Lake this year I'm sure Ray can let me know when we get there but I'm hoping for a little pre-trip information. Thanks
4919857,bigwillies,2016-06-12 13:06:00,515,Just got back from cedar. Water is a little higher than normal(lots of rain lately) should be normal when u get here
4920785,ftfarms,2016-06-12 17:49:00,444,We've never had a problem going from cedar to perrault. It's always a little shallow around the burnt bridge but thats normal. Good luck.

Weather was excellent (Ray said due to the mild winter and early spring, it was like mid-June). Camp is in great shape, and Ray & Kathi are doing well.....bet you're counting down the days over the next 2 weeks. Safe travels north to Cedar. Rich"
4947337,BrewCrewFan,2016-06-24 09:33:00,4,I'm headed up with a group in August. We're some newbies to the lake. What can we expect in August? We'll be fishing for muskies and walleyes primarily. Any info would be great. Thanks in advance!!
