I know people cast the shoreline of the bay for Musky. We usually boat out of the bay into bigger water for Walleye, but that doesn't mean we aren't driving right over good spots. If you've got 10 hp, you'll probably stay in the bay and hit the drop offs. There are a couple small islands/reefs in the middle as well as a couple smaller bays off the main bay with nice structure."

We just focused on Smallies / Pike / Walleye. We picked up a nice low 40 Muskie in the bay within site of the camp on a top water. We had a second top water strike by a nice one that missed. I think you can find them very near camp but LOTW is pretty huge water for a 10HP. I would spend the $ for a camp boat to open up some more water. Plus the camp road in is pretty rough and long...imho. BTW...Excellent hosts. The brand new cabins are great. Very nice camp boats. Enjoy! B-"
