I've never had a bad trip, but often have to work hard for my success.Maria Lake is one of the few that far exceeded expectations.Here's a recap of the highlights:-We lost almost a full day and a half at the start of our trip because we couldn't fly in due to bad weather.-We battled mostly inclement weather during our shortened stayStill...-We boated 42 Master Angler pike (that's a fish in excess of 41"") and I believe set a camp record in the process. That was with a small group of four anglers and a short week.-Hundreds of hard fighting 5-10 pound lake trout were caught. There were no giants, but it was stupid easy fishing and the numbers were endless.-The camp was awesome. I hate being on a schedule and don't like being guided. At Maria you have the luxuries of a lodge including being fed 3 awesome meals a day, but have the complete freedom of an outpost camp stay.I put together an epic report on this trip which you can see here with an absolutely gross number of photos and video clips. If you're at all interested check it out!http://www.canadafishingguide.net/ch...hern-manitoba/Bottom line if anyone is seeking a true trip of a lifetime, this place should be on your radar!Cheers, Mike"

4942633,Mike Borger,2016-06-21 20:21:00,1554,Glad you liked! I currently have a Garmin GPSMAP 64 with the central Canada topo chip installed. It's great but will soon be upgrading to a Montana.That's one piece of kit I consider essential for these trips.

4942745,Mike Borger,2016-06-21 21:08:00,1554,"You would have fit right in my friend. And yeah, Spence was right."
4944513,fishron,2016-06-22 17:42:00,317,Great report Mike. Your pike were awesome and 5 to ten pound lakers will give you a great fight. It's interesting how the pike of Ontario and west have a more pronounced color pattern than the one's I catch in Quebec. I've seen photo's of European pike that have some stripe patterns toward the rear of their bodies. I suppose it's just a natural diversification within the species and not a separate species. They're a great sport fish and you had an epic trip. Tomorrow we head to Hebert in Quebec and I plan on spending some time tempting a few a the Quebec gators while I'm there.
4945265,Mike Borger,2016-06-23 05:52:00,1554,"Thanks man, and you're right on, some of those pike were really vividly colored!Hope your trip goes well, best of luck to you!"
4949321,kona77,2016-06-25 19:04:00,236,Another great adventure.. While I love catching big gators I would actually enjoy the high numbers of 5-10lb lakers. My arms were getting sore just thinking about those types of numbers.
