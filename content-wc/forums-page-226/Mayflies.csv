4946785,Skywagon,2016-06-24 05:28:00,1106,"Mayflies are covering my home office windows this morning and I can see them hanging off the soffit of the house. It looks like the hatch is in full swing at my location. Heading out to fish a small lake this morning, we may have to slightly change strategies."
4946825,Obabikon,2016-06-24 05:41:00,2370,"By the time they're on the surface, they aren't drastically affecting the fishing. Now, sometimes fish come up and feed on them, but the big impact is when they're the little larva swimming around the bottom/middle of the lake. Hopefully you miss the bad part of it, and have some awesome fishing! Good luck!"
4946961,jveri,2016-06-24 07:10:00,70,Where abouts in NW ontario you posting from Skywagon? Heading up there next thursday for 9 days
4946977,CI_Guy,2016-06-24 07:21:00,2118,We got back from Oak Island yesterday. The mayflies were thick the 5 days we were there but the fishing was good.
4948465,Skywagon,2016-06-25 06:42:00,1106,"We live in the Dryden area. Did not notice all that much mayfly evidence on the remote lake we fished yesterday. My wife and a friend kayaked on a different small lake late yesterday, she said fish were hitting the surface all over the place, I assume it was probably smallmouth after mayflies (as there are smallmouth in that particular lake) You will have missed the army worm plague by the time you get here, they have about run their course, the worm cycle probably peaked a week ago at our place. There were new army cocoons all over the place when I got home last night, preferable to the worm stage. As far as fishing yesterday, the surface water temps went from 70 degrees on the main lake to 74 degrees in the bays. We caught most of the fish in the 11'-14' range. Minnows were the bait of choice (did not take enough), struggled a little harder with plastic."
4948625,jveri,2016-06-25 08:24:00,70,"Thanks for the update skywagon, never heard of army worms before. We have been up north for some big mayfly hatches in the past and fishing was less than ideal for our group."
4948641,Golden Eagle,2016-06-25 08:46:00,2642,"Hatch doesn't ruin fishing, but may make you fish different than usual. Different parts of the lake experience hatch at different times. Moving water usually continues to offer good to excellent fishing. Hatch attracts all fish and there are usually some huge fish hanging around to eat a smaller whitefish or walleye."
4948737,andersaki,2016-06-25 10:09:00,1426,"The mayflies are hatching south of the border too, I just returned from Lake Vermilion last night. They were all over the surface. andersaki"
4949457,Bill Krejca,2016-06-25 22:27:00,6107,"The army worms are something you will encounter if you go to the north country very often. On one trip, the island we camped on some years ago was infested with army worms. You could not sit by the campfire without having them all over you. I will always remember frying fish and hearing a sudden sizzle - the short duration sound an army worm makes when dropping from a tree into hot grease. Never tried catching them and rolling in batter, maybe I missed a new treat. They pretty much shrivel up when fried. We literally had thousands of them in our camp area. After a while you got used to them, and just learned to ignore them. Bill"
4951177,bigwillies,2016-06-26 17:00:00,515,So are they done in our neck of the woods? Was at cedar this weekend and seen some around. Haven't been in a couple weeks. Hoping they are at the end and not the start. Army worms are pretty much done. Cocoons every where
