4938545,fergiefish,2016-06-20 07:05:00,197,We are heading up to Gold Pines a week from Friday and would appreciate any fishing reports in this area. Also looking for depths you are finding fish in and your most productive rigs. Any mayfly hatches occur yet? I look forward to responses.
4939393,Pooch,2016-06-20 12:09:00,4619,"Just returned Saturday night from Lac Seul Lodge. Fish are really scattered and it appeared most people were having good and bad days. We marked fish in the twenty five foot range (good arch's) but could not get them to bite. We also marked and caught a lot of fish in six to eight foot of water near sand and thick or thin weeds. Wind blowing into pockets was mostly productive as long as there was some deeper water fairly close by. East wind had fishing tough for several days, but I found a sandy corner of a bay with very scattered weed growth, strong wind blowing in for two days and put fifty fish in the boat fishing by myself a couple hours one morning. From eaters to a lot of over slots. Good mix of fish sizes. It was like that all week. Kind of a feast or famine thing.Had a really good spinner bite going on Manitoba Point one morning until wind died then so did the bite.I fished leeches and salted minnows all week. Either worked on any given day or morning/evening.Fished in and south of Farewell Bay all week.Lac Seul water is eighteen inches to two foot down from any of my past trips. Lots of new hazards.Pooch"
4939449,fergiefish,2016-06-20 12:23:00,197,"Thanks, Pooch. Were there any particular hazards on the way to Mackenzie to be aware of? I have most marked on my GPS that would be of concern to and from, but I certainly will be more cautious. Sounds like the wind swept shorelines will be the ticket as usual. Glad you had a good trip, and I can't wait for ours."

Fished Wenesaga for a bit this morning and eaters were biting but not much happening for bigger fish so far. Using leeches and minnows with no difference seen between them."
4945105,jgt24,2016-06-22 23:28:00,2,"PM sent....We were at Gold pines the first week of June. Tougher fishing than normal and fish were deeper, 17-22 feet that week which is a good 10 feet deeper than normal for that time of year. Good luck."
4945113,jgt24,2016-06-22 23:30:00,2,"The trip to McKenzie was fine. No new hazards. We went there one day and had the worst luck we've ever had there. Just go slow going through Shanty Narrows, we go left through there to the left of the stump if that makes sense. We know a guy that barrels through to the right however we don't. Water didn't seem any shallower through the narrows than any other year despite the water levels being down."
4945209,Northwoodswalleye,2016-06-23 05:13:00,262,I checked out a bunch of humps yesterday near goose island and sawmill bay. Found fish even a few bigger ones. Today is the last day and We are headed to steamboat to check things out there. Overall very disappointing fishing for this years trip. Plenty of eaters but the bigger fish eluded us this time.
4945841,fergiefish,2016-06-23 11:41:00,197,"Thank you sir. I think we will be in Steamboat quite a lot. We always make at least two runs to Mackenzie, and if that is the hot spot we will be down there more. Travel safely on your trip back."
