4943457,Mike Borger,2016-06-22 08:27:00,1554,"You will love the lake and the facility - especially if you're a walleye guy!Plastic paddletail minnows are literally all you need on a variety of jig heads. Northland Impulse paddletails in pearl white and electric chicken are favorites. Also Berkley Ripple Shads in the 31/2"" size in a variety of colors are super deadly. I realize saying that's all you'll need is a strong statement, but I'll stand by it. The fish are incredibly abundant and very easy to catch.The best spots we found on St. Joe were offshore humps out in the middle of nowhere. You had to keep your eye on your graph and anytime you'd find a hump, throw out a marker and work it. Those humps were all literally crawling with fish, most in the 18-22"" range, many larger."

4944041,stjoeguy,2016-06-22 13:02:00,979,"Davey, enjoy the trip! I know you'll have some great fishing. I'll be up at the St. Joe Winoga cabin in 3 days. We usually don't get down the lake as far as Eagle island so your fish are safe."
4944433,Daveygravy,2016-06-22 17:16:00,88,Thanks. I'm sure it will be great. Have yourself a great and safe trip. Let us know how you do.
4944465,Mike Borger,2016-06-22 17:20:00,1554,"Nice to hear, thanks! And it's my pleasure. You guys will love the experience with Slate Falls, there is zero doubt about that."
