A group of friends have booked a stay at Pine Point on Lac des Mille Lacs early September over Labor Day. This is a brand new body of water for me so I am curious as to what the expectations should be for this body of water at this time of year. Any tips regarding tactics, and tackle recommendations for this lake would be much appreciated. Also has anyone stayed at this resort before?? Thanks in advance!"
