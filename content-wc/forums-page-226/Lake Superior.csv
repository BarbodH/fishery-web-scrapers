4941857,pike50plus,2016-06-21 12:54:00,584,Why kill it??
4941865,Guest,2016-06-21 13:00:00,0,Why give up a great soot to others like that? Part of fishing is exploring for yourself.

4945153,Skyraptor,2016-06-23 04:27:00,291,Exactly!!!! Would of been better to take some photos and released it for another person to catch. Would of been a good way to teach a 6-year old CPR.
