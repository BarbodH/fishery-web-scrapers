Would anyone share some places on the River to fish near Ear Falls as we may just stay in town at a Motel. What could we expect as far as numbers in the river at that time. If you would rather personal message me that would be great also. I know people do not always like to give up hotspots and that is understandable but any help with the river would be appreciated. Are there hazards to watch for in that area also would be helpful. Thanks in advance guys!"

4951097,nwifisherman,2016-06-26 15:57:00,9,Check with Norm from Knotty Pines. I just got back from there and the fishing was phenomenal. He is an awesome guy and will do everything he can to make your stay perfect. It costs $600 per person for a week but that includes your minnows and gas for the week.
