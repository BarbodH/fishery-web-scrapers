4944257,jeffcob,2016-06-22 14:54:00,7,Thanks for the info and I am happy to say our group will be headed to Mylies Place the 1st week of october! Any thoughts on what to expect fishing wise?
4944297,fishpoop,2016-06-22 15:27:00,630,Mylies Place Resort Youtube channelhttps://www.youtube.com/user/MyliesPlaceResort All muskie videos but they're shot by the owner of Mylie's Place. And if you're interested in muskies you will learn a few things. I'm sure J-Man can put you on walleye and bass too if that's your pleasure.
4944337,Bill Krejca,2016-06-22 16:21:00,6107,"Expect good to very good walleye and crappie fishing, perhaps a muskie. Great time to be up there, leaves will be turning and birds heading south. Weather can range from shirt sleeve to parka, perhaps within a 24 hr period. I used to camp in Obabikon Lake this time of year, and it was spectacular in so many ways. Bill"
4915217,jeffcob,2016-06-10 06:22:00,7,Looking at making my first trip to LOTW this Fall and was wondering on what section of the lake would I target for good numbers of Walleye and not have to travel a gazillion miles to find them? Had looked into the Morson Area and Sioux Narrows area and found a couple of places within my budget (>$1000/wk) and found a couple of possibilities. Thanks for any input!
4915297,Thompmd,2016-06-10 06:50:00,320,"Congratulations!!, Let us know when you decide and I'm sure you will get some feedback. I have stayed in Nestor falls several times in June and this year we are going to a boat in place near Kenora. I'm not a walleye fisherman so I can help much(Jig/Minnow guy). LOTW is huge and I would suggest maps(I use the lake charts) and either a handheld GPS or mapping. I remember the first time I went guys told me 2-things for needing GPS lol: 1)after you get a mile from camp every @#$% island looks alike 2)one guy had fog set in after he left. arguably the best multi species lake in Ontario. Crappies are fantastic in the fall at times I hear. Send us a report when you return"
4915369,Redline,2016-06-10 07:14:00,73,"I've been going to Sioux Narrows for most my life. 20 some years, I'm 33 btw.It's a great place to start, but you still need to travel. I say that be cause that's what we've always done, and I'm sure you can have success closer, but we just never risk it. It's about a 40 min boat ride each way to our spots everyday. We fish in the Deadbroke area, which is the southern part of this map around Cliff, Mouse, Chisholm, Britannia, etc. I always go Mid June so I can't help with spots later in the year, but you get the idea. http://www.tomahawkresort.com/lakeof...ds/mapz2a1.cfm"
4915409,Shorelunch,2016-06-10 07:25:00,554,"Morson is a great part of the lake, too. Lots of great fall walleye and crappie fishing spots within 10-15 minutes of the area. I'd check out Mylie's, Buena Vista and Obabikon resorts for starters. Easy crossing from Baudette, too."
4915825,Guest,2016-06-10 09:12:00,0,"I really enjoy the Nestor falls area. Have been going there for the the past 15+ years and wouldn't change a thing (except better weather some years!). Any place on LOTW is going to be unbelievable but I always loved the falls. Most of our fishing is done within 10-15 minutes of camp. Great fishing of all different species, great family place. Couldn't think of a negative thing to say. Good luck wherever you go!"
4917873,ftfarms,2016-06-11 10:54:00,444,I'll say miles bay camp or tamarack island out of morson. I like rex toltons milesbay camp it's priced right it's in a great area. We do boat to little traverse bay most days but there's good fishing in Miles Bay and obabikon and around rabbit island.
4918065,MistyMoon,2016-06-11 13:48:00,2,"I agree with Thumped - make sure you have a good map if you aren't familiar with the area, and don't try to skimp! Get one of the nautical charts, it's a big lake with a lot of hazards, and a lot of great fishing habitat. I think that pretty much every resort has the appropriate map for the area. If you are fishing out of Morson, Chart #6214 covers all of Sabaskong bay and Miles bay, but if you want to go any farther west than the New Moon Lodge, you will need 6211 or 6215. Although the whole lake map (6201) is a nice chart, it doesn't have the same degree of detail that you will want. As for the fishing - I always fished lake trout on whitefish bay, so can't speak much about the walleye up there but I've heard good things about it; I was just fishing the Miles bay area over memorial day and had loads of fish as always. My 13 yo son caught a 27.5"" walleye and quite a few 18-19"" fish - needless to say, he's now sufficiently addicted!"
4919377,srj,2016-06-12 09:45:00,971,"I have a cabin on the U.S. side but fish with a friend out of his place at Morson. I think the Morson area has become arguably the best area on the lake. Many species and big fish of each. Everything but lake trout but if the portage is working you can get to Whitefish Bay for trout. There are fish to be caught all over but running a ways is enjoyable because of the beauty and the potential of better fishing. That said, if the weather is iffy, there literally are fish all over. To get a couple for the frying pan, our closest spot is well over 2 minutes away but certainly less than 3! The upper lake west of Yellow Girl MIGHT be a better walleye fishery but the Morson area is so diverse. Lake of the Woods is really special and there are no bad areas. You will enjoy wherever you end up. Good luck"
4920489,Lazy Fisherman,2016-06-12 16:08:00,276,"Jeff, We have fished out of Sioux Narrows for many years. Most of our trips are several miles from town. Yes, there is closer fishing, but the quality numbers are usually found west of Yellow Girl. Let us know what you decide and I am sure you will get some good info from this forum. Steve"
4921073,rjs1230,2016-06-12 18:53:00,21,"This will be year number 39 out of sioux narrows . Fishing keeps getting better every year . West of yellow girl , down sunset it really doesn't matter ."
