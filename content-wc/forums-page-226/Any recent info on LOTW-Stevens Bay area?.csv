Walleye fishing is solid, bass are still spawning in a few areas and the pike fishing is still consistent. This was near Kenora as of last Friday. I also pulled the 14day weather yesterday and it showed Mid 70.s for highs so I would expect fish to be on the move.We leave in a couple weeks so please send a report when you get back.Good luck"
