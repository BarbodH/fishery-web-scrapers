4947681,Guest,2016-06-24 12:41:00,0,Anyone done any fishing in Northern Alberta for pike & walleye? I've searched and found a few flyouts from Ft McMurray. I'm spending time in NW Montana in the next few summers so a drive to Edmonton and then Northern Alberta could be pretty easy. I'm not looking for the big boy named places up here (Gangler's has been mentioned in NW Manitoba recently) - some smaller outfitter recommendations would be helpful. This would be a year or two out but never to early to plan.
