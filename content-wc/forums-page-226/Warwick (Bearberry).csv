4949593,DavKin,2016-06-26 05:48:00,104,"Hoppy, I can help you out. We fished BB in early Sept. The last 5 yrs. or so. We are going to Hornby this year for a change of pace. The two portage lakes, Bullock and Copper, can be good too. Our group tends to lindy rig with crawler/salted minnow with hook or floating jig; plus vertical jig 1/4 or 3/8 lead head in pink or chartreuse; 18 to 30' deep. Cabins are comfortable. Boats and motors can show some wear that time of year. I'll mark up a map and pm you. Good luck, Dave"
