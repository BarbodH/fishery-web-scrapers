4948481,fishinnut 3446,2016-06-25 07:07:00,638,"That's about what I was getting to, and when pro v said they have to get back ? and running with no lights"
4948561,prov1800,2016-06-25 07:42:00,5010,Iam sure there equipment is working propetly.
4916633,fishlipz09,2016-06-10 15:55:00,26,I know there is no night fishing on Eagle but regulations are not real clear on exactly what that means. I have been told 1/2 hour past legal sunset to 1/2 hour before legal sunrise. Does anyone know for sure if this is correct?
4917041,v-bay gord,2016-06-10 19:13:00,3168,That is correct.
4917169,fishinnut 3446,2016-06-10 20:30:00,638,Gord if this IS correct why is it I could be sitting on the pier having a cold and hearing boats going across the Bay to AML ?
4917241,v-bay gord,2016-06-10 21:21:00,3168,Maybe they could respond to that question. Send them a link to this and see what they say.......
4917417,BornToFish,2016-06-11 05:52:00,1224,"Does the law speak to night ""boating"" versus night ""fishing""?"
4917601,prov1800,2016-06-11 07:47:00,5010,Still need to get back from where ever you were fishing.long as the lights are on.no law against being out on the lak att dark.
4917665,uv2021,2016-06-11 08:27:00,48,"I don't night fish,but why would they have that regulation?"
4917737,prov1800,2016-06-11 09:42:00,5010,Eagle has always had a great night time bite as most lakes do.in thd old days wit huge limits no size restrictions and the commercual fishing going on for many years the fishing got real bad and something needed to be done.and it was.and fishing has improved 500%.awesome fishery.i just spent a week guiding at north shore lodge and wadnt very hard to find a 100 fish a day but back in thd mid 80 s that would have been tough thing to do.unheard of actually.
4946401,kcguy68,2016-06-23 17:00:00,51,"I remember fishing Viking Reef as a kid in the early 80's.....AT NIGHT. People were catching huge walleye. Back in those days the limit on both walleye and northern were 6 each. I can't believe we made that trek down the lake in the dark. The number of boats that were out there was unbelievable. Saying all that, I prefer the way things are now. Things were out of control in those days."
4946441,prov1800,2016-06-23 17:17:00,5010,Still a lot of that going on.just till dusk now.still a good bite just before dark.just gets busy at some of those spots they go to.not my kind of thing jockeing for position.
