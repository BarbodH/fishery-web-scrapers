4711466,RickOnt,2016-04-06 16:47:00,217,Good chatting with ya today!!!
4711538,RickOnt,2016-04-06 17:00:00,217,Is food supplied at the outpost?? or Where do you buy/pick up supplies for the week?
4711802,spoonchucker,2016-04-06 18:14:00,82,"There are grocers in Winnipeg who fill your order and it goes up on the charter flight from winnipeg to Elk Island and then on to Edmund in the outfitter's plane. It turned out to be pretty easy. I can get you the name of the store we used and as I recall they were real glad to do it. I think they deliver it right to Cargo at the airport but I have to check my files for details if you need it. My guess is Greg will be helpful too. We flew Toronto to Winnipeg ( pretty cheap with the Can $) and did not do any overnite in Winnipeg. The outpost cabin is really the old lodgeowner's house- if you read the story- it was an AM plan lodge that went broke so the guest cabins are all boarded up. The outpost has wifi and good shower and flush toilet ( needs some help with a pitcher of water sometimes) but full generator electricity. I have been in better cabins but many worse. This one was really quite comfortable and the boats and motors ran without a hitch. The numbers of pike are unbelievable and they were more voracious than any I had ever seen. The story about one following my son's lure then jumping out of the water to take my spoon hanging over the side is true and it was about 36 inches as I recall. I had been there in 1994 when it was Am plan lodge and I always thought the lodge thing with time out for long shore lunch and breakfast and in by 5 for dinner and mandatory guide was crazy and thought at the time how it would be great to fish this lake on my own terms some time, so when we learned the it had become an outpost and that instead of 30 guests it was down to a max group of 10 and being fished by mostly smaller groups on a limited basis we jumped at it. Used all single hook barbless and spoons or spinners with trailer tails. skimmed on top of the weeds and watched them come up and hit the lure. Hope to go back."

4917817,BrianE,2016-06-11 10:29:00,98,Spoonchucker....do you know anyone who's been to the Kistigan outpost at Elk Island?

4944441,Mike Borger,2016-06-22 17:18:00,1554,Kistigan is a lake I've received some pretty interesting intel on. Let's just say I've heard good things. Can tell you for sure it's very shallow and it's really only worthwhile the first month of the season. After that it's a mat of weeds.Quote: Originally Posted by pike50plushttps://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...d.php?t=560513Sammy - you should have been there. But then you wouldn't be coming to Tazin in July. We're going to do some serious damage at Tazin trust me.
4944521,BrianE,2016-06-22 17:45:00,98,Thanks for the info regarding Kistigan Mike appreciate it.
4704850,pike50plus,2016-04-04 19:33:00,584,When I first went to Stevens-Nicklin about 15 years ago I talked with Spence on the plane ride back to the Peg and he claimed Maria was a top notch Pike and Laker place?
4705106,Mike Borger,2016-04-04 20:37:00,1554,"It remains to be seen what the fishing is like but I do know we'll have a heck of a time regardless. One thing I can say, I deal with a lot of outfitters and I've been impressed with Gangler's already. Extremely professional confirmation email within an hour of confirming the trip with every single detail of the trip laid out. Then today in the mail I received another letter along with luggage tags from Gangler's so all of our stuff can be marked in advance of our arrival in Winnipeg.I get the impression they run a very well organized operation."
4706490,RickOnt,2016-04-05 09:35:00,217,"Pike50plus I would really like to hear/see more about Clifton How was the fishing, equipment, camp, does the supplied food include meat, dairy, etc?? Thanks"
4707490,pike50plus,2016-04-05 14:11:00,584,sent you a pm with my numbers
4707986,Larry S,2016-04-05 16:55:00,665,"Mike, I hope you have a great time at Ganglers. In 1997 I had the Worst Experience I have every had with an Outfitter in My 40 Some Years going to Canada at Ganglers Reindeer Lake Lodge"
4708410,Mike Borger,2016-04-05 18:26:00,1554,"Holy cow Larry, what happened?Gangler's sold the lodge on Reindeer to buy their operation on the North Seal, so it's been a while.What about you, where are you fishing this year?"
4710274,spoonchucker,2016-04-06 10:51:00,82,"We had incredible fishing at Edmund Lake, the outpost for Elk Island Lodge. I personally caught 5 master angler pike in our four days of fishing there. I got a call from Greg Dick who owns the lodge back in February that he had the six days at end of July and begnning of August open at Edmund from a cancellation and gave me an excellent pricing of 1600$ from Winnipeg with flights, boats etc included. My group had already booked a different trip because we were too big for Edmund to accomadate, but you might want to see if that suits you better than having to change Lakes and wondering about the reputation of the outfitter. Walleyes are very plentiful at Edmund but you go there for pike. .http://www.onthewater.com/canadian-d...-pike-fishing/ I have given you the web article on our trip published in On the Water Magazine."
4710330,spoonchucker,2016-04-06 11:00:00,82,"When you go that web refernce you may have to type in the search term canadian or edmund,"
4710362,Mike Borger,2016-04-06 11:04:00,1554,Edmund is on my short list too. I've actually been talking with Greg about a trip there for well over 3 years now. For whatever reason I haven't been able to make it happen but I will.

4696514,pike50plus,2016-04-02 07:03:00,584,"I have fished Clifton ( 2 of the last 3 years) and Stevens-Nickilin almost 20 years ago. Looking for anyone who has fished SN, maria or Burnie in the last 5-10 years? Willing ot share maps and hot spots. The Guide"
4696666,Mike Borger,2016-04-02 07:42:00,1554,"Sam, are you the guide now? I'd be curious to know who's fished Gangler's myself."
4696834,pike50plus,2016-04-02 08:25:00,584,"Most of the kids that have gone on the trips are sons of ex-student/football players of mine and their Dad's usually refer to me a ""the guide"" of the entire trip because I usually do all the planning and organizing. Does make me feel good at 69!"
4696978,Guest,2016-04-02 09:09:00,0,"I fished Bain last year if you have any interest in that. Great walleye fishing 20""-26"", and good trout fishing 30""-37"". Plenty of northerns but we did not catch any over 38""."
4696994,Mike Borger,2016-04-02 09:18:00,1554,I knew that. You'd be an awesome guide I think.
4698466,pike50plus,2016-04-02 19:13:00,584,"not sure I will end up at bain. I have July 30 to Aug 6th now at SN, but my 3 others backed out so I may have to switch to maria or Burnie. Burnie maybe if I get a second or stay at SN."
4699202,new hips,2016-04-03 06:41:00,498,I fished Maria.......not impressed.
4700098,getting old,2016-04-03 11:16:00,2,"We fished Ganglers in 2001 at their Mini-Camp at Maria. It was OK for smaller northerns,grayling and lake trout. The latter could be caught right in front of the camp while we were there in the first week of July.To get big northerns we had to do a triple portage to Carin. That lake was full of 36"" to 45"" northerns and the occasional lake trout.In one small bay you could see numerous northerns laying all around you as some would say "" like cordwood"".At Maria to get to walleyes we were told you had to make a ""triple portage from ****"" to get to a lake where they were. Suffice to say we did not do that. Maria has no walleyes."
4702818,KSjim,2016-04-04 09:25:00,88,"My son and I fished at Maria in 2006. We wanted to try some lake trout fishing but did not want to give up walleye fishing for the entire week. Maria has no walleye but management assured us that their walleye portage lake was so good that we would want to fish it a minimum of two days, maybe three!On arrival the camp manager gave us the same ""triple portage"" story as mentioned above. He also added that the first boat leaked so bad we needed to make sure the two bailing cans he put in the boat were still there before pushing off. He went on to tell us that the bears were so bad across one of the portages he would loan us a shotgun to take with us. You can probably guess how many times we went to the walleye portage lake.But hey, the lake trout fishing was fun until we had motor problems.On arrival the camp manager told us the motor on our boat was the only working motor in camp but that they would be flying in working motors the next morning.When we had motor problems on the fourth day there was no longer any working motors in camp! We managed to limp back to camp and I could go on, but at this point you can also probably guess how many times we have fished with Ganglers since."
4704714,Mike Borger,2016-04-04 18:47:00,1554,"Interesting thanks guys. My group is fishing Maria June 4-11 this year, will be interesting to see how we make out.For those that have been there before you might be surprised to know Ken Gangler says walleye are gaining a foothold in Maria. He specifically asked me to fish for them and try to figure things out. I'm going to fall on the sword and do just that. I'm looking forward to the portage lakes!"
