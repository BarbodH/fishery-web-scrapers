6677548,adempsey2.0,2022-08-05 12:19:00,611,Interesting. I have not seen one of those before. It reminds me of a Storm lure I bought quite a ways back.
6677318,Eckohlt,2022-08-03 18:39:00,3685,"Now you know the rest of the story!!you don't need to take much,,,GOODAY!!!!"
6677322,rpbadger,2022-08-03 18:57:00,22,"An insanely good lure, which I would say is equivalent to a jig/minnow is the Rapala Jigging Rap. Walleye and Pike. Big ones."
6677386,Walleye2242,2022-08-04 07:12:00,263,"We use to go to Canada with 2 huge tackle box's a piece. Rapala, thin fins, lay ike's.....loaded with lures. Now I head up with a small box of Jig's and a few little joe's. That is all I take."
6677390,Lovetofish,2022-08-04 07:35:00,458,"My Canada tackle box now days consists of jigs/twisters, spinners/weights, and a handful of Cleo spoons with steel leaders."
6677402,Net_Man,2022-08-04 09:27:00,580,"I will go one step further. More times then I would like to admit the Jigging Rap will out produce the jig/minnow. Sure, you can always just hold a jig/minnow over the side of the boat and catch fish but varied presentations within the boat generally shows you the most productive presentation for the time frame. Unfortunately the cost of loosing a Jigging Rap in the rocks is a bit costlier than a jig.I was also schooled this spring on Rainy Lake by a fishing partner using a Ripping Rap. The fish want what the fish wants......On the opposite side of things - I was previously on a fly-in trip and the walleyes were biting pretty good. I was using a jig with plastic but with one of the bites my plastic was gone just leaving me with a painted jig head. I casted this plain jig back out and sped up my retrieve. 13 walleyes later and and a slowed down bite I added the plastic back on to my jig.If I had only one option it would be a jig/minnow or with plastics but I would not leave home with out the Jigging and Ripping raps."
6677442,NM_Trout,2022-08-04 18:45:00,1094,OK. I'll bite. Which color jigging rap?
6677446,Net_Man,2022-08-04 19:15:00,580,"Since we are on a Canada thread - This will vary depending on lake and if it is cloudy or sunny. I like chrome red but if it sunny out the chrome blue would be my first option. However, if I were fishing on Green Bay (Wisconsin) these 2 colors would not be in my first several choices."
6677466,RichA$1970,2022-08-04 21:16:00,1159,"I haven’t figured out a jigging rap as I’ve vertically jigged, casted and drifted mine along with a Mooneye jigging minnow with no luck. I know Al Lindner pimps jiggin raps all the time but I’d take a jig & twister tail anyday."
6677470,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2022-08-04 21:51:00,240,"One thing I have done the past few years is to spend some time fishing an 'old-school' walleye or pike lure for a few hours. For example, I still have a few of those 'june-bug spinners' which were so popular back in the early '70s, tipped with a larger minnow. Also have some of those 'lindy spin rig' lures from back in the day. For pike, I have spent some time trolling an old wooden pikie minnow, which still catches lots of fish. Fishing with those old lures from the Holiday Station stores way back in the early '70s... Fishing with these old tackle box staples is like a portal back in time...... I can still remember reading those 1960's Outdoor Life magazines, back when articles in those magazines were as much about cooking a shore lunch as they were about the more technical aspects of fishing. Saganaga Lake, at the end of the Gunflint Trail, on the Minnesota/Ontario border. Countless articles on drive-to fishing in Ontario, and, later, the articles about fly-in fishing. Sabourin Lake, which borders my favorite Ontario lake, Larus Lake. Dog Lake, in the Algoma region. As I read those articles back in the day, I promised myself that I was going to be able to go on these trips. And, in many cases, I did just that. Thanks for reading all this. Hope I am not rambling too much!"
6677544,7 Mag,2022-08-05 11:03:00,1887,"I prefer Rapala slab raps over jigging raps, i've done well with jigging raps but i like the lipless design of the slab rap, the action is hard for a walleye to pass up."
6677230,NETim1187,2022-08-03 09:36:00,166,Northland has their Rumble crankbaits on sale. Just thought I'd help.
6677236,NM_Trout,2022-08-03 09:52:00,1094,"Get behind me Satan. (and not in the ""hey, give me a push"" sort of way)"
6677252,valley366,2022-08-03 11:47:00,193,"Glad it is not only me with the problem. I have my general tackle back with 6 3600 trays in it. Mainly walleye stuff. Then I have my pike back that has 4 3700 trays of spoons, spinners and crank baits. Then I have my plastics bag that holds probably 100 different bags of plastics. Then there is the Walleye crank bait bag with 4 more 3700 trays. That is just the stuff that goes in the boat. In the truck I have another couple hundred jigs in various colors. Because believe it or not some years they just key on a certain color.For rods have the same problem. 2 jigging rods, 1 medium for trolling, one medium for casting and normally 1 MH for pike. And some extras in the truck.I have passed this genetic defect to my son. 13yo that now thinks he needs his own tackle bags.Have also trimmed down on clothes. Used to bring several pairs of pants. Then realized most trips I am just changing pants as routine and not that dirty. They are under rain pants most days.Glad we choose the 18 foot boats at Five Lakes."
6677256,JAY221,2022-08-03 12:24:00,877,"The daughter and husband crossed on july 22 and the border guard asked how are you going to fish? She tells him my dad crossed last Friday with enough stuff for 10 people. He chuckled and sent them on their way. Later, Jay"
6677290,eyecatcher1,2022-08-03 15:47:00,323,Walleyes on Lac Seul like cheetos on a jig. We learned that a few years ago when we ran out of minnows and leeches.
6677304,Eckohlt,2022-08-03 16:56:00,3685,"I would think a Cheeto would desolve in water,maybe your using the new Cheetos pork rind?"
6677308,eyecatcher1,2022-08-03 17:22:00,323,"Regular cheetos. They were biting so good that day they didn't have time to melt. Only one guy tried them for a while, but he did catch some walleyes on them."
6677310,Eckohlt,2022-08-03 17:38:00,3685,Wiggle a Cheeto in front me I'll clobber it!!Big fish on.
6677312,walleyecheek,2022-08-03 17:47:00,2231,I like when your coming back across and the US border patrol security guard says.......how were the Fish Biting ? And i say .....With their Mouth........ LOL
6677316,Sylvanboat,2022-08-03 18:23:00,94,My son and Ijust got back from NW Ontario. I brought everything imaginable for walleye and all they wanted was a jig and minnow.
6631336,nitroman,2022-02-07 07:11:00,368,Most lures are designed to catch fisherman! but I suffer the same
6631698,SweetD,2022-02-08 18:17:00,243,That was a **** funny post ansmd sooooo true for most of us!!!!
6631768,gordy28,2022-02-09 06:08:00,437,This is me to a tee! Overall I would rather have the new lure that is all the rage and not need it than be on a fly in watching my brother slay the fish on it! Great post Andrew
6631784,nitroman,2022-02-09 07:14:00,368,Out of my group I am the only one on this board. So my question to you all is when you read about the hot new lure do you share it with your group or do you buy it(plus spares) and keep it on the down low?
6631826,NM_Trout,2022-02-09 10:09:00,1094,"We usually share info. This has come back to bite me though. I was float tube fishing a trout lake in Colorado with friends, and I was catching fish; they were not. I gave them what I was using, and this became a go-to fly for one of my friends. A year later, she fished that pattern and landed 87 trout in one day, I caught 22. I ain't telling her nothing from now on."
6631880,SweetD,2022-02-09 13:54:00,243,"No freaking way I’m sharing initial lure intel. If it works as advertised…….”greatest multi-species fish catching lure of all time” then by god I’m going to keep it to myself and then use it as a bartering tool while in the bush. For example for one of my hi-fi twister-ma-tails you need to get my cocktails this evening…..ice, mix, pour and deliver!!!!It’s amazing what people will do for the hot lure! In reality I’m confident its just my superb fish catching capabilities that make the difference but don’t let that out to my crew!!! &#x1f601;"
6631886,Rock Hound,2022-02-09 15:08:00,51,"I too buy a few of the latest and greatest before a trip - it is part of the excitement build up! But I almost always use just a few jigs and a few rigs for the entire trip. Sometimes, and I mean sometimes, I will even try one of the dozens and dozens of crankbaits that I own (but rarely use). I am sure I bring about $1,800 in tackle every trip and only use about $18 worth! I also bring about 15 rods (we go to a drive to destination, not fly-in outpost) on every trip and use the same 2 or 3 all week! Gear and tackle are a vice for me, but I guess there could be other things that are far worse that I could be indulging myself with! I love fishing (and fishing stuff)! Is it June yet? PS When my sons come with me, they simply bring 1 rod . . . they know I will have enough of everything else for them to use! PSS I have reduced the amount of clothes I bring to Canada - that was a major accomplishment for me!"
6632086,Mojo-NC,2022-02-10 09:07:00,1929,"It's one of our running jokes each year at camp. I probably bring more tackle than anyone else in my group. Whenever I really get into the fish on something unique from my tackle box, it doesn't matter if I have a dozen of them, I always tell the guys that it's the last one I have. That drives up the price considerably for camp trading, be it for beers or taking my next turn at washing the dishes. In reality, I share whatever I have to help everyone catch as many fish as possible. That's why we're up there isn't it?"
6632096,NM_Trout,2022-02-10 09:57:00,1094,"I do this now too. Instead of changes of clothes, I just bring a bag of oxyclean and plan on rinsing some clothes mid trip. It dropped the bulk of gear substantially. In the boat I'm usually wearing rain pants anyway. I get by with two pairs of jeans, 4 tshirts and some fleece outerwear for the week."
6632392,nitroman,2022-02-11 06:59:00,368,"I too may suffer from excessive tackle collector syndrome! I have a primary box with stuff that has proven effective and a secondary box full of lures that caught me but not many fish. It's fun when you lay into em and the guys start asking what your using and then try to replicate it. Every year I try new ""hot "" lures but then fall bag to jigs and some spoons. Some years they are really ""hot"" some not. I do love to see people catch fish and hope it adds to the excitement of their trip and makes them want to come back each year so I do share with our group as well as other guests that may be struggling in camp. That's not to say I don't keep a few tricks up my sleeve Friend of mine gave me the hot tip on this years hot lure, swears it's the best walleye lure he has ever fished, I now have 4 in my box for this season and will probably buy some for my wife and kid for this year as well. Time will tell if they are successful and maybe I should keep a couple more spares as I like that bartering idea!"
6631196,NM_Trout,2022-02-06 13:52:00,1094,Thanks for the reminder. I likely need a whole bunch of new lead weights too.
6631204,RichA$1970,2022-02-06 14:46:00,1159,"I have gotten it down to a 3600 series weekend bag for Canada. 1 box for walleye, 1 for pike and 1 with jigs n spinners. I fish with a guy who brings a foot locker and he spends more time with his line out of the water than in it."
6631208,Yellowfin123,2022-02-06 14:58:00,2182,are those big tube jigs for lake trout??
6631216,Mojo-NC,2022-02-06 15:21:00,1929,"Wait, are y'all saying that I don't need the 60 or so spinner rigs that I just made over the past few weeks while simultaneously totally trashing our dining room table in the process? And I also don't really need to bring my tackle box fully loaded, because if so it would certainly help me keep from going over the airline weight restrictions while flying up there. A ziplock bag of a few jigs and a couple of paper towels is really all I need? Say it ain't so!!!"
6631218,Timmer92,2022-02-06 15:52:00,451,"You never know that they are biting on at the moment - crank bait, swim bait, blade, jig, spinner, spoon, etc. Also it's not just the lure, but what color they are interested in that day! And you need one for everyone in your boat. This is why I converted a chest freezer into a Musky tackle box!"
6631228,Eckohlt,2022-02-06 16:32:00,3685,On a flyin trip bring something that wiggles and something that stinks that's all you need.
6631262,NM_Trout,2022-02-06 18:56:00,1094,"If you saw the folks I fish with, you'd know you would need to narrow that down a little bit more."
6631270,prov1800,2022-02-06 19:22:00,5010,They sure are plus the vibratos are excellent for walleye and trout.
6631274,pjshorthorn,2022-02-06 19:29:00,5654,I guess the “Eckohlt ” bait has officially been unveiled for sale ?PjShorthorn
6631330,Eckohlt,2022-02-07 07:00:00,3685,"Not for sale,just have to be in my boat to get one of a kind of stink baits,alittle secret between you and I pj it has to do with a pair of well worn tidy whites."
6631144,NM_Trout,2022-02-06 10:28:00,1094,"Every time. As I spool up my gear for a much anticipated Canada trip, I realize that I don't have some things that ""I have heard about"". Usually because this time of year I get such horrendous cabin fever that I am on you tube watching fishing videos. And then I panic.What if I get up to that outpost, and after spending all that time and money, what I really needed was a 4.25"" Berkley Dorsal Fin Dominator lure, or a chartreuse electric Impulse pike smasher? AND I DONT HAVE THEM??? Well, I better get some quick, before everybody else on WC buys them out. Then I get up to the outpost, and the fish are biting on pine cones and pull tops from beer cans and it just doesn't matter that I have $500 of high tech coffee-scented-salt-infused-polymer plastics with UV reflective eyes and lifelike action. Still. It pays to be prepared (my wife would say that I should replace the word ""pays"" with ""costs"")."
6631148,Eckohlt,2022-02-06 10:33:00,3685,"Don't wry someday you'll learn,it doesn't take much to catch fish in Ontario."
6631150,NM_Trout,2022-02-06 10:46:00,1094,Oh.. I've learned it. Been going up for 20 years now :-) This is purely unjustifiable reflex buying. I have so much left over plastic and jig heads in my local boat that when I back that thing into the lake the water level rises noticeably.
6631152,kettyspanky,2022-02-06 10:46:00,271,We mostly fish perch on our ontario trips. We get some jigs and hooks and a few leadheads and we are ready to go. I usually buy something new every year for walleye and bass. Really I go overboard but not bad. I'm always thinking I need more of this or that but don't. It's fun getting ready for the trip and can't wait till it happens. Good luck out there.
6631154,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2022-02-06 10:51:00,240,"It's a ritual that never ever gets old............a big part of enjoying the Canada trips is living them before you leave. Maybe a new fillet knife, a few packs of those new VMC jigheads, some new boot-tail plastics, a new pair of guide pants from Kuiu, and maybe a new Lew's custom pro reel, just because it's on sale. Most of us are helpless to resist...."
6631164,Yellowfin123,2022-02-06 11:54:00,2182,"outpost fly in lake? just bring some slip weights, paper towels, hooks, and you'll be good, you just tear a piece of paper towel off and wad it up and put it on the hook, should be limited out by 8:30"

If you use bait, maybe add a dozen spinners, and then a few sinkers and swivels. All said, I'd guess 90% of all Canada walleyes are caught on jigs. Doesn't make for an exciting shopping list, but it is what it is. I recall a couple fly-ins when I just took a pocket caddy and a couple dozen jigs. Never felt I short changed myself."
