I have used my Iphone before but I don't want to be fumbling around with that again."
6678048,Thunder Bay Walleye,2022-08-07 19:13:00,56,I mount my gopros on the gunnels for the majority of my video's. Where you point the cameras is up to you as the action happens or where you think the action will happen. You will need gopro or similar clamp mounts. A head mount is handy and works well if you don't have clamp mounts. An extendable selfie type stick is also handy for unusual shots or even under water video's. Having a remote control to turn the camera/s on and off or to change some settings without reaching for or removing the camera from it's mounting positions. I have tried to include some pics to show where I mount on my 14 footer. I hope they show up. One other accessory you should have is a good microphone setup. I don't know what gopro model you will be using but for my hero 3's a mic is a necessity for clear audio. If you want all day action shots you may need lots of batteries and a way to charge them.
