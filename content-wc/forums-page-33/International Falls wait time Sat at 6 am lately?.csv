6678758,That Minnesota guy,2022-08-10 14:54:00,8293,"I haven't heard of any terrible wait times all summer. Go with the idea it will be a hour, if quicker you will be happy, if longer you'll be surprised. Enjoy the trip, this week has been the nicest weather we have had all summer up here."
6678762,oly67,2022-08-10 15:07:00,241,"Two weeks ago, at the worst time, noon on Sat, had to wait 2 hours."
6678768,That Minnesota guy,2022-08-10 15:29:00,8293,So that was terrible? You'll figure it out.
6678780,oly67,2022-08-10 16:21:00,241,Just booked one in Fort Frances.

Maximum wait time might have been 30 minutes or less on Saturday morning. On a side note, the changes taking place in IF are amazing for the traveler. Highway 53 in town in paved and easy to drive on. New name brand hotels are going up as are gas stations. Much more tourist friendly."
6678868,JDP,2022-08-11 07:24:00,1457,Last Saturday (August 7th) the wait time at 1pm was 55 minutes.
