6663480,pjshorthorn,2022-06-10 14:08:00,5654,I have had an enhanced license from every state that I've lived in ..if they offered it. Best thing going at a minimal cost in my opinion. PjShorthorn
6663724,Skywagon,2022-06-12 04:35:00,1106,"My American niece crossed into Canada on Tuesday with just a birth certificate and drivers license since her passport was expired, she had no problem. US Customs had told her it may or may not take a little longer to clear back into the US, but not to worry about it. She is heading home this afternoon, I'll report back if she has any issues."
6664304,Skywagon,2022-06-14 05:24:00,1106,"My niece crossed back into the US at International Falls on Sunday afternoon with just a birth certificate, she reported back to us that there was no problem going back in."
6664324,Lmbkiller,2022-06-14 06:15:00,639,So now huntindave can give it a rest
6664416,a_hershy,2022-06-14 09:24:00,36,"Thankful for the updates. I can report back on our experience in the weeks to come. Thanks, all!"
6677812,a_hershy,2022-08-06 19:08:00,36,"Update: just wrapped up our '22 trip. Had no issues getting across the border, either way, using just birth certificate for my daughter. Couldn't have hurt that she was traveling with both me and her mom. But no additional questions or delay."
6678238,1shooter,2022-08-08 14:32:00,1493,My aunt and uncle crossed last year with a MN Drivers License and a expired passport. When they got to the border they didn't realize their passports had expired......the got lucky.
6678372,elway12,2022-08-08 21:12:00,335,My mom(70+) did not have and did not receive her passport (1st one she has ever applied for) until AFTER we had been on our trip even though she had paid for expedited AND it was over 12 weeks later...anyway. To answer your question. She was allowed to cross with just her drivers license and her birth certificate. They did ask her few more questions and it seemed like it was something they didn't necessarily like to do but she was allowed to cross. The enhanced drivers license didn't mean anything to them.
6678424,Walleye2242,2022-08-09 07:47:00,263,I crossed last year with an expired passport and expired out of state license plates. they asked if it was a rental car and i said no....i just moved and have not got plates yet.
6678436,3M TA3,2022-08-09 08:17:00,2846,"Well like yourself, I'm guessing your Mom is from Arizona as well. Arizona does not have an enhance driver's license and that's probably why they stated hers didn't mean anything to them. No enhance Driver's License in Arizona."
6663270,a_hershy,2022-06-09 18:21:00,36,I know you've been able to cross the border with a birth certificate & driver's license in the past. Anyone done so since the border reopening? (along with the new requirements)My 16yr daughter has decided she wants to join our July trip and there is no time left to get her a passport.
6663274,NM_Trout,2022-06-09 18:52:00,1094,"No. She needs a passport : https://www.us-passport-service-guid...passports.html However, you might be able to expedite if you jump on it right now. Check here and scroll down to ""expedite"":https://www.us-passport-service-guid...port-card.htmlhttps://www.rushmypassport.com/?utm_campaign Good luck."
6663322,Lmbkiller,2022-06-09 20:42:00,639,"Doesn't need a passport. No one does. 2 forms of id as an adult. Birth cert fine for under 18. No need to sweat, bring her everything will be fine"
6663366,h8go4s,2022-06-10 05:41:00,1673,"Get the facts from the Canadian government, rather than opinions from fishing forums. Just one detail from the page referenced below:""You must use ArriveCAN to provide mandatory travel information before and after your entry into Canada.""https://www.canada.ca/en/border-serv...arrivecan.html"
6663374,Lmbkiller,2022-06-10 05:58:00,639,"Yes I wouldn't listen to someone that's crossed 56 times in their life either. What would they know about it. And it's never been a requirement to have a passport to get into canada. The us likes to say it is a requirement to get back into the us but that's also not true. If u can prove u are an American citizen they must let u back into the us. I will say that having a passport certainly makes it much easier, but it's not a requirement"
6663386,Huntindave,2022-06-10 06:37:00,2194,"Give it a rest. While your information may be true, it is impractical and ill advised."
6663398,a_hershy,2022-06-10 07:27:00,36,"Thanks guys.Might need to refine my question a bit.I have called the Canada Border Services Agency regarding the use of birth certificate/DL and have confirmed that my daughter can use them, along with vax record & ArriveCan, to cross.I have crossed several times using my passport, including last August. But I am hoping those that have successfully crossed without one can give me some idea of what to expect with my daughter. Especially interested in hearing from those that have done since Border reopening last year.PM if preferred"
6663422,stumcfar,2022-06-10 09:25:00,451,Minnesota's enhanced DL works too.
6663462,CI_Guy,2022-06-10 12:17:00,2118,"Last fall one member of our party without a passport crossed with his Birth Certificate, D.L. and Vac. cardWith the ArriveCan app. it was easy to get into Canada. None of us were even selected for random testing.Getting back into the USA probably took about 1/2 hour longer without his passport. We had to pull over and wait while they checked out his documents. That was at International Falls/Fort Frances.Pretty much the same as before COVID, easy to get into Ontario but you might have a delay getting back into the US about 1 out of 4 times."
6663478,Old Timer,2022-06-10 14:00:00,255,"Hershey: In response to your revised request, I crossed over with children last August. Because they were UNDER the age of sixteen all that was required of them was a CERTIFIED birth certificate, not a copy. The agent said something more would be required once they reached age sixteen. As for what you were told when you made your call to the border authorities I hope the person you spoke to is the agent when you cross over. As you know, each agent seems to have a broad range of authority as to whom he/she does or does not allow through. As some have said here, it's not wise to rely on opinions or experiences of other WC posters. Mine included."
