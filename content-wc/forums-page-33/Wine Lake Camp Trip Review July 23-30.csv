This was our second trip to WLC this year and what a difference between the two. Since our first trip this year for opening week the water has receded a good four feet. Even so, the walleye were just beginning to school as the week wrapped up. While we had a great week for numbers, our largest walleye was only 23 1/4. Others in camp caught many in the 28 range but we did not. However, we easily pulled hundreds of fish in through the week. The jiggers did the best as the back trollers had a little tougher time. I am so impressed by the recovery the Wine Lake Camp team has performed. A whole new dock has replaced the old one that twisted and came off the moorings during the flood. All the same, the camp was running at top knotch and as usual the service was tremendous. I love this place and we are scheduled for second week of June next year in our newly favorite cabin, The Icehouse, The best lake view in NW Ontario is the Icehouse. Fish ON! Hooks"

Even though the lake has not been fished for a couple of years, it was hard to fish with the high water. With normal water it should be more back to normal. We will be there the week of June 3rd next year. I agree the Ice House Cabin is awesome for 4 or less people. I went in it and was impressed. Scott"
