(get it for everyone in your vehicle if you travel with your family or the same group of guys) Your ArriveCan will link to your NEXUS and all you need to show is the Nexus card. IF the card scanner is working as you approach the booth, some of the agents don't even look much at the Nexus card. Went up in June with my son and two grandsons, all of us have Nexus. Two separate ArriveCan, one for me, one for Joe & the boys. PAINLESS and fast. Went up in July with my old buddy Doc, both with Nexus. Two separate ArriveCan, he did his at the breakfast diner an hour south of the border on the way up. less than 30 seconds in the booth. Charlie"
6676908,[emailÂ protected],2022-08-01 20:34:00,3,"Yes, good idea. Four of us went across one did not complete the ArriveCAN all the way. We were passed through but it could have been different. Filling them all out at same time u can assure all r done properly and wright down the codes ArriveCAN gives."
6676912,eyemike,2022-08-01 20:39:00,233,"I had Covid in June, along with my wife. How do I put that into ArriveCan?"
6676944,guidedfishing,2022-08-02 05:40:00,531,"Eyemike. You don't. You load your image that shows your vaccinated, and answer your questions that you are symptom free."
6677010,valley366,2022-08-02 09:24:00,193,"The response above is correct, you don't put it in there. I had it in early May and crossed in June. I did bring a copy of the positive test results though as was told if you had it 30 days previous that they will exempt you from the random test. That may have been rumor as I don't recall where I got that info."
6677036,Billswest,2022-08-02 10:59:00,32,"It's a simple form to fill out, takes less than 10 minutes. I wouldn't fill out a form for anyone else, even family. Six of us just got back from a trip to the Kenora area. All completed the form themselves. IMO if someone truly wants to go on the trip this shouldn't even be an issue, they are each responsible for doing it themselves."
6677040,Old Timer,2022-08-02 11:10:00,255,We hear plenty from travelers who skated by without being randomized. How about some reports from people who were handed random test kits.
6676544,Eckohlt,2022-07-31 13:16:00,3685,"If she was attractive I would have,she wasn't,she probably mad at me coz I didn't ask her for a date!"
6676554,Old Timer,2022-07-31 13:41:00,255,"There have been many posts on this topic. If using a passport, just hand over the book opened to your pic. Keep all of your paperwork and your vax card in the vehicle. If they want it, they'll ask for it. I suspect the agents are tired of being handed the kitchen sink. Do it right and you won't get any backlash."
6676558,pjshorthorn,2022-07-31 13:55:00,5654,You might be giving yourself too much credit .she may thought the same thing about yourself PjShorthorn
6676566,Eckohlt,2022-07-31 14:06:00,3685,"She winked at me after the arse chewing,so it's on her side lol."
6676574,Eckohlt,2022-07-31 14:19:00,3685,"I think her mother was the one riding the bicycle in the wizard of OZ,with Toto in the basket."
6676588,pjshorthorn,2022-07-31 15:19:00,5654,Tried to help out with what May have been the reason why it happened at the border . .Geeezzz. PjShorthorn
6676590,Eckohlt,2022-07-31 15:25:00,3685,The reason it happened was the passport holder n vax card also in the holder!she didn't like that.
6676596,Mojo-NC,2022-07-31 15:55:00,1929,"We crossed the border last September and again early last month. We each completed our ArriveCAN apps separately and handed over only our passports. We also always take off our sunglasses. You can but don't need to have everyone in the vehicle on the same ArriveCAN app, but it certainly doesn't hurt. It also doesn't hurt to address the agents by sir or ma'am as appropriate. They will never get upset with you for being too polite and respectful. I generally keep my passport in a holder along with my Vaccination Card, Outdoors Card, and my current fishing license. We each took our passports out of any holders and handed the agent only the passports. They generally don't want any other documents, but if they do ask for additional documentation, we hand it to them separately and only what they have requested, such as an automobile rental agreement. Same goes when flying - the TSA agents do not want your passport in a holder. When I accidentally left it in the cover recently, the agent politely asked me to take it out. The more I travel, the more I provide TSA and border agents with only what they ask for and nothing more. I also only answer only the questions that are asked, nothing more and nothing less. Once they scan the passport, the ArriveCAN information comes up with it."
6676598,eyecatcher1,2022-07-31 15:56:00,323,I don't do anything until they ask me to except take off my sunglasses and roll down the back window. I've never had a problem at the border in Fort Francis and I've been crossing there for 30 years. When I had a passport I handed it to them closed too. Now I just have the enhanced license. I've never been asked for shot papers for my dog either.
6676682,combine_billy,2022-08-01 06:45:00,151,"yes, you can do this from your phone and yes you will get a confirmation receipt be ready to put in the address and phone number of where you are going"
6676458,John2462,2022-07-31 06:46:00,7,Our Canadian outfitter suggested that I fill out Arrive Can form for all passengers crossing the border in one vehicle. There will be 4 of us in one car. Should I follow their recommendation or should each one fill out the form individually? We will be crossing the border in Sault St Marie around 4:00 PM on Saturday. I will appreciate your input. Thank you in advance for your help.
6676464,Andre (wallyandre),2022-07-31 06:56:00,2274,All travellers in the same car should be in 1 ArrivCanFollow your outfitter advise
6676472,John2462,2022-07-31 07:33:00,7,"Thank you, Andre. Appreciate your quick reply."
6676506,Rondogpike1,2022-07-31 10:28:00,5,We crossed @ Pigeon River on 7/22. All 4 people in the vehicle registered on the same app. Went very smooth and we were not selected for a random test. The car in front of us was selected. I went in to pay duty on our booze and the guys told me the car after us was also selected.
6676518,combine_billy,2022-07-31 12:00:00,151,"It does not matter at all, you are going to give the agent all four passports and they will automatically pull up the arrivecan info no matter if it is filled out by one person or four."
6676524,Eckohlt,2022-07-31 12:18:00,3685,"I got scolded for having my passport in a clear plastic folder that holds vax card also,she insisted no paper work just passport,older gal probably missed her coffee break!!"
6676526,pjshorthorn,2022-07-31 12:25:00,5654,Did you hand your passport to the agent open to the main page with your picture or just closed ? PjShorthorn
6676528,Eckohlt,2022-07-31 12:39:00,3685,"It was closed cause I handed all 4 passport PJ,the previous other 4 times since border opening not a prob with the holder.I didn't want to argue with her about it cause I'm sure the random test is close at hand!,my vax card was in the holder also and she didn't like that either."
6676532,pjshorthorn,2022-07-31 12:53:00,5654,"I understand your point. I asked only to understand why she was ornery. Not that what I do is correct, but ever since passports were required I always have all of our passports open to the main page with the pictures so the agent doesn't have to find it themselves. I have my vax card in a similar holder like you mentioned when the passport is opened to the main page, the vax card is not seen unless the agent decides to look for it. On my last crossing in July, the agent handed our passports back opened up just like I presented them. Maybe you should have winked at the agent when you pulled up .LOL. PjShorthorn"
6676538,GeoFish,2022-07-31 13:05:00,70,I am totally confused.I went on line and put in all my vac info for both of us. I cannot enter my travel dates until 72 hours before we cross.Can I do this on line from my phone?Do they e mail me my recite?
