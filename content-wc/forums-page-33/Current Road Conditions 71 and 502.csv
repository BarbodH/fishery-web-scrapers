6678016,jkretch,2022-08-07 17:03:00,80,Heading to Vermilion Bay on Saturday. Curious of recent road conditions on both 71 and 502. I see in July 71 was not in good shape.....perhaps that has changed? 502 in good shape? Thanks in advance!

6678060,drew59,2022-08-07 20:27:00,87,I'm heading to VB on Wednesday. Unless I'm missing something the Canada 511 map isn't showing any construction on 71 which is my preferred route as it has places to stop. It indicates 20 minutes longer than taking 502 which is normal.
6678064,prov1800,2022-08-07 20:32:00,5010,Did you read my post
6678136,Bill Krejca,2022-08-08 06:56:00,6107,"Yeah, depends on where you are entering. From Rainy River, 71 is slightly longer, if entering at Fort Francis, is considerably longer on 71. Bill"

6678282,drew59,2022-08-08 16:13:00,87,I did. It doesn't say anything about 71. Am I missing something?
