5022857,altemus_prime,2016-07-27 09:04:00,37,"I'm trying to organize a Canadian trip for my group of friends. Only me and one other guy have Canadian experience. The rest have some great Lakes walleye experience and we are all avid trout and bass fishermen. We are trying to find an outfitter with plentiful walleye numbers and some pike too. Would like to be within 7 hours of erie, pa. Looking for housekeeping with decent camp boats. Want wilderness experience.Prior to having children, I fished numerous years on the Ottawa river, near Westmeath, Ontario. Although we got into walleyes, they were sporadic and difficult to find. I'm hoping for a place where we have a great chance of some walleye limits to eat while we are there. I've looked into kipawa, but I'm concerned with the size and inexperience of some in our group that we may spend more time trying to find fish and less time on them. Thank you so much for any and all information/assistanceSent from my SCH-I545 using Tapatalk"
5023329,adempsey2.0,2016-07-27 12:24:00,611,"A lot more options if you can increase your driving distance. The area within 7 hours is one of the most populated in Canada, so those lakes aren't going to produce like you hope.You're definitely right about Kipawa. I was just there in June and it was a challenge. Beautiful lake though and definitely provides the wilderness vibe. It has a lot of potential for great fishing, but there's a good chance you'll do poorly. If you like fishing for Walleye 4AM to 8AM and then 7PM to 10/11PM, you will likely be more successful. Lake Trout and Smallmouth Bass fishing are decent though. The drive distance and rates are good, as long as you're willing to possibly suffer through difficult fishing - BUT, you might hit a good week and do really well. Otherwise, one other possibility is Ellen Island Camp on Lady Evelyn Lake. This is a boat-to housekeeping camp. Personally, I think this camp is overpriced, but the rates aren't too bad if you have 7+ guys. Evelyn really is one of the better lakes in the area. Consider the American Plan lodges - Island 10 and Garden Island Lodge. They offer an amazing experience, albeit they are a bit expensive. The food and equipment are top notch though. There's also Red Pine Wilderness Lodge which had new owners last year I think. So, you might be able to negotiate a better price with them.The fishing on Evelyn is also hit and miss. Some people do great, others not so much. Definitely has potential for some trophy fish though. We did reasonably well the two times we went. One of my favorite lakes - it's beautiful and provides a remote experience without having to drive 700+ miles.If you want the true wilderness experience, you should fly into an outpost. The closest to you would be Air Melancon in Quebec at 565 miles. If you decide to take the plunge and can work out a 10-11 hour drive (Cochrane, Foleyet, Chapleau, Wawa, White River, Hawk Junction), I suggest you talk to Mike Borger at canadafishingguide.net. He has a wealth of knowledge and can help you with all the outfitters in that area."
5023497,Stauff,2016-07-27 13:36:00,110,"Fly-in trip? I've been very happy with Mattice Lake Outfitters. We've been going to the Ogoki Reservoir and have found that having the expertise of an on-site ""camp manager"", not a guide, has helped us to have an enjoyable and productive stay each time. The destination is definitely farther than your seven hour specification (google Armstrong Station, ON) but the experience, especially for the less experienced participants, is absolutely top-notch. We were there over July 4th week, and although we never boated a 40"" pike this time, the quantity more than made up for it. Ted (the manager) will insist that the pike are far superior eating to the walleye, and he almost proves it the way he shows how to clean and prepare northerns. Our walleye problem was trying to find eyes that were under the 18"" length to keep. One out of five we could keep, as most were in the 19"" to 22"" range. Jigs, live bait or not, crank baits, and spoons - it didn't matter. One day my brother and I fished the entire day on nothing but artificial. There's no way you can fish all the productive water in a week, and the scenery just completes the experience. The suggestion to contact Mike Borger is a wise one. Check out his Mojikit Lake Youtube. It ties in with the Ogoki reservoir."
5023737,fishron,2016-07-27 14:38:00,317,"If you keep to your around 7 hours drive it will limit you. I agree with Adempsy on the possibilities on Lady Evelyn Lake. Much more than seven hours but the lake was always good to me for numbers and size of walleye. I didn't like the size limits in that portion of Ontario. When we were there it was 17 inches and letting go many walleye in the 18 and 19 perfect eating size was a bummer. We fish Wolfe Lake in southern Ontario and have for almost 30 years. We use George McCulloch's cabins. Wolfe is a great walleye lake (at times). We know it very well and have had great trips and not so great trips over the years. We love this lake a will go as long as we can. Pike and bass are also present. It's an hour over the Thousand Island entry. I've been scoping out a lake one hour further, Land o Lakes lodge on Crotch Lake. Check out their new owners website. It's very well done and their prices for housekeeping or full plan cannot be beat. I've had friends that have fished it and rate it great for bass, so so for walleye and pike. and a good presence of large perch. A large beautiful lake with almost no shoreline development. I believe the size limit tops out at 20 inches for walleye. I may try this one myself next year. Good Luck!"
5023961,altemus_prime,2016-07-27 16:57:00,37,"Thank you all for your information. The reason for the 7 hour time frame is we have a couple guys that can't do a full week and didn't want to waste a lot of time driving for only 3 days fishing. I would love to do an expensive American plan or a fly in, but we are all young family men that also take our wives/children to the outer banks and don't have a lot of extra coin to dropSent from my SCH-I545 using Tapatalk"
5027081,Shellback,2016-07-29 06:06:00,8083,"If you find a place within 7 hours, please let me know. I'm in Chester cty PA. I had some good fishing in the Chapleau area last year, but it was a 21 hour drive for me. I can't seem to find anything much closer that would be productive. Being in central PA, and not having to make long stops as I had to, you might cut it down to 16 hours or less. If you guys are young, do a straight through switching drivers."
5028193,fishron,2016-07-29 14:56:00,317,"I believe there are some good relatively close by walleye spots in southern Ontario. You can't match the fantastic action of a good fly-in lake. The key to the closer lakes is familiarity with the water. If you really know the lake due to many trips in the past, even a lake an hour over the border can produce. If you don't know the close-by lake it will be a challenge. A good guide is always an option. Interestingly you mentioned a couple of spots I know from past trips. I fished the Ottawa around Westmeath at Lorne Spotswoods (spotty) camp many years ago. A beautiful area with walleye, bass, channel cats and pike but not in great numbers.......but, I only fished it once. Did well for one trip and familiarity would have made it better every time. Hatteras has been a destination for my wife and I many times and I've had some memorable offshore trips. Good luck finding your spot. It'll be great just to get on the water."

6669526,Lakefront,2022-07-01 19:43:00,179,"I was researching the Kawartha Lakes on WC and found your post from 2016. My wife and I have fished Baptiste Lake near Bancroft & love the area. I've been looking for another destination and stumbled upon Pigeon Lake. Looks like a nice fishery for bass, walleye, and muskie. Any advise on walleye fishing in July would be helpful- trolling crankbaits, worm harnesses/spinners, or jigs & minnies? Any information about Pigeon Lake Resort? Thanks - Dave M."
6669542,adempsey2.0,2022-07-01 20:32:00,611,"I have fished Pigeon many times. Although, it has been a few years since I have been there. Much like other weedy Kawartha lakes, the walleye are likely in the weed beds. Pigeon has a massive weed bed in 10 to 14ft throughout the central part of the lake. At least, that is my recollection. We typically jig fished, but might be worth looking into the ""Walleye Killer Rig"" to punch into those weed beds (basically a harness with an egg sinker - see attached image). Works great. Bucktail jigs too. I have stayed at Pigeon Lake Resort several times. I either stay there or Camp Fisherman. It's a typical rustic resort. However, once again, it has been many years since I have been there. So, not sure if it has gotten better or worse. Had the same owners for over 15 years if that indicates anything? I almost booked it again this year, but ended up booking Rice Lake due to size of the family coming. Rice lake is probably worth checking out too. Weedy lake. Lots of different fish species - smallmouth, largemouth, walleye, crappie, bluegill, sunfish, musky. Not sure if the pike have made it in there yet. It will be my first time back to Rice Lake in over 10 years."
6669562,Lakefront,2022-07-01 21:29:00,179,"Thanks for your reply and information re. Pigeon Lake. I like the Walleye Killer Rig- never seen this before. I bought some bucktails that I’m dying to try, too. Might even try some float rigs in the weeds. I read some recent reviews about Pigeon Lake Resort & the owners seem to keep things up to date (i.e. air conditioning).I’ve heard a lot of good things about Rice Lake and would be interested to hear how your trip goes this year.

6678972,phishfearme,2022-08-11 13:15:00,1242,"being a western PA boy, and fishing in Ontario and Quebec for over 40 years, it's my opinion that you simply cannot get a ""wildness experience"" within 7-hour drive of Erie - maybe the Algonquin but there's no walleye there.my suggestion is to either widen your driving distance or rent a cabin/boat in the western basin of lake erie.expanding to 10 hours will get you to the Chapleau area (this is not hardly ""Walleyecentral"") and 12 hours will get you to Wawa/White River where you can fly into some good options.the western basin on lake erie seem like a reasonable compromise?for years we struggled with your dilemma (went to Ray's Camps in Biscotasing from 1970 to 1985 - still a possible option for you) and finally gave up and headed to NW Ontario and have been going there - either by drive or flight - for the last 25+ years - NEVER regretted it.phish"

I would look at Pigeon and upper or lower Buckhorn and also Stoney Lakes there. Been to them many times over the years. However, there are no pike in the Kawartha Lakes. One other good walleye, bass, pike and muskie lake is Big Gull Lake in Arden, Ontario going towards Ottawa. This would probably be my first choice for your demands.

5049161,Bill Krejca,2016-08-09 07:20:00,6107,A very limited time factor can really reduce the practicable possibilities. Not wasting time traveling may be offset by wasting time at a less than productive fishing spot. Bill

The biologist told us the strain of walleye that live in the Ottawa in that area is very slow growing, really big fish are rare. Of the thousands of fish we tagged the biggest was one female that weighed 9.9 lbs.Lake Domoine is a bit better for big fish."
5032209,mickr,2016-08-01 10:53:00,74,Above the Swisha dam you run in to bigger fish. That night be a result of a lot less pressure which is what I always thought. But you see a lot of blues in the river above the dam that are migrating down from the Dumoine so presumably there are regular walleye coming down the Dumoince too. Maybe there is a genetic angle as well.
5032361,martinbns,2016-08-01 12:02:00,1520,"About 2 miles up the Dumoine River there is a fairly significant waterfall, maybe 20 feet. We also tagged fish there.

Best smallmouth fishing I've ever seen. Just my dad and my 15 year old self. We kept a tally in a journal and caught over 200 smallmouth in 5 days. SeveralThat were over 5 lbs. Also got into some big pike. Managed a couple walleye, but never got consistent in them. Great memories, but always left me wishing for more eyes.

5028457,mickr,2016-07-29 19:58:00,74,"Google says Erie PA to Ottawa is 6.5 hours. That limits you somewhat. Eastern Ontario is a fantastic, very diverse fishery. Opportunities aplenty for many many species however top notch numbers fishing for walleye is a little hard to find simply because it is a relatively populated area and there are lots of people fishing for tablefare I fish lots of local lakes for walleye and do well however there's years of knowledge involved. Most of the lakes are not what I would go on for a guys weekend vacation. Bay of Quinte and the St. Lawrence River are both fantastic fisheries with both holding very large walleye. You mentioned Spotswood's spot - if you travel another hour up that river and get above the Swisha dam the walleye fishing is better for both numbers and size. There are a few camp operations up there however rental boats are a bit limited and that is big water and not something you want to be on in a 14 foot tin can when the wind gets up. Definitely worth considering though if you have your own boats. there is one spot that rents a couple of ok boats that I can think of. Actually, there is a good outfitter below the dam also that offers good accommodations and boat rentals. I haven't fished below the dam in probably 5 years because the fishing got a bit slower however with the slot that's been implemented I am certain it has picked up. If you want to stretch your drive a bit, there is some pretty decent fishing within say 3 - 4 hours north of Ottawa. I'd avoid Kipawa - never been there myself but it is one of those places that most people say you need to know to do ok. PM me if you have any questions on specific places. You might also consider posting on www.fish-hawk.net which is mostly an eastern Ontario site....lots of knowledgeable people there that might be able to help you out."
