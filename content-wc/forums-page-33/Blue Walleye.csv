6675334,ma1819,2022-07-26 06:54:00,13,My group caught a Blue walleye this past June 28th in the Gouin Reservoir (Quebec) - about 14 inches. Took a pic and released it. Beautiful fish - deep blue coloration -
6677348,NWBearcatgrad,2022-08-03 21:44:00,36,"A bit hard to see, but this one is outta Wabakimi several years back. Right across from the Pipestone cabin, at a reef. Caught several blue ones that day."
6677462,stevensinks,2022-08-04 20:46:00,330,"A few years ago a group of us flew into Rogers Lake. About 1/3 of the walleye we caught were blue, only place I have seen them."
6677532,mswope13,2022-08-05 08:52:00,73,"I boated a blue eye this past trip on 7/26 in Steamboat. First our group have ever caught in Steamboat, but we did catch a couple blue's in McKenzie Bay over the years. This was a nice fish (20""), but didn't grab a photo as we were parked over them and the action was fast and furious."
6677764,lunker99,2022-08-06 16:43:00,236,"Don't see it as often, but here's a northern from our trip last week that had the coloration around and inside its mouth. From what I had read before coloration isn't in the water, it's associated with a bacteria or fungus that can live on the fish. Given the location I didn't rub it to see if it would come off, lol."
6677780,Eckohlt,2022-08-06 16:52:00,3685,Did ya fry her up??
6677784,lunker99,2022-08-06 17:03:00,236,"33"" slot fish, went back into the drink after the pics"
6677788,Eckohlt,2022-08-06 17:15:00,3685,Gotcha!
6674500,ryguy,2022-07-22 07:31:00,11,"Yup! lots in northern Ontario. Blue, blue/yellow and more yellowish.. beautiful fish!"
6674504,wmd,2022-07-22 07:31:00,388,I have caught a few blue walleyes at Ghost River on Marchington Lake and one other lake in that system. wmd

6674536,fishron,2022-07-22 09:07:00,317,This is a decent blue I caught in Quebec a while back. When we fished the Cabonga years ago the owner said the blue variation gets to the same size of the yellow walleye. Growing up in NE Philly the supermarket we used always had Blue Pike. It was a walleye species that was commercially fished from Lake Erie. The story goes that it was fished into extinction.
6674634,Bstar,2022-07-22 14:44:00,564,We've caught them in Miniss Lake. Seem to be fairly common there.
6674640,BankerFish,2022-07-22 14:54:00,27,"yep - 3 legit blue walleyes at upper chikuni on Red Lake this spring, several smaller ones in Medicine Stone about 10-12 yrs ago, and more than my share of blue at LCBO..."
6674794,Hewhocookstomuch,2022-07-23 15:42:00,66,"I was with Stjoeguy when he caught one on Saint Joseph. See picture, I took it. I have heard that blue walleye are fairly common in Lake Erie."
6674798,walleyecheek,2022-07-23 16:02:00,2231,"If its a pigment in the water wouldn't the northern, musky, smallmouth also be blue ?"
6674852,Anonymouse,2022-07-23 22:18:00,834,"It's called ""adaptive coloration"" & can become a dominant - as opposed to recessive - genetic expression, over time."
6674988,Walleye2242,2022-07-24 14:57:00,263,I have not but a guy in our group caught a blue walleye long ago. 1979ish. Clay lake. The owners took it and mounted it in their dining camp area.
6674394,Esoxfeign1313,2022-07-21 19:47:00,79,Has anyone ever caught a blue walleye? I caught a nice one on my first trip to the Gouin. Iâ€™m looking forward to getting back up there this September!
6674398,N_of_Quibell,2022-07-21 20:12:00,151,They can apparently be found in lakes north of Ear Falls:http://wayneschaefer.blogspot.com/
6674406,southernEyes,2022-07-21 20:25:00,232,Have caught them in south west Quebec. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
6674430,PRO-V16,2022-07-21 21:51:00,454,A friend and I each caught one many years ago on a small carry in lake north of Grand Rapids Mn.
6674438,pjshorthorn,2022-07-22 01:59:00,5654,Caught this one last fall on a smaller fly in lake near Anishanabi. The picture really doesn't do the blue color justice. This is the only one I've ever caught. PjShorthorn
6674442,Pooch,2022-07-22 03:19:00,4618,Seem to catch one every couple of years. Different lakes including Lac Seul most recently. Usually are small fish. Someone here on WC had an legit explanation for them and it was something to do with a genetic abnormality that asserts itself from time to time?Pooch
6674452,prov1800,2022-07-22 04:02:00,5010,"I fish some lakes north of siuox lookout and there are a number of lakes that hold them where all of the walleyes are blue,some green its caused due to some pigment in the water.It comes of the fish when we threw them on a pail in the boat"
6674454,Luckydawg13,2022-07-22 04:40:00,363,I never heard of them pretty cool
6674474,eyecatcher1,2022-07-22 06:09:00,323,I've caught two of them on Lac Seul over the years. One blue perch too.
6674498,stjoeguy,2022-07-22 07:24:00,979,"This is from Lake St. Joseph 10 years ago. It was kind of a blue-gray color, definitely different than normal. It's the only one I've seen."
