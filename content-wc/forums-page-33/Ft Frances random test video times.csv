6679044,manfishing,2022-08-11 20:32:00,131,Anyone else have good luck with internet service when completing random covid test when crossing into Fort Frances. Whare were you able to find internet service. Any help will be appreciated.

As a public service, they provide numerous public hotspots in Fort Frances - the above link shows the specific locations. If I am ever so unlucky to get the dreaded blue box, my plan is to look up one of these hotspots. But fortunately (for me) this theory has remained untested. I'd appreciate any reports anyone might have in this regards."

Currently planning on crossing about 5pm Tuesday with an outpost fly-in at 6am out of Kenora the next day. If selected, will I be able to get the video testing done Tuesday after 5pm? I have not been able to find any information on what times video supervised testing is available, but I'm thinking that 5am Wednesday is likely not an option. Do I need to plan to cross the border earlier Tuesday afternoon in case one of us gets selected? Also, does anyone know where the test results can be dropped off in Ft Frances and Kenora? Thanks for any info."

It's a lot easier to do the test with a good internet connection and a table in front of you. We stopped at La Place Rendez-vous for lunch and the internet connection. The drop off site was at 600 Scott in Fort Frances. It's a box outside of taxi/u-haul rental shop. Nothing fancy."

6675308,Pooch,2022-07-26 04:04:00,4618,So where did people stop to do the Covid test? Not sure stopping off to the side of the border crossing lot is an option in order to get a solid cell signal?Doing it in camp isn't an option (Mahkwa) because of lack of a drop off.Planning options just in case!!Pooch
6675396,Woollybob,2022-07-26 10:15:00,158,Pooch - When are you headed up to Mahkwa? I will be there Aug 1-6. My first trip back up there in a few years.

Place in a box and seal it. You drop it in a Puralator Courier drop box. There is one in Fort Francis and Dryden."
6676184,mms3rd,2022-07-29 11:24:00,148,"So, proof of vaccination is not sufficient to get across....might still have to do random test? I've never had COVID."
6676218,Old Timer,2022-07-29 14:25:00,255,"This was a hot topic earlier this year and addressed on various WC threads. Last year you had to be vaccinated and have taken a PCR test within three days of crossing over. Now, the PCR test has been eliminated, but not the random. And like it's name, it's random and everybody is at risk of being handed one. I've been part of five random tests over four trips through customs. You gotta take the test where you have cell service. We took the tests in the customs parking lot where the cell phones still had service. There is a video component to the test so you have to have a cell phone or I-Pad capable of a video connection. At some stations like IF it could be tricky because of tight quarters. I haven't been randomized there, but if so I'd drive east towards Rainy Lake Sports and parallel park along the road next to the Rainy River. Others have taken the test at restaurants, motels and libraries. Destination camps work too if there's cell service. It would be easiest to set up over a table somewhere."
