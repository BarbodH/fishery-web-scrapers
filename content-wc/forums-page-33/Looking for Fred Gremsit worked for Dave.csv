Today I watched a YouTube video by Jay Siemens about a moose hunt. One of the comments on the YouTube site was from Fred Grems. He used to be on Walleye Central but gave up years ago after the infamous password fiasco. Anyhow, I used to enjoy emailing with him about fishing on St Joe, but that was back in 2013 - 2017. After seeing his name I tried emailing, but he must have a new email address and my email was returned. If anyone knows Fred, ask him to get in touch with me. My email is the same as it was back then, but if he doesn't have it, maybe you could p/m his address to me. Thanks."
6678422,Bakefish,2022-08-09 07:46:00,1077,Fred's not here.
6678450,stjoeguy,2022-08-09 09:28:00,979,Neither is Dave. No wonder I'm lonely.
6678508,proguidedream,2022-08-09 12:38:00,345,"could try a youtube message , used to be able too at least"
6678548,stjoeguy,2022-08-09 15:19:00,979,"Thanks, but I don't think that's an option now. I did reply to his comment, but unless he's notified of the reply, I doubt he'll ever see it. It's not critical by any means. I just thought it would be nice to get back in touch with him."
6678550,reddemon2,2022-08-09 16:01:00,255,Maybe Dave and Fred are related
6678586,SweetD,2022-08-09 20:37:00,243,This the guy? He is on Instagram if itâ€™s the right one!
6678596,stjoeguy,2022-08-09 21:03:00,979,"It probably is him. Thank you, but I don't do instagram. Actually, another W/C member still communicates with Fred and sent me his email via P/M early today. Thank you to everyone.."
