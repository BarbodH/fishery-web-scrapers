We crossed into Canada on July 15 and had one car ahead of us and he went to the right to an open window and then the first windows car pulled ahead and we were at the window of agent Armstrong. He asked for our passports and I handed him all of them and he asked us the regular questions which I answered no to except the one on liquor as the wife had a fifth of Vodka. He asked about cannabis and I said no. No test was given. He said have a good time and we were gone. We weren't there 5 minutes. First building we see after crossing is advertising cannabis, imagine that. Our return on the 29th was just as quick and uneventful. The weather did not cooperate the first 3 days with the water as smooth as a mirror and hot by Canadian standards with temperatures in the mid 80's. Fishing was tough. After that it was pretty much normal with some wind & rain every day and the fish we found were in 15-20 feet of water. The biggest walleye caught was 26"" with many in that neighborhood and the biggest Northern was 36"" and caught on accident. We gave up on live minnows after 3 days as they were dying much quicker than normal and gulp worked fine. Three dozen minnows @ Dutchies were 19.00 American. The gal @ Dutchies estimated that business is down about 30%. Went up to Ear Falls for some groceries and found that their is a very nice in my opinion Bistro/Cafe to the left of the grocery store that used to be Wilson's. The Trillium Motel Restaurant is only open Mon-Fri 4-8 pm. We went up and back on 502 and they are all in excellent condition with a lot less traffic than their used to be. Please support your local fishing camp as much as you can!! Later, Jay"
6676680,Bakefish,2022-08-01 06:37:00,1077,Thanks for the report Jay. What kind of food was served at the restaurant next to Wilsons?
6676776,JAY221,2022-08-01 11:29:00,877,"Mostly pizza and burgers & wings along with salads. You can find a menu online after searching for Bistro Cafe Ear Falls Ontario. Be hungry if you order their Calzone as it is a 12"" pizza flipped in half. Later, Jay"
6676968,UKBDM,2022-08-02 06:43:00,178,Did you fish the big lake much or stay south? How were water levels?
6677132,JAY221,2022-08-02 18:11:00,877,"I would say water is still up a couple feet and it rained some about everyday so isn't dropping quickly. We fished everywhere but Keynote and the daughter/son-in-law fished it and did well. We caught fish off of the southeast corner of Doe pretty regularly. Most of our fish were caught in 15-20 feet of water. They are spread out pretty good.Later, Jay"
