6677496,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2022-08-05 06:39:00,240,Yes. Have you flown with them?
6677500,Larry S,2022-08-05 06:57:00,665,"You are mistaken, Mattice NEVER had Chip C hase outpost!!"
6677502,adempsey2.0,2022-08-05 07:04:00,611,"I believe Mattice provided the air service for Ogoki Frontiers, which operated Chipchase."
6677528,Ogoki,2022-08-05 08:47:00,291,"Mattice owned cabin at Chipchase , until in the 1990’s , when Don sold it to Ogoki Frontier ."
6677602,plnwtf,2022-08-05 23:04:00,212,"Numerous times. Flew in to the Kopka River chain. More specifically Uneven Lake. Great fishing. Only concession on that area. Has one lake you 4 wheel to and 2-3 others you have some short portages. Uneven has walleye, pike and lake trout.Wilderness North have the Turbo Charged Otters so they can carry more weight. Havent been up for about 10 years so dont know if anything has changed."
6677614,cle,2022-08-06 05:22:00,7,"Showalter, Walsten Outposts and Wilderness Air all great outfitters."
6676534,Eckohlt,2022-07-31 12:54:00,3685,"You put a for sale sign in the middle of the lake,if it's 30 ft deep you get a 30ft pole."
6676540,walleyecheek,2022-07-31 13:10:00,2231,"What would one expect to pay for a lake ? Is it priced by square footage, or how many acres, or how deep it is, is it stocked, is it full of cat tails, is it full of rusty crawfish ? The list goes on and on !!!"
6676542,Eckohlt,2022-07-31 13:14:00,3685,"Probably by how many bull heads are in it,DNR does a bull head survey.then the $ figure."
6676548,walleyecheek,2022-07-31 13:26:00,2231,"well, if it full of bullheads I'm only paying a buck an acre ! I can go to faribault for bullheads !"
6676550,Eckohlt,2022-07-31 13:34:00,3685,"Taste better in Ontario,that will bump up that buck an acre!"

6676646,prov1800,2022-07-31 20:48:00,5010,id say for fun.Upper has enough fish to keep you busy but we did get some silver pike in between the lakes more into pusher.
6676806,kona77,2022-08-01 13:37:00,236,"well, if it full of bullheads I'm only paying a buck an acre ! I can go to faribault for bullheads !. Can't believe it has come to ripping on the magnificent bullhead on this thread Grew up catching them on the Rock River that flowed thru the family farm and still like to catch/eat them. Oh well back to the original question/thread. I trust you will have a great trip with the Clark's but I see others have provided information on other outfitters (Nestor Falls, Mattice etc). So many great places to fish in Canada. We did have our 8th trip with the Clarks this year and it was another outstanding trip. Have fished 5 different lakes with them and we are booked for Wright Lake next year. Had a family/medical emergency 4 days before our trip this year and Wayne/Karla were very great to work with and they made some accommodations for us that I really appreciated."
6676832,reddemon2,2022-08-01 14:51:00,255,"[QUOTE=prov1800;6676394]Where should I start, Before we left we weighed all of our stuff on a certified scale and we were all under the limit, Somehow we got charged for being 140lbs over, Only 1 check in all week with a delivery of dead minnows, ran out of gas for the generator, I will say fishing was great if you enjoy catching eater size fish, Wasn't impressed the way Wayne handled everyone's deposit over the pandemic either."

6676404,RichA$1970,2022-07-30 18:18:00,1159,"I would like to hear what Reddemon has to say about his experience as that’s a reason to read these posts from paying customers and their experience. I read reviews in the web and like I said, I discard the top and bottom couple and then see what the rest have to say. Based on what I read on the web, where’s there smoke there’s fire and their PR disaster 2 years ago rubbed a lot of people while other outfitters were up front on carry over refunds so they’re off my list. I understand you have a personal relationship with them and I’d guess, might be wrong, they direct customers your way so there is a business relationship even if it’s not on their books. Maybe I missed it, but do you recommend any other camps based on living up there?"
6676418,MikeinMN,2022-07-30 20:31:00,190,"Not really sure what’s not to like about Clark’s? I guess I understand guys that aren’t happy with the deposit situation a couple years back, but if you actually fly with them, I don’t know what could be lacking. I’ve flown with a dozen or so different outfits from Vermillion Bay to Red Lake and Clark’s is a quality experience. For the OP, wait until after your trip to look for a different outfitter and I don’t think you’ll need to shop around; for the guys that had poor experiences, please explain or even PM me because I’m really curious"
6676440,prov1800,2022-07-31 04:41:00,5010,The big camps with the full packages usually have some guides on staff were the housekeeping camps basically don't.I guide for all the camps on Cedar and some on Lac Suel and Eagle.I usually get in touch myself with myself to make arrangements.So where ever I go would recommend any of them from personal experience.
6676450,GeoFish,2022-07-31 06:15:00,70,"Thanks. No one is at Pusher our week. Any reason to go, better fishing or just for fun?"
6676452,Eckohlt,2022-07-31 06:29:00,3685,"I fished upper wapesi,never went to pusher,if you get bored catching on wapesi then you might want to take a road trip to pusher."
6676490,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2022-07-31 08:57:00,240,"If you search 'outdoor junkies' on YouTube you can see their trip into Wapesi and into Pusher; the guys are guided by our own Prov1800, so that is interesting as well. I am very happy with Nestor Falls Outposts as an outfitter, but it is a chore (as all of you know) to get a group of 6 together, which they require. So I do enjoy looking at other outfitters and their lakes. I would have no problem booking a trip with Clark's. Wilderness North is also on my short list, along with Slate Falls Outposts. So many lakes, so little time......"
6676500,AsianAngler,2022-07-31 09:51:00,67,We had a good experience with Mattice Lake Outfitters. I brought my Weimaraner. Pilot even lifted him up into the plane. Word of WARNING-The noise of the plane is hard on a dog's ears and it may freak them out. Consider putting some cotton balls or foam into their ears before the flight. Good luck!
6676502,GeoFish,2022-07-31 10:10:00,70,Thanks I would have not thought of that.
6676514,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2022-07-31 11:30:00,240,"which lake with Mattice? I flew with them into Auger Lake back in 2016, but I think they 'sold' that lake to Boreal Outfitters.......Mattice was first class, great outfitters."
6676530,walleyecheek,2022-07-31 12:43:00,2231,"How do you ""sell"" a lake ?"
6676264,IaDave14,2022-07-29 18:38:00,99,I'm still waiting to hear about your trip this month. You said you were going to post a trip report. Do you actually go to Canada? I think you are trying to be the REW on this part of WC as I have never seen one post that actually helps out with guys that have a question at least REW offers advice.
6676268,Eckohlt,2022-07-29 19:24:00,3685,Do need help with something??
6676272,Eckohlt,2022-07-29 19:33:00,3685,"Going back aug 10, going to put 2 reports together back to back,call pickeral arm camps ask for the owner his name is lee,he will tell you this is my 3rd trip this year,my 4th is sept 34 to Abamasagi lake different outfitter,reached my 150th flyin trip this year, and many more drive in's than that,now is there any I can help you with,like tying on a jig??"
6676274,RichA$1970,2022-07-29 19:52:00,1159,"The Sunset Country website is a good place to start. Then pick some you like and type in the resort on the web to read reviews. I usually read 10-20 reviews, I discard the best 2 and worse 2 as there’s always someone who is in love of a place and also some Karen’s or Ken’s who nitpick to death. If the rest are good then that’s a good sign. I would take your time and not worry about booking early as I suspect the downward trend in bookings will continue especially with inflation, Covid regulations and an aging clientele base so I would not send a deposit until a month before. Gray Wood Outfitters out of Nakina looks really good, never used them but the owner was very responsive to me as I’d take quality vs quantity any time."

6676304,GeoFish,2022-07-30 03:55:00,70,Going to Upper Wapesi. I talked to Clark's back in Feb. I did not book because I did not know if a booster would be a requirement. So when I found out a couple weeks ago we were ok I booked.
6676306,prov1800,2022-07-30 04:28:00,5010,Upper Wapesi will be a great week for you.Was in there few years ago and filmed 3 days.Can probably go on Clarks site a d find that show.Fishing was about as good as it gets.There was no guests in Pusher Lake at that time and we fished there also.Cabin very roomy and a nice long beach to walk on to stretch your legs.Plenty of moose in that areà so you might get to see some of them.

When you read their reviews, half are 5 stars and the other half are 1 star so I guess either you love or hate them. Good thing is there’s plenty of choices and with that many 1 star reviews, I’d pass."

Awesome flight in with awesome pilots great cabins and fantastic fishing.So can't be that.All deposits were honored as far as I know and rolled over like every other camp.Sometimes iam at Clarks and meet up with guys going and coming havnt seen a p****d of guy yet.Always talk to the guys coming off the planes to find out where they went and all I here is how fantastic the trip was.I mean who would give a trip a one star.Thats a joke."

Going out with Clarks in two weeks, first time with Clarks but wanting to look for places for next year just in case. We normally go in through International Falls so may want to stay in that part of Ontario. Any suggestions on outfitters would be appreciated. Also, we have two dogs that we take with us so not all outfitters may allow dogs."
