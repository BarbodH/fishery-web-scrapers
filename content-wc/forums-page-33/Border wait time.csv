6675358,turkeyriver,2022-07-26 07:59:00,80,"We went through to Canada on Sunday the 17th at about 1:30 pm, about 4 vehicles ahead of us and 2 lanes open so very easy. We came back south on Saturday the 23rd at 3 pm. We were the only ones coming back to the US, but the line going into Canada was out of sight down into IF. I can't imagine the wait time even though all 4 lanes were open. We did see an unreal number of boats and trucks headed north on the 502 when we came down Saturday so I imagine it had been like that all day. Is it always like that on Saturdays? I think I will always avoid going up on Saturday if that's the case."

6675768,prov1800,2022-07-27 17:47:00,5010,I live on #105 just before the CNR tracks at Red Lake Rd.So about 300 yds off the hwy and can tell you I can see large numbers of traffic going south early in the morning on Saturday and a short time later the traffic starts coming north.Change over days but not as much traffic as pre covid.
6676948,MorganMan,2022-08-02 05:47:00,341,Any idea if Fridays through the falls is as bad as the weekends?
6676980,Lovetofish,2022-08-02 07:17:00,458,We cross at the Falls on Friday's early afternoon and it's been fine. Sometimes we wait and other times I've pulled right up to the booth. I'll be crossing this Friday about 2pm.
6677000,valley366,2022-08-02 09:01:00,193,"We used to do a Saturday to Friday week at the lodge we went to. I believe the most common packages are Saturday to Friday and Saturday to Saturday. We would generally hit the border going south at 11:30am Friday. Sometimes it was backed up to McDonalds, sometimes it was 4 cars deep. This was all pre COVID."
6677012,stjoeguy,2022-08-02 09:26:00,979,"I've never gone up on Saturday so I can't compare. We usually cross north on Friday noon and south on Saturday 5;00 pm. There's rarely any traffic going south on Saturday. North at noon on Friday is usually 5-15 minutes. One time 45+, around the corner and down the county road. I don't know what was happening that day."
6677028,10point,2022-08-02 10:45:00,102,We crossed at 6:30 in the morning on the first Saturday in June and it took us an hour. On the way back it was about 7:30 or 8 and it was much quicker getting back in.
