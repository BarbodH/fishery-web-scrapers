6673200,bigeee99,2022-07-16 23:01:00,8,We just got back from 6 days fishing at Lac Du Male on the Gouin.. Water is 7 feet up from normal levels and fishing was really tough especially jigging. A good day was 10 and we had a few days with less than 5 per man which is different from the normal 40 or 50. The guys trolling were doing a bit better but everyone there said the fishing was the toughest they ever remembered. We worked all the depths from 8 feet to 45 and our finder rarely read more than one fish at a time though we did see numerous large schools of bait fish.
6673870,rkc118,2022-07-19 11:10:00,15,"Anyone ever catch anything besides Pike and Eyes in the reservoir? We have caught yellow perch and ""mullet"" which I believe are a type of fallfish. French name for them is ouitouche I think. AFC Gouin website (in French) has info about cicsos and lake whitefish, wikipedia claims there are sauger, lake trout, and brook trout to be had as well. thanks."
6673978,Peterpikes,2022-07-19 21:24:00,33,"I’ve been flying into the Gouin every years since 2002. I’ve snagged a yellow perch or 2 while trolling. I’ve caught a handful of sauger. I’ve seen whitefish/Cisco’s hanging under the dock. I’ve never seen or heard of anyone catching a brook trout or lake trout. I know some of the surrounding lakes hold those fish so it’s not impossible to believe a few may have migrated over into the Gouin during high water, but their populations are not big if they are there. Gouin is also a big place and I’ve only fished the NW corner so it’s possible trout may hold in other parts of the reservoir?"
6674006,Andre (wallyandre),2022-07-20 06:09:00,2274,"There is not lake trouts and speckle teouts in the Gouin. There is some nice yellow perch and multiple ""other non-sportive species"". I fish the Gouin since 1975 and I fish it from west to east."
6674016,Peterpikes,2022-07-20 06:52:00,33,"Andre,Have you been to the Gouin this year? Any reports? Seems like all the reports on here haven’t been great. Sounds like they had a tough spring with lots of rain in May and June. I’m headed up tomorrow to fish Du Male. Going to be great after a 2 year hiatus with Covid."
6674058,Freytown,2022-07-20 10:17:00,770,I agree with the high water levels this spring. I fished in mid June and it was a challenge to find fish. But I did fill my my quota at Pointe aux Dore. FT
6674062,Andre (wallyandre),2022-07-20 10:33:00,2274,I didn't go this year but from what I heard fishing is tougher this year; water is high so more space for the fish to go.
6674154,Esoxfeign1313,2022-07-20 18:50:00,79,"I’ve only fished the SW area of the Gouin, but it looks like it could be awesome smallmouth bass water, with it being more rocky vs. weedy. I don’t think their natural range is that far north, but I’m not really sure."
6676684,Peterpikes,2022-08-01 06:57:00,33,"Just got home from a week of fishing at the Gouin through ceasars north camps. Lac Du Mule area. My report matches the rest in here. We had 6 days of tough fishing. Water level is still a bit high, but was dropping as the week went on. We had wind and rain all but one day. We couldn’t really locate schools of walleye, they seemed to be scattered all over the place so we didn’t jig much. We picked off fish trolling, but the typical quantity of fish caught was a little below average. We did manage Some quality fish though, largest walleye was 29” and we had several more over 20”. Largest pike was 35” caught on Zara Spook. Oliver and John of Ceasars North Camps once again provided a great trip. I’ve been an annual customer with them for several years and they never disappoint. After a 2 year covid gap it felt great to be back in the bush. 362 days until we leave for the next trip. Can’t wait."
6678522,rkc118,2022-08-09 13:53:00,15,"Fished the first week of august out of Caesar's Gouin 2 cabin. About 100 pike and 500 walleye from 4 guys. Walleye were either in 3-5 fow in weeds caught trolling small crankbaits, or in 16-18 fow jigging on main lake points. No pattern to the big pike. 36 jigging in 16', 40 trolling over a back bay point, 41 casting in weed bed in back of a back bay. Amazing crimson sky sunset on the last evening to top off a great week."
6659288,clegg,2022-05-25 22:13:00,38,We called to make sure. They were going to call us if we didn’t. Seems like going through parent is in fact closed. We’ll have to go through La Tuque which is a few hours out of the way but it’s all good! Thank you !
6659404,Andre (wallyandre),2022-05-26 12:34:00,2274,The road between MtLaurier and Parent is now open
6659406,clegg,2022-05-26 12:49:00,38,Wow thank you! We called the camp but they haven’t heard anything yet. I checked 511 Quebec and it seems to be open. Camp still suggests we go by La Tuque but going through parent would easily save us 3 hours. We’re leaving in a couple of hours. What to do...

6663364,rkc118,2022-06-10 05:38:00,15,trip report? how was the road? how was the fishing? thanks
6664298,tweedrules,2022-06-14 04:24:00,107,"Yes, same please. We leave on Monday 6/27. Can't wait!!!!!!!!!!!"
6664514,clegg,2022-06-14 13:48:00,38,"We were up from the 28th to the 1st. The road through Parent had in fact opened the day we left. No issues there. (just never follow your GPS! We learned the hard way). We fished at the Saraana bay west. Water level was out of whack. The pilot informed us that had we come a week prior he wouldn't be able to land the plane on the bay because the water levels were so low. It had risen several feet by the time we arrived but it was still the lowest I'd ever seen it. In less than 24 hours that we were there the water level had risen again by about 2'. Fishing wasn't as good as it was the last few times we were there. The pilot said it might have to do with the weather being all over the place end of may, from heatwaves to terrential rains. Three of us only caught 108 fish total (most of which were nice sized walleye) and 20% of which were Pike. We fished four of the five days. We didn't go out one day because the winds/rain were too strong. This in comparison to the 300 fish we caught 3 years ago, same spot, same time. Still a great trip. Have a great time and happy fishing!"
6664714,tweedrules,2022-06-15 03:42:00,107,Thanks for the update. So great to get away!!!!!
6670104,tweedrules,2022-07-04 06:16:00,107,"We just got back from the Gouin. We were at Lac du Male with Air Mount Laurier. Our 14th year. Norman, Jesse and Danielle (the care taker) are awesome and make our trip exceptional. The water level is not low. It's very high. Some of the highest we've seen. But it was declining as the week went on. Conditions were really tough. LOTS OF WIND AND RAIN. Some days we needed to pull up on a bank to ride out the waves. Really cold. I had a winter hat on most of the days. It was in the 40ies one night. Fishing was tough too. Our group does not keep exact counts of fish caught. We are there to get away from the exactities of real life.lol. We estimate that we usually catch 60-80 fish a day per guy. We caught maybe 75 each guy for the whole week. According to the people at camp they did worse. The care taker said fishing was tough all June due to the weather. We caught enough Walleye to have two meals and take fish home so we accomplished our goal. We found trolling around 20 feet was our best depth. Greens and bright colors worked best. Perch colors were good as well. Jigging was tough. We could not find leeches so we used worms. We normally don't use plastics but we went to white single tails with worms and the jigging picked up. Depths varied. Throwing spoons in the weeds for pike was tough due to the wind. We found some protected areas and back bays to spoon but had some varying results. Two guys in our group did catch 40 inchers which was great. One caught on a half wave and one caught on a Frisbee made by Sutton spoons tackle company in Naples NY. GREAT UNKNOWN SPOON!!!! Hope you have a great trip!!!!"
6671312,ma1819,2022-07-08 06:57:00,13,"Gouin Report from Air Tamarac - Returned from Gouin Saarana Bay East June 26-29. Our 7th trip to the Gouin, and our largest group ever with 8 fisherman. Tough fishing - Water level was high, and fish were definitely scattered. Outfitter said they had rain almost every day through May - fish were not in their summer mode yet, but were out of the spawning-post-spawn mode so really difficult to pattern. Our group managed just over 150 walleye and 30+ pike in 3 days. Not a lot of success jigging, as we did not find many pods of walleye - most fish caught trolling. Weather was tough, windy/rain/sun every day. Not much size to the walleye - maybe 60-70% were in the keeper slot size, and most of those were at the lower end. Same for the pike, not much for size. We caught enough fish for a few meals, and brought some home, but by far our most challenging trip to the Gouin. Had a fun trip, as we spent the second half of the week (June 29-July 2) at Air Tamarac's trout lake. Same issues there - wind/rain/sun each day and fish were not easy to pattern. Again, we caught fish, but trout were scattered and at a variety of depth's. We did well at some of their satellite hike in lakes, which were shallower and more easy to find fish. As always, Air Tamarac runs a first class outfit. They provided everything we needed to be successful, the fish simply did not cooperate this trip. Looking forward to going back -"
6657724,tweedrules,2022-05-20 09:54:00,107,"Anyone have any news on the Gouin? Ice out? water levels? Fishing conditions. We are going back to Lac Du Male through Air Mt. Laurier after a two year hiatus. CAN""T WAIT. Miss it so much."
6657738,Esoxmike,2022-05-20 10:26:00,114,"Buddies of mine are on their way up right now,ice out in saarana bay east up the river is where they fish"
6657740,tweedrules,2022-05-20 10:30:00,107,"Awesome. Hope the have a great time. I'm sure they will. Keep me updated, please!"
6657822,Andre (wallyandre),2022-05-20 15:31:00,2274,Actually most of the Gouin reservoir is not accessible becaue of soe major rains that damage the roads so before going up call your outfitter.
6657824,Andre (wallyandre),2022-05-20 15:37:00,2274,Only in french but the pics speak for themselves:https://www.ville.latuque.qc.ca/fr/a...ees-a-la-tuque
6658562,tweedrules,2022-05-23 10:48:00,107,"andre, Thanks so much for the pictures. What a crazy scene. So many roads washed out. We are flying out of Ste Veronique. Hopefully we are OK. Got to shift our jigging sites in the high water."
6658678,clegg,2022-05-23 23:36:00,38,We’re scheduled to drive up to Air Tamarac in Clova on Thursday night. Our outfitter hasn’t given us any reason to worry but after reading this thread we’re not concerned. Will post an update if I get some news.
6658698,clegg,2022-05-24 03:24:00,38,Typo. After reading this thread we ARE concerned...
6658722,Andre (wallyandre),2022-05-24 05:27:00,2274,You should be ok by Thursday
6658728,rkc118,2022-05-24 05:38:00,15,"Might want to call them if you plan to drive to Clova, this is what google translate gave me from the website posted above: ""The road between Parent and Mont-Laurier is still closed. There will be work to do before it can be opened again when the water level returns to normal. MTQ teams are already mobilized for this. We will know more about this in the coming days."" That is the route that we have always taken to get there."
