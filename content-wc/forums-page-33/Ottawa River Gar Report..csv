Got the Covid this week though and that coughed up enough time to get spewing stuff out. For any interested, here's a latest about gar fishing around home. Bit of a recap of this season along with some of my history and how it follows along with the OFAH records and other big fish caught over the years. It's good stuff full of big fish, you might like something different. Ottawa River Gar. For The Record. https://bunksoutdoorangle.com/ottawa...or-the-record/Thanks for reading.Bunk"

The bass, walleye, pike and such season, are often still closed. Thanks for reading."
