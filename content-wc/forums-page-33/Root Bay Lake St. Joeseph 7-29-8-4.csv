6677740,Hwasapup,2022-08-06 16:06:00,2,Six man trip did well with well over a 1000 fish for the 6 days. We had been to this camp ten years ago and found the fishing improved. Walleyes were bigger across the board with many in the 22-25 range. Largest fish was 27. Northerns were scattered but active although we focused on walleyes. Largest Northern was 36.Weather was cooler than normal with several rainstorms. Cabin was the same as the previous visit overall camp could use some upgrades. 15 hp Hondas seemed to be the same motors we used on 2012 trip. However given the fact that these outfitters had two years with no income some slack is required. All in all great trip with a quality outfit.
