Brent and Kathie are tremendous hosts and do a great job making sure all of your needs are met. One of the perks fishing out of Evergreen is that their boats have 2 live wells for minnows and run with 60 Yamaha's. We had 3 guys in our boat everyday and it's more than comfortable. Taking my 89 year old father was a true blessing. Mosquitos are horrible at night and for the first time I can remember, they were out during the day at we came back to the dock in the afternoon. Weather was cold and rainy 5 out of the 6 days. We caught fish in 15-25 foot of water. Biggest walleye was 26"" (2) with a few in the 23-24"" range. Had big numbers a couple days, all on jigs tipped with minnows. 2 days were extremely difficult, only boating 30-35 fish between the 3 of us. We made the trip up last year after the border opened and had 4 days of dream fishing. This year was a bit more difficult to locate them, but all in all, a great trip. Caught most of our fish in Steamboat. Same time same place next year and God willing, pops will be fishing with us at 90 years young."
