I will be going mid august this year to Gullrock. Techniques/Depths and such would be greatly appreciated. Also...how are the bugs mid august? looks like temps will be 70 day and like 52 at night.

I love this time of year, lower number of fisherman not that there is every very many, bugs seem to be less troublesome and weather certainly tends to run better. Lake trout will be in there deep water summer pattern easy to target. Walleye will be related to those mid lake humps, and ridges typically any where from 16 - 32 feet depending on the lake, wind, cloud cover etc. for under water ridges and series of humps that have access to deeper water I like to break out the bottom bouncers. Nice way to cover a little ground and validate where the fish are at. If you go over a certain spot and they light up your lines a couple times we just come back around and anchor if its 20ft or less, or we spot lock and start working it over with 1/4 ounce jigs with plastic ringworms, or jerk minnow, or live or dead minnows. Pretty straight forward technique that works in a lot of places. If you have more ground to cover you can pull some deep running crank baits like reef runners, bandits, walleye divers, long-a- bombers etc. Get a few hooks ups then circle back and focus in with jigs, or even blade baits, we even have good luck with Kastmasters tipped with minnows. Have fun."

We spent the bulk of our time last year on them. We also did well along some of the islands. Have to look at my notes but spend most time in 20 to 25 fow.Let us know how you do, especially if there the week ahead of us."
6677364,Walleye2242,2022-08-04 03:58:00,263,i was there last year...the last week of Sept. 1st week of oct. got lucky with weather..it was beautiful. 18-22 FOW seemed to be the ticket for me. Slow drifting jigs. Had alot of luck on burnt island.
6677574,Pink Unicorn,2022-08-05 16:47:00,83,"I have plenty of experience fishing in the first week or two of August... Here's what I've learned. 3/8oz jig with 5"" twister works great. White, smoke and black are all effective. Yellow, chartreuse and watermelon are also good. If the weather is stable and sun is bright, I will tip the jig with 1/2 frozen minnow. If it's choppy and the barometer is changing, I usually don't need the minnow. The structure is usually the same as Mid June-July, but they tend to be deeper. I usually start in 18 FOW and will go down to 30'. My BIL says they aren't as deep this year (high water/cooler temps?) and right now they're getting them at 13-16'. I've struggled on bigger lakes in Sept so I give you credit. If you can catch them then, you'll have no problem getting them in Aug!"
6677584,Old Timer,2022-08-05 18:49:00,255,"My approach to August/September fishing is simple. I'm a bait guy and this time of year it's a minnow (live/salted/frozen) or a night crawler. I prefer a 1/4-1/2 oz jig over a honey hole and sometimes a slip float. When searching I'll use a spinner. Instead of a bottom walker I prefer a bead chain sinker that weighs 3/8-1 oz. I'm sure there other effective methods to catch walleyes in late summer and fall. Some may be better. But the jig, spinner and float have been my go-to tackle for sixty years. They seem to work on every Canadian lake I've fished."
