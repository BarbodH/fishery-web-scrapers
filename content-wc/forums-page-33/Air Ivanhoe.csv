(I know, there may be other great ones out there. We have decided on this based on travel, # outposts, etc.) We have been going to the Key River area (Britt, Ontario) for well over 30 years and will keep going for another 30, or until nature takes its course. We have seen great fishing in this area. Some years better than others but will always catch something and have a good shore lunch. For Air Ivanhoe, we are looking at the month of August 2023. What lakes would be good for northern pike (potential >36"") and walleye. We would like to utilize the walleye for lunch/dinner so not to require extra poundage for food on the flight in. Looking for lakes with an average depth of 7-8 feet and have great potential. Has anyone had a fishing trip with Air Ivanhoe in the past couple years? If so, what was your experience with fishing and the outfitter (recent exposure)? Are there other lake (contour) maps besides the ones I found at Fishing Outposts website? https://fishingoutposts.com/lake-depth-maps/ Thanks in advance!"

Our best fishing in the area was on Lake Pebonishewi in the Northern section. Air Ivanhoe now serves that lake and has renovated the two cabins. We had excellent walleye fishing back then using the lodges steel boats, (wonder if they are still using them), with small motors. It's a large lake and we caught smallmouth, pike, and whitefish also. We targeted walleye. Certainly a chance at good sized pike. Good shorelunch spots, saw several moose. Good luck. Ron"
6675094,kim n indiana,2022-07-25 06:57:00,62,"i flew with air ivanhoe 3 hrs ago. McConnell lake. i'm looking for walleye and smallies, not those slimey snakes. Wife and I go back next month to same lake. AI has good 30 lakes to choose from so if Pike is your desired target, they have it. At Base is notebook on each lake that has been accumulated over years from fishing parties. as i recall, the one for McConnell was good 30 different pages. with marked spots. I didn't fish it hard, but had no problems catching enough walleye to eat every day and enough smallies to have fun. had no problems with outfitter. check flight mid week. no complaints."
6675188,adempsey2.0,2022-07-25 15:45:00,611,I would probably look at their outposts on their larger lakes: Rice Rush Pebonishiwi Bromley and maybe Bonar Air Cochrane has a couple outposts (Partridge and SW Kesagami) with access to Kesagami Lake as well. Might be worth a look. They have 2 outposts on Nettogami Lake which is a decent size as well.
6676024,Fishquest,2022-07-28 16:48:00,89,"Well I have never fished with them they have a great reputation with the customers they have. My brother in-law and his group ahve used them for a few years now and never had a complaint and always positive reports about the trip. They have fished Bonar and always come home with some tasty perch which are easily available on the lake. Give them a call I have talked to Joel a few times at shows and on the phone and he's an upfront person who will asnwer your questions, so he would be best to ask about the fish your after. Good Luck with your plans."

6676958,MicroJay,2022-08-02 06:16:00,2,"Thank you for your inputs! A lot to think about for a place that will be our first time at. When you have been going to the same place for many years, itâ€™s easy to know what to expect. Guess I put too much thought into things to ensure we do not forget anything! &#x1f601;"
6676988,adempsey2.0,2022-08-02 07:48:00,611,"https://www.anglersatlas.com/ has some free maps. Otherwise, you will likely have to pay for a map or use an app like Navionics, Fish ON-Line or Fishbrain. What lake map were you looking for?"
