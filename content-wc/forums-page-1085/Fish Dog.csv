506965,Guest,2000-02-01 20:11:00,0,"Thanks for the tips. I have a map but it's not very good. It shows the contours but not much else. Is Snake Falls in the very North of the lake? I can see where Trout lake river is. We're staying at Northbay Lodge.We spoke to the owner at the All-Canada show, he said that most of the (good fishing) was around and north of the islands near the middle of the lake."
