Anyone have any suggestions on presentations for different situations...good weather, cold front, late ice-out, etc? I am looking to catch lots of walleyes and bronzebacks!!!!!!!!!!!"
506968,Guest,2000-02-03 12:37:00,0,"Walleye-Guy,That is the same week I was there last year and hope to be again this year if work permits. We have a group that takes a house boat out from Souix Narrows Floating Lodges. We primarily troll floating Rapalas shallow along the islands, morning til night. Works well, good action, lazy mans fishing. Usually great weather. Last year cold and rain set in. Had to go deep with jigs and three-ways.Good luck!"

Look for shallow boulder slides, downed timber, flats with fist sized to a bit larger stones scattered...you can cover flats quickly with cranks or spinnerbaits, but my favorite method personally is topwater with pop-r's, torpedoes etc. Cold front means smallies will go from their previous location to the first drop there...and downsize to hair jigs or tubes...hair jigs being my personal favorite.Finicky eyes...you trolling is my favorite too unless you can spot them on a ledge or point holding with a school of smelt. Good luck for those elusive guys.If you have any Rainy Lake experience will you buzz me? I'm going there the beginning of July 4.Tight lines-Tom Hudson"
