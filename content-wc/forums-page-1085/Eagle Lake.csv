Never heard about teh Father/Son package though.Say.... you wouldn't just happen to be the same Fritz that has the Ice Shack to die for, that's currently sitting out there on Clear Lake would you? If so.... I was real sad to hear about the demise of Stereo Stephanie!"

Check out my Eagle Lake Website at: http://wwa.com/~rmryan/Eagle_Lake/eagle_lake.htmlIt's a huge lake (approx 68,000 acres) but there are few large open areas. it has lots of islands and bays so it usually seems like you're fishing a small lake. It quite often you won't see another boat for hours on end.Many nices lodges on the lake. I stay at Temple Bay Lodge. They have great facilities (cabins, boats, etc) and fantastic service. They even provide a bus from the Chicago/Milwaukee area to their lodge.Rick"

I would be careful about what time of the year you go there however. We booked a week around 4th of July and found ourselves fighting a massive mayfly hatch. The walleye fishing completely shut down for about the first three days. I consider myself an avid walleye fisherman, but I had a difficult time catching anything but smallish pike. We did do some lake trout fishing and managed to catch a few smallmouth. Finally the resort owners felt bad because of the poor fishing and one of the guides took us out for free. Even with the guide we were only able to catch 2 walleyes the entire week. I think we should have went musky fishing instead. We saw active muskies everywhere, and those from camp that were fishing muskies had a great time.In my honest opinion, I think there are better choices if you want to catch walleyes. If you are really interested in catching a ton of walleyes, send me an e-mail. We went to a lake near Red Lake last year and had a blast. I'd be happy to give you the details."
506912,Guest,2000-02-02 12:01:00,0,i've been to andy myers lodge several times. last summer we were there for the father/son special. it was great fishing and the kid's loved it. the lodge works hard to put you on fish. i'd highly recommend it.
