506925,Guest,2000-01-29 11:16:00,0,I'm looking for any info on Walleye fishing arround Kitchner Ontario. It's about miles north/east of Detroit. I'm going there this spring and would like to know if it's worth hauling the boat there.
506926,Guest,2000-02-02 06:54:00,0,YOUR CLOSEST WALLEYE LAKE IS GOING TO BE LAKE ERIE WHICH IS ABOUT 1 HOUR SOUTH OF KITCHENER. YOUR BOAT BETTER BE ABLE TO HANDLE BIG LAKE WATERS AS LAKE ERIE BLOWS UP FAST AND FURIOUS IN A STORM. YOU HAVE TO GO OUT A FEW MILES USING DOWNRIGGERS OR PLANERS. THERE ARE NO SMALLER LAKES IN THE AREA. 3 HOURS EAST WILL PUT YOU IN THOUSANDS OF LAKES.
