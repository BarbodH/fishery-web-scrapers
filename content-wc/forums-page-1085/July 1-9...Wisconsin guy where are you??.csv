Rates? Refrig and stove? Do you provide a boat? We are catch and release for everything except for a few 16-18"" eyes or whatever the slot size allows. We would appreciate all the info you could provide, and would be very appreciative guests also. Please feel free to email or post a message for me. Thanks!TOM"
