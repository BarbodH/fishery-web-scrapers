506889,Worm Dunker,2000-01-29 21:30:00,23,"Yes I am the one who went to black lake north. We got loads of fish under16"" our biggest eye was 25"" We were disapointed in the lack of larger fish. Biggest pike for the week was 33"". Thst is why we are looking at Lac Seul for 2000. Have heard good reports on the size of walleyes there."
506890,Guest,2000-01-30 07:11:00,0,"I fished Lac Seul 3 straight years after Memorial weekend, but did not fish there the last 2. We went out of Chamberlain Narrows w. Ojibway Outfitters. First year very good fishing, 2nd year exceptional, 3rd was a little tough (very early spring, fish were not where we expected). Our largest walleye in 3 years was 28 in. I enjoyed the setting in the NE corner of the lake. Pretty easy to get around. The last 2 years I've gone to Lake St. Joseph in Sept. I personally caught 2-27's and a 28 in one day last fall. The fishing has been super & great average size. We've also caught up to 40 in. northerns without fishing them too hard. It's tougher to get around @ this lake. If you ever consider, I'd recommend guides for the first trip or the first few days. We run 20 miles in the fall to get to the best spots. This year I'm taking a spring & fall trip to St. Joe's."
506891,Worm Dunker,2000-01-31 23:05:00,23,Thanks for the reply Andy. Which resort did you stay at on St. Joe. Sounds like you had a good time.The Worm Dunker
506892,Guest,2000-02-01 19:52:00,0,"We stayed with John Grace at the Old Post & Village, http://www.oldpost.com. They have very good customer service, 16 foot Lunds (like the Pike or Angler) and are supposed to have new Merc 30HP four-strokes this year. Very good fish #s and size. Drawbacks: we travel a long way (20 miles) to fish. If you don't like the running & bouncing, it wouldn't be for you. Also, lots of rocks to tangle with your lower unit. If you use their equipment, they'll keep you accountable (have to be careful & best to have a guide to get you started). A hand held GPS and/or someone good with a map come in handy.Lac Seul is good fishing too, but our experience was that it was not as good in mid-summer (maybe a good guide would help there too)."
