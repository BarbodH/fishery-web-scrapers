From what I've read, the smallies are supposed to be incredible, and a walleye population is getting strong again, but that's all lodge propaganda. Any info would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"
506972,Guest,2000-02-03 08:59:00,0,"I live next to Rainy and fish it alot. the fishing is great for smallmouth with many big fish. The northern fishing is also very good with a solid crack at a monster. The walleye's are still recovering from the slaughter in the 50's and 60's. There is a strong year class 95 that is providing most of the walleye action. Your host Tom is a pretty good bass fisherman if you can get him out, and placed 13th in the Canadian Bass Championship last year. Head for the big water if your looking to land that 6 lb smallie.Good Luck....Jeff"
506973,KnottyBuoy,2000-02-03 15:19:00,110,I caught one of the fishing shows last week with a couple guys out after small mouth on Rainy Lake ........they were pitching plugs over a rock pile.....they were catching walleyes trying to catch the smallies.....Turned the station and 2 guys were pitching muskie baits on Leech Lake in Minn.....the guy catches a 6 to 7 pound walleye on a huge wood lure.......Makes a guy wonder...!
506974,Guest,2000-02-03 16:45:00,0,"I also catch lots of incidental walleye on Rainy while fishing for smallmouth and muskie. Big bait seems to work wonderful for the eye's someday's,it also weeds out the small one's. My favorite cross species big plug would have to be a 9"" big Ernie. Jeff"
506975,Guest,2000-02-03 19:49:00,0,"I fish Rainy Lake every year for two weeks in July and have been doing that since 1988. It is a perfect time of year to. the fishing is great and the kids enjoy the water. We stay on the Minnesota side, but fish the whole lake. We fish mostly walleyes on the Minnesota side becasue we can keep them although that is suppose to change this year I've heard. We fish for walleyes done in saganaw bay, northerns in rocky and rice, crappies in black bay and smallies in sand bay. I know these are big areas, but is is hard to be more specific. We make several looooong trips during the time we are up there to far away places like kettle falls, northwest bay, ash bay, northern part of redgut.Bring good maps or buy them locally. They are expensive, but and a full collection my cost you $100.... start with the ones your going to use and add to your collection if you need. It's a big body of water and easy to get lost or confused.Hope this helps.Chester"
