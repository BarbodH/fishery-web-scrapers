I wanted Lac Seul but they lack the smallies up on the N side, so we've narrowed it down to Pickerel Lake, Rainy Lake camp narrows and the Winnipeg River system. We'd also prefer to have as much seclusion as possible. With all the lodges and info I've been sent I can't make *#@$ing sense of any of it. Could someone PLEASE help me with a suggestion? Thanks a million gentlemen...I owe you one!"

From mid to late May thru the end of June the smallies are on their beds. You can catch as many as you want every day- 50/75/100 whatever(light winds and sun help). This is catch and release only!! The smallies **average ** 3-4#.Average day you can get several 18""-19"" Last June 16 I finally got the big one 22 3/4"" and it's going on the wall(replica)! A small one would be 15"" seriously. Anyways the lake is also great for walleye, northern and monster musky. The only catch is the clear water makes fishing a real challange. I'm willing to rent for weekend/week if your interested. It's also a great set up for the family, what better way for kids to catch fish than to have them battle 4# smallies!! Post or try e-mail if you wish. Good luck!!"
