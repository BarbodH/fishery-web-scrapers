506947,KnottyBuoy,2000-02-01 11:19:00,110,I heard from a fairly reliable source that there is a road plowed from Nestor Falls all the way out to Sand Bay......can anyone confirm this for sure.....
506948,dlhomes,2000-02-02 16:56:00,62,I fished out of Nestor Falls last March and they had roads plowed all over. I don't know where Sand Bay is but I'll bet they have roads plowed to it!!
