506943,Steve,2000-02-01 04:44:00,259,I am going to Rice Lake in Ontario this summer. It's cold and snowy now but I can't wait to get there. Does anyone have any cords for good fishing spots or good fishing tips? I hope this is a good lake. Looking for panfish and walleye. Thanks for any help.
506944,Guest,2000-02-02 06:42:00,0,"STEVE: I LIVE IN THE KAWARTHAS AND AM ABOUT 30 MINUTES FROM RICE LAKE. I HAVE ONLTY FISHED THERE A FEW TIMES BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED. THE WALLEYE ARE SOMETIMES FINICKY AS ANYWHERE ELSE BUT THIS LAKE IS REFERED TO AS THE ""FISH FACTORY"" BY THE LOCALS. IT HAS HEAVY FISHING PRESSURE YET PRODUCES LOTS OF FISH ESPECIALLY PAN FISH. I LIKE FISHING AROUND THE ISLANDS IN STRUCTURE WHERE I HAVE MARKED A LOT OF FISH (BUT CAUGHT FEW) IT IS GOOD FOR SMALL MOUTH BASS ESPECIALLY. TALK TO THE LOCALS BUT MAKE SURE YOU FAMILIARIZE YOURSELF WITH THE SUNKEN RAILWAY LINE OR YOU WILL BE BUYING A NEW LOWER END FOR YOUR BOAT. GOOD LUCK!"
