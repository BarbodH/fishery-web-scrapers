3991602,curt1321,2015-06-23 09:00:00,16,"Plotman,Here is a quick gear list I have for an outpost type trip to Canada. I use a spreadsheet for organizing the gear based on category. That way I can multi-purpose the list for ice fishing and hunting trips also. I use G for gear, FG for fishing gear, E for Electronics, M for Miscellaneous, C for Clothing, and F for Food. Hope this helps."

5382074,fishpoop,2017-03-08 03:07:00,630,"I've made many trips to popular muskie lakes in N.W. Ontario in past years. I don't know if I'm cursed with bad luck or not but it seemed like every time I went I'd have some sort of mechanical breakdown. From flat tires to other trailer problems, to cracked motor blocks, to scorched cylinders from bad camp gas, to you name it. If something was going to go wrong it would do it in Canada. I learned a couple of things from that.1. Parts from Winnipeg take a week. What I mean is that the marine dealers do not stock a large supply of parts inventory like they do here in the States. Even a simple water pump impeller or trailer bow stop roller would have to be special ordered from Winnipeg and delivery took a week. Well, there goes that week long vacation fishing trip. I don't blame the marine dealers, they don't have a high enough demand and it costs to have a large parts supply. 2. Carry your own spare parts. I now carry a spare water pump impeller kit, timing belt for the motor, spark plugs, 2 spare trailer tires, trailer bearings, trailer wiring harness, extra tail lamp, extra transducer for depth finder, oil, grease, Sta-bil, boat drain plug, oil filter for the motor, gas filter, because... Parts From Winnipeg take a week. All this in addition to the regular normal maintenance that I, and everyone, does who owns a boat. I've learned the hard way that if something is going to go wrong it will do so in Canada. I was lucky on my last trip up there, all week and nothing major broke. A first time for everything, I guess."
5384858,Aspencreek,2017-03-09 07:00:00,2911,"Interesting how an original thread from several years ago gets reintroduced. I was reviewing my list from last year and found my original from 1999. Man! did I over pack that first year. But being the guy that tries to plan for every contingency it comes with the territory. Biggest differences now, clothes...with the new synthetics and cooling fabrics, I pack half as much, and they can be washed in the shower or lake and hung to dry overnight and be fresh as a daisy in the am. And I now pack items that can serve multi purpose, take only as much medication as I will need for the trip, prepare meals before hand and freeze (we eat really well, and not fish everyday) and keep the bulk to a minimum."
5385050,lawson2343,2017-03-09 08:27:00,459,"Great lists included in this thread. I may have missed these on someones list so forgive me if duplicating, but I always take the following as well: - water sox - for the boat, nice to have if you have to get in the water at shore lunch or launching - flip flops - going to and from the shower And it was mentioned to bring your license and outdoors card. One thing I do besides have printed copies is create a pdf and put it on my phone. That way if somehow I misplace them, I can pull them up on the phone. A buddy had that happen to him last year, but because he had them on his phone the CO let him pass."
5385090,packpro,2017-03-09 08:39:00,695,I have a pretty good list edited and modified over the last 19 years. It's a word doc so I cannot post here. The word doc will allow you to modify it to your specific needs. Anyone interested can PM me and I'll send it to you via email.
5389466,NWwalleye,2017-03-11 15:55:00,223,Change it to a pdf file ... WC lets you download a bigger file in this format than word.doc ..Just went through this process on Walleye weight chart in the Canada section .. lol
3962025,Plotman,2015-06-13 08:14:00,394,"Being the ""retentive"" type I like to make lists to compensate for my lack of ability in remembering things. We are soon to depart for trout river lodge in ontario and am inquiring if any other like minded folks have a ""packing list"" of items that they would like to share regarding what to bring? We will be driving a suburban and pulling a boat for about 14hrs. Look forward to seeing what items I have forgotten."
3962113,bigdaddyguns,2015-06-13 09:30:00,608,There has been a few food/trip/packing list threads the last few years that will help you. Also there was a thread dedicated to forgotten items as well. Search on those keywords and you will find a wealth of information to fashion into your own style of list.
3962209,Plotman,2015-06-13 10:09:00,394,"already did before posting using keywords ""list"" and ""trip List"". lots of hits using those keywords but, didn't see any actual lists on the first few pages,maybe need to dig deeper."
3962353,Richard B,2015-06-13 10:57:00,735,This is my list that I have been using for almost 30 years. Every year it gets reviewed and items added and removed.
3963937,adempsey,2015-06-13 22:18:00,963,"I put some bulleted lists here. I've always meant to put up a list you could download, but haven't done so. Perhaps I should do that."

3964489,SinOrSwim,2015-06-14 08:14:00,1528,"Last year I took my son to Hawk Lake and that was the first time I had been to an all inclusive lodge. For 20+ years we have read nets, minnow buckets, fish finders etc etc etc .........all included. Only to find crappy stuff so we always just took our own. Food, beverages, you name it in addition to fishing equipment.Well, last year I packed like I normally would. LOL I didn't realize when we arrived THEY unload the truck and haul all our gear to the cabin. I was embarrassed because I WAYYYYY over packed!!!!! hahahaha. I had totes full of gear, fish finder, nets, beverages etc. When in reality it was ALL provided and it was in great shape. Those poor guys had to make a couple trips with all my stuff. Going back in a couple weeks and I will pack much much less for that trip."
3964833,Plotman,2015-06-14 09:51:00,394,"Nice work guys,keep them coming. Guessing a few of you were fellow boy scouts back in the day and remember the phrase ""be prepared"". I can only imagine what is in the boy scout handbook these days!!! When it comes to relying on someone, I really don't want to have to look past that guy in the mirror if at all possible."
3988298,SteveZ,2015-06-22 10:04:00,271,"A couple of items that I always take: Afterbite Super Glue The ""No See Ums"" were horrible last week and the Afterbite takes the itch away quickly. Always seem to get a couple of finger buggers from northerns and the super glue works very good to close up the wound. I swear by it."
3990434,Aspencreek,2015-06-22 22:05:00,2911,"Something I discovered about 10 yrs ago ""Wet wipes, diaper wipes, etc."" Leave the toilet paper at camp, and take a package of these. Multiple uses, and will clean better, even your hands! They come in their own container, and they are all ready moist so if the get wet who cares."
