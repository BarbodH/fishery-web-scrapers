5313225,Daveygravy,2017-02-04 14:29:00,88,I was going through a tackle box full of Musky baits ( bought them all about 25 years ago ) and came across these single hook jerkbaits. I can't remember the name of them. I also found a couple of eagle tail bucktails as well. I was wondering if I should add these to my arsenal or not.
5313273,1K1MOA,2017-02-04 14:57:00,90,I love watching pike smash baits on the surface!
5313481,muskyroller,2017-02-04 18:36:00,56,"Looks like a dive and rise, jerk bait. Could work fine. Looks like a Wade's Wobbler. Probably be better off with a Suick or Bobbie Bait or Intimidator...if you like that style of jerkbait. As for the Eagletails...nah, don't use em', and sell them to me ;o)"
5319849,fishpoop,2017-02-08 01:43:00,630,"I looked at this 2 days ago and I've racked my brain since trying to remember what this lure name and manufacturer is and I still can't think of it. I have one too, in all black. It is a dive and rise jerkbait. It was around in the mid 90's but I haven't seen one in a long time. I forgot I had one until I saw this picture. Sorry, I just can't seem to remember. I can tell you more of what it is NOT than what it is. lol It's not a Wade's Wobbler. seek linkhttps://www.muskytackleonline.com/wa...-wades-wobblerIt's not a... Suick, Bobbie, Hi-Fin Fooler, Stidham Muskie Sensor, Dick Gries jerkbait. I would post this on a muskie fishing specific website message board and I would bet you'd get an answer from someone who has a better memory than I do.Yes, to using the Eagle Tails."
5319865,fishpoop,2017-02-08 01:50:00,630,"Even if we can't remember the names of these lures, I'd try fishing them anyhow. I remember using mine a few times over weedbeds and it was pretty weedless. The only thing I didn't like was that it rose fairly quickly on the pause. If I tried fishing it again I'd put a small split ring on the front hook screw eye and add a bell sinker to that to help slow down the rate of raise on the pause. Add a plastic twister tail to the rear hook too. But I still can't remember the darn name."
5392882,muskyroller,2017-03-13 06:38:00,56,"I was going through the MN musky expo Friday night and came across the bait you pictured and remember seeing your post. So, I snapped a quick picture and checked out the info on the back of the packaging. It is made by the same guy that makes the Wade's Wobbler. It's called a ""Musky Bandit II."" It was manufactured (or at least packaged) in Ham Lake, MN."
5392930,Bill Krejca,2017-03-13 07:26:00,6107,"If you can come up with a bait that everyone else is not using, my observation had been that it might be a good one to try. Baits that are a little ""different"" than what most folks have in their tackle box can sometimes be producers. This is one of several reasons why I make so many of my offerings. Bill"
5393226,fishpoop,2017-03-13 09:02:00,630,"I didn't make it to the muskie expo this weekend so I'm sorry I missed this. Thank you for your reply with the name and manufacturer. I would never have remembered it on my own. Now that I hear it and think about it, it seems vaguely to come back to my mind. I didn't know they were still being made."
