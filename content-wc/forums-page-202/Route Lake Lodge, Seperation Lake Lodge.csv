5276458,The tank,2017-01-17 18:58:00,340,Haven't stayed at the lodge but fished speration lake. We always stayed at the camp grounds. Walleye and smallmouth fishing is really good in that area. Sorry can't help with the lodge.
5277290,Multispecies Guy,2017-01-18 08:39:00,447,+1 Been a little over 20 years for me but I recall some very good smallmouth fishing when we day fished from the campground.
5277858,Pooch,2017-01-18 15:30:00,4618,"We stayed at RLL many years ago. Nice camp. Good cabins. Pretty lake. Fishing was OK, but we were there when we first started fishing Canada in the very early 1990's and didn't know what we were doing, so factor that in.Lake has public access so you will see locals occasionally fishing the lake. Not a big deal. It is someplace I would take my wife to. Like I said, I liked it because of the setting of the lake. We caught enough fish to keep us happy.Sorry I can't help you more, but I saw no one else answering your post.Pooch"

I found their cabins to be on the older side, but they were clean and equipped with everything needed. The chain of lakes you will have access to all have excellent walleye, smallmouth and pike fishing. Be sure spend some time throwing some bass spin baits, cranks and spoons for northerns. There are some big ones on this body of water. I haven't been to the resort since Bill the original owner died. A couple of his kids have taken over. The guy that runs the campground has told me they are doing a good job."
