So....here is a video from last fall, out for grouse and walleye at Lac Seul with my best pal Roloff.https://youtu.be/wP8WmGSmtUE"

I was intrigued as I watched you clean your grouse near your tailgate with the door to your truck open (with Roloff inside). I had to keep Jesse locked in my truck whenever I cleaned birds in the field. I usually tried to clean my birds near a creek or the shore of a lake or river. If I didn't lock Jesse in my truck, he'd attempt to retrieve the feathered carcass as it floated away. The noises Jesse would make in the back of his throat while I cleaned grouse are not easily described. Thanks for sharing."

I would like to get your POV on my experience because overall I was a bit disappointed. We found lack of density of birds - you could get your limit by driving on the roads and shooting them like you did (I have nothing against this by the way, just not how I like to hunt). But when we put the dogs down in the woods, the density of the birds were simply not enough there to make it effective. We would put up about 1 grouse per hour, with a brace of good pointers down. Just for reference, I average about 8 birds per hour between grouse and woodcock in Wisconsin. So the dogs can hunt, that is not the issue. Near Dryden, are the bird numbers better? Does anyone hunt on foot or is it all by driving around? I would like to try a cast and blast again, but need to have better density to be effective on how I like to hunt."
