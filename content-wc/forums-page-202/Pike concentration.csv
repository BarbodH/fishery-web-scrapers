5376962,Bill Krejca,2017-03-06 06:54:00,6107,"Obabikon has nice size pike, along with about any other fish, other than trout. It can be a great lake to fish. Bill"
5377058,Baseline,2017-03-06 07:40:00,3207,"I've never been in to Obabakon, but I don't doubt it to be very true that it is a good pike location. Best pike fishing I've personally found on LOW has been in the east 1/2 of Stevens Bay and the south end of Whitefish bay. In Whitefish you can expect your normal slew of small pike. But, over 3 days of pike fishing you will catch many that are 6 to 10 lbs and several 10 to 15 lbs. Although rare the big pike are in there. You will be more likely to catch big musky than a big pike. Whitefish also has a health population of largemouth and smallmouth bass. Steven's Bay has big population of small pike. Larger pike are a bit more difficult to come by. I've never spent much time fishing on Lac Suel, but I've caught many nice sized pike while fishing for walleyes."
5377642,The tank,2017-03-06 10:13:00,340,I would have to second both obabikon and prov. I've caught some real big pike on Wabaskang and in the obabikon area. Gawleys parkview camp is still one of my favorite places to go. Brevin and Afton are great hosts. We haven't stayed with Jared but looking at this September or next spring. And also love that part of LOW.
5378218,Obabikon,2017-03-06 13:54:00,2370,"You're going to catch some hammer handles, some ""keepers"", and some big girls. I've caught pike bigger than 40"" up there... but Obaibkon Lake is not Lake Athabasca. You're not going up there to catch 40"" pike all day."
5378346,jambi,2017-03-06 14:33:00,504,"Agree w/ most of this about Steven's Bay. I did 10 trips to Young's Wilderness Camp. My Dad and I would average 16-20 pike greater than 32"" each week we were here. I think we'd have 1-3 over 40"" each week as well. Did 7 trips around Memorial Day and 3 trips around Labor Day. Fished for pike almost exclusively. Summer I can see it being slower for pike as everything gets pretty choked up w/ weeds pretty well. As for numbers, yes lots of 20 to 24"" fish in there for sure. Throw in the occasional accidental muskie, many walleye, smallmouth, and spring crappie pounding, and that adds to the fun. Love YWC. Only reason I dont go back is I've switched to flyouts further north. When I wear myself out I will back to YWC for sure."
5375906,That Minnesota guy,2017-03-05 16:36:00,8293,In everyone's opinion where would the Pike concentration be highest.......Lac Seul or LOTW? I think for short notice trips I might be better off with LOTW but darn......thats a big splash of water to find fish in. Thoughts / opinions? Thank you.
5376034,prov1800,2017-03-05 17:42:00,5010,Your right.but lac suel isnt a pond either.not sure about about pike on lotw although iam sure it has great pike fishing.i can vouch for LS.if you have some experience pike fishing iam surecyou would find some as they are not hard to find.about zero pressure on them.but if you are looking for some what smaller waters with excellent pike i would look at wabaskang lake and clay lake.these two lakes produce some good quality pike.early spring being the best as the big pike are still fairly shallow.
5376042,Obabikon,2017-03-05 17:47:00,2370,"Obabikon Lake is by far the best option for catching large numbers of Northern Pike. We catch a ton of fish. If you can find some of the better weedbeds, you can catch nice ones too."
5376066,That Minnesota guy,2017-03-05 17:58:00,8293,Thanks guys. My main concern I guess would be finding lodging on a short notice trip.
5376122,Obabikon,2017-03-05 18:31:00,2370,Morson has quite a few options. I think you'd probably have a tough time in the month of June right now... but the rest of the season will have openings. May is one of the best times for pike fishing.
5376138,That Minnesota guy,2017-03-05 18:35:00,8293,"Jared, would you have something short notice in May if my schedule allows?"
5376178,muskyman73,2017-03-05 19:00:00,402,I have never seen more northern than Obabikon. Hands down.
5376266,Obabikon,2017-03-05 19:44:00,2370,"Most likely, yes. I know we're completely full starting June 1st. Memorial Weekend will be pretty busy, but usually have openings. If by some chance I can't, I can make a few phone calls for you. I'm sure I can find you a place to stay."
5376330,That Minnesota guy,2017-03-05 20:03:00,8293,Thanks!
5376882,prov1800,2017-03-06 06:24:00,5010,What is the average size of those northerns.there are tons of lakes in ontario that will boost catching northers all day long but if there hammer handles that wouldnt be to exciting.
