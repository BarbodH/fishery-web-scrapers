The hazards are very well marked in this part of the lake and it is very easy to navigate. We have fished from Vermilion Bay, out to the West Arm and as far south as Bottle Bay and Canoe Island areas. I purchased a Fishing Hot Spots map ( # Q280) for our first trip and it is fairly accurate on where hazards are located for the sections we have fished. The map covers the entire lake system. I think it ran $10 or $12 bucks with free shipping and it is waterproof. I'm sure chips have hazards marked fairly well also. During our trips, I have never heard of anyone dropping a prop or lower unit. Tons of structure and weedy bays to fish for 7 different species. If one is interested in a more remote experience, there are a few other lakes to fish that can be portages into on foot. Feel free to PM me if you want some more detailed information on the lodge and spots to fish on the part of the lake. We will be there the week of June 24 - August 1st. Give Gord at V-Bay Lodge a call and talk to him about that section of the lake. PjShorthorn"
