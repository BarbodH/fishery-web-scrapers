That said, I was wondering if there are some of you who have gone to several different lodges out of the Nakina area, such as Brace Lake and Esnagami Lake, and can compare the fishing, facilities, overall experience, etc. I know Leuenberger's Kag Lake Lodge has nice cabins and boats/motors, with the staff being very service oriented, and the fish are generally bigger here than surrounding outpost lakes. I do the housekeeping plan which is a nice option to have for a lodge."
5284050,oleJoe,2017-01-21 20:26:00,114,Brace lake offers house keeping also. Good cabins and boats. You can fish Meta lake also. Short boat ride. Excellent walleye and pike. They fly out of Nakina with Nakina air. Very nice couple are on premise.

5284626,onetimedave,2017-01-22 09:28:00,502,"Second Ole Joe's comment. Great facilities with young couple giving superior service. Lots of water to fish in addition of Brace Lake, Meta Lake, Ara Lake and Meta Creek."
5291906,tparker,2017-01-25 14:07:00,100,"Looking at the Ara Lake Camp website, being able to fish Ara for a week for $1110.00 Canadian is a bargain. I have stayed at Meta Lake Lodge three times in the past 6 years, and always made the long run over to Ara a few times each week. Lots of walleye and some big northerns. I've never stayed at the camp, but to be able to fly in to Ara for that price looks like a very good price. Tim"
5314401,wdkott,2017-02-05 11:46:00,26,"Thanks for all the inputs. Speaking of the Nakina area, does anyone have a favorite outpost camp they go to and could share some information about the fishing, cabin, boats/motors, etc.? I've been to several Leuenberger's outposts. with favorite being Felsia for the walleye fishing on Hurst Lake (the Felsia cabin faces Hurst about 100 years away). Nice cabin, boats, motors, and nice shallow water jig fishing on Hurst in June."
5361441,35yearsnorth,2017-02-27 10:57:00,1,Ara lake has best walleye fishing by far for lakes in this area. Regularly see fishermen from Meta and Brace lakes fishing here. Very good pike fishing as well. Good choice.
5369570,1K1MOA,2017-03-02 14:21:00,90,"If you want something to drive to in that area, check out lower twin lake lodge. I was there a couple of years ago early September. They charged two of us for the little cabin and then put us in their biggest for the week, shower, bath, etc. We appreciated it. Twin lakes has some good fishing for Walleye and Northerns."

5390466,onetimedave,2017-03-12 07:49:00,502,"This young couple is the new owner of Melchett Lake. Melchett Lake is a fish factory. Much incoming water which leads to great fishing both for ""eyes"" and pike. Mouth of Kap river where it enters Melchett is a place your could spend the entire day and never run out of fish. Many other spots. It is about a 30 minute flight out of Nakina. PM me and I can give you more info. [email protected]"
