5381514,515,2017-03-07 18:05:00,254,We take in 4-5 litres (1 Gallon) for a week long trip with 6 guys. As mentioned by others we tend to pan fry our fish instead of deep frying it and with the smaller amount of oil used we always have lots left over. Since we a have a bonfire every night we burn off the oil on a hot fire so it doesn't go into the ground or remain around to attack wildlife.
5383914,Baseline,2017-03-08 16:11:00,3207,"I couldn't imagine eating fried fish every day for a week, but that's just my tastes. We bring in enough oil for a couple fish frys. All the fly-ins I've been on always had wood and a fire ring. We burned it up in the fire. It always gives me pause to see how volatile the fire burns with the oil remembering that I just ate that stuff."

5385490,Bill Krejca,2017-03-09 11:26:00,6107,"When we camped, we poured the used oil in the fire pit on some of the fire wood, it made starting the fire much easier. Never ever had a bear problem, but it certainly could seem to be a potential problem. When staying in a drive-to cabin, I save some of the larger cans from our gourmet(?) dinners, and put the oil in them for the hosts to dispose of.(What do you suppose they do with it?) I generally do not use a lot of oil, even though I normally fry some fish every day. Prefer to just put some oil in a cast pan and fry on the stove. I do use a thermometer in the oil to manage the temperature. Bill"
5385610,QuikNet,2017-03-09 13:33:00,237,We had Canadian guides use brick lard to fry the fish . It comes in a box / brick like cheese and you cut off what you need to fry the days catch fish. I think the lard works better not sure how good its is on your heart but it sure tastes good . I always been under the opinion that either vegetable oil or even lard was a biodegradable product and always have dug a small hole off the beaten path to dispose of.
5385666,pjshorthorn,2017-03-09 14:23:00,5654,Tenderflake lard in 1b bricks works well if you want to fry fish in the pan. Not a good option if you want to deep fry fish. Easy on fly in weight requirements and you really don't have to worry about carrying excess oil out. My grandmother made it a fishing trip requirement to bring back Tenderflake lard from Canada so she could make pie crusts. My wife has the same requirement as well. I stocked my wife up last season Nothing like homemade pies !!! PjShorthorn
5378266,Yooper61,2017-03-06 14:06:00,80,This may be a stupid question but how much oil do you bring on fly-ins and how do you dispose of it? I could see myself and the group eating walleye/pike 2-3 times a day. Do you bring an empty container(s) for used oil? I would imagine you can filter/reuse the oil a few times but How do you discard it? Oil is not light so do you pan fry vs. deep fry to conserve oil? Just a thought as I am beginning to plan my first fly-in for next year.
5379010,Pooch,2017-03-06 18:48:00,4618,"Four guys for a week, we take a five quart bottle (Sam's Club). That gives us oil for fish and anything else that requires a little oil. We also take cheesecloth along and strain it everyday or two. When done we return it to the original container which is always interesting as you can see how much oil we actually consumed that week.We would rather have a little extra than run out or if someone burns the oil too hot. With four to six guys for a two week trip we take two of the five quart bottles of oil from Sam's Club an there is usually very little left in the end. We also make a cake and other goodies on our trips so we do use oil.Don't forget that cooking oil is used in a lot of other cooking besides fish.Pooch"
5379250,Aspencreek,2017-03-06 20:15:00,2911,"Same here,better to have too much than not enough, baking some goodies after dinner, Bread, cake, cookies, etc. helps to get the Fried fish and ""guy"" smell out of the cabin and are really easy. I'd rather cook or bake something than play cards. I also use a gallon ziplock with oil and a seasoning packet and marinade chicken breasts for a day or 2 in the fridge. Lots of uses."
5379850,SinOrSwim,2017-03-07 06:42:00,1528,Ask your outfitter where they want you to dispose of it. Some want in the fire pit and burn and some do not. Some have a container and they will take it out. Either way they will tell you what they want you to do with it. Take the big container. filtering and all that is a pain. Messy and you have to wait til it cools etc. figure out how many times you want to use it. Pour some water in a pot at home simulating and measure that. Then take a bit more.
5379914,MrSimon,2017-03-07 07:06:00,922,"Whether it's right or wrong, I'd wager the vast majority of used cooking oil at camps gets tossed in the bushes out back, or dumped in the fire pit. I'll admit that's what we do with it."
5379930,Golden Eagle,2017-03-07 07:13:00,2642,"Used cooking oil attracts bears. We burn it, outside, at the end of our stay. Better if there's a burn barrel. Not good to allow used cooking oil to seep into soil.Flying used oil back to town is not a huge problem. A gallon has turned into about 3 quarts by the end of a fishing week."
5380194,MrSimon,2017-03-07 09:02:00,922,"Like was mentioned above, how you cook makes a big difference. We pan fry our fillets which doesn't use much oil. After making a dinner of fish for the group, we have maybe a cup of oil left over in the pan. It get's poured over the logs in the fire pit and is burned off in about five minutes. If we were deep frying fish and had a bunch of used oil left over .... well, we'd probably still just burn it."
5380250,bthomas3333,2017-03-07 09:17:00,465,We used to deep fry 12 fish for 8 guys. We usually had leftovers for lunch sandwiches. We would deep fry 3-4 times over the course of a week. We would bring in 3 gallons of oil. At the end of the week we would have less than a gallon left.B-
5380706,prov1800,2017-03-07 12:25:00,5010,Not a fan of deep fried fish.i love the tradition lay it skin side down in a pan and fry it on both sides.always turns out flaky and not over cooked in a deep fryer.uses less oil.can bring in some veggie lard in blocks.burn old oil or dump ig on a island as not to atteact bears and other critters.bears will find you no matter what.your still cooking and theyll smell it.of course doing this on a open fire just adds to the whole experience.
5381434,drlee,2017-03-07 17:57:00,409,"Our group of 7-8 guys cook walleye nightly for 6 nights. I use only peanut oil, since it can get really hot and ""flash fry"" without smoking/burning. I take 3 gallons for the week and often have a bit left over. We empty the used oil back into the original plastic bottles and leave them for the camp to care for, at their request. We use an electric deep fryer that has two baskets. Because our oil is so hot, when we pull the fillets out of the deep fryer an place it on paper towels, there is almost literally no grease spot. We do ""chunk"" the walleye fillets, about three pieces per 1 side fillet, since they seem to cook quicker. We use various shore lunch breading. Cajun, Corn Bread, Regular, and Buffalo when we can find it. Gettin' hungry, gotta go..."
