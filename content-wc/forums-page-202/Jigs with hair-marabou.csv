5366882,maddogg,2017-03-01 10:18:00,178,One of the first years I went to Canada fishing (1960s)we took a guide he took my bucktail jig and cut the hair off of it. He said '' You don't need that crap on up here''. I haven't used it since.
5369562,1K1MOA,2017-03-02 14:10:00,90,"When you are tipping with a minnow, it is hard to know if it is the minnow or the jig pattern that is being effective, in comparison to jig/minnow only. I have used hair jigs/ minnows a few times while buddy was using plain jig/ minnow and we were about the same catch rate. When I fish without minnows and he is fishing minnows, my catch rate is about 1 for every 2 he is catching. When action is good why keep baiting up. I like white with red hair streak or yellow for dirtier water, and for clear water a perch pattern that they seem to really like. When they have the tinsel flash in them, I find I am donating many of those to Northerns."
5370842,HeHooksHimself,2017-03-03 07:39:00,725,"One of our group started using black/black crappie jigs especially for smallies and he was slaying them. Now he uses them for walleye frequently and does very well with them. He does not tip them. He is a very good fisherman, always catches the most but usually not the biggest. For me, I can't seem to get away from sunrise thumper jigs and a minnow. That's my go to."
5372290,Capt Morgan,2017-03-03 16:51:00,77,4 years ago I absolutely smoked my wife in Canada using a white hair jig vs. Her favorite jig and minnow. This led to me buying many more for both of us to use.
5377666,The tank,2017-03-06 10:25:00,340,Where we fish nothing works as good as a pink sparkle jig with pink and a little silver hair. Haven't used hair jigs in years but the last 2 and it's my go to jig. The other 2 that work very well are chartreuse-blue and peach sparkle.
5364346,BornToFish,2017-02-28 09:27:00,1224,"Greetings,Our ice fishing season in Wisconsin has come to an abrupt end - no safe ice! I find my thoughts drifting towards an upcoming fishing trip to NW Ontario in mid-May. Past experience at this point in the season has shown me that fishing shallow water near shorelines to be an effective approach for walleyes, especially near their spawning areas when the wind is blowing in. Casting a jig + minnow and slowly moving it along is a proven presentation.I was thinking of trying a jig with marabou or hair this upcoming May in place of a standard painted jig. I could fish the hair/marabou jig with or without any bait.Do any of you have experience with hair/marabou jigs at this time of the season? I would be delighted to hear of your experience as I might tie up a bunch of jigs during the next weeks when there is little else to do.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5364362,mjayn,2017-02-28 09:36:00,1188,I have a friend that makes hair jigs from deer and squirrels he hunts. In spring we have done well with the squirrel jigs. Gray head and gray or white hair. Gray/gray always did better. We caught them with and without minnow. No reason not to give them a try.
5364674,bthomas3333,2017-02-28 11:34:00,465,Hello - I have always done better with hair jigs vs Marabou. My uncle used to tie them up for us. The best color has been Orange head / Orange Hair / Red thread. White / Pink was probably second best for us. Then Chart / Yellow and finally Black / Black. Give it a try. If the bite is tentative I tend to go with just a minnow. If the bite is aggressive I will go with twisty tails.All works to to different degrees depending on the season and body of water. Some bodies of water I have fished demand just a jig head and bait with no hair or tail.Give it a shot. Kinda cool to fish your own baits.B-
5364754,Ricky Spanish,2017-02-28 11:57:00,1298,"Sorry, a little off topic, but we would absolutely slay the crappies on tinsel jigs at Lake Shelbyville in IL. I never used bait. I rarely see them, and never any selection to choose from. They seem simple enough that even I might be able to make some. Anyone use them on ""northern"" pannies or walleye? My favorite WI lake, Turtle-Flambeau Flowage, seems like a place it could work."
5365242,Bill Krejca,2017-02-28 14:40:00,6107,"I have been making my own versions of same for a long, long time,about 45 years, have taken about everything that I can think of on them. My experience with the kind I make has been that they work best in semi to cloudy water, not as good in clear water. Usually. Bill"
5365482,BornToFish,2017-02-28 15:44:00,1224,"Greetings,Bill, your report is encouraging to me. The lake that I will be fishing this spring is fairly stained water. The location on the lake that I have in mind receives a fair amount of wind/waves. The water then becomes cloudy due to roiled up sand and silt, in addition to being stained. I'm thinking that the hair/marabou jigs should work pretty well under these conditions.Do you tip your hair/marabou jigs with bait?Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5365530,Baseline,2017-02-28 16:05:00,3207,Shallow water allows for a light jig. I sometimes use 1/8 ball jigs with bucktail in light colors like white and chartreuse. If I have the store bought bucktails I trim the hair just to the bend of hook. I also trim any bucktail this is not inline with the shank of the hook. This allows the jig to fall more slowly and puts some flash on the action. I always use a minnow hooked so the tail is up.
5365570,yoopertrout,2017-02-28 16:30:00,1172,I fish an artificials only walleye lake. I tied up some jigs with marabou and some with rabbit strips and crystal flash. Sad to say they haven't worked as well for me as twister tails.
5365922,BornToFish,2017-02-28 19:50:00,1224,"Greetings,I have a question for Baseline. I followed what you were saying until you stated that you hook a minnow so the tail is up. I am having trouble picturing what you are trying to say. Please elaborate for me.Many thanks."
5366010,Bill Krejca,2017-02-28 20:43:00,6107,"For one reason or another, I have gotten away from marabou, and use various patterns of buck tail, mixed with tinsel-type material. I use meat sparingly, sometimes it matters, but I normally like to almost always use Berkley Power Scent. I think as a person, especially male, ""matures"", we tend to give off an offensive scent. I believe the scent offsets this, so I squeeze some into the hair. I like purple and green combo's, also black and white, chart and red. Bill"
