To folks in the Maritimes (New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, PEI), Trawna is located in Upper Canada. Or as they lovingly refer to it- UFC. That would be Upper F^#*ing Canada. The centre of Canada is just East of Winnipeg. We in Manitoba would happily accept NW Ontario (anything west of Thunder Fuddling Bay) into Manitoba. One fishing licence only. Which would make sense as everyone in Kenora, Red Lake Dryden comes to Winnipeg for Doctor appointments and Costco Shopping. And buys their trucks in Steinbach."

How about a wall around NW Ontario with two gates......one near the US border (for fishermen only) and one near the Manitoba border (so we can access what you describe, plus Mennonite chickens and pork sausage)?

If you cross the border at Baudette / Rainy River, you are somehow suddenly in Northwest Ontario, even though it is something like 1200 miles to the north tip of the province. Toronto is considered Central Canada, even though the longitudinal center is 1400 miles to the West."

Kind of like most of the people south of Route 80 in the States, probably feel they have more in common with the first few states west of the Mississippi river (with a few exceptions of course)."
5338329,kzoofisher,2017-02-16 18:11:00,5144,"I think it is only fair to point out that Nortwestern was founded in 1851 when Illinois was still the north west. Also, what constitutes ""away"" is largely changes in geography, botany and population density. For many Chicagoans southern Michigan is ""up North"". For Michiganders it is usually defined by a look more than by crossing some line on a map. There are those, including at least one poster here, who feel that until you cross the 45th parallel you are not ""North"". For others the line is the Straights of Mackinaw. But for most it is that shift from hardwoods to conifers that comes with harsher winters and less fertile soil. That may be as far south as Newaygo where the soil is so poor that there are cactus or as far north as the beginning of the Laurentian shield. The important thing is not who is right and who is wrong but whether or not we can get some entertainment out of it to ease us into spring."

5339761,adempsey2.0,2017-02-17 14:26:00,612,"Canada is from ""Kanata"", the Huron-Iroquois Indian word which means village or settlement. Eventually Canada was used to describe all French settlements in Canada north of the St. Lawrence River.Upper and Lower Canada came into existence in 1791. The Upper reflects its geographic position being closer to the headwaters of the Saint Lawrence River than that of Lower Canada (or present-day Quebec) to the northeast.Upper Canada basically became Ontario in 1867.Slowly, Ontario expanded westward and northward to become what it is today [Manitoba was not happy!!]. So, you should now be able understand why Northwestern Ontario is called as such.

5337529,MrSimon,2017-02-16 11:08:00,922,I always thought of it like Ontario was simply missing it's SW portion .... meaning everything up above Wisconsin and Minnesota would be considered NW Ontario.

5337001,stumcfar,2017-02-16 08:20:00,451,So a place like Opasquia Provincial Park is considered to be in what part of Ontario? Would that be NW NW Ontario?? This is all so confusing!
5337017,LOW1,2017-02-16 08:24:00,2828,That park is clearly in the SW 1/4 of the NW 1/4 of NW Ontario.

5337081,Kartman35,2017-02-16 08:49:00,245,"Why don't you look at the same map for a minute and consider lattitude. The southern tip of Ontario is at around 42 degrees. The northernmost point is around 57 and Lac Seul is around 49. So maybe not a lot closer but certainly south of the centerpoint. Edit: Above is wrong. My apologies I was looking at Rainy Lake and not Lac Seul here. Lac Seul is actually just north of 50 so slightly more north than the centerline of ontario. I will point out however that Rainy is also in ""Northwest Ontario"" The length of time it takes you to drive from Toronto is not all that relevant when you realize that most of those hours are heading west and not north"
5337089,LOW1,2017-02-16 08:51:00,2828,My understanding is that there is NW Ontario and the GTA. Nothing else matters.

AND if you listen to the weather network, they will often mention that the centre of Canada is the area around Sudbury and North Bay.(but it is neither the latitudinal nor longitudinal centre) AND Lake of the Woods and Lac Seul are both, north and west of either of those locations. I think they called it northwestern Ontario, just to give the politicians and public servants based in Toronto an idea of where to look on a map to find it."
5336530,Kartman35,2017-02-15 23:18:00,245,"I mean if you're fishing Lac Seul for example..you can't be much further south if you're in western Ontario... I know...dumb question...but I get puzzled by things like this. Is there such a place as Southwestern Ontario? Lac Seul is a lot closer to the southern tip of Ontario than it is to the north coast. Does north have a ""cool factor"" that I'm unaware of?"

Now I will be trying to figure out if all of my past trips to Northwestern Ontario were just a big ruse. Was Eagle Lake , LOTW and Lac Seul really just SW Ontario ? Was Red Lake really just Western Ontario ?I feel a migraine starting to take root..... Now I'm questioning whether I should take my trip this year; since I'm not sure where I'll really be in Ontario. What to do, what to do ?I'm starting to think this may be a power play to get more fishermen to come to Quebec for their annual trips PjShorthorn"
5336841,bthomas3333,2017-02-16 07:21:00,465,Ive had this same thought. Being a smart *** response...I would guess if we take Toronto as the center(re) of the province then we can call Kenora Northwest Ontario If you take the Longitude&Latitude max and min of Ontario and find the center it comes out to 6.01 Km NNE of Hornepayne.Oh well...I come for the fishing and people not for the geography.B-

I, too, used to get confused upon hearing description by compass-point, and then just learned to live with it. Just don't look at a map while the area is being described! Bill"
5336953,LOW1,2017-02-16 07:54:00,2828,"You are not being specific enough. LOTW, for example, should be defined as being in SWNW Ontario, the southwest portion of northwest Ontario. There is a good reason why many NW Ontarions would prefer to be part of Manitoba, and for a brief period in time they were. It's a day's drive to the Ontario capital near Toronto, and just three hours or so to Winnipeg.I always have assumed that NW Ontario starts at Thunder Bay."
