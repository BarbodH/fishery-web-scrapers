However, most manufacturers like St. Croix don't have any kind of a selection in 2-piece casting rods in pike weight.Thanks in advance for any advice and suggestions. I'm not looking to buy the most expensive rod out there, but I want to buy one that can last."
5382218,prov1800,2017-03-08 05:52:00,5010,Have spent a number of hrs in the air.mostly daily fly ins and have always put my rods in my rod tube with no problems.if you really want a two piece st croixs premeire serious casting rods has a couple of two piece set ups in a couple of diff rod lenghts.also the premeires wont break the bank either. i personally would rather use a rod tube.can put a number of rods in there and are easy to load into a plane without a problem.
5382394,bthomas3333,2017-03-08 06:50:00,465,I have used the Premier 66 MH spinning rod for pike on fly-ins for about 10 years. It is pretty easy to control pike under 30 inches. Pike upwards of 40 inches get into the backbone but not so much that you feel out of control. I think it is rated up to 1 oz lures so it is good to go with 90% of lures I throw. I recently added the Premier H 2 piece for a fly-in to northern MB. I figure it might be flexible enough to throw some smaller muskie baits as well.BTW....The premier line of rods also has some 2 piece muskie rods if you want to go REALLY heavy in 2 piece rods.In general I am not a huge fan of 2 piece rods but the smaller commercial commuter planes (United Chicago to Winnipeg many flights) are limited to 80in rod cases. Sometimes they will take longer and sometimes they won't. I talked to a supervisor at united about this and I guess the issue is the storage compartment has bins which are 80 inches. So a rod case over 80 is sticking out into the next bin. They felt this was too high of risk of breakage.B-
5382610,KSjim,2017-03-08 08:09:00,88,"I bought a couple Cabela's Salt Striker travel rods for a lake trout trip. They held up great against fish up 30lbs. Three piece rod comes in a case 34.5"""" long. I was able to get two rods in one case. And as a bonus the case fit right in my travel bag!It was really nice not to have to hassle with a rod case through the airports. If I didn't have so much money invested in my walleye rods I would serious consider replacing them with travel rods for the convenience."
5388082,That Minnesota guy,2017-03-10 18:03:00,8293,I'm not a fan of two piece rods so here is what I would do. I would buy a cheap rod that was fairly decent and a tube of Super Glue. Once at the resort I would Super Glue it together and go fishing. When I was packing to leave I would pull the reel off and write a note giving it to the next kid who showed up at the cabin or asking that people use it but also leave it behind for the next group to use if needed. Doesn't answer your question but it does offer a idea for others.
5388114,adempsey2.0,2017-03-10 18:31:00,612,"This one is often recommended for people looking for a first Musky set-up. I don't have one, but I was seriously considering it and their trolling rod.https://tackleindustries.com/shop/mu...9-musky-rod-2/It really depends on what you plan on throwing. Are you looking at bigger baits from 2 to 3oz? or Musky baits that are 6 to 10 oz.? If you're just tossing 1 oz. spoons, you should have no problem finding a 2 pc. casting rod.Otherwise, here's a few you can check out.St. Croix Triumph Travel Rod - TRC66MH4St. Croix Salmon/Steelhead Rods - TRC86MHF2, TRC86HF2St. Croix Mojo Cat Rod - MCC80MF2St. Croix Premier - PC70HF2St. Croix Premier Musky - PM70MHF2, PM90MHF2St. Croix Avid Salmon/Steelhead - AVC86HF2I just picked up a PM70MHF2 myself, but haven't used it yet. I would have rather had a longer rod, but couldn't pass up the deal."
5388162,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2017-03-10 19:05:00,240,"Thanks! I've gotten more good advice than I ever thought I would. I only live a little more than an hour from Park Falls, so I have decided that I am going to get a 6 1/2 ft. and 7 foot St. Croix Premier from St. Croix Rods in Park Falls. My current rod arsenal is almost 100% Cabela's XML rod series, (I lament the fact they don't make these anymore) but I'm looking to upgrade a bit and get a few of both the Premier rods for Pike, and the Eyecon line for walleyes. Don't feel the need to drop $400+ for St. Croix's high end stuff, but the more I look, the more impressed I get.Thanks for taking the time to lay out such great advice/recommendations. I really appreciate it."
5388178,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2017-03-10 19:12:00,240,"That's a great thought! Over the years I have left behind sleeping bags, jig boxes, and other stuff for people flying in who left something in the truck, or just plain overlooked it when packing. Since I do a second fly in with the same outfitter later in the summer, I just ask they leave whatever they borrowed with the outfitter. Never been burned. Fishermen are, as a rule, extremely honest people. Having just had my wallet emptied at work by some jerk, (it was in my jacket in my office) I appreciate this more and more."
