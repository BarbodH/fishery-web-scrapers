553969,Guest,2006-01-22 16:35:00,0,"I fished Lac Simard for 22 years in a row and stayed at three different camps. Now I cannot find any information on any fishing camps that might still be operating on that lake. The Ottawa feeds into it and the nearest towns are Mofett, Belletare and Latulipe. Has anyone any info."
553971,retire55,2006-01-22 18:59:00,1029,"Lacy: Web reference for the Quebec outfitters association is http://www.qof.ca/en/ Once there, use the Finding an Outfitter tool. Lac Simard is in the Abitibi-Temiscamingue region. I did the search on Abitibi-Temiscamingue region and came up with over 30 outfitters. You just have to go through them to find which outfitter might be on Lac Simard. First one I found on Lac Simard was Domaine Driftwood - see http://www.driftwood.qc.ca/english.htm"
553989,Guest,2006-01-23 20:26:00,0,"Thanks for the info, seems Domaine Driftwood is the only camp there. I have stayed there three times bear hunting and fishing but under a different owner."

1260768,ohiojmj,2011-01-10 18:49:00,1262,"I've fished Lac Remigny for several years when staying at Camps Ronoda. I ventured into Lac Des Quinze, but never got close to Simard. What is the fishing like in the river that feeds into Simard toward the north? Can anyone compare Remigny (natural lake, deep troughs, big weedy bays, plenty of pike, some decent walleye) to Des Quinze (some pike and walleye success during limited ventures, dam'ed up, somewhat muddy), and then Simard? Sure is a beautiful region."
1479119,Guest,2012-08-24 21:05:00,0,Both Grassy Narrows and Driftwood are still in operation. Driftwood has some very new and luxurious cabins. Fishing on the river is good for Pike. 44 inch pike pulled out of the rapids this year. Down by the mouth can catch some nice walleye to 22-24 inches
1546251,Guest,2013-03-03 20:39:00,0,"I have fished Driftwood most of my life. Back when Pierre owned, then Cy, then Ben, and so on. We have had some of the best fishing across the lake in a little cove. Monster Pike and nice walleye. We I was really young we used to stay at Mama & Papa Roy's. There is a channel towards the right of that lake, (river McFadden) that holds some large walleyes, We pulled 12 that went 4 lbs plus...."
