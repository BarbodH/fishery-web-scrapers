532809,Guest,2003-06-24 16:45:00,0,I need to talk to a human being about crossing the border with a misdomeaner drug offense. It was a giant mistake in his life so there is no need for anybody to tell him how bad a guy he is. All he can get is recordings or answers to questions that do not apply. It's unbelievalbe. Even when he asked the US border people for the number of their counter parts across the line they give him the number for the Buffalo crossing and it's a recording. He loves Canada - and wants to fish or hunt bear and does not want the trip ruined at the border when they won't let him in because he was convicted of class 1 misdomeaner. I understand they are toying with the idea of de-criminalizing pot in Canada - I can't believe they would not let him in because he was caught with a small amount of pot a couple of years ago. Can anyone give us advice or a telephone number where he can talk to a human being.
