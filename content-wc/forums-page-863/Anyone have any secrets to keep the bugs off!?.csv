532830,Big Tim,2003-06-25 06:12:00,63,"I've used B-1 for 3 years & can assure you IT DOES WORK. 200 mg. once a day , start 10 days in advace & keep it up as long as you like. I use it all summer & have VERY few bites. As with any drug you put in your body, it will effect eace person differently. Check with your physician first, but for 4 or 5 bucks why not try it? I've got a bottle of 100% deet in my tackle box that I've never used, just loan it out to guys who don't believe."
532705,Guest,2003-06-23 11:27:00,0,I'll be fishing Thursday evening. Looks like the weather is going to cooperate for us.
532710,Guest,2003-06-23 12:09:00,0,Thanks for the sugestions. I'll try the Ultra-thon and maybe get wacky and put some Bounce in my hat!! Leaving for Suel in two days. Dreaming of big 'eyes!! JGFish
532715,Ivy,2003-06-23 12:40:00,556,"Trailerguy, Did you get my deposit? We booked the 3rd week in December right? 18 lb Walleye are typical right? Can't wait. Ivy"
532716,ackermannsacre,2003-06-23 14:04:00,196,"Taking the wife up for her first trip this year and she is highly sensitive to insect bites! We are taking Musk Oil, UltraThon, DeepWoods Off, 100% Deet and full bug suits, hat, coat, pants and gloves, plenty of Benadryl gel and pills! Hopefully we will still be able to cast with all this crap on."
532744,Guest,2003-06-23 21:50:00,0,"My Pappy used to swear by this. He'd always say, son go urinate on your hands and then rub them on your hair and behind your ears and under your chin real good. Pappy was right. It was the only method then and it's the only method now."
532745,Guest,2003-06-23 21:54:00,0,I think I'd rather be bitten by blackflies! IPS
532776,Guest,2003-06-24 10:51:00,0,Will someone elses pee work?
532788,cast_and_blast,2003-06-24 13:01:00,1098,"I think ""Pappy"" is having a good laugh at your expense..."
532791,Thumper,2003-06-24 13:30:00,133,"Billy, Be careful when peeing on your hands... you'd hate to get any splashback on your jeans. I mean, that'd STINK! ;) LMAO - Rick"
532812,Trailerguy,2003-06-24 17:18:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Those 18 lbs. are just this years fry, wait'til you see their momma!"
532689,Guest,2003-06-23 09:54:00,0,"I go to Canada every year, and every year I get bit up something fierce!! I try the DEET sprays, etc., but it seems the bugs like me more than anyone else!! Anybody have any tricks??? Thanks! JG"
532690,Guest,2003-06-23 09:57:00,0,Ultra-thon by 3M.
532695,Guest,2003-06-23 10:25:00,0,"Thanks, for the info. Never heard of Ultra-Thon. Where can I get it? Thanks, JGFish"
532696,Guest,2003-06-23 10:34:00,0,"I picked it up from my local wallmart store. Around here (Indiana) you can buy it at Meijer, Wallgreens and some specialty outdoor stores to. Stuff works great on the black flies. It's a little pricey $6 a spray can but it does work."
532697,retire55,2003-06-23 10:47:00,1029,"Although not all members of our group are convinced, at least half of us put a sheet of bounce fabric softener in the top of our hats. Mind you we still use some Deet product as well as netting (head net or coat net) if the black flies are really bad."
532698,Guest,2003-06-23 10:48:00,0,I heard that taking a B1 supplement will cause them to leave you alone. Has anyone else heard this? IPS
532699,Trailerguy,2003-06-23 10:52:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]If you beleive B1 works, I've got a private lake I'll sell you, It's in the middle of the Sahra Desert........."
532700,Guest,2003-06-23 10:57:00,0,"Yeah, I didn't say I believed it but thought I'd ask anyway. Maybe if I just eat a lot of beans I can blow them out of the boat! Assuming I can take beans accross the border! IPS"
532701,Guest,2003-06-23 10:57:00,0,I've tried the B-1 thing and can assure you it doesn't work.
532703,Guest,2003-06-23 11:06:00,0,"Thanks Aaron-IN, I'll try the 3M stuff you suggested. You head up in three days right? I can't wait 'til Saturday! Hopefully we can meet up and swap fish stories. IPS"
