It is alittle tricky to get up there, a good map is a must.I also recomend marking waypoints on your GPS for an easier track back. Also have to look out for floating timber depending on the wind direction. We heard something about a bridge that was put in that goes over a narrow chute area. Not sure if it is true or not. Sen is a great lake. Seems to be where we catch the majority of our big fish (28-31"" walleyes). There is a reef out in the middle that usually produces. Nice area for shore lunch too. Good Luck Brainerd Area Fisherman"

Been going to Chamberlain narrows for 8 years now and have never fished it before, nor heard of it. If you could give me a general direction I'd sure appreciate it!"

It is probably half way between CN and Deception Landing on the east side. Never been there, but have heard great reports. eye_snatcher"
