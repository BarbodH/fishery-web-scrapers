532732,fishmaster,2003-06-23 18:40:00,209,Was up to Vermilion Bay Lodge in May fishing wa great. If you have not been there before sure you will enjoy your stay been going there the last 6 years for opening week. I am sure Gord will point you in the right direction if your lucky maybe he will buy you a beer.
