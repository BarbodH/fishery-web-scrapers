532722,fishmaster,2003-06-23 15:54:00,209,Was up for the openner in May water level was low so watch out for rocks. Fishing was great. Where you headed? We fished out of Vermilion Bay.

I'm curious if the low water will change location of the fish this time of year. But then again, Eagle always has one guessing. Some years we catch them in 6 feet of water and the next day we nail them in 25'. Can't wait!"
532800,Guest,2003-06-24 14:56:00,0,"Was on Eagle Lake the last week in May. Water level was 3 to 4 feet low and fishing was slow. Most Eyes caught in the 5th and Broadway area on rock reefs. Fish about 15 to 20 down. Surface Temp was 69 degrees. We fished out of Vemillion Bay Lodge, Good Luck and say hi to Gord. Oh one more thing Lindy Rig Plain hook Pink."
532804,fishmaster,2003-06-24 15:56:00,209,Craig You must have been in camp the same time I was. Was up for opening week. Fishing was good for us we did well on walleye bigger northerns this year and no time at all to limit out on perch. Kurt
532806,Guest,2003-06-24 16:10:00,0,"Fishing was the worst we had in 10 years.... I'm guessing it was due to a bad year class or 2 of walleyes.... Need to offer objective view, sorry for the poor update but I was disappointed this year. FYI - No potatos to Canada this year... Fungas???? Keep fishing and be happy....."
532807,fishmaster,2003-06-24 16:18:00,209,"T-Mac Where on Eagle were you fishing? I thought that fishing has improved each year, I think the slot size thing that they have going is working well."
532808,lt,2003-06-24 16:31:00,13,"We fish Eagle Lake every year in July...last year third week, did extremely well on big fish...largest 7.9 lbs...I would love to get into on of those ""famous"" 10 pounders...I know they are there I've seen them but not caught one. We will be up there the week of July 5th through the 11th. If the water is still low it will be interesting getting to the falls area, but I do look forward to good fishing. We'll be buying our potatoes on the Canadian side rather than chance a delay because of a potatoe. Anyone else going to be there that week?"
532838,Guest,2003-06-25 08:18:00,0,"We fished the NE end. The fishing had been getting better every year and we are firm believers in the slots - they are working. We just didn't get the production we historically have and everyone else we talked with agreed. Not sure why and I'm not saying the lake is dead, just that this year was our worst in 7-8 years. Good luck to all."
