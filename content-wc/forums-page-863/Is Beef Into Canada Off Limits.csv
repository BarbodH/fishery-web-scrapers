But, I just spoke with a person who returned from Canada last wk. and I asked how the border crossing went. He said that they were asked whether they had any beef products with them on the way into Canada. This happened at the 1000 Island's crossing. He said ""no"" only to remember later that he did have some beef BBQ with him but they sent him through without checking. My experience is that when customs' officials ask you a question (e.g. alcohol, tobacco, firearms, live bait, pepper spray, etc.) that the ""best"" answer is NO! When they are asking it is because it is either not allowed or restricted. This person surmised that the inquiry about beef is in retaliation for the US ban on Canadian beef following the Mad Cow incident. By the way, he wasn't asked about potatoes and saw no signs forbidding them. Has anyone else heard anything about a beef not being allowed into Canada? How is a person to know about these things other than word-of-mouth. I don't mind losing 5 lbs. of potatoes at the border, but I would hate like #### to lose several steaks and a beef roast. Bulldog"
532656,Guest,2003-06-22 12:24:00,0,Being asked about beef = Canada is retaliating for US beef ban? Hummm. The best thing to do is check with Canada customs. For more about crossing the border in Canada see http://www.ccra-adrc.gc.ca/customs/i...isitors-e.html
532740,Pooch,2003-06-23 21:15:00,4619,Buddy just returned and said that the only place Beef came up was returning into the states at the border crossing. No beef can go south is the word he got at the border. Which makes good sense to me. Pooch
532742,Guest,2003-06-23 21:22:00,0,"Went through the Candaian side on the 13th and no questions about beef or potatoes. No questions about beef on the way home on the 20th either, just the same old queations, guns, beer and tobacco. International Falls crossing coming and going."
532767,Guest,2003-06-24 08:53:00,0,Just a suggestion. But I think the best answer would probably be the one that is the truth.
