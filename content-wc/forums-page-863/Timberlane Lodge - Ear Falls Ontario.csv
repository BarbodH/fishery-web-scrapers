532636,Hoosier Swede,2003-06-21 08:36:00,3,I am thinking about staying at Timberlane Lodge on Lac Seul next week. I am curious if anyone has any past experience at this lodge. Thanks! The Hoosier Swede

532645,Guest,2003-06-22 00:42:00,0,we stayed there for about 15 years while glenn and delores had it. prices wee good. stayed in about every cabin they had. Then the people from Kansas bought it. We got their brochure saying they did not raise any prices and in fact had lowered them! Well we had the old price list and they raised every price on their. I know you cant buy something like that and pay the interest and principle and not raise prices. they should not have lied. It might have new owners now though. Ask where they are from. They were from the same town in kansas that the owners of lac saul lodge were from i think. I know when looking through the brochures from the all canada show they both had the same home towns in Kansas. After that we stayed at the golden fawn lodge just accross the water. They are probably very close in price and amenities. Glenn told me that they all get together and agree on what the prices should be. they dont compete or none of them would make any money.
