532841,Ia Walihntr,2003-06-25 08:40:00,320,Musky3 Are you staying at a resort (Spruce Island Camp) just off Tug Channel or are you staying in one of the three or four private homes actually on Tug Channel? Not trying to pry but just interested to know if you stay at the same place our group does. FYI---We've been parking at Gills Marina for the last 16 years. We've never had a problem. Spruce Island puts a charge right on your final bill for parking and that money is forwarded to Gills. The also charge for the boat ramp at Gill's and put it on your bill.
