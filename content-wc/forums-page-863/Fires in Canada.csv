532752,Guest,2003-06-24 06:33:00,0,"Leave your camp fire wood at home: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Fire ban in effect June 23, 2003 Staff The Ministry of Natural Resources declared the entire West Fire Region a restricted fire zone on Saturday. The fire hazard is high to extreme in all fire districts as a mix of dry conditions and lightning strikes have made for a volatile ####tail, keeping firefighters busy all weekend. There currently are six fires burning in the Fort Frances District, six in Dryden, one in Kenora, eight in Nipigon, 10 in Red Lake, 20 in Sioux Lookout, and five in Thunder Bay. This brings the total to 393 fires since the fire season began April 1. These blazes have consumed 7,783.90 ha. A restricted fire zone does not restrict movement or recreational activity in the forest, but it does restrict the use of fire. After an RFZ has been declared, it is illegal to set a fire for any purpose within the affected area. Failure to comply could result in a fine up to $1,000, three months in jail, and financial responsibility for any costs incurred in fighting a forest fire caused by the illegal act. The RFZ order is used only when conditions are so dry that an open fire of any kindno matter how well tendedwould represent a threat to the surrounding area."
