532711,Guest,2003-06-23 12:11:00,0,"I am not sure where we are going....all I know is where we are starting, and that is right off of HWY 664 between Sioux Lookout and Hudson. Apparently we are right on big Lake Vermillion and only 4 miles from a Lac Seul launch site. Check out this map, we are probably right on the ""664"" mark, just West/Southwest of Sioux Lookout, more than likely near Ojibway.http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/tra...eets/map13.pdf I have a party of four going, and none of us have fished that area, so I am going to be going off of ""local knowledge"" and other info. I find on this board. We'll be in 14 and 16 foot boats, with 25hp and 35hp motors....we'll be the slow guys on the lake (ha ha), probably with a beer cooler bigger than a bouy....."
532717,Guest,2003-06-23 14:44:00,0,"PS, we will be up there beginning the 28th, leaving for home early on the 3rd. Also, I see that you are inquiring about a fire up in that neck of the woods....I sure hope there isn't one. I haven't heard anything about a fire, but if I do, I will post it here... Later!"
532758,Guest,2003-06-24 07:20:00,0,"Wooglin, Do you know if your staying at Big Vermillion Lodge or Deer Path Lodge I will be up there the same time you are and have fished the both lakes for about 12 years. If your staying at Deer Path look me up i'll be the one with a blue Ranger 621 250 HP Racing Merc. The fishing should be amazing it usally is when the mayflies hatch, I hope i'm not to late. Mike Cerett"
532759,Guest,2003-06-24 07:42:00,0,"We are camping at a place called Country Camping, off of HWY 664 between Hudson and Sioux Lookout. It is on Big Lake Vermillion, and only 4 miles away from Lac Seul. I will keep an eye out for your boat...keep an eye out for us and make sure you don't run us over! We will be in 14 footers with 25 hp motors...it should be pretty comical!"
532458,Guest,2003-06-17 16:14:00,0,The hot jig color was pink with a minnow . We also had good action on char/white/pink/orange twister tails. We fished only structure that the wind was blowing into and we caught fish in depths ranging from 4' to 16' with the best luck in 8 to 10'. When trolling rapalas all colors worked well and flats with 10' of water produced the best. we fished structure close to deep water and it consistently was good.
532461,Jigger1,2003-06-17 16:50:00,234,"IA Walleye - I figured that was your post on the other site and I'll make sure to tell Mike hi. The fact that your son caught the biggest and a Master Angler walleye at that is AWESOME! When I took my daughter in 2000, she was a ¼ shy of a Master Angler, but that trip has forever solidified our relationship and we're now the best of fishing buddies. I can't wait to see what Lac Seul looks like and specifically some of the spots-on-the-spots as you mentioned. My anticipation of the trip is at an all time high! I like the ride going up an around Stizo anyway so not going through the Sticks isn't any big deal except for a time saver (he upgraded from 80 to 100's huh  too cool?). We'll be up there on the 28th for 4.5 days, I'll let you know how our group of eight does when we get back. I was surprised to see the crankbait comments. I've only pulled out a crankbait one time in four years and we put them back within 45 minutes. Jigging has been number one for me and we did to quite a bit of bouncing last year. As I was ill prepared for bouncing with an old spinning rod combo, I took advantage of the situation and bought myself a new baitcasting bottom bouncing rig for this year can't wait to break that puppy in! Thanks for the info  my son's turn is next year and I can't wait for him to go! Jigger1"
532479,Guest,2003-06-18 07:21:00,0,"####o everyone! My group of 4 will be camping at Country Camping (www.countrycamping.net) near Sioux Lookout. We have never been up this way before, however, it appears by what I have been reading, Lac Seul is really producing the fish this year. I understand that we'll need lots and lots of live bait (minnows and crawlers). Do you suggest trying to bring it, or picking it up in Canada on the way through? Please drop some tips, what to bring (crankbaits, spoons, jigs, plastic worms...etc.). We'd like to eat Walleye every day, and play with the pike/bass for fun. Thanks! >Hey just wondering what to bring for bait>>??????? what color >jigs n spinners should we get extras of. N what are the fish >hitting we are leaving a week from today Want to know asap. >Wanna know if we should buy 20 doz clawers for the 4 of us? >"
532480,Guest,2003-06-18 07:28:00,0,There are three great fishing reports that pretty much cover most of Lac Seul at http://www.justfishontario.com/reports.htm Everyone of them gives a great report. I watch them to see what is working and what isn't.
532573,Guest,2003-06-19 18:13:00,0,"Just want to tell you not to ignore the cranks completely. I just made my first trip to Lac Seul with my son who loves to use them. I was kidding him about the Rapala tail dancer and how Normark probably was going to discontinue it, if they haven't already! He proceeded to put one on, a two tone green #7 and began to kill the fish with that lure. I'm talking walleye, northern and smallies. His best fish was a 42"" 22 pound northern caught in the Shanty Narrows area. We took pics and released the beautiful fish. When we first arrived at camp one of the other guys asked if this was our first trip to Lac Seul. When we told him it was, he said ""you'll be back"". He was right about that."

532588,LUCKWI,2003-06-20 06:25:00,13,Just returned yesterday from lac seul. Fished the vaughn lake and surrounding area.The bite was fantastic. We found fish in everywhere from 4 ft to 20 feet.we used some live bait(nightcrawlers) but the main bait was rubber tails in white or chartreuse. The weather was great warm and sunny.Huge mayfly hatch on Vaughan lake which made the bear watching fun. three of us managed to catch 238 walleyes in 5 days..Enjoy the bite ROY
532589,Guest,2003-06-20 06:46:00,0,"I keep reading about guys fishing Lac Seul and useing twister tails. My experience on lac Seul (14 trips) has shown me that nothing outfishs minnows. Our trip this year for 6 days with 7 guys yielded 1,080 Walleye and while we caught some on twisters minnows will catch 2 to 1. Twisters are good but minnows are better.....CATCH & RELEASE"
532683,Guest,2003-06-23 08:29:00,0,"Tick, tick, tick, tick.... 4 days and counting. Leaving for Lac Seul (Sioux Lookout area) Friday afternoon, can't wait! I read that the Mayflys are bad up there, what do you suggest for clothing on the lake? It appears as though it is supposed rain the majority of the time we are there, so I am sure we'll be in our rain gear. But other than that, do you suggest wearing those long sleeve/pant combo's (where your pants can unzip at the knees into shorts) so the flys stay off of you? Or do you go to the extreme and wear a netting suit?"

532319,Guest,2003-06-13 21:34:00,0,What depth n what kinda structure
532327,Guest,2003-06-14 08:33:00,0,"Just got back from Lac Seul and it was terrific fishing. The water level is way down, but it did not hurt the fishing, just had to fish new spots near the old favorites. We did best with spinners on bottom bouncers. Hammered gold, hammered silver, fire tiger with silver and red/silver, were the best we experienced. 3/8 oz was the bottom bouncers that did best and we pulled them through 7 - 12 feet of water for the most consistent bite. Did well with crankbaits as well, with my 11-year old son getting a 30 1/4"" walleye on a chautruse Wiggle Wart. Hot-n-tot's, Shad Raps, and Husky Jerks did well, along with silver Rattle Traps. The bass are just starting to bed so pitch very close to shore. Our biggest smallie (19"") came from about 1 foot of water right next to shore. The walleyes are still working the sand/rubble beaches on the windy side, but it will not be long before they are in major transition mode to the summer haunts as the water is warm. Watch for rocks as the level is down about 7 feet which means rocks you went over last year and never knew were there are not either out of the water or just under the surface waiting for your prop. Have a great trip! IA Walleye"
532359,Jigger1,2003-06-15 19:24:00,234,IA Walleye - How did Lac Seul look with the water levels so low? We're at SWWL (our 4th year) in 13 days and can't wait to see what it looks like. From Mike's fishing reports it sounds like things are fast and furious and it's always great to hear a young anglers success! Counting down the days! Jigger1
532365,Guest,2003-06-15 21:53:00,0,Im heading to ear falls area if that helps neone?
532379,Guest,2003-06-16 09:38:00,0,"We fished out of Golden Eagle Camp which is located in the NW section of the lake. We started fishing on Sat. afternoon (6-7) and headed home on 6-14. There were 6 of us and we went through 500 nightcrawlers, bought at Cabelas on the way up, 30 dozen minnows, and a couple pounds of leeches. We caught approx. 600 walleyes as a group. Nothing over 5.5 pounds but to many in the slot to count. Fished bottom bouncer on large flat outside of the sancuary. 10 feet of water. Got tired of pulling bouncer so started jigging with 1/4 jig and minnow with ultralight. What a ball. We had a great time. Both ways at the border with no problems. The people of Canada were very friendly including the boat police that checked us on Tuesday. Have a great trip and good luck"
532393,Guest,2003-06-16 15:49:00,0,"We fished for six days last week out of Lac seul lodge. It is the 12th year that we have been there and it was our best by far. Seven of us caught and released over 1000 Walleye and we had many ,many fish in the seven pound plus range. Six of the guys on the trip caught their biggest walleye ever. I would guess that 80% of the fish were slot and above with half of those over 25"". Jig and minnow worked best on windy days and trolling Rapalas on flats during calm days produced most of the big fish. The management of the fishery should be commended for an outstanding job. lac Seul is truly a lake that the slot has made better. Cant wait until next year. Thanks to Dan at Lac Seul Lodge for a first class trip."
532402,Guest,2003-06-16 19:10:00,0,"Absolutely love Lac Suel. Not just the Walleyes but big northern. To answer your question 20 dozen crawlers are not enough. The first trip I took with my son and daughter we brought no bait and ended up spending almost $200 on minnows. I don't remember the exact cost but it was not unusual for us to go through 6 dozen or more minnows per day. About mid-week I asked the bait place for their dead minnows which they gave (when I also bought live minnows) me so it helped. Bottom line is when your live bait fishing and catching 100 plus walleyes per day the crawlers, leeches and minnows go pretty quick. Have fun"
532408,Guest,2003-06-16 21:25:00,0,"Jigger 1 - We were at SWWL from June 4 - 12 and wow what a difference a year makes. Last year we were there when they got 10"" of water in 2 - 3 days and the roads were washed out. This year they are down about 7 feet. You will not believe the sight at the dock. That is the bad news, the goods news is the fishing is just as good as last year, maybe even better. In five years this was our best year for bass, we took a full morning and did real well highlighted by a 19"", a 17.5"", and a 17"". One day we stopped counting walleyes at a very high number, a number that would seem impossible, but I was there and I was counting, so I know what we did. I did not break my goal of 30"" but my 11-year old son did, and I would have traded any fish I have ever caught or will every catch for that moment. What you will find really intersting is you can see the structure you were fishing in previous years and it gives you a great understanding why some ""spots-on-the-spot"" are better than others. Still could not get through the Sticks, so that added some travel time, but no complaints, the Yamaha 100's made short work of it. Tell Mike hi from the Marty Boys. Good luck on your trip."
532438,Guest,2003-06-17 12:09:00,0,"Mike Kansas, Sounds like you guys had a great trip. Could you be a little more specific on the type of structure and depth of water you fished. What part of the lake did you fish? We are going in two weeks and hope to do just 1/2 as well as your group. Thanks, Gary T."
