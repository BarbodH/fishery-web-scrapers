532768,Guest,2003-06-24 08:59:00,0,We are staying at the outpost cabin of the Manitou Falls Resort. It is on Goose lake. Where are you staying? How did you do last year?
532771,Guest,2003-06-24 10:14:00,0,"####o, Yea everyone is ok, we stayed there alot and the owners are friends of ours so it is kinda hard to take, we caught lots of fish up there. Don't know exacally how it happened, in a cabin behind the lodge and then the generator house and from then on no stopping it. all the cabins, I guess they saved some of the boats and the bobcat. other than that it is a total loss, he was doing alot of rebuilding and adding on and really trying to fix the place up, he wanted to keep it a rustic fish camp and only a camp not a fancy resort. I talked to his wife and they are still kinda in shock, don't know what they are going to do now. Keep me posted on your fishing, and I will do the same. E-mail me at[email protected]"
532793,FishTwentyFourSeven,2003-06-24 13:42:00,38,"It a shame to hear that someone lost their camp. I have dreamed about owning a camp in Ontario and couldn't imagine that happening. Pikelady, I see from previous posts that you like Separation Lake. We did not venture up there last year because of the success we were having by our camp. I will let you know how we do when I get back next month. When are you going up? Mike, We stay at Lount Lake Lodge. Last year was our first year and I go with my Father, my friend and his Father. This year there is seven of us. We did good last year. I am not sure how far away your camp is from ours but if it is within a boat ride away I can give you some spots."
532796,Guest,2003-06-24 14:14:00,0,"We are not going to Separation this year, we were at Minaki, for a few days chasing smallmouth and then blew a power pac so we came home, we are headed to Caviar Lake on Saturday chasing smallmouth again and I guess they have some big muskies also. Good luck and let me know how you did when you get back.[email protected]"
532797,Guest,2003-06-24 14:32:00,0,"Fish 24, I think we are a ways away. I looked at the web sight of your lodge, and it looks like you are just north of Kenora. We go in at Ear Falls and have about an 11 mile boat ride. I think the furthest we can go is Unexpected Lake. Thanks for the offer though. Keep us posted on how you do this year."
532805,Guest,2003-06-24 15:58:00,0,"When you go thru unexpected, fish the East side in all the weed beds with white buzz baits, we pulled out alot of big northerns, they would follow up and hit right at the boat, really had fun. When you go in at English River at the dam and go down stream and thru the rapids check out Naughty Pines, it should be a real shocker with everything gone.as you follow the river past Naughty Pines and just as you turn left to go down stream there is a island, it is the place alot of Musky fisherman fish. and alot of Muskies have been caught there. pikelady"
532649,Guest,2003-06-22 08:42:00,0,"Just wondering if anyone has been having any success with the big fish. If so, where are you seeing them? Are they still in the spawning bays up there, or are the rock reefs, points, and saddles starting to hold fish? We are heading up next weekend and I would really appreciate any insight. Thanks. Matt"
532660,Guest,2003-06-22 19:52:00,0,"We just got back from Lac Seul. My cousin had 2 Muskies hit a walleye as he was reeling them in. Both were in about 5-10' of water. Both let go of the 'eye but did put up a fight for a short time. Thats about all the info I can give. I was up at Wabigoon 3 weeks ago and fished almost exclusively for Pike but did not get/see a Muskie. I fished for the Pike in shallow bays (less than 8', mostly in 3-6')."

532709,whitetip1,2003-06-23 11:56:00,53,"Matt, Where are you going??"
532713,Guest,2003-06-23 12:29:00,0,We are going to the English RIver just west of Ear Falls.
532737,Guest,2003-06-23 20:37:00,0,Where are you going on the English River?? pikelady
532762,Guest,2003-06-24 08:03:00,0,"Pike Lady, I am the one who corresponded (bothered) you this winter about the English River. We are staying down the river a ways from the resort that you sent me the map from. Have you been up there yet this year? Thanks, Matt I'll make sure to let you know how the spots you marked pan out. Thanks again."
532764,Guest,2003-06-24 08:37:00,0,"Hey, Have fun, I thought I would let you know Naughty Pines burned to the ground last week-end, that is why I asked. I guess it was awfull. So I am really glad I sent you the maps, hang on to them, they will become a collectors item, (haha) Good Luck and let me know how you did. We are going to Caviar Lake this week-end for a week, smallmouth fishing, hope we do good. pikelady"
532765,Guest,2003-06-24 08:46:00,0,Wow! Thats a shocker. I hope everone is alright. I will keep you updated on our adventure. Good luck on your trip as well.
532766,FishTwentyFourSeven,2003-06-24 08:52:00,38,"I stayed on the English River last year and had a blast. I am staying there again this year. What lodge are you staying at Matt? Pikelady, how did that accident happen at Naught Pines? That is a shame. That looked like a beautiful cabin. Talk to you two soon. Jerry"
