This has a major effect on the walleye movements into the Red River. Wind pushing from the North to the South pushs water across the Lake and piles it up in the lower Red up against the St. Andrews Dam. This has a tidal like effect that can cause the river to raise 4' or more in a very short time. If the wind is from the South, the reverse is true. The wind may push Lake Shiners and other key forage up into the river. Where there is lots of food in the fall, you got lots of walleye. Several days of strong Northerly winds during the key fall period will likely bring on the best bite. If the moon is doing it's thing too, all the better. Hope this helps.
