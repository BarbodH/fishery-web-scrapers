Plenty of trophy sized pike, and once we figured out the program trophy lakers as well. Walleye were as easy and abundant as I've ever seen. There is arctic grayling in the current areas, but we didn't fish for them.The camp was great, the boats were great, the food was great - no complaints on that front at all. Although what's described as a 5 star outpost is most definitely not. It has lots of amenities and is quite comfortable for being so far north, but it's NOT 5 star!What made the trip extra special was this was my first official ""hosted"" trip. The idea being to educate everyone who joined us on precisely how to target the trophy fish we were seeking, explaining patterns and tactics in detail to help everyone catch fish and have a good time.Overall it was a huge success with a whole lot of added camaraderie, so much so that we're doing it again this summer. If anyone would like to join us for the fishing trip of a lifetime and maybe learn a little in the process, drop me a line. Regarding Bain itself, it's a very large body of water connected by two long neck downs to Belsham lake. The North Seal river flows through the lakes and it can only be described as a flowage, as mild current exists in every pinch point. Fish are everywhere...Brendan and I failed to cover all of the available water during our two weeks there last year - and believe me I tried! It's just a breathtaking body of water to explore and fish. I did learn a lot last year, so it goes without saying that anyone who joins us this summer will reap the benefits in a very big way.In the meantime I put together this overview video of last years trip, it's over an hour in length so kind of long, but it really shows you what to expect on a trip up there.https://youtu.be/vU2qMisi5VcCheers,Mike"

As you noted you were out-fished again by Brendan but like most dads that is how you want it !!.. Being from Wisc. I really enjoyed your modified Wolf River rig set-up for laker""s.. Thanks for sharing"
