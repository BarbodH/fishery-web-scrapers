The only outcome from this post will be to make me look like a jerk and a tightwad (and I freely admit that I am at least one of those), but I’m sure I’m not the only person that shares this opinion, and since I’m bored and sitting at my computer, here goes nuttin.To quickly summarize some recent posts, the overwhelming opinion being mentioned is that if the border remains closed, we should gallantly expect that the lodges keep our deposits and if not, we should call our lodge owners and tell them to keep our money. Joeflip is the only person to take a different view suggesting that if that were to occur, that may cause the cancellation of future trips. Then Ted, the owner of Hawk Lake Lodge responds that numerous organizations are telling lodge owners that they should keep their client’s deposits, and adds “Honestly, I love all my guests. But if giving them their money back means my kids don't eat or worse I declare bankruptcy sorry. I choose to be solvent. Sorry you lost your deposit. But if you truly liked your lodge you want them to survive this crisis. Many organizations or industry groups are recommending to their lodges to not refund deposits for the sole reason that they want the industry to survive.”If that scenario plays out, and my lodge tells me “sorry you lost your deposit”, it will be the last deposit they get from me (this is the part where I look like a jerk and a tightwad). That’s just a fact, and it’s the way I feel. I get it, lodges operate on a shoestring budget with razor thin margins and loss of revenue such as we may be facing will likely result in many lodges going under. But you know what, this event is causing an enormous economic impact to everyone, not just lodge owners. I’ve lost enough money in the past four weeks that I could have bought my own lodge (you may think I’m exaggerating, but sadly I’m not). On a meeting with my boss yesterday, he eluded to the fact that unless things change soon he would expect to start hearing about layoffs, and if that occurs I would expect mine to be one of the first heads on the chopping block. Cry me a river, right? I’m not looking for sympathy, but to twist Ted’s words “Honestly, I love my lodge, but if them keeping my $800 deposit means my kids don’t eat or worse I declare bankruptcy, sorry, I choose to be solvent. Sorry I didn't rebook with you, but if you truly liked your customers and want them to return, you want them to survive this crisis”. It works both ways.I see on my lodge’s website, it states “no refunds or transfers”, so it may just come to that and if it does I’ll book somewhere else in 2021. This year will be my eighth in a row (hopefully) bringing my family of four, but mine is a very popular lodge so there’s always someone waiting to fill a vacancy. They won’t even know I’m gone."
6412748,That Minnesota guy,2020-03-21 13:48:00,8293,"I don't think you are a jerk or tightwad. Although you might be. I think the lodge owners will have a very tough decision to make on these deposits. I'm not going to say how they should handle their business, each lodge will have it's own limitations. I would only suggest they be proactive. Sit down and start making some phone calls. Let the guys know they can roll their deposit to the next 3 years as to limit the hurt in each year vs a big one time 2021 hit. Explain that only 33% of 2020's deposits can be used each year and each group needs to claim a year on a first come basis. Once a year is full you only have 2 choices left. The other option would be to deny a refund period if thats the camp policy. Neither option guarantees the camps future solvency but one option provides a bit (if only a small bit) of good will IMO. But, again it's not my lodge or my deposit. Each lodge and fisherman needs to handle this on a one on one basis. I'm just glad I don't own a lodge or have a deposit in for 2020 on March 21st, 2020."
6412760,eyecatcher1,2020-03-21 14:07:00,323,"I've been going to the Sioux Lookout area for 28 years now, usually 2 or 3 times a year. I do have a deposit down for two weeks in June 2020. I don't expect my deposit to be returned because they probably used that money to buy groceries since I gave it to them. If this year doesn't happen, I do expect my deposit to be used for the same two weeks in 2021 or another time. I guess I'll just have to wait and see what happens."
6412768,Carnhzkr,2020-03-21 14:21:00,964,"And I would be perfectly fine with that. I won't be looking for a refund, just roll it over to either a September trip or the same week in June next year. I should have mentioned that in my post."
6412772,eyecatcher1,2020-03-21 14:30:00,323,"I know that the resort where I go does this and would think that most of the others do too. I always have the first choice at the same weeks the following year. I usually just roll my deposit over, but do have until the end of the year to get it there. The resorts will be hurting this season if we can't get there and pay the balance of our bill, but that way they would be sure of having our business in 2021 if they just roll the deposits over. I sure hope for all of us that is the way it works."
6412776,v-bay gord,2020-03-21 14:37:00,3168,"From my perspective as someone in the tourism business, everyone has a cancellation policy that guests probably know and understand before they book. So at a minimum, sticking with the policy would seem fair.....in a normal year. Now, maybe there could be some give and take as the situation is so unusual. In my case I need $100 per adult, non refundable, but transferable to another time if notified 60 days in advance. I've already sent out notice to my guests that I'm waiving the 60 day notice because of the unusual circumstances. From a selfish point of view I don't want people cancelling unless there is no choice. I have no problem (other than financial) allowing them to rebook in 2021 and use the deposit then.....I think that is good customer service, but then again, my deposit is only $100. Others who demand more up front would be in a bigger bind, but that's their business model, not mine. I do have guests that pay more up front because they want to. In those cases I would feel obligated to try and refund as much as possible...although another factor is the exchange rate. What they gave me back in October does not translate to what it's worth now (my rates are in Canadian $). In other words it's probably beneficial to them to leave it as a deposit on the books. Anyways sorry for the long-windedness on a positive note I have not had a single cancellation (yet) and have actually had some recent reservations for September. I recognize that I'm probably in a bubble and it may all come crashing down. Till then I remain in 14 days of self isolation from my recent trip to Mexico. If you think tourism will be suffering here, Mexico is worse..."
6412780,That Minnesota guy,2020-03-21 14:44:00,8293,"Gord, I feel sorry for you guys North of the border. Mexico not so much. (before anybody blows up on me it was a joke....sorta )"
6412792,MikeF,2020-03-21 15:18:00,895,"Not being a tightwad at all. The problem is emotions for the owners and I get that. People tend to view the lodges and owners as friends over a period of time. My take is a true friend would not take that ""tough luck"" attitude and make amends come **** or high water. It may take time but that would be expected. Now if I decide as a friend to to forgive the debt, then so be it. The problem is the business model. The deposits should be in escrow ie a trust and not be part of the operating capital until used for depositor expenses 30-60 days out. That is why most cancellation policies have some type of time restriction. Funds to take advantage of pricing deals or weather or logistics for economy of expenses should be from operating capital or secured credit lines. Example would be a contractor taking a deposit for a job. Contractor never shows up and claims hardship and says sorry I spent your money on something or someone else. Now comes the decision on you part. And that is the important part, it should be your decision, not his. I don't know this guy from Adam and want my money back or have known him for 20 yrs and will let it slide because of extenuating circumstances. It should be your decision if and when the States Attorney goes knocking on his door for restitution. Keep in mind there would probably be cancellation or carry over or no refund restrictions which you would of known up front . But the agreement would need to be honored by both parties. I will finish with the thought that if a friend said tough luck and made no offer to make amends some way or another, then they would be removed from the Christmas card list and I would move on."
6412204,northerneyes,2020-03-20 11:08:00,72,"I would like to encourage anyone who has paid a deposit to contact the outfitter and let them know that they can keep the deposits. And I don't mean keeping it to apply to 2021. I am doing so. I think it is important for all of us who enjoy the experience to support the outfitters and maybe this will keep them in business. And just so everyone knows I, like many others, am on a limited budget. But I think if at all possible we should do this."
6412242,joeflip,2020-03-20 12:20:00,75,"Do you mean keeping our deposits and not applying it to future trips, As for some of us this will cause the cancellation of future trips."
6412284,northerneyes,2020-03-20 13:16:00,72,Yes keep this years deposit and do not apply to future trips. And I know this will not be possible for everyone. But I think it is in EVERYONE s best interest if we can do this
6412298,Fisherman Ted,2020-03-20 13:44:00,461,I'm not sure I understand what you mean. Why would a lodge that kept your deposit this year cause you to not be able to go on additional trips in the future? Your deposit is a sunk cost. If you don't go this year you actually have more money as you didn't pay for the rest of your trip.
6412364,joeflip,2020-03-20 16:28:00,75,"Case in point, I have $1200 deposit for trip, national emergency considering, if the outfitter says sorry I can't refund or reschedule in future trip, I would have to strongly consider looking at other places to go, as having to cancel 2 major vacations already and I have had no problems receiving a refund, if that's the policy of the outfitter then so be it, but I have yet to have any issues with refunds at this point or being able to be credited for future trips, with that said I consider it very admirable for those that can afford to surrender their deposits without issue, I know for some $400 is there deposits, some outfitters require 50% and some people are dropping thousands for a family of 4 or 6 in deposits. In the end it's a customers personal decision and a outfitters policy that will determine."
6412380,Fisherman Ted,2020-03-20 16:48:00,461,"Got it. However lodges are not cruises, or airlines or Airbnbs. We are open for like 3 months a year. And that is about to come to a crashing halt. I have been on numerous calls over the past week with industry, provincial and federal government officials. Tourism across the board is getting destroyed. Not 'oh this is a bad year' but 'oh crap, I am going bankrupt'. And the recommendations from many is that if your refund policy says your money is not refundable then by all means do not refund it. Pushing out a deposit to 2021 means you are putting an outfitter in potential dire straits 18 months from now. A rolled over refund for the ENTIRE PORTION of a summer would be financial catastrophe. Think I am chicken little? Its happening. Ice fishing has come to a halt. New spring bear hunt up in smoke. Layoffs are already occurring. New hire contracts are being rescinded. Honestly, I love all my guests. But if giving them their money back means my kids don't eat or worse I declare bankruptcy sorry. I choose to be solvent. Sorry you lost your deposit. But if you truly liked your lodge you want them to survive this crisis. This is the worst thing in multiple generations to happen to our industry. Many organizations or industry groups are recommending to their lodges to not refund deposits for the sole reason that they want the industry to survive. Should this continue for a longer period of time some of these lodges you speak of that upset you for not refunding your deposit will be out of business. Permanently. -FT"
6412414,northerneyes,2020-03-20 17:17:00,72,This is exactly why I think all customers that can afford to should voluntarily forfeit their deposit. That way it may help a bit to keep outfitters in business and keep hard feelings down all around. I have contacted by outfitter already and told them to keep my deposit. Everyone's situation is different.
6412478,fldoc1,2020-03-20 21:23:00,69,The virus is such a crazy situation. It came upon us so fast and who knows how long it will last. My wife and I have been going to the same camp in early June for a number of years now and forfeiting the deposit (even though I paid more than the minimum) seems fair. There will be many people hurting so helping out if you can afford it makes sense. We go out with friends every Friday to the local bars to eat. Great Friday fish fry and good company. Sitting at home eating. I drove by the bars and all is quiet. Randy from Duluth
6412488,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2020-03-20 22:26:00,240,"Well said. Dave and Michelle at Nestor Falls Outposts are like family to me. Over 25 trips with their outfit. If keeping my deposit helps them stay solvent, I am good with that. Hopefully some of us who lose a May or June deposit might be able to go in September."

6412032,prov1800,2020-03-20 06:29:00,5010,"They have slid them on snow before but this definatly works good.its a 40 mi trip.they had 2 to go in.hopefully they will get used.think we all have a ways to go.approx 2 months to opener.still cool weather here and 30"" of ice.that will take a while before it melts also.can only hope for the best"
6412052,Bill Krejca,2020-03-20 07:18:00,6107,"Yeah,could be a tough year for camp owners and potential visitors. Owners have the most to lose, not good for people who work there/support them either. Interesting trailer setup, I have never seen that type of ski contraption. Many folks are not aware of the amount of outpost materials of all types which get hauled in over the snow/ice. An understanding of a wilderness setting is not complete without year around awareness of activities. Bill"
