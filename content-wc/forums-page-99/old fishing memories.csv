He started taking me when i was 7. I am 48. He has passed on. When i was young i remember him always telling what fishing shows were on..he always loved Linder's because they fished for walleyes. He would call me in the living room so we could sit and watch together. On long days he would call down and say he was getting down the canada tackle boxes. See we had gear for river fishing and things around home but we also had our canada tackle and canada tackle only went to canada. So not used but once or twice a year. We would get down the tackle boxes and sit there and talk about different lures and what worked and what we caught on them and where we were at. Lures that worked well and lures we wanted to try. After a few hours of looking at them back up in the attic they would go. Man...i loved those days and miss those days. What great memories fishing and canada can give you.

6409302,Matcaz,2020-03-16 14:48:00,22,"Growing up in Rural Nebraska I had few options regarding my free time. I could play with my siblings (three sisters), I could explore the local pastures with my dog, or I could dig up some earthworms from our garden and walk to one of several farm ponds. It was either the 2nd or 3rd choice for me, and many times it was both in the course of a day. The water bodies I had access to from the neighboring land owners consisted of water shed dams, stock ponds, and irrigation ponds. I had five to choose from and all them contained one and only one species, the yellow bullhead. So bullhead it was. I may have only had one type of fish to catch, but I had five options for where to catch them, so that became my way to vary the experience. Although I didn't know it at the time, because it seemed just a way to get out of the house and enjoy a summer's day, fishing became a passion. *** My father grew up post-depression and the dirty thirty's. His pre-teen years took place during WW2. He lived on a farm and his outdoor activities centered around farm work for the family and helping neighbors. His free time was spent playing organized sports, notably baseball. He never had the time or calling to go out and hunt or fish. So my draw to fishing was organic. Almost all rods/reels and tackle we owned were mine, bought and paid for by me. Although my quarry never changed, my love for fishing never wavered. *** It was one summer in my early teens when I learned that the previous year, a local dairyman had stocked Bluegill in his irrigation pond. To most catching bluegill doesn't spark the imagination, but to me, it was a revelation. I couldn't wait to for the chance to try to catch something new. My father saw the excitement and offered to take me the 3 miles by car, so I wouldn't have to walk. I could barely contain myself. When we arrived I immediately threaded an earthworm on my hook, and with my 3/8oz weight, cast it out to the depths to rest on the bottom, just as I had done thousands of times in search of bullhead. I waited and not a nibble, but I was patient. I waited longer, but nothing. Enough was enough and it was time to try something new. I dug in my tackle box and pulled out my Red and White bobber. If those bluegill aren't on the bottom perhaps they are near the surface? So with bobber fixed to the line 18 above my worm, I cast it back out to the middle and waited. *** Fishing for me is not so much about the catching. If it was, as I look back, my interest in fishing may have waned with each successive bullhead I caught. Instead, fishing was my escape. A way where I could venture out alone, just my dog and I, and experience the sounds of wind through the trees, the call of the blackbird, and the lapping of water against the shore. It was in these times where my mind was set free to think, reason, and wander into imagination. But this summer day was different. *** Growing up in rural Nebraska at that time meant that what you know is often times learned from what you experience. It was a time before cable and satellite television and we grew up with only four channels. The thought of the internet was something out of science fiction. All my knowledge of catching fish was based off of what I had done to catch bullhead. I has no reason to know that what worked for one fish, wouldn't work for another. That is until an accidental twist of fate changed everything for me. *** My father loved me unconditionally, and I him. He was my hero and who I aspired, to one day, be most like. However, he was also pragmatic, and when it came to fishing, I was not. He took me fishing this day, not to fish himself, but to simply spend his time with me. Remorsefully I know that better now that he is gone, than I did in the moment. After a hour or so he saw the futility in our efforts and after several of my pleads for five more minutes insisted it was time to go home. Some feel that luck is simply when preparation meets opportunity, and there have been instances in my life where that seemed to be the case. But it wasn't on this day, luck was simply luck. As instructed, I reluctantly reeled in my line for the last time. The feverish anticipation that had consumed me was turned to disappointment. I had nothing to show for my efforts and all possibilities of fishing for something new seemed lost to me. As I was ready to remove the worm from my hook, I tucked the rod handle and reel under my arm to free both of my hands. At that moment, as luck allowed, I accidentally depressed the button on my Zebco reel. The line fell into the water along the banks edge amungst the reeds, and the bobber submerged and disappeared. Soon after, the first of many bluegill was pulled to the surface. *** Turning 16 and being able to drive opened doors to knew fishing experiences. I subscribed to Field & Stream, I began watching fishing programs on our new satellite channels, and my understanding of different fish species and how to catch them blossomed. With money I had saved working summers for my dad's business, I was able to purchase a 10' Fiberglass Bass Buggy and trolling motor. I went from bank fishing for bullhead on local farm ponds to fishing sand & gravel pits and reservoirs within a few hours from home from my boat. My passion for the sport wasn't lost on my parents. During my senior year they sat me down and I was told that my high school graduation present was going to be a trip to a Canadian fishing lodge. I was shocked and overwhelmed. Although my father wasn't a fisherman, he saw the love I had for it. The summer months were the busiest time of the year at my his place of business. The fact that he was willing to make the monetary and time sacrifice to fulfill a dream for me will never be forgotten. I had never caught a walleye. I had never been on a body of water that held Northern Pike. These would be un-charted waters and I, a novice, would act as the guide for my Mom, Dad and sister for a week. I devoured every once of information I could find. I bought books, picked up magazines, and watched every episode of Babe Winkelman's that I could find. Our success or failures could be due to lack of skill, but not due to lack of knowledge if I could help it. *** After high school I continued to work summers for my father's business. My college spring breaks were spent working so that I, and a small group of friends, could continue the Canadian trip tradition. After college, and with my father inching closer to retirement, I joined his company full time. However, my new tradition was going to continue. My father would always come and put in extra work at the office the first week in June, so that I could continue taking my annual Canadian fishing trips to the same camp he first took me to. *** My dad was not a fisherman. He couldn't teach me how to tie a knot, cast a pole, or remove a hooked fish. But through fishing, he taught me things much more important. I just didn't know their true value until my Father's time had passed. It wasn't the pursuit of my first bluegill, but the sun on our shoulders sitting together in the grass waiting for my line to tighten. He gave me my first Canadian fishing experience, but as I look back my dearest memories aren't about fish we caught, but the experience shared. Life can come at us so fast, that many times the things we come to hold most dear are missed in the moment. It isn't until it is too late do we realize their true importance and the impressions they've left upon us. Memories that echo in the recesses of my mind."
6409832,Walleye2242,2020-03-17 12:47:00,263,"Thank you for the story. I was hoping folks would share how they came up with memories. My dad and gramps were brickmason. I grew up laboring for as long as i can remember doing rat jobs to pay for canada trips. They would work weekend jobs all year just for 10 days of canada fishing. We had a small off grid cabin on a river. Every weekend we were there. Trot lines for catfish. pan fish and smallies and carp fishin in the morning. 6am wake up call to go catch carp!!!! haha. Flooding our backyard at nights to catch worms. Seining small creeks for minnows and craw pappies. Run lines at 11pm, 3am and in the morning just to catch catfish. Started going to canada at 7. Clay lake...north star lodge was my 1st place. 1st lure...black and gold wood rapala...caught like 5 walleyes the 1st day and thought i was in heaven. 5 of diamonds daredevil caught me a 8lb pike that year. boy...was i hooked. for the drive up...loaded up my in fisherman and fishing facts magazines to read on the way."
6410114,andreindy,2020-03-17 19:48:00,308,This was nice to read. How did you do on that first Canadian trip with your family? I am sure there was a degree of pressure placed on yourself.
6410536,Matcaz,2020-03-18 07:39:00,22,"The camp we went to didn't offer any guides, but the owners pointed out a few places to try on a map they gave us. Catching walleye was a grind, temps were in the low 40's and rained off and on most of our trip. The weather was quite miserable. We spent the majority of our time casting for Pike. It was more productive and kept us warmer than sitting and jigging. After my father passed in 2005 work, family, and kids activities put an end to my traditional June trip. But 8 years ago I convinced my wife and kids to take our family vacation to my old stomping grounds. I brought my mom with us as well, as a thank you and remembrance of that first trip. They loved the trip and now we take a Canadian fishing trip every two years. It is OUR new tradition. We don't go back to my original camp because the 23 hour drive is just too much for kids. We've started hunting Sunset Country Ontario for somewhere that recaptures that same type of sentiment. Really, I feel more pressure to find and catch fish now, with my wife and kids along, then I did on that first trip. I REALLY don't want my new tradition to die."
6410578,Bill Krejca,2020-03-18 08:30:00,6107,"Ha! Yeah, kinda looks like wording for a vote issue, which maybe forces one to read 1/2 dozen time to interpret. I agree, I seem to have more time to type stuff, now that most other activities are shelved. So the answer today is yes!! Subject to change. Bill"
