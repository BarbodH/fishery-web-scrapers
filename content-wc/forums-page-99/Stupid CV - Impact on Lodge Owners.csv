6407740,hoppy63,2020-03-13 12:13:00,367,I will do my part and volunteer to self quarantine at a remote lake/cabin from now until say......Sept??????
6407790,Limeyangler,2020-03-13 13:06:00,563,"While I’m hoping that everyone gets to come on their holiday ( I just cancelled our holiday to the UK, we were flying there next weekend) the idea that everyone coming here will be self isolating because of the remoteness we enjoy in NW Ontario is fine, unless you are bringing the virus with you, to me that is the whole point in restricting travel."
6407850,DaBirdman,2020-03-13 15:01:00,164,"Look, if the people want to rip me, that's fine. I'm good with it and it's to be expected in today's world. I'm not going hysterical over the whole ordeal with the virus. There's enough people doing that already. I won't speak for all people in the delivery business, but where I work, nobody is worried....and every day we touch thousands of pieces of mail that have been touched, or licked, by thousands of people. So, feel free to keep on ripping and belittling. I'm out."
6408024,Aspencreek,2020-03-13 22:16:00,2911,"I'm with you. If some people want to participate in the hysteria fine go ahead. But I am old enough to remember when we were all supposed to perish in the Bird Flu, H1N1, SARRS and all the others. But for some reason we survived."
6408086,That Minnesota guy,2020-03-14 06:43:00,8293,"This whole thing comes down to personal choice. But also the responsibility that comes with being a human. If you think you have contacted someone who has it by all means hunker down for a while and if not feeling well get tested. Don't run around in a crowd risking others. If you are scared buy a bunch of food, buy toilet paper, hunker down in you mancave for a few weeks or months and this will either pass or kill the planet. The same people who blame the government for the hysteria also blamed the government for the slow hurricane recovery efforts. But, those people also somehow think government should be our savior and protector. Only protection the government needs to provide is military. Beyond that they can provide warnings and updates on health concerns but ultimately people have to be held responsible for themselves. Put up the big boy pants and take care of yourself and yours. Much like the Cuban Missile Crisis this will pass."
6409520,BuckeyeBill,2020-03-16 22:34:00,76,"Like a lot of you guys I have tried to rationalize whether or not this threat is real or has it been blown out of proportion. My first reaction was the fact that the regular flu takes out more people each year and that has never shut the country down. This is an election year and we know how dirty our politics can get, so maybe that is whats behind it. But then I got to thinking about the billions of dollars this is costing sports leagues & teams, colleges, all manner of businesses etc. You get my point. No way would the NHL, NBA, MLB, march madness have agreed to shutting everything down if they didn't feel this virus was a real threat. ""the love of money is the root of all evil"". Read that somewhere. :-) I had to cancel my Ontario trip this year (early June) because of a heart attack and eventually a quadruple bypass. Just now starting to feel a little better but knew I wouldn't be able to handle the trip this year. Will be 69 next month (diabetes also) so I fall in their category of being vulnerable to the virus. I will heed their advice and and stay on the farm until things settle down. Having a 2 acre pond will sure keep me from getting bored. My best to everyone and I sure hope you get to make your trip north. There is nothing quite like it !!"
6409564,MrSimon,2020-03-17 06:21:00,922,"""Not believing the hype"" and ""being responsible with your health"" are not mutually exclusive. You can do both. Sure, maybe it's overblown by the media and maybe it's about politics or money .... but at the end of the day we're stuck in this situation. And people really are getting sick and dying. Might as well take a few weeks at home with the family and relax. We can't change it, so make the best of it. If you HAVE to be out and about, just be careful and wash your hands. That's not so hard."
6406684,Carnhzkr,2020-03-11 17:02:00,964,"It seems that one of the hardest areas to be hit by this stupid CV will be travel and tourism. The US government has formally recommended US citizens avoid cruise ships (although that hasn't stopped my good friends that are still planning to leave for Florida to depart on a cruise this weekend). I was scheduled to fly to North Carolina next week for a conference, but my company has cancelled all travel unless deemed business critical. This all gets me wondering how concerned Canadian lodge owners are at this point. I'd imagine that answer is ""very"". I haven't heard any speculation, but I would think it's entirely within the realm of possibility that the US/CN border could be shut down or at least restricted in some fashion by this summer. Maybe not, but I'd have never imagined the Final 4 would play to an empty stadium and my son would be taking his college courses online but that has all become reality. I'm willing to give up a lot of things but they'll only get my Canada trips when they pry them from my cold dead fingers."
6406692,Esoxfeign1313,2020-03-11 17:17:00,79,It’s touch-and-go at this point. Hopefully it simmers down and the border isn’t restricted/closed. It makes me ill (no pun intended) to think my trip will be cancelled because of this virus. Time will tell.
6406708,Eckohlt,2020-03-11 17:38:00,3685,"Anything Is possible at the border,as we have found out about dealing with things in the past such as food and bait not allowed across,not much we can do about it,it's out of our hands"
6406714,RichA$1970,2020-03-11 17:58:00,1159,"Being blown out of proportion for political reasons. I accidentally looked at my 401k and f-me, but it will rebound. I’m not heading up to the border til mid September so it should be well over and hope everyone can enjoy peace n quiet up north."
6406720,Pooch,2020-03-11 18:23:00,4618,"No use fretting over this quite yet. Yes, it is a pretty serious health emergency, but fishing season up north is still a couple months away. Once folks are able to get outdoors into fresh air it seems the spread should slow down. Especially those of us living and working in open country. I've no intention (yet) of cancelling our trips north unless the borders are closed. Just bide my time and see how this all plays out. I'm care taker for my cousin who is in a memory care unit. The facility locked everything down yesterday with no visitors allowed in. Anticipating this I stocked him up on ""pull ups"", toothpaste and Kleenex. Glad I did as there is no toilet paper or paper goods in any of the stores. Even Costco and Sams shelves were bare! People on national news fighting over a bag of TP? Come on America.......... Patience and common sense would be of value about now. Pooch"
6406726,DaBirdman,2020-03-11 18:26:00,164,"I agree. Being blown out of proportion. The normal flu has killed far more people, especially in the winter of '17-'18 when some 60,000+ died. The Canadian military better have an armored tank brigade at the border if they want to stop me. Haha Seriously, it's being overhyped by media IMO. I work for the US postal service and deliver multiple parcels from China every day. Some from Wuhan. My wife was in Washington & Oregon for 2 weeks recently where there's plenty of Covid 19 cases. We're all doing just fine."

6407346,oldlund,2020-03-12 20:26:00,209,How could you do better at social distancing than a trip to a cabin in NW Ontario and then out in a fishing boat? We ought to get to deduct that this year. It's for the good of our neighbors :-)Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk Pro
6407472,tv4fish,2020-03-13 06:26:00,2694,"WELLL - apparently a lot of mayors, governors, school districts, colleges, are ALL falling for this ""overhyped"" activity then................... I don't think it helps anybody to have your head ""buried in the sand"" and ignore what is actually happening..........."
6407548,HeHooksHimself,2020-03-13 08:16:00,725,"It seems to me that when the dominoes start falling everyone has to comply. If you are the lone sports venue that continues to operate and one person falls victim to COVID- 19 you will get your azz sued into bankruptcy. I agree that being in a remote lake with only one other person all day and perhaps 5 other people for the evening makes your chances of contacting a carrier even less likely than ever is worth the chance. It scares me how fast the government can take control of your life and how fast the issue got politicized. In any case, no need to be snotty to others on the forum because you think you have it all figured out....IMHO Fish On! Hooks"
