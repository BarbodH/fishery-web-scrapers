Started around 3 and allthough lots of walleyes cruising the bottom thet didnt want any lure from straight hook and minnow to lipless baits.Around 7 though a short lived bite for 40 min happened.Caught a bunch and at least the boys got a walleye supper.Rod drilled holes away from the shacks and in shallower water and did quite well and Rob and myself ended up catching them near the shacks.hopefully the action will pick up as they have today and tomorrow yet."
