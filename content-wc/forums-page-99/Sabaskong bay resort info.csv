6406510,Guest,2020-03-11 10:17:00,0,Years ago I met a guy that came off the lake with some VERY nice crappie & smallies. I can't seem to remember if that was fall or spring. What time of year do you recommend fishing for crappie & smallies?
6408124,Bill Krejca,2020-03-14 07:33:00,6107,"Re: crappies - For fishing in shallow water, during spawn, late May, early June. For fishing deeper, September. The fish are congregated during these times, and generally more predictable as to location. Between these times, the fish tend to be a bit scattered and not as likely to stay in the same place for a sustained period. Bill"
6408142,srj,2020-03-14 08:08:00,971,"Crappie fishing has become more difficult in the area over the last couple years. Crappies have been targeted for netting the last couple years and it seems to have had a considerable impact on the population. A few bonus crappies used to be expected in the summer while walleye fishing but not for the last couple years for us. This winter, the crappie bite has been much slower than past years. Crappies seem to spawn successfully in the area so I hope they come back strong."
6408580,Bill Krejca,2020-03-15 07:50:00,6107,"Netting has been perhaps the most significant contributor to the decrease in the crappie population in certain areas. It has certainly been the cause of the decrease in the area of which I used to love to fish. Nets of seemingly 1/4 mile in length, which I personally witnessed being set, severely reduced a great fishery to an almost dead sea. Bill"
6408616,Daddybigfins,2020-03-15 09:41:00,484,Which areas of the Lake get commercially fished Bill?
6409080,Bill Krejca,2020-03-16 08:11:00,6107,"Re: Which areas - I am not familiar with all areas, so I can not truthfully answer. Out of regard/respect for the folks who run camps on the lake, I'd prefer not to inject specifics, sorry. Bill"
1071999,TJP,2009-01-06 18:57:00,6,"Has anyone been to Sabaskong bay resort or fished in that area of LOTW. I'm trying to decide where to go for multi-specie fishing with an emphasis on muskie, pike and walleye. also looking at Eagle, Wabigoon lakes. Thanks in advanceTJP"
1072002,Obabikon,2009-01-06 19:08:00,2370,"I own a resort about 10 minutes from Sabaskong Bay... it's a wonderful place to fish. Also, the owners of Sabaskong Bay Resort are very good people, and have put a lot of effort into improvements. They run Honda 4-strokes out of the camp. feel free to email or PM me if you have any other questions."
1072017,@Lunker,2009-01-06 19:55:00,835,"As I replied to your post in the General Topic section, travel just a bit further north on the same water and check out www.witchbay.com"
1072042,Obabikon,2009-01-06 21:10:00,2370,"That's the same lake, but different water... witch bay would be what, and hour or more boat ride from Sabaskong. Sabaskong will provide you excellent muskie, walleye, big northern, and small mouth fishing... also, depending on the time of year, fantastic crappie fishing. It also has less traffic than does other areas on Lake of the Woods."
1072194,Busman,2009-01-07 14:57:00,146,"Obabikon, Does your lodge offer an American Plan/Bring your own boat package?"
1072220,Obabikon,2009-01-07 15:59:00,2370,Yes... we're almost strictly American plan... with a couple open weeks for our house keeping cabin. Own boat rates are definately a lower rate... and we do have electricity on the dock for your boat.
1072226,TJP,2009-01-07 16:12:00,6,"Obabikon, what weeks do you have open for housekeeping packages. I'm footing the bill for three on this trip and American plans just don't fit my budget. Your area of the lake sounds what I'm looking for.TJP"
1072230,Rather Be Lucky,2009-01-07 16:18:00,256,Please check my reply in general discussion. Swede
1073166,Guest,2009-01-11 19:51:00,0,"If you are footing the bill for 3 people, you should be shopping around a bit more. I've browsed rates in the area and you can do significantly better for housekeeping and not lose any quality. I would never pay the rates for housekeeping they ask for an islands. I wouldn't be able to afford 3 trips a year if I did that. Looking on mainland would be my advice without naming names. Good Luck."
1074295,Guest,2009-01-17 12:30:00,0,"Here are some links to rates for housekeeping camps close to Sasbaskong Bay Lodge, including SB Lodge itself: I don't attend many shows anymore so if there are show specials not advertised, I wouldn't know about them. Sabaskong Bay Lodge: http://www.sabaskongbaylodge.com/html/rates.html Red Wind Lodge: http://www.redwinglodge.net/rates.htm Mylie's Place Resort: http://www.sportsmansresource.com/myliesplace/rates.htm Don't forget to consider the exchange rates again if someone is charging Canadian dollars. We are back on the good side about 20 cents right now. It really amazes me how much more some places think they can charge, but if people don't know the options, they might not get the best value.
