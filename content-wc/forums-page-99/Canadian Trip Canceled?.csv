6410014,Baseline,2020-03-17 16:39:00,3207,"I live within 2 hours of of Canadian Border at I-Falls and I frequently make spur of the moment trips to Canada for fishing. I may have to call more than one resort, but I always find accommodations on a lake I want to fish. So be flexible. Maybe you can't make it the week you want to go, but there is a lot of availability throughout the summer. If you can work with original resort and leave your money with them to use at another time. Refunds could kill their business."
6410538,gmattbruin,2020-03-18 07:41:00,174,"Is this ""question"" not similar to the early-late ice out question tht is asked, posted each and every yr? Our outfitters probably have no idea at this time what in the world the situation will be in late May early June. We are 2 months away at least. Each and every day our ""leaders""...UGGHH, i use tht term with reservation, are making new policies as this escalates. My guess is they, the outfitters are just going by the news provided to them and us. Each camp of 6,8,10 guys is obviously a nice option for us and imagining being in a remote camp is a safe place to be. But to get there into tht camp we have to go through the process of travel, meeting up at a base, get on airplane. The pilots will be dealing with MANY people, handling gear,etc....so our remote venture has many variables other than just us imagining being in our remote safe place. Our trip is 2nd week of June. Im just gonna chill till mid May or so and see whats happening then. Our outfitter lives in Wisconsin. Just he and his family getting up to his base come the time for him to get there is maybe more of an issue for him than all of us fishing late May-Sept. Hopefully....the ice will be gone and so too this virus and as usual, the season will be like all the others...great fishing!!!! Cheers"
6409236,walleyenewby,2020-03-16 12:52:00,36,Unless things fall together quickly I'm guessing beginning of May trips are toast. All because of people living with or eating bats. This economy is really going to get damaged unless they appropriate at least 1.5 Trillion to help people. Geez
6409238,mixedbag,2020-03-16 12:57:00,76,US citizens OK for time being:https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/cbs...irus-1.5498866
6409258,Skywagon,2020-03-16 13:31:00,1106,"I just listened to an hour long television conference with Trudeau and some of his cabinet. US citizens may cross the border, but must self-isolate for 14 days, the same as Canadians that have been asked to come back home from other countries, the exception to this is for essential service personnel (flight crews and regular cross border deliveries). My guess is that later this week it will be announced by both countries that non-essential cross border travel will be stopped for an undetermined amount of time. At the least until there is an announced change in policy, an American coming to Canada must self-isolate for 14 days before they will be allowed to go back across the border."
6409332,Pooch,2020-03-16 15:42:00,4618,"So does this mandate my one week trips will turn into two week trips? If so, I'm in! Pooch"
6409342,Skywagon,2020-03-16 16:10:00,1106,"Gary, I could make your dream come true and rathole you away somewhere for a couple of weeks, but first your boat would have to be thoroughly cleaned and quarantined to make sure you were not transporting any spawn from those silly smallmouth, would not want to contaminate my lake."
6409374,ackvil,2020-03-16 17:40:00,177,We are scheduled for Mid-June. If we have to self-isolate for 14 days I don't know how we could complete the trip.
6409380,eyecatcher1,2020-03-16 17:42:00,323,I have a two week trip scheduled. Does that count?
6409460,tandm,2020-03-16 19:20:00,679,"This thread is like watching the news. All speculation. Contact the operator of the lodge you are headed for 2-3 weeks before your trip and get the latest updates. He/she may even contact you first. As posted earlier, life should be more important than 2 fishing trip. Just my observation, great fishing and good health care do not go hand in hand in Canada."
6409482,RichA$1970,2020-03-16 19:44:00,1159,Just talked to #12 Aaron Rodgers and he said to everyone “RELAX”.
6409570,BornToFish,2020-03-17 06:31:00,1224,"Greetings, I was to leave today for an ice-fishing trip to NW Ontario. My group canceled the trip in view the situation with the border crossing and upon the recommendation of friends in Canada. The situation in NW Ontario sounds fairly similar to what we are experiencing in the mid-west in the US. My group is thinking the fish will just be bigger and hopefully less educated when we go next March. I believe that many owners would normally be leaving for their lodge in about six weeks in order to be ready for opening weekend. It will be interesting to see how things play out for them in the upcoming weeks. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6408890,jabecker,2020-03-15 18:17:00,118,Just talked to my daughter that lives in Wisconsin. Both her and her husband work at a state owned prison. They have been informed that because of the Corona Virus they cannot leave the state of Wisconsin. There trip to Europe was canceled for April by there cruise line. My other daughter who lives in Madison and has two kids were informed school has been canceled until April 6. We typically go to Ontario the second week end of June. I am assuming even if the kids are schooled at home by online teaching they may have to make up some school time. Their school usually gets out the Friday before we go to Canada. So assuming the worst I called our resort in Canada and talked with them for quite sometime. Ninety per cent of his clients come from the US. I asked about the cancellation of our 2020 trip and he said we can take it one day at a time. If we have to cancel my deposit can be used for 2021 and we will not be out any money. We would also have the same cabin that we normally stay in. Anyone else have any concerns about their trip?
6408894,That Minnesota guy,2020-03-15 18:25:00,8293,"I have some friends that have 2 or 3 trips booked. One is opener weekend in Ontario, thats the one I would be worried about. Does no good to worry about this stuff. The Government will do what it does and there isn't anything we can do about it. I am curious if they will band state (Minnesota) to country (Canada) travel or just state to state. We may need to open the old prohibition smuggling lines up again."
6408922,Richard B,2020-03-15 19:02:00,735,My daughter is a teacher in Georgia. Her school district is closed until further notice. She stated that with the online teaching everyday they will not extend the school year. My son is was attending college but of course they have gone to all on line courses now. His classes will end at the same time as normal.
6408954,The tank,2020-03-15 20:36:00,340,I have two trips planned. Opening week and last week in july not worried at all. It will all be over by than.
6408960,jabecker,2020-03-15 21:10:00,118,"That's what I was hoping that we would still be able to go in June. My daughter in Madison said the schools would close on Wednesday, but that was changed to Monday. A friend of my daughter who is a teacher said that they would not be ready for on line teaching even if they would have stayed open until Wednesday. I hope they are wrong. I still am planning to go. . ."
6409016,Lilly,2020-03-16 05:36:00,2,"It,s not looking good for any trips in may and june. Talking about closing the border in the next week if things do not improve."
6409040,eyecatcher1,2020-03-16 07:03:00,323,I've been thinking about this since this all started a month or so ago. We have a trip planned for two weeks the middle of June and were planning on taking our grandson later this summer after he knows his summer hockey schedule. I guess we'll just have to wait and see now.
6409150,Lamp40,2020-03-16 09:57:00,30,"We are scheduled for the second week in August. If we don’t have a handle on it by then, the trip will be the least of my worries, but I think we’ll be good at that time."
6409172,Bstar,2020-03-16 10:58:00,564,"I agree, we fly in on Aug 15. If this stuff is still going around then we'll be in trouble. I'm more worried about the economy now."
6409214,Bearcat,2020-03-16 12:06:00,209,Uh-O ....Just read that Canada may be closing their border to non-citizens. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
