6406796,Anonymouse,2020-03-11 20:50:00,834,"Pish!Anonymouse is among savages. Some of the greatest classical works of music were written after the artist was inspired by nature to ENHANCE nature.Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony (No.6 in F major; Op.68) is one such piece and if you do not understand WHY, then it behooves you ignorant beasts to listen to it (preferably on an isolated Canadian shield lake while walleye catching) so you finally DO understand!!!So many to choose from too - you could spend a week listening to nothing but great classical compositions devoted to the celebration of nature's bounty.Sometimes it's not the whole of the piece but perhaps just a selection from it that most touches the soul - but whatever length it takes, it DOES enhance nature, not detract from it's enjoyment one iota.Here is but a small smattering to get you started.• Claude Debussy – La Mer• Oliver Messiaen – Oiseaux Exotiques• Jean Sibelius - Tapiola; Op.112 & The Swan of Tuonela; Op. 22, No. 3 (from ""Emminkäinen suite)Sibelius is one of Anonymouse's favorite composers• Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov – The Tale of Tsar Saltan Act III; (interlude) Flight of the Bumblebee AND Scheherazade; Op. 35, I. (The Sea and Sinbad's Ship)• Felix Mendelssohn - The Hebrides;Op.26 (Fingal's Cave)• Frédéric Chopin - Prelude Op. 28, No. 15 (Raindrops prelude)• Peter Tchaikovsky - Swan Lake; Op. 20, Act II: No. 13 (Dance of the Swans)• Antonio Vivaldi - The Four Seasons• Johann Strauss II (the son) - Lagunen-Walzer; Op.411 (Lagoon-Waltz) AND, who could forget ""The Blue Danube"" from the movie 2001? • Gustav Mahler - Adagietto Symphony 5 (Karajan)Believe it or not, Wilhelm Richard Wagner's music was constantly inspired by his walks among the alpine lakes during his 12 year political exile to Zurich, Switzerland.While the Ring Cycle is a little strong on the Sturm and Drang bit, indubitably his source material being the Nordic eddas and his native Bavarian forests clearly seeps through as the violence nature can produce.Wagner, as much as any 19th century composer, is credited with the inspiration of generations of devoted artists, from Mahler, Dubussey, Massenet, & Franc, all the way up to Rammstein (for you Metal lovers)."
6407170,Aspencreek,2020-03-12 14:34:00,2911,"Started reading this and thought I was the only one of the crowd who forbids the radio blasting, now I know I am one among many. I will check the baseball game score and listen to something, but not generally, I prefer the lapping of the water on the side of the boat, the screech of the eagle, or the wind in what is left of my hair. Recordings of Brahms, Beethoven, etc. Sorry, I'm old but not that old, besides I can fall asleep on my own easy enough, don't want to do it in the back of the boat."
6407182,Rock Hound,2020-03-12 15:08:00,51,"When I am fishing, I like the quiet sounds of nature. I will play music while recreational cruising, but not fishing. IF I can get decent reception (they are back on AM WCCO this summer), I will play the Minnesota Twins baseball game quietly in the boat while fishing, but no music. In camp, I also prefer the B.S. of my buddies in the cabin over music, but if we are grilling outside, etc., I like country, 70's, 80's, or 90's rock & a cold beverage (followed by a nap after the meal) & then back to fishing later! I love what I am doing and enjoy who I am with in the boat much more than being entertained by music, and I enjoy music too, just not in that scene."
6408064,Nytron,2020-03-14 05:09:00,48,"I prefer the sound of a fish taking drag and the sound of braid peeling out through the rod guides. Or the crinkling sound of fluoro when your baitcaster is taking drag when fighting a fish.Or that suction popping sound when a bass blows up on a topwater lure.No music for me when fishing. Ever. Might throw on a podcast at low volume, that's about it."
6401414,Pooch,2020-02-29 17:14:00,4618,"^^^^Agree 100% I just want to listen to nature, even the trolling motor or back-trolling the main engine gets annoying on occasion. After a while of quiet on the water even my worn out ears start to hear birds, trees rustling, a fish splashing and other boats or float planes in the distance. I often wonder what am I not hearing anymore. I have miserable tinnitus and the last year or so a low rumbling like a distant farm tractor sound is always in my head. When I'm outside these get tuned out and I can hear nature. I do have a SIRIUS radio receiver in our shop that I take with me to Canada in case something like 9-11 ever happens again. I don't use it, but it's there if needed. On a trip alone I will use it just for company sometimes. When we are in a group it is best left packed. Pooch"

6401756,kona77,2020-03-01 14:40:00,236,"Like others have stated we do not listen to music while we are in the boat. However we do like to relax a few nights and fish from the dock with our favorite cigars and adult beverages.. We will listen to music then and our tastes are geared towards bands like Pink Floyd, Dire Straits, Eagles, Heart, Skynard etc.. Nothing like watching a full moon on a nice Canadian evening with a cigar in one hand..bourbon in the other while Dark Side of the Moon is playing !!! Plus we can still catch some walleye's. Great way to end a day.."
6401766,troutwater,2020-03-01 15:23:00,299,"Little bit of both here too, but when music is playing it's a mix of Tool, Chevelle, Seether, A Perfect Circle, and other rock/metal."
6401878,Guest,2020-03-01 23:30:00,0,"Being a Yank never heard of Kim Mitchell until the 80s fishing trip to Ontario. Been a fan ever since. Being a rock musician, I don't mind music in the boat or Brewers baseball."
6401880,kettyspanky,2020-03-02 03:57:00,271,I am like most and just listen to nature. I don't have a radio in my boat. My partner and I shoot the breeze. Our cabin we stay at doesn't have anything and we take a radio for that just for some different noise.

6402288,andersaki,2020-03-03 06:44:00,1426,"We sometimes listen to music or a ball game on the water if no one is nearby, but keep the volume at a respectful level. A large nearby lake that we fish sometimes has it's fair share of wakeboard boats. They have those huge speakers mounted on the top bar of the boats. With their rock concert volume, along with boat swamping waves, let's just say they're not being very ""respectful"". We try to be off the lake when they come out. andersaki"
6401116,Ltrain,2020-02-29 00:17:00,4145,A radio will never be in my fishing boat and if one is installed in my next boat I'm pulling the fuse and telling the wife and kids it's broke
6401142,camp chef,2020-02-29 06:40:00,915,No music for us either....We used to have music in camp after fishing but now we prefer the sound of nature on and off the water.
6401150,RichA$1970,2020-02-29 06:57:00,1159,"No music as that’s one less thing in the boat to deal with. I am pretty much ready for peace n quiet as I am tortured to listening to the Willie radio station for 16 hours as my dad drives n driver picks the music. After an hour, it is almost as bad as water boarding."
6401158,Clairebear,2020-02-29 07:11:00,937,When I get home after a busy day of catching walleye I like to listen to the sound of my electric filet knife.
6401204,tate05,2020-02-29 08:26:00,99,"Gotta have music, particularly when trolling. For me, Pink Floyd and Jethro Tull seem to be the most fitting on the water.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"

6401236,yoopertrout,2020-02-29 09:24:00,1172,"Silence on the water. Even if I wanted to listen to music while fishing, I wouldn't do it if anyone else was around. It's like playing music in a public campground - You just don't do it."
6401240,Eyecatcher23,2020-02-29 09:34:00,383,"If anyone else is in the boat, no music. But once in awhile while out by myself and no other boats, I like to put in earbuds, sip coffee and wait for chaos. Who knows what I’ll be listening to but bluegrass seems to fit my mood a majority of the time in these situations."
6401298,hoppy63,2020-02-29 13:39:00,367,"I would enjoy some of my favorite Canadian rockers.....The Guess Who and Bachman Turner Overdrive, btw Randy Bachman and Burton Cummings are reuniting for a tour this summer......and a good ""dose"" of the dead... ""the wind in the willows playin ""tea for two"" the sky was yellow and the sun was blue"""
6401356,IaDave14,2020-02-29 15:44:00,99,Usually If I'm fishing with someone else and they want music I defer to what they want but never again. Last fall a guy bought a MP3 player with his CD's on it. I think it was also his wife's because there were some Cher and Streisand songs along with some other garbage I would never listen to. I think the skip button was broken on it. It doesn't get any better than a St. Louis Cardinal baseball game on the Sirius radio in the boat.
6400606,Bigtaproot,2020-02-27 20:40:00,900,"I am a fan of 1980's music like lover boy. Reminds me of my best days in high school when the living was easy like it is on the lake. Makes me forget all of my problems like alimony payments, trailer park past due items, weight issues, back pain, creditors, bosses, shift work, bad knees, and everything else that turning 50 brings with it"

6400766,Esoxfeign1313,2020-02-28 09:15:00,79,"I never in a million years would play music while fishing, but I went fishing on this guy’s boat once and he was playing music. He said fish like it, and it was hard to argue with him because we caught quite a few fish."
6400792,Cornholio,2020-02-28 10:05:00,353,"Yep, I can't stand it when the wife and kids turn the radio on right away."
6400808,eyecatcher1,2020-02-28 10:21:00,323,When I'm in Canada or another quiet lake I never have the radio on because I do enjoy the quiet. If I start trolling and hear the kicker motor I usually turn the radio on then.
6401014,pan-wall,2020-02-28 17:31:00,27,Ditto!
6401102,johnboat,2020-02-28 22:51:00,2014,"A little of both for me please. No radio stations, but how can you not listen to a playlist or two of your favorite music that you've downloaded while fishing up in Canada?Then again the peace and sounds of Mother Nature are hard to beat.So, for me, I enjoy both"
