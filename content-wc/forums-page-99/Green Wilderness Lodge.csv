I'm 79 and still very active and enjoy my yearly Ontario fishing trips. Our group of older fellows usually fly out of White River but because of health issues we decided to opt for a closer drive to lodge. We booked mid July at Green Wilderness lodge on Mattagami Lake. I haven't seen any recent posts about this place, I realize the quality of fishing may not equal the further West lakes but we will be happy being there and catching dinner. I would appreciate any recent information on this place. Jerry, Erie, Pa."

As we travel to our destination I am greatly impressed by the stone cuts along sections of the highway especially Rt. 69. Another observation is the little pile of rocks along the roads, I understand they were originally First Nation sign posts. I don't know if it's legal to do one but I hope to build a small one with a hand full of American and Canadian coins in the center, Maybe this year."
6409686,prov1800,2020-03-17 09:23:00,5010,Not familiar with the route you take.The small rock piles definatly not native. We have them all over out roads here and are put there by guys travellibg north to kill time. Our natives really didnt do much if that they are mainly a inuit thing from up in the artic.But build yourself one dint think there is a law against it.Be fun seeing it on your trips up. Hope we have a season this year

I may be wrong, but there seems to be less than in the past, my feeling is that many were taken down, either by the DOT, and or perhaps the First Nation folks, perhaps due to their beliefs. As a FYI - when Dad explored LOW in the mid-1930's he said there were many out on the water, usually with a stick embedded, pointing the best route up(down) the lake. No buoys were there at that time. Bill"
