6404562,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2020-03-07 15:58:00,240,"I bring 2 Abu Garcia Revo spinning reels--STX and Premier. I also bring a Daiwa SS 1300 reel with a spare spool. For casting, I bring a Revo MGX casting reel. Pair the spinning reels with a pair of St. Croix Eyecon rods, ML action, 2-piece. Excellent quality rods at that $139.99 price point. My casting rod is a 7' Cabelas XML rod, 2-piece. For fishing the typical 6-15 foot outpost depths in late May/June, 6 lb. Trilene XL clear goes on the spinning rods, and 20 lb. Sufix braid on the casting reel. I do use old-school Stren gold color on the Daiwa. Reminds me of my dad, so it always comes with. I recently bought one of the Boundary Waters Journal's new rod cases (designed for 2-piece rods, 6 1/2 ft. or less), and I think it is great. Holds 3 rods. Am tempted to get one of the 6'10"" one-piece St. Croix Legend Elite rods, but I just don't see wrestling with a one-piece rod like that on an outpost trip, especially at that high-end price. For walleye fishing, is it that big a difference?"
6404568,adempsey2.0,2020-03-07 16:08:00,611,"I will typically bring 6 rods. I could bring 8, but that would be a special situation when I am targeting at least 4 species. I use the same Flambeau Bazuka case, so 4 or 8 rods makes no difference. All are <7'6"" due to space limitations in the vehicle and ease for flying commercially. I only use braid. I have various brands, I think they are all good. My only preference is for 4-stranded braid for my jigging and jerk setups. I get too much rod tip wrap with 8-stranded braids. Mostly Powerpro and Daiwa J-Braid, but also Sunline, Sufix 832 and Yozuri.For pike:Spinning for up to 1.5oz. lures. 7' MH with 4000 series reels.Baitcasting for up to 3oz. lures. 7' and 7'2"" MH with baitcasters that can hold at least 150 yards of 20lb braid.Baitcasting for trolling up to 5oz. lures. 7' MH with line counter reel that holds 200+ yards of 50lb braid.Might add a baitcaster for up to 6oz. lures. Not too many choices that are 7'6"" or less.Most are 1 piece rods. Also would use for Lake Trout.For walleye:Jigging rods - 6'3"" and 6'8"" XF M one piece with 2500 series spinning reels and 10lb braid.Everything else I just use 6'6"" and 7' ML and M two-piece rods with 2500 series spinning reels with 10, 15 or 20lb braid. These are for crankbaits, slip bobbers, Lindy Rigs, trolling harnesses etc.. I would also use these for smallmouth fishing and probably Brook Trout/Grayling as well.What mix I bring depends on my main target and type of fishing."
6405030,Crede,2020-03-08 11:34:00,134,"We fly Air Canada to Thunder Bay and then drive to Nakina or Armstrong. Our walleye to pike fishing is about 90%/10% while up there. What I currently take (all 2-piece rods): 1) Legend Tournament Walleye spinning. 6'6 ML Fast. Ci4+ 2500 with PowerPro 15 lb. moss green. 2) Avid spinning. 6'6 ML Fast. Diawa Ballistic 2000 with PowerPro 15 lb. moss green. 3) Premier spinning. 6'0 M Fast. Ci4+ 2500 with PowerPro 15 lb. yellow. 4) Premier spinning. 6'0 ML Fast. Ci4+ 2500 with Gamma Panfish copolymer 8 lb. yellow. 5) Cabelas XML spinning. 6'6 MH Fast. Diawa Ballistic 2500 with PowerPro 20 lb. yellow. 6) All Star IM 10X casting. 6'6 M Fast. Calcutta 200 with PowerPro 20 lb. yellow. #1-4 used for vertical jigging and casting jigs, Shad raps, small spinners, etc. for walleye. #5 used for casting for pike (which I do briefly once or twice per trip). #6 used for trolling for walleye or pike. I have a 44 long, 6 diameter canvas covered hard shell tube I got from Cabelas over 10 years ago. I wrap the rods in a bath towel and then put the bundle in the tube. Weighs 6 lbs. Used to take 1 piece rods in a Plano case but this make the travel much easier for me."
6405088,gordy28,2020-03-08 14:19:00,437,Thanks Brett - thats helpful Question for those that bring 4+ rods - don't you find it a bit of a PITA keeping them in a typical outpost boat (14 foot aluminum) - or do you leave some at the cabin depending on the days plan?
6405096,Crede,2020-03-08 14:57:00,134,I usually have 2 rods in the boat. Occasionally 3 if we are spending all day on the water and not returning to the cabin until it is dark.
6408590,gordy28,2020-03-15 08:28:00,437,That makes sense thanks Crede For our first trip flying commercial I am going to stick w 3 rods To save on baggage fees we are planning on getting rods and tackle for the 5 of us into 3 sets = 3 extra bags vs 5 Cheers Andrew
6409262,Mojo-NC,2020-03-16 13:36:00,1929,"Good point! I bring 4 with me to Canada but generally only have 2 - 3 in the boat at a time (jigging, spinner rigging, and trolling), depending on what species we're planning to fish for that morning/afternoon. The 4th rod is for casting for pike and the least used rod I bring along. Our boats are a little larger (16'), but the concept is still the same. Something else to consider - my buddy had one of his rods (St Croix Eyecon) break in half on a hook-set last time up to Canada. It seemed strange to me that it broke where it did, but I would bet it was from leaning up against and rubbing on the gunnel (gunwale) of the boat and from the vibration of the motor running all day. I don't know for sure but suspect that was the cause. Fishing equipment takes a beating in Canada, especially when fishing from camp boats."
6411910,RichA$1970,2020-03-19 20:01:00,1159,"I bring 3 all spinning. 1 MH, 1 M n 1 ML."

6403912,gordy28,2020-03-06 06:46:00,437,I don't consider myself a gearhead or an expert when it comes to rods and reels But often find its one of those things that first timers tend to ask about How many do you bring? 1 piece or two piece? Braid or mono or flourocarbon? I bring three 1 piece rods - full details are up on a new post but definitely interested in hearing others opinions? Especially for pike set upshttps://www.northernjacks.com/post/m...n-fishing-trip Cheers Andrew
6403916,pjshorthorn,2020-03-06 07:08:00,5654,"I have to fly commercially anytime I want to go to Canada just to get within striking distance of a lake that I want to fish. Over the years I have brought one piece rods in a rod tube as checked luggage, but now I have just gone to two piece rods for ease of travel. I can fit 2 two piece spinning rods ( 5' 6 UL) and 2 two piece casting rods ( 6' 6 MH ) in a repurposed cardboard tube that new rods shipped in when I bought them. I made a handle for the tube and can now just carry my rods on the plane for free and stow them in the overhead bins or in a coat closet on the plane. I have never felt like the two piece rods comprised my ability to catch quality size fish and I can buy new ones with the savings on checked baggage fees of about $140.00 per year. PjShorthorn"
6403946,MrSimon,2020-03-06 08:13:00,922,"One 6' light action 2-pc. spinning rod for jigging walleye - 6lb mono. Nothing fancy. One 7' medium action 2-pc. spinning rod for casting pike. 10lb braid with a steel leader. One 7' medium action 2-pc. spinning rod as a backup. One 4-pc 8wt fly rod for pike. Man is that fun!! Rods go in a plastic tube designed for big rolled up documents. Lightweight, cheap, and plenty strong enough to protect the rods. Reels get packed in my clothing bag."
6403954,JOE WALLEYE,2020-03-06 08:39:00,753,"I would pack the following 3 rods to cover the bases on a pike/walleye/small mouth trip 1) 6'6 ML fast action spinning rod with 8# nanofil. This is a great versatile rod for jigs, small cranks, in-line spinners 2) 6'8 M XF spinning rod. Spooled with 8# trilene xl mono. This rod is great for snap/rip jigging. Working a jerk bait. I also would use this for slip bobbers. Both spinning rods have diawa fuego 2500 xh reels. 3) 7' MH moderate casting rod. St Croix bounce and troll. With a small line counter reel and 14# braid. This will be used for all trolling applications."
6403968,1100 Remington Man,2020-03-06 08:52:00,73,"I have 4 Rods I choose from for Canada Fly in trips but I only ever take in two because of space. I have never needed more and My Tackle bag is from Orvis and holds 4 Plano 3600 boxes and I always have one 3600 full of assorted Jigs, the others depends what is target Walleye’s or Northern Pike. I have never needed more Tackle or two rods. St Croix Legend 6’6 casting M-H fast actionSt Croix Legend 6’3 spinning M extra fastSt Croix Avid spinning 5’9 M extra fast Berkley Bionix casting 6’6 M If it is a Trophy Northern lake like Walston Lake I just take the two casting rods with 17lb Berkley XL mono biggest Northern Pike 47 inch and I have never needed a stronger line but I might try a 50lb Braid on one rod on my next trip to see if it improves my casting distance. Still looking for a 50 inch Pike. If it is a Walleye lake I take the two spinning rods. One with 10lb ProwerPro one 6lb Berkley Xl mono or 8lb PowerPro Largest Walleye 28 inch and 45 inch Northern Pike on the rod with braid spinning rod. Reel choices have been all Shimano but I am going to start trying Daiwa as I have seen good things from them, I never have had a reel break up north. My Rod case is 2inch PVC home made and it’s strong and it holds two rods. I have seen rods show up in camp from other Manufactures rod case with broken rod. Daypack to carry Rain Gear Cabela’s Guide wear and odds and ends. I have had between 15-20 trips to Canada I would guess."
6403998,hoppy63,2020-03-06 09:32:00,367,"I take 3 rods, 1 light action for walleye, 2 medium-MH for pike/lake trout. For the money it is hard for me to beat the pflueger president reals.....the one drawback is their weight. I did treat myself a few years back to the shimano C4........nice lightweight reel for all day casting/jigging. My 3rd rod and reels are strictly back-ups."

6404142,Mojo-NC,2020-03-06 15:32:00,1929,"We have 6 guys and we each bring 2 spinning and 2 baitcasting rod and reel setups - all 1 piece rods. Like PJ, we also have to fly to International Falls or Winnipeg on our way to our destination in Ontario. I have a Bazuka Pro rod tube that will easily hold 12 rods, so that covers 3 of us. The airline (Delta) will also allow us to tape 3 individual rod tubes together and count them as a single bag-check, so we all chip in and tie them together. We carry our fishfinder head units and all of our reels in our carry-on bags.We mostly have an assortment of St Croix Eyecon and Mojo Bass rods with a different brand/model or 2 thrown in here and there. We use mostly Shimano Curado, Abu Garcia Revo, and BPS Extreme baitcasting reels, and Shimano Stradic, Sahara, and Pflueger President spinning reels.I use 20# braid with a 12# fluorocarbon leader on my spinning rods and 20# braid on my baitcasters. Sometimes I will tie on a steel leader for my pike lures as long as long as I don't think it will negatively impact the action of the lure. Otherwise I tie straight to my braid. My spinning rods are medium extra fast and my casting rods are medium heavy fast.Of course, we also have to bring our Disney Princess rod and reel combo."
6404330,gordy28,2020-03-07 07:56:00,437,Some great food for thought I need to think more about the 2 piece I have been thinking about a 7 or 7 foot 6 spinning combination for chucking spoons for pike Maybe a mh or a heavy I do have a cheaper 7 foot Fenwick fish eagle two piece that I use for cottage and kayak fishing and it's a great rod Cheers Andrew
6404372,bthomas3333,2020-03-07 09:18:00,465,"I know it is a good buck but if I was looking for one pike rod, I was seriously consider the St. Criox Premier HF 2 piece. In the states it runs about 180-190. It has about the longest handle you can get in their freshwater line and it has good back bone without being a serious chore to cast all day. The same rod comes in a 2 piece MH too but the handle is an inch or two shorter.My two cents for what it is worth.Brett"
