1468994,Frankie65,2012-08-01 08:07:00,9,"Fantastic report Mike, as you already know, you have definitely sold me on Parks, and their fishing camps.Doug, my family and I will be up at Windermere in just over three weeks. Also, either at Ribes or Anjigaming next year (depending on size of our party)...good luck up at Happy Day!"
1469043,DougBlack,2012-08-01 09:36:00,29,"Thanks Frankie, you too, can't wait, its our first time to Happy Day, and from everything I have heard from everyone here, we won't be disappointed. Message me when you are getting ready to go and I will fill you in on how we did. Ive been to both Ribes and Anjigaming, can't go wrong, if you have any questions let me know. Doug"
1467698,unclepaully,2012-07-29 13:27:00,112,"Mike-Great report! The more I read about Park's the more I like. Also, driving to Wawa rather than Nakina is appealing as well. I might have to plan a trip with them in the future."
1467783,new hips,2012-07-29 17:27:00,498,"Thanks Mike, for letting us be a part of yet another amazing trip. Your trip reports are unequaled. Great memories for you and your kids, that's for sure."
1467803,Whopper,2012-07-29 18:09:00,340,Stellar report Mike. Thanks for sharing
1467986,Mike Borger,2012-07-30 07:52:00,1554,"Thanks guys, very glad you enjoyed the report!Cheers Thanks bud, and yes it was distressing to say the least.It's too bad because I've always enjoyed Hawk Airs camps.On the plus side I'm happy with Parks and flying out of Chapleau is substantially closer for me compared to Hawk Junction coming from southern ON."
1468657,[email protected],2012-07-31 14:12:00,21,"Hi Mike, As you know, this is my favorite fly in lake. We too had a great trip into Ribes. Had fantastic quantity and quality of walleye and northern pike fishing here. My ten year old orange tape flags on the trail to the cliff were getting lighter in color so I remarked the trail. For anyone that goes in here, the trip to the cliff is worth it. Just take a bottle of water along. Although i have caught 36"" and 40"" plus pike here, this year we had a number of really nice ones, but 33"" was the largest. Had large numbers of medium/large walleyes. To anyone that goes...eat the small ones and put the big ones back please. Keep the quality of fishing at its best here. Hawk Air can be negative. There was only two of us so I took along a very light 2.5 hp outboard to keep in the boat. Didn't want the bulk or weight of a full size spare motor in the boat. With only two of us, if for whatever reason a motor could fail, I am too old to paddle a 14' boat up the lake to the camp. With four people and two boats at least someone would come looking for you. They are getting paid for the flight so I am not sure why they should care, but they gave me a few remarks on taking the motor I don't need. Interesting though, is the only outboards I have ever had fail on a trip was their old Johnson's. Martin at least runs Mercury motors, and far more reliable. Regards,[email protected]"
1468671,Mike Borger,2012-07-31 14:46:00,1554,"Glad to hear you guys enjoyed your trip Tom!Not surprised at the comments made to you about the motor. The owner in particular is not a very friendly person.With us he flat out refused to fly our excess gear in on the wed check flight that Park's paid for.We had a 10x10 screen tent that weighed about 10lb's and was very compact.With the cabin being so tiny, along with the heat and bugs, having the screen tent was important. Especially considering my daughter is mildly allergic to bug bites.In his words ""I'm not flying anything in that has to be flown out again on Sunday!"" only beer or pop (of which we had almost none!That didn't fly with me as the tent could have easily been stuffed into one of our empty coolers for the flight out.For whatever reason he was having a bad day and took it out on us.As mentioned the problem with Hawk went FAR beyond this and has unfortunately ended a relationship I've had with them for almost 30 years."
1468744,[email protected],2012-07-31 17:25:00,21,"I also had an awesome trip into Ribes Lake. As always, fishing here was excellent for both numbers and quality of Walleye and Northern Pike. This remains my favorite lake to fish. If you go, eat the little ones and put the rest back. We need to keep the quality of this outstanding lake high. I have done Ribes with four people, and yes, the camp is too small. It is a great camp for two people. Not fancy, but serves the purpose. About ten years ago I marked the trail up to the cliff. I have been back several times since, but the Orange tape was getting weathered so I remarked it again this year. Always worth the hike to the cliff. If you go, take a bottle of water with you. Saw one black bear and one lynx, along with a bald eagle. No moose this year, but I assume this is mostly because bugs were non existent with the warmer weather. Hawk Air also gave me a little flack because I took a 2.5 hp outboard motor in with me. Big deal, they get paid for the trip. One would have thought it was costing them money. If there are four people with two boats and one fails the other will come looking for you. When there are only two people and one boat if the motor fails I am too old to paddle a 14' boat up the lake to the camp. I prefer to carry the 2.5 hp because it is small and light weight, and it can get me back to camp for a replacement motor. Martin uses good Mercury motors. Interesting thing is the only motor failures I have ever had on these trips has been Hawk Air old Johnson motors. Regardless, going into any of Parks' Fly-in Fishing Camps is a good value for your money. Regards,[email protected]"
1468796,JayM5209,2012-07-31 18:54:00,1050,"I have flown with Hawk Air one time. In mid-June this year, after many years of drive-to camps, five of us decided to do our first fly-in. Hawk Air's turbo Otter returned from it's prior trip early and we were loaded and pushing off from the dock 45 minutes before our scheduled flight time. The three guys who did the mid-week camp check went well beyond the call of duty, and took extra time to try to resolve a problem we were having with a mechanical system - and it wasn't even a Hawk Air outpost! Two hours later, after their 8th camp check of the day, they sat down on our lake again to drop off two extra 5 gal. cans of gas. When there earlier in the day they had noticed we were burning gas in the outboards a little faster than another group at another outpost, so they ""borrowed"" 10 gals. from that camp and went out of their way to drop it off for us. On departure day the Otter taxied to the dock five minutes before the scheduled pick-up time.As a 1st time customer (and as an observer who did a bit of flying myself in an earlier life) I'd fly again with Hawk Air anytime, and I'd have no reservations about recommending them to others.Oh . . . . and I had one encounter with the owner. When he weighed us in he brushed off any questions about a charge for the extra 50lbs. of gear we were flying in.Just sayin' . . . . . . . . . . . ."
1468832,Mike Borger,2012-07-31 19:48:00,1554,"I could say a lot too, but I won't.As I said earlier I like everyone associated with Hawk Air except for the owner, who is someone I've known for many years.Also someone who's benefitted from a great many referrals from me over the years.I've had way more good experiences than bad with Hawk Air which is why I always went back.I could go on at great length about the bad, but I'm going to take the high road here.You guys can draw your own conclusions and decide for yourself."
1468918,DougBlack,2012-08-01 05:38:00,29,"Great report Mike, can't wait to get back to Ribes next year hopefully. That was first lake we ever flew into back when Hugh from Pellows owned it. We have been there 4 times and its always been a great lake for fishing, but the walleye the last few years have sure taken over the place. It used to be heavy Pike 15+ years ago with plenty of walleye to eat, but its totally opposite now. Amazingly, we have never trekked up to that mountain, but will on next trip for sure, that is great, flew over it many times, but not the same. Will be at Windermere in a week and a half, can't wait and my boys are getting pretty excited also."
1467123,Mike Borger,2012-07-27 15:53:00,1554,"Hey guys I flew into Ribes lake a couple weeks back with Park's Fly In Fishing just east of Wawa.Joining me on the trip was my 8 year old daughter and my good friend with his 7 year old son.We pretty much won the weather lottery as it was mostly sunny and beautiful the entire week.The cabin at Ribes is VERY small. This is the primary reason why the outfitter hasn't opened it up in several years, just not enough business.So we were the first group to fish it in quite a while.Fishing was beyond expectation with large numbers of walleye caught including a bunch between 25-28"".Did lots of blueberry picking, swimming, cliff jumping, and even hiked to the top of a huge bald rock mountain looming over the lake.The only negative for me was our experience with Hawk Air. Of course this really has nothing to do with Park's as they're simply subbing their flying out to Hawk.It was actually nightmarish, honestly. Without getting into the grisly details the end result was this: I'm now on Hawk Air's ""no fly list"" LOL! and he made my 8 year old daughter cry.Needless to say I wasn'y very happy. On the plus side Park's will now offer their guests the option of flying out of Chapleau rather than Hawk Junction.As an aside to this it was only the owner who was impossible to deal with. Everyone else at Hawk from the office staff to the pilots and dock hands were a pleasure to deal with.That nastiness aside it was a great trip and you can see the full report here with pic's and video clips:http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/f...0&gopid=718356&Cheers, Mike"
1467125,TIGHTLINER,2012-07-27 16:08:00,223,Mike thanks for another great story along with some nice pictures. It is always nice to see someone be honest about a outfitter either good or bad. I think everyone that posts on wc is honest about their trip. Where is the next trip to??
1467136,Mike Borger,2012-07-27 16:52:00,1554,Thanks buddy!Leaving on August 21 for the Sutton River. My friend and I will be paddling it's entire length through polar bear provincial park to Hudsons Bay catching huge brookies along the way.
1467149,Golden Eagle,2012-07-27 17:47:00,2642,What a great trip. Thanks for bringing it to us.I was not able to open the camp website.
1467152,Mike Borger,2012-07-27 18:01:00,1554,"Thanks Connie.It's a pretty bare bones website, but you can find it here:http://www.outpostcamps.com/destinations/"
1467184,Golden Eagle,2012-07-27 19:56:00,2642,It worked for me. Thanks. Gotta have a look.
1467254,Pikehunters,2012-07-28 06:39:00,100,What a great way to spend a !Storming! Saturday morning reading & viewing a report like that.Looking forward to your report from the Sutton
1467288,kona7,2012-07-28 07:25:00,6,"Solo;Another great report. I enjoy reading about all your adventures, but really like the trip reports with your kids. That is what life is really about. Always great to see a youngster with his trusted B/B gun at his side!!!!https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...cons/icon7.gif"
1467294,SinOrSwim,2012-07-28 07:37:00,1528,"THat was a great report! When you said small.....you MEANT small. lol By the looks of the fishing, they may want to think about adding a bigger cabin out there. Impressed the kids jumped off the cliff. That would have made me nervous to let my 7 year old do that but kudos to you and them for jumping."
1467420,Pikeslayer8,2012-07-28 13:41:00,1460,"SoloMikePaddlerBorger, Spectacular report!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I mean, how long were you up there to catch all those walleye and still have time to swim, cliff dive, pick blueberries and climb beautiful mountain vistas. Riley is one beautiful little girl who is lucky to have a dad who knows the very best way to bond. You have an amazing family and your kids absolutely kick arse on a fly-in. Mano is truly all boy and was certainly in his element in the north. How about that beautiful mountain vista towering over the lake. By far, the tallest natural landmark I've ever seen in Ontario. Just a wonderful trip, thanks for sharing that with us. Now about this business with Hawk Air, without knowing or needing to know any details, very distressing to say the least. I personally think that any man who makes an 8 year old cry on vacation will not ever get a penny of my business."
