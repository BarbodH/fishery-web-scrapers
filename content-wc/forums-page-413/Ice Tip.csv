1468972,Jimmy Jig,2012-08-01 07:38:00,1905,"Good Idea! Just wondering, how much does ice cost per day where you go? The camp I go to has free shaved ice. I like that!"
1468977,wallydave,2012-08-01 07:45:00,2151,"At Goose Bay Camp, ice is $2. US for cabin use, ice for the fish cooler is part of the package. We freeze up bottled water too, helps keep the supplies cold on the trip north, doesn't soak things like ice does, and as posted, you have some cold water to drink too!"
1468981,Bigfishhunter,2012-08-01 07:52:00,803,"A good camp won't dime and nickel you for things like that. Good camps may look like they cost more up front, but when you compare apples to apples at the end of the bill, you will find that you spend more on the small things. Some of the camps I have guided at have supplied a set amount of drinks per day, unlimited ice, and even a few complimentary lures and things. Of course these drinks didn't include alcohol, as it shouldn't that is not a necessity."
1468991,Pezman38,2012-08-01 08:02:00,3196,"We haven't had a water blow up in the freezer yet, I think the plastic they use expands pretty well. Our camp a bag of ice is perhaps 4-5 bucks US. I think we pay enough to have ice included, however, I am sure somebody used 100 bags in a week and ruined it for everybody. The ice at our camp is trucked in once or twice a week so it is not free for the camp owners that is for sure. They don't have city water or anything to make an ice machine worth their time."
1468996,bigtimeelectric,2012-08-01 08:11:00,174,It can be expensive especially at a place like lac seul where you have to kill your fish instead of keeping them alive in the livewell. We stay at gawleys little beaver lodge and they have 2 large ice machines and the ice is free with the cabin and we have not ran out yet. Leaving saturday can't wait!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1469021,tv4fish,2012-08-01 09:03:00,2694,"Red Pine resort has a ""dedicated"" freezer for ""fish cooler ice"". They have a number of large plastic jugs that are kept in that freezer - we just grab a couple of them in the morning and throw them in our stinky fish cooler that we use in the boat. They keep the fish cool during our day of fishing. When we get back to the resort, we just rinse them off in the lake and put them back in their freezer. Repeat the next day."
