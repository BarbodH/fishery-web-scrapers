1467897,Rich B,2012-07-29 21:39:00,1081,"My wife and I drove up to Tunnel Lake (some of you may remember CAMP KUHA which was on this lake from 2000 to 2009, and then sold to private buyers), so we rented a cabin from Grand Falls Camp (that have 3 cabins on the lake). It's located about an hour and one-half northeast of the Soo. The positive info first - the wait time about 9 am at the Soo was about 25 minutes and had a pleasant exchange with the Canadian border guard - heading east on Hwy 17 towards Thessalon in the Soo we stopped for the first time at a newer grocery store named PINO'S which is located on the east side of town (just after Tim Horton's on the rights side of the road). This ""Italian"" grocery store was outstanding - great bakery where we purchased some of their Italian bread, Rye bread, cookies, and then over to their meat dept where we grabbed some of their bacon (really meaty) and a container of their olives/mix in the deli. It's a large store with a great selection, and very reasonable prices (less $ than the small grocery store in Thessalon and much better quality and selection). Got over to the camp and put my boat in and docked it - hot, hot and hot - surface temps were over 80 - a local said the fishing had been good over the prior weeks - well, not so much for us and the others in camp last week. My wife and I bottom bounced with leaches and worms, pulled cranks and some casting - marked a ton of fish but couldn't get them to go - another group in camp had one of their guys that had fished Tunnel for over 40 years and they had the same results - enough fish to eat but no action. We did catch nice heavy pike up to the lower 30s, and all the SM Bass you wanted, but that wasn't what we were fishing for....though other than one day of cold rain, it was a nice week weather wise, and met very nice folks at their main camp which is on Cummings Lake - it has Lake Trout and Bass and Pike. We enjoyed 3 great fish fry's as well as grilling out during the week. The owners are going to add a new dock with electric to their camp on Tunnel Lake which is needed and a fish cleaning table, so we won't have to walk over to the main camp to clean our fish (it forces me to get some exercise now - so not all bad - ha). The wait to get back into the USA was about 50 minutes mid-Sat AM (we made another stop at PINO'S for more of their baked goods and bread) and grabbed a can of Horton's Decaf coffee for a good friend back home - interestingly, the US Border guard said no one (from a drive-in) camp did very well on the walleyes last week that he had talked with, though I'm sure others may have had a better week than we did. Then stopped on the way back at Cabela's in Dundee for a few items, and had a very bad customer experience for the first time ever with a knucklehead salesperson in their fishing dept - asked if they carried ""livewell nets"" and this sales guy in his early 60s took me over to their livewell products (minnow dip nets, etc) - I explained that I was looking for a small hand net to pull out fish from my livewell - he then told me he had fished the Bass Pro Circuits for over 20 years and they always ""lipped"" their fish and pulled them out of their livewells - I then said I didn't care how the ""pros"" on the bass circuit pulled out their fish, but I wanted a net that I could net out my walleyes...well, then he told me he'd never fish for walleyes as he could buy them ""cheap"" and why would anyone fish for them ? So, off I go to look at their net selection again to see if I can find the Frabill net I was hoping to buy. What this man didn't know was my wife was still in the area when he had 3 younger sales associates around him listening to him tell them what a @#%% customer just wanted - said he ran a large bass rig with a big livewell, so what kind of ""boat"" I must have had to want a net to pull out walleyes....and they were all laughing....so, when I completed my customer poll to their corporate marketing dept earlier today, I told them I was very disappointed in their sales associate who I named. For what it's worth, the salesman never offered to go to their website and check for this product (which I found on their net selection's 2nd page - it's a Frabill for $14.95 labeled ""livewell net) and told me he had never heard of a ""livewell net"". This guy probably knows his Bass products, but gave crap service to a Cabela's customer, goes to their catalog and website when I'm looking to make purchases, and uses their VISA card - a lousy way to treat a long-time loyal customer. I'm no body special, but when I spend my hard earned money, I at least expect courtesy from sales staff - whether or not they fish bass, walleyes, pike, Musky, etc. We then had a very good dinner at a great Mexican restaurant in Norwalk, Ohio on our way home on Route 250 and my wife enjoyed a nice adult beverage while I had 3 cups of coffee to be sure I stayed awake on the final leg of our return home. All in all a good week, the Lund ran great and made some new friends at camp....now back to work in the AM (ha) ! Rich"

In Cabelas defense, the folks I have run into at the Prairie Du Chien and Owatonna stores have all been very helpful, friendly people. Sounds like the guy you ran into needs some ""education"" from management, his described actions would be considered disappointing and unacceptable. Bill Krejca"
1468192,Rich B,2012-07-30 15:38:00,1081,"Bill,I hold Cabela's in high regard, and understand that not everyone of their floor sales staff can be knowledgeable about all their department's products....however, to belittle a customer (and their choice of fishing for walleyes and pike) in one of their ""Up North"" stores is beyond me.....this sales rep needs to understand they are in the ""customer service"" business, as opposed to how many bass fishing products can I sell today ? Disappointed and unacceptable is absolutely correct.You truly hit the nail on the head, as I've never experienced such rudeness from a Cabela's sales rep in my decades of shopping their various stores (from West Virginia to Michigan to Wisconsin).Their call center staff is especially helpful and professional. Hopefully this Dundee rep will either learn the Cabela's proper way of treating their customers, or move to a department where he does not deal with the public.All in all my wife and I had a very good ""Holiday"" up north....and thankful for the time away from the normal work schedules and all that goes with that.Rich"
1468216,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-07-30 16:50:00,235,Sounds like fun to me.
1468279,BuckeyeBill,2012-07-30 19:18:00,76,"Rich, sorry to hear the walleye weren't cooperating for you. Any size on the smallies you were catching? We are thinking strongly on heading to western Ontario next year. As you and I have talked, the fishing is just so much better there. Long drive but well worth it. Bill"
1468318,Rich B,2012-07-30 20:28:00,1081,"Bill, This is one of the finest SM bass lakes I've fished......they are everywhere in the lake, and about 8 years ago a good friend pulled a 7 lb SM Bass, took a few photos and released it on the shoreline just west of Camp Kuha. Two years after that one of my best friends finally came up to Camp Kuha with me, and we fished in a favorite spot - the first SM Bass he caught that 1st day went over 5+ lbs - turned out that was the big fish for him that week (he caught other 3 & 4 lb'rs) and he never forgot it. The SM bass we caught last week went from a pound to well over three + pounds, and we were not targeting them - just pulling cranks on the 1st breakline. They were very healthy fish, and heavy for their size. It's an easy lake to fish, and feed by a good sized river that you can fish for miles. If you're interested, PM me for more info. Rich"
