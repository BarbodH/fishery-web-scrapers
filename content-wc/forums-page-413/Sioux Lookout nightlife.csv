1463137,IaDave,2012-07-18 13:32:00,476,Troy Mansfield told me the shoe show is no longer. A large female tore down the stripper pole and they never replaced it.
1466337,TroyMansfield,2012-07-25 20:47:00,92,"thats true, it became a liabilty after that, the female suffered slight injurys, and wrecked the wednesday,thursday,friday night life in sioux lookout. missin the good old days up here in the bush"
1466409,tv4fish,2012-07-26 06:22:00,2694,"Troy: Same here -- Back when the ""entertainment"" was down at Dryden --- my 2 buddies and I would make at least one trip down to Dryden -- I remember too many trips back to Sioux Lookout when it was so darn foggy --- you gotta teach those moose to stay OFF the highway at night."
1468241,jimmie,2012-07-30 17:41:00,123,Either can be okay Knobby's may be a bit cheaper Dick & Nellies may be a bit cooler.
1462361,TroyMansfield,2012-07-16 20:02:00,92,"you guys should try the forest inn maybe for food or the lamplighter even, better then dick and nellies or knobbys, and sioux lookout night life starts at midnight."
1462402,Hawkfan,2012-07-16 21:23:00,237,Dick and Nellie's does have some decent pizza though. A few years back we asked them to make a buffalo chicken pizza as it wasn't on the menu at the time. They had something similar like an Alfredo chicken or something so we asked for that with some wing sauce on it. YOWZA was it hot. Made for a LONG flight out the next morning.
1462435,Skywagon,2012-07-17 05:04:00,1106,"This is were the night life if really happening in Sioux Lookout. Copied from the CKDR website last week.Couple Caught During ""Indecent Act""By Shannon Gwynne - July 10th, 2012 - 4:38pmhttp://ckdr.net/news_clips/opp1.jpgTalk about a public display of affection. Sioux Lookout Provincial Police got a call about an indecent act happening on Wellington Street.Police arrived on scene and stopped the couple from continuing the act.The two are each charged with one count of an indecent act.Both are expected to appear in court on August 14."
1462448,tv4fish,2012-07-17 06:36:00,2694,TOO funny.
1462464,Bitinlight,2012-07-17 07:22:00,95,"Ate at Dick and Nellie's a week ago and had great food. Also, found a new version to the Story of Dick and Nellie from the brochure there. Dick was a young fella in search of gold, love, and adventure in the north country. Nellie ran a boarding house, and Dick stayed there often after spending a night in town getting his bearings straight and finding ways to strike it rich. Dick got an offer to fly supplies and men to the mines. Nellie was happy because Dick would be gone during the day and home at night. So he found his gold in flying and his love and adventure, too. He made enough money to buy a new Seabee plane and off he went for more adventure. He did not return as Nellie waited through the winter and spring. Then she got word of a Seabee on a shoreline and hired a flight to check it out. They flew until they could fly no more, and then she set off on foot. Finally, finding the Seabee, and to this day, we have yet to know, the fate of Dick and Nellie-only the two truly know."
1462538,SinOrSwim,2012-07-17 09:15:00,1528,"Dick is the kind of guy who will make up any story to increase business. I wouldn't believe a word that came out of his mouth.We once went to the little bar that was supposed to have strippers a couple times per week. But, we never saw anything because if memory serves they don't even start til 11 pm or so? We fly out at 0600-0700 so being up that late wasn't an option. Not sure we would have wanted to see what we were going to see anyway. lol On the way BACK OUT.......they all look good though."
1462562,tv4fish,2012-07-17 09:39:00,2694,In Sioux Lookout ??? (Now - if we're talking Dryden --- those times I remember........)
1462617,nitrodude,2012-07-17 11:07:00,60,"The Wellington is worth a try also. We went the Monday after Canada Day. We were pounded on 'taki earlier in the day by tennis ball sized hail and just didn't feel like cooking. We stopped at Dick & Nellies, but they were closed (I believe observing the legal holiday?), then saw Knobby's old place (he sold it a couple years back) was packed to the gills. Thought of making do with a big 'ol sammich at Robin's and saw the Wellington light on and seen the restaurant side was open. (Has been open/closed off and on over the last several years.) We had a great dinner and great service! I had the roast beef dinner and it was like Momma used to make. The boys had a huge pizza that was so big most of it came back as cabin/boat snacks for a couple days. I give it a thumbs up as an alternative to the others mentioned. Not knocking the others, but being able to sit right down and start having dinner was just what the doctor ordered. I've also experienced hit or miss experiences with D & N's in the past, but had a couple wonderful dinners there on this year's trip. Breakfast at Knobby's is tops and a ritual we'll probably never change."
1462623,tv4fish,2012-07-17 11:14:00,2694,"Nitro: You may also want to give the Wellington a try for breakfast. We usually do hit Knobby's, but if you like the Fisherman's Classic that Knobby's has and get a little tired of those same ""square"" potatoes that come with it -- the Wellington serves REAL American Fries instead of the square potatoes.... One other ""drawback"" is that the Wellington doesn't open until 7:00 a.m."
1463122,Guest,2012-07-18 13:05:00,0,"Thats pretty funny... At the Chinese Food Place.... I remember when the owner Norman first brought them in...they come from Winnipeg, started late because of the family restaurant up front . Not sure if they still do that anymore or not."
1458520,stumper1300,2012-07-06 15:10:00,231,Anyone care to elaborate on the float plane story for those of us that cant go to find out? Lol
1458522,Bitinlight,2012-07-06 15:15:00,95,"After driving 10 hours a year ago in June, we had to spent the night at the Lamplighter. Went to Knobby's for a couple of beers and a bite to eat. After the first round of beer, we asked for another. The waitress would only serve three of us and said she would not serve the driver a second beer. We were not there to get loaded by any means--just thirsty for a couple of beers. We thought it was a little odd that she would make the decision for us. Have had good food at both. Like Knobby's view of the lake better."
1458523,Bitinlight,2012-07-06 15:17:00,95,"Can't remember the details of the float plane story, but it was good. I will stop there to get the story again on Monday, and post it when I get back on the 16th. If I recall, they had the story on a little brochure or on the back of the menu. We are taking our wives on this trip, and they kinda like Dick and Nellie's over Knobby's."
1458531,Dogbreath,2012-07-06 15:34:00,494,"Neither place is cheap, but we find Dick & Nellies to be a better deal. Upstairs bar is ok also"
1458532,RapShad,2012-07-06 15:39:00,76,"I got this one... The infamous plane was owned by local who was well known law breaker, who liked to smuggle things and was especially fond of hunting moose in remote locations out of season. The MNR knew he was hunting out of season in some remote areas around Sioux Lookout that did not have access by road or water. The MNR got a tip where he was hunting and that he was sometimes actually shooting the moose from his plane from the air (can't imagine how difficult that is). The interesting this was that the area did not have a lake that was large enough for the plane to take out of, so they could not figure out how he could take off from these lakes. Anyone who knows the plane I am talking about and that it is not the standard float plane, the plane lands on its hull and has two out riggers on the wings, and is really small. The plane would still need a substantial amount of ""runway"" to take off. The MNR scouted the plane/man in question and gathered evidence against him. Apparently when he would take off from these little lakes he would tie a heavy rope to a sturdy tree and rev the engine up really high and have his son cut the rope with an ax, narrowly missing the tips of the trees. The MNR were flummoxed that somebody would go to such great lengths to illegally hunt moose. They busted him and took his plane, guns, probably truck etc. and sold it in their auction to raise money for the MNR. Now the plane sits outside of Dick and Nelly's. The plane's hull and outriggers were also hollowed out, used to stash who knows what to smuggle to who knows where"
1458565,Bitinlight,2012-07-06 17:03:00,95,"Way to go on the plane story from Dick and Nellie's, RapShad. I will have one there to toast you remembering the story!!"
1458569,Pikeslayer8,2012-07-06 17:10:00,1460,Great story RapShad!
1458584,SinOrSwim,2012-07-06 17:45:00,1528,"We have been to both and either one is good. We have been going to Dick and Nellies for years but it was after we finallly decided to forget the animosity we had/have for Dick. We went to his ""outposts"" when he had it and it was BY FAR the worst trip in 17 years we have ever taken. He promised the world and delivered very little of any of it. Long story short, we went up and all the beer and food was to be provided at the outpost. Well, we were his last group before he sold the cabins so we ran out of beer 3 times on a 5 day trip, the food was garbage. Box of pancake batter, some old carrots and lettuce etc. He was basically letting us ""use up"" what was left in the cabin but he had no idea what was even there. We had lined up minnows etc and none of that was there like it was supposed to be.He treated us like crap too. Was extremely rude and arrogant whether it be in person or on the radio from the camp."
1458606,wmd,2012-07-06 19:35:00,388,"2 years ago Dick and Nellies was closed on a Friday night when in Sioux Lookout. And I am thinking it was closed the year before as well. Am I wrong, we have eaten at Knobby's the last 2 times up there. Was never unhappy at Dicks place. Has it been closed for a period of time?wmd"
1458768,MorganMan,2012-07-07 10:34:00,341,Duh....his name is Dick. I think his last name is Dick too?!
1458437,maddogg,2012-07-06 12:21:00,178,We will be spending a night in Sioux Lookout next week. Anyone have any recommendations for a good place to eat and have a few drinks?
1458440,Lovetofish,2012-07-06 12:27:00,458,Knobby's
1458486,Bitinlight,2012-07-06 14:11:00,95,"Knobby's or Dick and Nellie's, but be watchful of too many drinks. Well patrolled by the authorities."
1458489,Log man,2012-07-06 14:13:00,3,South end of town has a bar and grill that's great. Look for the float plane on the lawn in the front of building.
1458495,Hewhocookstomuch,2012-07-06 14:24:00,66,I agree. Knobby's
1458501,Bitinlight,2012-07-06 14:34:00,95,The place with the old float plane on the front lawn is Dick and Nellie's. Interesting story behind it. Nice place with good menu and good food.
1458502,tv4fish,2012-07-06 14:34:00,2694,Also agree with this being the place to go to Another benefit - pretty unique view (get a table directly opposite of the entrance).
1458506,Bitinlight,2012-07-06 14:38:00,95,I will be at one of those two places on Monday night.
1458516,RapShad,2012-07-06 15:03:00,76,"Knobby's (aka Sportsmans Cafe) I've had a bad experience at Dick and Nelly's, although the float plane story is very interesting. Hot beef sandwhich with fries and gravy yummm"
1458519,tv4fish,2012-07-06 15:09:00,2694,UMMM - So has my group.......................
