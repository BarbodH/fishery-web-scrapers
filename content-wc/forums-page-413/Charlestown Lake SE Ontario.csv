That board is mainly for Eastern Ontario and has lots of good info. Based on what I've read, the Laker fishing there seems fairly slow and/or inconsistent and the reports I've seen describe what I would call fairly small fish (1-3 pounds). It's entirely possible that the Laker fishing there is better than what I describe but if it is, I haven't seen a report. Take that for what it's worth."

Met a guy there launching his boat and he said there was some good fishing there if you knew where to find them. He lives on the Parkway in Gan, I'll have to look him up."

1468583,Shellback,2012-07-31 11:45:00,8083,"Uh oh, didn't realize that. I'd better check my book out. I usually just fish the river or sometimes over to Quinte. The river is a different zone than the lakes on the mainland.We are probably coming up on the 4th or 5th. I usually leave my boat in the water on the St Lawrence. I guess I'll head up to Charlestown before I dunk the boat in the river. Hope there's some water left by then, my buddy in Gan says it's been going down quite a bit."
