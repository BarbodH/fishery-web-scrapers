Both my dad and uncle (60) are in relatively good health. I've already told them, if its a massive heart attack a phone wouldn't do any good and if its a mild one...chew on some aspirin. All kidding aside, you always hope for the best and prepare for the worst."
1468883,bfish,2012-07-31 21:25:00,1096,"asperin/tylenol,benedryl, and butterfly bandages is what I most often have to replace in my kit."
1468959,digjig,2012-08-01 06:56:00,146,I have a couple of the cold packs that you break up in the bag and become cold in the event of injury and we are out of ice.
1469003,SinOrSwim,2012-08-01 08:19:00,1528,"When we first started going, some bandaids and ibuprofen were about all we needed. Now as we have gotten older Lipitor, baby aspirin and a Defibrillator should be added."
1468643,unclepaully,2012-07-31 13:50:00,112,"What's in your first aid kit??? How elaborate or basic do you go. I am making one up right now for our trip. For the most part I kept it stock, however I'm going to add an Epipen and more bandages."
1468645,Pezman38,2012-07-31 13:55:00,3196,"I bought one at Sam's Club with gauze pads, tape, scissors, travel packs of imodium AD and Ibuprofen, various bandaids, triple antibiotic ointment, a stick light, and other random stuff. I like it for the carrying case and the nice compartments inside which keep things from moving."
1468650,wallydave,2012-07-31 13:57:00,2151,"We fish out of a drive-in camp, Goose Bay new Ear Falls,a clinic is just a few miles away, so I have used a basic drug store version, in four trips I have used a few band aids, not much else. If I was flying-in, I would up grade to something better. The other factors might be the health of the group, any medical conditions should be taken into consideration. At the end of the day, take the one that will address the needs of your group, stay safe, and hopefully you'll never need to crack the kit open!"
1468655,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-07-31 14:09:00,235,"There are two doctors in the group I go with on our fly-in, so I admittedly haven't put much thought into it. They bring all kinds of stuff and can do stitches, supply antibiotics etc. My dad and I (boatmates and non-doctors) bought a ready-made kit at Walmart and have yet to have to open it.The best medicine is always preventive medicine --- use barbless hooks!"
1468664,Hewhocookstomuch,2012-07-31 14:31:00,66,I always pack an After-Bite Stick. Something I can stick in a small pocket to relieve the ich from bites and the sting from stingers.
1468679,camp chef,2012-07-31 15:13:00,915,What ever you choose to keep in your first aid kit.....DON'T forget to refill it in between trips.
1468742,MorganMan,2012-07-31 17:20:00,341,"We have had a small kit with us also over the years and have used little other than a few bandaids. I guess that is good news that we have needed not more than light first aid tackle. We do, however, have antibiotics along for non emergency situations and I could maybe stitch someone up with fishing line and a hook if they were drunk enough not to realize who I was......I have NO training, but would do it if they irritate me!! That is a question is a very real worry if something were to happen, but we have put less attention to it over the years. Many have healthcare dudes in the group, but most don't. I dread the day we are unprepared for such a situation. My advice, be prepared for minor injuries with some bandages/gauze, some cleanser (small bottle of hibiclens available at most pharmacies, cheap), some antibiotic ointment and some pain reliever that most have for hangovers/headaches anyway. Have a great trip."
1468800,jiggster,2012-07-31 19:02:00,183,"I would also bring Steri stripes to close a cut, I had to use them on my son when a tooth from a northern got his thumb. I also bring hydrogen peroxide to clean cuts, etc."
1468804,pikeman14,2012-07-31 19:12:00,144,Don't forget a numbing agent...oragel works well if you can't get a hold of something stronger. Sidecutters for removing hooks is also a must.
1468811,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-07-31 19:28:00,235,"Not sure if your outpost has a satellite phone or radio, but if not, you should rent one. Most outfitters have them available. No matter who you have in your group, sometimes you simply need to get to a hospital pronto. Can be a long wait for a check flight..."
