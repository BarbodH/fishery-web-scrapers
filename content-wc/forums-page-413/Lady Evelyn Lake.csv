Could it be a camp that closed and opened under a new name? I find only 4 lodges on that lake, none with that name. Thanks"
1468250,adempsey,2012-07-30 18:04:00,963,"I recall a couple of other camps that don't come up searching the internet. One is called Lady Evelyn Camp and the other Mitchell's Lady Evelyn Camp. I have no idea if they are in operation and know nothing about them. I recall boating past one of the camps that was close to the dam, but not sure which one although I am guessing it was Mitchells.I got this information from some internet site listing accommodations in the area. No clue if the numbers are still good or not.Lady Evelyn CampTel: 705-676-2116Offers 9 cottages on Lady Evelyn Lake, access by boat or planeMitchellâ€™s Lady Evelyn CampTel: 705-679-8665Located on Lady Evelyn LakeGood luck!edit: doing a search showed those TWO places are actually the same place run by an Elsie Mitchell.http://www.tsacc.ca/page/PTS_Mowats_...dy_Evelyn_Lake"

Used to go there back in the 80's, called a few months ago and they said it's almost exactly as it was when I went and when it was built in the 30's. No running water, no electric (lights only for a few hours in evening).It's in the North part of the lake not too far from Red Pine & Ellen Island. Prices are relatively cheap if you are OK with the lack of modern amenities."

Elsie & Marlene are the ones who ran it back when we went in the 80's. Quote below is from another thread I found online about Mitchell's Camp. "" I am great friends with the Mitchell family who run Lady Evelyn Camp,especially close to the late Sonny Mitchell who tought me a very realistic view of bush life, summer and winter. The family took me in like a son and have treated me that way ever since.Unfortunately, Elsie, her husband Fred [who started the business back in the 20's] as well as two of their children, Sonny and Marlene,are now all gone.Carolyn and Sonnys son, Myles, now run the business."""
