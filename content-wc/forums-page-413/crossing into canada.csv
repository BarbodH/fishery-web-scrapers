We had read about Canada having a policy change whereby they let you cross one time for free. That never came in to play. If you read the immigration web site on the topic, it is very confusing. He called the border patrol station and they indicated that ""nothing has changed"". For whatever that means. We crossed on June 2 at Pigeon River with no problem. My cousin had driven a separate car to the border in case he got turned away. The border agent never asked any questions about the DUI. He was very pleasant and wished us a good trip. He asked all the normal stuff about how much liquor, live bait, gas, weapons, etc. My cousin and I figure it this way. One, it depends on the border agent's discretion. Two, Canada has tacitly eased up on this because of complaints from their own tourism industry. But they can hardly come out and say it, since they are very tough on DUI's in their country. We are going to take our wives across in August for another trip. Good luck, but don't expect to know for sure until you try. PS: Call the border patrol where you are going to cross and see what they tell you."

1469492,tv4fish,2012-08-02 07:47:00,2694,"I'm sorry, But I have a BIG problem with that. How can anyone make a decision of whether they should ""chance it or not"" since it may depend on an agent's ""mood""?"
1469554,J-Man,2012-08-02 09:28:00,191,"I understand your concern, but it's not simply a matter of whether the officer is in a ""bad mood"" or not.The immigration supervisor from FF explained it this way at the NWOTA spring tourism meeting..I'm paraphrasing...""in the past we had to have a good reason to issue a person a TRP..a fishing trip was not considered a good reason previously.....now we have to find a good reason NOT to issue a TRP. If they are eligible for a TRP under this guideline, they will get one in Fort Frances.""Be honest and up front and you should not have an issue in Fort Frances or Rainy River IF you meet the criteria for the ""new"" guideline."
1469597,tv4fish,2012-08-02 10:39:00,2694,"Definition: A temporary resident permit or TRP is a document authorizing a person who is otherwise inadmissible to Canada or does not meet the requirements of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act as either a temporary resident or a permanent resident to enter or remain in Canada. Temporary resident permits are only issued in exceptional circumstances, and may be cancelled at any time. A temporary resident permit is not the same as a temporary resident visa which is issued to visitors, students or temporary workers who meet the requirements for admission to Canada.In addition, criminality and medical issues may prevent a visitor from entering Canada. Visitors to Canada must also be able to prove their ability to support themselves during their intended temporary stay in Canada. J-Man : My point (or issue) is the fact that apparently it IS up to the agent (and, YES - his or her ""mood"") whether an individual is ""checked out"" or not?."
