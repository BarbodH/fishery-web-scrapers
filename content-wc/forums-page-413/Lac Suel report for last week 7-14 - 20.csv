1465615,Lake Wisconsin,2012-07-24 11:19:00,1960,"Steve - prior to me using my GPS, I took a few of my markers and painted them black. When fishing a small area, under 2 acres or so, the black markers will still show up well enough for you to see them, but not good enough for most others to. The other item you can do is throw out a dummy marker. Hold off on actually ""catching"" fish until they leave. Pain in the butt, I know, but it is what I have done as well in Canada."
1465627,skap,2012-07-24 11:44:00,58,"I have to admit that I have not done that before but it sounds like a great idea. To be honest, I expect this to happen on Mille Lacs but not up there. Cant people just leave each other alone and enjoy the experience. There are so many productive spots to fish on those lakes that there is absolutely no reason to have to set up camp next to someone like that.I kind of like the throwing a dummy unit out. Would be fun to see how many people fall for it. Thanks for the suggestion!"
1465633,tv4fish,2012-07-24 11:54:00,2694,"I do it on Mille Lacs ------------ (throw out the ""dummy"" marker - great fun !)"
1465801,IA JOE,2012-07-24 18:19:00,35,"I went to the Onaway website and didn't see any rates. Is it the ""if you have to ask you can't afford it"" type of deal? It seems the fishing has dried up NW of McKenzie Bay and I would like to find an affordable place. Keep in mind my wife is picky. Must be up to date lodging with flush toilet and she has a bad back so padded pedstal seats are a must. My 13 yr old son is pushing 6' tall and 200 lbs so the 3 of us would need a good sized boat. Not looking for trophy eyes but endless amounts of 15 to 18"" fish with a possible 22-24"" once or twice a week. My budget is 1,500 to 2,000 per week for the 3 of us."
1465806,SinOrSwim,2012-07-24 18:36:00,1528,"Last year was our first year at Onaway but we loved it. Not sure if they have brand new cabins for only 3 people so I would ask that? Rates, might not be on there because it depends on when you want to go. We were able to do a 3 day trip last year and a 4 day trip this year because we are not peak season. Very affordable as well. I would give them a call and discuss rates. Cabin we stayed in was new and very nice. Very clean and everything modern. Boats will pass your test as well. My father in law is about 6'4"" and pushing 275 or so and he was fine in the pedestal seats. Our numbers weren't great but weren't horrible either. But, we also went the last weekend in September and it was our first trip to Lac Seul. The 3rd day we caught way more fish than the first. Big body of water to learn."
1465856,Steve of Madison,2012-07-24 20:30:00,230,"Onaway still has a couple of 4 man cabins but they are being replaced. Blair builds them himself and the are really nice compared to the old ones and compared to what many other places have.I'm not sure what the rate will be for next year but for 2012 it was $790/man in a camp boat 2 guys per boat. $730 if you put 3 in the boat.$710/man 2 person private boat. That included 21 dz minnows and 30 gals of gas. Check out the website but the boats are 17' lund outfitters w/ 50 hp Honda 4 strokes and fish finder. Nicest around anywhere!Onaway has a really good return rate so getting a prime week may be difficult, If I heard right every cabin for last week is already reserved for next year by the guys that were in camp, I know I made mine."
1467541,Guest,2012-07-29 01:08:00,0,"Steve, My group was staying just to the west of you at Fishermans Cove. Being from Iowa I want to apologize for the rude behavior of that boat of idiots and hope you don't hold it against the rest of us from Iowa. We had 3 boats up there and we also had a great week especially down in south bay. We bought a flat of worms at cabellas and ran out of those on Wed. between 7 of us, But it didn't matter because they were biting on minnows just as well and also on plastics like gulp alive and twister tails. We trolled all week with bottom bouncers and spinners."
1467608,IA JOE,2012-07-29 08:46:00,35,"Steve, Not all Iowans are created equal. Sorry hear about the manure move someone put on you. Tritz, Thank you the other post. I ws able to get a cabin at Onaway for next year July 5 - 12th. I requsted a guide for ther first day and would consider a second day if the memebrs thought it would be money well spent. Anyone going to be at Onaway during that time? I would like to meet at that time. The wife, boy and I do not like fishing in a crowd would just be looking to share whats working and/or not."
1468218,jimmie,2012-07-30 16:51:00,123,Sorry to hear about more jerks on the water. Please don't get caught up in water rage. It's not worth it. I have encounters from different bodies of water like Lac Seul and here in Minnesota that makes one wonder how some get a license to drive or earned a living in order to buy clothes for the trip. So when I get a Speedy Gonzalas or any other rude folks that think they have to be first or need that ever so precious 20 feet of highway before you get to it I just let 'em have it. I have met more nice fisher folks than not and had very pleasant conversations with most all of them. Life is just way to short to get bent out of shape about such poor characters. Remember they will get theirs in the end. It is for the most part beyand our control anyway. Kill them with kindness. And then go have a great rest of the week!
1464950,Steve of Madison,2012-07-22 21:14:00,230,"Had another great week at Onaway, what a treat. Weather was hot to start and a cool front moved though over the weekend bringing some rain on sun and mon morn and the wind of course but the rest of the week was spectacular.Found fish in our normal haunts, particularly on the mid-lake humps and sand flats. We primarily backtroll spinner rigs and do very little jigging, but all baits were hot when you found fish. Minnows, leeches and worms it really didn't matter, in fact I used 90% leeches and my boat partner used Worms, about even for the week.Water temps were 73-75 depending on the day and wind, water levels were still on the rise and is a bit up over the last few years. The rain on monday morning was torrential and it was rising due to that.I would give you spots but the fish are everywhere.Only one downer for the week. We are working a large sand reef off Manitoba PT with 3 bouy markers. For those of you who know thier way around Manitoba PT you will know exactly what area I'm refering too. It's a mid-lake hump and 2 boats can be a crowd. Our 2 boats are the only ones around for 1/2 a mile, when an older brown ranger with a merc, 3 guys and IOWA tags come blasting down the lake. Now I'm sure you know what is coming next, yup, you got it, they spot the markers, slam on the brakes and actually run over the bouy, trying to get a couple lines in the water. Now I will share, but when you run over the bouy, catch a fish and spend 10 min, and I mean 10 min unhooking a fish in the net, and then pose for Holy pictures I get upset. That fish had to have been dead and they just tossed it over. I picked up my markers and exited in a not so nice fashion. Now if you guys from IA are visiting this post, you know who you are, and you also know how to get in touch privately. I will be more than happy to discuss this with you"
1465067,NWwalleye,2012-07-23 08:19:00,223,"I saw that boat .......We were fishing some hump further down by Windigo Pt .. They never stopped by us, but on the way back to the landing they cut us off trying to get through a set of narrows first .. Then they took there sweet old time getting all there gear loaded and set up, doing this while parked in the middle of the exit rd.I bit my tongue and put it down as a just another unfortunate incident on Lac Seul ..Fishing was great though, right Steve of Madison ???"
1465074,tv4fish,2012-07-23 08:31:00,2694,"Steve: Sorry to hear about your bad experience with that ""other"" boat.Like they say - You can't fix STUPID !!!!"
1465079,SinOrSwim,2012-07-23 08:44:00,1528,"Good to hear other than the jerks in the other boat. Being from Iowa, makes hearing that smart a little more. We will be heading to Onaway in September. Last year was our first trip there and we absolutely loved it. Hope Blair is doing well this year. He had fallen off a ladder right before we got there last year and crushed one of his arms. Surgery, pins etc. Got a chance to meet him the last day or so we were there. What a great camp though. His new cabins are amazing. We went from struggling to get 4 to 5 guys on our normal fly-in to having 12 people."
1465080,lcwhit,2012-07-23 08:45:00,104,"i've had more and more of that crap on lac seul the last couple of years. makes you wonder how someone so stupid can garner the wherewithall to get a boat and take a trip to canada. i did hear, however, that they finance boats for 10 years. perhaps the lodge owners should start giving fishing etiquitte classes."
1465105,WalleyeWally28,2012-07-23 09:59:00,298,"Steve - Glad to hear you had a good week and did it pulling spinners. We are headed back to LS on Aug. 3rd and trolling spinners is also our preferred method of fishing. We are taking our Grandson on his first Canada trip and hope to get him into some big eyes.Sorry to hear yet another story about some jerks not knowing anything about fishing etiquette, or more likely, not caring. We've also had several similar instances over the past couple of years."
1465146,South Dakota,2012-07-23 11:36:00,24,"Hey Steve, I sent you a pm"
1465423,Guest,2012-07-23 21:33:00,0,Don't use marker bouys because of that same reason. Fixed the problem with a GPS unit @ the trolling motor and at the console. Sorry you had the seagulls hone in on you Go find your own SPOT!
1465432,Steve of Madison,2012-07-23 21:56:00,230,"You are right, but first I need to buy a better GPS. But then again I still haven't figured out how to use the one I've got. They make these things so blasted complicated you need to be an MIT graduate just to work them. These GPS mnf. need to remember who they are marketing to. We are fisherman, make it do what we need it to do in a simple straight forward manner. I don't need it to do 80% of the stuff it does."
1465539,PARAJOHN,2012-07-24 08:51:00,15,"Steve,I met you last week at Onaway. ( I was with my family and another couple) I just wanted to thank you again for the map and location tips. It was a fantastic week of fishing and I'm sorry to hear about your encounter.We had a great time at Onaway. It was our first year at this resort (14th at LS) and it was amazing. The customer service and care that Blair and Kathy put into their business truely sets a new standard. After several not so great experiences my family can't wait to go back to Onaway next year. The sure number of repeat customers and bookings proves that if someone does it right they will come and return year after year. We feel truely fortunate to have gotten a spot at Onaway and can't wait to go back to our cabin the same week next year.Major Stats:1 over 27"", 6 over 26"", 10 over 25"", 18 over 24"", and 42 over 23"" split between 2 boats all jigging with minnows.Each of the kids, all 11 and under, caught over 100 fish each for the week. Nothing could have been better than watching them have so much fun."
