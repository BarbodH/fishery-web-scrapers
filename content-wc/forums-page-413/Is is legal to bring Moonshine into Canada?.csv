1466450,Aaron-IN,2012-07-26 07:29:00,500,Mine is actually better than the tennessee home brew sourmash
1466477,Gregking,2012-07-26 08:18:00,2658,I took some half drank bottle of capt across last year. I had my dad with me so when they asked I said 1 case of beer and this capt. I showed them the bottle. I said I'm not sure how to judge this if it's ok or not. They said anything else? I said nope. They sent me thru. On the way home I got 2 each liters of crown. Boarder said what do u got. I said I just bout these crowns and had about 8 oz of capt left that I showed her. She said ok and moved on
1466726,RapShad,2012-07-26 16:42:00,76,It was pretty good stuff wasn't it? It's hard to beat some of that Apple Pie 'Shine from the mountains of Tennessee/North Carolina. The producer keeps his whereabouts pretty secret.
1466852,GOBIG,2012-07-27 02:12:00,126,"I have a standing order with my guy in northern ky. He has made a blueberry before that is according to my co workers the best thing they have ever had. So, i hope to take some up to canada next year."
1468236,jimmie,2012-07-30 17:28:00,123,Not sure they need to if folks have to sneak alcohol in to Canada. Just stay home and get more stupid!!
1468397,octanehi5,2012-07-31 05:27:00,1104,"I do not think that if it was legal, they would call it moonshine. the governments get set against it because the do not get there taxes from this . I am looking for a good recipe for the apple pie shine, that stuff is great. I make my own wine and brought it over the boarder,bottled and corked just like the real deal.made it in no problem"
1468402,yarcraft91,2012-07-31 05:50:00,11487,"Moonshine would be considered an open container of alcohol, as it has no gov't approved seal. Canadian provinces have open container laws, much like US states. If the moonshine is in the truck or in a trailer. i.e., out of reach of the driver and passengers while driving, shouldn't be an issue. And, yes, declare it as alcohol at the border."
1465945,Aaron-IN,2012-07-25 06:34:00,500,"Based on everything I've read, as long as you declare it at the border I guess you are okay. I would not advise sneaking stuff across as suggested though."
1466056,Fishin Fun,2012-07-25 09:42:00,218,"Quite a few years ago we met a bunch of guys from Kentucky that were drinking moonshine that they brought across the boarder. Not sure if they declared it or not. From the stories they were telling that night, not sure about ANY of those guys. Wow what a crew."
1466074,SinOrSwim,2012-07-25 10:15:00,1528,"Well, when it comes down to it they have never asked how much whiskey or rum or vodka we had. Just how much alcohol. Just declare it. Might not hurt to put it in a Vodka bottle or something though. But, I'd definitely declare it. That is one mess I wouldn't want to get caught up in."
1466084,tv4fish,2012-07-25 10:42:00,2694,"UMMM - for all you guys that are suggesting that these moonshiners just ""declare it"" --What are they going to use for a ""value"" (receipt) to know what the duty should be."
1466122,Aaron-IN,2012-07-25 12:09:00,500,"If I just declare it I won't have to pay a duty as I'll be at or under what I'm allowed to take across. If I take more than 1.5 ltrs then I would have to provide a value, if that were the case I'd just make up an amount....say $20"
1466139,Hawkfan,2012-07-25 12:43:00,237,"I don't remember being asked how much we paid for liquor, just beer. is duty in liquor just done by the bottle? I definitely haven't been asked how much for the Jack, the captain, the vodka, the scotch or whatever we may have had."
1466152,SinOrSwim,2012-07-25 13:02:00,1528,"I think we haven't been asked because the alcohol has a higher duty so we use that as our allotted amount. Then, pay duty on the remaining beer. So, if we had more alcohol than what we can take over then we would be asked I believe.I'd put it in a Vodka bottle and take it over. if they ask, tell them $20.00. Not like they will taste it and I don't think there are rules on open bottles."
1466163,tv4fish,2012-07-25 13:40:00,2694,"Don't know if this is current - but apparently it varies It looks like at least $11.00 per litre on the ""moonshine"" -supposed to be different for diff. % of alcohol on the beer.http://betterdollar.com/duty-tax/exc...ar-or-tobacco/I do know - a few years ago when we brought in over our limit on beer - we had to take our sales receipt inside and show them what we had paid for the beer. The ""duty"" was then based on what we had paid for the beer."
1466268,guidedfishing,2012-07-25 18:23:00,531,"Not sure it matters would not try it again. Brother and I crossed at Pembina a few years back, I cross regularly my brother hardly at all at that time. We were headed up for a moose hunt. So we knew we had long guns to check but I did not realize my bro had packaged up a case of the old mans home made wine and put it in the back. So the border guard asks us how much alcohol we have and my brother proudly announces a case of our old mans home made wine. The customs guy just smiled waved us up to check the rifles and never another word about the wine.... I would not try it again but we paid no duty on the 12 jugs of wine my brother brought along. Needless to say we were a big hit at moose camp. Nice job little brother. GF"
1466284,bigwalleye1,2012-07-25 19:02:00,2632,"Or some ""legal, labeled"" popcorn sutton legal tax paid stuff or some apple pie or cherry mixture made of legal liquor? I'd venture the legal stuff would be no different carried in it's separate elements and concocted in the bush, a quart of booze, a pint of flavoring. Why mix it at home and bring 3/4 of a quart of booze and a pint of mix in a quart bottle? Seems like you're only shorting yourself.... Now if you're talking the real Tennessee home brew sourmash, no tax paid, in a quart jar, revenooer-pursuin' real thing, the last thing I'd do is declare it, or maybe even leave it at home, but if a body's that determined, I don't think I'd be tellin ANYBODY about it, especially if you intend to enjoy it under the stars in a foreign land."
1465581,Aaron-IN,2012-07-24 09:59:00,500,Just wondering
1465590,SinOrSwim,2012-07-24 10:10:00,1528,I would highly doubt it but I bet there will be some very entertaining replies.
1465609,tv4fish,2012-07-24 11:06:00,2694,"Why the heck not? http://canadaonline.about.com/od/cus...holvisitor.htmOK --- Maybe you don't classify your ""moonshine"" as alcohol I don't think anything is mentioned in the regs. about whether you paid tax on your alcohol or not ??"
1465625,Aaron-IN,2012-07-24 11:41:00,500,"Heck, I know a lot of people who brew their own beer, make their own wine and of coarse make their own white lightening. In several states it's perfectly legal, as long as you aren't selling it and just use it for your own personal satisfaction. Guess I could always take an empty vodka bottle and fill it up and just declare it as a litre of alcohol."
1465635,tv4fish,2012-07-24 12:00:00,2694,"OR - You could get really ""sneaky"" and put it in a syrup bottle (or two) and not have to declare it or pay duty (Not that I know of anyone who ever did THAT)..................."
1465654,TIGHTLINER,2012-07-24 12:50:00,223,Here is the way I do it. I make my own cherry bounce I get vitamin water drink it and pour the bounce into the bottle and put it in with several other bottles that are about the same color seal them good. We took some apple moonshine up with us last year and they never looked in the cooler where it was looked just like the ice tea right next to it. You are going to get a lot of different ideas on this one I am sure.
1465673,wallydave,2012-07-24 13:37:00,2151,Just put it in a gas can tellem its octane booster!!
1465763,GOBIG,2012-07-24 17:09:00,126,"I TOOK APPLE PIE SHINE WHICH LOOKS LIKE ICE TEA. PUT IT INTO SEVERAL LIPTON ICE TEA BOTTLES. I SAW HOW THIS GUY MAKES IT AND WOW, IS IT GOOD. YOU SURE DO NOT NEED MUCH."
1465790,fishinnut 3446,2012-07-24 17:50:00,638,"GOBIG,I took the same thing this year but was in a 1.75L,opened it up at the Tues. night fish fry,it was all gone by the time we went to bedBut there was quite a few people taking pulls off of it."
1465836,Golden Eagle,2012-07-24 19:54:00,2642,Wonder if border cops accept online confessions?
