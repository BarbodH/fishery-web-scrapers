1468235,lakerbreaker,2012-07-30 17:27:00,253,We will be in the Morson area off and on for a week and looking for somewhere to go to get out of the sun for lunch or dinner a day or two. We will be coming off the lake so it has to be water access..any suggestions?

The dock is on the left, landing to right next to it, the dining room is on the right from the dock/landing. They will take orders, should not be necessary to give advance notice. The dining room overlooks the water, giving a great viewpoint of the lake. If you can't find the camp from the Morson site, post back, and I'll dig out a map when I have more time. Bill Krejca"
