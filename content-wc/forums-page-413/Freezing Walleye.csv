1468079,Ogoki,2012-07-30 10:55:00,291,"I freeze the fish in water so the lemon juice does not touch the meat until the end of thawing . Plus I don't use very much lemon juice either . I don't leave them in that long either for that very reason you stated . Some friends from church that I occasionally go the Canada always dip their fish in a solution of salt water and lemon juice , lay fillets on paper towels and then freeze . The paper towels are to remove excess liquid . I just put mine in a zip lock and slighlty cover with water ,freeze flat so they can be identified if checks by CO's . When I am at a camp with electricty I use my shrink wrapper . Works out fine . I even found a venison roast in my frrezer ,that somehow got by us and it was four years old . Unthawed and it looked fine and I baked it and it was good ."
1468108,octanehi5,2012-07-30 12:45:00,1104,"We filet the fish and leave the skin on, place the two pieces raw sides together, I put 8 filets in a bag this way, the skin not only help identfy the fish but also keeps it from freezer burn, cover with water and freeze. Call me when you thaw I will bring the beer batter"
1468110,tv4fish,2012-07-30 12:50:00,2694,"Yeah, that's my question, also. We're talking Walleyes here, not Northern Pike."
1468161,Bitinlight,2012-07-30 14:41:00,95,"Prior to vacuum sealing, I lay the fillets between two layers of paper towels, let them dry for a bit, and then pat off all the excess water or moisture that is there."
1467823,northsky99,2012-07-29 18:55:00,41,While at O'sullivan lake outfitters near Nakina last year one of the other guest there suggested putting lemon slices in a zip lock bag with your fish We did this a the fish came out great when thawed .Has anyone else done this and was wondering what the purpose of the lemon was ?I'am thinking it has something with the acid in the lemon eliminates the slim.Any thoughts?
1467866,Juls,2012-07-29 19:58:00,13414,What slime?When they are cleaned properly there is no slime. I freeze mine in water filled zip-loc bags. I set them on a cookie sheet in the freezer so they all freeze flat. That way they stack nicely and are more organized in the freezer. Freezing in water keeps them as fresh as the day you caught them.
1467926,Ogoki,2012-07-30 03:08:00,291,"Years ago a ""real good cook "" told me to unthaw fish is a mixture of lemon juice and salt water . Then rince real good prior to cooking . Could be just in my mind but I think the fish tastes better doing this. I also like to clean any fish I am going to freeze right away and not just let them die on a stringer ,to be cleaned later . Just some thoughts ."
1467937,Wyn,2012-07-30 05:50:00,112,I've done it a number of different ways but for fish like walleye and perch I think Juls method is just fine. We do the bags or vacuum seal.
1467951,steve.a,2012-07-30 06:43:00,274,When in Canada we will freeze them with the skin on in bags with some water. When thawed they will have some slim but it washes off easily.
1467959,Glenman12,2012-07-30 06:54:00,762,one of our guys brought up a device..its like a seal a meal but its the one that sucks all the air out..cant remember what its called though..one guy is hosting a fish fry at his house on Aug 26th so we wont know how it worked til then..
1467964,Bitinlight,2012-07-30 07:07:00,95,"A few years back, I started to seal all the fish I caught, plus any other wild game like venison in a vacuum sealer. Seems to work just great. We now take a vacuum sealer with us on Canadian trips and do one walleye with skin on in each bag. It freezes flat, stays fresh until it's eaten, and packs easily for the trip home, and also makes counting and identification easy if you run into a fish check. These packages also save on freezer room instead of having a bunch of bags with frozen water and fish in them."
1467993,Glenman12,2012-07-30 08:06:00,762,yeah thats it.. a vacuum sealer..dont know why I could think of that..glad to hear it works well..
1467999,Bill Krejca,2012-07-30 08:18:00,6107,"The folks at the O'Sullivans Rainbow camp who wrap, label, and freeze all cleaned fish for guests in camp use Saran Wrap first as a way of limiting air exposure, then place that in a plastic bag. I have thawed and cooked fish from there that were over a year old and the flesh was in excellent shape. I now follow the same procedure with other fish I catch and freeze. Bill Krejca"
1468003,SinOrSwim,2012-07-30 08:21:00,1528,wouldn't the lemon juice cook the fish?
