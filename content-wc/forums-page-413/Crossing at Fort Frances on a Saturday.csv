1468454,Gregking,2012-07-31 07:54:00,2658,Crossed last year at I falls and waited about 3 minutes on a sat. I ran 29 and crossed there this year and waited 3 minutes. Now coming home 5 years ago on 29 we waited 2.5 hrs but Winnipeg was coming into the U S to buy supplies. I think since our dollar is low there isn't as much traffic at the boarder. Well the Canada boarder i mean.
1468779,trapper_john,2012-07-31 18:32:00,83,We crossed at about 9:00 on a Sat morning the first week in July and was the second in line. The people were the finest kind and we sailed through.. More of a wait coming back.
1467842,DavKin,2012-07-29 19:27:00,104,"How long of a wait should I expect to cross the border in to Canada at Fort Frances on Saturday afternoon of Labor Day weekend, Sept. 1, 2012? Should we plan on over an hour?"
1467885,NARDA 1,2012-07-29 20:57:00,636,"My group quit crossing on Saturdays years ago because of the long wait, one year it was over 3 hours, That was enough for us. On Labor Day weekend you might catch a break because most families will not be going up because the kids are back in school. Later in the day might be better also but your guess is as good as mine. Maybe someone else who has crossed that weeked in the past will be able to provide more information. Good luck and have a great trip!!!!"
1467896,IA JOE,2012-07-29 21:37:00,35,We crossed on Saturday July 21st around 2 pm. It took about 10 minutes (including the wait on a train).
1467965,Bitinlight,2012-07-30 07:12:00,95,"This year we crossed on Saturday, June 9th shortly after noon coming home. We were the second vehicle in line, with no wait. Coming home in July on Sunday the 15th at about the same time of day, we waited about 10-15 minutes. No hassles. On both trips going in to Canada we entered on Monday shortly before noon with little or no wait and smooth sailing through customs."
1467973,tv4fish,2012-07-30 07:23:00,2694,"Don't think so -- Like a couple of the others -- we have gone through twice this year, both times going into Canada at I-Falls on a Saturday around noon. No longer than a 10 minute wait. The Canadian folks have ""speeded up"" the process. I think they can run up to 4-5 booths if they need to. But, I understand your concern -- years ago, it WAS a lot worse."
1468173,jambi,2012-07-30 15:06:00,504,"I've also crossed many Fort Frances on Labor Day Saturday about noon, wait has always been 10 minutes tops. Have a great trip!"
1468178,Fishin Fun,2012-07-30 15:18:00,218,Last year we cross on a Saturday in July at about 9am. Had to wait 5 minutes maybe.
1468351,2746,2012-07-30 21:36:00,3206,what others have said......Saturdays are no longer the hassel they once were. Many lodges out there that are friday to friday and more folks are going/coming on Fridays than might have been the case 5 - 10 years ago.
1468417,DanM57,2012-07-31 06:41:00,135,Check out this website. It let's you know what is waiting for you when you get to the border crossing. Have a good trip. Dan Mhttp://www.ezbordercrossing.com/list...ances/traffic/
1468448,Cash,2012-07-31 07:44:00,73,We crossed on Sat 6/16 at about 3pm and it took 10-15 min. Coming back to the US the following Sat at 10am was about 30 min wait.
