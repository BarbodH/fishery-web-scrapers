It's not a walleye vid, but a pike vid.The camp is looking GREAT and the Fish'N Canada boys were up there shooting an episode too!. Pete and Angelo are great guys. Bravo Ed!The vid says it all, we had all kinds of weather and the water was high, but that just added to the adventure.Here's a video of my good pal James catching a big Attawapiskat pike.Thanks again to Eddie North's for a great trip, we'll be back next year for sure!! Enjoy!http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpS41...feature=relmfu"

The bit of flopping on the floor is to be avoided, but not always the way it works. I'm sure that fish was fine. Good job of trying your best to do a good release. Practise makes perfect."
