You're absolutely right about the beer. The quality is great. Unpasteurized beer... unlike U.S. beers. Preservatives aren't ever going to be flavor ""enhancing""... at least not in a positive way."
1195655,v-bay gord,2010-05-01 20:40:00,3168,"American potatoes are no better than Canadian potatoes.....now, if you buy them from a small store and you find they are half rotten that is not because of the potatoes. It is more a fact of how quickly the produce turns over in a small store. The price difference is mainly due to the size of the market area...if you are shopping at big store in Mpls. vs shopping at the Co-op in VBay, yes, the price will be way higher. I have often shopped at a Byerlys store in Mpls and found the produce to be way more expensive than a bigger store in Dryden."
1195809,Guest,2010-05-02 10:06:00,0,"The last few years we have purchased our spuds from the Safeway in FF. The bag the spuds come in have said ""product of USA' go figure."
1195949,Golden Eagle,2010-05-02 17:38:00,2642,Got me one of those Canadian Safeway cards to get discount groceries. Use it every time I head north. I'm a regular at the stores in Fort Frances and Dryden.I still have to ask a local to help me pick out the best bacon.
1196094,camp chef,2010-05-03 07:40:00,915,"You are right I stand corrected.I am sure Canada grows great potatoes. We can get everything else we need in Nestor Falls with one stop.The potatoes have always been less than fresh. . I am sure it due to the fact that they don't turn very quickly,especially in mid May."
1194977,crazydog,2010-04-29 22:02:00,12,"Is it true, we can now take our own home grown potatosacross the border?Jeez pretty soon I 'll be able to take my wife... oopsif she reads this she'll think she's be able to go..sorry hun you need a passport to get back in."
1194987,JayM5209,2010-04-29 22:39:00,1050,"My understanding is that you can now take ""commercially packaged"" potatoes. That precludes any home grown. Also, I'd take a 5 or 10 lb. bag from the produce dept., not a plastic sack full that I filled up from the bulk bin. Or, our option is several bags of different kinds of frozen spuds for the 1st day or two, then rice to make a nice pilaf, boxes of potatoes au gratin, pasta for one meal, . . . .dang, there just aren't enough meals in a week for all the options."
1195472,Guest,2010-05-01 10:06:00,0,"What is the deal with people asking about potatoes? I am not trying to sound rude, I just do not get it.. are US potatoes any better then ours? why not just pick up you're needed perishables up here? I mean you are going to make stops for beer, liquor, bait and licenses anyways... why not add a bag of spuds to you're shopping list? am I missing something? G"
1195480,celticbass1,2010-05-01 11:06:00,67,"We pack all of our groceries in sealed containers, usually at the bottom of all of our clothing, tackle, and fishing gear so if we are asked if we have potatoes we are honest and have to unpack everything and pull them out. Also when we arrive in Canada we don't make many stops and they are never at grocery stores. We stop and get gas and usually stop and get one meal, then by the time we arrive at our destination it's usually pretty late so stores are closed. We do our trip into and through Canada in one day. And for the record, NO our potatoes are not better than yours. Your beer is better than ours but it costs twice as much."
1195481,Obabikon,2010-05-01 11:14:00,2370,Groceries probably run on average 30% higher in Ontario than in Minnesota. At a time when people are trying to save money and gas prices are getting high again... that's a spot that they can easily save money.
1195483,camp chef,2010-05-01 11:21:00,915,"Yes,the potatoes are that much better.At least where we stop on the way up to minaki. We do buy all our bread,eggs lettuce etc. in Canada as well as beer and don't mind spending a little extra to help out the local economy,but we haven't had any luck finding decent potatoes."
1195555,oleJoe,2010-05-01 16:25:00,114,"when you are saying commercially package potatoes, does that mean raw potatoes also or just canned or frozen packaged. All they ever take is raw potatoes at the border anyway. But you are right as to the potatoes aren't very good. Stopped last year got 10# flew in and some were rotten. Just had to eat more fish."
1195568,hogridnfool,2010-05-01 17:08:00,349,"Various things are banned from time to time because of diseases or insects. Items like Beef (Mad Cow Disease), Chicken (Newcastle Disease), Potatoes (Blight ) or Night crawlers in dirt. Once these things are bought under control or eradicated the bans are usually lifted."
1195601,brwhite,2010-05-01 18:45:00,41,".1) we don't stop to get bait2) we already have our licenses through the mail3) we get gas right before crossing and don't need more till we head back.4) ok, you got me on the beer! the case doesn't cut it! Now if you'd just sell beer and potatoes in the same place...it's basically one less stop that eats up 15-20 minutes out of fishing when we first get there!"
1195607,Guest,2010-05-01 19:18:00,0,"I did not know there was a difference in potatoes, good to know thanks! I also know there are controls put in place to prevent disease etc, and this is why certain items are not allow to cross boarders. I have seen the topic on potatoes many times here, so I figured I would stick my neck out and ask why. Our beer is expensive, I am a beer drinker. But I also find our ""quality"" or taste to be better then the many American beers I have consumed over the years. Alot of our pricing is taxes, a sin tax so to speak. I can understand trying to save a buck, and that is a very valid point. But what does a 10lb bag of spuds cost in the US? I can get a bag for 2.99 here for your basic yellow fleshed or white potatoes. Russets cost a bit more for what ever reason. thanks for all the replies to my question, G."
