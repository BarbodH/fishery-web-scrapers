1195981,Jeff Jones,2010-05-02 19:25:00,49,"I want to order a couple of new rods (1 casting and 1 spinning) for our trip to Rainy Lake. What length and action do you recommend? My choices are St. Croix Mojo bass and the Bass Pro Shops Carbon Lite. I was leaning toward a 7 ft medium action spinning and either a 6'6"" or 7' bait casting. Did not know if I should get a medium or medium/heavy for the baitcaster. What do you all think?"
