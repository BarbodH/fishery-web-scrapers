There are somethings that I like to go ""cheap"" on and others that the money is worth it. Typically... I go cheap on rods but high price on steaks! If your trips to Canada you enjoy going cheap on... great. I've had some pretty cool, inexpensive trips in my life. I've also had some flat out amazing pricey trips.

1190097,Cut a deal,2010-04-16 04:52:00,38,"Tell you what hotshot I've stayed on Gullrock a number of times Savant area also .I've been on the float plane dock in Red Lake on a Sat. morning when it looks like O'Hare.I've watched the Indians sniffing gasoline in front of the Saan store in Red Lake .I've golfed Balmertown and Ear Falls with the bears and even went in the Snake Pit in Red Lake for a beer but I've never been there right?It's a big country a your little lake is just one I want to see it all .I've been from the tip of Vancouver Island to Cape Race in Newfoundland to the top of the Dempster Highway in Yukon .Top of the world highway in Alaska to Chicken Alaska google it .Threw the Rockies on the Icefield Parkway to the top of almost every road in every province in Canada fish em all. There is a big cost dif between Plummers or arctic char in Quebec or a Norweigian cruise to Alaska .You can spend 20 grand for a group or 5 grand. I,m going to get a coffee and tell you how."
1190120,Cut a deal,2010-04-16 06:10:00,38,"Ok Newfoundland and Labrador Atlantic salmon -northerns -walleye. First if you live in the northeast States it's a easy drive to get there after that is another thing.Newfoundland ferries are subsidised by the government are reasonable plus it's a fantastic trip.You drive to Sydney Nova Scotia for the 4 hour ferry on the Joey and Clara Smallwood a huge ship.While your crossing the St. Lawrence you see pilot whales and dolphin following the ship. When you get off in Port aux Basques in Newfoundland.Newfoundland is a big place there are many motels like Super 8 or Comfort Inn along the way at $90 a night .The place has thousands of rivers -lakes to fish there are some fishing towns everywhere and the people are beyond friendly and for a price at the docks you can try your hand at jigging for cod.I've never seen so many moose drive slow at night. Places like Gros Morne are amazing but don,t stay to much $$$ there drive in from Deer Lake they got motels.You can fish for salmon right beside the road in places. Now Labrador there is a ferry from St Barbe to Blanc Sablon about a hour and a half across Iceberg Alley yep icebergs in July.Pre book motels or hotels in Labrador there ain,t many places to stay maybe $120 a night Not Per Person.The road is 1000 km long unpaved gravel bring spare tires on the rim your some likely to need em.Gas is your big cost add at least a buck more a gallon.Lots of rivers with Atlantic salmon.About 400km up this amazing road you reach Cartwright for a 10 hour ferry to Happy Valley-Goose Bay.Another huge ship when it pulls out into the Atlantic Ocean you see huge whales breaching and more icebergs.When you reach Happy Valley -Goose Bay it's a full service town. There are only 3 places to stay from here in Labrador the other 2 are Churchill Falls with maybe the largest hydro station in the world and a nice hotel and Labrador city. In between lots of lodges for walleye and northerns pull up to one and cut a deal. From there it's back to Quebec with lots more places to fish and finally back to asphalt .You need 3 weeks at least.I guess you could go to one of these places for $5000 fly in but that's all you see. This is what happened to me we pre booked this hotel on a salmon stream in Jan, paid I think $120.This place was 300km from anywhere we drive in to check in . I see the rates it says Presidential suite I say what's that ? Guy goes George Bush Sr fished here. George Bush Sr has spent a lifetime fishing all over Canada not cutting a deal. Well what the heck give me the room at $200 a night. I cut no deal."

Thing people don't know is the cruise lines own all kinds of hotels all over Alaska and Yukon so when the ship arrives in Skagway they take you to these places cruise lines make all the money locals get nothing.Now getting there you fly to Anchorage or Whitehorse.Full fares can cost $$$$ for a group.If you have access to Star Alliance which is a whole bunch of airlines United -Air Canada on and on use your miles but you gotta do it early cause they only have so many discount seats allowed on each plane.Think you can book a year in advance.If not full fare flights might cost $1200 Air Canada Tango fares $500 book it a year out and scoop the cheap seats .Car rentals have deals also go for the compact not the 4x4 they will rape you .Get the full coverage broken windshields are the norm.Here is something most don't know call your insurance company at home tell em you want coverage for rental cars . It might add $50 a year to your coverage but your covered everywhere in North America .Places like Orlando you can rent a car for $20 a day but they charge $35 a day for insurance .Show em your insurance don't take any they will hate your guts when you get a car for $140 a week unlimited mileage.Hotels -motels Alaska -Yukon what we did was google the place picked spots about a 4 hour drive apart and booked em when it was still minus 40 up there got great rates from $60 to a $100 a night we had confirmation numbers everywhere.About 2 weeks out I start getting these calls from hotels offering me double my money back and all kinds of deals couldn't figure it out. We didn't take them cause we would have had no where to stay.When we checked in we got it the hotels were all owned by the cruise lines and they were charging there guests maybe $500 a day per person for these excursions but had no where to put them to bad they had my full deposit and I had confirmation number.It is a fantastic place with 24 hour daylight in the summer.As for fishing drop a rod in you will catch something .I caught grayling beside the highway. If your looking looking for a charter show up at the dock and cut a deal.Local ferry service in Alaska between islands is expensive ."
1190319,alanb,2010-04-16 15:46:00,56,"But they already do! As a suggestion, just head into a Walmart in Sunset Country, go over to the electronics section and pick up an XBox 360, a fishing game, and the electronic fishing rod and your all set. Just think, no yucky bait, no snags on rocks, and you can drink beer while you fish. And if you want a flying adventure - just get a flight simulator. Think of the money you'll save in the long run. And head over to the freezer case and get a box of frozen fish sticks. They ALMOST taste like a shore lunch. What am I thinking? You wouldn't pay full price - you shop on E-Bay to find a deal. Seriously, I got to harass you. Your rants, while impressive, could be improved with the use of some white space. Alan"

If the conviction was long ago, you might contact the U.S. Embassy, Office of Consular Affairs in your country to obtain a waiver. Other misdemeanors may result in denial if they were recent."

1192283,jigman2003,2010-04-22 17:25:00,15,"I don't have a problem with that. Since they are automatically felons in their country, I would imagine that creates a few border crossing issues. Maybe not, don't know for sure. Bottom line is that most countries in the world take a dim view on folks putting other people's lives at risk due to bad decision making. We are just behind everyone else in that respect. Our ""rights"" (don't see how driving under the influence is a right) tend to focus on the individual rather than the group as a whole (the innocent citizens). Pretty much the same reason why some convicted (and admittedly guilty) guy gets off for a technicality."
1193412,warrior2090,2010-04-26 06:42:00,12,"As a matter of fact, it does not. The US does not prevent entry of Canadian citizens with a OWI conviction."
1193520,jigman2003,2010-04-26 13:35:00,15,Could you point me to that info? I've looked at a number of places with rules/regs regarding convicted felons entering the US and have not been able to find any hard and fast rules.
1193539,Obabikon,2010-04-26 14:28:00,2370,"I think the real reason is that countries don't care what other countries consider ""felonies"". They only care what THEY consider ""felonies"". I mean, should the US keep a woman from visiting from Iran because she refused to be forced into marrage? (not looking to start a topic on this... just pointing it out) It's much easier to just keep track of what your country considers a felony, versus what everyone else does."
1193626,scotttheguide,2010-04-26 17:08:00,73,"The problem is not the Canadian Laws,they are right to keep convicted fellons out there country. Its the US Laws setting the tolerances so low that you cant even go out and have a couple of beers with the guys or you are taking a chance of blowing .08 or 05 whatever it is.I dont drink when i go out anymore at all. Cops are to quick to arrest people for that. It might as well be prohabition. Now a days with everyone having a cell phone drivers can spot a really drunk driver. Call it in, and arrest the person if they are driving that intoxicated that they really can't control there vehicle or boat. Put stiffer fines on the establishments over serving the patrons.But setting up road blocks outside of drinking establishments is like handing out speeding tickets at the Daytona 500.And it has taken down allot of good people who would normally be spending there vacation dollars in Canada.Just my opinion."
1194106,NP4ME,2010-04-27 21:27:00,378,"Joe and Scott, I sure hope your posts were a joke. Drinking and driving is completely unacceptable...whether it is one beer or 10. ANY amount of alcohol in your system has an impact on motor functions. I bet nearly everyone on WC has been affected by a drunk driver in one way or another. I have been hit by a drunk driver. My cousin was killed by a drunk driver. A good friend just died about a month ago in a DWI crash. Luckily, he was the only one who perished and did not kill any innocent bystanders. The thing about DWI, it is COMPLETELY avoidable. If you are going to drink, don't drive. I appreciate the Canadian regulations and I also appreciate those darn cops you speak of. The ones that pick on and harass those poor college students that choose to drink and get behind the wheel. NP"

1191081,Bigfishhunter,2010-04-19 06:49:00,803,"Going back to comparing the fishing lodge industry to cruise ships, hotels, and airline, it really is not possible to compare the two, for all the reasons that Obabikon has already stated. (brand loyalty of customers, lodge loyalty to repeat guests, etc, etc.) One thing to remember is that you are solely dependent on your reputation, word of mouth is powerful, especially with the internet. ONe thing we used to do at my former lodge was recommend those travelers who liked to try different camps to camps we knew would treat them well. We viewed it as us still taking care of them. The idea was that they would remember the gesture and return to us later. Also that other good camps would recommend us to their loyal customers looking for a change. It works. Now, I worked in this industry for 7 years, first as a guide, and then as a camp manager. I worked for a few different companies as a guide, jumping around the country for various hunting and fishing seasons. Loved every minute of it. When I was very new and young, we had a couple of ""pro fisherman T.V. personalities"" come up. I was super pumped when my boss put me as their guide. I thought, man he must really think something of my skills. Turns out they were sent up by Travel Manitoba, which is a government initiative, who sent these guys to promote manitoba travel. I don't think my boss was getting anything for them being up there, and I later found out from one of the older guides, he didn't want to waste one of his top experienced guides on someone who would never come back to his lodge as a paying customer. The ""pro's"" turned out to be real ""pro a- holes"". I had a miserable week, they treated me like garbage and didn't tip me, even though we caught great fish, and I worked my but off making stellar shore lunches, and taking them out every evening after a full day of fishing etc. Lesson learned by me about business, treat your customers with respect. My boss would give people great discounts for their fifth consecutive trip. Or, he would give a 10% discount to the person who was the ""trip leader/organizer"" for each person he or she brought with them. Another thing was to offer early booking incentives. These all keep returning guests happy and coming back. Sorry for the long post, just thought I would share that experience with y'all eh!."

This spring my usual group of 6 is down to 2 and my September trip looks like 0. A big reason for the decline has been loss of group members due to previous OWI convictions in the last 10 years. It seems our govement sees fit to share misdemeanor arrest convictions with Canada. Last fall, one of our group was charged $200.00 for a 7 day visa since he had a OWI conviction 8 years ago. He has been going for 35 years and said he will never go back, We have another guy that had a conviction 12 years ago and paid the money twice to get in and has said the same thing, no more. It is interesting that the US does not treat Canadians coming into the US the way. They can have a OWI convicition and pass our borders without problem.Ontario needs to decide if it want dollars from US sportsman or not. In all my trips, my groups have followed the law and been good citizens while traveling in Canada. We have never driven past a disabled motorist, have assisted in two medical transportations from our camp and in general have been an asset to our host country. This May might be my last trip."

Obabikon........would come to your camp in a minute if I was fishing LOTW. You rock. I generally log on to this site to read information not to read a travelogue of someone who apparently likes himself a lot.
1190440,Cut a deal,2010-04-17 06:12:00,38,"Maybe. This topic was started with ""Well, resort owners are apprehensive about the upcoming season"". My question was why is there no place on here to find last minute deals to fill. Some owners have given very good reasons why not.I have been enjoying reading this forum for years. I greatly admire the passion and loyalty these fisherman show to lodges .I get it ok it's not for me I like to see it all.Northernwestern Ontario is a special place for fishing and beauty .Resort owners like Obakikon are hard working people who look after their clients. I have never had a bad trip to sunset country. I wish they were all full they deserve it.Sportsman shows used to be the way to get information not any more the one in my town ain't the same.The internet gives you what you need.Now if you think this is a travelogue which it ain't ignore and move on there are lots of topics . There are lots of fisherman who would love to go places but have a limited budget.I know how I do it and it works.Stop wasting bandwidth with your petty criticism and ignore it.Saw something a while ago they were saying Iceland is the place to go to cut a deal .The country is bankrupt the fishing is great flights are cheap. With that volcano spewing out ash all over Europe they are probably giving fishing vacations away."
1188960,Obabikon,2010-04-12 22:00:00,2370,"I agree with you there v-bay. You can't risk losing a yearly paying customer for a one shot cheap trip. Again, I'm not saying deals don't happen... I'm just saying that that particular deal is not one I am willing to do."
1189058,v-bay gord,2010-04-13 07:54:00,3168,Deals do happen. Most camps offer incentives and discounts. These are usually up front and not a back door deal. It is the back door deal that I was referring to..........it is not a win-win situation like the original poster was implying.
1189286,Cut a deal,2010-04-13 17:03:00,38,"That is not what I was implying at all.Sure not hard to tell owners from the customers.Why would you want to cut a deal this far out if you think you can fill ?Market demand dictates price.If your 90 % full you got it right ,if your 40% full something is off maybe the economy maybe the price maybe the fishing sucks? Last minute deals are everywhere.Hotels -Flights -Cruises -Vegas -Florida.If you booked months in advance you should be paying top dollar it's all set.What about last minute cancellations you could fill those with a deal. There is no way someone sitting next to you on a plane is paying the same rate .Hotels also it's everywhere. Short term booking flexibility fills empty spaces and make good business sense..I don't sit down on a plane and turn to the guy next to me and say ""hey what did you pay"".It is none of their business. There is nothing like fishing Canada but some things are way off. Explain this to me cause I just checked First Air flight Winnipeg to Rankin Inlet 2 hour fight costs about the same as a Air Canada tango fare 24 hour flight to Australia?"
1189358,2746,2010-04-13 20:31:00,3206,"I retired a few years ago from a service business (not a camp owner) and one of the things I learned early on was to price my service/product to be competitive and generate a reasonable profit. Then I worked my butt off providing the quality of service that brought clients back. Every once in a while ""cut a deal"" would come by and I'd happily send him on to the competition. You don't survive, much less prosper, in any business catering to those folks."
1189370,Obabikon,2010-04-13 20:54:00,2370,"Cut a deal... I understand exactly what you're saying. It'd make perfect sense on paper... It makes sense for Hotels, Cruises and Airlines even Vegas... those are companies that don't really rely on customer loyalty. Most Canadian resorts do rely on having loyal returning customers. Our line of business is very personal. We become friends with many of our guests. Honest service and loyalty keep our guests coming back. While there are people out there that try new places every year (and that's awesome), for the most part, yearly customers go the same places. If another camp wants to try to cut a last minute deal for a quick buck... that's fine with me. I just don't want to do it. Hotels - Nobody cares if it's a Holiday Inn or an Americ Inn... hotels are hotels. Very little personal contact with chain hotels. If you've been on one cruise ship, you've been on them all. While the more you pay the nicer it is... there isn't brand loyalty Very few people out there say... I only fly North West or I only fly American... they look at price Also, Cut, you're a product of a ""cut deal"". And, even now... years later, you would prefer not to spend the money. Everyone is the same way. They would prefer to have the same trip for cheaper. I can't blame them, but it's a cycle that is tough to break. If you do get that price one year, and it doubles the next year... you're not coming back. All that said, yes, a couple of us are lodge owners. But, I'm pretty sure your original post was directed towards lodge owners. I don't mean to sound pompus... but I do have a degree in Business Administration with an area in Business Management. It's not like I haven't looked at the best ways to earn money. The difference is... I'd rather earn $5 for the next 10 years than $7 this year and $3 the next 9. (it'd cost me $16 in the long haul) Anyhow... it's a good discussion. The idea might work for some camps... just probably not mine. (or V-Bay's)"
1189388,Moondog,2010-04-13 22:46:00,362,"OBABIKON......... I completely agree with you. When people go to a place and have a life experience it becomes very personal. If you get pimped then the trust is gone. I can't think of a place that I would go if I knew that the lodge owner placed my loyalty above making a few bucks. I ran a business for many years and if I treated my clients like a commodity, I never would be retired now and enjoying time fishing in Canada."
1189797,Kevin R,2010-04-15 06:54:00,305,If the camp is not filled its not a bad thing some weeks are busy others are slow & that slow time keeps camp owers busy do things they may have put off. Now if the camp is not making money it needs to make changes that is up to them if they need raise or lower prices. To just cut a deal I dont think it would work well as most camps have repeat customers that would have been more entitled to a deal than some last minute customer.
1189831,alanb,2010-04-15 08:49:00,56,"Obabikon- Well said. As soon as you turn a value-added business into a commodity your heading down a dead end road. It's a two way street also. What do you give up as a customer dealing with someone who's willing to cut a deal at a lower profit margin just to get the business? I keep this posted on my wall in my business: Looking for value? It's unwise to pay too much but it's unwise to pay too little. When you pay too much you lose a little money, that is all. When you pay too little, you sometimes lose everything, because the thing you bought was incapable of doing the thing you bought it to do. The common law of business balance prohibits paying a little and getting a lot. It can't be done. If you deal with the lowest bidder, it's well to add something for the risk you run. And if you do that, you will have enough to pay for something better! John Ruskin (1819-1900) Cut a deal is probably one of those people who will jump over a dollar to pick up a penny. Alan"

Listen I'm going to change locations for a bit might help some fisherman who want to catch some big walleye for a good price.Tobin Lake you the home of those 16 lb eyes.First it's a drive to on black top all the way it,s farm country and it,s ugly not like northern Ontario which is beautiful. Now it's near Nipawin Saskatchewan which is right on the river to the lake .They got motels you know the kind you pile 4 guys into a room for $80.Also right under the bridge in Nipawin there is a boat rental by the day or hour and it's reasonable .Couple bars in town good food good music .But it all comes down to fishing your going be on the lake catching monsters for 12 hours a day so who cares about where your staying.For about $60 a day for 4 guys you can pull this off.If you go there and pay lodge rates your wasting your money.Hey Alan I,m waiting for the day Walmart opens a chain of fly in fishing lodges in Sunset country and offers red tag specials. Oh by the way I've done Alaska -Yukon and Labrador-Newfoundland fishing on cut a deal in the last 6 years also but I'll save that for next time."
1186745,Obabikon,2010-04-07 07:05:00,2370,"Speckeye, There's a lot of us out there. And, several of us post on here regularly. The way I look at it is this... I love our area, and I want to share it with as many people as I can. A lot of people look at tourists as an inconvenience... I just look at it as proof that we get to live in an amazing spot!"
1186839,KevinSB,2010-04-07 10:40:00,73,"Hopefully to add a bit of cheer, I wanted to share that a buddy and I will be taking our first Canadian trip this year, and I suspect if we have a good time can talk one or two wait-and-see buddies into coming in 2011.We're from Central Illinois and have migrated the annual fishing trip from IL to WI and fished WI for about three years. After a so-so 2009 WI outing, we decided to bite the bullet and make it to Canada this year.So we've planned ahead since last summer and been blessed enough for job stability to let us go as planned. We found our place (Steve and Andrea at Tall Pines on Wabaskang) at the Madison fishing show and are looking forward to heading up there June 12. I feel fortunate for there to be so many good locations and owners to choose from, and we feel good about our choice.Blessings to all the owners and others who depend on the fishing industry for their livelihood, as well as to those WC members struggling financially during these tough times.So just wanting to point out that 2010 will bring some first-timers up north!"
1186856,camp chef,2010-04-07 11:33:00,915,"You won't be disappointed with the fishing,the scenery or the people.I live in Wisconsin and don't consider what we have to offer real fishing.....It just fills up the time in between trips to Canada"
1186873,Peffley'sCamp,2010-04-07 12:06:00,37,"Kevin,As Camp Chef said you will not be disappointed in the fishing, scenery or the people in Canada. I think you will also be pleased with your choice of lake (Wabaskang) and camp (Tall Pines). Been fishing Wabby for almost 20 years as both a guest and camp owner, I think you will be happy with your choice.Have a great trip and be forewarned-fishing Canada (the entire experience, not JUST the fishing) can get in your blood....but the good new is: It's a ""disease"" you can live with!"
1186916,KevinSB,2010-04-07 14:10:00,73,"Thanks, guys. Looking forward to a great experience, including great fishing. Seems clear that there are many great lakes and great resorts to enjoy. Guessing it'll be the first of many trips!Kevin"
1187095,Tonyo,2010-04-07 21:13:00,212,Larrym I was wondering if I would ever run into you at 5 Lakes. We will be in #8 with 9 guys and 3 boats. We will have to get together and have a couple of adult beverages together and shoot the bull. Look forward to meeting you. We will be in camp by noon or so.
1188465,Cut a deal,2010-04-11 18:29:00,38,Hello I just joined but a have enjoyed following this forum for years . I got a question . Why doesn't this forum have a last minute club or something like sell of vacations .com ?Here's the problem I can't afford to take the family on one of these trips .Stuff like mortgage -college -bills come first.In my younger years we would head up toward Savant Lake or Red Lake areas with no where to stay and cut a deal.Don't want to say the lodges because the owners said not to tell the rate I was getting to the others guests.Well I'm too old for that stuff anymore.But if I owned a lodge and had openings and people were flexible on short term notice maybe couple days why not fill the cabins something is better than nothing no ?
1188496,Obabikon,2010-04-11 19:59:00,2370,"That's one view. However, I have a TON of regular guests... the practice of this would upset them. While I'm not saying ""deals"" don't occure... I'd rather give people a big break for booking in advance than for waiting until the last minute. So, it makes sense, but in the long run... it has the potential to be a HUGE problem."
1188524,v-bay gord,2010-04-11 21:31:00,3168,I agree with Obabikon. Why would I cut deals behind the backs of my regular guests.....and my other guests who are paying the going rate? The future of any business is in repeat clientel. So I get you to come once for a cheap deal......when you want to come back you still want the same cheap deal. There is no future in that for me. Chances are the lodges that are doing those deals are not going to have the same ownership down the road.......or be there at all.
1188572,2746,2010-04-12 06:33:00,3206,"I've since had a pm from John B.O.A.T. and realize I misunderstood your dates. Turns out we'll be there a week before you. Shoot, I was looking forward to putting a face with some of the good folks on WC. Maybe next year!"
1186208,Ogoki,2010-04-05 20:23:00,291,"Hey Jigman 2003 I guess we are thinking alike . Add a little to the cost of a fly-in and I can take a Manitoba bear hunt. Which is what we are doing this year instead of fishing . Really big bears up there and the deer hunting is making my mouth water too. After 33 fly-in trips I need to do something a little different . However we are thinking for NEXT YEAR of taking our canoe and Ogoki the lab and flying to Whitewater , from there we will go thru Whiteclay and end up at Ogoki .We did that a few years ago also . Camp ,fish and canoe . Will probably stay at Ogoki a few days and fish out of a boat too. Two bear hunts this year- spring and fall."
1186239,Tonyo,2010-04-05 21:51:00,212,"Pooch I agree. I have been a member on here for several years and can say my time on Walleye Central greatly increases this time of year. I check the board a couple of times a day to see what has been posted and read through the replies. I rarely reply, simply because I can't add a whole lot to the topics that already hasn't been said, but I still ""lurck"" in the background reading many if not all subject matter to pass the time waiting for the day we leave to go to Gullrock, May 28. This board is one of the best if not the best for information on Canadian walleye fishing and the hundreds of great outfitters that we all go to. If there is a place anyone wants to visit all they have to do is ask the question. Good luck to everyone headed north. Tonyo"
1186351,2746,2010-04-06 08:24:00,3206,"Tonyo, we will be there the same week, staying at 5 lakes lodge. Would be fun to see another WC follower."
1186356,SoulFulCry,2010-04-06 08:28:00,158,lol i to spend a great amount of time on here reading articles looking at boats n seeing where all u are goin to for ur fishing yr im lucky i get to fish on red lake all the time i live here so i spend a ton of open water time on the lake lol hope to see ya all around have a great trip[
1186564,lcwhit,2010-04-06 17:00:00,104,we got our car tossed last year for no apparent reason. very humiliating. i don't know if my group is ever going back.
1186590,Golden Eagle,2010-04-06 18:07:00,2642,I don't understand. Please explain.
1186609,prov1900,2010-04-06 18:54:00,544,"We got our truck ""tossed"" a couple of years ago on the US side. I was so humiliated that I didn't want to return back to Nebraska. I wanted to go back to Canada and fish out my days.... On a serious note, the Canucks and the US can toss my truck anytime. I will thank them for their dedication to border security so we can continue to travel back and forth for the purpose of fishing."
1186657,Moondog,2010-04-06 20:20:00,362,WOW.....pretty thin skin. So were people watching that you wanted to impress?? They can toss anything I own anytime.......would hope our US Customs would do the same.
1186664,Obabikon,2010-04-06 20:44:00,2370,"If getting checked at a border crossing is humiliating... then my self confidence just dropped a TON. I've been checked a TON of times... it's just people doing their job. You can accept it, and look at it as part of life. Or, you can get upset by it... and let it ruin a great trip."
1186729,speckeye,2010-04-07 06:37:00,61,"I'm headed to Garden Island for my first Ontario trip last week of May.I'm sure the people there will treat us better than Pitt River Lodge in BC did a few years back,and I'm also confident they will provide the service promised-and I will enjoy access to fish,which was attenuated at the BC operation.I have money earmarked for fishing travel,and I will be looking to further my Canadian choices this year.Realize that I am out here to be wooed for business.Never treat your guests as if they are expendable,as the Pitt River folks did in 2004.I live/fish in a famous tourist destination,and we treat the summer tourists like gold,a large number of whom are Canadians.I look forward to meeting a Canada which will return that favor!!!!"
1185648,campchick,2010-04-04 10:53:00,96,"Well, resort owners are apprehensive about the upcoming season. If you ask any one of us you'd get the same answer - we have empty cabins to fill. If things change and you can make a fishing trip on short notice, someone can accommodate your party. Looks like the ice will be out early everywhere so dust off the old tackle box and start phoning your buddies! Hope to see you in Canada!"
1185687,Larry Mac,2010-04-04 14:32:00,530,"If you are as passionate about Canadian Wilderness Fishing as I am then IMHO there is no better value than a Canadian Fishing Adventure. There are so many different options to suit all kinds of needs. This is World Class Freshwater Fishing at its finest. I have been fortunate to fish many different states and I have yet to experience the fishing and ambiance that I get in the Canada Wilderness. IMHO it is the best value out there for truly World Class Freshwater Fishing. Granted I have not fished Alaska as of yet as it is still out of my price range and still on my Bucket List. Have a great 2010 season.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1185693,Fishing Traveler,2010-04-04 14:50:00,19,"From what I am hearing, I think this season will be a tough one again for many lodges. It would take a lot for me not to make the annual trip but not every one is as diehard and others have not been as fortunate with the current economy. Here's hoping that the economy turns around sooner rather than later and that lodges will be again be full providing lifetime memories for fishermen everywhere. Chris Fishing Traveler"
1185749,Obabikon,2010-04-04 18:35:00,2370,"Without a doubt, people are aprehensive about spending their money. It'll probably take a few years to get things back to normal. Even if things start to improve, many people will feel nervous about spending (and not saving). Anyhow... just my two cents. Eventually things will improve... but not for a while."
1185765,Kevin R,2010-04-04 19:29:00,305,I have thought that last season was so cold some may be waiting to see if things warm up before heading north. Ice went out late & snow was falling in June in 2009 along with some nasty tornados.
1185805,Pooch,2010-04-04 22:03:00,4619,"Most years about this time of year the Canada board gets ""chatty"". This year seems to be a little different. Perhaps there are now so many long time folks on WC that most everyone's questions have been answered many times over.About any question we have can be answered by searching the archives. You see basically the same thing happen with magazines that specialize in one area of interest. There is a maturing and more knowledgeable audience and subject matter. Basic fishing information doesn't change very quickly so how many times can we discuss jigging, trolling or anything else that most everyone does well now. Only when someone stumbles onto something new is it of interest to anyone else and worthy of an article.Maybe there are not as many new posts as usual, but look at the number of reads each post still receives. There are many ""lurkers"" out there soaking up information and sometimes sharing it.There is always something new to learn or re-learn. Just ask me about how my wife puts spinner rig color combination's together that I wouldn't be caught dead using and proceeds to kick the snot out me year after year. Pooch"
1185845,Peffley'sCamp,2010-04-05 05:40:00,37,"From the very beginning of this economic downturn, I have been saying that this recovery will be a process that will take years. The US (and related global markets) didn't get in this mess overnight and we certainly are not going to see an overnight recovery. For those that have lost jobs and who hopefully have now been re-employed, the economic ""lag"" is still there. Bills in arrears that need to be caught up on, nest-egg replenishment etc. For this part of the population, the discretionary income for a trip to Canada may still be a year or two down the road.In the meantime, we are all in this together so let's hope the recovery while gradual, is consistent and the trendline remains upward over time."
1185922,Walley Guide,2010-04-05 08:43:00,67,"Have to agree about less chatter on the board. I have always done more reading than posting. I plan to make two trips again this year. Without a doubt the number of folks traveling north is in a down turn. More than a couple of dozen folks i know have chosen to fish waters in the lower 48 this year. The traffic the last couple of years has been very light compared to previous years. One thing that is noticable is the amount of motels with vacancies on a Fri night. Doesn't matter if the price of gas hits $5 again, they close roads for construction we have to be re-routed 2 hours, they back up the border for 5 hours, pull us over and do a search on the truck & boat, unpack our bags to include unrolling our socks, to some of us the cost of a fishing trip to Canada is still and will always be ""priceless"" ......... Good Fishin' Walley"
1186116,Guest,2010-04-05 17:12:00,0,"I didn't think I'd ever post that I'm not going to Canada as long as I was of sound mind and body. That said, this year I think I'm staying home. I could latch on with a couple groups but don't think I will. I love Canada and Canadian fishing - second to none IMHO. I haven't lost my job and am not in danger of doing so. Just going to take a break this year I guess. Perhaps start saving my money for some hunting trips instead."
1186197,Nimstug,2010-04-05 20:04:00,2605,"I have been out of work since November and am still owed over two months of salary, but I am going this year. There is no justification, except perhaps to spend some time with my son. NimstugSupport the right to keep and arm bears!"
