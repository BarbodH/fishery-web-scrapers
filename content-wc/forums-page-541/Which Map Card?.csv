1196324,Hawker,2010-05-03 16:48:00,3967,"OK, I've got a Navionics HotMaps Premium Canada SD/PREM-C2, Apr 2006 map card I've been using since 07' when I go to Canada. I almost exclusively fish Stevens Bay which is part of or adjacent to Sabaskong Bay if I'm not totally confused. My question: Is there a newer, more detailed map card that someone can recommend? I've updated my electronics, will be running a Lowrance HDS-10, so I'd like to figure out which card for that area I need with the most detail available!Thanks in advance for your help/advice!"
1196706,Guest,2010-05-04 17:16:00,0,I don't think the old Canada chips have LOTW's in detail. I use the Navionics chart US647XL. The 2008 Canada chip has some of the LOTW's on it.

Thereby the April 2006 chip would mimic the map. Perhaps there are updates to the Canada map that might be included in later date chips.I've fished the Sabaskong, Stevens, Miles, Obabakon, Little Traverse and other areas using the April 2006 chip. Note: The Jan. 2006 chip had serious flaws in it--it did not always show blue indicating shallow water which is vital to pick up those isolated rocks.If I wanted more detail on the maps I would look into the latest LakeMaster high definition charts. I understand that a significant part of LOW has recently been on-the-water remapped with the result of much more detail.Link: http://www.lakemap.com/digitalgpslak...yversion3.aspx"
1196858,Hawker,2010-05-05 07:07:00,3967,"Thank You Bob888! I believe the Lakemaster card you linked to is exactly what I'm wanting/needing! The Navionics card I have and have been using does indeed have some serious flaws in it ie: not showing near enough detail and contour lines and hazards (rocks, shallows etc) and it looks as if the Lakemaster one will give me the detail I'm looking for! I appreciate the help, I've just now ordered it from Cabelas, it's in stock and will have it in plenty of time before heading north! Again, Thank You very much, it is greatly appreciated!"
