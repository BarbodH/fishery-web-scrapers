NW Ontario is in desperate need of some soaking rains already this season. If you are coming up early and like to fry fish for shore lunch, please plan to bring a cookstove unless conditions change and the ban is lifted."
1192535,Tbum,2010-04-23 14:30:00,12,perhaps a dumb question...is the use of charcoal prohibited?
1193442,Peffley'sCamp,2010-04-26 08:12:00,37,"Tbum,Actually it is permissable to use charcoal PROVIDED that it is used within a barbecue. You can use a portable grill unit that houses the charcoal and that would be acceptable. You CANNOT use the charcoal on the ground or in an existing fire pit (rock circle or other).Further the MNR cautions about the proper disposal of charcoal briquets when using them for a shore lunch. Do not (of course) ""dump"" them in the bush.... but like all other fires make sure they are extinguished DEAD OUT. Seems like common sense, but as I was told by the MNR you would be surprised by the number of fires started in this fashion."

1196209,Moondog,2010-05-03 12:01:00,362,That is great news........I was concerned about that fire ban since we enjoy a campfire nightly.
1196211,Moondog,2010-05-03 12:08:00,362,Please keep us updated on current fire restrictions........
