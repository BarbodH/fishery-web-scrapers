1197688,JDP,2010-05-07 10:15:00,1457,"The ""Outflow"" was 400 cubic meters per second (4 weeks ago) it was reduced to 100 cubic meters per second 2 weeks ago.Thus the ""Net Inflow"" has increased substantially.Perhaps it has rained as well...maybe a Lac Seul local can provide us that information."
1197734,Guest,2010-05-07 11:18:00,0,"Hey Guys, We have indeed finally had some rain this past week throughout much of NWO. The specific amount varied, depending on location. Water levels will go up, it's just a matter of time. Perhaps more interestingly is the temperature at the Ear Falls outflow....almost 50F before the rain; back down to mid- to upper-40's as a result of the rain. But will certainly start rising again in the absence of further precipitation. That is OUTFLOW temperature, not surface temperatures (which would be higher). Remember walleyes generally spawn in 42F-46F water. So temperatures will have scattered most large females from any post-spawn locations by the time opener arrives in a week, despite the fact the 15th is the earliest opener date possible (being regulated as 'third Saturday in May'). Fishing big pike in the shallow back bays (which typically is best when the main lake is still in the 40F's, protected sun-exposed areas in the low-50F's and those shallow back bays in the upper-50F's) is happening NOW! Pre-spawn bass fishing has been great the past few weeks for myself. NWO Fishing Bum"

1197926,bpetersen,2010-05-07 20:40:00,251,Thanks for the great information. I was wondering if the rain hadn't picked up.
