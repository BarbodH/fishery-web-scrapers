1196760,PRD1,2010-05-04 20:04:00,458,Nothing around MPLS I know of but north of the exit to Cloquet (before Duluth) there will be construction. Check this web site before your leave for the latest: http://hb.511mn.org/main.jsf
1196769,2746,2010-05-04 20:29:00,3206,Thanks! Looks like just what I needed.We go up on a Friday and it's always busy North of Minneapolis. Last year with construction it was close to impossible.....sat in a line not moving for 30 minutes. Didn't want to go through that again if we could avoid it.
