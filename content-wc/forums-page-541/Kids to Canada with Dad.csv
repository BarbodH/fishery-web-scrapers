1197215,Guest,2010-05-05 22:26:00,0,"Well, after talking to the kids (1 boy, 2 girls) - we may need to stay at a lake that we can drive to, having better amenities, and more to do for them other than just fishing. (they like to take our own boat and be able to swim and ""tube"" behind it when the fishing is slow) I had decided on a fly-in to a remote lake with a single cabin, but that may be a better trip for just my son and I someday. SO, can anyone help with referrals/recomemndations for a decent drive to boat-in lodge where we can still have good walleye and pike fishing plus a little more civilization for the girls?? Thanks for the help!"

One I like is on eagle lake, vermillion bay lodge. Nice cabins, beach, clear water and right near town with Dryden not far away. Also there is a island close by that has a nice beach and easy landing for your boat. Gord, the owner is first class, and will take good care of you and your family. Look up their website."

You may want to check out www.snakefalls.com - Drive to but good walleye and northern fishing - plus Rob can fly you guys out to one of his remote lakes for a one day outing. For non fishing, cabins are very nice, wi-fi, paddleboat, trampoline (always very popular), lodge with pool table and foosball - plus a basketball court/inline hockey surface. We've found a beautiful, large sandy beach not a far boatride from camp that we've always had to ourselves too. And there are a couple of waterfalls that you can get to up the rivers if you just want to do some boat ride exploring."

Fishing is very good for bass, northerns, walleyes and big crappies but the crappies can be hard to find that time of the year. Google them."
