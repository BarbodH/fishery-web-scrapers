1183284,Larry L,2010-03-28 23:54:00,335,"My brother drives up to Woolaston every year, usually in early June. He hauls his own boat and camper. They do quite well on pike up to about 30lbs. The fish the lake as well as the Geike River if they can get up it with hisjet boat. They camp near the mouth of the Geike. Sometimes they are a bit early and have to put up more ice than they would like to. In years past they would fly into Duncan Lake on the Geike. There they would alway catch pike in the 30 lb class. One June they caught two that topped 40 (lbs not inches). That operation has since closed. And he can't get his jet boat up that far."
1183635,Guest,2010-03-29 19:08:00,0,It's a 5 star lodge imo. Great food and accomodations. Owned by (or was ) some folks from lll When e were there they lived in Fla. and had (or have) a string of bbque resturants. One of the pilots (named Jim) was a real talent.
1196416,flasheye,2010-05-03 20:08:00,1,"I drive to wollaston lake nearly every year and I'm quite familiar with the things you should be considering about your trip. The weather in the north can be very unpredictable both for ice out and wind and rain. Most of the trips are set for 4 days fishing and quite possibly you could be froze out or blown of the main lake in June all four days. This would limit your fishing to the extent that you would be very disappointed. The up side is it is first class all the way and if the uncontrollable weather is in your favor the fishing is the best, fish over 40"" every day when you can get to them and yearly some at 50"". In my opinion for the money and the risk of bad weather I would definitely consider some other places that provide more sheltered water fishing on those bad days without expensive daily fly outs"
1196528,p0007,2010-05-04 08:31:00,78,"I would also consider Minor Bay Lodge on Wollaston Lake, they have a little better access to protected areas of the lake when it gets windy. Well beyond First Class accommodations and meals, the fishing is phenomenal, and this lake holds some absolute giants. All one needs to do is look at the trophy log on the downloads section of their website (its the newsletter they mail out once per year). Every year there are even a few 50 - 51"" pike, but many people get pike into the upper 40's which is nearly unheard of many other places. I think it may be a bit cheaper than Wollaston Lake Lodge, but I think they are both good places. I don't know that it is fair to compare a trip to Wollaston with a $1500 drive in camp, I think that those are great and do at least one per year, but this is a whole different experience. Nothing wrong with spoiling yourself once in awhile. I know I have seen Minor Bay featured on many fishing shows in the past few years also. The bonus is the lake trout, grayling, and even walleye that hardly anyone take advantage of because of the monster pike."
1180414,reconssd,2010-03-21 17:44:00,147,"I'm considering a trip to Wollaston. Is it worth it? It's a lot of money - are there better options and the bottom line is - is the fishing worth it? As always, your feedback is greatly appreciated. Tight lines and travel safe."
1180416,dutchboy,2010-03-21 17:55:00,5717,"I have never been there but the fishing for big Pike is suppose to be awesome!!Somebody can correct me if I'm wrong but I believe Wollaston is 100% catch & release. You aren't even allowed a trophy.That said, I am still going to go someday. It's on my ""bucket"" list. Just buy a good camera and have a blast."
1180447,celticbass1,2010-03-21 19:30:00,67,"I'm going June 29, this year. I personally would never go to a place like this if I was paying for it. 1. I couldn't afford it. 2. If I could afford it I would rather go on three $1500 fishing trips rather than one $4500.00 trip. 3. You have to have a guide with you every day, although you can take your own smaller rig out after the days fishing if you like and the guide lands, handles, and releases all fish. All that said, my brother is paying for the trip and I'm really excited about it. It's going to be a different kind of trip than I've ever had with the chance to catch some huge pike. I guarantee the food will be better than my normal food while I'm in Canada. The trip itself sounds and looks interesting, and it's always fun to try out new things. So if you wait about three months and ask again, I'll let you know if I think it's worth it."
1180644,Guest,2010-03-22 12:09:00,0,"I think Wollaston would be a great place to go, but if you're looking for the same type of service and quality, at a better price, check out Tetu Island Lodge in Ontario. Excellent place with monster pike."
1180646,Kruger,2010-03-22 12:19:00,259,Or Kesagami Lake Lodge.
1180761,BenBeattie,2010-03-22 18:00:00,232,"I know some guys who planned a trip there. They were true trophy pike hunters and always boated pike over 40"" on their Lac Seul trips. They were dissappointed to say that least when they topped out at 39"" at Wollaston. They said you had to pay to fly out to the best areas of the lake. Maybe it was a case of 'you should have been here last week' but still, that's a lot of $$ to spend on a trip that didn't produce the trophy fish they were after. Having said that, there's no questioning the reputation of the lodge and the fishery they have there. There are a lot of lodges out there in this price/service range. Before spending that kind of money I'd be making a lot of phone calls and aksing hard line questions about the fishing at the time of year you're planning your trip. Good luck!"
1180811,Golden Eagle,2010-03-22 19:27:00,2642,"I'm going to boat 12-20 or more pike 40"" and better during my May 14 week and I'll be spending $945 + tax. Will do my own cooking. Don't have to spend a lot of money to catch big pike. Should get into a several in the mid to upper 40"". It will be an unusual spring trip if we don't. My water is not the only lake that produces big pike.Won't have a guide, but I've spent several weeks on the lake and have a pretty good idea where big fish are hanging out. Yes, it's C & R, as any good lake should be."
1180824,Guest,2010-03-22 19:50:00,0,Silsby lake lodge in Manitoba. Been there 6 times and the trophy pike fishing is a good as anywhere I have been and about half the price of wollaston. Not as good accomadations as wollaston but as good or better trophy pike fishing wiht half the boat rides and no fly outs needed. I average 6 pike over 41 inches per trip and about 60 between 37 and 41. Largest is 48. You cant make a bad choice between these two fishing wise just depends on how much ammentities you want. Good luck
1182882,reconssd,2010-03-27 19:44:00,147,Thanks for all of the feedback. I guess I have to rethink whether or not Wollaston is worth the considerable expense.
