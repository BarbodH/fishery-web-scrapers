I have 3 1/2 months and have all I 'll ever need in the tackle box, so as an excuse now, I started shopping for the ""less fortunate"" in my group so they might start catching something. LOL I knew it was a bad idea for BPS to open a store 1 mile from the house. Spending all my beer money!! Have a good trip, Rob"

Looks like a low water start to the year. They have been having rain the past week, and snow/rain mix is predicted today. Perhaps they will start putting through more water soon for all of us going to Minaki. Hope you all get in to the walleye and have a great trip, Don PS: A fishing report would be nice when you get back."

I will give you a report when we return. Yes We are back at Big North. It is very peaceful down there this time of year. We see very few boats and that section of river has minimal building on it. The people at Big North are so accomodating and the cabins are perfect for our needs."
1197949,Guest,2010-05-07 21:40:00,0,You might want to check out Viking Outpost site. The blog has a part where you can get some really good ideas from Hugh on the tackle he's been using for a long time. I read it and decided that I can reduce my tackle by at least 95%
