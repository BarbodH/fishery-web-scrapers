1196093,81Saluki,2010-05-03 07:40:00,97,"Just saw the following news report on the CKDR website (ckdr.net). ""You may notice red, rectangular devices when boating on area lakes this Spring. The Province is conducting a study on how changes in water temperature impact walleye, lake trout and other fish. The red devices report the lake temperatures ever hour. The monitoring devices will be placed in 22-lakes in the Dryden, Red Lake, Fort Frances and Thunder Bay District's. They will be collected before the water freezes this Fall."" I searched the MNR's site but didn't find any info on the project. Does anyone know which lakes are being researched? FYI ... I'm particularly interested in the Indian Lake chain north of Vermilion Bay (in the Dryden district). Thanks, 81Saluki"
