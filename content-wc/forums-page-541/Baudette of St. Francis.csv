1197829,Guest,2010-05-07 16:05:00,0,"Looks to me that this way is a long streach. We use to fish Wabigon just east o Dryden. Never tried going thru Baudette. Looks like a very longer way, If your going to Duluth you might want to look at crossing at Thunder Bay. I think there is a crossing there named Pegion River. Haven't been that way in a long time so i may not remember it all."
1197867,Bill Krejca,2010-05-07 17:51:00,6107,"Pigeon River is also a good place to cross, very similar to Baudette, with a very short wait early Sat. mornings and mid-Sat. afternoon. Officials also display professionalism. Bill Krejca"

1197076,Guest,2010-05-05 16:26:00,0,Which way across the border and why?
1197077,camp chef,2010-05-05 16:28:00,915,where are you coming from?

1197081,camp chef,2010-05-05 16:35:00,915,"Well if you come up 53 like I assume you will,Fort Francis is substantially shorter.We have never had a big enough backup that it would warrant the extra driving time."
1197085,Guest,2010-05-05 16:45:00,0,Thanks. Have crossed both places since 62. Haven't been across for three years. Last time was thru baudette. No lines and little traffic to Emo. Last time I crossed at Ft. Francis it took us 2hrs. Anyone have any update on 35N construction? Came back from Baudette after fishing spring walleyes and 'no problems'. Than was in the fist week of April. By the way fishing was incredable.
1197247,Tonyo,2010-05-06 05:20:00,212,"My 2 cents is, We travel through the border on Friday afternoon with little or no wait time in Fort Frances on our way up but have started to avoid Ft. Frances and International Falls on our way home and going through Baudette. It is a little out of our way but we don't have to wait and that makes up for the long wait times on our way home and we get to skip the Border Bob's Stop that takes an hour. This actually saves us more than an hour by the time it is all said and done. Enjoy your trip. TonyO"
1197269,Bill Krejca,2010-05-06 06:51:00,6107,"The last 15 years or so, I have gone through Baudette, rather than FF. From the Cedar Rapids area, it maybe is a bit closer, in miles through FF, but I just really enjoy the Baudette route. The wait time through Baudette on Saturday morning is from ""0"" minutes to maybe 5 minutes, both ways. The officials both ways are mostly friendly and seem to accomplish their purpose without ""alienating"" the people crossing. Bill Krejca"

Frances and International Falls on our way home and going through Baudette."" We have changed our trip travel itinerary the last few years..we leave home (Northern ILL) about 5:00AM and are able to get to Int Falls around 3:00PM or so..So far there have only been 3-4 cars ahead of us at the Candadian Customs..after a brief stop at the Safeway in FF for potatoes, eggs and milk we continue on to the Lodge...our owner has allowed us to come in early for $25 per man for extra night in the cabin..we actually have been able to get in about 3 hours of fishing on Friday evening.. Coming home we used to leave first thing the following Friday morning and would inevitalbly hit that long wait to cross back into the US..what we do now is quit fishing about 2:30PM on Thursday go to our cabin and pack up..after everything is in the cars and boats, we go to the lodge and have our evening meal at around 4:00PM..after saying our goodbyes we hit the road and drive straight to the border..So far we havent have more than a 5 min wait...we then spend the night in Int Natl Falls and head home the next morning arriving around 7:00PM instead of the 10:00PM by doing it the other way.. The fishing time we lose from the Thursday evening we make up by getting a whole day fishing on Saturday instead of just a half day and the 3 hours fishing we get in on our Friday evening arrival day is just a bonus.."
1197457,Obabikon,2010-05-06 16:10:00,2370,Baudette is a free bridge... saves you six bucks per car. It really depends on how much distance it adds to you. If it's less than 30miles... Baudette is worth it.
