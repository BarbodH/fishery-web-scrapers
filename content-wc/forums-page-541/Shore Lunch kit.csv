1197095,celticbass1,2010-05-05 17:13:00,67,"I don't get the allure of the shore lunch, way to much prep time, we typically o to the middle of the lake, open the cooler, grab our sandwiches, some chips, a soda, and finish it off with a candy bar or twinkie type snack. If we are going to fish near the cabin we sometimes go to the cabin and do everything above and add a can of soup."
1197110,joeman79,2010-05-05 18:37:00,417,"After a morning of catching 20-30 walleyes, to me there is nothing better than finding a sandy beach starting the propane burner and by the time the guys get the fish cleaned and sip a beer. I have the onion rings or fries goin and the walleye filets are getting dredged in LOVE awaiting the hot grease. And hearing the sighs of satisfaction and the OMG this is great makes it all worth it to me. Fishing 10-11 hours a day is enough for me. But we still only do this every other day. 87 days till my next shore lunch. YUM!!!"
1197578,Guest,2010-05-07 06:00:00,0,"Tin foil and a couple cans of Itialian stewed tomatoes. Place the fish in the foil with the tomatoes, place in fire for about ten to twelve minutes. I use a bowl and don't miss a drop! Also add fresh lemon and butter along with pepper if I feel like living large. Healthy and soooo sooo good with fresh walleye and pike! Not to mention simple and easy to pack. Don't foreget the can opener!"
1197588,AllenW,2010-05-07 06:21:00,11482,"I think he was inquestion of Golden Eagles comment about bringing fish back on the lake from the previous meal/day before?If so, not sure but I belive you might have some problems with that and limit numbers.Best I can figure is it says fish in possession and noth wether they're cooked or not..Propane is defineitly easier than a fire, but its all about room, more room in the boat, more stuff.Remember propane in a boat is not always a wise move, as it's heavier than air, be careful.Al...who's also at that afternoon nap stage of his life..."
1187713,Bigfishhunter,2010-04-09 11:17:00,803,"I see no need to have all that disposable stuff like the paper plates, plastic forks etc. I use old metal cake pans to put the fish in (I do put paper towel down in the bottom - 1of 2 disposable items) then in the pans I put my metal or plastic camping plates, in those goes metal forks, knives and spoons. We keep old travel type mugs (free from insurance companies, banks etc) for our cups, and then ziplocks with bread crumbs, flour etc. Add to that the other necessities like fry pan, oil, potatoes, ketchup, tartar, seasonings etc. It all fits either in a cloth grocery bag or a rubber made container. Simple, and stuff can be rinsed in the lake for reuse a thousand and one times."
1188003,Tonyo,2010-04-10 06:42:00,212,"I don't know about you but when we are ready to stop for lunch we are ready for a break. We have learned that getting a fire started and dealing with said fire is a little over rated. We have big enough boat with enough storage, we just take a propane tank and stand to cook on. If it is cool out we may start a small fire to warm up with but cooking on the propane is quick, easy and a heck of a lot faster. As for the Shore Lunch kit, we have a large plastic container with a snap on lid that all of the supplies fit in and then we use the lid as the pre area for the fish, onion rings and potatoes. We keep it as simple as possible. One of the biggest time savers we have found is we use sliced canned potatoes. They make a great french fry and take no time to prepare. Just open the can and dump them in. We all have our spin on what is right or not. Just pack up and give it a try. You will not be sorry no matter what you do. There is nothing like shore lunch in Ontario. TonyO."
1188095,Obabikon,2010-04-10 12:59:00,2370,"i'll agree that propane is easy... but, there's nothing like the heat from a campfire."
1188286,Tonyo,2010-04-11 06:29:00,212,"I have a quick question, I know a couple of years ago there was a ban on open fires due to the area being to dry. A couple of weeks ago a post was on this site that it might be an awful dry spring and the threat for forest fires was pretty high. Is there or will there be a ban on open fires this spring? Just wondering. Tonyo"
1188289,Peffley'sCamp,2010-04-11 06:41:00,37,"I don't think there is any way of accurately predicting that. With the lack of snowcover this year, the spring is going to start off a little on the dry side, but the determining factor will be the weather pattern for the remainder of the spring and throughout the season. Anything like last year (cool and wet) then certainly no bans. If we have a hot and dry season, then yes could be very likely.Although not always the best for the comfort of the fisherman, a moderate amount of rain is certainly good to keep the risk of bush fires in check."
1191147,Peffley'sCamp,2010-04-19 09:26:00,37,Just got off the phone with an MNR agent in Kenora who told me conditions are VERY dry in most of NW Ontario and that he would not be surprised if a burn ban (no open fires for shore lunch included) would be put in place within the next week.The area really needs some good soaking rains to improve conditions. Be sure to check with your outfitter before your trip if you plan to do a shore lunch. You may need a cookstove if the area does not get the badly needed rain between now and opening week.
1191236,DanM57,2010-04-19 14:48:00,135,"If you are looking for a way to test the heat of your oil, try a couple of kernels of pop corn. The corn pops at 350.....the perfect temp for frying fish."
1191272,2746,2010-04-19 17:01:00,3206,"As with others we have given up building a fire and instead use a small one burner propane stove. We've also chosen to forgo the ""extras"" with lunch and only cook fish that we eat with bread or tortillas. Some cheese, fruit and sweets for those that need them and we are done. Lots less work.....guess we are getting old. Makes the shore lunch box small, easy to pack and little to carry out.""How old are we?"" Old enough that when we fish a smaller lake like Gullrock we go back to the cabin for lunch and then a nap."
1191482,camp chef,2010-04-20 08:38:00,915,"One of my favorite things in the whole world has been shorelunches with good friends.Over the years when our group was bigger we would gather for a shorelunch daily.As age has crept up on us,My boat partner and I take an annual trip with just the two of us. Lunch now consists of a sandwich and chips in the boat or a stop at the cabin for Bacon,eggs and perhaps a short nap. The thought of building a fire out on the lake and cooking fish for just the two of us doesn't make sense. We do have ""shorelunch parties"" here at home on a regular basis. Much less work on your patio or deck."
1191699,nitroman,2010-04-20 20:08:00,368,We do the sandwhich thing also. Find a nice spot to throw out the slip bobbers eat lunch and catch a fish or 2 or a quick nap! I'm to much of a fish-o-haulic to take the time to do the shore lunch. Might take the MSR Pocket Rocket with this year and grill my ham and cheese in the boat.....
1117180,rockpt,2009-06-29 09:53:00,589,"Put everything in a wooden shore lunch box with handles and a stand with a hinge on the cover so when you open the top it can be used like a table. Also, rather than over mitts I use heavy leather fireplace gloves. Don't burn through and good for breaking up firewood, handling the sooty grill, etc. And store the grill in a burlap bag on the boat."
1117205,wiswalleye,2009-06-29 11:19:00,62,"We just filet the fish on the cooler top, put them in a pan to be used for beans and rinse them in the lake. Skip the batter and use a small two burner propane stove. No sense getting fancy."
1117210,rockpt,2009-06-29 11:37:00,589,My brother's the same way. He doesn't even cook his fish. Just skins and eats 'em raw. No one is going to accuse him of being fancy.
1117227,Jig Man,2009-06-29 12:50:00,95,"If you have one, use the boat paddle to clean the fish on."
1117300,alanexpup,2009-06-29 17:12:00,278,Just curious. when you bring the leftover fish with you back onto the lake has the fish nazi ever counted your just caught fish and your precooked fish to put you over the limit? sounds like a pickle to me.
1117311,wiswalleye,2009-06-29 17:35:00,62,What leftover fish? Don't kill more than you're going to eat.
1117450,Kruger,2009-06-30 08:31:00,259,You're daily limit counts the ones you ate.
1117530,Mohleye,2009-06-30 14:08:00,368,"Alanex pup, I'm not sure I understand your question, but I think I do.... Do you mean the remains of the fish cleaned for shore lunch? Those get left for the gulls. Leave the remains on shore or in shallow water so the gulls can get to them. The fish you eat do count toward your daily limit and possession limit, so we never keep any ""take-homers"" until the last day, and have sandwiches for lunch that day. You do have to pay attention to this, especially if you have a conservation license where the limit is two. If you plan to eat a couple for shore lunch and a couple more for supper, best to buy the regular license with the possession limit of 4. (I'm talking Ontario here, just to be clear.)"
1118181,Bluff,2009-07-03 08:37:00,152,We've been using an old Coleman two burner propane stove for years and it works great. Another easy nice compliment to the fish are some baked beans with onion and chop up a few hotdogs - don't forget the Tabasco.
1187654,rmeachum,2010-04-09 08:42:00,1,"Hey there,There is a perfect solution to any shore lunch. Go to www.bigzacs.com and check out the shore lunch kit they offer.Rick"
568065,Guest,2007-08-03 19:33:00,0,"Help! I lost my list of items for the shore lunch kit. Anyone have an up to date list they wish to share? Forever grateful, well, maybe not quite."
568074,Guest,2007-08-04 09:16:00,0,There are several mentioned if you do a google search. One that appears good to me is at: www.ontariofisherman.com Its in htm format so I cann't copy and paste the entire link. Good luck. Gary
568077,campownerchick,2007-08-04 10:29:00,13,"Hi, I checked out the link from www.ontariofisherman.com and it is a good one. There are a few things I've added. From the site: fillet knife, coffee pot, long tongs, oven mitts, matches,12"" x 16"" grill, newspaper to start the fire, can opener, plastic cutlery, paper plates, paper towels, foam coffee cups, large metal serving spoons and flippers, ziplock bags for breading the fish, cast iron fry pans (fry pans with long handles are better), garbage bags, coating/seasoning mix for the fish, oil (bring more than you need in case you burn the first batch), ketchup, tartar sauce, lemons, coffee whitener and sugar, coffee and tea, bread and butter, parboiled potatoes (already sliced), onions (already sliced), pork and beans, cookies, fruit, cold drinks, cooler with ice. I would add: empty ice cream container with lid, foil, foil pans to put the cooked fish in, scouring pads, dawn dish soap, bar of soap and hand towel, salt and pepper, pail of split wood (use the pail to drown the fire) Happy shore lunching!"
568078,Guest,2007-08-04 11:42:00,0,"sounds like a lot of extra bs in the boat and a lot of extra work. we pack sandwiches and stuff then head back to camp about 6pm then do the big supper with fried fish and whatnot. anyway each to thier own, looking forward to that trip in a couple weeks.enjoy"
568079,AllenW,2007-08-04 12:53:00,11482,"Depending on desired creature comforts and number of boats and size, you can eliminate quite a bit of that, a full blown shore lunch may be nice, but we've done just fish many times and no ones complained. We'd mix the egg and milk batter before we went, have large baggies with some Fryin Magic in to bread the fish, paper plates, don't really need silverware except the tongs to deal with frying the fish, a medium sized skillet, cast iron is nice, but steel or aluminum works and is lighter, a grate to put over the fire and then put the skillet on, salt and pepper, paper towels and a jug of oil and a couple of bics or matches, along with the basic's ya normally may carry like beverages, snacks and such. You can get all this to fit in a pretty small area if ya do it right. Guess it depends on whether ya want a snack or full blown meal. I find its easier to do the big meal at the end of the day, in camp. Al"
568113,orchard frank,2007-08-06 10:43:00,1900,"After the first few years at Lac Seul, shore lunch became a highlight of the day. Food always simple, fish and potatoes, something sweet for after, but the setting got better and better. Since we had our own boat with enough room, we packed a propane stove, folding chairs and a roll up table. I've got pictures of Basil and Jim Hayes from Lost Island with big grins sitting in the chairs while I fixed shore lunch for them. A ""first"" they said. Great times. We enjoyed a break in the middle of the day, refreshed us for the afternoon. A little nap was not out of the question."
568119,wooglin,2007-08-06 12:08:00,371,"We keep it simple: *box or two of 'shorelunch' *knife for fillets *cutting board and/or 2x6 for filleting fish *strainer for fillets *bottle of water to rinse fillets *2 gallon zip-lock for shaking fillets/batter *large pan *bottle of vege. oil *Papertowels for holding fish when finished frying *Matches/lighter for fire (we used to do burners, but natrual campfire is easier) We'll either burn the paper and boxes on the fire when we're done, or just take it home with us in the zip-lock. Washing the pan is simple, cool it off, put it in the lake with sand in the pan, shake it around for a bit - clean."
1117140,tjsker,2009-06-29 07:38:00,301,I never tried cooking a shore lunch before and have a some questions. Is firewood that plentiful? Do you skip shorelunch on damp days or do you bring the propane.
1117168,Golden Eagle,2009-06-29 09:23:00,2642,"Since pike turn on between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. I take a boat lunch kit that consists of leftover walleyes, sliced bread, sweet onion, ginger snaps, and pretzels. I eat on the move. Don't want to take time from fishing. I've had plenty of great shore lunches, but mid day pike fishing ranks right up there with the evening walleye bite."
1117178,Nimstug,2009-06-29 09:50:00,2605,Fire wood is plentiful is you find a beaver lodge or two....
