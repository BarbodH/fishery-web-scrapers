1196207,Moondog,2010-05-03 11:53:00,362,Who has the best (largest) and cheapest minnows in the Vermillion Bay Area? Got an aerator this year and am going to pick some up on the way north.
1196515,tackleman,2010-05-04 07:50:00,444,when I fish Eagle I always get the minnows at Bobby's corner store. This is just across from the auto-pro shop and I don't think the price at this store is any different from any others in the area and the parking is easy.
