1197933,Rich B,2010-05-07 21:06:00,1081,"Erie - thanks for sharing those photos....I had a very good older friend that passed away a few years back, and he fished Canada for years and had similar photos (and stories to tell)....the boats and rods/reels may change, but the ""upnorth"" experience remains a true pleasure for those of us that love the outdoors.

1197403,Golden Eagle,2010-05-06 13:07:00,2642,"Every paragraph reminds me of one of my many trips dating back to 1959. Sometimes I look at, not read, 3 or 4 pages and have no idea what material I've covered. Then I go back, start over and get through a few pages before drifting back to my own memories.Nothing wrong with reliving previous trips, but it's now time to think about the 2010 opener. Thanks, Bill, for a really good read. I've bought several copies for my friends."

1197550,Erie Ranger620,2010-05-06 22:04:00,74,"Being a younger 40 I had no idea of the tough times they went through, to do what I take so for granted. Although i did have to live through my Dads 55hp 1974 Trihull Charger, though I regress. I just wish they could have eaten more of their catch instead of just their daily ration of dried meat. The stories are great and I will always spend some cold winters night day dreaming as I read it. Maybe someday Bill I will meet you at O'sullivans 50 days and counting! This link shows some old photos of my dads trips"
