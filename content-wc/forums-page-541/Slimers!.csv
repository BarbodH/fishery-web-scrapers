Not much info on here about them but I have used them almost from the first time they were offered. They are a really great bait.They are almost like a real leech and slimy they are. They are in a vial and wneh you take them out of the vial, they seem almost alive, way better than the Gulp Alive ones. All I have used are the 3 "" Black leeches both up in Ontario and also on lake Oneida and Black Lake. They work really good under a slip bobber and also on an inline spinner balde rig. I am going to try them up in Pasha Lake this June to. I ordered some more last night on the website and this evening the owner called me and said seeing I live so close I could buy them locally and save me the shipping costs. His website is called Johhny Darter and is on Grand Island, NY."
