6743807,Ohio fisherman,2023-06-11 12:09:00,988,Thanks for the detailed info. A grumpy border agent could maybe make life tough!
6743813,RichA$1970,2023-06-11 12:12:00,1158,Huge line past the stop lights coming back at Ft Francis but only took 30 minutes and the guy with his drivers license and birth certificate got thru no problem.
6743209,Camoclad,2023-06-08 09:24:00,628,"I agree, we just went on a cruise and about half of the crowd had a birth certificate and sailed right through just like the passport-bearing folks did when we returned to Florida."
6743239,Eckohlt,2023-06-08 11:23:00,3685,"But,,,,you can still be dumber than a box of rocks and catch plenty of fish in ONT!!"
6743315,pjshorthorn,2023-06-08 18:42:00,5654,Doesn't look like you could beat your own chest anymore than you have already .geezzz. PjShorthorn
6743521,Ohio fisherman,2023-06-09 22:33:00,988,"Glad to hear that all is well so far. I have had a few challenges crossing both ways. The challenges were from border agents being thorough in their work and we were the random or other reason for a bit more scrutiny. It has been only a matter of delay for me since I am always prepared with birth certificate, vehicle titles, registrations, insurance verifications, and proof that my rabies vaccination is current. Not to pointlessly throw wood on the fire, but why is it not necessary to have a passport to enter into Canada and then return to the USA? What is the legal authority for this assertion? Wife and I need to renew our passports. Looking at the moderately speedy method. I cannot neatly write my name in those little letter boxes on the forms. Penmanship has always been a challenge for me. Wifey will need to fill in the forms for me."
6743589,emma17,2023-06-10 09:09:00,436,"I don't know the legal authority that enables US citizens to cross the Canadian border without a passport (but with Birth Certificate and DL), but it's not surprising given our close relationship. As lmbkiller has posted previously, it's absolutely permitted. That said, although I called Canadian Border Services twice and each time was told it was permitted, I was also told it was somewhat up to the specific border agent. Because I didn't want to deal w any potential issues and because I needed a renewed passport anyway, I went through the 2- week rush process in the US."
6743685,Ohio fisherman,2023-06-10 18:58:00,988,"That worked out well for you. Was the expedited program different from the regular program, other than the speedy attention? It is odd that the international law requiring a passport would be misrepresented with entrance with a birth certificate and driver's license really being at the discretion of the individual border agent."
6743699,elway12,2023-06-10 21:01:00,335,"Maybe this will help: Here is what happened to my group last summer - July 2022. My mom had ordered her 1st ever passport in February with the expedited fee and had not received it a week before we left for Canada. (She ended up getting it 2 weeks after our trip) Because we had not received it I called Canadian Border services 2x. Both times I spoke with very pleasant people and they both said she was allowed to go into Canada with only her birth certificate. When we arrived at the Pigeon River/Grand Portage border entry we gave them her birth certificate & her drivers license. The border agent asked my mom if this was her birth certificate - it of course was but since my mom had married (my Dad) her last name was different than what was listed on her B.C. After we nicely said that she had married and that had changed her last name we were allowed to enter Canada. In my opinion - the agents working the actual border don't ""like"" having people without their passports because I assume it's easier for them to check their backgrounds."
6743701,emma17,2023-06-10 21:06:00,436,"The US Passport Agency offers an Urgent Travel option whereby you can contact a regional office and attempt to set an appointment if you're within 2 weeks of travel. There aren't many regional offices that have a passport printer to turn passports around the same day. When I first called for the Chicago office, they were entirely booked for the 2 weeks in advance of my travel date, so I asked for the next closest agency. It was Detroit. However, Detroit only had a Saturday appointment, and they didn't do same say printing on Saturday. I asked for the next available location, they said Arkansas. I called the next two days- 13 and 12 days before traveling (hold time on the phone is roughly one hour). Fortunately I was able to get a Friday afternoon appointment in Minneapolis, which worked out well w my travel plans. I don't know why the representative from the Canadian office felt it necessary to mention it's somewhat up to the border agent, perhaps because they want to discourage the usage of birth certificates in lieu of passports."
6743769,Lmbkiller,2023-06-11 08:50:00,639,"All those people can own it pj, no need to deflect for them"
6743779,Yellowfin123,2023-06-11 09:50:00,2182,"bingo... all the agent has to do is stick that passport in the machine and off you go... it make his life easier plain and simple.... BUT, after reading thru this thread and other threads the last 10 years, it makes a person think you really DON'T need a passport to get in and out of canada what so ever"
6742419,reddemon2,2023-06-03 14:05:00,255,Don't need a passport to cross into canada
6742475,RichA$1970,2023-06-03 20:49:00,1158,Long line after paying the toll but 3 lanes open and only took around 25 minutes. The guy who forgot his passport used a drivers license and birth certificate with no problem. Great to be here and no issues
6742479,Yellowfin123,2023-06-03 21:27:00,2182,"I didn't think your buddy would have issues getting in, the question will be whats it like to get back out ??? you might post what happened on the way out, got a kid with no passport"
6742481,emma17,2023-06-03 22:23:00,436,"For what it's worth. I drove up from IL last Friday and stopped in Minneapolis at the passport agency for same day passport issuance. You can only set an appointment w the agency if you're within 2 weeks of travel (with proof of travel itinerary). My appointment was at 1:30 pm and I walked out with a new passport book at 3:45 pm. I did call Canadian passport and was told a birth certificate and driver's license should work, but it somewhat depended on the border agent for ultimate approval, which is why I decided to get the same day issuance. I had to call multiple times before an appointment slot opened up."
6742787,Ranger2008,2023-06-06 04:17:00,25,"I would bet he has no issues coming back to the US with DL and Birth Certificate. He is a US citizen and with these documents, they should not deny him entry."
6742815,Bill Krejca,2023-06-06 07:01:00,6107,"Did that a few years ago, son-in-law forgot to renew his passport. It was a challenge finding long parking space for truck and boat(2 meters), plus feeding the meters while waiting. Saw more of downtown than I needed, but got the passport and went on our way. Bill"
6742845,nitroman,2023-06-06 11:09:00,368,got a guy doing the same this week
6742857,emma17,2023-06-06 12:10:00,436,Funny. I ended up parking in the Home Depot lot and getting an Uber to the agency.
6743021,rockape,2023-06-07 09:36:00,215,Don't need one coming back into the states either. I've talked to both sides in detail. You are totally good. USA needs to let you in no matter what as you are an American citizen.
6743145,Lmbkiller,2023-06-07 21:24:00,639,Hilarious I've said this since I joined and get nothing but slammed. All it shows is how dumb the majority of wc is. Very unfortunate cuz it just makes this site more untrustworthy
6742299,RichA$1970,2023-06-02 20:10:00,1158,"Just took off from my buddy Fred’s house in Northern Illinois to Eagle Lake. There’s 4 of us currently in the suburban, however 1 guy I’ve never met but is the brother to the other guy we fished with a lot lost his passport. He brought his birth certificate and new Illinois drivers license. He has a photo of his passport on his phone so this should be a lovely border crossing. Worse case in 8 hours he will be dropped off at the International Falls Airport but just a basic reminder to all, double check your passport and expiration date."
6742301,Eckohlt,2023-06-02 20:19:00,3685,I think they serve fresh walleye in jail up there.
6742305,Eckohlt,2023-06-02 20:21:00,3685,"Good luck Rich,you might need it,hahaha."
6742309,prov1800,2023-06-02 20:28:00,5010,Just hide him under the luggage.lol.Good luck.Hopefully we will meet on lake next week.
6742311,RichA$1970,2023-06-02 20:29:00,1158,Maybe he can Uber down to Rochester and you can mentor him for a week haha
6742313,RichA$1970,2023-06-02 20:30:00,1158,. Sounds good John and hope you have a good crew you’re guiding for.
6742339,Eckohlt,2023-06-03 05:42:00,3685,"We have plenty of rift raft here,one won't hurt!"
6742345,prov1800,2023-06-03 05:56:00,5010,Thx Rich.will find out tomorrow lol.
6742365,NARDA 1,2023-06-03 07:54:00,636,How did the crossing go? Where are you staying on Eagle?
6742379,Walleye2242,2023-06-03 09:05:00,263,He will have no issues. Last Sept...my passport was expired...had birth and DL. I told the border guy...he said just give me your passport...i said its expired...he said..i dont care.
