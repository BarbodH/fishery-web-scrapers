6742307,Eckohlt,2023-06-02 20:23:00,3685,Thanks for that info!Any bait ???
6742319,Thalweg,2023-06-02 20:49:00,243,"They did ask about bait, we did not have any. They asked the other standard questions- where going, how long, alcohol, tobacco, and weapons."
6742363,kona77,2023-06-03 07:32:00,236,"They did ask about bait, we did not have any. They asked the other standard questions- where going, how long, alcohol, tobacco, and weapons. Same for our group when we crossed at Int. Falls. Just the standard questions. We did have eggs along but no questions about our food. Been in contact with 2 other groups who have crossed and same experience with them"
6742513,stjoeguy,2023-06-04 10:28:00,979,"We got the usual questions at Int. Falls on 6/2, also. No questions about food."
6742521,IaDave14,2023-06-04 11:46:00,99,Hey super moderator what are you doing posting on WC when you are at St Joe this week?
6742767,stjoeguy,2023-06-05 20:34:00,979,Just taking a break to rest from catching all those fish. We all miss you Dave!
6740783,Reels,2023-05-25 05:00:00,2876,Is Canada allowing chicken and eggs again at the boarder?
6740785,Huntindave,2023-05-25 05:06:00,2194,"""Beginning on March 15, 2023, the CFIA will allow the importation of clearly labelled, retail-packaged poultry products and by-products for human consumption, labelled with the term ""Product of the USA"", from any state, regardless of whether or not there is currently an outbreak.""https://inspection.canada.ca/food-sa.../1389630282362https://inspection.canada.ca/animal-.../1659970021314"
6740789,Reels,2023-05-25 05:17:00,2876,Thanks!
6740793,stjoeguy,2023-05-25 05:52:00,979,"I'm still going to stop in Dryden to buy eggs. The fact that the CIFA announcement refers to ""Product of the USA"" in quotation marks concerns me. Eggs might indicate that they were packaged in Illinois, etc but I haven't seen any eggs labeled as ""Product of the USA"". Besides, Dryden is a good place for us to stop and take a break. Maybe I'm wrong and the border agents won't care. If anyone crosses the border in the next week with eggs, please report how it goes. Thanks."
6741009,steve.a,2023-05-26 06:03:00,274,After reading this it looks like you cannot make ahead something like chili and freeze because it will have meat that is no longer in the package it was sold in. Has anyone been asked about something like this?
6741029,jambi,2023-05-26 07:13:00,504,"We've brought in precooked frozen chili before, but never got asked or searched. Or that's what i remember. We may not bring this year after reading this"
6741063,lmoore,2023-05-26 09:32:00,40,"Last year they asked if all of our food was in ""original commercial packaging,"" or something like that."
6741091,Huntindave,2023-05-26 12:37:00,2194,"Did you even read the links, which provide the regs straight from the government?? Multi-ingredient foods -- No restrictions-- 20 kg (if measured by weight) 20 L (if measured by volume) Is your chili ""multi ingredient""? Are you bringing less than the maximum allowed?"
6741097,Thalweg,2023-05-26 12:57:00,243,"The second link you provided above states - ""What is not allowed Poultry products must be retail packaged, for human consumption, and clearly labelled as a ""Product of the USA"" to enter Canada. Some examples of restricted items include: Restaurant food or leftovers Homemade food Poultry products and by-products from roadside stands or farms Poultry items from backyard flocks Meat items (including poultry) entering Canada by mail or courier"" While this is in a poultry section, the list specifically references poultry for 3 of the bullets but not for leftovers and homemade food. My assumption is that it would only apply to leftovers and homemade food containing poultry but as written it could be interpreted as any homemade food."
6741609,jambi,2023-05-30 06:34:00,504,This is the link I read and interpreted homemade food to be chili. We'll be fine without it.
