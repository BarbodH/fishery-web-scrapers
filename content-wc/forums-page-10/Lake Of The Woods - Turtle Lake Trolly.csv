6743417,Obabikon,2023-06-09 10:16:00,2370,Flow (much like Obabikon Lake) would have depended greatly on wind direction and rainfall.

6743267,Obabikon,2023-06-08 14:57:00,2370,That depends on the weight of your boat. It is not designed to pull super heavy boats across.
6743301,Hawker,2023-06-08 17:51:00,3967,"It's working, but with a 19' glass boat, you will work your bippy off, both ways. Was just up there last week, four boats from camp (Young's Wilderness Camp) with 16' G3's said they'd trailer to Whitefish b4 they'd ever use the portage again...."
6743311,Yellowfin123,2023-06-08 18:31:00,2182,"this must have been rebuilt in 2022 i assume and if its a pain in the rear to get a 16ft g3 over it, i guess that says it all..."
6743319,Eckohlt,2023-06-08 18:45:00,3685,"What's on the other side of the portage,fish galore???or just more water!"
6743331,Yellowfin123,2023-06-08 20:19:00,2182,"i guess you could cross the portage and go for lake trout, thats about the only difference , i always thought they should just bring in a 50 ton backhoe and dig it out"
6743341,NETim1187,2023-06-08 20:50:00,166,"My understanding is that many, many years ago, there was a channel dug through there that connected to two areas. However, the connection was causing issues as the water quality is different on both sides of the portage and it was causing issues as a result. https://northernontario.travel/sunse...age-lake-woods"
6743345,Wallychowder,2023-06-09 03:23:00,1567,"waters alot cleaner on ""the other side"""
6743347,pjshorthorn,2023-06-09 03:32:00,5654,This is correct. PjShorthorn
6743363,Bill Krejca,2023-06-09 06:56:00,6107,"Reason for closing the canal was due to the more silted Sabaskong water entering Whitefish Bay. The concern was that lake trout eggs require +/- silt free water in order to hatch. The controversy has been going on since the dug canal in the early 1950's replaced the small stream which flowed, depending on the wind, in either direction. That original portage required either pushing boat through it, or, if the water level was low, grunting boats across the log ladder. Located at the Turtle Lake end, 1/4 mile from the later dug canal.
