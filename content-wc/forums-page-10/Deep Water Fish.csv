It's clearly an indication of barotrauma and the fish is not likely to live - even if it swims off - the protruding stomach may only be the external indication of barotrauma - other internal organs could/are damaged also. for those of us who are mainly ""catch and release"" types, these fish should be shore lunch or dinner - or - better yet - fish in water less than 20-25 ft unless you plan to keep what you catch. phish"
6742777,Lmbkiller,2023-06-05 22:29:00,639,Fish saver descending device is the ticket or fish depths less than 25ft for walleye. That's the best advice
6742795,last chance,2023-06-06 05:52:00,3262,"that's great advice but you still have a high mortality rate from the trauma alone for pulling fish from deep cold water to very warm surface water. and the major change in pressure from deep water to no pressure at all when boated also has a major effect on mortality. but if you must fish deep water catch and release bring the fish to the boat and handle as little as possible and return them to the water as soon as you are done descending the fish. however, we fish Lake Erie's central basin and we catch fish at 50' and 55' on a regular basis. and we do catch a few small fish that must be returned by law when they are under the size limit. but we only fish for 1 week per year. so the damage we do is minimal. but the guys that fish all summer and fun fish after getting their limit or the guys that only do catch and release are killing 10,s of thousands of fish each year. but i do believe the DNR takes this into consideration when setting the catch limits. but now they don't control this anymore. I think Congress or some unit of government of the state has to pass any changes to the limits."
6743863,Franco,2023-06-11 18:04:00,107,"I fished Dog Lake in Missinabi a few years ago. I’ve never seen anything like it. Much of the lake drops off very, very quickly, all the way down to like 120 feet. I showed up with 1oz weights and my medium rod while everyone else was catching walleye at 60-70 feet using 2-3 oz weights and heavy rods lol…needless to say, I didn’t catch much but I learned a lot!"
6742525,rpbadger,2023-06-04 12:14:00,22,"Was watching an episode of The Ontario Experience this morning where the guys were catching Walleyes in 80 feet of water. They stated that they had to keep the fish as they could not survive if being released. They said that Lake Trout and Whitefish could survive that transition, however. Does anyone know what the depth limits for catching Walleye and Pike are? I've caught fish at 40' and released them and they seemed ok?"
6742531,kzoofisher,2023-06-04 12:42:00,5144,"30' after that the delayed mortality rate skyrockets. Organ damage might take a day or two to kill them but it will. I think the depth where mortality approaches 100% is 50-60"". At 30' the rate is 30% or so."
6742541,last chance,2023-06-04 13:35:00,3262,you are spot on. the 30' line is where it starts killing the fish at an alarming rate and the deeper you go the higher percentage of fish die. but some fish will not survive even when released at 15' or 20' just from the shock of being brought out of the water. and it's a great idea to handle fish that's going to be released as little as possible as it removes the slime coating that protects them front parasites and disease.
6742545,phishfearme,2023-06-04 14:06:00,1242,"30 ft is as good a guideline as any - but barotrauma also has to do with the rate of being drawn up from deep and also the temperature of the surface water (thermal shock). Typically, northern lakes have large thermoclines in the summer maybe only 20feet or so. we just will not even fish below 25 ft or so - unless we plan to keep anything we catch from depth. 12-15 feet max for us. regrettably there are a few ""sportsmen"" on this board and others who think that ""fizzing"" is the answer - when a fish is brought from deep and the swim bladder protrudes from the mouth, poke a small hole in it and let it fizz. the fish will indeed swim away soon to die. phish"
6742551,Wallychowder,2023-06-04 14:42:00,1567,I wonder if they were checked by the MNR ?
6742651,10point,2023-06-05 06:27:00,102,I experienced barotrauma in fish for the first time pulling up perch from 60 feet in Lake Michigan in March. The DNR was going after people throwing small ones back to keep bigger ones. You keep the first 15 no matter the size.
6742727,snwblnd,2023-06-05 15:36:00,50,I had a chat with the DNR Friday morning after fishing out of Portage.They're taking the barotrauma issue with the perch very seriously. Many boats were culling and were issued tickets back in March and April.I was glad to hear something is being done about it. It's somewhat of a fragile fishery.
6742729,Freytown,2023-06-05 16:16:00,770,"Many believe it's the bladder protruding from the mouth. But it's the stomach. Just google the facts. FT""At depth, the gasses in the swim bladder are at equal pressure. When the fish is reeled up to the surface, the gasses expand and can cause the eyes to become bulged, cloudy or crystallized and the stomach to protrude out of the mouth."""
6742731,Wallychowder,2023-06-05 16:26:00,1567,Doesn't matter ! It still kills them !
6742737,Old Timer,2023-06-05 16:58:00,255,Thirty years ago I watched them fizz toads floating in a horse tank at a Minaki walleye tournament. They all died. I've heard that fish brought up from water deeper than 20-25 feet will probably not survive when released.
