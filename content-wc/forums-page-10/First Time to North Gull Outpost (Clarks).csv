By the end of a week at an outpost camp, it's nice to have a few new things to try. Thanks, D! What would be great to see might be a 'Walleye Central' recipe pamphlet! I have gained a lot of delicious recipes over the years on this forum--thanks, guys! Looking forward to our first trip on June 20, to Onepine Lake, with Nestor Falls Outposts. Love the trip reports!!"

6742925,SweetD,2023-06-06 19:55:00,243,I forgot you also need to add “oil” as prescribed by the box mix instructions
6742953,Eckohlt,2023-06-07 04:25:00,3685,Any quick trips to the throne after eating that jambalya??
6742971,hoppy63,2023-06-07 06:24:00,367,"https://cafedelites.com/jambalaya/This is my favorite jambalaya recipe. I'm sure you can adjust it with walleye. Making it is very quick and easy, all the time/work is in the prep, chopping, cutting everything so you can decide if it's worth the time on a fly-in. For our group I would not but if you like to cook it's a good recipe. Another thing I've found to be key is good andouille. I have not found any good around my area (NW Ohio) though have not searched very hard. I have it shipped from a little store in Scott, La. It is expensive to have shipped and not suggesting you get it there, but for anyone into the cajun stuff it is really good, in my opinion. Their boudin is excellent as well."
6742983,SweetD,2023-06-07 07:13:00,243,Thanks Hoppy!!! May have to place an order!!!

6742609,kona77,2023-06-04 18:59:00,236,Sweet D- Glad you guys had a great trip. I also noted all the hardware in that Northern picture and we had a guy also break a rod tip on his St Croix rod in the first 30 minutes. Glad we have not had to deal with a hook in the hand issue for awhile but it is all a part of the stuff that happens on trips. Also like to finish a day with a good whiskey or bourbon.
6742623,7 Mag,2023-06-04 20:10:00,1887,"Last year I broke the tip on one of my St Croix rods, I called them to see if I could have it repaired. They wouldn’t repair it but they offered to replace it for $50 shipping and handing, I received the new rod in about a week. They just need the model and serial number if you guys are interested."

6740097,RichA$1970,2023-05-21 22:07:00,1158,I’m in charge of the groceries for this next trip & I think the crew is going to realize it’s a fishing camp and not Culinary Arts camp as one of the clowns who is no longer coming with us thought he was Wolfgang Puck.

He tried to have us share his overweight $ and Tim told him to leave at the base or cough up the $ which the moron did (guys a multi-millionaire). 1st & last time for me with this Big City Fisherman. This trip will be a lot easier in 10 days & I hope they like fish as that’s kind of the purpose of the trip."

6740157,SweetD,2023-05-22 08:26:00,243,70’s for highs sounds spectacular compared to the mid 90’s we experienced last year. The “eyes” should be on &#x1f525;
6740161,pnnylfr,2023-05-22 08:32:00,114,"SweetD, have a great trip."
6742563,SweetD,2023-06-04 15:03:00,243,"Weather was warm and fishing was hot! Caught probably 10 over 25” fish and largest was 27 3/4” (walleye). One pike at 40” and 4-5 in the 36-40” range. Numbers were extremely good as well with all size classes. Rained for maybe 9 minutes the entire week. Clouds 1 day. Got our tan! Consistent weather = Consistent fishing. World famous french toast continues to be a big hit. The jaw dropping awe inspiring sausage biscuits and gravy was a crowd favorite as well. Ate fish many ways including a parmesan crusted baked walleye that was amazing but triggered some negative response due to heating the cabin to nearly 168 degrees. The walleye jumbalaya continues to be the evening “meal of the week”. Another diversion from fish one night was Hot Sausage sandwiches with roasted red peppers in a tomato sauce and mozzarella melted on a half loaf of italian bread seemed to also be a hit. Many 100+ eye days for 4 boats was the norm. 150+ was achieved by several as well.A couple of near misses on really large walleyes but that is fishing. Both lost at or near the boat and I saw one of the two behemoths…….pretty sure the fish I laid eyes on was 30+. Can’t confirm the other but sounds like same. That one was a “net job” issue but I will not mention names to protect the innocent. One treble hook in the hand that almost bled out one of our senior members in the group was mended with some quick work with the bolt cutters and use of supplies from the 7 first aid kits toted along by the group of 8. One slip on a rock, bang of the head and slide into and under water at the dock was an eventful experience for one of our guys. No major injuries thank goodness. I think we set a new record for most rods broke in week with 3…….one of which was yours truly(and my favorite walleye rod for the past 10’ish years). One 3 month old $250+ St Croix rod also snapped off about 4” from the tip. The other was an Ugly stick I believe.Box fans were our savior once again as the cabins warmed significantly throughout the sunny warm days. Drawing outside evening air into the cabins made sleeping tolerable.Flights in and out were good and on time. $400 in overwweight expense for the group of 8 didn’t slow us although we do miss the fly in beverages early option that is no longer available (and cost us $400 extra). Camp/Cabins were good with a flush toilet in main gathering cabin….. need to replace few screens in windows but other than that everything was in order. Boats and motors could stand some upgrades. Several boats leaked and created mini-aquariums in the bottom so thank goodness for warm weather as having feet in water all week was a bit of a nuisance. Motors were a mix of 8 hp, 9.9 hp and 15 hp………we thought we were getting all 15 hp motors but oh well we survived. Again, great times with great friends and good fishing made for a great week. I must say I do miss 60-70 degree highs and 40-50 lows. With that said consistent weather is key to solid fishing.Until next year (or maybe later this year)!!!!Good luck to those of you still heading up this Summer!"
6739241,Net_Man,2023-05-17 08:05:00,580,"Wright Lake - Has anyone been in to Kaminiskag lake connected to Wright Lake? To access you need to drive a bit of distance through a small river. We did it in the summer and had to get out of the boat once or twice to get through thin water. At least no rocks that I recall.... Once we located the fish they were plentiful and a lot in the 20"" to 23"" range. Worth the trip if you like a small adventure."
6739243,Net_Man,2023-05-17 08:06:00,580,Clarks - It was unfortunate that people had to push back hard for them to do the right thing and allow rollovers of deposits. A lot of Covid was unpleasant.....
6739291,Eckohlt,2023-05-17 12:09:00,3685,"Lots of u turns in that creek going to kam,can you get to sprout lake from wright???"
6739323,SweetD,2023-05-17 14:24:00,243,You can get to Kam relatively easily but it takes awhile as it is very curvy as noted and depending on water levels and downed trees may require some creative navigation. Granite Boss usually requires a pull over a beaver ****. Strout generally requires a wade through jagged rocks. I would personally stick to Wright and Kam as the two primary targets. Most of my larger Walleye and Pike have come from those two bodies of water!!! Good LuckPS Dont overlook “The Point” on a good NNW blow!!!
6739355,Net_Man,2023-05-17 18:26:00,580,I had to look at the map just to come up with the Kam name. I am not sure what/where Sprout lake is. It is not listed on the map on Clarks site (wright Map) that I seen.
6739357,Eckohlt,2023-05-17 18:29:00,3685,"Google earth for sprout,it's via a creek,looks like n.e end of wright,never been to wright lake just was asking about sprout lake."
6739393,SweetD,2023-05-17 20:30:00,243,Wright Map. It’s Strout Lake to the NE. Quite an adventure up there.
6739883,kona77,2023-05-20 18:26:00,236,"Wright Lake - Has anyone been in to Kaminiskag lake connected to Wright Lake? To access you need to drive a bit of distance through a small river.

Once we located the fish they were plentiful and a lot in the 20"" to 23"" range. Worth the trip if you like a small adventure.. Our group had great fun in Kaminiskag back in 2019. Average size walleye was in that 20""-23"" range. Did take a pair of waders along and I had to get out of the boat a few times to pull the boat thru some of the spots. Took about 80 minutes to get up that curvy channel. Coming back with the water flow was about an hour. We were not able to make it up to Stroud but hope to next week. The amount of minnows in those channels on both the Kam and Granite Boss portage is amazing. Sweet D- When you say fish "" The Point"" with a Nthwest wind are you referring to that big point between the bays that go into Granite Boss and Kam ???"
6739893,SweetD,2023-05-20 18:46:00,243,"Kona, this point and around into the little bay to the right. This spot when right has produced many many great fish in the 24-28” class. We caught 118 fish in 3-4 hours of fishing one evening with 3 guys. Wright is a fun system to fish. It was my Dad’s favorite……lost him 2 years ago so have some sentimental attachment to this lake and outpost for s"
6740079,kona77,2023-05-21 20:32:00,236,Thanks Sweet.. Yep I know that spot and we only had one day of North winds on our trip and that area was great that day. Glad you have some great memories with your dad at Wright. We fly in this Thursday and it looks like 70's are in the forecast for most of our week. Assume the water will be low so will take some extra time to the portages.
6738683,SweetD,2023-05-13 14:15:00,243,"Anyone have some marked up maps they would be willing to share for the lake? Ideally, someone that had been there during the last week of May or early June. Always nice to have a few of the spots right out of the gate we can count on and then we will go explore like we always do.Also, any of the accessible lakes, rivers worth the travel? We have been to Fawcett and Kapikik and not even sure those are accessible from Gull. Thanks in advance for any intel you all would be willing to share. We go in on Fri, 5/26."
6738695,Net_Man,2023-05-13 16:10:00,580,North Gull early in the season has been on my list but I have not made it there early. I believe the camp is located right at a incoming river mouth. Current should be key this time of year. There is also a lot of incoming moving water to the NE towards Zion. You have direct boat access to Fawcett but unless you are up for a full week I am not sure it is worth the drive to explore. There is a channel area towards the north leading to Zion which should be good this time of year if you have time.There should be a group fishing before you. This is a remote trip and I have never met a outgoing group not willing to share information.
6738701,SweetD,2023-05-13 17:19:00,243,"Yeah, been to Fawcett and Kapikik. We are first in at North Gull this year so no one to rely on for a recent hotspot. We will certainly get intel from Clark’s and maybe the South Gull crew if there is someone in there week prior. Fish I’m sure will be generally shallower. We have fished this time of year many times in the past. Weather, wind and 4-12’ will likely dictate but if anyone has that magical spot at Gull we are all years!!!Thanks and good luck to all headed North this year!!!!"
6738745,Net_Man,2023-05-14 08:16:00,580,"Wow, I am surprised that they do not have a group in for opener. I would love to be there then but I have other commitments. I have been to Fawcett approx. 4 times with all but one in the summer. The one opener trip was just a short 3 day trip and we only fished in Fawcett. There is major outflow in the most southeast section of Fawcett but my limited experience around opener was very poor in this area. This outflow is relatively close to the Clark's Fawcett outpost camp. This spring trip we had spent most of our time on the north side in Fawcett towards Zion but this area is a long boat ride from where you are staying.I have only been in North Gull area for several days during the summer. I have never been up by the river next to the cabin but it should be a good area in spring. On one trip in the summer we made a loop from Fawcett through North Gull, up through Zion and back in to Fawcett. It was quite a long trek and we did not spend much time in Zion. There was however a ton of moving water coming in from Zion to North Gull which should be a hotspot in early spring. With the amount of water moving from the north I would guess that there is also some outlet in South Gull but I have never been in this area.The river next to the North Gull cabin as well as the incoming water towards Zion should be primary areas. As a secondary area I would also look at where North Gull connects to Fawcett. This is not that long of a boat ride from the North Gull Cabin. This is a necked down area. I believe that there is more water flowing out of Fawcett than what is coming in to Fawcett from Zion. There has to be water coming in to Fawcett from North Gull which should create current in this necked down area.What fun"
6738851,kona77,2023-05-15 07:05:00,236,Sweet D- Our group was thinking about North Gull for this year but decided to go back to Wright Lake at the end of May. I am sure the Clarks can provide some good spots to start but I would agree that river channel next to the camp should be really good early. Hope your group has a great trip and would like to get your feedback on the trip when you get back. Certainly a lot of water to explore at that camp. Good luck!!!
6739005,SweetD,2023-05-15 19:43:00,243,Thanks Kona. We have been to Wright several times in the past and always enjoyed that sytstem and the surrounding lakes. Good LuckPS- if you get a decent blow from the North /Northwest go to “The Point”!!!!!!
