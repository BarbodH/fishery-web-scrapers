6742823,Bakefish,2023-06-06 08:18:00,1077,My buddy lost his outdoors card and can't get through on the phone number that is on the website. it just rings and rings no matter how long he sits there. He tried logging in to his account but you need your outdoors card number to do that. He tried to start a new account but it won't let him. Any suggestions?
