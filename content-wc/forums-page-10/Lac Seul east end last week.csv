Fish are still shallow, off the rocks and in the mud, more or less everywhere we stopped. We fish all artificial, cranks/jerks and jig/twister. Went up north west of Taylor’s island today. Lots of slots, some big ones, overall good fishing. Dodged a rainstorm and came off early, otherwise we’d still be out there. Been coming up here since 1991, I was 11 then, now my own kids are learning the waters. Passing the tradition on that my grandfather started in the early 1960’s&#x1f919;&#x1f3fb;"
