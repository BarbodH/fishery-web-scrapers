6742743,prov1800,2023-06-05 17:31:00,5010,Got out yesterday for my first guide day.Been a while since covid that I fished the east end of Eagle out of North Shore lodge.Was in a private boat and didn't have my sonar/gps unit.Really don't need it and found lots of active walleye spots and bass spots to keep my guests busy all week.Nothing bigger than eaters.Even did my first shorelunch Bit rusty but went good.Fishing was amazing especially the bass fishing which is on &#x1f525;. Weather was a bit on the hot side and very calm so we could actually sight fish.
