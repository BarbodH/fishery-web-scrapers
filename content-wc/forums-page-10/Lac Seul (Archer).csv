The best was 20 years ago a group was on big v, ran Johnson’s narrows and took off their lower unit 150 Johnson. The next day they rented a 15hp Johnson four stroke. Apparently they had the same fuel line to motor connection. Didn’t mix the gas, they went by us just a few miles west of deception launch, motor grinding and howling away. Locked it right up with no mixed gas. Someone towed them in, we got back to camp and they packed their stuff and headed him three days into an 8 day vacation. Anyways, todays fishing was good, young narrows and Webster area. Some saugers, plenty of eyes, northerns ran small today. (We fish for whatever). Cleaning up camp, and having a gigantic fish fry and steak dinner tonight Hope to be back up within the month. Try to make it once a month for the open water season &#x1f919;&#x1f3fb;"
6742677,ivesdd,2023-06-05 10:12:00,1,Heading up to Lac Seul for our annual trip next week! Anyone been up toward Archer? Wondering how the water level is and water temp. Thanks!
6742847,Lac Seul John,2023-06-06 11:17:00,31,Never heard of Archer. What lodge are you going to?
6742859,JDP,2023-06-06 12:12:00,1457,See attached for possible Archer location.
6742873,Lac Seul John,2023-06-06 12:33:00,31,That answers my question! Looks like a great location
6742943,pjshorthorn,2023-06-07 01:29:00,5654,"Looked at my full lake map of Lac Seul and Archer Lake is primarily 10-20 ft water at normal levels. My guess, with lower water levels this year, it is going to be pretty skinny water getting into the lake. There is a pretty good neck down from Sen Bay going into Archer so there is no telling. I bet it would be a beautiful journey though finding out. PjShorthorn"
6743071,PRO-V16,2023-06-07 13:27:00,454,I've been into Archer Lake several times over the years. I doubt it will be a problem getting in there.
6743343,Megatron,2023-06-08 22:12:00,13,"Long time reader, first time responder Currently on the east side, using the Hudson launch this week. Water levels have come up since memorial weekend. No problem shooting the rags etc etcHeading up towards Taylor and McLean narrows tomorrow. Fishing been good. Slots and overs today"
6743349,pjshorthorn,2023-06-09 03:38:00,5654,"Enjoy, Taylor was the first place I ever fished in Canada 40 years ago. Tent camped on the Island. That was as far up the lake that we knew how to get to we ran out details with our paper map .We only had one section of the lake from the MNR. LOL PjShorthorn"
6743395,Megatron,2023-06-09 08:44:00,13,"Pounded the fish with crank/jerk bait more then jigging this week so far Most fish found off wind blown shorelines, shallow bays and weed edges. Will give a report on up the lake once we return. Blew the motor in my boat, currently renting one from moose horn Only a matter of time until each one of us has a catastrophic failure &#x1f919;&#x1f3fb;"
6743597,eyecatcher1,2023-06-10 10:17:00,323,I had been going up there and running the lakes for 30 years without an incident. Usually two or three times a season. Last year with the high water I took out my lower unit. The guys at Mascotto's in town were out of lower units because with the high water they replaced more lower units than they ever do with normal or low water because the high water made everything look so different.
