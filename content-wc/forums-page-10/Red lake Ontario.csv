6742347,kettyspanky,2023-06-03 06:07:00,271,I just got invited on a trip to red lake at the end of june. Staying at a private cabin I guess. Any info for spots or patterns for that time of year would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance. I'm trying to learn some info on this lake. The guy's I'm going with went last year and did okay on walleye.

6743249,stevensinks,2023-06-08 12:24:00,330,We have fished Red Lake 12-15 times. Always caught plenty of fish and had a great time. We go to Bow Narrows clear at the west end. Do you know what part you will on?
6743273,kettyspanky,2023-06-08 15:39:00,271,Not yet. I'm meeting with the guys this weekend. 2 guys went last year for the first time. I just got invited along last minute.
6743747,LoDo,2023-06-11 06:56:00,721,I've been on the west end of Red Lake since June 2. I leave June 17. The fishing has picked up immensely since June 2. Walleyes are not schooled up yet. Big girls patrolling the muddy flats. Highly recommend focusing on wind blown areas. Weather the past 10 days has been warmer than normal. AM bite seems to be better than PM bite. Focus on points within a 1/4 mile of spawning inlets. Best of luck! Four 26 walleyes 44 northern 34 trout Walleye will be beaten before we leave.
