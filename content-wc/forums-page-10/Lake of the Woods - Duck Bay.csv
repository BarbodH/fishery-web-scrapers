We usually fish earlier before they move off the shallows. What depth and structure should I be looking at?Thanks in advance"

6743601,Obabikon,2023-06-10 10:50:00,2370,"Walleye are pretty scattered right now. Post spawn staging, and feeding heavily on mayflies already. That heat wave kind of screwed up some normal timelines. Anyhow: try some channels and bottoms of reefs. The guys have been catching them from 8' all the way down to 30'."
