6743213,AlSnodgrass,2023-06-08 09:32:00,3,Coming through the border in the near future. Are there any grocery or food restrictions of items not allowed to cross the border? We’ve been in years past and it can change - we’ve had to toss eggs and potatoes before. Just wanting to know in advance. Thanks.
