6743027,NWBearcatgrad,2023-06-07 09:56:00,36,"It has been YEARS since I crossed there, but compared to other crossings it was the easiest and fastest. My buddies and I had 2 vehicles and one boat. We were across in less than 5 min. We only saw one other truck, which was entering US instead of going into Canada. It is not the fancy, bells and whistles crossing like Pembina or Fort Francis...or at least it wasn't then. The road scenery was pleasant, and 2 lanes. Had to go slow in a few places pulling trailer/boat but nothing awful bad. We went that way to Shoal Lake on one of my first trips up north."
6743035,skap,2023-06-07 10:26:00,58,Pass through there a couple times a year. Quick stop and have never waited more than a few minutes. Its not a major point of entry compare to Ifalls or Thunder Bay. Its basically a big garage. You should have no issues. Good luck!

6743317,lassh,2023-06-08 18:44:00,553,"Thanks for the replies. We are not going that way now. We were going to pick someone up in Baudette and then go on to Bissett, but that plan has changed."
