6743117,Pooch,2023-06-07 18:36:00,4618,Already?!?!?!?! Hokismokes. At least a couple weeks early?Pooch
6743157,Limeyangler,2023-06-07 22:39:00,563,"Yeah, a couple weeks for sure. It's usually a 50/50 chance they will be out there on the weekend of the Walleye Masters on or around 20th June. I pulled up on a reef yesterday for a look' and saw a ton of bait, was pulling nice eaters and up to 21ers from 20' -25' , was pleasantly surprised!"
6743173,Pooch,2023-06-08 06:09:00,4618,"Our growing season here in Central Illinois is about two weeks ahead of normal. Peonies rarely bloom prior to Memorial day, but were in full bloom mid May and fading rapidly and finished by Memorial Day.Trees put out buds early and were fully leaved out a good two weeks early. Now we are bone dry and crops just hanging on getting desperate for rain. Our yards are brown and normally we are mowing yards twice a week all spring. Feels and looks like a hot and dry August.Weird season so far.Pooch"
