We were at Wright in late May in 2019 and had snow/sleet the first day and north/northeast winds for many days. Needless to say the weather was a big change for us. South winds and 70's every day certainly had the fish in different parts of the lake. Water temps were 49-51 degrees to start the trip and were in the 60's (as high as 68-70 in shallow bays) at the end of the trip. Hit many of out ""hot spots"" from 2019 first 1-2 days but quickly changed to south facing shorelines. Fish were a bit more scattered the first few days and we would catch 5-15 fish in a spot and then have to move on. That changed and over the last 3-4 days we could cover the same spot and catch nice eye's for extended periods of time. Back in 2019 we had a challenge catching ""eaters"" on the main lake and would focus on the river system behind the cabin. This year we did find all sizes on the main lake but we did end up catching a lot of 18""-22"" on the main lake. 24"" walleye's were our biggest fish (5-6 of them) along with numerous 23"". South wind also resulted in some great dock fishing several nights which is always a nice way to end a day. 5 guys in our group and one guy focused a lot on trolliing/casting for gators. Finding larger gators was a challenge in the early part of the trip but we ended up catching 21 over 30"" the last 2-days and had 34 over 30"" for the trip. Largest was a giant 42.5"" on the last day. Had numerous others between 35""-40"" and saw at least two other 40"" fish that we could not get in the boat.Water levels were a bit higher than 2019 and we were able to fish both portage lakes. Granite Boss was on fire for the two days we made the trip. Lots of 17""-20"" walleye's and lot's of gators but nothing big. The trip up to Kag was much easier. In 2019 I had waders along and pulled boat thru certain sections and it took over an hour. This trip was 35 minutes and never had to get out of the boat. Fishing was a bit slower on Kag for walleye's but we did get 4 gators over 30"". With the hot fishing on Granite Boss we only made the one trip to Kag. Tried to get up to Stroud Lake but could not get past the shallow rapids. Several guys in the group took advantage of the Ice Road that goes between the two portage lakes to stretch their legs and see some wildlife. One of the neat/side things to do was to sit on the bridge going into Granite Boss and see gators hunting the hordes of minnows swimming around. Could sometimes see up to 15-20 gators come in to feed. We were the first group at Wright this year and we ran into a generator issue after the first night. Called the Clarks the next morning and they flew in another generator the same day. Great service from their team!!! Just a great week of fishing and another great trip with the Clarks. We are booked again for 2024 and may take a Sept. trip yet this year. Good fishing to all !!"
