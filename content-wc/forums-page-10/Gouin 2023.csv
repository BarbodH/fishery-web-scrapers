6736923,Phillypat,2023-05-04 13:34:00,12,Are you familiar with the camp? How is fishing at the end of June? I did the opener in 2019 and the weather sucked as did the fishing. Last year we did the June 10th and found better weather and better fishing. This year we wanted to do 2nd-3rd week of June but those were already booked.
6737043,tweedrules,2023-05-05 10:03:00,107,"No sorry not little gouin. We have been to the old Cesars lodge that Oliver's father owned. Was trout only with Pike and Walleye lakes around the outskirts. We have been to: Lake Impossible and are familiar with Lake Simard and Super (Natow). Your fishing will be AWESOME. Have a great time. If this is your first time, email me and I'll send you our check list. [email protected]"
6737045,tweedrules,2023-05-05 10:11:00,107,We found June to be perfect. July and August were too hot. We are end of June because we are all teachers.
6742061,Phillypat,2023-06-01 10:05:00,12,"Has anyone been out on the lake yet this year?How are water levels, temperature, and of course the fishing!?"
6742635,clegg,2023-06-05 04:29:00,38,"Just got back from the Gouin. Our trip was cut short because of the ongoing forest fires in the area. They had to evacuate the camp. You should check with your outfitter but it doesn’t look too good for the time being. Entrances to parent were closed. The air is a little hazy and you can smell the smoke. As for the fishing, water temperatures are in the high 60s. Levels are a little low. Unfortunately Fishing wasn’t great this year."
