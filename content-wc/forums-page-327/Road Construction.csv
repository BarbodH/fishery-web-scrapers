We come up from the Chicago area, and take 90/94/39 up to Eau Claire, then 53 to the border, and then the lovely 502 to Dryden. Are there any wicked construction zones that are going to put a slow down on our trip? Thanks to all with information. Tight lines!"

Less of a delay/inconvenience for us this year-the work did not interfere with traffic for us. No major issues between Cloquet and 494/94, but perhaps a five minute slow down once we got to the Twin Cities near the 94 exit. Detour south of Rochester/Stewartville on Highway 63 sends you back west a few miles and then south. All in all, we experienced very few delays. No wait at the border crossing into Canada and perhaps five or ten minutes wait to cross back."
