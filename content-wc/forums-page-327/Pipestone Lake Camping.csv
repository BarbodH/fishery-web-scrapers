I would like to make a long run up to the North end of Pipestone/Schistose. Curious if I could set up camp there for a night to maximize my time. There are not any designated camping sites which doesnt bother me, I was thinking I would just find an island with a place to land a boat. Is there any rules against this? 1. Has anyone fished North pipestone and is it even worth the ride? Targeting bass and walleye. Maybe Muskie? 2. Could anyone suggest places to fish, techniques, etc. Thanks,"
1550227,GNO,2013-03-11 20:50:00,153,Pipestone is in the green zone and no non resident camping is allowed. Mid lake reefs are best that time of year.

Very pretty area, had good luck on trout in Schistose, caught a nice muskie from the campsite shore. After working all day and driving all night, as a first timer to the lake, only got lost once on the way to the island. Bill Krejca"

1550447,camp chef,2013-03-12 09:57:00,915,It is worth the ride.

The fishing on Pipestone is a lot better than the bottom of the chain in my opinion. You have more species to target, plus there is little to no boat traffic, so you have a lot of fishing spots all to yourself."
1551106,tyson2925,2013-03-13 09:57:00,95,"I appreciate the responses. Glad to hear the fishing is worth the boat ride. Too bad that camping is not allowed. We will probably just make a day trip out of it for the first try and go from there.So if I make a day trip where would you recommend to try for Bass and Walleye. I have heard of the gates ajar area. I see a ""line bay"" ""James Bay"" ""Watson Bay"" Thompson Bay and then the north arm.Looking for bass, walleye, pike with maybe an outside shot at a musky.Thanks,"

1551159,camp chef,2013-03-13 11:17:00,915,We had good fishing in those areas.
