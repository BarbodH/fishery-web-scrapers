2859209,acplumber,2014-06-02 18:13:00,80,"We ate at the motel in town that we stayed at aux trios moulins It was awesome, Good portions and tasted great I would eat there again"
2859425,HTHM,2014-06-02 19:10:00,41,"Now be careful that is Canadian beer you are talking about, why not pick some up at the beer store and have it when you arrive at your hotel?"
2859489,Mike Borger,2014-06-02 19:34:00,1554,I've stayed in Chapleau a bunch of times and the safest course of action is to grab a bucket of KFC (on your right just as you enter town) and take it back to the motel.There's not a bad little restaurant that's open super early for breakfast though. Can't remember the name but Chapleau is a small town.
