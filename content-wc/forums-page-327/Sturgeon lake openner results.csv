Fished Rusty Meyers area first 2 days with good luck on big fish. Saturday thru yesterday fished northeast arm with great results. BIG walleyes. Hard to catch anything under 21 inches with most 24 to 31 inches. Bad problem right. Lol. My dad and father in law thought so. Ran out of minnows most days and used Northland Mimic Minnows on a glow jig and did not miss a beat. Pics soon."
