2805425,Cumminsram2010,2014-05-17 13:40:00,396,I am pretty sure between the two of us we will figure out something that works.

2843769,reconssd,2014-05-29 05:26:00,147,"I have been fishing Lake Michigan for over 30 years for salmon. About 15 years ago, I decided to take up to Canada some large j-plugs, a couple dipsey divers, and one dipsey rod. The pike fishing with j-plugs is incredible. Pike don't see this presentation very often. Take a j-plug being trolled off a deep weed line with its darting action, and hang on! The only down side to this presentation is holding the fishing rod while you are trolling. The amount of torque on the rod is substantial. I've yet to find a decent clamp on rod holder that can handle that level of resistance. You can run everything behind a dipsey diver; bucktails, stickbaits, spoons, or plastics."

2864257,Walleye Wanderer,2014-06-03 21:25:00,101,Totally agree with the Johnson Silver Minnow & twister tail. A Williams Wabler Silver Nu-Wrinkle spoon with a siwash hook installed and a twister tail work great too!
2800689,Cumminsram2010,2014-05-16 05:40:00,396,Small top raiders work wonders. I have a black and orange one that has had to be repaired 3 times sofar because of the abuse it has taken.

2801817,adempsey,2014-05-16 09:44:00,963,That looks like a really good list to me. I'd probably add on a Bunny Strip fly and an Eppinger Red Eye Wiggler/Lucky Strike Bug Eye spoon. Of course my five of diamonds must be a Len Thompson though =)

What is the difference between the two? Do they have slightly different actions or are they basically the same, because after Google searching for pic of a Len Thompson, it looks just like a Daredevle to me."
2802113,MN_Moose,2014-05-16 10:55:00,964,"Not my quote but from Bow Narrows blog, ""What makes Len Thompsons so much better than many rival spoons is shown in the photo of the undersides. These spoons are made of thick brass. This makes them heavier for their size than a steel spoon; so, they run deeper -- down in the strike zone.""http://bownarrows.blogspot.com/2010/...-thompson.html"

2802873,Bassmandpe,2014-05-16 14:01:00,42,A lot of good Pike suggestions. One that I did not see is something I learned years ago fishing for Florida Bass. Certain times of the year a rattle trap style bait works well in Florida. So I started taking some of them to Canada years ago in Gold & Black back and Silver with a blue back. We would have Pike Tournaments at the Lodge with the Guides and the Rattle traps would kick butt. I take the trebles off and put conservation style hooks on them for easy releases. Use the 1/2 oz size. Tried the bigger ones but did not work as well. Found gold with a black back the best in the stained Canada waters of the White River area. Give em a try!
2803537,Cumminsram2010,2014-05-16 18:31:00,396,All of this fishing talk has got me excited I can't wait to leave! Friday at 8am is D-day for me.
2804001,adempsey,2014-05-16 20:52:00,963,"The Len Thompson spoons are a different shape and thickness. Although Eppinger makes so many types of spoons these days, they probably have something similar.Does it really matter? I doubt it. It's just that the original Five of Diamonds was made by Len Thompson. They are about half the price of a similar Dardevle around here too. I also like they are a Canadian company.Nothing wrong with Eppinger spoons at all either. I own a bunch!I'd probably be using some Yellowbird Doctor spoons if I could find some around here."
2797169,Bakefish,2014-05-15 07:18:00,1077,Gotta go with swimbaits and bass type spinner baits.
2797369,rocko0305,2014-05-15 07:55:00,138,"Personally, I would have to go with the following in order as my favorite:1.) 7 inch Zoom Mag Fluke - White Pearl or White Ice2.) 1 1/8 oz. Johnson Silver Minnow with Uncle Josh Ripple Rind in White as a trailer3.) 5 1/4 or 6 inch Williams Whitefish in Half & Half Nu-Wrinkle (1/2 Gold and 1/2 Silver)4.) 1/2 oz. or 3/4 oz. White or White/Chartreuse Spinnerbait5.) 6 or 7 inch Lunker City Slug-Go - Albino Shad6.) 4 inch B Fish N Tackle Moxi on a 1/4 oz. jig head - Great White 7.) 3.5 inch B Fish N Tackle Pulse-R on a 1/4 oz. jig head - Great White 8.) 1 or 1 1/2 oz. Eppinger Original Daredevle Spoon - Red/White or 5 of Diamonds9.) 4 3/4 inch (XR12) Rapala X-Rap - Glass Ghost10.) 4 3/4 inch Rapala Balsa Xtreme (BX) Swimmer - FiretigerBut nothing beats a simple jig and minnow/twister tail while walleye fishing or as a quick follow-up lure, which I why last year I fell in love with #6 and #7 above. I was able to catch both walleye and pike on the B Fish N Tackle swimbait plastics on a ML rod and reel."
2797441,zeebee,2014-05-15 08:10:00,1144,Kitchen sink.Pike will hit just about anything. The best lure is the one in front of their nose. The trick is to find where the big boys are hangin out. The lure is largely incidental.
2797497,rocko0305,2014-05-15 08:17:00,138,"Can't argue too much with that, but is fun finding your new and favorite lures that are fun to cast and work back on the retrieve."
2797713,rockape,2014-05-15 09:01:00,215,"The BIGGER the better. Big rubber swimbaits rule. You can't beat a Pearson Grinder or a Slopmaster. I have to get new Slopmasters all the time because they beat the crap out of them. The biggest X-Rap you can get your hands on is total money too. Nothing better than fishing clear water and seeing a big gator checking out your bait in suspend mode, twitch it, and watch the gator come unglued! Can't wait to wrestle them in 3 weeks!"

2799825,forgop,2014-05-15 20:03:00,880,This year I'm going to bring some topwater spinnerbaits to throw out near the weed beds. Last year I had a pike grab something that I had litearlly reeled up to the surface and getting ready to pull up. Cool stuff to watch.

2795729,Cumminsram2010,2014-05-14 18:13:00,396,"Another thing with me espically is that I love fishing out of the box. What I mean by that is I like throwing baits out of the norm, for example most of you guys like the spinner /spoons typical of pike fishing. That's all good of course and productive as well. But I love throwing something that the fish have never seen before to me I think it gives me a little better chance at a trophy. This could be just me of course but I am a firm beliver in throwing what you have confidence in. I belive if you have confidence in a bait you will throw it more efficiently and work it more effictivly. However I also think you shouldn't hesitate to try new baits that's why I am curious as to what you guys are throwing. I have one idea this year I am taking a bunch of my salmon trolling spoons up with me and going to try casting the shallows with them I think since they are so thin and light they will work great. Not to mention I have patterns that those fish have never seen before. Something about them being so light also leads me to think they will be great since I can work them a lot slower than a daredevil."
2795889,yoopertrout,2014-05-14 18:49:00,1172,What size do you use?
2796025,Richard B,2014-05-14 19:13:00,735,"I have used the 7"", 9"", and the 10"" suicks depending on the water. 7"" more open water with small amounts of grass. The 9"" and 10"" in heavier cover, casting to the side not into the reeds. I feel the bigger lure worked on the outside of the growth pulls them better than the smaller ones. Toss them out and let the ripples subside. Then the first jerk I do is light. I have had many 10 to 15 pounders slam it as soon as the lure pops back to the surface. After the first jerk I mix it up between hard pulls and softer pulls, almost like the stop and go of a crank bait but at much slower rate. Every once in a while mix it up and let the lure come back to the surface and just sit. I caught my biggest pike doing that, 43 1/2"", yes I released it. For the 9"" and 10"", I use a muskie rod with 50# braid. The 7"" I use a 6 1/2' medium heavy with 17# mono."
2796073,nitroman,2014-05-14 19:22:00,368,Red Eye wobbler! Like pike candy. Terminator spinners in white they take a lot of abuse but bring extra willow blades and skirts.

2796249,Cumminsram2010,2014-05-14 19:53:00,396,Throw it out count it down to about a foot above the bottom then slow pumps of the rod from about 8oclock to 12 o'clock. That's my favorite retrieve for dawgs granted I usually throw the pounder size but they all work the same.

I am a avid musky fisherman and I would like to think that a lot of the smaller glide baits and jerk baits would be good early season say under 8""? This year I am going to try out the large size glidin rap I got three one in golden shiner(looks like walleye) one in white perch and one in hot steel. I would think early season would be prime time for jerks/glide baits. We are headed up to the chapleau area next Friday for a week so let's hear your favorites."

Depending on how heavy a head you rig them on, they can be fished slow on the surface, jigged on the bottom, or swim then at any speed at any depth. I also LOVE that they only have one big hook (not those finger-destroying trebles) that sticks UP .... which means it rarely gets caught on rocks or in weeds."
