2841009,Ranger319,2014-05-28 10:18:00,166,From the webcam pics i've seen it appears that the water is quite high
2841425,BenBeattie,2014-05-28 11:55:00,232,Its really high. Pelican is higher than I've ever seen it. Haven't been on Minnitaki this year but I'm sure it's way higher than normal too. Lac Seul is also high for this time of year. Lots of water this year!
2843321,RapShad,2014-05-28 21:03:00,76,Check out fishredpine.com they have a webcam that updates constantly. It shows batam lake which is fed by minnitaki only a couple miles away. The water level is as high as I have ever seen. Should be smooth sailing through The Chutes for the next month or so just based off the ice out.
2843329,RapShad,2014-05-28 21:05:00,76,Sorry I meant Abram Lake. Autocorrect on my iPhone strikes again!
2844433,WalleyeRip,2014-05-29 08:21:00,44,"Troy or Ben, do you know where we are on the spawn in Minnitaki and or the present water temps? Will be up tomorrow. Thanks Rip"
2844617,BenBeattie,2014-05-29 09:02:00,232,I can't comment on Minnitaki I only fish Lac Seul for walleye this time of year.
2847281,Troy Mansfield,2014-05-29 23:49:00,22,Super high water. Cold temps. But warming quickly. Was pretty good fishing at moonlight and sand river. Most walleyes are in the shallows or current. Caught walleye as shallow as 4ft in the weeds and as deep as 26ft. Spawn is mostly over. Water temps today were between 56 -62F depending where you were. I th√Ænk they started to transition a little out of moonlight falls but I think there will be another wave of fish coming in there. Most we caught were in the slot and over and seemed to die out. Visually it's good for a few more weeks. But the arm should be the warmest water around so I would think it to be pretty good fishing in the arm itself
2852849,scar,2014-05-31 20:56:00,196,Possibly record high!Got back last Monday (Memorial day) Ice went out the monday prior so we had to cancel the opening weekend. The chutes are all one level.Our permanent dock is over 2 feet under the water! fishing memorial day weekend was not good. We put on lots of miles and fished likely May spots and only one spot produced but still slow. Even went to Red Pine Bay (catch and release only unit June 15) thinking we could at least catch fish there 2 boats and 1 walleye in two hours even in Red Pine!
2863969,pickeralarm,2014-06-03 20:18:00,16,Best fishing right now up there is right off the end of the dock at Winoga Lodge. Biggest walleye I have ever seen.
2726073,Shotgun,2014-04-26 10:19:00,759,"Headed to Minnitaki in seven weeks and have been searching the internet for information on anticipated water level, i.e., high, low, normal, etc... Anyone have any insight on this subject for this year would be appreciated."
2726665,bigwalleye1,2014-04-26 15:17:00,2632,"Nothing current with my eyeballs, but you can at least do a check on water levels in the system at www.lwcb.ca"
2726745,jimmie,2014-04-26 15:42:00,123,I'll be there in 8 1/2 weeks myself. It should be high even when we arrive as they had a tremendous snow amount this winter. I have seen it so high that one had to throttle way up to get up the Abram Chutes without going backwards. I cpl years ago I also saw it where there wasn't a trickle coming down the Chutes on the left side coming from Abrams but could still be navigated. It seems that the walleyes like normal levels or a bit lower than high water. The weather has been off so much from what we expect the last cpl years that it has been hard to find the fish right off. Just remember they are somewhere. Just put another message on WC a week before you go up to check things out someone will have been on the water enough to give you a better idea. Good luck and have fun! Jim
2730081,prov1800,2014-04-27 17:46:00,5010,"As with most of our lakes here they all have a tendency to get low as we head into fall, fished right into October last fall on minitaki and abram and levels were still pretty high as compared to the previous fall.the place I stay at on abram when I go ice fishing that floating dock dock seemed pretty low as I could tell from its angle, but as normal everything should come right back up with some of the runoff from this winter.should be all good."
2740146,Troy Mansfield,2014-04-29 22:05:00,22,"There will be no shortage of water. But right now there is still 18"" ice on minnitaki It's raining here right now and is calling for rain the next few days. I think it'll be out for opener"
2740682,Shotgun,2014-04-30 07:15:00,759,"Thanks for the feedback. I get a little concerned each year as the camp we fish out of has a shallow canal you need to travel through to get to the main lake. One year in the past the water level was so low we had to troll through these areas with the main motor raised up. Appears water level will be ok, just may need some heavy clothes to stay warm. Have a good day!"
2741465,prov1800,2014-04-30 09:43:00,5010,"Just need to bring it all, you never know what your in for up here."
2741497,prov1800,2014-04-30 09:46:00,5010,Be nice to get into a boat eh troy.
2765993,Troy Mansfield,2014-05-07 02:45:00,22,"I can't wait to get into a boat and rip some lips, been way to long a winter up here"
2840249,Sportfisher,2014-05-28 07:09:00,47,"Any updates on this? We are leaving for Donnellys in 17 days, and looking for info on water levels, the bite and any other info on Lake Minnitaki. Thanks Sportfisher"
