If you are flyin out with Nakina Air from Cordingley, it is surprising how far the drive from Geraldton to Cordingley is. The rooms at the Shores were great and you know the price. BTW wht is the Nugget ask for a room? Just for future reference...you nvr know"
2855329,stillangling,2014-06-01 18:07:00,149,"25 years or so ago when I was newly married, my wife and I broke down in Geraldton with our 76 Ford. The guys at the garage said ""in spite of what the names would suggest, avoid the golden nugget and stay at the Silver Nugget."" I took their advice. Spent the whole night clinging to my wife because the mattress was collapsed on my side. Would have rolled out on to the floor otherwise! Brought back some old memories to hear the name again. Sure hope they upgraded since I was there. Arguably the worst hotel I have ever stayed at but that was a long time ago."
2855409,Carnhzkr,2014-06-01 18:22:00,964,"Thanks, stillangling. I drive a Ford too, but mine's a 2012. Just in case, is your wife available as an anchor so I don't roll out of the bed?"
2855433,stillangling,2014-06-01 18:25:00,149,"She said ""nice"" but I suspect you wouldn't have liked the tone or look."
2845473,Carnhzkr,2014-05-29 12:47:00,964,"I have about a 14 hour drive to Nakina on August 2nd. I was thinking I might want to overnight in Geraldton to cut off one hour of drive time the night before meeting the flight out in Nakina. When I asked my outfitter about places to stay, he only recommended the two hotels in Nakina and said he couldn't recommend any of the hotels in Geraldton. I asked about The Silver Nugget in Geraldton and he hinted that they have had bed bugs there. Just thought I'd check with folks on WC. Can anyone recommend a clean hotel in Geraldton? Otherwise, I'll drive the last hour and stay at R & D Apartments in Nakina. That one looks okay."
2845649,rocko0305,2014-05-29 13:35:00,138,"I believe the hotel we stayed at last year, and will be staying at again this year (tomorrow night actually!) is the Silver Nugget in Geraldton. We didn't have any issues and it served us the same exact purpose that you are considering. The nice thing about staying in Geraldton is that if you get there with enough daylight you can drop a line in the water at Kenogamisis Lake, which is a great lake to fish from shore. Also, the best part is that the 1 hour drive to Nakina in the early morning hours usually provides an awesome opportunity to see moose, bears, foxes, etc. I haven't stayed at the hotels in Nakina, so I can't speak to how those are, but I have seen others on WC say that they are fine.Headed to Washi Lake for a week in paradise May 31 - June 7. Where are you headed Carnhzkr?"
2845689,Carnhzkr,2014-05-29 13:49:00,964,"My 16 year old son and I are flying in to Bauer's on Onaman Lake. I've only driven to Nakina one other time, a long time ago. I drove that last one hour stretch in the dark and it scared the heck out of me. There are moose ""night danger"" signs everywhere. Around each turn, I could just imagine a big 'ol bull standing in the middle of the road. We did not see any on that trip, but I may have driven past twenty and not even known it."
2845697,rocko0305,2014-05-29 13:52:00,138,I hear you. That is one of the big reasons why we stay in Geraldton. Too many horror stories on this forum about people hitting moose on their way to Nakina. I've read up a little on Onaman when looking into Pasha Lake Cabins. I hear it's an absolute walleye factory. Good luck when your trip comes around!
2847041,eyemike,2014-05-29 21:04:00,233,There is a small motel in Beardmore Roxys or something like that. The only thing I remember about it was it was clean and the T.V. was in French. Beardmore is a little over 50 miles from Garaldton.
2847769,gmattbruin,2014-05-30 06:48:00,174,"our group have stayed in Nakina at Shores Motel(807-329-5265) run by Pennocks, im guessing 10 times and each one has been great. Naturally its not the Marriot but i think we all know no one is goin for that. With a avg size group you are prob paying abt $30/guy. Rooms are clean,showers to start the day and you are abt 5min down the road from Cordingley where most of us fly out from. For the very 1st time when I called to book a cpl rooms this yr they were totally full!! I went on a wait list. Im guess that means 2 things...they are a decent place to stay and word has certainly spread and 2nd, the outfitting business has picked up and is doing ok since our $ has dropped again!"
2850257,Live to jig,2014-05-30 19:18:00,159,"Silver Nugget, stay there every year, clean and never any issues..."
2850273,Carnhzkr,2014-05-30 19:22:00,964,Thanks guys. Two votes for Silver Nugget. That's good enough for me.
2850353,Live to jig,2014-05-30 19:38:00,159,20 Days and we are there!!!
2852129,onetimedave,2014-05-31 15:55:00,502,If you are flying with Nakina Air Service check with them as they have a cabin for rent at the float plane base.
