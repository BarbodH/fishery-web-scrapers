2856353,oldccm,2014-06-02 05:27:00,109,"I agree there's plenty of other options out there, but for Northern MB those prices are the norm."
2856801,MrSimon,2014-06-02 08:01:00,922,"I'm glad places like this exist. Giant fish, great accommodations, excellent foot etc etc etc, all with a monster price tag. There are definitely people looking for places like this, and I'm glad they have a place to go. It kind of reminds me of those high-fence deer preserves where hunters can go and pay through the nose to shoot huge bucks. It ain't my cup of tea, but to each their own. Its funny that you can go to Canada and catch big walleye for as much as $5k for the week, or as little as $500."

I was just talking to some people about this and the beauty is there is something for everyone from drive in to fall off the face of the earth flyin's. You can rough it or be pampered or somewhere in between. You can Hunt, Golf and Fish all on the same trip if you choose. It is wonderful that the choices are virtually endless. have a great year.P.S. if I could afford it I would fish Gunisao in a heartbeat.Thank you,Larry Mac"

The $5k plans are usually 7 day 'American Plan'. Coffee your door 6am, followed by a big breakfast. Walk down to the boat and your off. Sit in a seat while the guide takes you to the best spots on the lake. Not the spots they say are 'the best, but the actual best'. Why? Because unless you have a plane and a canoe tied to the floats you're not going back to steal that spot. These lakes generally have walleye, pike, lake trout, whitefish, arctic grayling to choose from. Also a lot of these lodges offer outpost camps where you can have a guide/cook or depending on the lodge go solo. Drop you off and see you in 7 days. The outposts are usually pretty rustic but will come in at half the cost of the main lodge. These lodges aren't the go every year type because most guys have a boat already with tons of places to go, BUT for that once in a lifetime experience the guys that go see why the dropped big $$. Don't forget, these prices are generally not in stone. Maybe you get a group discount or maybe you're willing to go on 2-3 days notice because someone got sick and just can't make it. Many of these fly in lodges have to charter flights so they pay the same whether there's 25ppl or 30ppl on the flight from Winnipeg. Give them a call, tell them to post your number on the wall and you're willing to go last minute, you might be surprised."
2853825,Perch56,2014-06-01 08:02:00,17,"My wife and I spent 3 days at a new resort because the ice was not out of Lac Suel for our usual trip. My wife got a 31 and I got a29 and two 28's and nearly all others were 22 or larger with the best day being around 80 fish. While we were there there was a 32 caught by another group and nearly 10 others 30 or over!!! Accident northerns of 40,39 and several 36-38. Good food. I recommend Budds Gunisao Lake Lodge for huge walleye."
2854025,port1042,2014-06-01 09:02:00,509,"I returned yesterday (5/31) from Perrault Lake and can attest to large walleyes there too. I watched a guy pull a 31 and a 32 inch fish from the Ord River less than 10 minutes apart. I took a 24 and a 25 from the same hole. We got more big walleyes than ever before. Eaters were also plentiful. Things in the river did start to slow down on Wednesday last week, but we started to pick up some nice fish in the lake. The smallies went on a rampage on Thursday and Friday. We just had a ball with them on Shad Raps and ""salt a pepper"" color tubes. Our biggest northern this year was only 31, but we had lots in the 27 and up slot and had a little trouble getting eaters (22 to 25). Weather was hot and so was the fishing!"
2854713,Kevin R,2014-06-01 13:08:00,305,I thought that was closed to fishing with signs posted did that change ?
2855057,bigdaddyguns,2014-06-01 16:14:00,608,"No. According to the ontario mnr location coordinates, the restricted zone begins 3 miles upstream from where the ord enters perrault. So that section of river is open to angling as of the opener in may."
2855065,port1042,2014-06-01 16:15:00,509,"The sanctuary for Ord River is located well beyond the ""Trapper's Cabin"" probably a mile or more up stream of the entry into Perrault Lake.k That sanctuary will be closed this year until June 14th -- not the normal opening on June 1st."
2855561,DJA,2014-06-01 19:12:00,150,WOW big Fish and Big price Tag
2855721,BuckeyeBill,2014-06-01 20:10:00,76,Really big price tag. WOW !! Out of my league.
2855873,oldccm,2014-06-01 21:03:00,109,"For a fly in the price is quite reasonable. It's big cost to fly 500 miles from Winnipeg to the lodge. There are other northern lodges that are a bit cheaper but require you to drive to places like Thompson, Flin Flon, Snow Lake which are 6-8hrs drive north of Winnipeg yet."
2856257,Skyraptor,2014-06-02 04:25:00,291,"""7-day package $4195 per person"" Way too much for what you get. For that price a person can do other fly-ins and make 2-3 trips for $4195 and still have a good chance to nail a big walleye. It is about quality to me and I can get that at many other lodges for a lower price."
2856289,Walleye507,2014-06-02 05:04:00,193,"I'm of the same opinion. For about the per day price I can do a fully guided trip with lodging, meals, bait and tackle included for 2 days to Devils Lake! And that would include the fuel there and back. Add a bit for the guide tip."
