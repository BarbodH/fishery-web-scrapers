2863521,MikeMcC,2014-06-03 18:20:00,72,I think I will probably need to cross at Ft. Francis border Saturday June 14th. That is not my normal day of the week to cross. Should I anticipate a long wait? How early or late in the day would I need to arrive to avoid a potential lengthy delay? Thank you.
2863593,dutchboy,2014-06-03 18:43:00,5717,Before daylight or after 2pm i would say. Saturday is a bad day. Could you cross friday and just stay in Fort Francis?
2863617,rather-be-fishin,2014-06-03 18:49:00,429,By 9:00 am & line shouldn't be to bad.
2864697,Mr Ranger,2014-06-04 05:37:00,272,We are crossing on Friday the 20th like we always do and usually about 2 - 3PM and then stay in Fort Francis. Last few years there were only about a dozen vehicles or less at the most.
2865073,port1042,2014-06-04 07:11:00,509,"No line at all going into Canada about 2:30pm on Friday, May 23. Back through to the US on Saturday, May 31 about 11:00am. From the time I joined the traffic line it took 18 minutes to be back on the road. Agents both way were pleasant and easy to deal with. No problems."

Much less time waiting crossing on Friday afternoon or evening. Plus you are closer to your walleye spot! 59 days and we will be in Ontario!
2866217,Glenman12,2014-06-04 11:07:00,762,thats the time we shoot for to cross on Fridays but its been a mixed bag as far as the wait time..theres been years when theres only half a dozen cars ahead of us...theres been years when we are about halfway across the bridge and theres been a few years when we've been around the corner on the other side of the tracks with about a 45 mins wait ahead of us..
2866289,JayM5209,2014-06-04 11:22:00,1050,"Saturday, 24th, northbound at 6:00 a.m. - one vehicle ahead of us.Saturday, 31st, southbound at 10:30 a.m. - ten or twelve cars ahead of us in line. But the U.S. side was really running folks through rapidly. From the time we stopped on the bridge at the end of the line until we we pulled away from the booth was less than 10 mins.Personnel on both sides were extremely pleasant and efficient."
