Water temp was around 51 at the start. Fishing started off slow, smallies were beginning to move in gradually and got real active during the week. We got them on everything. Walleye early in the week were scattered and we caught them shallow and deep. Wednesday night we caught 50 small 14"" males in 10-13 fow, the next night we got some bigger ones in 10 ft into the shore line. Then Thursday comes around with the water around 60 and 65 in the bays and we think its gonna be a slaughter fest. Wrong!!! Mayfly hatch and we couldn't catch squat!! Pike fishing wasnt anything special, Cummins lost a nice 40""er and most we got were small. All lakes will have different temps as Windermere right next to us was in the low 40s. Our lake was split in 2, we were lucky enough to be on the shallow side, the other side was low 50s when our side was 55-57 when we went there. All in all it was a good trip. Colors didnt matter, we caught the same amount on hot compared to natural. Caught a couple on leeches but we didn't use them much, our other boat didnt have much luck with minnows n crawlers either. I would say jerk baits did the best, but we also used them the most. Sorry for any spelling mistakes, I'm on my phone and I'm typing a sentence ahead of whats showing. I'll get on later to answer any questions and give more details. Goodluck yall"
