2862833,pastorted,2014-06-03 14:44:00,19,"Life changes and sometimes that affects even the best things. We have been going to Lac Seul about every other year. This would be our trip year, but I Pastor a church and we don't know if we can keep the doors open. Several of the guys are starting families and wives are reluctant for them to be gone that long. Money is tight with gas prices, (we would be driving in from Kentucky). So, with great disappointment we canceled the trip this year. But I am already planning one for next year (2015), and determined to not let anything interfere. When my three boys were young I traveled for business all the time and we never took a Canada fishing trip - nor did my dad ever do that with me and my brother. By the time my boys grew up and left home our relationships weren't as strong and good as I wanted. So, about 16 or 17 years ago I planned our first trip, taking my boys, my dad, my brother and nephew. It was great and those trips played a major role in rebuilding our relationships - to me that is more important than the fishing (but just barely)! There is lots of good fishing to be had here in Kentucky. But, a Canada fishing trip with family or friends is unique and irreplaceable. Looking forward to 2015."
2863065,Carnhzkr,2014-06-03 15:51:00,964,"Well said, pastorted. Canadian fishing trips have always been a way to rekindle or retain family relationships. The one thing my father and I have had in common is our spirit of adventure as it pertains to the Canadian North. We've gone on some real adventures over the years. He's 84 now and beginning to look, if not act, his age. I'll always cherish those memories - both the good and the bad."
2863417,NathanH,2014-06-03 17:39:00,697,"Not going this year might not go back for sometime. I fish MI now Family Cabin on superior, have enjoyed fish walleye, salmon, browns, steelhead, and lakers all at the same time. Big walleye was 14 lbs this year. Get to spend money in small town USA, less drive time costs lower, list goes on."
2863545,stillangling,2014-06-03 18:23:00,149,"The walleye bite is normally very consistent and good at that time of year. Focus on main lake points, use big minnows on fairly heavy jigs and start around 25,' use your sonar and start looking for fish. They will probably be deep - 30 ' plus but the chances of pulling up a real giant are good at that time of year in NW Ontario."
2863657,bigwalleye1,2014-06-03 18:58:00,2632,"Ok, so I had one guy back out on me. Thought ""No biggie. I'll find somebody."" Nada. Zip. Zilch.Called the other boat, thinking they might have a warm body. ""Geez, didn't I tell you? We can't go...."" Holy Sheepsh!t. Go from 3 guys and 2 boats, needing 1 guy to 1 guy and 1 boat, needing 3 guys and a boat, and needing them in literally days, or forfeit the deposit. Long story short, rolled my deposit over to next year, cancelled this year's June trip. If it weren't for having to launch the boat every day, I was almost thinking of going alone. Good news, though. I'm getting a little even. I have a July trip booked at the same lodge, and called to add a day to the July trip. If I add a day here and a day there, I'll pick up the days, but I'll never get back a June trip to God's country. June is my clear favorite vs July, and with the late spring this year, I kno what I'm missing out on"
2501242,Skyraptor,2014-02-28 14:31:00,291,"Not actually going in 2014 during the prime months so will not really be fishing but I'm going to Ontario in October to do a moose hunt with the wife and if all things work out well we should be able to wet a line or two during the week if the hunt goes well and we limit out early. Just not sure on the walleye pattens at that time of year. I'm already planning, gathering and packing stuff for that October trip."
2501778,Skywagon,2014-02-28 16:40:00,1106,Where are you hunting Skyraptor?
2502770,Skyraptor,2014-03-01 02:43:00,291,Going to hunt out of Ghost River Lodge near Sioux Lookout. They only take 3 parties and the tags are limited to a bull per groupf of 2 plus a calf tag. Can't wait!
2502866,Skywagon,2014-03-01 05:53:00,1106,"That will be a fun trip, hunting in that area should be good. You never know what weather October will bring, but catching some days fit to fish are possible. I have never been on that watershed (no experience), but you may need to go deep for walleye at that time."
2533185,reconssd,2014-03-08 19:09:00,147,"Won't be going this year because of babies being born. As for fishing after death, here is this is going to break out. The wife will get half my ashes. My nephews have been instructed to incorporate my ashes in home made custom lures. If i'm lucky the line will break and I will swim off inside a monster northern pike's mouth."
2534521,elway12,2014-03-09 08:52:00,335,Not going for the second straight year! Totally bummed. Lack of finances being the main cause. Hoping for 2015 and to bring my son up for the first time. Atleast WC keeps me up on everyone's great trips.
2540266,1750 FH,2014-03-10 19:05:00,297,4 weddings and a graduation.
2541041,Skywagon,2014-03-11 05:16:00,1106,"I always say the three most painful functions to attend are funerals, graduations and weddings (not necessarily in that order), you are batting 2 out of 3, then to miss fishing...."
2542241,Mike Kansas,2014-03-11 10:13:00,1463,Great idea.
2807385,fishinmedic,2014-05-18 07:52:00,5,Just got the call yesterday that the last man besides me needs to back out. I was literally cooking Chili and starting to get things ready for next week. No trip for me this year. I am in a state of shock right now. Look forward to it as we are driving back the year before.....
2492362,Golden Eagle,2014-02-26 12:09:00,2642,"Would do the same, except I'm all in as a donor and what's left will probably go into a dumpster. Missed only 3 years since 1958, all for good reasons.Seven weeks in Ontario for me in 1960-all sleeping on the ground. Six weeks (3 trips) in 2005. Four weeks several times. Lots for three weeks."
2492386,Pikeslayer8,2014-02-26 12:29:00,1460,"Yup, me too, though the fellas need to bring the jar back. Empty"
2492522,Whopper,2014-02-26 13:03:00,340,"Same thing happen to me a few years back. The week my crew was there without me I was miserable and it didn't help that I received a few reports while they were in camp, thanks to Golden Eagle. My wife even noticed midweek that I had a problem. Since then and in the future I am going to do my best not to miss a trip to NWO"
2492682,sek2691,2014-02-26 13:40:00,15,Where do you drive in to?
2492818,Bill Krejca,2014-02-26 14:19:00,6107,"Yup, me too, I even showed my son a few years ago where to dump the dust! Bill"
2493746,bigwalleye1,2014-02-26 18:14:00,2632,"I just want it simple..off the dock at the landing. Everybody fills the livewells with nice cool water when they launch, and I'll get to ride along to LOTS of places!!!!"
2494322,muskyman73,2014-02-26 21:04:00,402,bill and bigwalleye1 - you guys are so right. I have said the same thing and I would not have it any other way.
2494642,Catman59,2014-02-27 04:32:00,345,X2 ......... I will make my last trip there too .
2497818,forgop,2014-02-27 18:44:00,880,"Last year was my first and I had always assumed taking a full week off this year was far too much to ask of my wife as we have 3 kids that are all in elementary school. I jokingly sent a text yesterday that said I was planning my '14 trip when she asked how I was doing. Her only push back was whether she can take a girls trip with friends somewhere then. (Of course little does she know we fly to a 5 star all inclusive resort in cancun for our 15th anniversary in june that I've already lined up her mom to watch the kids while we're gone) Now that I have a green light, the battle is my boat partner getting married at the end of September. Told him it's the ultimate bachelor party. My brother doesn't have the guts to jokingly ask and have had big following out with the 4th from our group with something non - trip related from the other person in our group. Here's to hoping my cousin takes off his skirt and we have a week slaying the walleyes before getting married."
2500674,vteye,2014-02-28 12:21:00,812,We had our first Ontario fly in last year after 21 hour drive. My brothercan't make this year so plan is 2015. We do at least 2 other long weekendtrips a year within 6 hours of home.
2488081,wallydave,2014-02-25 13:28:00,2151,"After the is anybody going, I wondered if people aren't going to Canada this year and why?"
2488993,Jahloaf,2014-02-25 17:32:00,74,We are not going because all my buddies backed out. Dinger is on secret double duty at work and can't get his vacation approved. Briar is saving his vacation for bow season and Jimmy decided that Vegas was more fun this year.
2489113,Carnhzkr,2014-02-25 17:50:00,964,Screw those guys. You need to find a new group of friends!
2490682,NathanH,2014-02-26 06:44:00,697,"I wont be going this year. Missed last year as with having a baby in April. Wont be going this year because my father wants to Fish in MI instead. I cannot argue with him we have a cabin there and last year we were catching our limits of salmon, and walleye, with the occasional laker,brown, Rainbow, and large smallmouth tossed in. Going to target Whitefish this year as well."
2490706,Bigstorm,2014-02-26 06:49:00,799,"I missed our Canada trip one year, I turned into a pretty grumpy guy the week that everyone else went."
2490746,SinOrSwim,2014-02-26 06:54:00,1528,"We have a few who only go every few years. Things in life change. Having little kids.........then those kids get older and all the costs that go into sports.......then college etc.But, we have a big enough group that we have not missed a trip in over 20 years. Granted, we changed a few years ago from our normal fly-in to a drive-in but we haven't missed.My brother and I started the trip and he has not missed a year EVER. I missed one year a few years ago because of work. Opened my own company and could not find coverage. It was brutal. His father in law didn't go the first year but has not missed since. So, there are 3 of us who have been pretty much every single year regardless. Then, my other brother started after he got out of college. So, that is the core group. Four of us and we have anywhere from 6 guys to 14 guys. We had 14 last year and won't do that again. WAY too much work"
2490826,icepro680,2014-02-26 07:08:00,74,"I tried really hard this year to put my first trip together, but didnt happen, friends and family didnt have much interest. Wife decided on Puerto Vallarta instead due to a winter of all winters we are having. We are one day short of the all time record for days below zero. Not to complain too much, I know its colder north of here. But anyways i guess its Rooster, red snapper and maybe a sailfish for me this year. Leaving in 6 days for the sun and beach."
2491306,GWC,2014-02-26 08:28:00,1021,We've gone to Gull Rock once or twice a year since 2008 & we've enjoy every trip. But having moved further away we didn't go last year & haven't planned to go this year. Why - 17 hours each way & we have three major lakes within 30 minutes of our house. About 2 hours north we have a lake known for walleye. I guess we have to explore these lakes before going back to Canada. I'm on the local lakes once or twice a week anyway. I have to admit that the fishing is generally better in Canada & we like the people who own the property where we stay. Lots of pluses & I really miss those trips.
2491970,Fishoil,2014-02-26 10:51:00,1277,"Not going to Canada?! Never!! I haven't missed a year since I started our trip 24 years ago and don't plan to miss one until I'm pushing daisys. Most years I make it up there twice and on a good year 3 times. Our group started with 4 and has grown to as many as 16 or 18 at times. Most years it's around 8, although this year it's looking like there will be 12 of us."
2492202,bigwalleye1,2014-02-26 11:37:00,2632,"Even after I push up daisies, I'll make one more trip, even if the guys have to sneak me in inside a jar."
