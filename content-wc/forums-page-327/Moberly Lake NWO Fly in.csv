Jigs, lindy rigs some with spinners, and your good. Bring a depth finder. Start at 5 to 8 feet and work deeper till you find them. Ask the fishermen that are leaving, they should be able to update you."

In the bay you are staying in the left and right points are both good for walleye just find the right depth. south of your area pick a structure and drop a jig. Down to the south by the rapids is a great area for walleye and northern but you better have a good supply of jigs. The first big bay south of cabin on your right is great for northern. If you go north again points and structure are your best bet, the Narrows both sides are a great place to catch eaters. Furthe north were the lake gets big go to the noth end by the trappers place fish the points and drops on both sides a the bay. there is a big flat on the right side that usually holds fish. Good Luck , I'll be waiting for the fishing report when you gat back."
