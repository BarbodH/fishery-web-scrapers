It will make a huge difference on his success when he fishes by himself or with friends and that success will build each and every time he goes out helping to make a like long passion for the sport. Success brings more success in everything he does.
2848681,SinOrSwim,2014-05-30 10:18:00,1528,"That would imply ""I"" know how to use it properly?!?!?! LOL I wish I had a Cabelas closer. I like Cabelsa better than Bass Pro. Especially the store branded gear.Honestly though, I'm not sure who is more excited, him or me?"
2848721,Fishoil,2014-05-30 10:27:00,1277,"Congratulations on taking your son on his first Canada trip. Lots of great ideas above, the only thing I can add to the list is a hook file for sharpening those jig hooks that you bend on a rock and a nail clippers for snipping line."
2849257,Mr. Sauger,2014-05-30 13:22:00,285,"One of my son’s favorite days is when I took him for a “guys” shopping trip to Bass Pro Shop. He received a few gift cards burning a hole in his pocket. That was last year when he was 8 years old.Some of the lures were very similar to mine but had a concentration of blue crankbaits (his favorite color). He also picked up for whatever reason a giant spinnerbait and surface frog. His favorite purchase was a small multi-tool (pliers, knife, screwdriver, etc. I think it is called a “turtle”). My thinking was let him buy what makes him happy. I’ll keep the responsibility to ensure we have the right tackle on board. He was not yet savvy enough to understand what is needed for the different types of fishing trips. Instead of insisting that he must a black/gold original Rapala, I let him buy what he wanted. He’ll eventually use it anyway. It sounds like you son is ready for a blend of targeting exactly what will be needed in Canada and selecting interesting looking stuff.Now my son needs a larger tackle box (you know how that goes). I suggest buy one a little bigger than initially needed to allow room for growth. In addition to lures, his box is stuffed with many confiscated items (hook files, electric hook sharpeners, tape measure, stringer, hemostats, nail clippers, compass, and misc. trinkets.) Side story – we’re bass fishing on a pressured lake. Slow finesse presentations were the ticket (wacky worming). Little Sauger starts burning a spinnerbait bigger than your hand. Just as I am telling him that presentation won’t work he lands a 38” pike. 5 minutes later he lands a 34 incher. Best part, it was his lure."
2849809,mtranger,2014-05-30 16:14:00,81,"I agree with all the posts about letting the kid pick his own lures, you will be amazed at how well they do. It is also alot of fun to see the concoctions the come with, we call them ""clown lures"", my wife tried to get my son to change to a more normal lure and in the meantime my son landed a 10# walleye on a clown lure.We also have a rule the he has free reign on my tackle box, and if he catches a fish on it, he keeps it."
2849889,JAY221,2014-05-30 16:45:00,877,"I know some won't agree but you might want to include a handheld game or some other thing that he finds entertaining as they don't all fish as hard as some of us do. I took two grandsons one year & one would fish right with you & the other was about 2/3 entertained. Later, Jay"
2862105,RCDuck,2014-06-03 12:04:00,18,"Enjoyed reading this thread... I don't have a lot to contribute, but I'm taking my wife, 11 year-old daughter, and 9 year-old son to Hawk Lake the end of June. It will be my wife and 9 year-olds first trip. I normally do a fly-in outpost and my 11-year old daughter has done that with me the last two years. I've never been able to convince my wife to do the outpost, so we're trying Hawk Lake Lodge for the first time this year.... looking forward to it.I don't normally take a separate tackle box for the kids, just due to packing issues and airlines, but it's not a bad idea. After reading this thread, I think I will let the kids pick out a couple of lures on their own to try. Last year, I think my daughter caught about 60 walleyes on the same pink jig. One day, while I was making a shore-lunch, she was casting a bare, gold colored jig from the shore just for fun and caught a 38"" northern. I was sure she was snagged until the ""snag"" started burning line from the reel.All-in-all, we do a fair amount of travelling, from beach, to snow-skiing, to fishing, and I think the Canadian fishing trip is really hard to beat for making memories."
2862529,strength22,2014-06-03 13:30:00,49,"My 1st Trip was when I was 7 back in 1979. Used a wooden black/gold Rapala almost like a fat rap. Caught 5 walleye the 1st half day on the lake. Later that week caught a 10lb pike casting a 5 of diamonds. I thought this fishing stuff was easy stuff. haha. That 10lb pike was my biggest pike for about 25 years until I got a 20 a few years ago. My dad and Gramps have passed on and I still go up but I can still here my Old man in freezing winter months holler down the stairs telling me he is getting the Canada tackle box's down to look at. Always loved that. We had different tackle for Canada and our river fishing adventures. the ""good"" stuff was for Canada."
2862609,BornToFish,2014-06-03 13:45:00,1224,"I commend you for taking your son with you to Canada on a fishing trip. You will make fabulous memories together. I clearly sense that your son will be developing a solid set values from which to develop into a fine young man. I took my nephew on two trips to NW Ontario. I quickly learned that he became impatient when vertical jigging for walleyes. He needed ""action"" fishing from time to time - casting for pike or bobbers for perch. You might want to have him pick out a few spoons or in-line blade baits. You might find that you may need to take some breaks from fishing to let him blow off some steam, so to speak. A pair of gloves and a ball or a football might come in handy. I encourage you to set him up with some reasonably good quality rods and reels, such that he has a chance to feel the bites, rather than getting frustrated watching you put fish after fish in the boat. I wouldn't encourage you to put together high dollar setups for him, as they might end up getting broken or in the lake. If you are traveling without your son's mother, be prepared for crossing the border with appropriate documentation. Otherwise you might get spun around at the border. I believe that you will find some threads on this with a quick search. Simply awesome that you and your son are taking a fishing trip together!!"
2845953,SinOrSwim,2014-05-29 15:16:00,1528,"Okay, so my son turns 9 in June. We are going to Hawk Lake Lodge in August. This is his first trip. He has a rod and reel and a small tackle box we use to fish for panfish etc. I'm thinking I want to get him a new tackle box for his birthday and fill it with a few things. I have some ideas but thought I'd put it out here to see if there are better ideas out there.For example: Get him a soft sided tackle bag or box? My thought was if he gets a bag with containers it limits what he has the chance of spilling in the boat. Also, random sampling of jigs/bodies and maybe a few lures. Some pliers. I wonder if they make a kids fishing glove to help him handle fish like this for the first time? Some stuff may just come from my tackle box too and we will use that for the bulk of our stuff but thought it might be nice for him to have some of his own gear."
2846065,Pooch,2014-05-29 15:57:00,4619,How about letting him pick out his own tackle box and then you and he go together and supply it. Maybe set some parameters on dollars and let him choose and maybe explain why he wants this or that for tackle. With your input he could prioritize what dollars he has been given for tackle. Let him decide what he needs for what kind of fishing. What tackle can cross over from panfish to walleye and pike.Great idea.Pooch
2846185,jiggster,2014-05-29 16:48:00,183,"I second Pooches idea. Give him enough options so he feels it his his choice. He might pick the hot color for the trip. Discuss the trip with him, letting him share his ideas also. I took my son at the age of 9 to Canada for the first time. The memories the two of you build will never end."
2846233,fosterthedog,2014-05-29 17:05:00,51,"Slip bobbers are the best for kids you can select the depth and your son can reel'em in. I've been using them 40 years lot of fun, my uncle started me on them when I was 10. Kids want to catch not fish, by catching they want to learn how to fish."
2846257,Pikeslayer8,2014-05-29 17:15:00,1460,"I also think it's important for the boy to have his voice. We would sit at my tackle for a ""redistribution allocation"" party. Kinda the same thing Obama is so good at doing. I started each boy with a small box like I started out with. Don't fret, plenty of upgrades will come. More importantly, teach em up hard on how to tie their own knot. Can't tell ya how proud I was when my boy would fish with his grampa on his first trip and handle his own gear. Have a great trip with your boy. It's a big step on his journey to be a man."
2846497,Blades-n-Beads,2014-05-29 18:35:00,484,"Sinorswim, m&m's, fruit snacks, crackers. Just kidding , glad to hear your taking the little guy, I agree with the others take him shopping and let him pick out a few things, It really makes them feel like one of the guys. Good luck and have a great time with your son. By the way your going to spoil him right off the bat taking him to hawk!! Excellent choice!!"
2846593,wallydave,2014-05-29 18:55:00,2151,No joke! One year on the Wenesaga we saw a 9 or 10 year old catch a nice mid 30 inch pike on a jig tipped with a gummy worm! Plus you have a snack for your new fishing buddy!
2846929,cuamb,2014-05-29 20:27:00,203,All the above are great ideas. On my son's first trip (10 years old) my brother-in-laws filled one tray with Jolly Rogers candy. He loved it.
2846993,eyemike,2014-05-29 20:48:00,233,Make sure that you put lures in his box that you have in your box. My daughter was always looking to see what I would pull out of mine so that she could match what I was using. Make sure your box has more than one also because it will be moved to his box eventually.
2847929,Mike Kansas,2014-05-30 07:21:00,1463,I made my first trip to Canada when I was 10. One memory I have never forgot was my Dad caught the first fish and immediatly took the lure off of his pole and put it on mine. I was pumped because I knew I had a fish catching lure on and Dad was my best friend. Mike Kansas
