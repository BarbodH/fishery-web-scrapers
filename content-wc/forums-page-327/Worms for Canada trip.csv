I would like to know if there are any bait shops in the Kenora or Minaki area where I could order a flat or half a flat of night crawlers so I wouldn't have to worry about crossing the border with them. The cheaper the better! ThanksCurtis"

Manny's is a couple miles past the Hwy 12 intersection, which takes you to Steinbach. There's another one within a mile or two past Manny's but I don't remember the name. Last year, I bought a flat at Bounty Baits in Kenora (807-543-6486). When you get to Kenora, you can either take the bypass toward Minaki or go into Keewatin. Bounty Baits is toward Keewatin a mile or two. It's right along the old hwy in an old weigh station."

We used to go all the way to Winnipeg, but discovered the shortcut one year and have been going that route ever since."

2861729,Carnhzkr,2014-06-03 11:10:00,964,I did a quick search and see there's a place called Jack's Live Bait in Minaki (807-224-4481). I've never bought from them but worms are worms.
2861769,Carnhzkr,2014-06-03 11:13:00,964,"Thanks for that tip. I didn't realize that was the case. I assumed once you were in Canada, you were good to go. I did learn last year that Ontario does not sell frozen minnows, but it is legal to buy them in MB and bring them in."
2861833,oldccm,2014-06-03 11:16:00,109,"I double checked before posting. Can't import leeches, live minnows or worms in dirt (worm bedding ok)."
2862657,deadhead1,2014-06-03 14:01:00,193,Manny sells night crawlers by the flat. In Kenora there are lots of places that will have them too. Manny sells his worms to some of the retail places in Kenora so I expect that his will already be packed in the correct material to bring into Ontario.
