2849057,BenBeattie,2014-05-30 12:19:00,232,"It's crazy how hot it got so fast. That shallow warm water will be popping. Bass, walleye and pike in the same spots. It's a fun time of year."
2849297,Guest,2014-05-30 13:31:00,0,It must be global warming. How else could you explain it?
2850265,jkoebel,2014-05-30 19:20:00,10,"Fishing was pretty hot up by Chamberlain. First day, we couldn't get all the way up because of the ice. But by Sat morning (5/24/2014) we found an opening and got the houseboat all the way up. They were shallow and they were hitting hard. There were days where we were catching all 24-26"" fish."
2850857,Skywagon,2014-05-31 05:23:00,1106,"I was in our lake yesterday, up to my chest in water, moving the floating docks around, it was not as cold as expected. The bays have heated up nicely with the recent warm weather. Just received two inches of rain overnight, should help maintain already high water levels."
2853465,tv4fish,2014-06-01 06:16:00,2694,"I presume the ""ultra"" high water is creating more floating logs up on Lac Seul? Gotta watch out for them (especially when it's windy and wavy)."
2857705,Waterwolf3,2014-06-02 11:16:00,3,"As Ben mentioned the fishing on Lac Suel last week was the best I have had in 17 years of fishing NW Ontario. Water temps started around 50f and went as high when we left to 63f. We fished the Ear Falls side and 4-10' was the ticket. Deeper water at the mouth of the sanctuary, and much shallower in the Sawmill bay area. Jig and minnow were the ticket. When bite slowed, bobber and plain red hook worked well. Nice weather and steady pressure helped. Ended up with 25+ fish over 25"" with 28.5"" being largest. 60-70 fish between 20""-25"", but plenty of fish below the slot for shore lunch and take home fish. Water seemed normal maybe a little high, but all gates to the dam in Ear Falls are open, water flow is fast. Good luck to all."
2857905,Mike Kansas,2014-06-02 12:22:00,1463,Great to see the good reports on Lac Seul. We will be there next week and last year was our best year ever in the 30 years we have gone to Lac Seul. Can't imagine it being better this year but no matter what I know it will be a great time. Mike Kansas
2860305,Guest,2014-06-03 04:37:00,0,"Fished Ear Falls area week ending 5/31 Water temps ranged from 55 main lake to 64 degrees in Sawmill bay Caught most fish on jig/minnow flipping into 2-4' of water. Did catch some walleye throwing crank baits Tues-Fri while northern fishing. Thursday started to pull spinner rigs in the warmer bays with some success. Fished Sawmill bay, Iron creek and Bannayatine bay areas. Best area by far was Sawmill. Caught all the fish you needed in Sawmill so really didn't have to travel around. Lots of slot and over walleyes and northern were very active as well. Water levels are higher than normal for this time of the year."
2861985,Bob/MN,2014-06-03 11:35:00,178,Good report.Thanks.
2844129,Cash,2014-05-29 07:29:00,73,"Heading that way on 6/14. What's going on with spawn, water levels etc. - Thanks"
2844641,BenBeattie,2014-05-29 09:06:00,232,"What levels are high for this time of year. I've been off the water for a week, just had a baby. Back to work soon and I expect post spawn fishing. By the time you get here things will be snapping. Expect great fishing. Weather has been nice and water temps should be coming up fast. No comment on Minnitaki, I never fish it this time of year for walleye."
2845401,Cash,2014-05-29 12:31:00,73,Congrats! Hope Everyone is well.
2846305,Whopper,2014-05-29 17:43:00,340,Congrats Ben!
2846761,maddiak,2014-05-29 19:48:00,11,"Just got home from the Ear falls area of lac seul after 4 days fishing. The weather was perfect and the best fishing of my life. 5 of us lost track of walleyes caught that measured over 24 inches. Largest walleye was 29 3/4, largest northern 40 inches. Hundreds caught on jigs and minnows. 5 caught on gulp with jigs, 1 northern caught on shad rap and nothing caught on lindy rigs. Jigs and minnows were the most productive. Unbelievable fishing."
2846881,cuamb,2014-05-29 20:21:00,203,Congrats Ben! I am sure it is a keeper.
2847097,Guest,2014-05-29 21:25:00,0,"Maddiak, sounds like an unbelievable trip! Were you fishing Sawmill Bay? How deep were they? Any idea on water temp? Our group is heading up on Saturday. Thanks for the report!"
2847257,maddiak,2014-05-29 22:26:00,11,"We were at mouth of english river first two days, water temp was 58-60, then moved down by lunker island and casted jigs into shore with wind blowing in 59-60. We tried down by sawmill first morning past the ""dock"" but it was slow. water temp down there was 63. I thought my temp sensor was broke but confirmed it with another boat. How can water temp be so warm when ottertail lake was 45 degrees the week before? I don't understand that. Best luck was english river sun and mon. 12 boats. Yesterday afternoon we were only boat but i think it was slowing down."
2847937,Limeyangler,2014-05-30 07:22:00,563,Congrats Ben!
2848833,prov1800,2014-05-30 11:07:00,5010,"Glad to hear that ben.did it hurt.lol.post spawn now on eagle, back bays in osborne bay water temps at 74, week and a half ago we were busting Ice to get there.nuts."
