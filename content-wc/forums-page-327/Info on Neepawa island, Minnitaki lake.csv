There are two cabins included in the price, the company is sioux retreat services.Seems too good to be true.......already did search on island and found older info, looking for recent info if possible.Father and sons only trip, first in a very long time. Thanks !!"

I can put you on great fishing within a minute from the cabin, and you will even luck out while fishing from the dock there! Many of us are currently ice fishing that section of the lake, with many walleyes, whitefish, pike and the occasional giant lake trout. 37"" Laker landed last week by a local guy."

1266886,Guest,2011-01-31 21:42:00,0,"Kai is a great guy. We stayed at his place on Abram, but went into Minnitaki. Caught lots of walleyes from 17-23, but no big fish. I would surely stay with him again if I went back to that chain of lakes, but the lack of true trophy fish (28+) has me going other places right now."
