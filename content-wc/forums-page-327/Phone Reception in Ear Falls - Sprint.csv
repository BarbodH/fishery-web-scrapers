For the Navionics app to work, you have to be able to connect to a cell tower, but you don't need as good of a connection as you might need to make or receive phone calls. It does use data, so if you don't have a international calling plan, you need to take that into account. You can call your carrier and add international for a few dollars, then discontinue that service when your trip is over. I was told by several people that go out of Lac Seul lodge that the Navionics app works fine on their phones. I did not use it, since I borrowed a hand-held GPS."
2855737,Pooch,2014-06-01 20:23:00,4619,"Carnhzkr,You ready to fish in a few weeks? Me too....Any idea if there is Verizon cell reception at LSL? That would sure be handy for me if so. Pooch"
2855841,Jwendt15,2014-06-01 20:46:00,72,"I actually tried putting my phone on airplane mode and restarting to make sure any signal was lost. Seems like the Navionics app should work fine without reception (assuming airplane mode truly shuts off all receiving signals). It took a while for the gps to locate exact position, but once it did it worked just fine. Hopefully I'll have the same result on Lac Seul. With this being our first time, I'm counting on this thing. Heading out this Saturday, counting down the hours!"
2857097,Carnhzkr,2014-06-02 09:01:00,964,"I just put Suffix 832 on two new Shimano Curados. Now I need to organize my tackle box and take a last minute inventory (I hate that job). Other than that, raring and ready to go.I'm pretty sure you can get cell reception at LSL. I noticed I had bars on my AT&T phone last year and did make a call as we were driving south on 105."
2857257,Pooch,2014-06-02 09:48:00,4619,"Carnhzkr,You're way ahead of me. Yesterday was the first free time I've had since planting started. I'm still cleaning out stuff from last years Labor Day trip! Years past I was packed by now. Getting old and inefficient it appears.Pooch"
2857929,troutwater,2014-06-02 12:25:00,299,"This happened to a co-worker of mine, but in North Dakota instead. He was visiting friends and had a huge cell phone bill because his phone was using Canadian towers for some reason. Said it was quite a pain to get the carrier to drop all the fees...almost as if they didn't believe he was never in Canada."
2852017,Jwendt15,2014-05-31 15:06:00,72,Anyone from the states have luck with getting any reception on Lac Seul with Sprint? I downloaded the Navionics app on my S4 and some have told me you need some data coverage to get the specific location on the GPS.
2852417,SinOrSwim,2014-05-31 18:18:00,1528,We get coverage on Lac Seul with Verizon but I don't think you are going to get data. It's all analog.
2852489,Pooch,2014-05-31 18:51:00,4619,"sinorswim, do you get verizon reception on the water on Lac Seul? How far down the lake south? It never occurred to me to take my phone in the boat. Duh.... Not used to being anywhere on the water that had reception. Can't get any reception in the Mahkwa area of the lake. Maybe closer to Sioux Lookout?Pooch"
2852513,SinOrSwim,2014-05-31 18:58:00,1528,"I don't take my phone out there but my brother had his out there last year and we were in the bay of islands and he got a phone call. Worked fine. But, we have trouble at camp with reception. Have to be in certain spots or go up to the road. My guess is it would be very spotty on the lake. I wouldn't want to rely on it."
2852537,Terwalleye,2014-05-31 19:11:00,166,"GPS should work with out Data . Used my phone as a GPS to get to camp last year and had no signal for quite some time. LOL in fact it was Sprint. ****, Sprint don't even work in the lower 48."
2852761,NARDA 1,2014-05-31 20:35:00,636,Navionics app worked fine on my S3 last year on Eagle Lake without data.
2852769,Glenman12,2014-05-31 20:37:00,762,I was always told that prior to crossing the border you should turn of your data or else pay thru the nose...dont know cause I always turn off my data...
2852809,SinOrSwim,2014-05-31 20:47:00,1528,Good point. I have mine on at times and still doesn't work though. text messages etc
2852913,Glenman12,2014-05-31 21:06:00,762,"all I remember was about 3-4 years ago one of our guys checking emails, baseball scores etc and coming home to a bill about $250 more than normal...dont remember what service he had.."
2854761,Kevin R,2014-06-01 13:22:00,305,"Last season at Kabetogama our home internet was being drowned out by the Canada side towers, I called Verizon & they told me lots of people were having the same problem they stated they must have cranked up the power. They had me go thru a special process to stay on US towers for our cell phones & same for computers / IPads. Now when I went up to Canada I couldn't pick up anything in the perrault falls area. Best phone service I had luck with was one thru Onstar it worked great, very inexpensive I paid up front for time no extra charges."
