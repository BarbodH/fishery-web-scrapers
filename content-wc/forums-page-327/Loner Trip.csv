Looking for suggestions for camps that will take a single guy and also not break the bank. Walleye fish all day and night. Thoughts please. I do not want to ""camp"" I want a cabin and a boat package."

2851953,itsme,2014-05-31 14:22:00,31,"Itsme again I have been to Bull Moose Camp on Upper Goose Lake as a single and with friends or a son. Great fishing with good boats and 15 HP motors. I and my grand daughter will go in on the 19 of June. Then my son and I the first wk in August. Super walleye action in every month I have been there. May--June--July---Aug---& Sept. I say try it because I rate it ""better"" than any others and I have fished Ontario usually multi times each year since 1951. Go the the web site and judge for yourself what Tom and Shara provide."
2852065,MuskyMaster,2014-05-31 15:26:00,79,"I just came from prairiebeecamps, I'd check and see if they have any openings because a lot of places would take you last minute if they have an opening. Cabin was $250 and I believe boats range from $300-$400. Its gonna be tough to find a place to take 1 guy especially during the summer months, but I think anyone would last minute if they have an opening."
2852545,Terwalleye,2014-05-31 19:16:00,166,"Take a look at Northern Lights on Cedar. It's a few miles north of Vermillion off of the Red lake HWY. They charge by boat. One of our group stays with us and fishes solo in a camp boat. Really NICE boats too. 40 horse, 17 ft with all the fixins. They might accomodate you for what I think is a reasonable rate.http://www.clarksresorts.com/northern-lights/Woudln't lie abut the lake being good either. Heading back for year 5 and not even thinking about trying a different lkae any time soon."
