519434,RoyC,2002-04-21 18:00:00,274,Can't you buy additional beer and liquor beyond the customs limit right at the border (Border Bob's or something like that?). I assume that it is cheaper than buying it inside of Canada since it is duty free?
519435,BD,2002-04-21 19:59:00,739,"Sorry; The beer and booze you buy at the duty free stores counts toward the legal limit you can import. You can only bring in one case of beer or 40 ounces (1 liter) of booze each, duty free. Buying from the from the duty free shops only allows you to buy the Canadian happy juice without paying the tax that you would pay in Canada. If you want two cases af beer each (or an extra bottle) it is a little cheaper to buy it at the duty free shop and pay the duty on the extra case (or bottle). Some guys I know claim that the beer from the duty free shops is older than what they buy in The Fort and they claim they can taste a difference. I quit drinking eight years ago so I find it hard to give you a personal opinion on this, but if I remember correctly, I never could taste a difference. Blue was Blue if it came from the depot in The Fort or from the duty free shop.""Be wary of strong drink. It can make you shoot at tax collectors; and miss!"" --- Lazarus Long"
519436,BD,2002-04-21 20:20:00,739,"Should have signed in, then I could have added this to my last reply. Eric; A buddy of mine crossed the border for years with extra booze without declaring it. About six or seven years ago he got torn down. Just his turn I suppose. The extra undeclared booze was confiscated and he had to buy replacement bottles at a much higher cost after finally getting away from the checkpoint. Every time he has gone across since he has been torn down even though he had learned his lesson and quit trying to sneak any extra across. He has decided to give up on Canada and isn't going anymore because of the hassle every time he gets to the border. He agrees that it is his fault that the border trouble was his fault, but Canadian Customs thinks that people never change and will tear him down till ##### freezes over. Glad you decided to stop smuggling before they caught you.""Remember to PILLAGE before you BURN"" --- Lazarus Long"
