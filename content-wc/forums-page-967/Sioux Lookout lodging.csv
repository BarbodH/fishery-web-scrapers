519328,Dave,2002-04-16 05:28:00,258,I have stayed at the Lamplighter Motel twice. It is the only one in Sioux Lookout that is clean. The phone # is 807-737-1014. It is on the highway just after you cross Frog Rapids on the left side and before you turn on to go to Lake St. Joes.
519329,Guest,2002-04-20 10:01:00,0,There is another Motel after you pass the Lamp Lighter that is very good. Much larger an more like an American 2 level motel. Many more rooms than the other. It is on the right side of the Street just as you are entering town.
