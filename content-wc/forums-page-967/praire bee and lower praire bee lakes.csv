The camp end of the lake is shallower with some rock structure. Our best fishing has been in the evening or early morning, trolling crawler harnesses or pitching jigs. Tom and Georgia Lee have minnows available but, at the time we go, crawlers are just as good. Pike fishing is pretty good during the day and small mouth are pretty spotty. The owners will give you maps and indicate where to fish to get you started. There is a new slot limit for the lake this year. We have always caught as many walleye as we want to eat and take home and we haven't fished that hard. E-mail me if you need more specifics."

Tried several other lakes before that, and found Prairie Bee to be a good combination of reasonable rates, decent fishing, fairly low fishing pressure, and good accomodations.email me directly if you would like more specific info and/or a map with spots marked."
