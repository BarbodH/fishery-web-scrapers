519463,phidelt157,2002-04-21 18:53:00,191,I plan to buy a new truck a week or so before I cross the border on our fly-in this summer. Does anyone know what the border patrol's policy is on temporary license/registration tags on a vehicle? Is it any different from a normal plate as long as all documents are present? Just want to cover all corners before we set out. Thanks in advance for the help.157
