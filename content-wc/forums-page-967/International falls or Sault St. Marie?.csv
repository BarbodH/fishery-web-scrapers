519330,Rocky,2002-04-15 22:55:00,5,I will be taking my first Canadian trip in July to a lodge north of Dryden Ontario--I live in eastern Ohio should I drive to International Falls and cross there or go up through Michigan and cross at Sault St. Marie and take Canadian highway 17 from there?
519331,Guest,2002-04-16 04:34:00,0,I live in west central Ohio and it is within 7 miles of the same distance for us to go to Thunder Bay weather we go thru the Soo or go thru Duluth. You can by cheaper gas and more four lane highways by driving more in the states. I personally go thru the Soo as I LOVE the drive around the north shore of Lake Superior. I also find the trip to be about the same drive time. Good Luck!!
519332,Behle,2002-04-16 05:08:00,51,We start our trip from northeastern Indiana and go through Thunder Bay. The gas is a little cheaper. On the way back we've come back by way of the Soo. The drive is more scenic. The draw backs are the gas prices and the two-lane highway. We also see more check stations by the MNR also. These can take a little bit of time since they stop all vehicles and inspect fish and licenses. We drive a motor home and pull a trailer. The route through the Soo is definately harder on the driver in that situation. More curves and inclines/declines.
