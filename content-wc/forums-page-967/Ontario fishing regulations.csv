518493,Czar,2002-03-22 18:57:00,408,I just purchased my non resident fishing license and due to the strike I was unable to get a copy of the regulations. Has there been any rule changes from last year or does anyone know how to obtain a copy of the 2002 regulations? Thanks in advance.

518495,Czar,2002-03-23 03:00:00,408,"Thanks, Thumper. Just what I needed. Good fishing to you and may all your fish be lunkers"
518496,Guest,2002-03-27 12:05:00,0,"yes the regulations have changed this year for walleye and northerns. Limits for walleyes are 4 now not 6 and they also have a slot. None between 16.1 and 22 inches and only one over 22 inches. The limit for pike is still 6, but they are limited in size. Only 2 greater then 24 inches and only one of these can be over 34"" (I think that is what it was)"
518497,the_bronco,2002-04-21 13:05:00,86,I just looked at the regs. and I believe Randy meant to type 18.1 and not 16.1 for the minimun walleye length.

518499,tracker,2002-04-21 16:58:00,91,"It is obvious that when one posts a question for regs he should at least post in which Division that he will be fishing so as that there will not be a lot of answers that differ from one another. There has been alot of changes this year across Ontario with the walleye and northern regs. Again, when posting questions, please give Div number and the name of the lake. Thanks, tracker"
518500,the_bronco,2002-04-21 18:34:00,86,"I stand corrected, thank you melonbob and tracker and my apologies to Randy. I fish in div. 30, which is still 18.1 inches, and never thought to check the other div. When I did check, I found that div. 14,18,19,25,and28 did change to the 16.1 limit.[I did not read all of the regs., so there may be other div. that also went to the lower limit]."
