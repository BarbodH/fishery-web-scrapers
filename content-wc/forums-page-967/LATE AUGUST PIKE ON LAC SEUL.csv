519201,mark,2002-04-17 20:21:00,61,IF YOU WANT GOOD PIKE FISHING ON LAC SEUL TRY THE LAST WEEK OF SEPTEMBER. THE LAKE SHOULD'VE TURNED OVER BY THEN.

Caught most pike on #9 Risto Raps at 18-23 foot depth trolling over reefs that had deeper water nearby. That's where the walleye were. Average pike about 10 lbs. Weather was a big factor, with steady southwest wind and mild temperature most of the week."
