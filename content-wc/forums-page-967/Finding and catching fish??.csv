519401,2 DOGS,2002-04-19 12:33:00,361,Do you think it is up to the resort owner to take people out on the water when they are struggling to catch fish or to just mark a map ??Would it make a difference if they were first-timers or frequent visitors?
519402,Guest,2002-04-19 14:17:00,0,"I think what the owner does depends on several factors:1. first and foremost, how much does the owner appreciate the customer's business and want someone who is likely to repeat.2. The content of the camp's advertisment. 3. If it is a new customer I would like to believe the owner would be more inclined to offer a higher level of services to keep them as a customer."
519403,Guest,2002-04-19 14:52:00,0,"Thats a good question.I don't think that a resort owner/opperator is obligated to take someone out fishing, but I think the good opperator would go out of his way to try and help.You run a fine line between helping out and becoming a guide, most camps offer a guide service. I think the opperator is obligated for only general information.My $.02"
519404,River_eye,2002-04-19 15:53:00,1486,"Generally, the resort owners are quite busy. They would just as soon hire quality guides.I'm sure though, that if you weren't having a good time, they'd do what it takes to make you happy, if they want the repeat business. This may include taking you out fishing, but not necessarily. Ultimately, it's up to him or her to decide how they run the business and it's up to you whether you spend your money there."
519405,Guest,2002-04-19 18:50:00,0,"I feel the resort owner is under no responsibility to ""take you out"".Unless that was a condition to booking a vacation. Let you in as to where/what is a plus and would expect that much from any owner. Shoot, if I don't catch many fish>would I come back? A fine line to walk. Guides need to feed thier families too!The resort I have been going to for the past 8+ years, the owner will ask me if I would help out, feel obligated due to past visitors have given me ""free"" advise and even taken me out when I was new to the lake. Know what it's like to get skunked... doesn't make for a wonderful trip when every other boat comes in with awesome fish stories. It also depends on the people who need help > friendly..you bet. Dirt-ball>forget it!"
519406,Guest,2002-04-20 06:13:00,0,"From the prospective of a lodge owner....my number 1 goal when guests arrive is make sure they catch fish! We start talking about the lake from the time we pick them up at our parking lot all the way to the lodge (3 miles) we are telling guests about spots, rocks, reefs, bays, etc.... Once they arrive at the camp and we unload their gear they come directly to the lodge and we give them maps and pull out the highlighters. Depending upon which plan they have...guided = less detail, unguided = more detail. We have a staff of guides that also will be talking to ""all"" guests about spots and marking maps for all lodge guests. As a lodge owner I do attempt to fish with all new guests whether they pay for a guide or not, I feel it is important to develop the relationships that create repeat business (makes my life easier too). After owning South Bay Lodge for 7 years I do not remember a single guest that was unhappy about the fishing at the end of their week. The next thing I am going to say will suprise most of the readers....I have come to the conclusion that repeat business has very little to do with catching fish! Catching lots of fish is kind of a given, providing a vacation that guests will tell others about and want to repeat year after year is my real objective. The fish are only 1 small piece to that puzzle. Providing comfortable accommodations, good food, friendly service, and making the reality of being on the lake and experiencing the Canadian wilderness better than the stories and photos...that's what counts.ro."
519407,Guest,2002-04-22 06:34:00,0,As owner of Five Lakes Lodge I agree with Roger there is no problem cathing fish. So we try to make our guest fill our resort and lakes are a place they would like to return to. but if they need help it's just a ? away.
519408,Arkie eye jerker,2002-04-22 08:27:00,228,"From a customer view. The details in your post are exactly what I look for in a Lodge/Resort. A few years ago another couple and my wife and I spent a week on LOTW. The fishing was great. My wife even caught a 30"" 10Lb. Walleye. (which cost me 385$ for mount), which was her first walleye fishing trip ever. I've been on LOTW three different trips and never caught one over 6Lbs. This trip occured in the middle of August, which happened to be a warm summer. Our cabin had an air conditioner unit,but me or my friend could not get it to work. We contacted owner, who came right down to look at it. He turned it on and hit it on top with his fist. The air conditioner came on and he said ""it don't look like much but works great."" Before he even went out the door, the air conditioner quit. HE looked at it and said"" D*** thing, just need to rest a minute and he left. We thought he was probably going to get some tools. But we later found him in the bar having a drink and I don't think he was concerned with our air conditioner. So my buddy and I went back to cabin and checked some things and found breaker to be tripped. We reset it and it worked until it would freeze up and trip breaker again. Needless to say even though the fishing was great I will never go to this lodge again. We did get a lasting inside joke out of it though. Still if anything quits working, my buddy or I will say ""D*** thing just needs a little rest, it will be alright."" Sorry this turned out so long."
