I still do not know all of the rules, but suppose a trip is planned and there is not enough time to pre-arrange permits for DWI convictions. There will be 2 adults crossing with one child. One adult has 2 past DWI's (20 years ago) and the other adult has a recent DWI (8 months ago). Question #1...Are the license plates always run? Question #2 does running the plates show DWI record and guarantee a further review? Question #3...Can there be further action taken (beyond refusing admittance) at the crossing if they are questioned and admit to the past conviction (If it is only DWI charges)? Question #4...If questioned, the parties involved will be honest about past convictions and will be willing to pay the $200 fee. Is it pretty much guaranteed to be allowed entry if: The fee is paid, the convictions were only DWI's and everyone cooperated? Would it be better to cross during businees hours (is there certain personnel that would need to be present to allow permission to enter? Any help would be greatly appreciated.Fish On!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

519479,bigfish1965,2002-04-21 20:48:00,3210,Are the plates always run? Yes. Will they show the convictions? Almost certainly. Any further action then refusal of admittance? No. Paying the fee get you in? I don't know. The one DWI is very recent. Make sure that person is not driving. A passport is always the best ID at any border.

I thought some kind-hearted moderator woulda put that thread out of its misery by now....At one point this winter, I think it was the longest WC thread ever, and US/Canada relations were at their coldest since old Dief. threatened to boot young Kennedy in the a$$.Anyway, the answers given by Bigfish look dead-on, so no further comment from me on those is necessary.For the remaining ones:1. The $200 - as was discussed, ad nauseum, the common view is that this is some sort of ""felon tax"" - if they catch you at the border trying to get in with a DWI, they ding you for $200, and then let you in. The more accurate way of looking at it is if you have a conviction and want to enter Canada, one way is to apply for a temporary Minister's Permit (or whatever it's called). There is a fee to apply (you guessed it, $200). Payment of the fee does not guarantee entry, although old DWI's rarely present a big problem. Many people with convictions apply, pay the fee, and are rejected. I think there is a very long, and I'm sure riveting, post of mine on this very issue in the old thread, but I still can't bring myself to look back there, so I leave you to find it.... My understanding is that the people with authority to grant these are not the same border people that you talk to when you cross, and that they work more or less normal busines hours. So, if you need this approval on the weekend or at night, you'll be waiting. This is something to consider when deciding when to cross.There is some talk of changing the laws this summer regarding old DWI's. That would make sense, but no government does anything quickly or on time, so don't bank on this. Also, your buddy with the fresh one won't be helped by this anyway.Hope this helps....post again if you have more questions.derrek.CANADIAN WALLEYE OPEN UP AND SAY ""EH""!"
