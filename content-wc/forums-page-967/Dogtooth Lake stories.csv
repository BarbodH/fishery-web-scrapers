The owner of Canadian vacations next store was very helpful. If I went back and never would I would stay there. Could not find guide for lake and looked extensevely. Went out with some locals and did just as poorly. The lodge has an impressive brochure, but while there never found them , nor did any one else while we were there. Am sure there are big ones there, and heard some positive reports from there. Ours was a bad experince however, ther is alot better places to fish in my opinion."

However, it was 100 degrees every day (+/- a few degree) with no wind and the lake is crystal clear. Not a good example of how it could be I'm sure. Stayed at Dogtooth Lake Resort. Accomodations were decent. we were there for 3 days and I caught about 20 walleyes the whole trip with the biggest tipping the scale at about 2 lbs. We did get some nice smallmouth.Hope this helps you out."
