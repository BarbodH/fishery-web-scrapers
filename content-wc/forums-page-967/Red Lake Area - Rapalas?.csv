One friend was saying Shad Raps or Fat Raps in the 5 or 7 size work best for Walleyes. Does this sound right and what colors are best?Thanks,Bob"
519335,duffy,2002-04-16 15:05:00,49,Been fishing north of red lake for 6 years and found i only needed jigs and berkely power grubs for unlimited eyes. Good luck. Where you going?Duffy
519336,Guest,2002-04-17 12:11:00,0,"We are headed West of Red Lake to the Caribou WP. In the past my firends have done real well with small jigs working the shallow water. Last year some guys started having success during the shoulder times 9:30 AM-11 AM and 5-7 PM with Rapalas trolling shallow reefs for eyes. They used a little bit of everything and I can't see buying 25 Rapalas for one trip. I was hoping to get 4-8 that would give me the best chances.Thanks,Bob"
519337,River_eye,2002-04-17 13:43:00,1486,"I don't know if I'd buy 8 rapalas. Try a couple shad raps, a couple reef runners, a couple wally divers, and that should be good."
519338,lobo1,2002-04-17 16:54:00,734,"Bob,Generally if we are looking for lunch we too use the jigs, they all work but the metallic gold head with white tails seems to be the best for our group.When we use the rapala type baits the two that have really outproduced all the others are the gold husky jerk with the orange belly and the best of the best has been the firetiger colored Bomber long A (replace the hooks). We fish late May to early June in stained water.Steve"
519339,Guest,2002-04-18 10:12:00,0,"I would suggest silver and black shad raps, I have had great success with them in the past. You may also want to have a couple fire tiger and a couple blue shad raps. #7 0r #5Jigs and rigs will still produce more fish in my opinion. I lug my entire tackle box along every year and I wonder why...Grits"
519340,Dan,2002-04-18 10:58:00,325,"Forget the Raps. Redlake is best fished with jigs 3/8 white and pink, white and blue tip with a medium sucker minnow or chub. Thats your best combination. Leave your night crawlers and raps at home if you want to catch fish. Dan"
