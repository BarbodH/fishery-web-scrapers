I hope that this is resolved swiftly and nothing bad results between the great countries of this continent, the great North America. We are brothers and it is a sad day for this to have happened. As a US citizen, we all appreciate the support that Canada has given through these times. My prayers are with the families of the dead and injured."
519394,chrism,2002-04-18 18:18:00,429,"Yep, it is sad... It is an aweful way to go, but it is part of being involved in armed conflict. My sympathies to the families, and I would also like to wish the pilot of the plane a prayer to help him get through this - I'm sure he's pretty down right about now. I don't disagree with what is going on over there, but I do have a hard time seeing innocent people perish.Be strong, y'all...Eh!"
519395,bigfish1965,2002-04-19 05:51:00,3210,Our brave soldiers accept the risks involved in any armed conflict. Friendly fire has always been a substantial risk in all wars. It is truly a tragedy and hopefully the US can figure out what went wrong so that we can try to make sure it never happens again. RIP guys.
519396,River_eye,2002-04-19 15:55:00,1486,I can't imagine how the pilot must feel. All they can do is learn so as not to repeat the mistake again hopefully.
519397,Guest,2002-04-20 07:41:00,0,My deepest sympathy is also axtended to the families of the Canadian soldiers whos lives were taken in this tragic accident. It is a sad price to pay for freedom. I am an American and my Dad and I were in Canada during the week of 9/11. I was amazed but not surprised of the sopport that the Canadian people showed after those horrible events unfolded. I am proud to call Canada our friends and neighbors.

519399,Walleye Wacker,2002-04-22 14:15:00,6,I was a Heli Pilot in Viet Nam and I hate to think of how many brave souls have been lost to friendly fire....It is always sad when it happens but it is part of the sacrifice made by all of those who fight for freedom. When I think of the lost souls of war I remember that each of us survivors and our faimlys live in the greatest countries in the world. Our rights are only amplified every year when we leave our driveway to go any where we want to fish...I choose the deep clear water of Canada and sometimes when the moment is right I can see the lost souls faces on the surface of the lake. Sounds wierd but its my time to remember my heros.
