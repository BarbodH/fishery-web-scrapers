518863,Guest,2002-04-03 22:11:00,0,LOOKING FOR INFO TO.TRY THE RIVER UP NORTH FOR BETTER FISHING.
518864,Guest,2002-04-04 14:15:00,0,"LOW666, have you fish there before? Can you tell ne anything?I am going up there in june."
518865,Guest,2002-04-16 10:25:00,0,"I was there with my adult son about 6 years ago. We found it OK. The fishing was good. We fished both directions. Found walleyes best downriver just before entering Barrel Lake. Jigs and minnows. Also,we got into a school of huge walleyes where English River leaves Barrel and 100' from the falls. Dangerous here--make sure your anchor holds. Keep to the left side of the island as the river splits there.Theres action in that area of the river.Try up river for northern. Saw a 20# taken on a silver KB wabbler. In June you might get into walleyes there by the falls. Neatest cabin spot you ever saw. I don't know how they sleep as theres falls on both sides. This spot is closed for a short time during the spawn."
518866,Guest,2002-04-17 07:10:00,0,"Thanks SwedeYou said it was OK, was there something you did not like? Was therealot of people on the water?"
518867,Guest,2002-04-18 17:00:00,0,"We there there in late summer--August I think. Were not a lot of people there at that time. The place has some cottages and some spaces for trailers. Everyone I met was friendly as anything and pleased with their choice. The ownership has changed I believe, but that shouldn't make any difference.We did take off one morning and went to Sturgeon Lake ( north of there about 15' or so.)and caught some lakers. We had a jury-rigged downrigger outfit that got some baits down there. Thats a whole other type of fishing and you might want to hire a guide and his boat. Check with Kozy Camp operator,or Press Lake( Gerry Nicholas) . Or get hold of Jim Krosschell--hes the best guide up there--available on the net if you want more info.I have used him 4 times for each of 4 years. [email protected] He guides to mostly lakes some 10-20 miles north of Cozy Kamp. If you want to go catch a lot of fish and get to know the area get a guide, at least a for a day or 2 a trip. Best investment you'll make.Good luck"
