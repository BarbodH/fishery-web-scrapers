519241,Guest,2002-04-11 20:35:00,0,"Just met with another group of friends that want to set up a trip for the end of August or the beginning of Sept.I want to here from as many of you as possible... I have fished Ont. many times L.O.W., Rainey, Eagle and Lac Seul. We mainly fish for Walleyes. I have always fished early in the season, never in the fall.The question I have is were should we go?Please dont reply with resort names, only lakes and areas... I just want to protect against lodges or friends of lodges blowing their own horn.Where would you fish in the fall if you had your choice?Price is not the most important factor, but be realistic.ThanksAVS"
519242,Guest,2002-04-11 20:45:00,0,"If I was looking for a trip in august or september I would fish Yoke Lake. It is located about 100 yards north of Pipestone Lake. It is loaded with Walleyes, Sm. Bass, Muskies, even Lg. Bass. I fished it last year for the first time and I had a blast. You could go wrong by fishing this lake in the fall.Good Luck"
519243,Fred_G,2002-04-12 04:52:00,908,"My choice at for that time of year would be Lca Seul, or even further north at Lake St. Joseph. The fishing should be fantastic and the weather about perfect.Fred"
519244,Guest,2002-04-12 05:41:00,0,I'd think about Gullrock Lake about an 1/2hr. north of Lac Seul on highway 105. Tons of fish and they're easy to find.5 lakes connected in this system.
519245,Larry S,2002-04-12 06:19:00,666,"Fished Lac Seul in early Sept and late August.Great Fishery,you have a choice of many resorts with diverse plans(american,housekeeping or outposts),different areas(by Ear Falls,Middle Lake or Sioux Narrows)to fish You can use the trip finder of the justfishontario.com website to submit your criteria for your trip and you will get replys from all the resorts who can meet your qualificationsLarry S"

519247,Guest,2002-04-12 10:13:00,0,"Bigfish1965,I agree that fishing the same lakes would yield results, the 4 lake that I have been to are so big that it would take a lifetime to learn. I would't mind going back to any of them, but I would like try new areas of them.Life is to short to dance with a few girls, I want to dance with 'em all.AVS"
519248,Guest,2002-04-14 06:57:00,0,"I also say to try the Gullrock chain of lakes very easy to find fish not many rocks to hit, nice little town close by if you need more beer."
519249,Guest,2002-04-14 07:47:00,0,US side of Rainy Lake. Fish are on the reefs and the big hogs are on the bite. We have produced many 100 fish days in Sept & Oct. After Labor Day there are very few boats especially Monday-Friday. TGG
519250,rainy,2002-04-19 23:54:00,21,"i agree with big fish1965 you go to big water like LOTW,RAINYLAKE,LACSUEL,ect ect you can only learn more and the fall is the hungrieeee big bite for big fish. {big lake more big fish}"
