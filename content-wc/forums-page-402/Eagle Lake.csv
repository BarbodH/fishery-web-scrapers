1489746,v-bay gord,2012-09-24 19:18:00,3168,"Yes, it was a bad week. We had some big winds just previous and the water quality in VBay almost looked like a turnover had occurred. The walleyes that had been pretty predictable up to that point seemed to go shallower and then disappear. Darned if I could figure it out. Today caught some in 16 feet of water trolling cranks.....so maybe a shallow pattern has emerged. That week was also very cold ....all in all better than working, but just barely. I think that week will have had the same results on many area lakes...."
1490028,Chops,2012-09-25 13:42:00,56,"Gord, has turnover occurred?"
1490083,northerneyes,2012-09-25 15:50:00,72,We fished just north of Ignace during 9/15-22. It was also very slow fishing. Even northerns were not hitting all that much.
1490109,v-bay gord,2012-09-25 17:15:00,3168,"Chops, I'm not really sure. What I would consider a ""turnover"" must have occurred in the VBay portion based on the water quality for a few days, and the change in fish locations......but it doesn't really correlate with the water temps. So, perhaps in other sections it may be different.......Eagle is at least three different lake types and each does it's own thing on it's own schedule. Fascinating, but equally frustrating."
1482508,oxdrift2,2012-09-03 13:12:00,37,"All Packed, Two more days until the yearly NARDA fishing excursion to Birchdale Lodge on Eagle Lake!!!! Time to rest and relax.

1483773,cap1,2012-09-06 12:38:00,3,"I returned from Eagle on the 1st- weather has been warm and the fish were running deep, hope the weather changes for your group."
1483792,Pete eer,2012-09-06 14:04:00,14,"Will be on Eagle Lake on September 15, staying at Stanleys Resort. Any reports on fishing weather wolud be greatly appreciated. This is my 8th year in a row to the area and I am just as excited as ever."
1483796,cap1,2012-09-06 14:11:00,3,"Pete, do you go that week every year?"
1484984,Pete eer,2012-09-10 11:19:00,14,CapI normally go in September but this is the latest date I have started the trip. September is normally good fishing and no bugs.
1487288,oxdrift2,2012-09-17 10:42:00,37,While we were there the west arm ( by you) was going great. Rest of the lake was tough. have fun!!
1489557,Pete eer,2012-09-24 10:51:00,14,Just returned from the west arm of Eagle lake. This has to be the worst week of fishing in 20 some trips to Canada. Finding any fish was tough and when we did find them they were in 40 to 60 feet of water. Did anybody else have a similar experience from Sept 15-22. I will return but will go earlier in Sept.
1489578,tackleman,2012-09-24 11:47:00,444,going this weekend to the west arm what were you fishing for that was that deep?
1489590,Pete eer,2012-09-24 12:17:00,14,"We were fishing for and only cought walley, we did not catch one northern all week."
