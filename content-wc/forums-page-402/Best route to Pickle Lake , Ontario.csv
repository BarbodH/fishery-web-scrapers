1487024,Ogoki,2012-09-16 15:18:00,291,"From western Ohio, Mapquest shows a 9 mile difference . I am looking at going from Duluth thru Thunder Bay to Pickle Lake vs. going from Duluth thru International Falls to Pickle Lake. The only time I did go, was the route up thru International Falls . If you have gone both ways , which way do you prefer ? When going to Armstrong I have went up rt 61 to Thunder Bay ,so I am familiar with what that section of the trip would be like. I have been to Armstrong many , many times but have only been to Pickle Lake once. Thanks for your input."
1487082,slugger doug,2012-09-16 18:39:00,15,we go to Savant Lake and the last ten years have been going up through Thunder Bay. Bunch more to look at. The crossing into Canada is not as busy and you don't have to run that 2 hour drive from Ft. Frances to Dryden. We take the short cut on 130 and turn on Barrie Road and then take River Drive to 588. Comes out by Kakebaka Falls.
1487086,phishfearme,2012-09-16 18:45:00,1242,"we always take the thunder bay route - but as slugger mentioned, you totally bypass thunder bay by taking the 130 cutoff. a much nicer ride and the boarder crossing at pigeon river is a breeze. there's everything you need along the way also. phish"
1487206,camp chef,2012-09-17 08:10:00,915,"I sure don't want to take issue with mapquest, but it sure seems like it would be a lot more than 9 miles farther going to Pickle lake thru International falls than up past Thunderbay....at least time wise a lot longer."
1487220,deputy dog,2012-09-17 08:27:00,305,would it not be quicker going up through michigan through the soo? we drive from eastern ohio and have gone this way for the past 3 years.
1487221,phishfearme,2012-09-17 08:27:00,1242,i was curious about camp chef's comment so i did a check myself - the mapquest route shows the preferred route is to pigeon river but it shows it actually longer time wise and distance wise(?) - by only 7 miles - BUT it does not use the correct rt 130 cutoff. it takes 130 all the way to 11/17 but there's a much shorter route: - from 61 take the left onto 130 - come to the T and make a left - continue to river road and make a right - at the stop sigh make another right to Stanley - this comes out at 11/17 much further west than where 130 meets 11/17 all roads are paved and easy to travel. in any event - take the pigeon river route - much nicer all around. phish
1487248,Ogoki,2012-09-17 08:57:00,291,"Camp Chef , I thought it would be better to go thru T Bay myself , but the guys I went went said they have went both ways and Int. Falls route was closer and quicker . I doubt them after doing the trip with them . I did run the route on Mapquest two different time with different results . Deputy Dog , My wife and I almost always go thru the Soo when going to Armstrong . Much more scenic . Going thru the Soo means more Canadian ,high priced gas . But we don't care, as we are on vacation . Love that route !!! Last year when I was pulling a trailer with my ATV in it ,we came back from Armstrong thru Duluth and the mile distance was almost the same as thru the Soo. When I am not pulling a trailer I do the Soo route . Have you been back to Mattice Lake Outfitters lately ? They recently purchased the outpost camps that Armstrong Outposts had . We are already booked for next June . Was up the last week of August and had a real good trip. Phish , if we go back to Pickle Lake I am taking my truck and plan to go thru T Bay . I just was looking for more arguments to throw at a buddy of mine who might go with me . He was the one who likes the Int Falls way . Thanks for the input !!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1487321,Fishoil,2012-09-17 12:05:00,1277,"Pigeon River is faster, more scenic, the roads are better and the border crossing is painless compared to International Falls. The last 15 or 20 times to Pickle I've taken this route and can't imagine going through International Falls ever again."
1487338,Lovetofish,2012-09-17 12:37:00,458,"I just came back Saturday. All things being equal, either way is about the same. A few less miles going through International Falls up to Sioux Lookout to Savant lake then north. But you can make the time up crossing at Pigeon River and taking the shortcut to the Falls and 17 to Ignace. The road to Ignace is very easy to drive and you can set your cruise control. Plus a lot wider and less chance to run into a swamp donkey. This time of the year you shouldn't have to wait at either border. I do recommend crossing at Pigeon River. A word of note is north of Savant lake they are re-doing a stretch of road so it's gravel for 20 miles or so."
1489612,northerneyes,2012-09-24 13:22:00,72,"I just came back from Ignace. Going up from Duluth through International Falls then to dryden on 502, then 17 east to Ignace. Coming back from Ignace we took 17 east to 130 to 61 to Duluth. Coming back was 19 miles shorter."
