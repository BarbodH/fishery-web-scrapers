1486174,Jigger1,2012-09-13 15:09:00,234,"2012 will unquestionably go down as one of my best years yet. I'm going to zoom in and out of a couple recent issues raised on the site as well. The first is regarding guiding. As I've mentioned in the past, I spent the first 33 years of life pursuing walleyes in Wisconsin and occasional trips to Canada (Lake of the Woods and Eagle Lake) without a guide, I had caught hundreds of walleyes 23 and under but only 1 over 24. However over the last 13 years I have been hunting walleyes on Lac Seul based out of Silver Water Wheel Lodge and always with a guide. This year I had the privilege of catching and releasing 39 walleyes over 24 on Lac Seul over 11 days. Only the crazy year of 2005 had a higher per day average over 24 but unfortunately I only fished five days that year. I have refined my approach to fishing and feel I'm a significantly better fisherman today than I was 13 years ago as a direct result of working with, watching and being coached by different guides over the years. I topped out at 28 this year in June but just got back from spending the first few days of September battling some of the stoutest 24-26 walleyes I have ever faced. And while I didn't catch a giant this most recent trip, it certainly didn't go without effort as we spent significant time trophy hunting, I had an absolute blast catching many hard fighting, winter bound walleyes. On the last day I caught a 24.5 out of 28' of water that I would have sworn was over 27, it stayed down and made power runs well beyond its age and weight. In fact, most eyes over 22 fought like beasts this trip and they were already fat for the winter. Many times we caught fish, regardless of size, spitting up 4-5 smelt they had been gorging on. As a result the fish weren't jumping in the boat, but I found them catchable. We had to move to find active bites when the one were on died, but I've come to learn that's pretty typical as pods move in and out to feed. We spent the entire five days fishing 18'35', primarily over 23' and almost exclusively on quarter to 3/8oz jigs with minnows. We did give bottom bouncing a run, but they just didn't produce for us like jigs this trip. So in summary, while I enjoy the volume and action of late June, I'm thinking the fight you get from walleyes readying for winter in deep water that have been eating all summer may just be my favorite. This trip I also kept an eye out for any of the previously mentioned etiquette issues and didn't witness any. We don't see a ton of boats fishing the central basin but when we did all played nice. The other huge treat we got this trip was a great night scape, we literally got to watch nature's fireworks as we had a rising moon, northern lights mixed in with a scattered cloud cover. One night we also had an electrical storm firing off so it was just spectacular. Regrettably another fantastic year at SWWL is in the books. I'm officially out 286 days until I return to the Wheel in 2013. Great fishing and best of luck to you all!"
1486290,tlars,2012-09-13 20:34:00,137,Heading up at noon Mon with 8 other guys. Last trip of the year. We really enjoy the time in camp in late Sept.
1486477,dkrusin,2012-09-14 11:03:00,97,"Is this correct?? Our group of 8 would be over 23 grand for 5 days. Plus another 3 grand for HST. Just wondering, have heard a lot of good things about this place."
1486515,tlars,2012-09-14 12:22:00,137,"This our 9th trip to SWWL-twice for the opener and 7th in the late fall. I think it's fair to say that we're value buyers. That is, we believe that SWWL has a great product with great service at a price that's fair for what we get. 71 hours till lift off!"
1486534,SinOrSwim,2012-09-14 13:02:00,1528,What days were you there? We fished the NW section the 8-11th and had probably our worst year for numbers. I do agree though the fish we caught in the 24 to 26 range were very fat and healthy fish. Glad to hear someone had better success than we did. Ours certainly wasn't bad just not what we have been accustomed to. DKrusin: not sure where you are getting the numbers? Looks like 5 nights is $2400 per 2 men so approx $1200 per guy?
1486556,Jigger1,2012-09-14 13:40:00,234,"We fished in late June and then again September 2-6. As I've stated in the past, it's not the cheapest place, but in my humble opinion it's worth every penny. And in talking to virtually every other guest I've met at the lodge or have had the opportunity to join me, they would all agree. Listening to other guests or even staff that's been to other lodges they would also confirm SWWL is a truly special place. Over the years I've had people in our group who have only been able to make the trip once due to cost, but they are some of the most adamant about figuring out how to save for another trip. They just loved it! I'm a guest, not the owner, so I'd prefer to stay out of specific dollar costs but I think you're numbers are a ways off. Remember what's called a five day trip is actually 5.5 days on the water and for a relatively nominal fee can be turned into 6 full days based on availability. Call Mike for details and he can quote you figures. All I know is based on my investigative work, this is highly competitive for some of the other premier destinations in all of Canada and there's no other way to put it, SWWL is flat out a premier destination. The other thing to consider is that this includes everything; Mike has a no surprise fee philosophy. Morning starts out with coffee or orange juice being delivered to your cabin, then a full breakfast and you're off fishing. And you're off fishing in style with an Alumacraft Tournament 185 matched with a Yamaha 90hp tiller and fully guided with a team of guides who exchange information not only every night at round table, but also at shore lunch if you're in a group of 2 or more boats. There's no hidden information and everybody on Mike's team is on the same page regarding what's happening from day to day. Then it's shore lunch and I'm here to tell you folks, I'd gladly pay a gourmet dinner price for this meal any time any place. It's awesome and they do it right! And then put a bow tie on the day with a full dinner prepared fresh daily and it's always tasty. So to wrap up this lengthy post, every group and every person is different. It's housekeeping for some, American for others, no guide, fully guided, or somewhere in between, it all depends. Again for me, I'm just thankful I'm able to make this trip happen and I love every single aspect of this trip. I'm spoiled beyond belief with this wonderful fishery and I thoroughly enjoy being able to spend 100% of my time in the boat doing nothing else but fishing."
1486557,tlars,2012-09-14 13:42:00,137,Amen! I've heard the same from many other guests.
1486871,rather-be-fishin,2012-09-15 23:44:00,429,Are SWWL rates that are posted on their website per person for 2 people per boat or is that the total rate for 2 people? I didnt see it explained on the site. Makes a huge difference in the cost. Most lodges rates are per person so you don't divide the rate by 2. I am thinking these rates listed are also a per person rate. Please clarify for those that are in the know. Thanks! RBF
1486985,Mike Willems,2012-09-16 12:29:00,4,The rates listed on the SWWL website are per person.Rates are lower for those fishing 3 guests to a boat than 2. Some discounts are available for May and the second half of Sept.Kids 12 and under fish at 1/2 price.Teenagers 13 - 17 fish at 2/3 rate.I do have smaller cabins available at times that are discounted by 25% or more.Please call or email me if you would like further details. Open dates for 2013 are limited.Mike WillemsOwner and OperaterSilver Water Wheel Lodge
1489382,Skiball,2012-09-23 18:01:00,82,"Jigger:Great trip. We were up 9/6 through 9/15 and are correct. The eyes are fattened for the winter. Every belly was solid and we caught 60 fish over 21"" with the largest 25.5"" in 2 1/2 days and they all faught like huge beasts. We also were getting most of our fish in 35-45 ft so the fights were unbelievable....just a great overall walleye year up there. We stayed slightly east of you at Mahkwa Lodge. Have a great winter........cheers.Skiball."
1489412,v-bay gord,2012-09-23 19:08:00,3168,"Actually the belly is solid because they are being brought up from the depths you mention. The air bladder expands creating the illusion of a ""fat"" walleye. In some cases it will push the stomach right out of the fish's mouth. I wouldn't recommend bringing walleye up from deeper than 35 feet due to mortality issues....it's just too hard on a fish that can't adjust to the pressure changes. A lake trout can."
1489429,NathanH,2012-09-23 20:42:00,697,1000% agree. The mortality rate at that depth is 25-35%. I think. Unless you keep them your killing 1/5 fish.
1489440,Jigger1,2012-09-23 23:08:00,234,"Skiball - you were fishing a lot deeper than us. 35' is the ceiling or in this case the basement. Way too much pressure from that depth for the eyes. There's plenty of big eyes to be caught in water less than 35'. On this last trip, most of ours were caught between 23' - 28'. Have a good one."
1490546,Skiball,2012-09-26 18:34:00,82,"I understnad and know about the bladders. We were fortunate that over 8 days, only two fish were lost. Our eyes that were caught in the 15-30 ft range were just as solid. I believe that it was such a strange summer and weather patterns were very volaitle, therefore, I think fish were feeding a bit sooner than normal. We had 18-19 inch eyes that were just huge in girth that we got as shallow as 15. Just a liitle different than normal. qall in all...good fishinh.Have a great fall."
1487833,rather-be-fishin,2012-09-18 14:43:00,429,"Mike ~ Thanks for responding to clarify the rates at SWWL. It was posted above that people were dividing the rates per the # of people in a boat and I didn't think that was correct. So I wanted to check to make sure. Some day I plan to come to your resort at SWWL but right now our group still prefers to do the housekeeping route, cooking our own meals and fishing independtly without a guide. But as I get older and all the work involved I do see how an all inclusive resort would be a wonderful way to go! Have a great Winter! 10 months to go to our return trip to awesome LAC SEUL! RBF"
