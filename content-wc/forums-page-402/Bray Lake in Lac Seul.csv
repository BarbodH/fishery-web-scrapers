1482675,Skiball,2012-09-03 22:59:00,82,West of Mahkwa Lodge and south of Chambers Island.
1482793,Mike Kansas,2012-09-04 11:56:00,1463,Bray is a great place for some deep water Bottom Bouncing this time of year. Locate the edges of the structure in the center of the lake and fish them hard. Also the north shore deep water is a good spot.

The serentiy and relaxed environmnet made it a geat couple of days of fishing...................not to mention we fished deeper, about 40-45 ft where the water temps were about three degrees cooler....63 and in the 2 1/2 days our over the slot total was up in the high 50's but nothing over 25inches. Just had a ball and figured it out in a couple of hours..........................thanks"
