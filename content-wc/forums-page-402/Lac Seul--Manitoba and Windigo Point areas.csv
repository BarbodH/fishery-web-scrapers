1488052,Mike Kansas,2012-09-19 12:37:00,1463,Scott...Hi Buddy good to hear from you. Mike Kansas
1489375,Skiball,2012-09-23 17:13:00,82,"I fish the south end and Windigo has been good for many years. Directly across from therer is LaSalle Islands, also very good. The re are so many places to fish in that area but Windigo always warrants a pass a couple of times during the week. We've pulled up there at around 9am and by noon 6 guys boated over 125 eyes. You just never know. Happy Fishing."
1485616,Riceburner,2012-09-11 21:32:00,436,"We have fished the areas around Manitoba and Windigo Points several years, and have noticed several boats that fly on by and head around Windigo Point. These boats act like they are heading somewhere in the mornings---we wonder if there are people being transported to an outpost, headed to good fishing farther up stream, or ??? Are any of you in those boats making that run or know where they are headed?"
1485731,Steve Ediger,2012-09-12 11:19:00,97,"Lac Seul Lodge has a very nice outpost in Black Bay which is a couple of miles around Windigo Point. They could also be going to Aldous Bay. And yes, there is good fishing up there. It is too far for most folks from the Ear Falls area camps."
1485736,mdsn,2012-09-12 12:00:00,121,Does anyone know if it is possible to get from Lac Seul Lodge outpost on sunlight lake to the main water? The map shows a creek or small river but I do not know if its navigable all year.
1485779,jkonop,2012-09-12 14:06:00,544,"I did it in mid-June of this year, I guess it depends on the water level but I have heard guys say watch it based on water level, and I heard other guys say it is not an issue (The same guys up on plane that run it). I guess I was a bit cautious and leery, and had group of 4 boats stacked up behind me waiting for me to quit slowing them down..."
1485895,JDP,2012-09-12 19:18:00,1457,"Riceburner,What direction are these boats travelling...North, south, east???"
1485900,Mike Kansas,2012-09-12 19:27:00,1463,The area south and east of Windigo is fished much less than most areas on LS and there are many great spots in that area. There is also a lot of places to lose a prop or lower unit. We fish that area in June out of Black Bay outpost and this year 8 of us caught over 2700 Walleye in 5 days. Mike Kansas
1486863,Riceburner,2012-09-15 21:37:00,436,"The boats were coming from the North. Past Windigo, some head East (possibly to Black Bay as mentioned) and others go across the open water toward the SE. To answer another question, the boats from the outpost in Broad or Sunlite do come out and fish the main lake--tho there is a rocky spot to watch out for on a bend in Altimer Creek."
1487106,JDP,2012-09-16 20:23:00,1457,"Riceburner,Based upon your description it is not possible to be sure where the boats are fishing. There are MILES and MILES of water where they could be headed..."
1487116,Riceburner,2012-09-16 20:51:00,436,"Lots of possibilities--but in many cases there are two or more boats traveling together, and they don't slow down to check spots, just fly on by..... maybe they ARE headed to Black Bay outpost, or one guide and a couple follow boats... I'll check with some anglers that go to Black Bay. Mainly just curious thanks."
1487379,worthsr,2012-09-17 14:38:00,52,"I go to Lac Seul Lodge's Black Bay outpost in late June every year. We drive past Windigo Point on our way in and our way out. We don't fish West of fish gut bay and end up spending more time fishing east of the outpost. If the boats are heading in for a week at the outpost they should be pretty well loaded up. A week's worth of food, drinks, clothing and fishing equipment pretty much fills up our boats. The last couple years, we've seen more people from Ear Falls camps drive past the Black Bay area on their way to Aldous Bay or even Vaughn Lake. With a 50HP motor Vaughn Lake must be over two hours each way. That's a long way from camp if a storm blows in and the waves get crazy."
