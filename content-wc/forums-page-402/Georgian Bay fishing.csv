Georgian Bay on Lake Huron looks very interesting. Has any of you WC folks spent any time in the Massasauga or French River Provincial Parks areas? There are a number of resorts I've found online, but always nice to hear from others who have been there. We are mainly looking for a place we don't need a guide and we are perfectly happy if we can catch a few walleyes to eat. If anyone has suggestions about any inland lakes to the north or east of Georgian Bay, I would like to hear them. Thanks!"
1490063,Guest,2012-09-25 14:59:00,0,I fished out of a private lodge there a few times. They basically only caught smallmouth bass and a few pike and muskie. The last few years they have been trolling for salmon as well. Walleye were not in that area of the lake. I checked around and there was not any decent walleye fishing close by. Not really sure why that was like that.

I also fished the French River twice in the summer, and same results....lot's of pike and bass, though no walleyes. Now a good friend of mine hired an old guide (that has since passed) who took him and a friend up rapids, etc to more ""back waters"" on the French, and they did very well with decent sized walleyes (14"" - 20""). If you're going to fish that area for a few days, I'd check out a guide for a day or two and be sure they know where to fish walleyes, as otherwise I don't think you'll get on any. Good luck with your trip next summer and fishing plans. Rich"
1490151,adempsey,2012-09-25 19:07:00,963,Whats your approximate starting point and how far do you want to travel?
1490588,Bluestem,2012-09-26 20:12:00,7,"Thanks for the information. adempsey - we will be over near Kingston at the east end of Lake Ontario. I've seen some reports about Bay of Quinte on Ontario, but not sure if it's a good fit for a family trip. How far do I want to travel? Not any further east (we're from Iowa), but would go north along Huron or maybe slightly north of Sudbury - Sault Ste. Marie. We have fished Gullrock in NW Ontario, so maybe we should just drive all the way around the north side of Superior and just head there! Lots of road time, but we know Gullrock, and when the trip is over, it's only a 12 hour drive home!"
