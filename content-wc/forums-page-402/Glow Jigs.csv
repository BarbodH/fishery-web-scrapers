1490258,NathanH,2012-09-26 08:05:00,697,I dont use them often but I have used the standard White Glow Jigs. I have had good results in the BWCA with them. In fact I was doing so well with my glow jig head I had everyone converted after a day. Same boat same twister tail color but different jig head I think it was about 6:1. Never seen anything like before or since. I know I would buy glow green if they made them thats my favorite walleye color.
