Early in the week found them just off the top of the humps and out on the edge of the humps. As the week went on and the cold and wind came through, they seemed to move out deeper and to the closest current area. Good luck all."
1484284,1700SS,2012-09-07 17:00:00,104,"Hey Jared, Have not seen any recent reports lately. Have the crappies started yet? Any info would be great. Gonna be up in your area starting the 14th. Thanks Brett"
1484350,Obabikon,2012-09-07 20:20:00,2370,"Yeah... they have been biting. They aren't in the elbow yet, but they're on the 20 foot deep trees. Jason came back with his limit yesterday... all 12 inchers. Walleyes have been hit and miss. One day you go out and hammer them, the next it's all dinks. I've been doing a bunch of musky fishing... it's similar to walleyes. One day I'll catch 4... with all of them less than 30 inches. The next I'll catch two 45+'s.... Weather is turning cold, lots of wind. It should be pretty soon the crappies are in the elbow and moved to the fall spots in Miles Bay."

1484495,Ia Walihntr,2012-09-08 15:05:00,320,"Bill, Looks like I'll miss you again this year. Coming up with my father-in-law from Cedar Rapids on Oct. 2nd. Are you staying at Youngs? Marv"
1484563,Bill Krejca,2012-09-08 20:39:00,6107,"Hi Marv, Yeah, I'll be at Young's. Hopefully I'll get back in Obabikon Lake this year, didn't get there last year due to lower water. Oct 2, eh? I'll never forget the year Dad and a friend and I tent camped at Turtle Portage (1966) the week of Oct 16. It was a mighty cold week, but the birch and aspens were beautiful. Fishing was only so-so, but it didn't matter, as you know, fishing is just part of the mystique of those north woods. Good luck, I'll save a few for you. Bill"
1484782,birddogger,2012-09-09 19:37:00,43,Great post Bill. That's what it's all about.....Lost my dad a year ago and some of the finest memories were being up north with him and the family.
1484896,muskybones,2012-09-10 07:58:00,24,"I agree, great post Bill. I lost my father on Valentine's Day this year. It is going to be a very emotional trip starting this coming Saturday. My father introduced me to LOTW some 20 years ago. I have only missed one year since then and vow to never miss one again. It is not always about the fishing. It is about spending time with family and friends in one of the most beautiful places on earth. The fish are just a ""bonus"".Bones"
1485839,1700SS,2012-09-12 16:52:00,104,"Thanks for the report Jared. Hopefully they start moving into the elbow starting Saturday,lol. Bill i will try to give you a report about midweek next week. Drive safe. Brett"
1489050,hawks_rule,2012-09-22 09:58:00,115,Bump... any new reports on crappie activity?
1489055,Obabikon,2012-09-22 10:18:00,2370,"Hit and miss... the cold snap seems to have slowed them, but there's no doubt they've moved into their fall spots."
