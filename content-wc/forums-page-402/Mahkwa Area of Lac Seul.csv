1482117,Skiball,2012-09-02 09:57:00,82,Will do. Be returning on the 16th.
1487587,Skiball,2012-09-17 22:51:00,82,"Got back from Lac Seul and MAhkwa Lodge on the 16th. Had a great trip with 5 1/2 days of great weather. Only one blow out day at 50mph with 6 footers. Other than that.....................we caught a ton of 3-5 ponders, around 60 for a 2 1/2 day stretch. Nothern numbers were good but not quality..only one 15 pounder. All in all it was a great trip for quality fish and three days of 100+ for the two boats........already looking forward to next year.Happy Times,Skiball"
1487668,tv4fish,2012-09-18 08:21:00,2694,Just curious - Could you share any details -- at what depth and structure did you find the fish at this time of the year up there? What bait/lure seemed to work the best? What was the water temp. up there?
1489365,Skiball,2012-09-23 16:35:00,82,Got most of our fish in 30-40 ft. Water temps were about 63-65 degrees depending on your depth. We did well with crawlers and minnows. We found a 13 ft hump surrounded by 60ft of water. We marked the hump and fished down to about 50 ft. The surface temps were about 65 so we figured down around 40 ft we would get more active fish at about 62 or 63 degrees. We did ok in 20-30 ft but no size. If you're going up.....have a great trip.
1478203,Skywagon,2012-08-22 20:14:00,1106,"Pooch, you know where you should be Labor day this year. Bad boy. TroyMansfield, is it your boat that has the twin 225's? If so, you had fun making our 150 look sick when we were heading back to the ramp at Deception one time last summer."
1478262,Pooch,2012-08-22 23:22:00,4619,"Yea, I know I'm bad boy. Our toughest looking field yesterday tested 33% on the down corn and not yet black layered on the still standing corn. Might as well go fishing one more time before we start! Doesn't do much good to fret about something that can't be changed.We will have a crop in my immediate area, albeit a poor one. I have a couple farms that could maybe be average at best. Better than most.Both elevators are ready for corn. Dryers are full and millwrights are about done at Dunlap with some overhead repairs. Just after Labor Day looks to be a zoo as everyone will probably poke their nose in a field someplace.Attached is a photo of our worst area. Very green corn on the right is a end of May replant I helped a neighbor with. It will undoubtedly be the best corn around if it doesn't get frosted.Beans appear to be the only semi bright spot this year. Followed closely by fishing......You?Pooch"
1478413,dan cardinal,2012-08-23 11:41:00,64,Thanks Wobbie and Pooch for the input!Dan
1478475,wobbie19,2012-08-23 14:38:00,71,"I went back and checked my pictures from a couple of weeks ago when I was at Mahkwa, the cabin next to us had rented boats and Mahkwa must have some new Alumacraft Competitors now with 50 HP Yamahas. That is what they had when renting, but I did see the a lot of Lund Alaskans around. Either way, I agree with Pooch they are not too bad for a camp boats. Good luck"
1478512,dan cardinal,2012-08-23 16:01:00,64,"Again Wobbie...I very much appreciate the input. We have booked Mahkwa, HK cabin for Aug 2013. Don't know if I can go ahead and request the new Alumacraft Competitors??? but I'm going to try. Thanks Again!"
1478569,Pooch,2012-08-23 18:18:00,4619,"Other than the location of the rear seat on the old Lunds, don't be afraid of them. They are a proven and tough boat that handles that lake fairly well. It can be a bear, especially if there is a strong north wind.Pooch"
1478815,dan cardinal,2012-08-24 09:01:00,64,"I'm in agreement. I have used the older Lund Alaskians on other parts of Lac Seul...they are a very dependable, time tested fishing boat. I was concerned about the power sources as much as anything. The newer Yahama and Honda that many of the other camps are using really spoil a guy. So it's good to know Mahkwa has upgraded some of the old motors with newer. Pooch...thank you for your response and information."
1479280,jheimsch,2012-08-25 11:43:00,38,"Have been up to Mahkwa twice this summer. Once with wife and once with son & grandson. My wife has never fished and her first fish was a 28"" eye(should have bought a lottery ticket that day) We had good fishing both trips---high winds for three days in early august. We did american plan both times--food very good. Fished Windigo, Bishops rock area, Pine Pt., Big sand structure west of Wesley Pt. On days the wind was down----all produced. Had to fish protected when wind was up. The channel west of Aldous Bay was a good area out of the big winds that that was a steady producer. On a bad note watch for rocks near that little island east of Pine is.(north west shore) I found them 50yds from shore. Have a great time, John"
1481874,Skiball,2012-09-01 10:45:00,82,Headed up to Mahkwa Thursday the 7th. Nice weather change coming mid-week. mid 60's during the day upper 40's to low 50's in the evening.Just what the am and pm bites need. Might even start stirring up the Big Pike.Good Fishing
1481985,JDP,2012-09-01 20:31:00,1457,"Skiball,Please let us know how you did.Have a GREAT time!"
1476541,Skiball,2012-08-19 12:49:00,82,Headed up 9/7........anyone fishing the Mahkwa area of Lac Seul S/SE end by Vaughan?
1476648,Pooch,2012-08-19 17:30:00,4619,"Depending on work, I should be there over labor day. Stay at Mahkwa on the house keeping side. You?Friend just returned and his group had a real good trip. PM here on WC me if you want.Pooch"
1476654,Skiball,2012-08-19 17:45:00,82,Staying in housekeeping cabin 9 on 9/7 through 9/15. We're leaving from chicago. Have been going up for 18 yrs.
1476656,Skiball,2012-08-19 17:50:00,82,do you and your friends fish the main lake or vaughan? we generally fish the main lake and either island hope or fish the mission. also head up to fish hook. and we go as far east as bray lake
1476699,Pooch,2012-08-19 19:12:00,4619,"Since I've only been fishing LS for the past three years with a group that has been there for many years I usually follow them. Started taking my own boat last year and have been stretching my legs more.Vaughn seems to be a spring location. By Labor Day decent walleye don't seem to be there or at least any size. We stay mainly on the main lake. I don't know of the islands you mentioned. Have fished just past and south of the apostles west then to the east a few miles past the ferry. If there are boats in an area I wont stop. I like to fish away from others and ""hunt"" fish.Next year will be my fiftieth trip to Canada and will probably spend it on either Lake Savant or Lac Suel. Two trips to Savant this year have been good and am really looking forward to fishing some ""new to me"" water on LS over Labor Day in a couple weeks.Not sure what cabin we are in, but probably one on the end or near to it. Usually six to ten in this Labor Day group.I would enjoy staying in touch.Pooch"
1476737,Skiball,2012-08-19 20:46:00,82,"We can certainly stay in touch. The spot you mentioned by the ferry, or just east of it is a big fish spot. In addition, if you see other boats up there don't pass it up. Thats a massive spot and often harbors big eyes. The am and evening bite are best. We've been up there in the eraly evening and come away with 30 fish in an hour. Also, the flat sand area east of the drop off is good for northern. You catch quite a few northerns in the evening fishing eyes. Generally not small ones. Just east of the ferry, check your map, is Wesley Pt. You will see boats up there several times during the week...guides included. Over the years there have been nice eyes taken off of Pine Pt. as well, just a little bit further NE. These are all on the map.Bray Lake is where alot of guides take their guests. A bit of a trip from camp. Also, check out Windigo Island, 3 mins from camp 15-35 ft of water of the NE point facing Mahkwa. Don't be afraid to ask the help. Take your map up and they'll point out some add'l spots. Good Luck."
1477466,TroyMansfield,2012-08-21 11:59:00,92,"Ill be out on Vaughn sept 8th guiding 8-10 guys on my twin engine landing craft, Ive been slamming eyes all summer in Vaughn, some days we burn 40doz minnows. and are limited out by shore lunch, then its catch and release the rest of the day good luck fishing"
1477932,dan cardinal,2012-08-22 10:08:00,64,Do any of you use the camp boats at Mahkwa? Just wondering the quality of their boats/motors.
1477972,wobbie19,2012-08-22 11:36:00,71,"I have seen some of them... and the new ones seemed really nice. They do have a lot of other ones around, but the ones I seen rented looked pretty nice."
1478150,Pooch,2012-08-22 18:58:00,4619,"Last fall Mahkwa was still using rebuilt Lund Alaskans. Stripped the carpet out and put in vinyl. They are sixteen footers with 40 and 50 hp Yamaha. Pretty decent camp boats, but with the longer tiller handle on the newer motors the guy driving gets contorted as they didn't relocate the drivers seat after the repower.I rented one a couple years ago for one day and my left arm/shoulder was sore after one day. Later that winter I repowered my older Lund Rebel with a new forty Yamaha tiller and relocated the back seat and it works great. Mahkwa just needs to go one step further and move that rear seat forward and to the right.We will be there over Labor Day. Anyone up there at the same time look for the older original Lund Red Rebel with the Yamaha, Illinois numbers and a crabby old guy driving. Stop and say hi.Last year I stumbled upon the flat that was in the post above and did really well for size and numbers until several guide boats pulled in so we left and went north of Pine Point to the islands and drifted in pulling spinners and continued to do fairly well.Pooch"
