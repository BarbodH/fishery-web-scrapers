Also, what do you consider to be the top 3-5 resorts close to great crappie water? I am looking for a 5 star resort that offers the American Plan.Thanks"
1489706,1700SS,2012-09-24 17:45:00,104,"Give Jared a call at Obabikon bay resort. He has American plan. Also right next to great crappie fishing. Last week, not so great crappie fishing. But that's why you call it fishing and not catching. I stay at Red Wing Lodge and just do the housekeeping plan. As for what four weeks I would choose. I would say the last 2 in September and the first 2 in October."
1489751,Obabikon,2012-09-24 19:21:00,2370,Anywere from duck hunting opener (September 10th) on. It just depends on how you like to fish for the crappies. They can be a TON of fun fishing the sunken trees in Obabikon Lake (usually around september 1st). Any four weeks in September/October would be great. (we should also have a house keeping cabin by mid August available for rent)
1489806,PJM,2012-09-24 23:00:00,3516,"Gary Any of the resorts up near Morson will work and the crappie fishing changes from year to year depending on the water temp and the algae bloom. In the last few years October has been a better month and it seems to go in cycles. One year the Obabaikon lake is great, then Hay Island or Thompson Creek area. I was up there a round September 6 for a week and the crappie fishing was fair in the Obabikon because the water was still very warm. Going back up on the 6th of October with 13 guys to a resort in Morson and hopefully if the water temps cool down the fish will school up in the deeper water the fishing will be great. I have been doing this for 17 years and the lake is great.................."

1490923,wingmann,2012-09-27 19:28:00,42,"Jared, how has the duck hunting been up by you this year?"
1490997,Obabikon,2012-09-28 06:42:00,2370,"Actually, the duck hunting was very good for opener, and when the weather was super nasty a few days ago. I haven't seen many flying the last couple days, because it's so nice. But, this is also the first week we haven't had hunters. So, it's worked out well. The hunters have gotten a lot of mallards and geese. Some woodys, but they've mostly been mallard hunting. None of the big flocks are down yet, and we haven't started seeing buffleheads or any of the October birds. The woods are full of grouse right now too."
