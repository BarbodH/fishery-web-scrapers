1489222,Pooch,2012-09-22 19:58:00,4619,Buddy of mine spending the night in Ignace called and said they drove through some very light snow flakes today between there and Thunder Bay. Didn't amount to anything. Forecast is for good weather for his last trip of the year. Looking for Lakers up shallow so he wants cold weather.That whiff of snow seems a little early to me. Early spring - Early winter?Just making conversation....Pooch

1489293,zeebee,2012-09-23 07:48:00,1144,Tonights weather report for N. Ont courtesy of the immortal George Carlin............DARK. Seriously tho.....this time of year night time temps can dip below freezing althought the forecast for the upcoming week calls for favourable daytime temps. Would be a good week to be fishin.Lakers goin shallow....jointed rap in blue silver or perch.....yummy.
