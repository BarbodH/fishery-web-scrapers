Either way, isn't it amazing how some mornings you catch all the fish and then just as quickly your boat partner does.I really don't think ""Luck"" has a whole lot to do with it, but I do believe that sometimes you are just fortunate to find a spot where the fish are and they are hungry."
1487969,zeebee,2012-09-18 21:07:00,1144,Just curious as to what you all think?If I took a monkey....stuck a rod in his hand .....put him on a good lake....how long till he catches a world record????
1487976,wallydave,2012-09-18 21:25:00,2151,"This year we had some tough fishing for most of the week, two or three at a time then nothing for a while or move to a new spot. The one day they were hitting fast and furious, our second boat got right behind us, caught nothing! Go figure eh! Some days its your day others no so much! Hey its called fishing not catching!!??"
1488066,pike50plus,2012-09-19 13:18:00,584,Luck is when preparation meets opportunity!
1488095,camp chef,2012-09-19 15:28:00,915,It depends on whether this is a lucky Monkey or not and of course how good his net Monkey is.
1488124,Larry Mac,2012-09-19 16:52:00,530,"Hi ZeeBee, I strongly agree and practice what pike50plus wrote. IMHO learning the life cycle and habits of your prey, familiarizing yourself with the body of water you intend to fish and using the right equipment, ect. will definitely increase your chances of successfully catching fish. Listening very carefully to the very successful, experienced outdoorsman on this site will also help put more fish in the boat. It has for me.I know I did not address your ""Monkey Question"" LOL. But I was more intrigued with the title of your thread. Have a Great year!!!Thank you,Larry Mac"
1488325,Bill Krejca,2012-09-20 08:13:00,6107,"Re: luck - I firmly believe that body chemistry plays a huge part in restricting fish bites. For example, some folks who really may not have a clue can out fish an older, more experienced person. I think on days when the fish are tentative about biting, this may make the difference between catching and just being the netter for the greenhorn. Bill Krejca"
1488464,MrSimon,2012-09-20 13:28:00,922,"I suppose you could call it luck, but in reality its probability. Research/knowledge + good location at right time + proper technique = higher probability of catching fish But, even when you do everything ""right"" there are subtleties of fishing that are so minute you can't detect if you are doing them right or wrong .... but they can certainly affect your catch rate. We've all been in a boat with two guys using the same lure in the same hole with vastly different results. Some days you're the hammer and some days you're the nail."

1489079,bigwalleye1,2012-09-22 12:03:00,2632,"I find the harder I work at anything, the luckier I get. I am in the market, however, for a Lucky Net Monkey."
