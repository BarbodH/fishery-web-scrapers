1489867,v-bay gord,2012-09-25 07:15:00,3168,"That trout was not having a good day. I hope you stitched it back together and released it gently! As far as muskie size.......it will always be a mystery that will only grow larger as the tale is retold around the campfire. By the way, thanks for the care package Jay"

1490004,Obabikon,2012-09-25 12:29:00,2370,"Not sure, but a 40"" musky would be willing to grab a laker that big. I've had 42's hit 30"" northerns before. I have no clue how they plan to eat it, but... they still hit them."
1490023,fishinnut 3446,2012-09-25 13:28:00,638,"My guess is big,my son caught a 29 1/2"" walleye that had marks on both sides,my 1st thought was a boat prop but it had two marks on each side,so my mind was wondering just how big the fish are on Eagle!Gord,this was at Colonel's Island.Did you get word of a 59 1/2""er caught during the week of 6/30-7/7 suppose that the lodge xxxx xxxxx caught it?Here's a pic.of the sons fish,yes I made him release it"
1490027,v-bay gord,2012-09-25 13:41:00,3168,"I believe that the muskie in question was caught (released) by Todd Euler who's family owned Eulers Camp for many years. He's pretty low key about the whole deal.....just says it was the biggest fish he ever saw, never mind caught. A refreshing change from what would have been the case had some ""others....you know who"" had caught it. Very nice walleye your son had......he should be very proud!"
1490137,Mark R,2012-09-25 18:06:00,1538,"I was fishing 24 inch suckers in Wisconsin over the weekend and had sub 40's take them with a bigger jaw spread than that, so it's hard to say. A really big muskie doesn't let go without a fight if they have a meal that size. We netted one that didn't have a hook in her she just wouldn't let go of the sucker."
1490342,fishinnut 3446,2012-09-26 10:46:00,638,"I was told by Marcel and someone told him 1 of the guides from ""you know who"" had caught it ?If someone else did catch it good for them I've seen some awefull big one's at Dog and in Portage Bay."
