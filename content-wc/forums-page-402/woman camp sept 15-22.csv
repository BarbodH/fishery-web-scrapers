1485793,Mohleye,2012-09-12 14:53:00,368,"Wolf, the only other recommendation I'd make is maybe split your portage days up with a day on the big water in between. Portage lakes usually mean smaller boats with cushions rather than seats, so three days in a row might be more than you want. ( I believe you said you were in your seventies? I'm younger and I'd rather not do three days in a row.) Especially if there are three of you in a boat, you'll appreciate a little elbow room after a couple days."

1485274,MOOSEMEAT,2012-09-11 07:35:00,9,I live in Ear Falls. Paul and Deb are good friends of mine. I also worked at Canada North Lodge for 15 years which is just around the corner from Woman River Camp.
1485442,Guest,2012-09-11 13:53:00,0,"moosemeat now I know why you are such a good fisherman and know the area so well this is our schedule for the week arrive saturday 9/15 at noon fish near camp rest of day schedule for week sunday snakeweed monday narrow tuesday spot wednesday fish the river chain thursday revisit narrow or spot if they turn out productive (do think its worth 2 trips to narrow 1 hr back and forth long day??) friday snakeweed or chain because we leave saturday 4 am and need some rest we have two good gps and have been fishing canada for 35 years are the portage lakes that much better than chain??? come a great distance and want to maximize are best fishing opportunties are there areas on the chain we should concentrate on big woman, little woman ,or little bear??? (some of your favorite lakes or spots on chain I do not know you schedule but if you would like to join us on sunday fishing please email and we can exchange phone #'s;my email [email protected] your thoughts or comments are appreciated jim wolf chicago thanks again for all your help"
1485511,teddi,2012-09-11 16:52:00,349,"What happened to evergreen don? i guess since you don,t work there anymore there is no news about them."
1485522,MOOSEMEAT,2012-09-11 17:31:00,9,Well Rod I still do work there quite a bit ! These people where asking about woman river camp and I gave them info on the lakes there are going to be fishing. Keep stirring the pot it's getting you nowhere.
1485529,MOOSEMEAT,2012-09-11 17:40:00,9,"Good day guys. The lake chain is very easy to get around on. My advice to you is to fish the lakes that intrigue you the most and return to your favorites later in the week. They all fish well. The main lake produces large fish and numbers, you will enjoy it. Usually in the fall I would normally concentrate on litlle and big woman. Typically you are going to be fishing 20 plus feet of water. Big and little woman are your deeper lakes. You guys will have a great trip. I would have loved to join you but I have had a change of plans this weekend. I am bear hunting out of LAC SEUL'S EVERGREEN LODGE. Best bear hunt out there. Sorry that's for my negative friend ROD. Have a safe trip and leave a few for the rest of us."
1485538,HeHooksHimself,2012-09-11 17:59:00,725,"Headed to cedar tomorrow but I wanted to give you my take on the chain since I have fished it a few times. We have been in the fall several times and did well on humps. you can get the depths from there and fish almost anywhere. Little Woman is hot for smallies. Also up the river towards Big Woman there is a rock shelf just teeming with them. We murdered them one fall up to 20"" While the various narrows are great in the spring, we could not get them to produce in the fall. Paul will know what's hot. Chartreuse is almost always the color. There is so much water that you will have a great time exploring. Have a great time Fish On!"
1485626,Guest,2012-09-11 22:40:00,0,moosemeat sorry you could not join us and hopefully you have a great hunt at evergreen;also he hooks himself thanks for your input on the chain will use both your suggestions and will issue a trip report upon returning jim wolf chicago boys
1485644,teddi,2012-09-12 06:15:00,349,Not stirring the pot just stating the facts. Are you going hunting with terry this weekend? we should be up on friday for grouse and maybe a little fishing. there is still the pole barn to get done and the boats to put away.
1476242,Guest,2012-08-18 10:24:00,0,plan on going to woman river camp the week of september 15-22 anyone who fished the camp recently would appreciate information on areas of the lake chain you had success also any particular portage lakes you had success on thank you thoughts or comments appreciated jim wolf chicago
1476717,Rich B,2012-08-19 19:51:00,1081,"Jim, I've looked at Woman camp's website and it looks like a great camp and fishery......I'm sure some of the folks here have fished it recently and will give you their thoughts on the portage lakes, etc. Have a great time on your trip.....no doubt you are counting down the days ! Rich B"
1476722,wallydave,2012-08-19 20:01:00,2151,Hey Jim I hope your trip goes great! Have you tried the search function? The website does look pretty tempting! Let us know how the trip went!
1476838,Guest,2012-08-20 08:27:00,0,walleye dave I did the search and it was helpful latest picture from wrc on facebook bear hunters already in camp and have shot several bears we as fishermen will have to be careful regarding bears jim wolf
1484176,MOOSEMEAT,2012-09-07 13:24:00,9,"Fished Narrow lake a week ago and boated well over a hundred walleye there. It fishes fantasic in the fall. Tea stained water. 1/4 oz orange or white jigs tipped with a minnow. Also fished Spot. Eighty plus walleye the biggest was 27"". We also caught a dozen small mouth bass with the biggest being 20"". Try both of these you won't be disapponted. They run a tight ship there. Good luck."
1484417,Guest,2012-09-08 07:48:00,0,minnow thanks for post sounds like you guys pounded them good at narrow and spot how are portages to both lakes wide clearings both of us 70 but are in good shape and work hard to stay that way just purchased a new garmin 72 h gps and been practicing with it (what a machine);depth of water for walleyes and areas of lake you had success??;did you fish snakeweed (plan to go at least once) heard it puts out the numbers and close by;any tips for catching big northerns willing to troll and cast long periods of time any particular portage lakes or areas of the main chain noted for big northerns;some posted pictures on website show some 20-25 # thanks for help please respond and I will issue report upon returning;leaving chicago september 21 friday morning jim wolf
1484882,Mohleye,2012-09-10 07:33:00,368,"Narrow is about the easiest portage you'll ever find. It's been a number of years since I was in Spot, and not sure I was on the main portage trail, so not much help there."
1484891,MOOSEMEAT,2012-09-10 07:50:00,9,"Good day. The portages into Narrow takes about three minutes and the walk into Spot takes about eight minutes. The trail are clear of debris and are easy walks. Don't worry about the pile of bear crap in the middle of the Narrow trail as it has been there for three plus weeks. We where catching our walleye in 10 -12 feet on Narrow fishing rock structure. Follow the wind. Fish back reef and the island in the second tier was excellent. Paul will show you on the map where these spots are. Spot lake we fishes the weed lines in about 8 feet of water. We fished the first big mud flat and first island all day, no need to move. Again Paul can show you on the map. Did not fish Snakeweed but plan to go there this weekend. It typically fishes great all year. Check it out it is a beautiful lake. Plenty of big northern in all the lakes. You will more than likely catch some on the portage lakes while fishing walleye. The main lake I would suggest trolling deep edges around reefs and rock ledges right now. The water is still pretty warm so they will typically be deep. Have fun. GO HAWKS"
1484951,Guest,2012-09-10 09:52:00,0,mohleye and moosemeat thanks again for all your guys help I really appreciate it will be leaving from chicago early friday morning and will follow all your suggestions and issue a fishing report upon returning;if it turns out as good as I think it will probably return next year the last week of may jim wolf chicago go blackhawks and white sox and bears 41-21 against Inndy great but the real test thursday night in green bay will be watching it in chicago
1485073,Guest,2012-09-10 14:40:00,0,moosehead how did the trip to snakeweed go we plan fish it at least once jim wolf
