1490571,PRO-V1,2012-09-26 19:41:00,142,Wonder what the age of a fish like that would be.? I don't really know anything about sturgeon just wondering is that fish that hardy that it can take all that man handling for that length of time and still survive. Mike

The only fish I've ever had die are ones that were badly hooked. I use what many would consider light tackle and yet Ive always been able to revive fish and presume that if they swim away under their own strength then they will survive. Then again I always go barbless...seems to me thats more critical than reefing them in as quick as possible. I couldnt handle fishing bass the way I see the so called Pros do it...changes the whole complexion of what I consider fishing to be. Heck the 1st time I saw a televised tournament....was both horrified and amused watching them try to rip the jaw outta a 3lb fish....still continues to amuse me. Then they put em into a livewell....then a plastic bag.....flaunt them in front of a crowd ...all the while exclaiming ""how reefin em in"" is in the fishes best interests."
