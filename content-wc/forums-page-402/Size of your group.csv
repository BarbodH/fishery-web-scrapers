1489275,northernbite,2012-09-23 06:29:00,1186,"I take 2 trips a year, one with my cousin and I and another with 8. I enjoy them both. The trip with the 2 of use is in a truck camper fully rigged, the other in July is a tent camp on a island with 8. The summer trip has 8 capable fellows who kick in most of the time, I would say that 6 of the 8 due everything and 2 need to be reminded. Not a bad trip but cooking for 8 is alot of work. I've done this trip with 4 and that is the best number that I like. We are all getting older so I'm sure this thing will change.The trip in camper is for 2 weeks and 3 times the miles and it is simpler because all is on board where ever we go.Paul"
1489565,Golden Eagle,2012-09-24 11:05:00,2642,"Yep, it would have been good. Found out there will be two bow hunters on the lake during my first 9 days. We'll be able to look after each other. Motor issues tend to surface around the end of a long season and slow business has squeezed outfitters when it comes to providing newer equipment. I feel for them. We need to be able to take care of ourselves.I've come close, a few times, to spending a night out on the water, but it's never happened. No reason why it wouldn't be okay."
1490081,1860Angler,2012-09-25 15:47:00,2642,"It is not easy getting together a group of people for a fishing trip. I like to do it in 3's, it cost's a little more but it's nice in the truck and boat to only have three guys. I plan and organize two trips a year, and I always have at least 10 interested, and usually end up with 3-4. This fall trip we ended up with only 3. In the end, I like having 6 the best, not to bad to cook for, 3 guys in a truck and boat, and most resorts can accommodate 6 pretty well. More than 6 starts getting to be to much to control and make decisions. If it get's to be more than 6 then we usually separate into two sub groups, each group plans on there own, it's been a few years since that's happen though!! I have two young boys (6 & 3) so in a few years I will be able to fill three spots on my own (hopefully) and I have buddies in the boat. My 6 year old asked me before we left on the last trip when he could come with to Canada and I told him when he could fish all day in the boat without complaining he could come with, he said he thought he would be 11 when he could do that!! He's pretty good in the boat, not sure it will take him that long!! I miss the big group trips, but the small groups are easier and in the end we still have a ton of fun!!On a 2nd note, I could get a large group together, but I'm not sure I would be able to get through the trip without going insane!! Getting a quality group that all get along and do there part is getting harder and harder!! Nothing worse than a couple of lazy you know what's that don't pull there weight on a trip, or complain about everything, or that disagree with all the fishing spots and techniques, and so on!!"
1490334,Mara5,2012-09-26 10:32:00,209,"Hi all,newbie here, but long time lurker.Our group has been going to Pickeral Arm Camp for 24yrs. The group ranges in size from 21-25. We have the same three cabins each yr. We have one person who puts it altogether, and takes care of the logistics. Ages vary from about 28-85. We have contests among ourselves, awards for any WE over 25"", triple fish award (WE,SM,Pike), etc. Our trip is aways referred to as ""The Classic""."

1488301,MrSimon,2012-09-20 07:14:00,922,"As you all know, good group dynamics on these trips is as important as good fishing ... maybe even more important. I have a list of eight guys that I know all work really well together. Each year I plan a trip based on what I think they will enjoy, then just send out invites to everyone well in advance. Whoever can make it that year does. Some years its three guys, some years it all eight. No matter the combination, we always have fun. I'm always looking for guys to add to the ""approved list"", but I'm very very particular about who that might be. Bringing the wrong guy on a trip like this can really bum things out for everyone. We are all in our 30s and 40s ... so I hope this continues for years to come. Our next hurdle to figure out will be when do we start bringing our kids on the trips?"
1488318,Bill Krejca,2012-09-20 08:02:00,6107,"I started bring my son when he was 8 on our camping trips, plus several of his friends at a little older age. At 39 he is still going with, plus some of his friends, some the same friends. This July, I first took my 14 year old grandson, planning repeat for next year. The point is, it is good to have a mixture of ages, for one thing, the hefting and carrying is easier, they have a high enthusiasm level, and are just fun to be with. Otherwise, as already shared, we get older and other factors start to limit ability to participate. The WC join up feature also looks like a reasonable potential for acquiring new friends.

1488330,vteye,2012-09-20 08:20:00,812,An uncle took me on my first trips as a favor to my father. He opened my eyes to a whole new possibility. 40 years later still doing trips and agree with posts that it is tougher to put a group together. 25 years ago we booked out a 10 room lodge with ice fisherman. Today we are down to 4-6 on that trip and have put together a group of 4 deposits for our first trip walleye to Ontario. The effort is worth it in the long run.
1488363,Babamel2,2012-09-20 08:54:00,414,"when I started going 20 yrs ago, the group was a ""mens group"". THen my kids got to be college age, so I took them, their friends and a buddy of mine. -- two old men and the young guys. As the young guys got married and had families, it transitioned again. I got remarried and got my wife hooked (big time). Now we are content if we go by ourselves. Often we do have another couple, but being alone is fine with us. After all we are part of the 47 per cent who rely on the government -- We are both collecting the money we paid into the Social Security system -- getting our money back."
1488385,Golden Eagle,2012-09-20 09:24:00,2642,"Your dues are current. You paid in. You earned the return. Two weeks ago I went from mutusl funds to cash on 65% of my investments and will go cash with the balance prior to heading out of my driveway early Tuesday morning. Helicoptor Ben belongs back at a university where he can't continue to weaken our dollar. I'm okay now, but inflation could take me down."
1488466,Jaskonie,2012-09-20 13:41:00,80,"When we started out in 2004 we had 8 into Nippissing at the Waltonian Inn,2005 we had 12 at Lake Herridge Lodge and 14 the following year at Herridge, We moved over to Bush Country Camp on Lake Sasseginaga and had 8 in 2007, 10 in 2009, and 14 in 2010. After Art sold the camp we moved over to Horwood Lake in Timmins with 19 guys. In 2012 we had our biggest group of 27 into Loch Island on Wabatongushi. Next year we have spots reserved for over 30."
1488761,mdsn,2012-09-21 09:21:00,121,Congratulations...sounds like you have created some great traditions and memories!By the way...you are not one of the 47% referred to and you are not relying on the Government...that's your money you paid in. The government should have never taken it from you! The 47% referred to are 'net recipients' ones who get more than they did or do contribute. Big difference! Hope you enjoy many years of fishing and getting YOUR money back!
1489171,lassh,2012-09-22 17:56:00,553,yes its harder now to get firm commitments for the next year. Golden Eagle- I'd join you if I could but have work commitments this year. I did a trip to LOW last Sept. and it was a great trip. Maybe next year!
1489181,Smallmouth Hunter,2012-09-22 18:13:00,84,We have had a group of 6 for about 10 years now. Used to be about 10 and as high as 21. We won't really accept anyone new at this point. As someone said earlier it's tough for everyone to get along sometimes. Just easier to go with the ones you really like. We used to take anyone that would go. After we brought the guy that had a Walmart sack for a tackle box and couldn't fish a bit we stopped that.
1488150,Chops,2012-09-19 17:46:00,56,"Is it just me, or is it getting tougher to put a group of people together to take a trip? We used to have 8 people in our group years back, but now it is like pulling teeth to get people to go. They either say they will go and then back out, or they can't make up their mind. According to a lodge owner, they have been seeing groups getting smaller as well."
1488167,wallydave,2012-09-19 18:38:00,2151,"The group I stareed with began with 8 to 10nguys, when asking our goup of 6 about next year, no one wanted go go for next year. So my wife agreed to go with me next year. So I have reached out to some guys here, looking to find a group to join or start a new group. Thanks to the WC administrators there is a Share a seat forum.!! Right now we are looking to put a trip for late season 2014. Thanks again to the guys that have replied on that forum about trying to put a group together. Lots of guys are in the same ""boat"". Hopefully, others looking to keep a good thing going, can use this baord to keep the trips going North! Keep checking around and good luck to all!"
1488180,dog2,2012-09-19 19:02:00,198,"Like wise our group use to be 8,but then our group split into 3 groups of 6 people. Interesting math there it seems some people liked to drink a little too much and they broke off forming thier own groups;sadly out of the orginal 8 there are only 2 of us survining. Since then I keep trying to get a group of 6/8 together. I cannot get more than 4 to commit thier deposit's So we go eith 4 people cost a couple $ more but its 1 vehicle split 4 ways. This past year it was only 2 of us the others missed a great trip.Sorry for thier luck.I no longer wait life is to short .To the ones who are no longer with us all who some where or some how made all of our trips to the GREAT WHITE NORTH memorable God bless them! With the economy; work issue's IT is **** hard to get a good group together and keep it as a unit ."
1488181,phishfearme,2012-09-19 19:04:00,1242,sooner or later all groups have this problem - we have been able to keep ours going thanks to WC. you're not really sure what you're getting but at the very least you'll be getting someone who loves canadian fishing. matching political beliefs or other compatibility factors is another story! phish
1488189,Golden Eagle,2012-09-19 19:19:00,2642,Going alone next week for 9 or 16 days on the water. 12 years ago I put together a trip for 24 in only about 2 weeks when I found out we'd have a fly in camp to ourselves. People jumped on it and we had a great time. Would like to have another person in camp next week. Don't like paddling in late at night due to a mechanical failure. But won't turn down an opportunity to fish. It's worked plenty of times before.
1488199,mdsn,2012-09-19 19:35:00,121,Where are you headed?
1488201,tackleman,2012-09-19 19:39:00,444,"when i started going to Eagle Lake on opening day i joined a group of guys and i was number 14. now i look at the group picture and say, he's dead, he's dead, he's dead, he moved to australia, he's dead, he got religion and quit coming. he's moved out of country, and just yesterday another guy died.We are down to 6 now and have added 1 new guy last year. i've tried to get my son's down but they are too busy working and supporting their families and the worst part of it is, i'm 66 and up until we added the new guy i was the baby of the group."
1488209,Golden Eagle,2012-09-19 20:10:00,2642,"Little Vermilion Lake, just a short flight north of Red Lake, Ontario. Tons of small to medium walleyes and plenty of huge pike. Lots of water for only one guy. Will try to lower it. Just a little each day."

1488212,Hawkfan,2012-09-19 20:16:00,237,"Our group has changed from year to year. We have had a consistent 4 for the past 10 years plus a couple people that go every couple years and a new person or so every year or two. We used to do a fly in and usually had about 6, but one year we were up to almost 10 and another year only 4 of us made it. We started doing a trip to Lac Seul instead last year and had 10 guys. This year we ended up with 11, but were very close to having 16. So it changes from year to year, but it has been a lot easier to find a group when we cut back on cost and a flight in a bush plane. Our core of 4 guys has been going strong for over 10 years now and I don't see that changing anytime soon as 3 of us are brothers."
