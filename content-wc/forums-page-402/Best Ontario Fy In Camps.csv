1488569,Guest,2012-09-20 18:50:00,0,"Went to ganglers the opening week in June this year. Best day 137 pike by myself on Grimes. 43,42,41,several 40s, Multiple high 30s. Fished a 1-2 acre cove for 5 straight hours, could cast across it downwind and caught a fish, missed a fish or had an empty cast every 3 casts for the 5 hours till the plane buzzed us to go. Also caught a 44 pike fat as a hog who outfought my personal best 53 inch muskie.The 137 fish day was Awesome day almost unbelievable. The camp is wonderful. Ken and Wayne Gangler were great hosts, Guides were excellent (my hands werent toast after500- 600 pike)and I never use guides. Good lakers and large eyes also but I mainly pike fished. Food good equipment top notch. Only drawback was cost but you get what you pay for. I want to go again but dont know a lot of folks who can drop 8K for a fishing trip. Do several flyins while there as the more remote you go the more spectactular the fishing. You will have a great time. Well organized. Wildlife every where. Big bears, wolves moose etc. Enjoy"
1488993,zeebee,2012-09-22 07:11:00,1144,"Yup ..... after 30 years of various fly-ins anywhere from N Ont to NWT, I would agree Boois/Trout Lake is a phenomenal lake/operation and thats before factoring in that its a real price bargain. Last two years have yielded 100's of walleyes of good size, a 33 lbs laker and a 46.5"" NP. Picture an A frame cottage right on the waters edge, 3 bedroom/3 bathroom and a dishwasher; some with pool tables in the loft and most with upper level balconies. Never thought I would settle on just one fly-in location but the lake is so big that 20 years of weeklong trips will still leave vast unexplored areas. Next year its two weeks."
1489111,Walleye-Piker,2012-09-22 14:47:00,3,"Winoga Lodge is the ""Ultimate"" Fly-In fishing in Ontario! This is my 29th year going to Winoga. Why change when you know this is the best outfit there. 5 days/10 guys/2500 Walleyes/170 Northerns. Roadhouse is the only cabin on the lake and is totally equipped for all your needs. Check it out! www.winoga.com. Tell them Tom B sent you! Also check out my pics posted in Albums."

1489385,Bear502,2012-09-23 18:04:00,1,"I also have been fishing Roadhouse for many years and agree the fishing is amazing. We fly into Gage lake with Hidden Bay Lodge. Gage connects to Roadhouse from the south. We have fished all of Hidden Bays lakes and and it's one of our favorites. I know the new cabin will be ready in 2013 and it's over the top. As for the best outfitter, Hidden Bay is it. I have been doing fly-ins for 40 years. Over those years have done some trips with other outfitters listed above due to availability with Hidden Bay. Book early the fill up fast."

1486670,wallydave,2012-09-15 05:24:00,2151,Any other fly in fans out there?
1486700,CSH Kucinski,2012-09-15 08:36:00,1340,"http://www.aircochrane.com/We have been going to Air Cochrane for years with no issues or complaints, going back again next June. Many outpost lakes to choose from where you have the lake all to yourself or they have a main lodge where all amenities are available to serve your needs."
1487045,Hawkfan,2012-09-16 16:29:00,237,"It's been a couple years since we've been there, but I have to put in my two cents for Gull Lake through Red Pine Lodge and Outposts. www.fishredpine.com Outstanding walleye fishing and great accomodations. Have stayed at both the north and south cabin and either has great fishing close. I also suggest looking at www.slatefallsoutposts.com. Verne runs a great operation as he was our outfitter for Gull most of the years we went there."
1487068,SinOrSwim,2012-09-16 17:11:00,1528,"I second this. My biggest fish ever have been at North and South Gull. 30"" and 28"" with a whole bunch of 26 and 27's."
1487128,adempsey,2012-09-16 21:18:00,963,"If money was ""not an issue"" for me, I'd be heading to Plummers Arctic Lodge in the Northwest Territories."
1487495,phishfearme,2012-09-17 18:35:00,1242,"mike - i've been watching this thread for some time and have not yet responded - i was not sure what you meant by ""camp"". here's my 2 cents: - for a flyin lodge, consider way north lodge. they have numerous lakes with walleye, pike and lakers available in good numbers and sizes and a full american plan or houskeeping. - for an outpost, i've been to lots and kearns lake north of thunder bay is significantly better than all the others. do a search and see my report from two seasons ago. it's the Taj Mahal of outpost camps. expensive and you need at least 6, probably 8 guys but this is really far above the others. - another outpost option with luxury cabins in walston out of kenora. luxury in the bush. - for a real ""camp"", many outfitters have lakes with boat stashes for either one day flyins or camp setups. talk with faron at excellent adventures, pete johnson at pickle lake outposts or even dwight at thousand lakes outposts (kearns lake). with these outfitters, you can stay at the base camp in very comfortable cabins or motels and flyout every day - not cheap but like faron says ""it's fishing like it used to be"" hope this helps, phish"
1487518,SinOrSwim,2012-09-17 19:22:00,1528,"Beem to Snowshoe at Mandi's Dream with Walston. Beautiful facility. Was a long time ago. Mice were an issue but again, this was a long time ago. Also been to Roger Lake cabin and if you see the picture on their website we had a black bear on that screened in porch. One of our first ever trips and we left a bag of garbage on the screened in porch. Not a good idea. Got some great photos after we stopped shaking all bunched up in one bedroom. LOLThat said, if docks are the same and water is still in the tower, I would do Red Pine Lodge or Slate Falls before them. Having slips for your boat vs pulling onto beach and lake water vs in the tower makes a difference to me. Plus, if I remember they use outhouses vs inside toilets."
1487616,scar,2012-09-18 05:52:00,196,"IADAVE has a great idea! I fished a Boois Trout Lake resort 8 years in a row before we bought our own place near Sioux Lookout. I can/t imagine fishing is better any where for the big 3 - walleye, northern and lake trout. You will not believe the accommodations! The website may be one of the best I have ever seen!http://www.boois.com/"
1487671,Mike Kansas,2012-09-18 08:22:00,1463,"Thanks to all of you for the great information. The guys have made a decision and are going to Ganglers Resort. It is great to see how many of you wanted to help. That is another example why Walleye Central is the #1 fishing forum. Best Regards, Mike Kansaswww.sirmanski.com"
1488224,pikeman14,2012-09-19 20:57:00,144,Ganglers!!?? WOW! You guys are truly in for a trip of a lifetime! When are you going? Please give us a report when you get back. Its not too often you hear of guys going to such a remote resort. Enjoy!pikeman14
1485396,Mike Kansas,2012-09-11 12:05:00,1463,"Have a friend looking for a Top Notch Fly In Camp in Ontario. I don't know much about them and would appreciate any input from the WC gang on where he and his group might go. Price not a big issue with his group. Interested in great fishing. Thanks, Mike Kansas"
1485405,wallydave,2012-09-11 12:24:00,2151,With all of the fly-ins available this thread will be one to watch for future trips!
1485422,onetimedave,2012-09-11 12:54:00,502,We have used Arctic Watershed Outposts out of Nakina 16 times. Walleye and pike with some trout. What are your requirements for a fly in? Write down your wants and then post a again with specifics. This will make your choice easier.
1485469,IaDave,2012-09-11 15:04:00,476,Never been but if I ever get to retire it will be on my list to do.
1485497,clearis,2012-09-11 16:14:00,47,"Take a look at Oak Lake Lodge ( http://www.oaklakelodge.com ). Fishing is pike and walleye, though there is a nearby lake with smallmouth bass. Food was outstanding. Guides are available and very reasonable. I was there three years ago. Lake is catch and release except for shore lunch. Fishing was outstanding."
1485501,NARDA 1,2012-09-11 16:20:00,636,Give Kelsey at Wilderness Air a call at 1-800-760-0924 or go to their web site at www.great-fishing.com they run a top-notch operation. Terry
1485567,michigan walleye guy,2012-09-11 19:23:00,95,"Dave and Michelle run an absolutely top-notch fly-in outpost service. The amenities are wonderful (see the new beach cabin at Larus Lake), but it is the fishing that ensures that their outposts are nearly always filled up way before the season opens. I have been going with them for about 12 years annually now, and have never had less than an awesome trip. Go to www.nestorfalls.com to check out their outposts, and they will also send a well-produced DVD, highlighting all they have to offer. World-class fishing at a reasonable price, IMO."
1485580,Ogoki,2012-09-11 19:46:00,291,"I have just completed my 36th fly-in trip . Have used 6 different outfitters . By far the best I have used is Mattice Lake Outfitters . They recently purchased the former Armstrong Outposts camps . They have camps on big lakes , small lakes and two multi cabin sites . My wife and I are already booked for a 9 day fly-in trip for June 2013. Service , boats , motors and cabin are A1 . The main thing is great fishing . I was up the last week of August and my biggest three walleye were 26 1/2 , 25 1/2 and 25 1/4 . Had large numbers of walleye too ."
1485608,LeeMB,2012-09-11 20:53:00,83,If your looking at first rate Fly-Ins do not exclude Manitoba. Lots of top shelf lodges there.
1485745,wallydave,2012-09-12 12:28:00,2151,"Eddie North http://eddienorth.com/ is a fly-in at the top of my bucket list! Every one that has been fishing with Eddie has posted great reports! Trying to put a trip together for 2014 with NWO, http://www.northernwilderness.net/ so they have a vote from me too!"
