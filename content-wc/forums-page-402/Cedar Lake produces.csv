We had tough fishing the first few days, but caught enough to eat and have fun with. We tried everything from 6'-34' of water. We jig fish with minnows. There were 5 of us in 2 boats. This is our 5th time to the lake. We located good numbers of fish in 26 f.o.w. with 3 days left. We caught 205 fish on our last day in snow and rain. We caught a total of 591 walleyes for the week. We have counters in each boat, to keep accurate count. We did that after our successful 2009 year.Those last 3 days were a lot of fun. We had 2 Canada rookies with us, so it was quite the treat for them. I believe they are spoiled for future trips, we all know this does not happen often.For some reason, we did not catch many northerns, probably less than 2 dozen all week, and only 4 small muskies. We did not fish for either species.W fished an average of 9 hours a day, in all conditions. We wore rain suits 5 out of 7 days, either because of wind, rain, or snow. We fished the west end of the lake. We only ventured to the east end once, without much producing. We tried after dark, but they always shut off shortly after getting dark. I cannot say enough about the resort, they really know how to take care of thier customers. I used to go by Ken on this board a while back, if you want to read about previous trips.We are heading back up in spring, our normal time to up there.That is it for 2012."

We did not have your luck, more like your first few days. Of course, fishing is always better than what I would have been doing tho. Glad to hear you tore 'em up.Fish On!"
