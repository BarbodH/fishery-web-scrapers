1489719,Superfluke,2012-09-24 18:23:00,13,"Sharing the experience of the week...my friend Mike and I just returned from a week in the wilderness of NW Ontario Canada, fishing Beteau Lake with Eddie North's Attawapiskat River Adventures (http://www.eddienorth.com/). This is our second trip with Eddie and was every bit as good or better than our experience in 2010. As has been well chronicled here, for an outpost, this camp is about as good as it gets in terms of being well run and accommodations/ amenities. Eddie continues adding amenities including a Sat TV, an additional sleeping cabin, full-time, full camp electrical enabled via generators and plenty of refrigeration/freezer capability. The amenities make it lodge-like under an outpost scenario, primative but with super amenities as well if that makes any sense. He is also building himself a small log cabin which looked spectacular despite being what I would guess is 80% complete. Eddie is a superbly conscientious outfitter, ensuring all of his equipment is functioning and all guests' expectations are being met...In terms of the fishing, we caught pike to 45"" and eyes to 28"", with 26"" 's a daily occurence . Had many, many daily big pike encounters, including multiple days of gators taking interest in our stringer of 1-2 eyes intended for dinner. For the eyes we almost exclusively jigged plastics and casted swimbaits and silver minnows in any area 3-5 FOW with weeds that we could find. Water was even lower for us than in 2010, so we were limited in terms of where we could fish. Sharing the camp this week, we met Allan (""newhips"" here on WC) and his sons, Ross and Craig. They had an outstanding trip as well with lots of big fish and obviously some great father-son fishing time. One of Eddie's relatives (cousin I believe) Jason and his friend Trevor were also in camp this particular week. Great guys with Trevor taking home all of the week's big fish honors with a 47.5"" and two 30"" eyes as well. Thanks for the great trip Eddie!!!! (WC Admin - I have a bunch of pictures to share, but it seems I can only add them as url links..is there a way to get the pics to show up directly in the post???)..."
1489775,TIGHTLINER,2012-09-24 20:44:00,223,EDDIE IS IN A CLASS BY HIMSELF HARD TO FIND ANOTHER OUTFITTER DO WHAT HE DOES FOR HIS PEOPLE ONCE THEY GET INTO CAMP. HE KEEPS ADDING AMENITIES TO HIS CAMP THAT YOU WOULD ONLY FIND AT HOME. TO BE THAT FAR NORTH AND HAVE TV CELL SERVICE IS REALLY PROVING HE WANTS TO MAKE HIS PLACE BETTER. MY HAT IS OFF TO EDDIE HOPE TO SEE YOU AGAIN SOMEDAY. HOPE HIS MOOSE HUNT GOES WELL
