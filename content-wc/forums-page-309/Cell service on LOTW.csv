3096489,Slushfish,2014-08-17 06:07:00,263,"Just got back from Nestor Falls. Verizon has free text there. For $15 YOU GET 1000 ""no roam minutes"" I paid the $15 and think my wife made one, two minute call. Oh well, better safe than sorry."
3092465,dakotahunter12,2014-08-15 11:39:00,470,I will be going to Kenora on the lake of the woods this week for the AYA tourney. My ? Is this. I have verizon phone service and was wondering if those of u that have been there before where charged international rates for this area. I have to be avaible for work so turning off the phone is not an option
3092561,Gunner_Fletch,2014-08-15 12:48:00,74,I'm sure you will be charged. Nothing's for free. I know I was when south of the border. Cell service is somewhat sporadic anyway depending on where you are on the lake. Why on the lake this week? AYA isn't until 23 Aug. Are you in the tournament?
3092641,dakotahunter12,2014-08-15 13:09:00,470,We r in the tournament. We r going to make a vacation out of it and we will be bringing our boat along to prefish/fish for fun. We have rented a house boat
3092665,Gunner_Fletch,2014-08-15 13:24:00,74,Very nice.....I'm actually guiding in the tournament. Hope you enjoy our beautiful lake.
3092817,dakotahunter12,2014-08-15 14:16:00,470,"I am sure we will, Kids are very excited. I told my wife at the beginning of the season that out of all the tournaments I fish there was two that I really hoped I'd win, the cabelas national team championship and AYA lund event unfortunately I did not win the NTC on Greenbay but seeing the smiles on the kids face when we won the AYA was worth even more. hopefully we can find the big girls on LOTW like we did in the regional event."
3093345,lassh,2014-08-15 17:59:00,553,"you will be charged international rates. Rogers is the main carrier on that part of the lake. You can get a short term plan through your carrier for a certain amount of calls, texts and data. My carrier is AT&T and I sign up for a limited canada plan. The shortest term they allow is one month. This is cheaper than paying roaming international charges."
3093369,Gunner_Fletch,2014-08-15 18:07:00,74,Have you been in contact with your guide for the tournament yet? What is his name if you don't mind me asking?
3093385,oldccm,2014-08-15 18:21:00,109,What about buying a Canadian phone and forwarding calls to the Canadian #?
3094225,Smallmouth Hunter,2014-08-16 06:51:00,84,Verizon is .89 cents a minute but has free texting. I didn't believe it either but I was not charged anything for texts in June. Not on a special plan. It's a deal they have. Call customer service and ask. I had my wife call 3 times to make sure. They even emailed us a document that showed it. That was at Moore Bay Lodge on LOTW.
3094529,dakotahunter12,2014-08-16 08:22:00,470,I have done that multiple times when We went to Mexico but Verizon will not do that anymore Now u have to change your plan to include International and then I will loose my unlimited data
