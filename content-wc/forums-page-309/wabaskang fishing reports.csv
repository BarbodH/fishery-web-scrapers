1986170,Guest,2013-07-27 14:27:00,0,"Just returned from Jim and Julies. Fishing was pretty good, weather was tough! We caught some really big walleyes, 30, 29, and 3 in the 27s, all from cabbage weeds on big jerkbaits. Most of our walleyes were caught while casting in the late evening, but we did manage a few of the big ones during the day hours when it was cloudy/raining...which was basically all day wed/thurs! We caugh a good number of keeper walleyes down in Keynote along the weedlines and also up in the big lake on the traditional late summer spots including: Devils, Doe, Birch, and the big weedbed along the north shore. Northern fishing was tough for the real big fish. Our biggest was 39, with a ton of 34 and 35s to go along with it. Our best tactic was casting jerkbaits on deep weed edges, but open water trolling deep running shad raps and other divers was very effective also. Thurs in the rain we pounded the 25 to 30 inchers in the shallower weedbeds that were wind blown. Finally, we also caught some 35s along the windblown rock ledges in Jim's part of the lake and up in McCloud and Aerobus. All in all a fantastic walleye trip with a few decent norhern thrown in to make if interesting...can't wait to get back up in a few weeks as the bigger schools of walleyes should be transitioned out to the deep structure and hopefully the big pike will start to return to the deep weeds to feed. Any other reports??? Anyone know or hear who is putting up the huge cabin across from Peffley's? It looks like a nice place!"

1990530,JIGSTER,2013-07-29 13:24:00,30,"Returned sat. from our trip to Kingfisher. Good trip overall, weather didn't cooperate very well, but didn't keep us from fishing everyday. Talked to several regulars and they fishing was slow to average at best for that particular week. So being my first time on the lake we struggled a little bit to find a consistant bite. Fished alot on the big lake, did ok at times on the 18-20 ft. flats. and on various dropoffs in the 12-15 ft range. Chartrouse crawler harnesses and silver spinners w/minnow seemed to work best. Looking back probably should have given more time to jigs and minnows. Didn't do very well on northerns, apparently wasn't in right weed beds. We tried all of the usual northern baits. Did catch a 39"" while walleye fishing, was the highlite fo the trip for big fish. Biggest walleye was 23.5"". Caught around 70 walleye for the week, counting big and dink, so we ate well and brought our fish home. Learned alot about the lake so i'm sure well do better the next time. The resort was nice and the people very friendly, everybody in the family decided we would not hesitate to return. Mike I did talk to some of the guys in your group on the water, sounded like you all were haveing a good week, thanks for you reports. Curious to hear any other reports the next few weeks."
2005425,AB,2013-08-04 17:47:00,61,"Just returned home from Wabaskang Lake. Celebrated my Dad's 70th birthday while there. My Dad's first trip to Wabaskang Lake was in 1970. My brother joined Dad and I on this trip. Had a great time. We are walleye fishermen and did quite well but worked hard to get them. Fish were scattered and it seemed were not in the typical pattern we are used to but later in the week they were moving deeper. It seemed the walleyes were still relating to weedlines early in the week and not yet to deeper water structure. I think the recent cooler wet weather, late ice out, and higher than normal water level had something to do with that. We caught fish in some of the same places we did in the 70's and 80's! Many great memories for Dad, brother and I."
3079361,Guest,2014-08-11 13:47:00,0,Looking for any new information on fishing at Wabby...anyone come back lately?
3097001,Big Mike,2014-08-17 09:41:00,35,"Just returned and had a great trip that august usually produces. Walleyes were the trip saver as they were plentiful and easy to catch on many different techniques. We did most of our damage with light jigs in green cabbage. Hoards of fish are still in the weeds and were fun to catch by simply pitching a jig and minnow into the pockets along these weed edges. Others were using Linda rigs and also bottom bouncers along the edges and doing well. Some bigger 26 inch plus size fish starting to appear on the reefs in 20 to 28 feet, look for that to really get good this coming week. Evening bite for big walleyes was very good also as we had a 31 inch fish and many 25 inch plus caught right at sunset on big jerk baits in the weeds. Man I love the feel of a big walleye crushing a suspended husky jerk! Northern fishing was a little tougher this week as we noticed a lot less fish in the weeds and started to get most of them trolling deep water. Did good in the evenings casting weeds as the big ones must come back in for a short feeding window. We only had clouds for one day so that didn't help either. Can't wait to go back next week as the temps are going to fall and the pigs will come back to the weeds where we will throw jerk baits and big rubber at em all day! Next week will be walleye time on the deep reefs too..report when I return! Mike"
1917218,ksand774,2013-07-02 17:21:00,51,Any fishing reports on Wabaskang Lake? I will be going up there the end of July. Also is there any tackle or colors of tackle that works best? Thanks
1917634,Joek3,2013-07-02 19:23:00,244,Check out Peffleys Wilderness camp website for reports. Good info.
1917842,UKBDM,2013-07-02 20:09:00,178,"Just got back Sunday. Mostly fished the southern part of the lake. Still a jig bite with jig/minnow edging out jig/grub/crawler although both were good. We found new weed growth in 8-12' of water and drug the above combos along the bottom. Water temp was 68-72 and water levels are high. There was a hatch just starting in Keynote on Thursday but I know a guy in camp caught two 30"" monsters 3 min apart in the same spot down there that day. We did catch a few bigger fish with spinner crawler rigs in deeper water. I boated 18 pike between 22-30"" but never found the big ones. Trolling big baits with planer boards was the primary strategy. Smallmouth were still hitting top water early in the week but that slowed as the week progressed. We caught 8-10 fish in that 16.5-18.5"" with one 19.5"" being the biggest. This was our fourth consecutive year at Jim and Julie's and we are starting to really understand the lake. I need to start spending more time up on the big lake and in some of the narrows but we have had very little problem catching fish within 15 min of camp. Good problem to have."
1925634,ksand774,2013-07-06 12:12:00,51,Thank you for the information.Anyone else fish later in July and have some tackle advise?We are staying at Sleepy Dog.
1957009,JIGSTER,2013-07-17 08:14:00,30,"Any current reports from Wabaskang? Leaving friday for our first experience on wabaskang. Taking my wife and teenage son. Any advice for beginner on the lake? We have alot of experience with spinner and lindy fishing, not to much crankbaits. I'm sure we will get some starter advise from the resort, just looking for some ""extra tips"" to enhance our outings. Also my wife likes to do some perch fishing in the afternoons for some extra action, where are good areas to start looking for them? Thanks in advance for any help,"
1959681,Guest,2013-07-18 00:21:00,0,"Hey I will be up there as well. Alot of the info I have depends on the area of the lake you are staying but I would use the tackle you are comfortable with. Spinners and Lindys will work great, with crawlers and minnows. I would fish cabbage weed edges on the ""Big Lake"" and any wind-blown point on the rest of the lake. If you are staying at Peffleys you will do well in the last lake before the falls, if you are staying at Jim and Julies you will do well in McCloud or even Keynote. Very little need to travel more than 5 to 10 minutes to find fish. 3 weeks ago the mayflys were terrible so I am sure we are past that and the walleyes should be making there way out to mid-lake structure where the lindys and jigs will shine. Don't overlook cabbage weeds though especially in the evenings with bigger lures like Rapalas, Husky Jerks, and Super Rougues casted and allowed to suspend, this is where you are most likely to catch a trophy walleye, imo. Be prepared to go out early to get your walleyes if the weather is warm, sunny, and calm. Then fish northern in the late morning/afternoon. Come in around 4 or so and eat/relax, then get back out there by 7 for the evening bite! Good luck...what will you be fishing out of and which camp...I will say ""hi"". Mike"
1959953,JIGSTER,2013-07-18 06:44:00,30,"Hi Mike thanks for the reply!! We will be staying at Kingfisher. Fishing out of a 16' white alumnacraft with a 40 merc, Iowa license. Would love to say hi. Where and what will you be in? Not afraid to travel to get to the good fishing if necessary.When you say the last lake before falls are you talking the ""big lake"" or the one past peffleys and to the left? If you had to choose between running up to the big lake area or to mcloed and keystone this time of year which would you choose?Also my son really is looking forward to some good northern action, any advise on where to start for some good slimmers? 24 hours till we hit the road, gonna be a long day at work!! lol Thanks again, Rick"
1962297,AB,2013-07-18 19:02:00,61,"Big Mike, I'll be up the week after you I think. Let me know how it is - always love your reports. Sounds like your son had a blast when you were last up."
1962825,Guest,2013-07-18 23:33:00,0,"AB...I will try to give a report mid-week when I'm up there for you. Its been awhile since I've posted on here but will get a little more active for all the faithful! Jigster, I would not hesitate to try both areas....north of Peffleys and down at Keynote. Generally the area north and west of Peffleys which I call Mean Lake gets really good this time of year as fish are migrating out of Gawleys bay into either Mean Lake or Big Lake. There are a ton of cabbage weed beds and weed edges up there that your son will be able to get alot of action. Keynote is generally better in May/June as it warms faster and holds alot of pre/post spawn walleye/northern. There are fish that stay down there all year though and its a must try lake especially for the scenery if anything. Staying at Kingfisher really puts you between both spots. If its really windy out of the west I would go down there because it won't be too rough like the Big Lake will get. Good luck and I'll try to say hi. What part of Iowa? Me too...Waverly area Mike"
1963057,JIGSTER,2013-07-19 06:27:00,30,"Mike i'm not far from you, Fort Dodge area!! Thanks for the advice and hope you have a great week. We are getting ready to tarp the boat and head out, spending the night at the border to break up the trip for the family. Stop by if you see my white boat bobbing! Rick"
