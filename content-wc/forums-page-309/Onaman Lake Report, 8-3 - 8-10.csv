Overall, fishing was very good. I managed to pull in one 28"" and one 27.5"" walleye. There was one other 28"" caught by another group that week, and a 30"" the week before, so a 30"" is a real possibility in that lake. We flew in from Nakina with another party of 4. The leader of that group had fished the lake in June of this year and caught a 30 on that trip.Other than those two giants, I caught a 25.5 and 25. My son's biggest was 24. But those were the only big ones, the vast majority of fish we caught were in the 15 - 17"" class. On several days, I was surprised we caught any fish at all, since there was almost no wind and bright blue sky. Several days, the lake was like a glass table top. There was no rain for the week, and only a few clouds with highs around 80 most days and touching 85 the last day. I was fishing in shorts & flip-flops and caking on the sunscreen.My son and I found a large weed bed in the back of a shallow bay. We spent parts of the last three days pulling in fish after fish trolling and casting around that weed bed. I have no doubt that if we'd wanted to, we could have caught 300 fish per day in that one area. I have never seen walleyes so highly concentrated and aggressive in one area like that. But to be honest, it starts to get kind of boring. I'd put down my spinner with a crawler and get a hit about every minute or two. It was literally one after another. Almost all of those were around 16, but I did manage to find a 25.5 and a 23 in that area.When we weren't fishing the weed bed, most of the time it was pretty much like any other Ontario walleye lake, that is, it was pretty hit and miss. We'd pick up a few here and there, but nothing outstanding. I'm sure there were other spots with high numbers of fish, but that was the only one we found.The lodge itself is quite nice. It's small - only four cabins plus the owners' cabin. There is a separate building housing four individual three-piece baths. The bathrooms are numbered and assigned to each cabin. From inside, it looks like any other modern restroom with a flush toilet and shower, it's just that you have to put on clothes and walk out to it in the middle of the night.Overall, a very nice trip. If you're considering a trip with Bauers, you'd better hurry. I think they are already completely booked for next year. I didn't rebook since I don't know what my situation will be next year. I might regret that. I hope I get a chance to go back again.Feel free to send me a PM if you have any specific questions."

My son tossed around a #5 bucktail Mepps in the weed bed area and caught several nice ones. The biggest was just shy of 36"". On average, the pike we pulled in were quite a bit bigger than those we'd ""accidentally"" catch on Lac Seul. I'd say 30"" was a pretty common size. I was told there are huge pike in the lake, but my son's was the biggest I heard of being caught that week. I don't think anyone at the lodge was trying for them."
