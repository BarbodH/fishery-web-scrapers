3083929,1jigfish2,2014-08-12 20:47:00,110,"We caught 3 tullibee/cisco last September, while fishing walleye in about 31' water. They were 12"" - 15"" long. The lake also has burbot, only caught one of those over the years. We have caught: burbot, cisco, muskie, northern, walleye, perch, crappie, bluegill, smallmouth, and whitefish. I probably forgot something, but I think that covers it."

3086681,Ranger6200,2014-08-13 15:09:00,5,"I'm heading up with the family the day you guys are leaving, the 6th and staying until the 13th. Appreciate the offer tho. I did get word from a fellow walleyes unlimited member that was up there 2 weeks ago that they did very well on the east end of the lake fishing deeper (25-30') back trolling crawler harnesses. They were primarily fishing off the structure by gull island and bald rock. He said the smaller fish were on top or right off the sides, but the larger eyes were a hundred yards or more off the structure tight to bottom. Hope that helps you guys out. Good luck up there"
