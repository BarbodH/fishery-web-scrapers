I have been going to the Chapleau Area for 15 years. This being the 1st time I took my own boat. Normally I do fly-ins. If I ever return to Chapleau it will only be to use Canadian Airways for another fly in. I have gone with Denis a number of times and he is excellent. There will be no other reason to go to Chapleau. This trip I hit a rock and damaged the lower unit of my outboard. We were really in a jam, stuck way down river, including our camping gear, food, and a broken boat. To make a long story short there were 3 people that really went out of their way to help us. 1) Debi at NAPA did everything possible to find us parts as fast as she could; 2) Terry who agreed to tow our boat in (and this was quite a job), along with finding a neighbor 3) Andra who loaned us his personal boat for free. If it were not for them we would still be stuck down river out of Chapleau. No help from the outfitter, or anyone else was interested in helping us. We couldn't even rent a boat! So unless I do a trip with Denis as noted above, I have no reason to go out of Chapleau again. I will look for other areas to go out of. No wonder Chapleau's tourist trade is declining! Tom"

I think I'd want to go back??? phish"
3077857,Whopper,2014-08-11 05:54:00,340,"First off sorry to hear your trip turn south on ya. I had somewhat of a similar experience many years ago. I was taking my father to Missanabi and broke a leaf spring on my boat trailer half way between Wawa and Chapleau. Long story short limped into town and a fella at the gas station couldn't fix my problem but sent off for my repair parts, then sent me up the street to the visitor center where we were hooked up with someone that owned a camp up stream that was more than willing to let us stay on their property while waiting for trailer parts. Ended up staying for five days and having a good time, caught lots of small pike and perch but didn't catch the first walleye. Everyone that helped us more than willing to lend a hand and asked for nothing, even the guy at the gas station only wanted for me to pay for the cost of the parts and shipping. Even though the trip turned south on us and we never got to where we had originally planned on going I was able to spend some quality time with my dad and met some amazing helpful people. Sounds like you were disappointed but it sounds like it could have been a lot worst. Be thankful"

After setting for 1/2 a day for him to show up he said I can't rent you one, and yes he had boats available. Next, I never said the help was free, only the loaner boat from the last contact possible. And, I never said the help didn't come without a hefty price. Reality is I would think in a tourist town an outfitter would be wanting to help. That wasn't the case. In fact he told one of his customers he didn't want them to tow us out with his boat. However difficult you think it was to get the help take it x10 fold. I hope this doesn't happen to you, just because I wouldn't wish this on anyone regardless. I just know that if I were somewhere an I person needed help I would go out of my way to assist."
