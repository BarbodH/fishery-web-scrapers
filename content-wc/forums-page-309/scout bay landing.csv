3088441,Yaba,2014-08-14 08:16:00,88,"Ya, Ive been there in the past when they are there. Never really been an issue unless its a day when there lots of others there, then it can be a bit of a pain to find a parking spot."
3089441,prov1800,2014-08-14 12:29:00,5010,Ive seen people park by the hydro line.thats nuts.does get busy there.
3091417,Skywagon,2014-08-15 05:49:00,1106,I have never had a problem when the commercial fisherman are there. Interesting that they were the ones that upgraded the road/landing. Beats the daylights out of pounding down the road to Williams Bay.
3083377,bigwillies,2014-08-12 18:18:00,515,just wondering what users of the landing think of the commecial fisherman using it.having a refridgeration unit running 24/7 and their junk laying all over the place.people used to camp there(nice spot)but haven't seen anybody since they mooved in.personally i think it is b.s. turning a public spot into their own fish factory.
3083625,Limeyangler,2014-08-12 19:40:00,563,Pretty @#@#@ campground even before the whitefish barges parked there.
3083865,Yaba,2014-08-12 20:30:00,88,I think they are there every year at about this time. Was there last year when they were cleaning fish....never seen so many pelicans.
3084441,prov1800,2014-08-13 06:19:00,5010,Theve been doing that for years.its there job.there are two big camper trailers parked there for the last couple of weeks.ive been there a few times and there isnt a lot of junk laying around and their polite.if it wasnt for them using the launch there probably wouldnt be one.they maintain that road and the launch..
3087041,bigwillies,2014-08-13 17:44:00,515,maintaining the road and landing.that's funny
3087249,btmbncr,2014-08-13 18:51:00,492,"I've been using the landing 2 days short of a month and there has been campers set up there several times for several days. Fisheries has contacted these guys and are having them remove whitefish.They've always been friendly and courteous to my wife and myself.This afternoon I watched locals,after loading their boats on the trailers, walk over and throw their trash in some of the fish boxes."
3088105,prov1800,2014-08-14 06:33:00,5010,Couple of years ago they had the road gravelled and they had that concrete pad put in.before that it was launch of the bank.it used to be iffy launching in low water years from the shoreline.at least now you dont sink into the loon ****.that launch was slated to be shut down also.all the resort owners especially fisherman's cove wanted it gone.so its only open because of them guys using it as a access point once a year.so i would say we are all pretty lucky.
3088185,bigwillies,2014-08-14 07:14:00,515,guess i got the wrong info.was told by a fella years ago at a bait shop in the bay(no longer there)that it was tax dollars at work to put the new pads in.don't even remember how long ago that was.
3088249,Yaba,2014-08-14 07:27:00,88,"Ill be useing the scout bay landing a couple days next week, anyone know if the commercial guys will still be there...."
3088329,prov1800,2014-08-14 07:50:00,5010,They might be done.but if there still there thats no big deal.there not in antibodies way.ill be launching there Saturday and sunday.
