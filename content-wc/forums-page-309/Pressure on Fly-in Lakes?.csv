We don't know how that relates to miles of shoreline, islands, bays, cuts, reefs, etc. 6 people every day for six months? Low pressure compared to... what? I'd consider it low pressure in comparison to most lakes around me and a lot in Canada too."
3090081,Bill Krejca,2014-08-14 15:12:00,6107,"Food for thought: At one time, I was of the presumption that most fish I caught, mostly in the more primitive lakes, had never seen an artificial before, nor had ever been caught. After much thought on the matter, I now feel that almost all game fish of any size, in fish-able waters have probably been caught multiple times by anglers. Now, more than in the past, with the many slot, etc rules, It is my opinion, my opinion, that, with fish again living longer, these big mommas have been out in the sun before. In lakes having a max keep size, I'd almost venture that some of the big mommas have names given to them by the locals. Just my opinion/thought, can't prove anything. Bill"

3091273,octanehi5,2014-08-15 03:24:00,1104,"On a fly to lake the pressure can be controled by the amount of fisherman the outfitter allows on the lake. most fly in operators in Quebec, fish from mid may to mid sept. 4 months give or take a week, A drive to lake gets three to four times the pressure,verses the fly in. I do not believe walleye have a memory,as to what they bite on. they feed when they are hungery.I have caught fish with other jigs in there mouths. The number of fish harvested has a great deal to do with the population of a lake,as well as slot limits"
3093905,adempsey,2014-08-15 22:18:00,963,"I doubt it's anything to be concerned with if there is no road access.However, I always wondered about all those snow mobile tracks I see on these remote lakes. A lot more than I would have expected. Not sure people are fishing them, but the tracks are definitely there."
3094825,brochet,2014-08-16 10:31:00,88,"ive been fishing fly in lakes in northern quebec for 5o plus years im also a bush pilot .I think in answer to your question,is not a simple one .to what degree do you call a lake being pressured,if one fisherman takes one limit out that's that many fish less left.if your talking trophy pike,they can be fished down very fast.and never come back.it takes 20 years to grow a 20 lb pike.walleyes can take a little more pressure.ever year I would have to go further north to experience the same quality fishing.if any of you ever experienced truly virgin fishing you would know what I mean."
3096273,Yaba,2014-08-16 22:11:00,88,"Most of the fly in only lakes in NWO really only get 8-12 weeks of fishing per season. Some lake may deffinetly get fished more, but never 6 months continued activity."
3084753,MrSimon,2014-08-13 07:25:00,922,"I've always thought of fly-in lakes with a single outpost cabin as being the ultimate in un-pressured fishing. But, I got to thinking. If a 5x1 mile lake gets fished by 4-6 guys constantly for six straight months .... is that a lot of pressure, or zero pressure? If there were a particularly good bay, shoal or hump ... its possible that those fish could see hundreds of lures go by every single day. It almost makes me think that small fly-in lakes could actually be MORE pressured than certain areas of large expansive drive-to lakes. What do you guys think."
3084817,NickDalasio,2014-08-13 07:35:00,34,"I agree, especially with walleyes, which are usually found concentrated in 5% of a lake. If enough guys fish the hotspots over & over again, it would make sense that the fish get wise. I'm sure we've all fished areas where the fish just nibble & peck at the bait, rather than aggressive feeding...."
3084825,SinOrSwim,2014-08-13 07:36:00,1528,"I think it is a combination of things. If that lake has conservation rules only, you can catch those fish but most of them stay there. The other thing is depth and food source. Doesn't matter how much it is fished if the lake itself will not support a lot of fish. If there isn't adequate food and depth the fish never get very big or in big numbers. I'll be interested to read opinions from people more qualified than me on this."
3085081,38bill,2014-08-13 08:23:00,331,"I have been fishing the same Canadian drive in lake for 15 years. Its a small lake with one lodge and zero other homes. Prior to the opening of the new lodge the lake didn't have a functioning camp on it for many, many years. You would think that when the new camp opened the fishing would have started out great and been going down hill ever since but its been the other way around. Fishing has just become better even with the huge increase in fishing pressure. Maybe the lake actually needed the fish population reduced slightly so there would be better year classes and more forage. We are catching a nice range of sizes so the outlook continues to be good."
3085305,fishron,2014-08-13 09:18:00,317,"I think a lot has to due with the management of the lake. The fly-in my group fished this year (Hebert in Quebec), was very productive for both numbers and size. The outfitter controls the keeper size and numbers to be kept. I personally think that walleye are very resilient and can be caught many time in their lifecycle. I caught one apparently healthy 17 incher that had a wad of monofilament trailing from his mouth. I removed as much a I could and sent him on his way. I believe the size and the depth of the fly-in lake are a huge factor in continuing productivity. Hebert is 12 miles long and the deepest part I could find was sixty feet, much of it being twenty to forty. Not a bad thing. Shallower lakes are more productive. It stands to reason that plant growth and bottom critters need less depth to thrive. Lake Erie, the shallowest and smallest of the great lakes was the most productive great lake before overfishing and pollution changed it. Fishing pressure certainly is a big factor, but I believe through regulation an special characteristics a fly-in can retain great fishing."
3086049,Mike Borger,2014-08-13 12:14:00,1554,"I believe that yes, some fly in lakes certainly do see more pressure than your typical portage back lake. Definitely not more than a drive-to destination though. Even if certain drive-to camps currently see few anglers, historically they've been pounded far more than any fly in lake ever possibly could.I've done a lot of fly in's over the years and never once had a bad trip fishing wise. And that includes some awfully small lakes."
3086833,Guest,2014-08-13 16:07:00,0,"As a state fish and game worker it would amaze me sometimes to see what came out of the trap or gill nets we placed in certain heavily fished waters. You would be lucky to get one or two if you fished there with bait, and we would load the nets with crappie, perch or walleye all the time in such lakes. Bass don't trap well, gotta electrofish them. Then we electrofished some of the waters as well, and came up with good numbers of big fish of all types, people rarely ever catching them in any sort of numbers that you might expect. Occasionally numbers came out low and you would think, how could anyone get a fish in there? Some lakes with poor spawning have the low populations. So, fish can be very resilient to being caught and very often there are many more in there than people actually know. Electrofished a 28"" brown out of Spearfish Creek in South Dakota once, no one suspected he was there."
3087017,onetimedave,2014-08-13 17:39:00,502,"Have been doing fly ins for the past 18+ years with the majority being to Melchett Lake out of Nakina. We always purchase conservation license and believe most fishing this lake do the same. If anything the fishing has improved since we first started going. As with any lake ""U"" need to know the lake to be successful. Each year we find fish in new spots along with the old favorites. Lots of water entering Melchett makes this a fish factory. I don't believe this lake can be fished out."
3087185,Guest,2014-08-13 18:26:00,0,"Lake Erie is still the most productive, more fish come out of Erie each year that all of the other great lakes combined.... !!!"
3087585,phishfearme,2014-08-13 20:40:00,1242,"if fishing pressure is defined as harvesting - most all fly in lakes receive very little of this ""pressure"" compared to the number of fish in these lakes - especially if the lake is mesotrophic (very fertile - like a lake with a river going in and out). but I think a better definition of pressure for this discussion should be lot of fish (walleye here) being caught and released. in my experience, in a given area, the catching simply slows - the rate of this ""slowing"" is probably proportional to the number of walleye in the area. the fish either move or just don't recover enough to be able to be caught again - at least in the same day or more. on very small lakes, a group of anglers can indeed catch such a large fraction of the walleye that they seem to have disappeared - they ARE THERE but just don't respond. for large lakes, the fish population is so large that the ""slowing"" is not noticeable - or there's just so many other spots to fish that you can just move and find ""fresh"" fish. so, I think the size and type of lake makes significant difference here - and even though a lake may be big, the amount of fishable area may be small so it acts like a small lake - many single cabin fly in lakes fall into this category. phish"
