The blueberry crop is poor.We got spoiled the last two years.Raspberries are everywhere and plentiful but towards the end of their season.Bill"

I have been going up to Canada for over 20 years and we have seen a couple bears (long time ago) and my brothers saw a wolf a couple years ago we have never seen a moose???? I should say I have never seen one. Two years ago my father in law went with us for the first time. We were all (6 boats) heading out to fish for the day. Their boat wasn't working quite right so they went back to get a different boat. On their way out to find us they watched a moose swim across a bay as they followed from a distance, get out of the water, shake off, look at them and walk into the woods. THey got some great pictures. His FIRST year with us and he sees that and neither me or my two brothers have ever seen a moose. I'm beginning to think they are fake LOL"
