First the fishing wash great, caught tons of walleye and pike. Took my son muskie fishing for the first time and he caught his first every muskie. A tiger muskie to be exact he was on cloud 9. The weather was fantastic all week long we ate good food just a all round good time. Can't wait til next year."

We caught enough fish for shore lunch every single day, and had no problem limiting out at the end of the week. We were catching bigger Walleye & Pike than we have in the past, and it was just a fantastic week of fishing. My son caught a ton of fish casting a Rat L Trap. On a few different occasions, he caught fish on 4 consecutive casts. If you don't have a couple of those lures in your tackle box make sure you pick some up. The fish pretty much knocked all the paint off of his lure. Gord runs a fantastic camp."
