Spool new line, then change your mind and go with braid, then change it back. Tie up some in line spinner rigs, all of your own making, color and style, don't worry you probably will either not use them or lose them with in the first day or 2 anyway. These answers to your dilemma come from years of going thru the same thing. have fun and be safe."
