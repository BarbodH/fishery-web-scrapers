3078321,Kwags,2014-08-11 08:27:00,48,"Just returned from Wabakimi Lake trip with Rusty Myers . With me on this trip were Joe, brothers Bill and Jerry, all of us in our 50's, and Joe's son- in- law and nephew, The ""Youngers"", who are both in their 20's.Uneventful flight from Pittsburgh to Int Falls, landing at 12:30 pm. After picking up our shipped stuff at Border Boxes and store trip for snacks, its off to the border and Rusty's!Border guard was very nice. After the usual questions of what we were packing (alcohol, tobacco, etc.), the only other was how much overweight do you think you'll have to pay? Youngers definitely did not follow my packing advice. Made it to Rusty's, took care of bill while plane was packed (they did not weigh so no overweight). Plane ride took a little over an hour, as I recall. Unloaded and started out.Now to the fishing: water was high for August, more like spring levels. This sure did make it easier to get in and out of Lower Wabakimi. It also changed our strategy a little. Sturgeon rapids and the inlet from the Tew were fruitless to try, as the current would blow you back down river too fast. Before you ask, no, we did not have anchors. Exact opposite up the outlet at River Bay. Current going out was strong enough that we did not want to end up at Kenjoi.River Bay Wiggle Waggle produced fish, but smaller. Much better was the main island in that channel. Lots of 18-21 fish.Lower Wabakimi had very good fishing. Mostly humps and deep shorelines. By far, though, the top daytime producers were the main lake reef and the east shoreline of NOW bay. When the wind was right, you could drift these spots and catch fish as long as you cared to. Mostly 18 to 21 inchers, but quite a few in the 23-24 inch range. Why did I say daytime before? Well, the youngers figured something out the second day and kept on that particular strategy the rest of the week.The wall (I think Pikeslayer calls it the corner?), the upper entrance of Lower Wabakimi, was really good in the evening. The younger guys were with us that first time having good success. It was getting dark, so Joe and I said we were heading in. The Youngers stayed on and did not come in til 11:30. We were a little concerned and had actually gotten our stuff on to go look for them when they showed up. The reason they stayed so long into the night is that literally hundreds of walleyes (I may be exaggerating!) entered the channel below the wall at dark. Every cast with a crank produced a hit or a fish. As I said, they fished that stretch every subsequent night. They reported back they shined the light in the water and saw some real bruisers. Sunday night was their best for numbers. 50+ fish in just a little over 2 hours. This from 2 guys who don't really fish.Odds and Ends- Stopped by the Trappers Camp per PikeSlayer's directions. Its really deteriorated, but still interesting.- There was some kind of insect hatch going on at night while we were there. The carcasses would be floating at the shorelines in the morning. Don't think they were mayflies? In August?- The Youngers had a huge lake to fish, but kept parking the boat to go explore up creeks and such. They found another cabin on Lower Wabakimi that I've never heard anyone speak of. Interestingly, Bill and Jerry ran into 2 boats of 5 people late in the week who were staying at that cabin. Unfortunately, Bill and Jerry are not as inquisitive as I would like them to be. They found out: one fella in a boat, in his mid-80's, is part of the original group that started this camp in the 50's. He is the last original left. He is from California, and brought his grandkids up to see the place. He stated he probably would never make it back. He remembers the other cabins being built. I wish they asked more questions. I could've probably gotten a group off here to buy them out!- Best lures  I went a little over the top on Paddletail baits this year. The Northland Paddletail minnow (thanks to Mike Borger) was my top producer on a ¼ ounce jighead. Close second was a Basspro Paddletail grub. The walleye really seemed to like them. Others were drifting with spinner rigs, and surprisingly, a 6 inch Powerbait paddletail. The other guys did well with the same plus shad raps and swimbaits.- Pikeslayer had mentioned on his trip report that the outfitter he uses (NWO) was experiencing a slowdown. I can second that with Rusty's. The pilot who brought us in said he had not been to Wab for three weeks prior, and didn't know of any trips after us. Different pilot picked us up, and no incoming group. There was no one at NOW our week, and a group of three at Pipestone for only looked like 3 days-Had a good time on my third trip to Wabakimi out of over 25 trips to Canada since 1992. It's a really interesting lake with lots of structure where you just can't get bored. Think we were finally figuring some things out after two prior trips. Special thanks to Pikeslayer for the tips on his favorite spots."
3078681,Lovetofish,2014-08-11 10:19:00,458,Nice report. How were the bugs?? They were brutal in early July.
3078825,Kwags,2014-08-11 11:02:00,48,"bugs were there. Black flies got me on the ears. Ankle biters played havoc. Mosquitos were thick and bothersome in evening. I'm used to September fishing, so it was something to get used to. But do you ever?"
3079129,Mike Borger,2014-08-11 12:22:00,1554,"Thanks for thee detailed write up, sounds like a fantastic trip!Glad to hear you did well on the Northland minnows. I just returned from White River yesterday and those same baits were a killer for me again."
3080265,Pikeslayer8,2014-08-11 18:15:00,1460,"Hey Kevin, great report, great to have some Wabakimi news in August. It was fun to meet up with you and Joe last month in Clarksburg. Bummer that you didn't get to fish the inlets or outlets but you guys did a great job in finding the fish. That outlet up on River Bay can be a scary one. So, the island up River Bay you guys had success on, is this the island just before ya get to Wiggle? You said you had good luck on the east shoreline of NWO bay... Are you saying the shore across from the NWO camp and out to the point towards Rusty's? We've never spent much time trying this, but you know how it is.... The NWO guys fish in front of Rusty's, Rusty fishes in front of Pipestone and Pipestone fish in front of NWO and so on. Lol Now, the upper(northernmost) entrance to Lower Wabakimi we call ""Rusty's Back Door"" as it is behind your camp. I'm thinking you mean the southern route that has a high cliff. we call this spot ""The Chute"". The Corner is behind the Trappers camp at the back end of Glacier Bay. The Trappers camp, while cool to see even in it's 33 year abandoned state, is just on the way from Rusty's to The Corner. Hope you made it back there. The camp on Lower is very intriguing to us. We very rarely fish that part of Lower Wabakimi and we didn't even know it was still there. I was only there maybe once or twice some 25-30 years ago. I remember one time we came across this camp that there was a small float plane docked there and we found the guy fishing not far away. He said that he was was drifting the mudflats with a spinner and heavy sinker. A concept that was foreign to us at the time. Did ya inquire with Angie about June availability? Sure would be fun if we could be on the lake at the same time. It'd be one he11 of a party, that's for sure."
3080465,Kwags,2014-08-11 19:26:00,48,"Mike -I really like those minnows. Couldn't have had better advice Than from the ""godfather of fly ins"" Bill - up river bay, it was the second island back from wiggle waggle, out farther in the bay from the shore. It drops from 5 feet to twenty five pretty quick, and the wind blew back toward the island that day You are right on the NWO shore, toward Rusty's from NWO. Nice and deep there for August. The fishing in front of NWO is so much better than Rusty's! The chute is where the Youngers found all the walleyes My real motivation was to put your snooping skills on the lower Wab camp so that we could buy that group out. I wish I had more info on that guy, but I could never run Into him. Angie is supposed to get with me on June.. PM me on your exact week. I don't want anyone else to horn in on the feast you guys have! Again great to finally meet you. To all, I had the ultimate privilege to meet Bill this spring. He lives in Colorado, but his roots are in my hometown, Clarksburg, WV. Family business brought him here, and we arranged a quick dinner meet and greet. Lo and behold, when Joe and I arrived, we had innocently horned in a extended family dinner. All were gracious and made us part of their event. We actually closed down the restaurant. He has an awesome family, and it just goes to prove that Walleye Central makes deep connections also. Maybe the biggest thing to take away from this is, if you are In my home town, i would be available for a free dinner and Canada fishing tips,"
3083057,Pikeslayer8,2014-08-12 16:44:00,1460,"It's been a few years since I've been in Rusty's camp, how did you find the condition of the camp? When I did stop, I found their camp journal. Of course, with my snooping nature, I read it. It was filled with your ordinary Wabakimi fishploits, but what I found most interesting were the harrowing tales of bear in camp. More than one party would describe how a bear would come when everybody is asleep and try to get in the cabin by crawling under the floor and bust up through the floor. Lol One party described the sheer utter terror as they lay in their bunks with a bear scratching and clawing under the kitchen floor eventually breaking through. Thought I'd tell ya after you got back. C'mon Rusty, bear proof your cabin! These pictures are 3 or 4 years old"
3084105,Kwags,2014-08-12 22:35:00,48,"Oh my, LOL. We've never encountered any bears ar Rusty's. There is an island 50 yards from the dock where we take any fish waste. I guess visitors before us do the same. Sounds like some do not and get a ""friendly"". Why do some people don't even think? The cabin is still fairly comfortable, but hasn't been maintained honestly. No repairs to the deck and the roof need replaced badly. We do our absolute best to clean and repair while we are there, including steel wooling all the pots and pans and the stove. There are pillows that are absolutely horrendous (joe refuses to burn anymore) and the Pantry usually has 28 cans of peaches and untold numbers of peanut butter and Tatar sauces packs of unknown dates. The boats need attention, all leak and the motors aren't in too good of shape. That said, when you can sit on a couch or chair in the evening instead of just a bunk bed, you begin to appreciate what you are getting for the money. Been to other camps with a lot less"
3084505,515,2014-08-13 06:29:00,254,Thanks for the report we had the same kinda hatch on your trip in Mid July and I had never seen this kind of bug before but the eyes were full of them. So it was something they obliviously liked to eat.
