To download I just hit the ""share"" button on the top right. It saves onto your phone/tablet and you can open that from inside the app. Then, download to youtube. You have to have a youtube account set up I think? I haven't attempted to try and download to edit yet? My son and I are going to try and make a youtube video of our trip. That will take awhile. maybe what I should do is use my tablet and download it on there and be able to edit the video?"

3084689,SinOrSwim,2014-08-13 07:07:00,1528,It's the pilot. kidding. Actually if you get into trouble with control you just take your hands off the controls and it stabilizes and hovers by itself. Can't fly in heavy wind but in light wind it adjusts for the wind to so it will hover in place. Only downside is the short battery life.

3091473,Skywagon,2014-08-15 06:11:00,1106,"I saw an article that the OPP (Ontario Provential Police) at Kenora have been testing one, no reason to think the MNR won't have one in their tool bag in the future. When someone invents one that is submersible, with the capability to identify fish under water, sign me up. One would be a great asset in determining if there are walleye in some of the little pothole lakes that are too much trouble to get to (not knowing if there are even any walleye in them). Those of you that do the fly-in's know what I am talking about, a million lakes, wonder if there are fish in them?"
3091529,Hawker,2014-08-15 06:32:00,3967,"Great video! I've got the AR Drone too, just haven't figured out yet how to download the video's and pics.Are you using your phone or a tablet for your controller? I've got mine set up to run with either, but like I said, haven't figured out how to download the vids. Also, are you using the standard battery that came with the drone? I've got that one but also bought the extended life battery that gives me about ten more minutes of flying time per charge with that battery.Thanks for sharing, that was cool!!"
