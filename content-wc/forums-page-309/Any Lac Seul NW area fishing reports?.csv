Mainly targeting Walleye. Tips on depth to fish, areas, bait & lures would be great! Also, how high is the water? Please post after Saturday too if your just returning! Almost all packed & ready to go! Can't wait! Thanks! RBF"
3028961,Yaba,2014-07-25 06:08:00,88,"Fished Scout bay a couple times in the last 2 weeks, the first outing the fish seemed to be scattered but mainly in about 12' any colour jig and minnow seemed to work, lots of slot sized fish, it was quite windy but fishable, second time the wind was incredible and it was tough fishing, trolling crawler harnesses in the calm side of islands in 14-17' got us several in the 26' range and several small fish as well....wasnt able to get a limit tho...fishing in the wind was not possible (for me anyhow) and jigging produced nothing!Water is up over the top of the ramp at the scout bay landing!Good luck let us know how you do....I cant wait to get back in there again!"
3029009,Mrnovice,2014-07-25 06:46:00,75,"I was there week of July 12. Fished with jig and minnow only and had great success. Fished mostly at 15 feet but did catch lots at 5-8 feet. Caught many 23+ inch fish. Biggest was 29 with a few 27's. weather wasn't the nicest the first 3 days but the fish bit once you found them. Had to bounce around some and try different spots.. Was a first timer on that part of the lake so I really had no hot spots to go to. Just hit points and such. For us, it seemed the fishing really slowed down in mid afternoon. Went out in the evenings with little success."
3057337,Hawkfan,2014-08-03 12:46:00,237,Just looking for more reports. We go up in a month.
3057409,mswope13,2014-08-03 13:37:00,73,"Group just returned from our stay at Evergreen Lodge. Pat once again provided us with great lodging and reliable boating. Without question was one of our most successful fishing trips we've ever experienced! Our first day was the only day we didn't find the fish, however, success was had by those fishing at 9'. The eyes turned on from Sunday to Thursday and we found them anyware from 10'-22'. We focused on Steamboat area and Thursday was an absolute day to remember. Fished from 9:00-1:00 and they never stopped. Jig colors didn't much matter. To break things up, we took the boys trolling for snakes with #5 mepps where we were able to pick up numerous pike with the bigs being 34-36"". Also picked up some slot eyes while trolling for pike in shallow bays. Biggest eye on our trip was 28.5 with numerous 24-25's. Water temps stayed pretty consistant at 68-70. We don't count fish caught, however, we did keep track of doubles and had 23 in a 4 hour span, absolutely incredible."
3058393,Hawkfan,2014-08-03 20:16:00,237,Perfect! That's exactly what I was looking for. We will be at Onaway in one month.
3058601,rather-be-fishin,2014-08-04 00:57:00,429,"We just got back from a week of fishing Lac Seul out of Fisherman's Cove resort on Scout Bay. It was a great week of fishing! Walleye were in anywhere from 20-35 feet on Sunday then 10-15 feet on Monday & anywhere from 8-35 feet the rest of the week. It was important to scan the areas with your electronics before stopping to fish. We had 2 brief rain storms that chased us off the lake around 3pm on Monday & Tuesday. Still got out to fish after the storms. We caught tons of smaller walleye 12-16 inches, which I was glad to see for future class of fish. We also caught many in the 20-26 range. No problem limiting out on freezer fish and also had a meal or two of fish. Weather was in the mid 70s with winds ranging from 3mph to 15 mph averaging 9mph mostly N, NE or NW winds. We used primarily jigs 1/4 to 3/8 with minnow and crawlers and both worked good. Also, good luck on a Willow gold spinner or Tommy Harris Spider Spinner. Didn't catch as many Northerns as usual, which was good. Biggest Northern was 36"". Fished mostly points on McKenzie Bay & Bay of Islands islands and reefs. Also good luck in Ghost Narrows, a reef North of Manitoba point and islands South of Manitoba Point. Caught some 25"" fat Walleyes in Scout Bay after the storms blew through too! The water is still high approximately 2-3 feet or so. In the morning heading out we always saw lots of log/tree floaters so had to be on the look out at all times! I am disappointed to say after 12 years of fishing Lac Seul, this year I did experience the horrible fishing behavior I have heard about on Lac Seul for the first time. We were always told by the resort owner/guide that the Canadian rule is, if there is a boat on a spot don't stop & move on, it's a big lake (150 miles long) and lots of areas to fish. I had 2 boats move in on us on a reef I had marked with markers almost backing their boat into my marker but after some glares they moved off. Then we got up early and got out to a hot spot point on McKenzie bay and were slowly trolling a small area for several hours and a boat pulled up within 6 feet of our boat and electronically anchored right where we were trolling and then 2 other boats that were with him, also pulled up within 6 feet of us and anchored too! Our rod tips were almost touching their boats! They were from WI. Grrrrrrr.....needless to say we had words! They didn't care and had no fishing courtesy what so ever! Just what we want to do is drive hundred of miles to fish within 6 feet of 3 other boats....just like they do in MN & Wisconsin....NOT!!! It was not the Canadian fishing experience I was looking for! I guess they can't find good fishing spots on their own! All in all it was an awesome week of fantastic fishing fun with great friends and I am already counting down to next years trip! RBF"
3058913,Aspencreek,2014-08-04 07:41:00,2911,"Rather.....May I apologize for the inconsiderate @$$9007 from the Badger State. Seems that every year it gets a little worse. But I'm sure they were first timers and used to fishing back home. They come from all over and in all shapes and sizes. If you do enough fishing on LS it will happen and more than once.The running joke around our camp is ""How do you start a traffic jam in MN....throw out a marker bouy!""That being said, try using a ""fishermans bait"", a brightly painted bleach bottle with an anchor. When I'm fishing a particular spot, I will throw that out, about 50 to 100' from the spot I'm concentrating on, and see how many boats I can catch. It's remarkable how many will motor up and start fishing right on top of it. It's a HOOT! Had a boat from IA come in last time up and not only drive over it but got it caught in his prop. I motored over while they were trying to get it undone. When untangled I took it from the water, spooled up the rope and thanked them. When asked what for, I explained why I do it, and they were the biggest catch of the day. They acted very sheepish, and ashamed, gave them some tips on spots and tactics and drove off. Didn't see that boat again for the rest of the week. BTW.....did you get up into ""No Name"" or hit South Islet at all?"
3060049,bigwillies,2014-08-04 14:29:00,515,ihave found on ls. the worst thing u can do is throw out a marker.kinda like flies to s@#t.bin fishing there all my life and agree that things r getting pretty bad.had a guy accuse me of stealing his marker bouy at scout bay one time(even thouhg i was the only boat there.guess he left it from the morning fish.)still good fishin though
3060241,Further North,2014-08-04 15:16:00,2008,...so a really good way to have a ton of fun would be to take all the marker buoys I never use and leave them in places I know there's no fish.....Hmmmmm.
3060305,Aspencreek,2014-08-04 15:49:00,2911,"YES, don't leave them, just throw them out and count how many boats you catch. Pick them back up when you leave. It's amazing what you will find, we keep track for the week, total up where they are from (camp boats, which state, glass or aluminum, etc.) Last trip winners were IA with MN just 1 behind and remarkably enough Glass boats (with big electronics) I guess spending all that money either gives people a sense of entitlement, or justification."
3062617,fishingMN4eyes,2014-08-05 14:31:00,108,Leaving tomorrow for a Wednesday-Sunday trip out of Goose Bay. Will report when we return.Appreciate the earlier reports posted here!
3078569,fishingMN4eyes,2014-08-11 09:52:00,108,"Got back yesterday from our three day trip out of Goose Bay. Most of the walleye caught came out of 6-10 feet of water. We caught fish deeper as well, but the most luck we had was with wind blowing(which is did the first two days of our trip) the first two days over reefs or over shallow points extending off of islands. Our last day of fishing(Saturday) was less windy than the first couple and we still caught fish in shallow, but not as many. 15-25 feet of water seemed to to produce fish in our boat on Saturday with the lack of wind. We also found a 17' top that we picked up quite a few fish on. First day we ran to Steamboat int he morning and every spot we had fished last year seemed to have at least one boat on it. We ventured over toward Cox Island and found a couple good spots up that way and fished almost by ourselves the entire afternoon. The second day we ran down to McKenzie and had really good luck down there. McKenzie surprisingly wasn't too busy but that didn't stop some jackwagon from driving right up to us on the first reef we decided to fish that morning. Don't understand that. Plenty of places to fish and it was pretty early in the morning, not like we had been sitting on the spot all day or anything. Yet this guy had to drive right up 40-50 yards away from us and fish right on top of us. Third and final day we went back to the Cox area and that was where we found the 17' top and the other boat in our group found a goofy 14' spot off of a rock pile and they literally couldn't keep fish off the hook for a good hour or so. Resort owner said Steamboat was the place to go but, like I said, too many boats down there the day we tried and we weren't about to go crowd in on other boats/spots.We fished primarily jigs. Color didn't seem to matter. Minnows and crawlers didn't seem to make a difference either. My fishing partner fished a slow death crawler rig and picked up a decent number of fish that way as well. Lots of walleye in the 10-15"" range and our boat didn't catch many slot fish(but it sounded like the other boat in our group did pick up a decent handful). Big in our boat was 26"" and I think that was the only over we caught. I caught quite a few northern this year while walleye fishing, way more than last year. Fun trip as usual, good luck to anyone heading up in the next few weeks!"
3060145,Aspencreek,2014-08-04 14:48:00,2911,"RBF......another reason we don't go up into McKenzie very often. That area gets hit HARD everyday, and there are guys I know that go there everyday while on their trip, no place else!!! Plus you get the boats that come down from Ear Falls, all congregating in the same area, gets busy in a hurry on a nice day. Those guys crowd in...I guess I would too if that's where I was told to go after an hour boat ride!! For those reasons we just don't go there. Then again it isn't getting any better from Manitoba pt all the way down Windigo. I've got a Hundred other spots to hit and another 1000 to explore. Glad to hear you had a great trip."
