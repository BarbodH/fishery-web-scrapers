3084929,biggamefisher,2014-08-13 07:53:00,540,Good one!
3086145,Mr. Sauger,2014-08-13 12:45:00,285,"No, but probably would need a drivers license.But seriously folks, check the regs of what is required crossing the boarder back into the USA."
3083617,Ranger6200,2014-08-12 19:37:00,5,I'm reading different things online so I figured I consult the experts. Does a 12 yr old kid need a passport to drive into ontario?
3083721,Obabikon,2014-08-12 19:57:00,2370,"A 12 year old does not require a passport to return to the United States... simply a birth certificate. 16 years of age and older do need passports. Canadian customs do not require passports to drive in, that's a U.S. rule!"
3083737,3 Z's,2014-08-12 20:00:00,133,"Pass Port not required for 12 year old, but must have birth certificate. Not sure what is needed if your spouse, or child's mother, is not with you. Years ago someone told me you needed a certified letter from the mother indicating she knew you were taking the child out of the country? I've crossed several times with my 12 year old daughter, birth certificate only, but always with both my wife and I in the car."
3083753,Ranger6200,2014-08-12 20:03:00,5,Thanks for the clarification guys
3083841,jiggster,2014-08-12 20:28:00,183,"It is best to have a letter giving permission from your wife. In the letter have where you are going. Have the letter notarized. Not always needed, but best to be prepared."
3084185,kzoofisher,2014-08-13 04:07:00,5144,"Never had any trouble so long as I pack lots of clothes around them after I duct tape them and shove 'em in a duffle bag. +1 on the notarized letter. Unlikely you'll be asked for it but it's great to have if you are. Takes five minutes to get it notarized at the bank. Include your entering and returning dates and all of Mom's info as well as your destination. To whom it may concern, I, Mom's name, am aware that my son/daughter _______ will be traveling to Camp Megafish in Podunk on the 32nd of August with his/her father. They will be entering Canada at _____ on the 32nd and returning at the same point on September 24th. The camp can be reached at 555-555-5555 and I can be contacted at (add day and evening phone numbers). Sincerely, ___________"
3084209,Obabikon,2014-08-13 04:29:00,2370,"With a 12 year old, you shouldn't even need the letter notarized. Just have her sign it, and make sure her cell phone number is on it. If you're bringing an infant or small child, notarized is the best way to go."
3084409,SinOrSwim,2014-08-13 06:15:00,1528,"http://travel.gc.ca/docs/child/conse...tement-eng.pdfhttp://travel.gc.ca/travelling/children/consent-letterI just did this a couple weeks ago. I used this letter they have on a website. It was easy to fill out and I had my wife sign with it notarized. I was NOT asked for it but I will take it with if I do it again. Also, states under 18 and not 16, not needing a passport. Honestly, this was the easiest and quickest border crossing I have had going both ways in over 20 years. Partly because I didn't have a bunch of beer to pay duty on I suppose?"
3084425,biggamefisher,2014-08-13 06:16:00,540,"You say you have been reading different things online............did't you go to the CBSA (Canada Border Services Agency) site, info is right on the front page and even includes a printable pdf sample consent letter(as also posted above)!http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/travel-voyage/td-dv-eng.htmlIMO, the only reliable information would come from them, here is the information pasted from the website;Travel with minorsBorder services officers watch for missing children, and may ask detailed questions about any minors travelling with you.We recommend that parents who share custody of their children carry copies of their legal custody documents, such as custody rights. If you share custody and the other parent is not travelling with you, or if you are travelling with minors for whom you are not the parent or legal guardian, we recommend you carry a consent letter to provide authorization for you to take them on a trip and enter Canada.A consent letter must include the custodial parents' or legal guardians' full name, address and telephone number. Some travellers choose to have the consent letter notarized, to further support its authenticity, especially if they are undertaking a significant trip and want to avoid any delay.When travelling with a group of vehicles, parents or guardians should arrive at the border in the same vehicle as their children or any minors they are accompanying."
3084729,MrSimon,2014-08-13 07:17:00,922,"Last summer I took my 15 year old nephew across with me. We had his birth certificate and a signed letter form his mom. I handed them both documents along with everyone else's passports. They never even looked at the letter, but it seemed like they were pleased I had it."
