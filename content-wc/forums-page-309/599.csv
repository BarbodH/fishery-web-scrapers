Had to have my boat trailer repainted. Also had a truck splash a bunch of rocks my way and broke out my back window when it bounced off my boat."

There is always some kind of maintenance along that stretch, but nothing major that we encountered.North of the town of Savant Lake there was a stretch of fairly new gravel from about the Sioux Lookout turnoff (516) to somewhere past the Wildewood parking lot. (Just north of Troy & Penny's bait shop) Don't know how far north it goes though. It could be sealed by now?Anyone been to Pickle Lake? They would know. If you are going no further north than the town of Lake Savant, you probably are OK.Pooch"
