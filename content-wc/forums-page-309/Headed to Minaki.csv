3036337,Powerstroke Diesel,2014-07-27 20:06:00,45,"Just returned from Minaki on Friday after fishing for the past 6 days. We had some success on Big Sand, very little success on Little Sand. Some were fishing in Washtub (between Big and Little Sand) at 50' depth and bringing up big fish. We stopped in and watched and saw some big fish that were belly up. We decided that wasn't for us. We found the fish in the River south of Gunn Lake. Any place where the channel necks down. Caught them in 28 to 35 feet. At that depth, you still need to be careful in bringing up the fish. Fortunately, the big ones don't come up fast anyhow."
3037025,Aaron-IN,2014-07-28 06:43:00,500,"When you are up there sometime you should give the crank bite up on the main lake basin of Big Sand a shot if you are looking for the big eyes. Those fish are usually suspended under large schools of cisco/shad in about 10-15 ft. of water, sure beats bringing them up from 50 ft, that's just down right ignorant."
3037289,briand,2014-07-28 07:50:00,48,"I've seen one of the lodge owners with guests at the washtub bringing up fish from 50' before and releasing fish that would float up. Keep in mind this was before slot size but they had a full limit already and was trying to give away 25"" plus fish away so they could keep on fishing.Good for you for moving on.On another note ...little sand was still good to us given the crappy weather this weekend"
3056105,Bigiver,2014-08-03 06:35:00,94,"Sorry for the delay, I thought I posted this but it didn't show up. We returned last weekend after seven days at Minaki. All in all a fun trip. Most of the party has been up for around 10 years and the rest of us for about 20 or so. We caught quite a few over fish but no where near last few years results. Most everyone caught one over 25"", several 26""s, 27""s a few 28''s a 29"" and a I managed to fool a 30'+ with a crawler. We live bait rigged with crawlers and leeches on the reefs and shoreline breaks in 29 to 35 feet in both Big and Little Sand Lakes and pulled some plugs in the evening long linning in the deep water in Big Sand. We also caught a lot of small fish 8' to 12"". The biggest problem, other than the Black Flies (worst we have ever had), was the lack of slot fish. If my addition is correct the 10 of us only boated 26 slot fish for the week. Not many meals of fish! That must be a problem for the big pike and muskies as well as we seemed to have a substantial increase in the number of attacks on fish as we reel them in. The water remains high but didn't cause us any problems. I have a question about the Washtub. Where is it? We stay on a island between Big and Little Sand and the only place I see people fishing deep water with consistancy is in the channel by the high banks. Is that what people call the washtube?"
3056497,woods,2014-08-03 08:33:00,646,"The washtub is the bay just east of the high banks, on the north side."
3057577,Bigiver,2014-08-03 15:00:00,94,Well I'll be! We stay on Dead Boy Island in a Sand Lake Outpost Cabin. The Wash tub must be close to us as we are east of the highbanks at the entrance into Little Sand and to the North. In six years staying there all we I've seen are musky guys buy us. When we stayed in town I never paid any attention. With all the little fish this year the deep water would be wise to stay away from because of the mortality. Thanks for the info.
3059529,markb11,2014-08-04 11:02:00,196,What's the best place to put your boat in at Minaki area?
3061473,briand,2014-08-05 07:23:00,48,For free boat launch try Pistol Lake
3080633,Powerstroke Diesel,2014-08-11 20:15:00,45,Bigiver The wash tub is just west of Dead Boy Island
2996498,Powerstroke Diesel,2014-07-14 21:03:00,45,"We are headed to Minaki, ontario, Canada on Friday. Any recent reports? We know the water level is high and a lot of floating debris, but we are more interested in fishing report. Thanks."
2996666,oldccm,2014-07-14 22:07:00,109,PM TinmanDon he's there right now.
2998322,briand,2014-07-15 11:25:00,48,"Lots of fish over the slot and tons below, and at time rather tough at least for the last 2 weeks.I myself have not been to big sand to fish so I cannot coment about thereBut in little sand with a spinner and worm has been productive with 2 28"" and 1 30"" last weekend. All three did spit up shinners but was unable to obtain live minnows as Minaki was without power last weekend due to a storm and lost all there bait fish.Water temps was in the mid 60's"
3000234,Powerstroke Diesel,2014-07-15 19:49:00,45,Thanks for the info. Ill let you know how we do.
3000578,Bigiver,2014-07-15 20:56:00,94,Thanks for the report briand. Congrats on the nice fish. Like powerstroke diesel our group is also heading up on Friday and I was glad to here fish are biting. Briand is the high water coming down any? How is the current? Are the fish on the reefs yet or are they still on shoreline structure? We normally fish both Big and Little Sand and hope fishing continues to pick up. If you check in TinmanDon would love to hear current report. Thanks to all for passing on the info. - Bigiver
3001178,DeBo,2014-07-16 07:11:00,211,"According to the LWCB website the water is still very high. The latest bulletin had LOTW levels coming down a couple inches in the next 7 days and more or less no change to the Winnipeg River at Minaki. I know they mentioned in one of the bulletins recently that the Norman dam was wide open letting as much water through as possible. I'm guessing that is still the case. We arrive on Saturday for a week. Will be interesting to see the high water at Minaki. Did a short trip to LOTW at Morson in early July and it was tough reading the shorelines when looking for spots with the water in the trees. That was a first time trip, but I go to Minaki every year so it will be interesting seeing the spots. I suspect many of my reference rocks will be under water....."
3001322,Bigiver,2014-07-16 07:36:00,94,"DeBo we also go up every year. Have been on an Island between Big and Little Sand for about the last five or six. I saw the picture of the water surrounding the Minaki Marina shop building. If the water is still up five feet we may be tying the boats up to our patio. I am wondering what the high water is doing to the fishing. If the fish are on the shorelines, in the current or have finally moved to the reefs. Water temps in mid sixties could be any or all of the above I guess. I guess we'll find out when we get there. Maybe briand or Tinmandon will give us a heads up. Looks like if we want minnows we need to pick them up on the way. What ever it is we are all itchin to get up there and will be a great time no matter what. I will post when I get back- good luck to us all. Bigiver"
3002306,briand,2014-07-16 10:53:00,48,Water is crazy highI personally have not fished big sand or any reefs as of yetI have recently over the years never felt the need to travel to big sand to fish. So far this year I've been doing well off points but all the big ones have come from aimless trolling along shoreline in little sand ( not completly aimless ) Sorry no gps or fav spots to be provided.And worms have been the ticket for me on spinners.With any luck and the forcast is for more stabble weather perhaps the fishing will go from good to greatGood luck
3003074,Bigiver,2014-07-16 14:24:00,94,"Thanks again briand. Was not looking for GPS spots but just generally. We have been up there at least once or twice a year for the last 25 or so years so we have lots of spots. We fish Little Sand about half the time. We have a few spots on Little Sand that may be hard to fish with a lot of current. Always seem to catch some fish and have a good time. We were there two years ago when the tornado came across Little Sand scarred the nightcrawler bedding out of me. Well we are off in two days and can't wait. Fishing trips are like Christmas morning, ever since the first thr worst has been good. Bigiver!"
3008250,Bigiver,2014-07-18 07:03:00,94,"Bags are packed and am ready to go! Leaving at 2:00am should be fishing by 5:00pm tomorrow. Thanks to all gave us reports, will share when I get back. Bigiver."
