508234,Guest,2000-06-14 12:38:00,0,What is the name of your camp operator? i may be able to help you. I know someone who is going there next week.
508235,Guest,2000-06-14 13:16:00,0,"The on-site manager for Smoothrock Camp is Debbie Alexander. I think she is a new manager this year. We are flying in with Thunderhook Fly-ins. They have a few outposts in the area but we are staying at the (8-10 cabin?) camp itself.We are leaving June 22 to drive up from Central Wisconsin and will be there from June 23rd thru 30th. Depending on your friend's schedule, we will probably pass him on-route or be there the same week he is. Has he been there before?"
508236,Guest,2000-06-14 20:21:00,0,I have never fished smoothrock but I have fished out of thunderhook outfitters. I have fished two of their outpost lakes. The fish seem to relate to main lake points and humps as well as flowing water. Islands or main lake points that have a feeding shelf attached to deep water were the most reliable. Most of our fish came on spinners and crawlers. We also did well once the fish were found on slip bobbers with leeches. Northern early and late on top water such as zara spooks. The lakes I fished had a defined weed edge that also held walleye. Take at least a flat of crawlers for 4 people for 5 days. We caught mostly 2-5lb eyes and northern to about 12lbs. E-mail me with any more questions if I can help. A portable depthfinder is a must.
508237,Guest,2000-06-15 19:32:00,0,Thanks for the replies. Guess I will see how it goes.John
