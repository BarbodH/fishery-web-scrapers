508512,Guest,2000-06-15 10:42:00,0,Check Mahumbas site. He has it all layed out.You are best to phone ahead and reserve your bait so you have no problems. I understand leech trapping has been hard this year in some areas. My favourite spots are Silver Mountain and Wiggley baits. Thet are running at around $32 Canadian a pound give or take a little. Good fishing: Frank
