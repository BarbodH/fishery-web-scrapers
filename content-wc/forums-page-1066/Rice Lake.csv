HEARD 3 OR 4 DIFFERENT OPINIONS ABOUT WHERE THE EYES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE, ONLY SAW 1 BOAT WITH MORE THAN 2 EYES. HE CAUGHT THEM EAST OF THE RIVER IN FRONT OF ELMHIRSTS LODGE ALONG THE WEED LINE, NOT REAL BIG ONES JUST GOOD EATING SIZE. CRAPPIE AND GILLS WHERE DOING PRETTY GOOD. THE WEATHER CHANGES EVERY 2 DAYS FROM GOOD TO BAD. GOOD LUCK ON YOUR TRIP........"
