508504,Randy,2000-06-14 14:24:00,53,Just got back from fishing the Woman River chain of lakes (East of Ear Falls)for 5 days. The weather was cold (high 30s to mid 40s)and rainy every day except one. The walleye fishing was pretty good as we nver had any problem catching plenty for shore lunch. My 12 year old nephew caught a 24 inch 5 1/2 pound walleye but most were small 12-14 inch. I was disappointed in the Northern Pike fishing though. Maybe they didn't like the cold front. Crossed at International Falls on Wednesday and came back across on Tuesday with no problems and no waiting.
