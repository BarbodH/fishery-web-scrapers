508510,Guest,2000-06-15 12:08:00,0,I was there the 3rd week of May and water levels were pretty much normal. That area has had significant rain in the past week so the level may even be up a bit unless they are holding back more water at Kenora. Fishing was slower than past years but we did pick up several 26 inchers. Had to really go searching for them though. Good luck!
