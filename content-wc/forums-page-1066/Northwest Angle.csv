508528,DRP,2000-06-15 07:41:00,83,Just wondering if anybody can give any recent walleye reports on the NW Angle of Lake of the Woods. Heading up their next week and wondering what's been working. We're staying in Angle Inlet and likely fishing both Minnesota and Canadian waters. Any information would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
