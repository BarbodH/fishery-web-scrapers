508463,Dan,2000-06-13 20:05:00,325,I have a eagle fish locator and have just purchased a portable power pack that uses 2 6volt batteries.Could someone tell me how many batteries I might need for a 6 day fishing trip ?
508464,Pops,2000-06-14 02:20:00,61,"We used to do the 6 volt thing. We ran the old flasher unites and LCDs. Normaly we could get a full week out of good fresh batteries. Do bring spairs though, 1 extra set should be just fine.Keep your rod bent!!Pops"
508465,Pooch,2000-06-15 06:05:00,4619,"I have several portable units. Eagle LCR and Zercom flashers. The Eagle LCR will use up two sets of six volt batteries in a week of fishing. If you forgt or don't turn it off when not needed, you may need the third set by the end of the week. Also, it's VERY important to buy fresh batteries and high quality batteries. I have used Eveready ""Energizers"" and Duracell ""Coppertops"" while both are good the Duracell seems to last longer. You will really regret (by the end of the week) buying cheap or regular batteries. Just ask one of my old cheapskate, battery bumming buddys! It took us a couple of trips but he finally figured it out. Plus he always forgot to turn his LCR off during lunch or at night. He also fished with line the size of a tow rope. Actually we never lacked for entertainment with him on the trip! He's a hoot.The Zercom flashers can run for several weeks on one set of two six volt batterys. They are my favorite for fly-in trips. Good luck.Pooch"

If you forget or fail to turn it off during lunch or at night, then you should take the third set.Don't skimp on the quality of the batteries.Pooch"

The trick is to actually inplug the battery pack form the sonar unit everynight. This prevents draining the battery incase the unit is accidently turned on. Another consideration, is turning the unit off once you have learned the depth and structure of your fishing area, do this especially if you are jigging or casting. This way you improve battery life and spend more time fishing and enjoying the wilderness rather than staring at you sonar screen."

508471,Guest,2000-06-17 00:59:00,0,Here's an idea. Why don't you get a 12 volt motorcyle battery at about 12 to 14 amps. That should last you all week depending on your locator's milli-amp draw. If you got electricity or access to a small generator take a charger(1 or 2 amps). Those 6 volt alkaline dry cell batteries are real expensive. A motorcyle battery is 20 bucks. Works for me.
