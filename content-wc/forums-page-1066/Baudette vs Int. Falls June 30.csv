What I'm wondering would I be further ahead to cross at baudette? From what I can tell it's about 30 miles out of the way. Is there a line like Internatioal Falls, or any thing else I don't know?Fuzzy_ILP.S. I heard there was a big class reunion going on that weekend in International Falls."

I go to LOTW every August and launch out of Morson to go to Miles bay and the Obobikan Bay camp. I drive from Indiana and eventually go up Rt 53 to Int. Falls and then head down highway 11 parrallelling the rainy river to Baudet. This is closer to my destination in Canada and the crossing at Baudet is FREE with no toll. There has never been a line to cross and I have never had a problem in 8 years coming or going. Highway 11 is a bit decieveing and winds alot as it follows the river. It is a beautiful route and if you have the time, do it, you won't regret it. Have fun@!"
508542,Fuzzy_IL,2000-06-15 22:54:00,69,We are going to Gullrock Lake just out side Red Lake. My automap says it's only 30 miles out of the way to cross at baudette. Automap also says to exit I35 at exit 214 on hwy 73 to hwy 2to hwy 46to hwy 72then 72 goes into baudette.I agree that hwy 11 looks way to curvy for me!Fuzzy_IL

You'd be lucky to average 55mph due to traffic, the road, and small towns.One thing to note, Baudette is alot smaller than Int'l Falls so make sure you have everything because you are less likely to find it. The save thing applies once you cross the border."
