As far as cost for camping goes per person have you ever though how much it costs to keep a park like that open and maintained?There you were on the largest game preserve in north America where sighting the majestic moose is common, where bears can be seen roaming the wild, bald eagles soaring above, native pictographs dating back to the early 1700 can be viewed at Fairy Point, and Whitefish Falls not to mention just how good the fishing is, and you come back with these trivial complaints. My friend do us all a favor and stay home!!!!Don't bother with a come back Dan because as you know that park is occupied with 70% Americans who I know won't agree with you because like me they return year after year to this wonderful piece of nature and history."
