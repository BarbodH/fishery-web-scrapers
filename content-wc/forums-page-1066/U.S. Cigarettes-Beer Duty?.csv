508443,Guest,2000-06-14 19:30:00,0,Duty is cheaper than buying up in Can. PAY THE DUTY BY ALL MEANS.
508444,Jesse-WI,2000-06-14 19:48:00,534,That depends on how much you value your time. Let us not forget the extra time your will spend at the border doing the paperwork. If everyone did it just how much longer the lines would be to cross?
508433,acp,2000-06-13 10:21:00,156,"Can anyone tell me what the duty is per carton of US cigarettes and case of US beer.It's not that I'm trying to save money, I just prefer US beer and cigarettes.Thanks....Al"
508434,Guest,2000-06-13 14:54:00,0,Check out the Canadian Customs Web Site for answers to this and other frequently asked questions. As I recall you can take in one case of beer and one carton of cigarettes with no duty but check it on: #####://www.ccra-adrc.gc.ca/customs/general/faq/menu-e.html
508435,Guest,2000-06-13 15:22:00,0,"I just looked it up in their site, not so easy to find. The rule is one case of beer and up to 200 cigarettes per person duty free."
508436,acp,2000-06-13 16:09:00,156,I am aware of the one carton cigarettes/one case of beer or one bottle of booze duty free situation.I'm curious about additional quantities above the duty free limit. They don't list duty amounts on the Canadian Customs web site.Thanks....Al
508437,whitey,2000-06-14 07:16:00,36,"My advise....do what ever it takes to NOT spend any more time at the boarder crossing then necessary. Buy the extra frickin beer in canada and get one of your non-smokin buds to take the extra cigs you need. How long are you going for, that a carton won't last??"
508438,acp,2000-06-14 07:25:00,156,How does four weeks sound?Later....Al
508439,whitey,2000-06-14 11:11:00,36,"4 weeks? #####, sounds like you're going to need a tractor trailor to get enough beer and cigs for that lenght of time. You just might have to learn to like molsons and export a's. Good luck!!"
508440,Jesse-WI,2000-06-14 13:37:00,534,"First, thanks to Paul(above) for the Canadian Custom's web site. To find out alcohol related questions go to that site and search for D3-1-3. The appendix at the very bottom shows a chart of duties and such. For alcohol entering Ontario the fee runs from 67.6 cents(CDN)/liter for beer to 59.9% of value for hard liquor and 39+% for wine related things. I think that works out to about $4 US per case of beer. A $10 US bottle of rum would cost $6.76 US more.For tobacco you need to search for D2-3-6. The appendix at the bottom shows a duty of 1.7 cents CDN per cigarette.You might have to pay the 7% GST tax on the cigarettes since I did not read the whole thing, but I know the GST for Ontario is already included in the listed rates."
508441,acp,2000-06-14 15:34:00,156,Thanks for the info. I've visited that web site in the past and never uncovered the info you passed along.Thanks for taking time out to enlighten me.Later....Al
508442,chrism,2000-06-14 15:47:00,429,"AlI too prefer the Americ. beer - I live in Canada and it (some brands)is readily available at the liquor stores/beer stores. And yes, it is taxed like everything else, it runs about $15Cdn for a 12 of Old Mil/Olympia/Blue Ribbon. It may be cheaper to purchase it here than to bring your own (over the limit) and have to pay the border people, but check it out where you are going. Most Liquor stores/places in Southwest Ont and Manitoba do have it on their shelves. Can't help ya on the cigs..."
