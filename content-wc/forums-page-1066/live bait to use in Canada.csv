What would be the best type of live bait to use for walleye at that time of year? I haven't fished up there before so I'm not sure what to bring. (I know I can only bring crawlers across the border). Any other presentation or location information would be appreciated."
508530,Guest,2000-06-15 11:24:00,0,I've been up there twice.Best bait and presentation is a bottom bouncer - spinner - crawler harness for locating walleyes. Then you can try jig & crawler or crankbaits. Crawlers work as well as any other live bait option; and minnows are too expensive up there. Should also catch some jumbo perch with this setup.

Once you've located them it wouldn't be a bad idea to use jigs tipped with minnows. I usually go with a white twister tail and actually cut off the tail, then tip it with a minnow. Tips Up! Bof."
