I thank all of you for your kind words and who knows, maybe we'll see ya'll (just a harmless joke) on the water sometime. Tips Up! Bof.BTW, took 3 nice eyes last night in a small lake here on white twister tails tipped with a minnow. Slow verticle jigging seemed to produce the best."

I have been involved with our Fishing club here in the NW for a long time and have never seen a Biologist or area manager or district manager use a word in vain, even when some of the boys got overanxious and nasty.Your use of the word moron was fitting for the situation. I commend you on its use. Just out of curiousity, if you can tell us, What sector of the Province? Good fishing: Frank"
