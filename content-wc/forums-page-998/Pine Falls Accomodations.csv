514640,Guest,2001-08-25 09:58:00,0,The Papertown has recently expanded and new rooms are scheduled to open the 1st week in October..... This of course is provided that there are no problems with the last phase of construction. People calling for rooms will be put on the waiting list and will be contacted if construction falls behind. People who are already on waiting list will be slotted in those rooms. I know this is not an add site but thought this may be helpful for those who wish to come up.As for fishing I was up at travers bay last saturday and caught several small greenbacks on cranks and landed a 26 and 24 on jigs and shiners.. Hopefully this is and indication of an early fall run. Going out again after work and will post on how things go.
514641,Guest,2001-08-26 06:50:00,0,"Thanks for the update. I would certainly welcome your continued postings to this site. I try to spend as much time as possible fishing this area in fall, and speak to several guys in Winnipeg who share information readily.Good fishing !"
514642,john stephens,2001-08-26 07:40:00,3,is there any place there that we could find for hookups for motor homes we are planning on coming sept 18 thru the 20th. thanks john
514643,Guest,2001-08-27 07:39:00,0,"The Papertown welcomes all those who wish to hook up to power in the parking lot. Although there is only power a minimal hook up fee is required. As far as camp site there really is not much although there are many who wish to start a camp ground not many have been successful as of yet. As for the fishing on the past weekend went up to Travers Bay again on the weekend and only caught several small fish, guess its a little early yet. Can't wait till the hawgs are in......"
514644,john stephens,2001-08-28 17:31:00,3,we are coming up on september 14 thru 20 th how do we get to travers bay and what is the boat ramp like and how far is it to the river at pine falls from there thanks
514645,Hawgeye,2001-08-28 19:52:00,1355,"[font size=""1"" color=""#FF0000""]LAST EDITED ON Aug-28-01 AT 09:54PM (CST)[/font][p]Papertown and Pine falls are really two towns connected together. Drive NW through town along the river and the paper mill is where the best landing is. It is an excellent landing by the way. Just drive on the gravel road along the north side of the paper mill and it will take you right to the ramp. It is only about 3 miles from the dam. Traverse bay is just north up the river from the landing about 4-5 miles by boat. I am guessing on distance since I have never actually guaged it but you will know you are at Traverse bay when the waves are getting bigger. You will see what is called ""devils island"" to your right as you head out and when you get about 3 miles into the bay, there is a small rock island with a little bush in the middle that many call ""3 mile island"". Don't go too far past there because the nets are usually pretty thick past the ""X"" marker on the SE side of the bay. Please post how you do since I am going for my first weekend on September 30th through Oct 2nd..."
