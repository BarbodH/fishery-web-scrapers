Kinda funny to see twenty boats on some of the small reefs. Someone said there were 15 boats up by trappers cabin. Hard to believe. I think the winning weight was around 33 lbs for the two day tourny, but the leader was disqualified for having three fish over 18"". (rumor from Paradise Bar)Fish were up in big sand. No one, and I mean no one was fishing little sand at all. Kinda spooky. Towards the end of the week, saw a few boats on the usual spots, but that was it.We spent our days fishing reefs. (Green,No name in back of burnt,Rock Pile) We also did very well on the beach on the east side. Good mix of walleyes and smallies. The evenings we spent trolling. Towards the begining of the week we did very well, but the fish were moving and spent alot of time looking for them as the week went by. Not alot of fish under eighteen caught during the week, but no hogs either. Musky Bill did have Elvis on the last night we were trolling, but did a head shake at the boat and spit the lure. Fish was huge. Maybe the Minaki Monster, who knows.This is the weird part. Two weeks up there, one in June and one now, never had my rain suite out once, or a jacket for that matter. Weather was in the upper eighties, hardly any wind all week. Musky Bill only boated a few toothy critters and hardly saw any follows. Fishing all in all was pretty good.
