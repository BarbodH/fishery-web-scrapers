514550,Guest,2001-08-23 12:07:00,0,"Hi Sam, I'm veryinterested in the dry pine area if it's the same one by Meshaw Falls. We were there june 18th and did well but it's hard to learn the hot spots in a week. I'm assuming you know the area as you have purchased a cottage there, so if you would maybe you can point out some for me. Sam the e-mail list here is disabled so e-mail me please. I have a small map of the area so I can send it to you as an att., you can check it out and maybe scan it, make a copy,mark some spots and send it back if that's not to much trouble, thanks Bob."

514537,Tommy,2001-08-27 16:29:00,4,"Hi! I am going to Sandy Island Tall Pines camp on Sept 14th and wondered if you have any suggestions for Muskie, Northern, Smallmouth. I know the lake fairly well arooound the Sandy Island area but am willing to explore thanks!"
514534,Guest,2001-08-19 03:56:00,0,"Getting ready to head up to the french river area on my fathers and my anual trip. I was curious if any one had any info to share. Patterns hot lures or colors. We will be fishing for Pike, Muskie, Walleye and smallmouths, Not paticularly in this order. Thank you in advance."
514535,Guest,2001-08-19 20:47:00,0,"Can you specify where exactly you gone be? Every part of French River is different. Great river for fishing if you know where to go. In general I like top water lures (Chuck -Bug works the best in various colours)if it comes to bass and northern, yellow colour seems to work better then the others, my brother caught 42 incher northern last weekend on gold spinner bite. Buzz bites work great for bass also. If it comes to walleye... well, let me tell you my little secret. For me nothing worked better than 1/16 oz. yellow or fluorescent jig with yellowish/brownish Berkley Power Grub, just remember to add a little piece of worm on to it, find a spot and go nuts. One more thing - slot size - be careful - OPP (Police) and Park Rangers are extremely active this year. If you tell me more where you go I may be able to tell you some more info on the spots."
514538,bigfish1965,2001-08-19 22:52:00,3210,"I have noticed that I have the perfect pattern for catching a musky or huge northern in the French. Each year I go to the Flat Rapids area. Absolutely gorgeous, by the way. Anyway, heres the absolute guaranteed musky catcher. All you have to do is put on a minnow (rigged carolina style) and then wait for a walleye which is exactly 14 1/2"" to hit you bait. As soon as you lift that perfect slot sized walleye 2 ft. off the bottom BAMMMM!!!! A great big goddam musky will crush the fish, peel off about 50 ft of line and send you into cardiac arrest. Or if you are really into adrenaline, hold that walleye in the water just before you lift it in the boat and BAMMM!!! A great big SOB musky will grab it and off she goes. After you change your underwear, try it again. Works everytime. ;-)"
514539,Guest,2001-08-20 05:45:00,0,"Here's a second on the walleye trick. It happened to me near the mouth of the French about a month ago. Had to throw my underwear out because I couldn't get them cleaned up.Anyways, the fishing in that area has been outstanding. Walleye, Bass and pike fishing has been great. Let me know what area you will fish and I will try to give you as much info as possible. Email me if you wish. Good Luck!"
514536,Guest,2001-08-20 11:47:00,0,"Our lodge is located near Dokis marina/ Hardy creek area. But we cover the whole river all the way out to nippising. We seem to do better for musky and pike out by Blueberry island, little sandy and sandy island. Jerkbaits, ernies, big spinnerbaits and big soft plastic jerks. Last year thier was a guy in our lodge kicking serious but on pike with a fly rod. 54"" was his biggest, yes I saw the pictures. I will be taking a fly rod this year."
514540,Guest,2001-08-20 11:49:00,0,Big fish your tearing me up! we don't do much walleye fishing. I have sandusky bay and lake Erie in my back yard (literally). We migh try to catch a few and use the tactic you described. I'd better head to walmart for new grundies though!
514543,Guest,2001-08-20 12:45:00,0,"The walleye trick happened to me at Wanapetae bay Just around the corner from Hartley bay Marina. about 1/2 km west of Camp Kentuck or something like that on the NW shore there is a weed bed (grassy little bay), looking from Kentuck, right where shore weeds starts go out to +/- 25ft of water; 1/16oz jig, power grub and piece of worm. You will pull walleyes right up to noon. if you play with your walleye - pike or musky guaranteed. I just bought cottage on Dry Pine Bay so I do not fish that area any more so here you have it. If anybody wants some more spots - post a message."
514544,Guest,2001-08-20 12:56:00,0,I'll be fishing the same area in September. Walleye and muskies are our targets. Any other areas on the Upper French would be appreciated. Lots of hammer handles back in Five Mile Bay!
