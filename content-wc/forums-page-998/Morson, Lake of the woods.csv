I fish all over up there like in Miles Bay, Obabiko ect. I know the lake is still up but I don't know if it has any effect on the fishing. With the price of gas it would be nice if I don't have to travel all over the lake to find fish. Any suggestion would be appreciated"

Lots of northerns from 20"" to 38"" in the obabikon, just past the narrows. After the narrows, we went east towards target rock and look to your right and there are a lot of bays, full of weeds and cover. Best luck was with spinner baits in orange or white or green and the best overall big pike lure was the Mepp's Muskie Killer with bucktail. Walleyes were numerous in north Miles bay near thompson creek in 19 feet of water. Just out in front of the small bays and when the depth got to be about 19', we got bites. 1/4 ounce jig with a PIECE of crawler was very successful. Hope you enjoy and if you need further info, please mail request."
