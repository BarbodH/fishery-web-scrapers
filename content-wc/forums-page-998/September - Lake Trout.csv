514726,Guest,2001-08-29 18:41:00,0,We are flying in to Springpole lake (NWO) the last week of Sept. In the north bay there is deeper water (60-120') that hold lake trout. Has anybody fished lake trout this time of year? I have heard mixed opinions as far as what depth you'll find the trout. I am thinking a 1 ounce jig with plastic starting on the bottom working up! Any help???
