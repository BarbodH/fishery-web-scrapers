514636,Guest,2001-08-28 20:00:00,0,"Don't know how you only caught only 5 walleye in 4 days; lake has been HOT all year. Was out 2 hrs and caught 30+ walleye just two days ago. Mike at 4 seasons is a putz - as far as is known he has never even been on the lake- just likes to sell tackle to you yanks. Don't let yourself down, the lake is doing extreemly well, talk to an outfitter or a local guide for the real scoup."
514637,Guest,2001-08-29 13:47:00,0,"A word about 4 seasons. I don't know Mike, & I can't remember her name ,But there is a stricking looking lady that works there & she gave us very good advise. in late may on what to use, how & even where. I'll listen to her advice any time I'm up (&We've already booked next years trip!)"
514635,Guest,2001-08-29 14:32:00,0,Tell me about your trip. What areas did you fish? What sort of presentations did you use? I've never heard of Lac Suel W's with that kind of lockjaw. Maybe we can offer you some tips. TGG
514638,Guest,2001-08-29 18:10:00,0,"if its Pam you are thinking of Mike is her hubbyAs for a putz that someone else mentioned about Michael, talk to them and make your own mind up, Pam amd Mike are pretty good people.Most of the town depends on the tourist trade not just four seasons.
