We were considering purchasing at the duty free store this year, but I'm confused as to what might be the advantages or disadvantages. We transport a fair amount and our bill last year was quite high. How exactly does duty free work. P.S. anyone else going to or just getting back from Gull Rock? Would like to get a fishing report.Thanks, Howard"

Anything over that you must declare it and pay a duty (federal import tax). If my memory serves me correctly, the ""duty free"" part is similar to the shops at an international airport. The shops are are exempt from paying either US or CANADA import taxes(duties), because the merchandise left the country of origin but was never actually entered into a different country. The merchandise warehouse is physically located somewhere beween the customs check points of the 2 countries. I don't believe that if your are leaving the USA and going into Canada, there is any savings of buying a brand of beer made in the USA at the duty free because there was no import tax to be waived. Maybe someone else can clarify if you bypass the local (state) taxes too at the duty free store, but I don't think you do. I do not know what beer normally costs in Minnesota, but I know that domestic beer at the Duty free shop isn't any cheaper than I can usually get it in Iowa. IaCraig"

You will have to pay $7 duty per case over your one case per person limit. You will pay that $7 regardless of where you buy your beer. Also plan to fill up with gas at the duty free. always a deal compared to local prices.Roger"
514753,Guest,2001-09-01 20:43:00,0,"Howard, Duty free hard liquior is a bargain. Beer is questionable. Canada has good beer and with the exchange rate in our favor the Canadian beer isn't that costly. We buy all our hard booze at the duty free, there are several at the Falls. THey will tell you at the duty free how much you are allowed per person. Cigars are a duty free item but you can't get Cuban Cigars at the duty free. You can get cubans on the Canadian side and you will see signs for them. Good luck & Good fishing John J."
