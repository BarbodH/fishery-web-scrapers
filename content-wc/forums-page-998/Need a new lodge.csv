Bob is well informed about where fish are biting for the time of year you plan on going. He provides you with a lake make that is well marked for fishing hot spots. A guide is not necessary but you can get one if you choose. The variety for walleye, northern, bass, lake trout, and musky is endless.We are going back there next year."
514698,Tyee,2001-08-30 18:47:00,60,"Shaker,Since you're in Green Bay (I'm just slightly envious !), I'd recommend a great camp that is only an hour and one-half northeast of Sault Ste. Marie....Camp Kuha was just opened lastyear, and is housekeeping....all new log cabins with top qualityaccommodations, new bath (glassed in shower unit), new stoves,refrigerators, new gas grills on the large front decks, new docks, available electric for on-board chargers, ramp at the camp, and the owners are outstanding folks....Raimo Repo is aretired orthopaedic surgeon (US Board Certified) that has puthundreds of thousands of $$ into this camp.....which is literallycut out of the forest. I spent two weeks up at this camp this year (early June and thenjust 2 weeks ago) and had great fishing both times (lots of eyesfrom 1-3+ lbs, my son caught an 18 lb pike, and small mouth over5+ lbs....check out the website www.campkuha.com....the websitedoesn't do this camp justice ! I've fished all over eastern andnorthern Ontario and this is one of the nicest camps with greatfishing....and the cost is only $700 US per week for a cabin.If you want more info, email me and I'll be glad to share anyother information with you.Tyee"
514699,redbeard,2001-08-31 11:45:00,34,"www.lacseullodge.com Dan & his crew are top notch. Cabins are (or about to be ) all updated. He has some brand new Lunds w/ 40 hp 4 strokes (save you a bunch on fuel). With a bunch of newbies to walleye fishin' we caught 352 walleyes on our best day (end of May)Many in the slot & a few up to 28"" 8 to 9 lbs(next year a 10lb'er I hope) Dan directed us on where & how to find 'em. Also helped locate Lots of northern up to 38"" We drove up from south of Chicago & all total we spent $750 each, gas, food,licence,cabin,boat&bait(everything). That also included a guide for the first day. The guide helped, but check where he is gonna' take you BEFORE you go out. Ours took us so far out & around so many reefs that even with my GPS Dan (& a few of us) were leary of going that far out on our own. so the rest of the week we just followed Dan's advise & caught more than any of us had hoped for."

514691,Tyee,2001-08-27 18:51:00,60,"Shaker,Are you looking at western Ontario or more middle (north of Ste.Sault Marie) or eastern ?I've fished camps north of North Bay, as well as the Georgian Bay, and north of Ste. Sault Marie...plenty of camps andlodges to check out, but let us know where you'd like to go (westor East) and I can give you some more specific suggestions of severalnice camps.Tyee"

514687,IaCraig,2001-08-27 20:22:00,434,"Well Dave, I agree the price is good and Duane is a top notch angler. I also agree that Duane will give you some tips to help you catch fish, but he is not usually real talkative so listen closely. I think the accomodations at Paradise Cove 2 are nicer than Paradise Cove 1. But I'd be careful not to give the impression that Paradise Cove 1 is deluxe. It does have everything you need to cook, sleep and shower while your not fishing. I've never had a major complaint in the 5 or 6 years I've stayed there.In my opinion, if you want a good value in a drive up do-it-yourself resort with very good fishing potential, Paradise Cove and Minaki are very good. Don't expect the fish to jump in the boat though, it takes some time to figure out the reefs and techniques on any new lake. Give it a tryIaCraig"
