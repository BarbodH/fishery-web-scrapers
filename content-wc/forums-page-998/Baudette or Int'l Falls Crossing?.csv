Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Also, if Baudette is better, what is fastest way there coming from Duluth direction? Thanks in advance - Fields"
514707,Kaz,2001-08-28 18:31:00,643,"Feilds: I travel from Sturgeon Lake to Baudette quite often and the best from Duluth is up Hwy 2 to Deer River, Hwy 46 to Northome, Hwy 71 to Hwy 1 at Shooks, and Hwy 72 to Baudette. The bridge to Canada is at the Holiday Station, turn right. Cross over there and follow the signs to 621 and north. I have never seen a line up at the crossing there. Hope this helps. Good luck FISHING....Kaz"

I stoped and paid the $10 toll on the south end of the bridge, then at the north end I had 0 wait and the customs person was not only quick but she was cute too. I know it took 5 minutes or under including getting my beer at the duty-free pickup building. IaCraig"
