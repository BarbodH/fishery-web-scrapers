572048,Obabikon,2008-03-10 19:19:00,2370,"I agree there are other excellent lakes. However, to say LOTW is over hyped is crazy talk. I don't come on here and say Lac Suel isn't one of the best walleye lakes out there, because I know better. In my lodge is a picture of a 58.5 inch muskie caught 3 years ago. Rueben Gibbons was the guide. I can promise there are 60 inch fish in lake of the woods. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz66LNKrUPkhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OLq-Vt1CTw I don't know these guys, and don't agree with how they handle the fish. But, two seperate 50 inchers caught on consecutive days... one 55 and one 50.5 I'll close with saying this, people are going to like different lakes. The more time you spend on one lake, the more you'll fall in love with it. You learn habbits, structure, and technique for each area at each time. This will allow you to catch bigger and more fish than if you were to move around. However, if you fall in love with one lake, don't honestly believe it's the best at anything... there's always one ""better"". Every fisherman on this site will tell you his opinion... The only true answer is to go fall in love with one!"
572063,jigman 2003,2008-03-11 10:52:00,981,"I think some of us got off topic. While I am sure both LOTW and LS have excellent musky fishing, the original question was about pike. I too made a reference to musky on Green Bay. If I were going to go pike fishing in July or August, had only 3 days to do it and could afford it, I would go as far north as I could. Probably look at NWT or northern Manitoba. I can't afford a trip like that. Next places I'd look at would be fly outs out of NW ON. I prefer flying out of the Armstrong area. Pick a place that goes as far north as possible. Of course, finding a place that does 3 day flyins can be tough. Next options are drive ins to Canada, MN, WI, SD, ND, (NY?), etc. With such limited time, I'd be looking at the largest and coldest bodies of water possible. Those waters would have some soft finned forage fish. Also, given the time limitations I'd probably be looking at somewhere within an 8-10 hour drive. I have no idea of the travel times from Ohio, but I know that for me in southcentral WI that the Dakotas are around 10-12 hours, northern MN around 7-9 hours, LOTW around 10-13, Lac Seul around 12 and Green Bay around 2.5."
572070,pike50plus,2008-03-11 19:38:00,584,"Further north is difinitely the best bet! Had great august trips in nwt, just above alberta, athabasca and ganglers."
572071,iwdavefish,2008-03-11 19:48:00,5,"Driving from northern Ohio I would suggest Lake Nipissing. It's about nine hours (I live near Warren). Lots of pike along with muskies, walleye, and bass. Like was said, the big ones can be kind of scarce in mid-summer but I got a 42"" last July. If you are just looking for a chance at a lot of pike you really can't beat Nipissing coming from Ohio."
572072,Guest,2008-03-11 20:01:00,0,Thanks for all the suggestions guys. I will be checking into several different places.
572020,Guest,2008-03-10 10:19:00,0,"I am looking into finding a place in canada or upper US that offers excellent pike fishing with reasonable rates. I can catch all the eyes I want on Lake Erie, so we are mainly after the big pike. This is a family event with my dad and 3 brothers. Only looking to fish 3 days and will be driving from northern Ohio. Due to my fishing schedule on Erie, we are looking to make the trip in late July or early August. Thanks Ryan"
572021,Guest,2008-03-10 10:38:00,0,"Our area offers both numbers, and trophy pike fishing(48"", the biggest last year) with the chance of landing an ""accidental big muskie"" as well. Check out www.canadafish.com, if you like. Good Luck"
572024,jigman 2003,2008-03-10 11:09:00,981,"Wow, 3 days is all? Hardly worth driving real far for that amount of time. You'll have as much time on the road as you do fishing, won't you? Have you considered fishing Green Bay? Big pike, big muskies and plenty of other opportunities too. It certainly ain't Canada, but it would cut your drive time in half (or more). If you're set on Canada/northern MN, I'd recommend the Northwest Angle portion of Lake of the Woods."
572033,pike50plus,2008-03-10 16:00:00,584,Price range and number of guys? What area will you be driving from? based on those answers I probably have recommendations?
572034,pike50plus,2008-03-10 16:02:00,584,"Jigman, good suggestion!"
572036,Guest,2008-03-10 16:37:00,0,Isn't pike fishing tough in late july and august? We fished north of IF 150 miles and if was tough to catch many and few with any size. But then again we are not very expierenced pike fisherman. But shallow fish were all small and tried deep with no luck. Expanding on this subject what methods and type of water to you target? Just always looking for advice.
572038,Guest,2008-03-10 17:04:00,0,"Pike and muskie are definately different in July/August (at least in my opinion). Big muskie will be in the standard places when you think of muskie, weeds and rocks in 7 - 18 feet of water, as they tolerate the high water temps and actually prefer those temps. Big pike are a different beast, in that they prefer colder water temps. As such the big fellows tend to be found in much deeper water in July and August, even in northwest ontario (with some difference due to the type of lake you are on). As such, most monster pike will be found suspended in open water usually at 20' down in water that may be 40 - 100 feet deep. If the lake your on has ciscos/whitefish, the pike will follow them down deep as they also prefer colder temps. In the evenings, the ciscoes often travel up the water column and the big pike follow, but its only in the evening, by the time you hit the water in the AM, they are back deep. Of course there is always the rouge fish that does something different, but if your casting shallow water in July/August, you will catch pike, but they be smaller fish (less than 35""). The challenge with suspended open water pike is that they are definately a challenge to fish. You need great graphics and trolling gear to make it really work well. Graphics to find the schools of baitfish and trolling to cover the water. Then you need the tools to get the lures to the proper depth. I am sure that I will hear about how the above is not true and I am sure there are plenty of examples of lakes this does not apply to or the big fish caught last year or the year before, but in general, big pike go deep and big muskies stay in shallow.

572042,Obabikon,2008-03-10 17:44:00,2370,"If you're looking to land a huge one, you'll need to go further north. LOTW is a great (if not the best) Muskie lake around. It also will provide large pike. But, to promise a 45+ inch Pike, further north. That said... the NW angle might be best suited for you. If you decide to go to canada, I'd suggest the Morson area (light pressure on the fish, and still produces huge muskie and pikes) Last summer one 47.5"" pike was boated, but that's the biggest I've seen We had several (3-4) muskies over 50"", and a couple dozen in the 45-49"" range."
572043,pike50plus,2008-03-10 17:46:00,584,"Some of our beat trips have been august, bigger fish and may need to go alittle futher north. ganglers, Athabasca, nwt are excellent later season places"
572045,lacseulfishfry,2008-03-10 18:06:00,5,"Most guests and some pros have all told me time and time again that LOTW is over rated. I fished with Rick Franklin from the PWT FLW on lac Seul last summer and he experienced for himself the incredible numbers of trophy pike and muskie. I am not disputing the fact that LOTW is a large lake and a decent fishery, but I am convinced that Lac Seul and some other lakes close to Sioux Lookout host muskies over 60"". I have spent many days and years fishing the lakes and I have countless experiences with very large fish. I don't say this to promote or brag... this is feedback from those who have compared fishing experiences."
