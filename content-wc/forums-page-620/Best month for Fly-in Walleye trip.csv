Even then, we took a couple of rods and a basic tackle box and we got to do a little fishing. I've done a few trips mid Sept. so we could combine fishing with some grouse hunting. Another bonus of going mid Sept. Rich"
572337,EricS,2008-03-21 13:58:00,20,Last week in Sept. for me........no bugs....leaves at their peak color..walleye on the feed before winter..water temps in the low 50's couple of pics from 05http://i26.photobucket.com/albums/c1...ada2005122.jpghttp://i26.photobucket.com/albums/c1...ada2005118.jpghttp://i26.photobucket.com/albums/c1...nada200573.jpg
572339,Pooch,2008-03-21 15:17:00,4619,Nice pictures Eric. Thanks Pooch
572404,515,2008-03-24 15:02:00,254,"Thanks for the input guys. I talked the guys into moving our annual trip to June now just have to decide between the two weeks open, one the first week of June and the other week open the 3 week of June. Thanks again for you input Mike"
572302,515,2008-03-20 09:54:00,254,We have always made our annual trip north in July with mediocre results for fishing. July usually light on the bugs but hot weather. Just wondering what month people perfer for fishing walleyes and why? If it's May-June how are the bugs and the weather? Thanks Mike
572305,jigman 2003,2008-03-20 10:14:00,981,"Been there in June, July, and August. We've had good fishing all 3 months. July and August definitely have fewer bugs, but it can get hot. Mid-June is about right for me. Black flies are about gone, not too hot or cold, and fish are more concentrated than later on in summer."
572306,Guest,2008-03-20 10:37:00,0,"I personally like the summer months. I have found the walleye to be more schooled up on the main lake structure. May take a bit to find them but when you do, you can just hammer them one right after another. Summer time I have found the fish to run deeper than earilier in the year. I also have found to catch larger walleye easier in the summer than eariler in the year as they will be schooled up alot to size. Its Canada on a remote lake, there is no such thing as a bad month to go."
572307,Guest,2008-03-20 10:52:00,0,"Weather is always a factor, but early June is always the best, but it also depends how far north your fly in is... The further north you go the later in June you should go."
572309,Obabikon,2008-03-20 12:03:00,2370,"I like the last weekend in May... however, it depends how far north you go."
572311,515,2008-03-20 13:28:00,254,Sorry I should have mentioned were in the Nakina area. Thanks again for the opinions.
572312,Pooch,2008-03-20 13:32:00,4619,"Any time I can be in Canada fishing and it's not snowing or freezing my tush off is perfect. Because of work loads we go in July and August. Bugs are not a problem and the fishing is fairly consistent. Sometimes hit hot weather for a day here and there, but not as much as you would think. I'd rather have it too hot than fish shivering all day. You can always jump in to cool off. For the most part I wear a sweatshirt on more days than those days with just a T-shirt alone. Pooch"
572313,phishfearme,2008-03-20 14:32:00,1242,"i put in an early july vote. our group used to go in late may or early june but froze too many times. early july: minimal blackflies, mosquitos only at night, more stable and warmer weather permitting more exploration and portaging (sometimes IN the water), some outfitters permit 4 at their cabins in july where 6 is required earlier, people with arthritis like july better!!, going in july i don't miss some great spring fishing locally, the days are incredibly long - i guess that's enough - oh yeah, and the july ""catching"" MAY(?) not be as good as earlier but the overall ""fishing"" is far superior. and to anybody who says it gets too hot.....every camp has an instant body cooler - just go and jump into the lake to find it! phish"
572317,REG,2008-03-20 16:02:00,445,"First part of June - usually good weather, walleyes are shallow, hungry, and easy to find. Bugs are only a problem after dark. It's not on the poll, but we've had some great fishing mid Sept. too. Usually great cool fall weather, leaves turning, walleyes schooled up - and no or few bugs - even at night. Rich"
572319,515,2008-03-20 16:14:00,254,Reg I didn't bother putting Sept in as my mind switches over to moose hunting for the fall.
