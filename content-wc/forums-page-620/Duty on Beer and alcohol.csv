Smuggling is breaking the law. Canadians tax booze and cigarettes for a reason. People who smuggle things in their cars are the whole reason the border is aweful to cross. They can't trust the average Joe, because they're dishonest. Just pay the tax and have some morals. Also, it works both ways, as I've heard about Canadians smuggling marajuana into the US."
572123,dirt,2008-03-14 04:02:00,144,"We usually take what we are allowed over and then buy the rest up there. For me part of the trip is having a cold, clean Canadian lager at the end of the day. I gladly pay the extra cash for something I only get to enjoy once a year. :cheers:"

572125,jigman 2003,2008-03-14 07:44:00,981,"5 cases for a week I'm assuming? That's 17 beers a day, do you actually go fishing while you're there or just walk around in a haze? I mean, I like having a couple beers a day, but 17? Wow. When I go through 2 1/2 cases in a week I feel a little lecherous."
572127,lacseulwalleyeguide,2008-03-14 08:42:00,32,"For those of you concerned about the prices of Canadian beer, check out the beer store online, and look into their discount brands(around 75 choices). They all are in the 25 to 30 (for 24) price range. Carling, Lakeport and Pabst blue ribbon are decent beers, still with the ""Canadian kick"". This way you can save the bit you're looking for, and not have to worry about duty."
572128,Guest,2008-03-14 08:59:00,0,Beer and fishing are off-budget. I just pay whatever they cost.
572143,Guest,2008-03-14 15:21:00,0,"as far as the amount (5cases-per-week) if you are on the water 11 hours (9a-8p) and drink 1 beer per hour, 2 with lunch and 2 with dinner that's only 15 beers per day plus a few playin cards after dinner or whatever. in those terms, at least in my mind, doesn't seem like all that much. plus, you can always bring it home, but if you run out your up the creek. but then again maybe i have a problem!(lmao) plus i have an extra liver on ice should i need it! ha ha"
572157,woods,2008-03-15 12:31:00,646,"A couple of years ago, I was determined to find out what the duty costs were at the Pembina crossing. I called the border station, they shuffled me to a place in Winnepeg, they shuffled me somewhere else, and I finally gave up! In 23 years of crossing, we seem to pay a different rate every year!"
572102,Obabikon,2008-03-13 08:39:00,2370,"I think you're much better paying the duty. If you don't want to haul it all, stop and buy it in Northern Minnesota. Honestly, the duty free shop (for beer) isn't any cheaper than in the US."
572107,jigman 2003,2008-03-13 09:59:00,981,"No, the duty free shop is more expensive than most places in WI. But, can't you buy Canadian beer there? The Molson and Blue, etc. we get here is not the same as in Canada. Canadian beer actually has some alcohol in it. Am I wrong in saying that the Canadian beers at the duty free store are the same as you'd get at the beer store?"
572108,Obabikon,2008-03-13 10:14:00,2370,I'm not sure... i was really just speaking about $$$
572111,Matches,2008-03-13 11:52:00,236,"The beer you buy at the duty free store before going into Canada is the same beer you buy in Canada. It is not the stuff you buy in the US. Compare the price with the price you pay in Canada, and there is a big savings. Buying extra and paying the extra duty per case, you will still be ahead by about $12.00 per case than buying it at the LCBO."
572112,jigman 2003,2008-03-13 12:35:00,981,"That's what I thought. I agree that is the way to go. Unless of course, weight is a factor. Then, you may be better off to pay your outfitter's price for beer. Pay for beer or pay for the extra weight charges on beer. Probably ends up being about the same."
572113,Guest,2008-03-13 13:50:00,0,"just take your chances and smuggle it, haven't been caught yet, one year we bought it up there are paid $45 a case whereas back in the states we pay $15, that was the last time we bought it up there. with the price difference they almost encourage it"
572114,jigman 2003,2008-03-13 14:05:00,981,"Yeah, that's what they do, encourage it. Yeah, smuggle contraband into a foreign country, who cares? Their rules don't apply to me, stupid foreigners. $45 a case, that's $1.88 for a real beer. If you can go get a can of real beer (not American 3.4 abv) for $1.88 in your local watering hole consider yourself lucky. Heck, with the price difference from what a case of Miller Hi-Life costs in the liquor store to what they charge you at the tavern, they are almost encouraging you to bring your own beer into the tavern. Thanks for another post making Americans look good. Just make sure you wave back at us as we pass you at the border. Have fun putting your car back together after they do a routine random search and find the contraband. Can you say 4 hour delay?"
572115,Guest,2008-03-13 14:16:00,0,"I would never smuggle anything. But come on, our beer is good too."
572116,Guest,2008-03-13 14:42:00,0,"i think that came across the wrong way, what i meant that the huge difference in price makes guys seriously contemplate smuggling beer across instead of buying it up there. i usually take five cases for myself, and at $45 a case that's $225 whereas in the states i spend $75. my point wasn't to encourage someone to smuggle but that their prices were sooo high it makes it considered. didn't mean to ruffle feathers."
572119,Matches,2008-03-13 18:24:00,236,"All this talk about crossing the border, paying duty and the cost of beer in Canada is really giving me spring fever. The beer store has listed a Labatts 24 bottle case is $36.50. They have hundreds listed, and many other brands are priced higher than that. I assume a case at the LCBO would be more than $36.50. You can search your brand and get the price list at this link.http://www.thebeerstore.ca/Beers/Brandsearch.asp"
572079,Guest,2008-03-12 08:43:00,0,We always seem to cross the border from U.S. to Ontario when the government agency that sells alcoholic beverages is closed. Anybody know what the duty is for a case of beer or a liter of Spirits when crossing the border with more than your allowed limit?
572083,Matches,2008-03-12 09:15:00,236,"CampCook Last year, we paid $9.25 duty per case of beer going into Canada. Buying it at the duty free store, plus paying this duty, you will still save about $12.00 per case than buying it in Canada."
572085,Guest,2008-03-12 13:47:00,0,You will pay more duty on the hard stuff then beer. Usaully they count the hard stuff towards what is allowed ( one liter per adult) and charge the duty on the beer overage.
572086,Glenman12,2008-03-12 15:16:00,762,"""Usaully they count the hard stuff towards what is allowed"" We learned the hard way one year by taking for granted that they would count the hard stuff..we all had two cases of beer and a big bottle...they counted one case of beer and we each took a bath on the duty that year..now we tell them that we are declaring the big bottle"
572088,Matches,2008-03-12 16:39:00,236,"When you say big bottle, are you speaking of a quart, or gallon? Does anyone know how much duty is on one quart?"
572089,Guest,2008-03-12 16:47:00,0,A big bottle in an Imperial liter or 40 oz
572091,Glenman12,2008-03-12 16:51:00,762,This was a few years ago so Im not 100% on the numbers..but I recall the total duty for 4 cases of beer and 4 1.75 litre bottles of hard stuff was around $135..Im pretty sure that 1.75 litres is a little more than the 40oz you are allowed for hard liquor or wine..Im pretty sure the duty for a case of beer back then was only about $7.00..
572093,Guest,2008-03-12 17:39:00,0,I just came back from the states and we were 1 1.75 lires over. The duty and tax was $29. The purchase price in the states was $13
572095,Guest,2008-03-12 17:48:00,0,"Thanks for all the info. Last year I drew the short straw and had to drive the 40 miles back to town to get ""provisions"" while the others fished. I think we will just pay the duty this year."
572097,Guest,2008-03-12 18:15:00,0,Do not worry about because I buy it all up there. Do not mess around with duty or packing it and hauling for 1100 miles. The beer is better up thee anyways.
