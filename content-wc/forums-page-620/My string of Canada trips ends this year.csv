Probably not the best source for this forum but come on guys. This is an urban legend. I deal with rude people every day. The rude CO, the rude border guy, the clerk at the camp who charges you a few bucks too much. This is nothing in the whole scheme of things. I get the same here in Canada as I get in your country. You're right about our lax security. We have problems with handguns coming from your country where you can buy them at the corner store. We're dealing with it."
572318,Guest,2008-03-20 16:07:00,0,You got me going phishfearme. Lets go back to 9-11 you guys locked your airports down. Canada hosted thousands of your people who could not land. Many stayed in private residences because there was no place at the Inn. We did what good neighbours do. Our boys are serving with your boys in harms way and dying with your boys. Be factual in your rhetoric.

572256,Guest,2008-03-18 12:50:00,0,"No GST rebate is not true. Some cases yes, if your package qualifies you can get the rabate and even some outfitters will give you the rebate right off your statement."
572257,Guest,2008-03-18 13:45:00,0,"Maybe you guys could just do a less exspensive trip instead of not going all together. Such as if you can't afford the $2000 fly-in trip, do a $700 drive in. The fishing might not be as good but probably still just as much fun and a chance to check out some different water/poeple. I go from northern WI so my drive isn't as far, but 3 of us in the truck go camping for around $300/man for the week. This includes fishing license. food, drinks, gas, everything. It would cost us probaly around $200/man to camping in WI for a week. So for an extra $100 we get world class fishing. Just another option."
572259,guidedfishing,2008-03-18 14:48:00,531,"Not to get off topic but here I go anyway. I still make at least two to four trips annually to NW Ontario. Yes I am fortunate to be able to and I know it. Some trips are camping some at a camp each has benefits and draw backs. I even quite going up myself for a couple years back in the mid 80's because I had a not so good adventure at the border (CA side) but in hind sight I did not find out why until years later another story. I have been torn down a couple different times by CO on the road and in the field all were professional and I had nothing to hide. Only one recent experience were the CO really POed me but #### just because they are a CO does not mean they have the market on common sense...Any way in all cases I was doing nothing wrong or showing any signs of illegal activity just in the wrong place at the right time. The border is can be a pain but the fishing thankfully most of the time makes up for it... so. money wise I would guess $300.00 per person for three guys is pretty tight? See I make this same trip from Northwest wisconsin. And I will admit my conditions may very considerably but the last several trips it has cost $400.00 in gas round trip to get the truck up and back and $100.00 in boat gas. for a week, yes I use the boat alot. so. based on three folks estimated $135 for vehicle gas (very conservative) $35 for boat gas (conservative) $70 for camping permits $35 for fishing license =$275.00 Figure in groceries, snacks, refreshements if you are doing it for a week for $300.00 let us know what the secret sauce is. Is there anything special you guys are doing to save a nickel? thanks maybe there is something for us to learn from you good luck GF"
572260,Guest,2008-03-18 15:19:00,0,"If you go with 3 in the truck and in the boat you can divide the gas by 3 and that is the cost per man. 3 of us go @ $300 each for a total of $900. Here is a breakdown, for ease lets assume $3/gal of gas(approximately last years price). 1000 miles round trip- 15mi/gallon=66.7 gal gas. 66.7 gal x $3=$200 campimg permit=$10/day x 7 days=$70, fishing license=$21, $91 per man x 3 men=$271 potatoes, chips, bread, soda, ect. = $70 About 3 gallons of gas/day in boats, 3x7=21 gallons X $3/gal=$63 Total $600 or $200/man . That leaves $300 or $100/man for drinks. We all hunt deer and bring up venision steaks and several kinds of sausages that we get from the deer which I didn't add into the price."
572262,wiswalleye,2008-03-18 17:17:00,62,"I used to go to an outpost camp with my son in-law, his Dad and a group of others. We totaled 8 the first year I was included. It was great, I could have stayed there all summer. By the time we got back to the main lodge to leave I was already thinking about the next year's trip. Now that same trip will cost probably $500 more counting gas. I can't afford the price anymore, but I am still going, just a less expensive option. Expect it to cost $600-$650 for the week instead of the approximate $1250 the other trip would cost. I'm now going with my brother and his brother in-law. Last year we went with our sons but they can't go this year. We will still have a great time, may not catch as many fish, but you can't have everything. Point is, there are less expensive options, it doesn't have to be a luxury trip to make it a good one."
572290,waltstalker,2008-03-19 20:50:00,46,The reason for the price increase is the weak American dollar. When your dollar was strong it was 70 cents on the dollar good for you guys because it seemed cheap when your dollar is worth 1.30 now with all the talk of a U.S. stock market crash coming the dollar is worth less than a dollar hence the price increase . And all the border crap was started by your government not ours . It seems kind of silly all the security on the 49th parallel (all us sneaky canuks jumping the border to cut your grass and feed you big macs) when the southern border is so lacks . I guess there will be a few less boats to work around when the I am on the lake this summer.

Wise off to an official and he can rightfully kick your---. Its THEIR country. If you want to behave and grow up they treat you wonderfully well. I got ripped off a couple times up there. Also, I have been helped out beyond expectations many more times.You cannot take booze/beer in the boat are their rules. Don't like it--stay home.

572244,Guest,2008-03-17 20:10:00,0,I have the same problem as Rmack. No one wants to let loose with that kind of money now. They want to make 2 or 3 long weekend trips stripper fishing to Arkansas. And 2-3 more long weekend trips fishing for Smallmouth. They came up with prices to back this up so Canada is out for me unless I go alone.
572248,Ogoki,2008-03-18 06:33:00,291,I ran into an a guy who I use to do alot of business with and I asked him if he was still going to Canada . I turned him on to a couple lakes and he loved it. He said of his group of 6 he was the only one still working as the other 5 had all retired . He said none of them could afford to go any longer so he was done too. He said they had went since 1999. ............A cousin of mine takes 6 to 8 a year on his trips . There are between 12 and 14 guys but not everyone goes every year. He said they did not send the deposit in December like they do every year . They have been flying in to the same lake since 1986. He said the majority just could not afford it any longer. I am lucky I can work extra to pay for it as I am going twice this summer. Lord Willing. But not everyone can work extra as many long time fishermen are now retired and living on fixed incomes.

572149,Guest,2008-03-14 19:43:00,0,I would think the issues at the border would lighten up a bit due to the currency issues price of gas etc. Do they want trourism or not? if you look at the taxes they collect you would think they would promote rather then hassale folks. If you have an a$$hole as a camp operator there are plenty to pick from.
572152,Flip Silverlake,2008-03-14 21:28:00,645,Been fishing in Cancada since 1962. Never had a problem. Going back in June for the whole summer again. Passports really help.

572155,Guest,2008-03-15 09:19:00,0,don't blame you dave. they hold me up for 2 hours to toss my car and that will be my last trip. i often wonder what triggers a search. i've seen carloads of old folks with wives included pulled out of line to be searched. sure looked dangerous to me.
572161,Minnow Man,2008-03-15 21:03:00,85,"Hello Dave B. Have enjoyed reading your posts from the past. Am not really familiar with the drinking in the boat laws south of the border, but I am sure someone will explain it to me. You said ""Like no beer in the boat"" My question, ( not being smart) is it legal to drink alcohol & drive a boat on Lake Kabetogama? Can you be impaired & drive a boat on Lake Kabetogama? In my youth I was a bit of a smart #ss, so when we were stopped by the C/O or police I ran off with my mouth. This always caused a rude response from the officer. Have learned that a ""yes sir"" goes a long way. Never had a office get rude with our group if we addressed him with respect & compiled with his requests. Even let us go with beer in the boat. The c/o's on both sides of the border are the guardians of our resources, I see nothing wrong with letting them have a look. Feel the same as you, things are getting expensive, can only hope that after the U.S. election the high cost of things will settle down. Not every trip is perfect, but I'll bet there are more good trips than bad. Let us know how the fishing on Lake Kabetogama is this summer. ( Hi Roger)"
572166,Stu,2008-03-16 02:53:00,472,"Dave, I certainly empathize with you problem. We haven't given up on Canada yet, but we are frustrated. The recent DUI restrictions at the border have forced some of my fishing buddies to stay home. Now I'm not trying to start an argument about drinkning and driving, but no one has EVER driven drunk around me. And none of us would ever be stupid enough to pull a stupid stunt like that in Canada. We drive to our resort, park our truck and don't get back into it unitl we leave. As far as drinking in the boat, I like to have a beer when I am fishing. Although it's legal here at home, I can't do it up there, so the beer stays at the cabin. I think some people take issue with this because as soon as you say you like to have a beer, they immedialtey attack you and accuse you of being a drunk. Oh well... We have been taking a hard look at the NW Angle and may check it out next year. I would like to say that I have always been treated well by Canadians, have never encountered a dishonest resort owner and the Canadian customs agents have been fair and curteous. I agree w/ T Mac, US customs agent have always been the worst."
572169,Obabikon,2008-03-16 07:04:00,2370,"A few things trigger it... Cussing, obnoxious comments, lying, insufficient documentation, etc If you're bringing up your son, get a notorized letter from his mom saying you two are going on a fishing trip. It's easy and will save you some hassle at the border. Also, many times they'll have you pull over and just take a glance in the back. If they discover additional beer or something you didn't declare... they tear the entire thing apart. Using foul language sets them off too. Lastly, when your officer asks you ""where are you going"" or ""where have you been"" tell him/her the exact location. Don't answer ""Canada"". No jokes, no laughing, and always use yes sir/yes mam. I would say that 90% of searches are brought on by some of the above circumstances."
572172,Guest,2008-03-16 08:50:00,0,"We are not drunks on the water, but it is nice to have a few beers with your shore lunch. That is illegal in Canada and the guys just want to kick back after fishing half a day, have a few beers and then not have to worry that there are empty's in the boat. It is legal to have beer in the boat in Minnesota. I have written posts on how to properly approach the border. We give all ID's to the driver, and make sure the driver is the guy that owns the car. We roll down all windows so they can see in and have our resort confirmation with us to show them where we are going. We are up front (we bring our beer) and tell them that we have two cases per person, and there usually is a few bottle as well in the group. Have always paid our duty and been on our way. We were stopped for ""random"" inspections. Not for searching our car, but for them to run our ID's. It took over an hour two years ago. we anticipated it being an hour this past year, but when we got well over that we started to ask why. Not in a rude way, but want to know why we were sitting there for 90 minutes and still being told it would take a while. There were people just standing around and one pregnant girl was running the computer and our names. She told us finally that one person called in sick, and so she was behind as she was the only person qualified for the computer. Basically they were understaffed but kept doing their stops on the same frequency as if they had two at the computer. At one point, when things got crowded with people waiting, they stopped doing the stops until the backup cleared. It was a room full of pissed off people. To say our group was getting hungry and to ask how much longer is reasonable after 90 minutes of sitting. I would go back in a heartbeat, but some of the guys cannot be convinced. 14 hour drive is bad enough....16 (with a two hour wait) is tooo long."

572178,Guest,2008-03-16 14:05:00,0,"it is they that should be giving me the no sir, yes sir and thank you sir treatment. i pay their salaries with my taxes and license fees. well, i guess i don't pay tha canadians directly. if i drive 12 hours to drop a grand or more on their tourism industry, i want to be treated respectfully. randon checks are the politically correct way to screw with folks, but you are still screwed with. and if someone calls in sick, most employers find a way to fill the gap if they are in a for profit business. government employees take a different outlook i guess. i say again, one 2 hour dalay and i'm outta there."
572136,Guest,2008-03-14 12:22:00,0,"I have gone to Canada for eight years in a row. I had always planned on going at least once a year from here on out. Over the last few years, guys have become a little disenchanted with going over the border. We have had a dishonest resort owner who tried to charge us extra for gas even though the boat he said was over did not get used for the last three days of the trip due to a guy going home early. We had a few other issues that the guys were getting upset about, like no beer in the boat, much higher costs for cabins, much higher costs to get up there because of gas, rude officer on the water checking our deadwell. The last straw was the way we were treated at the border last year. They were understaffed and kept stopping people. We sat there for almost two hours waiting for them to process us. We complained we were hungry and they told us to order a pizza and to have it delivered. (thanks jerk) This is the second time in a row we have been stopped and sat. I still want to go, but most of my group would rather hit a resort in northern Minnesota then go over the border. Our $10,000.00 will now be spent on Kabetogama then Lac Seul. I will miss it. Every year, as we hit the border, one of my buddies always breaks out singing loudly the Canadian National Anthem. He actually only knows the first two words (OOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHH CANADA) which he repeats about 200 times, but it shows the excitement we have about getting up there. It is too bad that excitement has been taken away. I will still have fun on the trip...just with less fish in the boat. Maybe a next year, but some of my guys are swearing not to go again."
572137,jigman 2003,2008-03-14 12:38:00,981,"I'm kind of confused. Would you stop fishing at home if you encountered a rude CO here? Would you be upset with our border guards for stopping cars? How about if the one they stop prevents bad people or things from entering our country? No beer in the boat has always been the rule in ON, no changes there. Everything I buy costs more now than it did 8 years ago, sucks but that's how it goes. Bad resort owners? Make sure you factually state your case and let the rest of us know about it. Best way to have an impact. Sorry to hear you won't be enjoying Canada anymore. To me, the headaches (or possible headaches) are few and far between. The good far outweighs the bad IMHO."

572139,Guest,2008-03-14 13:23:00,0,"I've been going for about 15 years and luckily have not had a bad experience. We have had to pull over and let customs poke around a couple of times.

Not bad for 20+ years. All of the ""bad"" experiences have turned into us having fun, one way or another, plus it adds to our canada stories! I don't resent being stopped, it is there job and if I am not hiding anything, it should not be a big deal."

Our border crossings(I-Falls) take place on Friday Mornings and go very smoothly. Our costs have gone up slightly the last few years.... but what hasn't? I do believe that there are some greedy resort owners willing to screw with you to make a buck, but, thats why you have to shop around. Now, I'm not preaching that everyone go to Canada and have a good time.... rather, I'm just relaying my past positive experiences. Living in Colorado like I do, we have very good fishing here... however, its nice to see some NEW scenery once in awhile! Good luck in the future!"

Realistic expectations deliver above average results for the most part. This year's trip might be the best ever...or the worst. Most likely it'll be somwhere in between and I am certain it will not be the last one if I can help it."
