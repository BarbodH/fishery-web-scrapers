In fact, those weeks my Dad and I both wore our insulated flannels, rain jackets (for a wind breaker), and flannel lined jeans for the week. For 4 years straight during the last week of June through mid-July we had maybe 3 days out of 4 weeks where it hit 70. Then of course the last two years we went to about the same area we experienced a week where it didn't get below 80 for a high. It's a crap shoot."
571889,Fishoil,2008-03-07 09:31:00,1277,"We fish a little north of there at the end of May. When we have a new guy coming I tell him to pack everything from shorts to a snowmobile suit. I also tell him that he may need them both in the same week. Two years ago we went in early one day because it was too hot. The next morning we were bundled up in cold weather gear. The weather that time of the year can be anything from hot to cold and snowy, bring it all. Also I can't stress the importance of a GOOD rain suit enough."
572029,SSH,2008-03-10 14:19:00,526,"At that time of the year, we find that while fishing on the lake requires pants, shirts or maybe sweatshirts unless there is a lot of wind. Occassionly, we are able to wear shorts. When we motor across the lake, this is a different matter. Then, we typically put on raingear to eliminate getting wet in our tin boats. The water temp is typically mid sixtys at this time, so wind off the water tends to feel cool. When we go to shore for lunch, most of the time we can get down to t-shirts. I always bring a parka, but have rarely used it. I tend to use layers of clothing to be able to get the right combo for the situation. We bring along a heavy duty garbage bag or water-proof duffle bag to store clothing for layering to keep it dry."
571747,scott791,2008-02-28 12:16:00,7,Just wondering what the weather is like around june 15th. Would be bringing Wife and Kids are actually young adults. Wife likes to be able to beach and read book during the day. Would be staying at Nestor falls.
571749,jigman 2003,2008-02-28 12:36:00,981,"Beach? Maybe. Just as good a chance as needing a medium weight jacket too. Plenty of bug dope a necessity. Good stuff, not cheap stuff. Rain gear, again, good stuff, not cheap crap. That time of the year it could rain everyday for a week or not at all. Bring some shorts, but more pants and light long sleeve shirts than anything."
571752,Guest,2008-02-28 15:21:00,0,"average hi-lo for dryden, on for 6/15 is 67*-50*, so dress accordingly. rain moves thru quite often that time of year."
571753,Guest,2008-02-28 15:30:00,0,"That time of year, the weather could possibly be quite unstable. It could be 90 one day and snowing the next. You should be prepared for anything. Zip-off pants, a set of long underwear, light long-sleeved shirts, heavy long-sleeved shirts, and several layers of light to heavy jackets / coats. And like the others have said, a good rain suit. You might not need it all, but if you do and you don't have it, the merchants will be really glad to see you and your credit card."
571767,Guest,2008-02-29 08:31:00,0,"We go to N/F each year in June from the 1st to the 3rd weeks and have seen it 90deg at a high to a low of 32deg. So, like the others said you will need to take a variety of clothes but you can narrow it down at the last minute with a current weather forecast. good luck,Max"
571768,jigman 2003,2008-02-29 09:01:00,981,"I've tried that before too. I've found that getting a reliable weather forecast for NW ON is nearly impossible. The closest to accurate has been from CBC, but even theirs has been way off the last few years. I'd just say plan on taking a bunch of clothes. As long as it isn't a fly-in, weight shouldn't be that big of concern."

Some of these backwoods cabins now have air conditioning, wifi, satellite TV and tanning beds. I guess this is the yuppie version of roughing it.

We'll be there the first week of June at Red Deer--Guys are correct--Bring a good selection of clothing--Most important, dress in layers and take good quality rain gear with EVERY day--Even if there's not a cloud in the sky..I hope all the fowl weather talk doesn't deter your wife-If she enjoys being outdoors, she'll love it. Have a good trip--Eric"
571798,Guest,2008-03-01 12:14:00,0,"capn, yes that's *F. 153* F would be a bit warm."
571881,Guest,2008-03-06 20:26:00,0,"I've been going up to Canada that week every year for the past 15 and have never needed anything warmer than a sweatshirt, and have worn mostly shorts and T-shirts. I would bring everything just in case though and have some good rain gear."
