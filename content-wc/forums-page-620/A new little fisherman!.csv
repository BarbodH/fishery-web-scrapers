Anyhow, thanks for the well wishes. For those of you who have kids, you know how the first few days feel! It's been perfect! I haven't slept at all, because every time she makes a peep, I'm wide awake and making sure everything's ok. (I've been sleeping in the nursery so my wife can rest)"

572493,Guest,2008-03-28 09:39:00,0,"The funniest one I heard was on another website from a proud grandpa and he was telling everyone about his wonderful new granddaughter and someone replied back and asked him how long she was and how much she weighed. Grandpa said she was 19 3/4"" and he said the hospital said she weighed 6lb 11oz. Grandpa said they wouldn't let me hold her by the lip so I couldn't tell for sure but he thought that was pretty close. Enjoy every moment with them because they grow up waaay too fast. I am a grandpa and my only advice about making the grandparents leave ""might"" be that the sooner they leave, the sooner they get to return?"
