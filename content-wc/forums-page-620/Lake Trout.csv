572357,Mohleye,2008-03-22 08:48:00,368,"These are a lot of good tips. We've caught trout using many of these methods. What works one day never seems to work the next, so keep experimenting. Whatever baits you use, keep your hooks as sharp as possible. When you have a hit, set the hook hard, and maintain a tight line at all times once you hook up. Trout have very hard mouths. Many times the lure falls out of their mouth once you have them in the net. If you dip your rod tip or give them any slack while fighting them, there is a very good chance you will lose them."

572411,Guest,2008-03-24 18:26:00,0,So fish 10 to 40 feet from shore off any sandy beach area. What size of rapala. Do you use a 3way with a jig on one end and a rapala on the other?

Usually at this time of year the lakers are still running shallow as the water temp is cold enough. We troll husky jerks # 12 or #14 in a silver, blue or baby bass pattern.

Last spring we trolled at 3.5 to 4 miles per hour with husky jerks in around 20 foot of water and slammed 35 trout in my area, try it out and enjoy the feeding frenzy."

Set them down at about 30 feet and troll off points and islands. We prefer silver and blue or silver and gold, but based on the one comment I am going to try one with white on it. NE Piker"

572154,lobo1,2008-03-15 03:55:00,734,"like one of the posts said - we also found them in early June in shallow and still on top of humps in deeper water.....we were north of Red lake 100+ miles. we trolled heavier spoons like little cleos just off shore and also dragged a 3/8 oz jig head with white twister and caught many. we also tried hot n tots out in deeper water (humps) with flutter spoon dragging behind on a slider rig. got a double header which was fun. I found that these fish hit harder, fought more and tasted much better than the ones we catch here in Lakes Huron and Michigan. lobo1"

572158,Guest,2008-03-15 13:24:00,0,"For years I would go from Morson to Whitefish Bay to fish from Annie Island to the Three Sisters for trout - always liked to go in July, August and September. Would go 4 or 5 times a season until they screwed up the portage. Would fish with Chartruse and Pink and White 1.75 OZ bucktail jigs. Drop them to the bottom and reel quickly all the way to the top. Now I go maybe once a year. The biggest trout we caught was 38 pounds. We caught and released many trout. Some days we caught only one and the best day we caught 18 in one hour - that was in September 2001........."
572323,fishinnut,2008-03-20 18:05:00,642,Try jigging for them with white Bomber slab spoons. A big white tube jig will also take lakers. Works for me.
571851,Guest,2008-03-05 13:07:00,0,I will be going to Canada the week of June 7th. The lake I fish has lake trout and the only way I have tried to catch them is with a silver spoon or a spinner rig trolling. I was looking for some other ways to fish for the laker and looking for reccomendations on lures or rigs. Thanks Scott
571852,bassface44,2008-03-05 13:20:00,96,A common tactic on the Niagara River is to drift three way rigs with approx. an oz. of lead and 6ft leaders with either bait or kwikfish. Live Alewife or Cisco would probably work too. Keeping them alive is another story.
571854,Guest,2008-03-05 13:50:00,0,"June 7 the water should still be very cold. From shore casting out with a live minnow and letting it sit there can be very productive. Also I've known guys who also have fly fished for lakers on first ice out as well. If the water has warmed by then. Jigging with a white tube jig tipped with sucker belly or live minnow can also be a great producer, but used more so when the trout have started to go deep"
571858,guidedfishing,2008-03-05 17:36:00,531,"The size of the lake, and how far into Canada along with the weather leading up to that 1st week can all be a factor. Generally by that week you will already be finding lake trout in 35 - 60 feet of water and deeper. There are several effective methods that I have used that have proved to be very effective. 1st as a general rule your best bite is going to be from sun rise until maybe a couple of hours after. Having good sonar helps, you want to find a steep edge or break at this depth seems to help. because lake trout are usually at least a small distance from the bottom they are very easy to spot on your monitor. Some will laugh but if there is a light chop on the water a dead herring or cisco underneath a slip bobber (slip bobber needs to be a good size like a salmon float) Simple rig with treble hook and 3/4 ouce weight a couple feet above the bait. I have caught trout in depths in excess of 40 feet like this and it is a blast. Next if it is fairly calm vertical jig, you will need at least 3/4 to 1 ounce in 35-40 feet, 1 1/2 to 2ounce as you get deeper, best luck has been on a white curly tail grub 5 - 6 inches or a white fluke tail again around 6 inches. you can snap jig it and see it right on the sonar. Another very effective vertical jig is with a sonar 3/4 to one ounce, I have even used fuzzy duzits, (large musky type sonars) real up very fast for about 10 cranks then slow the speed but keep reeling. They will pound it at the transistion. Next if you don't have down riggers you can go with a three way rig, usually with at least a ounce weight, I have had good luck with size 12 or larger rapalas like this. When I go to the down riggers I almost always troll with spoons, silver blue doctor spoons, Red-eyes, and typical spoons you would troll with on the great lakes. If you have any questions let me know. When you hook into a 35 in plus laker vertical jigging directly below the boat in 50feet of water you will be hooked for life. good luck GF"
571862,lacseulwalleyeguide,2008-03-05 20:03:00,32,"They hit it on the nose!!! Lakers LOVE the color white. Try fishing 10 to forty feet off any beaches at this time( troll rapalas shallow, 1 ounce jig/minnow deep)."
571867,tyeeguy,2008-03-06 06:42:00,111,I usually fish 1st week of August using downriggers on Lake of the Woods. Is white still the best color to use? I have been fairly successful using blue but haven't tried white.
571869,Bill Krejca,2008-03-06 08:03:00,6107,"A catfish type rig with a treble hook and slip sinker works pretty well. Try to find an island or land area with deep water close to shore. Use several dead minnows or piece of legal fish, like sucker meat, etc as a still fishing bait. If you can determine/guess, the water you should be fishing should be around 51 degrees or cooler. I've had good luck just casting from shore and fishing dead-line, but have also fished dead-line from a boat near shore using an anchor front and rear. One other tip - I've found that positioning along an edge that potentially catches the wind from 2 directions, e.g., west and south, seems to attract lake trout. Good luck,"
571873,skindzier,2008-03-06 11:43:00,137,"Jig buzz bombs with a long slow jig, keeping the line tight on the way back down (since they seem to hit more as it flutters to the botton). Buzz bombs are possibly the dumbest looking lure I've ever seen, but they work.http://www.buzzbombzzinger.com/buzzbomb.html Large kastmasters jigged in the same way can work too."
571876,Guest,2008-03-06 12:54:00,0,What size do you use?
571887,skindzier,2008-03-07 08:05:00,137,"I usually use the 3"" ones. I don't know that I've noticed a distinction between light/extra heavey, so I'm wondering if that part is new - I haven't bought any the last couple years."
