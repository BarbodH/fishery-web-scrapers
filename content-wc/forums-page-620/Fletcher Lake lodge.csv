I was at the Fargo sports show and seen their booth and was interested on how good walleye fishing is and anything else you can tell me about them. (cabins, boats, service...........) I think I talked to Bruce seemed like a nice guy."

They have recently remodeled the lodge and several of the cabins to make the stay even better. You won't meet a nicer host couple than Bruce and Jeanne. All of the boats are in great working condition and they clean them every morning for you so that you start each day with a clean and fully fueled boat. I would deffinetely recomend Fletcher Lake to anyone who loves catching walleye's and just having a great time."
