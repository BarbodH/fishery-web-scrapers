They charged the customers a flat fee to fish with them, provided the boat, lodging, etc. When they were found out, the Ontario Ministry seized their boats, trailers, fishing equipment and booted them out of the country. They had been running this illegal guide service for some time before being caught. An expensive lesson. I have a problem with people who don't believe the rules apply to them. They make it hard for those who are law abiding."
572159,Guest,2008-03-15 14:58:00,0,"Shoot, it doesn't have to be a remote resort. There are camps just a few kms from Ear Falls that have been hiring americans for years. Doing all kinds of work from cleaning to guiding to working on cabins. Nobdody seems to care about that. Everything is under the table."
572246,Guest,2008-03-17 22:38:00,0,LMAO EXACTLEY Here's another question. So as an American citizen I can't work as a guide but I can own a lodge or lease whatever for a lodge as an american? See lots of lodge owners who are U.S. Citizens.
572250,Obabikon,2008-03-18 09:18:00,2370,"Fuzz... that was kind of the point... ""under the table"" is a nice way of saying ILLEGAL. It's just like illegal immigrants working in the US... it's under the table. Yes, if you buy a resort, you can work your resort. I think it has to do with you investing in Canada. If you're a US citizen, you come to Canada and make money... then you turn around and take the money out of Canada. Resort owners are in a different position. They have a lot of money invested in their camp, and if they don't follow the rules, the Canadian government will take it from them. They also SPEND a ton of money in Canada, and provide additional jobs to the area. So, giving up one or two worker's permits isn't as bad. If they allowed guides to come up, how many US guides do you think would come up every summer... i'm going to guess a BUNCH!"
572253,v-bay gord,2008-03-18 11:19:00,3168,"I see U.S. citizens guiding under the loop-hole of being ""guest instructors"". Now that is a real scam!"
572037,joeman79,2008-03-10 17:00:00,417,"Without doing any personal research I have a question for WC Canada board. I have a good friend who has guided walleye fisherman in states for 30 years and is wanting a change of venue. He is an excellent walleye fisherman as well as a good Muskie fisherman. To say the least he has the ""IT"" when it comes to fishing. I told him he should go to Canada and find a job at the countless Resorts and Lodges that Ontario has to offer. Has fished Angle area of LOTW and Canyon Lake quite a bit. Not trying to make this a resume' and got off subject. Can an non-Canadian citzen guide in Canada? Thanks, Joe"
572039,Obabikon,2008-03-10 17:33:00,2370,"It is very difficult. He would have to get a worker's permit, or aquire landed immegrancy. Both can be difficult/nearly impossible to do. Two options would be to buy a resort or move to Canada! lol"
572046,Guest,2008-03-10 18:13:00,0,I'm sure he could find casual work as a subcontractor. He is not employed by you full time but on a casual for cash basis.
572047,Obabikon,2008-03-10 19:00:00,2370,">I'm sure he could find casual work as a subcontractor. He is >not employed by you full time but on a casual for cash basis. > Maybe, but would that be legal? I think the Canadian government forces places to hire Canadians, unless you are unable to find willing employees. It's very difficult, and I'd say your ""friend"" is better off trying to get a job at the NW angle or just in Northern Minnesota in general."
572050,Slimeball,2008-03-10 20:18:00,56,"It is not legal for a U.S. citizen to guide in Canada for money, one way he could is if he was at least 50% owner of a lodge."
572051,Guest,2008-03-10 20:36:00,0,Depends where he is going. A lot of resorts are hard pressed to find good experienced guides. A lot of the summer help in the smaller places work for cash.
572052,Obabikon,2008-03-10 21:27:00,2370,">Depends where he is going. A lot of resorts are hard pressed >to find good experienced guides. A lot of the summer help in >the smaller places work for cash. Just because they do it, doesn't mean it's legal. Extremly remote places, the Canadian government CAN make exeptions to the rules. However, in my case, on lake of the woods, it would be impossible for me to hire any US citizens as guides. Honestly, I think it's the right thing to do. The locals should have first crack at the job industry."
572054,Guest,2008-03-10 22:50:00,0,"Thank you for info, My friend would never do anything illegal and i no way can afford to own a lodge. But glad I know now I can tell him he will just have to enjoy Canada as a fisherman and not a guie. Thanks All"
572055,Guest,2008-03-11 05:47:00,0,You're right about the remote part. At one of the Northern lodges I frequent we have an American chap who is retired. He gets room and board and a boat and he helps out. He hangs out for the season and comes back in the spring. It's a working partnership with no money changing hands. Everyone is happy. Is it strictly legal? Probably not.....However he is one of the greatest guys and you could only aspire for his level of happiness and customer service.

I think I could live on beans and weenies for the other 9 month just to have a 3 month vacation like that, lol.......sure sounds like a great way to spend the Summer. Kilroy"
