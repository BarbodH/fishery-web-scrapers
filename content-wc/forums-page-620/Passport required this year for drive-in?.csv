The ports north of Roseau and Warroad require a passport or picture ID and certified copy of birth certificate to get back into the states for everyone in the vehicle. The passport is much quicker as they only have to scan that. With the ID and BC, they have to type everything in and it takes more time if you have 3 or 4 in the vehicle. I would imagine this is the requirement at all ports of entry into the U.S."

572129,Flip Silverlake,2008-03-14 09:12:00,645,"With whats going on in this country now, you might need one to travel between the states!"
572130,Obabikon,2008-03-14 09:18:00,2370,Someone told me that they're wanting everyone who gets on a plane to have one. Eventually that may be required. Even if youre flying from Chicago to Minneapolis.
572131,phishfearme,2008-03-14 09:23:00,1242,jimmy - you may need one to get back into the US - not to get into canada. phish
572162,bpetersen,2008-03-15 22:28:00,251,"Homeland security website says a passport or card is not needed until June of 2009 but I stopped in my local post office today and they said that as of January of 2008 a passport or card must be used to get back into the U.S. How about that for some more confusion. The right hand doesn't seem to know what the left hand is doing. Play it safe, get a passport or a card. Pete"
572168,Obabikon,2008-03-16 06:56:00,2370,"lol... well, you should let your local post office know they aren't up to date, as the rule has been pushed back again."
572170,Guest,2008-03-16 07:35:00,0,But you do have to have one to fly into Canada and back.
572199,Jimmy Jig,2008-03-17 10:21:00,1905,YES

572235,Guest,2008-03-17 17:01:00,0,"Yeah, it's too bad that some of the people in the post offices don't have a clue. Talked to various people at the sport shows who were handling the passport applications and heard all kinds of things regarding the different post offices. Some offices only taking appointments for the passports/cards or for only a couple of hours during the week. Others have employees who haven't even heard about a passport card. I'm glad they pushed back the requirement for another year. Hopefully by then, everyone will be on the same page. Wingmann17"
572429,Guest,2008-03-25 17:04:00,0,get the passport. it's easy. you download the form you need to give to the post office. a lot of offices have cameras. costs you about $90. i went in just before lunch (recommneded). was out in 20 minutes. got my passport in three weeks@ it's not 4 months like some of the hysteria i've read. you'll definitely need it next year ss
571955,Obabikon,2008-03-09 18:05:00,2370,"It won't be done away with... in the next few years, everyone will need one. If the Dem's did that they'd be accused of being weak on HLS (but that's a political topic). Point is, it's going to eventually happen, like it or not. So, just bite the bullet and get it. Infact, the Canadians might start requiring one. I was told it's easier to search for DUI's with the passport than it is a license."

571956,Guest,2008-03-09 20:12:00,0,Why get a passport? Because if you EVER want to go to anywhere else you NEED ONE. I can't for the life of me understand all the posturing. It cost you about $100 it's good for 10 years and you have it. I bet you guys don't debate this much over spending $100 for beer for a week (OK Bad comparision) but you get my point.

572014,Glenman12,2008-03-10 07:07:00,762,I got mine at the All Canada show in Chicago this year to have it for June of 2009..if people want to blow this off thinking it wont be needed for some time thats fine..but what will happen is that they will become mandatory and people will wait..the Govt will have so many apps to process that some wont get theirs in time and trips will be ruined..
572016,Jimmy Jig,2008-03-10 09:03:00,1905,"I am NOT going any place else. Canada to fish is it and am not paying $100. for wife and I to get a kick out of flashing a passport around like Jame Bond! The card is half the money and if I need one next year I will get one, other wise I'll spend the $200 on gasoline. If people want to run around to third world countries on vactions, power to em. This ""you got the have a passport"" has been on here for several years and right now its not been enacted yet!"
572019,jigman 2003,2008-03-10 10:12:00,981,"Never going to Mexico, Jamaica, Europe or anywhere else? Fine, don't get a passport. Get the card, save some money. Just hope for the card getters that the rules don't change and they end up having to get a passport after all. That way you spend money for the card and the passport. $10 a year doesn't seem to be a big deal to me. Less than 3 gallons of gas."
572026,Jimmy Jig,2008-03-10 11:38:00,1905,"Maybe your younger than me, I don't have 10 years left for Canada!"
572027,jigman 2003,2008-03-10 12:22:00,981,"Heck, I figure even when I'm 60 or 65 I'll still have 10 years left. You're right though, if you aren't going anywhere else and you don't plan to go to Canada for anymore than another 4 or 5 years, don't buy a passport."
572041,Obabikon,2008-03-10 17:37:00,2370,"I had two guys (george and ole) that had been coming up for 40+ years. They came up last year George was 95, Ole 93!!! They drove themselves! How crazy is that? Anyhow, nobody knows how long they'll keep doing it. No need to have a negative attitude about doing something you love. I plan on doing it until i'm gone. Sadly, this winter, George passed away. I hope I can be doing this stuff at 95."

571940,Fred_G,2008-03-09 06:48:00,908,"This is from an outfitters website: PASSPORTS NOW NOT REQUIRED UNTIL 2009 Apparently the latest announcements from the US Department of Homeland Security have some people confused so we thought we should help clarify the matter. The passport requirement is indeed delayed to June 1, 2009. What has kicked in as of January 31, 2008 is the formal requirement to actually produce ID in the form of proof of identity (drivers license with photo etc.) and proof of citizenship (such as birth certificate) to cross into the United States. In the past a verbal declaration could be accepted, though these items of ID have generally been considered the requirement for some time. The change simply formalizes what was already accepted practice. U.S. Customs and Border Protection will begin the transition to the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative secure document (passport) requirement over the next 18 months, with implementation as early as June 1, 2009. Please be aware that these changes effect your ability to get back home and NOT to enter Canada."
