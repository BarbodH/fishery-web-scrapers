Given that assumption does anyone think it will be easier to get thru customs with a past DUI or will it be about the same as always. In other words will they let someone in that may have been turned around in past years?

572035,Guest,2008-03-10 16:29:00,0,I'll take that is same as always

If there are fewer cars crossing, the agents will have less pressure to keep the lines moving. There is no way I would attempt crossing with a DUI if I hadn't done the paperwork ahead of time. Long drive home for nothing."
