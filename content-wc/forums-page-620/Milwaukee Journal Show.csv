572150,Guest,2008-03-14 20:24:00,0,We'll be heading up there Saturday. Too bad they cut it down to 5 days.
572151,Obabikon,2008-03-14 20:27:00,2370,"Yeah, all the shows have been cut back. I think the big Indy show is the last of the 10 day shows. Problem was, there were no crowds monday-thursday... but, this show has had excellent attendance."

572167,Obabikon,2008-03-16 06:52:00,2370,"Man, sorry I missed you! I had to take my dog for a walk a couple of times yesterday. At this show, I was the only one in the booth, and 11 hours is difficult to not stretch the legs. Anyhow, I appologize for not being there. Would've been a pleasure to meet you."

572328,Obabikon,2008-03-20 20:12:00,2370,was the dog about a foot tall? And was the guy the only person in the place wearing a tie? If so... that was me! lol
