572087,DonC,2008-03-12 15:35:00,93,"Our group of 12 return to the Winnipeg River May 31-June 7. We are getting more excited for the trip now that spring is coming soon. I wonder if the snow pack will cause a higher water level this year? I fish current for smallmouth quite a bit and some years when the water is high, we have hammered the smallmouth. They are my favorite fish. Yesterday fishing the TN River here in TN my partner caught a 6 LB. smallmouth. That is his largest smallmouth and he will be coming on the Minaki trip also. Hopefully this cooling we have experienced this year will not negatively affect the fishing. Global temperatures have cooled some the past 3 years, and with the solar minimum we are in, and the strong La Nina, it might put the fish in a different pattern. Just another challenge to adjust to, but that is fishing. I hope everyone going has a great year at Minaki. I enjoy reading the informative posts of the experienced Minaki fisherman and will apply some of their insights. I have been going since 1998 and still do not recognize some of the haunts they refer to. I expect the crowds to be low again, but wish a good year to all you Minaki travelers, Don"
572090,Guest,2008-03-12 16:51:00,0,Minaki May 23rd thru June 1st. I hope it is half as good as it was last spring.
572100,Guest,2008-03-12 20:35:00,0,"We'll be there June 12 to June 29... If the fishing was only half as good as it was last year, I'll still be satisified. Chuck"
572104,Guest,2008-03-13 09:06:00,0,"Going May 31st -June 5th. Wish I could stay longer but thats it for this year. We're staying in minaki this year for the first time, usually been on rough rock but started fishing more and more towards little sand and sand lake so trying minaki for the first time. Spend most of our time casting for northerns, smallies and the occasional walleye. I would like to ask about a decent spot to jig for walleyed because this year we will need to eat some fish since we're staying at a housekeeping resort. Any help would be appreciated. Just received the hydro map of the lake system so maybe i could find the spots anyone could recommend and mind you, We promise to only spend the minimum time to catch dinner cause we HATE to jig!!! could be that im the worst boat operator and we spend alot of time getting my line out of the motor!! Anyway hope all your trips go great and hope the fishing was as good as last year!!! See ya on the Lake!!"
572105,DonC,2008-03-13 09:18:00,93,"Wolverine Fan, Some quick spots to catch lunch is Target Rock, and just down from that heading north is the lighthouse looking structure on the right where the channel comes up to around 18 feet in the middle. Under the railroad bridge is a community hole where you can catch walleye or sauger pretty easily. ChuckE and many others have a lot of spots and patterns they have shared in the past if you do a search on this site under Winnipeg River or Minaki. Many of the spots I do not recognize, though I have been all over the system for 10 years, sometimes 3 times a year. Good luck, Don PS: Are you from Michigan? I grew up in the Detroit area. Live in TN now."
572106,Guest,2008-03-13 09:29:00,0,"DonC Born and lived in Sault ste Marie until high school and then moved to Flint (Ugh). Went to central michigan for two years and played hockey at michigan for two years. Have been going to the canadien outback for about ten years but as i stated before, usually on roughrock and really enjoyed it but became too expensive and really we started fishing alot more towards sand lake area. My brother came with myself and dad lasy year for the first time and he's hooked now. He ought to be cause I run the boat, take off all the fish and am in charge of shore lunch, dinner etc. Ha but i enjoy the company and i pretty much do it at deer camp also so im used to it. we still hunt in the u.p. near brimley, have a place there, dont know why cause theres only two deer within 150 miles!!!! i guess the casinos suffice. Thanks for the info on the walleyes, i'll check the hydro map and see if I can find those spots. We're hoping to stay out on dead boys island but theres a chance it wont be done and we'll be jackfish bay???? Any info helps as we all hate spam!!!"
572110,Guest,2008-03-13 10:51:00,0,"I find it different almost every year lately for spring walleyes. But 1 assurance is that you'll find a good number of them going from the river heading to there summer haunts in big sand. There are far to many key spots to mention, as it can change from year to year. Generally I let the strenght of the currents tell me where to fish. Between the bridge and the lake most points, bottle necks, reefs are all are very capable of holding good walleye numbers. But because the eyes are on the move, and I don't care to fish in crowds I troll to start with a silver spinner with a live minnow and look for schools of fish. Then generally switch to a jig and minnow. As soon as that bite stops I start to move again. As well I've started to key some of my trolling over transition areas, and have done very well at times for nice eaters. But it doesn't sound like you want to spend to much time on walleyes So 2 spots that always hold fish and a safe place to start no matter on currents is around wild edge & the brush pile, and generally most places in that general area. I'm thinking that with the high flow from last fall and a good snow cover, it a good chance currents could be strong."
572142,Guest,2008-03-14 15:04:00,0,"Knowing Rob, he'll get it done and you'll be out on the island. He's quite the carpenter, and has built many a cabin in that area. Heck, one year when he was running Sunset, he let my wife and I stay in a cabin he was just finishing, and would work on it while we were on the water during the day. He also used to be a very worthy musky fisherman, before he got so wrapped up in construction. The boathouse over at Sunset is loaded with his and Ken's pictures! He'll be able to give you a few tips on known walleye spots as well. Chuck"
572191,Guest,2008-03-17 06:10:00,0,"wolv, It's getting pretty easy to catch a walleye anywhere on that system. Just toss out a bobber with a night crawler on it and your likely to catch some eater walleye. I'll be up at our camp from June 13-21 this year, can't wait."

572254,Guest,2008-03-18 12:02:00,0,"Wolverine Fan, If you're staying in Minaki, try the channel under the powerlines at the far end of Gun Lake for both walleyes and pike/muskies. There's also some structure just off that channel in the lake. Our group caught many big (30"" +) fish in that area. (I have a 34"" on the wall from theat spot.) Also have seen some big ones caught on Gun in the channel between the two islands (sorry don't know their names) where that octagonal cabin is anchored . There's some great rock structure on the main lake side of that channel that I watched a fishing member and his son boat 4 fish over 28"" in a 2 hr period with the wind blowing in to this point. Good Luck."

572118,Guest,2008-03-13 16:21:00,0,"Wolverine, I know exactly where Jackfish is, that's where we park each year, when going over to Sunset. I wondered if Rob was going to build another cabin out by the island, we've known him and Jan for over 20+ years. Jackfish Bay itself has given us several big northern and musky throughout the years... especially when they go deep in August. Going that early I'd be tempted to try the shoreline leading to the entrance to Milners Bay. You can rig or jig the shoreline area from the boathouse up to the shallower entrance going into the bay itself. If there is any current from higher water or wind, it will usually hold a nice school of eater walleye and sauger (sometimes fairly close to the floating boat house). The point to the north of it coming off of Seller Island (right across from the floating boathouse), is usually good for eaters. While there, try casting the bay shorelines for smallies, and if you don't get any from the point and off the docks on the east side of the bay, try the opposite shoreline. Nice northern also like to take up residency in that area early in the season. Some of the points on the west side of Octo Island will usually hold schools of walleye, if the current isn't too bad. Watch for the sonar to see if there are wallye holding on the deep break that comes up, between Octo and the island to it's west. Oh yah, while there check the eastern shoreline of Octo starting at the floating dock on the point and going north, to see if the smallies are active. Some of our best early season northern and musky have come off of that side of Octo, and you can work the eastern shoreline all the way across the north side of the island. We always seem to catch a big northern on the north-western point of Octo. There are two no-name smaller islands just to the south of Harbour Island -- one side has a bouy and the other has a day marker between them. Some of the reefs and points coming off these islands can hold scattered eaters (and bigger walleye as well), especially in late spring. While there see if the shoreline has any smallies on it, especially in the shallow saddle areas between the bigger and smaller island. It may be a little early for walleye to begin holding on Raspberry Island in the lower end of Little Sand, but might be worth a try. It's pretty snaggy in the area, but can hold some nice walleye at times. Head due east from Rasberry and work the easter shoreline south into the big bay for smallies. Smallies and nice northern will usually start to move onto the bigger rocks along this shoreline. If they are there you can keep on working the shoreline that makes up the huge bay in that area for smallies. You can even go back and work the that eastern shoreline up to Baker's Point for smallies. Due south of Dead Boys, is Sugarloaf. Jig the south-western point that comes off of Sugarloaf that goes over toward Harbor. You'll probably find some scattered eaters holding in that area, if it was later in the season, there would be more. They'll be easy to see on the sonar if there. However, cast the shorelines of Sugarloaf to see if my pet smallies have moved back in from the winter. The shallower coves on the north end can be especially nice for earliest season smallies, as long as there isn't much wind. If you don't find walleye at the point on Sugarloaf, go over to the shoreline on Harbour -- due west of it and search for them on that shoreline while heading south. They'll probably be holding near the sandy/weedy coves areas along that shoreline. Also make a few casts on that shoreline to see if the smallies have moved in. I've tried cover some of the walleye spots near decent smallie water. We like to fish for smallies as well, but welcome some nice northern and musky action that comes with it. We only fish for walleye when we get tired or hungry -- and often can't resist the temptation to cast an interesting looking shoreline when we do. Chuck"
572132,Guest,2008-03-14 10:04:00,0,"Thanks everyone for the helping hints, we really aprreciate it!! All this talk gets the blood flowing and my long distance bills are way up talking to the guys!! Makes it even more exciting going to a relatively new area to fish. Rob and Jan have the cabin 90% as they say so we wont know till closer if they were able to finish the second cabin but we're holding our fingers crossed. Thanks again and we'll be the ones with three in the boat and the driver untangling the line from the prop!!!!!!!!!!"
