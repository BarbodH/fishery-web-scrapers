We catch tons of eaters, but the biggest walleye in 2 years is 26"" last year 21 3/4"" won the big fish walleye pool. Where are the bigger fish in early May? We primarily jig fish in 8-25' of water on points and rocks,1/4-3/8 jigs with Gulp 3&4' Minnows. Just wanting to win the pool this year with a big one. Seems like the fish we are catching are smaller, need to get to bigger schools, try to target different areas maybe it's hard to try new areas or techniques when your catching so many fish. Any tips?"
572273,Guest,2008-03-19 09:45:00,0,"""catching"" a bunch of walleye eaters? May 15? Are you going this year as the season dates vary each year with how the weekends fall. Walleye season is closed then this year. Walleye opens this year May 17 in Ontario. If your fishing before season you should be ""fishing"" for northerns."
572274,Guest,2008-03-19 10:25:00,0,The actual fishing dates are the 17th-20th. My trip starts when I leave TN on the 15th.

572376,Guest,2008-03-23 10:25:00,0,We catch our big fish in the northern most bays on the lake. It is the warmest water on the lake after spawning which attracts baitfish. Always get some around 30 inches.
572394,2746,2008-03-24 12:03:00,3206,One of our trips each year is always opening week. Depending on how late the winter was and how early opening comes (this year it's early) fishing can be challenging. As others have said think shallow (4-8' at times) and look for the warmest water which will be on the north shore. Sandy or mud bottoms can be good and the normal rocky points that work well later are often a disappointment early. Shallow weedy areas serve as spawning grounds and the fish will be moving from there into the main lake so look for spots along that path. Jigging is good but so is slow trolling spinners or plain snells. A couple of years when the ice was late going out we found the fish had not yet spawned and were still holding in deeper water.....that threw us for a day or so until we figured it out. I love getting up there early but it can be one of the tougher weeks to fish in my experience.
572396,Mike Kansas,2008-03-24 12:55:00,1463,"Finding bigger Walleye early in the season can be tough. One technique that works for us is that once we locate a school of fish we look for the drops or slopes on the upwind side of the school. We have found that this area may hold some of the bigger fish. We also may add a twister tail to our minnow/jig presentation which makes the bait appear to be a larger prey. The bigger fish are sometimes more reactive to a larger meal. Another technique is to mark the outside drops with markers and drag some deep diving cranks along the edges and slopes. Use cranks that will dig into the bottom and make a racket (creates reactive strike). This technique has resulted in our group taking many nicer size fish in the spring. We have also used a drop shot presentation from a anchored boat casting over the edge and slope in the deeper water. We use a very slow retrieve keeping a taunt line so we can feel the smallest Walleye thump. This can allow you to keep the bait in the strike zone for a prolonged period and give the big girls a shot at a meal. Allow 2/3 feet between your sinker and hook because when you are retrieving up the slope your bait will be on the bottom where you want it and it makes it easier to feel the bite. Big secret to this technique is fish sssllllooooowwwww. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"

This year I won't be around Dryden because I will be taking off to fish in the PWT tourny in Mobridge, South Dakota. Up here the walleye will spawn when the water temp reaches 38-42 degrees. They will spawn in smaller creeks with current that is entering the lake you are fishing in. They also will find a gravel bottom and lay their eggs in the small rocks from 1""-6"" in size some where in the lake. Those are the two main spots to look for for early season walleyes. Until the water reaches the 50's in temp, the walleye should be still in the areas where they spawned. My number one spot to look for are where the creeks come into the lakes, generally in a bay, I will fish the bay along weedlines or structure in 5 - 10 feet of water. The walleyes that spawned are still there, you will catch alot of good eaters but it is most likely you will hook onto a 23""+ walleye. That time of the year a jig and a minnow is the best search bait. Walleye will be feeding all throughout the area. You find somewhere in that area you are catching walleye that are different sizes thats the spot you want to fish. Naturally the bait fish will stay in the shallower water because it is warmer. So you want to cast over the spot where you were catching the fish making sure you are keeping the retrieval of your bait parallel with the shore line. Look at the minnows and bait fish in the lake, normally they are swimming along a weed line or in the weeds, you don't see them swimming from shallow to deep. So you should cast your jigs or smaller cranks parallel with the weeds or shoreline to make the bait more natural. You should then start to produce more bigger walleyes. Its awsome you are coming up to fish the north western ontario waters, you never know what they will produce. If you are looking for bigger walleyes to win your pool, try fishing Lac Seul. Everytime I go out there I will usually catch a 28"" walleye, My biggest last year in Lac Seul was a 31"". Good luck on your trip."

Some tips after MANY times to N.Ont.; Big female W.eyes spawn in their moving water shallows and start to wander back to their summer haunts and they are tired out from the exertion and don,t not bite very well. The smaller males hang on later. I like July for best fishing all around as fish have settled up on their habits. I like to use a light sensitive line--6# and light rod.I like Fireline. Depend on your reels drag when fighting the fish. Check it often. The larger the fish usually the lighter the strike. A 1/8 oz jig--any color-I like chartruse, best,I guess, tipped with a frozen, salted or live minnow--doesn't seem to matter. And DRAG the bait ever so slow. I fish almost vertically. I have found you will miss 3 bites for every one you feel. Fish school by size. If you run into larger fish then you are in the right spot."
