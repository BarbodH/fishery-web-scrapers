572080,T Mac,2008-03-12 09:00:00,10084,"What a #### that diner guy was! That is bad business! I have seen that happen. Both ways, unfortunately. I had a friend from Saskatchewan visiting me, here in Montana and I took him to a bank where I (used to) do business, and they wouldn't exchange his funds. I was really embarrassed. I now know they have a hard time dealing with it, so their policy is to not exchange. Still bad business for a bank in a border state, IMHO. But...it goes the other way, too. For what it is worth, a few years ago we stopped in Regina to change our money to Candian currency on our way further north. It took 3 places before before we found one that would accept American money and give us Canadian. T%he first two treated us like we were trying to rob the place. The third place, (a credit union) was friendly. Normally I stop in the first small town over the border, and never had anything but friendly service. I avoid Regina, since that. Hard to figure...? It's just money."
572081,T Mac,2008-03-12 09:02:00,10084,For some knucklehead who lives in the states to act like that toward a Canadian makes a lot of us Yanks as mad as it does you.

571576,Guest,2008-02-22 09:11:00,0,About 5 years ago I bought a 6 pack and gave the girl at the beer store a U.S. $20. She gave me my beer and $24 back. I was trying to figure out how to imigrate right then.
571578,Obabikon,2008-02-22 09:24:00,2370,"Several places had stopped taking US funds last year. Also, if they were taking it, it wasn't at par. Only one store I can think of told me ""we overcharged all summer, so we're going to give a little back and keep it at par""."
571580,Guest,2008-02-22 10:27:00,0,"One year at a remote location we got a visit from the OCP early in the morning. Some Drunk Indians smashed windows at the parking lot of 15 cars, snapped antenas, and put gravel in some of the gas tanks. Does that make Canadians bad people? Indians leaving nets of rotten fish on the shores near Kenora, does that mean that Canadians too are raping the land??"

If there is an issue that I feel needs looking at that is mutual I have a beer or coffee with him and discuss it. I am always respectful and he likewise.
571603,fishinnut,2008-02-23 09:25:00,642,Canadian shop owners have always accepted US currency because it was worth more. Change was always given in Canadian. They made a profit on the exchange rate. If the US dollar falls further I'm sure shop owners in the US will repay the favor.

571623,Obabikon,2008-02-24 12:49:00,2370,That's pretty good deal if you got any exchange rate at all... most Canadian places don't/didn't give exchange
571624,Goldeneagle,2008-02-24 14:33:00,78,"A few years ago on my home from Red Lake I stopped by at Tom Brownlee's in Dryden to pick up two range turkeys. It was a few days before Thanksgiving and Tom was gone somewhere to pick up fresh meat to sell in his business. Tom's wife and daughter really struggled with the exchange and did their best to greatly undercharge me, but I finally convinced them to accept the full price. It went smooth and friendly, but took a while. Declared the turkeys at the border and the border guy asked why I was buying two turkeys in Canada. Told him they might be related to my family."
571499,rpieske,2008-02-18 15:06:00,1276,"Trautman: I Loved your story. I bet you had many wonderful and some not so wonderful experiences in the Merchant Marine. You ever get up my way (Nestor Falls)give me a shout and we can exchange experiences over a vodka or a beer. I like to believe that most people are not trying to be rude, just don't think sometimes. People always complain about how unfriendly New York and Paris are. I have had only the opposite experience in both cities. Great people, great fun and certainly helpful. This may be a walleye site, but you should read the main board if you believe that. Some days there is everything BUT walleyes discussed. I like to think it is a community of people who love to fish, but, as in real life, will talk about a wide variety of subjects."
571514,Guest,2008-02-19 08:20:00,0,I am Canadian living in NW Ontario. If all it takes is a small incident like the money thing to get you hot and bothered you might want to ask yourself why.... There are much more important and relevant issues than a clerk who does not like our money. You are also ill prepared to do business in a foreign country by not having any of their cash. We never go to Mn without at least a few hundred backup. You might have been better served to wait the 48hrs to post rather than burn whatever sticks were left for the bridge.
571515,AllenW,2008-02-19 08:34:00,11482,""""""""""""" You might have been better served to wait the 48hrs to post rather than burn whatever sticks were left for the bridge """""""" I'm betting that's happened to more than a few of us, I'd bet we've all have bad days, sounds like Freud had a doozy. Al"
571516,v-bay gord,2008-02-19 09:08:00,3168,"Yes, Freud had a bad day, of his own doing, and put it here for all of us to share. I'm impressed with the tolerance shown by most of the American posters to his ""whine"". As a Canadian, I don't share in the tolerance. You're in a different country trying to impose your Cdn currency on someone who doesn't want it...grow up and be better prepared next time."
571555,fourize,2008-02-21 07:00:00,287,">Did we rape your land a drain your oil like you raped our >Cabela's? > >That comment makes no sense what-so-ever. Your comment also makes no sense what-so-ever, but it does prove the point that there are inconsiderate people everywhere. I'm really surprised that you had such a problem, since it happened in a bordering state. I'm sure the guy see's Canadian currency pretty regularly. Just try to forget about the whole incident, and just don't stop there again."
571556,Obabikon,2008-02-21 07:46:00,2370,"I think it does make sense... The idea of rape, is the same idea as violation without consent. The Canadians are pumping their own oil and promoting their nature... then turning around and happily selling it to the United States. Just like the Cabellas was happy to sell that boat... because both are HAPPY TO SELL to the other country. Neither are against the transaction... so it is not a violation without consent. If the US is abusing Canada's resources, there's really only one group to blame. The Canadian Government."
571560,Pooch,2008-02-21 14:17:00,4619,"The manager of the local bank knows that our guys go to Canada every year and last summer he gave one of our group a big ziplock full of Canadian coins telling him to use them up on our trip. Over the past year the coin counting machines had sorted these Canadian coins out and he gave them to us. We forgot about them last year and I found the bag under my seat when we got home. I've not counted it, but there must be at least fifty dollars in that bag! Glad we didn't spend it last year, it's worth a lot more this year! Just a ""sort-of"" related thought to some of the posts. Pooch"
571562,Guest,2008-02-21 15:28:00,0,Jean Chretian was an AMAZING example of a PROUD CANADIAN!
571563,Guest,2008-02-21 15:36:00,0,"Freud definitely ran into a goof. HOWEVER....some things that have been posted here are just way out of line. That guy in Minnesota wouldn't have accepted Euros, Yen, Pesos, Yuan, or British pounds either. Canada being the neighbor to the north means nothing."
571574,MK,2008-02-22 08:50:00,322,"I suppose that instead of getting all fired up you could have paid with a debit or credit card, like I've had to do on many occasions in Canada where the merchant wouldn't accept US $. Its almost like you were looking for a chance to show off your new, now-more-valuable money. ""Mine's worth more than yours now,...na na na."" The trip north this year to rape and pillage the natural resources should be interesting. Many times the Canadian merchants have taken US $ but wouldn't include any exchange rate when the US $ was worth more. Wonder if these places will now do the same?"
571481,dirt,2008-02-18 00:14:00,144,"<<However, I didn't name call or throw dirt at anyone>> I would have been really offended if you would have thrown me at someone. BTW. I lived in the states for 30+ years, went to Canada most every year on a fishing trip or two and now live in Europe. There´s both nice and not so nice people all over the world. But to accuse someone for not accepting a foreign currency is a little over the top. Albeit, the man may have been offensive and could have handled the situation a little better. Who knows, maybe he was having a bad day. Maybe it was store policy not to accept Canadian funds. All I know is if I walked into a gas station in Canada and tried to pay in Norwegian kroner (at this point one of the strongest currencies in the world) I would probably have a problem. It´s just the way the world works sometimes."
571482,IaCraig,2008-02-18 00:28:00,434,"I understand the frustration, but I ditto the explanation about US banks not dealing in foreign currency, at least not without a major fee. Last I knew only 1 or 2 banks in all of DesMoines have foreign currency on hand. It doesn't excuse the store clerk for being rude, but unless you are close to the border not even McDonalds will take Canadian money. Think about it, in Canada most stores & banks are acustomed to US tourists & have the infrastructure in place to exchange US $. But unless you are close to the border, there is very low volume of Canada currency being spent in US stores and they often have policies not to accept it. Actually LasVegas is more likely to take it than anywhere in Iowa. Call it arrogance if you want, but I don't believe that is the case. Heck, if you go to some rural areas they'd prefer to take out-of-state checks over credit cards because of the expensive machines & the % credit card companies take. (I know, that is a different story but I'm mentioning it in case you come for an extended visit sometime with only Canada currency & credit cards). I hope your boat & motor treat you well & your next visit is more enjoyable. IaCraig"
571483,Obabikon,2008-02-18 05:59:00,2370,"A couple things... No matter where it is, a store clerk is not a store owner. He's probably worked long hours all week, and doesn't like his job. That doesn't excuse being rude, but it would explain it. Secondly, he didn't make the rule, his boss did. If Canadian's spent half the money US tourists spend, then yes, the US would be set up to accept both currencies. But, that's not the case. If anyone here has lived in central Florida, (I have) about mid September, all the Ontario folk show up. They clog all the good places to eat, the golf courses are always backed up... I was behind one guy, and he didn't put the flag back in hole #7!!!!! Can you believe the nerve of those Canadians??? They're down in Florida, wasting our tropical paradise, and ruining our vacation areas!!! Oh, but Floridians don't have to pay state taxes, because tourists provide all the needed tax for Florida. Must be nice! Point is, both use the other country to their advantage. No point in getting offended by one $7 an hour employee, that probably can't SPELL Ontario! 90% of this post was sarcastic, so please don't be offended."

571487,stripersam,2008-02-18 08:22:00,5,problem is the guy probably can't spend the cdn $ down here. that plus being a jerk imagine my chagrin when i found over a hundred $$ cdn from our last trip 2001. Looks like i'll have a little extra to spend on this summers cdn trip p
571489,AllenW,2008-02-18 09:03:00,11482,"Another way to look at this is, your going to a different country and you didn't check to see if your currency would work? Years back we found each time we went to Canada, we'd stop and get Canadians currency, we knew the resort took US funds, but after that is was maybe, maybe not. We found smaller business's off the tourist path usually preferred Canadian funds when asked, we were visiting their country so we used their currency. Maybe you should have done the same? A little forethought here might have saved a lot of trouble. Al...who lost the ""I bet this don't make 20 posts bet"" :)"

571495,Guest,2008-02-18 14:14:00,0,"About 30 years ago, I worked in the Canadian Merchant Marine as an oiler abord a bulk carrier.We had a trip into Brooklyn,New York and myself and another crewmember were sickened by too many mosquito bites.It was in July.Anyway,the 2 of us were taken by cab to a doctor ,who thought we were Norwegians.After the doctor visit we had an hour wait for a cab so we went into a hole in the wall bar for a couple beers.All we had was Canadian Lira.The bartender said that he couldnt accept it cause his bank wouldnt.He said he had never seen Canadian money before,much less a Neufie and a guy from Ontario.He treated us to 3 beers each on the house and we left him with a 50$ canadian bill pinned above his bar in case he ever saw any more errant canucks.He was great. So not everyone is bad."
571498,Guest,2008-02-18 14:58:00,0,"As an unregistered user, but fairly frequent reader I thought this discussion was going to explode! I think a few people have tried to point it in that direction, but common sense has prevailed. I agree with what IaCraig had to say! I think most Canadians would be shocked about the level of understanding your average U.S. citizens have of foreign currency I live in Minneapolis and until I physically went to Canada I had never seen Paper Canadian currency, sure every once and a while I'd see a Canadian Quarter and most places of business don't look close enough to even notice it's not U.S. But the vending machines know the difference. I was shopping the other day and as part of my change I got a gold $1.00 coin I had no idea what it was AND IT WAS A U.S. COIN. I guess my point is If I was a store owner and had part time employees I'd probably tell them not to take foreign currency either your average U.S. citizen has seen as many Canadian dollars as they have pesos, marks or pounds. I wouldn't want my livelihood affected by some $6.00 per hour employee who thought the currency looked real Just my $.02 AVS"

So did I when I read your post, but I'm not offended because I'm pretty sure that your behavior is only temporary and you're really a good guy who would be a good neighbor and fishing partner for me. You would have done well to wait an extra day or two before making your post. I should have done the same several times during my years. A decade ago my party of 12 was really insulted by a new restaurant owner in Red Lake. I avoided him during my second trip of the year, but the third trip (in October) I decided to give him another chance. He didn't last. New owner. Problems sometimes take care of themselves. Maybe the gas station jerk will bottom out and end up in a government job where such incompetence is acceptable."

571472,rpieske,2008-02-17 14:23:00,1276,"Hump had the right answer. Most US banks do not accept Canadian currency or have to send it to a correspondent bank to process. The fees for doing this are inordinately high. For the merchant it is a nightmare. The Canadian banks are more advanced in handling this than the US banks. Now, that does not excuse the jerk who treated you rudely or the response you gave about raping your resources. WE may have raped the aboriginal inhabitants of the USA of their resources, but we paid good money to Canada for theirs. Man, I was totally on your side until you chose to insult our whole country rather than address the rude behavior of ONE of its citizens. I love Canada and generally consider the Canadians to be one of the most fun loving and polite people I have encountered on my journey through life. I have chosen to live in Canada 4 months each year and leave between $30,000 and $40,000 of my US money in the hands of local merchants each year. I have certainly encountered rude people there, but that won't cause me to insult Canada in general. I hope you reconsider your response after you think about it. I hope that was not your intent...to paint the country with such a broad brush."
571473,dewyg,2008-02-17 14:59:00,1006,"Mr.Pieske Do you own propery in Nestor Falls? I believe you do; correct me if I'm wrong. But you are at least a part time Canadian resident. Which puts you in a unique position, you must see both sides of his issue. I agree that his statement was a bit over the top but, you have to admit that there are certain groups from the U.S that use the Canadian outdoors as there personal play ground. The senseless slaughtering of white tail, leaving the decapitated heads on the side of the road. I often see several infractions out there by our American ""guests"". If Canadians went to th States and did one small fraction of this I believe we would be banned from the country."
571474,prov1900,2008-02-17 16:04:00,544,"Check the archives of the MNR arrest reports (fish and wildlife vio's). Albeit some of them are American, most, and I mean 98%, are your own people. Somehow, I think we take all the heat for it and we are blamed for the ""senseless???"" slaughter."
571475,dewyg,2008-02-17 16:30:00,1006,"I have seen the violations with my own eyes, the authorities are to understaffed to catch them. I have called several times, and each time they were from a different country. The reasons that they catch the canadians is because they are there all year, not enmasse for a month. The hunting rules need to be changed in Ontario, for out non-resident hunters. The majority of the infractions I have witnessed have been with hunters."
571477,rpieske,2008-02-17 18:17:00,1276,"Deweyg: These are the same individuals who don't believe any rules apply to them. They commit the same sensless acts in the USA that they do in Canada. I have absolutely NO use for them. In fact, I would do everything in my power to see that they are brought to justice and banned from Canada for life. I go out of my way to help those coming up to Canada for the first time...even taking them out fishing at my expense. Part of that cost is listening to me talk about fishing conservation and proper CPR techniques. I am a part time resident and have fished LOTW since 1953. It is strange that even with all the friends I have who live full time in Nestor Falls, I have never heard of the type of behavior you describe. I am sure it happens...I just have never heard of it around there. Of course, maybe the Canadians are just too polite to mention it to an American. I don't hunt in Canada, just fish. Maybe that's why I have never heard. These boards are full of stories about illegal and unethical acts by self centered, inconsiderate ""sportsmen."" Each of us has the responsibility to do whatever we can to prevent and report such horrible acts."
571478,Freud,2008-02-17 18:52:00,15,"Bob, to clarify; I didn't insult anyone. I merely said out loud what came to mind when I was treated with disrespect. I chose not to insult but rather walk away. Now I know the whole country is not indicitative of one person but some may see that I've said that. It only goes to show how our sense and sensibilities can be mislead. I know that we've had different experiences and some of those have come to light, here. Good discussion. However, I didn't name call or throw dirt at anyone or paint any country with one brush stroke. We all have good/bad stories to tell and I think we can all stand a little hearty truth's. Don't you?

When you said ""you people"" one would infer you meant the whole country at large. As stated in another post our guests from the States do not rape our land but pay dearly for their experiences here and in doing so provide a decent living for a lot of us. The sale of our oil has been fueling the economic boom here in Alberta for decades. I have been to the U.K.,Mexico,Carribean,Europe,Australia and South America to name a few places and guess what-they won't accept our money either as it is too much trouble to have it exchanged. You probably thought Jean Chretian was a fine example of a Canadian! And another thing--If you are worried about ""those people"" raping our land why are you supporting ""them"" buy buying your boat down there?

On the way home, we decided to stop for gas and a quick coffee at a little gas bar (who shall remain nameless). We filled up, my wife was with me, and got our caffeine for the way home. We paid for the gas by credit card which was no problem but seeing as how the coffee was an afterthought, we paid by cash...Canadian currency. That was when the Beaver tail was worth more than the Eagle feather. Anyway, the store owner scoffed at the currency, saying that he would absolutely not take the money for the coffee. We were flabergasted! Why? Was our money suddenly not realized in the marketplace and someone forgot to tell us? No, it was that he wouldn't accept payment because the Canadian money was now worth more than his (when it was). Other customers stood by in disbelief and I thought, ""you won't take our money because it's worth more than yours and I've bruised your pride""? (I thought it's ok for you ""people"" to rape our land, drain our oil reserves and sell it back to us at double the price, and disregard our national pride, but you won't take our money? This could have easily come to a confrontation. I asked what we should do, we already poured the drinks? He sneered and said that one was on the house and had he known we would be paying with ""play money"" he wouldn't have let us pour the coffee. I fumed. Thought about it, and took the high road...I thanked him for his hospitality and walked out of the store with my wife, who was also in shock. I did think about turning around, catching his eye, and dumping both on the ground, but resisted the urge. We got in the car and drove off. Embarassed. Embarassed for us, for him, and for his other customers. Now, we've had other very good experiences in the states and won't quit going back, but maybe we'll avoid that gas bar in the future. My point here is that when we cross borders, we have to be cognisent of other people's point of view, culture, and beliefs. I feel that we were both in the wrong in that situation because he was going on what he believed was true and I reacted, out of prejudice, out of ignorance, and out of pride. So, for the upcoming season...come on up to Canada. Enjoy THE resources, enjoy THE experience, and most of all enjoy the people.

Did we rape your land a drain your oil like you raped our Cabela's? That comment makes no sense what-so-ever."
571445,Jimmy Jig,2008-02-16 20:44:00,1905,Sorry for your experence with the a$$ hole. It doesn't suprise me tho. I've never been turned down in Canada with US money and its a wonder to me why anyone in the US would refuse Canadian money. I would have told us the store that did it.

571448,prov1900,2008-02-16 22:07:00,544,"Well, since the thread is still here and I am really, really bored, I will chime back in after I read freud's post. I have to give him some credit because at least he is a registered user, so therefore this isn't a troll. He does state that he was wrong and acted as many of us do when confronted with the same situation. He has a really good point, notwithstanding the ""rape/resources"" comment. That one will get your goat everytime. I think it is pretty commonplace that Canadian currency isn't widely accepted south of the treeline. Many, many comments could be thrown back and forth between the two countries and I will refrain mine at this time, although it is really hard not to. I certainly enjoy going to Canada every year to fish."

The mentality of the majority of the U.S public feels that if it is not American dollars it is not worth anything. The small fraction of the public that utilizes this web site is more aware of the Canadian culture, due to travel here and such. When you make large bold statements you often lose your credibility, and your original ideas get lost in the fray. You went to the U.S to get a better deal, you got it. You ran into an individual with limited social skills, you dealt with it. Now sit in your new boat and relax. Lets be honest the man was working a night shift in a convenience store, you pull up with a new boat. He was envious and took it out on you."

I've run into two that I can remember places in Canada that were reluctant to take US funds, mainly because they weren't sure of the rate, have to admit they were friendly about it though. Joys of dealing with people, no matter where ya go. Al"
