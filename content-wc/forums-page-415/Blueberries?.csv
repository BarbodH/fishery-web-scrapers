1461893,Obabikon,2012-07-15 19:01:00,2370,"They'll probably be gone for the most part by then (unless you go way north). They were very good, but have already been out for 3 weeks. The hot weather has dried up a lot of them in our area. The rain today could help though."
1462372,TroyMansfield,2012-07-16 20:26:00,92,"there still good up here in Sioux Lookout, but might not be by then though"
1462431,Ogoki,2012-07-17 04:32:00,291,"It seems like , with my luck anyway, that the blueberries peak about the first day of bear season . Sounds like I may not have to deal with the bears eating berries this year and hopefully eating the bear bait . The year the berries were off was great bear hunting . I did not take a bear that year as all I saw were smaller ones (under 200 lbs) ."
1464564,north560,2012-07-21 20:23:00,53,"Here in Northern Ontario, no blueberries at all. The heat killed off all berries."
1464619,Obabikon,2012-07-22 06:01:00,2370,They're pretty much done here due to the heat.
1464653,wallydave,2012-07-22 08:18:00,2151,"Bill too bad the blue berry part of you trip might not work out. Plan b might be taking along some frozen ones. Fresh is always better, not sure if fresh ones could be brought in to Canada? This year we started the trip with frozen sweet taters fries, bacon, sausage and tenderloins. By the time we got to camp most things thawed the next day and were ready to cook. I'm taking my wife next year, I'm allready planing the menu blueberry pancakes will be part of the breakfast selection!"
1464822,btmbncr,2012-07-22 16:58:00,492,"Talked to Andrea yesterday.Still might be some blueberries.It's just another thing to do while in Canada.If no blueberries we'll just fish more or other activities,it is our Honeymoon,blush,blush."
