1465361,oldschooltiller,2012-07-23 19:42:00,515,"What makes freshwater fish less safe than other farm raised, or wild caught salt water fish typical of your local supermarket?"
1449822,BrianinVA,2012-06-15 16:44:00,160,"Scenary and comradery aside, a good ceviche is just as tasty as fried walleye with all the sides. Unfortuntately, in my few attempts I've found that walleye does not make a good ceviche. I can never get the walleye to turn opaque without an overwhelming lime or lemon flavor. Still, that won't stop me from experimenting with a recipe again this year. Cedar planks will also be on trial again this year. They work great with salmon but I struggle to get the flavor right with white, flaky fish. Anyone have a plank recipe?"
1449823,dosxx,2012-06-15 16:47:00,60,"I have made both walleye and pike ceviche, but just to be safe, when it is thoroughly marinated, I drain the lemon juice, bring it to a good boil and boil the marinated fish pieces for a bit until the possible parasites are killed. The only ill effect is that the fish pieces can get a bit crumbly after the boiling. I serve mine with crunchy tostada shells and fresh pico de gallo. It's not deep fried walleye, but it is a nice change of pace."
1450032,joeman79,2012-06-16 12:40:00,417,"They make pills that can get rid of any of those pesky worms and bugs. Ya bunch a chickens!! I think I will make some this summer and see how many of our group of 12 I can get to even try it. I love the stuff with fresh Tuna or Dorado. I am sure walleye would be excellent. I get a little tired of fried walleye after about 6 meals in a row of it. But Cevishe would be a great appetizer with a Frosty Kokanee or some 40 Creek on the Rocks, before a Nice Steak Supper."
1450053,v-bay gord,2012-06-16 14:10:00,3168,"Joeman....if you're looking for some walleye appetizers that won't give you tapeworms try rolliing chunks of walleye in a half piece of bacon....fasten with a toothpick, sprinkle some seasoning and do on the grill. Now that goes well with a cold beer"
1450094,octanehi5,2012-06-16 19:10:00,1104,"make sure your pieces are thin and the lime or lemon juice marinaids a long time, you do not want to eat those live little criters..Another one for you pouch in boilng water take cooked fish and cool it in the fridge, mix catchup, horseradish, lemon juice, dip walleye pieces in like shrimp cocktail its great"
1464792,fishincrazy,2012-07-22 15:25:00,1282,I'm gonna try this!!!!FC
1464892,octanehi5,2012-07-22 19:17:00,1104,"you still take the chance,of getting the little critters in your system. I would suggest you cook your fish and add your marinaid after."

1465243,outdoorsron,2012-07-23 15:07:00,843,Hello: I deep fry my ceviche using my favorite fish breading mix. Why would you want to do it any other way ? Good Luck O - R
1465340,btmbncr,2012-07-23 18:45:00,492,No ceviche for this old man.Some of my buddies did it and they all got fish tapeworms.Walleyes are to be battered and released in hot grease!!!!
1449375,Pikeslayer8,2012-06-14 15:06:00,1460,"Yea, my somewhat imparied nephew drank the juice of what was left in the bowl. Nice to hear."
1449459,MorganMan,2012-06-14 18:08:00,341,"Thanks, Pikeslayer! I have brought this up to the group with mixed, but mostly negative responses. I may have to try your recipe and see how it goes! Thanks dude!"
1449477,oldschooltiller,2012-06-14 18:49:00,515,Agreed on the paper thin preparation. All the pro's slice it thin when they are Chefin' it up.
1449623,SinOrSwim,2012-06-15 08:06:00,1528,"You can make it MorganMan but I'm not eating it. LOL Raw walleye does not sound like a good thing. Regardless of the citrus.On the other hand, maybe a tapeworm might help me drop a few lbs??????"
1449745,troutaholic,2012-06-15 12:36:00,827,"Freshwater fish are far more likely to have nasty parasites such as the lung fluke, that can only be killed by cooking. There is a slew of other nasty beasts that can be harmful if not killed. Here is a short list: ANCHORWORM Achtheres and Salmincola BLACK SPOT COLUMNARIS DISEASE DERMAL SARCOMA EYE FLUKE Glochidia BROADFISH TAPEWORM HETEROSPORIS Larval tapeworm MYOFIBROGRANULOMA RIBBON TAPEWORM"
1449760,unclepaully,2012-06-15 13:21:00,112,That list might have me overcooking my fish this year!
1449761,Pikeslayer8,2012-06-15 13:37:00,1460,"Lol, that's quite the homework you've done! Pretty sure I caught the Black Spot and the Eye Fluke. I still find myself still looking at spots on my maps and thinking about next year's trip for eyes. Is that a fluke? Oh well, maybe it was the leech sushi."
1449769,HeHooksHimself,2012-06-15 14:06:00,725,"I had another whole idea of what fishing fever is. I gotta think Pikelayers Walleye Ceviche has got to be worth the risk. Crap, you could choke on a y-bone eating cooked pike. You could slip on the mud and break your ribs. You could hook two fingers together by catching a 22"" pike on a crankbait. You could slip on the dock and mess up your knee. You could drink right from the stream and get Beaver Fever. You could have your wife complain for 51 weeks about your one week in Canada. You could have those shady Canucks rip you off for five percent of your money on the exchange rate. You could breath in excessive amounts of smoke from cheap cigars or forest fires. You could have high levels of stomach cramps and nausea from thinking you could drink cheap whiskey like you did 20 years ago. All of these things have happened to me but I'm still kicking and I sure would love to try the Walleye Ceviche of a master chef like the Pikeslayer. You doomsdayers need to lighten up and enjoy life a little. What's a little eye fluke among friends?"
1449772,HeHooksHimself,2012-06-15 14:08:00,725,Are you kidding me? I wouldn't even want to guess what that is or how to pronounce it!
1449775,tooski,2012-06-15 14:20:00,393,"Triple H, Well I have done 6 of your 9 bumbles and I can say without reservation I have no intention of repeating them. If I thought for one second that Walleye Ceviche was better than batter fried walleye I would give it a shot but there is no gaddam way it can beat a good fish fry so why bother. And yes, we bake and parboil walleye for a change of pace and I doubt the sushi beats that either."
1448759,Pikeslayer8,2012-06-13 09:52:00,1460,"I made a Walleye Ceviche this year that was really good. 1 16"" walleye cubed into 3/8""-1/2"" cubes added with one onion diced fine, 3 cloves garlic diced fine, juice of 3 limes and 1 lemon. Let marinate in the fridge for at least 3 hours and then combine 1/2 of a ripe avocado diced medium, (you should already have the avocado for the Walleye Tacos) and chunky salsa. I suppose you could throw in a little cilantro but I draw the line at bringing cilantro into fishcamp. Serve on Triscuit cracker."
1448793,Guk,2012-06-13 10:45:00,39,The fish isn't cooked?
1448797,bassface44,2012-06-13 10:53:00,96,"the fish gets ""cooked"" due to the acidity of the lime juice That sounds delicious by the way. Might have to recreate that in camp this year myself"
1448799,Pikeslayer8,2012-06-13 10:55:00,1460,"Technically speaking, cooking requires heat, so ceviche, a dish in which raw fish is marinated in citrus juice, isn't cooked. But it's not exactly raw, either. Both heat and citric acid are agents of a chemical process called denaturation. In this process, the heat or citric acid changes the proteins in the fish, unraveling the molecules and altering their chemical and physical properties. When fish is bathed in citrus juices, this process of denaturation turns the flesh firm and opaque, as if it had been cooked with heat."
1448833,TroyMansfield,2012-06-13 12:04:00,92,"just make sure you let the walleye soak long enough in the lime juice, my gf makes that often, quite good, but her cousin got a tapeworm from it once."
1448899,Guk,2012-06-13 14:40:00,39,I guess I leaned something new today!
1448913,v-bay gord,2012-06-13 15:07:00,3168,"Call me chicken, but I'll stick to my walleye cooked. Here's a link to some of the parasites you might be consuming.. http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/volunteer/janfeb06/raw.html"
1448922,phishfearme,2012-06-13 15:26:00,1242,and - i found out the hard way that you can ceviche minnows by placing them in an acid stream that looks perfectly clean!! phish
1448941,Mike Borger,2012-06-13 16:01:00,1554,I've made this many times before with trout and salmon only difference being I slice the fish paper thin.I suspect slicing it paper thin as opposed to cubing it would reduce the chances of a tapeworm being in the flesh dramatically.I'll be trying this with walleye later this summer.
1449370,Guest,2012-06-14 15:01:00,0,I made some and mixed it in with pico di gallo salsa. It turned out good and I will be doing it again. Drunk buddies loved it.
