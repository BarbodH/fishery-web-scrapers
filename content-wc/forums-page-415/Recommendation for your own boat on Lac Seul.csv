1459191,Hunts1,2012-07-08 14:59:00,123,"Yes Lac Seul is a great fishery. We used to count fish as well. It is not uncommon, in this body of water, to individually catch 250 in a day. A really slow day for us would be 25.My reference to a night bite was really directed at the low light time. 1/2 hour or so before sunset extending until dark. No doubt we catch great numbers after 6:30, but come 9:00 there is usually a pretty consistent slow down in action. There are spots though where you will catch them anytime. In regards to color, I would agree with jig color selection...probably doesn't matter. However, with crankbaits our group of eight will all swear that purple, no question, works much better than any other color. 3:1. I can't tell you how many times over the past 4 years I have been casting and out fishing my partner 4-5:1. Then I remind them to put on the purple bait and suddenly things even out. Try it.Regardless, you can't go wrong with Ken and Brenda and Lac Seul Outposts. For all the reasons everyone has listed."

""It is not uncommon, in this body of water, to individually catch 250 in a day"" ""I have had several tremendous ""night bites"" where two of us have caught 100 plus fish"" We don't tell these kind of stories anymore, no one ever believes us back home, LOL Greatest place on Earth!!"
1463870,Guest,2012-07-19 21:13:00,0,We went with Gawley's...I posted a trip report here:https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...67#post1463867
1464348,Bitinlight,2012-07-21 06:01:00,95,"I have also seen people come to this area who have had a tough time catching fish! It is not automatic. Ya gotta know a little bit about walleye fishing to get it done, and there are also slow times where not much happens--wind, temperature, and fronts can shut it down right now."
1464900,Bitinlight,2012-07-22 19:28:00,95,Just read an article in Field and Stream magazine about Anderson's fly-in outposts on Lac Seul and how good the fishing is. Might convince some more fellas to try it. They got a couple camps in the same area.
1464920,tly,2012-07-22 20:16:00,1900,"Andersons have 4 camps. We have been to Pickerel Narrows and Kekabeka. The operation is quite different than Chamberlain Narrows. Andersons have a diverse package from staying in real comfort at the base or going to an outpost. Chamberlain is basically one big outpost but it is GREAT! If you fish Kekabeka you share the same waters with Chamberlain. When we go with Anderson we stay in comfort & great dining then leave in the morning all rested. On the downside, whether we are houseboating, at Chamberlain or even at Anderson outposts we have had issues with the Anderson guides moving in on us and intimidating as much as they can. Other than the guides I do not think you can go wrong with either. It depends on what you want. Historically I have done business with the Robbins since about 1983 or so and have had a great deal of support and wonderful times. Still miss Scaler #7 campsite though."
1464938,Steve of Madison,2012-07-22 20:52:00,230,"I don't want to sound like a downer here but I have been fishing LS for years. It is a great fishery and 100 fish days can be had, but lets sit down and do the math shall we.8 hrs 250 fish for 1 guy, sorry folks but thats 1 fish per 1.92 minutes. 10 hrs 250 fish for 1 guy is a fish every 2.4 minutes.Now, I'm pretty good at unhooking rebaiting and getting back in the water, but that leaves very little time to fight the fish and get the bait back down. Tall tales are one thing but .........."
1465008,Bitinlight,2012-07-23 05:30:00,95,"This area is a good area just like Lac Seul as a whole. Some days you don't see a boat. Others days you see some. I fished a point in June and had great luck on it for 3 days. When I was there in July, there were two house boats parked right near it, and they fished it all the time. I couldn't get near it until the last day. Everytime I go to Lac Seul, I try to find a couple new spots to add to the list. Like one fella said, ""there are 1000 of spots."" The more spots you find, the more options you have, and good fishing just goes on. Have seen some Anderson boats or other guide boats but just avoid them. Go to Scaler, Wapesi, Birch Narrows, or Kakebeka Narrows and you might have competition there also on some days. There was a day in July where there were some guide boats on their relgular spots by 9:00 a.m. But by 11:00 they were all gone, and I didn't see another boat for the rest of the day. Fish must not have been biting in the area. LOL . Best way to get total privacy is to take a fly-in where you have the only cabin on the lake."
1465063,davenathe,2012-07-23 08:11:00,113,Mahkwa. Great area and good price. Since road was put into lodge about 3 years ago makes in even better.
1449235,Guest,2012-06-14 09:29:00,0,"I have been to Lac Seul outposts at Chamberlain Narrows twice. Loved it. I have a limited amount of vacation days to burn this summer so I would prefer to go to a place that I could make the four hour drive one evening and be fishing early the next morning...fish for 3 or 4 days and come home. I feel like you need at least 5 days of fishing to really enjoy the boat in experience of Lac Seul outposts without it feeling rushed. Therefore, I am looking for recommendations for good do it yourself lodges on Lac Seul. All I need is a clean cabin for my wife and I at a place that's flexible for people that don't need a boat and only want to stay 3 or 4 days."
1449256,teddi,2012-06-14 10:23:00,349,lac seul evergreen lodge. they can meet all your requirements.
1449301,wallydave,2012-06-14 12:13:00,2151,"Try Goose Bay near Ear Falls,the NW end of Lac Seul. Andrea offers a daily rate option."
1449404,Bitinlight,2012-06-14 15:52:00,95,"I think Chamberlain Narrows is pretty tough to beat. If you are familiar with the area and the routine, you can be fishing your spots on your boat-in day by 10:00 a.m. and catching fish. We consider the boat-in day almost a full fishing day if you fish until dark. Add three days to the boat-in day, and you have 4 full days of fishing. The more times you have been there, the less significant the boat-in/boat-out becomes. Although, it is still a pleasant ride through some beautiful country."
1449543,bigtimeelectric,2012-06-14 21:43:00,174,"Gawleys little beaver lodge. they have 3 big nice modern cabins at there main lodge 5 miles south of ear falls. 50 bucks a night per person and will let you come for as many days as you want. Great owners and you will not find a cleaner camp. Also free ice and a awesome fish cleaning house, I wouldn't go anywhere else after staying at several other camps before finding this place 7 years ago. Either way enjoy!!!!"
1449972,Steve Ediger,2012-06-16 09:21:00,97,"I am staying at Lac Seul Lodge right now - in the middle of a two week stay. I would recommend it highly. Been staying here for 13 years and have always brought my own boat. The Lodge has a good boat ramp and very good docking facilities with plenty of access to electrical hook-ups for battery charging. The Lodge is located in Rat Bay which is protected from the big waves that can occur on Lac Seul. Lac Seul Lodge has the closest access to McKinzie Bay of all the lodges on Lac Seul. If the wind is blowing there is also plenty of fishing without having to get on the big water. The Lodge has very clean cabins with all the comforts of home. In the future, if you decide you would like to stay in a boat in outpost, the lodge also has two of them, one on Sunlight Lake and one in Black Bay. I really bilieve you would enjoy a trip here."
1458570,Hunts1,2012-07-06 17:15:00,123,I have been to Lac Seul Outposts 6 times in the past 4 years and am going again later this year. It is in a great location with phenomenal fishing. I have been to Ontario fishing at least once a year for the past 22 years. This is the only place my group has returned to more than once.It is a bit of a ride in but it is part of it's appeal. Ken and Brenda run a great camp with great accommodations and a wonderful staff. Chris is a great fisherman and helps them run the camp. I have received great fishing intel from him as well. I have a 17' boat and make the trip in less than 2 hours. If you rent from them and they take you in their boat it takes less than an hour and a half. My only reservation about giving out my positive recommendations is that it makes for more competition when I want to schedule a trip with them. Fortunately I book next years trip as I leave this years.I have not been with any other outfitters on Lac Seul but can't speak highly enough about Lac Seul Outposts.My 2 cents.Mike
1458575,Hunts1,2012-07-06 17:23:00,123,"I forgot to add that I usually go for 3-6 days of fishing. One group I go with stays for 6 and the other 3. The boat-in day results on us being on the water by 10:00 AM. We go in June for the 6 day trip. Typically we get out by 8, come back for a fish dinner at 2. Back on the water at 4 and fish until 9 or so. We have discovered that contrary to typical walleye fishing that in this area of Lac Seul the fishing shuts down before dark. Best walleye fishing when the sun is high. Go figure.... Also, our experience has been that purple lures works way better than any other color. This is based on many fishermen under many conditions on multiple trips. We also jig quite a bit and find that minnows outperform rubber when slow but equal when the bite is on. Just like many other places. BTW, the boat trip in and pout goes fast and really doesn't impact on the fishing time on the water. Make sure you acquire a parking pss for the Deception Bay parking lot. You can get it at Kens bait shop in Sioux Lookout. We usually pull in the night before, get our parking passes and stay t the Best Western then meet at the dock at 7. It is 15 minutes away from the Best Western.Good luck.Mike"
1458579,rnnonmt,2012-07-06 17:26:00,992,Ditto on the kudos to Ken/Brenda at Lac Seul Outposts. Stayed their last year and had phenomenal fishing. Service from the staff was great/excellent too. Boats and motors were above average and the cabin was above average. My group fell apart this year so I couldn't return otherwise I would have gone back to LSO this year.
1458984,Bitinlight,2012-07-08 06:52:00,95,"I have fished Canada for over 30 years. I have fished Lac Seul Outposts the last four years in June and am returning for the 5th July trip today. June is the guy trip, and in July, we take our wives. I currently am not looking for another place to go! One interesting thing is that I have had several tremendous ""night bites"" where two of us have caught 100 plus fish per night between 6:30 and dark. The lake doesn't always shut down in the evening. And this has been within 10 minutes of the resort. You can't find better people to deal with than Ken, Brenda, and Chris--just outstanding people. We keep track of fish caught just for fun. The numbers are unbelievable(last two trips were over a 1000), and we do as well in July as in June. And color makes no difference. A jig and minnow or crawler is best, but once you find the fish, anything works."
