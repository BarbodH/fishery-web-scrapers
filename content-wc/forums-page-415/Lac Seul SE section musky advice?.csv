1464081,Woollybob,2012-07-20 12:03:00,158,"From what I am reading, muskie inhabit the NE and SE - Have also seen it described in this thread as the ""entire East side"". I have fished the lake several years for walleye and the occasional northern, but have decided to throw the big baits this year (probably just one day on our trip). Will have the kids with me and would love them to see some action.My question: Can anyone define, in more specific geographical terms, where the range is on the East / SE area? How far West and North does it extend? Reason for asking is I will be staying near Vaughn Lake and would not like to boat any further than I need to. Any clarifications would be greatly appreciated and I believe would add more value to this thread.Thanks!"

1464891,BenBeattie,2012-07-22 19:16:00,232,"Wow! Awesome muskie, what a fat PIG!! That's what lac seul is famous for... big, thick muskies... oh and some walleye too!"
1465059,rnnonmt,2012-07-23 08:09:00,992,Nice Fish!!! I wish I could have caught one but unfortunately it wasn't my turn this year. Had a tough trip. We went the last week of june right after the terrential downpours i heard that a lot of you experienced the week prior. I only ended up fishing 3 of our 7 day trip. My 12 year old son fell out of the camper sleep walking and broke both bones in his right arm at 1 AM of the 3rd morning. A trip to the Sioux Lookout hospital to get fixed up and 1400 bucks later we were back at camp. Pretty lucky in hind sight. Thank goodness it wasnt a compound fracture with bones sticking or we would have a had a helicopter ride somewhere im sure of it. Usually we stay on a houseboat in the Merit bay area or at Lac seul outposts in chamberlain narrows. We probably would have had to wait to navigate back by boat in the morning and in the meantime a 12 year old in pain. Thank goodness we were at a campground 15 minutes from the hospital this year. Needless to say Ill be back next year!
1465123,Pikeslayer8,2012-07-23 10:34:00,1460,So sorry to hear of your son's broken arm. Just sucks.
1417233,rnnonmt,2012-04-06 10:43:00,992,"Hi All.First off, thanks for all the exciting fishing vids on youtube that you all post for us to drool over. I enjoy watching them with my 12 year old son. I have been going to Lac Seul since I was 10 with my Dad (and I am now approaching 40 yikes). We have always gone to the NE section (chamberlain and north) in the 1st or 2nd week of June. Out of our group of 10 we usually accidentally boat one or two muskys each trip when targeting northern. This is the first year that we arent going with my Dad so my son and I are going with a new group of guys to the SE section at the end of June. We will be launching out of deception. Sounds like the new group predominently fish the areas around zig-zag and Sen Bay.In all the years of going to LS I have never caught a musky but never specifically targeted them due to always being up there before the 3rd Saturday. This year I am planning on trying my darned-nest to catch one. I would really appreciate some expert advice from all of you (Ben/Colin hopefully listening) on tackle type/color/size, presentations/speeds, locations of cabbage grass in that area or any info you would be willing to share to help increase my odds. I already have a heavy 7 ft rod and fast retrieve reel. I have zero musky type lures in my array. I will be on the SE section from June 23-30. I would be happy to share any of my NE area experiences/info in return. Sincere thanks in advance. Brian"
1417242,BenBeattie,2012-04-06 11:03:00,232,"Hey Brian, you're in muskie country as soon as you launch at deception. Early season, find emerging cabbage and warmer water in the bays/shallow areas. Stumps, sandbars, reefs and bays... anywhere like that with some weeds is a potential muskie spot. Early season throw smaller (double 8) bucktails. If it's warm try a top-raider in the evenings as well. I would definitely pick up a jimmy (it's like a big tube jig) for early season they worked awesome last year. Colours, I've seen it all work. Black/orange is good, black/silver, perch, sucker and walleye patterns are good too. Good luck and have fun. Check out my website for more info/pics and reports. benbeattieoutdoors.com"
1417260,rnnonmt,2012-04-06 11:35:00,992,"Holy Cow Ben... That was quick. Do you have walleye central set up to alert you anytime someone puts in a keyword ""Ben"" ?? Thanks! I'm heading to your site for some good reading."
1417529,SeulAreaWalleye,2012-04-07 07:47:00,100,"Every year our musky range extends on the SE side of Lac Seul. There are many untouched musky in this lake. If you are fishing the section from the launch to Sen Bay, cover all areas that are warm weedy pockets, close to the main current channel, especially in the zig zig. This area is simply textbook musky water. There is not much musky pressure in the area that you are fishing, but the species is definitely present! I would cover lots of water using small speed bucktails, even Mepps Number 5, weeding through endless pike and smallies until you stumble across that giant musky that has never been caught and released before. Chances of hits and not just follows are so much higher when you encounter a virgin fish. I have years of guests catching accidental musky earlier with fishing bass, pike and walleyes. Find a musky, go back again in a few hours, there will be another!!! Like Ben said, fish the rocks/reefs with plastics as well. Keep us posted on your catches!"
1417706,rnnonmt,2012-04-07 15:49:00,992,Thanks for the info gentlemen. Well appreciated. Anyone ever make their own Jimmys lure? Looks like a standard tube bait with a weighted lead hook with two tandem trebles maybe finished off with some feathers or an extra skirt? Those baits are expensive and I imagine the tubes don't last very long with toothy critters.
1417744,BenBeattie,2012-04-07 17:48:00,232,It's the action on those Jimmy's that make them so effective. I wouldn't want anything but the real deal myself. They last for several fish and big cuts/tears can be super glued. Worth the $$ in my opinion.
1418076,rnnonmt,2012-04-08 14:52:00,992,"I saw on the web a 11"" and 14"" Jimmy and also saw regular and magnum Bulldawgs. Based on my calender date of late June I would imagine the smaller of each of these would be better for late spring/early summer? Is my thinking correct or should I be throwing the bigger 14"" Jimmy and the magnum size Bulldawg? Thanks"
1418110,BenBeattie,2012-04-08 16:58:00,232,I'd go with the smaller ones that early in the season.
1418805,nd89sc88,2012-04-10 02:28:00,92,"I'm going to be at Lost Island Lodge the first week of July. My fishing partner and I have never fished Lac Seul, but would like to do some muskie fishing as part of our week. Do we need to head to Sen Bay and the zig zag? Or are their any muskie grounds nearer our camp? Thanks for any help or insight. Bill"
1419513,SeulAreaWalleye,2012-04-11 07:34:00,100,"The entire East side of Lac Seul holds musky. The species prefers the current end of the lake, over the wide open lake sections. From LIL you do not have to go too far to target musky. It does however take a lot of time to narrow down the particular bays and reefs that muskies prefer here. If it looks good, fish it!"
