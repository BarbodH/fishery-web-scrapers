Weather was very hot, and the little wind made it unusually tougher to find any large congregations of eyes. It seemed one or two would be caught and then we just had to move for a few more. Lightning first day very very near cabin created a burst light bulb and sparks and smoke in cabin, blew circuit breaker, bulb glass all over. We had a little rain one day, but most of the time it was just plain very hot, although it cooled off quickly in the evening and was comfortably cool over night. My 14 year old grandson, on this, his first trip, was leader for several days with a 24"" eye, but got beat out with later 25's, 26's and the biggest, at 27"". We used mostly Gulp minnows, as usual, also twisters, a few night crawlers and minnows. On arrival, the water surface temperature was about 74 degrees, when we left, it had moved up to 77. I don't remember it ever being that warm. Despite the warm weather, the camp was full, including campers, several of which were newbies to camp, who caught and released several very large pike. One particular walleye which I caught was rather peculiar for me. I was vertically fishing with a Gulp minnow. I set the hook and the fish did not move. Not at all. Like a snag. No movement under pressure from the rod. Wow, I figured I had the mother of all eyes! It had to be a monster, I thought, as a 7, or 8 pound-er just couldn't maintain ""0"" movement and hold itself still for that length of time (perhaps 10 seconds) without at least shaking or coming up at least a little. Finally I got it moving, and a very satisfying battle developed. I figured at this point it was at least 30"", maybe more. My complete surprise came when I got the fish into the net, and it measured a mere 21""! We had commented more than once in the past about the unusual fighting ability of the eyes in this lake, they just really fight hard, but I'll remember this one for a long time! All in all, it was still a great week, despite the heat and weather. I also had a great visit up there with Mel from Illinois, another Walleye Central poster, with whom I had communicated prior to the trip. Now to get my crappie stuff together for my fall LOW trip! Life is good! Bill Krejca"
1465104,bode,2012-07-23 09:58:00,39,Could you tell me how deep you were fishing? Our group leaves this Friday for Caribou Lake--a bit east of you but about the same latitude. We usually find them about 25-35 feet at this time of year.Thanks.
1465108,Pooch,2012-07-23 10:09:00,4619,Nice report Bill. Thanks for posting it. I was hoping for it to cool off a little before we go back up this week.Pooch
1465155,Bill Krejca,2012-07-23 12:05:00,6107,"Most fish were caught in 15 - 25 feet of water. a few were taken shallow, perhaps 6 feet, but were in the weeds. The depth clarity of the water probably is a factor - you typically can see down about 6 feet in O'S, I measured it, and a white jig is just visible at 6 feet. We did fish mainly reefs and around them, although some bays with tapering bottoms were sometimes productive. Just for the heck of it - I pulled in what had to be the longest weed I have ever ""caught"", and measured it - 15 feet long. Honest! Good luck, and give us a report when you return. Bill"
1465159,Bill Krejca,2012-07-23 12:15:00,6107,"Another unusual occurrence was the 27"" lake trout my son got while fishing for eyes in 25 feet of water. He was using a Berkely Power Grub white ""Twister Tail"". It seemed unusual to get the trout in that shallow water, considering the surface water temperature. Bill"
1465302,bode,2012-07-23 16:57:00,39,Thanks for the info--will give a report when I get back.
1465782,Jeepman,2012-07-24 17:41:00,386,"Bill, Thanks for your report and posting it on Walleye Central. Our group is heading up to stay at O Sullivan, Aug. 11 through 18. It is our 9 consecutive year to fish Ontario waters but our first year at O Sullivan. I hope that the temperatures are cooler than yours and that the lightning strikes stay further away! You indicated that you fished, as usual, with Gulp minnows and some Berkly curly tails. That suggests you knew where to fish in traditional locations where fish congregate. Did you use the Gulp minnows in addition to the minnows supplied by the camp or in place of the camp-issued minnows? I am trying to determine what would be the best fishing techniques for mid-August...jig/minnow, troll crankbaits, troll crawler/minnow/leech harnesses, work weed ares with spinner baits, etc.???...without overloading and overpacking for the trip. Any suggestions? Thanks. Jeepman"
