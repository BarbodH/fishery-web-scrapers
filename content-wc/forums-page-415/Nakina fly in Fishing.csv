His main camp on Lower Twin Lakes is very nice and was a great place to overnight before flying in the next day.I had a good trip to their Dusey camp in June. Two separate aquaintances fished his Marshall camp in June and also had spectacular fishing.I'm personally looking forward to trying their camp on the Albany river next year.The owner Brad Slagel flew into Dusey while I was there to do some work on the camp.Got to meet him and we even fished together for a day.Great guy, I really like him a lot!"
