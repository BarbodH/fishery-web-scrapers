1464388,NP4ME,2012-07-21 08:56:00,378,"Thanks a lot, Dave. I will give it a shot. NP"
1464743,Bill Krejca,2012-07-22 13:17:00,6107,"I sent the form in the last 2 years, first year received a rebate, last year did not, same info both years. Just got back from trip, I'll try again this year. Bill"
1463207,jimirjr,2012-07-18 16:40:00,1149,I wonder if We can claim this credit with a HOUSEBOAT Package... vs cabin / boat package?
1463325,HeHooksHimself,2012-07-18 21:24:00,725,There must be a service offered (i.e. guide). You cannot get a rebate for lodging.
1463959,tv4fish,2012-07-20 06:48:00,2694,"An update: At a minimum, I will say that the Canadian Revenue Agency is inconsistent I just rec'd a check for a portion of the HST that I sent in for our trip the first part of June. THIS time it was ""adjusted"" - Here's the explanation (and I quote) ""Your rebate application has been adjusted as:- for an all inclusive package, a rebate may be claimed for one-half of the GST/HST paid on a package. Only the portion of the package in which there were nights spent in eligble accomodations would be considered."" Now - last year I rec'd 1/2 the HST that I paid on exactly the same ""package"" as this year. No differences at all. This year it is not even 1/4 of what I paid. ? I have sent in a rebate request for another trip that was the end of June - who knows what will happen with THAT one..............SOOO - Time wise - it took about 1 1/2 months to get processed."
1463991,phishfearme,2012-07-20 08:00:00,1242,i would like to know why some of my outfitters over the past few years have been able to perform the HST rebate (previously the GST rebate) right when i paid for the trip? didn't have to send in anything. i heard some time ago that a certain size deposit was required??? does the outfitter have to apply for authorization for this? my trip a few weeks ago was with pickle lake outposts (pete johnson) and he said he's always done it when you settle the bill. northern outposts in armstrong also gave the rebate directly. whazzup? phish
1464039,NP4ME,2012-07-20 09:44:00,378,"How do you guys file for the rebate? What paperwork is needed? And does an ""American Plan"" package qualify as enough of a ""service"" to get the rebate? Thanks for the help!"
1464054,wallydave,2012-07-20 10:38:00,2151,www.cra.gc.ca I just printed mine off and mailed it in! We'll see how it goes?!
1464056,tv4fish,2012-07-20 10:41:00,2694,"Don't think so --- I don't think your deposit amount has anything to do with the rebate - there is nothing mentioned on the form about a deposit.This is the criteria - It has to be an ""eligible tour package""""An eligible tour package is a tour package that is sold for an all-inclusive price and includes:- short-term and/or camping accommodation in Canada: and- at least one service""(The booklet you want to read is Booklet RC4160 -Rebate for Tour Packages)"
1464191,phishfearme,2012-07-20 16:17:00,1242,no - the deposit size mattered if the outfitter can do the refund directly without all the paperwork. i had heard that the deposit had to be at least 20% of the trip cost for the outfitter to give the rebate directly. phish
1464207,NP4ME,2012-07-20 16:59:00,378,"Dave, Thanks for the link. What form did you print off and where did you find it. I've searched the site and can't seem to find what I'm looking for. I'm sure I have looked right at it a dozen times, yet still can't find it. Thanks, NP"
1464232,GNO,2012-07-20 18:33:00,153,"The outfitter is required by the govt to collect a deposit of 25% of the trip or it can not be done at the point of sale. There is no other requirement for the outfitter to meet to take it directly off your bill and they must fill out the correct form with their HST remittance. Some outfiiters may be nervous of the inconsistancy that is being mentioned and if the govt disagrees with the rebate, the outfitter would be liable to repay the difference"
