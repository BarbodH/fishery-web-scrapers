1465403,Fishin Fun,2012-07-23 20:54:00,218,I started packing my boat too and I leave in less than 2 weeks. Going over last minute items to purchase. Went thru the tackle box last night. Only weights about 50 lbs. Cripes. I'll never use all the crap I have in there! I shoul d buy Cabelas stock or something. Have fun and good luck. Have a safe trip. Let us know how it turned out.
1465434,wallydave,2012-07-23 22:07:00,2151,"Bill good luck and safe trip! Say hey to Andrea for me! I'm taking my wife for her first trip North next June! Stop by Dutchies, good folks from Iowa living their dream in Ontario!"
1465435,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-07-23 22:07:00,235,"Good luck with the trip...drive safe with your boat. You know, I tried a Reef Runner for the first time at the end of my fly in trip last week - trolled around with it for about an hour and a half and caught at 36 inch pike. Good lure. You might consider taking the trebles off when sleeping with it...or at least crimp them barbless."
1465440,rather-be-fishin,2012-07-23 22:44:00,429,Btmbncr ~ too funny! I know exactly how you feel. I'm leaving Saturday morning also for Lac Seul. Have pretty much everything ready to go just have to load it in boat & truck then last minute grocery shopping. Can't wait! RBF.
1465451,Hot Runr Guy,2012-07-24 01:30:00,16061,"Safe travels! If you've never done it before, stop at a truck stop for gas en-route, and get your rig weighed as it's packed & loaded to the gunnels. I did mine a couple of years ago, the number was pretty surprising. Especially what the tow vehicle weighed. HRG"
1465460,F250,2012-07-24 04:33:00,75,I finished the grocery shopping yesterday. We leave Friday for a week at Poutrincourt Lodge in Quebec. I will pick up a flat of 500 crawlers on Thursday ($37.00). Hope it will be cooler up there than it has been around here !

All the food except the frozen stuff is packed.I'm working on packing clothes now.Just got my pre trip haircut now my hat fits better. I work as a nightshift charge nurse in a small Nursing Home here.Tonight I'm slipping a couple of snap weights in my pocket just to stay in touch with ""inner crankbait Chai"". My bride just hit me when she read this post.I even bought her a new landing net and a Smore Holder for the campfire.I'm hiding her pink/white Flickers Shads in size#5 and the #7's.............."
