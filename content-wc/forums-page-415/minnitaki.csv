1463427,kordman,2012-07-19 07:50:00,5,Heading up in two weeks can't wait for the trip. Any help with fishing tips on minnitaki would be very helpful. Thanks.
1463437,nitrodude,2012-07-19 08:02:00,60,"Fished 6/28 - 7/7 and found the water temps warmest I've seen in 17 years. The early Spring and lower snow amounts have allowed the lake to warm fast. Look deep on points and humps 15'-30'+ for larger schools of walleye, although we did catch quite a few shallow on windy areas. (We fished Northeast Bay area mostly.) The chutes produced consistently on large minnow/jig combos, crankbaits and grubs. Water levels were fine, normal to slightly high. Be careful with this warmer summer weather. We got caught in a hailstorm with some hail big as tennis balls and am still nursing some bruises from them. Good luck!"

I have been going there for many, many years and no matter what time of year it is, the key, like alot of lakes, is to hope for some wind and fish the points and humps where the wind is blowing into. The other thing about Minnitaki is to look for these humps or points that are near deeper water. Minnitaki is very deep so dont be afraid to fish in deep water, 35+ would not be uncommon. If its calm out, Minnitaki does tend to slow down between 11-3 so dont be surprised if the action drops off a little. Stick with it and you will find the fish. I am a basic jig and minnow guy, pretty simple fishing.Feel free to contact me if you want more detailed info. More than happy to help in any way. I go twice a year and cant wait for my Labor Day trip!Have a great day"

The boat I was in had good fishing on Friday pretty much all day. The fish we caught on Friday were all off the top of mid lake reefs. The reefs came up to 5-12 ft and we caught fish right on top and then on the drops off the sides. The other boat in our group struggled to catch fish on Friday.Saturday was slower in the morning. Still fished the reefs and picked up a few but the best fishing came off of wind blown points that day. We were catching fish in 25-30' that day and the boat I was in caught a couple slot fish along with a nice 22"" but that was the big for our trip. The other boat struggled again and the boat I was in took out the lower unit at the end of the day which put a damper on the trip.Sunday was a struggle and with three people in our boat, we just couldn't find fish consistently. We could pick up a couple fish at every spot we went to but it would pretty much shut down.The wind was constantly changing speed and direction. That, along with the warm temps and sun beating down on the water most of the days, made it tough to stay on fish. Minnows and crawlers were the baits of choice. They fished pretty equally but I'd say crawlers were slightly better. Good luck."
