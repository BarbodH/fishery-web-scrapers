1459891,Jigger1,2012-07-10 08:15:00,234,"Thunder  are you headed to Silver Water Wheel Lodge? If so the guides will take you to the spots that are producing. They share information every evening at roundtable which is a daily discussion of all the activity that occurred that day. If you're not staying there I could mention the names of the spots using their vernacular but it probably wouldn't mean much as very few relate to anything on the map. And as the lodge is isolated in the south central basin, there are very few other boats we see while fishing because of the length of boat ride to get there. As an example one of the weedbeds we fished was called Gateway. In 13 years of driving by this weedbed countless times, I had never fished it before. I know where it's at, could drive a boat to it from the lodge, but couldn't tell you coordinates as I'm not driving the boat and don't have a GPS. Wish I could be of more assistance but one of the many reasons I go to SWWL is so that all I have to do is focus on is catching fish."

1465095,crawler catcher,2012-07-23 09:30:00,72,Jigger1Sent you a PM with a question.Leaving in two days !!!Thanks
1459438,Jigger1,2012-07-09 08:50:00,234,"Well finally had a few minutes this weekend to compile the data and another outstanding trip to SWWL is officially in the books. Unfortunately this trip was prefaced by the passing of my father-in-law who was a great man and I had the privilege of calling Dad for many years. He will be truly missed. On the first day I wore this fluorescent yellow walleye T-Shirt because it came out of his closet and had never been worn. I was greeted with a 26 walleye to start the trip, followed shortly thereafter with a 28 walleye which ended up being big dog during the trip this year. I had always wanted to bring him on this trip but his health condition wouldn't allow me to bring him to such a remote place. We were faced with the hot weather, the blowing winds and all the rest yet I somehow walked away with my 3rd best trip ever to Lac Seul. I ended up putting 25 walleyes over 24 in the boat topping out with a 27, 27.5 & a 28. I had two 26.75 that we couldn't get any more out of that were just hogs. It was an interesting trip with my mind wrapped around obvious issues at home, trying to relax and enjoy the trip and dealing with some extreme weather conditions. We fished June 27  July 2, most of the volume came out of 15' or less and many times we were fishing in 6-8' of water adjacent to or even in weedbeds. Three of my big fish came out of 25' plus so while there were lots of fish up shallow including some bigs (topped out at 27.5 shallow), there were also populations of big fish deep. Deep fishing was must slower and methodical but produced. The hard part this trip was leaving all the shallow activity to go hunt exclusively for bigs in deep water. Our biggest volume day was the second day of the blow, June 29. The gusting portion of the wind was done and we just hammered fish with the steady west wind. I put 27 fish over 18 on the sheets and I easily caught over 100 fish for the day. It was non-stop action all day long and was the day I caught the 27.5 in less than 15' of water. As usual, the folks at SWWL did an outstanding job, great hospitality, food, equipment and just an all around outstanding time at SWWL. 54 days until I'm back at the Wheel and looking forward to a much more normal trip."
1459443,Chars guide,2012-07-09 08:55:00,39,"So for those of us that aren't in the know, what does swwl relate to?"

1459454,Pikeslayer8,2012-07-09 09:32:00,1460,Sorry to hear of your father-in laws passing. The yellow shirt is now legendary. Glad you had a great trip otherwise.
1459486,Aaron-IN,2012-07-09 10:55:00,500,"Congrats on another great trip On another note, I'm always amazed at the number of fisherman that actually keep track of how many fish they catch and the size of each, that's just WAY too much work for me"
1459489,wallydave,2012-07-09 11:05:00,2151,"Jigger, I know the feeling of loss. My sister just passed away this weekend. She and her family loved the outdoors, hunting and fishing. For those family members who we share our passions with, they can see how improtant these trips are for us. I have a feeling you had shared some stories with your father-in-law, and I bet he was with you in spirit this trip! Every time you wear that shirt you will honor his life! Thanks for sharing! PS sounds like a good trip too!"
1459580,Jigger1,2012-07-09 14:21:00,234,"Aaron - At Silver Water Wheel Lodge, the guides must record every walleye over 18"". They record the location, the angler, species and length of fish. When I get home I then enter them into my own spreadsheet that I've been maintaining for 13 years. To me the most amazing part is that prior to going to LacSeul, I had caught thousands of walleyes but only one over 24"" in my first 33 years of life. Over the last 13 years I've now caught 203 LacSeul walleye over 24"" including 25 of them over 27"". It's a little slice of heaven up there and LacSeul is a walleye factory!"
1459629,Aaron-IN,2012-07-09 15:54:00,500,guess that explains why I'm not a guide
1459670,lassh,2012-07-09 17:37:00,553,"Those are some impressive numbers, jigger. I too am sorry for your loss."
1459683,Guest,2012-07-09 18:10:00,0,Would you care to share a couple areas that were good as we are heading there the 13
