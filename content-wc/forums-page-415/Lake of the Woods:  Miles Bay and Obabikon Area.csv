I have to say it was one of the best trips I have ever been on! The camp is awesome. Lake of the Woods is a great spot and fishing around the camp is second to none. Let's start with the Camp: It is an isolated island with nice rustic cabins, with everything you need. They serve breakfast to order every day, which is phenomenal, Either a sack lunch or shore lunch, whichever you prefer, and of course an amazing dinner. I know it is hard to hear about an isolated island in the middle of nowhere but, and I mean it, the food was some of the highest quality food you can get. They has put up a few new buildings and have been working on residing the old ones giving everything a great look. The resort is very nicely kept with grass and flowers worked in to the natural rock and landscaping. The fishing, why you go there, is also spectacular. The Northern Pike where fun and plentiful. We caught sizes ranging from 18 to 36"" with the average fish being around the 27"" mark. The small mouth bass where of good size even though they were catch and release at the time we were there. Crappie were a plenty with some good sizes. Then of course there was the walleye. Found some great spots to reel in a bunch of these as well. Can't say enough about Jared. He works hard to please and does a bang up job doing it. We had the pleasure of having him as our guide one day and made the entire day a fun and successful trip. He also made a shore lunch that day back at the resort which was delicious. Bottom line, if your looking for a place to have plenty of variety and quantity of fish, friendly staff, and a great atmosphere, I highly recommend Amason's Obabikon Bay Camp! www.obabikon.com"

After a week or more of fishing 30 foot of water, we were all pumped that they'd finally moved up. In a couple hours, we boated 40+ fish. Kept 7 fish between 17 and 20 inches. Also, caught 10 JUMBO perch on the humps too, and a 40"" northern pike. Was a great evening to be on the lake to say the least! Humps 10' and then fall off the sides on occasion to 14-15'."
1457861,Obabikon,2012-07-05 04:41:00,2370,"Been musky fishing the past three days. We've boated 9. Probably had another 7 that we lost, and we've seen 30+ fish. It's been fun. Right now the biggest is mid 40's, and we've seen a couple 50"" fish just no takers. Each day we start by catching enough walleye/perch for lunch. Always casting for the big girls by 9:30. Walleyes seem to be on the sides of humps. Ten to fifteen feet deep. The heat broke yesterday, hopefully it cools off some for the long run."
1460782,Obabikon,2012-07-12 12:59:00,2370,"Went walleye fishing the past two days. Holy cow is it hot out. The walleyes have been biting pretty well, but only on the back sides of humps (for me at least). Find a reef or hump, and then fall off to 20-24 feet deep. Good luck out there!"
1460816,Red Pine J,2012-07-12 14:46:00,44,"Yeah, been hot here in Missery also. Say Obabikon, I was curious if you were anywheres close to Witch Bay???? Hope to see ya someday!!!!!!!!! john"
1460862,Obabikon,2012-07-12 17:37:00,2370,Nope... they're on the North East side of the Lake... I'm way down south. Probably a 50-80 miles depending on if you used Turtle Portage or went around.
1460892,Red Pine J,2012-07-12 19:12:00,44,"That portage sounds like a ""trip""...lol Stay safe!!!!!!"
1464873,Obabikon,2012-07-22 18:31:00,2370,"Had a great day of Musky fishing today. Boated a 52 and a 45. They were lots of fun. Muskies seem to be on pretty much all the normal structure at this point. Had another 50 figure eight a couple times. Rocks, weeds, sand, points... just fish and have fun! Walleyes are starting to move back up the humps, and at this point range from 15-22 feet deep. After a week or so hiatis, the big ones are starting to bite. My uncle boated a 29"" yesterday."
1446871,Obabikon,2012-06-09 05:43:00,2370,"Hey everyone, sorry I've been slow to post this. The fishing overall this spring has been spectacular. We had a couple ""slowish"" days early in the week. However, yesterday was an unbelievable day of fishing. Lots of 20+ walleyes, and tons of 16-18"" take homes were caught. I personally found the walleyes on boulder shorelines in 8-10' of water. Other guides are finding them between 10 and 15 feet deep. Earlier in the week, they were much deeper... in the range of 20-25. The saving grace of the slow walleyes early in the week was that the crappie were biting. We caught lots of them on sunken trees in the area. They have moved into the dock, and we're catching a ton of them. Northerns are going crazy up in Obabikon Lake. I was telling some of our guests that Obabikon makes a guides job easy. You'll need to find some of the deeper weed beds in order to find the bigger fish. But, there's a bunch of action to be had. Smallmouth are on the shore lines, and the evening bite is great! Crankbaits thrown next to boulder rocks will produce lots of fish. Muskies, while they're not open yet, have been active. They should be moving for opener next Saturday!"
1447155,Obabikon,2012-06-10 07:08:00,2370,Pouring rain right now! Which is good... we need it. The thunder and lightening could go away though.
1447282,1shooter,2012-06-10 12:34:00,1493,Thanks for the report. See you in 6 days.
1447291,Bill Krejca,2012-06-10 12:58:00,6107,"Thanks for the report. How about surface water temperature, roughly. Bill"
1447399,Obabikon,2012-06-10 18:03:00,2370,"It probably cooled off today, but I've seen it as high as 72."
1447436,wingmann,2012-06-10 19:24:00,42,Thanks for the report Jared. We are looking forward to getting up there in a couple of weeks.
1448883,Obabikon,2012-06-13 13:59:00,2370,"I got out with some friends for a half day of fishing. Guests have been saying it was slow. I fished deep... no luck, fished humps... no luck, I went to weed beds... bang. We got some very nice fish 3-18"" fish and several 15 and 16's for shore lunch. If you fished deep... you were almost overwhelmed with small ones. If you fished the edges of weed beds at about 7 feet, you caught nicer fish. It wasn't fast or furious... but we caught nicer sized fish."
1449232,jambi,2012-06-14 09:23:00,504,What kind of presentation was successful in the weeds and on the weed edges? Thanks in advance....
1449573,Obabikon,2012-06-15 05:54:00,2370,"Just a jig and a minnow. 1/4oz... I was using white, other people were having success with other colors. Move into the weed line, and then slide back out. You can also flip towards it if you're worried about motor noise."
1450222,Obabikon,2012-06-17 07:35:00,2370,"Fishing's been pretty good. With all the rain, the water level is up quite a bit. I would say that it's within a few inches of spot on the map... in the next couple days, it'll be a little high. A young man boated a 55 1/2 inch musky on a spinner bait and 8LB test a couple days ago. Walleyes have been active, but very spread out. Anywhere from 6' deep all the way to 32'. Seems like everyone's catching some though. The Crappies still haven't shown back up yet. But, with the bad weather, that's not suprising. We've had a lot of rain, and pretty much the opposite of stable conditions... (as it's changing back and forth ever hour or so) Small mouth are biting on the shore lines... deeper running cranks and tubes have both been working."
