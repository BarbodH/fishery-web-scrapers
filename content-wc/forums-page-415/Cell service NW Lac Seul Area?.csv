No cell phone , computer etc. I think that was a real big draw for me getting hooked on fly-in trips and fly-in canoe trips . I worked 30 years at a sevice company where I was the main contact person . We had 5 phone lines and had 50 to 100 people a day visit our shop . Needless to say I am sick of phones . As my Dad was aging and had many health issues . He was not on his death bed but could have been at anytime . I still had to get away . It got to the point after being away at a camp for 2 or 3 days that my mind got to wondering about how he was doing . Finally I took a Sat . phone and would touch base with him and Mom a couple times during our trips. Once I heard their voices and new things were going ok I could relax again and enjoy myself . He worried about us too and that helped him hearing from us . No ,I could not have done anything for him being that far away but believe me it helped knowing they were ok and I could proceed to enjoy my trip . I did mention this to a guy I know and he said he did not go on a couple trips as he was in the same situation . He started taking a Sat. phone and doing the same and said it helped him too . Most people just cannot shutoff ""some"" parts of the outside world , especially loved ones . My Dad is now gone and I no longer take a phone with me . As far as my computer , cell phone , texting etc . I can live without it ."
1465043,hoosiercanadian,2012-07-23 07:42:00,104,"I wish sat phones were more affordable, i have rented one three times and it was expensive each time, i would have thought that by now that competition would make the price drop but that hasn't happened yet. The first time i took my girlfriend and while up there her mother took ill, she used the phone daily , when i got home i found out she ran up a $1,200 bill, ouch eh ! The second and third time i was more cautious, but it still cost me $300."
1465057,Ogoki,2012-07-23 08:06:00,291,"Hoosiercandaian , I rented the Sat . phone from Mattice Lake Outfitters . They charged us $100 plus the minutes . If I remember correctly the minutes were .45 cents per minute . I do remenber it was less than $125 for the week and we used it something like 3 times . I have looked online for rentals and they were much higher than what mattice wanted . Just a thought for the future . Many outfitters rent them also as you probably know ."
1464562,Weby13,2012-07-21 20:20:00,57,I put a international plan on my phone for 10 days. It cost me $25. My buddy didn't do the same plan who also has AT&T. His also worked fine he's just gonna get charged alot more than $25!
1464596,rather-be-fishin,2012-07-21 21:56:00,429,I am also putting the international plan with AT&T on my phone for the week. Eliminates the high roaming charges. Also planning to bring my lap top to check the weather & stay in touch with family back home & update them on hopefully awesome fishin reports!
1464649,wallydave,2012-07-22 08:09:00,2151,"Goose Bay has wifi at the office.During a meal break I could take my Kindle Fire email my wife post on WC and check the weather.No extra plans or expenses this way. As mentioned before part of getting away is unplugging, being able to give a daily fishing report is a nice option. Just because its available doesn't mean you have to use it! I like having the option!"
1464662,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-07-22 08:51:00,235,I once looked into renting satellite internet terminal for a fly in...the cost was ridiculous (something like $300-$400 for four days). Mainly wanted the weather radar. Have to settle for looking to the west and making a best guess...I guess.
1464677,rather-be-fishin,2012-07-22 09:19:00,429,"Weby13 how about sharing a fishing report. We leave for Fisherman's Cove this Saturday & would appreciate an update on fishing depths, areas, baits & water levels. Thanks! RBF"
1464711,hoosiercanadian,2012-07-22 11:01:00,104,"If you don't have an international plan Rodgers cell service charges 15.36/MB. Received this text message around Winnipeg, turned my cell phone off instantly, and did'nt turn it back on until i was way south of the border. Rodgers covers a large area, Red Lake, Ear Falls, Kenora,and even as far north as Thompson Manitoba. Rodger is sitting back raking it in !!!!!"
1464733,bigdaddyguns,2012-07-22 12:21:00,608,"If you have a smartphone with a US-only domestic data plan be sure to turn off data roaming. As hoosiercanadian points out the data roaming charges are mind mindbogglingly high, $15/MB is equal to $15,000 per gigabyte!"
1464752,rather-be-fishin,2012-07-22 13:31:00,429,"Yes, AT&T told me to turn off my data roaming & fetch new data settings off when I am in Canada to prevent those high charges."
1464754,Weby13,2012-07-22 13:38:00,57,This was my groups first time to LS in July. We usually go the 2nd or 3rd week of June. Fishing was a slow compared to what were used to. We found the best depth for Walleye in 12-16 FOW. With some being caught as shallow as 4 FOW. All the other groups in camp said they all did really well. Hopefully Steve of Madison will chime in and help you out with some info. He stayed in the cabin next to us. He always fishes Onaway Lodge the 2nd week of July. His group did really well! Steve is a great guy with alot of info!!!
1464970,IA JOE,2012-07-22 22:40:00,35,Very iffy at Timberlane. Worked for me but not my 13 year old.
1464280,rather-be-fishin,2012-07-20 20:31:00,429,Just wondering what kind of cell service reception there is if you have international plan with AT&T on NW end of Lac Seul area? (Perrault Falls to Ear Falls area). Thanks!
1464299,wallydave,2012-07-20 21:28:00,2151,I have verizon and was able to call and text from camp.
1464306,Weby13,2012-07-20 21:56:00,57,JUst got back today from Onaway lodge. I have at&t and could call and text fine! 3 others with Verizion and sprint could do the same!
1464308,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-07-20 22:01:00,235,Some might suggest finding a camp where you don't get cell signal...
1464319,rather-be-fishin,2012-07-21 00:00:00,429,"I know, I know ...... I agree, but a newbie in our group that is going was asking & can't be without contact with the rest of the world.... So wanted me to find out. Normally I just turn my phone off for the week. But it will be nice to share some pics of all the nice eyes we are catching! RBF"
1464320,bigtimeelectric,2012-07-21 00:09:00,174,"I shut mine off at the border and love every minute away from it. I do bring my laptop though and will check my email once in a while if the world at home needs to get ahold of me, but mainly use it for weather"
1464347,WalleyeWally28,2012-07-21 06:01:00,298,I also shut mine off for the week we are in Canada. Anybody that would need to call me (emergency only) has the camp number. I don't own a laptop but it would be handy for keeping up-to-date on the weather.
1464376,lcwhit,2012-07-21 08:22:00,104,"it gets better every year it seems. can be spotty in goose bay area, but you can usually find both verizon and att signals. sometimes need to go just a little way out in the water."
1464464,SinOrSwim,2012-07-21 12:40:00,1528,"How was it? We will be there first part of September. We were able to get cell reception at Onaway last year. Sometimes we had to go out to the road but other times we actually got cell reception ON the water! Were sitting there fishing and my brothers phone rang. LOLFor those who don't understand the need for contact, everyone is differnent. Some of us have small kids and like to keep in touch. Plus, it helps the wives accept the fact we take a guys trip if we can call home once in awhile."
1464544,BennieS,2012-07-21 19:25:00,108,Weby 13. I have AT&T and know squat about phones. Do you have one of the international plans with AT&T that allowed you to make a phone call from there to the states or can you just dial and pay some roaming charges? Thanks
