I think the only thing that I would add to your awesome recipe is a half lime squeeze on top. You are right that same ole same ole shore lunches can be boring. We hardly ever do the baked bean thing anymore. If we want top shelf shore lunch, I like to make foil packs with (par boiled) potatoes, peppers, onions, fresh mushrooms and a chunk of cheese. Just pull em out of the shore lunch box and throw em right in the coals. With everything but the cheese par cooked, its just a matter of heating it up."
1423226,MorganMan,2012-04-19 07:32:00,341,"Pikeslayer.....we do have lime juice but it's in the chipotle sauce. It's not really an exact recipe, but more to taste. We use 1/2 mayonaise and 1/2 sour cream as the base. We use a food processor to chop up some shallot, cilantro, chipotle peppers in adobo sauce (with more sauce to taste for the heat), and lime juice and lime zest. Then we add the base and mix and bottle it up. We use a food processor now so its all a uniform consistency to use those disposable squeeze bottles you can buy. It doesn't clog the tip with the food processor method. The walleye baja tacos are truly a hit for famished fisherman. Tortilla or taco shell, chunked up walleye, cabbage (cole slaw mix in bag), and baja sauce top it all off!"

1436560,joeman79,2012-05-16 20:56:00,417,Perfect for a shore lunch. I bring some fresh Cilantro ans a can of Chipotle peppers in Abodo sauce to make the sour cream dressing and mix it up with Cabbage and onions for a slaw and They are by far a big hit and on of the groups favorite with a bunch of deep fat fried walleye strips. God I am getting hungry for some fresh walleyes at shore lunch.
1443407,mclemson,2012-05-31 22:31:00,19,"I just had to reply that we did Thai fish tacos last year, with red cabbage/daikon radish/carrot slaw and Thai chili pepper tartar sauce. Kimchi optional! You've really got to reinvent the shore lunch if you have the skills to do so."
1464911,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-07-22 19:46:00,235,"Introduced fish tacos to our group this year. We did flour tortillas, shredded cabbage and a killer sauce I found online at allrecipes.com: 1/2 cup plain yogurt 1/2 cup mayonnaise 1 lime, juiced 1 jalapeno pepper, minced 1 teaspoon minced capers 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon dried dill weed 1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepperIn a medium bowl, mix together yogurt and mayonnaise. Gradually stir in fresh lime juice until consistency is slightly runny. Season with jalapeno, capers, oregano, cumin, dill, and cayenne."
1464916,jopes,2012-07-22 20:09:00,692,"cut walleye into strips to fit in the tortilla shells.bread and fry the way you usually do.top with some cheese, coleslaw, cilantro and tarter sauce."
1422271,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-04-17 10:49:00,235,Anyone ever make walleye tacos on their Canadian fishing trip? We do the batter/fry thing but want to mix things up for a meal or two.
1422293,stevensinks,2012-04-17 11:32:00,330,One year on a trip with Joeman he fixed them. They were good.
1422296,cuamb,2012-04-17 11:35:00,203,"No fish tacos but we do this to break it up.Lay onions in the bottom of a pan and place fillets over them. Then baste with soy sauce, lemon juice and butter (mix equal parts of each on the stove top to get sauce). Place pan of fillets on grill or in oven. Cooks quickly and tastes great. Make sure you keep basting as you cook so the fillets don't dry out. Sometimes we put mushrooms on the bottom of the pan also."
1422298,SinOrSwim,2012-04-17 11:38:00,1528,"We make walleye tacos all the time. We still deep fry them though. Tortillas travel well in a tote. We cut the walleye in chunks or strips and then batter and fry. Put a few chunks in a tortilla, add either chopped lettuce or cabbage, some chopped up bacon and anything from wing sauce (several different Buffalo Wild Wing sauces go every year) to ranch to tartar or a chipotle sour cream!!If you want a crunchy shell, deep fry the tortilla for a couple seconds on each side folding over when it's in the oil.We make a chipotle sour cream sauce and then take up in plastic squirt bottles. The Baja Walleye Tacos are one of the favorites.The bacon is already fried and crumbled, we take in a coupld different zip lock bags. Bags of shredded lettuce or cabbage are cheap and simple too. Throw all that stuff in a cooler. Simple and makes shore lunch awesome!Doing something other than plain ole fried fish planks and beans got boring. The tortillas make things simple and you can make a wrap or a taco.We also make Walleye/Seafood Chimichangas for dinner. Those are by far my favorite meal up there."
1422301,back357,2012-04-17 11:45:00,106,"We use fish tacos as a lunch item. We fry up a bunch of fish for dinner, making sure we have some for the next day. Take a head of cabbage, slice real thin, put salt, pepper and ranch dressing on it and put that in a ziploc. Bring a large bottle of salsa, a large onion, and some large tortillas. For lunch, find a spot, pull everything out and assemble (tortilla, fish, slaw, onion, and salsa). Awesome."
1422307,Jig Man,2012-04-17 11:58:00,95,"Unless we are cooking shoreluch on an island we rarely fry fish in the cabin. Walleye Taco's w/ Chipolte Cream Sauce is in our regular rotation along with Walleye Almandine, and Baked Walleye Italiano. I highly recomend this site anytime you are searching for a recipehttp://allrecipes.com/search/default...in=Home%20Page"
1422310,jambi,2012-04-17 12:06:00,504,Oh man great idea. I just updated my food list Thanks!
1422312,SinOrSwim,2012-04-17 12:12:00,1528,You use left over fried fish? Doesn't that get soggy?
1422363,plumberjoe,2012-04-17 14:11:00,54,We add seasoned chunky tomatoes or a chunky salsa on top.Several of the old guys turned up there nose at first till they tried them now they want them every year.
1422710,back357,2012-04-18 08:48:00,106,"We use a dry breading, so what I do is make sure it is dried on paper towels, and when storing in the fridge for the night, put it in a paper sack instead of a ziploc. That results in less condensation. In the morning, just pack the fish with some paper towels and you should be good to go. It is not as crunchy as that night, but by the time you are adding slaw and salsa, it gets moist anyway."
