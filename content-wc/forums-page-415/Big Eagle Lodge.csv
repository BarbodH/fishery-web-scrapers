We stayed at Big Eagle in early June (first time to Eagle Lake) and she didn't appear to be in the best health at the time. Not sure of her age, but she came across as a sweet old lady and still tried her best to stay involved in as much of the operations of the camp as her health would allow. My sympathies go out to the family as I'm sure it will be difficult to run the resort in the short term. Her husband, daughter and grandson all run the resort. Not sure if anyone on the board has stayed at Big Eagle or knew Jackie, but figured I'd pass along the news."

1465692,Guest,2012-07-24 14:24:00,0,My friend and I stayed there last year and spent some time with Jackie and her family. She was a fine lady with obvious health problems and always tried to do her best. We know she will be missed by her family and all her friends she made at Big Eagle. We offer our utmost condolences to her family.

We typically only stay a few days a year, but within your firat stay Jackie knew you and treated you like family. Each year wanting to catch up with how things are going, how your kids are-even knowing all their names. She will truly be missed Jon and Amy have my heart felt sympathy."
