We walleye fish, but it seems like we always catch plenty of Northern, Smallmouth and even an occasional Musky. Also, just curious if they have done anything with the lodge? Thanks!"
1464931,Campcountry,2012-07-22 20:48:00,164,Water levels are on the low side of normal. Fishing has been good in the area up to now but mid August is a long ways away

1465028,Campcountry,2012-07-23 06:55:00,164,No big changes yet. The explosion was a refuelling accident which sent a few people to hospital.
1465070,Slashorn,2012-07-23 08:25:00,19,"there last week. Walleye fishing was a little slow but otherwise okay. The muskies were not as aggressive yet, but should be picking up this week. I caught 3 30inch pikes. My recommendation is to throw #7 bucktails during the day and maybe larger in morning and in dusk as the larger ones were not working in the day. That said, have several large (45+) follows. Water level down a little but otherwise pretty good."
