One of our group even caught a 49.5 inch Muskie off the docks. Walleye bite was tough at first, but bottom bouncers and gold or chartreuse spinners tipped with a bit of crawler was the ticket. Best spots for us were dog island, gull island and sunset island in 18-20 FOW. Pike bite was very good, meyers bay produced the most, but Muskie point was also good. Cheryl and Marcel picked up and accommodated our reservation from Bear Trail, and our arrangements we're transferred by Casey. No complaints at all, Canada delivers the fun!"

1464145,del-yakker,2012-07-20 14:42:00,6,"We did not hire a guide, just scouted and talked to the staff and other people in camp. Myers bay has reeds all around, and it was all good. The north end was very good, just at the outside edge of the reeds, over the cabbage. We did not bring a trolling motor, which would have been nice. You can rent one, but we didn't. The camp boats run well, and idle down nicely. The upgrade boats were roomy and a bit faster."

1464694,Danbear,2012-07-22 10:23:00,72,"fishinut- Thanks for the tip I have always wanted to hit that spot, maybe this year will be the year, that's why I love Eagle Lake it's always hard to decide where to fish and it is so fun exploring new spots too. This year I am bound and determined to make it to Buzzard Falls just so I can say I went there, last 2 years I tried and stopped half way there and started catching fish and never continued any further. 28 days to wait."
