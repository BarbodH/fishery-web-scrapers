I've always had a love for Brook Trout and find myself drooling over photographs of wild trophy Brookies. Obviously walleyes would be on the list also. Do any of you gentlemen have any knowledge and recomendations for an outstanding trophy Brook Trout fishery and lodges in Ontario or Quebec? Just for the record, I have a fly rod but do not consider myself a flyfisherman. Thanks for any advice or pointing me in the right direction."

By and large few trophies although the possibility does exist, but great numbers and beautiful wild fish.Any questions shoot me a pm.Cheers"
1462908,Yellow Fever,2012-07-18 04:49:00,1809,Hello....if you want trophy Brookies you need to fish the north shore area of Lake Superior around Nipigon. There are a few guides you could contact with Dave Brennan being the one i would go out with. Remember as with any trophy fishing you probably won't get lots but it is an awesome place to fish for the scenery alone
1463719,Sportdog,2012-07-19 16:00:00,6735,So far some great information. Thanks gentlemen. Any other recomendations?
1463760,MikeMcC,2012-07-19 17:13:00,72,Be sure to look at Onaman River Resort. They have direct access to Lake Nipigon for trophy size brook trout and lake trout. Also some great walleye lakes in the area if the wind keeps you off Nipigon. Not a fancy place but good location and Robert is a great guide and resort owner.

This lodge is at the head of God's River and the river is LOADED with brookies up to 24"". Several Manitoba master angler Brookies are caught every year. There are a few other lodges on God's Lake but this is the ONLY lodge on God's River. It also offers trophy walleye - one trip we had 4 walleyes over 10 pounds casting crank baits and trophy northern with our personal best at 47"" on top water. Food is good. It is a bit pricey but you only live once and I would encourage you to visit their website. Good luck!"
1463896,adempsey,2012-07-19 22:05:00,963,That lodge looks amazing. Would love a trip out there.
