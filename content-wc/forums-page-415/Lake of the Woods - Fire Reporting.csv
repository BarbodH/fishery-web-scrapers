1464457,Golden Eagle,2012-07-21 12:10:00,2642,"New fire, Kenora 73, has just been posted as ""being observed"". Could be the fire you're watching. Was caused by lightning."

1464587,J-Man,2012-07-21 21:28:00,191,"from any bell phone:807-310-3473 is the fire reporting hotline.Someone had us call about the one in Miles and it had been reported. Also called about another on Big Raspberry tonight, but Terry at the Marina had called just before me.They brought the water bombers down for that one after the choppers looked it over. We saw the whole thing from here in the bay. It was quite a sight but I hope I never see it again.If you are concerned about the fire hazard in the area and lack of a burning ban, please call 1-888-258-8842 and listen to the summary so you can leave a message with your name and number asking someone to call you back and explain why there is no burn ban on in Northwest Ontario region.We need to flood this number with calls. Even a couple inches of rain won't do much to lower fire hazard with how dry things are here."

There is a 60% chance of showers and thunderstorms today, but that is a mixed blessing because of the lightning. It is starting to look like a repeat of last year. Here is a link to a map of where the current fires are http://forest.lrc.gov.on.ca/AFFM/fir...ap_English.htm"
1464618,Obabikon,2012-07-22 05:59:00,2370,"I had to call the Kenora fire department to find that number Justin. They told me they don't respond to Miles Bay area fires.... when I called the number, they told me the Kenora Fire Department was responding to the fire... Long story short, I don't believe they're going to do much of anything to help us down here."
