507432,Big D,2000-03-19 20:35:00,61,Looking for recommendations regarding this location. Want to take my family up in August and would like to know anything/everything about this facility. Thanks for any help!!
507433,Guest,2000-03-20 07:27:00,0,The owners are very nice people. Facilities are great especially the dock area. We camped and the facilities were fine. Walleyes ae a fair ways away. Whitefish Bay is a very clear lake.

Facilities are great; dock and boats appeared to be in excellent shape; and, best of all, staff we talked to were exceptionally friendly. Our reservations are in for this August."

This will be my first trip to LOTW, and Sioux Narrows. Do you have any suggestions for the fishing this time of year?ThanksErick"

The grounds and common areas were also very clean. The people seemed very nice and seemed to know what customer service is all about.I've been in Holiday Inns that did not look as good as my wife's cabin.Last time I stayed in that area, I seem to remember taking some long boat rides for fishing."
507438,Walleye-guy,2000-03-26 09:24:00,15,I'm going to be at Tomahawk from May 27-June 3. It is my first stay there also. I was wondering if any one could put some posts on here about where to catc the 'eyes at that time of year! Many smallmouth in the area?
507436,Guest,2000-03-31 21:57:00,0,"No, Motlong's isn't where we stayed. Would like to offer some fishing tips but I'm afraid I'm far from being an expert. Our take last year was underwhelming, to say the least. Looking forward to a much better experience this year."
