I hear since the bottom of most lakes are flat rock that there aren't many fish, is this true? Also I would appreciate any other info about it. Thanks, Steve."

507406,Guest,2000-03-19 12:48:00,0,I go every year to Opeongo for the trout opener in April the weathers cold because the ice is usually just off the lake 15-20 lakers for the weekend warms you up though. Have also fished Sec lake fantastic smallmouth fishing in the summer.
507407,Guest,2000-03-26 09:48:00,0,Lots of fish in Algonquin Provincial Park.There is a great map of the park you can download from the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources web site . Its under publications.The best fishing (i think) is if you come in from the northern.Come in from HWY 17.Also check out the Ontario Parks web site.You will find links on my web page www.ovfishing.comregards Jeff
