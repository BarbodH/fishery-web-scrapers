The hot irons last year were Zara Spooks for the Northern. Fire Tiger Shad Raps for the Eyes, and Clown Skitter Pops for the Smallies. I nailed mucho smallies on Huskey Jerks as well. I also did a fair amount of damage with the old Dare Devil for all breeds of fish. A few of my partners last year did some jiggin, but I am not sure what colors they used. As far as I am concerned if a fella has a variety of lures in fire tiger, clown, rapala black and gold he or she has all they need. Good Luck! although you won't need it. Check out Canoe Canada's web site there is some helpful information about Quetico. They are also a full outfitter so they can really square you away. http://www.canoecanada.comSee Ya!"
