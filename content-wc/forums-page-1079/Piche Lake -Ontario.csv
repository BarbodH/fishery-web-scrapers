507234,Guest,2000-03-26 10:48:00,0,I fished Piche 4 years back and had a great time. Walleyes bite very fast. Size of walleyes is constent between 16-18 inches. I caught a walleye on every lure in my box even the largest muskie lure. We trolled to find fish then used small jigs with twister tails when fish were found. Piche is also a catch and release Pike lake but the weeds were up when we were there so we did not catch many pike. The lake is shallow most areas are 5-7ft.You will have a great time.Good luck.
