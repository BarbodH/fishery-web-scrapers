507422,Tim,2000-03-18 20:34:00,179,I've driven by this lake a number of times and was wondering if it's a decent walleye lake. Is the only boat launch at the campground?
507423,Scott,2000-03-30 09:42:00,385,"The only boat launch IS through the park as far as I know (and beleive me - I drove EVERY road into the lake this winter looking for access - South on the Nursery Road was the only other access and then I was thankful for my 4 Wheel Drive.The Walleye fishery on this lake is pretty good from everything I have heard - although as a shore fisherman, I have been relegated to catching the numerous smaller Pike inhabiting the weedbeds - still a lot of fun. I believe that Eagle is one of the few lakes in this province that you are allowed to keep 'Eyes. Although I still advocate catch and release... however there is nothing like a good feed of Walleye... can't wait to go home to SK! It's a nice lake close to Calgary - that is it's main drawing point for me - I'm not much of a trout fisherman... Good Luck!"

As for the launch, Only one is in the park, you have to pay to use it and last time I was out there you could barely launch a 12 footer. It was very shallow. Whole lake is shallow, No more than 18 feet at the very best. Fish out the sides of your boat and do a bunch of casting and you will do OK. Len Thompson Orange and white with a 1/0 weedless single hook used to be a killer for them in the weeds. West side by the old rail road causeway. Good Luck and Good Fishin'Russ"
