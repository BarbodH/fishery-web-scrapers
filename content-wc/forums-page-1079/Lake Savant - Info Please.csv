507479,GetTheNet,2000-03-28 08:04:00,29,Going to Lake Savant the last week of June. Any input would be great. Hope to catch northerns of size and lake trout for sport and walleyes for a few shore lunches. It is a big lake and we will be in a small boat. Any information that can get us started on a patern for these species would be great. Staying at Cliff and Roma's (sp?).Thanks in advance.RB

They were very friendly, and very helpful. However, the lake is full of reafs, and not marked as usual. I got a prop, and was charged 100$ to replace it. Also the bait was big bucks. We were also charged for the gas. I have been on numerous canadian trips and have never been nickle and dimed so much. It is however a beautiful lake. It did rain all the time we were there and the wind blew constantly. The lakers weren't up shallow yet, and the big part of the lake was too rough to fish in. The walley's were slow but we did catch all we wanted. The Northerns were all but non existant. 4 lbs. the biggest. We caught all our walleye's on windswept points, or in 40' of water. But do make sure that they point out to you on a map all the reefs. They know where they are. I would like to fish that lake again in the sprin. Great luck to you."
