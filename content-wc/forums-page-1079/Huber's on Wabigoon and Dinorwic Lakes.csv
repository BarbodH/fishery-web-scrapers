506996,Guest,2000-02-04 23:04:00,0,"Ineed your help guys!! Finally got my wife to agree to spend the second week of our family vacation in Canada. (The first week we'll spend at Gull Lake in the Brainerd area of MN.) I'd like for this not to be our last trip to Canada so I'm seeking a place that won't offend her well-developed female sensibilities. Basically this means the cabins need to be very clean, well kept and completely mildew free; and the resort staff reasonable friendly and courteous. I'd also like the kids (they're 7 & 11 and don't do early morning or late evening fishing very well and generally like to spend more tme playing with their tackle than fishing) to be able to tie into a few decent walleye and hopefully have a few other kids to hang with. We'd be up there the second week of August. Talked to Huber's Lone Pine Lodge last week at a Chicago sports show and they seem to fit the bill pretty well. It looks like they have a great restaurant there as well. Is anybody here familiar with Huber's in particular or Wabigoon and Dinorwic Lakes in general? Would you recommend it? Or perhaps recommend a better or similar resort in that general area of Ontario. Any guidance here would be greatly appreciated!!Regards,Dennis"

But, as with most of the Canadian Resorts they are geared to guys fishing. Kids usually don't figure into their buisness plans.Have you ever thought about houseboating. It's a great family vacation. The boats are totally modern and have all the amenities. The kids have a great time swimming and hiking and just goofing off. Campfires everynight. You boat right to the fishing spots. You can drag your own boat along or one will be furninshed. The resort gives you all the instructions, maps, and you have radio contact with the base should any problems arise. There are resorts in MN and Ontario who rent houseboats such as in Voyagures National Park, MN. Rainy Lake and Lake of the Woods. If you want more info email me. TGGDo a search on Voyagures National Park Resorts /Ash Trail & Rainy Lake"
506998,Guest,2000-02-18 17:54:00,0,"TGG,Thanks for the info on Huber's. That's pretty much what I wanted to know. Also we've talked about renting houseboat many times....We'r getting close!!Thanks,Dennis"

507000,Guest,2000-02-20 18:46:00,0,"Thanks for the info, Umpie!! We won't be going up there until the beginning of August. Maybe see you out on the lake another year. By the by, what part of Wisconsin so you guide out of?Regards,Dennis"
507001,Guest,2000-03-03 13:58:00,0,"I have stayed there 4 times and was very pleased with service and fishing. Walter is very service oriented and has a fantastic german supper club.The resort is medium in the price range. When we went there we brought our own boats and fished surrounding lakes. Dryden is very close and has everyhting you may need. The resort is not remote by any means, civilization is knocking on your doorstep. this would not fit the bill as a wilderness retreat. but you could golf,eat at mcdonald's or shop at walmart if you liked. I caught my largest pike ever on a surrounding lake 46"" and 29 lbs. Walter and his family are great people and I'm sure you will have a wonderful time."
507002,Guest,2000-03-05 08:52:00,0,"Pikemaster,Thanks for all the positive info on Huber's, that was pretty much the impression I got from talking to them at the Chicago fishing show. However since Roger Osborne posted that the Wabigoon River is seriously polluted with sewage I've been wondering about the water quality of Lake Wabigoon and Lake Dinorwic because the Wabigoon River flows into southeast end of Lake Dinorwic. Do you have any info on this? I know you posted that you fished the lakes surrounding Huber's but it sounded like you avoided Lakes Wabigoon and Dinorwic. As I'm bringing the family and my kids love to swim as well as eat walleye I'm very concerned about this issue. I realize I'm probably overreacting but this concerns my family's health. Regards,Dennis"
507003,Guest,2000-03-06 20:09:00,0,the water runs out of the lake .don;t worry the water is alot cleaner there than here . the water is very clean .good fishing umpie
507004,Guest,2000-03-25 09:35:00,0,Never fished Wabigoon but I have been to their GREAT restaurant. I spend the summers nearby and make several visits each year. The Camp looks very clean. Good Luck
