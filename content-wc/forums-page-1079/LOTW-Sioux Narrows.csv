The group I go with, has for the last twelve years, rented houseboats at Lake Of The Woods Houseboats out of Reed Narrows which is three miles north. If you go north of Rendezvous Point there is a lot of good fishing. Try Yellowgirl Bay around the rock pile on the north side of the channel at the west end or around the small islands on the north side. Blueberry inlet is another good area. Check with the lodge operator. He can let you know which spots have been hot for walleyes, bass etc. WATCH THE CHARTS!!! All the little crosses are rocks and with 14,000 islands its easy to get lost!"

I have guided for Motlong's before as well as Totem Lodge and White Birch, but now I run my own service. Believe it or not July is a great time to come up to LOTW's all the fish are on the reefs by then. If you'd like a guide please email me or call me @807 274 4584 Thank you."
