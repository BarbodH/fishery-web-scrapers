506949,Guest,2000-02-01 11:49:00,0,Will be going to Minaki June 10 and am wondering if anyone has suggestions or tips. Always made our Canada trip in August and don't know how different the fishing will be. Have been there before and if anyone can turn us on to a few spots for smallies and walleyes it would be greatly appreciated.

Jesus Christ I swear there's at least a million different camps all along the Winnipeg river...where are you going? Maybe I could suggest a few outfitters for you that sounded good to me. What species are you after the most? Let me know what you hear and I'll do the same...Might want to check this site out www.ontariossunsetcountry.caand head for Minaki.Late-Tom Hudson"
506952,Guest,2000-02-08 14:50:00,0,"Hi Mark! Is this your first time to Minaki? If so I might suggest some spots that have produced well for me in July and August. Blueberry Island, Bud's Buoy, Burnt Island and Green Island and Rock Pileall in Big Sand (or on way to it). Also under the Railroad Bridge should be good that time of year.Dale"
