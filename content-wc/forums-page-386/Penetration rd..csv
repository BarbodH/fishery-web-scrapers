1620649,tpr39,2013-03-31 12:24:00,13,I spoke with Adrian about 3 weeks ago. He says the new road from Senneterre is finished and in great shape (as of the end of last fall). He said the new road starts about 10 miles down the penetration road and comes out a few miles south of Martin's. We will talk to Adrian before we leave 5/23 to see how the road is. Supposed to be 90 miles from Senneterre about 50% less gravel road then Parent.

1624953,Guest,2013-04-01 17:13:00,0,"TPR39 Thanks we have heard the same thing. The rd octane is talking about starts in the la verendre park and goes straight to Clova never heard anything good about it. The other rd goes east north east around to parent then clova then back north to the gouin 170 miles of gravel. The penetration rd starts in sennetere and is 115mi. to Lehibou. If what Adrian says is correct and the upper end is as good as the lower end it will be the way to go for us,we used to make it to adrians in 4hr not pushing it. we should beback to at least that maybe better. Thanks for the info Tpr39."
1613777,kyle870,2013-03-29 07:37:00,26,Any info on the road from senetere to the gouin? The upper reaches of it were supposed to be rebuilt Any knowledge of where it comes out on the north end? It was supposed to be near camp Martin. Thanks.
1614009,Freytown,2013-03-29 08:16:00,770,"Kyle, I used that road once...no more for me. The last 20-30 miles was brutal. I always go thru Parent, this is about 70 miles shorter. If it is real dry it can get dusty though. I like to run it at night, the dew keeps the dust in check. BTW, the outfitters use the Parent road & recommend it too. And there is much more traffic just in case something goes wrong."
1614681,Guest,2013-03-29 10:31:00,0,"Freytown, We gave up on the penetration rd 2 yrs ago been going thru parent .We saw them building this road last yr.Adrian at le hibou said it would be completed this yr, rebuilt the last 30 miles on the northeast end supposedly for a gold mine and logging. Seneterre works out logisticaly for us way better just wondered if anyone has actually seen the rd then i will be a believer ha ha.Last time we went that way we averaged 10mph last 30 miles beat our boats to a salve. Need absolute proof before we go that way again.Do you remember Mc.Q he would know. Thanks for the reply"
1614713,Freytown,2013-03-29 10:50:00,770,"I haven't been to Hibou in three years, I have been fishing Baie du Sud recently. Adrian told me last I was there that the road being built was for uranium mining. I'm pretty sure it will go north to Chapais not Senneterre. If you are going to Hibou call or email them as I am sure they will get back to you"
1615745,octanehi5,2013-03-29 16:41:00,1104,The road to Parent and Clova are as bad as I would like to take a vehical on. Any worse than that and you are just looking for trouble.Flying in is the way to go
1615985,Freytown,2013-03-29 18:12:00,770,"Octane, you apparently never drove a bad dirt road if you think these roads are bad. Maintaining 40-55 mph on these roads is normal, it doesn't get any better any where on Planet Earth.BTW, Air Tamarac's main plane base is in Clova where I am sure most people drive to Clova when using them. I go this route every year and have never had a problem and I don't know anyone who has had any problems."
1617257,McQ,2013-03-30 07:40:00,615,"Hey everybody, I'm still around just not actively posting. Been fighting cancer for the last year and the chemo keeps me from doing most things I enjoy.To answer your questions regarding accessing the Gouin Reservoir the Parent road is by far the best option to get to most of the outfitters. All roads in the area are maintained by the logging companies, if no activity in an area upkeep can be real spotty. Where the Parent access differs is that Hydro Quebec has a major operation between Parent & Clova so the reliability factor goes up.The Clova Rd & Separation have not been attended to in any major way for thirty years plus resulting in bad spots over most of their length.i recommend the Parent access for obvious reasons - use any other route at a high level of apprehension.ps: there is a moratorium on uranium mining - would be surprised if any road improvements were scheduled."
1617409,octanehi5,2013-03-30 08:47:00,1104,If I have to drive a road in worse condition than the road to Parent and Clova. I will make araingements to fly in from somewere better. the beating you give your vehical is just not worth it
1617785,fosterthedog,2013-03-30 10:44:00,51,"I drive this road twice a year, a fly in early and take the boat the second trip. It can be washboarded and a few bigger stones in the road here or there, I go about 45mph seems to let the shocks work the washboarded stretches and look for the big stones the graders pop up. I do drive a F250 but wouldnt hesitate to take a car as long as I had a full size spare. This is a highway compared to some roads. I cant see spending the $500-$1000 to fly in off the main road. Takes me 4 hrs from the turn off above Mont St Michel to Clova, 3 1/2 to where I turn to go to Gouin."
1619554,octanehi5,2013-03-31 06:38:00,1104,"I have used air Tam's base in LaTuge,Its paved road all the way. It is more money,adds about $400 to your trip.I make Clova in 3 1/2 hrs from the main road, 45 mph is a good speed for that road. If you do it in less time than that you really beat up your vehical.On our trips we like to allow plenty of time to get to were your going.Always get there the day before spend the night and fly out fresh in the morning"
