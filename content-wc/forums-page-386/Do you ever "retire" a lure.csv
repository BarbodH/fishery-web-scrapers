1645897,stevensinks,2013-04-07 15:50:00,330,The first year I took my wife to Red Lake she fished all week with one lure. She caught lots of fish and she caught big fish. Now she wont use that lure because she is afraid she will loose it.
1540137,Lovetofish,2013-02-19 11:27:00,458,I too have a couple Cleo spoons with the dancing girl hanging on the map of NWO in my room. They don't make them like this anymore. My favorite color is orange/gold and blue/silver.
1540147,MrSimon,2013-02-19 11:45:00,922,"Its funny that in every thread like this, an orange Little Cleo is almost always mentioned at least a few times. My 1/3 oz. orange/silver Little Cleo with the dancing girl has caught me about 1,000 fish. I'm not exaggerating one bit. I used it for about 8 seasons and caught between 100 and 200 fish on it per season. Heck, maybe even more. I think I've kept it so long because I always fish it on a leader (no biteoffs) and it runs pretty shallow (no snags). I think I've had a few days where I caught 40 or 50 pike in one day on this little spoon. Its retired now. Obviously I have about a dozen replacement lures that look just like the retired one .... but the new ones don't have the dancing lady and they don't seem to catch as many fish."
1540209,Lovetofish,2013-02-19 13:21:00,458,I've seen the Cleo catch 100 fish in a day before.

1541594,Bill Krejca,2013-02-22 08:02:00,6107,"Several that are especially memorable: - A battle scarred bluegill finish Heddon Pumpkinseed Spook that resulted in a non-hooked pike jumping into the front of the boat and hitting me in the chest, causing me to end up on the floor, along with the fish. - A very used wooden perch finish Heddon Lucky 13, which I found on the shore and proceeded to catch 11 pike on before I got out of the bay. The bait over the years accounted for many pike, bass, and muskie, before I retired it. Both of these memories happened on LOW, in the 1950's. I also have a bunch of other lures which I have found over the years, each with it's own story. Bill Krejca"
1541600,MrSimon,2013-02-22 08:10:00,922,The 1950's eh? I learned about the 50's in history class .... seemed like a good era

1541776,wtw_fisherman,2013-02-22 12:57:00,13,"I have retired a few. I have a few good days when I have caught what seems like 50 fish on a jig or shad rap without a northern biting it off(no leader) or bottom. I wear a Boony hat when fishing, I take the jig off and hook it into the band meant for cigarettes. Most are beat up anyway, a few plugs hang there too."

1538405,2746,2013-02-15 13:34:00,3206,We used to hike back to a Lake Trout lake off of Eagle Lake on our spring trips. Caught more lake trout on a orange/silver Little Cleo than I can count or even remember. It would out catch 4:1 any other color. It's been several years since we've been there but your post brought back memories.
1538420,vteye,2013-02-15 13:54:00,812,I lost a uncle who had some old battle scar'd pike lures and will never see them again. Great idea to put one aside and make family lore..
1538466,3M TA3,2013-02-15 15:32:00,2846,"This is exactly what my Dad's Dad started and we have quite a collection with many stories. I suspect that some of these lures would otherwise be in a collectors box too, but lacking some really great fish stories. I'll be 60 this year, so some of these are really really old."
1538608,reconssd,2013-02-15 20:52:00,147,"I have retired two Grandma's six inch perch pattern lures. So many pike hit these lures that I swear the pike literally knocked the action out of the lures. So, if you want a lure that will put northern pike in the boat, try a perch pattern grandma bait."
1538732,5thsuit,2013-02-16 08:03:00,54,"Never. Worst retirement stuck to the bottom, best retirement broke off in the mouth of a large fish which will continue to grow every time I tell the story."
1539119,Cash,2013-02-17 08:23:00,73,I haven't but my brother has. Several years ago I fished for a week on Minnetaki with my 3 brothers. We had a good week and caught lots of fish. One of my brothers particularly enjoys casting for northerns. Early in the trip he put on an orange and black Rapala knock-off. It had some bb's in the body and rattled. He proceeded to catch dozens of fish with that lure. He snagged it up a few times and managed to retrieve it. Treble hooks got bent and he replaced them. It had teeth marks and scratches all over it. He never changed lures all week. Fast forward about 2 years. I went to my brothers house after he had remodeled his man cave. Lots of hunting and fishing stuff. Hanging from the mirror in the bathroom was that orange and black lure.
1539495,MrSimon,2013-02-18 07:02:00,922,"LoL! I'm so glad others do this too! When I pick up one of my retired lures, I actually feel a sense of reverence. I show them to my kids like they are some ancient artifact and they get all big eyed and impressed. Part of me wonders if I'll ever bring one out of retirement for some reason or another .... maybe the when my kids are old enough to go on their first trip to Canada."
1539588,pike50plus,2013-02-18 10:32:00,584,"Caught a 43"" pike with no leader on 6lb line with a yellow 1/8 oz jig with a 3"" berkley curley tail grub, six pound line and no leader. After what seemed like a half hour, maybe 10 minutes I got it near the side and hand landed it , as I lifted the fish out the line broke about 6-8 inches about the jig, so I keep it in a zip-lock bag as a trophy. I was in an inflatable boat on a bush trip in Quebec, Lac Kamachiwan?"
1539857,John N,2013-02-18 19:59:00,362,"Sure do. Been going to Canada with a group of guys for sixteen years. Our group has ranged from 4-12, usually 8 or so. Just for fun, we have a little skin game on the biggest northern and walleye each day, and for the week. On our second year up there, one of the guys brought some ""team baits"" for everyone. That year, they were a Daredevil with the Canadian Maple Leaf pattern. The big northern and walleye for the week on the team bait also earned a skin. Of course, we use other spoons as well, and usually jigs for walleyes. Every year since, we've had a ""team bait"" for everyone, and they've been different every year. Sometimes big Cabela's spoons, sometimes Williams Wablers (we've had red and white, five of diamonds, gold with green flash, silver with blue flash, etc.), Mepps Cyclops, Williams Trophy, Red Eye Wiggler Five of Diamonds, and so on. Every year I've retired my ""Team Bait"" for the year, and they're all hanging in my shop near the fishing stuff. It's a fun reminder of all those years. And for the baits that have been real good? I buy another just like 'em to keep in service. Yep, good memories. John"
1539987,Mike Kansas,2013-02-19 07:20:00,1463,"I had posted earlier that I retired two lures that are in the mouths of the Replicas that the wife and I caught. I also have about 300 antique lures that are retired and displayed in our ""Walleye Room"" in glass cases and hanging on fishnet drapes. Along with a lot of fishing vintage signs and antique Rods & Reels that adorne the walls. Mike Kansas"
1537801,MrSimon,2013-02-14 13:44:00,922,"I have two lures that I've ""retired"". One is a five of diamonds spoon that I've had for 20 years. I caught my biggest pike ever on it and lots of others. The second lure is an original Little Cleo spoon in orange/silver. Its got the naked dancing girl on the back. That little spoon has caught me more fish than any other lure I've ever used. It always seems to produce and I have more confidence in that lure than anything else. Both of these lures are so special to me that I just can't risk losing them. I've taken them out of circulation and they will never see water again. I even bought them a special lure box and it sits on a shelf at home. Do you guys ever retire a lure that has been special to you?"

The reason it is semi retired is I am going to take it to the Walleye For Warrior event this year and give it to 1 Veteran or if Nels will Auction/raffle it off to help one Veteran out that is in need I will do that also. I also have a sticker signed for one person."
1537995,eyeman_1,2013-02-14 18:51:00,690,I've retired a few.... A orange crawfish shad rap that I was fishing last year on LOTW and it caught the biggest musky I've caught to date. An original Thunder Stick AJ that caught my first 10+# eye on Lake Erie. It's caught so many fish that I just can't bear to loose it now. A black/white daredevil that I used for a week long trip to the NWT that has most of the paint eaten off of it from all the pike and lake trout. I hope there will be others down the road.

I inherited the bait when Gramps died, because he always let me use it when teaching me how to fish for bass as a kid. The lure has a split outer casing along the top after he baked it in the oven for some reason. I carried the lure with all my other tackle in Gramps' memory but never used it. But after my tackle was stolen, and miraculously recovered by the police, I decided it was time to put my ""heirloom"" in a safe place."
