We've had luck at the clay banks in McKenzie Bay and Scout Lake. Have seen a number of boats heading south, where are they going? The lodge we stayed at last year had 25hp motors so it limited our range. This year we'll have 50's and staying closer to the main lake. I'll share our results when we return. Counting the days"
