1613889,kayakmatt,2013-03-29 07:56:00,105,"I asked a camp owner if we did not return in the evening ...would you look for us, and how would you find us? He said ""we will find ya"". 50,000 acres of water, several portage lakes! I'm thinking no way we could be found in an out of the way area of a huge remote lake with hundreds of islands, coves, bays, etc. have any of you spent the night on the water or shore after getting lost or mechanical breakdown? Did the lodge owner send a search party at dark? Alway wonder and worry when it is just my wife and I 15 miles from the lodge. Had others tell me they made themselves at home in a remote cabin instead of freezing or getting soaked or eaten alive by bugs. Any stories?"
1613921,MrSimon,2013-03-29 08:06:00,922,"I haven't had to spend the night, but we talk a lot about what we would do if it happened. The best thing is to BE PREPARED! Some food, dry clothes, rope, lighter etc etc - basic stuff to spend the night in the bush. Also, its your responsibility to make yourself visible if you need rescued. Get to a main lake point and start a smokey fire. I also wouldn't expect a lodge owner to come looking for me at dark .... so I'd expect to spend the night, get visible, and start looking for the owner in the morning."
1614041,bcmss396,2013-03-29 08:20:00,296,"I've never had to spend the night in the bush, but preparedness is key.- Be sure that you tell someone the area you plan to fish. At least they will know where to start looking.- Have food, water, matches, rain gear, first aid kit, etc... packed with you on each trip.- Make sure that you have adequate fuel and battery charge before you head out each day.- If you have a kicker and/or electric trolling motor, be sure they work.- At a minimum have a map and compass on board. If you have a GPS mark your trail and waypoint your camp.- Most boats 16' and larger are required to carry signalling devices (flares, horn, mirror, etc...). Be sure yours are current. If you follow these guidelines, even if you have to spend a night in the bush you ought to be alright.Blair"
1614073,wallydave,2013-03-29 08:24:00,2151,"my next trip will be my wife and I, even though we are going to Goose Bay, a place I have fished out of for many years, this is the first trip for the both of us without a second or third boat. I image there will be a few trips I will be the only person in the boat.I have a set of walkies, for communication when I am out alone, I plan on telling Andrea where we are going when its just the two of us heading out, better safe than sorry!"
1614977,zeebee,2013-03-29 12:14:00,1144,"A couple of years ago while fishing with my two sons on a fly-in I had a late evening motor failure while several miles from the lodge. It was a sunny but windy evening and we were trolling along the windward side parallel to a rocky shoreline. The motor just quit. Given the strength of the wind and our proximity to the shoreline I only had a few seconds to attempt to restart the motor before being forced to tilt it out of the water and avoid prop damage from the large boulders. Grabbing paddles we managed to avoid the rocks and in a matter of seconds we were pushed up on the shore. Coulda been worse... as I spanned the shoreline I realized we had lucked out, landing on the only 30' span of sand shoreline for as far as I could see. Had it been anywhere else, we would of been pushed up against rocks and a treeline that extended right to the waters edge. I realized I had won the forced beached lottery. We were able to land and although the sand only extended a few few before the treeline, it afforded us some mobility. There was no way I could push the boat back into the water as the wind was howling. I had a lighter, some granola bars and that was it. Should mention it was mid August and there was only one other group in camp so my prospect of being ""rescued"" quickly were pretty minute. Kids were looking at me with that ""OK now what"" stare. First task..firewood. There was plenty available and in no time we had a nice pile assembled. Although I knew I was spreading false hope , I assured my sons we would be found within a couple of hours to which my son replied ""then why do we have enuff wood for the whole night?""....the reality of the situation started to sink into them at that point. It was getting dark now and the wind was dying down so I lit the fire andf we pulled the seats out of the boat and placed them around the fire, settling in for who knew how long. I expected overnight. As the night enveloped us, the stars came out in with a brightness and detail I had never seen before. It was a moonless, cloudness night and the universe was absolutely magnificient. As if for our entertainment and awe, the skies provided us with an incredible meteorite shower. You cant buy a ticket to a more spectular event. The night was so clear we able to disern satelites as they crawled across the night sky. For the nextfew hours the boys (who are incidentaly in their late teens) talked about girlfriends, life experiences, school, work, politics, religion and a myriad of whatever came to our mind. Everyone was calm and immersed in the beauty and serenity of the event. I know I felt that special father/son bond and I think my kids too were caught up in it despite the circumstance we were in. At about midnite, we thought we heard the distant sound of an outboard. Sure enough, around the point a strong beam broke the darkness and a shout broke the silence. We wouldnt be spending the night afterall. Now, I need to tell a little bit about our ""rescuer"". Jim Booi is a 3rd genartion lodge owner and a bushman extrodinare. He's a bit of a legend around the Red Lake area. The fellow fillets fish using a 20"" bowie knife which is always hanging around his waist. I tell you there is not a bone in the flesh or a morsel of flesh left on the bones when hes done. To boot he can do 4 fillets in the time it takes me to do one and believe me I use to guide as a teenager and have filleted thousands of fish. If the ""wilderness"" was ever to incarnate a repesentative of itself...it would be Jim Booi. Anyways, Jim somehow managed to navigate thru the rocks in pitch black as if hes done it every day of his life.Hes wearing a calf length australian style oil coat and his trademark canvas bush cap. The knife is of course hanging from its place. A rather large duffel bag, I learned later, contained all the emergency paraphanlia and 1st aid stuff he might need. He has it stored at the door of the boathouse ready to go.The tow in was about 45 minutes and again we were able to relax and take in the the incredible light show the universe was showcasing as if only for us. Didnt want it to end and I suspect my sons felt the same.Now, Im not a religous fellow in the common sense of the term, but the next morning, coffee in hand I looked into the sky, smiled and winked.About that motor.....it was only a loose hose at the tank....guess i had stepped on it and it came free. Normally I woulda found the issue but given the wind and our quick encounter with the shoreline it wasnt to be. Oh well no regrets at all."

1615873,dutchboy,2013-03-29 17:28:00,5717,"I carry a zip lock freezer bag in the boat at all times. It has dry lathe, dry newspaper, matches in it. I'm generally always cold so I always have some extra cloths in the boat also. I don't night fish but you never know when a storm will blow up or you have a mechanical failure."
1615945,JayM5209,2013-03-29 17:57:00,1050,"zeebee and Pikeslayer8, thanks for sharing your stories! They are great . . . and sure are the experiences that make for lifetime memories.After 34 yrs. of NW Ontario trips I've never been stranded yet, but one night many years ago six of us were on a far lake in three camp boats and just at dark two of the group capsized their boat. Others were close enough to pull them out but all their tackle, rods, etc., were lost. After we settled down a bit and got the two ""swimmers"" in dry jackets and righted their boat, we discovered that my old 15 hp Mariner was the only engine that would run. In the cold and dark I pulled two other boats, each with two passengers and gear, across the lake, 40 mins. down a creek, 30 mins. across another lake, and then almost an hour down another creek to reach the lake our camp was on. We've been telling stories about that event for 30 years.In all those years the camp owner/operator has gone out in the dark twice (when I was in camp) to find people who failed to return at dark. Once it was due to a vehicle problem at a drive-to cache lake. The other time was the result of an afternoon wind storm that felled trees across a logging road to a cache lake. The stranded fishermen had no tools to remove the blockages.As others have said, the key is being prepared. The dry bag with my rain gear and a sweatshirt that is always with me in any boat I'm in also has two Bic lighters, two ""space blankets,"" several candle stubs (to help with fire starting), a whistle, signal mirror, compass, small compact folding saw, and a small LED flashlight. A small 14"" duffel bag that always stays in my own boat has that stuff plus a 12' x 12' plastic drop cloth and a 50' roll of 3/16"" rope, and a $12 lantern (2 D cells) with a strobe setting that I picked up somewhere in the camping section. If stranded, I won't eat too well, but I'll have fire and shelter from the wind and rain. Also, when I head north to bush country my truck always is equipped with a shovel, axe, bow saw, several recovery straps, bottle jack, 12 v. tire inflater, and a manual winch.zeebee, I really liked your inclusion of Jim Booi and his big Bowie knife. A long time ago, when I was young and doing a bit of canoeing, an old timer gave me his paddler's safety lecture. To this day, if I am in a watercraft of any kind, I have a sheath knife on my belt. Tip a canoe or get thrown from a boat and find an arm or foot snared in a line or a PFD strap hung on an underwater snag and I don't want to try digging a pocket knife out of my pocket, let alone try to open it. Incidentally, the knife that's always on my belt is one I bought 61 years ago, back when as an eleven year old I was getting ready for my 1st week at summer camp. Don't know why my naive mind thought I needed a big man knife, but I still use it regularly."
1615977,fishanytime,2013-03-29 18:12:00,63,"I have had to limp in a few times, have a trolling motor and electric in addition to the main motor. We fish as far away from camp as 25 to 30 miles on ocasion but always have a map, gps the last 10 or more years and try to pay close attention if fishing with others. I never go very far in strange water without pulling out the map even with today's modern gps units. We did have two friends along one year, left them at an area connecting two main lakes and told them we would be back in an hour. We checked back and they were no where to be found. We spent the afternoon looking for them in every direction for several miles. We knew they had a map and one guy had been on the lake several times before so we headed in about 4 pm thinking they might have got past us and be back at the lodge about 10 miles from where we left them. They were not at the lodge so we waited, ate dinner, waited some more and finually went looking for them about an hour before dark. At dark we noticed a boat headed our way, turned out to be the warden who had come accross our friends more than 10 miles from where we left them. It had rained but they had found shelter from the rain. The warden gave them directions to get back to camp but after watching them take off he figured they would have to be led in and he was nice enough to lead them all the way back to camp. They were rattled and after a few shots and beers we asked why the guy who had been on the lake didn't use his map to get in. Buoys have numbers on them on LOW's but they couldn't find the numbered buoy on the map. I haven't left any friend since at a spot very long if they are not very familiar with the lake and go to great lengths to point out buoy's and where they are on a map. Fishanytime"
1616113,kayakmatt,2013-03-29 18:54:00,105,"Great story Zeebee! Thanks for all the responses. I will pack a few more safety items next time. I do take a dry bag each day with some emergency neccessities, but it is not big enough to include all the items in these responses to this thread. I like the sheet of plastic idea. That would be a huge benefit if stranded and raining. I'd like to get a waterproof duffle style dry bag with a shoulder strap to carry all the emergenct items.Has anyone heard of making themselves at home in a remote cabin in an emergency or desperate situation? I read a post somewhere where the stranded fisherman broke in, but left a note and some money for the owner!!?? ...it would have to be alot of money. On a remote cabin, the hassle factor of a repair would be much greater than most any amount of money that was left!"
1616169,Blue Lk,2013-03-29 19:26:00,269,"Lots of great advice in this thread,but I have noticed that nobody has mentioned including bug dope.The blackflies & mosquitoes can make a nite in the bush a living h#ll."
1616369,Guest,2013-03-29 20:40:00,0,OK ...story.....Years ago I went on a fishing trip with 3 accountants. Not to knock the profession but.. at the end of the night the other boat which accommodated two of the number crunchers were unsure of the way home. Follow our wake we exclaimed...they did and landed on a island as their boat was slower and the wake widened the further we went.....true story. They were still po'd the next morning thankfully no worse for the ordeal.

1622017,scar,2013-03-31 20:17:00,196,"Fished at Boois 9 years in a row from 1995-2003. We bought our own place on Minnitaki in 2004. Man I miss that lake and Jim and his wife Traci - two of the nicest people I have ever met and fishing in Canada for over 30 years. I have never been on a lake better then Trout Lake or have stayed with such wonderful owners as the Boois. Below is a link of a video showing Jim Booi with his hat, coat and booy knife cleaning walleyes. Jim is definitely a legend!"
1622369,zeebee,2013-03-31 22:33:00,1144,"Hey Scar......goin back for my 3rd year this August. This time two weeks with one being solo. Ive done over 30 flyins to various lake and I think Ive made this my permanent choice. Tiss indeed a great lake. Last two years, in addition to countless eyes, have produced a 33 lbs laker and 47"" NP. Lake as you know is huge and accomodations 1st class. The Booi's are still ""salt of the earth"" but think Traci would like Jim to be thinking about retirement. Dunno, cant see him driving in a mini van and playin bridge. They built a place on vancouver island so maybe. Minnitaki is also a great watershed...did my guiding there in the late 70's.Sorry for hijackin thread."
1615345,Pikeslayer8,2013-03-29 14:15:00,1460,"Heckofa great story there Zeebee! We had an incident several years ago which involved my brother and nephew. They were headed back to camp a couple miles out and hit a submerged reef knocking out their lower unit and drifted onto an island. Well, this was the first year that my wife sent the walkie talkies and we weren't very good with keeping them on, but as it were, my brother gets on his calling for help. My oldest son who was fishing with my brother in law that day and were the first back to camp, answered back. He said that he could just barely make out my brother. My brother said ""Brett, go get Pat, we have engine troubles and are stranded"". Brett goes to tell Pat that he is wanted on the walkie talkie. Pat, who is busy filleting fish at the time tells Brett "" tell em I'm busy"" so Brett calls back Bob and says ""Pat is busy now, may I take a message"". Ole Bob just about came unglued and was quite a bit more forceful in getting my son to cooperate. We got them in just before it was too dark but we do love to tell the story of how Pat was too busy to rescue his own son. The spot that they were fishing has a big island that you have to get by, to get there and now we always traverse the other side of it . Since we are usually a group of 8 using 4 boats, we always go out in pairs if we fish on different parts of the lake and try to communicate with the walkie talkie if we need to."

1615529,Pooch,2013-03-29 15:23:00,4619,When it's just my wife and myself I always leave a note on the table in the cabin telling where I plan to fish that day. The only problem being sometimes the wind changes and we don't fish where the note said we would be. So we try to give several general areas that we should be near. At least it's a starting point if we do have trouble.Even when we are fishing with a group we tell each other where we will be as we don't fish in pairs or follow each other around like some groups.Just a little common sense goes a really long way.Pooch
1615657,Ogoki,2013-03-29 15:59:00,291,"I have been on 36 fly-in trips and my wife has been on 26 of those with me .We like to fish large lakes and explore . To help cover the bases in event of motor failure I carry a small two man tent in a dry bag . I also have a small York pack ( waterproof heavy duty plastic box that we use on canoe trips) that I keep in the boat all week along with the tent that is in the dry bag. In the York pack I have two very small Coleman stoves , two aluminum skillets , cooking utinsels ,cooking oil,matches, fire starters, couple cans of pork and beans , couple cans of fruit ,some peanuts ,trail mix etc .With the above we can get out of the elements and also.be able to eat . If we stop for shore lunch then we replace anything we use before going out the next day. ..............Just a little piece of mind and the extras in the boat have became a way of life for us."

One evening he wanted to go cast for some pike so we did for a few hours, when we were done he went to start the boat up and no worky. We spent the night on shore and were sure someone would spot us the next day but it didn't happen, we were up there so early there really was no boat traffic. I ended up paddling the boat back to the island, this took about 10 hours, not fun."
