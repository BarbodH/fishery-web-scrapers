1627034,wallydave,2013-04-02 08:35:00,2151,"Larry, nice catch! Ever since I bought a Pfleuger ultra-lite I have rigged it with Braid, and I have always caught my biggest pike on that rig! Thats what I call fun!"

1619610,wallydave,2013-03-31 07:07:00,2151,"This August I will be fishing the west end of Red Lake. I have plenty of questions about this area, my first question is what is the water clearity like? I have mostly fished the NW section of Lac Seul, stained waters there, and camo braids work well. So what fishing lines work well on Red Lake? Thanks!"
1622889,Mondo,2013-04-01 08:06:00,61,"Wallydave, I've fished Red Lake many years and very familiar with the West end. Assume you'll be at Black Bears? You'll find the water clarity to be consistent with a typical shield lake - tea stained. I've fished Lead core, fireline, Trilein XL, and PowerPro. My favorite is the old XL - either green or clear. #6 is my line weight, too. Not sure if the fish really care or are even spooked by the line. Mondo"
1623353,Toddskie,2013-04-01 09:54:00,11,"Wallydave,I fished the west end mid June last year and agree with Mondo line made very little differance. I used 6# XL green and Power Pro. We caught allot of walleyes on both. The Power Pro returned more jigs!! Fish that week were in 10 to 14 ft. I would think the fish would be deeper when you go?Toddskie"
1623497,wallydave,2013-04-01 10:18:00,2151,"I like using Northlands walleye camo braid. It has a white marker section, that helps with seeing the line and finding the depth too. We will be staying at Black Bear in mid-August. Thanks again!"
1623529,wallydave,2013-04-01 10:23:00,2151,"I tried some green Spiderwire braid 6#, last year, good stuff! I like to experiment with different lines each year, over the last couple of trips, the camo braids have worked well!"
1623841,Mondo,2013-04-01 11:31:00,61,"Since you like to experiment with different lines, it may be worth bringing three reels each spooled with different lines - camo, mono, braided to see which one works best for you. My bet is that by the end of the week, you will have foyund the one you're most confident with, too. Rather than swapping in/out spools, you can swap reels which may be more convenient (assuming you have the reels...) Be interested to see what you learn. Mondo"
1624057,wallydave,2013-04-01 12:45:00,2151,"Mondo, I have been moving towards braid from mono/flouro over the last couple of years.I tried the Northlands camo walleye flouro at the start of last years trip on my new eyecon med-lite fast tip, didn't like it at all. I switched to the spiderwire...wow I could feel the jigs sliding down the sides of the rocks while fishing in current! Plus the braid holds up well when a pike grabs hold of the jig and minnow!I posted about the water clearity to see if I would need some clear line, or stick with my camo/green braids for the Red Lake trip, sounds like I can stick with the braid...unless I try some new braids to compare with the first trip braids..???"
1624641,jkwildhunting,2013-04-01 15:12:00,361,"Do not worry what Mondo says. I have been told he has spent weeks up there on Red Lake was not able to catch a fish On a more serious note....Mondo is correct. Most of those lakes up there are Tea Colored. Well...Red Lake, Gull Rock and a few others I have been in that area are tea colored. On that note I use strictly 6-10lb power pro or sufix 832. I prefer the Sufix 832 in the lime green or hi vis yellow. Some say fish can see the line. BUT ever since they came out with a the Hi vis yellow I have never seen my catch decrease from using mono.Use what you are comfortable using. Do not go up there using all mono if you are a braid guy or vise versa."
1626834,Larry Mac,2013-04-02 07:50:00,530,"Hi Dave, I am also a green spiderwire fan. It has performed very well for me over the past several years. Have a great trip(s). Thank you,Larry Mac"
1626850,Mondo,2013-04-02 07:54:00,61,"WD, Sounds like your questions have been answered. I think bringing up a couple different types of braid lines may be worth trying. For me, I've used Spiderwire and love it. One thing to consider is the type of fishing you'll be doing. Aside from the traditional jig bite, I highly suggest that you try some spinner rigs tipped with crawlers. Most people in Red Lake believe that minnows are the only way to go, but I've had some excellent success with crawlers. It's almost like Russell Stover's candy to the 'eyes... Try both baits is what I'm saying. Minnows will cost you $5 a dozen (and they count 12 minnows), whereas a flat of 500 crawlers will cost $59.95 from Cabelas packed for Canada. JK is a crankbait machine who loses many rapalas snagging em on the rocks or casting them in the trees... just kidding ~ I don't do much with cranks, (probably should) AND hope to learn a lot from him. Hope this helps and you enjoy your trip."
