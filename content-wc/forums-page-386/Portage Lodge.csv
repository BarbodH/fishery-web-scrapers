That part of LOW is fairly clear and can be a little tough for walleye. Especially if you spend time in Bigstone Bay. Bit of a night bite there although I have really put the boots to the fish in the cabbage in Bigstone on a few occasions during the middle of the day. Just don't expect that to be the norm. A 20 minute boat ride will get you into consistently good walleye water, assuming you are in a reasonable boat. By good walleye water I mean the area to the south and west (Andrew Bay down through Shore Island as well as the area south of the Barrier Islands). The resort looks okay from the outside and I have not heard anything but positive comments about the operator. One the plus side, it is very close to a paved road and is close to Kenora in case you need any supplies or intend to bring family members who are interested in something other than spending 10 hrs a day in the boat."
