1607025,octanehi5,2013-03-27 16:59:00,1104,"Bugs will be minimal, Look for necked down areas with current moving through, at that time walleyes on structure in 14' or less, The pike should be shallow. drop offs near deep water. Have your outfitter tell you some of their hot spots they all have them. fish the shores that have wind blowing into them."
1607129,vteye,2013-03-27 17:18:00,812,"We found fish trolling bottom bouncers and crankbaits. Once you find them, you should be able to hammer them with jigs."

Wecatch the most fish in 3 to 8 ft. pulling worm harness's Look for the warmest water 50 plus degrees way back in the bays those warmer fish are back there for one reason the whole food chain is back therebugs, fallfish, walleyes, huuuuge pike. Have somone in the boat jerking a #14 huskey jerk rap CLOWN at times it rules. If you can get abay that has wind pounding into it making boat control an issue thats even better. BUGS, WIND, ROCKS, BEVERAGE= the best 6 days of your year. HAVE FUN"

But once you are out on the lake they won't bother you unless you are close to the shore. Get a good topo map.Ask Marc to show you where Baie Apokwotcif and the short cut to Baie de l'Est. You shouldn't need to look any more. These places are close to each other and should take about 20 min with Marc 20hp boats.Like everyone has said, stay shallow trolling cranks or jigs. Thin Fins & Hot'n Tots are a good choice. Good luck."
