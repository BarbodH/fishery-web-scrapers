1628114,bobbylfishermon,2013-04-02 13:23:00,241,"Eagle's got some great perch fishing,like everywhere you've got to find them. Ord has somegreat perch too and of course the bush lakes."
1628650,Larry Mac,2013-04-02 15:40:00,530,"Hi dukkiler, We have caught some nice Perch north of Vermilion Bay in Cedar Lake. I have attached a few pics from there. Have a Great YearThank youLarry Mac"
1629562,JayM5209,2013-04-02 18:46:00,1050,"Nah . . . . . . there aren't any perch in Ord. (Wink, wink. wink!!)If my group wants some fish to bring home we load up on the jumbo perch, almost always from the small cache lakes."
1631906,Woollybob,2013-04-03 11:48:00,158,Maybe I just fish too late (early june) but all the perch we get on Eagle are full of worms. Have tried a couple of times to keep them but cutting out worms from filets is too much work for me.
1632042,JayM5209,2013-04-03 12:21:00,1050,"Woollybob, probably more than you want to know, but here's info on the parasites commonly found in perch. The amount of infestation varies from year to year and lake to lake. http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/volunteer/janfeb06/raw.htmlI'd skip perch as sushi, but there's no harm, danger, or risk when cooking and eating."
1633146,stillangling,2013-04-03 17:32:00,149,"Hate to break the news to you but it doesn't matter what time of year that you fish for these things. Yellow grub does not disappear during the winter. My approach is pretty simple. Don't let the wife see em before I pitch them into the oil. Yellow grub is not something that you need to worry about. If it is really obvious, i will pluck them out with the knife when I am cleaning perch but that is just for optics. Otherwise, I just gobble them up (once they are cooked). It is the big juicy cysts in lake trout and whitefish that freak me out. I tend to look a little closer in those species."
1634058,Glenman12,2013-04-03 20:58:00,762,"Hi Larry..while we don't ever target the perch I know that from the amount we catch by accident, if we did target them on Cedar, we would catch a ton.."
