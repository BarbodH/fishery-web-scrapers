510771,Guest,2001-02-17 12:19:00,0,"I can't give you great details about Missanabie Lake, but Dog Lake, which is in the town of Missanabie has some excellent fishing for Walleye, Lake trout and Pike. There are several lodges on the lake, and it is also in the Chapleau Crown Game Preserve, so you can be guaranteed to see some great wildlife. In fact, I can almost guarantee at least one moose sighting on the drive in, and probably several if you're going up in the spring. If you want contacts, let me know. I'm from Missanabie and could give you any info you need....(:"

510776,Guest,2001-02-19 12:52:00,0,I have been going to Dog Lake for 12 years now. I don't feel there is a lake in ontario that compares. I have two good stories to tell you. Spring 1998This was the year of the giants. Everyfish that we brought back was over twenty inches. Nine of us that year brought back our limit. That makes 54 fish over 20 inches. What a great year!!!Spring 1999Two of my friends and I sat in bay 61 for evening fish and reeled in over 200. This is not a fish story the lake si loaded with eating size walleye.We have also taken two 16 pound lakers from this lake as well as several 40 inch pike. If you want a good vacation this is a great place to go. There is wildlife everywhere. On one trip to the gold mine last year we saw 11 different bears. If you would like any info about who we stay with or other bays that we enjoy fishing e-mail me. happy fishing JP
510777,Guest,2001-02-27 22:54:00,0,"Glad you are so happy with Dog Lake alaska. I'm from Missanabie, and I don't feel there's a better place on Earth! I hope you come back and enjoy yourselves for many more years. I also realize you pay dearly for the chance to fish up here, but please take this into consideration......If 10,000 people come to Dog in a summer, and each brings home a limit of 6 fish over 20"", that is 60,000 20"" walleye gone from Dog Lake. That's not counting the fish they keep and eat every day for the week they're here. Believe me, the lake won't keep up forever. Please practice catch and release! Tight Lines!!!Bob"
510778,Hookman,2001-03-01 09:04:00,37,"catch a few for eatin,,,put the rest back to keep the lake in fine shape..teach your kid and grandkids that fishing is NOT keeping everthing you catch..Hookman"

What some of my fellow Michiganders need to realize is that there are very few lakes that are replenished in ONT by private clubs and the DNR. Take the small guys (which are sublegal here) of 12-15"",when legal, in ONT to eat; they taste great and are bigger/thicker than jumbo perch.I have memories of my father going up to Chapleau and Wawa and bringing back lots of fish and many of them large. I still go back to these areas once a year (and do OK) but have never experienced the fishing as ""it used to be"". THE BEAUTY OF THIS AREA DESERVES BETTER !! I do believe that more of us are on the same page as the muskie guys, and putting most back; but there is more to be done. LEAVE THE BREEDERS and eat the fry. Actually I don't see the reason to bring back 4-6 small fish - SO WE DON'T.Just my opinion,I love going to Ont Canada, and as always am a conservation minded customer.LOBO"
