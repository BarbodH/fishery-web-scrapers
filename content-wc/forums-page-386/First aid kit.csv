Of course, he nor anyone else has a valid script and not willing to take the gamble of running the border with illegal script. What do the rest of you do take a satelite phone? I know my buddy is clean he has a 8 year NA/AA pin and with him alot."

Your doctor will probably have no issues with prescribing a few doses of a stronger pain reliever in that situation."
