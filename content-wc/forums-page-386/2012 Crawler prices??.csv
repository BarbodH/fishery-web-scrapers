1652689,cuamb,2013-04-09 11:11:00,203,I have used them 3 times in the last 2 years and they were good. Had a friend who got some in late August 2 years ago and he said they were a little smaller. They have been healthy and I am satisfied with them. The place I ordered from previously sent me a couple of flats that were in bad shape. I called to tell him about it and all he said was that he hoped they would be better next year.
1645329,Sportdog,2013-04-07 11:35:00,6735,"I read this thread with interest and just checked on a Canadian entry website and it said that you may not bring in minnows, leeches, or worms/nightcrawlers except if the crawlers are NOT packed in dirt. I guess that means you can bring them in if they are in a non-soil bedding material. Let us know what you find out. I'm sure others would also like to know."
1645377,tooski,2013-04-07 11:56:00,393,"A reply from a supplier- Hello, I don't believe they can, but you would need to research that. We don't ship them into Canada. Thank you Gina Customer Support Big Apple Pet Supply Still waiting to hear from Can customs. Hoping she is wrong..."
1645385,Sportdog,2013-04-07 12:06:00,6735,How many nightcrawlers are in a flat? Thanks.
1645553,ftfarms,2013-04-07 13:31:00,444,480-500 worms.
1646857,UKBDM,2013-04-07 20:18:00,178,Our group of 12 goes thru two flats (1000 +/-) in one week in June on Wabaskang. We hardly use minnows.
1648241,tv4fish,2013-04-08 09:16:00,2694,The only legal way that you can bring crawlers into Canada is if they are NOT in dirt.
1648585,cuamb,2013-04-08 10:29:00,203,"We bring in 2 flats for 8 guys for a week. We rarely use the whole crawler and have not run out. We order from Speedy Worm in Minnesota. They are little higher than Wholesale Bait Company but if you live in Minnesota, Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, or Illinois you will get next day delivery.I am sure there are times when minnows will out produce the crawlers but the 2nd week of June on Lac Seul they seem to bite on anything."
1649001,tv4fish,2013-04-08 12:05:00,2694,"Hey cuamb: How is their quality? They say they are all 6-7"" - is that true or do you get some smaller ones? Otherwise, they are w/n $1 of wholesale bait.http://shop.speedyworm.com/canadian-...awlers-p3.aspx"
1649481,tooski,2013-04-08 14:51:00,393,"For the Butterworm interests in this thread, this is what I received today from the Can Customs---""You can search for specific products in the ""Find Commodity"" field. You will be asked questions, including the origin of the product and its end use, to find out whether your commodity is approved for import by the CFIA. AIRS is accessible at:http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/imp/airse.shtml After some searching I found the list of banned insects and butterworm was not included under it's common name or its scientific name (chilecomedia moorei).. So I guess I'll take a few and try them. I will also inform the border guard to be on the safe side."
1650121,pan-man,2013-04-08 18:06:00,299,I have been buying from Speedy Worm for 4yrs (3 trips/yr) so 12 times. I would say 2 out of the 12 times the worms were a little smaller than I liked. I just save the smaller ones for panfish back in Minnesota.Just make sure you order Sunday-Wednesday from them.
1639433,tv4fish,2013-04-05 10:30:00,2694,Just in case you can't pick them and are looking for a company that DOES have nice fat crawlers (delivered to your door). I used these guys last year - very nice crawlers.http://www.wholesalebait.com/product.php?pid=143
1639969,tooski,2013-04-05 13:47:00,393,Kind of on subject here--- Anyone used butterworms for walleye? They look interesting for a couple apps like slipbobbers.
1640033,2746,2013-04-05 14:05:00,3206,Butterworms? I've had butterburgers from Culvers but.......What is a butterworm?
1640161,tooski,2013-04-05 14:51:00,393,Lol- kind of my thoughts... they were advertised on a few of the referenced crawler sites....
1642770,octanehi5,2013-04-06 12:32:00,1104,"The past 5 yrs Our group has bought our night crawlers from Wholesalebait.com good prices 500_$46, 1000- $84, always nice and heathy"
1642962,2746,2013-04-06 13:25:00,3206,"Well, it will be interesting to see one."

1643858,2746,2013-04-06 19:37:00,3206,Those Canadian walleye won't know what hit em. Delicacies from Chile! Cute maybe.....but only to their Mother.
1645225,Bad Santa,2013-04-07 11:01:00,100,"as fussy as Ca customs agents can be, maybe you should check if they are legal to enter with."
1645241,tooski,2013-04-07 11:12:00,393,I thought of that Santa and I will definitely check first. Thanks.

We always take two flats along from home, but because of some unusual logistical issues in May I may need to purchase closer to camp.Thanks..........."
1633922,ftfarms,2013-04-03 20:29:00,444,We used to take ours up with us but not no more there usually one way or the other of $12 more a flat up there than around home and the ones up there are better for the most part. The less stuff to pack and or have to worry about on the long ride up the better. We call and reserve ours to make sure they have some for us. Don't know if that helps but the last two years that's about what the price differance was. I think we could get them at home for $48 and up there for $60.
1634018,JayM5209,2013-04-03 20:49:00,1050,"ftfarms, thanks much. That's just what I needed to know."
1634026,2746,2013-04-03 20:49:00,3206,"Four Seasons, Ear Falls, 807-222-2200 is where we get ours. If your going that far North you can call ahead and reserve. Beats the heck out of hauling them all that way in ice."
1634593,UKBDM,2013-04-04 05:57:00,178,We call ahead and she has them ready for us. I think they were $55/flat last year.(807)529-6556

1635450,Fisherman Ted,2013-04-04 08:52:00,461,Sunset Baits in Kenora can't be beat. They also have leeches and a great supply of minnows. Best part is its right across from Tim Hortons.
1635906,MOfish,2013-04-04 10:56:00,39,I've never used leaches or crawlers on my previous 3 trips to Lac Suel. We've always just used minnows supplied by the lodge. Am I missing out? Should I be buying some for a mid June trip?
1636034,2746,2013-04-04 11:21:00,3206,"Not really but they are a lot cheaper than minnows if your paying the $4/dozen for them and, by mid summer, often work as well. If the minnows your lodge supplies are part of your ""package price"" then they will work as well as anything."
1636282,Walley Guide,2013-04-04 12:46:00,67,"Free from home...pick them in my yard the night of a nice spring rain, keep them in my little bait frig, pack them in fresh paper bedding before we depart. Not a big deal to pack, have a place in the vehicle cooler in case the guys at the border want to take a look. Saves spending the $50 or $60."
