1620593,epiepenburg,2013-03-31 12:16:00,365,That's what I do. Just printed the license and temp card last year. I got my outdoor card a few months after my trip.
1632098,Walley Guide,2013-04-03 12:32:00,67,I just pick them up on my way...enjoy stopping in the local bait shop for a short break. Happy Fishin' Walley
1633986,polaris-pete,2013-04-03 20:44:00,343,Did that one year and the only 2 places we found on the way up were out of the Non-Resident licenses.We had to spend another day in order to get them. Now I just get them Online. Less hassle and its in your hand as soon as you print it.I just got an email saying my card will be in the mail and expect it in 20 days.
1638681,Walley Guide,2013-04-05 07:12:00,67,"We never had an issue with the shop being out of lic. WOW! That would put a damper on things. As the years have passed, breaks are a nice addition to our trip. With the downturn of people heading up north in the past years, less traffic and prob less of a chance for there to be a run on non-res. lics. Happy Fishin' Walley"

1543249,Hump,2013-02-25 18:15:00,578,Where can I send for an outdoor card for my son? Thanks
1543258,hogridnfool,2013-02-25 18:35:00,349,I'm assuming that you're going to Ontario.....http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business...OD_091032.html
1543266,wallydave,2013-02-25 18:56:00,2151,So far going online for both the outdoors card and fishing license has been pretty painless and easy! Good luck! Good to see your bringing your son North for fishing. You will have some memories you both can treasure!
1543584,MrSimon,2013-02-26 11:14:00,922,"If he is younger than 18 (it might be 16) he doesn't have to get one .... as long as he fishes under your license. If he gets his own license, he needs the card."
1547282,team walleye,2013-03-06 07:22:00,336,"When you buy your license and outdoor card online can you pick the dates you want it to start? Just curious, I am going up in mid June and wouldn't mind getting it all online before I head up."
1547301,wallydave,2013-03-06 07:50:00,2151,"The outdoors card is good for three years, when you order your license on line you can fill out the dates of your trip.I like to get mine done ahead of time too! One less thing getting in the way of catching that first walleye! We will stop at Dutchies, for a case of Canadian beer, and maybe a few Cuban Cigars, plus my wife is making her first trip North, so I will allow some shopping therapy for her!"
1547335,Shellback,2013-03-06 08:25:00,8083,"Ontario seasonal license is Jan 1 to Dec 31. I believe the Outdoors card is the same. Of course a temp license, you pick the start date."
1619897,pikeman14,2013-03-31 08:32:00,144,Just purchased my license and outdoors card via the internet! Hopefully the canadian/U.S mail system delivers as promised.
1619961,wallydave,2013-03-31 08:52:00,2151,In the past the return time for the card has been a couple weeks. The license you can print out!
1620345,revitup,2013-03-31 10:40:00,140,"When purchasing online, you will receive an outdoor card, good from Jan 1 of this year through Dec. 31, 2015. This card comes in the mail--a credit card type of card. Your license must be printed off as you purchase it. YOU WILL NOT receive one in the mail. Your only license will be your print out from your computer and must accompany your outdoor card when you fish. You can pick what day you want your 8 day license to start."
