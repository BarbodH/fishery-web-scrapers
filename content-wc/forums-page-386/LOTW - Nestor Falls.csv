1638785,Bill Krejca,2013-04-05 07:26:00,6107,"Clayton - I suggest you order out 2 maps of LOW - 6214, Sabaskong Bay, and 6213, Whitefish Bay. These are available from the Canadian Hydrographic Service, and other sources. Locate your lodge on the Sab. map and spend some time before going on your trip somewhat learning travel routes and understanding distances. Most reefs are shown on the map, however, most are not marked out on the water, a few are. As you are probably aware, once on the water, it does not look quite the same as maybe originally pictured. Check your map often, especially before running to a new spot. GPS would be handy, but don't rely completely on it, as it can not be up occasionally. Have fun, it is a great place to spend your time, give us a complete report when you get back. Bill Krejca"
1639177,Clayton69,2013-04-05 08:57:00,80,"Stillangling  I love big, complicated water to explore!! There's nothing better in my book, and I'm really looking forward to getting up there. I will certainly be eating through some stomach lining though as it will be the inaugural trip with my new 1975 ProV. I've spent a tonne of time on lakes like Temagami and have managed to bust off a skeg, and ding a prop and that's on water I'd like to think I know very well. So I will definitely be on edge for the first little while until I can lay down a few safe' GPS routes on the Lowrance. I'll have to add your suggested locations to my fishing plan and thanks for the heads up on not needing to worry about fishing across the border one less thing to have to plan for. As for moving to another location, I thought about it, but there are two key factors that came into play cost for one but more importantly, a LOT of the lodges don't allow dogs and three weeks in the woods without my GSP, is like being on a boat without a rod impossible!! I do want to hit the north side to try the Barrier Islands area, as well as the Robertson-Cresent-Britannia-Shore area. I have lots of time, so I may just try a couple of day trips, get an early start, trailer the boat up north and launch from there. Hopefully the fishing will be hot in Sabaskong and I won't want to go anywhere else! Bill  Thanks for the info during my down time, I've already spent about 6 hours analysing satellite images, copying screen shots and plotting routes and potential fishing spots using PowerPoint. I was thinking about ordering the topo maps as there does not seem to be a lot of useful maps online, so I'll be sure to order those when I return from South Sudan in a couple of weeks. Thanks for the map numbers, it certainly makes things a lot easier. I spend about three to four weeks each year fishing on Temagami and have learned the $$ way about hidden and unmarked shoals. I'll be ordering the Hotmaps Platinum chip for my new Lowrance, and I'm hoping it will be fairly accurate. I have the lower Hotmaps version currently and have been fairly impressed with the accuracy and detail so far. A little concerning to hear that the satellite signal can drop occasionally makes those evening runs back in the dark that much more challenging! I'll be sure to provide a full report once I return from the trip hopefully with some pics of trophy sized fish to go along with it. It's one of those bucket list' type lakes that you can't help but have high expectations for.Once again everyone thanks for all the info so far I really appreciate it. It's great to be able to develop a plan of attack before you hit water...no wasted time!Clayton."
1634361,Clayton69,2013-04-04 00:13:00,80,"Good morning all. I have just booked a three week stay at LOTW Lodge located near Nestor Falls (28 Jun-17 Jul 13). I have reviewed the forum and all the info with regards to fishing seems to be closer to the Kenora area of the lake. This is my first time to the lake and I was wondering if anyone has fished the South East portion of the lake where I'll be staying. I'll mostly be focused on Walleye, but will head out occassionally for lakers, small mouth and pike/musky as well. Is the fishing good overall in that portion of the lake or is it better in the northern portion? Any tips, hints locations of places to start is appreciated thanks!Second question...what are the regulations with regards to fishing when it comes to the international border...I assume that in order to fish on the other side your would need a Minnesota licence and how does one do so? Can they be obtained on the Canadian side or do I have to boat across and pick one up at a State Park or town?"
1634377,muskyman73,2013-04-04 03:27:00,402,"If you can make the run to Stony, or even Blueberry island, you will be doing fine. Our group use to stay in Nestor Falls and make the run to Stony portage every day when we stayed there. Stony portage is excellent fishing due to it's remote location and amount of reefs. I highly recommend it. Especially the time of year that you are going. You will run across more water that is not fished as heavily as well. I think if you want lake trout however, whitefish bay will be your best bet."
1634986,Ia Walihntr,2013-04-04 07:15:00,320,"Clayton, Sabaskong Bay has excellent fishing for all speicies except Lakers. I have not fished the waters between Nestor Falls and Splitrock Narrows but can tell you that the rest of Sabaskong Bay has some excellent fishing for walleye, northern, smallmouth, and musky. If you are going to fish for Lakers, you have two close options. Fish Whitefish Bay on LOTW or Crow Lake (Kakagi Lake). You will have to trailer your boat to a Sioux Narrows area ramp or a Kakagi ramp. It is possible to boat up Sabaskong Bay to the Turtle Lake mechanical portage (takes you to Whitefish Bay) which is located just north of Hay Island on Sabaskong Bay. The operation of the mechanical portage is very difficult, at best. Since you are new to that area, I would suggest you hire a guide at least one day on Sabaskong to show you the area and put you on fish. You will have two options for the purchase off a Minnesota fishing license. You nay either drive to Baudette, Mn. or International Falls, Mn. and purchase your nonresident license at a bait shop or purchase it on line. https://jc.activeoutdoorsolutions.co.../app/goHome.do You will need one while fishing Minnesota waters. Marv"
1635010,MN_Moose,2013-04-04 07:19:00,964,"If your staying in Nestor I think you don't need to be concerned about fishing across the border. Yes, it's possible to travel from Nestor to Oak Island but it's long ways to go. Plus, you would be going past a whole bunch of great fishing spots."
1635130,Clayton69,2013-04-04 07:41:00,80,"Gents, thanks very much for the info. It's good to know that everything I'm looking for is in the same area I'm staying at. Stony, or Blueberry island are only about 14kms from where I'm staying so no problem there. Everything else I have read kept saying that the best fishing was in the northern half of the lake. For a minute there I though I'd made a mistake by staying in the Sabaskong Bay area. As for the lakers, I usually switch to them if the weather is crappy and wet...just put the top up...the downriggers down...and spend the day trolling and eating. But it looks like a short trailer ride to Whitefish Bay or Crow Lake/Kakagi Lake if the mood strikes me.Thanks again for the info...I can't wait for the new ProV to show up...and then hit the road at the end of June. Always nice to be able to check a lake off the bucket list, and I have very high expectations for this lake!Clayton."
1636914,Musky101,2013-04-04 16:11:00,349,You can always get a remote area border crossing permit. I think they are like $50 and then you can go where you want and not stop at customs.

1638002,stillangling,2013-04-04 21:36:00,149,"Clayton if you have never fished LOW I think that you will probably be a little freaked out by the size of the water. Although it may look like a short jaunt to get out of Sab, you may find it intimidating on the first run. You will probably want to get out into the water near Miles Bay or even further west for walleye. If you want to flog the muskies, Sab is a pretty good bet. Personally I wouldn't even consider fishing the MN waters. Not trying to offend my southern neighbours but the Big Traverse is one big open mud flat with no spot to get out of the wind. It is not by chance that lots of day trippers are coming into Ontario waters from Minnesota based resorts. On another note, why three weeks in one spot? My advice would be to see more of the lake if you have that much time. If you are coming this far, book at least one week at a spot further north in order to fish the water between the barrier islands and the Aulneau."
