Teaubeau lake is a widening of the Albany with rapids upstream and down. My questions are have any of you folks fished or canoe'd this area? Upstream or downstream even? This stretch offers walleye, pike, & Brook Trout, I am very confident of my experience with the pike & trout. But sadly my walleye skills are lacking, I have been reading up on techniques, lures, etc. but besides a live bait rig & limited jigging with twistertails on 2 other Canadian trips,that is the limit of my walleye fishing. Where I grew up we had no walleye ( New Jersey) please don't hold it against me!! I would really appreciate any & all info on the area we are fishing, and tips on fishing for that time of the year. I will gladly post a review of the trip when we get back. Thanks guys"

For tails a 3"" white tail is about all I ever use for walleyes. If you really want something on the hook bring along some salted minnows. I checked out their website and it looks like a great place to go, the rates seem reasonable too. I'll have to add it to my list of places I'd like to get to."

1548117,phishfearme,2013-03-07 14:55:00,1242,"beer slayer - (I still think this is the best WC handle around) - I've done two Albany river trips via canoe - each of two week duration - the first from the road at osnaburg lake to miminiska lake and the second from achapi lake to petawanga lake. both of these trips are considerably upstream of your lake and are also in the Canadian schield whereas I think teabeau is into the james bay lowlands. lakes in the lowlands are typically shallow and relatively featureless (minimal structure). schield lakes are typically rocky as hello and contain lots of underwater structure for the fish to relate to. we've also done a flyin trip to aba lake downstream of fort hope and boated up and down the river extensively. still upstream from your lake - we prefer schield lakes. so, I would suggest two walleye strategies - 1 - concentrate upstream and downstream of flow areas (walk around them and fish from shore if you have to) and 2a - focus on underwater structures, 2b if underwater structure is limited- troll around a lot. the areas below rapids or flow areas can be incredible - especially if the flow is coming into a lake. the area where the river came into miminiska lake was called ""the walleye mine"" by the lodge on the lake but it was soon mined out as the fish will leave the area if harassed too much. our first trip to the mine - before the lodge opened - was incredible and the second trip to the mine after the lodge opened was a total disappointment. on our river trips, the only thing we used was 3inch twister (white or yellow) tails on 1/4 ounce ball jigs for walleye and Johnson's silver spoons tipped with a twister tail trailing out the back for pike. you may want to add some floating and diving minnow lures like rapalas. these are great for trolling as well as casting. by the way - our trips were in late july and we caught exactly zero trout - even though we tried like hello. that time of year they tend to concentrate around underwater spring inlets where the water is cold as hello. finding these is next to impossible. there was nothing but walleye in the river rapids. hope you have a great trip and please post a report - good or bad. thanks, phish"

You can do the count down with a Cleo to control depth & retrieve, or just plain vertical jig. Seldom use a leader except for 3/4 > cuz those attract real teeth"
1548247,Crede,2013-03-07 19:38:00,134,"I have only fished the Albany as far east as Makokibatan. My advice for walleye in mid-June would be to target the edge of where the current and the slack water meet near where the river enters the lake (within about the first mile or so of there). Looking in depths anywhere from 5-15 feet. I would also spend some time fishing in the current where the river enters the lake...and anywhere else on the lake where smaller streams enter with current. We usually fish jigs in this situation (1/4-3/8 oz.) but some smaller spoons and crank baits (shad raps, wally divers, etc.) can be very effective. If fishing jigs, I would also take minnows, salted minnows, or crawlers....or some combo of them. Are they necessary? No. But I always feel that having them can help get things started on a lake we haven't been on before and help us to locate productive areas/depths earlier in our trip. Others might disagree with that, but I always consider a few days worth of bait to be cheap insurance on a trip like this."
1638465,Guest,2013-04-05 05:31:00,0,"I would really be interested in people's experiences on this lake / area. Some good ideas on lures, which i appreciate. Do you think fishing will still be ok in late August.....or was this a bad decision? I am an old time traditionalists using daredevils, wobblers and meps....and i think it is time to try other things as suggested. Let me know your thoughts and thanks."
