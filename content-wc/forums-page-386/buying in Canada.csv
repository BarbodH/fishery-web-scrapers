1608529,fldoc,2013-03-28 05:26:00,47,It is possible that I will buy a boat motor from a Canadian living in Ontario. Are there any restrictions and/or extra costs when bringing the motor through customs? Randy from Duluth

The outboard motor did say made in USA on it so they didn't look to hard at it."

Dealer had filled out whatever papers I needed (apparently). The border folks did look to see if there was a required non-pollution sticker on it. If you are purchasing a used motor, I think it would be difficult to determine whether you brought it in, or not - I am not advocating not saying anything, just saying... At the time I purchased the motor, the exchange rate was advantageous for the purchase to be made there. Bill"

In August I received a $2800 bill for taxes. Somehow the paperwork from the semis that delivered the materials got found. Wound up paying, still came out ahead. I realize that's a little different than a motor. Are you going to put it on the boat before returning home? Slushfish"
