This is their reply: Hello,Thank you for your inquiry.A hook includes a single-pointed or multiple-pointed hook on a common shaft but does not include a snagger or spring gaff. The number of hooks includes any single-pointed or multiple-pointed hooks that are part of a lure. A fishing line must not have more than four hooks attached. Therefore, it is legal to use a stinger hook.You may not catch a fish by impaling or snagging it with a hook through any part of the body other than the mouth - any fish hooked in this way must be released immediately.I hope you have found this information helpful.

We have never used stinger hooks, because years ago we were told that it was illegal.We would like to find out the truth, because we are having a big discussion on a Walleye blog. They all say that it is legal to use a stinger hook on a jig. Please give me an accurate answer that I can share, and so that I know.Thank you very much for your time,"
