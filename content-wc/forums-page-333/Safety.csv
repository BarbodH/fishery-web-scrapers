I thought that I would pass on a tradition that my Dad started years ago on our first fly-in, and that we continue today. After the plane was unloaded and everything brought up to the cabin, Dad would sit us down at the table for a ""Safety Meeting"".1) Remember every minute where you are, which is NOT 20 minutes from a hospital2) No horseplay in the boats, and lifejackets always ready.3) Special care when cleaning fish-we're not starving to death4) Anything else deemed appropriate."

2767337,LOW1,2014-05-07 09:41:00,2828,Wise Advice and a good practice. We have slight expanded it to say that as long as you are in a boat owned by dad and/or receiving financial support from dad that thou shall wear a life preserver at all times.

Buddy of mine could not handle his whisky after fishing for the day and he fell over, splitting the skin on his brow wide open. My buddy and I were in no condition to drive. So I played doctor (been trained in 1st aid). Pulled the supper glue from my plastics tray, few butter flies, and he was good to go. Looking at his scar today, I think I did a pretty darn good job. We now only let him drink beer."

Another tip would be to make sure members of your group periodically check in with each other or has some type of visual contact. A lot will matter on how big the body of water is. If darkness falls, it is best to sit tight and wait for help."
