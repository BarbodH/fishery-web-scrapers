2746697,Jack77,2014-05-01 10:48:00,168,This is always the way it has worked for me. Our outfitter cashes the check and it hits my bank as exactly the amount I wrote it for the our outfitter lets me know what it ended up being.
2743233,ed08walleye,2014-04-30 17:16:00,27,"When you send your deposit by check and the bill is in Canadian funds, do you automatically do the conversion or do you write ""Canadian funds"" on the check for the bank to do the conversion or ask the outfitter specifically?"
2743273,Jimmy Jig,2014-04-30 17:32:00,1905,Put it on a credit card. Our money is higher than theirs.
2744009,bones82,2014-04-30 20:28:00,121,Be sure the credit card doesn't charge for doing the conversion first.
2744177,wallydave,2014-04-30 20:55:00,2151,"Sorry for the ""check"" thing! Some outfitters quote US funds, others Canadian. Work with them on what works for them. The ones I have done business with go with US funds. Good luck either way!"
2744497,Freytown,2014-04-30 22:10:00,770,"Never heard of that option?? My outfitter will accept US$ check and will let me know what their bank gave them in CA$ funds. This year was good for going from US$ to CA$. The years I have been short, I just made up the difference when paying the final bill. But, best to ask the outfitter first."
2746049,ed08walleye,2014-05-01 08:35:00,27,"Maybe I should ask a different way: The outfitter charges in $CAN. No credit cards accepted (that's why I asked by check). You send a $500 U.S. check for a deposit. When they deposit it at the outfitters bank, will my account be charged $500 or will it be charged at the prevailing currency conversion rate? Am I overthinking it?"
2746177,1jigfish2,2014-05-01 08:58:00,110,"Your bank will send you a letter, stating what the difference is. Mine usually is within 2 months for notification."
2746241,LOW1,2014-05-01 09:13:00,2828,"Your account will be charged $500 US. The resort's account will be credited in $CDN for whatever $500US is worth on the day the resort deposits it, less any conversion fees."
2746329,621Dreamer,2014-05-01 09:29:00,40,Just write the cheque as follows: CAN$500.00 and it will be cashed at the bank in Canadian funds.
2746353,Freytown,2014-05-01 09:36:00,770,Exactly...simple as that!
