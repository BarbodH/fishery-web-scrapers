2724145,hiwayman,2014-04-25 17:49:00,201,My quess is that this whole thing got started from an outdoor news writer typing the wrong information.
2724161,JAY221,2014-04-25 17:57:00,877,"I emailed the writer 4 days ago & have NOT gotten a response on what his source was for this info. Later , Jay"
2724169,Golden Eagle,2014-04-25 18:06:00,2642,"Writers have not been held responsible in the past several years when it comes to reporting news about anything. It began with their purchasing ink by the barrel and then went viral. The guy you wrote to is taking care of it by ignoring your email, hoping your thought will be forgotten if he waits you out."
2725537,Bill Krejca,2014-04-26 07:42:00,6107,Probably a pretty apt reflection of the times! Bill
2752225,BornToFish,2014-05-02 17:08:00,1224,"I crossed the border this morning at International Falls/Fort Frances. Only one lane of traffic was open, and was ""manned"" by a very pleasant woman. I was the only vehicle in line. She asked all of the routine questions (guns, liquor, tobacco, gifts, things that I might leave behind, etc.). One of the questions pertained to live bait. I said that I had nightcrawlers in bedding and salted minnows. She took my response in-stride and made absolutely zero issue of the salted minnows. She wished me a pleasant time in Canada. I said that I would do my absolute best and wished her a great day! It might be that things will change regarding salted minnows at the border during the next two weeks, as we get closer to opening day at most lodges."
2752921,JDP,2014-05-02 21:12:00,1457,Looks like the Outdoor News printed a correction in this week's issue...attached.
2760953,CI_Guy,2014-05-05 16:49:00,2118,"Here's an reply I got from the Ontario MNR: Hello, Thank you for your inquiry. It is illegal to bring live fish, live leeches, crayfish or salamanders into Ontario for use as bait. It would be legal, however, to bring dead baitfish into Ontario. This information can be found on page 10 of the 2014 Fishing Regulations Summary, available online at http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business...02_163615.html.

2761873,Larry S,2014-05-05 20:17:00,665,Received the Exact Same Worded Reply form the MNR that dead baitfish are Legal.
2706850,Swamp_Donkey_Slayer,2014-04-21 19:19:00,42,Agree based on the MNR regs and the call to the border that was posted above...we are going to chance it and tell them at the border we have frozen salted minnows we they ask of we have frozen bait.
2707130,BreezyPoint,2014-04-21 19:59:00,1581,"I have been study the 2014 regulations at the MNR site and the only item I can find on importation of bait is here, at the bottom of they page:http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business...02_165361.htmlIt doesn't say anything about dead bait."
2709162,Fisherman Ted,2014-04-22 08:51:00,461,I just heard from MNR directly. There is no importing of frozen/dead/salted minnows.
2709554,Lovetofish,2014-04-22 10:39:00,458,I'm with BreezyPoint on this one. I found nothing in the 2014 Regs that says otherwise. You would think that as many people who bring salted minnows it would be printed in the Regs if it was not legal.
2709850,5thsuit,2014-04-22 11:53:00,54,"Googled border crossing ontario, Fort Francis Chamber of Commerce line 8 frozen and salted minnows are allowed!"
2709938,Blackmacs,2014-04-22 12:09:00,2121,Looks like this issue is cleared up.
2710674,BornToFish,2014-04-22 15:15:00,1224,"I contacted the MNR in Ontario by telephone regarding salted/frozen minnows. The agent said nothing has changed that he knew about, but did comment that importing bait would fall under the Canada Border Services (CBS). He said the MNR would not have a policy on importing bait, but could have a law regarding the use of such bait. By the way, I could not find any changes regarding salted/frozen minnows on the MNR website. The agent provided me the telephone number for the CBS. I contacted an agent at the Canada Border Service and learned that she was not aware of any changes in the laws regarding bringing frozen/salted minnows into Canada. She then referred me to the Food Inspection Agency and provided me the telephone number for this agency. Nobody answered the telephone at this agency. Taking frozen/salted minnows to Canada seems to be awash in confusion and possibly mis-information. It might just come down to the particular day that you are crossing the border. I will be taking more nightcrawlers than I normally take with me. I must admit that purchasing minnows at $6.50/dozen in Canada isn't particularly appealing to me."
2710826,Lovetofish,2014-04-22 15:43:00,458,The only questions they have asked me was what kind of minnows...fatheads...and how long were they dead...2-3 days.
2710946,lakerlover,2014-04-22 16:12:00,7,"Is it possible that the regulations for importing bait are for commercial sales and not personal use? When we cross with frozen suckers we always inform them that they are ""commercially obtained"" (from Cabelas) and have never had a problem."
2712058,roscoe33,2014-04-22 20:38:00,653,So no herring for dinner?
2699610,Basser,2014-04-19 19:37:00,31,Lord help us if they start banning DEAD bait!
2699618,BornToFish,2014-04-19 19:38:00,1224,"This thread caught my attention as I just salted twelve dozen minnows. I do some fishing in Canada before the bait retailers are geared up for the season. I have to take my own bait as there is nothing available to purchase. I noticed the same link as mentioned above from the Chamber of Commerce in Fort Frances. It said that salted and frozen minnows are permissible. I thought that maybe the laws have changed, but were not yet reflected in the internet website for the Chamber of Commerce. Hence, I called the Border Crossing in Fort Frances and chatted with an agent that happened to answer the telephone. He said that he was not aware of any changes in the laws regarding fishing bait. He stated that salted minnows, frozen minnows and night crawlers in bedding are permissible. Live minnows and leeches are not allowed. This sounded to me as though nothing has changed from last year. It could be that the law in Ontario has changed but not yet rattled all the way through their chain of command to the men/women on the front line. I will call once again before I head north, just in case. Good fishing and tight lines!!"

2702234,phishfearme,2014-04-20 14:17:00,1242,they already do - in certain areas you cannot use frozen smelts or any kind of smelts for that matter - studies have shown that eggs can indeed survive freezing. phish
2702514,Bill Krejca,2014-04-20 16:13:00,6107,Smelt has not been allowed for several years. How about potatoes? Bill
2702538,phishfearme,2014-04-20 16:25:00,1242,"thanks for the update/correction, bill - shows how long it's been since we used smelts - it's been at least 20 years and at the time, live ones were legal most everywhere and dead ones were illegal in some regions. It surprised me to hear that some eggs can survive freezing. phish"

2706834,Golden Eagle,2014-04-21 19:15:00,2642,Tim Spielman is a writer. Let's see it from another source before getting excited. Spend time around journalism professors and you'll see what I'm talking about.
2697122,dschiebe,2014-04-19 00:50:00,17,In the Minnesota Outdoor News 4/18/14 copy it states that this year Ontario will not allow us to bring frozen minnows across the border. Is this a new rule and true?
2697506,Swamp_Donkey_Slayer,2014-04-19 07:35:00,42,I sure hope not we already have our 100 dozen frozen minnows prepared and ready for the trip. Let me know if you hear anything on this.
2697642,JayM5209,2014-04-19 08:09:00,1050,"Because the regs occasionally change, I find it useful to review the new edition that is published each year. WC makes it easy . . . just click on the sticky note at the top of the Canada, eh? page.I just looked at the ""allowable bait"" section of the 2014 regs. Frozen and salted minnows are not mentioned. I did not check each Zone section to see if there are specific exceptions for the Zone. It may be wise to review all the information for the Zone in which you will be fishing.
