Supposed to be tough as nails, and will catch 20 - 30 gills or perch before needing to be replaced. I believe it is a strip of seal skin. Anyways, I bought some last summer for perch. Gonna take it along to CA for eyes this spring. Will probably use it on a day that we run out of minnows. Will let you know if it worked."
