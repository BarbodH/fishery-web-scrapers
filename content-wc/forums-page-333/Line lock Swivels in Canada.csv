2735234,Richy,2014-04-28 22:40:00,14,Awesome. Thanks
2735706,stevensinks,2014-04-29 06:57:00,330,I have a couple of questions about using these. Are they hard on your line? Do they stay in place when you catch a fish? If they dont damage your line I want to get some.
2736546,Richy,2014-04-29 09:24:00,14,I just want them to attach a weight to the bottom of a dropshot rig. It doesn't matter if it damages the line a bit as it is at the end of the line anyways..
2737106,prov1800,2014-04-29 11:13:00,5010,I just clamp on a split shot to the bottom of my dropping rig.dont clamp it to tight and if you get hung up you can just slide your line out of the split shot.no returning just clamp another one on.
2749633,Richy,2014-05-01 23:45:00,14,I am going to use them for recoil rigs. I need them as I will be using 1oz weights.
2753129,ImpactFishing,2014-05-02 22:18:00,446,Or you could just use a drop shot weight for drop shorting. Already has a line clip built into the weight...
