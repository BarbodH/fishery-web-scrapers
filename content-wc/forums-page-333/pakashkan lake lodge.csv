We fished up the Graham road for about 15 years.Make sure you have spare tires, and a sturdy trailer.The road was decent last spring, but it can change in a matter of days, depending on rain and logging truck traffic.Take it slow and you will be fine.Remember, the logging trucks do own the road, so pull over when you see one coming.Always launched at the north end of Pakashkan,.Jig n minnow, crawler rig, trolling little joe spinners.Never fished the south end of the lake where the lodge is. sorry.I have heard varying reviews of the facilities, and don't know what is accurate.I tend to think it is a typical Canadian fish camp.Not a dump, not 5 star either.Have fun."
