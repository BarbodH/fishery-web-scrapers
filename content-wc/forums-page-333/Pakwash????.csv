2748937,P&y only,2014-05-01 19:10:00,133,I fish Pakwash Lake and I rarely see any mention of it on here. I know I'm not the only one who fishes it. Anyone one here fish it and wanna share secrets of the lake?
2750009,Bakefish,2014-05-02 06:43:00,1077,Fished it for years. What time of year do you go and what camp?
2750209,REG,2014-05-02 07:31:00,445,"Our group has been going up yearly for more than 20 years - sometimes more than once yearly. It's not hard to find fish on Pakwash. As already said, when and where? As far as secrets - if I shared them, they wouldn't exactly be secrets anymore."

2750849,ftfarms,2014-05-02 09:54:00,444,If your going to go to pakwash I would stay at snakefalls camp. Rob and nancy are great people and run a top notch camp. I really don't have any secrets We did have tough fishing one week we was there and I just started fishing places they shouldn't be the time of year we was there. No one was having any luck so we started fishing the river at the south east side of the lake. Run into a bunch of nice walleyes in five foot of water in the cabbage. This was the first week of August.
2751505,REG,2014-05-02 13:29:00,445,"We have always stayed with Rob and Nancy at Snake Falls Camp. First rate camp with top notch cabins and equipment. They will work hard to make sure your stay is great and that you catch some fish! We usually hit Pakwash early in the season - first part of June - and will catch the Walleyes pretty shallow. Hit the points or the sand where the wind is/has been blowing in. Or the mouth of either river (Trout or Chukuni). If you're there after the cabbage comes up, fish the edges. Pretty basic. The lake doesn't have Lake Trout or Muskies (some will say that a few Muskies have been taken but we've never snagged or even seen one). But Walleyes, Perch, Northerns, and what seems to be a growing population of Smallmouth should keep you busy. I even caught a few Whitefish last year."
2751513,P&y only,2014-05-02 13:54:00,133,Ive always stayed at brownlees. We catch a lot of fish but I havent explored the whole lake. Anything worth seeing or fishing on the opposite side from the trout river?
2751625,Nimitz,2014-05-02 14:28:00,20,We always stay at the Trout River Lodge. Very nice people. I would highly recommend staying there.We are usually there the first week in June and have had good success in several spots. Pakwash is a huge lake and I would like to have time to explore more of it.
