2756361,LoDo,2014-05-04 08:39:00,721,"Crazy to hear about all the traffic and rude behavior on LS. I didn't see that when I was there, but its been 7 years plus since i've fished Ear Falls area. Maybe another reason is because we would do the 30min boat ride to MacKenzie, Ghost narrows, CI islands, Manitoba Pt areas. For me, fishing Canada is all about getting as far away as possible. Fly-ins are the only way to fish..."
2757393,jimmie,2014-05-04 15:41:00,123,I've only experienced that a cpl times and never on Lac Seul. I put in at Decetion Landing on SE paortion of the lake poften as many as 35/40 rigs there and only have to wave at other boats passing by. Have fished with other boats in sight but 1/2 to one mile apart. Im like to chat with folks and will get close enough to turn off motor and exchange an hello and how have you done and wish them good luck and move on. Never a battle of the worms here!!
2758785,NWwalleye,2014-05-05 04:53:00,223,So.. you like to slide over ask the other boat how they are doing ...Now.. if the response is positive do you click the GPS and mark the spot ? How many negative response have you got ??I would bet that not all your exchanges have been pleasant !!!
2759729,jimmie,2014-05-05 09:12:00,123,"No I do not mark thier spot as I have likely fished there before but like to exchange info if they are willing as I often give more than I get. Never a negative response. Usually its just in passing I do not cross the entire lake to chat. If they have been catching them by the bushel basket I will not fish the same spot until after thay have gone on my way passed the same area anyway. I guess since you ask that you must not be used to having folks being too friendly. I have been on lakes where there mighht be a boat or two then four then 10 all of a sudden on a reef as small as a living room because others do not want to go try a different spot. Lac Seul for example is big enough for everybody. I usually find out more good info at the dock when trailering up. Most people are very friendly. It never hurts to be nice either you know. I meet more folks that live near to me than one might think. Then they ask do you know so and so? Most of the time I do not yet at times I can say that I do indeed. I enjoy the overall adventure as it all belongs to Him now doesn't it. We are fortunate that we are able to use those wonders from time to time to enjoy solitude and fishing in general, aren't we? Be safe and good luck."
2760033,tv4fish,2014-05-05 10:42:00,2694,"Jimmie: I can tell by your posts -- that you are part of the ""Minnesota nice"" group. Good on 'ya."
2761377,MikeinMN,2014-05-05 18:46:00,190,"Don't get discouraged by the direction this thread has taken. Our group has been staying in the Ear Falls area of Lac Seul for close to 10 years now and in our experience that kind of boating behavior is extremely rare to say the least. We do go in the summer and maybe in the spring near the sanctuary and the community spots close to Ear Falls there is a crowd, but other than the Great Sand Banks in McKenzie bay, there are not a lot of issues with crowding. If you choose to fish in the middle of Steamboat Narrows (or any other narrows) you will have high speed traffic close to you because you will be in a marked navigational route. Keep moving and try different spots, depths, and techniques. Don't spend too much time on a spot just because it looks good or someone told you it's a good spot. Fish areas with the wind blowing in. Lac Seul can have a very wind oriented bite. A bottom bouncer spinner rig with some kind of live bait is a good way to find fish. Don't be afraid to fish shallower or deeper than you think you should. Fish can be caught casting or trolling, not just jigging or pulling spinners. After several years we still have really good days and some bad days as far as fishing. Lac Seul is a very big beautiful lake, enjoy it. Our group will be at Gawley's resort in August and if you are there at that time, stop in some evening."
2761737,btmbncr,2014-05-05 19:55:00,492,"PoochI'm with you on this one.For me finding walleyes is the fun part.I think it's pretty easy to catch walleyes but it's more difficult for most fisherman to find them consistently.They move with the food/bait fish sources a lot. Fishinfun I'll do anything I can to put you on fish when your on your trip to Lac Seul,mark maps,show you my GPS way points,have you follow me,anything you want.Ill show you/give you the rigs and/or jigs we are catching fish on.Last time I looked I have something like 82 structures I've got waypoints for on Lac Seul that have produced fish for us,humps,points,sand flats,rock reefs and sharp breaks it all depends on depth,water temperature and bait. Hey Bigtimeelectric I just talked Lucy,my wife,into staying at Lac Seul for longer than a month.I sure hope we can be there when your crew is there.Cold adult beverages in the evening around the fire,ganging up on some big walleyes on Lucys favorite ""Hawg"" spots down south.Just a thought. Prov1800,John,I was really considering fishing a couple of days with you when we were up there.I don't need a guide to catch fish on Lac Seul but it has been fun over the years to go with a guide every once in a while.A guy never knows what he might learn or he just might make a new friend. Sorry sport I ""ain't gonna fish with somebody that casts Top Raiders at someone else's boat if they get too close to you"" . That is real unsportsmanlike behavior.If you do that to me in my boat it might start an unpleasant experience for you. Last evening on our trip back home from picking up our new boat I asked my wife if she thought fisherman were rude on Lac Seul,her reply was""I've never seen it"".This is from a woman that has fished the Missouri River reservoirs for close to 45 years.I my self have not experienced rude fisherman/boaters on Lac Seul.I have had boats move in on spots I'm fishing,it's not a big deal,I don't ""own"" any fishing spot in North America.It's just fishing,I thought it was supposed to be fun.I have pulled up to Bigtimeelectric and his crew to talk and watched them catch fish and learned something, a new technique.Sorry big guy I didn't hit GPS to mark your spot(smile).It's all in your attitude and perception.( there are days and posts like this today that I wish I had been born more intelligent than so good looking).Bill"
2761969,prov1800,2014-05-05 20:33:00,5010,"This thread is starting to go the wrong way, way of subject.first of all I didnt say everyone is rude on the lake but have come across a few.ive had people fish so close to me the be backed over my orange marker buoy, would you like that bill.so ya I get a little upset.ive been fishing and guiding out there for over 20 years and have seen a lot interesting stuff out there.ive fished from earfalls to siouxlookout, ive found a lot fishing spots in between the two towns, put a lot 30""+ fish in the boat, myself and my guests, so iam a little partial to my spots and like to keep them a secret wouldnt you, its my job.you phoned me and I was going to try and accommodate on a Saturday if I get any days of.if you dont want me thats fine with me, your loss, and if you ever get to close to me and a top raider bounces of your boat,and you want to dance with me, we can do it.otherwise lets just stick to talking about fishing thats what were here for."

I don't want to dance with you.I looked at your pictures on your website and I don't think your that attractive.P.S.S Don't worry about an unpleasant experience with me.I just hope my son in law is in the boat with a ""Top Raider"" experience.Now this I would pay money too see."

Not my thing that's all I'm saying.I have no dirty work that needs to be done. Your invitation to dance shocked me.I like women not men but with the current marriage laws in Ontario you were making me feel a little nervous with the dancing invite,sorry. Peace out brother.If you really want to know what I'm like call Doug or Gayle Gawley or Andrea at Goose Bay.I spent a little over a month there with my wife at Gawleys a few days over two weeks at Goose Bay.They would be good references. I'm done with this post.If I can help people out on their Lac Seul fishing trips I will if not so be it.I'm no longer a guide,I did guide years ago and fished 266 days one year(FL). If you want to come to South Dakota for a big walleye bite it usually kicks off around the full moon in October.I'll take you fishing and put you up for free.Jigs and big creek chubs on sharp breaks is usually the pattern,like breaking off into 60 ft plus.I haven't put any walleyes in the boat on this bite over 13 lbs yet but we are getting close.If the full moon is close to the Pheasant season opener you are invited to hunt our family farm.We have a couple of sections(that's square miles) that are farmed for wild Pheasant habitat.I have a Golden Retriever,female Hanna and a super little English Cocker Spaniel,female,Tuffy,that are bird vacuum cleaners.Good wild bird numbers and easy hunting. Crack open an ice cold Kokanee and chill.Bill"
2766025,ftfarms,2014-05-07 03:52:00,444,btmbncr. Get over it. Point and case no body wants so dumba-- to come fish right next to them. Whatever it takes to teach these people that thinks this is the right thing to do I know I or anyone else don't own that spot but it just rude and dumb when you got a body of water that large to run right up next to someone and drop a line. Thats all I got to say about that.
2766113,prov1800,2014-05-07 05:19:00,5010,Thank you.
2766361,bigwillies,2014-05-07 06:46:00,515,totally agree.very frustrating.
2762473,NWwalleye,2014-05-06 05:31:00,223,"Now.. Now fellas ...No need to get aggressive..I too guide on Lac Seul and do so with prov1800 on occasionIt can get frustrating when you are guiding and a another boat comes over and fishes on top of your marker..And it happens ...If everyone took jimmie's approach and waited until the other boat has left then fish that spot. It works.. Just wait until we or who ever is done and has moved on ..I too have done what jimmie has done .. no harm no foul !!Just remember, that 1 bad apple doesn't ruin the whole batch..Here is to another great summer of fishing, hope eveyone has a successful trip in 2014 !!!"
2754329,BreezyPoint,2014-05-03 12:25:00,1581,"We fished there last summer out of Goose Bay in late August. I am still perplexed as to people boating all the way to MacKenzie Bay. We did that one day and the fishing was very good, but for us not worth a second trip. We caught all the fish we wanted very close to the camp, including our biggest fish within sight of the camp.I really have a hard time understanding the big trip, other than the grass is always greener on the other side. Andrea had a full camp and everyone went to MacKenzie Bay every day except myself and one other party and we did just as well as the big trippers. The bonus is we had spots all to ourselves as opposed to the traffic jam and rude boaters in MacKenzie Bay.The additional bonus for us was more time spent fishing than boat riding and a much lower gas bill."
2754401,LoDo,2014-05-03 13:23:00,721,"I didn't mind the boat ride and I like that our group went to MacKenzie for the simple fact of being remote. I don't remember seeing or experiencing any ""traffic jams"". To be honest I don't recall seeing other boats except when passing through steamboat narrow area. We crushed big walleyes to the sw of the small island in the furthest most area of MacKenzie bay."
2754441,BreezyPoint,2014-05-03 13:31:00,1581,"I had boats, multiple times, park in front of me on my trolling run; I had boats zoom by me as close as 50 feet at high speed and there were boats parked on almost every spot. I found the boaters, in general, on Lac Seul to be the rudest I had ever seen. Not for me, especially, when I could catch just as many fish within a mile or two of camp."
2754745,prov1800,2014-05-03 16:07:00,5010,"Breezy, I hear you.iam a local guide and fish lac seul a lot from spring till late fall, the later being my favourite, as the fishing improves a hundred per cent, dont hardly see any boats that time of the year except first week of oct.when some moose hunters come out.but they don't bother you at all.getting back to the rude fisherman, I totally agree, and you know where there from right.uhuh.I guess they can't help it as some of my guests havetold me thats the way it is in most places in the states from what they said.I get pretty upset myself whensomebody gets to close to me with all that water around.but they usually leave in a hurry when the top raider bounces of there boat.lol.but generally I find the fishing much better in that area and further south yet.huge w alleyes down, I don't mind taking a run there for the qaulity of fish I get.but iam coming out of scout bay and will travelling to steamboat in the late fall also as the larger w alleyes seem to be there at that time of the year.ive guided out of earfalls and have had small fish days there so I just keep moving south to find bigger fish schools, and they are there.have been pretty lucky with some of the places I fish hardly ever see a boat and there not camp spots, fishing known camp spots are always crowded.good luck this year."
2754825,wallydave,2014-05-03 16:29:00,2151,"Im not sure why , but the guys on the NW end of LS do seem to be pretty rude. Andea at Goose Bay told me of a party of two older guys getting swamped by a couple of guys at the mouth of the Wenesaga last year. Like Breezy said guys will crowd you and.your spot. LS is a great fishery, but Im looking for less traffic!"
2754841,ftfarms,2014-05-03 16:45:00,444,Im with you breezy. That s why I went on a search for a differant lake. Fished lac suel several years and got tired of every one playing bumper boats on that Hugh body of water. So far lotws is the one we go to know 2 1/2 hours closer and basically the same fishing with crappies as the kicker.
2754881,prov1800,2014-05-03 16:50:00,5010,"Theres two places on lac seul I won't fish, the wenesaga river and sawmill bay, those places remind me of going to a big mall.there are lots of places to fish in peace, just got to get of the grid.bring a muskie rod and a top raider, you can through them a Longggggg way.dont fish a spot to long, people will know your doing good and they'll be on that spot for the rest of the week after you leave.that or try fall time.nobody on hardly any of the lakes."
2754921,BreezyPoint,2014-05-03 17:10:00,1581,"I fish Lake of the Woods as well and I rarely see the behavior there as I saw on Lac Seul. I just don't get it. Also, only a couple of times in well over 30 trips did anyone move in on my spot on LOTW. I like to fish alone and even though I was disappointed in the behavior of some people on Lac Seul, every day on my trip last year I found my own spots with no one else around. It is a big lake and there should be room for everyone."
2755305,Knoxabilly,2014-05-03 20:21:00,225,"I fish Lac Seul and spend a lot of time in Sawmill Bay. When I was younger if people got too close we would start casting large northern lures to establish a perimeter if necessary. If they got too close my Dad was never shy about yelling ""there's a lot of lake here"""
2755737,Pooch,2014-05-04 05:25:00,4619,"I love to hunt new fish or new spots. Stumbling across a new sweet spot or a pod of unmolested fish is mentally rewarding for me. I avoid public ""spots"" or other boats when possible.Lac Seul has been a smorgasbord for me the last couple years. True, I don't catch a lot of fish some days, but I've always got an area to myself and usually have uneducated fish under me.Originally and yet to this day, Lac Seul mystified me with all the sand bottom, but with help from guys on this board and folks I've met in camp, I'm gettin' the hang of it. I'm always learning and that is what makes it fun.I find any ""new to me"" body of water a challenge I can't resist.Pooch"
2751905,Fishin Fun,2014-05-02 15:58:00,218,I am staying at a resort in the NW section of the Lac. This is the first year that any of my group will be on this body of water. We've spent most of our time on Gullrock. Are there decent places to catch eyes in the NW area or do I need to plan to travel to another area of Lac Seul?
2752001,prov1800,2014-05-02 16:19:00,5010,That depends on when your week up here is.
2752377,WalleyeWally28,2014-05-02 17:38:00,298,"Yes, it depends on when but also on where your resort is located in the NW section."
2752401,btyreprich,2014-05-02 17:39:00,1067,"For the past 12 or so years, we have fished out of the Ear Falls area on Lac Seul in late July thru mid August. We have always caught our limits and enjoyed ourselves. We feel weather is more predictable at that time of the year. Not so sure about earlier in the season. If your trip falls within this time frame, my experience will tell you that you are in for a great time!"
2752433,wallydave,2014-05-02 17:48:00,2151,"Early season can be great fishing, but it can get crowded at some spots. Saw Mill and the Wenesaga river are a couple busy spots. Check with your outfitter and wait for a few more replies. Where and when?"
2752585,Fishin Fun,2014-05-02 18:57:00,218,Will I find eyes during that time?
2752729,wallydave,2014-05-02 19:40:00,2151,"Check with Breezy Point , he was catching walleyes in the bay your camp is on. Try the search function too! That time of year a lot less traffic, plus stable weather."
2752753,bigtimeelectric,2014-05-02 20:23:00,174,You are in luck bottom bouncer will be there at that time and he might just help you out if you butter him up.... He can catch fish there although he runs 20 miles from camp. We will be there a couple weeks after you and we usually run down past steamboat narrows before we put a line in the water as well. That being said we have caught some decent fish within sight of camp as well. As you are looking off the dock at Gawleys there is a little island on the right if you go around behind it there is some structure a few hundred yards off the island that we have found some fish on from time to time. Don't waste your time at lunker point that time of the year. If the wind is blowing into a shore don't be afraid to get in there less than 10' deep and work it. PM me for any questions you may have.
2753529,WalleyeWally28,2014-05-03 06:53:00,298,"Just a hint. If you have a few Kokanees on ice I'll bet that bottom bouncer will point you in the right direction. We'll be there that same week except we stay just down the road at Whitewing. You can pretty much catch eyes anywhere in August but we prefer to fish Steamboat Bay, McKenzie Bay and areas on south into the SW section. In the past we have found them anywhere from 3'-30' deep so work all depths. PM me if you have any questions."
2754257,LoDo,2014-05-03 11:37:00,721,I used to fish Lac Seul with my father and family years ago before turning things over to a fly-in to Woodland Caribou Prov Park. We stayed in Ear Falls but found ourselves boating to MacKenzie Bay as thats where we could catch 100+ fish per day. Two years in Ear Falls quickly changed to Lac Seul Lodge in Rat Bay which is 30-45 miles south of Ear Falls. Rat bay is closer to MacKenzie via boat ride. Lac Seul is an enormous body of water and you shouldn't have a problem catching walleyes. Have fun!!
