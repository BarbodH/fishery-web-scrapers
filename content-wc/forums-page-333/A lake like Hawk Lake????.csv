2747545,Fisherman Ted,2014-05-01 14:35:00,461,Odd you would make that comment seeing as you have never been to my lodge.
2755641,wpg_snowboarder,2014-05-03 23:12:00,6,"wasnt putting down your lodge at all its a beautiful setup just seems a bit pricey to me for a drive in lodge although i haven't experienced the hospitality and food, if thats as good as the rest of the lodge its a fair price plus i the new bigger boats are sweet!"
2759281,tjandy,2014-05-05 07:29:00,107,I would love to try their lodge sometime. Not sure the rest of my group can afford that though.
2759609,jimmie,2014-05-05 08:44:00,123,"I agree with most of all the other posts on this topic from what I know. Almost every lake that has a decent 'eye population has potnetial for big'uns. I personally witnessed a 37 1/2"" mount caught by a lodge owner friend years back. This as it turned out was 20 1/4 lbs and may have been that elusive world record as it was after she had spwned out all her eggs. Now they might not have still be viable at her age but she isn't either!! Took him just over an hour to land her as he was using 6lb test!!He took the cheek scales to the MNR and she was aged at17/18 years old!I had the 'eye of a lifetime on Lac seul two years ago just off an island point and had it not been for my usual clumbsy netting job would have had one over 35"" in the boat. Would have released her (after photo) but hoping that she still swims near there. I have my measuring sticker on the inside of my boat beside where I should have properly netted her. I was so nervous after getting her to the surface I hit het on the head instead of in front of her and she broke me off!! Okay I broke me off!!! I only cried for a litle while. However, it would depend upon what your idea of huge is. There are many, many 25"" and greater 'eyes you can catch during your trip. There are numerous eaters also. I have found that there is no magic place as I have caught them that size in 3' to 25' of water. I do not keep fish so don't bring them up from the depths as some do and let them explode inside and have thier eyes bug out. No live 'eyes onboard except to photo and quickly release. There are smallies and nice Northern Pike too. Plus there are 12 bodies of water in the Sioux Lookout area that I like to give a try when I have the time. Most all resort owners and/or guides will put you on the fish. Thay want you to come back too. Of the 250,000 bodies of water in Ontario I'm certain that you can find a dozen within a short distance of one another. There is also Lake of the Woods up North that is producing very nice sized 'eyes. Lake Erie is your best chance for catching numbers of over 30"" fish. However, that may involve planer boards and or a charter boat!! You decide. I love the Pre-cambrian sheild lakes myself. Pure beauty, serenity, not crowded water. Oh yes, of course fish!! Although the growth is much slower up north for nearly all fish the world records exist in NW Ontario waters. From Pike to that elusive 25lb.+ walleye. Hopefully one will not have to travel to the Columbia River to find them. There is that 70lb musky too don't forget!! No matter where you go, be safe, it can always be the trip of a lifetime with family members. Life is too short not to enjoy such of life's treasures. Family and fish they just go together don't you think? Jim"
2760409,Carnhzkr,2014-05-05 12:50:00,964,"Hawk Lake has been on my wish list for several years, ever since I stumbled upon their website while searching for big walleye lakes. Unfortunately, it's likely to remain on my wish list. Unless I came into some unexpected fortune, at about $400 pp/pd, it's priced way out of my range. Sounds like an incredible walleye and smallmouth fishery, and a five-star lodge. Guess I'll have to slum it with the rest of you average Joes and let the doctors, lawyers, and CEOs live it up at Hawk Lake. Oh well, Lac Seul ain't too shabby either."
2760425,The Donger,2014-05-05 12:59:00,48,"The nice thing about NW Ontario is that there is a place for everyone, every taste and every pocketbook. I'm sure the five star outfitters do a booming business and their guests enjoy food and lodging commensurate with the cost. I prefer to rough it a bit at a remote outpost where we don't see other boats, we can cook our own meals on our own schedule, and we can catch fish until our arms ache. None of these trips are ""cheap"" but to me there is not a better ""value"" in a vacation than flying in to a remote lake and blowing off the world for a week. 26 days to go!"
2762833,tjandy,2014-05-06 07:14:00,107,I'm with ya on that. No one has ever cooked us a meal while we were up there. That is 30 + years in a row for a few of them.
2735794,SinOrSwim,2014-04-29 07:15:00,1528,"I've never fished HL but will be for a couple days in August for exactly what you wrote. The potential to catch 12 fish 27 to 30.5"". Yes, it is expensive but it is not much different than a fly in. Time will tell but I'm hoping my son and I can pull in a hog or two."
2735882,tjandy,2014-04-29 07:31:00,107,That is similar to what we do on Nungesser. Our largest Northern is usually mid 40's. However in the last couple years the big Walleyes have been eluding us.
2735906,tjandy,2014-04-29 07:33:00,107,That is awesome.
2740514,wpg_snowboarder,2014-04-30 06:24:00,6,"aug will be tough for the bigger eyes. you will get them float fishing leeches in 18-25fow at dusk. try the south side of the reef in the main bay mid way along the reef, another that always produces is about 200 yards thru the narrows on the east side of the mouth theres a bit of a ledge 17-23fow this spot depending on the fish you can float fish or if theyre not active jig it keeping your jig within 6"" of the bottom. i know this should be common sense but if your going out at dusk, please make sure your boat has working lights and use them. i have had a few close calls with lodge boats running around in pitch black with no lights on."
2740706,SinOrSwim,2014-04-30 07:20:00,1528,"Thanks!!! Seems whenever my schedule allows for travel the fishing is never as good. LOL But, with work, kids sports etc I have small windows. Our other trip we have done for years with all the guys is always in september. CAn be hit or miss then too."
2740842,prov1800,2014-04-30 07:40:00,5010,"Hey sin, sounds like you and your crew need to hook up with me at some point, definetly have to try it when your here in sept, would be a blast."
2741058,tjandy,2014-04-30 08:36:00,107,These look like some great places. We like to try something new every 3 or 4 years. Will definitely try one of these. I will also give you a call sometime.
2742425,Aaron-IN,2014-04-30 13:40:00,500,"If you like to troll cranks you have a pretty good chance of catching a 30+ incher on Big Sand Lake (Minaki) in late summer, Just sayin."
2742697,fshfktry,2014-04-30 14:52:00,6,"Last season, we had multiple groups that caught walleyes over 32"". Unexpected lake has awesome walleye and northern pike fishing. Cabin holds up to 8 http://www.gopickerel.com/pages/unexpected-lake.php"

2733665,camp chef,2014-04-28 15:59:00,915,"No , We plan on going back again though. There is just so much cool water that we haven't fished. We are going back to Stokes Bay on Rainy lake this spring. It is a boat in from Minnesota with a portage into Canada. We hammered the Big Females coming off the spawn last year and have to go take another look."
2733689,LoDo,2014-04-28 16:02:00,721,"We do a fly-in west of Red Lake in the Woodland Caribou Prov Park. Our party is always 8-10 deep. Each of us put $60 in the kitty for the following bets: Largest walleye (length) - $20 Largest northern (length) - $20 Combined walleye & northern (length) - $20 The largest walleye is usually in the 28-29"" range Largest northern is usually 40"". A few years back we had a 46""."
2733897,tjandy,2014-04-28 16:47:00,107,"Seems the big fish numbers have been down a bit over the last 3 years. We haven't boated a fish over 27"". Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
2734137,GNO,2014-04-28 17:42:00,153,"Lac Seul is a top destination for big walleyes. I am partial to the area around Hudson and the NE section of the lake. I would recommend Lost Island for that end of the lake. Other lakes that are great for big walleyes are LOW, Pipestone, White Otter, and Rainy Lake. Not necessarily always big numbers, but they produce big fish. Rainy Lake is often being referred to by many as the new Lac Seul. It also has a strict slot and reduced limit which contributes to Rainy's improving fishery. I am sure there are many others out there also."
2734353,pale ryder,2014-04-28 18:47:00,1937,"As much as I love fishing in Canada, if I wanted a monster walleye I would go to Bay De Noc or lake erie."
2734465,NWwalleye,2014-04-28 19:02:00,223,2 Words......Lac Seul !!!
2735594,wpg_snowboarder,2014-04-29 06:35:00,6,"i have a cabin on hawk lake ont. i've fished many places and yet to find a lake that has more big pig eyes. my best evening was between 3 of us 12 eyes 27-30.5"" in 1.5 hrs plus a couple eaters. it is a beauty lodge but quite pricey for what it is in my opinion."
2735698,prov1800,2014-04-29 06:49:00,5010,"I would have to say in the cliff lake, but you wont catch a lot.lac seul will give up a lot of 24-26"" and the odd 28"" per day, eagle lake toward the evening hrs will also give up 30-34"" girls but only in certain places just before you have to stop fishing as there is no night fishing there.if you like hunting for muskies you will like hunting for big walleyes, just need patience and enjoy fishing with out the need to catch a hundred a day."
2735738,prov1800,2014-04-29 07:00:00,5010,"I envy you,, youll have to invite me over one evening, iam only half hr from there.lol.definately the evening hours seem to be the best.the deep trout lakes seem to hold the biggest fish.but as nwwalleye said lac suel is tough to beat and i know he has fished hawk lake."
2732473,tjandy,2014-04-28 11:24:00,107,"Does anyone know of a lake with huge walleyes, like Hawk Lake? My group doesn't need all the amenities. We enjoy cooking and taking care of ourselves. I would really like to get my dad on a week long trip of monster walleyes before he isn't able to go anymore. Thanks"
2732689,prov1800,2014-04-28 12:13:00,5010,"Every lake in our area has fish like hawk lake.just harder to find them as the lakes are larger.lac seul has though on the other hand has them and can be caught on a regular bases.another good lake for large walleye is cliff lake but are hard to find as it is a deep trout lake.just need to figure out out if you want quantity or quality, lac seul has both."
2732785,tjandy,2014-04-28 12:49:00,107,"Can you recommend lodges? We fish Nungesser almost every year, its an awesome lake. I would like to go after some monsters with dad before he can't make it anymore. thanks"
