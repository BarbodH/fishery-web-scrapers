2747041,The Donger,2014-05-01 13:04:00,48,I have been looking at the Outpost Camp at Woman River for a possible trip in the future. Do you see many other boats there or is it pretty secluded. Looking for a fly-in type experience at a lower cost. Any insight on the Outpost Camp would be appreciated.
2747865,Bakefish,2014-05-01 15:26:00,1077,"It's a river system. You will see boats. Not as many as farther south, but you will see them. There's a nice smallmouth reef almost in front of the cabin that is somewhat popular."
2748889,prov1800,2014-05-01 18:58:00,5010,"If you can drive in its going to be busy, thought there was a recession going on.ive never seen it so busy.everywhere I fish is busy and the boats are getting bigger, and then they travelling farther now to places I used to have to myself.try north star lodge.only camp on the lake and 28 miles long, there you can find some room also lost bay resort you'd think your the ones fishing it.thats cause the w alleyes are tough to get but they can get huge in there.great muskie, bass, lake trout.great lake if you want to hunt for w alleyes.well worth it.decent prices."
2750833,Lundyrig,2014-05-02 09:48:00,3,"You will see other boats on the system, the Woman River chain is book ended with resorts at either end. However because the outpost is directly in the center of the system we did not see anyone after 5pm. I would expect that you would see 3-5 boats per day, and we never had another boat approach the areas we were fishing in. We enjoy the remoteness of the outpost without the cost or weight restrictions that accompany a fly in."
2754113,MikeinMN,2014-05-03 10:20:00,190,"I stayed at Woman Lake Lodge 2 years ago. That is around 20 miles or so upriver from Woman River. Swain Post is a couple miles still further up the system. There are other boats pretty much everywhere on that system, but it was by no means crowded anywhere I went, and a lot of the time we fished and boated we were alone. That said, this lake is the closest to a fly in as far as scenery, wildlife, and general feel as I have experienced personally. The fishing however was what I consider poor while we were there, but most guests where we stayed were yearly regulars and claimed the fishing was usually much better. We caught less than 20 walleyes per day between 4 of us. We caught around 5 large pike (14-18 pounds or 36-40 inches) during the week, as well as a few smallmouth bass and perch. There are lots of places to explore by boat on that system and I think all the lodges have portage lakes. There are also many hazards in the form of rocks. I did see some hazards were marked on the south end, but further north there were no markers. I think Woman Lake and points north are more primitive accomodations than Woman River and points south."
2755705,Guest,2014-05-04 04:24:00,0,donnger we stayed at woman river camp last 2 years in mid September paul and Debbie are good hosts and very helpful in my opinion the better fishing is about 1 hr north of main camp at outpost camp (stayed there last year) outdoor showers and odd house must have gps very tricky 1 hr boat ride with many islands can easily get lost;our best walleye fishng was about 1/2 north of outpost camp at narrow lake (about 15 minute portage walk) worth the trip went 2x during week:their price is good but our group is tired of cooking and our going to a camp (3 meals included) further north the last week of may hope this helps jim wolf the Chicago boys
554661,verlund,2006-02-15 12:42:00,32,"Can anyone give me any feedback on Woman River Camp outside of Ear Falls? Looking for anyone who has stayed there in the past couple of years. How are the accomodations, fishing, etc. Thinking of booking a week in July. I did a search in the archives and did not find alot of feedback on it. Any you could provide would be greatly appreciated."
554671,Guest,2006-02-16 10:09:00,0,"I fished at woman river a couple of times, once with canada north and once with paul at woman river camp. I enjoyed the fishing both times, we had good success for walleyes and pike. I am heading back to woman river camp again this year, I just need to pick some dates. I didn't like canada north because they were very impersonable, paul was great he gave us fishing spots, check with us at the dock every morning and then again when we returned from fishing. It was a great place. The cabins were very nice. I'm sure whenever you go you will have good fishing, because its on a river system. You will like your choice."
554717,Guest,2006-02-19 10:41:00,0,"I have been to woman river camp 4 times, once with the old owners and 3 times with paul. It has been a great place to take my grandkids. We catch tons of walleye and the cabins are very nice. You will love it, my family does."
554724,Guest,2006-02-19 18:36:00,0,"Again on the board, will be going to WRC the 2nd week of June for the first time. General advice appreciated. Paul has been great to work with on email and phone last fall. Hints on walleye fishing very helpful. thanks, Pella Dutch"
554737,verlund,2006-02-20 13:15:00,32,Thanks to all that have replied. Sounds like fishing is pretty good there plus I won't have to worry much about alot of fishing pressure. I have been going to Lac Seul for the last few years and wanted a change this year. I am looking for more seclusion. How far do you have to go from camp to get on fish? Steve
1532936,ricksiewert,2013-02-03 17:30:00,5,"Looking at WRC this summer. I am looking to take my 3 kids (under 16) and another dad will take his son (11). Would appreciate the chance to talk to someone as i probably have more questions than can be addressed on this thread. We have been to quite a few places in Canada. It's so hard to compare lodges by pictures and internet sites?Thanks for any help,Rick[email protected]"
2744465,bushead11,2014-04-30 21:57:00,151,"Its been about a year since anyone posted about woman river camp. our group is heading up may 24-31st. This will be our third trip to the body of water but first with paul and Debbie. First trip was mid august in 2010, second was early july 2012. Wondering if anyone who has fished woman river in the past would be willing to share some knowledge as to how conditions and tactics will change this early in the season...? Thanks in advance fellas!"
2744873,HeHooksHimself,2014-05-01 05:15:00,725,"We have fished with Paul and Debbie several times. Early in the year, depending on spawn cycles, you will be able to catch a lot of walleye in the first and second narrows. You have the option to travel up to Big Woman Lake for some lakers or big walleye. Be sure to stop in Little Woman Lake for some smallies, they are thick there. ""The Refrigerator""be another hot spot. Paul and Debbie are great hosts and are really interested in your fishing success. Good luck and Fish On!"
2746321,Lundyrig,2014-05-01 09:28:00,3,"This will be our second year at WRC, excellent Walleye fishing both in numbers and size. Paul and Debbie are fantastic hosts and will provide you with the active spots for fish and what they are biting on. In fact our only struggle was catching Walleyes small enough to keep for our eaters. But I will take that problem any day of the week. Our group stayed at the outpost cabin last year so I cant speak to daily life at the main camp."
