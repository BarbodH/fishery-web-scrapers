4642249,SILVER MINNOW BAIT SHOP,2016-03-16 12:44:00,18,"From the list that ""adempsey"" posted I can say that you would have an excellent time at either Thunder Hook/Smooth Rock camp or Mattice lake. I have not been to either personally but deal with hundreds of guests per year who stop for bait on there way and have heard nothing but good things about both. There are other fly ins up in Armstrong also that you may want to look at: Wilderness North Ogoki Frontier Due North Josh"
4642265,ted wick,2016-03-16 12:47:00,1,"Canadian Fly-in Fishing - Red Lake Ontario is an excellent option. I have used their services for about 20 years. Reasonably priced, great cabins (10 camps on 7 lakes) and great walleye and northern fishing. It is easy to catch 100 walleyes plus each day per fisherman. Call Diane at: 800-445-4624. See www.canadianflyinfishing.net. Note: I am not an employee of theirs. Ted Wick - South Dakota"
4642641,sanclemente,2016-03-16 14:33:00,2,"Lawrence Bay Lodge on Reindeer Lake, SK is kid friendly and relatively inexpensive. My buddy caught a 51"" pike last August on a big black streamer fly as his 14 year old son watched. Go to www.lawrencebay.com for info. If you need more info, the lodge can give you my e-mail or phone number. Bob"
4643289,yoopertrout,2016-03-16 18:16:00,1172,"M wife and I did a fly-out with Kabeelo Outfitters, loved it, and are going back this year. Excellent fishing, and a tightly run operation. IM me if you have questions."
4645193,digjig,2016-03-17 12:49:00,146,"I am partial to Showalters Fishing ( http://www.fishshowalters.com ). I've been out with them 3 times to 3 different camps. They have about a dozen camp offerings. They also discount kids with a paid adult. Good camps, great pilots, family run business. I believe Eddy spends the winters in Wisconsin."
4645417,bullhockey,2016-03-17 14:18:00,41,"I would go to white river air!! Have been on and off since the mid 60's. Great camps, swell people, low rates for kids, and naturally great fishing. Been on alot of their lakes abnd haven't found a dud yet."
4645753,drlee,2016-03-17 15:43:00,409,"I really like Slate Falls Outposts in Sioux Lookout, Ontario. We flew into Lake St. Joseph and never, ever, have I caught so many walleyes and northerns. May seem pricy, but you will get your $ worth. Have a great time wherever you decide to go!"
4650401,pikeman14,2016-03-19 09:15:00,144,I would add halleys camps to the checklist. Excellent all around.
4640505,helle29260,2016-03-15 22:07:00,4,"Calling all experienced fly-in fisherman. Here is the skinny. I am an avid fisherman who would like to do a fly-in. Where do I start. There are literally hundreds and hundreds of options. Anyone had a great experience? I would like to take my 3 boys, 14, 12 and 10 and my father-in-law who is 66. Any insight would be greatly appreciated. We live in WI it that helps. As far a budget goes I have 3 boys so there goes that idea. We can pretty much go whenever. Thanks!"
4640561,adempsey,2016-03-15 23:04:00,963,"I can probably list a bunch, but I'll start with these:Thunderhook's Smoothrock Camp and OutpostsChildren between Age 6 and 12 will receive a 50% discount and Age 13-18 a 25% discount (with minimum 2 full adult fares).Chimo Lodge and OutpostsChildren 14 and under are $200 off (~20%).Excellent Adventures Cat Island Lodge and OutpostsOperate a fly-in lodge and many outposts camps. They offer a discount for a family trip for July & August and pay only half per person rate for each child.White River AirA lot great outpost camps. Excellent rates and 50% off children <16.Mattice Lake OutfittersAlso many great outpost camps. They offer 20% off for children up to 15 years old when accompanied by 2 adults who are paying the regular rate (July 6 through August 16).Northern Wilderness OutfittersOperate many outpost camps. For younger fishermen under the age of 18 there will be a discount of $300 (~25%). (ie. A party of 4-5 adults and 2 younger anglers would pay the 4-5 person rate less $300 for each younger angler. Hidden Bay LodgeOperates a lodge and some outposts. Has various family discounts depending on where you go.Whoops, more than I planned on listing.I highly recommend checking out Mike Borger's website and his fishing reports. He has several reports from family trips."
4640657,acplumber,2016-03-16 04:18:00,80,Our first fly in was to Percy lake out of nakina with Leuenbergers They have great rates for kids/families You would have to contact them to see what they would be able to do The fishing is awesome!! U don't have to go far and it's got a really nice beach in front of the cabin We plan on going back sometime in the future
4640681,wallydave,2016-03-16 04:29:00,2151,"Give Hidden Bay Lodge a look, they put you up the night before the flight, all of the food is included, steaks, chops, bacon eggs, plus cookies and pie for the kids. Great customer service, top notch plane and pilots too. The cabin on Miniss was nice, indoor plumbing and 3 bedrooms. The fishing was very good too, even off the dock at night! Check out the links posted above! Happy surfing!"
4640873,prov1800,2016-03-16 06:33:00,5010,As you said to many options.i can only recommend places i have personally been to. Wilderness air in vermilion bay is a top notch outfit with some great lakes and there cabins are all new. Big canon lake lodge is a full american plan lodge.and cant go wrong there. Clarkes northern lights resort also would fit the bill. hopefully you will find something that still has availability at thiscstage in the game.
4640889,Stehle1,2016-03-16 06:38:00,22,"You might want to setup a decision matrix that will fit your needs. As you pointed out, there are hundreds of options for a fly in experience in Canada and they all offer similar experiences but not quite the same. For example, fish species available may be very important to you where driving distance to catch the flight may not. I did this several years ago when switching camps and ended up with a really nice selection (Expeditions North). There are three other camps on the lake we are on (Nagagami near Hornepayne) and only one of which is similar to our camp in relation to all the criteria (Housekeeping vs. American plan in the end). A plug for this lake is that there are several Walleye well over 18"". It is not uncommon to hear of a fish over 30"" caught and released. My largest has been 29.5"" (seriously couldn't make it any longer). Pike and perch fishing is also available. Good luck"
4641153,phishfearme,2016-03-16 08:02:00,1242,consider kearns lake - shorter drive and incredible comfort. see trip report at:https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...ht=kearns+lake there's also two more recent reports and there's a cabin video at:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrK6eIBH668 phish

4641809,grindstone,2016-03-16 10:45:00,201,"Moose Point Lodge. We have love the owners and the lake. The owners Brad and Donna have a son Josh about 12 years old. My buddies and I bring a group, 18 this year, that includes kids and some afternoons the boys stay in camp and mess around on the kayaks or the water trampoline. The lake has been managed as catch and consume for the 16 years since we made it our ""home"" and is a tremendous fishery. Great food and facilities and wonderful people. My son and I have made this trip since the summer he turned 16 and he'll be 31 this year. Moose Point uses NWO who flies meticulously maintained Otters a consideration when flying the family. My boat 48"" northern ( son) 20""small mouth and a 29"" walleye (both mine) were our big fish last year. We'll have periods where you can't get a 1/4 oz jig to the bottom in 13 FOW when you open the bail. Finding eater size, 15"" - 17"" walleye for lunch can be a challenge (in a good way) on many mornings. I love SM and this lake is full of willing bronze bass. While I don't target northern big ones are all over. I fish a lot of places and this is far and away my all time favorite trip."
4642049,adempsey,2016-03-16 11:44:00,963,"I never thought about owners children being around. That can actually make a fly-in trip even more special, some new buds for your kids to hang with! Of the fly-in lodges I've been to, the owners of Buck and Bingwood have two sons around the age of yours. The owners stayed at the Buck cabins when we were there. It's a nice camp with great equipment, reasonable rates and decent fishing. They fly out of Hornepayne, which is just north of White River."
