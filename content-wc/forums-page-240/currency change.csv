But anyone who goes on vacation regardless of where it is doesn't want to get hit with hidden costs or unnecessary surprises when they arrive at their destination. That seems to be the issue here. If you guys go out of operation where am I going to fish every summer.
4654889,3M TA3,2016-03-20 21:19:00,2846,"So obi and vbay. If I booked 3 months ago with my lodge at say $1000 Canadian, I expect to be charged $1000 Canadian when I arrive. Whether the exchange goes up or down is irrelevant and the risk (+ or -) is all mine. I still pay in Canadian funds. I don't get what all the burble is all about. Same goes for US funds."
4655225,Obabikon,2016-03-21 06:12:00,2370,"3M... I completely agree. However, there are many people here who view resorts that charge in US like they are fleecing their guests. We make all this extra money from the exchange rate, and are basically stealing from our guests. Which is 100% false. This shouldn't be an issue at all. The difference in the two is simply what you pay in, and who accepts the risks (good or bad) of the exchange rate. Now, in this thread's example, anyone who bounces back and forth, or doesn't adjust their pricing when they exchange... is cheating the system. Not overly ethical to raise your prices by 30%, and claim it's just because you're switching currencies. THAT is a way to steal from guests, (in my opinion)."
4655385,Golden Eagle,2016-03-21 06:55:00,2642,"The exchange rate is so far down on my list of concerns, regarding fishing in Canada, that I'll never live long enough to give it thought."
4655433,prov1800,2016-03-21 07:01:00,5010,Great attitude.
4656185,tv4fish,2016-03-21 10:35:00,2694,"AGREED - It's just a fact (that changes from year to year). The exchange rate is what it is each year. It's just an ""added bonus"" if it is in ""our"" (US) favor - it sure as heck won't stop our trips........"
4632145,kriplur,2016-03-12 15:49:00,37,"Attended the all Canada show in Chicago area, picked up a few resort brochures that we might be interested in going to this year and also signed up at the sunset country booth for resort info. to be mailed to me. a resorts, that I won't name, brochure from the show stated that the rates were in Canadian funds. The brochure rec'd in the mail stated rates were in American funds. They changed the currency in a matter of 5 weeks in the brochure. Could have cause a lot of hard feelings if we would have booked our trip and sent in our deposit based on Canadian funds and found out later that the rates were in American, an approx. 30% hit . Never have seen this before. Buyer be ware. What would you have done ?"
4632593,Obabikon,2016-03-12 20:09:00,2370,"An honest business man would honor all bookings in Canadian currency. If they're upfront and informative about the change... its their decision. Anytime you just swap from Canadian to US currencies and don't adjust what you're charging... you're cheating the system. It wouldn't be a big deal if they lowered their price 25-30% and then stated we are now charging in US. Unfortunately, it doesn't sound like that happened."
4647265,martinbns,2016-03-18 06:29:00,1520,"As a Canadian, the vast majority of Northern resorts post the prices in US funds for us as well. Probably a mistake, FWIW, the Canadian dollar has appreciated from about 70 cents US to 77 in the last few weeks."
4647697,prov1800,2016-03-18 09:24:00,5010,Things sure have changed.i can remember when all camps charged in canadian dollars.then slowly as these camps were bought up by americans they slowly starting charging in US.if a cdn owned a camp down the road and still charged in cdn funds they would be loosing money compared to the us owned camp so it didnt take long for every one to change over.but like someone said if you were quoted and cdn price this quote should be honered.i think the whole thing sucks.the other thing that sucks is there making a killing on the exchange but they also pay all there staff in cdn.guides get paid in cdn but guests are charged in US for that service.its all about business.but dollar for dollar your not loosing anything.Us on the other are taking a beating on our trips south.
4647937,Obabikon,2016-03-18 10:47:00,2370,"I agree to an extent with you ProV. But, if I had a resort on the other side of the border 99% of my guests would still be American. If you're a Canadian resort, and most of your guests are Canadian... it makes sense to charge in Canadian dollars. But if most of your guests are US, it makes sense to charge in US. For those who booked a trip a couple months ago at a Canadian resort (but didn't pay)... their trip has gotten 10-15% more expensive since they booked. That's why charging in US for US guests makes sense."
4648041,prov1800,2016-03-18 11:28:00,5010,The area i live in (vermilion bay) has 99% Us traffic right up to red lake.very little cdn traffic.if they do book here they get charged us as well.not sure about the cdn border camps.mostly groups of guys coming so if your paying fo your own pkg its still fairly cheap trip for most either way.family trips could get expensive but most holidays are.but fishing trips are definatly worth it.
4652969,yoopertrout,2016-03-20 08:32:00,1172,"It could be that they used to charge Canadian funds when the exchange rate was close to even, had to change when the Canadian dollar fell, and then accidentally brought old brochures. I agree, though, that if I had booked and then found out, I'd be upset."
4653041,pjshorthorn,2016-03-20 08:49:00,5654,IDK. Some US clients may feel that their overall cost of using a camp that charges in Loonies will still be cheaper than one that charges in US dollars ; even if the Loonies continues to appreciate a little more. PjShorthorn :rock-on:

4653993,Obabikon,2016-03-20 15:50:00,2370,"How's that? The trip that they booked has gotten 10-15% more expensive than it was at the time they booked it. That's factual information. There's no ""benefit"". It HURT them from the time they booked until now. The ""benefit"" of the exchange rate HURT the guests and owners charging in US over the past two months. The only difference between a resort that charges in US and a resort that charges in Canadian is who assumes the risk/reward of the exchange rate. If it drops... its bad, if it goes up... its good. Charging in Canadian protects the owner from those fluctuations. Also... please don't say ""but its still 30%"". Because the two currencies are not based on par. Just like the peso and yen... as used in previous examples."
