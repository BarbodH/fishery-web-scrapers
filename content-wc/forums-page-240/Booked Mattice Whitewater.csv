4376313,Eric.hallagan,2015-12-13 19:53:00,32,Thanks Jveri for the info! And pike - when Mike settles down with his hectic schedule he will hook us up!
4392057,pikeman14,2015-12-21 17:10:00,144,"I just received MLO's christmas news letter in the mail today.....first page was Mike Borger holding up a couple of giants! I had to laugh, I hope they threw in a free trip for you! Congratulations"
4392257,Mike Borger,2015-12-21 18:54:00,1554,I gave Don a bunch of my pic's to use. Hopefully my ugly mug doesn't scare people away.
4414065,Eric.hallagan,2015-12-31 13:45:00,32,"Yeah- I have Mike hanging on my fridge too- needless to say I'm loosing weight, for some reason my appetite isn't as it what it was- just joking Mike they are great pics"
4414089,Eric.hallagan,2015-12-31 13:50:00,32,Hey bud- when did you guys go?
4617217,SILVER MINNOW BAIT SHOP,2016-03-07 17:50:00,18,You cant go wrong with Mattice! Don and Annette are very good people! And the fishing is always good up there! Josh
4619225,SILVER MINNOW BAIT SHOP,2016-03-08 11:15:00,18,"Hi Juls,Hi,Just realized that one of my posts was removed for ""advertising"" on this thread. So my question is how do I go about advertising on the site and what are the costs associated?Thanks,Josh"
4619569,Pikeslayer8,2016-03-08 12:28:00,1460,"I like what Silver Minnow Bait Shop (cool name) brings to this forum. Good to get his perspective. Hey Josh, If Walleye Central doesn't want your advertising, better idea, advertise on the new Canada Fishing Guide magazine."
4620041,SILVER MINNOW BAIT SHOP,2016-03-08 14:55:00,18,Just checked it out...might be a good idea!
4358281,Eric.hallagan,2015-12-04 17:48:00,32,That's big water- so I hope I can find some of our own hotspots too! but i better start cutting weight to speed up the boat! Just in case we strike out on our own he he
4358345,Mike Borger,2015-12-04 18:05:00,1554,"Just kidding, it's a huge body of water, you guys will love it!"
4358561,Eric.hallagan,2015-12-04 19:33:00,32,looking forward to it! now I just have to scale my tackle box back down to the fly in size!!
4367025,michigan walleye guy,2015-12-09 08:31:00,95,"I believe I've read that Mattice Lake Outfitters pretty much lets you fly in whatever you want (within reason, I'm sure) without incurring extra costs. That is yet another reason to fly with them! Can anybody concur?"
4367489,Ogoki,2015-12-09 11:09:00,291,"Mattice does not charge for extra weight but I think Don EXPECTS everyone to be resonable. Another reason to go with Mattice , is that he is charging in Canadian funds . From what I can find online , everyone else at Armstrong is charging in US funds . I have used their services many times and plan to continue . Booked for nextJune and deposit is paid."
4368137,Mike Borger,2015-12-09 16:10:00,1554,"Yes and yes on both counts.Every man has a breaking point but I can tell you that in my two trips to MLO Don never blinked an eye about our mountain of gear and was nothing but gracious.And yes, he's one of the few in that region that charges in Canadian funds."
4368497,pikeman14,2015-12-09 18:36:00,144,"Hey Eric! We are booked the 18-25 of June at whitewater. What are the chances you are the same? Our group of 4 was just talking it over about how different a fly in trip will be with other cabins. We thought it would be great if everyone was willing to share tips over a campfire. Ive also been chatting with Wilderness north. They have a great amount of info on the lake. But, nothing compares to Mike Borgers reviews and videos. Thanks again Mike."
4368521,pikeman14,2015-12-09 18:43:00,144,Whitewater map
4370041,jveri,2015-12-10 13:32:00,70,I attached a map showing a few hot spots on whitewater. The line on the bottom of the map is a sand bar that runs across the bottom end of the lake from just west of the camp. We trolled up and down the edge of it morning and night and picked up walleyes and pike on jerkbaits and jog head and plastics. The top two circles are some faster moving water that always seem to produce for our group whether high or low water. The other circles are just small islands to the north and northeast of camp that we always troll and produce for us as well.
4376305,Eric.hallagan,2015-12-13 19:52:00,32,"Hey brother! I am looking forward to meeting you, we share all out info and want everyone to catch fish- there is no way that we could cover and even reasonable amount of area- we should be on fish all week- there is 10 of us so we will be looking to share stories over a cold one ! Can't wait! Eric"
3958273,sauvain,2015-06-11 20:46:00,63,"After lots of research for my wife's first fly-in I settled on Whitewater lake Lodge with Mattice Outfitters. Emailed Don several times, then he said why don't I call you. He took 15 minutes between flights to explain several options. Just felt Whitewater was a fly-in with the comforts of home. We will be going with a great couple who enjoy fishing also. Going to Lac Seul with my 14 yr. Old July 18, his first trip...and better yet with my 74 yr old dad.July 9th 2016 will be a trip to Whitewater with my bride of 32 years, secretly hoping it leads to a yearly trip! Hope we made a great decision. I will tell you Don answered all my questions and what I have read about Mattice is true so far."
3958825,jveri,2015-06-12 06:39:00,70,You are going to love it. I am hopefully going back there next June as well. Don and Annette run a top notch operation. Next year will be my 8th trip with them to Whitewater although we may switch it up and try the ogoki reservoir.
3972714,sauvain,2015-06-16 18:40:00,63,To the top....
3973146,chris.brock,2015-06-16 20:33:00,112,Whitewater is awesome. MLO is top notch. Great decision IMO.
4347361,Eric.hallagan,2015-11-29 09:44:00,32,I am heading to whitewater the middle of June in 2016- any tips on what worked well for you when you have went in the past? Looking forward to a great time- thanks Eric
4348265,pikeman14,2015-11-29 19:45:00,144,"Hey eric, which week are you going? Our group will be at whitewater the 18th-25th. Hopefully we can find a pattern quickly. There's a lot of water to cover."
4355393,Eric.hallagan,2015-12-03 12:35:00,32,"Crazy stuff! So are we- there will be 10 of us! I'm looking forward to it, hopefully we can put some true giants into the boat! Looking forward to meeting you !"
4355545,Mike Borger,2015-12-03 13:26:00,1554,You guys are all going at the same time? So if I mark a map who should I send it to? LOL!
4357969,Eric.hallagan,2015-12-04 16:00:00,32,I'll just make extra copie for their camp Mike ! lol
4358065,Mike Borger,2015-12-04 16:35:00,1554,"I can picture it now, 6 boats all racing to fish the same tiny bay LOL!"
