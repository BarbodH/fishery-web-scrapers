4633809,Obabikon,2016-03-13 12:16:00,2370,"Only if they're providing services in a package. Which usually is not the case. Cooking, transportation, fish cleaning, guiding, daily maid service..."
4607025,Pooch,2016-03-04 06:13:00,4619,"I just got back a letter from the Canada Revenue Agency telling me there was not tax rebate on last years three trips. Nothing on the trips has changed from past trips. Wonder why now they do not qualify?Anyone else get this ""rejection"" from last summers trips? Not a big deal, but curious as to what changed.Pooch"
4607513,phishfearme,2016-03-04 08:50:00,1242,"pooch - only thing I can think of (which happened to us a few years back) was that the receipt did not clearly specify the second ""service"" over and above the short term accommodations necessary to qualify for the HST rebate. were they from the same outfitter? just curious - did they return the original receipts with the rejection notice? they never returned ours a few years ago. I would check that the receipts clearly specify the second service (over and above the short term accommodations) - and if not then ask the outfitter for a clearer receipt - then resubmit. phish"
4613217,Bill Krejca,2016-03-06 15:11:00,6107,"If the ""services"" are noted on the receipt, it maybe could just be a matter of resubmitting, hoping for a different processing clerk who has a more favorable opinion on what constitutes legitimate requirements for a refund. It can be surprising how folks in the same department (any department, anywhere) can view things in a different light. Give it a try and let us know. Bill"
4615225,Obabikon,2016-03-07 08:43:00,2370,"You can also ask the resort for a new receipt stating the services on it. Also, make sure it is marked ""paid"""
4621393,Pooch,2016-03-08 20:44:00,4619,"Originally sent in three receipts fro three trips last summer. Two were ""rejected"" and today received a check from Canadian government for the only trip where we also rented camp boats and were brought into camp via camps transportation.Two trips that were turned down, we had our own boats. Seems that makes the difference.Pooch"
4621753,pjshorthorn,2016-03-09 05:29:00,5654,"Pooch, My guess is that you received a rebate for the last trip because transportation was provided by the camp. I'm not sure renting camp boats qualify as a service. PjShorthorn"
4622009,v-bay gord,2016-03-09 07:38:00,3168,"As has been stated, your invoice needs to specify an eligible service that was included in your package. Whether you rent a boat or not isn't important."
4623145,Pooch,2016-03-09 13:33:00,4619,What are eligible services?Pooch
4623177,v-bay gord,2016-03-09 13:45:00,3168,"Here's what the form says:An eligible tour package is a tour package that is sold for an all-inclusive price and includes:  short-term and/or camping accommodation in Canada; and  at least one service. My eligible service is that fish cleaning is included in my package. If transportation, guide service etc is included in the package price then these should be eligible services as well. Once again they need to be included as part of the package.....and not a separate line item. The invoice should make note of what eligible service meets the requirement for the rebate. In my case I have a text box that states ""fish cleaning is included in the package for purposes of the GST rebate"". This has worked for my guests."
4624993,BornToFish,2016-03-10 06:42:00,1224,"In addition to fish cleaning, I have been to a fishing lodge that used boat safety training as an eligible service. The lodge owner or a dock hand would spend twenty minutes of so with folks at the dock to discuss safely operating the boat (e.g. adjusting tilt/trim, location of navigational hazards) and launching/docking. The lodge's invoice specifically states fish cleaning and boat safety training as being eligible services. My first year's of seeking reimbursement were something of a crap shoot. It's pretty routine now. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
