Being you are out of Watertown, NY area, I would suggest you go out of the Chapleau area. Many to choose from, some better than others. Have you considered a fly-in? 1) Canadian Airventures (Denis & Val) have a very nice fly-in lodge on Denyes Lake, and fly out of Chapleau. Reasonable, although he does charge in U.S. dollars. 2) Consider a Fly-in Outpost. Air-Dale (Park's Fly-n Fishing) has multiple outpost camps for you to pick from at a very reasonable cost. Party of 4 for $1,000. plus Tax (CDN). They would be flying out of Wawa, ON. Good Luck"

4265706,MrSimon,2015-10-15 09:24:00,922,"I also live in PA (southeastern between Philly and Lancaster) and have made dozens of trips into Canada over the years. I've got two suggestions for you: 1) Before going deep into Canada and spending a lot of money, at least consider the close and cheap option of fishing in NY. You can drive 7 hours and fish the St. Lawrence River and Black Lake. Both are fantastic fisheries and offer a wide variety of water, species, and scenery. There are plenty of places to stay. I've stayed at the Outboard Inn on Black Lake, and trailered 10 mins to the St. Lawrence for big walleye.www.outboardinn.com 2) If you are willing to drive 20 hours, there are literally hundreds of drive to lodges in Ontario that can offer superb walleye fishing ... we're talking 10 fish per HOUR, not per week. Do your research by reading a LOT on this site. Get a feel for the type of experience you want and start asking more specific questions. You'll get lots of advice and I'm sure you'll find a great lodge for your group. Also, don't rule out a fly-in. There are some amazing outfitters within 20 hours of you and some have prices that are comparable to drive-ins."
4616113,SILVER MINNOW BAIT SHOP,2016-03-07 12:33:00,18,"If you willing to drive to Thunder Bay, Ontario I can lead you in the right direction to some amazing fisheries. As many have said on here already, you should be catching quite a bit more than 5-10 walleye per week and I can definitely get you to some lakes which I can almost guarantee you will produce much higher numbers. Send me a PM or give me a call at 807-632-6572 if you want some advice on this area of Canada. Josh"
4616785,north560,2016-03-07 15:28:00,53,"Check out Gow-Bush-Kon Lodge. Great walleye fishing,lots small mouth (no closed season), pike,perch and lake trout."

4259370,gaspumper,2015-10-12 12:08:00,73,If your on Bobs Lake after walleye you should put some effort into trying for crappie one of the best lakes in the area for them.
4259706,Bowtech84,2015-10-12 14:42:00,572,Fished between the town bridge in Grand Rapids to the boundary below the dam. Also fished cedar lake. Slower bite on cedar but a lot bigger fish.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
4259778,fishron,2015-10-12 15:16:00,317,"PB, My group has a long time fishing tradition in Wolfe lake, only a short distance below Bobs Lake. We fished Bobs once out of Nordlaw Lodge and found good bass fishing but to my knowledge, Bob's walleye population was due to walleye stocking. Over the years we have experienced large swings in our catch rate on Wolfe. Its a crystal clear lake that can be a challenge but when the conditions were right, we could catch 50 fish per man a week, sometimes more. Our recent trip was tough. As a group we probably caught 40 walleye. We talked to trusted people that claimed it had been one of the best years with good bites throughout the season. We just hit an off week. You could check with McCoullochs cabins and see if their still renting. The walleye bite really comes on as the water cools. I could give you some spots if you choose to try it. The problem with your location in PA, where we are also from, is that the great walleye fishing in NW Ontario is two days drive away. For fantastic walleye action we have been fishing a fly-in.....Lac Hebert in Quebec. It's a fifteen to sixteen hour drive and our present five day cabin, good boat and fuel will run about a thousand for the trip. The walleye fishing is fantastic, but it's a summer thing. It's early winter up there now by PA standards. Check Hebert out on the web and try to make a trip. I've fished many other places in Ontario and Quebec. Some great walleye fishing areas. Hebert makes it easy."
4260426,ftfarms,2015-10-12 19:58:00,444,Thanks I've always wanted to fish that area. Maybe some day.
4261146,retire55,2015-10-13 08:37:00,1029,"I'm unsure as to why you would not consider walleye fishing in the province of Quebec. There's satisfactory walleye fishing (drive to) available in the Abitibi T√©miscaming area of north western Quebec. Drive time from Allentown, PA (I just picked a spot in southern PA) to the town of T√©miscaming, Quebec is 11 hours. Distance is 650 miles. Search this site or Google for lakes like Kipawa, Sasseginaga, Ogascanan, Pomeroy, Dumoine, Lac des Quinze or Reservoir Decelles."
4262930,pb566265,2015-10-13 19:00:00,6,Though about a Quebec trip but was looking into Ontario first considering we already have the cards and licenses. But having all the suggested lakes so far being pretty much western Ontario we are definitely going to look into it.
4263098,rather-be-fishin,2015-10-13 20:35:00,429,What about the Bay of Quinte? Have heard there are many trophy walleye to be caught especially in the Fall.
4263498,fishron,2015-10-14 06:38:00,317,"At this point in the season, most of the Northern Ontario and Quebec lodges and camps have shut it down for the season. That's why I mentioned Wolfe as a possibility. Wolfe is a natural walleye lake and the fishfinder dose'nt lie. Anyone who has fished walleye has seen walleye schools that are unique in their appearance. Wolfe has a tremendous walleye population. Just not always on the bite as a wilderness lake might be. As a southern Pennsylvania group of fishermen we have fished the Cabonga reservoir in Quebec many times. About a twelve and a half hour drive for us. We've had great trips but two factors remain. It takes a couple of trips to learn the lake. The drawdowns that the province did several times on Cabonga completely pulled the rug out on our learned areas. The bay of Quinte certainly has the reputation for producing huge walleye. We have taken giants from Oswego harbor off Lake Ontario in New York on many occasions. Great fish if you like to take photos or mount one but not the walleyes you want on the dinner plate. The biggest bag of giant walleye I have ever seen in my life came from a flow between islands visible as you cross the Thousand island bridge. For numbers and sustainable fisheries, remoteness seems to be the biggest factor. As I stated, that fishery is nearly closed for the season."
4263562,Shellback,2015-10-14 07:11:00,8083,"Been fishing out of Gananoque for the past 6 years. Mostly targeting yellow perch, that's what the wife likes. Perch fishing has fallen off the past couple years, but the walleye fishing is picking up. Closing a cottage 2 weeks ago, I picked up a nice 20"" walleye in the area you spoke of. Had a 28""+ down on the 40 acres shoal in June."
4257946,Carnhzkr,2015-10-11 18:47:00,964,"It would help to know where you live or where you prefer to cross into Ontario. Pembina? International Falls? Pigeon River? Soo St Marie? I'm also curious about where you've been going and how you prefer to fish. If your goal is to up your weekly tally of walleyes, you've come to the right place. Not to sound like a jerk, but if you're only catching 5 - 10 walleye in a week, you're not doing it right."
4257954,Elrik,2015-10-11 19:08:00,82,With 5-10 a week numbers it sounds like he is fishing in the greater Toronto area where the stocks are low and pressure is high. Canada is freaking huge need more specifics of where you are driving from before we can tell you where you should go
4257970,rather-be-fishin,2015-10-11 19:28:00,429,"I agree with Lambertson Rock Guy post above wondering if this is a joke??? Catching only 5-10 Walleyes a week? If it's not a joke, I also recommend a trip to Lac Seul & everything said in the post above.....it's a Walleye factory! I have fished the NW end of the lake near Ear Falls, ON. There are many drive to resorts to research: Onaway, Fisherman's Cove, Lac Seul Lodge, Evergreen, Goose Bay, White Wing, Gawley's, Gold Pines, Timberlane, Golden Eagle, CherRob. Excellent tip to hire a guide the first day to learn safe travel routes (there are many hidden unmarked hazards), areas to fish & techniques & then the rest of your trip will be a success. Until you experience Lac Seul Walleye fishing, you won't believe it! 9 months to go and the count down is on to our return trip to Lac Seul! üé£‚ù§Ô∏èüòÅ"
4258098,tyeegs,2015-10-11 21:04:00,177,Red lake area is great. I've fished Five Lakes Lodge on Gulf Rock Lake for the past few years with great success. Plus Red Lake has a Tim Horton's which really rounds out the Canada experience.
4258106,Bowtech84,2015-10-11 21:07:00,572,"Might be too long of a drive but if not try Grand Rapids Manitoba! 2 anglers 200 eater walleye an hour if you don't pause to put bait on every drop. Not kidding, wear gloves!Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
4258282,ftfarms,2015-10-12 05:31:00,444,You fishing cedar lake or Winnipeg catching that many?
4258674,SeulAreaWalleye,2015-10-12 08:45:00,100,"Again, not to be offensive here but 5-10 walleye per week makes me think that it may be the way that you target the fish. Maybe there are lakes this slow, as being on Lac Seul or any lake in NW Ontario makes this hard to imagine. I have met a few groups in my time that were fishing on great walleye water for many years but hardly catching a thing. Once they hired myself, they had simply learned that it was only about poor technique and presentations. They now return, do things themselves and produce much better. Wherever you go, hire a pro and make sure that you are doing things correct. I assure you that your fishing trip will turn into a catching trip quickly. Good luck, you are overdue for a great walleye slam and trophy fish as well. Good thing that you posted here on WC...excellent advice all around."
4258970,strength22,2015-10-12 10:06:00,49,I would stop going to a lake in Canada if I only caught 10 walleyes a week. I would stop if I didn't get 10 walleyes a day. unless the lake is good and I am doing something wrong which very well could be but I think I could luck into 10 walleye a day on a lake in Canada barring a hurricane rolling through and a monsoon maybe. Try the red lake area...big fan of gullrock. wrights camp is great.
4259226,pb566265,2015-10-12 11:20:00,6,"First, thanks for all the reply's. Second, this is not a joke. Lake is Bob's Lake, about an hour and a half northwest of Watertown, NY. 10-15 years ago we used to catch 3 and 4 a day just does not happen anymore. Very rarely do you catch more than one in the same spot. We are on par with everyone else around the lake. Fishing just isn't what it used to be."
4259266,Stu,2015-10-12 11:35:00,472,"If you live near Watertown, most of the lodges suggested are a long way from you. How far are you willing to drive?"

Definitely want to be a drive in destination. The lake we fish now has what I assume is adequate walleye fishing, about 5-10 per week. We do not want to drive 18 hours for the same fishing we have now. I know anyone can get a bad week but we are looking for something a little better. Any suggestions?"

4257426,pb566265,2015-10-11 12:49:00,6,we catch about 5-10 walleye per week.
4257498,Karloutdoors,2015-10-11 13:41:00,828,"I'll go ahead and say it.....you guys are missing something. Canadian walleye trips should exceed that by a large margin, At any rate, sounds like you're due for a change of scenery. Regardless of where you go, I'd book a guide on the new waters, even if only for a half day. Guides will help identify navigation hazards in/around the areas your lodging and fishing. They should identify the types of structure you should be fishing beyond the actual spots he/she takes you. He/she will also give you at least their primary presentations if not offer alternates for you. Consider perhaps a not so ""off the beaten path' lake to fish. Higher fishing pressure may be likely , I understand, but there is also likely a greater amount of information shared on the web for you to educate yourself prior to actually getting on the water. If you can communicate with the guide prior to traveling he/she can advise you on how to equip yourselves.Conversely, if I were you, after 60 years with 5-10 per week as adequate in your book...I'd say leave ""well enough"" alone and just enjoy that which has brought you enjoyment over those 60 years."
4257538,roscoe33,2015-10-11 14:45:00,653,"I'd like to know what lake you are fishing on. We don't do as well as some of the guys, but barring some sort of major weather event, like ice still on the water, we always catch more than that. We fish the area between Thunder Bay and Ignace, so generally within 150 miles of the Pigeon River border crossing. That said, fall fishing seems to yield fewer, but larger fish."
4257578,NARDA 1,2015-10-11 15:30:00,636,Check out www.birchdalelodge.com 807-227-5262 owners name is Marcel. also www.eagleeyeguiding.com Greg will be able to put you on the fish while you are there.
4257634,BRP,2015-10-11 16:16:00,77,"Anywhere we fish on lake of the woods, 5 to 10 a day in a boat with 2 anglers is pretty much a given. Lots of places to launch in the kenora area, or Sioux narrows"
4257658,bigcreekdad,2015-10-11 16:32:00,74,"Not sure where you are located, but the French River might be a good option. Early season (opener to mid to late June) walleye has been quite good the last several years. I fish out of, and highly recommend, Crane's Lochaven Lodge in the Wolesely Bay area, but there are many lodges in that area of the French, as well as above the Chaudiere dams. An added bonus is the ambience of the French River......I can't get too much of it. Later in the season is slower, but, regardless, I think you could beat 10-15 a week if you were targeting them."
4257746,Lambertson Rock Guy,2015-10-11 17:16:00,20,"Not sure how to reply to this post. Part of me thinks it is a joke. If you are serious drive to any resort on Lac Seul. Ask the owner to point out any hazards and mark a few fishing spots to start on a map. Tie on a jig and a minnow and bounce it off the bottom, moving slowly. If you don;t have 5-10 walleyes in the first hour move to a new spot. Or pull a crawler on a spinner/two hook rig with a bottle bouncer until you make contact. I mention Lac Seul because it is where I go. Sioux Lookout end/Ear Falls end-it doesn't matter. Probably tons of other lakes people can chime in on. I have stayed at Evergreen and Goose Bay on the Ear Falls end. Both are very reasonably priced, clean, and will point you in the right direction. Or hire a guide for the first day. Good Luck"
