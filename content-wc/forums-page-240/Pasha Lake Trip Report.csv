4098953,clearis,2015-08-03 14:22:00,47,"My son and I stayed at Pasha Lake two summers ago. We were able to fish Onaman for a day and a half and wanted to go back every day, but as previously stated the demand for Onaman is high and you take your turn. The other lakes are drive to and suffer from higher fishing pressure. Lake access has its benefits and drawbacks. Northwind Lake has been hit hard the last three years and suffers a bit from the pressure. The other downside was how dirty everything got after driving on gravel roads for four days. I was so impressed with Onaman, that after weighing the lost time in fishing due to travel, the cost of driving, the at times rough and dirty roads and the time to clean the truck and gear, I decided to go with the fly-in option last year (2014) and did it again this year. Last year was a group of 4 and this year, 6 were in the group. I've fished a couple of lakes with greater numbers, but not with both very high numbers and consistently bigger fish. I reserved a spot for next year as I could see that open reservations at Onaman were getting hard to come by. Figured if I need someone to come along, I could find them on WC. Onaman is a walleye lake. If you are looking for numbers of Pike and large ones, look elsewhere. We returned yesterday from Onaman. Two in the party were inexperienced walleye fisherman, one having never caught a walleye before. In seven days, we caught about 850 fish. The rookie, had a 30 and 27. The lake is amazing. It is a great example of what a fishery is capable of when it is respected and protected. Chad at Pasha Lake cabins works hard for his guests, improves his facility every year and does a great job with marketing. If you have your own boat, want to fish Nipigon or try different lakes, this is a great option. However, if you want to fish Onaman, there is another choice that I think provides a better value and an outstanding fishing experience."
4099145,vteye,2015-08-03 15:46:00,812,I spoke with Chad about a drop off trip on lake Nipigon targeting pike. He was accommodating and eager to work with us. My group on the other hand wanted same ole and stayed with a typical fly in.

4082322,briggs12,2015-07-28 08:59:00,5,"Wanted to share my experience, as this was my first time at this place and thought it may help others. First off, this camp is unique but I was expecting that from other posts. Their website is fantastic, the actual experience is not. Fishing was good, but not anything that I haven't experienced at other Canadian lakes. Onaman lake was amazing, but you are only allowed to fish it once or twice while you're there. I was prepared to drive to the lakes, but it was a bit excessive. The nearest lake that we fished was a 25 minute (one way) drive, furthest was an hour on logging roads. The camp office opens at 8, you wait your turn to figure out where you're going, load your gear(which may be a boat/motor) and drive. We didn't wet a line before 9:30 any day. Onaman is a 45 minute drive, followed by a 30 minute hike through the woods(hauling gear, gas, minnows, etc). It was worth it, but there is a fly in camp on the lake. If you want to fish onaman, pay the extra $300 for the week and fish the lake everyday without the drive/hike...Scenery was beautiful. Owners were nice. For the caliber of fishing and cost, you can stay at just about any drive in lake in Canada and not have to drive and haul gear every day. Its not a big deal for the first day or two, but by the end of the week, you're sick of driving especially when you then have to drive home. One nice thing is that you may be the only person on the lake, where you may not experience that at other drive to lakes. Website boasts best walleye fishing on the planet....that's a negative. They do offer a walleye dream trip, that wasn't available when we were there. It doesn't start until end of July I believe, and its an extra $400.I'm not trying to bash this place, just giving my honest experience/opinion. I had a nice vacation, but wouldn't do it again. I'm sure this appeals to a lot of people, but I'd rather walk out to the dock and go fishing. If this place was cheaper than your typical drive in resort, then it changes the game but its not."
4082458,SinOrSwim,2015-07-28 09:42:00,1528,"Wow, that sounds like a TON of work!!!!!! We aren't early risers typically but even WE fish by 8am. Honestly, that does not sound like fun."
4082954,MrSimon,2015-07-28 11:39:00,922,"To each his own. But I agree with you ... it's awful nice to just walk out the cabin whenever you want, get in the boat, and go. On the flip side, the adventure of traveling to bush lakes is fantastic .... but I wouldn't want to do it every day."
4083026,phishfearme,2015-07-28 11:57:00,1242,thanks for the honest report - and the clear heads-up as to what you are in for at this place. this really adds to the value of WC - and welcome to WC. phish
4083170,kcguy68,2015-07-28 12:37:00,51,"A buddy of mine took this trip in June. He reported that by mid week he was exhausted, and I was wondering to myself.....""how could this be""? I had him targeted as a future traveler to the Northland. After he expanded on his experience, I began to understand how he was starting to get burned out. The group he went with has been going up there for 20+ years. They love the experience, and to each their own. I guess I may be spoiled, but I like to hop on a boat and go. It takes 14 hours to drive up to Canada....if I don't see my car for a week, I am fine with that."
4085466,Finshady,2015-07-29 06:05:00,12,"We have been going to the area for 12 years now and have stayed at Pasha Lake Cabins or Bush Lake most years. We enjoy the adventure fishing aspect of the trip as much as the fishing itself. Definitely understandable that the trip can be a little tiring if you are not aware of the requirements before going in. But we enjoy the options of different lakes everyday and most times you are the only one on the lake. We average over 500 fish for the week between 6 guys and are not necessarily putting in effort 100% of the time. Usually on the lake by 11:00am and off by 8:00. To each there own, but I think I would get a little board fishing the same lake everyday. Just my thoughts."
4085690,SinOrSwim,2015-07-29 06:59:00,1528,"I agree, to each their own. If you enjoy that stuff, absolutely do it. I'm the type of person that will use a motor rather than a paddle. LOL I want to hop in the boat and go too. As for fishing a different lake? Meh, I don't know. To a certain degree they all look the same when you are on the water. Trees, rocks and water. They are beautiful but one lake doesn't seem that much different to me. Plus, I'd rather find fish and fish. Not search a new lake all the time. I understand the portaging. But, I wouldn't have any desire to carry gas and everything else to do so. We have gone to Hawk Lake the last couple years. He has a bunch of portage lakes. You walk to them, boat is ready to go. His staff goes to each lake each evening and fills with gas, cleans the boat and makes sure it is ready for the next day. Go out as early as you want or stay as late as you want."
4087042,Carnhzkr,2015-07-29 13:40:00,964,"I looked into Pasha last year for a trip with my son. Onaman River Lodge (I think that's the name), is another lodge in the general vicinity. Both are similar in that they offer other lakes you travel to. They either have boats cached or you can pull your own or one of theirs. Of the two, I was leaning toward ORL because you can fish walleye in the water where that lodge is located. My understanding is there are no walleye in the lake where Pasha sits. There is walleye in the lake across the road from Pasha. I spoke with both owners and both touted Onaman as their prime walleye lake, but as mentioned previously, it's quite a journey to get there. I ultimately decided to spend the extra money and fly into Onaman Lake from Nakina. My son and I had a great trip on Onaman Lake. I'd go back in a second, but I ended up buying my own boat so I'm more interested in pulling my own rig than doing a fly-in. Also it can be hard to find a vacancy on Onaman Lake."
4087050,adempsey,2015-07-29 13:52:00,963,"I think it's a reasonably priced lodge. Definitely requires a specific clientele, but if you want bring your own boat and enjoy fishing some reasonably remote lakes it's probably going to be a good inexpensive trip. There are only a handful of drive-to lodges in Northeastern Ontario that provide that type of experience.Also, comparing it to Hawk Lake Lodge is a bit much. That place is $400 per day vs. $400 to $600 for a week. Apples vs. oranges.Another outfitter that offers boats on Onaman Lake is Onaman River Resort. Also a lodge with good rates IMO. At ORR, you can fish the river, Lake Nipigon or head out to some nearby lakes including Onaman Lake. I have yet to go there, but I think it's also a pretty good deal for what you get."
4087098,SinOrSwim,2015-07-29 14:09:00,1528,Wasn't comparing it in that sense. Just my lazy butt isn't going to be hauling my own gas.
