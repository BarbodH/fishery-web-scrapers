The web site provides easy access to trip reports from various lakes in the Abitibi/TÃ©miscaming area (south western Quebec). This area is approximately 75 miles north east of North Bay, Ontario. Most if not all the lakes provide access to walleye, lake trout and northern pike fishing. While the new 2016 fishing regulations have not yet been released, there are expectations that a new walleye slot limit (harvest limited to walleye between 14.6 and 21 inches) will be implemented 1 April 2016."
4620585,strength22,2016-03-08 17:23:00,49,"How about good walleye fishing in northeast Ontario? Drive in camps. Not break,the bank. Where I live now it is too far to drive to gullrock. Not looking for huge lakes, like size of eagle lake or lac seul is too big for me. Any suggestions would be great and thank you."
4620833,Mike Borger,2016-03-08 18:18:00,1554,Sure. What's your definition on NE Ontario?
4620873,strength22,2016-03-08 18:24:00,49,Well i live in Massachusetts. So east...northeast? I would drive 10 to 15 hours.
4621745,north560,2016-03-09 05:28:00,53,"Check out Gow-Bush-Kon Lodge . Great walleye fishing, lots of small mouth bass, pike, perch and lake trout. Reasonable rates, clean cabins and comfortable boats, 16ft sylvan, 25 4 stroke electric start , fish finder, livewell and padded swivel seats, and all your gas for the week. www.gowbushkon.com"
4622977,Mike Borger,2016-03-09 12:35:00,1554,"Living in Mass you're almost better off looking at Quebec.Easiest one to recommend within QC is the Gouin Reservoir, roughly a 14 hour drive. Many of the camps on the Gouin are fly in, but not all. Baie Du Nord is one: http://www.baiedunord.com/en/propos.shtmlWithin Ontario it's about a 13-14 hour drive to get to Lady Evelyn Lake. There are a number of great outfitters operating there but have heard good things about Ellen Island Camp http://www.ellenislandcamp.com/If you're willing to drive to Chapleau a lot of people seem to love Happy Day Lodge on Windermere Lake. Probably a 17 hour drive give or take: http://www.happydaylodge.com/Personally I consider Nakina NE Ontario. If you're willing to push it a bit and make the 20 hour drive, O'Sullivan's Rainbow has fantastic fishing.http://www.osullivansrainbow.com/"
4623025,north560,2016-03-09 12:51:00,53,"is central northern ontario 12 to 14 hr drive right to the door, great multi-species fishing gow-bush-kon lodge"
4623817,strength22,2016-03-09 17:25:00,49,Thank you for the replies. I am more than willing to go to places in Quebec.....again..good walleye and drive in and not on a huge lake. I have fished gullrock many times and that's a great size...eagle or lac seul is too big for my taste. Thanks again.
4624353,youngknight,2016-03-09 19:57:00,228,"Investigate lac Kiowa, not far from North bay Ontario but drive to in Quebec. Big lake but nothing like lac soul but lake is a series of long bays...**** pretty country to boot. Check out cedar valley lodge for a value priced cabin and very accommodating hosts."

4652537,dar100,2016-03-20 06:47:00,7,"look at domaine poutrincourt ,might have spelled it wrong, drive in then you boat to outpost or stay by lodge, if you go somewhere talked to someone who has been there so they can offer advice on different things you could bring to make stay better"
