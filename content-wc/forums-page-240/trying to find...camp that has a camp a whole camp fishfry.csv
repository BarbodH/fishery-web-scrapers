I will not divulge names........but I would rather serve a hot dog than serve basa. I use whitefish that I buy fresh and is caught on Eagle Lake. I also have an issue (conservation minded) about camps that use guest caught sport fish for their fish fry. In my mind it just puts more pressure on the resource and saves the lodge owner money........a bad combination in my mind. End of rant."
4642849,prov1800,2016-03-16 15:44:00,5010,"I agree with you on the basa.There thin and awfull .As far as conservation goes gord the guy you buy your whitefish from probably kills more walleyes, pike and muskies than all the guests at the camps bring in for the fish fries.But even with all that going on the lake keeps improving in my books.Its a amazig fishery.Wonder how manyvwalleyes get filleted at the shorelunches, everyday."
4643001,Skywagon,2016-03-16 16:32:00,1106,"The natives set nets on my home lake, I have seen them bring the nets up through the ice a few times. The nets do not discriminate, walleye, northern, white fish, suckers and no doubt musky, it catches them all. I would guess the fellow that has the license on Eagle to net white fish certainly targets them, but there has to be a % of game fish killed also, it can't be helped. From what I have seen there are not many live fish to turn loose after the net comes up (I personally have never seen any). On another note, a camp owner on our lake used to supply all the walleye for their fish fry on Wednesday's, she fished a lot, until caught for other infractions. I like the whitefish idea, especially if they are netted on a lake far away."
4643177,prov1800,2016-03-16 17:44:00,5010,A lot ofvthe camps buy whitefish from him as well as walleye and huge pike fillets.they are allowed to keep 3% accidental catch from there huge quota of whitefish.it is what it is.iam staying away from the native netting.lol.

4651401,bigcreekdad,2016-03-19 16:13:00,74,Gord....the camp I go to also started using basa as well....really a lousy change. Very disappointing.

4652065,wallydave,2016-03-19 21:04:00,2151,The Black Bear Lodge camp fish fry counts on every body bringing in a fish or two for the fish fry. Being a America plan Lodge the fishing pressure isn't that bad. True I was there in August so the number of boats was low so my experience might be different. Still a nice place to fish!
4652329,pjshorthorn,2016-03-20 05:04:00,5654,The main reason Gramps and I show up to the fish fry is to check out how many good looking fisherwomen are in camp that week. Food being served is just a bonus. PjShorthorn.

4635905,digjig,2016-03-14 08:34:00,146,Rainbow Point Lodge has a all camp fish fry on Tuesday evenings. Bring something to share and they provide the fish and potatoes. Very family friendly. They hold the fish fry centrally located in camp in the picnic area next to the volley ball court. Bob cooks the fish and potatoes on an open fire with a Blue. Great time!
4636369,Skywagon,2016-03-14 11:51:00,1106,Curious as to where all the fish come from that they provide?
4636913,Oldschool,2016-03-14 15:41:00,163,"It's whitefish that they purchase in town. I believe that they go to Dryden, but I doubt that it really matters. They do a nice job, and it is a fun time for all."
4638929,digjig,2016-03-15 12:32:00,146,What Oldschool said. I look forward to it every year.
4639849,Skywagon,2016-03-15 18:05:00,1106,"Good to hear they are using the whitefish, they taste about as good as walleye and are underutilized in most lakes."

4629721,Andyeye,2016-03-11 15:15:00,179,Ray and Kathi hold one at Cedar Point Resort on Cedar Lake once a week. Kathi bakes desserts and Ray does the fish. Very good!
