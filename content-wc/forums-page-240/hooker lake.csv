4619209,nancy39,2016-03-08 11:15:00,23,Is there a map I guy can purchase of the whole area that covers those lakes? Thx
4621577,adempsey,2016-03-08 22:19:00,963,"I put up the maps I have available for free. It's possible someone might have additional maps of the area, but I don't know."
4528089,55walleyes,2016-02-08 15:46:00,131,Not real sure to be honest. Did make one trip in June. I think it was 3rd week of June. Fished most if not all marked spots and caught fish. It did seem to me that walleye seemed a little smaller that year. Probably just a coincidence.
4528209,nancy39,2016-02-08 16:29:00,23,Thx again.bigger fish more concentrated in july but I pull a lot of bottom bouncers where my buddies jig always seem to catch some bigger fish.a little more work but always moving and find new spots.then and early spring can make that late june fishing great.pick up big northerns also thx
4528433,55walleyes,2016-02-08 17:37:00,131,Please post a report and share any hotspots you might find
4528441,nancy39,2016-02-08 17:39:00,23,No problem
4528569,nancy39,2016-02-08 18:08:00,23,No problem
4540689,Daveygravy,2016-02-12 18:15:00,88,"Fished the hooker, Vincent, arc chain for the last 10 years. We always went at the end of July. Would be happy to share my spots and tactics. Feel free to pm me."
4569145,nancy39,2016-02-21 18:36:00,23,what size and color crankbaits for these lakes?
4569337,Daveygravy,2016-02-21 19:16:00,88,"Size 9 shad raps and tail dancers in fire tiger. If fish are deep, troll the deep tail dancers. Firetiger is my go to color, but other colors have produced just as well."
4571921,nancy39,2016-02-22 16:20:00,23,Big fire tiger fan what about jig color salted minnows or fresh?
4572097,Daveygravy,2016-02-22 16:56:00,88,"Jig colors - pearl, orange, pink, chartreuse. We don't bother with minnows, some of the guys use a half of a crawler on their jig and twister. I find live bait unnecessary, mainly because of the way I like to fish. I keep 3 rods rigged up 1 has a 1/4 or 3/8 Vmc jig head with a 4"" gulp minnow on it , 2 has a drop shot with a gulp minnow, 3 has either a crankbait, swimbait or blade bait on it depending on conditions. This is what works for me. If you like to fish minnows , then by all means bring them. These lakes are darker water lakes and the fish aren't finicky."
4521409,nancy39,2016-02-06 11:07:00,23,Thx Dempsey for help with the maps.you wouldn't have lake just north of vincent that runs into miniss.I think it is arc?
4521601,adempsey,2016-02-06 11:53:00,963,"Actually, I put Vincent up recently, along with Cutcliffe and Peg. The links are right next to the Hooker Lake link. I dont have a map of Arc Lake, sorry."
4522049,55walleyes,2016-02-06 15:50:00,131,Thanks for the additional maps. I had seen the Hooker Map before. There used to be a blown up copy in one of the cabins but had never seen the others.
4522065,nancy39,2016-02-06 15:57:00,23,Now maybe you can mark a few of them hot spots you and your dad found 45 years ago!!!!
4522089,55walleyes,2016-02-06 16:07:00,131,I will sometime soon. Have to dig them out. Pretty sure I have some maps that might work out better. I think they will be a little clearer and easier to read but do not have the depth markings.
4522121,nancy39,2016-02-06 16:15:00,23,"Appreciated, I was really surprised of the deep water on all four lakes. Patricia fly in has a cabin on arc lake north of vincent.have you ever ran into anybody from that camp?"
4522713,55walleyes,2016-02-06 20:41:00,131,Rarely but yes have seen their boats a few times
4525929,55walleyes,2016-02-08 06:09:00,131,See attachments
4525969,55walleyes,2016-02-08 06:13:00,131,One more attachment
4528001,nancy39,2016-02-08 15:19:00,23,thx alot 55 gives us some idea where to start much appreciated.a lot of guys wouldn!t give up spots but if your returning fish to the lake what difference does it make.our you going in july or late june?
4507937,nancy39,2016-02-02 14:24:00,23,anyone fish hooker lake last year?
4508017,adempsey,2016-02-02 14:36:00,963,"Hooker Lake with Slate Falls Outposts, previously with Hidden Bay Lodge?? If so, I don't think it was available last year (or maybe even longer). Not entirely sure though, but I don't think it was even listed on Hidden Bay Lodge's website since 2009."
4508089,55walleyes,2016-02-02 14:49:00,131,Fished it many times. My dad started there in 1969 (It was ran by Anderson's then) and he went most years until Hidden Bay stopped operating there. I actually think we were their last group in there. We are going back this year with Slate Falls. Been to two other outposts since Hooker closed. Had good experiences at both but am returning to Hooker for a reason.
4508681,Mike Borger,2016-02-02 17:21:00,1554,"No, but I fished Skank and Slut, they were great!"
4511073,nancy39,2016-02-03 11:03:00,23,"what is your reason? no pressure for 5 years,fish grew,or like the lake system"
4511561,55walleyes,2016-02-03 12:43:00,131,Everything you mentioned but mainly the success I/we have had there and knowledge of the system that comes with almost 40 years experience.
4511569,55walleyes,2016-02-03 12:44:00,131,I know I will catch quality walleye and a lot of them.
4512905,nancy39,2016-02-03 18:31:00,23,Been to miniss about 30 times usually 2nd week of season told verne time for a change so he has us . Going in on june 19.thx for imputed looking for a map of the lake. Can you help 55walleye
4513585,adempsey,2016-02-03 21:10:00,963,You can download a map of the lake from here. It is found under 'H' on the page.
