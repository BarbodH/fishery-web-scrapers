4627377,prov1800,2016-03-10 18:59:00,5010,"If your running on bush trails like i do there will snow.takes longer to get rid of that stuff.plenty where i was today.had to put my scratchers down this morning on the lake, shes pretty hard on top and that 2 1/4"" track has a hard time lubricating things.but no problem.got 7-7"" of frozen slush up top.ice is solid and thickness hasnt changed still in that 15-18"".fishing was fantastic today.went out by myself and fished from 9-11:30.brought 14 lakers up kept a couple of smaller ones to eat.was back bh 12:30.life is good.tomorrow crappies and walleyes."
4627497,bigtimeelectric,2016-03-10 19:32:00,174,"I would to, however I heard Lac Seul is not safe in the winter with all the current and the fluctuating water level. Not sure, but would love to hit them spots that we hammer em on in the summer!!!!"
4627537,prov1800,2016-03-10 19:55:00,5010,I do the day trippers.and yes you have to be carefull on lac seul.this time of the year getting closer to spring water levels do go down and the ice drops down to thecwater.been there when its happened as well as some other current lakes.very spooky.you think you were in a earthquake.a lot of those summer spots you would think your gopounds hammer walleyes on would surprise you when you come up empty.its not that easy.you would need to come up here in oct and find them then you might catch some.summer and late fall are totally different as where thecwalleyes are. winoga lodge i mentioned before runs great winter trips out of siox lookout and the have everything you need.they fish minnitaki forcwalleye and pig lake trout.have fished there and trout are huge.also the fish lac suel and big sandy lake for the best tasting whitefish i have ever had plus bonus lakers that seem to be always over ten pounds.its all guided and fanrastic accomadations.
4620265,prov1800,2016-03-08 15:48:00,5010,"Just finished taking a fisherman from Illinois out for 6 days days of ice fishing and had some good fishing.My guest has done this for a number of years and the question came by from him this year about why we never see other ice fisherman.So thats my question, the areas i fish in the winter are the bodies of water i guide on in the summer.Most of the topics here are about summer fishing and seems like people are chewing at the bit to get up here.So iam wondering if anybody ice fishes and if they do how come only a handfull end up coming here.Fishing is awesome plus the great rides on snowmobiles or atvs plus some great open fires and frying up fresh fish.we caught lake trout, walleyes, smallmouth bass some pike and in two days we caught 400+ crappies.that was incredible fishing.Who wouldnt want some of that."
4620361,Freytown,2016-03-08 16:19:00,770,"IMO, many guys get ONE trip a year to enjoy. So is it warmer weather or the dead of winter??? Easy choice for me. Plus the drive is not so iffy in the spring/summer."
4621073,pan-man,2016-03-08 18:59:00,299,"2 problems that have prevented me are lodging and snowmobile. Once you get past the north side of Lake of the Woods, I do not know of any resorts (let me know of any) open. I currently have no snowmobile as we hardly have any snow anymore. Renting a snowmobile for $100-150/day to use for a 10-20 mile drive to ice fish seems ridiculous. On top of that travel can be a challenge in Canada. I go to Northwest Angle once a year and its only 70 miles in Canada and usually takes 2-2.5 hours to travel."
4621497,Lmbkiller,2016-03-08 21:15:00,639,"I would do a sleeper shack on lac seul in a heart beat, to my knowledge no one does it or provides that service. I guess I would even do a ""day"" shack out there but don't have a sled and I don't know of any resorts that run that either. I guess I'm not aware of any resorts that operate during winter on lac seul"
4621593,v-bay gord,2016-03-08 22:26:00,3168,"Our area isn't really ice fishing friendly.....few accommodations, great distances, etc..........unless you have a local connection. Too many variables can go wrong to ruin a do it yourself trip, starting from weather, ice conditions, local trail conditions......and on and on. Even a local connection does not guarantee much. Combined with the fact if you have a problem up on a remote lake here, you might end up with a real issue."
4621785,prov1800,2016-03-09 05:49:00,5010,Iam surprised our area doesnt have more winter options.i do a few trips each year and use the motel in vermilion bay to house my parties but dont supply snowmobiles.There is a camp in sioux lookout that caters to ice fishing trips and supplies everything needed. (Winoga lodge)they do a great job and are quit busy.
4621929,rosh1,2016-03-09 07:09:00,275,What's the ice condition up there? We are planning on coming to Eagle on the 20th.
4621977,prov1800,2016-03-09 07:33:00,5010,"Right now it's ok.havnt been on eagle this year.have been fishing north of eagle.trout lakes have around 15"" and the shallower lakes are running 20"".took a long time this year to make ice and not much of it.Rained most of yesterday with a thunder storm.that ate up some surface snow.Iam headed out tomorrow and will report on the ice.its looking pretty warm rest of the week.then a bit of cooler weather."
4622001,rosh1,2016-03-09 07:36:00,275,Thanks for the info. Hate to make the trip and not be able to get on the ice. Thanks again
4622057,v-bay gord,2016-03-09 07:43:00,3168,"There may be ice, but likely not much snow.....might be tough going on trails unless you're planning on using an atv. There is less ice than normal right now. I would expect an early ice out."
