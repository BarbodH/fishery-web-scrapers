4638921,SILVER MINNOW BAIT SHOP,2016-03-15 12:30:00,18,I always try to make sure i give the customer a receipt with my shop stamp on it. The mnr has been cracking down and I have heard of US residents receiving fines for not having the receipt on them.
4642505,Bakefish,2016-03-16 13:55:00,1077,I didn't realize this was law. What happens when you're at a lodge and you get a couple dozen minnows a day included in the price? What's the proof the minnows came from the lodge owner? Gord?
4642713,v-bay gord,2016-03-16 15:00:00,3168,"O.K......There is no law requiring you to carry a bill of sale.....but if you need to have a back up plan to prove where you obtained the bait, a bill of sale would be the easiest. Staying at a lodge no problem.....any lodge owner worth his weight will know where your bait came from and would be able to prove it. Crossing the border with illegal shiners you should be shot and p#ssed on."
4642897,Bakefish,2016-03-16 15:56:00,1077,Thanks.
4642929,Pooch,2016-03-16 16:10:00,4619,Larry's Bait shop in Kakabeka Falls has been giving us extra receipts for our bait for several years now. Each boat carries a receipt with them all the time. I thought everyone knew that?Pooch
4635801,LOW1,2016-03-14 08:10:00,2828,This guy sure went to a lot of trouble to save a few bucks on his minnows. http://www.kenoradailyminerandnews.c...h-into-ontario I wonder how many people actually get and keep a receipt when they pick up their minnows? If I do its just because of luck. One should probably get in the habit of keeping the receipt.
4636289,Pikeslayer8,2016-03-14 11:00:00,1460,"Honest mistakes deserve a fine. This sort of fraudulent activity deserves jail time. Gotta say that I used to be nonchalant about my bait receipts in the past, but I have been keeping them in my wallet for the past several trips."
4636513,Pooch,2016-03-14 12:54:00,4619,It never ceases to amaze me at what people will do to save a buck or two. What a DA.Pooch
4636553,Mark R,2016-03-14 13:05:00,1538,I'm not sure about being put in jail for smuggling a few shiners but due to the potential damage of bringing live bait across the border I don't think a life time ban from Canada would be excessive.
4636561,Pikeslayer8,2016-03-14 13:10:00,1460,What about counterfeiting Ontario baitfish dealers stamp? 30 days in the klink!
4636945,MN_Moose,2016-03-14 15:53:00,964,"It's an interesting scenario. I've been asked for a receipt by MNR on the Winnipeg river for leaches. The officer told me I must have a receipt. Since we have two boats we ask for two receipts which ticks off the bait store. But, I've read the fishing regulations many times and it does not mention anything about needing a receipt for said bait purchased in Ontario."
4637361,v-bay gord,2016-03-14 18:56:00,3168,Potentially importing an invasive species or disease........misleading a conservation officer in an investigation.......I think not being welcomed back to Canada for ten years would be appropriate. It makes one wonder how many others get away with this crap.........and no wonder we now have spiny water flea and rusty crayfish.......among other things.
4637425,Obabikon,2016-03-14 19:14:00,2370,Not a lot of sympathy for someone who goes out of their way to intentionally break a law that is in place to protect invasive species.
4637769,roscoe33,2016-03-14 23:14:00,653,"Not saying what this guy did was right,or condoning it in any way, but any possible invasive species could have been introduced into the very same lake, had he fished on the US side of the lake."
4638001,Obabikon,2016-03-15 06:26:00,2370,"That's true. However, these are the exact type of guys that introduced rusty crayfish to the lake also."
