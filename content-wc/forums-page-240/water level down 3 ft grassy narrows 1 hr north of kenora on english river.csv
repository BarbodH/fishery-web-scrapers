3906714,Guest,2015-05-26 13:08:00,0,"wallhanger trevor said we won't be able to get into scotty this year because of low water good for lake trout this time of year they are in shallow water about 10-12 miles from camp about 10 years fished ball lake about 8 miles north had good luck we also fish maynard falls with rapids and cable must be careful have you guys fished some of these areas ?? lot of water and islands copied about 8 gps points from 5-6 years ago and downloaded them into my garmin if it would help you guys (easy to get lost) could send them to you we normally fish 65% walleyes jiging and 35% northerns,lakers, and smallies trolling and casting plugs jim wolf Chicago boys we fished out of ball lake lodge about 6 years ago ( Indians fixing it up but still in bad shape) the manager got arrested in town 2nd day for drunkness and the brother helped us the rest of week ( could barely read or write what a disaster never again) at least bonnie and trevor relialble jim wolf Chicago boys"
3908594,Bigstorm,2015-05-27 06:23:00,799,"We have multiple spots that we fish from the lodge up to Maynard Falls going thru Indian, Ball and Tide, we know the area going upriver pretty well but haven't spent any time going downriver thru Fox toward Separation. Last year was the first year we spent a good amount time back in Dumpy and we haven't explored Scotty at all, too bad you wont be able to get in there next week. Hope you have a good trip and let me know how you do when you get back"

Quite a contrast. We caught a 29"" walleye in our group and several 25-28"" fish. There were a lot of large pike caught. I personally caught 5 over 38"". Largest was 41"". One guy caught a 43"" pike. Couldn't get close to getting into Dumpy.been fishing from Lount to Maynard Falls for 11 years."

Here is a link to the site showing water levelshttp://www.lwcb.ca/waterflowdata.html Scroll down under the secondary sites for English River at Grassy Narrows. the water level right now is the same as it was when we were there last summer on our last day (had to walk the boat thru to get into Dumpy on our last day, couldn't get thru before that)"
