4632489,billy weaver,2016-03-12 19:19:00,470,"I have a walleye mount on the wall a 28"" fish caught back in 1992. I have since caught bigger fish but chose to release them after a few pictures. I have picked the best photo had it enlarged framed in a nice oak frame with a plaque stating size and lake caught. I have a man-cave in the basement where I show off pictures etc. My wife pretty much has laid down the law about the rest of the house. However I have know trouble with keeping fish along as it meets regulations"
4636633,MrSimon,2016-03-14 13:43:00,922,"I do the same as Billy ..... print out high quality photos of nice fish (sometimes even poster size) and put them on the wall, nicely framed. I'd much rather look at a beautiful picture of me (or a buddy) holding up a live fish than to just stare at a dead fish. I feel like the picture brings back way more of the memory."
4637801,kzoofisher,2016-03-15 03:24:00,5144,"I've been resisting for days but....this goes back many decades. Little old lady walks into the taxidermist with two dead rabbits in a box. Tearfully she says to the man behind the counter, ""This is Sammy and Sally. They were the best of friends in life."" Taxidermist: ""And you would like them mounted?"" Little old lady: ""No, just holding hands."" That made 10 year old me laugh until I cried. Think of it every time taxidermy comes up. Kind of sad really."
4638977,oleJoe,2016-03-15 13:09:00,114,"I have done it both ways. 2 skin mounts for me ( one excellent and one I could have done just as well) then a replica for my nephew, which is excellent. But now days its take a nice picture and when I get home its blow it up and frame it. I have been going to Canada for 19 yrs to a fly in camp. Saying that I never caught a pike of 40 inches or better. Then I caught 2 40 1/2 "" in an hour and a half. Got a couple nice pictures and let them go. When I got home I got a couple of blown ups and framed them. I had a friend say that they were the same fish because I had the same clothes on. I laughed and said no, but if you don't believe me that ok. The pictures are for me and I know I caught two. It my memory ! I enjoyed catching them and I enjoyed letting them go to be caught again. Enjoy it."
4642089,brochet,2016-03-16 12:00:00,88,"Ive mounted many fish over the last few decades,and I can attest to the fact that no matter how good a taxidermest is, over time that mount will show signs of failure.a replica mount is far superior in every aspect.and you and the fish wins."
4642137,brochet,2016-03-16 12:12:00,88,"as a retired taxidermist I can tell you that no matter how good they might be,there will always be some signs of failure to a skin mount over time.a replica is far superior in every aspect.and you and the fish wins.."
4627113,fishron,2016-03-10 17:27:00,317,"I have to admit, I was so thrilled the first time I caught a large walleye and made the decision to keep it for a mount, I now regret. It was a 27 incher and a thrill to catch. Another walleye came my way on the Cabonga reservoir, a thirty incher and I made the decision to mount her.Since then I have caught many large walleye, and I think I've grown in my understanding of the fishery. Let the big girls go. Not that their the prime spawning stock, but why not let another angler get a shot at a trophy.As I sit at my computer and and type my post my two mounts are on the wall over me. They are beautiful mounts, but if I had it to do over again the wall would be blank.I'm not judging anyone else, but for me, I've grown to appreciate just the experience of catching a big one and the satisfaction of letting her swim.This is just my perspective of fishing for this magnificent fish and not a criticism of any one else's take on walleye fishing.I hope everyone gets a big one this season."
4627809,youngknight,2016-03-10 21:51:00,228,"Yeah, some years ago before replica mounts came into vogue I caught a 10 pounder thru the ice in bay of quinte...it was a one in a lifetime fish for me and I had it mounted. Regrets? Not really...that size of fish was and is fairly common in that fishery. Not likely to do it again and have let 6 pounders go in lakes where fish that large are rare."
4628201,BornToFish,2016-03-11 06:39:00,1224,"Greetings FishRon, You raised an interesting topic! We have two fish mounts in our home. One is a replica of my personal best musky (52.5 inches). The other is the first thirty inch walleye (skin mount) caught by my wife. We started out fishing about fifteen years ago in north west Ontario. We were your typical newbies catching many ""eaters"". Then, one day it happened! My wife put a thirty incher in the net. We were in disbelief. We didn't know what to do, so we put in the live-well and took it back to the dock to show everyone what we caught. After the glory faded, we were in a dilemma as we didn't know what to do with it. Should we bake it or have it mounted? Well, the rest is history as they say. Since then, we have caught and released dozens of comparable or better walleyes. The key learning moment for us was realizing the dilemma that I mentioned above. We weren't prepared for the moment! We didn't know what to do after the fish was in the net. Since then, my wife and I have given serious thought to what length/weight of each species of fish would it take to have a replica prepared. We are now prepared with a measuring tape and camera to accurately capture the fish's appearance and size. That's how we made the replica of one of my muskies. The fish are always returned to the lake. In a sense, it's too bad that we had that first walleye made as a skin mount. On the other hand, it caused us to give serious thought as to what constitutes a trophy in our minds. I shared this concept with our fishing friends so they too are better prepared when the next big fish is in the net. One of my fishing partners has an awesome stringer mount of 30-32 inch walleyes on a piece of driftwood. I netted several of these fish for him. We were prepared with tape and camera such that the taxidermist could properly do his work. That first thirty inch walleye caused us to take our fishing game to a much higher and more personal level. At least some good came out of sacrificing that fish. Good fishing and tight lines!!"

I also have a picture with measurements of my largest pike to date that was returned to the water in lac Hebert 43"" at 25lbs.Some day getting a replica made"
4628689,LOW1,2016-03-11 09:00:00,2828,Personal choices and preferences. Personally I have no desire to have a preserved fish hanging on the wall. And for some reason replicas have no appeal either. Memories are free. And the real beauty of fish memories is that they don't need to be completely true and can be modified to fit the circumstances.
4628961,ftfarms,2016-03-11 10:31:00,444,"I always said I won't mount a walleye under 30"" but now I probly won't mount one at all. We've got a 41"" 23lb northern mounted for my son when he was 11 and now 20 years later it's not even displayed anymore. The memories last forever the skin mounts don't."
4629009,pikeman14,2016-03-11 10:38:00,144,"I do like the walleyes I have mounted, but I do wish they were replicas. I wouldn't do a true mount again. Years ago I mounted a nice pike that had a bunch of battle scars. when I got him back...the pike looked beautiful like a piece of art. The catch is that it didn't even resemble the fish I caught. It looks like an airbrushed fish and nobody believes that it's the fish in the picture. For the price per inch, I would go with a replica plus I don't keep many fish nowadays."
4630217,Baseline,2016-03-11 18:36:00,3207,"IMO keeping a legal fish is the personal choice of the fisherman. I like that, so far, everyone who has comments has said what they did and would do in the future and hasn't passed judgement on another's choice. I fished for walleyes for 8 or ten years before I hooked up with a 29 incher. At the time, the largest walleye I had caught was 24 inches. I decided to keep and mount it. It hung in my office for 20 years and is now in a special place in my home. I decided after I caught the first mount the next one would be a 36 incher. I've been as close as 33. Since catching the 29 I've released every walleye over 19 inches including a few 30"" plus."
4630849,Juls,2016-03-12 03:00:00,13414,"In my opinion, a wall mount is more about the memory it brings you when you look at it. It doesn't have to be a trophy sized fish just to be able to grace your walls. Sure, memories are free, but often forgotten over time, unless something triggers that memory. If a fish is kept legally, I don't care if you eat it, mount it, or release it. It's your choice. Don't feel guilty about the fish you put on your wall....enjoy the memories."
4632161,Bassmandpe,2016-03-12 15:54:00,42,"Live in Florida but have been fishing in Ontario for over fifty years making two trips a year. Had a replica made by Bass Pro Shop of a 31 inch Canadian Walleye and a 10 pound Largemouth Bass I caught in a tournament on Lake Okeechobee. Had a plaque made for each of them with the date, lake, weight and ""Released"". Great quality and with a little dusting every once and awhile they still look great.Both are on the wall in my computer-TV room and every time I look at them it brings back great memories. One of the best, being I released them! Prices are very similar and highly recommend the replica!"
