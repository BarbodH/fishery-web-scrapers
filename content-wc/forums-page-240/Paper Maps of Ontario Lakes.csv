4633529,pikeman14,2016-03-13 10:23:00,144,Canada sales map....is the way to go. Give them a call in person. Sometimes they have new lakes surveyed that are not on the website.
4634657,zman8701,2016-03-13 17:40:00,100,Go to Keystone lodge and look at the map they have. If that fits your needs you can print out whatever side you want to fish or both.
4645769,BornToFish,2016-03-17 15:47:00,1224,"I ordered seven maps from Canada Map Sales on 10 March 2016. The complete set of maps was in my mail box this afternoon. One of the maps was recently added to their list of available maps and was not shown on their website. There was no HST. The exchanged rate was 1.32. The ladies that I spoke with on the telephone were courteous and helpful. This endeavor was about as simple as it can be. If interested, the contact information was provided earlier on this thread.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4627601,BennieS,2016-03-10 20:24:00,108,"Anyone know where I could get a map of Cedar Lake? Cedar Lake south of Perrault Falls by the way. Is there even such a thing available? Taking my grandson there at the end of July beginning of August and figure I better get busy trying to learn whatever I possibly can that might help me put him on some fish. Uh, that's a half truth. Would like to put myself on some fish as well. Bahhahaha I'm sure they'll offer guidance at Cedar Point Resort when we get there but I'd love to have a map to pore over with the grandson and get him all pumped up. Thanks all, Bennie"

4627849,adempsey,2016-03-10 22:47:00,963,"I will put up a map for you. You can just send it to a printing place if you want to print larger size. It's not expensive to do usually. Otherwise, you can print it at home and span it across multiple pages - as long as your printer supports that feature.You can also use the Navionics WebApp to check it out.edit: Ok, I put up two maps. You can find them at the bottom of the page under Other Lakes - Line on Fishing Depth Maps"

4628305,BornToFish,2016-03-11 07:07:00,1224,I just ordered a set of maps for a nearby lake. Very friendly people to do business with. They have paper maps as well as waterproof. I think these are the same maps available in many tackle stores. Flatrate shipping with no HST and a favorable exchange rate made it a reasonable deal.Canadamapsales.com The number 877-627-7226

4630697,BennieS,2016-03-11 21:30:00,108,Thanks everyone for taking their time to post these suggestions and the Navonics map. It is much appreciated. Should be a great help and give me a chance to teach some map reading and planning skills. Hopefully we'll also be able to find some walleyes along the way and improve our fishing skills as well.

I use it all over Canada and it has 3 different views to look at, one of them being satellite and another the green topo map like you buy in Canada. It also has gps on the app. also."
