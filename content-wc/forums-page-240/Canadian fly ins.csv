4645273,Mike Borger,2016-03-17 13:17:00,1554,Gene yes I have used Slate Falls. My group flew into their facility on Eagle Island on Lake St. Joseph last August and had a fantastic trip!Verne Hollett is among the very best outfitters I have used.Have never fished Hooker but have heard good things about it. If you're interested you can see the detailed write up on my trip with Slate Falls here. It will certainly give you good idea of what to expect when dealing with Verne:http://www.canadafishingguide.net/la...eye-beat-down/
4645761,drlee,2016-03-17 15:46:00,409,"Mike is right on...Slate Falls and Verne are the very best. I have not been to Hooker (or and other houses of ill repute) but we flew into Eagle Island on St. Joe and it was the best walleye/northern fishing I have ever experienced in bot size and numbers. And, I have fished a lot of lakes over many years in Ontario. Wherever you go, Have A Blast!"
