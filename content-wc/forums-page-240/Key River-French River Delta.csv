4653865,FrankLeigh,2016-03-20 15:07:00,80,"Thanks Chris, We just booked this year's trip yesterday, but I will call Leon and see if we can do something in the fall. At least we have a good phone number, now. Frank"
4542049,Mike Borger,2016-02-13 08:56:00,1554,"It's in a state of flux right now. The owner was an older gent and quite a character. Unfortunately he passed away over a year ago.The son has no real interest in operating the camp but I believe he DID open it last year only to accommodate a couple of very long time regular groups. Beyond that no phone calls or emails were answered.The camp is in VERY rough shape and needs a ton of work to make it habitable again. Hopefully someone takes the initiative.I believe this guy has some camps in the delta area, maybe worth investigating. Don't bother emailing, a phone call is best.http://moosebayoutpost.weebly.com/index.html"
4542729,Bald Eagle,2016-02-13 13:48:00,7,"I would like to go up with my 37 foot cruiser to tie up at the lodge and fish the Bad and it looks like a good either anchor or tie up. I don't know who to call to set this up, any help would be appreciated. I could always anchor on the other side of Devils Rapids as well but it would be fun to get to know the people who own/run those cottages there. I understand the Lodge does no longer operate."
4542745,Bald Eagle,2016-02-13 13:54:00,7,Maybe a few of us retired folk need to go up there and help get this place back up and running. Don't tell my wife I said that.
4542793,Bald Eagle,2016-02-13 14:19:00,7,"Thanks for the information Mike, My wife and I are planning to overnight at Britt on our way up around July 1 and head up to the Georgian Bay Fishing Camp the next day. Failing our hope to fish the eastern French River our loose plan is to press on via the Bustards to the Bad anchorage below Devils Rapids and try the fishing on the Bad."
4622545,FrankLeigh,2016-03-09 10:01:00,80,"Hey Mike Have you had any success getting ahold of Leon recently? E-mail is ""undeliverable"" and phone is ""not available"". We stayed at the outpost for many years and then at the village after the outpost was sold, back when Larry owned the place. Would like to do another trip for old times sake. Frank"
4622737,Mike Borger,2016-03-09 11:07:00,1554,"No I haven't Frank, although truth be told I haven't tried to. From what I know Leon is hard to reach at the best of times."
4648465,Bald Eagle,2016-03-18 14:37:00,7,"Thanks for the information on Georgian Bay Fishing Camp. My wife and I are planning on cruising to the area, probably late June, early July and anchoring near Dock Island and fishing from my dingy(not the best vessel to fish from) for a few days. We will stop by Britt for a night on our way up and perhaps stop by the mouth of the Key River just to get to know the folks there."
4651665,chris.brock,2016-03-19 18:14:00,112,"Funny seeing this thread now. With a bit of leg work and Mike's help, I talked to Leon a few days ago. 705 938 8927 **** I wanna fish down there in the right time of the year."
4651841,Tizfun,2016-03-19 19:41:00,34,"Georgian Bay Fishing camp maybe open again... I was there about 4-5 years ago and it wasn't pretty.. it's gone downhill from what I remember it being... I got a email from a gent who told me that Dave's son was opening the camp and taking over .. Dave sadly passed away a couple years ago... I used to go to the camp back in 1988 till 1995 for the pike opener... Great times, lots of fish and a PB of 23lbs for me... Look up their number and give them a call..."
4652673,Ruddiger,2016-03-20 07:24:00,649,"Howdy, I just checked their website and it says closed for renovations. Take care, Ruddiger"
1902250,PBsQuest,2013-06-27 09:25:00,49,"We're heading up on 7/14 for a week of fishing. We'll be heading out of the Key River and staying on an island in Georgian Bay. We have the opportunity to fish a bunch of the lower French River Delta and the various bays. Anyone have any knowledge of patterns, water conditions etc? We'll target the bite but would love to catch some great eyes."
1903866,10lbeye,2013-06-27 20:05:00,61,"Where/what island are you staying? I've been going there for 35 years and just returned. If you can be more specific I can help you target some areas, but it's a huge area...."
1904986,PBsQuest,2013-06-28 08:31:00,49,We're heading straight west out of the Key River. We're right next to Genessee Bay. We're actually looking at Dead Island from the island we're staying on.

1906338,Mike Borger,2013-06-28 15:00:00,1554,"I've fished the delta of the Bad River (western channel of the French) many times over the years, one of my favorite places in the world.Early to mid July has always been productive for me as well. Many large walleye trolling oversized floating Rap's at night, as well as big musky and pike.If you're going to venture that far west shoot me a pm and I can help.Cheers"
1906538,Fish_Heads,2013-06-28 16:02:00,154,"Solo:Thanks for stirring up some memories !The Bad river Lodge (at the mouth of the river & Georgian bay) & the Voyageur lodge above the rapids (2 places our group stayed back then), bring back the memories of many trips there in the mid 80's.Trolling 7"" rapalas up the river every evening from the mouth of the bay to the Jamison rapids produced many trophy sized fish for us.We booked our yearly trips there to go along with the full moon........we never started fishing till 9:30 at night, caught our limit by midnight, went back & cooked up some of them & played poker till 6am.........Slept in till noon or later most days & during daylight hours we jigged for walleye or cast the big rocks in the adjacent bay (past the devil's door rapids) near the old fish cannery docks for pike.Bad river lodge was bought out by private owners & I heard the Voyageur burnt to the ground.Not sure there's any place to get a cabin there now ??I'd love to go back sometime too & take my son (17) along & fish those rapalas up the river again.Fish"
1907234,PBsQuest,2013-06-28 20:44:00,49,I'm guessing the farthest west we'd go would be into Fox Bay. We must have caught 35-45 smallies in a short couple of hours up in there in 2010 throwing a jig with an emerald shiner power bait but I'd sure like to find some quality walleye or the occasional pike. It's encouraging to see that there can be some quality 'eyes.
1909706,10lbeye,2013-06-30 07:39:00,61,"Fish: For years we fished the French River delta area of The Bay and trolling at night was historically the ticket for big walleye. In fact, the conventional wisdom was that ""you can't catch walleye in the day there."" After too many years of believing that, we finally got smart and challenged that idea. We eventually caught as many if not more walleyes during the day drifting and trolling harnesses and jig fishing. We might be slow, but eventually we catch on......! But I agree that trolling at night w/ the big floating Raps is the ticket for the big girls in that area. My PB was catching 2 10 lber's 20 min apart one calm, beautiful night w/ a full moon providing all the light we needed to navigate. Both fish **** near knocked the rod out of my hands. A night I will never forget...."
1912394,PBsQuest,2013-07-01 11:34:00,49,Unfortunately for us we will be going just after a new moon. I'm sure it can't be much darker up there. Congrats on two monsters and your PB.
4541937,Bald Eagle,2016-02-13 08:22:00,7,I boated up the channel and anchored for a night below Devils Rapids July 2015 and took my dingy up the next set of rapids and back down the jump. I never got any fishing in but want to go back in 2016. On my way up from Penetang I want to visit the Georgian Bay Fishing Camp (midway between Dallas Falls and the Key River) but I don't know if that camp is still in operation. Does anyone know whether the Georgian Bay Fishing Camp is still in operation?
