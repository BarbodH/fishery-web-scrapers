4621817,fishron,2016-03-09 06:10:00,317,I hope a hard copy of this map will be available similar in size to the one that Air Tam provides now. I spoke to John and Elianne at the Harrisburg show and hope they will make it available to those that don't have the electronics.

4630305,NY Walleye,2016-03-11 19:12:00,78,Downloaded on my phone and dropped some pins. I am going to print and bring the iPhone with me as well. I won't be able to use cellular but once downloaded should be good. Map combined with a fish finder should be in good shape. See everyone the last week of June. We are in cabin #25.
