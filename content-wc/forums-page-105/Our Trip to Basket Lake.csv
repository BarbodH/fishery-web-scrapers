The best one is when she suggested to my best buddy that if you caught 4 walleyes for the day you should quit because the mortality rate of catch and release was so high. Also if you get on a good bite you should move to protect the fish.B-
6385446,That Minnesota guy,2020-01-11 10:38:00,8293,Well done. I enjoyed the video.
6384898,emma17,2020-01-09 08:09:00,436,"Hello. As we count the days until our next trips, I thought I'd share a very amateur, smart phone video of our family trip to Basket Lake in June, 2019. The camp is roughly an hour east of Dryden. This was our first full week Canadian trip as in the past we've always done four day trips. At first I was worried a full week would be too long. Man was I wrong. It was harder to leave on day 7 than it was on day 4 of previous trips. Again, it's just a home video from an I-phone. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbcpzw5oMQk&t=9s"

6384916,Carnhzkr,2020-01-09 09:02:00,964,Very nice. That looks like one of our trips. I love making memories like these with my wife and two sons. Looks like Lake Girl is having the most fun of anyone.
6384946,Walleye2242,2020-01-09 10:53:00,263,Have fished Basket a few times. Great place. Most wildlife I have ever seen. I wish they supplied motors....if they did i would go back.
6384972,emma17,2020-01-09 12:36:00,436,"We do love it there. I'm convinced the combination of the car rides and all the hours on the boat together has bonded our family in a way I'm not sure we could have done otherwise. As for Lake Girl, I'm thankful to say she's my wife, and sorry to say she out-fishes me nearly every time out. We hit one of those magical spots our last night fishing, weed line w wind blowing in, went through all live bait. I was using plastics and tried to do the same for Lake Girl. She doesn't like plastics so she said nah, I'm just going to fish w my empty jig. Before I could stop making fun of her she reeled in a beautiful 25Â” Walleye."
6384982,Juls,2020-01-09 13:14:00,13414,Great video! I couldn't help but smile with you guys/gal....looks like it was a fantastic trip! Well done...
6385010,Skywagon,2020-01-09 16:18:00,1106,"Good looking family emma17! I have fished ice fished the lake a couple times in the winter, my wife has kayaked it in the summer, she says the owner of the camp is a very nice lady."
6385042,maddogg,2020-01-09 17:33:00,178,This was one of the very first lakes my dad and I fish way back in 1968.Fishing was good then.
6385088,Mike Borger,2020-01-09 20:35:00,1554,"That was great, thanks!"
6385262,emma17,2020-01-10 11:38:00,436,"Thank you all for the kind comments. While battling those fish, my wife is also battling multiple sclerosis, requiring her to have assistive devices. When the boat's rocking and the fish is running, she is a sight to see. What an incredible inspiration she is. The owner of Basket Lake Camp is Anita North- she took over the reins from her mother. I believe Anita is a retired brain surgeon. She is a conservationist through and through- no lead jigs, no barbs, no keeping Walleye over 18"" and she opens one week later and closes one week earlier to protect the fishery."
