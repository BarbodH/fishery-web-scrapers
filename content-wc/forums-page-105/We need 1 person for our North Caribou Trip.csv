The trip is with Pickle Lake Outposts to the Runk Island camp. You can see some video of the camp by entering ""runks camp"" into the YouTube search - there's 7 brief clips. We've done three trips to his Northwest bay camp on North Caribou and this camp will enable access to new water you just can't comfortably reach from NW bay. This is a 7 day trip with costs to the outfitter of about $1350 US (this includes 13% HST). if interested drop me a PM or an email at [email protected] phish"

6385898,phishfearme,2020-01-12 21:12:00,1242,martinbns - we fly out of Pickle Lake and take a look at our most recent trip report from North Caribou - there are two others also. these will give you a good idea of what that lake is like.https://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...d.php?t=696160we are full now for this summer's trip but I would highly encourage you to give this lake a shot - it's incredible.phish
