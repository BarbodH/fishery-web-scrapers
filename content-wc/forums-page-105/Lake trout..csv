6382948,prov1800,2020-01-02 17:12:00,5010,Lake trout opened up here in NWO yesterday so dec√¨ded to head out today.My son his girlfreind and a buddy from Manitoba joined me. As usuall first ice fishing is normally very good and the trout didnt disappoint us.My son drilled holes before i got there just from memory and was real close.We fished in 42 ft on top of a hump surround by deeper water on one side and shallow on the other.Worked out absolutly perfect as we caught a lot of trout.Didnt matter much which lure we used.The white 3 inch tube nigs and a minnow has for years been the go to but ive been using a vibrato from sebille and have found that lure will catch any species.Decent weather again today here -7 with a -15 windchill.Pretty tolerable and no need for a shelter yet.we built a fire on shore for our lunch and burned our saugages to perfection.

6383076,prov1800,2020-01-03 06:27:00,5010,"No problem Bill.Fun for me to.only 12"" of ice on Cliff Lake as compared to 16""on cedar and Edward.Talked to a freind of mine yesterday that has a trapline in the Auerobus Lake area and its only 9""there.So you have to know your ice conditions.c"
6383358,johnboat,2020-01-04 06:26:00,2014,"I suppose it could Google, but I'll just ask here.I'm going up to Northern Ontario on a Wolf Hunt and also plan on ice fishing. We plan to hit Big Trout Lake for a couple days. Do we need a special license or stamp for trout or is a fishing license good enough?"
6383386,prov1800,2020-01-04 08:45:00,5010,Your good to go.nothing special needed you will need to get a outdoors card to purchase hunting and fishing licenses.good luck on your hunt.lots of wolves around.
6383418,lenray,2020-01-04 10:34:00,467,Is Jimmy out of Pickle Lake your guide for the wolf ???? He is very good..........
