However, it's not always comfortable to be out there fishing. This past weekend we had 70 degrees though. We got out and did some drop shot fishing for crappie in 25-30' of water. We ended up catching about 40 fish with the largest two fish being 2# 4oz and 1#12oz. Those were as large of crappies as I've ever caught. We also caught a bunch of other nice ones with only a few little ones mixed in."
