While on our 20 day bear hunt at Armstrong we went to Forrest Lodge, first of this week . . New owner and a very nice camp manager. Cabins and boats are awesome . Any feedback on the fishing ? Plan a spring bear hunt and was thinking of going last week of August . Thank you in advance for any input ."

We needed a change of scenery so we haven't been there in a couple of years. Others may disagree but in my opinion Caribou is not a ""numbers"" lake but the average size is great. It's a lake that allows seclusion without flying in."

Are there many feeder creeks or rivers that may be good spots? I would think where Smoothrock flows in should be a good one. Any help on fishing locations up in the islands would be greatly appreciated. Thanks"

Fishing near the end of Beaver Island as well as Shawn should be good as well as any sunken islands with deep water nearby. Would also try around the big Island between Forrest Lodge and Sisters Islands. Never been in late May but would think water flowing in at Little Caribou would be good. Also outlet bay, Finger Bay, Whitefish Bay, and Round Bay should hold fish after the spawn. Have fished the lake in late July since 2002 and always caught fish. We target walleyes but there are some big northern if you're after them. We've also done well around main lake islands near the opening to Finger Bay in late July. Three eighths jigs when fishing 25 plus feet usually gold colored as well as orange and chartreuse tipped with a leech. Order leeches ahead from the minnow man on the way to Armstrong."
