6386500,prov1800,2020-01-14 20:03:00,5010,"Had a great week in st charles at the sportshow.Talked to a lot of people and met up with some WC members and had fun chatting with them and will get a chance to take some fishing.Should be fun.Roads were good going and coming.Dodged 3 moose last night on hwy 502 so glad was driving fairly slow.Brought Karla Clarks Sante fe back in one piece to there camp on edward lake to pick up my truck which i had left there.Figured i might as well fish the shack while i was there.Got there around 3 got set up and first fish i catch is a beautifull walleye.They were all over my sonar and very aggressive so i tried my 1/8 vibrato in a natural shinner and they wouldnt leave it alone.Iam fishing in 18 ft of water but they were cruising in 10-12 ft and would come up to take the lure.Love that.That kinda stopped and i went to my pink/white 1/8 oz jig and tail hooked some nice minnows in the 3""-4"" range Wayne has on hand at camp.They loved them as well but more near the bottom.Tail hooked compared to through mouth out gill and in the side was no comparison.Give them what they want.I bring 4 rods usually all rigged different.Used my new mojo ice rods in a med and 36"" long and they are amazing.Great couple of hrs on the ice."
6386520,prov1900,2020-01-15 00:47:00,544,Very nice! How big is the walleye in the last pic? You definitely lead a good life prov1800! Very jealous!!
6386566,Eckohlt,2020-01-15 06:38:00,3685,"John are you bringing a replica mount to the shack every time you go there for pictures hahaha,that's a dandy can u tie her up below the shack so she is there March 13 when I wet a line there,Karla might not like it if the front of her vehicle is covered in blood and moose hair lol,take care my friend,rod"
6386570,prov1800,2020-01-15 07:03:00,5010,Pretty lucky to go there.For fishing a shack its the best..was only going 50 mph on 502 one of the moose crossed to hwy hard to see them.
6386714,prov1800,2020-01-15 15:54:00,5010,"I didnt measure any of them.but would say 28"".caught 5 of them.and close to 40 or so mixed bag."
6386758,pjshorthorn,2020-01-16 06:18:00,5654,"John, just curious if Edwards Lake is out of the KC Landing camp or at the airbase location ?Might have to dust off some of my grandfather's old timey ice fishing equipment and come up for a winter break. I figure if I start snowshoeing from Georgia now, I could make it by the time the ice goes out. PjShorthorn"
6386766,prov1800,2020-01-16 06:49:00,5010,PJ.Kc landing is straight up hwy from bobbys corner on the blue lake rd not at airbase.Its one of the lakes on the Indian Lake chain.Dog sled team might be faster you have until late April.
6386772,pjshorthorn,2020-01-16 07:35:00,5654,"Yep, know exactly where you mean now. Thanks. Dog sled teams are a dime a dozen down this way......they are all spoiled and don't want to pull the sled for an old fella like myself. They just want to lay down in the sled and expect to be pushed everywhere. I don't know what is up with the whole poodle breed for sledding. I'd have better luck with a team of beavers and throwing sticks out in front of them about every couple of minutes. PjShorthorn"
6386804,prov1800,2020-01-16 09:45:00,5010,Couple of more pics from other evening.Needed some supper to.Also had a muskie on but dont get to land to many.
6386856,Eckohlt,2020-01-16 15:15:00,3685,"John I'm so hungry for fresh walleye I tried to take a bite of one your pictures but I guess i'll have to wait until March,rod"
