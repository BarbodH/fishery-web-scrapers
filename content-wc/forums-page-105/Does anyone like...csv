6386096,emma17,2020-01-13 13:24:00,436,"I think I read nearly every report posted, it's my way of living vicariously through the writer's trip (and it's cheaper than doing the trip myself). The trip reports are sort of like a game plan for me, where I try to plan not only my initial strategy, but to give me ideas on how to adapt when things aren't going well. Every tactic I've tried I'm sure has come from this site."
6386142,RichA$1970,2020-01-13 15:49:00,1159,"I do enjoy and totally agree on reading the reports from the guys who pay for their trips and don’t mind posting their experience good or bad. I do like reading the professional writers but I don’t see many that post any negatives / gaps which I understand as most outfitters would go out of their way if they are getting reviewed. One thing I always like is what was the top lure or bait, structure and any other keys on the trip."
6386154,bthomas3333,2020-01-13 17:08:00,465,"I usually post my trip reports here, but more recently I have started my own blog.B-"
6386174,yoopertrout,2020-01-13 18:15:00,1172,"I sure enjoy them. I've used them to create a list of possible places to go. Also, it looks like all of my fun money will be spent on something not fun this year, so I'll travel by looking at the photos that others post. Keep them coming."
6386192,andreindy,2020-01-13 18:55:00,308,"Just visited. Nicely done and the pictures are very helpful. Keep updating it, I will be coming back. I really enjoyed reading your ""about me"" section and your journey to fishing addiction."
6386292,bthomas3333,2020-01-14 05:39:00,465,Thanks. We all have an origin story. I'll keep posting.B-

6386484,JAY221,2020-01-14 17:28:00,877,"Yes, I thoroughly enjoy reading all the reports from all the different lakes and have learned a lot from doing it. Please keep them coming. Later, Jay"
6385508,Pooch,2020-01-11 15:51:00,4618,"Do other folks enjoy reading fishing reports from other guy's/gal's trips to Canada? I sure do. I try to write up a trip log/report after each trip for reference next year. I ran across some older ones this morning and spent a pleasant hour reading about where we went, what we did, who was on the trip, what baits and location were working that trip, etc.. Menus were also fun to read. So far we have not varied much from our plain old boring menu over the years. Need to step it up next year, but we go to fish not necessarily to eat. Though a good juicy hamburger or pork chop is a really nice change from fish after a few days.I was rattled by how many of our fellow fisherman are no longer here with us. Sobering.I see some guys on LS last year brought flattop grills with them. I had food envy for days.Pooch"
6385510,That Minnesota guy,2020-01-11 15:56:00,8293,We have some very good writers and photographers on this site. I enjoy their work.
6385790,kona77,2020-01-12 15:38:00,236,I always enjoy reading other fishing posts.. Always nice to see how other guys enjoy their trips and some of the information on certain outfitters has been beneficial.. Two of the outfitters I have used have started with reports from other guys on this forum..
6385808,martinbns,2020-01-12 16:05:00,1520,"I live here and I like it. I will admit I particularly enjoy the ongoing discussions about the different gear required for fishing ""Canada"" vs Minnesota or Wisconsin usually around super duper rain gear and bug stuff."
6385980,wmd,2020-01-13 08:57:00,388,I enjoy reading trip reports as well. There is always something to learn when one keeps an open mind. I have had 2 friends pass away whom I have gone to Canada with over the years. Brings back memories from years gone by. wmd
6385990,jambi,2020-01-13 09:06:00,504,"Yes enjoy reading, keep them coming. Good or Bad or Great or Average."
6386012,Carnhzkr,2020-01-13 09:41:00,964,"I do enjoy reading honest reviews and trip reports from your average Joe fisherman. I appreciate when someone takes the time to write about their experience; what was good, what was bad, and whether or not they'd go back. It's easy to get caught up on the hype when you read an article in Field and Stream or watch Al Linder's show when they're paid to write an advertisement for a particular lodge. Every lodge is incredible when you watch/read those ""reviews""."
6386058,vteye3,2020-01-13 12:08:00,496,"Yes, I enjoy the reports, learning about ones experience. Some are better than othersMBunk are the best IMO with Solo/MB being a close second. I enjoy reading all the reports including lakes I know I will never fish. I check the guest lists an have added items to our lists. Back 40 years ago I dreamed of fishing at the fly in lodges with guide service etc. I thenslapped myself and became determined to figure out a way to do similar trips unguided. Our group has been on a good 10 outposts trips and 5 unguided wilderness trips. No offense to the outposts but unguided river float trips in AK or getting dropped off w/backpack on Baffin Island (Nunavut) are wilderness trips. We have lost 5 men over the years whom shared those experiences. Two died in 2018 of natural causes (cancer)while in there 50's. I am more determine than ever to keep doing wilderness trips."
6386080,Lamp40,2020-01-13 13:03:00,30,"I find the reports very interesting, and relaxing to read. They helped in planning our trip. We will be making a trip to Horwood Lake later this summer, first time fishing Canada in thirty years, and I plan on writing a report when we get back. Really looking forward to it!"
6386094,David Anderson,2020-01-13 13:19:00,2073,"Pooch, Back in 2008 I started thinking about this, I have had so many interesting fishing experiences, writing a diary might be fun. After researching it I decided to use Google's Blogspot and write my own blog, www.davidjanderson.blogspot.com It takes discipline to stay with it but it is fun to go back and read about those trips, people who are no longer here, and the good time one has. Since retiring I haven't been as diligent about a weekly post but am still getting to it. I had to laugh the other day, I used to have my blog address in my signature but was asked to remove it, I understood the issue but that was when Golden ran Walleye Central. Check it out, it might provide you with an idea."
