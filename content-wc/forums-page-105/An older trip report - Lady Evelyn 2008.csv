The Lake was big and beautiful, the accommodations were as you described them, flashlights were needed after ten. We never got into decent size pike but the lake always provided me with a couple of walleye in the 27-28 inch class on all trips. We discovered a couple great spots for walleye. Wind was the key and the lake produced a lot of 19 and 20 inch fish for us. That was my problem with the lake. 17 inches was the limit and we did fill them but many prime fish were returned. Now some will say that 19 and 20 inch fish are the prime spawners but I've fished many lakes where that slot works fine. We may return some day because we really liked the experience at Lady Evelyn. Ken has retired but I'm sure his son-in-law and daughter are keeping a great camp. Thanks again for sharing."
