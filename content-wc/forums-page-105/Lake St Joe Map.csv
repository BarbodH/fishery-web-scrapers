6386812,stjoeguy,2020-01-16 10:52:00,979,"The Old Post website has a 4 part pdf map of St. Joe. These are the same maps that I've seen at the Winoga cabin and Slate Falls. Old Post must have them, also. In the past I've printed them and blown up sections of the lake into sections with individual maps that I laminated and keep in my tackle bag. https://oldpost.com/fishing/lakestjoseph.php That was before any software was available, however. Navionics now has St. Joe on it's maps for Lowrance and Garmin. The maps are basic, however. They look great and are halfway accurate but I wouldn't blindly trust them for navigation. As an example they show Boulder City, a known hazardous area, as being 20' deep. There are also user made maps available for Garmin users on the Garmin Quickdraw Community site. It doesn't have much of the lake drawn but it does show actual depths and tracks as created by users, including me. Where are you staying on St. Joe? I've got tracks, fishing spots and rocks marked on my Lowrance and Garmin units that I can share with you. Most are around the Winoga cabin area, but I've also fished out of Camp Lake St. Joseph and the Slate Falls Eagle Island location. This August I'm trying Root Bay."
