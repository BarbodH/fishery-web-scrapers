6385160,Fishoil,2020-01-10 07:37:00,1277,"Been there, done that with an epic trip 7 years ago with my 2 daughters. One had been doing trips with me for many years, it was the first trip for the other since she (supposedly) didn't enjoy fishing. She hasn't missed a year since and even chose her graduate school this year based on being able to go on our annual Canada trip. Out of 50+ trips north that one will be the one I always remember the most."
