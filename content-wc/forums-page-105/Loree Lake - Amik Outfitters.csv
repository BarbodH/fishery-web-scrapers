6387808,jnoelting,2020-01-20 07:24:00,6,I looking for someone who has fished Loree Lake in early June and is willing to share some info. I have fished several of Amik's lakes but this is the first time to Loree. From what I can see from Google Maps it looks like it could be promising. Thanks

Find the moving water, especially near weeds. The boats are decent, only 9.9 hp so it takes a while to get to the end of the lake. There is a spot on the far southeast side of lake that narrows to maybe 40 yards- lots of boulders. Find a spot to anchor and you'll get lots of Walleye action. There is also a spot west of camp on south side of lake where water flows in. We sat at 8-9 feet and caught beautiful Walleye (18-24Â”) one after the other. There are nice Pike in there too. We tried the lake just west of camp on north side but didn't do well. We also went to the far west end and hiked down the falls to find the blue Walleye. We would not do that again."
