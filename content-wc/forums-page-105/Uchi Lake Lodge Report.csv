I can honestly say though , guides are not needed on Uchi . Maps are available at the lodge and with an ask of one of the guides he will for sure mark off the hotspots for you and you will be on your way."

6384696,4x4bassin,2020-01-08 14:53:00,17,Great shore lunch's provided by the lodge.....nothing beats a good ole Canadian shore lunch. I bet you can taste those walleye and silver dollars right now
6384712,4x4bassin,2020-01-08 15:39:00,17,"We went in the beginning of August and the weather was fantastic , days were warm and nights cool . We had a bit of rain one day but that was ok. One surprising thing I noticed was that the bugs were almost non existent which made the trip that much more enjoyable. Best times to fish for us was mid morning (no need to go out at day break) and the last two hours of daylight , pretty standard stuff. Of note though we had no problems catching walleye mid day. The majority of our walleye were caught off of sunken humps and points in a bit deeper water (15-25') with our ""honey hole"" being a flat in 25-30' of water with various small humps scattered through out. The lure of choice was a 1/4-3/8 oz jig and twister or live minnow (available at lodge) Pink or lime green seemed to be the best colour for the jigs. One of my friends that I was with made up these awesome worm harnesses while we were there and they worked great as well . Attach them to a bottom bouncer and troll around the many sunken humps and points. Actually there was a narrow down or bottle neck that we found that was full of walleye and we caught one on almost every pass including a monster pike (25lbs) that hit my friends walleye boat side . It took many long runs but unfortunately we could not get it into the net before letting go. Anyways , Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoyed it. Uchi Lake Lodge is highly recommended for a Northern Ontario fishing destination. Any questions feel free to ask and I will try to answer them or reach out to the lodge itself and they will for sure help you out.Last but not least , My friends and I would like to say thanks to Shayne (Lodge Owner) for everything he did for us and giving us the opportunity to fish this great lake.....Thanks Monkey"
6384722,Mike Borger,2020-01-08 16:00:00,1554,"Awesome, thanks for adding all the photos, looks like a pretty good walleye lake! And thanks for the show of support guys, hopefully this thread won't get derailed anymore. My apologies for that."
6384960,10lbeye,2020-01-09 12:00:00,61,"Thanks for the great report. Uchi looks like a gem. Have to throw my .02 in for Mike, though. He has been a FANTASTIC resource for me over the years, has always taken the time to answer my questions and help me with lakes, outfitters, logistics, etc., and has found a much needed niche that has been tremendously helpful to those of us who love to head North every year. Proud subscriber to his service, and he is da man."

6383672,4x4bassin,2020-01-05 09:28:00,17,"This report is a long time coming that I thought everyone would enjoy.Myself and a couple friends headed into Uchi Lake this past August for some relaxation and above all some great walleye fishing. The lodge is located in a very remote area just a short flight north of Ears Falls Ontario. Did some research and discovered that this lake has above average size walleye and lots of them. Not to sure why but it probably has something to do with the remoteness of this lake and good fishing practices from the lodge owners and guests. I can tell you that this lake did not disappoint at all with several 27-28"" fish caught and at least 600 walleye caught between us over the 6 days of fishing. There is even a strain of ""Blue Walleye"" in this lake as well. The pike fishing is very unutilized and I would imagine there is some monsters in that lake. Several times we had large pike attack are walleye boat side. Next time I go up I will for sure spend a day and just target pike.The lodge itself is vey good and clean and we had no issues what so ever. They have two generators at the lodge so there is no worry about electricity and power loss. The food was top notch and needless to say you won't go hungry here, you might even put on a few pounds....The lodge owner is a good friend and great guy and helped us out with any concerns or asks . The guides and staff were honestly awesome and again helped us with anything we needed.The boats were big and comfortable with new swivel seats and new 20hp yamahas to power them , no issues with boats at all and this is obviously important on such a large , remote lake . Last thing you need is a breakdown on the other side of the lake.There is a quick rundown of Uchi Lake Lodge with pictures to follow"
6383936,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2020-01-06 09:17:00,240,Thanks for the report! A good read--looking forward to seeing the pictures. I will be at the Green Bay All-Canada show and hope to see this outfitter there. Were guides part of your package there?
6383990,lenray,2020-01-06 11:13:00,467,Enjoy reading a report from a real fisherman--compared to the guy who promotes his business with many long reports from all over Ontario---just saying.and just me......................
6384102,Mike Borger,2020-01-06 16:08:00,1554,"Thanks Dave, looking forward to seeing more details.Quote: Originally Posted by lenrayEnjoy reading a report from a real fisherman--compared to the guy who promotes his business with many long reports from all over Ontario---just saying.and just me......................Will assume this is directed at me Len. I should know better than to reply publicly to this type of stuff, but honestly you know I read this board. If you have something to say message me rather than take a sideways public stab. It's really not a good look. Not sure what your issue is, especially coming from someone who used to message me quite regularly a few years back with questions which I always patiently responded to. I hadn't realized I wasn't a ""real"" fisherman, thanks for pointing that out!! Does it offend you for some reason that I'm attempting to make a living doing what I love?"
6384110,Eckohlt,2020-01-06 16:38:00,3685,"Len I say anyone holding a fishing pole and there fishing whether There young or old or a pro or begginer doesn't matter as long as there having fun ,I consider them a real fisherman or fisherwoman,just my point of view"
6384218,ziggyzag,2020-01-06 22:17:00,125,"I to enjoyed the report thanks. But I surely do not mind a longer one with pic's and video attached. and if indeed Len is speaking to Mike, I guess he did not pay much attention to what he saw to not classify Mike as a real fishermen. DOT LET that get you down Mike I am sure all or I guess I should say most of us here enjoy your trip reports with envy!"
6384260,UPnorth3,2020-01-07 06:54:00,22,"lenray, you should make your tag line ""keyboard warrior"". Not sure where the issue with Mike lies. I for one read every report on his website, and really enjoy his contributions to this site."
6384282,kona77,2020-01-07 07:26:00,236,"Not sure where the issue with Mike lies. I for one read every report on his website, and really enjoy his contributions to this site. I agree 100% with these comments.. I may never fish any of these lakes that Mike reports on but I really enjoy his thorough updates.. Also appreciate the extra information/educational data he provides on how he breaks down a new lake and the different seasonal structure he looks to fish.. I like to think I am a decent fisherman but I am always looking to learn more about the sport.."
6384286,HeHooksHimself,2020-01-07 07:30:00,725,"Uchi Lake sounds interesting and we briefly talked with the reps at the booth at Milwaukee All Canada Show. We will take a closer look so thanks for the info. And, Mike, pay no attention to Len. I, for one, eagerly await a Mike Borger report and savor every picture, video and description of your trips. While I will never be a paddler I enjoy your special reports with Brendan and watching him grow up. Please, please do not stop your reports based upon one critical comment. There are negative Nancy's everywhere. Fish On! Hooks"
6384528,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2020-01-07 19:49:00,240,"I subscribe to Mike's site, and it is a treasure trove of information, trip ideas, and just good old fashioned writing, the way Outdoor Life used to be in the 60's. I have much, much respect for his work--I was fortunate last summer to go on three fly-in outpost trips, along with a boundary waters trip, and by the last trip, I was gassed, and didn't really enjoy it the way I should have. So, yeah, the guy is awesome. Really look forward to learning more about Uchi. This place, along with Pipestone Outfitters, is on my immediate radar for a late summer/early fall trip. Looking forward to seeing these guys in Green Bay in 10-12 days."
