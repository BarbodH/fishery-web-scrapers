Looking at the area for 2021 for a trip with the whole family, including two who don't fish but are happy to look at scenery. I've tried to suss out some specifics on the web but it's hard to find reports that are area specific, reliable and detailed. What I've gathered so far. Multi species areas, not great for numbers of 'eyes, good for size. opportunities for small mouth, musky, lake trout. Lots of rocks which seems like it's true everywhere. Some pretty open water there and it could get rough. Also seems like it's popular with a lot of people, both anglers and not. I don't know if anywhere on LOTW is what you would call either secluded (think fly in) or packed (think Mille Lacs), but these areas appear to lean towards the more crowded. It it's non-stop boaters that's a real minus for the scenery watchers. A few boats an hour is no biggie. Am I right assuming that most people want to be off the water before dark so it's quiet in the evenings? So, how far off am I in my assessments? As a guy who much prefers to cast than troll am I going to get a reasonable amount of action on 'eyes and bass? If I were making a long stay where would I be able to refuel and possibly pick up perishable food? Please include the names of landmarks like islands or towns/marinas to help me get oriented. Thanks in advance."
6383596,MN_Moose,2020-01-04 22:04:00,964,"Bigstone Bay and Whitefish bay fish completely differently. Whitefish is more of clear water lake trout water. Bigstone is a bit more stained but not much. Whitefish camps are more or less closer to Sioux Narrows. There are a few camps on islands south a bit. Much of the fishing occurs out beyond Whitefish narrows and Yellow Girl point. There's a fair amount of boat traffic in that area. Totem / Yellow Bird and Wiley point boats go back andforth there so much I call it A1A (Florida) Bigstone has more private cabins. Many cottages leave from Kenora or the other nearby marinas for their cabins. There are a number of camps in the areas. Witch Bay, Smith Camps, Moore Bay Lodge, Most of the good fishing areas are down south of French Narrows in the Barrier Islands area. Cabins definitely decrease and both traffic is reduced. It gets to be a bit creepy, there's no one out there. Of course if you have a problem out there you're on your own. I'll add a bunch of others camp names tomorrow."
6383604,jackpotjohnny48,2020-01-05 03:25:00,153,"As MN_Moose has correctly noted, Whitefish Bay is deep, clear, cold, infertile, lake trout water (i.e. Whitefish Bay is Oligotrophic water).Typically, the lake trout waters have a MUCH smaller population of walleyes than do the shallower, darker waters.BUT... the lake trout waters have the potential to produce some SUPER HOG walleyes. (And they are my personal favorite types of lake to fish).Last year, on a lake trout lake trout (oligotrophic) lake fairly close to Whitefish Bay, we managed to catch 12 walleyes on our second to last night of walleye fishing. Typically, this is NOT considered a very high number of walleyes to catch for a whole night of fishing. BUT... 3 of them were 29-inchers, 2 of them were 28-inchers, and one was a 27-incher.On our last night of fishing, we put 8 walleyes in the boat. One was a 30-incher and one was a 27-incher.So, we put 20 walleyes in the boat over the course of our last 2 nights of fishing, with 8 of the 20 being over 27 inches.Some people would consider this to be HORRIBLE fishing, by Canadian standards (due to the lack of quantity). Whereas other people (like myself) would consider this to be AWESOME fishing (due to the spectacular average size of the fish).Now, as far as tactics go on crystal clear lake trout (oligotrophic) waters, here's what we do in mid July to mid August....1. We fish the 6 hour window beginning at 8 pm and ending at 2 am the following morning. It is definitely an after dark bite. (We wear mosquito suits, complete with mesh hoods that go over the bill of our baseball caps. We also spray our clothes with Permithrin spray about 3 or 4 days prior to the trip. If you can find a way to avoid the mosquito bites, the night fishing on crystal clear trout lakes can be AWESOME for trophy sized walleyes. It's not very good for QUANTITY of fish per se, but the QUALITY is off the charts fantastic).2. We troll crankbaits anywhere from 3 feet under the surface to 20 feet under the surface in ULTRA deep water (Water that is anywhere from 80 feet deep to 140 feet deep). The walleyes suspend very high in deep water, as they are looking to intercept the ciscoes (tullibees) which are making their daily vertical migration to feed on the zooplankton. Last year, Smithwick Perfect 10 Rogues were the hot bait, and we were flatline trolling them about 12 to 15 feet down in 90 to 110 feet of water after dark. This tactic accounted for almost all of our fish.In terms of casting (which you mentioned is your preferred method), I probably wouldn't do it on lake trout (oligotrophic) water. Trolling is a FAR more effective way of covering water out in the middle of nowhere. I also wouldn't spend many daylight hours fishing walleyes on trout water, because, for the most part, I've found it to be a waste of time (especially when compared to how much better the night fishing is). I do, however, think that the smallmouth bass can be caught during daylight hours on trout water, whether casting or trolling. But walleyes on trout water can be real tough to come by during daylight hours.So, if you like CASTING for walleyes (rather than trolling), and if you like fishing during DAYLIGHT hours for walleye, I probably would not choose Whitefish Bay as a walleye destination. Instead, I would choose some shallower, darker (mesotrophic) section of Lake of the Woods. The shallower, darker, more fertile sections of Lake of the Woods tend to have a MUCH HIGHER population of walleyes, albeit they are not nearly as big (on average) as the trophy walleyes that can be found in the trout water sections.Anyway, attached is a 10-minute clip of Lindner’s Angling Edge, where they are open water trolling in deep water for walleyes on a cisco based lake. This is essentially the tactic we use on trout waters that are very similar to Whitefish Bay. And if I were going to fish Whitefish Bay for walleyes, this is exactly what I would do between the hours of 8 pm and 2 am. (Sleep during the day and fish at night).Anyway, here’s the video…https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55-AVdeGmuo"

The walleye fishing in that part of the lake is not super good, as explained by above posts. The scenery from the front yard of the resort is fantastic, actually close to remedial, a true art lover's delight. Pike and small mouth fishing can be quite good, also some crappie in some bays.

6383652,oldlund,2020-01-05 08:35:00,209,"I can't tell you what works in whitefish bay in the day, but I can tell you what didn't jigging, trolling bottom bouncers, casting cranks and jigs. Not a single walleye. What did work was enjoying the beauty of whitefish bay in the way out to yellow girl! So I would take the night bite advice. We did catch some smallies, pike and some beautiful lakers trolling lead core. This was all 3rd week of June. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk Pro"
6384358,Shortline,2020-01-07 10:27:00,234,"Yes - Crow lake is a little north. Crow is closer to Nestor than to Sioux narrows. Crow is across from Stevens bay - which is a nice, short sled ride from nestor(winter). Summer - it is worth the 8 or so mile trailering job to get to crow - awesome area!"
6384518,kzoofisher,2020-01-07 18:58:00,5144,"Early to mid August. Casting jigs and crank baits, top water if I can, vertical if necessary. I've got no issues with casting and retrieving jigs in depths to 25'."
6384850,Baseline,2020-01-09 06:16:00,3207,"If you want walleyes on Lake of the Woods go to Morson or Nestor Falls. The areas of Stevens Bay, Sabaskong Bay, Miles Bay harbor large numbers of walleye, pike, crappie and even musky. Whitefish is clear water and is more of a lake trout, pike and smallmouth fishery. The northern half has been greatly affected by an exploding crayfish population and is quickly losing its weed beds. The southern end of Whitefish still has some massive shallow and weedy bays which is home to some of the best largemouth bass fishing in North America. You won't catch any 6 to 8 lb hogs, but 2 to 4 lb largemouth are the norm. You will also catch lots of pike."
6386702,kzoofisher,2020-01-15 15:20:00,5144,Thanks to all who responded.I think I'll be fine at either place for a smallmouth centric trip.

6383808,That Minnesota guy,2020-01-05 17:14:00,8293,"I stayed at Tomahawk Resort a couple of years ago. Can't say enough good things about the resort. Clean modern cabins. Best docks i've had at a resort. Power to the docks. Rental boats(which I didn't need) were 18' or 19' Lunds I believe. 115 hp motors. Fishing in Whitefish Bay was tough unless you were looking for Pike. We found bays where you could get hammer handles up to 4# pretty regularly. I trolled up a 42"" Pike but the big ones were few and far between. Lots of the Walleye guys took the daily trip up to Yellow Girl as was mentioned. I'm not a Walleye guy so we only went up there twice I think.You will find as much boat traffic as you want. It can go from rare to you see boats. But it is never what I would term crowded. There is just to much water there for anything to be crowded.Whitefish Bay is in the town of Nestor Falls. There is really nowhere to grab a bite. The grocery store has a bit of everything but it's no Wal-mart. But you can get a hoodie or rainsuit of you forgot one. There is also a museum of sort there.I liked it there. You would like it there more in the late fall if you were a Muskie guy. If you don't have a map chip or good maps don't go. Even with a chip I only ran hard after a few times through a area. Some hard rock in that section of lake."
6383822,martinbns,2020-01-05 19:09:00,1520,"What he said.If walleye was my primary quarry I would go for Bigstone Bay. Lots of great walleye waters within 20-30 minutes, very pretty part of the lake."

6384062,kzoofisher,2020-01-06 14:25:00,5144,Would you say that's true if smallmouth are a primary target as well? If my brother's family joins us bass will be a primary target.

September? probably of no surprise to you that species of fish and their location change throughout the seasons. You mentioned the desire to jig. Vertical jig ? or, flipping jigs? time of the season will influence tactics."
6383708,jackpotjohnny48,2020-01-05 10:40:00,153,"This does not surprise me at all to hear you report this. I, too, have found that traditional, shallow, dark water tactics do not work very well at all on deep, clear, trout lakes. Before trying the nighttime open water trolling tactics which I mentioned in my previous post, we too had tried the ""more conventional"" tactics as well (i.e. the tactics which normally work well on the shallow, darker waters for a daytime bite - jigging, trolling crawlers harnesses, casting cranks, etc). We also found that they basically didn't work on the trout water that we were fishing. So I'm not surprised to hear that those tactics did not work on Whitefish Bay.The more time I've spent in Canada, the more I've come to believe that if you're fishing trout water, you need a totally different set of tactics than if you're fishing shallow, dark water."

Sounds like for this kind of trip, as much family as fishing, getting out early and late, my better option might be Bigstone. Still a lot of water but maybe a little more manageable and better for casting. I love to catch smallmouth and a few walleye would be a bonus. Figure I can deal with water clarity of 15' or less, it's what I'm used to."
