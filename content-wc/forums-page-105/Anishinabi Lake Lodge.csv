6387610,prov1800,2020-01-19 14:16:00,5010,"From what i know and have heard is that fishing has been good as usuall.They have had 4 big groups in so far this year.most guys fish the 2 portage lakes for trout cause they catch more there as fishing is faster and great eating size..A couple of the walleye portage lakes are fished also.good action but more of a evening bite.ill see if wayne has any reports from the guys that were there.he,ll be on his way home today from the green bay show.A new big fishing shack will be headed in there shortly and it will stay on anishinabi only.ill be headed in there also shortly and ill strictly fish the main lake i have a lot of spots saved from summer that should produce in the winter as they did in summer."
6387624,prov1800,2020-01-19 15:14:00,5010,Eckholt.i sharpen my jig hooks all the time so i dont hav√® to yank on the rod hard.lol.pinch barbs down to for fast releases.its funny cause i look to see if caught fish have hook marks and i really dont see many.Seems like i get bursts of walleyes coming through and as they pass by ill get time to have a smoke and sip on my coffee before there's another burst.Your buddies will have a great time at anish and iam sure you will to.Hopefully weather is good and i can take to out for trout at another lake.v
6387638,Eckohlt,2020-01-19 15:25:00,3685,"Sounds good John,I'll be ready for any burst that comes through you enjoy your smoke n coffee I'll cover for you,rod"
