1112887,Guest,2009-06-11 09:39:00,0,"I will be at Garden Ilsand Lodge, on lady Evelyn lake in July, as this is my first trip to this lodge and lake, can anybody give me information on what to expect, and a fishing report. I have fished several areas in western Ontatrio. I am just looking for a new location that is a little closer. Thanks"
1112912,micropterus,2009-06-11 11:17:00,450,Very good lake. I have fished it for a very long time. Joe will get you on the fish.
1113071,adempsey,2009-06-11 22:14:00,963,"Stayed up there last year in August and I will be heading up to Evelyn in a couple of weeks. It's a great lake and fishing can be amazing. However, I have yet to venture further west so I cannot compare it to lakes out there.You will likely catch a lot of walleye. There are numerous spots to fish but we found the best fishing was at night in shallower water on reefs and in bays. A 100+ fishing session is not out of the question. My first night I caught three 28""+ walleye in a row fishing with an X-rap alongside one of the small islands just southeast of the lodge.The other groups staying there did very well with walleye. Pike weren't as common when I was there but they were caught mostly during the day fishing the shoreline and deadheads all over the place.The fishing locations will depend on where the walleye have migrated to. Joe and his staff will likely give you the heads up on where the hotspots are.It's a great lake with a very remote feel. You will probably see very few other boats besides ones from Garden Island. There will be the occasional canoer too as it's a popular canoe trail.We never fished any of the remote lakes. I might do that this year.I am hoping to catch some whitefish and/or ling this year!"
1113177,micropterus,2009-06-12 14:24:00,450,"adempsey,The walk into Walsh is not too tough. Fish the east and north side. Lots of pike and big smallies. But one year we hit it when the tadpoles where everywhere."
1115390,SkeeterJeff,2009-06-21 21:03:00,31,"Pete, my wife and I will be there the last week in July along with my BIL and SIL. This will be our sixth year on Lady Evelyn at Garden Island. Joe and his staff will give you a tour of the lake after supper on Saturday and show you the hot spots. We do best in about 20 FOW backtrolling 1/8 oz jigs w/crawlers or leeches. Here in IN we use half a crawler, but we have found on Lady Evelyn, you need a whole crawler to be successful. Look for flats and humps near deep water. The service at Garden Island is second to none. The cabins are clean and you have electric 24/7, hot showers, microwave, fridge, and coffee maker. Meals at the lodge (breakfast and supper) are great, and they provide everything you need (down to the old Coleman white gas stove) to do your own shore lunch each day, or they will fix you sandwiches to take out with you. We bring our own propane Coleman camp stove, as the old white gas stoves tend to be a bit finicky at times. The staff at GI is awesome. They keep your boat full of gas and plenty of bait ready to go, clean your fish and pack them for shore lunch, home, or to eat for breakfast/supper. They are always willing to give you tips to where the fish are/were the previous week, and are good people. Let me know if you have any more questions? What week are you going to be there? Jeff"
1119260,adempsey,2009-07-08 00:55:00,963,"I just came back from Island 10 on Lady Evelyn.Had a great time! The fishing was better for us this year but we were up the first week of August last year. I averaged about 10-12 walleye per day, about 25% were in the slot size (17"" to 23.5""). I drift fished with nightcrawlers, gulp leeches and grubs. Most fish were caught in 10-12 FOW in the morning (fishing slowed down a lot after 11AM) and after dinner. I also trolled and back trolled with success. Smallies were caught in the same. Pike were caught fishing the shoreline. Other guests seemed to troll with worm harnesses in 10-20 FOW most of the time and caught walleye, pike and smallies. One guest had a ""secret lure"" that he trolled and caught the biggest walleye of the week (29"") (was a Storm Wiggle Wart Deep Diver - goes to 16' I believe). For some reason very few trophy size fish were caught the week I was there. Three compared to about 50 the previous week.The weather was overcast and rainy for the entire week this year. Mosquitoes were insane some nights. Bring whatever you can to combat them in case they are still bad.Anyway, I figured I would offer some comparison between Garden Island and Island 10. The biggest difference was the price. For some reason Island 10 was about $200 cheaper for the week per person. The boats were similar, but some people did have some engine troubles on a few of the boats at Island 10. In one instance the motor arm fell off on one guy when he was at full throttle! Crazy. The engine problems were probably just a coincidence and not something I would expect to happen on a regular basis.The food and service at both lodges is similar. Lots of homestyle food! Island 10 offered a sweets table at night. The service was awesome at both places. Both Ken (Island 10) and Joe (Garden Island) are great hosts. Garden Island gave us a few more options for lunch. Couple sandwich choices and you could ask for 2 or more sandwiches. Island 10 just gave you a sandwich made from the meat from last nights dinner. Again, not really a big deal since breakfast was plentiful.The biggest difference was that Island 10 turns off the generator at 11PM. So, you have no power and the only light is from a lamp or flashlight. Not really a problem for me since I was dead tired by then anyway.The cottages are similar. Island 10 cottages look much nicer on the outside and have very large decks. They also had full size refrigerators. Inside isn't much different. Island 10 also had daily housekeeping service. I don't recall if Garden Island offers this or not. Personally, that really didn't matter to me.I think if I go back next year (might try Kesagami) I will have a hard time deciding between the two places. Honestly, I really liked Joe and his crew but wanted to see what Island 10 was like this year. Anyway, I don't think you'll be disappointed."
1119417,SkeeterJeff,2009-07-08 16:29:00,31,"We leave in 15 days. Did you fish the main lake, or stay near I10? Jeff"
1120861,SkeeterJeff,2009-07-14 10:42:00,31,"Thanks for the info. PM sent. Only nine days until we head north, and I'm ready today! Respooled the reels and packed the rods/reels in the new rod case last night. Starting to gather everything up. I've already bought out Bass Pro and Cabelas again!! Appreciate you sharing the information. Jeff"
1119480,adempsey,2009-07-08 20:49:00,963,"Primarily near Island 10, but we did venture over near Garden Island. We fished the east side of Wolfe Island with success. Hit a nice smallie spot (hit about 10 decent sized fish in about an hour until the storm hit) and nabbed a bunch of walleye one morning. There is a nice spot that drops to 15ft near the shore and shallows up to 8 ft as you head east. I am pretty sure the GI staff know the spot.We caught the smallies drifting over the saddle between two smaller islands east of Wolfe (north/NW of Gull Island). It's also a great spot. Water is 30ft on both sides but gets to 6ft near the islands. Had good luck there last year as well in the morning and evenings.We didn't venture to the main lake much because of the weather. It can get rough there with the southern winds blowing and the rain/storms can come up fast. For the most part, we had some nice spots near Island 10 and the water was calmer so we just worked those areas.I was told that Idiot's Point (northeast of GI before the narrows) had at least 4 boats fishing there most evenings (I assume from GI). Must have been a good walleye spot. Last year Cookies bay was the hot night spot. The bay I fished this year was very similar in structure and we caught a lot of walleye there in the evenings. Last year we also caught a bunch of walleye on a small shoal west of Wolfe Island on the opposite shore. The narrows leading to Sucker Gut were also a popular spot again this year (near and south of the Ranger cabin).You could also try out Sydney Bay just past the Narrows. It was a decent spot as well (near the islands in the NE part of the bay). This was better for us in the evening or early morning.Also, several of the trophy walleye were caught near Snake Point the previous week (this is SE of GI and heads to Cookies Bay). This was a good spot last year as well."
1119737,SkeeterJeff,2009-07-09 16:17:00,31,"Thanks for the info AD. I'll drag out my lake map later and ""re-familarize"" myself with those spots. Have fished the flats in front of Wolf before, but never had much luck. Did get into a few small ones on the last night of our trip last year. We spend most of our time way south. Had very good luck around Brother Island last year, and there are a few good spots around Long Island. Thanks again, and hope to cross paths with you up there sometime. Jeff"
1120848,Pete eer,2009-07-14 10:01:00,14,"SheterJeff. I just returned from Garden Island and had a great time for my first visit. The dock staff is excellent and can help you find fish. We had our best luck in early morning and the evening, afternoons were almost a waste. We worked the east part of the lake from Garden Island working the eastern shoreline from sugar creek north. We also had good luck working the shelf's around the small islands around Gull Island. We used mainly jigs with leeches and crawlers. Send me a PM if you want additional information, as I will return to Garden Island"
