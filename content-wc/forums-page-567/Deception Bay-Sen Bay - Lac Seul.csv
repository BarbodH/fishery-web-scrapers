1118066,Batteryman09,2009-07-02 16:30:00,17,"Just got back from that area on Tuesday, fishing was great as always. Walleye were mostly in the shallows still, from 1ft to about 12ft was the best. Our best spots were soft bottom areas, I am sure that is because of the mayflies. Best bait by far was 1/8 pink and white jigs with a white twister. Throw it out let it hit bottom, RIP it off bottom let it fall... Fish!Hope this helps.Batteryman"
1119004,Warrior56215,2009-07-07 07:39:00,46,"Batteryman,Were you tipping your jig and twister with anything? How would you compare the fishing to years past? Did you stay close to the landing or did you venture out a ways? Just trying to get a feel for what to expect. Leave in two weeks, can't wait. Thanks.Warrior 56215"
1119332,crawler catcher,2009-07-08 10:03:00,72,Have fished two weeks out of the last three on Lac Seul. Fishing has been great compared to last year or even the year before. It's back to what it used to be...many over slot fish.
1119508,Warrior56215,2009-07-08 21:59:00,46,That is good to hear. The past couple of years have been on the slower side for me as well. July 22 can't get here fast enough.
