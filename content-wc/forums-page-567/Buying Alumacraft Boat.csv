Read any boat restoration forum and you will find wet foam almost universal. If the foam was exposed to water for a extended period of time it will become saturated. It will not dry out!!! I let mine set for months hoping it would dry out. To find out if your foam is saturated take a 1/2 to 3/4 PVC pipe and sharpen the end and push into the foam to take a core sample. The top 2"" of foam can appear bone dry with the bottom completely saturated. Here is a great thread on foam.http://forums.iboats.com/showthread....saturated+foam"
1120557,Steve of Madison,2009-07-13 12:42:00,230,"Interesting....But, you can pull out your foam and then replace it again. I was not aware that it was done that way on Lund's. I was always under the impression that the foaming was done with a gun under pressure to fill the voids, like that foam insulation in that can type stuff...learn something new everyday. Before I buy my next boat I'm going to take the time to take a tour of the plant."
1120565,Walleye_Wrangler,2009-07-13 13:03:00,138,Here is a link to buy the foam. It is a two part expanding urethane that you pour in. It is the same stuff the boat manufactures use. http://www.uscomposites.com/foam.html
1119286,Guest,2009-07-08 07:05:00,0,"Looking a purchasing a 16.5 Alumacraft Boat with a 50 HP Yamaha 4 stroke Motor have looked at several other boats but am considering the Alumacraft, but before I commit to the purchase just wanted to check with the folks on WC to see if I should add any equipment or if there are any know down falls with the boat & motor. Just being cautious."
1119334,JayM5209,2009-07-08 10:08:00,1050,"Chukuni, I'm sure you would thoroughly enjoy the Alumacraft. But, before you sign on the dotted line, have you looked at the Lund Rebel packages? Last year I bought a Lund Rebel 1625 XL SS package and absolutely love it. I'd suggest you check it out. Get a price on a Rebel XL SS with the Merc 50 hp 2 stroke, and the Lowrance upgraded from the x50 that comes in the package. Also, have the price include a trolling motor upgrade to a MinnKota. Then compare the Rebel to the Alumacraft you're considering, as well as comparing the Lund package price (with the two upgrades I mentioned) to the Alumacraft/Yammi price.I make this suggestion, not just bewcause I'm so pleased with my Rebel, but because one of my frequent fishing partners has an Alumacraft Dominator w/ 50 hp 'Rude and he thinks the Rebel is clearly a better ride and fishing rig."
1119422,Nimstug,2009-07-08 17:01:00,2605,"Chunk,This is my third season with the Alumacraft 165 CS which is a ""package"" boat and really enjoy it. I opted for the Yamaha 75 h.p four stroke and hole shot is not an issue. Jumps out of the water right now. Get in the boats and imagine fishing out of them. If you usually fish with someone else, take another person with you to take up space while you are in the boat. Check out the storage. Look over both the Lund and Alumacraft and enjoy the shopping. Nimstug"
1119606,Guest,2009-07-09 10:17:00,0,"Chukuni - my advice is to carefully check out the Alumacraft model you're interested in before you write the check. Although I don't have any personal experience with Alumacraft boats; a friend of mine purchased several of them for his fishing lodge in the Red Lake area. His boats are practically brand new and he just recently found out (the hard way) that there is a major hull design flaw with the Alumacraft outfitter type boats. Apparently there is insufficient drainage in the flotation compartments and the flotation foam becomes saturated with water. As a result; the boat takes on several hundred extra pounds of weight and does not perform properly. He also found out (from someone at Alumacraft) that these boats recently failed the factory ""sink test."" He's become extremely frustrated with Alumacraft as they have so far been unwilling to accept any responsibility. Bear in mind that these are ""camp"" boats - they sit in the water all summer and get lots of hard use. It is possible that this boat would perform normally in a normal personal (private) use application....but why take the chance?"
1119643,Steve of Madison,2009-07-09 11:35:00,230,"I have a good friend of mine that is an Alumacraft dealer and he told me that the dealer should be able to get Alumacraft to do something about a situation like that, if it is the case you describe. He has not heard of such a thing happening and was going to ask Alumacraft himself if they had heard of this. I find it curious because the foam that is used is not supposed to ABSORB water, although there are certain chemicals that can make it degrade, but they are not usually found in a boat. At least we hope not. Alumacraft if told of that situation, would certainly want to take care of it! I'm betting there is another skunk in this wood pile!"
1119836,Eyes_R_Us,2009-07-09 21:57:00,66,I have two alumacraft boats - a 1952 model that was passed down from my dad and a 2007 Navigator Sport with 90 Yammi. They are both great boats. When I was shopping for a modern boat I didn't get much interest from the local Lund dealer so I didn't do a real good comparison. The little bit of research I did seemed to indicate that the Lund was more expensive. JB
1120242,Dad-N-lad,2009-07-11 19:47:00,5,"We also have 2, one from the early 60's and a 2005 Navigator 185 CS w/ a 115 yamaha. Thoroughly enjoy both boats. Haven't had any trouble that was the fault of the boat. Some trouble that has been because of our mistakes, not fault of the boat or Alumacraft. Just wish I had a nearby dealer.Good luck, Im sure you wont be disappointed with either a Alumacraft or a Lund, I was actually leaning to Lund but just went with the craft cause I felt it fit our style and situation better. Was going for the same package that your talking about but found this one for about 800.00 more (the amount of what the tax would have been on the new one).Scott"
1120254,Richard B,2009-07-11 21:41:00,735,"I personally would never ever recommend an Alumacraft to anyone, even my worst enemy! I purchased a brand new 2004 Alumacraft Trophy 200. In the 4 years I owned it, I had to have it sent back to the factory at least once a year. I called everyone at Alumacraft and no one would ever seem to know what was going on, how the hull cracked, why the windshield kept crashing in to the console, the drivers side console cracking, etc., ect., ..... I thank God every day when I walk out and don't have to see that boat. By the way I purchased a 2009 Yarcraft 209TFX and could not be happier!!!!"
1120341,yarcraft91,2009-07-12 14:50:00,11487,"I bought a 16.5' Alumacraft Yukon 165CS with 50 horse Merc 4-stroke in 2006. It has been a great boat. There was a porpoising problem worked out by re-distributing the weight in the boat. The rig runs 34 mph WOT, loaded with all my fishing gear. The Yukon had a thicker hull bottom (0.100"") than the comparable 16' Lund Rebel (0.062"" IIRC), which mattered to me for boating in Canada. The hull and interior of the Yukon/Lunker models have been redesigned since I bought mine."
1120355,rebs,2009-07-12 16:09:00,7587,"I am with you Steve, something does not sound right about these boats at all. Any flotation foam I have ever seen is a hard foam and not capable of soaking up and holding water. This would definately be a safety issue could be and should be addressed to the US Coast Guard as a boat that would not pass there specification requirements for flotation. If what the poster says is true. I believe all boats have to meet Coast Guard standards and a flotation material that soaks up and holds water would not pass as far as I know.One more thing I would like to add is that you can get a lemon in any brand of boat, it is possible with them all as seen right here on WC with posts about different brands. Where the difference lies is in what the dealer and manufacturer do about the problem to correct it and make you a happy customer......."
