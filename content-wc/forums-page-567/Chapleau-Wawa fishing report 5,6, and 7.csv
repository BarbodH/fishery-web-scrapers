So I am going to put the three weeks into one report in summary form. We have had 2 weeks of hot sunny windless days and 1 and a 1/2 weeks of rain. It has rained 10 out of the last 11 days. Bass are really hitting but have now moved off their beds. Take softbaits and some leeches or crawlers with you in the boat. The pike are doing good and have been caught on stickbaits and spoons casting shorline and trolling in 10 ft of water. I like using the Bleeding Olive Rapala(NEW at Cabela's) so on your way up you might want to pick up a few size 5 or 7 for the bass as well as whitefish. The whitefish are still surfacing for the mayflies so bring your fly rod. I am going to get one this winter and learn how to fly fish. The walleye are being caught on that same color except on size 7 or larger. So all together the fishing is either really good or just good. Mosquitoes are getting to be thicker and you will want to bring the OFF. (make sure not to get it on your hands or the lure except for a prank on your friend) 5 days ago I was guiding a father and son on there first trip to Canada and Mark (the guy I was guiding) said he would have set his tip down and left in the first 15 minutes. We caught 3 fish in that time a 17"" bass, 20"" bass and guys you might want to sit down for this One Monster of a fish A 33"" walleye. On this guiding trip we caught over 30 fish and all of them were caught and released. Another one of our guest also caught a 31"" walleye last week and released it. Thanks for the C&R. And the rumor has it that you can't catch big walleye in eastern Ontario."

We have had lots of high winds the past two days and they are calling for more high winds tomorrow. Make sure to bring bottom bouncers 3/4 oz. and some little Joes red devil spinners. Troll in the evening along shorelines in about 10 to 15 feet of water at about 1 1/2 miles an hour. Leeches and crawlers should be the prime bait during this time. The ChapleauRiver does have perch so bring some slip bobbers and split shots and a size 4 hook. I have to tell you I have never fished the river but I do know guys who do. Hope this helps pay attention to my postings and I can tell what will be working before you come. As far as fishing goes right now there are lots of high winds. It's hard to fish and I had to postpone one of my guiding trips for this evening because of it. The guys are catching fish but it is hard to keep boat control. Trolling and jigging are both working. I did take a guy out on Friday night and the fishing was doing well. We were using jigs and minnows. It was as fast as we were dropping it down we were pulling up another fish. Good thing I only took a dozen minnows because the bugs were terrible. My guest only had a conservation lic. So we only brought 2 fish(16"") home. I know he was a happy customer because he just called back this evening to let me know that he got home safe and wants to come back.I do want to take a moment and tell everyone that I am sorry for the families that were involved in the tornado at Lac Suel. My family's prayers are with all of them and god will take care of them."
