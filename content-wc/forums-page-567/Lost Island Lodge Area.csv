We have been staying at West Point Cove in Souix L.O. for the past few years and landing the boat at the Deception Landing but changed locations because WPC was full this year. We mainly fish Deception Bay on up to Sen Bay and everything in between and we have done very well. My questions are: Are there some good spots that are in the Lost Island Lodge area on up to Deception? Has the Fish Fly hatch gone through yet or will it be done by 7-20? What combos work best for you in the late July time frame? I personally like a jig/minnow combo but do some rigging and spinner combos with crawlers too. What depths/structure will we be most successful on? I am hearing mid-lake deep water, is this consistent with your experience in late July? Any help is appreciated!"

The Red buoy right by the lodge is worth a look along with Pelican Narrows (have done really well there at times). ALso the far shoreline north of the island that lost island is on is good to pull spinners and crawlers along. late july would be jig and crawler mainly for me, with spinners mixed in and jig and minnow always on stand by. These are spots that we have caught fish on but we mainly go up the lake from there so we haven't given the lost island area the time it probably deserves. I would be targeting 18 to 25 fow mainly at that time but will have to experiment."

1120478,Mike Kansas,2009-07-13 07:50:00,1463,Shane with Lost Island will give you plenty of help finding Bear Narrows or any other place you want to fish. He has maps and good directions. Mike Kansas
