1045907,Guest,2008-07-29 13:14:00,0,Looking for a fall trip this year and this camp looks like the rates a very reasonable for a cabin and boat rental. Anyone have any experience with this camp as far as just the camp itself. We have fished Minnitaki many times but out of a different camp and always looking for something new.

I have also heard that fall fishin is great on Minnitaki. The cabins have good heaters, which you might need then. Compared to the other camps that are on Pickeral Arm, Timber Edge is on Butterfly Lake, about a two mile run to Lyons Bay on Minnitaki. You can launch your boat and dock it there at Timber Edge. There is a swampy channel to go thru to get from Butterfly into Minnitaki, this year the water level was so high we could just run thru there on plane. You can almost always fish on Butterfly, even if the main lake is too rough, and we have caught some good fish there, but not a lot of keeper walleyes. My wife did get a slot walleye right off the dock this year. Fishin on Lyons Bay has been disappointing for us, and we usually run thru it to go somewhere else. Have never fished in Pickeral Arm, so I can't compare it to Lyons Bay or Butterfly. In terms of the distance to go to get to the most remote hot spots, Redpine Bay and English River, it is 15 miles from Timber Edge to the entrance to Redpine and about 18 miles to the English River. The camps that are further east on Pickeral Arm are a bit closer to Redpine. I can recommend a very good guide if you want one. Post your emaill address and I will respond."
1046186,Guest,2008-07-30 13:00:00,0,RSH8- Thanks for the info. Is the guide you know the retired OPP guy that lives in Sioux Lookout-can't remember his name? After talking to Diane we booked the last week of August-wanted to go 2 weeks later but couldn't do it. It looks like it might be an older camp but we are not picky-just as long as the roof doesn't leak. We just wanted a short ride to the reefs on the main lake and in NE bay. We looked at the camps on the arm but I thought the price was out of line. We decided to rent one of thier boats-I know it is only 25 HP but with decent weather should be okay. What kind of shape are the boats in?
1046367,Guest,2008-07-31 08:09:00,0,""" They are 16 ft Lund boats or the equivalent. With two passengers they will do 25 mph. The motors are reliable and are good for trolling, backtrolling or jigging. Have never had one fail to start, we rented them for six trips. They provide swivel seats that are comfortable. With an extra gas can, which Timber Edge will provide for you, you can stay out all day and go anywhere you want. We took our own boat largely because that's what we bought it for, but the last two years, a larger percentage of the guests have been using the rental boats. You'll want waterproof boots or shoes 'cause the boats don't have a floor and hold water. In terms of reaching spots, it is a 45 min trip to the English River. You do have to watch the weather on the main lake and on NE Bay. They got pretty choppy one day when we were there, and it was a tough ride back, got bounced around a lot in our bigger 16.5 boat. Some folks have good spots on Troutfish Bay, but we have not fished there much. Hope you have a good time. Let us know how you do."

1120959,Guest,2009-07-14 15:43:00,0,"Fished out of Timber Edge the last 2 years with great success. Cabins are in good shape. Owners are very kind and make the stay enjoyable. This June I caught a 44 3/4"" pike and we had several walleyes at or above 25 inches with at least 100 over 23 inches. Lots of fish in troutfish, Lyons, and Rice."
