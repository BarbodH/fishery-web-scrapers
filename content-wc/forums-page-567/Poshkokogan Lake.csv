1120774,Guest,2009-07-13 23:50:00,0,Ther was a post a few weeks ago about Poshkokogan Lake- just south of Pickle Lake. It said there were 2 resorts on this lake. I cannot find the names and information on these resorts. Anyone know names of resorts and fishing information on this lake? many thanks

I've never stayed at Austin's but have been going to NA for the past 12 years and will be there again next year. Let me know if you want any more info about them.
