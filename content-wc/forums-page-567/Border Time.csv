Do they still run random criminal history checks and personell checks or since they have passports and have already gone through that, the only occasional spot checks of the vehicles/boats is all that holds you up??"

Crossed back on Sat. the 11th at about 2:00 PM and had 2 cars in front of us-total time 10 minutes. Couple that met us up there crossed at Baudette. They had truck and trailer totally searched going in-coming back agent lifted boat cover and looked in.
