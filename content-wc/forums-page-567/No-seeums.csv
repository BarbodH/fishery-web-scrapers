1115642,Backwater Eddy,2009-06-22 18:52:00,3871,"I would treat the mesh screen itself with a bug barrier spray. 3-M Ultrathon spray would be a pick of mine, there are others too. Perimeter barrier systems such as Thermacell products are also effective. Put the mesh in a gallon zip-lock and fog it down good, a few times even. Couldn't hurt to use the same spray barrier to do your perimeter around your bunks too.That should at least discourage them from even landing on it, and you."

1117954,OFxCoyote,2009-07-02 07:07:00,15,"You can laugh but we take flea collars for dogs and keep one in our pocket and we also put one around our ankle. When we get out of the bed in the morning, we throw one in the sleeping bag as well. Have never had a problem with any of the bugs. Just make sure to ""snap"" the collar to activate it, some require a quick tug at both ends for them to work."
1117965,ret-ro,2009-07-02 07:58:00,41,"They were the worst I've ever seen in 15+ years for us on the English river. They were only around back at camp in the evening, but they made it impossible to sit out at night. Ultrathon was helpful, but not a complete deterrent."

1119361,eyecatcher01,2009-07-08 12:17:00,631,never even heard of these little pests...read about it here cple weeks ago and blew it off. 4 days ago...dam! was doing yard work towards evening and kept swating these pesty lil tiny gnats....i guess it was these *******s. prolly had 20 bites on my legs and holly buckets do they itch.I KNOW WHAT THEY ARE NOW
1119432,Backwater Eddy,2009-07-08 17:47:00,3871,That's why they call them Gnats.....cuz dar Gnasty little critters.
1119941,OFxCoyote,2009-07-10 10:00:00,15,LOL Thats a pretty good one.
575552,Guest,2008-06-27 22:59:00,0,Last year the SOB's came thru the screens in the camper and caused considerable angst not to mention itching. Whats you best cure for these beasties??? What can you spray on the screens that works? ON you person? If you are allergic to insect bites these things can make your life #### especially when you are trying to sleep!!!!
575559,CrazyTexan,2008-06-28 12:43:00,12,"Sorry, Guess no one has ever seen em..."
575560,Dipstick,2008-06-28 12:55:00,101,"I wouldn't spray anything on the screen that may dissolve it. Are they actually coming in thru the screen? Most of the campers use screening that is no-seeum proof. I found that my problem was not the screening but small openings around the canvas in the pop-up camper. Easily stuffed with a paper towel. I used to light an insect coil before bedtime and let it burn for a while before actually going to bed. This killed all the flying stuff before we settled in and didn't have to use the spray bombs. I learned to put the burning coil out before going to bed, as I used to wake up with a headache if I let it burn all nite, even if the screen was left open. Another bush trick is wear an old white dress shirt with long sleeves when out in the bush. Several benefits: white shirt is cool and the colour doesn't attract biting insects, insects can't penetrate the tight weave of the shirt, ladies think you are a rich executive, guides think you may be a big tipper, wife thinks you are going on a business trip.

575561,Guest,2008-06-28 13:04:00,0,Hi. can you put smaller screening material on the windows? thats one reason we dont do the camping thing.
575585,Bill Krejca,2008-06-29 09:02:00,6107,Burning coil before bed sems to help. Close door/flaps where there are screens. Coil should be out before retiring.
575591,Guest,2008-06-29 10:55:00,0,"We just got back from Minaki, and they were bad this year -- worst that I've ever seen them in 25+ years. I know it doesn't help much for a camper or while sleeping, but we found that sunscreen seemed to slow them down to the point that you could at least see them and flick them off before they bit while you were fishing. We sprayed the 4 corners of the windows in the cabin with a little Black Flag Insect Spray, and that seemed to keep them out of the cabin when we had the windows open. But I don't know if you'd be able to do that in your camper. Chuck"
575603,Guest,2008-06-29 17:45:00,0,"Chuck, I was there from the 13th-20th and I don't think I saw any kind of biting insect the whole week there....strange that you had such a problem. PS...where are you from?"
575614,Guest,2008-06-29 20:32:00,0,"I'm near Springfield, IL and we were at Sunset Point across from the old Minaki Lodge on the other side of the river. We had lots of the no-see-um's in the morning and evening at the cabin, and in certain areas while fishing during the day. Good thing mosquitoes hadn't shown up (yet). Chuck"
575621,Guest,2008-06-29 22:49:00,0,Some one told me to spray the screens with lemon pledge? Ever heard of that?
1115371,Glenman12,2009-06-21 20:16:00,762,Im only bumping this thread because I got back Friday from our Canada trip and learned the hard way what No Seeums are...never had a problem with them in over 25 years of going up north...vicious little f'rs
