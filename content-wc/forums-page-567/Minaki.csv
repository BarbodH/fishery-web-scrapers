1120939,nswenso1,2009-07-14 14:49:00,4,All of our fish came on the south end of little sand and the entrance to big sand. Anything with rocks and weeds seemed to hold fish!
1116079,nswenso1,2009-06-24 10:42:00,4,"Anyone have any reports for Minaki in the last week or two? Heading up there next week. First time on the system, any tips, depths, areas, etc. would be appreciated.Thanks!"
1116323,Guest,2009-06-25 07:51:00,0,I leave today and will be back on the 6th. I have heard the fishing has picked up the past week with water temps and the water is about 46 inches high (which is becoming the norm anymore up there.)
1116835,Guest,2009-06-27 13:56:00,0,"Just got back some of the best walleye fishing in recent years. Most were over the slot and the biggest was 28"". Musky and norhtern was good with many northern in the 30""to 36"" range. Biggest Musky was 40"" and 3 that were smaller. Big Sand seemed to be the best fishing around sand beach. Walleyes were also hitting at brush pile and the entrance. Hope ypu have a good trip."
1116871,freespoolin,2009-06-27 18:58:00,472,There should be some comprehensive reports soon as there's a walleye tournament at Minaki this weekend...

1117325,woods,2009-06-29 18:19:00,646,"Our group of 9 fished Minaki last week. All agreed it was the best fishing of our lives the last 3 days. (this was our 24th year there) Most caught at 15 - 20 ft depth in Big Sand around Trapper's and Sand Beach area. Biggest walleye was 30"", and tossed back many more in the 20 to 27"" range. Did have a small struggle to get the slot fish though. Crawlers on a spinner rig were the best bait. You will love it! Even had one of the tournement people bugging us about where to catch the fish."
