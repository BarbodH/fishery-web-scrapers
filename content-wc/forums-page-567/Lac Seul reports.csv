I went there for the same reason's better location to areas on the lake I fish. You will be coming in the day we leave. What cabin are you staying in? As far as the waterfalls, it is located at the very south end of South Inlet. You get there by going South from Bay of Islands, across South Bay and then to the very south end of South Inlet. Do you have GPS and a lakes chip of Lac Seul? That is a must to safely navigate to get there. Good fishing in South Inlet also. It is protected so if it is windy you can always find somewhere to fish. Also, good fishing in Scout Bay right by Fisherman's Cove if it's too windy to get out in Bay of Islands or McKenzie Bay. I haven't gone into Broad or Sunlight lakes so can't give you any tips for that area. In August the walleyes will be out on the reefs in the bigger bay areas. I travel as far as South of Windigo Point and fish islands and reefs down there too.... 17 more days to go and counting down!!!!"
1119472,Guest,2009-07-08 20:20:00,0,Thanks for the info. Cabin # I'm not sure I want to say 6 but I don't know. Yes we have GPS came in handy 2 years ago when we ran a couple of our boats out of gas in rough water. Would have slept on an island if it weren't for the electronics. If you have some coordiantes you're willing to give up were always looking for new places to fish.
1119536,Guest,2009-07-09 04:37:00,0,"Returned last night from 10 days of fishing.Stayed @ in the NW section. Water is up approx 2 feet and temps ranged 58 - 65 degrees depending where you were on the lake. Fished Mckenzie bay/Ghost Narrows and Scout Lake/bay/bay of islands areas. Best walleye areas were in McKenzie. Caught all the fish in 4' - 14' of water. Biggest walleye 26 1/4"" and Northern 30"". Good numbers of 16-22"" fish. Walleyes weren't stacked like previous trips. Mayfly hatch hasn't hit but has started depending on what part of the lake you were on. Best location for walleyes was south of Big Sand Banks between the rock pile south to the rocky shoreline. Where the bottom transitioned from sand to rock was best. This area would shut down by 11 am and was time to move on. Tuesday ended up south of small sand banks fishing in 4-5'. Pulled spinner rigs w/minnows and cranks for most of the eyes. Weather was in the low 70's and low 50's the start of the trip for highs. Set the hook!"
1119649,bigtimeelectric,2009-07-09 11:53:00,174,"hey leaving friday for same spot.... did you do any jigging?u fish steamboat at all?manitoba point? you see the opp out there? I have not seen them yet in 5 years of going up there, anyway were really excited to get up there, glad you had a good trip. do you know any spot in mckenzie that is good for northerns? cause we havn't found very many of those in any of lac seul?"
1119658,teddi,2009-07-09 12:15:00,349,there is a bay in the middle of shanty narrows on the north side full of stumps. try there and you will be surprised what you will find.
1119679,Guest,2009-07-09 13:14:00,0,"Bigtime: We got checked for the first time in ten years at Manitoba Point, the guy was nice, just doing his job. On thursday when he was out checking for fish."
1119865,Guest,2009-07-10 04:35:00,0,Fish were scattered and spinner rigs found the active eaters. Did jig one afternoon for 1-2 hours until they shut down. Fished east and south of Cox's island and did OK. The water mountie did make a showing on Wed. Missed that experience but many in camp were checked. Northern fishing in the NW section is fair. Best luck was in scout lake/bay area. More weeds in that area. Made it to Manatoba Pt. weather got real BAD and headed back to camp. The island east of cormorant islands were very productive. Enjoy... Wish I was there..
1119913,Mark R,2009-07-10 08:04:00,1538,I'll be up there the week of 8/22 thru 8/27 ZIf your there stop by for a beer
1119027,Guest,2009-07-07 08:45:00,0,We've stayed at Golden Fawn for the past 7-8 years. So there have been ups and downs as far as the camp goes. We had been doing a lot of fishing in the Mckenzie bay area the last few years and decided to find a camp closer to where we fish. We are leaving Aug 1st and will be there for the week. Can't wait.
1119094,Guest,2009-07-07 12:21:00,0,"Got back from Lac Seul Sun night. Fishing was not too bad, weather the first two days was very cold 60s and wind. Got three days in that was pretty good. Sunlight was fun, 100 fish day with 30 slots most 20-22 inches. Then fished Manitoba Point, great day there 80 fish day with 40 slots 20-26 inches. Depth was pretty much 12-15 FOW, in Sunlight was 8-19 FOW. Pretty simple fishing, bottom bouncer 1oz, 4 foot leader, red slow death hook, orange and chart beads, half a crawler. Leeches were good too. I think the Mayflies are getting ready to hatch, was fishing Wenasaga, lake was covered with them Sat, 4th of July. I hope this helps."
1119099,bigtimeelectric,2009-07-07 12:55:00,174,"bruiser, where at on manitoba point? we went there 1 year and didn't do very well.....was anything going at the sandbanks?steamboat bay?thanks we are leaving friday,can't wait"
1119114,teddi,2009-07-07 13:45:00,349,"fish the wind blown side. ghost narrows,the sand banks,steamboat bay are all working good now. broad and sunlight lakes are also producing good. i sent you a pm."
1119137,Guest,2009-07-07 15:12:00,0,teddi: What kind of boat do you have?
1119168,teddi,2009-07-07 17:12:00,349,evergreen lodge misty river or crestliner with a 60 hp yamaha tiller
1119225,Guest,2009-07-07 20:18:00,0,Any tips/spots for fishing Sunlight? Fished a lot on Lac Seul but have never gotten to Sunlight or Broad. We'll be staying much closer this year so will definately fish them if they produce like your saying. Also can anyone give definate location or directions to a waterfall in that area that someone mentioned on a previous post? Would like to check it out.
1119326,Hump,2009-07-08 09:45:00,578,I thought they had new boats this year. Can ou tell me where you fished successfully on that end of the lake? Thanks
1119363,Mark R,2009-07-08 12:26:00,1538,How long will you be staying at EVergreen? are you there all summer?
1119365,teddi,2009-07-08 12:31:00,349,"i,ll be there for 2 to 3 weeks starting july10 for sure. maybe longer depends. i,ll be up after that off and on all summer until the end of october."
1117467,Guest,2009-06-30 09:11:00,0,We're staying at Fishermans Cove for the first time this year. Have fished Lac Seul for about 7 years now. What should I expect for an atmosphere at camp? Family? Mostly Fishermen?
1117635,rather-be-fishin,2009-06-30 20:38:00,429,"You will find a mixture of guests, family, couples and just fishermen. It's a nice resort with nice cabins, great location, nice Wed. night BBQ put on by owners, & good service. Dan & Keith and families do a great job. I'm headed back there July 25th and can't wait to go. Where have you stayed and fished before on Lac Seul?"
1117640,Guest,2009-06-30 20:59:00,0,"I disagree with the low water, it may be down a bit from last year as I ""ran"" into a few rocks that I swear weren't there last year. The chemical spill supposedly happened in the nw section of the lake with a private company that was discharging chemicals into a tile than ran into the lake. I didn't think it affected the fishing much, but was told to hold off on eating the fish, so we threw them all back."
1118022,eyefanatic,2009-07-02 12:58:00,25,I am very interested to hear about the spill. Is there any supporting information? Where did you her about this? Thanks.
1118024,WalleyeWally28,2009-07-02 13:07:00,298,Asked Teddi about the supposed spill last night. He's living around Ear Falls and has been fishing Lac Seul everyday. He knows nothing about it and says it's all BS. That's all I know.
1118034,teddi,2009-07-02 13:56:00,349,the story about some kind of a spill is bs. someone is not happy about the attention lac seul is getting. just my take on the story. i have not seen anything on the lake. maybe the person who started this story should give more info about what it is all about.
1118036,WalleyeWally28,2009-07-02 14:07:00,298,"Hey teddi,What part of LS do you usually fish and are you alone. Just wondering so I know how and where to look for you so we can hook up."
1118044,teddi,2009-07-02 14:43:00,349,"i fish from manitoba point,south bay west. i have been known to fish all the way to vaughan lake and every where in between. i most times fish alone sometimes with my wife."
1118121,GreenLaker,2009-07-02 21:21:00,21,See you there... Same week at Fishermans Cove - 14 years running. Wouldn't miss it for the world!
1118273,Guest,2009-07-03 19:26:00,0,"OK, see you on the 25th. Its our 6th year on Lac Seul and cant wait to go!"
1116975,Guest,2009-06-28 10:29:00,0,Haven't seen many posts about fishing out of Lac Seul Lodge area. Bay of islands. Hows the water level this year
1117034,Guest,2009-06-28 17:46:00,0,"Just returned, water is low, fishing was the worst in 10 years. Not sure if the chemical spill effected the entire lake, but where we fished was terrible."
1117041,bigtimeelectric,2009-06-28 18:44:00,174,Chemical spill??????? Where were you fishing?how low was the water?
1117050,Weby13,2009-06-28 19:17:00,57,I never heard about any chemical spill on lac seul. We went to onaway lodge on lac seul june 18th - the 25th. 10 of us caught about 2500 walleye and about another 1000 pike and smallies. Fishing is the best its been in about 5 years for us on lac seul.
1117086,Steve Ediger,2009-06-28 21:16:00,97,"Must have missed all the chemicals. I am in Minneapolis/St.Paul on my way back to Kansas after spending the last two weeks @ L.S. Lodge. Another excellent stay at a truly top notch camp. The walleye fishing seemed to be as good if not better than the past few years. You know the L.S. story line - ""hard to catch fish short enough to eat"". The smallies were really going well too, with most in the 16"" - 19"" range. We spent very little time fishing for northerns but heard a lot of comments in camp about large pike caught. The weather was nearly perfect with only one day in fifteen that made fishing difficult. The last day or two we were there I noticed a few mayflies on our screens. My guess is the hatch is just getting started and should be in full swing in the next few days - that is, unless the chemical spill got to them. Can't wait to get back up there in about a month. Steve"
1117093,joeman79,2009-06-28 22:06:00,417,Glad you had a great trip Steve!! 2 Weeks oh what a dream that would be for me. 34 days I will have the pleasure of being there myself. Can't wait. Joe
1117136,Steve of Madison,2009-06-29 07:20:00,230,Wait a second....WHAT chemical spill? You don't just drop a Bomb like that and walk away........unless it's Bull*&^^.Anybody else heard anything about a chemical spill???
1117194,Steve of Madison,2009-06-29 10:22:00,230,"OHHHHH I get it, a guest to the board talks about LOW water and a chemical spill. But if you check the historical graphs water is about normal and he thinks he's being funny, by dropping the spill bomb! I get it, not really funny though!"
1117296,lcwhit,2009-06-29 17:04:00,104,"with the board as quiet as it has been, i figure fishing to be slow. could be wrong. haven't had a really good year on lac seul since 2004. maybe i've lost my touch. never know. i'll try again in about 10 days. wish me luck."
1117394,LoDo,2009-06-29 22:15:00,721,"I have two words for fisherman heading to Lac Seul, ""McKenzie Bay"". I stayed at Fishermans Cove 6/20 - 6/27 and we had to fish McKenzie Bay and the South Inlet for walleyes. The walleyes were still in the spawning areas where water temps are in the high 60s low 70s. All islands N & NE of Big Sands produced several big walleyes. Anywhere beyond Deer Island was great. We used jigs and minnows, bottom bouncers and spinners, as well as trolled #7s and #8 shad raps with good luck.Biggest walleye was 26 1/4 inch caught on a rapala shad rap. Several 24 -26 inch walleyes caught. Weather was great!Highly recommend staying at Fishermans Cove. Dan and family truely know how to spoil their guests.Best Tip: Fish anywhere beyond Deer Island and make sure to stay in the wind and find a nice ""walleye chop"". Good luck,LoDo"
