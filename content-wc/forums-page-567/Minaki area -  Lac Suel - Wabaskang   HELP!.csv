I am looking for erperiences on the these lakes and what one you feel is the best. I guess I listed Lac Suel as the lake I compare others against. I enjoy walleye, bigger northerns and small mouth."
1118794,Guest,2009-07-06 11:57:00,0,"If you are use to going to Lac Suel you will be very dissapointed in Minaki. There really is no comparison unless you are targeting Smallmouth Bass or Muskie. Despite what you might read on this board, the Minaki area is still suffering from years of overfishing, high water and poor walleye production. If the walleye fishing were that great the MNR would lift the restrictions that were put in place a few years ago. I have a place up there and have been going there for 30 years and I don't have an agenda to push, just trying to save you a disappointed fishing trip. I'm sure I'll get ripped by a few others on this board but it is what it is, I've been to Lac Suel and to compare it to Minaki in any way shape or form when it comes to Walleye and Pike is laughable at best. Having said that, I would put Minaki up against anywhere in NW Ontario that you could drive to when it comes to Smallmouth Bass and Muskie."
1118873,cruiseforever,2009-07-06 16:38:00,177,Thanks for the feedback Aaron. Thats the type of info I am looking for. Just getting an itch to explore new water. Lac Suel has been great to me. But at times I crave for a little less water and rocks.
1119201,wolverine fan,2009-07-07 18:58:00,71,"I'll chime in even though i have never fished Lac Suel. I have fished minaki for 10 years straight until this year, I went to a part of Lake of the woods due to cost, I caught alot of northerns but the average was 20"". In minaki i do not catch as many pike but the average is way better than 20"" for us and I have never not put a over 40"" in the boat each year. Now i do specifically fish for pike and small mouth, I do not have a clue how to fish walleye and can't comment on how the fishery is for that except what friends like aaron-in and others on this board tell me. There are two places for instance i can catch a northern every other cast in minaki when the conditions are right. I know this doesnt help in the comparison but from soembody who does target pike in minaki i have had good success on better than average fish. Sorry to hear about your dock Aaron-in, sounded like brutal weather."
1119307,Reels,2009-07-08 08:35:00,2876,"Both Aaron and Wolverine nailed it on the head. The slot limiit for pike put in place years ago has paid off and it is a great large pike fishery along with monster muskie and great small mouth fishing. I missed last year so can not comment on the eyes lately, but going 20+ years I have seen it hurt and that triggered the new limits. Sounds like things have picked up a bit though if the posts are correct. I havent heard anything fromt he tourney though on what was hot and average size."
1119526,Guest,2009-07-09 00:18:00,0,"I can't tell you anything about Lac Seul because I haven't fished it...have heard alot of great things though. However, I've fished Wabaskang over 30 years. Thanks to slots on the northerns it has become a great fishery. I primarily fish them and every trip catch several over 36 inches with many over 40 inches. They aren't easy to catch but if you target them, get the right weather conditions, and have a little luck, you'll catch them. Walleye fishing has improved greatly over the last several years as well. One of the difficult aspects of wabaskang is its abundance of weedbeds. This makes novice or new anglers to the lake get frustrated by not catching fish. I ask them where they are fishing and they never respond weeds. You've got to fish weeds in the summer on Wabaskang to catch alot of walleyes. There are good rock reefs as well but the majority of the fish stay in the weeds until mid to late August. Finally, smallmouths are extremely underfished and if targeted could provide consistent action all the way through mid July as they are shallow most of the summer. Last week we fished them sparingly and caught tons of them on topwater, spinnerbaits, and x-raps. In conclusion...Wabaskang is a good bet if you are patient and not afraid of weeds. One of its positives is if the wind blows you still can get on the lake and fish no matter what as there are several areas and fingers that are fishable in any wind. However, I wouldn't put it against Lac Seul for numbers because its alot smaller lake and not capable of competing with it. If you like peace and quiet and still able to catch alot of fish, try Wabaskang."
1119552,Guest,2009-07-09 06:45:00,0,"Hey Big Mike, Not to hijack the post, but it sounds like you know Wabi pretty well. I am going up over Labor Day this year and would be curious to hear any advice you have about locating walleyes, northern, and smallies that time of year. Do the walleyes still relate to the weeds that late in the year? Hope to hear from ya!"
1119587,cruiseforever,2009-07-09 09:08:00,177,From the sounds of it I will cross the Minaki area off the list. Big Mike where do you stay on Wabaskang? And how far do you range in a day?
1119777,Guest,2009-07-09 18:48:00,0,"In stay at Jim and Julies Wabaskang camp and tend to cover alot of ground, not because I have to but northern fishing involves alot of moving around to different weedbeds looking for active fish. Alot of the areas you fish depend on the time of year you are going up there as well."
1119780,Guest,2009-07-09 18:52:00,0,"Usually by that late in the year the walleyes have pretty much left the weeds and are setting up on rock points, leges, and reefs. The weeds are starting to die and are knocked down and the minnows seem to be bunched up in deeper water. Most of your fishing will be in 25 feet plus. Northern fishing is still good along areas where there are still weeds but don't overlook the same areas holding walleyes on reefs, points, and deep water near baitfish. I don't have much experience chasing smallies that time of year but would start by fishing midlake islands, points, and rocky shorelines. Good luck, Mike"
