Picked up leeches at Larry's last week for $36C a pound. Same as last year. Not bashing Vern's as we had used them for years, but a couple years ago we had eight pounds ordered for several months before a long trip and I double checked with them a day before we were to leave and they were out of leeches and would not have them for us. They didn't bother to call us with a ""heads up"" and tell me in advance. At least give us the chance to try to locate leeches before we left. That was wrong of them. We called Larry's and he was and is super friendly and helpful. Been buying from him a couple trips a year since. Pooch"
