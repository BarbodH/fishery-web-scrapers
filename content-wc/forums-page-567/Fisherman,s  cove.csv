1120551,Moondog,2009-07-13 12:10:00,362,Any news about the missing gentleman?
1120569,joeman79,2009-07-13 13:14:00,417,Skindizer said they found the gentleman last night. What a sad deal.
1120578,whirli_7,2009-07-13 13:47:00,11,here is a link from Weather.comA little longer video of the twisterhttp://www.weather.com/blog/weather/...l?from=hp_news
1120590,2746,2009-07-13 14:20:00,3206,I watched the video of the tornado on the weather channel and a brief interview with the lady that took it. I believe I heard them say it was the folks that own Onaway Lodge. If you've ever seen a tornado up close it's an awesome experience......one you never forget.
1120598,joeman79,2009-07-13 14:50:00,417,"I just had a customer come in that has a brother in Ponca City, Okla and his nieghbor was one of the guys that was killed. He had lost his wife earlier this year he said and was not going to go, but another friend talked him into it. They were a group of four. When they got to the border they did a passport check and the guy who talked the guy into going was not allowed to enter Canada. He evidentl.y got a DUI in Canada a couple years ago, and was turned back. Wierd deal how things work out. This guy swears it is true story."
1120691,Glenman12,2009-07-13 19:22:00,762,If thats all true I cant imagine how that guy must feel...he had to be PO'd to drive all the way up there from OK only to be turned away..and then to hear the news about what happened to his friends..undoubtedly he would have been a victim too..the Lord works in mysterious ways
1120712,rather-be-fishin,2009-07-13 19:53:00,429,"Tjsker, Timing and luck was on your side....good thing you left early!"
1120839,Steve of Madison,2009-07-14 09:19:00,230,"The video's of the twister were taken from Onaway Lodge, only about a 1/2 mile from Fisherman's Cove. I leave for Onaway on Thursday, quite a sobering sight to see. Several prayers will be delivered for the souls who lost thier lives. Play safe everyone, watch the skies, watch the water, and watch out for your fellow man."
1120070,rather-be-fishin,2009-07-10 19:36:00,429,Check out this news video: http://www.globaltv.com/globaltv/nat...Rf6_P6aRxjopPU
1120079,JDP,2009-07-10 20:51:00,1457,"What are the number of the cabin(s) that were detroyed? (Looks like Cabin 2 was destroyed?) What cabin number do you stay in? I'm just trying to figure it out as I stayed at FC 2-3 times per year from 1990 - 2006. Very sad to hear of the deaths, injuries and destruction. Thanks, JDP"
1120082,fishncamp,2009-07-10 21:08:00,49,Our condolences to the friends and family of these anglers. It brought back memories of the fatal tornado that went by just north of my home a few years ago. Sad.
1120102,rather-be-fishin,2009-07-10 22:36:00,429,I'm not sure which cabin's were destroyed. I think cabin #2 for sure and possibly cabin #1? Tried to look at the videos over and over and can't get a good look as to which one's it is for sure. I stayed in cabin #1.
1120124,tjsker,2009-07-11 05:28:00,301,Our group left Fisherman's Cove for the states about six hours earlier that day. We were staying in cabin 9B.
1120134,Guest,2009-07-11 06:56:00,0,If you go to thestar.com and click on the article re the storm you will see an aerial photo that clearly shows which cabins were destroyed. Very sad indeed.
1120151,stumcfar,2009-07-11 08:11:00,451,"Very sad story. Such a random tragedy, could have been anyone of us that travels up that way. Any news on Ear Falls itself or other camp damage?"
1120255,rather-be-fishin,2009-07-11 21:44:00,429,Cabins # 1 & 2 were the one's that were thrown in the lake. Cabin #7 was moved off it's foundation.
1120261,rockpt,2009-07-11 23:22:00,589,This is a real tragedy. Maybe we can organize a WC fund for the families and the camp to help them thru this. A few extra dollars can help during times like these. People who fish and love the outdoors are some of the most caring and thoughtful people. Time to pitch in. Golden or Juls....thoughts?
1120307,Hump,2009-07-12 09:32:00,578,"If you can arrange it, I would support it. Could you do the paypal thing as you did in the vacation give-a-way?"
1119880,teddi,2009-07-10 06:07:00,349,"any one having family or friends at fisherman,s cove this week should call the camp or the OPP in ear falls. a bad storm went through last nite,killing 2 and numerous injured. 3 cabins totally destroyed. THIS IS NOT BS"
1119883,tackleman,2009-07-10 06:21:00,444,"just listened to the weather network, they confirmed a tornado touch down. 2 killed, 5 injured"
1119888,tcasica,2009-07-10 06:35:00,14,Here is a very brief article.http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/capress/0...t_storm_deaths
1119983,Guest,2009-07-10 13:09:00,0,"Here is a quote from CBCNEWS: ""Two people were killed Thursday and another person is missing after what may have been a tornado touched down at a resort in northwestern Ontario. The storm carrying the twister blasted through Fisherman's Cove Resort on the tip of Lac Seul, about 200 kilometres northeast of Kenora. It hit just after 8:30 p.m., according to Ontario Provincial Police. Officers from the communities of Red Lake and Ear Falls were called to the popular resort, where several buildings had also been damaged. Several cabins were lifted off the ground during the storm, including one that was actually tossed into Lac Seul, police said. Two men who were staying at that cabin were killed. Their bodies were found in the water several metres offshore, police said..."" Here is the link: http://www.cbc.ca/canada/manitoba/st...-manitoba.html How tragic. Where in the world can one go for shelter around there? It's all rock - nothing to dig into so no basements, etc. Thoughts & prayers for the families for the two souls lost and one missing. Wishing the best for Dan, Keith and families (Fisherman's Cove owner/operators) as they rebuild."
1119992,AMPHIB206,2009-07-10 13:50:00,191,The CBC has reported that the deceased were from Oklahoma. What a tragic story.
1119996,joeman79,2009-07-10 14:28:00,417,"That is so sad, come from the land of Tornadoes to Lac Seul, and have that happen. How frequent are Tornados in that part of Canada? Our prayers and condolences go the families of this tradegy. Wonder if they were WC'ers? I know there are some here. Also hope the camp owners fair well in the aftermath. Have heard a lot of good things about the camp and staff. Sincerely, Joe WOW that video from Onaway Lodge is something!!"
1120013,Guest,2009-07-10 15:35:00,0,"Sad news...we're heading up to Lac Seul next week. Hopefully, tornados don't strike the same place twice. Check out the video taken by someone from Onaway Lodge.http://www.theweathernetwork.com/vid...r_bottom_title.."
1120025,Moondog,2009-07-10 16:20:00,362,Wow.......we just got home from Gull Rock. Would never even think about a tornado. Guess this is a wake up call for all of us. Our moho would have been sucked up just like a midwest trailer park. Gives one pause for sure. So where would you go for shelter if there was a bad storm up there? Go find a ditch somewhere? My heart goes out to those families as well as the owners of Fisherman's Cove. This will be real hard to get over.
1120054,rather-be-fishin,2009-07-10 18:39:00,429,"I am SHOCKED AND SADDENED by this AWFUL news....my hopes and prayers go out to Dan, Keith & families (owners) and all the families affected by this devastating storm......I have made several trips to Fisherman's Cove Resort and it is always the highlight of my year!!! I will await more news on the outcome of this tornado."
1120069,Glenman12,2009-07-10 19:32:00,762,Several years ago we were at Cedar Lake in Perrault Falls when a bad storm hit..later the guy who worked the dock said that a tornado blew right down the narrows in from off the resort..I thought he was full of BS..tornados in NW Ontario?..come on..what do I know My thoughts and prayers go out to the families off those killed and injured and also to the camp owners and their staff
