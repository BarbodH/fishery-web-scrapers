We had been launching at the public access across from Fisherman Cove this week and had been out fishing earlier that day when the storms started to come through. Most if not all boats came off the lake in the aftennoon due to very hard rain, lighting and winds. However, by 2:30 it cleared up and in fact the sun came out - typical Ontario weather. There was still very high cloud banks off in the distance that looked to be trouble so we called it a day around 4PM. It was said to learn that four hours later these clouds led to more severe weather and the eventual loss of peoples lifes. My prayers go out to the families."
