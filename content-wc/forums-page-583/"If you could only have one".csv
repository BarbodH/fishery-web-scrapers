1098071,Larry Mac,2009-04-18 11:28:00,530,"With our adventure season drawing closer by the day, I would like to pose this question to all. When we head North we always make our lists and check it twice. We know depending on where we are going we might have only what we bring with us. I am curious, if you were to bring only one lure/technique per species what would it be. I do understand many things contribute to what and how we fish. This would be your suggestion on the overall best of the best. This may help many of us whether experienced or novices make the most of our adventures. Please feel free to respond back to individuals on how and where they fish their best of the best. Here is my list; Thank you in advance.Walleye-Pink jig/minnowPike-Johnson Silver Minnow weed lessSmallmouth bass-Tube jig/crawfish tubePerch-Chartreuse jig/minnowLake Trout-?Musky-?Thank you,Larry Mac"
