1096549,Walleye_Wrangler,2009-04-13 07:47:00,138,Lets here from some of you guys that fish the east end of the lake. I know when i put into Deception Bay there are lots of boats. We do well around Manitou Rapids.
1097698,LoDo,2009-04-16 13:58:00,721,"I hear ya. I cant wait for the early season reports! To answer Walleye Wrangler, Ive been as far North as the fish sanctuary, East of Big Island and as far south at Manitoba Point. Always have good luck around the Narrows which is east of Big Island!Is Manitou Rapids the entrance to Manitou Creek?"

1048170,crew08,2008-08-08 14:16:00,1,"jam -thanks for the post. heading up to williams lake lodge on 8/30 and was pleased to read about the productive northern fishing...that is what we tend to hunt. couple of questions for you if you have a chance.1) where were the pike hitting on williams lake? south end in the shallows?2) assuming that the river was high enough to get through on the south end to lac seul (nice to be able to use the big boats this year) - was kleiners point in or around williams bay? how was the fishing in williams bay?3) you mentioned a ""big map"" of the SW section of lac seul...where did you purchase this map?thanks.."
1048255,jam997,2008-08-09 08:53:00,8,"They will give you a map of Williams Lake. We just hammered them in then North end of Williams Lake by the north landing. As of 2 weeks ago the biggest one brought in was 40"". I had one bigger then that on for about 15 minutes and lost it near the boat after he rolled and cut off my line. We did al ot of trolling with cranks and casting big musky lures and spinner baits. I had better luck on regular spinner baits rather then then in line ones. I tried every color and perch color that week was the hot color. Basically we trolling hte whole lake around `12' deep and when we caught a bunch we went back the other way. The north Landing is where I lost the big one. We also had 3-4 follows with 40"" or larger. Send me your email address and I will scan my map because I have 5 circles on the map where we hammered them. There is another bay on the sound end that we caught a lo of perch and that is also where my buddy caught that 27.5' 9.5lb walleye on a line green crank bait.[email protected] or [email protected]"
1048256,jam997,2008-08-09 08:57:00,8,Crew08 the water is at a all time high. There is only 1 place you need to keep it slow going down the river and that is by the outpost where the brdige used to be. I slo filmed a moose just beyond there feeding in the water.Kleiners point is about a 40 boat ride after you leave the river. Buy a map and it is marked on the map. Maps - I purchased a map at a bait shop in Dryden. they have 4 sections of LS. Get the SouthWest Section of LS.
1048607,Guest,2008-08-11 15:18:00,0,"Jam, thanks for info. We are heading up Friday fishing SW area of lake around Mahkwa resort. Hoping walleyes have finally hit mid summer pattern. Normally, find some spots this time for year with fish stacked. Smaller fish from 15-25 and bigger fish deeper. Sounds as if up to now fish have been relating to weed beds more then deep water humps."
1048664,Guest,2008-08-11 20:01:00,0,"Last year when I was there, there was a filling station/mini-mart on Hwy 11 east of Fort Francis that had plenty of maps. I don't know if they have a map for the area that you need, but its probably in their inventory. Its the last mini-mart located on the north side of the road before the intersection with Hwy 502. At one time, it was a Shell franchise, it may have changed."
1049452,JDP,2008-08-15 08:16:00,1457,"The store is called: ""The Great Bear"" and is still a Shell franchise. I was there a few weeks ago. Phone Number: 807-274-2221. JDP"
1093593,gary2242,2009-04-02 18:25:00,49,"Muskies Inc. sent a bunch of guys to Lac Seul to check out the Muskie fishing because of all the stories coming from Lac Seul. They posted a report on the Internet, which is interesting.http://www.siouxfloatinglodges.com/m...ing-canada.htmGary"
1096467,LoDo,2009-04-12 19:42:00,721,"I cant wait, Lac Seul is 8 weeks away!"
1096477,brwhite,2009-04-12 20:15:00,41,Tell me about it! I missed last year and I'm going nuts. I can't wait to hear the late may reports.
1044836,Jimmy Jig,2008-07-24 09:46:00,1905,If they have not spooned by now they are not going to!
1045098,Steve of Madison,2008-07-25 09:39:00,230,"They have spawned long ago. LS water temps the week of July 5 thru July 12 was low 60's in main lake and 68-69 in the back dark water bays. Fishing was good in the shallows along emergent weed lines, particularly in the back bays. This may have changed with warmer temps and warmer rains, and further weed growth. It seems that at that time the spawn was over and the fish were trying to figure out where to spend the summer month's, but when they bit they were aggressive, not nibbling at the bait."
1045471,Guest,2008-07-27 14:49:00,0,"Just got back from LS, TOUGH fishing!!! This is our 1st trip to LS in July(previous trips in Aug.) and for whatever reason we couldn't find the fish. Talked to a couple of guides during our stay and they were struggling to find fish too. The people at the 4 Seasons bait shop in Ear Falls said the fishing had been tough for the past week because of the mayfly hatch, high water, constant rain/fronts and the high winds that stirred up the water(seriously, the water was the color of chocolate milk, I don't know how a fish could see anything) We fished from 5-40ft of water from Goose Island, Lunker Pt, the Sanctuary, Sawmill Bay and as many islands/reefs as we could fish during our 6:30am-9:15pm fishing days we could find. The majority of the fish caught were under 15"" with a couple per day in the slot or over, the biggest being 25""(released) crawlers, minnows, bottom bouncers/spinners, cranks, gulp, nothing really seemed to ""turn them on"". Constant east wind probably didn't help. Very disappointing trip compared to what we've experienced in the past. Several people left the resort on Thursday and I only saw 1 group getting ready to go fishing on Friday as we left the dock. Nobody from our resort seemed to do well and in fact 1 group fished Steamboat 1 day and said they never caught a walleye. With gas at $6 a gallon, that's a long pricey boat ride. For what it's worth pink jigs seemed to work the best, although I caught a fair # of walleyes on a slip bobber and plain hook letting the wind blow it over the reefs. 90% of the fish were caught between 10-17 fow. Hopefully the water clears up for the future guests and they have better luck than our group."
1045959,wiswalleye,2008-07-29 16:23:00,62,"Fished Lac Seul out of Evergreen Lodge last week. Started out slow but we found a couple of small islands that were not much more than rock piles and hit them pretty good. Most were from 15-18 inches but we did manage to get a few over the slot. Primarily back-trolled in 6-12 feet. Jig and a minnow, any color. All in all, we were quite satisfied."
1046034,bensen,2008-07-29 21:14:00,155,"If it makes you feel any better, Lake of Woods last week was terrible too. East wind, high water, no waves on water, cold water temps, every excuse I can thing of, all not in my favor. Biggest eye of the week 18"". Very few & far between fish. Most were caught shallow on cranks around rocks. Humps, no fish there. Weeds, no fish there. Very slow. Summer of 30 years the locals call it. Poor Spring & Summer weather result in poor fishing. Next year will be better, I'm sure. We had it kind of tough on Lac Seul in June too, so I feel for you. Just not as bad as LOW in July."
1047544,jam997,2008-08-05 20:07:00,8,"Hey guys I was on Lac Seul last week also, but fished the southwest part of the lake. Our cabin was on Williams Lake and travelled the river system to get to the lake. We fished Williams Lake and my buddy and I hammered 90 Northern each day hitting on Rapala perch color cranks and green spinner baits. I also never caught so many northerns pulling crawler harnesses.Once on Lac Seul we found the walleyes hitting really light on crawlers and minnows. When we trolled they really like lime green cranks with some black running through them. Us on the other hand had problems catching eyes small enough to take back to the cabin to eat at night. My partner and I caught about 80 eyses aday with 90% being 20 inches or more. It was a blast. the biggest one I caught was 25"" and weighed 7lbs. My partner on the other hand reeled in a 271/2"" 9.5lb walleye which it took him about 10 minutes to get into the boat. We fished 2 points on Kleiners Point and it was awesome. Most were hitting in 4'-17' of water."
1047822,Guest,2008-08-06 23:13:00,0,"It sounds like you had a great trip !!!!! I am taking my family to stay at White Wing Resort next week (by Ear Falls). Any suggestions on how to catch walleyes------and how has fishing been. I have been up there a few times and caught a lot with jig/minnows and jigs/crawlers. Any suggestions ??? Also, are there any good lake trout lakes in the area. I usually fish Cliff Lake one day and do pretty well. Bruce"
1047992,LoDo,2008-08-07 16:25:00,721,"Jam, Sounds like you had a blast! Im headed to Lac Seul Lodge in Rat Bay one week from tomorrow. The July reports I read sounded terrible but after reading your report it seem as though the fishing has turned around. Im familiar with Lac Seul, however have not heard of Klieners Point. Where is Klieners Point? We will be fishing around the BIG ISLAND in McKenzie most days.Thanks,LoDo"
1048035,jam997,2008-08-07 20:21:00,8,"The day before we left I was told fishing was 3 weeks behind. We had great weather and the I tried every color jig in the box and they only hit on yellowish/green super glow Northland jigs. When it wasn't windy i used 1/4 oz jigs, but the wind kept shifting and could keep constant pressure on the bottom and switched to 3/8 oz jigs. The hit so light that I kept the jig on the bottom and raised it every 5-10 seconds and kept the rod tip up. You could hardly see the tip move amd I was setting the hook. Crawlers worked the best. I ran out of minnows and tried the gulp live with leeches and minnows and didn't a thing with them. Originally while trolling they hit on bright lime green cranks and some with lime green and bright orange. Most days it was sunny while on Lac Seul. I fished Kleiners point in the front of teh point on a large weedbed. The other side had huge rocks that dropped straight down from 17' to a few feet. We drifted 10 feet off the bank and pulled some northern out of the fallen wood. We fished around a few of the other islands, but kept going back to Kleiners point which is in the southwest section of LS. We tried quite a few other islands around there trolling and picked up a few eyes and northerns too. That point was our go to point!"
1048037,jam997,2008-08-07 20:28:00,8,My buddy has the big map of the southwest section. I think I have the GPS coordinates of it. N 43 49.957 and w 087 49.338I will go over to buddy and get the big map that we bough and see what other markers or islands that have names on them.
576045,kickback,2008-07-15 07:56:00,64,"I fished Lac Seul out of the Evergreen Lodge from June 27th through July 10th.My father and I had a great trip.Most of our fish were caught in the Sanctuary and Sawmill Bay.The lake is about 3 weeks behind schedule.The water temperature ranged from 60.4 degrees to 64.7 degrees during our stay.We caught fish on bouncers,spinners and minnows and jigs and minnows.I caught a few fish on leeches and had a hard time catching fish on crawlers.Most of our fish came from 6.5 to 9 feet of water.One day we went out with Shane as our guide.I have never caught and released some many walleyes as we did that day.We were in Sawmill at a super secret spot on Radar Island(smile).Found the fish with spinners then sat over them with jigs and minnows.We""burned"" 8 dozen minnows in a hurry.I caught 3 fish on just a minnow head and jig.I caught some fish on a jig with a piece of plastic but minnows were definitely the hot bait.Jig colors that worked good were,yellow,pink,orange and gold.Gold blade spinners with orange or red beads seemed to work best.Got to go out with Gary to a spot in the Sanctuary,it was too rough to run down the lake very far with my 86 year old father.We caught quite a few really nice fish,slots and over slots on a little point with some stumps on it.We had a great time with Gary,he bent over backwards to make our stay the best.Patty was wonderful and went out of her way to make us comfortable and welcome at the Evergreen.The cabins are first class,neat clean and updated.The boats were wonderful.Gary and Shane marked enough spots to check for fish we couldn't get them all fished in 2 weeks.Can't wait to go back,hopefully for 2 weeks in September."
576046,Guest,2008-07-15 08:43:00,0,"We stayed July 4 thru July 11 at Onaway, great trip but fishing was graded out as a ""C"" for the week. Main Lake was milky water and temps in the low 60's, water Level was as high as I have seen in the 8 years fishing LS. Previous post is correct, Lake seemed at least 2-3 weeks behind other years. Cold Rain and Wind made it difficult to fish main lake humps off Manitoba and South Bay. Mayfly hatch was in full swing in some of the bays which compounded the problem. Finally we were able to put the pieces together and found fish located very shallow along emergent weed lines in some very back bays where the water temps were high 60's. Emergent weeds were the keys for us. Normal hot spots like Stoney Point were not producing at all. Unlike previous post we were most sucessful with crawlers on a spinner rig, but these fish were very aggressive, bigger the offering the bigger the fish. We even tried Gulp Alive to pull through the weeds and they liked that as well. I don't think specifics regarding colors etc. matter because all of this will change with weather and wind, and the Mayfly hatch. Some guys do well on one color or bait offering and another will be completely different, and somebody will prefer something else again. When the fish are on, they are on, it's being in the right place that makes the difference. I spent an hour in a spot that NEVER dissapoints, any time any weather. But this year with the water dead calm, the mayfly hatch was in full swing, thousands of floating bunches on the surface. I turned off the engine to just sit and after a minute the fish were at the surface slurping and sometimes jumping out of the water to eat. Hundreds of circles on the surface at any time, but no bites on my offering. It was truly a sight to see, plenty of fish, but all with a single purpose. Can't wait until next year, and with it another puzzel to figure out, that's why the call it fishing, and not catching. If it was so easy, it wouldn't be as much fun for me anyway."
576047,Hump,2008-07-15 09:47:00,578,Thanks for the report. We head up the 25th of July and stay at Evergreen. do you have any GPS coordinates? I have only fished Sawmill once. My e-mail is [email protected]. Thanks again for the update. That must be awesome fishing with your 86 year old father. Hump
576052,NateW,2008-07-15 20:28:00,96,"Hey Steve, did anybody dump their boat off the trialer this year??? ;)"
576053,Guest,2008-07-15 21:35:00,0,"Nate....good to hear from you. No incidents this year of note. But that was funny! not for all parties involved but for us spectators is was a good one. Everyone in camp except our group were either new or visiting for just the second time. Had to pass out my maps to all the newbies so they didn't get lost. Maybe you can tell me...is it a law in IA that you have to fish 4 in a boat. There was a group of 16 and they fished 4 to a boat all week, I know Blair tried to talk them out of it. After a couple of hours of that, at least 2 of them would have been swimming home if it were my boat, but then the barely made it out of eyeshot of camp all week."
576060,NateW,2008-07-16 07:21:00,96,Whoa...that is NOT an Iowa thing. For the record we fish two per boat and use every drop of our allotted gas--and then some. Maybe they...um.....I can't think of any logic behind that. We had to take a year off. Too many conflicts. We have already booked with Kathy for next year and might have a group of six. Did you have the new cabin again this year?
1044062,Guest,2008-07-21 07:35:00,0,"I know....I had to get in that IA thing. They were flying flags from MI. O state and IA, looked like a Big 10 convention. When are your reservations, I have yet to make mine for next year, this past week will not work next year, I'm trying to figure out what will?"
1044168,jam997,2008-07-21 16:13:00,8,Hey Kickback I will be heading to this gigantic Lake for the first time too July 25th. I emailed Hump and asked if he would share your GPS coordinates for the Sancutary and SawMill Bay area. I am staying on Wilderness Lake and will be making the big boat trip everyday on the water and was wondering if you would share your coordinates.My eamil address is [email protected]Thank you and have a great week.Jeff Meyer
1044352,kickback,2008-07-22 13:37:00,64,"Guys I haven't been able to log in,couldn't post.I don't have the GPS coordinates for Sawmill Bay or the Sanctuary.There on my chip.Both places are easy to find.I would imagine that the fish have moved out by now.I heard from Patty at Evergreen that it has been rainy.I just got back from the trailer on Sakakwea.Had a good trip.I out""big fished"" my father.Man it's hot here.97 degrees.Good luck.Bill"
1044833,jam997,2008-07-24 09:31:00,8,I am leaving tomorrow and I staying on Williams Lake. The owner stated that it has been raining all week and she says that the walleyes haven't spawned yet. Is that possible. I would think the water should be over 53 degrees by now. Isn't that when they start spawning? after you get across the border are there any places to purchase maps of the lake for depths and structure?
