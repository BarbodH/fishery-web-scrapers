1097388,Glenman12,2009-04-15 15:54:00,762,I ordered both last Tuesday and they came in the mail today..havent a clue when plastic card will get here but Im good to go...very convenient
1097402,Seanik,2009-04-15 16:17:00,218,"Just pointing out a statement that was not accurate, no need for name calling"
1097564,Mohleye,2009-04-16 06:51:00,368,It was supposed to be a joke....sorry.
1097567,elmo,2009-04-16 07:07:00,43,Thats all I need another card to carry and then misplace it from year to year. Just charge me more for my out of country fishing permit from the start. What will the card do for me? I do not buy my permit online. It will not speed anything up for me.
1097590,Seanik,2009-04-16 08:25:00,218,"Mohleye Thank you, I'm sure it wasn't mean't in a bad way. Our group has not been to Ontario in the last 5 years, we have been going to Quebec for our Canadian fishing trips. Although Quebec doesn't require an outdoor card many of the areas we fish require permits in addition to a license. The permit to fish the Gouin reservoir 2 yrs ago was 30.00 per year. We are considering a trip to Western Ontario(1500 mile drive 1 way) so this card will just be another small expense."

1085755,4Paulie7,2009-03-06 03:51:00,30,"The folks from whom we purchase our Ontario licenses have mentioned that, beginning this season, visitors who buy licenses will also be required to purchase something called an Outdoor Card or something. It seems to be a document above and beyond the annual license and the card will expire after three years. Has anyone else heard of this? Any additional information?"
1085756,Dan G,2009-03-06 04:04:00,31,"Non-Canadian ResidentsNon-Canadian residents need an Outdoors Card to fish in Ontario if they are 18 years of age and over. (NOTE: Non-residents 65 years of age or older are not exempt from requiring a licence). The sportfishing licence tag (one year or eight day) or the conservation fishing licence tag (one year or eight day) accompanies the plastic Outdoors Card. If you have never had an Outdoors Card, you can purchase a ""Non-Canadian Resident Temporary Fishing Outdoors Card and Application"" from one of more than 1,800 licence issuers across the province. The Non-Canadian Resident Temporary Fishing Outdoors Card and Application does not include the fishing licence tag. The fishing licence tag will be a separate paper permit.The temporary Outdoors Card and paper licence are effective immediately. Your plastic Outdoors Card will be mailed to you by year end, and is valid for three calendar years (including the year of purchase).Non-Canadian resident hunters can also fish under the authority of their Outdoor Card (fishing/hunting version) with the appropriate fishing licence tag.You can also get more information on the Outdoors Card by calling the Outdoors Card Centre at 1-800-387-7011. This toll-free number works from all of North America, from Monday to Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time).The above is directly from the MNR site: www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/LetsFish/2ColumnSubPage/STEL02_164832.html"
1085767,Babamel2,2009-03-06 06:12:00,414,"I called the number listed below and was told that one could purchase a license and card at this number (below). By next year they plan to have a web site where one can purchase them. You can also get more information on the Outdoors Card by calling the Outdoors Card Centre at 1-800-387-7011. This toll-free number works from all of North America, from Monday to Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time)."
1088803,BenBeattie,2009-03-17 16:31:00,232,"I believe the idea here is that non-residents will be able to purchace fishing licenses on-line with their outdoors card. The Outdoors card is like a credit card, with your name etc. and you will need this to purchace fishing licences. In some ways it seems like a cash grab but in others ways it will be more convenient to already have your licence (assuming you buy it online before your trip) when you arrive. Either way, you gotta have one to fish in Ontario... if your'e a resident or non-resident."
1088815,hogridnfool,2009-03-17 17:06:00,349,"I called the Ministry on a Tuesday and my temporary papers arrived the following Saturday. Charged it to my credit card, $9 plus .93 postage. Really strange phone conversation with the bureaucrat on the other end."
1088820,2746,2009-03-17 17:33:00,3206,I've found any conversation with a bureaucrat to be strange. To be successful at their job they must learn not to think.....
1088953,Mohleye,2009-03-18 07:34:00,368,"Just to be clear, as I read the regulations, it looks like you can buy a temporary card when you buy your license, and the permanent version will be mailed to you later. In other words, everyone who's going to Canada this summer doesn't need to get a card purchased and in hand BEFORE they go. Correct?"
1089000,teddi,2009-03-18 10:09:00,349,correct your card will be mailed to you and you can use it for the following 2 years befor you have to get a new one. this applies to ontario residents as well
1097131,happy,2009-04-14 19:56:00,34,"Has anyone that ordered their ""Outdoors Card"" gotten the plastic card yet? I got my temp 2 months ago and wonder low long till we will get permanent card."
1097206,JDP,2009-04-15 07:09:00,1457,"The note that came with my temporary Outdoors Card said ""The paper application serves as a temporary Outdoors Card until the permanent card is received in the mail."" In other words they do not have a definite date for the plastic card. I suggest asking the folks at the 800 number (1-800-667-1940) if you are curious. JDP"
