1094704,LIKEWALLEYE,2009-04-06 16:42:00,70,Last year our group was on 502 and noticed a portion of the highway was about to get fixed. I belive it was about the 19 rough miles about to get overhauled. Does any one know if this was completed yet?

1094809,Skywagon,2009-04-07 05:10:00,1106,"Yes, that work is all done. Quite an improvement."
1094897,Walleye_Wrangler,2009-04-07 10:14:00,138,wooohooo!!! I hated that section. Pounded the snot out of my boat.
1095483,Tonyo,2009-04-09 05:27:00,212,That is a bit of great news. On our trip up last year we watch a guy break an axle right in front of us. Just so happened they were staying at the same hotel in Dryden and it took them the better part of the night to get the truck and rig to Dryden. TonyO
1095533,Walley Guide,2009-04-09 07:46:00,67,"You'll still have to watch for those hidden drops and dips in the road. They can tear up a lot of equipment when you bounce over a few of them. Also, those ""Night Danger"" signs are there for a reason. I've had too many close calls over the years, no more night travel for me. More enjoyable during the day anyway. No matter how bad the surface may get, still beats it compared to the days of traveling when it was basically a 100 mile gravel road............Walley"

1095546,Lovetofish,2009-04-09 08:39:00,458,Plan on two hours.
1095559,Skywagon,2009-04-09 09:20:00,1106,"I would think it would take an 1 1/2 hours longer if you went from Ft Frances to Kenora and then over to Dryden, than the two hour direct trip from Ft Frances to Dryden. I have made the round trip from Dryden to Ft Frances 4 times since the bad stretch of 502 was resurfaced this late summer (once with a loaded trailer) and it is really not the problem that it was. We will have to see what it does after things thaw."
1095581,GNO,2009-04-09 10:16:00,153,"It is better than it was, but it is still not great like the roads in the states. The section around the Cedar Narrows Rd is still pretty rough. Like Skywagon stated, we will just have to see what it does after the thaw."
