1098860,Moondog,2009-04-20 21:48:00,362,Thanks!!! Will look into that for reinforcement/replacement for our motor home. My significant other is allergic to insect bites and way too much sleep is lost with scratching etc. Thanks again.
1098902,Guest,2009-04-21 06:24:00,0,The noseeum proof screen does seem to lower the air flow a little compared to regular screens. I had my camper retrofitted with the screen and it works great. If I had to do it again I would have them as an add on or something like that. The ventilation can be real nice in non noseeum season. Good luck
1097613,Moondog,2009-04-16 09:26:00,362,Lets try this one more time........what is best to keep noseeums from coming thru the screens and eating you alive???? and don't say keep the windows shut!!!
1097657,Jimmy Jig,2009-04-16 11:15:00,1905,"Shut the windows about 5:00 PM and open them after its dark. Or, you can get used to scratching, either one works."
1097770,Moondog,2009-04-16 19:36:00,362,"Well, I see that this is only an issue for me........geez......don't you guys get torn up by these creatures??? I have read about ThermaCell......any experience??? There is nothing worse than missing a nights sleep scratching the s#it out of yourself because these tiny blood thirsty insects are burrowing in your skin down to the bone. Not to mention the continued aggravation of the bites of the night before."

Although the smell of the coil is not exactly pleasant, it still beats spraying down the inside of a tent with DDT and then sleeping in it, as I did as a child. Bill Krejca"
1098193,lobo1,2009-04-19 00:18:00,734,i gave up on sprays etc and had to go for the lightweight long sleeve t-shirts and very light pants and socks...... these bugger don't seem to bother anyone except me in most of our trips but HOLY COW - they really like me. if you have electrcity where you go - a fan will help tremendously
1098241,Guest,2009-04-19 08:17:00,0,"As a guide for the last 11 years, and having grown up here (in NWO) and after last summer's 5 day canoe trip through Quetico, I'd have to say...spray the screen before you go to sleep. During 1 mile or 1.6 km portages carrying a 100 lb pack and a 17 foot canoe last summer, i would spray my bug screen hat before i hit shore, and that would get me through the portage. At night, we would spray the screen from the inside out to lessen the toxic air for night breathing. I was protected except for the one night during a major thunder storm when i accidentally laid with my right shoulder flush with the tent screen. I woke up with 73 bites in a 16 square inch area. I looked like I got shot with a shotgun in a shoulder. So, spray the screen first and pray. See no evil...feel no evil? Yeah right, no-see-ums are vicious *******s! Dragon out"
1098250,Moondog,2009-04-19 08:29:00,362,I did think of that but wondered what Off would do to the screens since it melts plastic in my boat. Have some skin so soft and I doubt if that hurts them. I also saw on some Ontario weather site that they don't even start reporting noseeums until June 25th so we are safe for most of June. I plan to buy a Thermacell unit as well. Thanks for the input.
1098445,Guest,2009-04-19 19:54:00,0,You can buy tent sreen very cheeply that is no seeum proof. That with some velcro stickies or tape you can improvise your own noseeum proof screen. Worked for us. Cut the screen to size over the window you are leaving open and tape or velcro in place.
1098484,Moondog,2009-04-19 22:40:00,362,Where did you get the screens?
1098845,Guest,2009-04-20 20:45:00,0,From a tent manufacturere here in Thunder Bay. They are also available on line http://www.mosquitocontrol.ca/produc...it-fabric.html
