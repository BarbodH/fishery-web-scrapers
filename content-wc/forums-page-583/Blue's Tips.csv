1096784,Dan G,2009-04-13 18:44:00,31,"The iced tea tastes different because we make it with real tea...not the pre-mix stuff full of sugar and all...puts hair on yer chest! Ha, ha, ha.I agree with Obabikon...by the end of the week the minnow lady don't look too bad. Heck...the minnows even look a little friendly!"
1098061,walleyeduran,2009-04-18 09:25:00,286,"#3 & #6 should be highlighted. We don't have a minnow lady but the cabin cleaning gals start to look like ""PAYBOY BUNNIES""."
1095669,Blue me!,2009-04-09 15:50:00,3,"Since I was asked to share some of my wisdom from past Canadian experiences in another thread, here is a little of what I have learned along the way, aka Blue's Tips, in no particular order.Background:Been going north almost every year since I was 15, will turn 50 this year while in-country. Can't think of a better way of celebrating the occasion, well I can but not that would be suitable for posting here. Canadian trip itineraries have included fly ins, camping way up north, and have stayed in all manner of fish camps from no stars to 5 stars. Have also done Alaska, gulf coast saltwater, fly fishing and even fished in Russia. Pretty much, been there, done that. Here is the goods:1) Don't feed Hawk (or anybody else) the last 12 eggs before starting a 35 hour trip home.2) Do bet your brother $5 he can't finish the last 2 pounds of mashed potatoes. It might cost you $5, but watching him writhe on the floor as that mass of taters works its way thru his gut is worth it. Kind of interrupts the poker game though.3) If you can't afford Canadian beer, don't go or don't drink. Life is too short to import Milwaukee's Best.4) High probability that the hot lure last year will never catch another fish, no matter how many more you buy.5) Don't lend your favorite pair of hook removers to a rookie. Better to take his fish off then to watch them sink to the bottom of the lake on the first day of the trip. I now carry two pair, one that floats for lending and my favs.6) Yes sir, no sir to the Border guard goes a long way, unless said guard is a bull dyke. Don't be sitting by the porn stash when she searches the vehicle.7) Eat well, it only takes slightly more energy to grill a steak then it does to open a can of beanie-weanies.8) When you get out fished by a rookie with a snoopy pole and a Zebco 33, sit back, pop a top and relax, it won't hurt so much the next time. Fish do not recognize talent or expensive equipment!!!9) Vinegar on French fries isn't so bad. But iced tea up north sucks. 10) Don't let the tallest guy on the trip build the latrine.11) If the guide does more fishing than guiding it is open season. Be sure to ask for the full blown shore lunch for the rest of the week.12) Slipping a good guide a beer or two will open up a couple of special fishing spots.13) If you bust the natives stealing your beer, it is best just to let them go. You can always buy more beer, but it hurts like **** to fish with a busted hand.14) Never met a camp owner I didn't like. But I am not there to make personal acquaintances and they are working. If you are in the office more than twice in a week you are pushing your luck.15) Quit griping about it and get a d*mn passport, now.16) Never get caught lying about not being lost. 17) First one up generally fouls the bathroom first and if you ain't the lead dog ..18) That minnow gal that was butt ugly the first day, is still butt ugly later in the week, don't let testosterone build up or your ""buddies"" tell you any different.19) If you encounter a bear swimming across a lake, DO NOT get too close.20) Never, ever borrow the hot lure from the trip dork."

Especially #19, your warning is a little late. I had a buddy who about crapped his pants when the bear he wanted to get a closeup picture of snagged the edge of his boat and tried climbing in."
1095947,joeman79,2009-04-10 14:12:00,417,sorry Blue
1096048,Walleye_Wrangler,2009-04-10 20:29:00,138,I was reading the post. I have a Yamaha on my boat and pull it with a Dodge . Still you can't be so quick to anger.
1096055,Glenman12,2009-04-10 20:48:00,762,be careful...dont rag on Blue...your posts will be deleted like mine was and someone elses was
1096108,Lazy Fisherman,2009-04-11 07:53:00,276,Blue Thanks for good morning laugh
1096164,Juls,2009-04-11 11:15:00,13414,"So were a couple of Blue's. Don't feel like you're singled out, or that that was the reason.We've had a lot of new members join up recently, and many of them have not taken the time to read the rules of the site...making our high paying jobs a little tougher.

Oh come on... they grow on you a little bit!!! hahaha... As a good friend of mine says... ""Canada, where the men are men... and the women are too"""
1096778,Golden Eagle,2009-04-13 18:32:00,2642,I believe we've seen a hit and run by Blue. 3 posts and out after stirring the pot and yanking some chains. Maybe wait a couple of days before responding to a new guy's post.
