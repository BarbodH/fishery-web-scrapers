1097762,Larry S,2009-04-16 19:02:00,666,When you make your own spinners what kind of line do you use? Does anyone use flurocarbon line?If so what brand? and does it last without breaking off or fraying? I have never used flurocarbon for my spinners and want to know if it is any better than regular mono or fireline Also is flurocarbon harder for the fish to see? Thanks in advance for any responses Larry S

My personal experience has shown that on some if not many days of trolling bottom bouncers and spinners that the flurocarbon has caught more fish. Nothing scientific about my experience though. I'm using 12# and 17# Berkly ""Vanish"" for no reason other than I started with it and have never had a problem with it. Most all of our trolling is in Canada on Shield lakes so abrasion is important. Thus the use of 12 and 17# line. If I had to only tie rigs with one line it would be the 12# test. The 17# has a little more diameter and seems to help keep the spinner blade ""up"" off of the bottom just a little more and out of the rocks and snags. Even with floats on a rig the blade will sooner or later get caught in the rocks. The 17# allows you to sometimes get the rig back and other times you will get it back, but the clevis is broken. I've also tied with 8# test and see no difference between that and the 12#, so I keep using the 12#. Sometimes, if the fish are not cooperating, going to a really long leader and 8# test has helped gather lunch. I think flurocarbon is definitely a plus then. Tried 6# on spinner rigs, once. The rocks ate it faster than you could put new rigs on. Sand and mud and 6# are more compatible. Pooch"
1098338,lassh,2009-04-19 12:32:00,553,I use 20# Seagar leader material. I think it is noticeably more fray resistant and not quite as likely to get cut by the toothy critters.
