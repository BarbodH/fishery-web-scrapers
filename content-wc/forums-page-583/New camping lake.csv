Camped on Neston Lake and fished it along with Vista Lake, Squaw, Beckington, Flindt River and Venessa. We have not gone further north and was wondering if anyone has camped on any of the lakes to the north and are they hard to find? We tried to get to Jutten Lake but could not find it. Is there a map that shows the turn offs from the main logging road?"

1098581,Northern Exposure,2009-04-20 08:39:00,29,"Try this link http://nomap.ca/(S(pvurbsruwc1ebiyk3fy3dxju))/Home.aspx. It shows roads, list lake depths and fish species in the lake. I work this map with ariel photos on http://maps.live.com/?vendor=google&pkw=msn_live_maps. After looking at these two maps you are probably going to have to drive the roads and see if they are passable. The conditions change from year to year. How was the fishing on Vanessa and Nestor, I never fished them? I have fished Squaw and Vanessa, some good fishing in Squaw, but not what it was 10-15 years ago. We used to catch giant northerns in there along with all of the walleyes you wanted."
1098634,slugger doug,2009-04-20 10:23:00,15,The fishing on Neston was fair. Only one good place to catch northern. The walleyes were small. The only good thing about Neston is the set up for shore lunch. Situated on top of an island with a good view of the lake. Vanessa is a lake that all the good fishing is at dusk in the narrows between the the northern and southern sections. We have not been up for a couple years and looking for options. Thanks for the maps info.
1098697,Northern Exposure,2009-04-20 12:29:00,29,"Have you ever thought about heading north a little farther and trying Pickle lake area? My group was thinking of trying it next year. Do a ""pickle lake"" search on here. It sounds like the walleye fishing is very good with fair northern fishing. There are alot of lakes with road access for camping."
1098709,teddi,2009-04-20 12:49:00,349,non resident camping is restricted in most of that area along with the rest of northwestern ontario. some areas you can camp with a permit only. some areas not at all.
