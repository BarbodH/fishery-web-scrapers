Mostly used for ice fishing so it needs to be easy to get off of quickly (where the height helps). Most chairs I have encountered sit too low and have not held up. Have any of you guys seen such a chair? Any thoughts would be appreciated. Thanks Steve"

The Coleman Deck Chair deluxe model will hold up to ice fishing use and summer use better. We use them in larger Otter tubs and in clam pop-up models. Very comfortable and convenient to use.http://www.coleman.com/coleman/image...26-302_200.jpg"
