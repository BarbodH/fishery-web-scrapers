I love going to Dog Lake, but it's not the most secluded place in the world. My question/questions are concerning some good lakes to drive to that either have cabins, or where you could tent out in north of White River. I have no idea how far North you can drive into Ontario, but I'd like to someday take a trip as far north as I could go into the Artic Ocean water shed and do some fishing. How far up have some of you gone? How did you plan out your trip? Are there any good places you know of say up around highway 11 north of White river to rent a place or camp? I know this is sort of a vague and open ended post, but I wanted to get some leads from those of you who have greater experience in the ""adventure"" fishing. I'm open to any and all suggestions. This trip wouldn't be until the summer of 2010 at the earliest since my wife is due with our first child this coming summer. Thanks for your help!Marcus"
