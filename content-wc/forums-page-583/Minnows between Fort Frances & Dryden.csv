1094371,Guest,2009-04-05 18:09:00,0,Does anyone know where you can purchase minnows at a reasonable price between Fort Frances and Dryden? Thanks!

1094432,joeman79,2009-04-05 20:32:00,417,How long will minnows in an oxygenated bag live in a cooler with ice? Hours Days?? a week?
1094478,Skywagon,2009-04-06 05:51:00,1106,"Minnows usually last us at least 3 weeks in the fridge if we change water at least once a week. Depending on temperature, minnows in a bag with oxigen, not in a cooler, in the open, may not last an hour. Cooler temps they do a lot better. Other than the Big Bear, east of Ft Frances, there is nothing until Dryden. Dryden has 2 baits shops with minnows. It is about a two hour drive from Ft Frances to Dryden."
1094481,5richards,2009-04-06 06:04:00,131,We're heading to the Red Lake area in June and need to purchase several dozen large frozen minnows for pike. Do these stores have them?
1094812,Skywagon,2009-04-07 05:29:00,1106,"5richards,I called Fas Gas (gas station-bait shop) in Dryden and they do carry frozen cisco's, which I would think are fine. If you are going to Red Lake, there is a bait shop called Bobby's, on the west side of Vermillion Bay that used to carry frozen cisco's also. That would only be about a mile out of your way."
1094837,GNO,2009-04-07 07:10:00,153,The gas station 11 -12 miles east of Fort Frances is called the Great Bear.
1095213,Skywagon,2009-04-08 08:08:00,1106,"I stand corrected on the name of Great Bear. I found out yesterday that the K-A bait shop in Dryden also carries frozen bait and large live bait, for those interested."
1095363,5richards,2009-04-08 17:17:00,131,Thank you for the responses. I will contact the referenced locations and get prices/details. To all a prosperous spring and summer. --- Let's help support the industry and create memories that won't be forgotten!
