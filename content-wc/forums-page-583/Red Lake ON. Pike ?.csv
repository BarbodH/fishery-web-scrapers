1094598,stevensinks,2009-04-06 11:52:00,330,Went to Red Lake for the first time last year and found really good Walleye. Im going back the last week of July this year and would really like to find some good pike fishing. So can any of you tell me about the Pike in Red Lake? We will be on the West end of the lake. Thanks

Gets a bit crowded up there so maybe get there early, good walleye spot too.Points with weed lines, bays with axcess to deeper water, there are some big northerns in that lake.Al"
