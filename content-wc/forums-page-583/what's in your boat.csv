1095501,Blue me!,2009-04-09 06:46:00,3,"For those of you with health issues or serious concerns with accidental injuries, look into med evac insurance. Saw this at the SCI convention this year, they will come get you and air lift you to the hospital of your choice in the States. Of course, if you are in a remote location may need a sat phone also. Rates are very reasonable, want to say around $250 for a week. Compare that to coming out of pocket for that kind of service, dead or alive would probably cost $10,000 plus maybe to get back???Wish we had it on our Legends trip, aka Trip of the Walking Dead. Took 3 old timers on their farewell tour, literally. These guys had been going forever and were all on my first trip 35 years ago. Actually got back with 2 of em still breathing, not bad odds for the shape they were in. Fortunately, the dead guy croaked early in the trip and we were able to put him in the fish freezer in the sleeping in the car seat position and finish up the week. Put his hat and sunglasses on him when we hit the border and sailed on thru. By the time we got back, he had thawed out and the county ME, who was one of the other old timers, signed off on the death certificate that he croaked when we were home. Sure do miss those guys."

1095668,Bigfishhunter,2009-04-09 15:46:00,803,"My best friend here in Manitoba is a Conservation Officer and I asked him about the bribe. He said that if some hoser ever tried to bribe him, he would haul him in so fast he wouldn't even know what hit him. He said there are no officers that would take a bribe, especially someone who has been drinking and is over the limit. I think if you try that again you may run into troubles at the border next time around, cause you may have a record."

1095985,labsrus,2009-04-10 15:35:00,557,"I also keep trailer bearings in the boat just in case I have a problem. I have one of thos water proof ammo boxes stuffed with tools, extra screws, hose clamps, duct tape, wire, boat and trailer registration papers. In my compartments up front I keep a spare prop, had one of mine stolen off the boat while staying in a hotel. When we go on our flyin trips in Canada I carry a day pack packed with survival gear, space blankets, fire starter, water, two way radios and some extra food."

1094905,fisher_i_am,2009-04-07 10:35:00,498,what do you keep in your boat during your canada trip outside of normal. My normal items are Tool box First Aid Kit Toliet Paper Camera Anchor/Rope Life Jackets Extra Clothes Rain Gear Two way radio for other boats in group Map/GPS Tunes Cooler(food and drink)
1094934,Gary from Iowa,2009-04-07 11:51:00,74,"I carry mini bolt cutters (cheap pair from Menards) Some of the treble hooks are hardened and difficult or impossible to cut with pliers and any tools the doctors might have available. The bolt cutters will help remove hooks from people, clothes and nets (sacrifice the hook) For single hooks check into directions on hook removal or an inexpensive hook removal kit-maybe practice pulling a hook out of a piece of meat so you have a good idea on how to do it if the time ever comes.Gary"

1095006,Obabikon,2009-04-07 15:42:00,2370,most important one you have to have in your boat... a plug!!! You'd be astonished by the number of sunken boats every year.
1095010,JayM5209,2009-04-07 15:54:00,1050,"Good suggestions in the posts above. I'd add -At least one STRONG bootlace for removal of hooks from human flesh. Google ""fish hook removal"" to learn how to remove a hook using a loop of strong line or a shoe/boot lace. I've had to do it, and the method does work!Also, powered vessels 19'8"" or less operating in Canada must have the following safety equipment on board:1 - approved type PDF per person aboard.1 - bouyant heaving line at least 50' long.1 - manual propelling device (I'd suggest having 2 on board as interpretation of this item varies.).1 - anchor and 50' or cable or rope.1 - Class 5BC fire extinguisher, if the vessel has an in-board engine OR a fixed fuel tank.1 - bailer.1 - watertight flashlight.1 - sound signaling device.Nav. lights if operating after sunset.Complete Canadian boating regs. can be found at http://www.tc.gc.ca/marinesafety/deb...pment/menu.htm.

1095033,Nimstug,2009-04-07 16:37:00,2605,"Foreign pleasure craft (pleasure craft that are licensed or registered in a country other than Canada) need to comply with equipment requirements of the country in which the vessel is usually kept. (From link below)I think the above applys if you are in Canada less than 60 consecutive days, but I could be wrong about that. If you are the typical U.S. -one or two week at a time in Canada angler-, you are only need to meet the requirements of your state. Not that a floating flashlight is a bad idea...... http://www.tc.gc.ca/marinesafety/debs/obs/quick/quick_visitor.htm#cNimstug"
1095049,JayM5209,2009-04-07 17:39:00,1050,"Nimstug, thanks for that clarification. I missed that! That must be why last summer, when checked by the MNR on Wabigoon, they only checked for a valid fishing license and did not ask to see my safety equipment. I was in my boat with WI registration but had made sure I had all the equipment since the camp owners had warned us that the DNR was being very rigorous that week in checking boats. All the items listed for Canada registered boats are good to have along anyway.JayM"
1095099,joeman79,2009-04-07 19:58:00,417,"I had to have a hook removed from the palm of my hand and we doubled up some 17# stren and Monte gave'er a quick HARD Jerk and it was nearly painless, just make sure your pushin the eye of the hook down hard at same time. I had to beg him to do it, he thought he was gonna hurt me bad. Popped it right out I told him don't just pull, jerk it quick and hard. 2nd time for me. size 2 treble"
1095194,Babamel2,2009-04-08 07:06:00,414,"as well as many items listed above, I have a tube that contains my boat registration and license. Also keep an extra set of wheel bearings for the trailer."
1095472,Guest,2009-04-09 03:31:00,0,"MNR will check for fish size, limits etc, while its the police in Canada that check for safety equipment. Just a heads up for the future."
