1095421,JDP,2009-04-08 20:24:00,1457,I thought I would demonstrate to my group that this was a convenient way to get the license out of the way.. haven't received my license yet but it has only been 9 days. JDP
1096727,JDP,2009-04-13 15:03:00,1457,"2 weeks, 10 business days. Now I can concentrate on other things when I'm at the bait stores! JDP"
1097194,deputy dog,2009-04-15 06:19:00,305,anyone know if quebec is planning on offering a fishing license either online or by phone? thanks
1092444,JDP,2009-03-30 15:22:00,1457,"Has anyone purchased their 2009 Non-Resident Ontario Fishing via telephone from the Ontario MNR? I did this A.M. the process only took 5 minutes (MNR Phone Number: 1-800-667-1940). I was told it would take 6-8 weeks to arrive at my home. Which is fine. However, if it would take considerably less time I might be to convince the other members of my group to follow suit. (The Outdoorsman Card/Temporary Paperwork will be sent as well). Thanks. JDP"
1092460,Larry S,2009-03-30 15:55:00,666,Order my license and it took only a week to get it via mail
1092538,bartfire,2009-03-30 19:06:00,9,"Thanks for the info... I still look forward to visiting the bait shop to get it, nothing like Canadian hospitality and conversation about the fishing, before a great week in the wilderness."
1093430,Walley Guide,2009-04-02 08:46:00,67,"Been stopping in Dryden, corner of Duke & Earl, for as many years as I can remember. Name has changed on the place from time to time, but the people always greet us with a smile. Great place to get the kinks out of my legs, plus if the wind is in the ""right"" direction you can catch a nice deep breath of that papermill air!!! Walley"
1093431,Mikep007,2009-04-02 08:53:00,77,"Got my license and Outdoors card via the phone, works great! Received within eight days."
1093453,JDP,2009-04-02 10:15:00,1457,"Thanks for the responses guys...I plan on stopping at the normal 2-3 bait & tackle shops on the way to Lac Seul but would rather shop for ""stuff"" and talk to the store personnel than stand in line for the license."
1094045,eyefanatic,2009-04-04 12:27:00,25,"So what is the deal with this outdoorsman card or registration? Will all non res people have to have one of these cards from now on? If so, how much is it in addition to a 7 day sportsman license? Thanks."
1094056,Glenman12,2009-04-04 14:04:00,762,Yes..you will need the outdoor card to purchase your license..it costs $9 and is good for 3 years..if you do it over the phone as stated in another post you can order both at the same time
1094086,eyefanatic,2009-04-04 17:06:00,25,Thanks G12. Great Thread.
1095400,worthsr,2009-04-08 19:00:00,52,I did this last year and received it in less than two weeks. I'll do it again this year and do my best to talk the rest of our group into it. It's hard to teach old dogs new tricks but that extra half hour of fishing that first day would be great.
