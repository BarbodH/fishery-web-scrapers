We took four teenagers to NWO Ontario three years ago for their first trip up along with all their electronics, they used everthing on the ride up and back but only unloaded a laptop so they could download pictures from a couple cameras. It was a fantastic trip Good Luck!"
1095269,Guest,2009-04-08 10:56:00,0,Let him take games. I have taken both my son and daughter on 4 Canadian fishing trips. They were without a doubt my most mimerable trips. My son was only 8 and his sister was 12 on the first trip and both played their game boys. Whenever I caught a fish I would hand them the rod and let them catch the fish. One morning my daughter ask if she could take a pillow on the boat so she could take a nap. I was not real pleased but told her it was her vacation and if that is what she wanted to do go for it. About 2 hours later both kids were sound asleep and slept for 2.5 hours. They both now take small pillows in trash bags with small blankets. When they get tired they take a nap and I fish. Okay on 1 occasion I slept and they fished for perch. I loved it.
1095278,@Lunker,2009-04-08 11:23:00,835,"One other thing that occurs to me, and perhaps you've already thought of this, is to hand off every single fish you hook and let him reel it in. At 8 yrs of age, he's most likely not going to have the feel of the bite down very well, and it's really all about ""catching"" them (reeling them in)."
1095470,Guest,2009-04-09 00:17:00,0,"I have taken two of my sons up north and have one more to go, They have never been together on the same trip though. I told myself the first year each of them wanted to go that they would by themselves. I let them take all that electronic stuff for the ride up. Then it stays in the truck. We play a lot of UNO and crazy 8s. I have also added a larger bait net to the arsonal and they both spent time on the dock catching crawdads and minnows. The camp owner has a minnow trap in the boat house that some how turns into it's own episode of the Deadliest Catch. Throw in some swimming suits and swim for an hour a couple of times durring the week. It's a great substitute for a shower. Last year, my middle son, nine years old, caught a 8# walleye backed up 15 minutes later by a 9#er. He caught and We caught enough fish. By the end of the week we went on a quest to see water falls. We ended up seeing 10 different sets before we left. Ask your camp owner you would be suprised at how many you can see in a week. Finally, I would like to say that I know my oldest son is very competitive. When he went every fish was in inches. When my second son went everything was in pound. Do what it takes to make it his trip. Don't compare it to other trips. For as fast as these guys are growing up a week in a boat is not long enough. Lazy eye"
1095578,Guest,2009-04-09 10:10:00,0,"One additional thought. I know the number of days we have in Canada is limited and we want to make the most of the time (and our money), but if the weather is cold and/or raining, take a break and stay in the cabin. Asking a 8-year old to sit in the boat when they are cold and its raining is a sure fire way to get them to hate fishing in the Great North. The resort we go has always been great about on such days letting our little ones stay in the main lodge and watch TV, letting one of the camp staff keep an eye on them (in my case, one of the camp girls). That was most helpful during those first couple of years when my little ones went to Canada. Now, a few years later, neither of my two minds sitting in the boat during less than perfect weather. One final note if you do what I indicated above, reward the person in camp watching your kids with a healthy thank you tip. Its not a part of their regular job to baby-sit, so reward them just like you would a regular baby sitter (probably better). If your camp could not make such an accomodation, stay in part of the day and play games. The weather will lift or perhaps you could make a short run out when the weather slackened. Also, if your going to make people fish in poor weather, make sure their rain gear is the best you can afford. It took me a numbe of years before I spent the money to buy really great rain gear, and what a difference it makes. Now, each person in my family has a top-of-the line rain suit because with it, we can fish in the worst weather and still enjoy ourselves. I see people all the time fishing in rain gear that is designed for a light mist. They are miserable and hate the trip, and worse, put themselves in a position to become chilled and ill. So, if kids are going to fish in the cold/rain, remember, they need the gear that makes it possible to do that and enjoy it. IA Walleye"
1095582,MartyT,2009-04-09 10:16:00,23,"I'm taking my daughter (9), son (12) and wife (29 and holding) for their first trip to Canada in late July. We're staying at Peffley's Camp on Wabaskang Lake, which is a ""boat-in"" camp 10 miles from the nearest road. I chose the location specifically because it's so remote - we had considered staying at another resort with a town nearby but I nixed the idea since the allure of mini-golf, ice cream, movie theaters, etc. isn't the reason we're going on vacation to Canada. We don't intend to take any electronic gizmos into camp, though I'm prepared to give in on the iPod and gameboy if they want it (or more likely, I'll sneak it into their bags before we get to camp and surprise them in a day or two when they're really jonesin' for it). We're taking lots of board games, cards, baseball mitts, etc. and hoping to make it a relaxing and fun week ""off the grid"", focused more on family time together than staring at a little LCD screen. In the car? DVD, Playstation, Gameboy, iPod, whatever they want is fine with me. Both kids fish with me quite regularly on 8 hour+ trips (plus 2 hours driving both ways) and pretty much know the drill: no electronics on the boat. Bring a book if you want; bring a pillow and sleep if you want. Just no games. They keep asking to go with me, so I guess I haven't ruined them quite yet... But on the Canada trip, I'm prepared (or at least, I keep telling myself I am) to fish as little or as much as they want, allowing plenty of time to go exploring, hiking, swimming, whatever as long as it's not sitting in the cabin whining about being bored with ""nothing to do...""Secretly, though, I hope the fish will be biting so fast they'll forget about all that other stuff..."
1095586,MartyT,2009-04-09 10:24:00,23,"Great suggestion! I've got a full set of Cabela's Pac-Lite ""Rainy River"" Gore-Tex pants and jacket plus Gore-Tex boots for everyone in the family. It ain't cheap, but boy, is it ever worth the money... On my first trip a couple of years ago with my dad, brother and brother-in-law, I was the only one with a decent rain suit. And, not coincidentally, I was the only one who wasn't miserable after a day of fishing in a driving rain... For a one-shot use, I think a set of Frog Toggs would probably work fine for the kids - quite a bit cheaper, but not nearly as durable as the ""good stuff""..."
1095607,skindzier,2009-04-09 11:32:00,137,"One other thing I'd add is to let the him have the run of the boat (within reason, of course) when he tires of fishing for awhile. My daughter (now 13), used to have great time using the ropes we used to tie up to the dock to ""wash"" the windshield. Probably wasn't helping the fishing with a 4 foor rope going in & out of the water repeatedly. Definitely didn't help the windshield clarity However, it entertained her through slow periods and she never got frustrated - the Canada trip is now one of her favorite things."
1095863,stabbert,2009-04-10 09:03:00,7,Great posts and information. My son is only 7 months old and I am dreaming of the day I can take him to Canada on his first trip. My greatest memories as a kid was our annual family fishing trips to Canada and I am hoping to create the same great memories.
1096696,DL fisherman,2009-04-13 13:44:00,2,"Having fun is what it is all about. Lots of great ideas so far.......here are mine. I am looking forward to taking my 4 and 6 year old boys out this summer. This will be the been taking them since they were 3. All kids have their own tolerances, my older one can fish for 2-3 hours and not get bored.Here are things I have found that worked well:1. Fish in the evenings, a little cooler & supper on the boat. 2. Bring food they like, sutff mom doesn't usually let them have. 3. Bring some little cars/tractors/toys. 4. Worms........need I say more.5. Let them play with the fish in the live well.Patience is key. Remember they are just learning. If you make it work, they won't be too interested in going back. Have Fun."

Great to add to facebook or msn for the kids.Try fishing from shore for an afternoon with a shore lunch and slip bobbers. Fish late evening off the dock, look for worms. Let him help clean the fish, or bag it. Phrase all the good stuff and have fun with the story ""what happens fishing stays at fishing"". If home sick make sure to call mom to update the days catch. Make sure your son has his own license to be part of the Fishing Guys. Talk about survival tricks. Make sure he has a lighter and fishing knife and teach him how to use a compass. Play card games like poker, chase the ace for 3 quaters and on the bus. Check out YouTube.com for fishing cleaning tricks, Trophy fish.

Although I'm excited to take my boy for his first of hopefully many trips, I am trying to temper myself as it will be a far different trip than my past 10 years where my main focus was catching fish. Just looking for some tips you guys may have to make the trip as enjoyable as possible for my boy so that he looks foward to the next trip as much as I do. We always come in for lunch for about 3 hours mid day which will help. We also always have plenty of food and drink on the boat. Boat rides and exploring will be a must."
1094906,fisher_i_am,2009-04-07 10:40:00,498,"Sorry, accidently hit post prior to finishing.... main question is to let him bring his gameboy? One side of me says no way, the boat is no place for this and there is plenty to keep him entertained. the other side says, whats the harm if he want to play it for a while and it keeps us on the lake. So long as it's not always on and he spends most of the time fishing or dorking around in the boat. What;s your expierence?"
1094909,Hot Runr Guy,2009-04-07 10:45:00,16062,"There is no greater joy than a father taking his son on a fishing trip. Sounds like a Mac & Cheese, and PB&J week. Make the trip about hime, find a bluegill hole, let him bring the GameBoy. Even at 12 & 16, the still have a short attention span. HRG"
1094932,Gary from Iowa,2009-04-07 11:43:00,74,Bring a softball and softball gloves in case you get a lockjaw day. Also a trip for an ice cream cone or pizza is a good break from fishing too. Take your boy to the tackle shop to help you pick out what he and you need on the trip.Have fun!!!Gary
1094995,REG,2009-04-07 15:17:00,445,"I took my youngest when she was 7 (she turned 8 while up there). It was a little easier for me since her brother and sister had been going for a number of years and were there to help. I would say to take a portable dvd for the car ride as well as bad weather days - let them pick the movies to take - don't forget the earbuds or headphones. Take the Nintendo DS as well - you can't expect them to fish the whole time. Plus some favorite books, toys, etc. On the trip up and back - plan for more stops - let them get the bad snacks that mom doesn't like them to have (sorry mom - it's only a week) We always do the special grocery shopping trip and they get to pick out their drinks and snacks for the week - almost anything goes. Plan meals with their favorites included. Hot dogs, sketti, mac and cheese, etc. Take some of those easy-bake cookies that you just have to throw in the oven - a can of icing and you're set. Microwave popcorn is good too. Be sure to have them pack some of their favorite clothes, games, blankets, things, etc. Plan on a little less time in the boat with a few more breaks. Take the time to explore, etc. Garter snakes can make wonderful temporary pets. (but not for everyone) Use the camp paddleboat that you've never used before. Let them steer the boat a few times. Let them pick the fishing spot one day. Don't forget the coffee can for those far off spots on the lake. Sunscreen and a hat are a must. No crispy critters. Buy them a few disposable cameras that they get to take the pictures. And take one of your own to take their happy, smiling faces while holding up their fish. Explain the slot concept way in advance - let them know that you may not be keeping every fish they catch. Not something you want to be doing for the first time while they're holding that 32"" Northern that's the biggest fish they ever caught. You get the idea - hopefully you'll be busy taking fish off the hook and re-baiting! (Go to your quantity spots - especially if you have a good Northern or small Walleye spot) And we always make a point to stop and buy a t-shirt or some other small token on the way back. They'll have a great time and so will you - probably for many years to come. My little one is already counting down the days till June. Just like me."

1095195,Blue me!,2009-04-08 07:08:00,3,"Little different situation for us. Taking my 17 yo stepson on his first trip. My 17 yo stepson who averages over 6000 text msgs a month. Told him when I invited him that there was no cell phone coverage and he still wanted to go. No video games for him either. Going to be fun to see him interact with our group. A doctor, judge, banker, oil exec and govt exec. all of whom have been on multiple trips."
1095206,Guest,2009-04-08 07:36:00,0,"I have two kids that both accompanied me to Canada when they were in the 8 year old range. All the advice above is great. Yes, let them bring any and all the games they like (even the electronic ones that old farts like us don't think belong in Canada). Not only have them for the ride up and the cabin, but make sure you take stuff in the boat. No 8 year old, no passionate you think they are for fishing, can sit in a boat for 8 hours a day and fish hard. They are not just wired the same as us older folks. The key to remember is let them do what they want. When my son went to Canada when he was 8, he would fish a while and even in the middle of a good walleye bite, he would put the rod down and decide it was time to play with his army men, to paint a picture (water colors), or to dissect a leach or a perch. The first time he did so during a great bite, I was struggling to get him to keep fishing, before I just gave up and decided that he would decide what and when was right for him. By letting him set the agenda to his day, it was no longer a struggle for me (or him) and his enjoyment level went way up. If the child likes science, let them dissect a perch, if your keeping a walleye or two for shore lunch, let them take the eye out of a walleye and discover the ""rock of the eye"" as my son called it, let them man the net even if it means missing a fish or two. Hey your going to CPR the big ones anyway! Point is, a trip with a 8-year old is not about the adult, its not about the # or size of fish caught, its about the child. Let them dicate the day and you will gain a fishing buddy for life. On the other hand, if you make them sit in a boat and do nothing but fish, get angry when they lose a monster walleye at the boat, etc. you will have lost the best friend you might have had when they are older. If you remember this trip has nothing to do with you and everything to do with them, then you will do great. If in your heart you want this to be a serious fishing trip, intent on #'s or size, then do yourself a favor and not take a child. I don't think the latter is wise, because if you do this first trip right, you have a fishing buddy for life and you may end up that much closer to your child. Enjoy....IA Walleye"

Keep the pointers coming!! some I'm aware of but there are some good new ones, all which will help make this the first of many trips. Thanks agian"
