558117,Fishoil,2006-06-06 13:54:00,1277,I'm looking for a source for minnows on the way to Pickle Lake for the opener for next year. Has anyone purchased from the place in Silver Dollar? Is the price there decent and do you get a decent number of minnows? Do they sell them wholesale by the gallon or pound? Anyone know of anywhere else I can buy a large quantity of minnows on the way up there?

If you are really getting alot of minnows stop at Vern's Minnows in Ignace, It is only 1/2 mile west of 599 on the main drag 11/17 heading into town on the south side of the road. They will bag the minnows and shoot them up with Oxygen for you. As long as you keep them cool these minnnow will stay good for several days in the bag no problem. This is where I usually get my bait, Silver dollar in a pinch if you run short. Any other questions let me know good luck GF"
