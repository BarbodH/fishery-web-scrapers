We catch our biggest fish anytime during the day, doesnt seem to be a recognizable pattern. I was just wondering if any of you have had good luck catching bigger fish at night time? I want a chance at a real big walleye and thought the night time might be a good shot to get a pig. What time of day have you all caught your biggest fish? I would have to say that mid-morning time frame has brought my biggest."

558065,Guest,2006-06-05 08:54:00,0,i don't think i'd try it. hard enough to dodge hazards during daylight. night time at lac seul is for drinking beer and playing cards.
558093,Jigger1,2006-06-05 23:29:00,234,"I've caught two 29's on Lac Seul. First 29"" 4:30pm Second 29.25"" 11:00am A bunch of 27's & 28's just before lunch. Still personally hunting for a 30. The two 30's I've seen caught: First 30.5"" 2:00pm Second 31"" 5:30pm - last day of the trip. LacSeul has dark enough water that the eye's can eat plenty during the day. I'm sure there's a night bite, but I agree, nights are for cards and a favorite beverage."

558104,Guest,2006-06-06 08:22:00,0,Have tried it several times and the fishing was tough while the bugs were tougher. We figure we can catch enough Walleye on Lac Seul while the sun shines.
558149,Guest,2006-06-07 11:18:00,0,A few of the boys tried that a couple years back. We found them in the morning mummified laying in the bottom of the boat. The bugs had sucked all the blood out of their bodies. Not a pretty site. We called the OPP who took away the bodies and they said this happens every couple of years. The bodies weighed no more than twenty pounds each
558167,Guest,2006-06-07 19:34:00,0,"Two years ago my son and I had the fishing experience of a lifetime on Lac Seul at night. It was our last night in camp and it was a beautiful evening with a bright moon, so we stayed out until nearly midnight. We slayed the walleye constantly until we ran out of bait. I had some onld rubber worms in my box and I caught walleye on them, too. The bugs were no problem, but then again we were there the end of May. I will definitely do it again and now with GPS I am not worried about finding my way back even without the moon."
558195,Guest,2006-06-08 14:00:00,0,Make sure you wear a PFD. It makes it easier for the OPP to find your body in the morning after you run into something. (moose in the water) Does your GPS show logs and animals in the water?
558201,Guest,2006-06-08 15:28:00,0,"Tried it once, hooked my parter in the ear. The blood scent made the bugs go nuts. Then barely missed an Island while watching my GPS. Had to moter with my sunglasses on to keep the bugs out of my eyes, and ate at least a pound. Only good thing was it took almost a pint of Wieser's to get them down. Now I race the sun to the dock."
