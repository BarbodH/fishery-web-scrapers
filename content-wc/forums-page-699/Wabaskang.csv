557651,Trailerguy,2006-05-24 20:25:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]You will be closer to the fishing at Sleepy Dog, and I think you'll find Tommy to be a good host, he's also very knowledgable. I've been told the water is lower this spring than last, but haven't made it up there yet this month. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
557706,Guest,2006-05-25 20:30:00,0,Be sure you thoroughly check your boats before you leave from Sleepy Dog because I have already seen two of their boats towed in this year and it is only the first week!
557724,Guest,2006-05-26 08:35:00,0,"Suzy, what do you mean by ""check your boats"" are motors the issue you think? How is the water level on Waba? Any bigguns being caught?"
557753,Guest,2006-05-26 21:13:00,0,What is the water level on wabaskang? What is the fishing like the first week? Going to Wine in 2 weeks and thinking about coming up to wabaskang to fish Gawley's bay and the big lake by the wine lake portage. Any help in these areas for smallmouth and walleye would be appreciated. Scott
557915,Guest,2006-05-31 18:59:00,0,How was the first week of fishing on Wabaskang?
557922,Trailerguy,2006-05-31 20:46:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I went up over the long weekend. We caught a few for supper the 1st nite over by the 1st narrows. The next two afternoons it stormed, big lighting strikes and rained straight down, so I didn't go out. My neighbor had been fishing all week previous and was doing well. One of the locals who guides had taken two guys out on the opener and they caught 60 eye's in 2 hours. I was told the fish have been shallow 6'-8', and jigs and minnows have been productive. After the storms, the lake was rising, probably 5-6"" between Saturday and Monday, by the shoreline at my dock. All the little creeks leading to the lake are running full, so it will come up more this week. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"

My guess is the operator ran their boats out of gas. Stayed there last week, new 25 H.P. electric start Yamahas on all boats. Started on command"
