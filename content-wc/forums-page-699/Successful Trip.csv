558001,Guest,2006-06-02 12:11:00,0,"We had a great 5 days of fishing out of Mahkwa Lodge May 26 to May 31 especially considering we withstood 2 very severe thunderstorms and a day of very heavy wind. We focused on pike this year, so in the 5 days my two sons and I caught 250 pike. We had one day where we caught 15 over 30 inches. On the first day of the trip and the first trip for my youngest son to Canada he caught a 41.5 inch pike. The water temperature was 60-65 in the shallow bays, but the pike were still there. The main lake was in the high 50s to low 60s. We caught 150 walleye, which is down for a normal year for us, but it was because of our narrower focus to pike. When we did fish for walleye we did very well. Evening storms and wind kept us away from a couple of our walleye honey holes. What I found really amazing is that we picked up 30 bass almost all of which were large. I caught the largest one at 19 inches, but we have several in the 16-18 inch range. Sorry guys, I gave the Rapalas a good test on the pike and walleye, but by far our best luck continues on spoons for pike and nightcrawlers on jigs or lindy rigs for walleye. The food at Mahkwa Lodge was great again as was the rest of the accomodations, except our cabin had no hot water the entire stay (only our cabin). Water levels were about a foot lower than last year at the same time, but still high compared to average. I am already looking ahead to next year. Steve"

We'll be headed to Dogtooth Lake for some walleye fishing. Hope we have as much success as you and your sons. Will post report when we get back. Nice report and again cograts to you all. Good Fishing! Joe"

They made a couple of adjustments including the temp. setting. Did you check the set-up or mention the issue to Mahkwa personnel? Last year we had a water heater completely fail, Mahkwa personnel fixed the unit in less than 3 hours. JDP:-)"
558090,Guest,2006-06-05 19:10:00,0,"I told Roger the first night. He told me he had parts on back order. He robbed parts from another one and got it working for one night. Then it was completely cold water the rest of the time. I told him again the 3rd afternoon and he said he would look at it again, but it did not improve. The most disappointing thing was that on check out I told Pierre and he simply said ""those things happen when the camp first opens."" No apology. On the flip side I had to make a run to Hudson with my truck and I forgot to put the pin in my trailer tongue (I disconnected the trailer thank goodness), so on my way to Hudson I lost my trailer tongue bar. I asked Roger to order me one which he said he would. The next day Roger gave me a used one at no charge (tongue and 2 balls). So, overall I have no complaints about the service at Mahkwa. The food was great except Tuesday evening they served Shepherds Pie instead of the scheduled pork chops. It was a poor excuse for Shepherd's Pie and a long ways from pork chops. Now I sound like I am complaining, yet I am very satisfied with Mahkwa. Steve"
558102,Guest,2006-06-06 07:53:00,0,"NE, it's not about complaining, it's about getting the service you were promised and you paid for. It's great that they went above and beyond with the trailer tounge thing, but to go with no hot water for a week - that's how you lose business....and Shepards pie! Woo hoo, that's actually not too bad though..."
