557906,Guest,2006-05-31 15:26:00,0,Been to Scout twice and they treated us fine and we had good fishing. Maybe somebody got a burr cross ways and thinks their problem was Scouts problem. Enjoy your trip and tell us about your personal experience with Scout. Have Fun

It is in an excellent location and far enough away from civilization that you don't have to share the lake with hardly anybody but the people in camp. The dock at the camp has perhaps the best fishing of any where else on the lake. We use to go to Kesagami Lake which has first class accomodations and meals, excellent guide service, daily maid service, very remote setting (fly-in) and terrific fishing (best pike lake I know of). Given the choice between the two places I would choose to fish out of Chamberlain. To me it is more rewarding to locate your own fish and prepare the meals as a group, thats what a fishing trip is all about."

558157,Guest,2006-06-07 15:32:00,0,"I second Lost Island Lodge, they are top notch and eager to please. The owners have been in tourism their entire lives, great experience."
558166,Guest,2006-06-07 19:29:00,0,"I made the trip to Chamberlain Narrows twice and I agree totally about the walleye fishing off the dock and in the narrows -- it cannot be better anywhere. However, I was not impressed with the owners/management. The 35 mile boat ride does take you to isolation, but if the weather is bad it is a bear of a trip. Anyway I am now very happy at Mahkwa and catching plenty of fish."
558174,J George,2006-06-08 00:07:00,1,"Silver Water Wheel Lodge - Hands down! They do their homework and put you on fish - lots of them and big. Mike, the owner/operator knows walleyes and all the current techniques on how to catch them. He applies this knowledge to Lac Suel with great boats, state-of the-art electronics and top-notch guides. Check out his web sight and look under ""fishing reports"" and you will see what I mean. I have been fishing with Mike for over 10 years now and I can say with out a doubt, that if you want to have the best Canadian walleye experience, go to the Silver Water Wheel! See ya there, JG"

550884,Guest,2005-07-31 09:41:00,0,"I would check out Lost Island Lodge out of Hudson. They are top notch and have great boats, equipment, cabins, and staff. They will make sure to take care of your needs. If you want June though you better try and get in right away, because it is mostly all repeat and can be hard to get in. www.lostislandlodge.com You might find some cheaper, but hard to find a better operation."
550899,Guest,2005-08-01 06:21:00,0,"That is an intersting question, because it depends on what you are looking for. If you want a nice Housekeeping resort, then Evergreen, Fisherman's Cove, Whitewing, Lac Seul Lodge, Goose Bay fit the bill. If you want American and fully guided boats, the top notch Silver Water Wheel is the place. If you want isolation, then Lac Seul/Ojibwa Outpost is supposed to be great (have not been there but guys on this post love it)."
550906,Guest,2005-08-01 09:01:00,0,Jeez guys no one told him to go to Scout Lake Resort..heeeheeee
550953,Guest,2005-08-02 08:10:00,0,Cuz Scout sucks!!!!!!!
550956,Guest,2005-08-02 09:12:00,0,The lake sucks or the resort sucks?
550960,Guest,2005-08-02 10:15:00,0,"Silver Water Wheel Lodge is the cream on Lac Seul. Great accomodations, boats and food, the best guides and fantastic fishing. I used to go there years ago and the fishing just seems to get better and better. I went once with that new owner and had a great time, my guide was Jay i think, he was really helpful and put us on some big fish. R. Winegartner"
550961,Guest,2005-08-02 10:31:00,0,Incredible lake! Resort and resort owner suck.
