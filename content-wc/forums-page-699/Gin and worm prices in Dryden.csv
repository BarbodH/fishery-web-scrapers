They are located on the east side of the river just south of the Weyerhaeuser wood mill. Have not made it up yet this spring (hope to in a week or so) so can't help you out on worm prices.

(? hyw 11 or 17 to Vermillon bay) at the stop and go light turn right, it the second gas station on the right hand side of road. There are two gas station next to each other. I want to say it the Esso station. You will see the bait,tackle store."
