Otherwise, there is another store attached to the mall a couple of blocks away that is right next to the beer store and LCBO if you need to make those stops as well."

558152,Guest,2006-06-07 12:42:00,0,The other store by the liquor store is called Extra Foods. Nice one stop shop as the liquor store (LCBO) and The Beer Store is located right next door. There is also Walmart on the east end of town (hwy 17e just past the McDonalds) (our walmarts up here carry some groceries as well)
