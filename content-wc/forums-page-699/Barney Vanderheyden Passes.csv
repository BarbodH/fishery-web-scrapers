Barney was a guest,but I too had become a friend. Barney came and sat and chatted for a day with me at the All Canada Sport Show 2 seasons ago and I did miss his company this year. He was a very kind and honest man who loved fishing the Canadain waters.He was always laughing or cracking a joke to get a rise from someone. My heart does go out to everyone who knew him. May god be with him and may he rest in Peace. Kevin Kasten Little Canada Camp"

If you never met him just think what it would be like to lose one of your closest fishing buddys or one of your best friends in life. Rest In Peace My Friend, Mike Kansas"

556718,Guest,2006-04-29 23:25:00,0,Fishing for many of us is our most valued time on Earth outside of our Family and God. It brings us together with those who we are lucky enough to meet because we fish. Together in a boat men become more than friends they are bonded by the beauty of the wilderness and the reality of nature in its finest attire. It reminds us all of how small a spec of sand we are in the greater scheme of life. Man has always been lured by what gift of nature is around the next island and what waits for our presntation at the bottom of the lake. We have all lost a fishing buddy and we will suffer again when another of our finest passes. May it be in each of our hearts to thank God that we were blessed by their presence and had the opportunity to share time with them in the most beautiful and fulfilling thing that we know...natures glory. REST IN PEACE
556931,Guest,2006-05-06 10:16:00,0,MAY HE REST IN PEACE Been out of the country for a while and missed this post. Read a lot of posts about Barney in the past. Always enjoyed reading about him. My heart goes out to those who knew him and his family.
557110,Pauly,2006-05-10 17:05:00,10,"Mike - I haven't been on WC for a long time. I really wish I would have posted here sooner. I met Barney the same trip you met him up on the Red River. I counted him as a close friend immediately. I had the pleasure of being on several Canadian walleye trips with Barney. Fishing has always been high on my list in life, but fishermen are even higher on the list, particularly fishermen like Barney. We shared a lot of stories about fishing and a lot of stories about living. We laughed together, and I surely felt his pain in his last few weeks. Barney was upbeat until the end. I spoke with him by phone the Sunday before he died and told him I would be booking our Fall trip in 06 with Kevin. ""Count me in"" said Barney, but I knew better. Right now I have a lump in my throat and a tear in my eye. Any of you who knew Barney would know why."
557146,Mike Kansas,2006-05-12 08:42:00,1463,"Pauly, Good to see that you got to enter your comments about Barney. He meant a lot to all of us who knew him. I always told him he was my Hero because of what he accomplished in his life overcoming his demons. He truly loved to Walleye fish and being in a boat with him was always an adventure. I gave him a lot of grief about his height and he was always able to jack me up about my ancestory or in his judgement my lack of fishing ability. I will miss him and everytime I climb in a boat he will be with me. Are you still going to Kevins in the fall? Drop me an email so we can make some arrangments if you guys are still going.[email protected] Mike Kansas May He Rest In Peace"
557249,Guest,2006-05-15 09:25:00,0,"Haven't checked on this site since I left my last note. Debbie, Hope your husband made it back safe...thank him for all of us for his service to our great country. As I read through all of these I couldn't help but wonder how many of us have friends we care about as much as Barney's friends cared for him. But we never take a moment to tell them how much we appreciate the friendship we have. Then one day it's too late. I hope I will do a better job of passing kind words like those in this posting, to people who are still on earth to hear them. There are no guarantees we will have those popportunities again."

558073,Mike Kansas,2006-06-05 10:26:00,1463,Would have been leaving for Lac Seul with Barney this friday. Will miss his sense of humor and his company. He represented a little of each of us who spend our winters thinking of catching Walleye in Canada. His heart was gentle and he was a true friend. Thanks to all who acknowledged his passing with a post. Release a Walleye for Barney this summer. MAY HE REST IN PEACE
558074,Guest,2006-06-05 11:11:00,0,I always thought it was a big 'Barney Joke' myself. Rest in peace. Anyone have an obit. on the web?
556303,Guest,2006-04-18 10:51:00,0,May He Rest In Peace This reminds me of a close friend I lost four years ago. He is with me every time I think about fishing or go fishing.
556335,Guest,2006-04-18 22:27:00,0,I always enjoyed the posts about Barney. It is always sad when a friend is lost especially at a age that seems premature. From the posts here it sounds as if Barney was the kind of man that any fisherman worth his salt would have enjoyed spending a day drowning minnows. May he rest in peace
556338,Mike Kansas,2006-04-19 11:03:00,1463,"Thank you all for your posts in response to Barney's passing. He was a great friend and a part of him will always be with me, especially when I'm fishing. I believe we all have a Barney amongst our present or past fishing pals There was an idea mentioned in one of the posts that I really liked. It was that each of us should release a Walleye this summer for Barney. I would like to take that one step further....release a Walleye for Barney and all of our fishing pals who have gone before us. I'm sure we all have somebody we can pay tribute to in this manner. Thanks Again, Mike Kansas MAY HE REST IN PEACE"
556357,Guest,2006-04-20 10:43:00,0,"I wasn't a ""fishing buddy"" of Barney's but my husband knew him for over 30 years and he became a great friend to me over the past 3. He talked about his friends and the Canada trips a lot and had some great stories to tell about all of you he shared that joy with. He will be missed by a lot of people. It's good to see all the positive responses and we have all lost a sincere friend."
556360,Mike Kansas,2006-04-20 11:41:00,1463,"Debbie, Thank you for your kind message. I know Barney had a positive impact on all those he touched near his home. Mike Kansas"
556365,Guest,2006-04-20 16:43:00,0,I always thought the barney threads were jokes. I read them and laughed a lot. Now I see there was a fine person behind all the posts. Sorry for your loss. My prayers are with you. Eric MacDonald MD
556384,Guest,2006-04-21 13:13:00,0,"I talked with Barney the week before he passed away. Mike and I had planned a trip to visit him the week following easter. His passing was 4 days before our planned trip. Barney joined us at Lac Suel for a week in the summer of ""04. I picked on him constantly but was only able to get a occassional shake of the head from him. A smirk was the most I could irritate from him. He was a fun gentleman to have in the boat. Always easy with a chuckle, and willing to remind the rest of us how full of garbage we were. He will be missed, and I regret not rushing up to his home when I heard about the cancer. He did not once tell us how short of time he had. It wouldn't have been Barney's way to complain or feel sorry for himself. Just not a possible option. I would hope as my days left diminish I can handle that type of adversity with such class and dignity. Barney stood tall until the very end. God Bless you Barney, I regret not getting up to see you. May that be the lesson from this for all your friends. Don't delay spending time with our friends we care about. There are no guarantees that chance will always be there. I pray there are walleye lakes in heaven. I truly do. J.R. ""Euker"""
556390,Guest,2006-04-21 16:24:00,0,"Euker, Just wondering what Barney would have said about Walleye Lakes in Heaven. My Guess: JR, you better hope there are some there because its the only chance you may ever have to catch a decent Walleye. Always loved Barney's sense of humor. Mike Kansas"
556397,Guest,2006-04-22 08:50:00,0,"i have been a close friend to barney for over 16 yrs, im here in his hometown for his services today. and i was told to come to this site to read all the fine things being said about our friend. im not a fisherman, but i know what it meant to barney, other than his family, he loved canada, and walleye fishing as much as anything i knew. as i set here on barneys stool in his shop reading all the post from what seems to be a very close group of friends made up only by the connection of fishing, it's what barney was all about. friends, laughing, joking around. he was all about life, and will be missed by many. i know that last saturday, a part of me died, because anyone who ever met this man, would know exactly what i mean, he was a fine person, but even more, a great friend, i will miss him dearly. and fisherman or not, for barneys sake, i too, hope there is a fishing hole in heaven. p. s. i had to use barneys username to post, my name is rick"
556421,Guest,2006-04-24 09:27:00,0,"J.R., I understand how you feel but Barney called me just a week before he passed, I didn't think the news sounded good but, being Barney, he was very positive. I moved from IL to MO (by Truman Lake) in mid March and even then he was talking about coming down this summer to fish and get some rest. He was going to have his other Missouri fishermen friends join him here. My husband is overseas, will be home in 2 weeks so we were going to see Barney then. Mark is just thankful he was here in January and spent some time ""bantering"" each other like they have done for 30+ years. So, you're right - never put off seeing an old friend or letting someone know how much they mean to you - you may not get the chance later. Debbie"
556255,Mike Kansas,2006-04-17 09:04:00,1463,"Barney Vanderheyden passed away on April 15, 2006 at the age of 54. I first met Barney on Walleye Central when I was trying to fill an extra spot I had on a fishing trip to Canada. I posted a request for someone interested in joining our group and Barney answered. He joined us and I have been on seven trips with him since that time to Lac Seul, English River and the Red River in Manitoba. Like all of us who visit Walleye Central Barney loved Canada and its beauty and the pleasure of spending time with others who love to fish for Walleye. I was with him when he caught his first 10 lb Walleye and had the pleasure of netting a 12.5 lb Walleye for him on the Red River in 2002. Barney became a great friend to me and we bantered back and forth on Walleye Central many times about which of us caught the most or the biggest Walleye. It really didnt matter who caught them it only mattered that we shared many great times on the water and became friends because of our love for Walleye fishing. I will miss him every time I'm in a boat because he represented true friendship and added hours of pleasure to our time in Canada on the water together. Barney fought Lung Cancer for the last few months of his life and even though it spread through his body like a fire he continued to talk to me about going fishing this summer and whipping me like a dog. We both knew that there would be no more time for us in the boat together,at least not on Earth. Im asking that each of you who read this close your eyes for a brief moment and pray that Barney ""Rest In Peace"".....I believe that there is a little of Barney in each of us and a lot of Barney in those we share time on the water with. REST IN PEACE MY FRIEND, Mike Kansas"
556265,Guest,2006-04-17 11:15:00,0,Rest in peace... I always enjoyed reading his posts :-(
556266,Guest,2006-04-17 11:28:00,0,Very sorry to hear this.
556269,Guest,2006-04-17 12:54:00,0,"Sorry to hear of Barney's passing. I read many posts about him and enjoyed them all. In fact Im going to do a search and read some of them again. Mike, the kind of relationship that you expressed about Barney is the same way I feel about the guys I fish with and you are right, may he REST IN PEACE."
556274,Guest,2006-04-17 13:39:00,0,Sad to hear. I remember many posts from Barney or others referring to him. Always sounded like someone who truly loved fishing! NWO Fishing Bum
556277,Guest,2006-04-17 15:15:00,0,"I remember Barney and how every spring his fishing skills were discussed on WC. He obviously wasn't the BIG PURPLE GUY that a lot of people thought he was but instead it sounds like he was an Awesome Friend and a Fine Fisherman who enjoyed Walleye Fishing. May we all release a Walleye in his memory this summer. Rest In Peace, Amen"
556283,Guest,2006-04-17 21:01:00,0,May he Rest In Peace and spend his eternity catching Walleyes with all those who have gone before him that loved Walleye fishing.
556286,manitobawalleye,2006-04-17 22:21:00,885,"i also enjoyed the barnie posts i will think of him this fall on the red my condolences to his friends and family manitoba .... a 100,000 lakes how many walleyes ???? i will never have enough time...."
556288,Guest,2006-04-17 22:34:00,0,Its a tribute to fishing when you consider all the friendships that are made on the water. Fishing with a buddy gives you both time to share your secrets and your laughter and build relationships that will last a lifetime. Fisherman are all bonded together by the beauty of the landscape and the shimmer of the water and the freshness of the air. The challenge of the catch is a bonus that stands pale in the test of time when compared to the comradity of shareing a day on the water with a friend. May He Rest In Peace
556295,Guest,2006-04-18 09:02:00,0,Barney represented each of us who wet a line in Walleye water. May the passing of a fellow Walleye fisherman remind us all that our time on the water is a gift and we should enjoy every day we spend out there like it was our last one. May He Rest In Peace
