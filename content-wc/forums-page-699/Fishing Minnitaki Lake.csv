557760,Evanvigor,2006-05-27 02:01:00,3,Will be fishing Minnitaki Lake next weekend with my parents. Will be staying at the Moonlight Falls Camp south of Sioux Lookout. My question is simply this...Where to fish for walleye and small mouth without traveling to far from camp? (rental boat w/ 25hp)
557774,Guest,2006-05-27 13:15:00,0,"Turn right (south) from camp, go to the farthest bay. Either use a jig and a minnow or (my favorite) a #18 perch colored Rapala. Fish in about 12-18 ft. of water. i always stand up and jerk the Rapala. I've caught 4-5 lbs. Walleye there. If you go north, you'll find a creek on your left just before the narrows. Go all the way to the rapids and fish the eddy. Good-eatin' size Walleyes and some Smallies. If you have a depth finder, just as you go through the narrows (going north) you'll find a noticible hole, stop and jig for Walleyes. There's a million other places on Minnitaki but, these are a few that's close to Moonlight. Good Luck,Bo"

My question is simply this...Where to fish for >walleye and small mouth without traveling to far from camp? >(rental boat w/ 25hp) > I guess Moonlight Falls Camp is on Pickeral Arm. Have never been in there. What I can say is that we have never done much in Lyons Bay. In four weeks we have not found a single decent spot in Lyons bay. Others tell me to look for the humps out in the main basin of the lake. We have done well in Redpine Bay. Check the regs for Redpine, it may be a sanctuary this time of year. As you leave Pickeral Arm, there is a large island in front of you called Burnthut Island. We have done OK around the small islands to the east of Burnthut, mainly on the side toward the main basin. We have fished these spots in July and August, maybe June is different. Good luck. let us know how you do."
557975,Evanvigor,2006-06-01 20:23:00,3,"Thank you for your input. The weather was 95 and calm, poor walleye fishing. We ended up catching out limit of Pike in one day about 1/2 mile south of camp where 2 creeks flow into the Pickeral Arm across from each other. (4 pounders all day) We used a slow retreval with good old fashioned red-eyes, which worked really well in the bright sunlight. We actually found the Walleyes about 100 yards north of camp in 6 feet of water. Caught 16-29 inchers with a perch spinner and medium minnow. Had a blast for the money...alot cheaper than most anyother place around I think. I will be going back this fall. Good fishin' everyone, Mr. Crouch"
