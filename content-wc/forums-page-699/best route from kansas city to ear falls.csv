557951,ksboy2,2006-06-01 13:21:00,38,"hey fellers, i am headed up to ear falls to catch a flight out w/showalters to apps lake on the 8th of july. we usually head up I35 to cloquet then to 53 and on up. we are looking at taking I29 through the dakotas all the way to winnipeg, then across and up? is it alot farther? i searched to two routes on the internet and the winni route is about 90 miles farther according to the internet. the roads look much better so i am thinking it is about the same. any advice? kirk miller mapleton,ks"
557954,Mike Kansas,2006-06-01 13:44:00,1463,"ksboy2, We have gone both ways and have settled on the Minnesota 53 route. Mostly because we meet guys on the way up. You will find that the Winnipeg route is a little longer, less traffic, no stop lights, better road and a refreshing change of scenery. We would probably go that way this year but we have to pick up some fishing buds. No matter which way you go...Drive Safe....Catch a bunch of fish...get back home safely. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
557956,Guest,2006-06-01 14:10:00,0,We have been using the I-29 route for the past 6-7 years. The traffic is generally light and the roads are good. You can cover a lot of ground in a hurry in the Dakotas at 75 - 80 mph. We have found that you can save some time by cutting across at Morris MB and going through Steinbach instead of going through Winnipeg. We are heading that way in 16 days for two weeks. Can't wait to get back on Lac Seul.
558004,Guest,2006-06-02 15:33:00,0,How much time do you save by going throught Steinback?
558005,Guest,2006-06-02 15:43:00,0,"I would guess 30-45 minutes. If you go to Winnipeg you have to go north and then come back south. You miss that when you go through Steinbach, plus, the Winnipeg bypass has a lot of stop lights and it seems like I hit them all. Also, Steinbach is about 800 miles from home and a good place to stop for the night."
558010,ksboy2,2006-06-02 21:25:00,38,can you tell me about how long it takes from the border to ear falls via the 29 route? we are stopping in fargo for the night any idea of hours from there? thanks for the info. kirk
558012,2 DOGS,2006-06-02 22:05:00,361,You're going to ruin 6 hours from border to Ear Falls.
558146,ksboy2,2006-06-07 09:43:00,38,"kansaseye, when i looked at my atlas i guessed you are taking the morris exit off of 75. (23 hwy) and then heading north on 59. then back east on 52 to steinbeck, then straight north to the four land road, is this correct? thanks for the info, kirk miller mapleton ,ks"
558150,Guest,2006-06-07 12:02:00,0,You are correct. Last year we got to Steinbach early enough to tour the Lund factory. Nice town.
