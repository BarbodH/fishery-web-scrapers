558132,Guest,2006-06-07 00:33:00,0,"Lake St. Joseph is a great lake. I'm heading up there June 16th for the sixth year. Great fishing, scenery, solitude, and good times with friends. The lake is huge, 90 miles or so long with 150,000 acres of water, and basically only two fishing camps. I've heard of a fly-in camp somewhere on the lake but have never seen it. The lake has a boat landing, so you can bring your own boat. The Lake St. Joseph Accord, created between the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and camp operators on the lake in 1989, controls the number of people fishing to about 1,700 per year via a tag system. The accord also requires single barbless hooks and size limits of 18 or less for walleyes and 27.5 for northern. So you've got huge, practically private lake with extremely light fishing pressure. The result is great fishing. We stay at Camp Lake St. Joseph, owned by Merle Cameron and Doug and Shelley Earl. They are wonderful people who have always been very welcoming and helpful. (They operate Oz Lake Lodge also, but that is on Lake Osnaburgh, a much smaller lake which is across the road, not St. Joseph. It's part of the same river system but you can't navigate between them.) Camp Lake St. Joseph and the Old Post are less than five minutes apart by boat. We go past it every morning on the way out and every afternoon coming back. So the fishing is identical. You mentioned that Old Post is twice the price. Compare their websites, www.lakestjoseph.com and www.oldpost.com . The Old Post has a fancy site with good articles, links, pictures of their dining room, chef, lawn and flowers. The Camp Lake St. Joseph site is basic like the camp. I prefer the comfortable, rustic, less expensive Camp Lake St. Joseph. I've got lawn and flowers at home and don't want them at a fishing camp. So the choice of camp depends on what you are looking for, but Lake St. Joseph is great no matter where you choose to stay."

558175,Guest,2006-06-08 00:34:00,0,"No lake trout or smallmouth that I know of. We probably get 85 to 90% walleyes, the rest northerns. But we fish for walleyes and don't really go after northerns except for part of an afternoon or so. I believe that Merle and Doug have gone out as guides with a group occasionally in the past. They may have a local guide available, but you should call them or email them to ask."
