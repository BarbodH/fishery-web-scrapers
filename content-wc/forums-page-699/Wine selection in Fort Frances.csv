558021,Guest,2006-06-03 12:22:00,0,"LOL...Reminds me... Our resort owner made a screw up on our reservation. When we arrived our cabin was occupied. The resort owner got us into a different (smaller) cabin. Then, feeling bad, he brought over a bottle of Crown Royal ...you know, to smooth things over. He drank almost the whole bottle :):)...and, by golly, he no longer felt bad. :)"
558084,Crappie Kid,2006-06-05 12:57:00,1581,"I will just bring my own: 1997 Merlot, Napa Valley - Carneros ORIGIN: From a small eight-acre parcel planted in the 1980s as one of the first narrow-spaced vineyards in Napa Valley, comes our 1997 Merlot, Napa Valley - Carneros. Produced in limited quantities since its genesis in 1992, we are pleased to introduce the 1997 vintage of this prestigious, award-winning Merlot. Crafted from fruit predominantly grown on our oldest estate vineyard in Carneros, the 1997 blend consists of 93% Merlot, 4% Cabernet Sauvignon, and 3% Malbec. VINEYARD: Located at the cool southern corner of Napa Valley, Carneros soils are diverse due to a complex geological and climatic history and heavily influenced by the San Pablo Bay. Our sloping estate vineyards contain 1,520 vines per acre featuring rootstock 5C which produces a shallow rooting vine suited for the heavy clay loam soils in Carneros and takes advantage of the cool growing season which develops complexity and intensity. Our merlot is grown on a clone hand selected in Pomerol, France. WINEMAKING: The grapes were hand picked in mid September 1997 and then lightly crushed, leaving a percentage of whole berries that were pumped over traditionally and pressed to barrel for malolactic fermentation. The wine underwent 25-27 days of extended maceration and was aged for 18 months in new, medium-plus toasted French oak barrels. It was neither fined nor filtered prior to bottling in August 1999. TASTING NOTES: Fleshy, sweet fruits like dark cherry and blueberry, wrapped in hints of cola, vanillin, caramel brown sugar and dried sweet herbs, complement the firm tannin structure in this supple, medium-full bodied Merlot. Subdued mocha and cherry flavors are enveloped in the toasty long finish. Enjoy now or cellar for more than ten years or longer. This vintage produced 3,570 (750 ml) cases and is available in the 3.0L format."

We brought 94's of Dominus, Beringer Reserve and a few bottles of Stag's leap Fay. If I added it up I could have sold that wine and paid for our trip. Then again I'll never have that time with my Dad again. All in all it was a bargain. We were over the limit and would have paid duty but the customs agent was feeling generous. Oh and we had more than our share of LaBatts Blue as well."
557939,Crappie Kid,2006-06-01 09:23:00,1581,Is there a beer-wine-liquor store in Fort Frances or on the way to Vermillion Bay that has a large wine selection?
557947,Guest,2006-06-01 12:03:00,0,The LCBO is your best bet.
557986,jigman 2003,2006-06-02 07:07:00,981,"I'm sorry, but I can't resist. Why on earth would you take wine into your camp? Drink some beer or mixers for crying out loud. I'll forgive you if you are taking wives or girlfriends; otherwise come on man."
557987,rpieske,2006-06-02 07:52:00,1276,"What??? Now if you drink wine you are a girly man? You don't have to be unsophisticated to be a fisherman. I think my 8 year old grandson's reply to me after his Grandma gave him a pink oxford shirt would be appropriate here: ""You know Grandpa, you have to be a real man to wear pink."""
557991,Crappie Kid,2006-06-02 08:41:00,1581,Why on earth would you take wine into your camp? Because I like wine with my steaks and Italian dinners. There will be plenty of Leinies too!
557992,jigman 2003,2006-06-02 08:49:00,981,"I like wine with food too, at home with my wife. Wine and Canada just do mix in my mind, sorry. Girly man? I didn't say that (I may have implied it). Are you going to bring along wine glasses too? You know that wine really needs to be served in a wine glass in order to be able to truly taste the finer qualities. You may miss out on the hint of oak without the glasses."
557998,Guest,2006-06-02 10:18:00,0,Yea you just don't get the same flavor out of wine in a can. :boozer:
558007,Guest,2006-06-02 21:10:00,0,"During our week of fishing we invite the resort owners for dinner. Prime rib, walleye hordurves, salad, sweet corn, bottle of cabernet. Prety good grazing. Then enjoy a beautiful Canadian sunset. Glass of wine, good cigar."
558018,Guest,2006-06-03 09:32:00,0,:) What next? Best flies and line weights for walleyes? jist kidding.
558019,tly,2006-06-03 10:31:00,1900,Is it closer to redneck mode if we have screwcap instead of cork?
