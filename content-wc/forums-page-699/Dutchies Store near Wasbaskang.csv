558108,Mohleye,2006-06-06 10:37:00,368,I'm pretty sure Dutchies is not a liquor store.

558169,Trailerguy,2006-06-07 20:47:00,1407,[font color=green size=3][b]I guess I've not payed much attention to their landing at the reservation. We're usually out in the middle in travling mode as we go by. I have heard that someone has set up a small sawmill on the reserve and is producing excellent lumber building materials at a resonable price. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby
