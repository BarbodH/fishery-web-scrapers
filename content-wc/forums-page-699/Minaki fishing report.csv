558031,Guest,2006-06-03 22:14:00,0,"Our group of 12 have returned home today. When we arrived on June 27th, the water temperature was 62 degrees. Usually it is anywhere from 44-52 degrees. This affected the smallmouth bite on the system in a negative way. We found some 70 degree water and hammered the smallmouth there. There were 4 smallmouth 19 inches or greater caught during the week. Around 6-8 18 inchers also, with many 17 inch smallmouth. The largest walleye was 27 inches. Largest muskie was 44 inches, and Pike was 36 inches. The walleye, pike and muskie are usually larger than this. There was no problem cathing walleye and sauger. There were numerous jumbo perch caught that had not spawned, and were released. Some of the sauger had not spawned either. The weather was in the 80's on June 28th, and the last 4 days of the trip was in the 68-72 temperature range. It was a good trip all in all, Don"

558045,Guest,2006-06-04 12:42:00,0,"Aaron, Most of the smallmouth have not spawned. Only in the warmest areas. I would guess only about 10% have spawned. Don"
558051,Guest,2006-06-04 18:21:00,0,"Don, How would you rate the walleye bite? We are leaving in about 12 days. Would appreciate your info. Were they in the traditional spots or did you have to search for them? Thanks much, glad you had a good trip. Slim"
558060,Guest,2006-06-05 08:16:00,0,"Slim, The walleye were in traditional spots. Good Luck, Don"
558076,Guest,2006-06-05 11:50:00,0,"We only spent 4 hours fishing for walleye's , and I found some have moved closer to the big lake spots earlier then usual. Nothing big this week, but just right for the fish fry. We are still doing lakers in Vermillion. Plus the big pike have really picked up in there. We had 1 40"" pike. the lakers where smaller , around 22"""
558079,Guest,2006-06-05 11:58:00,0,"Brian D. Were the walleys nice size? If you don't mind me asking, how deep did you find the eyes? thanks for all your info, Fork-Nutz"
558082,Guest,2006-06-05 12:23:00,0,"In my secret spot the only one I won't tell of they were in 5 - 8 feet of water, other then that 16' to 20' seemed to be the magic depth. But as the sun goes down I love tossing a jig into the shallows. Last week I had a hard time getting them in the slot. to big or to small and the depth was about the same. This week 15"" to 17"" was about average. But again I didn't spend to much time doing walleyes. Come mid july I switch from lakers to walleyes full time. I'm thinking the washboard should be the spot for lots of big one eyes by next week."
558129,Guest,2006-06-06 20:47:00,0,Would the washboard be the bridge?
558151,Guest,2006-06-07 12:34:00,0,"between Little sand and big sand. There is a cliff with a reef. The whole reef will produce when the fish are passing by , but if you know the key spots there a lot of big fish hang there for a while. Try on the outside of the edge closer to the West side of the reef"
