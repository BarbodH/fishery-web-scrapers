4915905,Thompmd,2016-06-10 09:47:00,320,"Your office overlooks LOTW, are you hiring, I will work for bait. Why didn't I ask what you do, because it doesn't matter. I bet lunchtime rocks."
4922001,deadhead1,2016-06-13 06:39:00,193,"Walleye are finally starting to bite! Weekend was great. Still not fully up to usual but was able to find some better size fish and much better numbers of fish. I found them on a hump in 47 feet of water on Friday evening but by Saturday they had moved up to 29 ft. I ate a few and they where full, I mean packed full, of tiny minnows less than an inch long. That means they are actively feeding or they are full and won't bite! I'm not sure which."
4922945,Redline,2016-06-13 10:54:00,73,This is good news!
4923929,BRP,2016-06-13 15:15:00,77,"We had some luck in current and on a couple of rocky points, all in about 20 feet of water. A bunch in the 15 to 18 inch range and a couple of 23 inchers. All within 5 minutes of Kenora."
4925577,deadhead1,2016-06-14 07:00:00,193,"Went out again last evening. from 4:00 to 5:30 was slow until I found them in 29 feet of water on a mid lake hump. Then went back out with wife from 7:00 till 9:30, same spot and hammered them. Also tried a few other spots and got some but not great. Seem to be in 27 to 32 feet."
4926169,Guest,2016-06-14 09:35:00,0,Do you actually fish for them in 47 FOW? I'm assuming you know that is probably a 95% mortality rate at that depth.
4926185,Redline,2016-06-14 09:36:00,73,I think he meant the hump he fished on was in 47' of water but presumably the hump was shallower. I could be wrong.
4926625,Low4fish,2016-06-14 11:30:00,37,I was out last night as well and concur . The bite has picked up. The lake was flat calm so decided to take a run down to deadbroke. Stopped on a few humps and saw fish at the 30 ft mark. Most of the catching was done in the 20 22 foot range. It does look like things have turned a corner which seems later than last year. So don't discount those humps because it's earlier than normal. Areas with current were also good at shallower depths.Sent from my SM-N910W8 using Tapatalk
4929273,deadhead1,2016-06-15 09:29:00,193,No I don't catch and release them in that depth but I do put a few in box for lunch from that deep if that is what it takes.
4910625,Redline,2016-06-08 10:05:00,73,"Hoping the warming up will help you. Weather the next week or so looks amazing. I don't trust it outside of 3 days or so, but its looking like all time type weather for us next week."
4910913,deadhead1,2016-06-08 11:33:00,193,slow is the word for walleyes. I talked to many locals and I haven't found anyone who says it is good. On weekend we fished hard for 3 hours in all our usual spring spots to catch 10 fish. Did find one about 8 lb on a hump.
4910961,Redline,2016-06-08 11:39:00,73,The past 2 years have been like that for us. We always fish Fathers Day weekend. The year before that was non stop bite. I hope it heats up by next week.
4912049,Low4fish,2016-06-08 19:30:00,37,Glad to read this. Thought it was just me and was starting to get a complex. Been to a bunch of regular spots and looking in 10 to 20 foot of water only to scratch out a few eyes. Could just be the bite is off. Sent from my SM-T800 using Tapatalk
4912265,Smallmouth Hunter,2016-06-08 21:03:00,84,Appreciate all the response. Heading out in about 15 hours and we will see what we can put together starting Friday evening. I will post a report when I get back or before if possible. Good luck all.
4913105,mrpike24,2016-06-09 08:55:00,54,"Heading up in one week so appreciate the updates! Doesn't seem like there has been a ""hot"" walleye bite yet, so hopefully the warmer weather will ramp things up this next week. Good luck everyone!"
4913129,Redline,2016-06-09 09:06:00,73,I'm with you. I hope this weather heats the bite up!
4913273,deadhead1,2016-06-09 09:45:00,193,"Last evening I went out on the point in front of our cabin. I usually catch good there this time of year but this year very few bites and what did bite was very small. Just to see what was there I dropped my underwater camera down and slowly moved around. I saw walleye from 35 ft deep all the way into shore in 3 feet. Also perch and bass. I fished about 2 hours and caught about 8 walleye and 2 perch, all small. I was jigging with minnows and I caught as many with jig sitting still as when I moved it around. Also caught a few casting and slow popping jig across bottom back to boat. I also tried leeches but never even had a bite on them. Also in evening, just before dark, there has been a lot of fish rising to, what I think is fish fly's, so if this is the walleye they probably are not hungry! I'm not sure what other kind of fish it could be."
4913793,BRP,2016-06-09 12:27:00,77,"10 fish between 2 guys in 3 hours, including an 8 pounder - I guess if it is how you make your living you might consider that slow. But for those of us chained to a desk during the week, I call that that one great Saturday morning!"
4915457,deadhead1,2016-06-10 07:38:00,193,"I'm used to a lot better than that for this time of year. 10 an hour is more normal and, at times, it is even better than that. I'm chained to a desk too but my office window over looks LOTW so I guess that helps. I have regular go to spots that didn't even get a bite this year so I'm not sure the reason. Just a different year."
4902105,Smallmouth Hunter,2016-06-05 17:35:00,84,Heading out in around 91 hours for Moore Bay Lodge near Kenora. Anybody with any fishing reports? How are the smallies looking? Have the started heading to their beds yet? Any reports for any species would be great. Thanks all.
4903649,deadhead1,2016-06-06 08:09:00,193,Walleye is slow. At least from what I can find and from a few others I have spoken to. Not sure about bass. But weather has been unstable which won't help.
4903665,Redline,2016-06-06 08:16:00,73,I'm looking for any reports from LOW. We'll be up next week/weekend and the weather looks to be stabilizing and heating up. I hope that helps pick up the bite.
4907921,Thompmd,2016-06-07 09:58:00,320,http://lakeofthewoodsmn.com/lake-of-...port-6-6-2016/ At least its something. I hope as people go/return they let the rest of us know. I will post when I return on 6/11
4909089,bellbuoy,2016-06-07 18:02:00,490,"From the Witch Bay page on Facebook posted this morning, 6/7/16: Greetings from WBC. Recent rains and wind have brought water temps from a peak at 58F back down to 55F in the main basin of Andrews. Back bays are down to 62F from a peak of 67F. Weed growth has increased with leafy non-cabbage weeds almost reaching the surface in 4-6' of water. Cabbage is developing in spots about a foot off the bottom. Calm round rock shorelines were swarmed with baitfish and fish were seen actively feeding on them in the shallows yesterday. Water levels have fallen in the past couple of weeks from slightly above normal to about a foot lower than normal levels."
4909257,Thompmd,2016-06-07 19:01:00,320,"For the WB update. Being the only guy on the planet not on Facebook I wondered why it wasn't on their site My return is 7/11 not 6/11, wishful thinking on my part."
4909553,Smallmouth Hunter,2016-06-07 20:54:00,84,Thanks all. T-minus 40 hours
4909609,ftfarms,2016-06-07 21:14:00,444,I talk to two different resorts in the morson area alot and sounds like walleye fishing in that area has been really good.
4909673,BRP,2016-06-07 21:59:00,77,We caught 3 smallies in the 2 pound range in about 30 minutes just north of town island. We were jigging for walleye at the time with pink jigs and gulp minnows in 15 feet off a point. Caught enough walleye for dinner too.
4909929,MN_Moose,2016-06-08 05:48:00,964,From lotw now. Wall eyes have been slow and spread out. First of the week everyone said they were shallow 6-8. Now deep 35-40. A few smallies in the shallows mostly small males. Almost no pike to speak of. Wish I could give a better story. It's been better and it's been worse.
