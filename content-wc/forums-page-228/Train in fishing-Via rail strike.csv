I called Via Rail yesterday to clear up some information they had on their website about transporting 2 boxes of groceries free in hermetically sealed boxes. I wanted a definition of hermetically sealed boxes and would a taped sealed cooler quality. I got a recorded message saying Via Rail would go on strike June 13th, seek other methods of travel and refunds would be given. As an alternate Lodge 88 could fly us in from White river, double the drive for us and I really enjoy the train ride. I would appreciate input from our Canadian friends, are the negotiations going forward to prevent a strike and what is the possibility of a strike? Seanik"

4929241,Seanik,2016-06-15 09:17:00,218,"Life is good, the Via Rail strike threat is settled. I got an email from Via Rail defining what a hermetically sealed box for groceries is on trains that offer regional services. No foam coolers, they OK'ed plastic coolers with the lid taped shut. For those that train in to fishing, each person is allowed 2 checked bags( 18 gal. totes) and 2 hermetically boxes of groceries free with your ticket. Seanik"
