And you get a pdf file of the license to print. I would recommend that you put both of these on your phone! Here's why: We came through the border Saturday and MNR had a fish check going on. We each had four walleyes packaged flat in sealer bags and marked properly. We had them in the cooler with quick access for a fish check. I had a paper copy of my license in my passport - ready for inspection. My buddy had to get out and get his out of his tackle box. Guess what? Turns out he forgot his tackle box at the camp 4 1/2 hours north!!! The CO was very good, pleasant, etc. He did a nice job. He asked if he had any other proof he bought the license. He was able to bring up his receipt of purchase from his email account on his phone. The CO accepted that as proof and we were on our way. BTW - second year in a row we got checked. Expect to be checked, have everything ready, and it goes pretty fast. The COs have been great both times."
4926017,pjshorthorn,2016-06-14 08:40:00,5654,I believe a CO can run your Outdoors Card and verify whether you have a current license. It doesn't help if the card is in the tackle box as well. What road was the fish check station ? I've been checked on 502 in the past. PjShorthorn.

4926145,kzoofisher,2016-06-14 09:25:00,5144,"And remember that the print out must be full size, no cutting down to save space. I keep mine with my passport because I think you need to have both with you on the water anyway. Mine and the kid's go in a ziplock bag and then in a pocket of my rain bibs. Haven't forgotten it get."
