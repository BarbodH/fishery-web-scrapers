Looking for any general advice on the lake and a what to expect for fishing in mid July. We're staying at Procyk's . Thanks!"

We were going once or twice a year when the drive was more favorable. We'll be fishing there later this month and I can let you know about the fishing while we're there. We normally plan our trips in either June or September. I find the camp owners are helpful & willing to give you tips & suggestions. They're more in tune with the time of year, weather & other conditions on the lake."

I personally had 3 over 27"", ( biggest was 27 3/4), 4 over 26"" and around a dozen 23""-25"". Didn't even bother to count the over 20's. Of course the 18"" was the toughest find. LOL But with no complaints. Eaters were everywhere, and I would venture to guess the dink to over ratio was a good as it's ever been! A great week. C-C-Cold, but great. 4 guys in my boat ran through 86 dozen minnows in 4 1/2 days.We fished the normal spots as your camp owner will suggest. We fished from 12 ft to 22 ft depth depending on sky cover and wind. Calm conditions required some movement, windy conditons, spot lock. Jigged 99% of time. Some in my group pulled lindys and cranks with equal success except for size.As always, The Boot, Sterits, Fishermans's, always produced. But I personally did better, for size, away from the crowd on Islands with structure. There were a lot of boats sitting out on mid lake reefs. I imagine with good success as they were out there most of the week.Pick a spot or Island, keep'er on the bottom, and if you are not on them in 20 minutes.............MOVE and repeat! You're bound to find them.Good Luck"
4922873,Coyoteman,2016-06-13 10:22:00,209,Glad to hear the size seems better this year. Last few years seemed slow in the big fish department. I'll be there in august

I thought I knew boat control but I was schooled a few times up thereLooks like Gull Rock has some more forgiving (""easier"") areas to fish. Looking forward to the trip and the challenges of a new body of water"
