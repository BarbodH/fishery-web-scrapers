4924353,Campcountry,2016-06-13 17:33:00,164,IIRC It is against the law to sell salted minnows in Ontario. Perfectly fine to use them but you can't find them for sale. It all has to do with people using salties to chum for whitefish while ice fishing on Lake Simcoe. It works so well that the government banned selling salties province wide in order to control it.
4927441,neldog257,2016-06-14 16:35:00,16,I called a bait shop in Fort Francis and was told they could not sell salted minnows. Guy said we would have to salt them on our own. No problem I said. I asked him for a price of 60 doz. (6 guys in our group). He quoted me $328 American. There is your answer to the salted minnow enforcement. I'm sure crawlers will be next.
