I will mostly be fishing the Swell Bay/Red Gut Bay areas, as I have a small boat and don't want to get caught too far from home in open water on a windy day. Does anyone have any fishing reports or spots in the area they would be willing to share/recommend so I can get on the fish quickly? I will mostly be going for Walleye and Smallies, but always enjoy catching some Pike as well. Thanks for the input! Blake"
