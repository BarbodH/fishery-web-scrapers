They're tired of sitting on the sidelines while I go (been 6 times to LS) so I thought I'd ask. They jumped on it. I've never fished Cedar before so any advice, spots, or pointers that could help me put my girls on fish would be appreciated. Anyone else going to be there at Northern Lights that week? Thanks"
4917289,Lmbkiller,2016-06-10 22:41:00,639,"I guess I don't get why u would go somewhere u have never been on your daughters maiden voyage, when u know LS fairly well being that u went there 6 times. I would go with a familiar place that I have confidence and experience in, not virgin waters. But if your dead set on cedar, good luck, I havnt been there in 30yrs so my limited info is outdated"
4917305,MOfish,2016-06-11 04:28:00,39,"Lac Seul is big water. When the wind blows, it can get a little scary and I didn't want to traumatized them on their first maiden voyage."
4917329,ftfarms,2016-06-11 05:00:00,444,I've always stayed at cedar point resort and mostly fished the east side not sure if your wanting to boat that far. The first year we fished cedar we did fish the west side but didn't do as well as the east side. I would say you need to check out the beaver dam in Nielson lake if it's still there not to fish but to see it. While your in Nielson lake if the wind is blowing into the north weed bed I've done real well there. (On the east arm)The east side of the two islands after you go threw musky narrows can be good and the west side of gull island there's a reef that runs out about a 1/4 mile or better I've done well on it. All on the east side of the lake so it's a ride for a camp boat. The islands in front of cedar point can be good. On cedar we do alot of casting jigs with worms usually a slow presentation works best.

4921409,1jigfish2,2016-06-12 21:05:00,110,"We stay at Northern Lights a lot. Make sure you fish off the pier in the evening, awesome fishing then. Try right across the lake against the rock wall. Ask anyone in camp to mark a map for you, they are very helpful. You get free bait, so jig and minnow seems to work best."
4924409,pale ryder,2016-06-13 17:56:00,1937,"I've fished cedar in August several times, and have caught fish trolling and casting crank baits, jigging, Lindy rigging, slip bobbering and on spinner rigs. With some fish coming from in the weeds but most of the fish were on the deep weed edge and on rock points breaks and humps in 8' to 20' deep. I haven't found either the east or west arm to be better than the other, so since we stay at Clark's we spend more time on the west arm.Here is a marked map; http://nebula.wsimg.com/8fbc22112850...&alloworigin=1"
4924649,MOfish,2016-06-13 19:12:00,39,Thanks everyone for your advice. I'm sure hoping we can put some fish in the boat!
