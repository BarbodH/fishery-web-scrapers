Fishing was slow the first few days as the weather was really in a state of flux. The winds and temps were both shifting a lot. The fishing reflected this, as the fish did not seem to be following the usual movement patterns. Toward the end of the week, we had excellent success with walleyes in the bay where the floating cabin was. We also had some success in Bruce Lake during the rough weather, particularly fishing in some of the protected coves. Minnows and crawlers were both working well, leaches were slower than in years past. On our best days, the bite was really strong in the mid afternoon. Some other areas that produced fish were the beach at the Provincial Park and the islands on the east side of the lake near the park. Some in our group ventured farther south and had some success where the river flows out of Pakwash."
