At that time of year I would recommend starting out at Steamboat Narrows with jigs (gold or pink 1/4 oz or 3/8 oz depending on the wind), then try the islands at the end of Steamboat or the islands off far end of Cox Island. I would also recommend trolling with gold, pink or white spinners with a 1/4 oz split shot or bottom bouncer (1 oz) in those areas as well. The fish may be in deeper water, but start at 8-12 feet and move out if needed. Adjust your trolling speed as needed to produce the reaction strike."

What usually works is use your sonar to locate fish and either anchor or use your electric trolling motor to position your boat over them and vertical jig. If you drive over a spot and don't mark anything, try some place else."

That Public service announcement aside, jigs, twister bodies in various colors, sunken islands, inside turns with nearby deep water, and use the wind as your friend, making drifts across points and humps."
