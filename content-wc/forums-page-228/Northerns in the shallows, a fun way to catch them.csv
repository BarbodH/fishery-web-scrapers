The grassy areas were filled with water and we found tons of northern's chasing minnows in about a foot to two feet of water. We caught numerous fish between 20 and 30 inches on our walleye rods with 8# line and 20# Fluro leaders, it was a riot! They can't go down, only sideways; they looked like bonefish streaking through a flat. The KILLER rig was when I took an orange floating jig head and put a minnow on it and twitched it. It lasted on average about 10 seconds before being smashed. I probably caught 40 northern and only lost one jig. I included a pic of where we were fishing and one that was 30"". The water was 57 degrees."
