Entry to Canada at 1PM on Friday June 3rd took about 40 minutes. First stop was U.S. border patrol and others doing exit interviews, inspecting inside vehicles, running the dogs, etc. Not exactly sure what they were looking for, there were literally MN state, county, border patrol and homeland security, probably 20+ officers. When we hit the Canada post, it was two lanes with some people sitting at the windows for 5 minutes literally. I don't get it, either wave them over for secondary or let them through. We hit the window with my Nexus card on top of buddies passport with rubber band holding open to the identity page. Literally rapped through the questions in 30 seconds and were gone. Typical how much alcohol, tobacco, any firearms, mace, etc. Only question on bait was ""live bait"", nothing about salted for those wondering. The return on Saturday June 11th at 8AM and was greeted by MNR checking EVERYONE. Probably 15 boats lined up being checked. Of course my fish was frozen on bottom of cooler under ice, so we had to empty it first of the stuff we didn't eat, not a big deal. When asked how many fish, I gave exact count on Walleye, perch, whitefish and splake. I then showed individually bagged fillets and counted them out. They put the dog in the boat and around the car, then sent us on our way. Of those 15 boats in line, only one left before us. We literally were close to last in and almost first out. I believe that was because I answered all questions quickly and truthfully and had my fish organized in a way that made it very easy to verify. That was probably a 10 minute experience for us. Border back into U.S. took about 20 seconds. I don't see reports on Pigeon river crossing, so thought I would provide one."

On the way in we got a quick glance in the back of the truck by the MN guys and breezed through the border with the same questions, just had to go in and pay duty on the extra beer. Coming back the MNR guy looked in my cooler at the fish that were wrapped in paper, never checked licenses or had me uncover the boat. We spent more time visiting than inspecting. US customs took less than a minute. It was a very good experience crossing both ways. Kudos to all the enforcement officials on both sides of the border."
