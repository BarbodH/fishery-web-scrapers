Trident itself as well as adjacent Marr Lake were pretty well loaded with walleye and pike. No giants but very good numbers.It's a pretty entertaining report with a good number of photos and several videos including a camp tour.Check it out, if you're a trout guy you'll find it interesting I'm sure.

Although the rest of the guys are Canadian, my brother lives in St. Catherines and I drink Canadian so that makes me pretty much Canadian, eh ? Look forward to more trip reports this year.
