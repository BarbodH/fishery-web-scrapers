She had surgery on Friday. Needless to say, the trip is off. #1 concern is for the wife, but I'll tell you, cancelling that close to the departure date was a tough one. At least we've still got plans for a fall trip. Now I've got to see if the camp owner will be willing to let me transfer our deposits to the fall trip, or if we forfeit them. I felt real bad for my two buddies who had to suffer this with me."
4923321,johnboat,2016-06-13 12:41:00,2014,That's tough luck Bake. But nothing else you could do. Best wishes to the Mrs. Enjoy your fall trip!

In all seriousness, I'm sure glad to hear you cancelled for the love of your life---it's the right thing to do....but........"
4926009,Bakefish,2016-06-14 08:39:00,1077,"I've thought of that irony myself. Cancelling was never in question. She's busted up pretty bad. After counting off the days for the last six months and then having to scrap with two days remaining...well you can imagine. I can't wait for this week to be over, because I keep thinking where I'd be fishing and what I'd be doing if I were in Canada."
