Those which have not been hooked, i.e., the leftovers, could potentially reproduce, and if a non-desirable, change the lake's specie composition. My guess is that this is not a high probability occurrence (a non-desirable from the minnow dealer does happen, I know, some odd ones will appear every now and then). Again, my guess is that the law was created more to stress the degree of interest in not introducing non-desirables. Other factors, such as waterfowl, turtle migration, raccoon transportation, etc, just cannot be controlled. My opinion is that anglers ""stock"" very few lakes by dumping their bait, but this is just my opinion, other may disagree with my opinion. On a parallel subject, Iowa passed a new law a few years ago which stated anglers must dump their minnows immediately prior to leaving a body of water and cannot take the bait away. This presents some interesting circumstances, such as getting in the car and stopping to fish at the cove around the corner, or taking the bait home to salt, or put in an aerator for a return trip tomorrow, etc., etc. I'm glad I'm not a warden appears to be a mess, again, in my opinion. Maybe the law got changed, I didn't look this year. Bill"

And that's only a small step from banning live bait of any type and barbed hooks, similar to what some other Canadian provinces (at least in part) are doing. The only thing preventing this right now is the influence of the large number of bait fisherman and retailers who depend on selling live bait for a living."
4927665,GBS,2016-06-14 17:49:00,2271,"Seems to be an attempt to control the numbers game. A dropped minnow, or even one bucket, doesn't stand much of a chance of surviving. They might, but the odds are way against them. Look how many walleye are stocked in Minnesota lakes every year, and yet we are not overflowing with walleye. But, if you figure a place that attracts a thousand or two anglers a year, and they each dump a dozen (or whatever), then the odds of establishing a breeding population go up.... Maybe not on the order of a real stocking effort, but still it shifts the odds, so why take the increased chance? Same with worms - they mostly will drown pretty fast, but dump enough of them, and odds increase that one pregnant one will make it to land... Water transport between bodies is another point to speculate about...."
4927745,Obabikon,2016-06-14 18:41:00,2370,"Yes it is illegal to dump bait. It is the last ditch effort to stop one coming through the cracks. If a business buys/sells minnows, we are responsible to sort each minnow that we distribute. If we find a species of minnow we are unfamiliar with, we are to report it and keep the minnow out of circulation. The bulk bait dealer is supposed to do the same thing on their end. The fisherman is the last line of defense."
4926481,johnboat,2016-06-14 10:59:00,2014,"So I am in Ontario, Canada. Going fishing. I buy 2 dozen minnows from the camp I'm staying at. I fish using them for bait. I use 22 of them on a jig, one of the little buggers slips out of my hand into the water. The remaining minnow gets dumped into lake to empty my bucket.Has the law been broken twice?Either way, why would I be sold something that is illegal to put in the lake in the first place?"
4926513,bigwalleye1,2016-06-14 11:06:00,2632,"Good question, John, and I'll be curious n the official answer. Aside from that, though...You have minnows LEFT at the end of the day? Just sayin'...."

4926553,tv4fish,2016-06-14 11:15:00,2694,"OH NOOOO -- We have now ""opened another can of worms"" (OK --- minnows) --- this outta be good"
4926697,wallydave,2016-06-14 11:57:00,2151,It would be hard for a CO to know how many minnows would have been dumped out. I believe on Lac Seul it is illegal to dump bait of any kind.
4926761,johnboat,2016-06-14 12:09:00,2014,"Wallydave, I guess that's kind of my point/question. I can use a night crawler or minnow on my hook for bait, but when I release the remaining 1/2 dozen or so, it's suddenly against the law. I always kind of thought when I threw my remaining night crawlers in the lake I was doing the fish a favor. A free meal if you will.I understand and support wanting to keep unwanted fish species out, but that's not what the bait shops are selling...........is it?"
4926833,tv4fish,2016-06-14 12:23:00,2694,"John: FWIW - on our last day - THAT is exactly what we do.....HMMMM - Maybe we should dump some in the FIRST day ---""chum"" them into our spots .... ????"
4927009,wallydave,2016-06-14 13:35:00,2151,"I agree with keeping invasive species out of all fisheries! Here in Central Illinois we are dealing with Asian carp in the Illinois river! The question comes ti mind, how often are invasive species introduced through using live bait? After using frozen salted minnows, with great success, I may never use life bait again! Ill try some again this year. If they work great again, that's what Ill be doing to prevent invasive species in the waters Ill be fishing!"
4927089,adempsey,2016-06-14 14:15:00,963,"I would guess it offers another level of protection. If someone brings minnows into a lake from an area they weren't supposed to, knowingly or unknowingly, at least they know they can be fined for dumping them into the lake."
4927313,Low4fish,2016-06-14 15:29:00,37,Who is to say that the minnows you bought at the cap came from the lake you are on . Many of the resorts buy from commercial bait operators that fly all over to Bring minnows in. I know that begs the question about why is it such a big deal if you release one minor when the bait operators bring in gallons throughout the season. Bait operators are subject to lots of rules in the background. My take on it is that the rules about releasing and moving bait are designed to prevent spread of invasive species. It only takes two gobies and before long you have a big problem.OSent from my SM-T800 using Tapatalk
