4924985,thomas_o_rourke,2016-06-13 21:04:00,8,If that rock is the same rock as the one we have hit before we are very use to it. Hoping the new Navionics chip has it marked correctly for us..
4880425,Smallmouth Hunter,2016-05-30 05:40:00,84,About 10 days out before our trip to the Northern part of LOTW. How is water level looking? As far as I can tell ion the Control Board website shows about a foot lower than the same time last year. Thanks
4880433,birddogger,2016-05-30 05:45:00,43,I'm looking at the lake now. south portion. It looks like 12-14 inches below normal.water temp at surface yesterday was 62.
4880537,skirkpat,2016-05-30 06:14:00,12,Is there still an open fire ban on the southeast portion of the LOW? Sabaskong bay area? A couple weeks ago it appeared almost all the LOW was under open fire restriction? Looking forward to shore lunch wallys in a couple months...
4881329,Low4fish,2016-05-30 10:44:00,37,Water is down 12 to 18 inches . Seeing rocks where they were not before. Sent from my SM-N910W8 using Tapatalk

4888457,deadhead1,2016-06-01 08:28:00,193,I'm on north east corner of LOW on Storm Bay and I would guess water is lower than normal but not by much. The last few years we have gone from extreme lows to extreme highs so not sure what normal is anymore! The rain we have been getting will likely raise water up a bit so no real problems.
4889033,Redline,2016-06-01 11:27:00,73,"2 years ago when the water was insanely high, we hit a rock that was submerged by over a ft of water that was typically 2ft out of the water. Found out after that section of the lake, on multiple LOW GPS chips, is off by 50 yards! I'd rather have water a foot low than 4 ft higher than normal....I learned that the hard way!"
4893849,Ver88,2016-06-02 17:40:00,114,"Redline, what area of the lake are you referring to? I don't want to have the same problem."
4894913,Redline,2016-06-03 06:42:00,73,"It was an area just south west of Yellow Girl Bay. Basically right as you make the turn west. It was an area I've never fished before and we went back there due to winds. I followed a cousin back there....I blame him. We fished for a while and we're looking for a way back on to the main marked path to Sioux Narrows. I was fixated on the GPS (mistake) and it showed us directly between the two rocks. I just started to give it gas and boom! The amazing part is, I've looked at the Google Earth images on a normal year and the Rock is way out of the water LOL. Lesson learned. Don't trust that the lake map is 100% correct. And 2 make sure you have someone looking out at all times. It's an incredibly dangerous lake if you're not 100% paying attention."
4895169,Ver88,2016-06-03 07:34:00,114,"Thanks, I think I know the area you are referring to. I have fished in there a few times but did not catch much. There is a really nice shore lunch spot around there that I have used in the past. We have yet to hit something on LOW with our outboard, but we have bumped a few rocks with the hull, all without much damage."
