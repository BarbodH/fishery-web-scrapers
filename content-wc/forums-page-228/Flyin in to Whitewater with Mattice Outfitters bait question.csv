I have done numerous fly-in trips to Birch Lake with Kay Air. Half of the guys bring leeches and crawlers, and I am a stubborn crankbait and spinnerbait guy. The live bait guys do well (everyone does well in Birch) I catch just as many fish and probably larger fish than they do. So my question is do we need to take some live bait with us to Whitewater lake? Have never fished it at all. This will be my wife and another couple going. This will be my brides first trip to Canada and I am excited about that! Would love to hear you folks opinions."
4929145,jveri,2016-06-15 08:46:00,70,Been to whitewater 7 times in the past 16 years and going for my 8th trip there two weeks tomorrow. Never have we used live bait except for the odd leech we caught while swimming or at shore lunch. This year we might order some frozen cisco from the Silver Minnow Bait shop to use for pike bait. You will enjoy your time at whitewater great lake and cabins at MLO.
4929161,Pikeslayer8,2016-06-15 08:54:00,1460,I'd suggest taking your new bride to see the Wendell Beckwith cabins on Best Island while you are there as a fun little side adventure. While it's still there. http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/...ticle12418824/
