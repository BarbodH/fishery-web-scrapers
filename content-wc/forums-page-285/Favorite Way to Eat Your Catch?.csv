Pan fried, deep fried, stir-fried. There's pineapple walleye, lemon walleye, coconut walleye, pepper walleye, walleye soup, walleye stew, wallaye salad, walleye and potatoes, walleye burger, walleye sandwich. That- that's about it."

How are you cooking that your first night? Fried, baked, grilled? For me, its hard to beat a healthy portion of deep fried beer battered walleye using the Shore Lunch batter. Grilled comes in a close second, especially after a few nights of that heavy fried batter."
3791441,MorganMan,2015-04-21 06:57:00,341,"Very popular question here. It's always nice to hear something new from new users, but if you use the search function and type in ""recipes"" or some version of that, you will see all kinds of threads over the years. There are some very creative people and recipes people have tried."
3791705,prov1800,2015-04-21 08:02:00,5010,"As a guide i happen to do quit a few shorelunches throughout the summer.of course shorelunches cant be beat out on the water with a beautifull few where my guests can sit back and relax and enjoy.have done pretty much every recipe out there but walleye needs to be fried.baked or grilled just doesnt cut it in my book.any shorelunch has to have a great fried potatoe dish to with more than potatoes and onoins.got to add some goidies like peppers, musrooms and some bacon.oh ya.as far as the walleye go.try this.take the fillets and dry them some then put them in a baggy and put some franks hot sauce in and coat fillets then i like to use andys fish mix (and they come in a few diff flavours) and then fry them.its a diff. Twist."
3791761,Walleye_Guru,2015-04-21 08:07:00,62,"Your simply not going to beat crushed ritz crackers deep fried in peanut oil. I just did this for our missions group at church and mouths were watering, people begging for more! Take the ritz, crush them in a 1ga freezer bag, season with lemon pepper or redden blackfish and that's all you need. Add the fillets (you can dip them in egg first but probably not that practical for shorelunch) and deep fry them in peanut oil. BOOM! Best walleye you'll ever taste... period!"
3792809,Draco1206,2015-04-21 11:26:00,175,"I'm with you. First night or two deep fried. Grilling is next. Melt a stick of real butter, add garlic powder and pepper and brush on the grilled walleye often as you're grilling. Baked is next. Rub olive oil on both sides of the fillets, season with garlic powder, seasoning salt and pepper. Bake for ten minutes at 400 degrees. For crispier fillets turn on broiler for last few minutes. Pretty simple stuff but it's all good."
3793129,itsme,2015-04-21 12:51:00,31,My best is also grilled...But: We use: Sliced Vadialia onions...sliced lemons double Alum foil butter under each filet. Alternate onion slices and lemon on top....make a tent with more alum foil. Place on a hot grill for 10 minutes and then dine in heaven. Tops for our family for years ItsMe

3794489,uv2021,2015-04-21 17:54:00,48,"Last year me and my friend ate 17 walley and 2 speckled trout in 7 days.Batter fried in lard.Dipped in egg and then shaken in spiced breadcrumbs.Canned chile or home fries to go with that .Also bring some soft tortilla shells.Fry the walley and then use some hummus and garlic sauce ,onion bits.Get a container of kimchi as a side ,some hot sauce. And you will eat until you can't eat no more.It did not hurt that we caught over 600 walley that trip.All walley that were eaten were 14 inches.They taste the best.If you look at the flesh of a 15-16 inch walley and compare it to a 17-18 you will see the difference,and taste it as well.Can't wait to get back out there"
3798817,Lovetofish,2015-04-22 15:39:00,458,First meal is always pan fried walleye in butter over medium heat so the butter doesn't burn. And a lot of butter so it bubbles around the fish. We first coat the fish chunks in pancake flour and season with salt and pepper and season again after we turn them. Preferably we can cook outside on the fire.
3798873,CanoeHead,2015-04-22 15:44:00,22,"For me simpler is better, but after a while a change is nice. Bite size chunks of walleye or pike wrapped in bacon is very good. A deep frier works well but they can be done in a pan as well."
