2806281,MuskyMaster,2014-05-17 20:20:00,79,"Pike will always be in weedy bays and will honestly hit just about anything, bass style spinner baits work well, jerk baits, weedless spoons ect.... Bigger pike will be hanging around drop offs in 10-20fow depending on how warm it is from now till then. Smallies will be shallow to 20 fow. jerkbaits, inline spinners, and topwaters work well early and late in the day. You can also catch a lot jigging or slip bobbering it. Smallies love leeches. They will be around any type of rocks n logs. Walleye move in shallow from an hour before dusk till an hour after sunrise and move out gradually. Night fishing an xrap is my favorite choice. Jigging and trolling wise they may be in 10 fow or in 30, may be on top, middle, or bottom of humps. Trolling works well to find the fish then you can jig that area. Perch pattern is my favorite color but bright days I like throwing hot colors. good luck"
2806393,Pooch,2014-05-17 21:08:00,4619,"Have fished Vaughn in the fall as we stay at Mahkwa and Vaughn was just an afternoon trip. In the fall it was dead for us, BUT it is a good spring and early summer lake I've been told by others on our group. Don't be afraid to go to the causeway bridge at Archies landing and fish on either side of it. There is some current there and it has been good for us at times.When you leave Vauhn going into Lac Seul you will go under the road. After going through the bridge under the road you will get to a large bay, you can veer to the right a little then you will see the causeway on your left. (Couple miles) Continue straight to Archies landing or you can go left out of Vaughn. When you go left you will soon see some posts or dead stumps sticking out of the water. Be careful there, but look for a rock pile that may or may not be visible near the stump field. We've caught smallies in that area. Rock pile could be submerged with the high water though. Be careful everywhere in that whole area.What outpost are you staying at? How do you get there? By boat from the Ear Falls area? Long ride.Let us know how you do.Pooch"
