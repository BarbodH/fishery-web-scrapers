3789265,leachmin&worm,2015-04-20 16:21:00,32,"I would take your children through Intn'l Falls and look at NW Ontario. There are tons of places to go. They range from moderatly priced to first class as if you were staying at the Magnificant Mile in downtown Chicago. Many of the resorts and/or lodges offer some rate cut for the young ones. Some offer a military cut as well. Most important, you must keep the kids attention throughout. Its a family fishing trip. They need to catch fish. A guide can be invaluable for the first few days. It frees you up and they can prepare shore lunches while you and the kids continue to fish. Also, lakes where there are tributaries and lots of Islands and bays. I choose a place last year that was great. Our cabin was at the top of a cliff, with a westerly overlook exposure. It was fantastic. A constant breese kept the bugs down. The cabin was beautiful but simple. Boat and motor were perfect. 18ft x 40hp fully loaded. I searched on the internet high and low. I looked at Google Maps extensively to see what exposure we would have as a camp. If you find a place you deem worth looking into, look for some ammenities. Just remember, everything costs."
3669002,mrwalleye5,2015-03-19 15:08:00,1922,Both our kids ( girl and boy) were both born in early winter(Nov and Dec). They were in the boat the following spring. We traveled up to the Flin Flon area of Manitoba every 1st week of June for a number of years. They did not start fishing til they were the ripe old age of three.

They're both used to being in the boat and a little portable DVD player does wonders on the long drive. They are already looking forward to going again this June. I was 3 or 4 when I made my first trip....everything turned out ok! Best luck Matt"

I have 3 boys and they have been on many, many trips starting at a very young age. The 27 and 20 year old are going in June. they love it!!! Attached is the a couple of pics of my 20 year old, past and present. His smile when he caught his first Canadian Walleye tells it all. He was just was starting to get his adult teeth. Enjoy!!!!Ben's First Walleye - Copy.pdf"

3714826,bkw67,2015-03-31 12:30:00,70,"My oldest daughter (who is now a freshman in college) got me back into fishing when she was 4. We did lots of local fishing in Illinois and some weekend trips with both my girls as well. I took both of them to Canada (Fly-In) for the first time when they were 9 & 13. They both had to be able to tie their own knots and handle their own tackle. They both learned how to clean fish and the oldest started to learn how to pilot a boat. Most recently, we spent a week in the U.P. fishing.I will be taking both of them (who will be 15 and almost 19) in July to the same fly-in lake in Ontario."
3718354,leachmin&worm,2015-04-01 12:44:00,32,"I took my youngest to canada fishing when he was ten. But before i took him, I told him he needed to learn to swim. My reasoning as with my older children, I don't want to worry about you on big or little water for 12 hours a day for a week. Well as fate would have it at twelve years old he is one of the top swimmers at his YMCA. Needless to say he loves the water an looks forward ever year for the big trip. When we had started taking the big trips to Canada, I started with a little caution. I booked trips close to towns, with lakes and outfitters that had minimal amount of traffic. Also, having another adult along weather an adult child or relative/friend that helps. That way your no doing everything yourself all day long. We are getting close to doing a fly-in with my children."
3788937,Ken Bell,2015-04-20 15:24:00,2,"I started taking my sons when they were 9 many years ago. Now they have kids and started taking them. The oldest at 9 and the youngest at 7. The 7 year old was not ready and made it somewhat awkward. If he didn't catch a fish in 10 minutes he was done. So, it depends on the maturity and disposition of the kid. Think about how they participate in other activities to determine if they are ready."
3789025,leachmin&worm,2015-04-20 15:43:00,32,"Ken,Yes, maturity has a lot to do with the cause. Thats why I asked my son to swim to see if he was fully committed. My oldest boy is a natural hunter. Ever since he could pick up a poll and cast, he would search the shore line for his next catch. To this day he out fishes me. All my children with the exception of one daughter know how to fish. A couple are not as committed, they get distracted with life. But, all of them want to fish with me in Canada every year. But I can only afford to take Two at a time. My older sons and daughters are starting to pay there own way. My youngest wants me to arrange a two week stay in Canada. I told him I would love to, but sometime in the future."

This is not in Ontario, but I used to take my young kids and their friends camping in Voyagers Nat Park. Lots of on lake camping spots, trails and a few resorts to do some ice cream runs."

I remember well rushing home from school the last day of the year and pulling out for that 20 plus hour run up there from Ohio. I don't know how my dad did it, we would camp in the bush or on a beach during the worse weeks of black flies and taking care of 3 young boys.. Don't know how old I was but here are some pics that are very important to me as I still remember most of it and it planted that Canadian seed in my innermost soul."

Not 1 complaint.....but tough to complain when they were catching huge walleyes all day long! I have stayed at resorts that didn't charge anything for kids, and I have stayed at places where they charged 1/2 price for the boys. We typically are only renting the cabin, and do our own cooking. We also go with a several other friends with their kids and that helps."
3664090,Carnhzkr,2015-03-18 14:52:00,964,"My boys are now 17 and 20 and I began taking them when they turned 6. That's probably pushing it, but they're both really good kids and I've never heard a complaint. Especially on their first trip, I did a lot of preplanning on ways to keep their attention or divert it when the fishing was at a lull. We climbed a granite boulder, had picnics by the falls, and did a couple of portage lakes. On a particularly rainy morning, we'd take a trip into town and get an ice cream. I really, really, wanted those early trips to be fun for them so they'd be eager to go again the next year. I remember how long 10 hours in a boat can seem to a 6 year old, and I did not want to make that mistake. Other things I planned in advance were some fun little distractions to break up the drive: picnic lunch at Mine View in Virginia, mine tour in Sudan state park, toured the paper mill in IF. I must have done something right, because they're old enough to stay home on their own now, but they choose to come along. Good luck, and do it right. Make sure this is ""their"" trip too, and you will reap the benefits when they're older."
3665506,rnnonmt,2015-03-18 20:22:00,992,I started going on Canadian fishing trips when I was 10. My Dad had a lot of patience and he didn't keep me out all day. We had plenty of opportunity to head back to the houseboat for a break. I thoroughly enjoyed him getting me involved in fishing. I also started taking my son at age 10 and had the same scenarios. Plenty of fun and plenty of break time. I think that is the key to keeping your trip enjoyable and giving your kids a great experience.
3665530,Thordogg,2015-03-18 20:25:00,260,"I really want to do this and for sure would make the trip all about them. I make sure to have snacks, soda pop, and stuff to make it fun for them when we go closer to home. I try to have fish scouted out before i go when local. I want to be sure to not burn them out on the long car ride and a full week of fishing as i really want this to be a lifelong passion for them. That is why i am hesitant. I am glad to hear of successful trips for little guys there age."
3665698,rnnonmt,2015-03-18 20:58:00,992,I know it may be tough to accommodate your fishing trip to make it a great experience for your kids but sounds to me like you have already got it figured out Dad!!!!!
3667690,Pikeslayer8,2015-03-19 10:57:00,1460,"When I went on my first trip when I was 9, there was absolutely no mollycoddling whatsoever for me. I fished in the middle of the boat with my brother in the bow and my dad running the motor. We fished all day and there was no talk of going in early. Man, I remember some coldass times, the kind that makes ya want to pee on your hands just to tie a knot. Would never occur to me to ask to go in early. My first chores then were to haul water to the cabin in 5 gal. buckets and help with the dishes. I was treated just as one of the guys. It was just ""the program"" and I loved every minute of it. It was my rite of passage of manhood in my family. Over the years, the world is ever evolving except for fishcamp. Sure we got better lights and running water and a shower but for the youth in my family we were all pretty much treated the same. Weren't any specific rules other than no gameboys or other electronic games. My dad would have thrown them in the lake. The whole idea is to keep everyone completely involved with one another. On the other hand, my little sister sent her boys with us for a few years with their dad. These boys were mollycoddled. They packed enough cloths for a month and also had teddy bears for their bunks. My sister sent letters of encouragement for them to open every day...... With our crew it just didn't work very well. They were not nearly as vested with the rest of us, often just laying in their bunks. When I began taking my boys, I had them prepped for what is expected of them. Even at 9 years, both my boys could tie their own knots and handle themselves in the boat and around camp. They both love the Canadian experience and I personally don't ever want to go back without them. They are truly my secret weapons. I realize this runs contrary to how many look at this situation. Flame me if ya want, I got broad shoulders. This is just my experience for the original poster."
3667882,Carnhzkr,2015-03-19 11:33:00,964,"No flaming from me. Makes perfect sense. You made it clear up front what it would be like and set clear expectations for both the boys and adults. The important thing is you included them early on and both you and your boys are now benefiting from that. My dad wasn't much of a ""mollycoddler"" either. On one of my early trips, I think I was eight, I had broken my ankle earlier that summer, so I had a walking cast to my knee. The morning we were to drive north, I woke up with both of my cheeks swollen with the mumps. I doubt my dad ever considered delaying the trip. I remember riding the entire trip up resting my head on a pillow my mom held on her lap and moaning myself to sleep. My brother used a pair of pliers to remove the cast a week early on the island we were camping on."
3668058,Pikeslayer8,2015-03-19 11:56:00,1460,"Lol. Thanks Carnhzkr, great story! Reminds me of the time I broke my shin in 3 places getting bucked off a horse when I was 18. I had a full leg cast and I had my brother cut it off at the knee so I could deal with it in the boat. I was in a crapload of trouble when I got back and had to get a new cast. Mother was not too pleased."
3660146,Jatar,2015-03-17 13:29:00,169,"My son's first Canada trip was when he was 9, I was a little worried about him getting bored being on the boat all day, but, wasn't a problem. If there is someone who is similar in age with him, it makes life easier. Since he hasn't been introduced to Alcohol and cigars yet, having a friend alonghelps occupy the non-fishing time."
3660154,TheDFP,2015-03-17 13:33:00,39,"I have a 1 and 3 year old. After reading this, I think I am going to buy a boat. Couple more years and we will all be heading North of the border. As a father, this is probably the best fishing post I have ever read."
3660234,pitbull,2015-03-17 13:59:00,45,"Started both of my boys when they turned 6, that was there Birthday Present. They went in by Float Plane & Out by Train. At that time it was to Shenango Lodge, North West of Foleyt, Ont., they are both in their 40's now, and were hooked for life. The younger would get tire of fishing and would quit fishing and when he felt like it again, he always caught the biggest fish for the day, never failed. He now likes fishing L. Ontario for Salmon. The best was the quality time together!!! bar none. Dad"
3660426,MrSimon,2015-03-17 14:23:00,922,Somewhat contrary to what others (and myself) have said above ...... it might not be best to INTRODUCE kids to fishing on a trip up North. Starting them out locally and spending a few years working them up to a big trip can be good. It builds anticipation and will help them truly appreciate the fishing.
3660458,youngknight,2015-03-17 14:27:00,228,"I agree with the posters saying that the best trips can be, and usually are, the one with our kids. However, I would suggest that the kids should like to be out on the water and like fishing to begin with before a fly-in or other significant trip that often involves many hours in a vehicle driving to the lake or jump off point.I took my son when he was very young - less than 3 - but only on day trips, not too far from home. A kids perspective is different than ours. A series of short days with Dad out in the boat can, for them, be better than that 6 day fishing trip and 12 hour drive each way. Certainly, if and when the child shows a lot of desire for fishing, then a great trip can and should be had. Remember though that hours of non-interrupted fishing may be what we want, but a couple of hours here and there, some exploring, a swim, lots of snacks, some lying on a rock looking up at the clouds may very well be more important and memorable to them than catching another dozen fish.Also, my son loves fishing and going out in the boat - has his boating license now - but he loves me letting him off on an island or rocks so he can fish from land and have a little independence. One other thought - although fishing and such activities may be a huge recreation/vacation activity for us, kids can and do have other interests. As much as my son loves fishing (and going along hunting, and snowmobiling and hiking) he loves history. Last summer took a drive down through Gettysburg and to Washington DC to the Smithsonian museums...my first choice - nope, however, he loved being exposed to the history and a different experience. He is eagerly awaiting our fly-in trip this summer, but he will always also remember me taking vacation time to do something different that expands his horizons in another area of interest."
3660674,Coyoteman,2015-03-17 15:12:00,209,"I think it all depends on the kid. My oldest was three when I took her out in the boat for the first time. From day one that girl was hooked and even though I haven't taken her north of the border yet she makes every other fishing trip with me, even for several days at a time. I think she has more patients than I do at times and will spend days in the boat. Now her younger sisters are just the opposite and only last an hour at the most."
3660810,Wade B AKA: Ruger2506,2015-03-17 15:56:00,5533,Big difference between taking them locally or for a weekend camp trip near home vs. an 8 hour drive (or more) only to have a child not enjoy themselves. My boy fishes a ton but I guarantee you he isn't ready for a week in Canada. Not at 3.5 years old. Of course I have a cabin on the Canadian border so he gets Canada style experience almost weekly in the summer.We've talked about once we are Florida residents we'll have to plan a Canadian walleye trip for the boys. Not sure walleye will do it for them after they get used to grouper and tarpon.
3660938,Candianblueboy,2015-03-17 16:43:00,189,"I was taken all over with my dad when I could walk and wipe my own behind and I did that same thing with my 3 daughters. Now I have 2 red neck granddaughters who can fish all day rain or shine and help clean the catch and eat it when we hit shore, new grandson who I will have in the boat by end of summer for sure. Best times anywhere is when you spend it with youngsters and introduce them to the sport you love and they will never forget it. Get our younger generation to the outdoors and off the streets."

Renteda sattelite phone for a security blanket. He loves fishing and will sit Ina. Boat for 6 or 7 hours no problem. Perfect lake caught hundreds of walleye. Caretaker on the island we stayed. Boats were new with new motors. Going again next year. He would rather go on a fly in than go to Disney world."
3661234,jWN,2015-03-17 18:22:00,62,"The last day of school of my 6th grade year but this was no camping ground or resort. We headed to Reed lake Manitoba with the boat loaded with what was needed for a week in the bush. It was my dad his buddy and his son his 5th grade year last day. We took taters, beans, oil, fish breading, camping gear, fishiging gear, and a few eaxtras. We ran 8 or so miles out found an island and set up camp. It was almost all fishing after that with breacks to cook the basics. It was a repeat for 8 or so years after, then not sure what changed but we started taking more and more. It was still good just more convinunces along.Since then I have paid to fly in to a couple lodges, which was very nice and convenunte but as I think back the basic set up was the best. I am also not sure worring about if your kid can handel the trip should come in to play since I know the luxeries most have now days on trips. My dad had to fight me off for a couple year before he allwoed me to go and I vividly remember watching him adn his buddies excitment every sprig as they left to go north. After all this all I can say is it has changed when to take a kid biut if they have not been after you to take them call grandma."

The guys on the trip had all kinds of lures for him as presents, the outfitter's wife had a cake brought in by boat from Sioux Lookout ( she picked up his birthday by filling out his license - I've never brought up his birthday prior to the trip), the fellas had one of the 3' long Rapala display lures on their line as they trolled by our boat ( he got the lure back at camp that evening as a gift) and the kid won the first fish, biggest fish, most fish contest on almost every day. Like I said, lots of great memories Igot a lot of mileage out of celebrating his birthday in Canada....he was the perfect fishing partner that week. I was asking myself on occasion....""is this my child""??? Just a thought for others to consider. PjShorthorn"
3658466,bthomas3333,2015-03-17 07:00:00,465,I started taking my son at 9. He likes to fish and really enjoys the natural beauty of the Canadian wilderness. A bit off topic. How do you guys split shared costs when you have a kid along in the group. For our group it was air charter / food / bait / booze / gas and we just added everything up and divided by the total number in the group. Then I started to think this was sort of ridiculous because why would kids pay a full share of the booze / bait / etc.Am I being petty....Do you just pool all costs and split by the total number of guys (kids)?b-
3658530,johnboat,2015-03-17 07:12:00,2014,"When they are all grown up with lives of their own, with much less time to spend with you, let alone for one week straight, the last thing that will make you feel better about not taking them to Canada is that you saved time and money from bringing your whiney kids fishing for a week when they were small. Take them, hope the weather is good, and the fishing is steady. Just realize you are there for them. If you catch some, fine. But it is more important that they do. You might have a little more cabin time than you were hoping for, but who knows, those might be some of the memories you remember the most. It's funny how people just think kids can be whiney and moan all the time. I've been around some boats up there that had plenty of whining and moaning but didn't see any kids in the boat!!!!"
3658538,pjshorthorn,2015-03-17 07:15:00,5654,"The guys in my group were gracious enough to help absorb costs for food and gas on the drive up. I paid for his portion of the cabin rental, boat rental, minnows, etc. In subsequent years, we did the same when my son was able to make it. Our group was always family, and very close family friends, so that probably made the decison for everyone a little easier on what to do in our case. I normally bought dinner for the group on the way home as a way to say thank you for allowing a young man to be involved in their vacation. Personally, I would chip in a little to see another person's child have an awesome time on their first trip.Make's me feel good to see that enjoyment in a child. PjShorthorn"

I am still not sure how I have managed to talk the wife into feeding them in the boat while I fished. No fishing in the rain or if the water is too rough, but they love being in the boat and helping dad drive. Once and a while I even talk them into fishing."
3658674,SinOrSwim,2015-03-17 07:43:00,1528,"We all put X dollars in a kitty for all the stuff on the way up and back. Food, gas, duty on booze etc. We just have the guys that aren't as big of drinkers put in 50 less or something like that. I don't know the exact number. But, they don't take a ton of booze so not fair for them to pay duty. That way it's just a discount up front and it's done. I think about the only thing he would get a discount on would be the booze. Food is a nominal amount anyway. Bait, is probably equal. But, I guess it depends on how much booze is purchased? Does the outfitter give the kid a different price to add to the total? Then, you may need to split stuff out because that can be expensive."

They've all been going every year since. We just tailored the trip to fit kids when they were young - More swimming, games and play time and fishing when they were interested. Now the oldest is 13. Last year we spent 3 weeks in Canada Walleye and Musky fishing. Best partner I've ever had and almost as good an angler as I am. The girls also love the trip and wouldn't miss it for anything. They're getting more into the fishing each year. As long as you get the kids interested and excited when they're young, I believe they will take to it forever. Blair"

We couldn't afford that when I was a kid, but I can now, so I choose to do it. I marvel at the recollection of our discussions when I was a child, then a teenager, then a young man, and now middle aged, and how those conversations changed over the years, and how much the old boy has learned...... yah, right. I envy those of you that have the ability to make these kinds of choices, and wish that I could make them myself, because I know where the kids would be. In the boat with me. I do have a niece that hunts deer with me, and seeing her grow up, and expand her knowledge and now she's engaged to a fine young man, and it's nice to think I may have had some influence on her, and likely she on me as well."

We have gone north every year and have made at least two trips a year since 2006. Even at an early age, he was never a problem. If he got tired, he laid down with a life jacket for a pillow and slept for an hour or so. If he got bored, he played with the minnows or rearrange the tackle boxes while looking for a new sure fire lure. My only regret is that we waited so long for our first trip."

She is 7 now and absolutely loves it. We just got back yesterday from a trip in which she stayed up planning out her day while we drove up (left at 2am), and ended spending the whole day napping in the bottom of the boat. We found the fishing to be very slow, but she could only recall the time that we went up and caught next to nothing, and kept telling us how much better we were doing. She can get a little restless, but a lot of the best stories come from her recollections the trips and telling about her reactions to things that happened.Load them up and take them with you, before they decide the dont want to go."

Currently my son is 8 and my daughter is 10. My daughter likes fishing, but doesn't love it. I've never pushed it on either of them. My son is already crazy about it. He'll spend 12 hours in a boat with me now, fish hard and doesn't complain. Best part is he's already a darned good angler. It's harder when the kids are younger but the rewards are great. I may be the wrong person to ask, but imo it's never too early to bring your kids."

The primary considerations are how hardcore are you, how hardcore are they and how are you going to compromise to keep everyone happy. When mine were that young I would take the older one only if we would be fishing less than four hours. He was not an all day kid. The younger one was always more into it and at 9 I took him on a 5 day trip. It was made clear that this was a trip with adults, people who were using up vacation time, and we were going to fish a lot. If he got tired he could nap or take a break or bring something to entertain himself with but no whining. Of course, I brought plenty of snacks and drinks, binoculars, let him mess around with the sonar, made him official ""minnow grabber"" and he netted everything. A lot of his obsession now is probably innate and I can't take any credit for it except genetics. I do like to think that when it first started I helped nurture it into the chronic sickness it is today."

If they are going to whine and moan after 30 minutes in the boat I'd leave them home. You are there to enjoy the fishing. If they are willing to put in the time and enjoy it, I say go for it."

A few random thoughts that maybe contributed to a good trip - On the trip up, there were provisions for movies/xbox/etc. in the car for the long drive. We always have had a ""family friendly"" bunch of guys who enjoyed having our sons along. It was understood that we'd stay out on the water all day, far from camp. Always great action on the fish, that didn't hurt. We'd always go ashore for a shore lunch. Shore lunch might involve skipping stones, a swim, helping a little with lunch prep, and so on. We've always had a daily contest for big walleye and northern, with a couple other kickers in there. That adds interest. Somehow the kids have always done well at this, occasionally earning the title ""lucky little shXt."" The guys in the group have never been ""hard drinkers."" Guys would have a couple drinks or beers, but in my memory nobody has ever been in the bag. When my son was tired, he might take a snooze on the floor of the boat. This may still happen on a lazy afternoon.... Always plenty of clothes/raingear to stay warm and dry. The camp always made a big fuss over the youngsters - that didn't hurt a thing. For that matter, they make a big fuss over us too. We've come to regard many of the long term camp staff as good friends. Evenings might have a pool game, card games, backgammon, or all of those things. That's how it worked out for us. And along the way, we've acquired memories, stories, and friendships that will last a lifetime. One of the great joys in my life. John"

It was the best trip I ever had. There was the occasional, I want to go in but that was minor in comparison to the overall experience. I look back on the pictures from that trip and have some of the most special memories I will carry to my grave. My only regret, not taking him sooner........but that is pretty hard to judge.The biggest hurdle was convincing Momma that he was ready to spend a week in the woods.PjShorthorn."

I take them regularly on local lakes for bass and bluegill and they are both getting pretty decent with a regular spinning rod. My daughter is certainly capable of jigging for walleye on her own, but my son would still need some help. They are very very close to being ready for a big trip up North. I'm taking them to our cabin in upstate NY this year for a week long trip. I think next year will be Canada. I will start them with a drive-to lodge with full facilities and gradually work our way up to fly-ins."
3658426,SinOrSwim,2015-03-17 06:52:00,1528,"I have 3 boys. 9, 6 and 4. My 9 year old went on his first trip last year. I still think my 6 year old is too young. I dont' think he has the same understanding of what we are doing as my oldest. But, I suppose all that depends on the kid too. My 9 yo watches outdoor shows and alaska shows. My 6 year old has not shown that interest. I am taking two trips this year again so he can go. I have a couple problems with our ""guys"" trip. It's a little bit too ""adult"" for him I think. But, the bigger reason is we always go in September. We have for years. I just can't take him out of school for that long. And, I will never ask our whole group to change our dates just for this either. So, not sure how I will deal with that moving forward? For now, 2 trips is my answer. And, some lodges kids are free with paying adults. Some are discounted heavily depending on the age. And, some don't do anything at all."
