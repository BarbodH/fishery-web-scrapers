3803969,pike50plus,2015-04-23 17:38:00,584,costs in net dollars in either currency if the number means that much to you/ Just convert everything to either US or Canadian and compare if you only are looking at a numerical comparison.
3804065,Draco1206,2015-04-23 18:03:00,175,"Hey youngknight, I bumped up the post from a couple months ago. I happen to agree with you and I'm from Michigan. I personally would not patronize a business or company in Michigan or anywhere else in the states if they charged in a foreign currency, even if it was cheaper to do so. Just trying to save you and others ( especially the outfitters) the headache of re-hashing this subject again so soon. But I see that didn't work out so well."
3804361,Obabikon,2015-04-23 19:43:00,2370,"I pay some bills in Canadian, and most wages in Canadian. However, my mortgage is from a US investor, my sport show costs, and advertising expenses are all US bills. Basically, a resort needs to decide on their own what works best for them and their guests. There's no doubt to me about what is easiest for my guests and myself. US dollars are the way to go. I would never turn away Canadian dollars, and I'm happy to give someone an exact quote in Canadian dollars. However, that would affect less than 1% of the guests that have come to Obabikon in the past 9 years..."
3804369,Obabikon,2015-04-23 19:44:00,2370,I'd be happy to have you
3804849,jackmaloney,2015-04-23 21:48:00,9,"Every time this topic comes up, I'm confused why it is an issue at all. For most Canadian fishing resorts, 95%+ of their customers are American, so quoting in and accepting payment in US dollars is more convenient for the customer, period. If you prefer to pay in Canadian dollars for some reason, then I'm sure the resort owner would be happy to accept it. I don't see why it's worth discussing beyond that. Who cares about the financial implications as they relate to the resort owner, or how they compensate their employees, the exchange rate, etc.? I'm sure the resort owner knows their business. To me, that's akin to concerning yourself with the resort owner's overhead and profit margin. If you like the resort and the price they charge, then who cares about the type of currency it is in? If you like the price, then go to the resort. If you don't like the price, then don't go. But speculating about how the currency type and exchange rates affect the resort owner seems nuts to me. I live in Illinois. If a fishing resort opened up down the street from my house and quoted their prices in Canadian dollars, why would I care? If I was considering going there, I would figure out how much it would cost me in US dollars (which would take 30 seconds). If I liked the price, I'd go. If I didn't like the price, or just had some fundamental issue with the business quoting in foreign currency, I wouldn't go. But I definitely wouldn't spend my time trying to figure out why they quote prices in a different currency, and how that affects their profitability, business operations, etc."
3805041,alberta bum,2015-04-24 04:08:00,312,"Being a Canadian I hate it when I see this advertised.. That being said,, I've gone to several lodges that have advertised payment like this. I will say though when I contact these places I'm pretty straight up with what I'm looking for.. It usually goes like this,, I'm from so and so town, I'm looking for a place to stay for these particular days, for myself and girlfriend, we will be pulling our own boat in, we would like housekeeping or meal plan do you have anything available? If the answer to these questions is sure we have availability.. I then ask what the price is for a canadian in canadian funds. 90% of the time you get a reply that we will charge you the EXACT same dollar figure in either Canadian or American funds. If they add exchange I say no thank you and move on..a lot of these lodges if they have several available during that time frame, would rather fill them and make some revenue over leaving them empty and making nothing.Problem with alot of what you guys are talking about not getting Canadians in to the camps is plane and simple location... Would I love to fish northwestern ontario every year.. Yup no doubt about it.. But to drive there pulling a boat,, I'm looking at a minimum of 18 hours thru the states, with 2 border crossings each way, or almost 24 hours thru just thru ontario.. Your clientele is going to be almost 100% American. Now if a lodge in eastern Ontario tried to price in American funds where a good portion of their clientele is canadian,, they would lose a lot of business instantly.All this being said,, I'm coming from windsor, anyone have availability in July25- aug1 for myself and girlfriend? I want housekeeping,, your boat, and pricing in canadian funds. And yup I'm serious.. Pm me prices and dates of availiblilty."
3805337,MrSimon,2015-04-24 06:22:00,922,That sums this conversation up nicely .... and is an example of how a good lodge owner meets the needs of his majority client base while still working to accommodate the minority (and being willing to deal with some profit volatility in order to give a consistent experience to his guests).
3801793,MrSimon,2015-04-23 08:44:00,922,"Maybe I'm missing something, but isn't the entire point of an exchange rate that you can figure out how much of one currency equals the SAME VALUE as another? It doesn't matter how cost is posted or how the bill is paid ..... if the proper exchange rate is used, then guests paying in USD are paying the same VALUE as guests paying in CAD ... regardless of the numbers on the check. I can understand that a Canadian resident going to a lodge who posts prices in USD will FEEL like they are paying more, but in reality they aren't. The same way that a US customer will FEEL like they are getting a break by going somewhere that posts prices in CAD ... but they aren't."
3801889,v-bay gord,2015-04-23 09:09:00,3168,"Well, if last year the exchange was close to par.....then my US guests paying for the same package this season will end up paying about 20% less. That's real cash, and more than a FEEL. The same would be true for a Canadian attending a lodge with rates in US$.......it's costing them 20% more. The only person that gets to have the FEEL of paying the same rate is the US customer at a lodge charging in US dollars.........which I guess is the point of those charging US $."
3801913,Carnhzkr,2015-04-23 09:15:00,964,"I hesitate to add to this thread because this topic has been beaten to death on WC this year. In theory you're correct, paying in CAD or USD should equate to the same if the proper exchange rate is applied. However, lodges that charge in CAD are less expensive this year compared to their price the previous year, when paying in USD. For example, last year I went to a lodge that charged in CAD (caught the beauty pictured in my avatar there). They have not raised their prices this year, so I could get the same trip for about %15 less than I paid last year because I pay in USD."
3802641,MrSimon,2015-04-23 11:56:00,922,"You are talking about the change in exchange rates from year to year. That's a completely different point from what I was saying about the exchange rate making USD and CAD being worth the same at the time of purchase. To your point about exchange rates changing from year to year .... if a lodge keeps prices fixed (CAD or USD), then someone is certainly going to feel the impact of the change in exchange rates from year to year. Exactly WHO feels the impact (and in what direction) depends on what currency the lodge uses and on whether the CAD strengthens or weakens vs the USD during the year. There seem to be three options:Charge a fixed CAD fee - this means US guests will experience volatility in cost, Canadian guests will never see changes, and the lodge will have a consistent revenue stream.Charge a fixed USD fee - US guests will have consistent pricing, Canadian guests will see volatility in pricing, and the lodge will have inconsistent revenue streams from year to yearThe lodge can adjust their prices from year to year to keep things consistent. Each lodge has to decide how they want to do it. It's not surprising that to keep things consistent for their US guests, many lodges are willing to deal with inconsistent revenue streams as well as volatile prices for Canadian customers."
3802649,rwl,2015-04-23 11:59:00,1655,"I rent a house in Florida every year, many are priced in Euros, because that is where the owners live. I don't let it bother me."
3802713,Draco1206,2015-04-23 12:10:00,175,"Your logic works on the world banking stage but not with individuals. Depending on how an outfitter charges, USD or CAD, and when the individual booked the trip, they definitely will be paying more or less this year. As much as $200-$250. That's a pretty substantial amount. I'm pretty happy my outfitter charges in CAD and the dock hands and pilots will probably be happier also now that I have a little extra money to spend."
3803393,Draco1206,2015-04-23 15:02:00,175,Easy to say right now when the exchange rate for the Euro vs USD is only 7-8%. I don't think you'd be singing the same tune if it was 40% as it was a few years ago. That's an additional $400 on a $1000 rent vs $70-$80 you would be paying now. Big difference.
3803481,Obabikon,2015-04-23 15:29:00,2370,"Personally, my location prohibits Canadians from coming to visit. From Winnipeg, its 3 hours to Kenora... or 5 hours to us. We're 45minutes from the border, and there are no major cities close to us. The Canadian tourism is ZERO for us. No matter what we charge in. So... I will continue to be helpful towards my actual guests. If they ever feel they've been taken advantage of, then I'm sure they wouldnt' be back. But, we have a return rate of higher than 85%. Sure... this year the exchange rate improved. However, we have gotten our butts handed to us for the past 7 or 8 years. Between the exchange rate and the economy... Again, I'm not asking people to feel sorry for me. However, the imply that in some way shape or form, I am taking gross advantage of my guests? THAT UPSETS ME... that's what this topic is constantly about."
3803641,Mike Borger,2015-04-23 16:04:00,1554,I'll bet I could help with that.
3803785,youngknight,2015-04-23 16:59:00,228,"I am the OP of this and wanted to state that 1) I apologize for not seeing a lengthy post on this started back in January which someone bumped up, and 2) I had no intent to imply that lodge owners who do charge in US$ do so in any way to cheat or somehow pocket the difference. It is obvious that outfitters look at it differently. Seems strange that a company operating in Canada, paying its bills and wages in Canada, buying its supplies in Canada (hopefully) doesn't budget its prices accordingly for the currency in the country it operates in. That's all ...and it WOULD be nice to see more Canadians visit your establishments... I do hold the personal opinion that I personally find it bothersome that I have to basically change money to another countries currency in my own country. Without offending any lodge owners out there who charge in US$, that is simply how I feel...but am not suggesting that you are getting away with anything. Cheers all!"
3800369,youngknight,2015-04-22 23:02:00,228,"Have been browsing Cdn lodge sites and see most lodge owners, regardless of country of winter address, charge in Cdn dollars. However some price everything in American funds. Since the business is in Canada, as a Canadian i personally believe everything in this country should be priced in our own funds. Seldom has the Cdn dollar been higher than the U.S. Dollar, certainly not more than a few cents. Over the last few decades the vast majority of the time those lodges make pricing quite high for Canadians ...about 20% premium right now. Plus those lodges pricing in Cdn funds offer very attractive value to US customers ie take that $1,000 trip for $800...not so if pricing in us$...seems like a bit of a cash grab at worst...at best it is a bit insulting imo. So why price in U.S. Dollars? You never go anywhere in the states and have pricing in Cdn dollars, euros or yen...so why do this in Canada? When our cdn$ were very close pricing was pretty much the same at is now....is if last year or so a lodge owner charged $1,000 U.S. They got basically $1020 Cdn dollars. Now my price is $1225. Doesn't seem right."
3800441,Draco1206,2015-04-23 01:54:00,175,See previous thread I brought back to the top for you
3800465,Golden Eagle,2015-04-23 02:32:00,2642,Owners have taken a hit the past several years. Present exchange rate will help them recover so they can upgrade equipment and put a little $$$ away for themselves. An easy solution for you is to visit camps that charge Canadian funds. How many trips did you buy in 2014? Hopefully it works out in your favor.
3800673,Shellback,2015-04-23 05:06:00,8083,"Somewhat off topic, but I was in Canada over the weekend. At the Thousand Islands bridge, which is a joint venture between the US and Canada, the toll was $2.75 US and $3.00 Canadian. Getting screwed by your own country, that stinks! I guess if they kept it the same, they figured US folks would be using Canadian funds to save money."
3800937,SinOrSwim,2015-04-23 06:06:00,1528,I am not an owner but I would venture to guess some of it has to do with the ease and simplicity. So they do not have to spend countless hours explaining the how the conversion works. Just quote it in US funds and people know exactly what it will cost. You tell someone 1000 US funds and it is 1000 US funds. It has nothing to do with the exchange rate. If the rate fluctuates over the summer that persons trip he booked in January doesn't change when he makes full payment in July. The camp owner is taking that risk.
3800985,Obabikon,2015-04-23 06:11:00,2370,"We charge in US because 100% of our customers are US citizens. Its a convenience thing in my opinion. Some years I lose on exchange (like the last 3) and some years I will win. But, from the time my customers book their trip... they know EXACTLY what it will cost them. It won't be affected by a rising or dropping exchange rate."
3801121,youngknight,2015-04-23 06:44:00,228,"Fair enough, I can see how it effectively ""locks in"" a price so when final payment is due, the American customer knows exactly what it is out of his pocket. Even in the last 3 years though, Cdn dollar has been at par, a bit below are just a hair over. With a sagging Canadian dollar these lodges are priced out of our reach really, so yep, I will only go to a lodge that conducts their Canadian business in Canadian dollars. I think you can understand though that if an American had to pay in Japanese yen in their own country for a service that is mostly due to their own country's natural resources, because most of the company's business caters to Japanese, that Americans would likely not be very happy about that...especially if the American dollars sags compared to the yen. So, people from a foreign nation have a distinct and significant financial advantage over them in enjoying what the company offers. I do get the certainty of final payments though...however, most lodge owners seem to make it work. Anyhow, not bitter and there are lots of lodges, even foreign owned that charge in Canadian dollars and I am going with one of them this year....as I did last year."
3801193,Jwendt15,2015-04-23 06:52:00,72,"Over the last 25 years, there have been 3 years where the USD was weak against CAD. Even at that, it was only 5% at its worst. It has been up as much as 60% on the other side and currently close to 30. Hard to buy the sometimes I win, sometimes I lose argument. Outfitters have won big over time by charging USD. Not as big of a deal personally for me, but certainly a bummer for locals who want a great lodge in their own neck of the woods."
3801273,Obabikon,2015-04-23 07:08:00,2370,"Anytime it is under 15-20%... resorts that charge in US dollars are losing. Like I said in the previous thread, resorts that charge in US... do not have a business plan based around ""par"". They have a business plan based around (most likely) the 15 year AVERAGE. If I were to switch the form of payment (which the resort has been charging in since the 1950's)... I would add at least 15-20% to my prices. So... a $1000 trip would be at least $1,150 trip in Canadian. I view it like that. The past several years though, the exchange was worse than that. So, our bills were all higher, and we were making less money. That happens."
3801305,v-bay gord,2015-04-23 07:18:00,3168,"Interesting when a lot of conversation is about ""how to attract new clients to fishing lodges"" that a rate structure pretty much guarantees the elimination of any potential Canadian clients........unless they don't mind paying for a service in their own country in US $. Obviously the original poster has a problem with this, and I don't blame him at all."
