3481938,Ebarnett,2015-01-26 16:32:00,60,"Please forgive me for bringing up this touchy subject. It seems money always causes debate and im really trying to understand why some charge Canadian and others charge US dollars. It makes sense in my mind that owners would place the value of their trip on the canadian economy. Factors such as Canadian fuel for planes, boats, upgrades, price of building materials would all be based on the Canadian economy. What exactly does the US economy and dollar have to do with it? So for example, an owner counts the cost of an outpost and determines that a trip would cost $1500 CND per person to be profitable. When the Americans come up, they are still paying $1500 CND. The Canadians are also paying $1500 CND. Currently on a trip paying $1500 US you have valued the trip at $1860 CND. Again, not trying to get under anyones skin."
3482242,Shellback,2015-01-26 17:52:00,8083,Exchange fees! Banks make their money both ways. Kinda like lawyers getting a cut of the lawsuit proceeds. My wife used to get stock dividends paid in Euros by her French owned US employer. Exchange fees were almost the same amt. as the dividend. I try to use my credit card as much as possible as the fee is just 1%.
3482402,Obabikon,2015-01-26 18:20:00,2370,"I understand why the conversation is brought up. When nearly 100% of your business is US citizens though, the US economy and dollar has a lot to do with it. Like I mentioned, a guest who is expecting to pay $1500 when he books the trip, but ends up having to pay $1700 because of the exchange rate... won't be too happy. Also, since most of my guests cross on Saturdays and Sundays... banks are not open. It would be inconvenient to obtain Canadian money. So, for convenience and to avoid unexpected expenses... we charge in US funds. The resort has charged in US funds for more than 50 years. Some years, the exchange rate helps, other years it hurts..."
3482490,WalleyeMatt,2015-01-26 18:47:00,93,I for one would never do a job knowing I was going to lose money unless it was a donation. Resort owners and outfitters are a business. I would expect them to make a good profit on the service they provide. I expect nothing for free or given to me at a cut rate just because. The only thing I expect to be given is good service and good fishing. When opportunity is offered take it and I wish all the resort owners and outfitters a profitable summer. Matt
3482650,Ebarnett,2015-01-26 19:31:00,60,"All good points. I for one am glad the outfitters are there and hope they do well. It's nice to hear their perspective on things. I would think because of the exchange, the ones who charge in Canadian Dollars would also do well in that they should be booked up with the lower pricing. Half one way half the other I supose."
3482714,3M TA3,2015-01-26 19:50:00,2846,"I don't really understand this post. If any person thinks the person they're doing business with is screwing them over, why would they do business with them in the first place. So what if the value of one dollar is different than another. If you think you're getting screwed, you're getting screwed. Go elsewhere."
3482770,Fisherman Ted,2015-01-26 20:14:00,461,"Exchange fees are what they are and you can't do anything about them. We deal with them no matter what currency we receive as we have expenses in both currencies. If I collected in Canadian funds I still would have fees to pay my US expenses and myself. It doesn't matter, really doesn't. Plus, speaking for myself but knowing my fellow colleagues if we were losing so much on exchange fees either our rates would be adjusted or we would do it differently. 100% of my clients are US. It makes it much easier to quote them one price, one that will not change etc. If I quoted in Canadian funds it WOULDN'T MATTER as I am getting PAID IN US dollars. There is going to be an exchange transaction anyway you look at it."
3482810,Ebarnett,2015-01-26 20:24:00,60,"gosh no, not my intent at all. Was hoping to understand why some outfitters charge US and others CAD. newbie asking what seems to be a Taboo question, thats all."
3483202,Mike Borger,2015-01-27 05:50:00,1554,The bottom line is the clientele. I deal directly with an enormous number of outfitters. The ones who have primarily Canadian customers post their prices in Canadian funds and vice-versa for all the reasons mentioned.The guys who cater mostly to Canadians (somewhat rare) risk alienating the bulk of their clientele by charging rates in US funds. I have several clients who have refused to book with an outfiitter because of the US rates.
3483394,SinOrSwim,2015-01-27 06:48:00,1528,"I wouldn't have any desire to pay in Canadian funds. Maybe I'm off base but that means, A-I would have to exchange a bunch of money into Canadian funds. Meaning, our group would have A LOT of cash that could get lost or stolen. I wouldn't have any desire to have thousands of dollars in cash sitting in the cabin. Plus, we dont' always know our bill when we factor in gas, bait etc. Especially on our fly-ins. If we pay in American we can write a check or use a credit card. Granted, most of them don't do credit cards because of those silly fees either but we can at least write a check."
3480874,Ebarnett,2015-01-26 12:16:00,60,"So in researching many outfitters, ive noticed that the majority of outfitters quote in US dollars. But im not sure why? Currently the exchange as of today (1/26/2015) is $1.00 US to $1.24 CND. So if prices are the same as they were when the exchange was close to equal, then currently the US customers are paying the same (not really true as the US dollar is surging thus US customers are paying more as well), but the poor Canadian anglers are being sent to the cleaners. Anyway...my question, since the business is ran in Canada, why wouldnt they be priced in Canadian funds? Newbie here, and I know a lot of outfitter Owners are on this board and could probably give some insight?"
3480970,Enid Elizabeth,2015-01-26 12:32:00,59,Hi. I am an outfitter in Red Lake Ontario. Fishing guests normally come from south of the outfitter so 98% of our customers are from the U.S. Back in 1978 we charged in Canadian $. Our customers would often book a spring trip in the fall and not know the cost because of the exchange. Also in the US it is hard to come by CAD $ at their local banks. Here we can easily exchange from US to CADTherefore we decided to charge in US $ and take the exchange risk ourselves. It worked just fine until the quick drop in the rate a few years ago. That change made a huge difference and possibly led to a few camps closing. The increase now is welcome but us operators will be cautious about the future rates. For Canadian customers you will find operators adjusting the rate for their very welcome Canadian fishermen now that the difference is significant. Boy. That was a long post. Probably more than you counted on ðŸ˜ŠSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
3481114,v-bay gord,2015-01-26 13:23:00,3168,"Well, I too am an outfitter on Eagle Lake, and my rates are in Canadian dollars. My question to outfitters that charge in U.S. $ and claim to give their Canadian customers a ""break"" is this: Would you give your U.S. customer the same break if they asked to pay in Canadian $?"
3481162,Golden Eagle,2015-01-26 13:26:00,2642,"Camp owners have been squeezed beginning in 2008 and most deserve any bump they might be in line to receive in 2015. Many need to upgrade their equipment, which will eventually help their guests. Flying costs seem to be at an all time high, as with pay for employees, when they can be found. Red Lake is practically a boom town, with the huge increase in mining operations. Cost of living is super high, as with the cost of doing business. I won't be pencil whipping any owner I'm dealing with in 2015. I've never been cheated."
3481258,Enid Elizabeth,2015-01-26 14:00:00,59,"The important thing is to give a customer a rate in the currency of their choice when they book and then stick to it so that he knows the cost when he books. As an outfitter we are taking that risk, sometimes good sometimes not at all. When the exchange rate is close to par, the price is just left at the same for CAD or US. When the exchange is higher, and you convert to CAD using the Bank of Canada rate, the price goes up. However we pay a good cost to exchange money so if someone brings CAD we are happy to accept it at a lower conversion rate whether the customer is US or CAD."
3481634,Ebarnett,2015-01-26 15:24:00,60,"Sorry the whole exchange thing complicates this. I'm a business owner in US and pay all overhead, employees, etc. in US dollars. I'm guessing Canada business owners do the same. Keep their books, pay employees, pay for overhead in Canadian dollars. Wouldn't it be easier to know your bottom line, know your margin of profitability in Canadian Funds? Charge what you need to be profitable. Isn't that number easier to determine in Canadian dollars? Not trying to ruffle any feathers... Trying to understand the underlying reason things are in US dollars."
3481746,Fisherman Ted,2015-01-26 15:54:00,461,"Not really. It is pretty simple to convert any currency into your Canadian books. Many methods to doing so. I just use a rolling average during the time period I am open. Also, there is always going to be an issue with multiple currencies. Many of the marketing dollars spent are in US funds, shows, some supplies etc. Its never 100% of anything so this is just the cost of doing business. One other point, many lodges in Canada are owned by Americans (myself included). By accepting in US funds when I finally pay myself I can do so in USD with NO exchange fees. That small percentage adds up and helps a lot in a business that has low margins to begin with. Also, nearly all of my expenses in the off-season are in USD."
3481786,Obabikon,2015-01-26 16:08:00,2370,"I dislike this topic, as it always pops up when the US dollar is strong, but nobody complains when outfitters end up paying more. When the exchange rate was dropping, and resorts weren't raising prices... the resorts were taking that loss. Now that its going the other way, many people are critical. Many places (us included) have held their American prices the same over the past 3-4 years. Food costs went up, fuel prices went up, and exchange rates went down. That was several years of BAD economy. It swings the other way, and we still aren't raising prices. I can't speak for all resorts, but our guests are nearly 100% U.S. citizens (I believe we have had one Canadian family in the past 4 years). We charge in US funds so that our guests know exactly what they owe, prior to their trip. If by summer the price of oil returns, and the Canadian dollar rebounds... we eat that. I couldn't imagine telling a guest in January that his trip will cost $1000, and then ask him for $1200 when his trip ends. I just don't like that idea. If our resort was charging in Canadian dollars, we would charge more to reflect the exchange rate... probably around 15% higher. This year charging in Canadian looks like it would cost us... last year charging in Canadian would have been more profitable. The business is NOT revolved around par. It is more work to charge in US dollars. Its a service to our guests. I can see people being critical of camps that have jumped back and forth. However, that isn't the case in most instances. Just because one camp charges in US and another charges in Canadian... doesn't mean that one resort is raking in the cash, and the other one isn't."
3481794,Obabikon,2015-01-26 16:10:00,2370,"I agree with what Ted said. It isn't like camp owners are doing their books based on ""par"", and then pocket the difference. That isn't what happens, and it isn't how it works."
3481802,port1042,2015-01-26 16:10:00,509,"I personally like having the rate quoted in US funds. It's easier for me to understand what my cost will be. Just be sure your up-front about it when quoting rates. My lodge quotes in US funds and that's fine. I'm pretty sure there was no expectation that the exchange rate would move as far as it did when this years rates were set. But then, I not going until the end the May and again in September. A lot can happen between now and then, yet I know what my cost will be."
