3778425,Guest,2015-04-17 16:57:00,0,fellow fishermen has anyone fished this resort lately price seems right would bring our own boat out of Chicago probably going for week in july fishing 65% walleyes 35% northerns can you realistically catch 25 walleyes per man /day we fish hard 10 hr days do housekeeping any comments or suggestions would be appreciated jim wolf Chicago boys

If this is per day, I would be definitely looking elsewheres.Cannot always go by the lowest price. You get what you pay for.Have never heard of this place but if you do go have a great trip. Ontario is a Beautiful place."

Lots of walleyes there and lots and I mean lots of logs and dying trees, If you like to troll you will lose a lot of lures. Jigging or bobbers over leeches is the way to go. The pike are on the small and skinny side. In my opinion it's a much better walleye lake(s) than pike lake.Cabins are so so, depends what you need. All we cared was everything worked and it did."
3779489,Guest,2015-04-18 04:54:00,0,fellows thanks for the input minnow could you recommend a better resort in the general area good for walleyes but also like some bigger northerns we do housekeeping and bring our own boat willing to pay more based on your recommendation thanks jim wolf Chicago boys

IMO they are ok but there's better lakes around there.My 1st choice would be Ray's Camp on Ramsey Lake, fly in quality walleye fishing. If you want to bring your own boat, Grey Owl or Ritchies End of Trail on Biscotasing Lake are better than the other options. I've fished them all but still just my opinion.oh yeah, I don't know if this is a factor for you, but Golden Route is close to a busy hiway, not cool for the vibe of being up in the Canadian bush."
3781825,chris.brock,2015-04-18 20:05:00,112,The Nakina area is better than the Wawa/ Chapleau area
