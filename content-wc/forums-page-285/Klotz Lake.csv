2393297,Hike'n'Fish,2014-01-28 08:37:00,23,"Thanks again guys, The train ride place looks cool, but probably too much travel time for what we have allotted for the trip. I do appreciate the advice though. Pasha lake cabins looks cool, but it seems most of the fishing are on drive to lakes? If so, maybe not the worst thing? Kenogomisis looks interesting as well. I suppose seeing the prices at Klotz got me fired up along with the fact that it's farther north than we are used too as well. Still going to consider it as there are many drive in lakes in that area too. Still open to other suggestions to some good drive in places coming in from the Sault. Thanks again all! Marcus"
3088569,Hike'n'Fish,2014-08-14 08:45:00,23,"Well... we just got back from Klotz, and I was pretty happy with the results. For the price it was definitely worth it. Caught a lot of nice walleye, tons of pike (very aggressive fish) and a decent number of perch. We knew going in it wasn't going to be very ""remote"" but that wasn't a big deal. We saw no jetskis and only fished by another boat a few times, and they were a group of guys that were staying in our lodge who were very cool! I'd go back in a heartbeat especially to try some of the other lakes. For someone on a budget, it's definitely worth the trip in my book! Mike was a very nice and helpful guy, and it was cool to check out that part of Ontario. We will be heading back to Dog Lake again for a couple of years, and then probably do a fly in somewhere just to keep the new experiences coming. Thinking about lake Nagagami, but we'd love to find a fly in or drive in where you could wallye/pike fish and also brook trout fish as well in August. Probably tough, but we have a few years! Take care, Marcus"
3089649,MrSimon,2014-08-14 13:18:00,922,"Sounds like you had a good time. That's awesome! Any chance you have some pics of the camp, lake, and maybe Mike. Its been 20 years since I was up there and I'd love to see how it looks now. My earliest and best Canada memories are from Klotz."
3107945,erieangler,2014-08-20 11:41:00,57,Glad to hear your trip to Klotz was good Marcus. We have been fishing there for the past 23 years during opening week.we always stay at Flint wilderness resort on the west end of the lake. Flint lake and about 10 drive to remote lakes is what keeps us going back. You can get a remote experience at a very affordable price so long as you are up for a bit of an adventure
3127873,Moosebunk,2014-08-27 07:31:00,211,"Hadn't ever heard anything really decent about Klotz itself but, as it's been said here there are lakes in that area which fish quite well. It's all up to angler motivation that decides one's outcomes in that area."
3780689,Guest,2015-04-18 13:12:00,0,There is lots of Great fishing lakes in the Greestone area. You guys should definitely check out Lukinto Lake Lodge. Danny and Linda are Great host and work there butts off for there customers.
3782001,Live to jig,2015-04-18 20:49:00,159,http://www.osullivansrainbow.com/ This is what your looking for and not a whole lot farther but you will think you are on a fly-in lake...Tough to find an opening but worth it...going up twice this year.
2387289,Hike'n'Fish,2014-01-26 18:28:00,23,"Hey guys, For years my Dad and I have fished Dog Lake in Missanabie and we enjoy that trip, but we are thinking about trying a new place and came across Klotz lake. It's affordable for us, and seems like it would give us some pretty decent fishing. I'm wondering if anyone has fished there and if so what they thought of the area. I did a search on here and only turned up a pretty old thread. We are also interested in some Brook Trout fishing and this area looks like a great place for that as well. The final question is how easy or difficult it is to take a boat into the rapids and into Flint Lake north of Klotz lake? Seems like a really good pike lake up there based on what I read. Anyways, I really appreciate any help you can offer. Take care, Marcus"
2389009,MrSimon,2014-01-27 09:56:00,922,"I've been to Klotz many times, but not in the past 10 years. It does have some good fishing and I caught my biggest pike ever there. But, it is located right on the main highway and gets a LOT of pressure. There are also quite a few private cottages and camps on the lake now ..... so it definitely does not have a remote feeling to it. Water skiers and jet skis are common in the summer. Flint is a whole different ball game. It is very remote and does have very good pike fishing. I've run the river a handful of times and depending on water level, it can be really tough. We had to let boats down through rapids using ropes and things like that. Coming back up through the rapids is another adventure. I would NEVER take my own boat down that river. One fantastic thing about the area are the bush lakes. If you have a 4x4 and a sturdy trailer, you can get back into some great lakes. It is quite an adventure though. Here are some really old pics."
2391697,Hike'n'Fish,2014-01-27 18:50:00,23,"Thank you very much for the reply! Helps me a lot! We do have a 4x4 and a 16 foot boat. Sounds like the trek up to Flint lake is a bit risky! I'm torn as to whether or not the extra 4 hour drive is really worth it if it's quite busy as you say. It does make sense since it's right off of the highway. I like the idea of the bush lakes and we'd love to try for some brookies too. I'll let you know what we decide. Really cool pictures by the way! Thanks, Marcus"
2391857,Mike Borger,2014-01-27 19:13:00,1554,"Have driven by Klotz countless times but have never fished it and have never heard anything really good said about it either.If you drive a little further down the highway you'll cross Kenogamisis lake, and I have heard good things about that one.The travel editor of the magazine I write for did a piece on it 3-4 years ago and he raved about the fishing.MacLeod Provincial Park is right off the hwy on Kenogamisis and seems very nice.Also you may want to consider Pasha Lake Cabins near Jellicoe as an alternative to Klotz lake. There's plenty of info on Pasha Lake in the archives here if you do a search."
2391937,123chadder,2014-01-27 19:33:00,429,"a friend of mine used to stay at klotz lake cabins when he hunted for moose,but never fished the lake,but he said the owner said the fishing was excellent."
2391953,Pikeslayer8,2014-01-27 19:37:00,1460,"Yea Marcus, I gotta agree with Solopaddler here. I don't know jack about the fishing east of Nipigon, but Mike sure does. But I know that if I'm going that far, and there is any potential for water skiers and jet skies, big mistake."
2392017,Mike Borger,2014-01-27 19:46:00,1554,"Also it's worth mentioning, if you're considering Klotz Lake Camp are you aware that it's on the other side of hwy 11? You have to cross the highway to get to the lake..."
2392393,Pikeslayer8,2014-01-27 21:10:00,1460,"Marcus, You might not like this idea as you would have to leave the boat at home but talk about an adventure. If I lived in Michigan or Eastern Ontario, this is what I'd do. http://www.flindtlandingcamp.com/cabins.html From the website: If you drive through Michigan and cross the border at Sault Ste. Marie, take Highway 17 along Lake Superior to White River where Highway 631 goes north to Hornepayne. The train ride from Hornepayne to camp is six hours."
2392569,Mike Borger,2014-01-28 03:59:00,1554,"Good idea!All the whistle stops between Armstrong and Savant Lake have great fishing, I'm sure Flindt Landing is the same.I've boarded the train a couple of times with my canoe and gear and had them drop me off along the tracks. Once at Allanwater Bridge, another time at Onamakawash Lake. Both were great trips."
2393081,MrSimon,2014-01-28 07:48:00,922,"One other thing about Flint Lake .... it has a LOT of shallow rocks .... you know, the big flat kind that sit just under the surface. Prop destroyers! If you go down the river, I'd make sure to take an extra prop with you. Even though I have a TON of very fond memories from Klotz and Flint .... I'd honestly have to say there are much better places to go."
