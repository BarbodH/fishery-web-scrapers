1495593,blackxpress,2012-10-15 06:22:00,70,"Three of us spent a week there back in June. We loved it. The fishing was fantastic. There are 3 large lakes connected together. The lodge is on Sideburned lake. We never even saw all of Sideburned because the fishing was so good there was no need to cover that much water. It's mostly Northern, Walleye and Perch. The only negative, if you can call it that, is that the place is infested with northerns. We lost count but we figure the 3 of us released over 250 large northerns in a week's time after catching our limit early each day. We reached the point where we were trying not to catch pike. At one point I was jigging for perch with a minnow on a Mr. Crappie hook on 6 lb. test and caught a 26"" northern. Just before I dropped that hook over the side I said, ""I know this won't catch a pike."" I hardly got the words out of my mouth and whammo! We found trolling to be the most effective method for walleye and perch. Probably the best fish of the week was a 16"" perch I caught trolling a #5 X-rap. We had so much fun we are making preparations to go back the same week next year. Dick and Kathy are great people and they go out of their way to make it a good experience. The accomodations are a little spartan but that's O.K. It is a fish camp after all. We've been in touch with them recently and they do plan to be open next season although they are struggling. Business has been slow because of the economy. I would highly recommend the place and will be severely disappointed if we don't get to go back."

For many years we have gone to places where we fish different lakes every day and portage in and out daily. Lots of work so we were looking to find a place where we park the trucks on arrival and not move them again til we load up to go home. We caught some nice size fish doing this but ready for something else

Awaiting a report as I have fished that area of Ontario and have had coffee at their restaurant, though never fished their lakes. Faith, Family, Friends......and fishing, Rich B"
