They have some good looking camps and I would love to use them, but trying to get some references other than the ""canned"" ones you usually get from the owners themselves. Appreciate anything you guys can tell me. This is my first post on here. When it comes to these fancy electronic gadgets, I'm not a wizard. I'm more of a lizard. Thanx for your time......"
3794185,Mike Borger,2015-04-21 17:00:00,1554,I've heard nothing but good things. Which lake are you interested in?
3794265,sportman,2015-04-21 17:14:00,3,Looking at what they call Trapper's Run on the Ogiki River. Curious if they are new ownership recently. Where do you usually go? I've fished more north of Wawa and Chapleau but went out of Nakina once about 5 yrs ago..... Great trip
3794393,Mike Borger,2015-04-21 17:39:00,1554,I've never fished with Twin Lakes but I'm familiar with some of their lakes and have heard they run a good operation. Don't know anyone who has fished trapper's run but I expect it has the potential to be good. Bear in mind it is a river system and depending on water levels it could be great or terrible. I'd ask the outfitter some pointed questions about how navigable the system is season to season. With a few notable exceptions many camps situated on rivers only fish really well the first month of the season. If no one else chimes in I'm quite sure Twin Lakes can provide you with references to contact.
3794449,sportman,2015-04-21 17:49:00,3,Many thanx. I look forward to further planning as usual. Glad you answered me. Good fishing to you !
3794929,chris.brock,2015-04-21 19:13:00,112,"I have no experience with Twin Lakes. I have fished the Ogoki River east of Trappers Run, I came up from Ogoki Lake, I've looked at the map and know what water is available at the Trapper's Run camp, I would pick a different Twin Lakes outpost. The river up there was weird, the shore dropped off quick into 30 FOW with no structure or cover, it's hard to explain but there was no obvious fish spots, just a soft bottom of nothing and we only really caught fish below a rapid. Why did Trapper's Run catch your eye?"
3796169,Michigan Man,2015-04-22 06:50:00,9,We had a great experience with Twin Lakes. We went to their Kag Lake outpost. Have also been to their Sim Lake outpost.
3799569,Curryale,2015-04-22 18:57:00,50,We fished Jessiman Lake a few years ago. Very nice people and excellent fishing. I would recommend them. I was left with the impression that a handful of their camps are fairly busy and the remainder more or less dormant. We flew into Jessiman in late July and were the first group all year.
