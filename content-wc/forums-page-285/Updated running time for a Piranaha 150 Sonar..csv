3785297,polaris-pete,2015-04-19 20:16:00,343,I just did a total running time for my Humminbird for our Fly-in trip. The original post was for using a compact solar panel charger.Thanks to all for the help.This mod helped save a lot of weight for the trip by eliminating the original heavy 12 volt battery.
