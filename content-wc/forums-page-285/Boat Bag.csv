3811529,dutchboy,2015-04-26 06:42:00,5717,That should go without saying!!!
3811721,forgop,2015-04-26 07:17:00,880,"I'm thinking with bags like this, you'd use your entire weight allowance with just your boat bag on a fly-in trip."
3811873,Aspencreek,2015-04-26 07:54:00,2911,"Yup....a bigger bag, a much bigger bag. In fact so big, your going to need a bigger boat."
3810825,Knoxabilly,2015-04-25 20:33:00,225,"I'm setting up a boat bag- so far I have a first aid kit, wet wipes, lighter, super glue and a head lamp in it. What is in your boat bag?"
3810873,LOW1,2015-04-25 20:39:00,2828,Bug spray. Fire starting stuff. Rescue blankets. A basic tarp and rope. Leatherman. A portable gps with map chip.
3810889,Aspencreek,2015-04-25 20:45:00,2911,"a pair of gloves, stocking cap, wool socks, whistle, and rubber slip over boots, along with most of the stuff already listed. I have not spent the night on an island yet, but when the time comes...and it probably will...."
3810897,dutchboy,2015-04-25 20:46:00,5717,"A lighter is nice but you need the rest of the fixings for a fire. Tarp and a strobe light if you are going to be on the water with nobody looking for you. Depends on how carried away you want to get. You could have some food and water, toilet paper for a overnight on a island stay."
3810921,Aspencreek,2015-04-25 20:53:00,2911,"Toilet paper !!! Not any more, wet wipes or diaper wipes, that's the way to go. They come in a resealable container, you don't have to worry about them getting wet, they last for years in the container, and you can clean your hands, face, etc. If it's good enough for an infant, it will certainly work for you and me. And they burn HOT too!"
3810969,clearis,2015-04-25 21:10:00,47,"I'm 99% catch and release and don't carry a fillet knife in the tackle bag. There's a Mora knife in the boat bag (don't care much for survival knives). Leatherman's usually have a small knife, but having a good fixed blade knife is a must."
3810985,forgop,2015-04-25 21:14:00,880,I'd add: Sunscreen Bug spray Rain gear Rope
3811009,SinOrSwim,2015-04-25 21:19:00,1528,You're gonna need a bigger bag!!!!!!!! LOL Tent Camping chairs maybe one of those tripods to hang a pot A pot if you have a tripod to hang the pot maybe some of those sticks to roast some marshmallows???? Sat phone to call some friends?????
3811105,Knoxabilly,2015-04-25 22:11:00,225,Hahahaha I wanna get stranded with that much gear!
