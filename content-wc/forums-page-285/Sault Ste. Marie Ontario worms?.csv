However, I will be coming from southern Ontario to Wawa/White River area through Sault Ste. Marie Ontario, staying a nite in the Soo. Would be handy to buy worms there...anybody know of a substantial bait dealer in the Soo? There is just the two of us so don't need a flat or even half a flat but probably 24 dozen or so.Thanks in advance for any ideas."
3778473,halfmoon007,2015-04-17 17:31:00,121,its at 1332 great northern rd. thats on the north edge of town on your way out of the soo heading to wawa. we call ahead and order a flat. but i think they carry a pretty good stock. very popular spot for us fisherman to stop.happy hook-in...halfmoon

3778569,Crede,2015-04-17 17:57:00,134,Agree with this. The Trading Post. Call ahead. Simple/reliable.
3779161,youngknight,2015-04-17 21:26:00,228,"Thanks guys. That will be close to my overbite stop. I thought half a flat was 500 worms...actually that may be too many. Minnows available at camp,and I want to use some crank baits and spend some time chasing pike. Might set out a trap for leeches but don't want to count on that."
3785249,Algoma Guy,2015-04-19 20:08:00,48,Ron's Live Bait in Heyden. Its just past trading post. Way cheaper and better product. He's the only one I deal with. Ron Folz 705-256-1063
3785329,forgop,2015-04-19 20:19:00,880,This is where I got a flat last summer: http://www.youngsgeneralstore.com/ It's on the south end of Wawa before you get into town and it was either $70 or $90 CDN and you can get your license there too. It's also nice that you can email your request well in advance just to have a flat on hand for you when you arrive. They have all kind of candy and a good assortment of fudge IIRC.
3785793,adempsey,2015-04-19 21:37:00,963,"Picked up a flat of worms from the Trading Post on Great Northern Road on two occasions. Worked just fine for me. I chose them because of it's location, no other reason. I pre-ordered them both times. I'll consider the guy in Heyden if he's cheaper next time I go that route [just to save some $, no other reason]. A flat is ~500 worms."
