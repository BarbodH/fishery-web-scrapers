Plan was to see if the smelt were running up the creek yet and to send minnows and imitation spawn drifting under a slip bobber in the current to get whitefish pike, and hopefully a laker or two. Plans came to an abrupt end when I got to the mouth of the creek to find hardly any open water and the water that was there was unfishable due to depth and/or access. The ice that was there was very sketchy and won't take long to go once we get over this week's midweek cold snap, ice will be long gone by walleye opener. Was a nice walk for an hour with the dog, and Roloff got to go swimming .you know that aint gonna warm your gonads! We saw a rabbit and a pike swimming up the creek, Roloff went in after it ..he skunked too!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpZUD7aGy54"

Our shore line is really low, unless it rains hard and often they better shut the dam at the mill our Wabigoon will be empty by August! Well, maybe not empty, but as you say thee water is looooow! This midweek coldsnap licks too, but I'm still pretty confident the ice will be gone by the end of the first week of May .but the temps are definitely gonna set us back a bit."
