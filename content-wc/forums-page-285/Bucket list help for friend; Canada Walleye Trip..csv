3753402,John N,2015-04-10 18:18:00,362,"I'll second Fred G. Couldn't go wrong with Old Post Lodge, Lake St. Joseph in NW Ontario. Pretty cushy camp, superb walleye and northern fishing. Been going there for many years. Excellent camp staff.www.oldpostlodge.comJohn"
3753538,John N,2015-04-10 18:58:00,362,"A little more on the Old Post. The camp boats are very good, although several of us have brought our own boats for many years. You can drive to within about three miles of the camp, then you boat over to the camp. A launch will meet you at the boat ramp, ferry all your gear over, and staff will carry it up to your cabin.This is remote, and as thinly fished as a fly-in - very rare to see any boats on the lake other than from this camp. The fishery is a little over 150,000 acres, and I'd recommend you use one of the camp's guides. They'll put your group on fish right away, they know the lake and its navigational hazards, and they'll prepare an excellent shore lunch. John"
3784961,Jigger1,2015-04-19 19:12:00,234,"I'm a long term guest of SWWL, but if you want first class quality walleye fishery there's perhaps only a handful of destinations that could match what Silver Water Wheel Lodge delivers each and every day. In my opinion, Lac Suel is one of the best walleye fisheries on the planet and SWWL is undoubtedly one of the best in Canada."
3785833,walleyestalker,2015-04-19 22:10:00,9,I can tell you it doesn't get much better than Lac seul. I've been going for ten plus years and my brother over 20 and if you can hold a pole over the side of the boat and jig you'll catch between 40 and 80 walleyes a day. I stay on the east side at Ojibwa outfitters and love it. We took a friend about 6 years ago in the same tough position as your friend and he loved it. You'll catch more walleyes in two hours off their dock than most people do in a lifetime. If I can help you in any way please let me know my personal email is [email protected].
3786097,Obabikon,2015-04-20 05:51:00,2370,"Where ever you go... ask the lodge who their best guide is, and book him the ENTIRE time. A good guide can turn a good trip into the best trip you can imagine!"
3787065,tigerwoods,2015-04-20 09:37:00,2,I have ran the lodge for the last 6 years........probably the best fishing I have ever experienced...........Jason Mitchell figured so as wellCheck it outhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gS3nkfeEKLU

3745634,adempsey,2015-04-08 18:59:00,963,"Personally, my choice for a Walleye fishing ""bucket list"" trip would be something more private and intimate.A fly-in outpost on a reasonably large lake or major watershed river that you have to yourself.I already have a huge list and would just pick from that.I'd check out the outposts from:Amik OutpostsBig Hook Wilderness CampsExcellent AdventuresHalley's CampsHidden Bay LodgeHowey Bay ResortNestor Falls Fly-In OutpostsPipestone Fly-In OutpostsShowalter's Fly-In OutpostsSlate Falls OutpostsJust to name a few, lol Probably doesn't help much.For lodges, I'd hit Manitoba or Saskatchewan. There are many legendary fishing lodges in those two provinces."
3745658,stillangling,2015-04-08 19:02:00,149,I can't spend a week on it but I would be more than happy to take them out for a day on Lake of the Woods. Walleye and muskies. Shoot me a personal message. I could give them some suggestions for places to stay. Once I got them on to fish it would be easy to spend a few days fishing the same spots in their own boat.
3745674,triple t,2015-04-08 19:09:00,55,If I only had one lake to fish in canada it is a definitely Gunesao in Manitoba. I've fished it four different times and every time was better than the previous. You'll catch hundreds of Walleyes and more than likely a trophy of a lifetime. Trip of a lifetime for sure Gunesao
3746250,Marden88,2015-04-08 21:31:00,17,"Winefred lake in Northern Alberta is quite the trip as well. Really nice lodge and the only one on the entire lake. It was registered as a trophy lake for years. Northern pike in the 20-30lb range very frequently and walleye in the 10-15lb range. I try to spend one week every year here. I am from Ontario and have fished some of the beautiful waters back there as well, any of the mentioned waters are a very good choice."
3746714,Stu,2015-04-09 06:53:00,472,"My prayers are with your friend. If they want to drive; there are too many choices to mention, but you can't go wrong with Lac Seul and Silver Water Wheel is at the top of the list (although I have never stayed there, but it comes highly recommended). I do agree with Triple T, Budd's Gunisao Lake Lodge is on my bucket list and I don't think you'll find a better fisher anywhere in Canada. It's very pricey though (a 7-day trip is $4295) and it's a fly-in lodge. It sounds like he has a pretty good support group and that makes all the difference. Wherever they go, I'm sure spending time with those who love you is more important than anything else. Good luck Â– Stu"
3747490,HeHooksHimself,2015-04-09 09:05:00,725,"This is where we go every spring. I have had many epic experiences in this system. Here is a short (9 min.) compilation of still pictures of our trip in 2012. We had a group of 8 including a couple rookies. Everyone caught trophies and we still recall this trip fondly. We were fortunate to have one of the rookies that was into photography make sure he always had a camera. Whatever you choose, I am sure it will indeed be epic! Fish On!

3748394,adempsey,2015-04-09 12:25:00,963,"Very nice place. Rates are very reasonable too. It's funny, I watched that video before and it was the music track that made me remember watching it."
3748562,HeHooksHimself,2015-04-09 12:51:00,725,"My fishing buddy Doc is famous for the Sittin on the Dock of the Bay song. A week in the boat with him and you will hear that song hundreds of times, complete with the whistling. That's why I call him Doc on WC. It was an epic trip, like most of them. I can honestly say I have never had a bad day there. Oh, we have battled the elephants (elements) a few times and been beat down by nature, but at the end of the day, it was a good day."
3750146,bassnblast,2015-04-09 19:35:00,56,"Silver Water Wheel on Lac Seul. Great fishing, awesome guides, top notch boats, terrific food, nice cabins, and amazing and remote scenery... Might be nice for your buddy to have someone else take care of everything!"
3743770,GeorgeJr,2015-04-08 10:21:00,200,"Looking for help on ""epic"" walleye lake in Canada for a bucket list for a friend who doesn't have odds in his favor. So if you had only 1 trip to Canada to take where would you recommended? Also if you know good lodges to stay I'll pass along as well. His brother and nephew are wanting to make this trip with him while he is still can enjoy it. Thanks in advance for your help."

3744218,bigwalleye1,2015-04-08 12:10:00,2632,"I have fished it, and it can be pretty epic. Lots of options from American plan to housekeeping, from boat in to trailer in, lots of places to find fish, lots of beautiful Canadian Shield scenery, relatively little to no competition, and a strong US vs CDN dollar. Certainly lots of others out there, but it's my favorite. I like it so much, I'm going to go TWICE this year...wait a minute, I go twice EVERY year....!!!"
3744730,Draco1206,2015-04-08 14:24:00,175,"Probably could use a little more information, such as how much you're willing to pay, how far you're willing to travel, and how able is your friend? Canada is a huge country with so many great Lakes, lodges and outpost camps. A ""once in a lifetime trip"" means different things to different people depending on some of the questions I asked. You can't go wrong if you do some research here and pick a quality outfitter. If it were me I would chose a remote fly-in, only cabin on the lake outpost camp if your friend is able. He'll have the best time of his life and catch walleyes until his arms ache. Good luck, I hope you find what he's looking for."

3744826,GeorgeJr,2015-04-08 14:58:00,200,"I think they would prefer to drive up from Wisconsin with their own boat and make a trip of it. Right now he is fine, but just found out the news. Cost I'm not sure but he can't take it with him either. ;-) Always hoping he can beat this in which case this because a annual trip. They are boosting his system to see if he can beat it but odds aren't worth looking at. His spirits are high as I would expect as he is a very happy guy to be around just loves the outdoors. Just trying to offer them some ideas and help any way I can. Thanks for the help so far. Example I like the Lac Seul comment as it must be worth the trip to do it twice a year at around 8 hr drive for BigWalleye1 each way. For them would be under 12 hrs unless the boarder is backed up."
3745058,vaquero01,2015-04-08 16:31:00,101,"This will be our third year going to Onaway and our 6th to Canada. Great cabins on a great fishery. Up by Ear Falls. We drive from NW Indiana and probably spend close to 18 - 20 hours driving, but spread the drive up over three days cuz I am on vacation, not a mission. Onawaylodge.com"
