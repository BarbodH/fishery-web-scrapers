3810993,adempsey,2015-04-25 21:17:00,963,I'll dig up and send you a few waypoints that should be worth checking out.

3713778,3M TA3,2015-03-31 08:58:00,2846,"At the very least leave pecker tracks, or a popcorn trail on your GPS if possible. I have some fairly good GPS/SONAR units that are pathetic when it comes to Canadian Lakes. Shows the lake but often I'm fishing on a piece of land. Do not rely on any GPS map for navigation up there. Just too many hazards everywhere. When encountering hazards, best to leave a weigh point and mark it as such. Too many spots look the same for one who doesn't spend much time there."

3717130,mistersixx,2015-04-01 07:04:00,9,I have been looking at gps and am not sure what model/brand would be decent. Any recommendations for this lake? Preferably something around 200 or less? If that's possible.
3718026,MrSimon,2015-04-01 10:59:00,922,"Get the best GPS unit your budget will allow, and combine that with the big paper contour map that the lodge sells."
3718226,Krisco,2015-04-01 12:10:00,12,"Mistersixx,I will be coming out of the camp on Saturday June 6th, is that the day you are coming in? If yes let me know what cabin you are staying in and I will leave a detailed map with locations and success rates on the kitchen table for you based on the previous weeks findings.As others have said it is a big body of water but don't be discouraged. There are plenty of places to fish close to camp at that time of year and you won't have any problems keeping busy with fish. Bring a handheld to drop tracks if you are venturing off to places like the falls or the outpost.The camp maps that Bob supplies are very helpful for 1st timers."
3718410,adempsey,2015-04-01 13:07:00,963,"I think for fishing use, the obvious choice is a Garmin handheld. Pick one that fits your budget and is compatible with the marine and bluechart maps.Maybe check out the eTrex 20, Oregon 450 or GPSMap 62?My unit is an older eTrex and it works great for my needs.The biggest problem with any of these units is getting the maps. They are expensive. That's why the Navionics app for the smartphone is such a great buy. Definitely consider used as well. An older model that comes with maps would be a great bargain. My handheld is over 5 years old and I have no need to upgrade at this point.Might even be worth looking into some sonar/GPS combo units. If they come with maps and are at the right price, that may be a better way to go. Check out the Lowrance Elite 4 line of sonar/chartplotters or the Elite 4 chartplotter. Check used too."
3718506,kzoofisher,2015-04-01 13:36:00,5144,"If you've never bought a gps ask around and maybe you can borrow one. I did that a couple times trying out units close to home and it really helped me decide how many bells and whistles I wanted. Of course, the fact that I was using them to navigate to mushroom spots and night fishing spots may have encouraged people to lend them. Getting a map of the area is definitely the tough part, there are no electronic maps of the lake. When I get home tonight I'll post the link to the MNR 's topo site."
3719186,kzoofisher,2015-04-01 17:13:00,5144,"Here's the website. You can zoom in to spots, get the GPS coordinates for landmarks and write them on your map, that way you can always have a few places to orient yourself to off your location. You can also customize a map and print it.http://www.giscoeapp.lrc.gov.on.ca/w...er/viewer.html"
3742738,mistersixx,2015-04-08 06:49:00,9,"Krisco, pm sent!! As suggested I will be borrowing a gps to see what features I would/would not like. After I try a few out I will decide on a purchse. Also any colours of jigs stick out for you up there? I need to purchse a new set (left my jig box sit after taking it out on a rainy day, everything is rusted)."
3809169,MuskyMaster,2015-04-25 10:43:00,79,"Ive fished the lake 3 times from the resort, the owner will tell you where the fish are. We did great in the river and I believe it was called musk bay at the other end of the lake. Typical lure choice, I remember orange being the hot color for the lake. Last year we went to their other resort on prairie bee, hands down best smallie fishing of my life. Went the last week of may and the big females moved in. We caught close to a 20-1 ratio of smallies that were 4+ lbs compared to ones that weren't. Absolutely unbelievable. We were a week to early and a week to late on the walleye. Did good our last day on small ones, few 23"" and one 26"" that was thin as can be and caught on a senko bass fishing. Every shoreline looks the same with great cover everywhere you go. We caught fish when It was 95 degrees all week, that's why we go to Canada. Good luck, and as I said the owner will put you on fish."
3711234,mistersixx,2015-03-30 14:56:00,9,So I just booked our stay (the girlfriend and I) at happy day for the second week in june! I'm overly excited and can't wait. Im hoping for some decent weather and good fishing. Any suggestions for the lake for spring walleyes? We have rented the 50 horse boat so distance isn't a problem. Also any suggestions for things to do if the girlfriend wants to spend a day not on the water? Hope everyone is as excited as I am for the opener this year!
3711522,Bassmandpe,2015-03-30 16:39:00,42,"Went there several years ago as a change of pace from many years going to the Wawa area camps. Beautiful lake and the cabins were very clean. The owners were extremely nice and did everything to ensure you had a good time. On this trip I took just my Grandson who was twelve. He was a fisherman so we fished alot. Many of the people there are regular guests and had their fishing sites. We caught smallmouth bass and walleye during our trip which was in July. Most of the fish were small but good eaters. I understand from reading recents post the fishing has been very good and the size has increased. We took side trips to an adjacent lake and caught very nice big wallleye. I think you will have a good time. Good idea on the upgrade boat & motor, we did the same thing."
3711666,adempsey,2015-03-30 17:30:00,963,"I've only been to Windermere once in the summer, but I recall reading that fishing is good at the south end in the spring (edit: I am referring to south of camp). I believe the Windermere River dumps into the lake here."
3712074,chris.brock,2015-03-30 19:07:00,112,"Great camp, great owners, beautiful lake. You're going to have a blast. I'm not on board with everyone else on the fishing aspect though, IMO it can be a little tough. I went for a week in July, 3 consecutive years, and came back for 2 days in early September by myself and fished with Bob for an evening too. My tip would be have live minnows and be set up at the Grazing River inflow at dawn and dusk, for your early June trip. I think the fishing is a little tough but I would go back in a heart beat, good times!"
3712722,adempsey,2015-03-30 23:46:00,963,"I agree. It's a beautiful lake. Fishing was tough for us too, but we still did alright. It's such a big body of water to prospect. I considering going back this year, but it books up so fast - it's hard to beat the rates they charge. If I ever do go back, I plan on getting the fastest boat they have available!!"
3713098,mistersixx,2015-03-31 06:33:00,9,"Thanks for the replies guys! I plan on having minnows for sure, I'm a firm believer that you can't beat live bait, and it's basically all I use when fishing pikeral. I hope to target some big northern as well. For that I'll bust out the musky gear. As for the rivers, is there any map out there that has these rivers and the falls labeled? Finding good current is going to be a very important part of this trip. I've also heard that it will be a cooler spring this year, but who really knows."
3713154,MrSimon,2015-03-31 06:48:00,922,"As everyone else said, its a big beautiful lake and a nice clean camp with nice owners. The lake is so big and has sooooo much good structure that not all of it holds fish. It's all about searching, finding, refining, and repeating. There are enough bass and small/medium sized walleye spread out everywhere that you certainly won't get skunked. But if you are after larger walleye (or massive numbers) you'll have to do some leg work. Or just ask around in camp - the owners and other guests won't steer you wrong. A fairly good overriding principle is that the walleye start out in the Eastern part of the lake and gradually move through the narrows to the deeper basins in the Western portion of the lake as the summer moves on. It's not a bad rule, but there are always exceptions! Since you have a decent sized boat, I HIGHLY recommend exploring the lake. Get a few miles from camp and you won't see another boat all day. It's always nice to visit the falls. If you are adventurous, the two bush lakes are super fun! Kathleen Lake is a short easy walk along a flat path and has great smallie fishing. Goldie Lake is a much more aggressive hike along a steep trail, but the fishing is great and the scenery and solitude is second to none. Talk to the owners about the details. They also rent ATVs and there are loads of great trails to ride. I was surprised how much fun it was to rent those and rip around for a few hours in the afternoon. Last thing - if you do adventure far from camp .... take a map (preferably a GPS), make sure your gas tank is full, pay attention to where you are, and let someone know you plan to be going a far distance that day."
3713290,mistersixx,2015-03-31 07:14:00,9,"From what I have read there are no contour maps for the gps, so would any gps work. Will it still have an outline of the lake and the islands? Or will it just be a blank screen with my saved waypoints? I don't know much about gps as I've never had the need for them ( only have a 12 foot tiner with a 6 horse so cant ever go to far from landing.)"
3713386,kzoofisher,2015-03-31 07:25:00,5144,If your handheld gps has a topo map of the area you'll have a pretty good idea where you are. You can also make your own topo on the MNR website and label landmarks with gps coordinates for reference. There are paper contour maps available which you can use the old fashioned way and the lodge has small ones marked up when you arrive.
3713714,MrSimon,2015-03-31 08:43:00,922,Just about any GPS unit will at least give you an outline of the lake. The big maps that the lodge sells are great. I highly recommend ordering one ahead of time.
