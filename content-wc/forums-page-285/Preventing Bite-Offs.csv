3782121,zeebee,2015-04-18 21:47:00,1144,"Been fishin a few years and the recommendatioms Ive read above are of little utility. If you are targetting eyes in a water that harbours pike/musky, the latter will latch on and sometimes you will land them and sometimes you wont. I caught a 47"" nothern on leaderless 10 lbs test while targetiing eyes (got lucky) but have also had them bite thru 50 lbs flouro while actually targeting northerns. So..whats to be learned??? When I fish Musky I wear 100 lbs braid and a 130 lbs flouro leader. Otherwise I fish walleye with light non leader line and hope I get lucky if a toothy predator hits....its the nature of the beast. Decide what you are fishing and go for the best set up...theres is no panacea for all encounters. When the fat lady sings you will likely be ahead. The lost battles are memories as opposed to the ones that are to be fondled which are mamories. Dig deep."
3783689,pale ryder,2015-04-19 11:37:00,1937,I've been making and using 18 lb. un-coated 7-strand leaders for decades. The walleyes don't care and I get to catch bonus musky and pike.I use them whenever I troll or cast crank or minnow baits.

Run out of it, used to get shorter lengths of it from the next door landlord, need tio find someone who works in medical supplies or hospital now. Al"
3753306,fishron,2015-04-10 17:46:00,317,"Forever, when I'm fishing walleye lakes that also have pike, (are there any other kind?) I use a six inch metal leader called invisileader, especially if trolling. It has a very small swivel at one end and a small snap at the other. I never have thought it messes up the action of the lure or even a jig. In twelve pound test it is very, very, thin. If I'm just focusing on walleye, I use ten pound fluorocarbon, and take my chances. After a pike has had it's way with this petite leader it has to be discarded or somehow straitened. In my experience, this leader has never failed."
3753994,BreezyPoint,2015-04-10 21:23:00,1581,"I am with bobbylfisherman. I troll shallow water all season and catch my biggest walleyes that way. Furthermore, I use 9"" wire leaders in front of my cranks and I do just as well as my partners who are busy losing lures. I really think we overrate the impact of leaders on fish. If you are still skittish about using a leader, take some whiteout and paint one inch strips followed by an unpainted inch. Makes the leader close to invisible.Frank"
3754905,Bassmandpe,2015-04-11 08:37:00,42,"Take a look at the South Bend Invisa Leader w/BB Swivel. Come 3 per pack, I use the 5 inch, I throw alot of crankbaits and minnow baits in ther Spring. These do not seem to effect the lure action and can't remember a bite off. Listed on Amazon for $7.47 for three pack. Good luck!"
3755641,pike50plus,2015-04-11 14:00:00,584,"I think Southbend use to make them, may be another manf now"
3757465,P&y only,2015-04-12 08:05:00,133,"I use 20lbs power pro with no leader. I lose very few cranks. For me, it seems that the issue for a lot of people comes after the bite. During the fight. If you keep the line tight and a bend in your rod you will usually keep your line out of the way of those razor teeth. Give em any slack and a tooth or gill plate will probably cut you off."
3759985,Aspencreek,2015-04-12 21:15:00,2911,"In the clearer lakes that may be true. But, in stained lakes like LS there are big girls hanging around the weed edges looking to ambush or sitting just at the bottom of the first major drop of one of those mid-lake humps. I will rarely fish in water over 14-16'. I contour troll and love those weed edges in 10-12""."
3760993,DeBo,2015-04-13 08:02:00,211,Uni to Uni knot from your braid to 20-25lb Seaguar Flouro Leader material. Only bad part about this system is your stick baits will run a bit shallower due to the diameter of the flouro. A bonus of the flouro leaders is they are easy to grab for landing fish.Knot 2 kinky or tyger tiable leader materials work great as well. If you need to keep your baits down I would suggest these. Very thin diameter and quite strong.With the flouro you will still get bit off occasionaly. I have had less success going with the 15lb and less flouro leaders. You can get by with the lighter flouros if you are using a lighter action rod.Keep your hardware small and the leaders won't impact your catch rate at all.
3762857,bobbylfishermon,2015-04-13 16:56:00,241,"I'm with you Aspencreek, those weed lines are sooooo sweet, and like you said, there are ""big girls"" for the taking, the real bonus is the lakes are most oftenwide open to trollers......."
3770337,MrSimon,2015-04-15 12:40:00,922,"I've been using inexpensive black steel leaders for decades. I don't think fish mind them when trolling cranks .... especially if you are banging big noisy baits off rocks. I won't use the silver leaders though .... they do seem to catch fewer fish. When using more subtle baits like stickbaits and swimbaits, I use a 3' flouro leader .... somewhere between 12 and 20lb depending on the situation."
3782049,jaximus,2015-04-18 20:59:00,117,"i used to use invisileaders when trolling cranks. we target lake trout and get quite a few snot rockets also. the invisileaders are nice until you get one pike or get a lake trout to death roll. they they are all kinked up and useless. i now use 30lb sufix 832. when trolling for lakers/pike, i just use a snap directly on the braid. never had a cut off and i manage to catch as much as the other guys in the boat running invisleaders and 12lb mono. in the mornings/evenings when we troll moreseo for walleyes, i run a 4ft 12lb mono leader with a snap at the lure and a swivel at the mainline/leader knot. its probably more hastle than its worth being that i catch walleyes on the 30lb braid right to the lure, but i do it because i was always told walleyes can be line shy."
3751402,BornToFish,2015-04-10 08:26:00,1224,"I'm giving serious thought to using more crankbaits and minnowbaits when fishing for walleyes in NW Ontario during the opening weeks of the season. I've dabbled enough with this before to know that this approach catches walleyes. I've also learned that northern pike love to eat the same crankbaits. I have lost quite of few rather pricey Rapala lures to northern pike. What have you guys used as leaders to prevent bite-offs when fishing stick baits? I'm looking for something that will prevent bite-offs, but not adversely impact the action of the lure. Thanks in advance for your suggestions!!"
3751482,jambi,2015-04-10 08:41:00,504,"I like trolling small cranks as search lures. I switched from mono to power pro - helped quite a bit with the bite offs. I re-tie quite often too, especially after a pike does a little damage to the braid. I might loose one or two during the week still though."
3751538,Walleye_Guru,2015-04-10 08:56:00,62,"I use fluorocarbon all the time for my leaders. Depending on the situation, i tie a blood knot to the main line (or use swivel) and a rapala knot to the lure (in the case of a crankbait). I can't think of a better way to protect your crankbait yet eliminate potential line shyness. For walleyes, you could use up to 15lbs and still have the pike protection and not sacrifice action. It will break though, so if you land a pike or get hung up, make sure you check it for nicks. Replace as necessary."
3751554,fishman10,2015-04-10 09:00:00,226,"Losing lures is part of the game, and with the price of cranks, it hurts. We fished a lake that had huge northern s, we would hook while walleye fishing. We tried using wire leaders, but then the walleye would shy away from rigs."
3751778,Algoma Guy,2015-04-10 09:37:00,48,"Agree with walleye guru. Fluorocarbon for sure. I even use up to 20lb test with guests to avoid pike bite offs when fishing jigs for walleyes. But let's be honest you haven't truly experienced Canada without getting ""PIKED"" at least once!!"
3751850,bobbylfishermon,2015-04-10 10:00:00,241,"I troll about 90% of the time, ( unless the wife wants to jig) I've trolled my way thru South Dakota, North Dakota, and have been trolling The Vermilion Bay, ON. area since 1997, with the SAME results, not quite as many fish as the jiggers, BUT, trolling produces bigger fish, without a doubt! Ron Seelhoff, a star on the PWT walleye trail was a contour troller ( almost exclusively) and won several tournaments trolling cranks!Walleyes are TOP OF THE LINE predators and you can make them hit(just like bass) they find a crankbait swimming in their face almost irresistible and being the predator they are, they have to kill it!! I fish Canada spring and fall (cold water) and NEVER get deeper than 9ft. I use Berkley flicker shads, #5,#6 (shad raps have priced them selves out for me) my flicker shads run right in their faces and they can't heip but eat them. Another thing, ifyou're catching your fish on just the back hooks, those are REACTION STIRIKES (non- active fish ), if the fish have both sets of hooks in them that's an (active fish stirike).... I lose 2 or three flicker shads in 2 weeks (9 bucks) on 8lb test, and a #1 swivel , minnows last year were 5or 6 bucks a dozen, do the math and musky and northerns are always a bonus and a lot of the time are caught on the back hooks.. If I loose a bait it's good excuse to head to Cabelas.. Learn to contour troll and hang on to your rod!!!"
3751906,SinOrSwim,2015-04-10 10:22:00,1528,"So, you troll in 9 feet of water even in early to mid september in Canada? We are always told to fish 20 to 35ft on reefs and humps?"
3752034,adempsey,2015-04-10 11:03:00,963,Try some tyable leader material.
3752058,bobbylfishermon,2015-04-10 11:12:00,241,"yes sir, in early to mid Sept. I still troll in 9ft. of water, BUT, I fish the first 2-3 hrs in the morning and the last 2-3 hrs before dark, walleyes got their name by being low light opportunity feeders, and even in warm water a certain percentage of fish will move shallow to feed in low light, it gives them the edge and one will be surprised how well you will do by fishing the ""RIGHT TIMES"" Early and late I troll, mid-day I jig, deep... hope that helps.."
