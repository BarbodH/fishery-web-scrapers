They're not industrial quality but would work for any garage shop without worry. Now that I'm ready to start filling them, I'm looking for a light suggestion and something to put on the wall between the top/bottom cabinets. I do have availability of the 120V outlet to run a light if at all necessary and I'm guessing the light and run the cord behind the wall mount option I choose. Is there a good non-AC option to look at for lighting that I don't have to wire? Also, what wall storage system would you choose? I think I'd like something better that peg board. I will utilize the outlet for recharging batteries and such. I'm looking at wall systems like Gladiator Garage Works to cut for the 24""x78"" space between the cabinets. Any other good options?"
