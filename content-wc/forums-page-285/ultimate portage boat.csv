3791273,driftersifter,2015-04-21 06:29:00,109,How would you deck out your portage boat I'm putting one together now looking to outfit right. Some of the lakes I fish are drag ins and some you can get a wheeler to the lake. I fish on my own a lo so weight is important as is safety. THANKS
3791489,MrSimon,2015-04-21 07:03:00,922,"A Sportspal aluminum flat-back canoe is a great option. It's light, but sturdy and can take a small outboard. They are quite stable for a canoe and even have flotation on the sides. Your best bet though would be to find a buddy to go with you"
3794977,chris.brock,2015-04-21 19:17:00,112,i'm with Mr Simon. The Pal is a classic back lake utility boat.
3796817,Bill Krejca,2015-04-22 08:36:00,6107,"We used to use a homemade motorcycle wheeled platform for portaging into a Saskatchewan lake. It handled a loaded 14 ft boat pretty easily, but required more than 1 person to convince the boat where it wanted to go! Bill"
3799297,driftersifter,2015-04-22 17:43:00,109,How would set up the inside of the boat? Older hp motor or new with remote tank or built in. How do you guys transport minnows and or leaches across the portage? I like it simple so two rods are enough. I like to complete the portage in three trips if possible. I'm really wanting a cushioned backrest clamp on seat. thanks for the input so far.

I wouldn't take minnows or leeches. We stayed at a lodge once that had homemade backpack units for the motors. Awesome idea! For the boat - I'd keep it as bare bones as possible. Just a basic boat with nothing attached to it."
3801865,SinOrSwim,2015-04-23 09:06:00,1528,"Best portage boat is one the outfitter hauled in and left there for me to use. Prefer one with padded swivel seats and a nice motor. And, a clear cut path for me to get to it. Oh, and not a very long portage either."
3803161,castnblast,2015-04-23 14:03:00,111,I have spent days in Sportspal canoes - thankfully they were many years ago. They great but crazy uncomfortable. For me - a 17' Gruman Sportboat with a 6hp outboard is tough to beat.
