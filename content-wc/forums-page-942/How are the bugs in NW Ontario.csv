522089,Guest,2002-07-01 17:54:00,0,how are the skeeters and black flies in NW Ontario (Kenora & Red lake areas)? Is it true that you have to wear long sleeve shirts when fishing or can you use some Off and a tee shirt this time of year. Any input would be appreciated. I will be there this week.

The camp owner where we were said that it was the worst that he's seen in six years. He attributes it to the moist spring. We were OK when on the water, but we always had DEET spray on and stayed inside when at camp. Your best bet is to not shower."

During the day, the bugs aren't bad, although just barely enough of them to warrant wearing deet. As far as long sleeves--don't worry. You can fish shirtless if you want and not be bothered as long as it's light on your on the water. Once you get to shore it's usually a diferent story."
