521964,Guest,2002-06-28 06:39:00,0,"2 years ago we ventured to ""The Narrows"" on Lake Winnipeg and had reasonably good luck there. We are looking for an area where we can possibliy hire 1 or 3 guides and have access to at least 3 or 4 boats for maybe 1 to 3 days of assisted fishing. By assisted, meaning locating and suggesting possible locations to land some keepers. If the guides and boats are not an answerable question, then just some good fishing holes up that way would be appreciated.Thanks in advance.Kevin"
