522056,Guest,2002-07-01 04:56:00,0,I am going to an outpost camp for 5 days then we are going to stay in Kenora for a couple of days. We are thinking about renting a boat and doing some fishing on LOTW for a day or two. Anyone know of any reputable outfits to call for a one or two day boat rental in or around the Kenora area? Thanks in advance for the help
