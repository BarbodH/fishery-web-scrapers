521544,Guest,2002-06-29 20:31:00,0,"Larry,All the kitchen help are women. The owners are husband and wife (Steve and Gail). Gail runs the guest interfaces on a daily basis while Steve leads the crews doing maintenance activities etc. Both are gracious people who are very customer oriented.The kitchen staff are all females (like 4 of them if I recall correctly). The dining room service is all done by females (like 5 or 6 of them). There are usually 40 to 60 guests or so in camp at a given time and I don't think we have ever been there with fewer than 5 or 6 women. People often bring children ... the youngest being 8 years old or so, and there are typically 4 or 5 of them around. Last summer a grandma and grandpa brought 2 of their grandchildren (they sat at our table of about 14 people for the week ... it was fun!).This is definitely NOT a men-only environment. Your wife should feel very comfortable. Gail goes out of her way to make sure new folks are seated with compatible people and quietly and discretely re-arranges seating at meals during the week for anyone who is not."
521545,Guest,2002-06-29 20:49:00,0,"Larry,One more thing ... you won't find a ""remote"" camp on Lake of the Woods ... if what you mean by ""remote"" is ""fly-in"" type of remote or ""boat-in 20 miles"" type of remote. What you WILL find, especially in the northern portions of the lake are camps that are VERY far apart ... like 10 miles. I assume that satisfies your definition of ""remote"". Witch Bay itself is a 5-mile long finger extending from a 6+ mile long finger called Andrew's Bay. Witch Bay Camp is the only camp on those two bays. Hope this helps.The fishing is good. If you are going to be there in July let me know. My wife and I will show you some of the spots we have acquired over the past 10 years."

521560,Winnie,2002-06-24 22:25:00,375,"Took my third trip to Goose Bay Camp on Lac Seul this spring. Had a great time, and the total cost of the lodge for 3.5 days of fishing with some upgrades was under $400/person. We did have six people, so the cabin cost was down some."
521561,woman,2002-06-25 04:09:00,2,"Where are you coming from? If your from the midwest try out Lac seul Evergreen lodge 4 hrs north of International Falls, MN on Lacseul.They are located only 1 mile out of Ear Falls. Assordable family rates and great hosts, fantastic fishing is a bonus.www.lacseulwalleye.com good luck finding new spot"

521557,vandy,2002-06-26 09:51:00,2,"I have to agree with Eyebanger. Praire Bee Camps on Lower Praire Bee Lake is a very nice camp with excellent hosts Tom and Georgia Lee. I just got back from there with my son and a freind of his. It is about 4 hours north of the Soo. The camp is a boat in camp, so it is almost like a fly-in with out the added cost. The fishing was very good, got our limit of walleyes plus some meals, plus my son got a 38"" 11lb pike. The equipment is new 9.9 Honda 4 strokes, 14 foot boats, and the cabins are well kept. I am trying to convince my wife she would enjoy it up there for the week. Our cost was less then a $1,000 US for the week. If you are going through the Soo, I think it would be an excellent choice."
521540,2746,2002-06-27 16:40:00,3206,WileyWalleyPlanning on taking my wife up this year for the first time. Your description sounded good and I went to witch bay's web site. Sounds good but a little turned off by central showers and toilets. Even the more remote camps I go to with the guys have gotten away from that. How are those facilities and do the wives mind? Don't need fancy but a trip accross camp ground in the middle of the night won't be what she had in mind.
521541,Guest,2002-06-28 06:14:00,0,"Larry,Best thing to do is to ask her how she thinks it would be. This is a very personal thing.All I can tell you is that my wife is as picky a woman as I have ever seen when it comes to personal cleanliness. She won't go a day without a shower of some sort. (Why she married a pig like me, I have NO idea!) But she has never complained about the facilities at Witch Bay Camp.She complains about restrooms in the gas stations and restaurants on the way up if they are not clean. She will not use a pail for bodily relief in the boat (even with no other boats around) ... she has to be put up on shore. But apparently the showers (which are central, yes, but individual tiny rooms) and the bathrooms (several central sites in the camp but also tiny individual rooms) are kept clean enough that it is not a problem for her. I know the female camp staff members clean all those facilities every day ... and they do a darn good job.Hope this helps."
521542,Guest,2002-06-28 06:18:00,0,"Larry,To add to my prior post ... there are a lot of wives in camp. We are now good friends with half a dozen other couples we met there. I have heard none of them complain about the facilities. Would in-cabin be better? Sure.But the central sites are not that bad. Also, there are several such sites throughout the camp so the ""midnight"" trip is not that big a deal. My wife does it about once every other night ... and while she says it is a pain, she also loves going to that camp. So, how bad can it be?"
521543,2746,2002-06-28 11:43:00,3206,"WileyThanks for the reply, it was very helpful. Knowing that several other wives also visit the camp is helpful. Being the only woman in camp can't be all that comfortable and most of the camps I have fished at over the years have been all men. We may go ahead and give it a try. Thanks again!"
521550,Moose_MI,2002-06-19 04:58:00,31,"Hi, I'd recommend you reconsider going to a drive-in. If good fishing truly is a REQUIREMENT...do a fly-in. I've wasted to much money and time at drive ins already. If you must do a drive-in...do yourself a favor...set up a day trip fly-in for one of the days your there to a remote lake...You will not regret it. Enjoy your trip! ... and kudos for takin the Mrs. ....Moose"

Happy wife, happy life, right. Besides, she catches all the fish. Thanks agian and good fishing all. I'll let you know later on how the trip went! (Havent quite decided where we're going yet)"

521554,Guest,2002-06-20 08:38:00,0,"If you want easy walleye action, good accomodations, all the information you need, and great food then go to Hidden Island on Lake of the Woods out of Morson. The resort is on an island. They will pick you up and transport you to the resort or lead you out if you have your own boat. Priced very reasonable. TGG Second vote would be for Witch Bay also on LOW."
521538,Guest,2002-06-21 07:51:00,0,"I have to put in a plug for Witch Bay Camp.My wife and I have been going there every year since 1993. We stayed 1 week the first 4 years just due to lack of vacation time. The last 6 years we have stayed 2 weeks at a time.They treat their guests EXTREMELY well, are very conscientious, and are fair in their prices. This is a class act, folks. If it was not, we would not be returning every year.Look at the website www.witchbaycamp.com. Take a look at the feedback that the pros that visit there are providing you ... and they will provide it to you while you are at the camp if you wish. Look at the effort put into fishing tips. Hope this helps."

521558,GR8WTHUNTER,2002-06-23 22:11:00,618,"You may want to look at a lodge that offers an American plan if you are taking your wife. I do this when I take my wife so she does not have to even think about cooking, cleaning, dishes and the like. You will enjoy your vacation more as will she. This way is slightly more costly, but for me well worth it. Rich"
521531,WalleyeOne,2002-06-18 06:14:00,249,Hi all:My wife and I would like to take a trip to Canada and expierience some good fishing. Can anyone name a few Lodges/Camps that have good accomodations and good fishing without a whole lot of cost. Plan on driving in to save $$. Please post or email me information. Would like to stay in an individual cabin that is rather remote. Anything you can give me would help. Thanks in Advance and good fishing!WalleyeOne
521532,Guest,2002-06-18 08:27:00,0,Check out Williams Lake Lodge. I stay at their outpost at the mouth of Williams Creek that dumps into Williams Bay. 10 mile boat ride gives you access to some great fishing. Their minimum for outpost is 4 though. They also have individual cabins at main lodge.
521533,Guest,2002-06-18 09:05:00,0,May I suggest you have a look at www.sawmill-lodge.com or call them toll free at 1-866-264-5464

I have been going there for years and enjoy the time. The new owners are very attentive and cabins are basic but nice. Fishing is good.http://members.tripod.com/brownbay/"
521535,Guest,2002-06-18 09:57:00,0,"Hey, this is a little off the subject, but I just want to applaud you for taking your wife. It's hard to sit and listen to my man (now he's past tense) constantly talk about how great the fishing is in Canada, but never willing to take me (especially when I have wanted to go). Have a great time and enjoy it with your husband."

521549,Guest,2002-06-18 20:36:00,0,"We have been going to Clark's Camp for several years.www.clarkscamp.comWe were just there this last week. The chain has walleyes, muskies, smallmouths and lake trout. No northerns, but I like it that way.We caught enough fish to eat fish every day, plus bring some home. I consider it more of a numbers place than a trophy place. Our biggest eye was 23.5"" (we released it). I know that somebody else caught a 26"" eye. I think the rain put the fishing in the dumper for a couple of days last week. I know the two weeks before they caught some bigger eyes.If you never caught a muskie, it is a great place. Both of my kids caught their first muskie on the chain. 2 years ago I caught a 40"" muskie. I know other people who have caught bigger ones.The cottages are relatively close together, but noise is not normally a problem. There are several smaller cottages. They are clean. Wayne and Karla plus the rest of the staff do a good job.Just don't book for next year yet, because I do not have my reservation in yet. :)Fritz"
