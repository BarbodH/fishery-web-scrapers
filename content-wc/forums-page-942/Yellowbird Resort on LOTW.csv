My wife ""has to"" attend a conference at the resort and she is taking me along for the fishing.Search the past postings and did not find anything. Questions are: Is the resort any good, how is the mid July fishing on LOTW's on their end, and any recommendations for on general patterns at that time of the year? I go Lac Seul every June, but this is my first trip to LOTWs. Thanks in advance for any help..."

Boats were wonderful, with the only question for me being why they do not have electric trolling motors.Regarding guides and the fishing.... both can be good and bad. I had a fellow that was personable but was not too interested in fishing (not a good sign). I would go again but would ideally like a guide that was a keener... or I would simply prefer to go out on my own.Tight LinesODG"
