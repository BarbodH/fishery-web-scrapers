He had the best walleye fishing (size and numbers) in the last few years. Perhaps the new regulations is beginning to improve quality fishing. In early June he fishes mostly in the area of the Trout river entering into Pakwash with best baits jig/minnows and leeches (got jumbo leeches in Vermillion Bay). None of us have been on Pakwash in July. By then, my guess is the walleyes will have moved into deeper waters - would try leeches and nitecrawlers around some of the islands. If you are staying at Cianci's, they are great people and Frank would be very helpful. Good luck for good fishing!"

Therefore, we never found a pattern that worked all the time.You don't have to use minnows. One boat in our party took minnows out the first day. They caught fish, but once that first batch of minnows was gone they switched to crawlers like the rest of us.The few big walleyes we caught (23"" to 27"") all came from deep water dragging 3 oz. bottom bouncers and crawler harnesses. Better numbers came from 8' to 12' FOW over sand or off rocky points, also with a spinner/crawler harnesses. Wind-swept shores were best, but about half the time the waves were too big to fish windy points safely.At times, there was a great weed bite next to incoming streams on Bruce Lake, which is joined with Pakwash by the Trout River. If they were in the weeds, each man would catch 10 to 20 walleyes in an hour or so, either jigging with half a crawler right in the weeds or pulling a spinner/crawler just off the weed edge. Nothing huge, but good numbers. Good luck."

Mostly at the park. They hit good there 2-3 of the 6 days we fished. Also at the points. Jigging worked good with minnows, worms or soft artificials. Had a lot of fun doing this in some weeds off the rocks. One person trolled mostly shad raps #7 and caught bigger fish. (20-25""). 12-14"" often were caught with minnows. Had a great time. This is a great site!"
