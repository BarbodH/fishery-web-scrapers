521945,Guest,2002-06-27 19:24:00,0,If we get asked for a birth certificate does it have to be an original/embossed copy or is a xerox OK?
521946,FOOTDOC,2002-06-27 20:41:00,139,I was told a copy of the certificate was adequate as long as the copy is notarized.
521947,Guest,2002-06-27 21:28:00,0,"Yes that is also correct a noterized photocopy will do,just to let you know they (u.s customs ) have been stopping all commercial and joe public before you enter canada...maybe something about beefing up for G8 summit, not a big concern it might slow you down 1/2 hr HAVE A GREAT TIME UP HERE"
521948,Guest,2002-06-29 06:08:00,0,Copy is fine. Just returned and crossed at Fort Frances. No problems either way.
521949,retire55,2002-06-29 13:24:00,1029,"SW:Not a criticism but I don't understand the rationale for your question. Why would one choose to carry a notarized copy rather than the original embossed piece of plastic. Afterall, it can sit right next to your credit cards in your wallet."
521950,Stillwater,2002-06-29 15:19:00,87,"I'm not sure I understand the most recent reply. Plastic? I have an original copy of my Birth Certificate and it's on 8 1/2 X 14"" embossed paper, I have another that I just got on June, 13 2002 and that's on 5"" X 7"" paper, folded up and put in a small envelope. I wish I could have got it on a plastic card. I used it to apply for a passport, which I now have. I was advised in January by U.S. Customs (coming back from ice fishing at Oak Island) that a passport is the thing to have. I'm going up June 26th and I feel covered. I wasn't offered an option as to what type of media I would like to have it on."
521951,retire55,2002-06-29 17:16:00,1029,Stillwater:My apologies. I made an assumption I shouldn't have made. The present Canadian birth cerificate that I carry (a laminated plastic card similar in size to a credit card) was issued to me in 1965 as a replacement for the paper version. It is always in my wallet and is produced as one of the two pieces of identification when required. I always use a passport when crossing borders. Regret the confusion. Jay
521952,Stillwater,2002-06-29 18:43:00,87,"Jay,No apology necessary. A bit of confusion is all that's happening here.I (along with most other US citizens) thought that a drivers license with a picture, and birthdate, was all that was required to go anywhere that you could drive and get a drink when you were thirsty. That's not true anymore, but the thing is, that's about all the ID we ever carry. Now I have gone hardcore and got a passport, not to get into Canada, but to insure I can come back into the US. Chances are things have eased up since the C-11 bill went into effect June 28. But, I am prepared to cross the border, in/out with minimal problems. After all, I just want to go fishing. Every minute spent at customs/immigrations comes out of my time on the water...Scott"
