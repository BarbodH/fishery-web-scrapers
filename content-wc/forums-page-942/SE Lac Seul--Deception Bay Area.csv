521981,Dave,2002-06-29 20:44:00,258,"Josh:I just returned on Friday from a Canadian fishing trip to Lac Seul and Minnitaki. We had a great trip even though it was our first trip to these 2 lakes. We had a guide each day from Anderson's Lodge and primarily fished the SE portion of Lac Seul in & around the Grassy Bay & Bear Narrows areas. We caught 5-6 walleye that were 26"" long and many in the 21""-25"" range including 1 day where we caught 15 or more walleye that were at least 21"" or longer while jig fishing with crawlers & leeches. Look for weedy bays where there is 8'-12' of water with the wind blowing into them. The water level on Lac Seul is defintely high as it is at least 3-4' higher than normal. Hope this information helps. Let us know how you do on your trip."
