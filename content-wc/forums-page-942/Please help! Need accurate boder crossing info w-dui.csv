521470,Guest,2002-06-19 06:36:00,0,"Went across the International Falls border on the 7th of June, 2 of us in the car had priors. No questions asked about DUI convictions. Same old questions from last year, what we were bringing in and how lond we were staying. Look the person in the eye and just answer his/her questions. Good luck."
521471,Guest,2002-06-21 03:51:00,0,"Having crossed the border at least three times per year for the past twenty-one years, all of which were since my own conviction, my experience has been that being polite and honest with the folks at the border seems to be the best policy. Twice we were pulled aside to pay duty on beer. Never have we been asked to produce identification documents. It seems as if the only stories we hear about are the negative ones. This is not to say they don't occur. The point is: For every negative story, there are countless border crossings that are routine. If, at some point, I should be denied entry into Canada under the terms of their laws, I guess I'll have to deal with it. In fact, until I began reading these post on WC, I had no idea that something that happened to me over twenty years ago was even an issue. I never thought about it then. I won't think about it now."
521472,Guest,2002-06-30 03:41:00,0,"there was a lot of hype about this over the winter for no good reason. it was started by a guy with a beef. anyway canada got wind of it and changed things over the spring. regulations change 6/28. over 10 years dui are ignored. and frankly....unless you're a real dope they wont bother you. relax. enjoy the trip. with 16 guys in a group one guy isnt going to make them blink. they're too cool anyway. just smile, and have a great trip. and tell the old man to have one too!"
521459,Forky,2002-06-16 08:42:00,0,"I need everyone's help. We are leaving for Canada this week and my father was just told by someone that you cannot enter Ontario (Ft. Francis or Baudette area) with a DUI on your record.Well, unknown to me until this morning is that my fathert has had 2 dui's, one in 1977 and one in 1981. He now feels he should stay home to not jeopardize the trip for the others in our group. He feels just terrible about this and I need to have some accurate information fast. Can he cross the borer? Will any dui's over 20 years old show up on his record? Is there a good chance they will find out about them during our border crossing? I previously understood that you could purchase a pardon to allow you access into Canada if you had a dui? I need to know the rules for sure so as not to jeopardize our group's trip (16 of us)because of my father. He really wants to go as do I but he does not want to be the cause of major problems at the border. Can some one give me some accurate information or a contact who can.Thank you in advance for your responses.Forky"
521460,retire55,2002-06-16 10:29:00,1029,"Hey Forky:Larry M started a similar discussion and there are 28 responses. His topic is just 5 topics below your question. Bellbuoy provided some pretty accurate information there. How much more information do you require? With all due respect, leaving such potential questions unresolved until the week your group is leaving, kind of sets your group up for some potential disappointments."
521461,Paul H,2002-06-16 10:35:00,1232,"sequences of DUI Canada Would Ban Bush  But There Are Loopholes By Rebecca Cooper W A S H I N G T O N, Nov. 3  Even if George W. Bush is elected president, he may need special permission to get into Canada because of his arrest for drunken driving. The Republican candidate for president acknowledged for the first time on Thursday that he was arrested for driving under the influence on Labor Day weekend in 1976, near his family home in Kennebunkport, Maine. According to Canada's Criminal Code, Bush is deemed an inadmissible person, in violation of Section 19 (2) (a.1) of the Immigration Act of Canada. In other words, he has committed a crime considered an indictable offense in Canada, and, because of that he is banned. Alternative Entry Points Luckily for Bush, if he is elected president of the United States Nov. 7 and is invited to any gatherings of heads of state in Canada, since his offense is more than five years old, there are ways for him to gain entry without breaking federal law. He is going to have to go through what's called the rehabilitation process. The rehab takes a while and it would be somewhat demeaning for a president of the United States. He would have to go through a series of steps, including getting letters from friends saying he has cleaned up his act. If he wanted to come to Canada before completing the lengthy rehab process, he would need the permission of a senior immigration official, immigration lawyer Colin R. Singer tells ABCNEWS. Has He Reformed? According to a rehab check list compiled by the Canadian law firm of Larson, Bryson & Boulton, the Canadian government considers several factors when determining whether a person wanting entry to Canada has truly rehabilitated themselves from their criminal offense and deserves entry, including: acceptance of responsibility for the offense; evidence of remorse; evidence of a change in lifestyle; and, evidence of stability in employment and family life. If Bush wants to avoid any appearance of favoritism and skip the special waiver from a senior official, it is possible to speed up the rehab process by just paying a hefty processing fee at the border. And a lot of Americans with DUIs on their records manage to get in to Canada without border computers catching their previous offense and without admitting to their criminal records. Of course Singer doesn't recommend that approach for Bush. If Bush comes to Canada or has ever been to Canada since his conviction and hides the fact that he has a prior conviction  no matter how far back  he could be excluded from Canada permanently and never allowed to return. An Influential Law Canadian immigration experts say the law affects numerous Americans seeking entry to Canada every month, usually when computer checks do catch the old offense. There's even information on a Canadian fishing Web site explaining to visiting anglers how to cross into Canada with an old DUI charge. And according to Singer, This affects professionals in the sports and entertainment industries more often than people think. Gore and Clinton Illegal Too Canadian attorney Darryl Larson maintains Bush has some notable company in the inadmissible category, contending that Canadian law bans both President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. If you admit to having smoked marijuana, Larson explains, You have admitted to an unlawful act. That would allow reasonable grounds for our immigration officers to determine that you have broken a law that, if committed in Canada, would be subject to prosecution and therefore falls under this law. So this would apply to both Clinton and Gore. Larson and Singer say a president of the United States can expect to bypass the rehab process and be given special permission to enter fairly quickly. But a special waiver is good for only 30 days. If George W. Bush wants to come to Canada for more than 30 days to vacation here, like President Roosevelt used to do, or if he decides he wants to live or work here, Larson contends, He's going to have to go through the Canadian rehabilitation process. It's the law."
521462,Guest,2002-06-17 06:59:00,0,Just went up and back last week. We had no issues at the border. No one checked drivers licenses or asked out of the normal questions. The only advice I would give you is to be polite and don't lie. If they do check licenses I beleive the worst that would happen is he will have to pay a $200.00 (Canadian money) for a temporary pass into the country. We crossed at Fort Frances going up and Thunder Bay coming back. Good Luck.
521463,Guest,2002-06-17 09:40:00,0,"Croosed at Sault St. Marie a couple of weeks ago, had 6 people, 2 cars, and a previous DUI offender in each car, they asked the usually 3 or 4 questions and we were on our way, about 20 seconds. Of cousrse things could of benn different, we new that, but thats the way it happened with us"
521464,Walleye Wacker,2002-06-17 13:30:00,6,Just crossed for the second time this year last week. Had no problems either time. Be polite and make sure that if you have anything that requires duty you declare it. Make sure driver and vehicle have no DUI. They sometimes run vehicle number and if you have duty to pay they will run info on whoever goes ion to pay duty....Good Luck
521465,Guest,2002-06-17 19:39:00,0,Just got back. I had a DUI 9 years ago. They ran a check on my license and said I was good to go! I did have most of the papers that i needed to apply for a pardon though. I must say it was a couple of nervous moments waiting at the border. I did see some guys be told that they couldn't get in until Immegration opened up later in the morning.
521466,Guest,2002-06-18 06:54:00,0,"Relax go fishing. Don't think you'll have an issue. Just make sure the vehicle being driven is not his, they run license and check record of vehicle owner but are unlikely to check his license/recor if he's passenger. Take him fishing and enjoy!"
521467,Guest,2002-06-18 13:30:00,0,Dreye. That's not correct. Twice now they have checked everyone in my vehicle. One guy got bounced in March. TGG
521468,Guest,2002-06-18 14:12:00,0,Just got back drove through myself have mutiple dui's and went through like the wind.. asked 3-4 questions to me did not even address my passenger who has 3 offences dont worry be happy!! Take your sunglasses of and dont be smoking a cigar when you go through and you should have a 99 out of a 100 chance of getting through.
