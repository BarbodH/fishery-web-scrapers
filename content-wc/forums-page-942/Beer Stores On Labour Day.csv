I knew this was Labor Day Weekend in the U.S., but have just noticed on the calendar that it is also Labour Day in Canada. I would imagine that the Government Beer Stores would be closed on this holiday, can anyone out there tell me if they know for sure whether they will be open or closed on this holiday? Thank you.Jig'N'John"

Consequently, I telephoned my local beer store and they stated they would be closed on Labour Day. Jay"
