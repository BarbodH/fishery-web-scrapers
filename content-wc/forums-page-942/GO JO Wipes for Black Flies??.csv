522062,Dave S,2002-07-01 11:36:00,314,In the past several weeks I saw reference to a post on WC suggesting GO JO wipes to repell black flies. Do these wipes work as well as DEET or are they a more friendly option to DEET? I found GO JO hand clearer/paste for cleaning greasy hands in the automotive department but no GO JO wipes. What type of store /department may potentially carry the GO JO wipes? From what I know nothing keeps Black flies away except for clothing. Is that your experience?
