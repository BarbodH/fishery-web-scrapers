I know it has been warm up there so anyone have any input on fishing for walleye and northern over the next two weeks. Thanks in advance for the help, This board has been a great help over the last year for me. Thanks guys !!!!"

I hit them on Hot-N-Tots as well as Bottom bouncer/Spinner combos. We found the fish near the holes in the windward sides of islands or where the wind broke. On a slow day, my brother and I caught 25 fish together and up to 100 on good days. I hope they're still biting for you."
