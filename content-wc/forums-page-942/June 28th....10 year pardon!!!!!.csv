521859,Guest,2002-06-25 17:07:00,0,Speaking of winter discussion I wonder if Phidelt 157 and his crew of DUIs made it across......Maybe he can fill us in on the adventure and how the fishing was........
521857,Guest,2002-06-26 03:47:00,0,I met two Americans in the bush here fishing and we had a drink or two together and the one was continually boasting of his travel to foreign countries. He had been to almost every country in the world and most planets within two light years. Even his partner was getting uncomfortable with his ongoing rhetoric. I had been on holiday to Cuba a year back and enjoyed the visit and asked him if he had enjoyed his stay there as he had been everywhere.......The talk quickly shifted to fishing and the poor performance of the S+P 500.
521860,Wawajake,2002-06-26 05:26:00,413,That might explain the good deals I got at the Federal Impound auction I went to last week here in the Sault. Lund boat and some tackle and even a portable Aerator.All for $2500 Canadian ( thats $500 american) Was it Phidelt 157's stuff ??:) :)(just kidding !)jake
521861,Guest,2002-06-27 12:05:00,0,Does that mean friday is the first day or saturday that you can not worry about the old dwi's? Does canada sell the good class c fireworks as we will be on the island on the 4th of july? p.s. Is it still raining up there?
