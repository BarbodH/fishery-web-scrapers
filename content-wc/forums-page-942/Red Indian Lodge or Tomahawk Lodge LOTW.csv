I like the family amenities available in addition to the fishing. My wife MUCH prefers American Plan, which would give the nod to Red Indian Lodge, but a few guys here have stated how nice Tomahawk Lodge is. With Tomahawk Lodge, is there any restaurants close by (like real close)?Both sound like nice places, but I have never been to that part of LOTW appreciate some seasoned opinions. Thanks."
521959,Guest,2002-06-28 05:34:00,0,"I have stayed at both and it totally depends upon what you are looking for. The Tomahawk has probably the nicest cabins on that part of the lake. The cabins at Red Indian are nice, but a lot older. Red Indian has more amenities and does offer the American Plan.Red Indian does charge a lot more for the amenities that they have and for me the extra money was not worth it. If you bring your own boat I believe that the charge to you was an extra $100.00 US for docking and unlimited gas.Sioux Narrows has a variety of restaurants available. The Last Resort Restaurant is very close, you can also boat over the The Yellow Bird Lodge for a nice meal. White Birch Lodge serves excellent food at a very fair price (my personal recommendation). Given everything, I would stay at the Tomahawk. Albert and Elaine Kast are tremendous hosts and their facilities are the best.Good luck."

The reason I haven't been back was that when we went out with the guide in the morning it seemed like we had to take a 45 minute boat ride before starting to fish, an the same 45 minute ride at night. I was there in spring (early june) so the boat ride may be different during other times of the year."

I wonder if there is fishing (smallies, pike etc) closeby for successful fishing after dinner or whether that would be a wasted effort.Again, thank you for both of your input."
