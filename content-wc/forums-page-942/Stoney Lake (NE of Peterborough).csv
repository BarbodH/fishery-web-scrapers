521863,Toolman,2002-06-25 13:18:00,2570,"Anyone know how the fishing is at Stoney lake, Ontario. Walleye, muskie, smallies?Thanks,Tim"
521864,Guest,2002-06-26 03:27:00,0,Rocky shorelines form many deep bays and protected coves. The northern part of the lake is peppered with rocky shoals and fish-rich weedbeds. Average depth of 6 metres with 30 metres being the deepest. Muskie is king here. Many medium sized. Lots of smallmouth bass. Walleyes are consistant right through the summer. Typical Kawartha Lake in Ontario.
521865,Guest,2002-06-26 15:03:00,0,Get a good lake map before you go there!!! It is a fantastic lake for muskies if you like to cast for them. Bucktails excell here. I'm serious about the lake map though. This place has a lot of rockpiles.
521866,bigfish1965,2002-06-26 15:54:00,3210,"Ditto the maps. Arrange the maps b4 you go. They are tough to find sometimes. Stoney is my favourite lake for all that it offers. The area around Burleigh Falls can take a week alone to fully explore and fish. There is structure EVERYWHERE. Shoals, points, holes, weeds, inflows, bends bays...everything. You can catch fish all day but the hours between 5am and 10 am and again between 8 pm and 11 pm are prime. Get a good map, turn on the fishfinder, and keep the trim up if you are unsure. The lake levels are very high this year, so some rocks that appear as above water on maps maybe partially submerged now."
521867,Guest,2002-06-27 06:56:00,0,Is there boat rentals in Stoney Lake? Thanks!
521868,bigfish1965,2002-06-27 08:04:00,3210,Try Burleigh Island Lodge for rentals. Don't know the phone number...but call long distance directory...area code is 705. They also have a motel/cabin unit which is very nice. Stayed there 2 years ago and the staff was great. They had a guide available when we were there. You may want to use him for a day to learn the spots.
521869,bigfish1965,2002-06-27 08:10:00,3210,I just did a web search and found the number. Burleigh Island Lodge-- 705-654-3441. Many people will remember this place as the Park Hotel.
