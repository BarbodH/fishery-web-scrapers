My guess is that with a lake this big, the rains will not push it too high, and I would guess the snow level would do more for the lake level, at least in the first part of the spring and early summer.Great trip with tons of walleyes, in fact, there was one day for the first 2.5 hours we were not sure we would catch any walleyes under the slot for lunch. The kind of problem I like to have!:)"

Looking forward to a good bite and some cooler weather, has been too hot and dry here in the midwest. Lot's of big fish last year, may flies were in the middle of their thing the same week last year. Don't think I've seen any may fly reports as of yet, might be a couple of weeks out yet! I'm armed and ready! Pete and Kathy are good hosts!"
