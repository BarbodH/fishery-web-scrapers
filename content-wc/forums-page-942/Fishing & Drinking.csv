521428,Guest,2002-06-14 20:11:00,0,I DO enjoy cold beer - having one right now. Leaving in 2 weeks for a 7 day fly in outpost. Does anyone else use your week in the bush to be alcohol free? Who would want to ruin a week in God's country being drunk?? Plus nothing ever tasted better than that first cold brew after returning to town!SS

Whether flying in, driving in or boating in the transport load seems to never get smaller. Ontario law doesn't agree with drinking and fishing at the same time anyway. The fish, scenery, camaraderie and escape time may be enough.7 out"
521430,Thumper,2002-06-16 12:38:00,133,I think that thats a great idea. I see too many people fishing who equate the volume of alcohol drank to the good timews they had. I am not a prude by any means but if it works for you go for it.Have a great trip!!
521431,phishfearme,2002-06-28 09:33:00,1242,if you're too drunk to fish - you may be a redneck!
521432,Guest,2002-06-28 11:05:00,0,What? Not enjoy an ice cold brew during shore lunch! Why dont you just shoot yourself now....lol

521434,Guest,2002-06-30 09:23:00,0,"Hey, you are talking about my Momma, fella!!Seriously, my boat had a noticable flaw in it. If there is alcohol in any form on it, the ignition won't work. When the alcohol is unloaded, it starts up fine."
521435,Guest,2002-07-01 16:31:00,0,Spent years fishing with the boys and being all lit up on whatever was brought out. Last year I gave up drinking in the boat while fishing and its amazing....I still had a great time and the only difference is I fish with different guys now. The other crew could not handle the new sober me in the boat. Nothing worse than a sober guy ruining a good drunk..........
