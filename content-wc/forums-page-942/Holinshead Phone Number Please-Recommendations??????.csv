521984,Guest,2002-06-30 17:46:00,0,"I have gone up to Hollinshead 5 times.. and had a blast every time. I only did the fly in thing, never stayed at the main base camp, so I can't help ya there. I can say the outpost camps are very nice. The cabins are nice and the boats run great. As far as the fishing goes..depends on the time of year.. I have gone in July and August..mid July seems to be the best. (never fished in June, so can't say if thats any better).. all you have to do is vertical jig with a leech or minnow (dead or alive), or even rubber twister tails, and you will catch fish one after another. Our last trip in 2000, we caught around 500 eyes..(just 2 guys).. all fish were around 14-27"" ..George is a good host, and Arnie is a great Pilot. Unfortunatly, do to more stringent Border crossings and an dui in my past I am no longer allowed into canada. I got through for 7 times, and on the last one they got me...paid my $150 and got one last fishing trip of a lifetime..how I miss it so :(I would reccomend Hollinshead to anyone, There is nothing like it!I hope this helps, if you have any more questions feel free to e-mail me at [email protected] good fishingKarl"
