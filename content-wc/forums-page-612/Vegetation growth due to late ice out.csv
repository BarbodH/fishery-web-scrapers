574341,back357,2008-05-27 13:14:00,106,I have a question for anyone who has been out yet. Will the late ice out have an impact on vegetation growth during the earlier part of the season? I normally hit the Ignace area in the second week of June and the vegetation is usually pretty stout by the time I get up there. Will I have less cabbage up there? Smaller plants? OR does it not really have an impact at all? Thanks for any thoughts.

574378,Guest,2008-05-28 12:31:00,0,"Several factors can affect the weed growth early in the season. When final 'ice out' occurred, water depth, and water clarity will directly affect growth of new weeds. Wind condition/direction at ice out, and ice thickness itself can also result in severe damage to an estabilished weed area. Chuck"
