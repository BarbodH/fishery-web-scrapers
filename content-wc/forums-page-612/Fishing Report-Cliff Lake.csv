574384,Rose_Cliff Lake,2008-05-28 16:15:00,116,"I missed you guys! We finally got to camp May 7th and I had no internet service until yesterday, yikes. Opening week the walleye fishing was best through the river to the mouth of Mystery Lake. They actually had trouble find eating sized fish under 18"". Many were caught between 20""-24"". The lake trout was very good on Cliff, average fish was 27""-29"" with some over 30"". I ate my first non-smoked trout. It was lightly breaded and pan fried. WOW. If you haven't tried it you should, it was excellent! One group caught 2 Muskies on a minnow and jig head, with 8lb test. They were 42 and 46 inches. Last Sunday, the 18th, was my first time out fishing this season and what a time it was. Five of us were in a large boat. I caught 1 snake northern and by the time I got it back in the water, I was getting the net for another person. Then the next one caught one. Here I was again, netting, measuring and taking pictures. The short story was, I never put my line back in again. Walleye after walleye, it was the best day fishing I've ever experienced. Get this, it started at 5:30p.m. on our warmest day so far, 70 degrees, and we were in 6 feet of water without any structure to speak of. Other than it being breezy giving the water a chop, it defied all walleye rules. I will post the pictures soon. The biggest eye was 24"" and most were males, they left quite a mess behind. All were caught on pink, yellow and orange jig heads with minnows. The water temp was just above 50 degrees. In total we caught 17 walley, 4 smallies and 3 northern in about 1.5 hours. Week 2 is a bit slower but we had a cold front move in Monday the 19th and that shut things down. For the last 2 days it's been stable and about 58-62 degress, that should start things rolling again. One 36"" musky was caught, again, 8lb test, no leader, jig head and a minnow...crazy. Some smallies and walleye along with a few snake northerns. That's it for now, Rose"
574386,idapaul,2008-05-28 18:13:00,82,Rose;good to hear from you. was kinda wondering about you. keep the reports coming.Looks like this could be a good fishing year as long as it stays on the cool side.paul
574387,Rose_Cliff Lake,2008-05-28 18:52:00,116,"Hi Paul, We had a devil of a time with the internet. Still don't have a TV, only the radio going. Getting through Customs was only 3.5 hrs, no big issues except my husband bringing 5 guns which they thought was ""excessive"". John took a 26' Uhaul the week before we both came up and could not get up the driveway because they hauled in 5000, yes 5000 yards of sand for the new septic field. He had to unload in Vermilion Bay and then came back to the states. We both left with a 12' Uhaul and got here without incident because the excavator fixed up the road enough to get in. It was cold the first week, high of only 38-40 degress but it was a great time to unpack and get the house in order. I was sooo lucky, we had Al from the island camp on Cedar Lake stay with us for a few days because the ice was still on. He helped John load at Vermilion Bay and unload the heavy stuff so I didn't have to move it. He also helped with some plumbing and electric issues while he was here. We are really grateful to have had him. For about 4 days we got sleet, snow and a bunch of rain. It made the driveway a mess and one of our first guests had to be pulled in with our truck. Amazingly enough, 2 days of sun dried it right up. The grader came and it's like a super highway now in comparision. Well I'm getting ready for the next group to arrive. I can't believe I'm saying that because it's been a long jouney getting here. 22 months to the day that we looked at the camp and now I'm finally here. I feel like I'm blessed with good fortune and the beautiful surroundings. Glad to hear from you Paul and remember my offer still stands for 2009!!"
574390,Glenman12,2008-05-28 19:19:00,762,"Hi Rose Glad to hear you made it there safely and things are going good..Ive been a customer of Al and Kim since they bought Cedar Lake Lodge (actually, the two owners before them too)..they are both great people..he is very handy and as soon as something breaks down or needs repair he is on top of it..hope the rest of your season goes well.."
574392,bpetersen,2008-05-28 20:46:00,251,"Good to hear from you, Rose. I sounds like you are enjoying yourself. Mystery was always a hot spot for use also. Do you still have to jump the beaver dam to get to Mystery?? Keep the reports coming. I love to read your posts. Hope you were able to ckeck out Ord Lake. Pete Fish Hawk/Powered By Yamaha"
574396,Rose_Cliff Lake,2008-05-28 23:00:00,116,"Pete, We had such a big boat so we went to the landing to get into Mystery. Our guests however had no trouble getting in thru the river with the 16 foot boats. I had my first experience beaver dam busting to get to Evening Lake. We did not try to get to Twilight because we ran out of time. Believe it or not, dam busting is fun. For whatever reason it's a sense of accopmplishment, man vs. nature. I'm still in awe of my surroundings. I have my desk set up in front of the window overlooking the bay. It's an amazing site. All the water and the loons calling at night. Then we take the fish remains out to the island and I can watch the eagles. I feel so spoiled!!! Don't get me wrong, we are working, a lot, but when you take a break and look over the water, it's all worth it. Best Regards!!!"
574399,Guest,2008-05-29 05:53:00,0,You sure do have a great view. You have an awesome bay.. Pete
574434,Bill Krejca,2008-05-29 15:39:00,6107,"Rose, Looks like you are off to a great start! Also that you are getting to enjoy your surroundings as well as taking care of business. Continue to maintain the balance!"
574439,Guest,2008-05-29 16:50:00,0,Hard to believe that there are still beaver dams when you try to go into Mystery Lake. It has to be over 20 years since I last fished that lake and I remember our guide (Herman) from Manotak Lodge jumping the dams with the boat. Somewhere I have a picture of him and the boat jumping the dam. Brings back good memories!
574453,Guest,2008-05-29 21:53:00,0,"The first time I saw the beaver dam I thought there was know way a boat could go over that, I was mistaken. Pete"
