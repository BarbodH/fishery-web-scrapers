574356,Guest,2008-05-28 06:03:00,0,"In case you need a little more information. I'll be leaving Chicago area in the evening on the 12th, driving up thru International Falls, and up to Red Lake. The 7 trip will run June 14th-21st. The lodge that I'll be using is Chimo Lodge out of Red Lake (see chimolodge.com). I have been going to their main camp and outposts for many years, and the fishing has always been great. I am looking for someone who is interested in fishing and can fill in for a partner on such short notice as my partner had a family illness to attend to. I don't care if you are experienced or a novice --- you simply need to be personable and want to experience some great fishing at a fly-out outpost. I can meet you in the Chicago area, pick you up along the way, or we can meet up in Red Lake. Respond to this thread if intersted!"

574382,Guest,2008-05-28 14:40:00,0,"Nope,never been to Wine Lake. I am new to this site and hoping to find a fishing parnter due to unforeseen circumstances so that I can salvage my June trip. Otherwise, I might just fish alone. Hopefully, someone else will be willing to join me!"
574388,walleye_freddie,2008-05-28 18:56:00,10,"Scott, Which lake are you going to? We had a trip for September, but that got cancelled. I've fished with Peter for about 30 years, having stopped a few years back because our group just kinda fell apart. Doug in WI"
574389,Guest,2008-05-28 19:08:00,0,"With all likelihood I will be going to the main camp and staying at Peter's cabin, unless Peter has room for me elsewhere. I was going with Nick Griffin who is a good friend of Peter and helps out at the Chicago and Wisconsin shows. Peter has said for me not to worry about where...I'll be fit in somewhere. That is why it was just Nick and I going up there. WE had it planned that way so the two of us don't take up a whole outpost if Peter could book it. Too bad he can't join me now and I have to find another partner...."
574405,sidewinder,2008-05-29 08:15:00,96,scott what kind of cost we looking at? sidewinder
574407,Guest,2008-05-29 08:25:00,0,"I would say the cost is approx $1300.00 for gas, food supplies, and camp cost if I hook up with someone in the Chicagoland area. Less if I pick someone up along the way or meet up in Redlake. If you go to chimolodge.com you can see the camp costs that is likely based on the main camp (Roderick) costs. I plan on buying necessary non-perishable supplies down in Illinois and perishables up in Red lake. Only other expense is gas cost to share depending on where I hook up with my new partner. Pretty reasonable for a fly-out in Northwestern Ontario! I've been going to Chimo for many years now and am very happy with how things have been."
574443,Guest,2008-05-29 18:30:00,0,I AM STILL LOOKING FOR A FISHING PARTNER! TWO WEEKS LEFT AND I AM HOPING TO FIND SOMEONE TO JOIN ME. READ NOTES AND RESPOND IF YOU ARE INTERESTED. I AM SURE IT WILL BE A GREAT TRIP. I HAVE BEEN GOING TO CHIMO LODGE FOR YEARS AND HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED.
574481,Guest,2008-05-30 09:48:00,0,"As in my previous post, I am still hoping to find someone to join me up for a June 14-21st trip to Chimo Lodge. I am more than happy to provide addl information about myself or the camp if necessary. To be brief.... I am 41 and have been to a wide variety of Peter's camps at Chimo Lodge over the last 12+ years. I have always had a great time and his camps have always been productive. Any questions? Ask away..... I'll go up by myself if I can't find a partner this short notice, but it is always a little more fun to have someone to share the experience. Thanks"
