With our truck it costs $40.00 dollars round trip to go Dryden, ouch. Also, the BP variety store is also our Post Office and it's 10 miles north so I could kill 2 birds with one stone."
574501,campownerchick,2008-05-30 16:21:00,13,A $100.00 American bill equals $92.00 Canadian today in the beer store in Red Lake.
574398,Guest,2008-05-29 05:50:00,0,Will I be better off exchanging American money for Canadian funds or just use American when purchasing items in Ear Falls?? Will most places in Ear Falls take American money? I will be with a large group so not using credit card. Any good place to exchange money before I get to Ear Falls? Thanks in advance for any help.
574413,Rose_Cliff Lake,2008-05-29 09:27:00,116,"There is a bank in Ear Falls, I just passed it 2 days ago when I went to the hardware store. It's just off of 105 kind of behind the IGA grocery store. It's in a strip mall with Home Hardware, Liquor Store, Wilson's grocery and then the bank. All the places I have been to during the last 3 weeks do take U.S. funds so you don't have to worry. Good luck fishing!"
574436,campownerchick,2008-05-29 16:16:00,13,If you have the time exchange your American money for Canadian funds at a bank to get the best possible rate. The beer stores will be charging a pretty price if you pay in American money. And that's just one of the places you'll be visiting.
574437,Guest,2008-05-29 16:33:00,0,"Is it worth the trouble? From what I've seen, exchange rate is about even."
574440,WalleyeCrazy2,2008-05-29 18:08:00,29,In the past years I have been just using my credit card for everything. I get the daily exchange rate and no one has ever complained about it. Also save me from having to exchange money. Works at the liquor store...
574445,deputy dog,2008-05-29 19:32:00,305,our group of four has always used one credit card for all gas purchases. we've been doing this for the past 5 or 6 years and it has worked well so far. when the card holder gets the bill we divide it by four. we still do get about $100 changed at the border for food on the way up and for licenses.

Actually the beer store exchange rate is re-set daily and is within .01 of bank rate. Yesterday the rate was 92%.
574469,MTJ,2008-05-30 07:25:00,106,I use my Visa card for everything I can. Let Visa take care of the exchange. I also stop at a bank right when we enter Ontario and take out cash from the ATM. I get charged with a $2 fee but it's quick and easy.
574472,Guest,2008-05-30 08:24:00,0,"Not worth the hassle. As of yesterday, one US dollar is .98873 Canadian dollar."
