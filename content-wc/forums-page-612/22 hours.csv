Border guards made us pull over and come inside to fill out paperwork because we did not have a passport or proof of citizenship(Birth Certificate). They stated that this was a new policy. Passports or proof of citizenship are NOT REQUIRED but, not having them will require you to stop and fill out a form and answer some questions. Took about 20 minutes."

574184,Guest,2008-05-22 14:09:00,0,Hi. last year when we crossed somewhere in montana we were the only car and with the passports it took about ten minutes. back at intl falls with no passport it took only 2 minutes. I guess when there is no line the guards are in no rush.
574368,labsrus,2008-05-28 10:50:00,557,That last day can be a real long one. Let us know how you did and how the bugs are this time of year. Our group is looking to go in mid to late May next year. We alwys go in August each year with the occasional trip in September thrown in for late season Pike.
574372,Frankm,2008-05-28 11:32:00,154,Just got back last weekend. There was 3 of us in my group. On the way back I handed the agent the 2 passports and my drivers license. She specifically asked to see my birth cert. Which I had and showed her. This was 14 years in a row and first time they asked to see it. Might want to get one to avoid delays.
574395,Guest,2008-05-28 22:53:00,0,I have to know what good is any kind of birth certificate? How do they know its you. they dont have your picture on it and if it did they still could not tell anything. in 30 years they never asked for my wifes or mine.

574119,Guest,2008-05-21 09:21:00,0,Best of luck to you Chef! I am about 24hrs behind you heading out of Kansas City. I have 2 days of work that need to be done as well; but all I can think of is hooking that first nice fish!!
574121,Guest,2008-05-21 09:46:00,0,No live bait? Not even crawlers in bedding?
574126,Guest,2008-05-21 10:54:00,0,Yes You can take worms in bedding......I just find it easier to get them in Canada..That is where most of the ones we get in the states come from anyway.
574131,Guest,2008-05-21 11:45:00,0,Phew.... 13 of us picked up 217 dozen for our trip. I spent my lunch looking for the rules and regulations. They are all in bedding.
574133,Bill Krejca,2008-05-21 11:51:00,6107,Got your insurance card stating that your car insurance is good in Canada?
574135,Guest,2008-05-21 12:04:00,0,Yup
574138,Guest,2008-05-21 13:51:00,0,Do you need a birth certificate if you don't have a passport or will a registered voters card and phot i.d. work? I've heard conflicting information.
574140,Guest,2008-05-21 13:57:00,0,We have always gone under the premise that you need birth certificate and photo ID or passport. However no one I have crossed with(lots) has ever been asked for a birth certificate
574147,Guest,2008-05-21 14:43:00,0,"I have never been asked for a birth certificate either and can't find mine. We leave tomorrow, so I am going to roll with my voter card and license and see what happens."
