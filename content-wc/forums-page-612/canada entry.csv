574496,Guest,2008-05-30 14:11:00,0,"We had a guy in our group in 2002 that had one probably 5 years before that. They gave him a bunch of paperwork to fill out if he ever wanted to return, charged him $200 Canadian, told him not to drive (it wasn't his motorhome) and they let us go in. Two years later same guy came along with us, hadn't filled out his paperwork from the previous time (hadn't even read it). He thought he'd just have to pay the $200 again and listen to a lecture. NOPE. The gal at IF went on and on about 45 minutes worth, things like ""Didn't you read any of this stuff?"" ""What have you been doing the past 2 years?"" ""What do you think this is?"" ""What are you trying to pull?"" Things like that. She told us that we would have to go back across the border and drop him off and if he was spotted in Canada without his proper paperwork he would be arrested and fined and blahdy blah. Then she went out and stopped all the traffic coming south, waved us into the line, and stood and watched us all the way across the bridge back into the U.S. Once back on the U.S. side the first question they asked us was how long we had been in Canada. We said ""About an hour"" and told why and he says, ""Pull in."" Then they started to check all our bins and boat. Then the guy checking asked why we got turned around. We told him and he stopped checking. He said if the U.S. stopped everybody from Canada that had a DUI they'd have a line halfway to Dryden. So we had to talk to the people and explain what was going on and they let us go on our way. We could have left our guy in International Falls and gone back without him, but we decided beforehad that if we got turned around we would fish in Minnesota. Besides, he was a great guy to have along, and being a restaurant cook he took good care of us in the kitchen, so leaving him really wasn't an option. Bottom line: we ended up fishing in northern Minnesota that year. We had fun anyway, used less gas, bought cheaper beer and some Jaegermeister, but the fishing wasn't nearly as good. From the people we talked to that had been up to Ontario that week, though, the fishing wasn't very good up there, either, relatively speaking. It was only great, not fantastic. Weather related, we figure. My suggestion to anyone going with a DUI is don't spoil it for the rest of your group: Jump the hoops, do what you gotta do, get it done right, so you can ALL enjoy yourselves. And if you do decide to chance it, make a plan ahead of time for what you will do if they stop the you. As you can probably tell from other posts on this board, there seems to be some inconsistency at the border sometimes. Good luck."
574370,kriplur,2008-05-28 10:57:00,37,can you vist canada for a fishing trip without a passport in 2008 ? what would i need to bring to enter ?
574371,jigman 2003,2008-05-28 11:06:00,981,"Nope gotta have one. Whoops, no you don't. Well maybe you do, but then again maybe not. Sorry, had to do it. No, a passport is not required for land travel to Canada in 2008. However, it will very likely make your journey easier if you do have one. If you don't have one, take a current driver's license and a certified copy of your birth certificate."
574383,Guest,2008-05-28 14:51:00,0,does anyone know of anyone getting entry into canada the last several years that has had a DUI.
574406,Guest,2008-05-29 08:16:00,0,"Yes, we were stopped and check a couple years ago and two of our party had past DUI's nothing was said. I'm still scratching my head on that one I thought we would be turned around for sure"
574408,Guest,2008-05-29 08:41:00,0,A better question is has anyone ever been turned away because of a DUI? I know alot of people that go up there with DUI's and none of them ever get turned away. You here about it happening on this site but I personaly never met anyone who was turned away and I know of quite a few who go with them. Just courious if anyone has had a personal experience or if it is all hear-say.
574412,Guest,2008-05-29 09:18:00,0,i am leaving today and crossing the border in the morning. on friday around 7 am. I have crossed before with a OWI in 2004 and had no problem. I am not real worried about it. I had a Differed judgment and it was almost 7 years ago.
574428,jigman 2003,2008-05-29 13:53:00,981,2008 - 2004 = almost 7?
574430,Da Beak,2008-05-29 14:14:00,140,>2008 - 2004 = almost 7? New math. It's confusing sometimes. :rotflmao:
574433,stumcfar,2008-05-29 14:57:00,451,"I think his math is a mistomeiner!!! Sorry, couldn't help that one!"
574475,Guest,2008-05-30 08:55:00,0,That 1st 6 months with the device you blow into to see if you have been drinking and allows you to start the car seems like 2 years. So 2008 - 2004 = 4 + 2= 6 which is almost 7
