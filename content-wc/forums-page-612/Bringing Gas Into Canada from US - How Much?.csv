574499,Guest,2008-05-30 14:41:00,0,"Hello: I took 60 gals. extra in jerry cans because we camp 7 miles away from the resort on an island and dont want to run back for fuel. The border guy asked me how much extra gas I had. I told him I didnt have any extra gas and that I would be using it all up. Then he asked me how much gas I had in cans, I told him 60 gals. He said I couldnt bring that much gas in. Told me not to do it again and let me through. Some of the border guys are good guys. Just glad I didnt run into a jerk. But now I still bring the cans in but fill them when I get closer to the resort."
574410,Guest,2008-05-29 09:13:00,0,"Anyone out there know how much gas (besides that in vehcile and boat)can be brought into Canada? We usually bring an extra 6 gallon container with but have always wondered how much is allowed for our own consumption while we are there. No, I am not looking to bring much more than that but with current prices and since gas is more costly than everything else related to our trip, it is nice to save some $$'s if we can. Looks like it is about $5.00/gallon after doing conversions. Booker T"

For your effort, you might save $10-30 on the cost of your entire fishing trip. Is that worth the risk and hassle? What about the room it takes up in the vehicle and the added weight while travelling? The inconvenience of filling from jerry cans? Seems rather pointless to me... Waxy"
574441,Guest,2008-05-29 18:12:00,0,WE TAKE 6----5 GALLON CONTAINERS WHEN WE CROSS THE BORDER. LASTS US A WEEK . NO HASSLES AT THE BORDER. I HEAR GAS IS ABOUT $ 1.00 MORE PER GAL/\. ???????????????
574447,Guest,2008-05-29 20:18:00,0,"Waxy, I was looking for an answer or something resembling one, not a humble opinion. We have 9 guys and haul three boats. We stay on an outpost island without easy access to refill. If we bring 20 gallons each, we don't have to make the jaunt back to the resort and pay that price, which is probably more like $6/gal. So, 60 gallons x $2/gal would save $120. Very much worth the hassle as we can buy more Canadian beer. :cheers:"

Either way, check with the resort about extra gas cans, I personally am not to thrilled about having multiple containers of gas around, a fire in a boat from a shorted elect connection with 4 or 5 6 gallon plastic cans in one of our friends boat tell me $hit happens, and losing your boat/truck for what ya save isn't worth it. Your choice, but be careful. fwiw, we've been asked several times how mich gas we're bringing in, not sure what the limit is though as we've not taken extra gas for years now. Al"

574470,Fish_on,2008-05-30 07:29:00,1856,I take three extra six gallon cans in addition to the one in the boat. We stay on an island and it is more than a half a day's drive to the nearest gas so we have to take extra gas for four days of fishing even in a 40hp Honda. I have not been asked about gas in the last four trips. Crossing my fingers for this year.
574473,Guest,2008-05-30 08:37:00,0,I have been going for 20 yrs and only been asked once(about 10 yrs ago). I had 35 gal. and nothing was done. ONe other time they opened the boat and saw the gerry cans and did not ask questions. I hope people report their experience this year on this site to help others.

How the heck am I to know that you have 9 guys, 3 boats, burn 60 gals of gas (you said 6) and stay at an island resort? Perhaps you should post something resembling an accurate question, you're more likely to get an accurate answer. Even at that - 60 gals, divided by 9 guys, times $2/gallon equals a maximum savings of $13.33 cents a person, not counting what it cost you to drag all that fuel up there. Considering what this trip is likely costing you overall, that's not worth it my books. The ONLY factor that might make me consider it is the fact that you have to pack the fuel in to the camp in containers anyway, so that hassle isn't avoidable one way or the other. I'm still of the opinion that it really isn't worth if for the average person. You can look up the answer for yourself here -http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/menu-eng.html Waxy"
