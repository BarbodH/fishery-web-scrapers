Is that bay going to give us plenty of fish or do we need to travel to the larger part of the lake? Of course we want to catch as many of every type of fish that we can. Mainly looking for Walleyes, some Northerns and maybe Smallmouth if they are in the area. Are there Muskies? If so, we may try for them for a short time. Need to keep the young grandsons into fish if possible. Appreciate any help you can give me.[email protected] Thanks, Ron"
573924,scar,2008-05-14 20:02:00,196,no walleyes in lake vermillion but your only a couple miles from the hudson boat landing on lac seul (lost lake area) and it is a walleye factory at that time of the year. scar
573929,Guest,2008-05-15 00:42:00,0,"Big Vermilion is a very deep clear water lake that has good SM Bass,Musky & Lake Trout fishing and some Northern as well,but Walleyes are scarce.However,just east of camp and across the road the Abrams/Minnitaki lakes have very good Walleye and just a few miles from Country Camping theres a public boat landing on Lac Suel with excellent Walleye & Northern,the folks at Country Camping would have all the details."
573949,Guest,2008-05-15 12:28:00,0,"Like above, you'll find no Walleye in Lake Vermillion. Go to the boat launch a few miles west of Country Camping, gravel road crossing some railroad tracks. Launch there, head north and then east or west, you'll get walleye. If anything, go to Websters Bay and fish wind-blown points. Vermillion, you'll get musky and smallies. Enjoy Country Camping, it's a really inexpensive place to stay, and they do things right there. We went there 4 years in a row, never had a bad experience. Bears don't count! Good luck, and enjoy!"

We fish Big V for smallmouths and muskies a couple days then head to Minnitaki or Lac Seul for a couple of days for walleye. You'll have the best of both. You'll catch walleye till your arm hurts. Our group will be up there the same week as you. Email me if you want. Eric[email protected]"
573955,Guest,2008-05-15 16:36:00,0,Any Tiger Muskies caught in Vermillion?
574007,Guest,2008-05-18 00:12:00,0,"Yes--We've caught tiger musky in Big and Little Vermilion.Nothing real large,35""-40"" for us,our largest ""pure"" musky was 44"" from Big Vermilion."
574393,Guest,2008-05-28 20:53:00,0,"Just returned from Lac Seul and Big V. We spent the first afternoon on Big V and caught 5 Lakers and a Tiger Musky trolling slashbaits, cranks and spoons. All fish were caught in relatively shallow water. We had little prior experience fishing Big V so we were learning on the fly. We are looking forward to returning in the Fall to get to know this lake better. As for Lac Seul, walleyes were tougher than usual to find but fish were much bigger than usual for the time of year. We landed 2 Master Angler Walleye in 3 days of fishing and lots of overs in the 22-26"" range. Fish were very shallow and the bite was generally quite light, although the bigger fish were more aggressive."
