574274,fishncamp,2008-05-24 16:25:00,49,Labatt Genuine Draft is my choice usually in Ontario.
574367,labsrus,2008-05-28 10:42:00,557,"Back in the 1980's there was a Molson ""Diamond"" beer that we really liked a lot. We went to the Beer Store the first day and picked up a 6 pack of almost everything they had in 6 packs and bought cases of other beers. Some of it was regulated to beer batter not real tasty I would like to see Diamond come back again. it has been a few years since it was not offered for sale anymore. i still have a bottle cap or two in my tackle box as a reminder of those early trips to Canada. This year will be my 31st year going started before i got out of high school"
574377,Sutsgold,2008-05-28 12:22:00,219,"This is how I see it. Labatts is 36.50 per ""weekender"" (28) Because of the alcohol content being much stronger than american, 2 canadian beers equals 3 american beers. So 28 canadian actually is about 37 american. This works out to be roughly 20 dollars per case American. That is how I justified buying 8 cases last week when I was there. Maybe someone else can comment on this, but I have never had a hangover drinking labatts. Lite or bud lite, yes, canadian yes, but never with labats. Anyone else have that experience?"
574381,Guest,2008-05-28 13:41:00,0,Can't remember. LOL I like it too. My buddy like the Maximum Ice. 7% makes it cheaper yet.
574385,lassh,2008-05-28 17:18:00,553,"Back in the old days I did incur a few hangovers from LaBatts. But I certainly deserved it. I don't drink mass quantities of blue consumables anymore, just a few each day. LaBatts Blue is better than American Beers. And I like Kokanee beer even better than LaBatts. I remember feeling pretty shaky some mornings from drinking too many Blues, smoking too many stogies and sleeping only about 40 winks at night due to the walls shaking from all the snoring and flatulant eruptions disturbing the drone of the 3 mosquitos circling from bunk to bunk. Isn't Canada great? What was amazing was how quickly the queaziness would disappear after getting a good fish on!"
574143,fishman10,2008-05-21 14:23:00,226,"your are talking to a canadian who loves beer. there are several so called cheap beers now. they are not too bad. for a buck a bottle you cant complain. they are carling,lucky,lakeport,and several others. they are best served cold, enjoy."
574151,straydog,2008-05-21 16:36:00,11,"Bring beer from home and pay the duty. Much cheaper than ""The Beer Store"". Save your duty free for the hard liquor."
574156,Guest,2008-05-21 20:50:00,0,I just called Dutchies to confirm the prices and she told me that it was actually $50/ 24pck of Kokanee and $40.00/24pck of Labat Blue. If the beer prices are regulated by the government how come I have been quoted three different prices by 3 different places? Any other comments on Lakeport or Lucky as that seems to be the way to go as we are already being charged $1.25/lb for our weight overage. And I will not travel that far and not have enough beer for a week but at $50/24pk and $23.00 in freight charges thats getting a little steep.
574158,Guest,2008-05-21 21:41:00,0,My beer drinking guests just informed me that the 40 dollar price is for canned beer. Why easily recycled and unbreakable cans cost way more than harder to recycle and nasty-when-broken glass bottles is just one more question we Ontarions have for our 'premier'.
574165,jigman 2003,2008-05-22 06:57:00,981,"Your outfitter doesn't offer a pre-flight option for your beer? Most places will get it for you (have it in stock) and fly it in ahead of time during a check flight. That way you only pay for the beer, not the $1.25 overage. I'd say if your outfitter doesn't offer this, they are only in the ""beer business"" for the money rather than for the benefit of their customers. They're flying in anyway, a couple cases of beer doesn't drastically affect the fuel consumption."
574177,Guest,2008-05-22 11:58:00,0,"My outfitter does offer that service but due to the late ice out this year he just got into camp yesterday, so he wasn't sure if he would be able to fly our beer in ahead of time this year and asked us to look into bringing it ourselves this year."
574195,Guest,2008-05-22 15:54:00,0,"I usually take a case with me as it is cheaper in the US. I find it interesting that two of the very frequent posts here seem to be conflictual. One has to do with alcohol options, the other with DUI's."
574232,jigman 2003,2008-05-23 06:10:00,981,Most (not all) guys are drinking when they are done for the day. At least most are not going for rides in the boat or car when under the influence. No law against having a couple too many when sitting on the deck.
574234,Guest,2008-05-23 06:27:00,0,"Nicely put, Jigman. I plan on being one of those guys in 6 days, 22 hours, and 31 minutes. Keep'er on the bottom, JohnB.O.A.T."
574237,Slick Willy,2008-05-23 07:14:00,36,"Beer prices are fixed throughout Ontario. Bottled beer can vary from $26.40/case up to and over $45.00 for imported or micro brews. Canned beer varies from $29.95 -$50.00. When you buy at the Beer Store you will be given the lowest possible price. Not all cans come in suitcase-style boxes. Many come only in six-packs(Kokanee is one). When you shop the Beer Store you will pay the 24 price for the 4 sixpacks but an LCBO or Agency store will have to charge you for 4 x 6 packs. I think Kokanee is $12.75/6 cans These beers come in suitcases: Blue Bud BlueLight BudLight Canadian CoorsLight(all around $40) LakeportPilsner,Honey,Light Lucky Old Milwaukee CarlingLager,Light(all around $30). The Lakeport brands & Lucky are Labatt beers & the Carling brands are Molsons. Not only bottles have deposits in Ontario. Cans are also .10 apeice. All liquor containers now carry a deposit and are returnable at the Beer Store as well."
574112,Guest,2008-05-21 08:37:00,0,http://www.thebeerstore.ca/Beers/Brandsearch.asp
574115,Guest,2008-05-21 08:54:00,0,"Carling, and Lucky are way cheaper. We bought a case of Carling for 26.00 last year and Lucky for 24. Bottles are usually cheaper than cans. You can also return the bottles back in the case to the Beer Store and get money off if you need to reload, or want to take some for home. LaBlatt honey is a good beer as well, and is usually a little cheaper than Blue. Me and 3 other guys buy our beer at the Beer store up there in Dryden, and bring our alcohol with us."
574116,Guest,2008-05-21 08:58:00,0,I forgot to mention Lakeport is pretty good as well.
574118,Obabikon,2008-05-21 09:19:00,2370,"Right now in Morson, I'm paying $22 for an 18 of blue (on sale)... $42 if you buy it by the 24 pack. So, that ends up being 27.50 for a case of blue... which is as cheap as I've seen it in quite a while."
574120,Guest,2008-05-21 09:27:00,0,A case of 24 Blue is $36.50 in Ontario. Right now there is a sale on and you get a case of 28 for $36.50 but I do not understand how any legal LCBO store or outlet can charge $42.
574123,Obabikon,2008-05-21 09:46:00,2370,"I'm not sure, I'll have to ask."
574124,Guest,2008-05-21 10:19:00,0,I personally don't see how anyone would want to drink anything but Budweiser anyway.:cheers: JohnB.O.A.T.
574127,Guest,2008-05-21 11:10:00,0,"What about buying it at that duty free place, pick-it-up by the little shack before the bridge, and pay the duty on it? I thought I was able to find their prices online before but can't seem to now. Does anyone know where to find them?"
574134,Guest,2008-05-21 11:55:00,0,The only reason to drink budweiser is to keep the beer all to yourself if you can choke it down. No self respecting Walleye Hunter drinks that crap. Try Old Vienna.
574141,Guest,2008-05-21 14:01:00,0,"Hey 2 Fisted, I don't need anybody telling me what to drink. You drink what you want, I'll drink what I want. Someday you might man up. I'm crushed that I'm not self respecting in your eyes. JohnB.O.A.T."
574087,Guest,2008-05-20 14:47:00,0,"Anyone have any info. or preference on the new Canadian Beers. I just called ahead to put in our Beer and Liquor order to Dutchies outside of Ear Falls. I asked what the current price was for Labat's and Kokanee and was shocked that Kokanee was $50.00/24pck and Labats was $40.00/24pck. But the gal at Dutchies mentioned some new beers that are $28.00/24pck, has anyone tried these and if you have which one do you like."
574088,Guest,2008-05-20 15:21:00,0,I just called only $37.00 a case for either in Fort Frances or Nestor Falls
574094,Guest,2008-05-20 16:45:00,0,There are lots of good lower priced beers.
574097,Guest,2008-05-20 17:42:00,0,"$50 for a case of Kokanee?...LOL, what a rip off. Can't you just stop at a beer store?"
574102,Guest,2008-05-21 05:34:00,0,Beer prices are regulated in Ontario. They are consistant from place to place. I have never seen $50 beer.
574107,joeman79,2008-05-21 08:18:00,417,I am sure there is one but where in Red Lake is the Beer Store? Or should we buy it in Kenora or Ear Falls. We are getting picked up at dock near Red Lake Marine Products. And does Kokanee come in a Can or just bottles only?
574108,Guest,2008-05-21 08:25:00,0,I've had canned Kokanee before
574109,Guest,2008-05-21 08:34:00,0,There is a beer store in Kenora. Blue for $36.50/case and Kokanee for $37.95/case.
574110,clemento,2008-05-21 08:35:00,48,I have seen it and paid to my outfitter. They get away with it because they will not count it against your weight if you buy from them. I can buy at Beer Store cheaper but it puts me over on weight and have to pay additional charges.
574111,Guest,2008-05-21 08:36:00,0,"LIQUOR STORE LOCATED BEHIND THE RED LAKE IGA....BEER STORE IS FOUND IF YOU TURN LEFT AT THE ""T"" AFTER YOU PASS THE RED LAKE MARINA (HEADING NORTH).IT IS DOWN ABOUT 2 BLOCKS ON YOUR LEFT...ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE MAIN BAIT AND TACKLE SHOP IN RED LAKE. JUST CURIOUS? IS IT CHEAPER TO BUY THE CANADIAN BEER THAN TO PAY THE DUTY AT THE BORDER?"
