Is it legal to take frozen smelt from the states(buying them at grocery stores, bait shops, etc.) and take them up to Canada? I looked at the regs for ontario, and couldn't find anything. Seems they would work well for both walley and northern. Will be in the red lake area. thanks."

Smelt is not there, of course you asked about frozen, I have found nothing so far in the reg's on frozen bait fish. On page 13 under Moving Live Fish is tells about cleaning smelt and that smelt spawn can easily invade new waters. I have been told by a warden that frozen smelt with spawn can still spread into lakes where they are used. Also on page 13 tells about VHS, may be another reason for not importing bait fish from somewhere else. Also depending on what Zone you are fishing in. Zone 4 on page 19 under, Other Zone 4 Regulations, Smelt may not be used as bait or possessed for use as bait. Zone 5 on page 23 has the same restriction. On page 31 it states Anglers will be checked for illegal bait. It is the anglers responsiblilty to know what species may be used as legal bait. For more information visit www.invadingspecies.com Rules have also changed for bait harvesters and sellers due to the spread of invading species. Someone must be trying to stop the spread or at least slow it down some. I know I would not want these things in the lake we fish, so we will not be bring anything from home. We used to used salted minnows, but will not anymore. Even buying bait up there may not stop the spread, but it may slow them down some. Hopes this helps!!!"
574458,Guest,2008-05-30 05:29:00,0,IT is illegal to fish with smelt in Northwestern Ontario (Red Lake area) Smelt have the ability to mix eggs an milt in a bag and reproduce if dumped in a lake. The fine is large and per smelt. Don't use them!
574461,Frankm,2008-05-30 06:19:00,154,Like others said smelt are illegal to bring. We bring frozen suckers which work great. I've seen other bring frozen chubs or ciscos.
