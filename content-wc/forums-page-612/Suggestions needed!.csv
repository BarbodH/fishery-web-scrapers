574492,Wyo Walleyes,2008-05-30 13:27:00,9,"I will be traveling for a few days in Ontario in late June and was hoping to fish for a day or two. I'll be flying into Toronto and working up in Longford Mills for a couple days. Does anyone have any suggestions for a guided trip for a day of walleyes or northerns? I don't know anything about the area, so any help is appreciated!"
