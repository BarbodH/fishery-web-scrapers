574444,Guest,2008-05-29 19:04:00,0,"Was there a year ago last fall. Three of us--mANY FIRES IN THE AREA. Ash was falling during our trip. We were the only ones on the lake. We camped on an island . When we left the road had been closed and a CO was positioned to stop incoming traffic. He asked us how we liked the lake and I told him I wasn't real impresssed--almost made him mad that I would say that. We logged a lot of fish--caught pike and eyes no trout. We fished it in later Sept. Have friends who fish it in the sumnmer and they say they do well. We are in MICH. We do most of our fishing north of the very remote village of Pickle Lake. We are very spoiled in what we know as fishing. Saw moose on McKay. Pretty lake and about 600 miles closer for us to go. Do you know about Sun Lake a few miles south of McKay????? Because it is close 600 miles one way I may go back due to the fuel cost. The water was shallow on many parts of the lake--we had an 18 footer with a 70 HP Johnson. If I go again will take a 14 and a canoe so we can get into the other parts of the lake. Maybe not a problem in the spring. Feel free to ask questions [email protected] len clare, mi."
