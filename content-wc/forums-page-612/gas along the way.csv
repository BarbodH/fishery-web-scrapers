574394,Guest,2008-05-28 21:07:00,0,Leaving for North Bay on the 6th. Looking for a way to find those better gas prices hidden off the main highways. Will take QEW then the toll road up 401 etc to North BAy. We found one station about 1 mile off the main road last year and it was 20 cents cheaper per liter. That figures to about 79 cents a gallon. With over a hundred gallons for the trip it amounts to meals up and back. I've looked on gasprices.com but there is no way to map out where the best prices are located. Any help out there???
