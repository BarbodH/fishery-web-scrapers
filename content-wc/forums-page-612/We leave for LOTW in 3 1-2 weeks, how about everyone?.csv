574101,Obabikon,2008-05-21 04:17:00,2370,"Jig, yes, that's me! With a couple of nice days, the fishing has started to turn. I'll try to get together a report."
574150,Guest,2008-05-21 16:25:00,0,"obabikon, are you actually in obabikon lake,or in the bay?? good shoreline for trolling floating rapalas in 2 weeks?? good bass and northern in the area??looking for a liitle report on what to expect for walleye and other species..let me at that crappie dock as well..see you in 2-1/2 weeks. mike"
574154,Obabikon,2008-05-21 19:55:00,2370,"I'm in the bay... camp with yellow cabins. The crappies are at the end of the dock right now. A couple of weeks of warm weather, and they'll fill it up."

574325,Guest,2008-05-27 04:27:00,0,Yes. Three guys caught 50+ crappies off the dock after dinner last night. They kept 34. The walleyes have moved onto the beaches. It can be tough to find the 15 inch shore lunchers right now. Lots of 20 inch or bigger fish. I'll try to do a better report soon.
574332,Guest,2008-05-27 09:39:00,0,"We leave for Gullrock in less than 3 days. I've got it soooo bad, I can hardly stand myself. I am at work, but am on complete shutdown. Kepp'er on the bottom! JohnB.O.A.T."

They may not be able to ever get back, so I want to make sure they're onto fish. How long of a trip is it to Ob. lake? There will be a cold one waiting on you. What time on the 12th do you arrive at Grassy?"

573911,Guest,2008-05-14 17:39:00,0,Will be heading out the morning of the 12th. We'll leave some fish for you and you'll have to buy your own beer. How long have you been going to Grassy?
573915,1shooter,2008-05-14 18:55:00,1493,This will be our 5th year in cabin #6.
573918,Guest,2008-05-14 19:24:00,0,"We'll be in cabin 6 also. Just might leave you a beer, if there's any left. We'll be on our own on the first day and guided the last 3 days. Any recommendations on where to find some nice size northerns?"
573923,Obabikon,2008-05-14 19:58:00,2370,Which guide do you use? I've known Rueben since I was a little kid!
573925,Guest,2008-05-14 20:10:00,0,"This will be just the second trip that I've used a guide. The first time was with my Dad and the guide was an older Canadian that just did it part time. He put us on fish constantly. I can't remember this years guide, but he uses his own boat."

Any recommendations on where to find >some nice size northerns? I wish I knew where the nice Northerns were. We have certainly had luck back in Obabikon lake but they are small. We mostly catch walleyes and when we do fish northerns we end up catching muskies which is fine by me. This area of LOTW really is that good for nice northerns."
574009,Guest,2008-05-18 06:06:00,0,"Shooter: Do you use a guide and, if so, who? Thinking of heading to the Thompson creek area on the first day. What area do you fish?"
574012,1shooter,2008-05-18 08:26:00,1493,We did the first year but after that we have gone on our own. The guide thing is fine but we like being on own better. There are 6 of us that fish out of 3 boats. We will fish thompson creek area and have done good there in the past. As far as the other area's we fish. We pretty much fish all over with no one particular area we go to. I usually talk to the one of the guides for some spots and advice and flip him a few bucks in return. We do go to Obabikon 1 afternoon to fish northerns. Usually once you figure out how deep they are the rest is easy. There better be a beer for me in the fridge when I get up there.

Should be ice floating around when I arrive and fresh, green weeds growing when I head out. I'll experience lots of change. I'll track walleyes and so will pike. Pike will be huge and cooperative."

573859,Obabikon,2008-05-13 11:40:00,2370,"I'm just passed the south east side of Miles Bay. Obabikon Bay leads into Obabikon lake... we're in the Bay there. I used to fish Horse Shoe for big Northerns. Haven't done that in years though... I usually fish closer to the camp... and target muskies for the most part (so, you'll be too early to do that)"
573565,Obabikon,2008-05-06 14:16:00,2370,"I leave tomorrow morning. I've spoken with several employees, and the word is the ice is out all the way to Miles Bay (however, there is still ice on Miles). From Morson to Obabikon is clear though. Also, there's a TON of water pouring into the lake. The level will be up quite a bit from last year. (at least at the start it will be) Everything's looking good, and I'll give a report once I get out to the island and have everything set up!"
573575,Hawker,2008-05-06 21:01:00,3967,"Sure will Bill! You headed to the same location, different dates?"
573582,Bill Krejca,2008-05-07 06:41:00,6107,"Yeah, but a little later. I'll be at Youngs on Sep 13. Some of the best sunrise pictures I've ever taken are from the deck of their newer cabin. When you've gone as many times as I have, you learn it isn't just about the fishing. Be sure to give a try for the crappies."
573583,Hawker,2008-05-07 07:02:00,3967,Sunrises & sunsets both are beautiful from that deck!! One of the best crappie moments ever was from the dock just below that cabin the year the tree fell into the water between the fishcleaning house and the dock!! I'll be sure and give a good report on the fishing when we get back!

573494,Guest,2008-05-05 08:53:00,0,I hope the ice is gone now and the lake comes up a little along with some warmer temps. It's finally here and we can do the initial packing. How about everyone else?
573512,rpieske,2008-05-05 12:23:00,1276,I leave on the 14th of May. Ice is out on LOTW. There were snow flurries and the temps were in the high 30's. Don't think the water is going to warm up a lot. I love the fishing after a late spring. I've always had my best years then.
573513,stevensinks,2008-05-05 12:33:00,330,We leave June 6. One month and one day to go. Cant wait.

What do you guys think will be the rule as far as patterns go? Shallow? Super shallow? I know the lakers will be in close. I assume the walleyes will be there along with the northerns."

573562,Hawker,2008-05-06 13:52:00,3967,"Leaving the afternoon of the 22nd, headed for Young's on LOTW and will arrive the 23rd. It seems (if memory serves correct) that some of the best fishing for bigger eyes & northerns that a late spring has produced better for us. Don't know for sure, don't really care, it's all about getting away, enjoying the day, meeting new fishing friends and re-living some good ole times with some long time fishing friends!"
