562799,Mohleye,2007-01-15 17:26:00,368,"I have not stayed there, but am familiar with the area and the camp. Have met the owner, and he seems a decent sort. WLL is reached by driving a gravel mining/logging road northeast out of Ear Falls approx 40 miles to a landing. The road is pretty well maintained, condition varies from fairly good to excellent. The campowner picks you up in his boat, the camp is approx another 30-40 minutes by water. I'm sure you could bring your own boat as well, but the road puts a lot of wear and tear on boats and especially trailers. You'd also need to be pretty confident in your navigational skills. Woman Lake has good walleye and northern fishing, as well as lake trout. I'm not sure if there are smallies in the system, but at least one of their portage lakes has catch and release smallmouth fishing. There is a lot of water in the Woman River system, and it is far from crowded. WLL is not a remote fly-in however. There are other camps on the system, including Woman River Camp, Kabeelo's, Canada North, and South Bay, as well as a few private cabins. I believe most of Canada North burned down this past winter. I know they have a website, I'm sure the owner could refer you to some recent clients for more information."
562800,Guest,2007-01-15 18:49:00,0,"For some clarification to Mohleye's post... The Woman River system does hold smallmouth, some of good size. The walleye and pike fishing I would consider fair at best, from a relative, regional perspective. Woman River and Canada North are on the same system as Woman Lake. Kabeelo's and South Bay are on the neighbouring Confederation Lake system, and do not fish the same water (in fact Kabeelo's is almost exclusively a fly-out to other, smaller lakes, and they very rarely fish Confederation Lake). It was South Bay that burned in October, not Canada North! NWO Fishing Bum"

562807,Mohleye,2007-01-16 10:28:00,368,"Sorry for the misinformation. I read about South Bay burning on this forum earlier, but got my camps confused. Should have taken the time to do a search. I believe the camps on Confederation can and do occassionally access the Woman River system via portage. At any rate, what I was trying to say was that although WLL is pretty remote, you are still going to see some boat traffic."

562591,Guest,2007-01-06 20:36:00,0,"We have been fishing manitou for the last 7 years and love it. There are no walleyes, but we have great smallmouth fishing with lots of 17+"" fish. Not to dispute with what bill said, but we have had better lake trout fishing on this lake for size and numbers than any other trout lake withing 200 miles of it and our group has been doing trips to canada for 27 years. We stayed at both camps on the lake, barker bay for 4 years and camp manitou for the last 3 years. Can't wait to get back up there."
562593,Guest,2007-01-06 21:05:00,0,"We have used the same boat in camp the last 5 years near Armstrong--further east than the area you're looking at. We fish Caribou Lake with Caribou Lake Lodge--we go the last of July 1st of August each year. Eyes are on the reefs in 22-30 feet of water, and we have always done quite well using leeches and techniglo fuzz e grubs. Cabins do not have electricity and only cold water to kitchen sink. Very nice central shower house, 16' Lund boats, 20 HP Merc at $225 per week plus gas. Cabins are $600 per week. There are northerns though we target walleye, and there are also lake trout. There are also some boats cached on some portage lakes, though we have fished only one and preferred the main lake. Caribou is around 28,000 acres with 2 other outfitters. For the money, I've not had better fishing, and I've been going every year since 1978. The fly in lakes we used to use provided more fish, but I'd rather spend half the money and stay twice as long. Heck, you can only eat 4 per day and return the rest anyway. They have a website, but right now it only contains basic info like phone numbers and addresses. http://cariboulakelodge.com Hope you find what you are looking for-plenty of choices."

562684,Guest,2007-01-11 05:41:00,0,"I have traveled up to Lac Seul the past few years and have really enjoyed every visit. We travel to the northeast corner and fish out of Lac Seul Outposts. Ken and Brenda are the owners there and are quite nice. Only trouble is reserving a spot early enough to accomodate when you want to go. Fishing was a little tough last time I was there in July, but did find plenty of fish after a little bit of ""work."""

I am looking to go to Nungesser and the owner of Nungesser Lake Lodge was very personable. I will probably go with him just because he was such a great guy.

Chad and tanya are great hosts and the fishing, well going in june or july its not uncomon to catch 100 walleye a day (on a great day) fish between 14"" to the biggest I have personally caught was 33"". the pike fishing is also very good but target mostly walleye when we go.Use minnows & night crawlers."
562419,Guest,2006-12-23 22:08:00,0,"I have a group of guys that have fished Lac Seul, Rainy, and Minaki. Some of the group wants to try a more remote trip, but do not want to fly in. We are looking at boat in resorts. We have it narrowed to the following four resorts. Ghost River Separation Lake Lodge Wine Lake Peffleys Wilderness Camp I am looking for people who have been to these camps and am interested in how the fishing is in late July, how the cabins are, how are the resort boats, and how friendly are the owners. Or, if you have another boat in place in the same area I would appreciate it."
562421,Guest,2006-12-23 23:28:00,0,"We are going winter trout fishing to Camp Manitou, we just received our reservation sheet with a couple of brochures. The company owns 2 resorts and they both look like remote boat ins. The website for the one we are going to is www.campmanitoufishing.net and the other one is Happy Landing Lodge and the website is www.happylandingfishing.com If we have a good time at the winter camp, we may try the other one in the summer for walleyes."
562422,Guest,2006-12-24 10:01:00,0,"Hi NH, I can only comment on Wabaskang. I have fished the lake for the last 10 years in SEPT. Generally it is great fishing, good weather and the fish are generally in the same area and don't move around alot. We stay at Peffleys Camp. It has running water,electricity, showers etc. The boats are well cared for and perfect for most walleye presentations. The cabins that we have stayed in are well kept and clean, Dave, the owner, is a great guy and will do what he can to make your stay a good one. Now for what you really want to know: This year a couple of us went up the third week in July for the first time. The fishing was different than in Sept. The fish were shallow 8-14 ft. and scattered. You really had to keep moving to find them, once you did find them, they didn't stay there long. We did have one 100+ walleye day but the norm for us that week was more like 20-25 fish between 3 guys. The weather was HOT and the water was down 2-3 feet from normal (maybe more than that) If I were to make a second trip again it would be in Aug. Wabaskang is huge and there a million places to try fishing. Good perch action, lots of Pike ( usually catch one in the 38-40 inch range and I don't fish for them! thats on my walleye set up) and good small mouth action if that is what you are after. Also you can protage the boat down to Wine Lake if you want to. Easy to make a day of it checking out Wine. Take Care. Merry Christmas."
562439,Guest,2006-12-26 19:13:00,0,"I have been to Wine Lake 5 times. It doesn't have all the amenities that other camps have like running water, indoor bathrooms, electricity but the camp is very nice. Most of the cabins have been updated and they have propane frigerators and stoves in them. They have wood burning stoves inside each one and propane laterns are your electricity for the week. They do have a shower house that people can use. The boats are 16 foot lunds with 25 mercs. Very nice boats and can handle pretty rough water. The owners are great. I go in June so I couldn't give you info on the fishing in July. It is remote because there are only 7 cabins in camp and it is the only camp on the lake system. You can fish 7 different lakes and they aren't as huge as Wabaskang or Lac Suel. We do see a lot of Wabaskang boats during the week down on Wine. Any other questions please email me at [email protected]. Scott"
562441,Newby,2006-12-26 21:23:00,148,"Been to Ghost river a few times. Nice place, plenty of eyes, something like 13 diffrent lakes to fish, and nice cabins and boats. The eyes would be firmly planted on the reefs and should be a blast by mid/late July. You can look-up more about it in the archives. Some people found the owners less than freindly, but I thought they were nice. Will be going back this year early June. Hope this helps."
562504,Guest,2006-12-30 23:36:00,0,"I was at Ghost River camp early August 2005. Stayed at there other camp called Sturgeon River Camp. The cabins are nice, the fishing was great, all the walleyes were stacked up on reefs, and rock piles. Once you found them you could catch as many as you wanted. I thought the people staff were very friendly. Donnie runs the Sturgeon River camp helped us plan our days by marking spots on the map, never steered us wrong, caught all the walleyes we wanted. fished a different area or lake every day. If you go use minnows, plastics didn't work very well."
562512,Guest,2006-12-31 14:00:00,0,"Peffleys camp and owner Dave are top notch all he way. Fishing in late July can be and usually is excellent for walleye, Northerns, perch and small mouth. The major mayfly hatch is usually over by then, which will slow down the bite. Peffleys is a small boat-in camp where you will get to know Dave and his staff on a more personal note. Cabins, boats, motors all top notch clean and in excellent running condition. The easy portage over to wine where Dave can show you where to fish is a excellent day trip for your group. Dave also has a walk in portage lake called lost lake that is catch and release only for huge walleyes and northerns. I have caught in abundances five to eight pound walleyes there and know of many Northerns released there between 38 to 45 inches long. Give Peffleys a try you won't regret it"
562516,Guest,2006-12-31 23:03:00,0,"I have been to both wine lake and Happy Landing Lodge. Both are nice, but Happy Landing is alot more modern and has much better smallmouth - which is what our group mainly targets. I'm not sure about the wine lake website, but the other one is www.happylandingfishing.com I'm sure you would like either one. good luck"
562580,Guest,2007-01-06 11:24:00,0,"I've fished Manitou about 3 times, no walleye to my knowledge. A nice lake but fishing not so good, over-populated smallmouth, lake trout run sparse as well."
