We fished Gullrock Lake 12 to 15 hours per day. The walleye bite was solid with the experienced fisherman catching up to 50+ walleyes per day each. Great size on the fish between eater to 26"". The pike were a significant letdown, with very few coming on artificials, the few that were caught, were caught on minnows with jigs/lindy rigs. The weather was very frustrating but we still had a good time. See the Gullrock thread for a more detailed report."
541203,PigBoy,2004-06-28 10:23:00,120,"We fished Longbow Lake and the weather was about the same and we did as well as could be. Midweek, we got into the bigger fish with the largest being 26"", all caught on live bait rigs with either leeches or crawlers in surprisingly shallow water 10 to as shallow as 5 feet. Most of the eaters were out to 20 feet on the flats"
541209,SoDakMac,2004-06-28 11:41:00,218,"A party of seven just returned from Sydney Lake, Ontario (20 minutes flying time NW of Minaki). The weather was horrible at best. We had rain, wind, cold and even hail for five straight days  in various combinations. The fishing was actually pretty good considering the conditions and difficulty with boat control on reefs, etc. We caught a lot of fish in the 18- 24 slot, with very few below 16. The largest walleye caught was 26 but many above 20. We found a few pike and did pickup one lake trout. The walleyes were deep (16'-24') most of the time and we used 3/8 oz. jigs because of the wind and depth. Chartreuse out performed other colors  perhaps because of the sky conditions. Night crawlers worked very well. We did use some spinners and Lindy rigs which also caught fish on the really windy, bad days. The water level in the system was very high. I thought we did very well considering the cold front conditions but it was miserable weather to fish 10+ hours per day in."
541216,Gameday,2004-06-28 16:14:00,5,"Just returned from a 7-day stay at Hammerhead lake. Party of 7 and had almost identical results as the people who posted previously. Rained non-stop and didn't see the sun the entire time. Glad we all had rain gear and warm clothes. Caught many 18"" to 21"" Walleyes with few smaller than that but several between 22"" and 26"". Caught most of them on 1/4 oz and 3/8 oz black jigs with live leeches or pumpkinseed gulp (minnow grub). A few guys raved about their success with minnows and crawlers as well. Caught several Northerns trolling cranks and on spoons (mainly red and white daredevils). Latched into several Lake Trout but didn't land any. Despite the rain we had an awesome trip!"
541224,Stehle,2004-06-29 04:49:00,95,"My group of eight just returned Saturday from Allanwater Bridge (Lake Kawaweogama), which is a puddle jump east of Savant Lake. Weather was as described by everyone else. I've seen it worse but most years the weather broke once in a while. The bite was slow but fish were there. We caught anywhere from 2-3 dozen Walleye per person per day. The big fish in the group was 26.75"". I landed two 23"", a 22"" and several just over 20"". Finding fish between 17"" and 18"" was tough, but doable. Boat control was a pain in the patooty with the wind. Positioning on the reefs and breaks was difficult. My boat trolled too fast in forward and would get pushed around in reverse. Thank God for Ibuprofen every night to ward off the wrist pain. We generally bottom bounce with some crankbait trolling. The bite was too lite for crankbaiting and ended up bouncing most. BTW, I LOVE GULP! I didn't use any live bait, but it didn't seem to help(comparing to the rest in my group that did). We caught fish as shallow as 3 feet and as deep as 16 (One of my 23"" was in a rapids eddy). The last day, just screwing around, we trolled Williams Wabblers(smooth silver/gold or gold) in order to entice a big Pike....We caught more Walleye on them than Pike. That was in 6 feet of water. The tough part here was trolling too close to shore. The Mosquitos were voracious. Thank God only my hands and head were exposed from my Guide Wear. Anyway, fun was had by all but not the greatest of all weeks. Still, though, I hated coming off the lake for another year."
