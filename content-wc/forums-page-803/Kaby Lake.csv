541401,Ketchenanny,2004-07-05 11:53:00,38,Fished out of Pine Portage the end of May. Did real good again this year. Three of us fished five days and had a total of 303 walleyes and 46 pike. Almost all of the fish were within the slot limit. Never fished the lake later than the second week of June and always have had good luck.
