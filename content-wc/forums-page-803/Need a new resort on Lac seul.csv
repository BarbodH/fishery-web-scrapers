You can check them out at www.witchbay.com Take a close look at the FISHING PROGRAM, FISHING REPORTS AND GABBIN WITH GAIL pages to get a flavor of what they offer and how their significant percentage of return customers feel about the place.

Any help would be great.. We pay about $400/night and we bring in all of our own baots and bait and food. We need to find a cabin to fit 12 adults. If you have any ideas on a place to stay up there and it doesnt even need ot be on Lac Seul leave me a line or a website!! Thanks"
541152,Guest,2004-06-25 10:12:00,0,"Give Onaway Lodge a call. Blair built a new ""cabin"" that sleeps 15. It's simply awsome. Onawy is 1 mile off the blacktop of highway 502, just south of Ear Falls. The phonew number is 1-888-662-9291. Ron"
541155,Guest,2004-06-25 11:29:00,0,"I agree! I have stayed at Onaway for years now, and really enjoy it. Blair and Kathy are great hosts. I stayed in the new cabin this year for the opener and it fantastic; you need 10 or more to reserve it. I have it reserved for next years opener and I can't wait. The other cabins are good to stay in also. The fish cleaning facility is very nice. He has free ice and plenty of freezer space. Blair also enforces the ""over the slot rule"". Meaning that they want you to keep fish under the slot only,and keep a trophy only to be mounted. Blair is alos helpful on giving advice on where to fish. What time of year do you go? best of luck!"
541156,Guest,2004-06-25 12:04:00,0,"I spend a week in June and then a shorter trip in September. Been going to Onaway for the past 12 years, just love it. Ron"
541168,Guest,2004-06-25 19:14:00,0,"Orange Crush Guy; You sound familiar. Did you put a new Tahoe through the ice in Buffalo MN. this winter? ""What a Putz!"" There are several lodges at the other end of Lac Seul that are great. Onaways has been around for years and is quite nice, Timberlane Lodge is good, Golden Fawn. Stay tuned in, I'll get you some web sites. I used to live in Ear Falls and have a buudy that lives on the lake. I would book it real soon because a lot of groups book next year when they are there this year. Highway 105 is paved all the way to the lodge. The speed limit on 105 is only 80 km (50 mph), unless you are passing a moose then you can go faster. Watch out for the local Ear Falls OPP. They are right out of recruit school with their fresh buzz cuts and love to give out speeding tickets so they can get brownie points and get back to southern Ontario. (ed. note: They don't know what they're missing up in God's country) If you are looking for a camp for a group of 12 that shouldn't be a problem. Getting all 12 into 1 bed would be, though. I heard you guys are a close group. Keep spending your 'dead presidents' up here every year to catch the same ""catch and release"" fish. By the way; this one goes out to all Americans: What's the connection to our Malkins Strawberry Jam, Maple syrup, and chewy Caramel. Apparently you guys load up with this stuff at the border going home. Is this a great place our what!!! Keep your rod tip up. GD (a former US green carded resident)"
541176,Orange Crush Guy,2004-06-26 21:39:00,13,"Yes that is me that you may have seen on your local news last Dec. I did put my Tahoe in the lake! My wife is just starting to talk to me now!! Thanks for all the great info on the resots in that area! I do love to fish Lac Seul, but like I said before some of the roads on the way to Sioux Lookout are in real need of fixing. I will be looking into booking a trip the last part of next June up there. We like to go during that time. As for the Jelly at the border , you are correct!! What the Heck!! You can get the same stuff at Fleet Farm in the USA...My father inlaw actually bought some this year..He is the real PUTZ!! Have a good one...Got any pampers??? Boy are me feet warm with the mocasins!!! See you later"
541219,Guest,2004-06-28 18:20:00,0,"Orange Crush Guy; Troll down to the bottom of this page and you'll see a comparison of Timberlane and Evergreen lodges just out of Ear Falls. Can't go wrong at either place. You may even see me fishing off my buddy's 50 ft houseboat next year as you leave the lodge. You can limit out on walleye underneath the train bridge just upstream from the lodge. Watch out for the marked reef just past the bridge. Well marked. Too many people have it as a ""waypoint"" and head for it for the wrong reason. If I were you guys, I'd try a new lodge next year. I'll be in the TC next week on a golf vacation. I'll look for a clean Tahoe!! I'll look you up and give you more info. I'll bring some Labatt's!!! Signed, ""My Johnson's a 9.9!"""
541244,Guest,2004-06-30 09:38:00,0,"I too would recomend calling Blair and Kathy at Onaway. We stayed there twice last year and will be in the new big cabin again this august. They run a very clean camp with good service and advice on where the fish are biting. Very nice people, give them a try."
541258,Guest,2004-06-30 17:13:00,0,heading up to camp mahkwa july 9. just wondering how the fishing was.
541266,Orange Crush Guy,2004-06-30 21:30:00,13,Well the fishing was pretty slow when we were there 2 weeks ago..A stiff NW wind was all we could handle. The 1st day and a half it was 70 degrees and the water temp was 60..then the cold moved in and the water temp went to 53 degrees in 1 day. We still caught fish but we did have to work for them. How is the fishing near Ornway lodge? Do you have to go very far to get into them?? Where we saty at Mahwka it is a ver short boat ride to the hot spots!!
