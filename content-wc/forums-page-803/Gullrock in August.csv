I was trying to find a map of where exactly Poplar Point is on the lake, and familiarize myself with the lake in general. I don't know exactly how big it is and what parts are reasonable for us to get to by rental boat. I always like to make the trips intesesting for my kids, so if anyone know some neat places to check out please let me know. Maybe some channels to manuever through or indian rock paintings or good moose areas? Or a good island to explore. They like that stuff. Thanks."

That will be me. I can help you out with some spots to begin catching walleyes. As far as navigating on the lake, the lake is 5-7 miles long and sits southwest to northeast. It can get stirred up if you get a strong south wind. You should have no problem getting to the places you want to go with a camp boat. I would say the majority of the people who fish Gullrock while I am there fish out of camp boats. Things to do other than fishing. I would suggest asking Grant and Bev when you get to camp. They live there year round and would know of any sight seeing type of places. If you don't mind fighting the mosquitos, and enjoy Blueberries, they are coming ripe about that time and Bev can give you some ideas on where to find some. I just received an email yesterday from her and she mentioned they had a bear in camp the last two days so you might want to bring your camera for an action photo!!! :-) I am already not sleeping at night in anticipation for our trip! I hope you and your boys have a great time!!!"

541250,Guest,2004-06-30 11:44:00,0,"Renn, I will certainly stop by and visit. Bev told me none of the campsites were reserved now for Aug. so I doubt a reservation is necessary. I have a rockwood pop-up camper. Can you tell me where Poplar Point is in relation to the other lodges out there? The only landmark I know is South Bay. Where is Poplar Point in relation to that? I also found another campground on the lake as a backup. We are going to try to make the drive in one shot, so would be arriving late night on Saturday. Fish Sunday-Wed. Leave Thursday AM. Looking forward to making it a fun trip for the boys."

541256,Guest,2004-06-30 15:05:00,0,How do you do casting for Pike on Gullrock (Quantity and Size-Daily)?
541285,Renn,2004-07-01 18:46:00,87,"Larry, Gullrock is an interesting northern lake. We have had tremendous northern fishing some days and other days we have been skunked. Two years ago I caught 4 northern out of one weedbed within 1 hour of each other. The smallest was 36 inches the largest was 43. As far as numbers I am not a good person to ask because I am casting large suicks, mantas, muskie bucktails, and giant jackpots. Those size baits have a tendency to eleminate the smaller fish. I would have to classify Gullrock as a trophy northern lake. The average size fish we catch is around 36 inches. We don't catch tremendous numbers of those fish I would say we average 1 or 2 a night. That is another point, I only fish northern in the evenings. If a person would fish northern hard I would think you could catch better numbers. Renn"
