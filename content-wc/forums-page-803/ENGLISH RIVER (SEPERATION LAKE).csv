541245,Guest,2004-06-30 09:50:00,0,"We had some tough fishing the past week. The weather was terrible. Rain every day and cold. A couple days the highs were in the upper 40's. The fish are still scattered and not in there summer patterns yet. We everntually found the walleye, but had to work for them. The best spots were the points going into Moose bay and narrows, the point and sand flat going into Jim's bay and the points going into Seymore bay down in Lount Lake. We also caught fish in the main point going into East bay and the point and narrows by the burn area. Barneys did not produce until the last day. I guess Heart shaped bay and 9 foot bay started to produce last Thursday. We didn't make it down there to fish it for ourselves. Nearly all our good fish were caught with small jigs tipped with either a leach or half a crawler. We tried everything and a finesse approach was the only way to catch numbers and size. All in all a good trip, but the weather was brutal. Our biggest eye was 25 inches and we only caught 15-20 above 18 inches. They ran much smaller than normal this year. The norherns (other than hammer handles)were not biting well. My brother did manage an 18 pounder, but that was it for big norts. The smallmouth were starting to spawn and that was a tough bite as well. I am heading to Lac Seul in august, hopefully the weather will be a little more stable then."
540587,Guest,2004-06-11 08:28:00,0,"Our group will be at Separation Lake the 19-25th. Any information would be greatly appreciated. What is the water level? Are the fish in the bays, points or narrows? What is the water temp? Anyone going down to fish Launt lake, if so where would you recomend? We have fished Separation on two other trips in recent years so we are somewhat familar with the lake, but have yet to really explore Launt Lake. Thanks in advance for any help, Old Coot"
540681,Guest,2004-06-13 23:03:00,0,"COOT,GOT BACK FROM SEP.LAKE ON SAT.THE WATER LEVEL IS UP.NO WEEDS IN THE BAYS AND THAT SUCKS FOR NORTHERN.THE WIND WAS FROM THE EAST ALL WEEK SO SOME OF MY HOT SPOTS WHERE NO GOOD.WE DID NOT GO TO LOUNT LAKE THIS YEAR BUT SOME GUIDE BOATS DID.GO TO HEART SHAPE BAY IN LOUNT THATS WHERE ALL GUIDES GO MOST OF THE TIME.IF YOU KNOW THE LAKE POST BACK AND WE WILL TALK? HAVE A GOOD AND SAFE TRIP.FISH CLOSE TO SHORE FOR THE PIKE AND SMALLIES.ON THE POINTS AND ROCKY SHORE LINES."
540692,Guest,2004-06-14 08:12:00,0,"Thanks for the information Big Bob. Yes, I know the lake to some degree. I have spent two weeks on the lake, but it was 3 years ago since I was up there last. We have fished much of the lake, but not alot of Lount. I was told by someone else that heartshaped bay was where to go also. We have done very well in the past right around the corner from camp in back bay, but with no cabbage I'm not sure how that will be. Barney's point area has also been real good to us. There is another area I remember that was also good for both pike and walleye and I'm not sure what it is called. It was kind of up in the Northeast portion of the lake. There was a narrows you go through then a long bay that runs to the east as I recall. We are leaving Friday. Any further suggestions would be greatly apprciated. We have never done real well on the smally's, but would like to. We are not just walleye fisherman, although we spend the most time doing this. We love to go after pike and smally's also. Again thanks for you help Big Bob."

540757,Guest,2004-06-15 09:29:00,0,"Just returned from One Man Lodge. The fishing was out of sight. We caught so many walleye and northerns and a few smallies. It was my first trip for walleyes and northerns and I got a 28"" and a 29"" walleye. One guy in our group landed a 44"" northern on a jig and minnow with 12# line. What a trip!!"

540919,Guest,2004-06-17 12:48:00,0,"Your Correct. That was the year. I'll never forget coming around and going through the narrows. It was rough, really rough. I had to turn around and go back and get the guys in that red lund. They were getting swamped. They ran right on my tail as I broke waves with the Ranger. Rained dam near the whole week that year. I will be home this evening, anytime after 6:00 or so and would welcome your call. Look forward to gabbing with you."
