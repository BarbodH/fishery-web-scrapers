541149,Guest,2004-06-24 22:49:00,0,"Dave, Yes, bay is on the western section of the Gouin. Received an invite by a group of guys who moose hunt out of Lake Herbert and wanted to give the fishing a whirl. Unfortunately the outfitters camp was booked on Herbert so they deceided to go to the Gouin. Can't say a bad thing about the trip or accomidations. Fish would be aggresive most of the day even with the changes in weather patterns. Caught fish in baby blue skies and as well in torrential rainstorms. Northerns seemed to get more active the last day we were there shutting down the walleye bite at times. General, We took the road into Parent and then to Clova. We tried the other road to Clova on the way home but found it to very rough and doesn't seemed to have been grated in a long time and there is alot of overgrowth. We turned around after a short drive and deceided to go back through Parent. Be careful because these roads do punsih your vehicle if it is not in good mechanical order. Saw several cars and trucks with there tires sheered off the hubs as well as many trailers broken down. Had one inpatient car pass us with a camper trailer and found him broken down about a half hour later. Total drive time to Clova through Parent is anywhere from 3-4 hours. Hope this helps..."

541311,Guest,2004-07-02 18:52:00,0,"I have a question for you concerning the coloration of a couple of walleyes we caught fishing the Mattawa Bay area. The fins and bodies on a few of the walleyes seemed to have a bluish tint, almost turquoise in color. Are they a different strain of walleye or is it some genetic freak of nature. Thank you, Tom"

""There is a lot of lakes in the region where we do find some ""Blue Walleye"", a couple of years ago we had some DNA analysis from a sample of some yellow and blue walleye from lake White Pine in the Restigo zec. The results show no genetic difference between the two colourations. I have included an article relating that Blue Pike and Yellow Walleye are the same fish"". The article Catch this: Walleye, blue pike the same fish 07/19/03 Bill Sloat Plain Dealer Reporter Cincinnati - After laboriously examining DNA from a dozen blue pike specimens stored in museums, federal researchers are prepared to report next week that they cannot detect genetic differences between those fish and the walleye swimming in Lake Erie today. In effect, the finding means that the lake's legendary blue pike were probably nothing more than modern walleyes of a different color. People used to catch blue pike by the garbage-can-full, and the fish were famed for succulent meals. But by the 1960s nobody could catch them anymore. Now the government-run DNA tests show there was probably no such thing as a true blue. A summary of the lab report obtained by The Plain Dealer says that ""analyses of each gene region separately suggest little, if any, genetic differentiation exists between individuals of suspect blue pike and walleye."" It adds that ""these data suggest that the blue pike is not a distinct evolutionary unit from walleye."" The report will be formally presented Monday in Madison, Wis., when experts from 30 nations gather to discuss the status of fish in the Great Lakes. A goal of the meeting is to identify priority areas for research on yellow perch and walleye, whose numbers may be declining, while measuring the impacts of invaders such as round goby and ruffe, whose numbers are increasing. Some scientists and sportsmen's groups hoped that blue pike could be found and restored in the lake. The U.S. study was aimed at aiding management decisions if the fish were rediscovered. Those hopes would appear to be damaged, since, as yet, there is no evidence that blue pike are genetically different from walleye. The comparisons involved a dozen blue pike specimens. The specimens come from Ohio State University and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's vast collection of native North American animals that were caught between 1940 and 1952, and scores of freshly caught walleyes. The researchers were surprised not to find significant differences when two mitochondrial DNA genes from blue pike and walleye were sequenced and compared, said Cheryl Morrison, the geneticist at the U.S. Geological Survey's aquatic biology laboratory in West Virginia who will present the report. A third DNA region known as S7 also was examined, Morrison said yesterday in a telephone interview. ""We didn't see anything different,"" Morrison said. ""Some people just won't like this answer. They would prefer that it is a distinct subspecies that could somehow be brought back."" Carol Stepien, an aquatic biologist who heads the Great Lakes Environmental Genetics Laboratory at Cleveland State University, said yesterday that she has been conducting similar research on specimens from other museums, including the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, and her results seem to match what the government scientists found. ""Although I haven't finished analyzing my data, what I've found is that the museum specimens are still within the normal realm of walleye. There are all kinds of different colors of walleye, but they're no different. I just haven't seen any important differences genetically between blue pike and walleye,"" Stepien said in a telephone interview. In the late 1990s, Stepien found that blue-colored walleye caught recently in Canadian lakes had the same DNA as Lake Erie walleye. That meant the Canadian fish weren't true blues, either. ""I'm not sure there is such a thing as a true blue pike,"" Stepien said. ""I would say it's more like a color that you got in deeper areas of the lake that occurred naturally. It's like having a brown puppy or a white puppy or a yellow puppy. All the puppies are the same except for the color."" Blue pike once were one of the most plentiful and popular food fishes, flourishing in the deepest waters of Lake Erie, the Niagara River and Lake Ontario. Commercial fishermen caught more than 3 million pounds in 1885, old records show. Between 1950 and 1957, the annual take rose to 26 million pounds. Less than 200 pounds went to market in 1964. Eventually, the United States and Canada each declared the blue pike extinct. Old reports show that walleye caught today were called ""yellow pike."" The deeper-water fish was the ""blue pike."" It wasn't until 1926 that scientists formally declared they were different. Gary Isbell, who heads Ohio's fisheries research and management programs, said it's time for anglers and scientists to give up the quest for a blue pike. ""We've got serious issues on Lake Erie with other species,"" Isbell said. ""The blue pike are gone. It's time to get over it."""
541369,Alces,2004-07-03 19:36:00,35,"Dave, you don't have to get your licence in advance, l'Oasis du Gouin is a licence distributor and you will get them there as soon as you arrive. I might get some time to see you as I am very busy from the 15 till the 19 th but after that I will have some free time, you might enjoy a guided visit of the Gouin, like the one I gave McQ last august. Essoluxious: blue walleye don'y exist at the Gouin, this is a coloration some fishes get from the kind od food tgey usually eat, they are more visible at this time of the year because the food is more avalable, we seldom see them in late august early september. It also has something to do with the water color and temperature...although they don't OFFICIALLY exist, they are very nice when mounted."

541375,Guest,2004-07-03 22:45:00,0,"Retire55, Thank you for that informative information. I assumed that it was just a difference in coloration and not a seperate sub species. Hear many stories from my father in law about the days of fishing Lake Erie and catching blue pike. Showing him the pictures of the blue eyes we caught brought back many memories for him. As he put it they would catch blue pike by the buckets in the good ole days. To bad back then they really didn't realize the importance of limiting your catch since many people used it as a food source for there families. Thanks again, Tom"

541057,BillA,2004-06-22 14:35:00,5,I'll by staying at Air Melancon Pointe Du Nord camp starting on July 1st. I've been reading the posts here for the last week or two and I'd like to thank McQ and Alces for the wonderful info they post. The map that Alces points people two is just awesome. I can't wait until I get there. The question I have is will I be able to navigate up the Neimo River from Baie Du Nord. The map kind of looks like it's possible. Any other tips or hots pots anyone would like to share on Baie Du Nord would be very welcome. Thanks...BillA

541063,McQ,2004-06-22 19:36:00,615,"Hi BillA, you're going into a great spot on the Baie du Nord, Air Melancon runs a real nice operation and yes you can access the Nemio river. It will likely be a couple of miles north of your camp depending on the cabin you have.. The caretaker will be able to point you in the right direction. the Baie itself has a tremendous fishery so don't be afraid to ask him the questions when you arrive. I'm pleased that you like the info posted here and will do my best to keep it coming. The maps that Alses and I recommend are available here on WC, just check in the Directory (the tab is at the top of this page) for Trak Maps. You can order direct off their site. Most of the Outfitters on the Gouin have them available too, just ask when you make your booking. While you're on the Gouin, I'll be a little further north fishing the James Bay Tournament at Lake Opemiska. Have fun, I know I will."

541098,Guest,2004-06-23 08:12:00,0,"McQ, Thanks for the info on Baie Du Nord and the Nemio River. I can't wait until I drop a line in there. I see from your other post that you actually drove into the outfitters camp on the Nemio. About how far of a drive do you think that would be from St. Anne Du Lac? I might look into that for next year. Good luck in the James Bay tournament. I've done five trips to an area near there. We fished in two smaller lakes (Legoff and Poncet) that are part of the Marten river which flows into the Rupert River. Big northerns there (10 over 40 inches one year) but much smaller walleye. We used to use a group called Propair to fly us in. That was back in the late 80's and early 90's, they didn't have any outpost camps either so I'm looking forward to a little bit of 'luxury' at Point Du Nord!!! I initially started looking around the same area for a trip but didn't find any that had availability. Hopefully the Goiun will make me forget about that and I'll want to go back there next year. Thanks Again and I hope you win your tournament!!!! Bill."
541099,McQ,2004-06-23 08:40:00,615,"Bill, most of the drive to camps on the Gouin can be reached in about 4 hours from Ste. Anne. Access is by well maintained logging road through Parent."
541113,Guest,2004-06-24 08:17:00,0,Just got back from the Mattawa Bay area fishing with Tamarac Air Services. Party of four guys caught well over 350 walleyes in three days of fishing. Most fish were caught on Gulp minnows in yellow as well as power twister tails in chartruese glitter. Fish were caught any where from 5-15 foot of water in a flat that had rock as well as many old tree stumps. Northern fishing picked up later Tuesday night after a torential downpour which supplied us with the beauty of a double rainbow. Walleye action seemed to slow as the pike became more active. Biggest eye caught was 23 inches. All fish kept were over 17 with many in the twenty inch range. Tom

541142,Guest,2004-06-24 18:49:00,0,tom- how was the clova road- we have been going with tamarac for about 15 years now to the gouin and herbert- heading up in august just wondering how long it took fron the paved road to clova- thanks
541144,McQ,2004-06-24 19:13:00,615,"General, you may want to consider going through Mont Laurier and taking the Parent road now. They have built a new link to Clova and the road is much better. The maintenance is far superior and will probably take you much less time. Very few of us are using the Clova road except to access those lodges at the southern end like O'Sullivan, Shannon, Wapus, Maxime, etc. Most all southern access to the Gouin is now being made through Parent. The western end - Baie Adolphe is routing through Senneterre."
