541393,Guest,2004-07-04 22:32:00,0,"Was there in June 4-12th. Went in through Crane lake up Maligne River into Sturgeon Lake. Weather was ok except for wind! We have been there over the past 12 years 6 times and go for the smallmouth and walleye fishng. Went into Lonely Lake for a day and did really well on BIG Walleye. biggest Smallmouth was 23.5"" and walleye was 30"" we had several close to 30"" walleyes in Lonely. We are also considering a trip in Sept, never been there either that time of year? Less traffic this year than past years. Good Luck, ro"
