Was considering Dog Lake & Foxs Den Lodge but, hearing mixed reviews on the number of fish being caught. Would be entering Ontario at Sault Ste. Marie & would like to stay within 50 to 100 miles of Wawa or Chapleau. Don't have the big bucks for a flyin. Could take a boat but, would prefer to rent. Just four would be going, two of which are 13 & 14 year old boys. Any help would be greatly appreciated!"

I would highly reccommend them to anyone. the new owners are very friendly and helpful. I caught 50+ fish on three of our four days the fourth we caught a few but were mostly exploring for new spots for next time. on our first trip there we struggled for 1 1/2 days until we found some things that worked after that walleye limits every day. their camp boats are nice big Sylvans with brand new 15 mercs, ran great for us all week. we took our camper rented boats and bought all of our bait, ice, pop and gas for the week total for 4 days $212 US per person. we ran into one problem (minor) during the week, it was fixed before we got back to the dock. I think you would enjoy the camp, check their webpage atwww.happydaylodge.com we are going back cheers Jerry"

The owners live at the camp, and are a retired medical professional couple (orthopedic surgeon & RN) - camp is always clean and everything is always in very good condition. www.campkuha.com New 2 bedroom log cabins with wooden flooring & cathedral ceilings, front decks with gas grills, glassed in shower units, good fishing , and nice camp boats (or bring in your own and they have electric available for on-board chargers). If you want some more info, email me at [email protected] I've gone up to this camp over the last five years and enjoyed every trip. Have caught a number of 5lb+ smallmout (C&R), 8lb+ walleye and pike up to 18lbs - beautiful lake with nice size river feeding the lake. Have fun on your search. Faith, Family, Friends & Fishing !

541364,Guest,2004-07-03 14:38:00,0,Check out this one. We've gone there for 10 years. Very family oriented and good fishing. http://www.duenorth.net/prairiebeecamps/
541371,Guest,2004-07-03 20:05:00,0,This is what we do at Dog Lake--stay in the campground but take a couple quads and a 14 ft. aluminum and pull it out into the bush to Stephenson--sp--not to far of a ride my wife and I make this trip--maybe 10-14 miles out maybe not that far. we catch plenty of eyes are there all by ourselves and have caught a 40 in. pike. we are at Clare MI. IT MAKES A NICE SHORT TRIP considering I just got back from north of Pickle Lake the village that is 1100 miles one way. Staying at Ernies you have the phone showers toilets etc. but you can fish in the wilds. any questions just ask. len

Cabins, boats (4 stroke motors) and facilities are top notch for the money. Mike's lake maps are accurate and he has over 60 bouy markers out on dangerous rocks making for more relaxed travel. Our group has gone up 5+ years and the numbers in the 16-20 inch slot for walleyes grows every year. Approx 3-4 hours out of the Sault. On the drive in we have seen moose, bear, fisher and pine marten."
