The criterion is that it is located no more than an hour or so from the 1000 Islands Bridge, that the lake contains walleye, smallies and pike and that it offers fair size potential for some or all species but we're not looking for trophies, just an active week especially since a few members of our party are not considered hard-core anglers. Thanks in advance for any suggestions or references."
