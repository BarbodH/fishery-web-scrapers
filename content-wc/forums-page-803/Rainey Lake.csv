541383,Guest,2004-07-04 11:23:00,0,"Just got back from fishing the ""Red Gut"" (east arm) area. Fishing was not as good as in prior years. Outfitter (The Fisheries) said the pattern was probably around 3 weeks late due to a longer winter. Smallies started to turn on last Wednesday. Caught two 18s, some 15 and 17s. Didn't catch many Northerns at all. Largest was 37"". Did not catch many eyes, although we mainy target smallmouth and northerns. It's getting better, just later than usual. Pathfinder"
