541350,Guest,2004-07-03 00:02:00,0,"Hi. It sounds like you ""Fred"" need new friends. A lot of good ideas out there. i think fred needs to do a re alignment. tell them all the new arrangement. If they dont like it you dont need them and they are not your friends. My wife and I have a fair arrangement. I pay alllll the bills and she keeps me happy! Even if she does catch more fish than I do. I have no complaints."
541318,Hawker,2004-07-03 06:38:00,3967,"Since now there are four going, you simply rent a vehicle for the four of you to ride in, rent the two boats neccessary for the four fishermen once you get there and everyone pays their portion equally. Collect the money from everyone in advance, put it in a kitty and when the kitty starts to dry up, everyone kicks in the same amount. Oh, fishing gear etc??? Fish with what ya bring, period! Hawker"

541359,Guest,2004-07-03 11:59:00,0,"We have between 8-10 guys going every year.we all put in $450 each for any expences at lodge, minnows, ice.etc $100 for gas to and from canada (we have to drive to some lakes) and $100 for food and beverages.any left over goes into next years kitty.$100 to the guys that bring thier cars for wear and tear.some guys fish only with leeches they split the cost etc. etc. Thats the way we do it, we never get in any arguments.If you can afford it come along if not,see ya when we get back.We have a meeting before and everyone knows what to expect."
541361,Guest,2004-07-03 12:15:00,0,"It is family so it might be different. My dad and I pay for the lion share of the gas for the drive up. everything at the lodge is split...gas, docking, lodging etc. My brother wants to take his boat...he bought it to use. My extra part beyond what was just mentioned is - I fight the waves on the bow controlling the trolling motor, and hauling in the anchor....as most know this can be exhausting on waters like las seul. This frees him up to just fish. It works well and I can't wait to do again next year...year 17(in a row)for my dad brother and me."
541363,Guest,2004-07-03 14:29:00,0,"Thanks for the counseling. Who do I pay for this therapy? One person asked if this is hypothetical - no it is not. The ideas here are very enlightening when applied to my situation. These guys really want to take advantage of me, and I won't permit it anymore. I work hard to try to go on a fishing trip and these guys openly bicker and try to see who can get the most for the least. They want to rely on me for getting them on fish. Well, it aint gonna happen anymore. As one guy said, they have no class - and they are not that much fun anyhow. I printed out this thread and am giving a copy to each of the cheapskates. Time to go clean the boat! Have a nice day. Fred"
541365,Guest,2004-07-03 15:19:00,0,"good for you, fred. screw em."
541366,Guest,2004-07-03 17:08:00,0,"The way we did it when I was younger-each adult put in $400, $300for kids, $350 for non-drinkers. (We tried to take a majority of our hard liquor.) That took care of gas, food, motels and booze. Cabin and boat rental was divided equally. Those driving ate the wear and tear on the vehicle. We usually brought our own motors-whoever was running the motor paid for damage. When the kitty ran low, we added to it at the same ratio."
541367,Guest,2004-07-03 18:33:00,0,"The group I currently go with we split the cost of gas, food, beer, booze and bait. Those of us with boats and tow vehicles, come out on the short end. Years ago, it was somebody else's boat and truck. Not mine. This year, I had not filled up my truck yet, when I picked up the first guy. He paid for the first fill up. It was appreciated, but not neccessary. We had one regular guy (non boat/truck owner) who is currently laid off. Three of us said we would cover his expenses to make sure he could go. But he insisted he had enough cash to cover his own. I am not related to any of these indivduals, we are just good friends. As one of the boat and truck owners, the most important thing for you to realize if you are not the owner, is that your opinion doesn't count as much as mine when we decide where to fish or how fast we are going to drive or if we are stopping at the duty free store or if we get leeches or just bring crawlers from home. Also if you are not the boat or truck owner ask before you start eating in the vehicle or boat. If you spill something, clean it up. Do not try to sneak an extra bottle of booze across the border. My worst trip was when we took my boat but my frined's truck. He was very concerned about his vehicle. He spilled nightcrawler bedding all over the boat. Did a #### job picking it up. Insisted that we go into snags and rocks to recover a 25 cent jig. We only made one trip. Fritz"

541337,2746,2004-07-02 14:04:00,3206,Group of six have been going together for some time. We do it as follows: If you drive a car/truck you don't pay any gas. If you provide a boat you don't pay any boat gas. Guys without a boat kick in $100 for the week for use of the boat and that goes to the boat owners. All other expenses are spit evenly. That means as a boat and truck owner I don't pay any gas and get $200 for providung the boat but pay 1/6 of all other expenses. Works well for this group and has over several years even as members have dropped out and new ones joined.

541309,Guest,2004-07-02 18:41:00,0,"thanks for the great replies. Here are a few more details for consideration. Fred usually does go alone due to his work schedule and pays his own way. These guys want to go along and have asked - ""will we catch any fish?"" On a past trip, Joe kept track of all costs and looked for ways to minimize his share. Now another friend named Jim wants to go along too. Fred says that it will be too crowded for four people and gear in one vehicle and too crowded to fish from one boat (only three seats max.) so someone else must also drive and a rental boat/outboard will be needed. Joe and Dave say that Jim must drive his vehicle if he wants to go. Jim wants a 4-way split on the cost of the rental boat and outboard. Joe and Dave say that they aren't paying for any of the rental boat/outboard because they already were going to fish in Fred's boat for free. Fred has decided to either go alone or look for other ""buddies"". Do any of you guys have room on your trip for Fred (me) to go along?"

541312,rebelrn2001,2004-07-02 19:07:00,1563,"I'd like to know if this is hypothetical or not. If I were Fred, I'd get 2 other frinds. These friends remind me of my 'used to be' old best friend in my teens/early 20s. I'd always seem to do the driving. I'd be the first to buy a drink in the bar (then he'd stop drinking when we were ready to leave and it was his turn). I'd be the one to buy a boat and this 'friend' would come along. Not for long. I finally got fed up and when I told him he basically said screw you so I said the same to you. For local trips I expect the person fishing w/me in my boat to pay for the launch and/or gas. Depending on how extensive/long of a trip it is. For Canada, it is divided equally among the people that go, no matter if it is my vehicle and/or boat. I agree, it is not fair and if someone offered to make up some of the depreciation/wear & tear cost I'd take it....so far no one has offered. Maybe it's time for another 'best friend' or I just fish alone. No one to argue with except myself then. LOL"

I have learned that I will not let a few bucks ruin a fishing trip that I have waited all year to go to. I do think it is nice if a boat guest puts in a little more money, or buys the bait, but I never expect it. This year we are going on a trip with 7 guys and two boats, and we will have to rent one boat. The five guys without a boat will then pitch in for the rental, and the two boatowners pay nothing.

Here is an explanation of our present situation: In this situation, Fred owns a nice fully rigged comfortable boat, nice tow vehicle, and all the gear for a great trip to Canada. Fred's brother Joe has a couple nice rods and very little tackle. Fred's friend Dave has a couple decent rods and no other gear. Fred is ready to go fishing and both Joe and Dave want to go along. Of course, they will go in Fred's vehicle and use Fred's boat, gear, and tackle. Joe and Dave have asked Fred to make all the arrangements. Joe and Dave expect to pay for 1/3 of the gas and tolls and 1/3 of the bill at the lodge, and 1/3 of the bill for the food. They expect Fred to pay the same even though he is providing almost everything. (Fred has the least disposable income. Joe is wealthy. Dave is comfortable.) It seems to me that it would be more fair if Joe and Dave would at least split the gas and tolls since Fred is providing the rest. What is your opinion? How do you handle similar situations? Thanks for your input. Have a nice day. Fred"

Is it fair to myself or others, like Fred, who bring a boat and truck? Probably not, but nobody's complaining. By the time you figure out the cost of the trip, the few dollars differnce that a ""more fair"" split would make don't really amount to much. It's a vacation, we try not to get worked up over a few dollars. This may not work for your group, but it always has for ours. Good Luck."

A few years back I took my car and boat and went with 2 other people not family and I told them months before we went that they would have to pay gas for the car and the boat motor and they did. Take turns taking car and boat or find someone else if they expect you to take your car and boat.

541297,Riceburner,2004-07-02 09:29:00,436,"My guess, 85% of the sportsmen want to do their fair share, and pay whats fair....the other 15% will let you pay and do more. The 85 guys need to decide if they are willing to associate with the 15, maybe for some other reason... On our trips, everyone has a job to do around camp, and splits the cost of the cabins/food. Kids are treated the same as adults. Boat owners do not pay any boating expenses/Vehicle owners do not pay any vehicle expenses. All gas/oil/tolls/deductables etc are split by the other guys in that vehicle/boat. Bait expenses are split in the boat--if the guys move around on different days-we split the group bait cost for the trip. For a long trip (over 1000 miles), we also pay the vehicle owner $30. for an oil change/vehicle cleanup. This probably sounds harsh to some, but most people are comfortable with paying and working their fair share--it works both ways--not more/not less. Those guys who don't have the needed vehicle/equipment/expertise/time to plan the trip/etc, but love to be a part of the trip, should be willing toss extra into the kitty. A ""recommended tackle or gear"" list sent out ahead of the trip seems to help too. Your thoughts welcome....."
