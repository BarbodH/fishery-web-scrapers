551321,Guest,2005-08-10 22:48:00,0,Several years ago we decided to try a couple of different brands of beer. We got some stuff called OV. After tasting it we decided the OV stood for Old Vagina. Nasty stuff.

551205,Guest,2005-08-07 11:58:00,0,Only the prices seem rude to me.
551208,Guest,2005-08-07 14:10:00,0,"""Lucky"" beer at $25 Canadian per 24.....only 4.8% alcohol though. Still beats most of what passes as beer in the US....price is right."
551211,bigfish1965,2005-08-07 17:44:00,3210,yup...just the price. THe new Lakeport Honey Lager 24 bottles for 24 dollars is suprisingly great for a cheap beer. Real beer only comes in bottles.
551218,jerry bark,2005-08-08 05:00:00,822,the only thing i found to be rude about any beer in canada has been the fact that some brewery is bottling a real nice pale ale in bottles labeld India Pale Ale?? go figure...
551238,Guest,2005-08-08 12:18:00,0,"India Pale Ale refers to a ""style"" of beer: there are ales, pale ales, and India pale ales. Generally an ale utilizes more hops than other styles, such as lagers, so they have a pronounced different flavor. Many years ago, when the British had troops stationed in India, they had a problem getting beer to them without it going bad on the long trip. Then somebody figured out that if you add a lot of hops during the brewing process, the beer would maintain its flavor longer. And that is how a style of beer known as India Pale Ale got its name. Now go make some beer batter and fry up those walls. Bander6"
551251,Guest,2005-08-09 07:06:00,0,"i dont know if they still sell it up there but about 10 years ago one of my alcoholic buddies needed something ""with more bite"" as he described it. we did have any rubbing alcohol left for him to drink so he picked up a 6 pack of this molsen XXX magnum. i took a sip and poured the rest in my gas tank to clean the engine out. bottle said 12% alcohol but i think it was drunk too."
551262,Guest,2005-08-09 15:02:00,0,The molsen XXX is great beer....and only 7.5% alcohol.
