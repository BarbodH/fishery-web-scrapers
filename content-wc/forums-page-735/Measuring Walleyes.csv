551452,phishfearme,2005-08-15 08:53:00,1242,and it measures 8 inches to 30 feet!! whatta deal!!
551063,pikemike,2005-08-04 13:52:00,95,"something else that works very well is a 4 foot section of PVC rain gutter. we went to a home improvement show where they gave them away last winter. next you stick the measuring tape sticker talked about in the earlier post to the bottom of the gutter. works well with minimal impact on fly in weight. also, remember to pinch the tail together as it will change the legnth of the fish."

551065,Guest,2005-08-04 14:10:00,0,Come on boys....if you have been fishing long enough you can tell if they are in the slot when you pick them out of the water. Throw them all back anyhow except the last few lucky ones we take back to have supper with us.

551136,Guest,2005-08-04 19:17:00,0,I did this and it works GREAT! Cleans up nicely and doesn't hold odors like wood will.
551139,Guest,2005-08-04 21:03:00,0,"NWO, What difference does it make. Everything you catch over 27"" is 30"" by the time you get back to camp anyhow. Seriously you are right we always measure the big girls but I think the less handeling that each fish has and the quicker he gets back in the water the better survival rate we will see. Hope your season is going well and may all your fish need to measured."
551143,grt1,2005-08-04 22:11:00,259,"Stop in at any MNR office in Northwestern Ontario, they have plasticised stick on measuring tapes the you can put on the bottom of the rain gutter, the sizes are measured out for you and have the slots for the majority of lakes already indicated on this stick on strip"
551149,JDP,2005-08-05 08:35:00,1457,"Be careful with ""measuring tapes"" from resorts, bait and tackle shops,etc. Many of them stretch when applied (stuck on to a surface),thus a fish wil measure shorter than it actually is. What happens: The fish you believe to be under the slot could actually be in the slot. The fish you believe to be over the slot is in the the slot. Much safer to use a stick such as ""The Judge"" if you keep fish close to the edges of the slot.:-)"
551025,Guest,2005-08-03 18:39:00,0,I would like to know how best to measure walleyes. I am thinking of building a fish measuring board like the fisheries people use. Please share what has or has not worked for you. IA JOE

551028,phishfearme,2005-08-03 19:34:00,1242,"i think they call them ""bump boards"" 'cause you bump the nose of the fish against one side of the box (0 inches) and measure the length to the tip of the tail with the built in ruler. with slot restriction in so many places it seems like this is something outfitters should provide as part of the deal. we've made them out of boards we've found around the cabins we've used just to save on fly-in weight. they're easy to make though. - phish"

551030,Guest,2005-08-03 20:11:00,0,"Two 1""-4"" boards fastened at 90 degrees, with a 1""-4"" square piece at the 0"" end. Get a flat metal yardstick and attach it to the ""bottom"" board (obviously the one you will be laying the fish down on). If you want to get fancy, and you have the right tools, you can cut the shallow groove for the ruler to sit in so it lays flat. Use flat screw heads to secure the ruler (same purpose). We like to paint the boards (usually beofre mounting the ruler), green and red work well, the red is for the slot size as in 'do not keep' and the rest is green. Coat it thick in some type of sealent. I have yet to find something that doesn't eventually lead to the numbers wearing off the ruler, no matter how many coats you apply, but you can just replace the ruler and keep the board (rulers are like $1-$2). When you measure walleyes lay 'em down, nose to the 0"" board. Make sure the MOUTH IS CLOSED and the TAIL IS PINCHED to get an accurate measurement. NWO Fishing Bum"

551053,Guest,2005-08-04 10:51:00,0,"all you need is a piece of 4"" diameter pvc pipe and a pvc end cap. saw the pvc pipe in half length-wise so you have two troughs. cut the cap to fit the end of the trough and cement it on. buy a ruler tape from any bait shop and stick onto the pvc trough with ""0"" at the end cap. DONE!! fish really sit nice in a rounded trough and don't flop as much."
