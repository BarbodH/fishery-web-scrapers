You might start to feel better, but you should still see a doctor after you hit yourself with the EpiPen. I did say that it was inexpensive, but I guess I was forgetting that my insurance covers all of about $10. But if you insurance does not cover it, is your life worth $60?"
551523,Guest,2005-08-16 20:32:00,0,Think about the chewable Benadryl's. Have a kid allergic to stings and other stuff. They are convenient for all to carry in a wallet etc and you need no water with them.
551524,bigfish1965,2005-08-16 20:43:00,3210,Liquid benadryl is also an option for people AND pets. My pup is allergic to bee stings so we have a supply of benadryl always with us.
550888,Guest,2005-07-31 12:30:00,0,"I went on a canoe trip to the Boundary Waters with my wife and Aunt and Uncle. My Uncle is 60 years old and has never had a problem with Bee stings. Two days after we got back, he got stung in his front yard, and if he were not a few minutes from a hospital, his windpipe would have closed completely. If he had been stung in the Boundary Waters a few days earlier, he was a deadman. I went to my doctor and asked for a prescription for an EpiPen. It is a portable injector to protect you if you have a severe allergic reaction. Because I now know that this allergy to bees is in my family, I got one and carry it with me north of the border. If I am at a shore lunch in the middle of Lac Seul, I doubt I, or my Uncle will make it if we get stung. They are not expensive, and it is an easy way to save your, or a frinds live in a remote area."
550897,Guest,2005-08-01 00:19:00,0,"Absolutely Bor!!! Excellent point to make on a board like this. Several years ago, a large group of us was paddling on a multi-day trip. One older gentleman in the group was horribly allergic to stings and carried an EpiPen with him everywhere he went. We were paddling along (he was in the bow of the next canoe), and I saw him slap at something on his upper arm. He then reached for his chest pocket and simply made a loud sigh of shock. The guy in the stern with him quickly said ""What is it?"" And he responded with ""Might as well start paddling to shore, I'll be dead in less than an hour!"" Well once we were able to stumble out of our mouths ""Why?"", he said ""I just got stung, and I left my Epipen back on the beach where we stopped for lunch (three hours earlier)."" Then the guy in the stern and I shared a smile, because we knew we had not one but two EpiPens in the first aid kit. We cracked 'er open, gave him the shot and he was fine! Without a doubt, he would have been dead, had we not had it along. Talk about ruining your trip . . . so again Bor, THANK YOU for posting such an important piece of advice on the boards.

550933,Fishoil,2005-08-01 16:28:00,1277,"How long is one good for? Are they affected by heat or cold? Do I need a prescription to get one? I'm not allergic to stings, but you never know about guests. Sounds like it might be a good thing to keep in my boat's first-aid kit."
550937,Guest,2005-08-01 17:53:00,0,"You do need a prescription for one. I just called my doctor and told him that I am ofter camping and far away from a hospital, and told him about my uncle. He gave me a script for one. My wife is getting two new ones tomorrow. Go to www.epipen.com for more."

I have never had to use mine, but would get confused as to where to inject it in case I needed to. I always thought the top of the thigh in the muscle was the proper place to inject, but the diagram on the epipen site shows the side of the thigh as the proper site. Maybe because theres less chance of hitting the bone from the side. Ron"
550949,Atlanta Dave,2005-08-02 05:41:00,323,Picked one up yesterday they are expensive 60 bucks . the one I got is good till oct 2006. I think you might get them to last longer. The problem is they are some what sensitive to heat and cold said not to keep in car because of heat. I do think I will always take one to the fly ins we do as help is hours away. Atlanta Dave

550966,Guest,2005-08-02 13:21:00,0,"hey guys I am a pharmacist. just thought i would speak up. If you have any allergies to bugs or bees (or anything for that matter)you should always have one on you. Epi-pens are expensive if you are paying retail but just about every insurance company I deal with, covers it and it should fall under your preferred formulary list of medications. Epi-pens have a solution in them, so they are more sensitive to the heat and cold than say a plain pill of some sort. SO it is important to keep it at around room temp. (70 degrees F)If anything if you are up in God's country keep it cool on days like we've been having lately. But do not freeze or keep on ice. It is advised to replace it every year because it makes no sense to be frugal with your life even if you are paying cash. There are no generics in the States and there are no other good alternatives. BUt bringing Benadryl along to crush up would be advisable too. Remember to read the directions carefully and not not try to get cute with it. Just inject it right through your pants into your thigh, 90 degree angle with your leg and you will here a pronounced click. good luck fishin' fellas' I'll be up to Lac Seul Aug.13-21st can't wait. always be prepared and you'll enjoy your trip much more"
550972,Guest,2005-08-02 18:07:00,0,"I agree - great idea to have an EpiPen along, even if you are NOT going to be in a remote area. However; after several rather serious reactions to bee/insect bites, my Doctor told me that when an EpiPen is used, it can cause sever stress on the user's heart, due to the epinephrine in the formula. It is strongly adviseable to seek medical attention as soon as possible after the injection, in case of heart attack. Of course, in a remote situation, this is almost impossible, but I think you should at least inform the rest of your group of the possible ramifications if the EpiPen is used. I'd hate to die from either event, but if I had to go --- I couldn't think of a more beautiful place!!"
