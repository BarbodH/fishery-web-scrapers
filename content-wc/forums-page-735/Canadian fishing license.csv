Also, I am going to the English river system in a week, but I also fish the Detroit River and if I wish to fish the Canadian side of the river, a Canadian fishing license is required there also. Could I purchase an annual for the Seperation Rapids trip and use it on the Detroit River, Lake Erie, in the fall or would that be different Provinces and require different licenses. (Like different States in the US) Thanks in advance, Craig,"
