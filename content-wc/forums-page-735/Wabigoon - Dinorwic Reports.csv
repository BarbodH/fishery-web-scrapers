551453,Guest,2005-08-15 09:14:00,0,Anyone been to either Wabigoon or Dinorwic lakes recently and could give a report on the fishing. What type of structure and presentation seemed to be effective? How is the water level? any info would be appreciated. thanks

The lake is a huge lake with alot of grassy areas. I think this lake has a mud bottom. We found the lake water to be very muddy and stained. We fished for walleyes, but caught a very little amount of fish. So, we switched over to Northerns and Bass fishing and did very well. No big records, but some nice Northerns and Small Mouth bass where taken. However, there where some big walleyes taken by others during the week, but It was far and few between catches. We stayed at a place called Davis' Bonney Bay Resort. The Owners and the people there where super great! The place was very clean and well taken care of. The weekly camp dinner was awsome with some great home made food!!!! The spread of food the owners made for the camp site was truly a fest. So I must say I give the fishing for that week trip (It may be better at other times) an c+ the place we stayed at AAA+++. Hope this helps you out."
