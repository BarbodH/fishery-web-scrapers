551441,Guest,2005-08-14 19:28:00,0,"Hey ""dud"", thank you for your contribution to this topic...very cerebral. By the way the handle is ben....dover....jr......"
551526,railman,2005-08-16 22:46:00,2,I apologize folks!Sorry just thought it seemed a little petty.I could really care less where you buy your gas!More importantle have fun when your here!...........Rail
551356,Guest,2005-08-11 14:26:00,0,reminds me of that debate about movin in and crowding guys of a spot they were fishin.
551358,Guest,2005-08-11 19:00:00,0,"Watched a man from Canada fill up 4, 5 gallon gas cans in Baudette and cross ahead of me, took me longer to get across than it did him. Man at the gate must have known the driver. Elmo"
551375,Guest,2005-08-12 09:57:00,0,"Yeah, it's interesting that if they either live by the border, or are near the border, they'll cross into the US to get cheaper gas - but then they'll get onto this board and chew your @ss if you take gas with you. Intersting....and good point."
551381,Guest,2005-08-12 14:29:00,0,"Gas retailers make their money selling gas. Fishing lodges make their money selling the opportunity to have a fishing experience in NWO.....this means providing accomodation, equipment, gas, bait etc. There is no comparison to someone slipping across the border for a few gallons of gas (your assumption) and someone heading to a resort and hauling in their weeks supply of fuel. There is also the problem of storing explosive material next to your cabin and having it spilt over the lawn while being a ""pork and beaner"" guest. Maybe thats why your ""*ss"" is being chewed upon....."
551382,Guest,2005-08-12 14:36:00,0,"You guys seem to have the ethical debate pretty well covered, so I won't get into that. Just wanted to remark that about 10 years ago on the stretch of road between Dryden and Ft Frances, we came upon the remains of a boat and trailer on the side of the road. All that was left were the trailer beams and axle, and a few of the boat's ribs, the rest was completely gone. Don't know if someone tossed a cigarette butt, or what, but that would sure screw up a trip. Whatever gas you carry, make sure it's in good tight containers, and take the proper precautions."
551383,Guest,2005-08-12 14:41:00,0,"Is a ""pork and beaner"" guest the same as someone like me that stays in housekeeping cabin. We don't do it cause we're cheap( we are ) rather we like to come and go as we please and not be tied to the lodge owners meal schedule. We don't bring and extra gas but we have been know to pay some duty on that great tasting US beer that you just can't get in the great white north."
551394,Guest,2005-08-12 18:39:00,0,"It really upsets me how rude people can be. KevinH was asking an inocent question and Railman had to be rude and offending. You may want to think before you start a rude responce. You have no idea the situation Kevin may be in, or the reasoning he is bringing a little over. I'm sure he'll still buy some of your gas. If your not going to help a guy out with his question, don't reply. People make posts on here for advice, not to get their *ss chewed. If he wanted to get his *ss chewed he'd just spend a night with his wife, they always find something wrong. And now my response to the actual question to Kevin. I take gas over as well. The reason I take it over is for my kicker motor. The reason I take it, is because is has to be mixed with a differant oil mixture. I take about 15 gallons over every year, since I troll alot, and don't worry Railman, I fill my boat up 2-3x, and my truck 2x in Canada, so I do buy about 160 gallons worth up their."
551406,Guest,2005-08-13 07:05:00,0,"Back in ""the day"" when american plan was more the norm , the housekeeping guests were referred to as ""pork and beaners""....I'm talking many years ago. Today I think most places are #### happy to have the housekeeping guests and my reference to ""pork and beaners"" would apply to those that are so cheap they do stuff like bring a 50 gal. drum of gas in the back of their truck....I've actually seen that happen! I think it is fairly common these days for guests to bring along a few extra tanks of gas....no-one is going to get their *ss chewed for that. Back to the original post....bring what is legally acceptable and safe......the hassle at the border otherwise (or at the resort) is not worth the few bucks you will save."
551407,Guest,2005-08-13 09:41:00,0,"Bring your gas, bring your beer, the border people wont care! Either will most of us Canadians. Just enjoy, and good fishing to you."
551408,Guest,2005-08-13 10:31:00,0,I agree. We love coming to Canada and will continue to do so as long as we are able.
551282,Guest,2005-08-09 21:08:00,0,"im sorry about the negative comments..............but you dont see canadians hauling canadian cheaper commodities into the states when they winter in arizona.nor did they haul grade a alberta beef when the border was closed.just a thought,but remember your dollar is still pretty strong here..........rail"
551288,Frankm,2005-08-10 06:45:00,154,I'm gonna jump in here. I don't know why you want to risk traveling with all that extra gas to save a few bucks. I would be a nervous wreck traveling with that. I can understand bringing your own smokes and beer but its just too dangerous to travel with all that gas. Again I'll say it. You're on vacation. Relax enjoy yourself and don't nickel and dime yourself to death.
551290,Guest,2005-08-10 07:48:00,0,"hey, just remember your body guard south of your border. If the US weren't located where she is, you'd probably be France West...."
551304,pikemike,2005-08-10 10:35:00,95,"Dud, i'm from the states also, and understand your sentiment, but why give in to the crap-slinging with a comment like that? we are guests in their country when we travel north. remember, we cant get too cocky as we still have over 2 years left of Bush...enough of that (the original topic is starting to get lost). i think the gas ? is valid and warrants an intelligent response. we also need to remember that for some traveling north to remote areas, taking extra gas is a necessity, not a convenience."
551306,IaCraig,2005-08-10 11:21:00,434,"Personally I'd say that if in doubt don't do it, the $1 per gallon you may save isn't worth the delay and headaches if customs decides to crack down I don't know about Manitoba, but I've always been told that in Ontario it isn't a total gallon limit rather 1 tank per boat or vehicle. So if your like my old boat and use external 6 gallon tanks, technically you can only have 1 full. Or if your boat is like my new one with a built in 34 gallon tank, it is OK to have that full. Maybe that isn't fair, but with my current boat I buy more than I used to in Canada because the bigger motor burns more fuel and I go farther. (I use over 100 gallons during a normal week). Only 1 time do I remember being asked about gas and that was with my old boat with 2 full 6 gallon external tanks. (each had fittings to connect to the motor). They did not care about the 2 tanks, they were specifically looking for Jerry cans or the 5 gallon cans you use to fill a lawn mower. Have a fun trip. IaCraig"
551308,Guest,2005-08-10 13:47:00,0,"It's a slap in the face in response to a slap in the face. Bring your gas, save your money so you can spend it on their stuff when you get up there."
551313,Guest,2005-08-10 18:35:00,0,"No it was just a cheap shot from a real ""dud"". By the way gas is predicted to be a minimum of $1.15 per litre by the end of the summer.....it won't be going down either. My prediction is that lodge boat rentals will go up in the future years and people hauling there own rigs with the gas guzzling trucks will decrease."
551318,Guest,2005-08-10 21:02:00,0,"If you bring more than what your boat holds, you're hurting your lodge operator. Don't be a cheap A$$. Only exception is when they are gouging you, then all bets are off. The only reason there are french in Canada is beacause then the brits kicked the french's A$$E$ back in the day, they let them stay and set up shop in a little part of lower canada now known as quebec. Get your facts straight, Dud. People that haul gas up to Canada aren't the type to buy a t shirt or cap from the lodge they are visiting so that line of reasonning is BS too."

551181,Guest,2005-08-06 17:07:00,0,Some buddies and I are going into Canada for a week to go fishing this fall. Just seeing if it was ok to take 20 gallons of gas over the border in some ten gallon tanks. Would the border put on a stink if we had 2- 10 gallon tanks with gas in it?
551200,Guest,2005-08-07 10:20:00,0,Hi. according to some people you could probably take a tanker over they would not say anything. a reasonable amount is OK. I fill up here too. the question is how much will the camp let you bring in?
551202,Guest,2005-08-07 11:48:00,0,Gas on the US side of border was 2.39 gallon and on Canadian side 97.9 per liter on Saturday. Craig
551203,Guest,2005-08-07 11:53:00,0,I was asked about extra gas at the border about ten years ago. I had two 6 gallon tanks for my boat and they were both full. I was told I could bring one tank and had to pay duty on the other 6 gallons. That was at the crossing Grand Portage. I have never been questioned about gas at I.F. or Baudette. They always ask about booze and smokes and if we intend to gift anything to anyone in Canada. Sometimes they ask about bait and taters.
551231,Inconnu,2005-08-08 09:45:00,21,"Which province are you coming into? Some of them are not too high. Not sure about Eastern provinces, but Alberta is around 90.5 cents/L"
551232,Guest,2005-08-08 09:47:00,0,We take about 36 gallons with us. We have never had any issues. Do it. Just be careful driving.
551254,Guest,2005-08-09 08:25:00,0,"We are crossing into Manitoba, at the Penbina crossing."
551268,Guest,2005-08-09 17:13:00,0,things are pretty bad when you are worried about the difference of price on a few gallons of gas.I suppose you want to take all the free walleye from our country but make sure you dont support a poor gas station operator.ive travelled in the states alot and dont mind playing by YOUR rules.if you want american prices maybe stay in the states!
551271,Guest,2005-08-09 18:18:00,0,"I'm sorry I don't like paying $1 more per gallon when I cross into Canada. Are you also upset that I take my own cigarrettes too. Canadian cigarettes are only 3x as expensive. And I'm sure the people in Canada that own the local Hotels and resturants don't mind if we come into Canada. Wait, If it wasn't for us coming there, the business would suffer a lot. I'm pritty sure those walleyes arn't free. Each year I spend $500 myself up their, along with my four buddies.I'm pritty sure some years, each walleye I caught prolly averaged $20 per one. If you have nothing positive, keep your coments to yourself."
551272,Guest,2005-08-09 18:32:00,0,"Your not paying $1.00 more per gallon, unless the resort owner is gabbing ya. Besides the gas up there is of far better quality thne the junk we get down here."
