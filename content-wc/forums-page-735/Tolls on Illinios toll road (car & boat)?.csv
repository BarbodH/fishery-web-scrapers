He was late for work and yes, he was speeding!!!We've all been there at one time in our life. So, he passed one IL toll boot (I Pass Lane) and went through the next toll booth (I Pass Lane). Well, in about a week he got a traffic ticket in the mail for speeding. The ticket came along with a form showing his arrival time at each toll boot, the miles, the speed limit and a picture of his license plate. In other words, it was like he was being clocked from toll to toll. However, the truth is there was no way he could have made it to the next toll booth in the time shown without going over the speed limit. Yep, they had him by having proof in the miles, the time and a picture of license plate and of course he had the extra cost of paying the fine!!! Go figure."

551459,Guest,2005-08-15 12:09:00,0,How much are the tolls on the Northwest tollway when a person does not have Ipass and is pulling a boat?
551483,Guest,2005-08-15 17:38:00,0,Single axle trailer will go from 2.25 to 2.85.
551486,Guest,2005-08-15 18:28:00,0,Check the following rate schedule. Scroll down to the bottom of the page to see that your rig will classify as a medium truck (autos with 1 or 2 axle trailers). The rate schedule for the Northwest tollway is at the top of the page.http://www.illinoistollway.com/porta..._schema=PORTAL
551487,Guest,2005-08-15 18:36:00,0,You can also check out the toll calculator at the following link to figure out your total tool cost of the trip.http://www.getipass.com/tollcalc/TollCalcMain.jsp I have an iPass and the toll for pulling my boat with a one axle trailer is expensive over the course of the fishing season. Those tolls do add up. Ouch!! Like2Fish

551506,TKCENTERLINE,2005-08-16 09:54:00,24,"Thanks to our IL Gov, the toll amount will be the higher cost since you are pulling a boat or trailer, even if you have I pass. Well to some people it may not mean a thing. But to some of us in Illinois, it may mean $20.00 in tolls (South side to the North side and back again, plus $35.00 in boat gas, plus $35.00 in truck gas, plus $25.00 in launch fees plus your bait. So, lets see it may cost approx $125.00 per trip just to go fishing for the day. I think it matters dont you??"

551529,Guest,2005-08-17 00:54:00,0,Hi. How do they know I have a trailer on the truck or not? does it make a difference if i go throught the passenger car transponder lanes with my boat in tow? what if I go through the truck transponder lane with or with out my boat in tow? How about the manual lane with a boat in tow. this summer I did ask the attendant out at northerns toll booth what the charge was and he said something like 4.50. I had to wonder how do they know i had a trailer? Out there its all manual so maybe he punched the button when he saw a trailer on the explorer. it would be nice to know. maybe I will start going through the auto lanes when I have a boat in tow. after all i am an auto?
