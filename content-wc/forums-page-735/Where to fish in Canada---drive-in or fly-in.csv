550758,Guest,2005-07-27 12:28:00,0,"www.tdamisk.com It's a long drive, typically 2 days from Central Illinois but the fishing keeps bringing me back. It is one of the very few places that never dissappoints me. You won't get many opportunities at trophy pike over 40"" but walleye and pike fishing are excellent. You won't own this lake either, and Amisk is a very big lake, but a I seldom have any boats fishing near. Usually, if theres more than a single boat than you can bet there's a walleye school working. The locals really turn out when the bite is on! Light housekeeping cabins will keep the cost down and there are some more modern resorts available on this lake as well. Limits in Saskatchewan are generous compared to Ontario for example 6 Pike & 5 walleye with no slot limits just one trophy fish of each. Amisk does not have lake trout but there are nearby lakes that do. You're close enough to Manitoba, at Baker's Narrows to fish that province as well but you'll have to keep your daily fish limit & records straight. I would reccomend hiring a local guide for a couple of days. Good Luck, Steve"
550892,Guest,2005-07-31 20:53:00,0,L&M is a good place. Been there fished that. They are a bunch to work with.
551516,Guest,2005-08-16 15:20:00,0,"Mickey Gullrock is a great lake along with the others in the chain...there are 5 or 6 resorts on the lake so the fishing pressure isn't too bad.. there are enough islands and humps on the lake so you should be able to find one for yourself...we just got back from poplar point on gullrock and had an EXCELLENT week. we have never caught more walleyes or more over 20"" than this past week. never tried for northerns but some in camp caught some around 20lbs. check it out."
551527,Matches,2005-08-16 23:14:00,236,"Sidewinder, One trip a year to Canada doesn't do it. 1500 miles is a long haul, but you have to figure out how to get to Canada 2 or three times a year. The season is only half over."
550358,sidewinder,2005-07-14 20:24:00,96,"Now that I have 360 days to my next trip to Canada, how about some lively discussion on the merits of fly-in vs drive-in as relates to quality of fishing, cost, privacy, etc. I can tell a lot of you lucky MN WI IA get to exchange those nasty winters for several trips north. We come from Cookeville, TN only a 1500 mile drive one way.We have chosen fly-ins but I can tell some of you guys are doing quite well driving in. After my first fly in I thought I was in Heaven but now I am realizing Heaven is a little bigger than I thought. sidewinder"
550369,phishfearme,2005-07-15 06:36:00,1242,"sidewinder - we also drive 1500 miles from PA and have been doing fly-in, housekeeping cabin trips for over 20 years. we prefer to ""rent our own lake"" and be sure not to see or ""compete"" with anybody during the trip. lets face it, 90% of the fish live in 10% of the water and it's very nice to have that 10% to yourself. i guess it depends what you want - some people i've talked to have no desire to be as isolated as us. we love it. phish"
550373,sidewinder,2005-07-15 08:06:00,96,"that is usually our consensus also. we want to explore new lakes but the fear factor slows us down. we started with little vermillion north of red lake.probably one of the best pike lakes around (catching 5or more 40+ each day is avg.,but walleye over16"" rare(we guess pike eat them) so we moved on to trout lake ne of red lake. great walleye almost all over 17"" and some lake trout. this year nungusser,great quantity of walleye. we caught 22-26 everyday even with mayfly incredible coldfront and lightning. 47 degrees was high on 4th of july. where do you fish and why? sidewinder"
550385,18Fisher,2005-07-15 16:31:00,59,Try gullrock lake. Been going for 5 years now and it has always been a struggle to catch fish that do not measure shorter than the slot. www.fivelakeslodge.com
550386,lenray,2005-07-15 16:34:00,467,Hello sidewinder I am in Michigan 200 miles south of the Soo exactly so getting into Canada is a quick trip and we go many times per year. The farthest is 1068 miles one way and the closest is 600 miles one way. We go to drive in lakes--100 miles of gravel 3-15 miles of quad running and usually portage 2-4 lakes. We have pulled 12-14 footers into there and leave them in the bush. The fishing is MORE than great and we have NEVER seen another person in all of the years going up there. These lakes see almost no fishing pressure and we don't see signs of others being there when we are not. The minus if you want to call it that is that these lakes are full of huge pike and lake trout BUT no eyes. If they had eyes there would be others there no matter the difficulty. I like to eat an eye as well as anyone but catching those pike and trout is mighty fun. The lake where I travel of 1000 miles is an eye lake and we catch them in very big numbers per day. Been to this lake for 3 years and yet to see another fisherman--it is a 20 mile ride up river to where we fish at the base of waterfalls. These are cheap fishing trips with gas being the expense and we are in very remote areas BUT of course not as remote as a fly in. Where I go up sometimes 8 trips per year it wouldn't be cost effective for me to fly in --my wife goes on a number of the trips also. We are always at least 100 miles from the nearest little village and that is at this time remote enough for us. len
550388,Guest,2005-07-15 19:37:00,0,"How far from Duluth is 5 Star Lodge? Are the roads in good shape or do you travel gravel roads? How is the fishing pressure on Gullrock? What are the peak times to catch fish(I'm assuming early June & late August/Sept.) What other resorts are in the area and how do they compare to 5 Star Lodge? What makes you want to stay/vacation at this resort? Anything you want ""improved"" ? Thanks for your opinion !!"
550393,18Fisher,2005-07-15 21:28:00,59,fishing pressure is minimal the cabins are the best weve seen very up to date and they are always improving. I leave tonight and we do o.k. but have heard early may is the time to be there. Good luck getting a reservation as the return clients usually book the next years cabin while they are up there.
550459,jigman 2003,2005-07-18 18:57:00,981,"Sidewinder; I'll throw my .02 in. Check out Mattice Lake Outfitters out of Armstrong, Ontario. They have numerous single cabin lakes as well as several lakes with a couple of cabins on them. Great walleye fishing, and the pike will keep you busy on some of their lakes. If you are seeking a trophy pike check out Whitewater lake, if you are looking for a great single cabin lake with excellent walleye fishing (30-60, 16""-23"" 'eyes per day, per guy) and a chance at a 40""+ pike check out Pringle Lake. I just got back from Ogoki Reservoir a few weeks ago, and will be going back next year. I have been using MLO for 6 years, and am VERY happy with them. Excellent accomodations, fishing, and service. Go to www.matticelake.com if you are interested. Good fishing to you."
550463,sidewinder,2005-07-18 21:01:00,96,"Thanks, I will check it out. Looking for some big walleye.Have caught 2 lifetimes of 40""+ pike at Little Vermillion. Only walleye fishing we have done is mainly jigging in 8'-26'. Seems consensus that bigger eyes are deeper from mid june on. Need some experience keeping bait or lure in strike zone deeper than25'. I am interested in Wine Lake Camp near Perrault Falls. You go through Wabaskang(sp?) to get to it.Sounds small and narrow and after 22 mile boat in sounds remote. Understand the cabins and equipment are great but sounds like Amish land (no running water or electricity) which I am fine with. I will check out your recommendation sidewinder"
550641,Guest,2005-07-22 19:12:00,0,"If your looking for a AWESOME fly in, i would defintly go with L%M Fly in....Awesome people, awsome cabins on walleye filled lakes. good times. fish18"
