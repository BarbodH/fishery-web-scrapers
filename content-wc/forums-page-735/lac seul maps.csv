551457,Guest,2005-08-15 11:48:00,0,I bought one online from fishingmap.com and was happy with the purchase. It was an accurate color map for 12.95 (including ship & handling). If you are going on a trip up there you should be able to get a good map from whatever place you are staying or at a local tackle shop.
551465,Guest,2005-08-15 14:00:00,0,"Very good and accurate maps can be purchased locally in Ear Falls at the Four Seasons Sport Shop. For other areas of LS you might try any local Map or Mapping Stores in the US. I use Milwaukee Map Co. on Hwy 100 in MIlwaikee. These maps have GPS coordinates on them and are as accurate as anything you will find (above the water line), good luck below. But they will certainly keep you from getting too lost."

551501,TKCENTERLINE,2005-08-16 08:51:00,24,"I just recieved my Lac Seul map from fishingmap.com It is a very good map with depth readings, rock and island locations, contour information. the map is water proof. I called fishing map and the fellow there was very informative. Plus, he mailed the map out immediatelly. In fact, I got it in 2 days. The cost with S & H was around $12.00. In addition and at no cost, The man fished that area and gave me alot of good information about the lake. Give Him a call. You won't go wrong!!!"
551566,bailey,2005-08-17 17:14:00,22,I just ordered one from www.fishingmapsplus.com for NW Lac Seul and also for SW Lac Seul. Not sure if these are any better but they do have contour lines and depths marked it looks like. They are supposed to arrive in about 10 days.
