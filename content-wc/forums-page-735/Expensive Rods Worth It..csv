551363,Guest,2005-08-11 21:01:00,0,Sorta like the my buddies that buy the higest price scotch or beer. My head gets light on the cheap stuff. I usally buy the best I can afford $70.00 -80.00 at the most and still have great luck. If I had $200.00 dollars in 3 rods each I would not be able to go on trips. Go with ever works for you. I think you have to have it in your mind that you can catch fish in the equipment you trust in. and bait that works for you. I guess if I could spend 200.00 I would. Good luck
551384,bailey,2005-08-12 14:54:00,22,"Well, I'm not sure I will catch any more fish with an expensive rod, but when you sit with a fishing pole in your hand for hours at a time, for days on end, would be nice to have something that feels good if nothing else. With my current rod, I can't always feel the bottom real good. We always drive to Cabelas in December and I think I will look at both Loomis and St Croix and if Santa thinks I have been good this year, I may be able to get one."
551385,Guest,2005-08-12 14:58:00,0,"I've been using the Bionic Blade IM-8 for a few years, and I think it's a darn good rod. I have no doubt you have better feel with some of the more expensive rods, I just usually don't find the Canadian walleye bite to be all that subtle. Owning quality gear is great. If you can afford a $200.00 rod, go for it, but I wouldn't spend the grocery money on one."
551387,Thunderstick,2005-08-12 16:47:00,35,"Like all fishermen, I have fished with cheap rods and the expensive rods. I've built my own rods using all the best blanks and some bargain blanks as well. As far as catching fish is concerned, they will all do the job. The key is the skill of the fisherman and his/her ability to utilize the tools he/she has to work with. A hundred years ago people built solid houses which still stand today and which will stand a hundred years from now. Likewise, today's builder has tools which allow him to build structures without beaking a sweat but if his skills are inferior, his finished product will suffer. An expensive, quality rod will make the entire fishing experience more pleasurable in degrees but whether or not that translates into success depends on an angler's skill level and knowledge. My rule of thumb is: If sensitivity is required in your type of fishing get a good rod and use a line to match. Otherwise, save your money. That goes for reels, too. As long as the drag is adequate, the rest of of it is just someplace to hold your line."
551412,pikemike,2005-08-13 10:57:00,95,"i agree to a point, but the reel features are certainly important not only for longevity, but also functionality. for spinning reels, shimano makes a quickfire trigger system with a rear drag that translates to more time with the bait in the water for me. with other reels, i think i look like my wife trying to simultaneously drive while talking on the cell phone and putting makeup. the one hand feature of the quickfire keeps my other hand free to manuever the boat, drop the anchor etc..."
551413,Guest,2005-08-13 11:05:00,0,80 dollars ain't no cheap rod
551415,Guest,2005-08-13 11:38:00,0,"I second the opinion on the Quick-fire. After using them for quite a few years, I find the non-quick fire spinning reels annoying to use. I'm just afraid that Shimano will stop making that series. Never had a complaint about the quality either."
551433,Pooch,2005-08-14 07:08:00,4619,"My answer is yes. IF you can get them on sale or discounted. A fine rod will not make a crap fisherman good but it will make a good fisherman better. I have both and there is a difference that only a good fisherman can detect. You have to match the rod to what you are doing. Jigging, trolling slow trolling fast, etc. Pooch"
551454,phishfearme,2005-08-15 09:41:00,1242,"i third the trigger finger reels. quantum makes a multiple ball bearing series called ""snapshot"" that i think are a cut above the shimanos but the trigger feature is very nice. - phish"
551319,Guest,2005-08-10 21:08:00,0,"By a G-Lommis for $200 and they have a no questions asked policy that they will replace it for $50 if it is broken. I spend the money up-front and replace it every 4-5 years for $50. Usually by that time a tip breaks or a eyelet gets smashed. Graphite seems to lose some of it's sensitivity after this amount of time anyway. I figure that it is my one hobby that I have limited time to enjoy, why not have good equipment. I only do this with my main rods that I use 90% of the time. G-Loomis really makes a top quality rod."

551337,Guest,2005-08-11 05:31:00,0,I rest my case. The two guys above prove my point.
551338,phishfearme,2005-08-11 06:03:00,1242,"good point, dave. i have to say that i've spent the big bucks (on an original fenwick graphite) and have also waited for the end of season sale at Dick's and was able to get a high quality graphite rod for $20 and i just plain can't tell the difference - except i have some money left over for jigs, rapalas and fire line. i hope we don't turn into the fly-fishing crowd where spending a ton on a rod has MUCH more to do with status than ability to feel the fish. i also don't think the fish care too much about that multi hundred dollar rod. phish"
551339,Guest,2005-08-11 06:36:00,0,I have three G-Loomis rods. Two of them are over ten years old. I wouldn't trade them for any other rod I have ever seen or used.
551344,Guest,2005-08-11 08:13:00,0,More power to the guys who like those expensive rods but I believe that any rod that you buy that is IM8 graphite or its equivalant will do an excellent job. There are a lot of IM8 rods out there for less than $100 and it gives me more money to spend on all that neat stuff that goes in the tackle box that I never use. I think that the length of rod and its grade (med/medlight) is a large factor based on the type of fishing you are doing. For example I like a 6/6 med light with a 1/4 oz jig when fishing shallow fish and a medium 7' with a soft tip for deeper fish with heavier jigs. I also love to use Power Pro for two reasons...sensitivity and hookset. Each of us have our own comfort levels and the most important thing is that we all have productive and safe trips and build those good fishing memories with our fishing partners.
551347,Frankm,2005-08-11 09:05:00,154,Interesting thread. I personally have never spent more than $70 on a rod. I don't buy junk either. The rods I have I take care of. I think its personal choice. I feel my Berkley Pro Series is a great rod and works well for me. Maybe if it wears out I'll try a more expensive rod. If someone spends $200 and takes care of it the rod should last for 20 years not a bad investment at that point. To each his own. I play golf too and that is the same thing. You can buy an okay set at Walmart for $150 or a really good set for $500 or a set of Pings for $1600. All sets have a target audience. Do I think you need to spend $200 on a rod to have success? No. Do I have a problem with someone who buys $200 rods? No.
551348,Guest,2005-08-11 09:09:00,0,What expensive reel should a man use on a expensive rod. I bought my wife a nice Zebco 202 and she caught more Walleye than I did. It was the last time she goes fishing with me.
551360,Guest,2005-08-11 20:08:00,0,"Obviously it is a personal choice. At one time, I had the same negative thought as some on this thread about expensive rods. That changed when I had an oportunity to use a friends G-Loomis for a couple days on a trip. When I switched back to my Bionic Blade I was amazed at the difference in wieght, balance, and sentitivity between the 2. I was sold at that point. Do I Catch more fish? I'd like to think so, but probably not. It just makes my time on the water more enjoyable for me. A cheap or expensive rod doesn't make a bit of difference unless you have the skills to find the fish. Personal choice."
551361,Guest,2005-08-11 20:22:00,0,My Brother bought me a custom built rod for xmas a couple of years ago that he paid around $300 for. It was as light as a feather and you could feel the difference between sand and gravel when that jig bounced. I loved it and I really believe I caught more fish with it....that is until my Brother stepped on it (same one who bought it). It now hangs in my fishing room kind of like a trophy along with a picture of my brothers size 14 left foot.
551264,Guest,2005-08-09 15:38:00,0,"I have been fishing with Bass Pro Bionic Blade Rods for years. They are IM8 and currently list at $80 and if you buy two you get the third one free. I have looked at some of the rods that are $150 to $350 and Im wondering if the WC fisherman really believe that the more expensive rods are really that much better for Walleye fishing or is it more the fielder than the glove. My personal experience indicates that the ""feel"" of the bite is pretty good with what I use for jigging and when useing crankbaits or bottom bouncers the rods are great. Please let me know what you think. Thanks, Al"
551267,Guest,2005-08-09 17:10:00,0,I can tell you that some of the expensive rods are definately worth the extra money especially for walleye fishing. I was fishing along side my cousin last year and I consider myself a pretty good fisherman. Well he was using a St. Croix rod and I was using a light action ugly stick jigging for shallow walleye. It was no contest since he could feel the bite so much better. Granted there is a world of difference between the two but this is just my 2 cents. Wingmann
551270,bailey,2005-08-09 17:19:00,22,I would like to hear what others think about this also. I need a new rod. Mine feels like a dead stick most of the time.
551273,Guest,2005-08-09 18:42:00,0,ST. Croix!!!! Any thing in the walleye series.
551278,Guest,2005-08-09 20:20:00,0,"2 years ago I took my wife and kids to a lake near White River(Esnagi Lake). I had burned a Cabela's gift certificate on a Loomis walleye rod. My wife was using a Falcon rod--a pretty good rod in my opinion. We were jig fishing and I was consistently catching more walleyes. She said ""I can't feel the bite."" I gave her my Loomis and she started banging fish left and right. Guess who used the Loomis the rest of the trip? An expensive rod does make a difference if you can afford it. But the best walleye fisherman I know uses inexpensive rods and he can fish circles around me. So if you're at the top of the mountain, I think it doesn't matter. For the rest of us stiffs, if you can afford to spoil yourself with a good rod............."
551280,Guest,2005-08-09 20:59:00,0,I have been fishing with less expensive graphite rods for several years ($30 to $50). Some of my buddies have bought high end $200 plus rods and I catch just as many fish as they do. We mostly jig fish and while Im not the worlds greatest fisherman I feel that I have a good technique. My Father taught me to never let the line go limp and to keep my finger on the line at all times when working the jig. I can feel some subtle bites with this technique and the key to catching subtle bites is to NOT drop the rod when you make the hook set....get the tip of the rod to 1 o'clock as fast as you can. At least thats the way I was taught ...and it works. When you keep the finger on the line you can feel very good. I also use Power Pro 10 lb test (2 pound Dia). I think it helps increase the sensitivity....my Grandfather use to kid me that if you used sandpaper on your finger like a safe cracker the sensitivity would really increase.
551281,bigfish1965,2005-08-09 21:01:00,3210,I got an IMX custom made rod a few years back and am totally attached to it. All my rods will be of this caliber from now on. Yes they are expensive but I will get far more usage out of this one than a store-bought rod so its much cheaper in the long run.
551286,Guest,2005-08-10 06:41:00,0,If I had a $200 rod I'd claim it was the best #### rod in the world for walleye fishing. I'd even claim I catch more fish then the guy next to me with the walmart rod. Wait I do that now.
551316,Chuckles,2005-08-10 19:55:00,474,"The answer is it really depends alot on the type of fishing - regardless of what Dave in Mo thinks... for deep verticle jigging in current you cannot accomplish the same job with a poor blank as you can with a higher graphite content blank that is constructed properly. Similar situation with pitching jigs. The other types of walleye pursuit become less and less dependant on a sensitive blank because it isn't needed for those types of fishing. It is somewhat comparable to buying a dog from a back yard breeder vs. buying from a reputable breeder - - - sure you might get a good dog from the backyard fellow occasionally - but your odds increase and the assurances increase with the reputable outfit. The first time using a Loomis was an epiphany for me - my eyes were opened to the world below - powerpro, fireline, and other spectra have done some evening of the playing field between cheaper rods and more expensive ones - I still believe good graphite is important to a good stick. Your results may vary, Chuckles"
