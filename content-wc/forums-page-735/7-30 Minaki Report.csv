550898,IaCraig,2005-08-01 01:44:00,434,"This year was more of a family vacation than a serious fishing one, but I saw enough to agree with previous posts about Minaki walleye action being down and slot walleyes being hard to find. I blame most of this on high water and several windy days. (and sleeping in every morning) Actually after fighting whitecaps on Big Sand for a couple nights, the wife and kids voted that we cast quiet areas for Northerns, so that is what we did 80% of the week. I was disappointed that no one boated any big pike, but we had plenty of pike between 23 - 28 inches (and tons from 19 - 22 inches) which was great fun for the wife & kids. The boys imaginations are running wild from a couple break offs and 1 large fish that struck next to the boat that was likely a musky. About walleyes. The evening troll was pretty dead when we tried it. But while we fished the weeds for pike it gave me a chance to experiment with those weedline walleyes that I have read about. I only experimented a few hours but was happy with eyes from 13 - 22 inches. (jigging leaches and casting cranks). My sister, wife and 9 year old were each excited to catch new personal best walleyes. (nothing great, the largest was my sisters only at 23 inches). My 11 year old didn't break his old record, but did catch a 22 incher and quite a few smaller ones! The walleye fishing did not meet my expectations, however I consider it a success because everyone quickly voted that we go back to Minaki in 2006. My wife recommended that I spend 2 weeks in Canada in 2006 so I get a chance to fish too! ;) Can't beat that! IaCraig"

550915,Guest,2005-08-01 10:41:00,0,"This was our third year of going to Minaki, We just got back yesterday. We will not be going back next year. Let's be honest, the fishing sucked! Catching a couple walleyes a day is not exactly the ""Canada Experiance"""
550925,Guest,2005-08-01 14:53:00,0,"Yep...it's like the Red Tide has swept through the Winnipeg River and killed most of the Walleye. Great musky system though, maybe all those hogs are eating the walleye........."
550928,Reels,2005-08-01 15:13:00,2876,"All the reading I have done, says a healthy walleye lake always has a bigger population of smaller fish verses bigger fish. Over the last 5 years or so, it has been harder to catch fish under 18"". Last two years, I cant remember catching a fish under 17"". Somehow it got knocked out of wack. Bad spawns? Over harvest? I don't know, but the MNR recognized it and acted accordingly. Maybe too late... but acted. A real heart breaker, as I love the place. It will bounce back though. Mother nature has a way of correcting things. <{{}}><"
550930,KSauers,2005-08-01 16:18:00,385,Can't remember catching a fish under 17? Where were you fishing? Not Minaki thats for sure. We mostly muskie fish but spend a couple of hours a day walleye fishing and out of the 116 we caught 100 were under the slot. It's been that way the last several years.
550931,Reels,2005-08-01 16:24:00,2876,"Little sand and big sand. Never fished gun much, except for northerns. Maybe I had bigger minnows?? :-) <{{}}><"
550932,Guest,2005-08-01 16:27:00,0,"Reels, Just a question and please understand that I am not trying to create a border battle or anything else but it makes me wonder if health of the fishery is the only issue when the limit reduction only applies to non-residents. It seems to me that if the fishery had issues, the correct move by the MNR would be lower the limts regardless. I suppose they could calculate how much the consumption would be reduced by just limiting it to non-residents and maybe that # met their goals. It just seemed odd is all. Also, maybe I don't have all the facts but when we got out licenses, they did tell us that the limit reduction was for non-residents. Thanks for listening. We have been going to Minaki for quite a few years and we booked again next year however a change may be coming as the walleye fishing has definitely changed. We are not meat hunters by any means but the fishing is down considerably, especially the size of the fish. Slim"
550935,Reels,2005-08-01 17:41:00,2876,"Good question... From my understanding, Kenora politics heavily argued against the reduction in limits, and it seems to be some sort of political compromise. They claim that residents take less than 5% of the fish, and they should not be effected because they pay their taxes, and it is non-residents harming the population. I certainly do not know all the facts, so please don't flame me guys. Just what my friends and resort owner tell me and what I have read in the local papers. If you search the archives, I have been posting for two years or so that the fishery was drastically changing. Some called me nuts, some agreed. I have been going for 19 years two to three weeks a year. So, I'm no expert, but this is my opinion. <{{}}><"
550945,Guest,2005-08-01 21:26:00,0,"The limits should definately be for everyone. If you stay at Paradise Cove, the guy in the cabin next to you could be from Manitoba and is considered a resident. As I recall there are a lot of people from MB staying there. Its a load...."
550950,IaCraig,2005-08-02 06:01:00,434,"Steve, I was there the same week you were. I am curious, how late in the evening were you having the best luck with the Big Sand troll? And if you tried it on the calm night of Friday the 29th was it better? I hit it the rough water nights of Sat, Sun & Mon, and didn't start getting strikes before 9:40. Which makes the boat ride back to Minaki pretty dark, but I noticed some boats were just starting to troll around 10:00 when I usually pack up. When the weather cleared later in the week I assumed the troll got better, but my family was kind of burned out on it so we did other things. IaCraig"
550951,Guest,2005-08-02 07:00:00,0,"You know, I never even thought about the guys that were there from other provinces in Canada to fish in Minaki. Duh! That makes me even more ticked off. I saw lots of cars from Alberta & Manitoba when I drove over by Paradise Cove and so yes, they can keep 4 fish. Nice. So, since the season is only about 12 - 14 weeks and quite a few ""tourists"" are Canadian tourists, the theory that ""tourists"" take most of the fish really doesn't hold water. Go figure. Thanks for ticking me off even more! Just kidding. It would seem to be a no brainer that if the conservation do dah experts decide that fish between 17-3/4 and 27-1/2 are the main reproducers and have such a major impact on the future fisheries and that taking two instead of 4 will do wonderful magical things, it should be for everyone. Especially the residents because it is their fisherie they are trying to save in the first place. They should want to participate since their country is getting such a boost from us. The non residents. No fish, no us. No us, well, you know. On the issue of trolling BIG SAND. It is interesting that you said you saw people just starting to troll at 10:00. In the past, we have always gotten up there about 7:00 p.m. and trolled until almost dark. The fish were always out deep over that 200 fow which still amazes me. Towards dark we would set a heading to the area between Green Island and the clay banks and troll through there, pick up and make the run home. 3 years ago we had the theory that the fish would hit all night. We ran out there at midnight and fished until morning. We absolutely had a blast. Dead calm water and fish everywhere. The ciscos were busting all over the top. We tried it last year and again this year and got nothing. We saw no ciscos and therefore no fish. We trolled from 1:00 a.m. to 6:00 and went back to the cabin to pass out. I have no idea what happened to make that change. The only thing that was different that first year was the water level. It was the highest ever recorded. I think it was about 6' above normal. It was before Paradise Cove built the new cabins on the point. We did catch fish the couple of times we made it out there this year. The one night was so rough when we got there that we turned around and went back. One of our other guys stayed and got a couple of 19's before heading back. I love fishing but the family was with me and there were a couple that were close to hurling. The night my son got his 30"" was flat. I think it was Wednesday. The other 29-1/2"" we did not get out there. I did not fish Friday night. We bring our own boat and I usually pull it out and start packing around 3:00 and just relax so we were done. Next year I may have to try fishing later and see if that does better. Something has to. Steve"
550954,Guest,2005-08-02 08:26:00,0,"Fellas...with regards to the crank bite on Big Sand. My father does really well during the last week of July and month of August every year high water or not. He doesn't even bother going out before 10:00pm though. He does well just off the drop off outside of West Bay (Towards the main lake) and also just West of the Beach over the deep water. I just spoke to him and he said they were catching some big Walleye 25+ inchers but few in the legal slot size. Also, more muskie caught this year than any he can remember."
550968,KSauers,2005-08-02 16:11:00,385,The way i understand it was some resort owner was complaining of the 4 fish caught during walleye tournaments by US and that some of them were dying. He *****ed loud enough and I guess he;s got some pull and taa daa 2 fish for US

This will be my second trip there, and my dad's first, so lots of questions for you Minaki vets... 1. Walleye regulations: We mostly fish for muskies, but wanted to do a few shore lunches with the 'eyes. What is the new daily possession limit? And what is the protected slot? 2. Water levels: As last year was my first trip there, I don't really know what is ""normal"". Just called the LWCB toll free #, and the recorded message says the water level has declined by 37 inches since peaking on July 12, and is expected to decline by an additional 12 inches over the next 2 weeks. Would that bring water levels back to normal? Or would they still be high, even at that point? 3. Walleye Trolling: How deep are you running your baits? And is a planer board necessary? I was just planning on flat lining some #5 Glass Shad Raps. Will this be effective? Or what else would you recommend to achieve proper depth? 4. Muskies: As this is the main purpose of our trip, I'm wondering if any of you guys heard any musky reports while you were up there? I realize this is a bunch of questions, but any info would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance, ""Jackpot"" John Schroeder"

551032,Reels,2005-08-03 20:31:00,2876,"For trolling on big sand, I like #7's and 9's. Clown, pearl white, pearch are some of my foavorite and most productive. Just see how high they are on your graph and you will know what bait to put on. Don't be afraid to fish the reefs for lunch. Evening is best for the troll on big sand, but it they are on, you can get them all day. As for boards, I like to use them, even for bottom bouncers if the bite is tough. Bottom bouncers or jigs on the reefs north of green, the beach, behind burnt, the rock pile or trappers cabin should get you lunch. Fish the wind swept areas. Smallies should be shallow on the reefs now. Muskie reports have been great this year. You should have a great time if that is your target. Good luck, let us know how you do! <{{}}><"

I have line counters on my reels and I start with 160' on the lead and adjust as needed. If I were forced to have only one bait to use, I would pick the one with the fire tiger pattern. I have had great success on any deep diving crank in that pattern. Of course I fish the #### out of it so maybe I am not giving the others equal chance. Just my preference. Steve"

551253,Guest,2005-08-09 08:15:00,0,July 1 And that regulation seems to be working well for that body of water.
551026,Guest,2005-08-03 19:00:00,0,"Jackpot, 1) Possession limits for walleyes is 2 per day with a full license and 1 with a conservation license. Walleyes must be between approximately 13.75 and 17.75 inches, or over 28 to keep. These are approximations, so you might want to check the actual regs. I went to the convenience store at Paradise Cove 3 and they had a nice boat sticker which had a ruler showing legal sizes with text explaining the regulations. It was free, and I found it very handy. 2) If water levels drop another foot or so, I believe they will be close to normal, but still a bit high. 3) Instead of #5 shad raps, I would recommend #9's as this is the most commonly used bait for trolling on Big Sand. Let out about 150 feet of line and run your boat around 3 mph. Fish will be suspended in the deep water of Big Sand. 4) Everyone I talked to said muskie fishing has been outstanding this whole year. I only talked directly to one muskie fisherman last week while I was there. He had 4 large muskie up to the boat the prior day, but wasn't able to land any. Don't know what he did from that point on. We had a difficult week of fishing with consistantly high winds and rapidly dropping water, concentrating mostly on walleye. We were able to pick up enough eaters each day for shore lunch, and to bring home. Our biggest was 23 inches, which is well below our normal high. Finally got on them the last couple of days, and caught decent numbers, including eating size. Trolling was not real effective during our week, but should be much better now with some stable weather. People were doing better after dark, but our experience from prior years is that the trolling bite is very good between 7-10 in the evening. Hope this helps, and good luck."

550942,Guest,2005-08-01 20:04:00,0,"O.k., My turn. I too just got back from Minaki. We were there from July 23 - 30. Had similar complaints. A lot has to do in that system with the water management people raising and lowering the h20. It happens all the time and really slaps a lock jaw mainly on the eyes. When we got there on Saturday we were told that the water was about 4 feet above normal but was on the drop. By weeks end it had gone down about 18"". My first time at Minaki 5 years ago was during all time record high water and I learned to fish it that way and was quite successful. The next year was almost identical. This year was unusal because we normally go the 3rd week in July and this year the resort owner switched all the dates so everybody went a week later. Not that a week makes that much difference but we did here that the previous week was much better. Of Course!!!! The combination of going a week later, high water on the drop, temps dropping from the 80's for two days to the 60's pretty much the rest of the week, and really pain in the butt winds made for a challenging year. We do the evening troll on Big Sand every night and we did not even attempt to go there until the 3rd day and that was not so fun. We finally got there on Tuesday and had a calm evening. My 12 year old son pulled one off a board with a silver tail dancer. His personal best and mine too 30"". Very skinny fish though. We also boated a Northern about 33"" with a mouthfull of still skwirming ciscos. Never seen that before. My son, that little bugger got a 29-1/2"" earlier in the week so I was feeling pretty sub par. We were trolling and anyone could have pulled them in but I am glad it was him instead of me. (sort of) we are having a repro done of the bigger one. We really kind of switched to Northerns after that and were spanking them pretty good as well as most of the other cabins. I bet the limits change for them too soon enough because a lot of people are taking the Northerns that normally woud not. I personally saw at least a 100 Northerns harvested and that was just from our group. If that holds true for all the other resorts, it won't take long. I too have a major problem with the limits being enforced to non residents only. So we take 4 fish home 1 day per year. The resident could take 4 per day. How does that math work out? I love the place and will continue to go back for at least one of my weeks in Canada. I have been pressured to give Lac Seul a try next year for one of the weeks. I fished it years ago and had a bad trip. Switched to Minaki as a result of that and on a recommendation from ""Reels"". Thanks Ron. Ultimately the trip is what you make of it. I go to fish but to enjoy the place itself and the friends I have made staying at the same place during the same week for several years. If I were new to it, I might change. Not now. Not yet. By the way, the resort owner told me Friday evening that the water management people were going to drop the water 3 feet during the next week. It will be going down fast. I thought we had it bad. Interested in reading what this weeks group had for luck. Thanks for listening. Just my 2 cents. Steve"
