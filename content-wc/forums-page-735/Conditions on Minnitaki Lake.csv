Our group will be staying at Abram Lake Park on Abram Lake, however, there is access to Minnitaki and other areas. Has anyone been there during the last week or so and could give me some info on water level, temps, fishing conditions, hotspots, best bait, etc. I have fished Minnitaki quite abit but not too much during the fall. I usually go to Deception Bay and into Lac Seul this time of year. If anyone can give info there, it would be appreciated. I have never fished Senn Bay, but want to try it this year. I read in a earlier post that Minnitaki wasn't producing very well. May need to go down as far as Redpine Bay and Southwest Bay. I have three first timer with me on this trip and they are getting excited. Thanks in advance for any help. Eyesnatcher"
551495,DanL,2005-08-15 22:36:00,262,We just got back on the 13th. of August. The last 2 years have been tough fishing for us on Minnitaki. The water levls are normal. We were able to catch 10-15 Walleyes most mornings and evenings which is pretty poor for this lake in my opinion. We had to try many different spots as compared to other years. We ended up doing our best on the Arm. We fished a couple bars and islands in the 12 - 25 foot areas. The bite was light and the jigs needed to be presented slowly. The narrows also produced the last couple of days. We did not have any days that were fast and furous. The reef on Minnitaki was slow for us as were the islands we fish on the big lake. After 2 years of slow fishing we are considering going to Lac Suel next year.
551502,IaDave,2005-08-16 09:10:00,476,Has the fishing on Minnitaki declined that much? Last time I fished there was 2 yrs this Sept. and we caught plenty of fish-not the 100 or more people say they catch on Lac Seul in a day but enough to keep me interested. I remember someone posting a report last fall that a few fish they caught look thin or sickly. Hate to hear the fishing decline there as I really enjoyed going there and kind of thinking of a trip next month. Anymore reports. Eyesnatcher- Hope to hear a great report when you get back.
551505,Guest,2005-08-16 09:45:00,0,"This time of year i do good above or below the rapids at frog or abram chutes on minnataki. i was up the first week of august and pulled a few dozen fish there and at the train bridge west of town. there is a boat ramp there as well. might have caught more if my two kids were not catching eachother but the action was very steady, not big, but steady with minnows right on the bottom in 15 to 20 foot holes or points then up to less then 3ft at dawn/dusk."
551507,Guest,2005-08-16 10:12:00,0,"I haven't fished Minnitaki myself this time of year, but this june i was eating dinner in town before heading out to lac seul, and we happened to start talking with a guide on Minnitaki. We had planned to fish Minnitaki later this year so he was giving us a lot of pointers on the lake. He said the key is to fish deeper than most people fish for walleye's, especially this time of year. He said 40+ feet is typical for him, with heavy jigs. He claimed you can catch bigger walleyes in Minnitaki than anywhere in the area and excellent numbers, including lac seul, but that Lac Seul will always be champ for numbers. So I guess if you head up that way, you might want to at least check out some deeper spots off points you would normally fish. I always assumed fish that deep must be whitefish, but I think it would be worth a try."
551509,IaDave,2005-08-16 10:24:00,476,"That makes sense. The first fall we were there the owner of the resort said find 30' holes and start there using heavy white jigs tipped with a big minnow. Once we found them we tried to stay as vertical as possible. Caught a lot of bigger fish-above 22"" but I am always afraid to bring them up from the deep water-Just wonder if they survive after you release them. Tried to bring them up slow thinking that helps. If we were catching the smaller fish at 30' we would go as deep as 40' to find the bigger fish."
551510,DanL,2005-08-16 12:34:00,262,When we fished Minnitaki in August of 2002 and 2003 the fishing was very good for numbers and size. I find it hard to beleive that the fishery has declined in just 2 years. It could be the weather or abundace of forage or just not fishing the right areas. We fished where we ussually fish in August. We heard from a few people that overall Lac Suel was a better fishery but I don't know since I have never fished it. As far as fishing 40 feet of water in August that is something I try to avoid. I have read that fish caught from that deep in the summer do not survive as well. The resort owner mentioned that the MNR talked of changing the regulations somewhat. He did not say in what way and there was no mention of any problems on Minnitaki. Are plan is to go back next year and hope for better fishing. We sure like the lake.
