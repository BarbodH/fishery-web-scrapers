Then Qwest sold me their new plan which was on their new and improved network. That's when it went bad. Then Qwest merged with AT&T, and they sold me their national plan, the phone was suppose to work almost anywhere. And then AT&T is now Cingular. Now when driving from the Twin Cities to Canada, about the only place my cell phone works is around the Grand Rapids/Deer River Area. They can put a car on Mars and communicate with it 72 Million miles away, but the cell service is getting worse instead of better. Does anyone have a good recommendation for cell phone service that works in the Twin Cities and Baudette? Thanks"

Mine switches between digital and analog as needed. At least ask that question when your buying the phone.
