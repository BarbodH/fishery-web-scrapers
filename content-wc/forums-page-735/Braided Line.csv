551471,Guest,2005-08-15 14:59:00,0,Depends...what lb test? I used 14lb braided with a leader....worked fine.
551475,Guest,2005-08-15 15:55:00,0,"I have use Fireline (a monofiliment made of the same material as braided) It does not stretch. I have used it in Canada for about 5 yrs and really like it. We do a lot of trolling. If I set the drag right, when a lure is snagged, I have been able to pull it out after backing up. Or if snagged on wood have often just pulled it up. The big advantage is that one can feel the lure much better than regular monofiliment. It is noticeable when it catches a weed. I use 20 lb line."
551484,sidewinder,2005-08-15 18:09:00,96,I have used cabelas ripcord for years on a stained lake with good success. We have fished some clearer lakes and fireline seems to outproduce braided lines and flourocarbon and cajun the same or better. I like braided line but guess I will be spooled with 14lb and 20 lb fireline on our Sept trip. Also will use florocarbon some also. I think fireline might be more visible during bright light and maybe invisible at sunrise and sunset. Just my observations on trip in July. sidewinder
551488,Guest,2005-08-15 19:34:00,0,I would not even think of going back to mono. I too have used fireline for 5 years. 8 lb trolling for walleye and I use 20lb for the big stuff. But if you do get hung up you will need a boat paddle to break it with because the hands will just not do it. TUFF stuff! Good luck. Elmo
551493,sidewinder,2005-08-15 21:25:00,96,"wrap a towel around your hand then wrap fireline around couple of times. make sure the slack is out. pull steady,make sure line is not touching your skin or it might cut your hand off. just kidding can give you a nasty cut. had a pike wrap line around my finger once just barely got line off be fore he jumpede. I am convinced it would have cut my finger off sidewinder"
551497,IaCraig,2005-08-16 05:45:00,434,"For trolling I used to strictly use 10 lb mono, but I've recently tried trying braided and I like it better. It took me a long time to convert for trolling because I was always told that when you troll with brided that you will get alot more missed hits because with the no stretch it will tear the mouths of the walleyes. (that has not been my experience though). For jigging & braided I only use braided because it gives me much better sensitivity and the smaller diameter allows me to fish deeper without getting too far behind the boat. With jigs I tie braided directly to the jig, with bottom bouncing I tie braid to the bouncer then a 5-6 foot florocarbon leader to the hook. Have a nice trip! IaCraig"

It costs a little more but will not rot so you don't change it as often and if you want that little bit of stretch on a snag, tie a short length of mono before your hook."
