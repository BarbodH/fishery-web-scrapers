551567,Mike Kansas,2005-08-17 17:55:00,1463,Just returned from three great days of service and fishing at Silver Water Wheel. This was our second trip there and I just wanted to say thanks to Mike and all his staff. We take several of our customers on this trip and we of course want it to be a trip that they enjoy and one that will enhance our relationship with each customer. SWWL is a great host and they not only put us all on fish they feed us like Kings. Thanks Again SWWL
