520707,Guest,2002-06-13 06:31:00,0,"Good stay home, we dont need ignorant people like you in Canada anyway. We have politicians for that, they are responsible for that stupid law not us fisherman. You probably bring everything with you and spend a total of 10 bucks anyway. But keep posting your stupid messages, we have a sense of humour here."
520711,Wawajake,2002-06-13 08:29:00,413,"ForkyWhy do you pay more for car insurance if you had a few previous accidents, or are a younger driver etc, its because they are identified risks now. Similarily someone with previous DUI is a risk too. Is it fair probably not, but thats done thruout the world and business. So thats the choice our Government has made when it comes to drinking and driving risks on our roads. So in an effort to still accomadate situations that probably could be not as much of a risk they have a paperwork system to purge it from Canadian records. Unfortunately paperwork and bureacracy costs money.So if people not from our country want to enter for whatever reason this may apply. Unfortunately it impacts fisherman too , but bureacracy rarely has room for exceptions. So it depends on the discretion of border people that process you to enforce the rules they are paid to enforce or turn a blind eye if they are comfortable with situation they are presented. Bellbuoy above seems to have covered all the years and dates as they apply to this policy very well and new changes he lists are much more forgiving it seems.jake"
520708,Guest,2002-06-13 15:58:00,0,"When you come to my house you obey my rules or you go home. I think, Canada has made changes that unless you are a habitual violator you will get in ok. I have never been hasseled going into Canada, they have always been courteous. I can't say the same for the US side comming back.Unbelievable, you have it wrong on the 10 bucks. Most camp owners buy locally and support the local economy. When I was there in May the resturants were full of US fishermen, the gas station in Vermilion Bay had 8 cars gassing up, all were from the US. People were buying tackle and licenses. We made at least 5 trips to the local grocery while we were there. just my opinion."
520712,Guest,2002-06-13 18:49:00,0,"maybe Canada should open it's borders like the US and give every lower being a bunch of money when they arrive and give them a hefty monthly allowance and give them a house and protect with more of ""our"" money them when the local working class get upset about their ""FREE"" subsidies. Don't get me going. Sorry about the quick venting session. When I'm fishing none of this crap bothers me. I wouldn't care what lake I'm on or what country I choose to fish in.Rules are rules. Get loud or live by them. I do know the walleye are toast on Lac Seul in late June.7 out"
520709,Guest,2002-06-13 19:59:00,0,Why do you think it's any difference going the other way.I am 45 years old and had a minor simple possession charge when I was 17 years old!!! I was turned back at the US border heading for a trip with my family into the US.So stay home and enjpoy the lousy fishing in the States.I'll stay in Canada and enjoy ours here. You guys drive me crazy with your one sided views. Take a look at your own F?!?@?#$ laws first!!!!
520713,Guest,2002-06-14 02:25:00,0,"you guy's from Canada have a real chip on your sholder! Maybe if you did'nt have such a infeariority complex you could treat visitors from your neighboring country a little bit nicer. If you want to turn back DUI's going back 15 years, so be it. The Americans that are allowed in, and spend big bucks, are looked at like some form of second class citizens. From what I saw of the people of Longlac, was a bunch of sloppy pigs, under aged mothers, and a future from #####. I don't care what you think, I will continue to go back to Canada, and stay at a Lodge owned and run by Americans, and catch all your ****ed fish I want to. So go stick that up your Maple Leaf. Your hockey teams such also!"
520714,Wawajake,2002-06-14 05:03:00,413,"PikenutI shouldn't reply to you, considering most Canadians know that most Americans are not as ignorant as you exposed in your post.Next time your visiting Northern Ontario you will probably see more sloppy pigs and underage mothers and other society ills because the logging towns you go thru are being put out of business by supposed free trade deals that don't allow our Canadian lumber into our ""good neighbors"" country without 30% tarriffs that price our lumber out of the market.So as you can see both countries have laws and protectionist governments that have good intentions to protect their own citizens but hurt everyone caught in between.Got to keep this short , I have an appointment with my Psychologist for my inferiority complex and there is ussually a big line up :) jakePS your Hockey team is made up of 70% canadians and 20% Europeansso don't let your head swell too much.( I don't want you to have to buy a larger fishing hat.)"
520715,Guest,2002-06-15 08:09:00,0,"Calm down everyone. My Mom is American and Dad is a Canuck, I have dual citizenship and live in Canada. I have been crossing the border since I was a month old. I have a bit of experience when it comes to border crossings. Most of the same rules apply going south as well.We were golfing in Niagara on the Canadian side and decided to cross the ditch for some wings afterwards. One of the passengers in the car had a 25 year old assault conviction on his record from when he was a teen, we were all detained for 6 hours, the bottom line was that US Immigration and Naturalization confiscated the drivers car, all of our clubs. He was charged with transporting a felon across US border.The outcome was that we all had to appear in US court in Buffalo and it took him over a year to get his car back. The clubs all misteriously dissappeared and the car was virtualy a wreck when he got it back after severel thousands of dollars of legal fees.We both have obscure laws that we must all abide by.Yes we need US dollars in Canada, and the US needs to trade with us as well. Ontario is the largest trading partner the US has, second largeat is the rest of Canada.Know the laws on both sides and understand that we are different, we must both be proud of and celebrate our differences."
520716,Marc Thorpe,2002-06-16 04:11:00,384,"Hi guys,good topic other than some negatives, Canada/USA.Why no clue,but here's a secret.We are all from the same seed or cell,whatever your beleif is?So why argue about nationality,were all direct descendents of Europeans.The law is the law no matter what side you live on.We must respect it.There are means around it and in some time we can all assume this issue will be curbed by our law obiding politicians(if thats possible).Marc"
520717,Guest,2002-06-17 07:06:00,0,Just got back from the worst weather/fishing trip ever! However i was driving my vehicle with a old dui (8yrs) ago and it was the fastest crossing ever. The guy with the attitude was on the usa side.
520698,tracker,2002-06-07 10:43:00,91,"Again this is a topic of great debate. I know when something gets in the way of my hunting and fishing that I feel is not right, I go to the source and find out why. My question is, does one just boycott Canada because of this DUI problem? Would it not be in your best interest to talk to your member of congress and get the facts , than react upon them. Maybe the resorts in Canada could start a petition that could be forwarded to our Ministers of Parliament. It is issues like this that take years to resolve, now is a good time to start. As for which Countries politics are right or wrong, we can debate it forever but we are supposed to be allies so we should all lose the "" my country is the best attitude"". A DUI is a felony in Canada, I did not make it one, the other members who have responded to this posts and others like it did not make it one. Direct your anger and concerns to the powers that have made it one. If you would like, I can give you the addresses to members of our Canadian parliament."
520699,tracker,2002-06-07 10:51:00,91,"After writing my first post I went and read the general discussions threads and what did I find,"" Let's boycott Canada "" because their security is too lax at the borders. Now I'm really confused!!"
520700,Guest,2002-06-08 06:49:00,0,"Hey Tracker. Obviously the Canadian lodges and camps are upset about this Canadian law and they have lobbied parlaiment with some success.The ""10 year"" law that goes into effect June 28 appears to be mostly due to their lobbying. Also went thru the sluggish parlaiment process quite quickly. They just need to push on and make this less of a border money-grubbing deal for us tourists / fisherman so we don't have to get so steamed up when we want to spend our money in your country to keep your economy going. I think tourism is one of your main industries and it is quite obvious which country feeds your tourism the most. I like Canada and I did pay the price to clear my 20 year old record but it still brought on some anger paying the bill.7 out"
520701,tracker,2002-06-08 09:01:00,91,"Thanks guide#7, finally someone with some positive feedback. The only thing that can be done is for the tourists to keep up the lobbying on this issue."
520702,Guest,2002-06-11 05:05:00,0,"crossed sault st marie last week with a guy that had two dui's in the last eight years. we got stopped, sent inside had our id's checked and then sent on our way to fish heaven. I think it all depends on the mood of the crossing guard."
520703,Guest,2002-06-11 17:17:00,0,Hey pikenut: My guess is the people that checked your id's were customs agent and not immigration people. Immigrations agents would have sent you happily back to your home to sulk and unpack. Tell your buddy to clear himself or just be ready at the border with the required papers so he'd have a fighten chance of gettin' thru when the law is enforced on him. I wouldn't dare put my fishing party in this situation and ruin everbodies trip. 7 out
520704,Guest,2002-06-12 07:41:00,0,"hey guide 7,i could care less who it was that checked our id through the computer. We were sent inside by the crossing guard. told to park under an awning, and stood in front of a computer with a woman in uniform. We had all our papers and our confirmation letter from our lodge. I think you guys strike to much paranoia in to many people. We heard the risks and we went anyway. Besides there are a lot more places to fish than north of the boarder! I know alot of people that have been going to Canada for a long time. Some with dirt in the closet! I have yet to meet a person that has been turned away at the boarder for an old DUI, unless there was more to the story."
520705,Guest,2002-06-12 21:01:00,0,"Pikenut: Your right, there is more to my story. They did turn us back last spring for my 20 year old ghost, dui. Same scenario as you just got thru on. Lucky we were only looking to fish the border waters north of Crane and Namaken, we were still able to fish the US side. Only two of us on that trip and our accommodations were on the US side so it didn't fully spoil our trip. Was not fun learning of this old rule for the first time while standing at their desk.Do what you want and take your chances if you want.7 out"
520706,Jim,2002-06-13 04:19:00,238,"Those owning resorts state side have to enjoy what Canada is doing to their many potential guests. Guests who would leave behind thousands and thousands of dollars. Case and point: I typically see Canadian waters on at least three occasions per year and will now explore more local waters verses exposing myself to this ridiculous treatment. Having one of those ghosts (great term by the way) will never risk crushing a Canadian fishing trip with friends by getting sent home. My ghost being 18 years past and being dry for 12 is proof that I would be a great guest. Why? I learn from my mistakes. The real disappointment here has to fall in the lap of those owning resorts north of the boarder. Sadly, they are the ones losing. I will still have a great open water fishing season down under. Take care all!"
520710,Forky,2002-06-13 05:57:00,0,"I appreciate everyone's post and I am not trying to bash Canada at all but I have a question: Why do I have to pay a fee to come into Canada if I had a dui in America (not Canada), paid whatever penalty/sentence was imposed by our courts and if I was punished/ sentenced by our courts and completed that penalty am I not now rehabilitated? I broke no law in Canada, I broke a law in the United States and paid a price for it. It just seems to me that it is more of an attempt to collect $ from people visiting their country. Just me opinion.Forky"
520688,2746,2002-05-27 09:30:00,3206,Will be going back up to Canada in August and a friend going with us has had a dui some time in the las 4-7 years. I've read on this board that can be a problem. Can someone explain exactly what we might expect or point us to the law on this matter? This individual will not be driving nor will we have his vehical.
520689,bellbuoy,2002-06-05 15:50:00,490,"Larry,Here's what Gail Hocket of Witch Bay Camp on LOTW is telling her guests:DWI s this seems to be a major topic since 9/11 and the subsequent increase of checks on criminal convictions at the border. On June 28, Bill C11 will change the rules regarding non residents entering Canada with minor convictions including DWI's in their past. As it stands now a person entering with a minor conviction on their record (no matter how long ago) must be rehabilitated or apply for a temporary 30 day permit to enter Canada. If the offense is more than 5 years old rehabilitation can be handled in advance through the Canadian Immigration Offices at either Fort Francis or Thunder Bay. If the offense is less than 5 years old or if the offense is more than 5 years old and the time requirements do not allow for the rehabilitation process before your trip there is a 30 day pass called a Discretionary Entry Permit that can only be handled at the port of entry and cannot be processed in advance. It is highly recommended that these guests call the immigration office in advance to get an indication as to the chance of their admittance. Both these options have a process fee of 200.00 Canadian Dollars or roughly 125.00-150.00 U.S. dollars, depending on the exchange rate at the time. After June 28 if the offense is older than 10 years old you are considered rehabilitated. If the offense is between 5 and 10 years old than you can be rehabilitated no charge by obtaining the forms and filling them out. If the offense is less than 5 years old you would have a very good chance of entering if you called ahead, have reservations in Canada, and have only one conviction less than 5 years old. There is the 200.00 Canadian Dollars process fee in this situation. Please use good judgement, honesty, and manners in your interaction with immigration officials and your chances will be greatly enhanced. For more info contact immigration at Fort Francis 807-274-3818 and their hours are from 8 am to 12 midnight.Bellbuoy"
520690,Guest,2002-06-05 17:27:00,0,"I've read several times that AFTER June 28th, if a DUI is over 10 years old, you are considered rehabilitated. If I am crossing on the 28th, will the old law still be in effect, or do I need to wait untill the 29th?"
520691,2746,2002-06-06 10:56:00,3206,"BellbouyThanks for your response. That's just the kind of information we were wanting. We had just about concluded that we would wait snd see if it were even an issue. If it was would buy the permit and be on our way. Some posts on this board, however, indicated that it was possible entry would not be allowed. Your info sounds like a call ahead of time might be in order to assure entry, but of course, then purchasing the permit is certain. Guess we'll just have to make that choice. Any other experience out there that would help?"
520692,Guest,2002-06-06 14:58:00,0,"Good info Bellbouy. The only thing I question is the ""no charge"" rehab. app. process if between 5-10 year old offence. I think they will still charge the $200.00 canadian processing fee. Use a credit card and your card company will get you the current exchange rate. The whole thing took me about 2-1/2 weeks to clear up for a 20 year old ghost in the closet. The key was to get right to the in charge guy at the port where you are crossing (Fort Frances) and exactly explain your situation. They were extremely friendly and helpful and did what they said they would do. They send a letter that you are to bring along as your entry pass. Good Luck7 out"

520695,Guest,2002-06-07 06:18:00,0,"Hey Local. If it is a felony in Canada, then tell me the difference between a minor and major felony. They seem to have a couple, or more classifications. They might as well call them misdemeanors as they are in the USA. In the USA a felony is a felony!I'm ok that Canada at least realizes that a dui is not as big a deal as a bank robbery, murder, grand theft, etc. I still like the fishing but LundAnglerMJ sure makes me think about where to fish.Guide#7"
