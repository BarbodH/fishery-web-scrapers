A 'what if everyone does this' scenario is built to make sure the population is sustainable. Locals and everyone else will probably take a few 30 inch plus fish in their lifetime without having any effect on the population. 30 inch fish are not protected for maintaining a quantity of fish, but rather a quality. They are past their reproductive peak as far as a volume of viable eggs, however with each year that passes they increase their value as a genetic specimen. To live to be about 14 years old, they would have to be disease resistant, have a strong musculo-skeletal system and have strong survival and predatory instincts. Their food-source value at this point is negligable. The MNR could even fine-tune the slots even more, but it would make it far too confusing for the likes and me and my fishing buddies to try and follow. A side bonus is that area with slot limit walleye protection have also seen a boom in the musky population as more of the 15-25 inch walleye are around for yummy musky snacks. Don't believe me? Try and land a 14 inch walleye in the French River without having to wrestle a musky for it at the side of the boat."
521242,Wenty,2002-06-11 09:24:00,15,"Since I started this string, I guess I need to respond. I appreciate everyone's responses. I think Roger probably put it best. We each have our own personal ethics when it comes to sport fishing and others have theirs and we need to respect that as well. I will continue to release healthy fish in excess of 18"" because that is how I feel, and I will continue to cringe and bite my teeth the next time someone keeps and cleans a 9lbs walleye.As for the resort owner who remained anonymous, I think you should post your resort's name. Your ideals will attract a growing clientele. No, I too do not want to loose anymore of my hunting and fishing rights, but there is a certain populas who do approach fishing as a ""fill the freezer"" rite of passage. I know because tomorrow morning I'll have 10 more avid angelers from the south, with some ready to keep anything that they hook. By Sunday I will have shown them the virtue of watching a 27"" walleye swim away.'nuff said"
521244,Guest,2002-06-11 11:39:00,0,"If its a legal fish, its legal to eat. If your personal value/ethics system is offended, thats something you need to address. Limits/slots are there for a reason and if you disagree with keeping a legal fish, work to get the laws changed. I'm not saying I agree with keeping the large ones, but if someone else chooses to, thats their business.What about hunting season? Is there any reason to kill a trophy 10 point buck when you could take its picture? We all know that the meat from a small buck or doe tastes better. But how many of you will pass up a 10 pointer and go for the spike?"
521246,Thumper,2002-06-11 15:12:00,133,It is not my right to tell a person who has caught a legal fish what to do with it. That is their choice and their fish. People have different catch and release policy and that is their choice. I will keep bigger fish if thats all I caught and we are setting up for a fish fry. They are in the wrong place at the wrong time. I do not make a habit of it but it happens. Gill damaged or injured fish also end up being used. I am a practical ethical sportman who also enjoys eating fish.
521245,Guest,2002-06-11 15:15:00,0,i abide by the rules of the lake. this day and age management of the fishery has proven successful so let it be. personally i don't keep fish beyond the slot only because the slot at our lake is generous enough at the lower end to allow for enough food fish. i think it's 16-22 or so. 13-18 seems a bit tough but whatever. big fish? to eat? ugh!
521243,Guest,2002-06-11 19:11:00,0,"Sound like the best option is to have total C&R and let mother nature control the fish populations. Before man began to ""control"" the fisheries it seemed that mother nature didn't need any help. Based on you views, no fish should be taken from the waters. Shoot, small fish>grow to be big fish, so taking small fish also jepordizes future generations. I see many lakes that are C&R for pike in Canada>why not for walleyes??? Why not make it no fish over the slot knowing a fiberglass replica is possible and will last longer.It really gets the hair on my neck standing up when I hear ""locals"" dictating what I should or shouldn't do when I ""fish their lake"". Hog-wash. If the law states that I can keep X number of fish>I'm entitled to that period. Don't like it, then change the law! I agree that a big fish should be returned to the water>but then again, the person has a choice, based on the law as to what is done with said fish.If you told me that I couldn't keep any fish based on the law, you would still see me @ my favorite lake north of the border. To me, the fun is catching, with a nice fish dinner as a bonus, after a great day of fishing!"
521247,Guest,2002-06-13 05:54:00,0,"I agree with not eating those big fish. The lake association of camp owners has a rule ""A trophy is a trophy"". They ask that all fish over the slot be released unless you intend to mount the fish. - Don't eat those big ones. No one has a problem with that.Sure, with one over the slot these people eating these fish are legal, but ethically we must ask ourselves ""why does the law allow you to keep one fish over the slot?"" - I assume to keep a trophy. I am OK with someone keeping a trophy. I ethically disagree with eating a 25 inch fish . . . it is not yet a trophy, but only 2-3 years away!This policy has to come from the camp owner or lake association. If there is none, these people are legal. Perhaps the law should state one over the slot to be mounted?"
521248,tracker,2002-06-13 08:25:00,91,"The reason there is one over the maximum size is not because "" it's legal or someone may want to take a mount home"". It's because of biological data collected over the years says that the lakes can support that type of harvest. If there is a problem with that specific lake than generally there are lake specific rules for possession and slot sizes. Is the problem really about someone keeping a larger fish to eat or is it that you and your buddies are throwing those ones back when someone else is keeping them. I have a rule when I'm fishing, what ever happens in my boat is my business any thing else beyond it has no bearing on my fishing ethics, unless there is outright poaching going on, ( not just hear say or rumours, actual facts). Most fisherman can tell a story or two about the one they caught or got away, but they could write books about what another fisherman did that day. If you are so adamant about not keeping larger fish than you should get all your buddies together and lobby the MNR or DNR and get the regulations changed to suit your needs, until than MYOB."
521249,Guest,2002-06-14 04:11:00,0,"Boy oh boy have we opened a can of worms here. Locals will never allow Not being able to catch a big fish.Ethics no ethics, if the camp operator or association say NO BIG FISH then no big fish. If guest do not like camp rules then go to another camp or lake. simple to understand. I do not want to associate with those who do not like to abide by the rules.Remember ontario has set rules for the a large area, some lakes can sustaine a large number of big fish taken and others can't but we make fishing the same accross the all of NW ontario. A rule is a rule is a rule. Find out local policies and enjoy your fishng where you choose to go.If mama ain't happy then nobody is happy."
521250,Guest,2002-06-14 05:11:00,0,"I agree with Pickle, modify the law to cover for the lake or Providence,1 walleye over 30"" for mounting, but having every camp make their own rule is too subjective. Personally, I like to catch those big dogs on Lac Seul, take a picture, kiss em and throw them back to catch another time. I don't know about Lac Seul, because the growth rate is tremendous because of the food chain, but a 29"" walleye in lakes in midwest are older and therefore their reproductive effectiveness has diminished. I've caught a number in that 28"" range and am waiting for that 32-33"" before I club em and freeze to mount. Clubbing them, now there's a great rule! Don't let animal rights get a hold of that one!"
521251,Guest,2002-06-14 06:19:00,0,"Something to consider is that slot limits may increase the number of large fish taken just for a meal. If a guy is fishing and catching nothing but slot fish and then catches a 25+ incher, there's a good chance that he will be bringing this one home for supper or shore lunch when he'd normally throw it back and keep one or two slot size. I know I will. If everyone is disturbed by people keeping the larger fish, maybe they should lobby for keeping one or two in the slot and none over. Until then I'll assume the rule makers have more info on this than I do and not worry about it. If they think keeping one large fish has less on an impact on the lake than keeping several small, slot size, so be it. But no matter what happens, someone will be unhappy or think others unethical for following the law. I don't think this will ever change and I don't let it bother me anymore."
521232,Wenty,2002-06-10 11:10:00,15,"Fellow Anglers,I've seen this a few times this year and I just have to vent, so I thought that this might be the place to do it. What's the deal with people coming in with 25""+ walleyes only to fillet them moments later. The lake I fish on has a 13-18"" slot, with each angler being able to possess one fish in excess of 18"". So these people are well within their legal right to keep these big fish, but are they ethically right? I don't get it. With all the progress that we've made in terms of catch 'n release some people just seem to be oblivious to it.So here's my question. Am I wrong for being disgusted at these people? How do some of you out there handle this scene.Thanks a lot and for you folks headed this way, the walleye bite is starting to heat up.Take Care"
521233,Reels,2002-06-10 11:43:00,2876,"Well, you have to keep in mind, most people eating a 25"" walleye are not sprotsmen, they are people who fish maybe one week a year, if that. They haven't been taught the ethics of catch and release.As far as being disgusted, dont get mad at them, direct your angle to the people who established the laws. The fish they are taking are legal and not much you can do. <{{}}><"
521234,Wawajake,2002-06-10 12:30:00,413,"Yes it depends on whether they are regulars. I don't see a problem in a once or twice a year angler eating the odd big legal walleye they rarely catch. But if he or she is a regular angler and they will sit in the freezer or hand out to every brotherinlaw they have, then I am not happy about their resource respect. Now don't get me started on commercial fishing !! because the resource potential and even the business case per fish would show sport fishing to be more valuable to province. my 2 centsjake"
521235,WillieB,2002-06-10 13:26:00,292,"While they are in their legal rights, it's a shame that they're a tad behind in the morals/ethics of C+R.You can't tell me the big ones taste better, and I d_mn sure would rather have a crack at that big one next year, or let someone else enjoy the same thrill I had with him on the end of my line."
521236,Guest,2002-06-10 14:19:00,0,I don't think that there is anything wrong with a person keeping and eating a legal fish. The slots and limts are set to regulate the size and repoduction of the regulated fish species. I assume that those same fishermnan returned the slotted fish in compliance with game laws as most do. Most slots limit to one the larger fish one can take. When fishing in a group of boats when the fish are really snapping what I see is all those 18 to 23 inch fish going back. The occasional big fish being kept doesn't have that much impact overall. I just returned from a trip where over two days two of us caught over 100 W's all in the no-take slot. We were wonder if there were any 14 to 17 inchers in the lake. We went fishing for northerns for our dinner one night. This also serves to perserve the resource.If you have a personal issue with these fisherman based on your own value system you are just going to have to focus on something else or ruin your personal experience. TGG
521237,Guest,2002-06-10 19:35:00,0,"This is really a sore subject with me. We allow NO walleye over 18"" in our fish house unless you want to pack and get out asap. Sure the ""Law"" allows a big fish to provide a trophy oppertunity for those who want a mounter of a life time; but there is a HIGHER law of ethics no matter how often one fishes. Some people only fish a few times a year because of busy lives but I must say that to leave your depleated fisheries at home and come to Canada with a ""meat hog"" attitude is no excuse to start using selective tactics and enjoy plenty of fish dinners while allowing the brood stock to remain for tomorrows generations. I've sat for several years on the regs committee and if it weren't for our "" meat hog"" locals; the tourism segment of the group would surely opt for a much higher number on the top of the slots you see in place.Come for the greart fishing not the pounds of fish to show off at home. Now to get off the soap box and hope you all teach good sportsmanship to whom ever you can."
521238,Tracy,2002-06-10 20:13:00,376,"Whatever ROORC! Meat hogs drive all the way to your great country to haul out thier limit of 4 walleyes, give me a break! BTW, I could not help but notice that you left off your resort name after your comments about sending guests packing for keeping a legal fish. Is that so you keep the income coming until your guests violate your rule, then send home? Bet your guest return rate is great.Limits are set by the, MNR's, DNR's and WC's, experts to protect fisheries. Fish out of the slot are legal, and anyone paying the price of the license is entitled to their legal limit, American or Canadian. Your ""ethics"" are ideal and just a few steps short of PETA's. Just think about where the sport fishing industry will be headed in Canada in just a few more short years. Now 16-22"" no keep slot on most waters with only 1 over 22"" 4 total, soon will be none over 22"" and then 3 total, then 2, then 1, then none, then no fishing. Remember the spring Bear Hunts? Sell now while it's worth something. C+R is great and I am all for it, but I am also smart enough to realize that thinking such as yours is far more damaging to the sport we all love than leagally caught and kept fish. Fight for the right of sportsman not against them, or see your rights diminish 1 at a time until you have none. Then we can all enjoy a nice salad and some tofu together.Tracy"
521239,bigfish1965,2002-06-10 22:13:00,3210,"Actually slot limits are often influenced by local regulatory groups. The French River area comes to mind. I have a 31 inch walleye on my wall. Why? Because it had sustained a serious gill injury from the lure and it was obviously too old to recover from such serious damage. I wasn't sure If I was going to catch a whole lot more 30 inchers in my lifetime and the situation was perfect for a mounting. I would never eat a 30 inch walleye for the simple reason that the small ones are tastier and contain far less toxins. I am happy to say that I have caught and released 13 more 30 inch walleye since then and I will always do so in the future. My point of all this is, we don't know that the walleye in question was suffering a similar fate. After all it would be illegal for you to throw back a legal walleye that you knew was going to perish."
521241,Guest,2002-06-11 07:46:00,0,"I'm very interested in your reponse. If you advertise your policy then no guest should have a problem with it. Do you also tell your guests that when they have their four fish limits in the freezer that the should stop fishing for walleye? Do you tell them that if they eat 2, 3 or all 4 for lunch then thats' their daily bag limit so head for the golf course? How do you apply your higher law for these situations? TGG"
521240,Mahumba,2002-06-11 07:58:00,345,Great response bigfish!I like the way you think. The only time I keep a walleye over 18 inches is when it can't swim away. I cringe also when I see large walleye taken to be eaten but that is my point of view and I don't force it on others. I do what I think is right. If someone wants to keep a 15 pound walleye to eat that is their right. (actually happened)I do what I do because I think it's right. The next guy may not think it is though.Roger Mayer.
