521116,Guest,2002-06-16 19:55:00,0,I just got back from Minaki and I did jump in the lake IT'S COLD!!!
521106,Guest,2002-06-05 10:50:00,0,Just curious........how about the main lake (Big Sand)? Thanks
521107,Guest,2002-06-05 12:30:00,0,We just came back from Umfreville Lake which is just NW of there and the main lake temps were in the low 40s when we arrived 5/24 and the high 40s when we left 6/1. The bays on the west of the lake were in the mid 40s and those on the east which benefited from the W and NW winds were in the mid to high 50s. Some backwaters were in the high 60s and one hit 69 degrees F. Hope that helps.Paul
521108,Guest,2002-06-05 12:42:00,0,Thanks Paul...that is helpfull.

521110,Guest,2002-06-12 05:59:00,0,"Rob, I'm coming up next Thursday (20th) for a week. You going to be around? Didn't get to meet you last year....maybe this year. I will be jumping in the lake the first morning I'm there, it's a ritual."

521111,Guest,2002-06-13 23:43:00,0,"Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh......you sure you wanna do that ? Curious..you have good life insurance & named me as the benifactor ?Seriously.....as we all get along in age we sometimes cannot do the things we used to do. The mind is willing but the body refuses. (just ask Bob Dole) BEFORE jumping in, please splash some water onto your arms/chest/arm pit areas....this way you can prevent a ""shock"" to your system. A good area to also do is directly over your heart. It is also recommended to splash water onto your groin area.... but who really likes do do a turtle impersonation ? My point being is that this will prevent your body deciding to go into any type of cardic shock......or as my police friends say...""Doing the funky chicken""When I took swimming lessons/lifeguard training...... my instructors thought I was a total loss....... how wrong they were. I obviously paid attention long enough to remember this & how great she looked in a bikini...........Good FishenRobp.sI left you a post under ""July 4th"" minaki/laker fishing.I'll be out there this weekend for 3 days, back for four days then back out late sat 22 / early sunday 23rd. Shall we pick a time & place to meet ? I'd say.....Sunday 23 @ Paradise Cove restaurant/bar around 7ish ? Maybe later ? Your call......Good FishenRob"
521112,Guest,2002-06-14 07:04:00,0,"Rob......any chance I could just swing by your cabin one evening (after fishing....say right at dark) on the 23, 24? I'd hate to give you a definate time and place simply because I never know what project or plans my dad might have for me when I'm up there. I like fishing the big lake in the evening so I could just swing by on my way back to our cabin around dark. Let me know if this will work for you. When your on the lake just look for the early 90's 17'deep V bass tracker with the 60 hp Merc and the two Ricco Swavay looking dudes in their early 30's...LOL :)"
521113,Guest,2002-06-15 00:46:00,0,"Well one problem. I won't be at the cabin. I'll be staying in town @ Paradise Cove. I have friends from Nebraska coming up to fish. They always stay at P.C. I hang out with them. Also, our dock was destroyed last summer by the high water & hasn't been re-built so I really don't have a place to keep my boat when I'm at the cabin. Where we are, it's important to have a place to tie up the rig..... we can & do get hammered by the wind/waves. In fact, few years ago..... my boat was brand spankin new...been on the water for 2 days. Pulled it up on shore for the night. That night...big storm. Was awaken @ 5am...... dock busted, 21ft Sylvan trying to jump onto dock, friends boat on other side of dock being beat bad. My boat..... swamped, lower unit smashing onto stationary part of dock. trolling motor destroyed. Lost a brand new flasher / wrecked ""girlfriends"" camera, lots of tackle also wrecked. In the process of trying to save boats....... 1 friend suffered 2 broken fingers/bruised ribs. I suffered 1 cracked rib + bruised ribs & shoulder dis-location. Boat was beat a bit....marks still presently on boat. BUT worse part...... girlfriend was really pissed..... $323.00 later her dumb camera was fixed..... she was more upset by the camera thing than the rest of the damage. Guess that is why she is a ""EX"" now..... SO, no dock, no me @ cabin. Now that I know what kinda rig yer running, I'll look for you. Also, leave some type of marker on your dock. Like a marker bouy or a flag or a painted plastic bottle ? Good FishenRob"
