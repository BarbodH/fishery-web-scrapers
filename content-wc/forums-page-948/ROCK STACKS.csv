521410,fishmaster,2002-06-17 17:55:00,209,"Another CanadianThanks for the link it was interesting, and i agree with the comments about the persons who spray paint the rocks to mark there spot.they don't need to do that!!!!!!!1"
521399,fishmaster,2002-06-14 14:04:00,209,OK there have been many answers to this question so here we go.Does anyone know what the answer is to the rocks that get stack along the highways?Have noticed this for many years and when you ask someone they all give you a different answer.So let's here some answers on this topic and see what we come up with.Thanks fishmaster
521400,Guest,2002-06-14 23:09:00,0,"I think they are native amreican religious symbols or something along those lines,but I am not sure."
521401,Guest,2002-06-15 00:19:00,0,"Well..... I think I know the answer. I apologize beforehand for my incorrect spelling of the word. There is a Inuit Legend (eskimo legend) that a hunter was out hunting one day. He was all alone when he noticed a very large/hungry polar bear approaching towards him. He collected rocks and built a large figure with these rocks....the idea being that he built a figure to represent a rather large man....thus scaring off the bear. It is called a Inukshuk....... it is the now the symbol of Northern Canada & it represents the ""North"". I work for a television network that provides servce to the north. We have this symbol on most of our network id's etc. It has become a very popular symbol on t shirts / pieces of art work etc. I actually have one sitting here in my rec-room........ which of course I founding sitting on the side of the road ! AS to why people put them up on the side of the road ? I have no idea...... other than maybe they were bored ? OR while waiting to hitch a ride they were bored ? ? Good FishenRob"
521402,Big Tim,2002-06-15 03:40:00,63,"Rob, I heard much the same story, with one more piece of info. They, supposedly, are a form of trail markers thet mean that it is a safe passage."
521403,Red Ruffandsore,2002-06-15 04:13:00,81,"They are Inuksuks (sp?) and are used to guide/mark trails and safe passages. My son learned it in school and had to build one for homework. If I see anoter one fallen on the road, I'm going to scream (like a girl)"
521404,fishmaster,2002-06-15 19:13:00,209,Thanks for the info I have heard of the one about it marking a trail or path for someone but find this hard to read myself it would be interesting to hear some more on this and if anyone has a link to stories about these stacking of rocks feel free to enclose it on your reply to this subject.I have over the last few years heard many other stories hard to believe ones at that but this marking of the trail is one that must be understood by other such as the native americans i guess.I think many of us are interested to learn more on this so if you have info let's hear about it.Thanks
521405,SWeed,2002-06-15 21:19:00,66,"I thought they were sand castles with bigger pieces of sand..... I always just assumed they were made by travelers that stopped along the way for a break. We built one several years ago between Ft Frances and Dryden, always thought i would remember where it was and see if it was there from year to year, however not sure where it was....."
521406,fishmaster,2002-06-16 07:50:00,209,That is one of the stories I heard is that travelers are the ones stopping to copy the ideas and see if it is there from one year to the next.I have not done this but sometimes thought to stop and make a pile just to see if it is there the next year.But you know how that goes when you are in a hurry to get to the camp and get fishing who has time to build rock piles.
521407,Pooch,2002-06-16 19:42:00,4619,Many of the rock piles are interesting. But onions to the idiots who think they have to deface the roadsides with a can of spray paint.Pooch
