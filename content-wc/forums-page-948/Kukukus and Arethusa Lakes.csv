521443,Guest,2002-06-15 12:41:00,0,Have a trip booked for next week and have never fished either of these lakes. Anyone ever fished them? Is it still all minnows or is it worthwhile to invest in some leeches/crawlers for mid June in the Ignace area?
521444,the badger,2002-06-15 22:03:00,0,"I fished both of these lakes but it was over ten years ago.Kukukus was at that time very good for eyes and pike.Arethusa is a smaller lake with lake trout.I was only on this lake one time in late Aug.,did ok on eyes and a few small lakers,don't remember to much more about it."
521445,the badger,2002-06-16 09:34:00,0,I would definitely takeagood supply of crawlers and leeches with me on this trip. Minnows ok but not essential.
