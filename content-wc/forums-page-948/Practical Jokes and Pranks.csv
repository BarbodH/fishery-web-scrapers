521074,Guest,2002-06-12 17:41:00,0,you could always bring a fake snake or rat. I brought my 2 way radio put one under my pals bed and then made bear growls every 15 minutes he didnt get much sleep that night.
521075,Guest,2002-06-14 11:00:00,0,"Okay, here's a topic I can actually add some insight to:1. Every boat has a pee can and punching a couple of small holes in the bottom of it can really get a guy when he's got his handsfull.2. You might want to really know the guy well before you pull this one. As you're packing up, stick a couple of empty condom packs in his duffel bag hoping that his wife unpacks it."
521065,Guest,2002-06-07 07:45:00,0,"Say, to all you funny guys, some of the pranks mentioned in this article are as about as funny as cancer. If some of you a$$holes pull these types of ""jokes"" on your so called friends, you must be looking for new partners every fishing trip. With friends like you, who needs enemies? When I go fishing with a group, I go to get away, relax, and catch some fish. Not feind off practical jokers that get their laughs at others expense, which gets pretty old in a hurry. I guess some people just never grow up. I would imagine that all you practical jokers are the loud, boisterous types that ruin it for everyone else that happens to be within one mile of your area. Then people wonder why some Americans give a bad name to all others. As usual, it only takes a few to ruin it for the many. To each their own, I guess."
521066,DarrenB,2002-06-07 09:44:00,28,"Don't be such a stiff and a killjoy, Funny Guy. Nothing wrong with a couple a minor, harmless pranks on your pals for a little fun and enjoyment. Though I agree some of the ones already mentioned are a little extreme. The minnow in the pop can is a classic."
521067,Guest,2002-06-07 10:21:00,0,"Funny Guy, your a WUSSSSSSSS!"
521070,Guest,2002-06-07 11:23:00,0,"Here's a harmless one...Borrow as many travel alarm clock as you can then hide them throughout the intended target's bedroom. Set them to go off every 10 or 15 minutes, just enough time to fall back asleep.IPS"
521068,Guest,2002-06-07 11:43:00,0,And you HAHA are a joke and very imaaaaaature!!!
521069,Guest,2002-06-07 16:55:00,0,I agree 100%. I have been at the blunt end of some jokers stuff in college. I had a reputation for being agressive and quick with the fists in hockey games but joker kept up with the kids stuff. I laid him out and he could not understand why. Some people do not like the jokers stuff...I'm one of them.
521071,Big Tim,2002-06-08 05:08:00,63,"I understand your need to find some way to shake up the group. Unfortunatly some people are less than pleased to be on the recieving end of some of these jokes. I know that if someone saran wraped the toilet on me HE would be the one cleaning the mess, not me. Then I would take photos of him & make sure his wife & co-workers got copys. If you insist on playing practical jokes on others, be ready for any comebacks, paybacks & the possibility of being un- invited next year. most of my fishing trips come with enough gaffs & goofups to tease each other with, we find no need to manufacture our laughs."
521060,Bobby,2002-06-09 09:54:00,211,"When pulling this prank, you have to ensure that the toilet paper doesn't look like it has gotten wet and then been dried, as it will look like your textbook you dropped in the snow when you were a kid walking home from school (pages get wrinkled and hard). So, leave a wrap or two unsoaked and let it dry out after soaking it with bug juice (or bear spray). After drying, roll the clean part over the roll. No, I definitely wouldn't pull this one on guys I was fishing with, I'd like to get invited back next year. Also, realize that you are alone in the wilderness with these guys for days on end and they WILL get you back 10 times worse. Or, your trip could be ruined. Save this one for your brother or someone you owe in the worst way."
521072,Guest,2002-06-10 20:33:00,0,Well some very interesting reading . Since I am the guy who started all this. I want to say One thing . Lighten up guys lifes to short to take so seriously. thanks one and all .....GONE FISHIN!!!!
521073,Reels,2002-06-11 06:53:00,2876,"My favorite is to start talk about how bad the tic's are this year, and how you have to check to make sure the tic's havent latched on and start sucking your blood. Then before your victom goes to bed, sprikle some coffee grounds between the sheets. He will either wake up in the middle of the night, or freak in the morning when he feels the small grounds stuck to his body.<{{}}><"
521054,Guest,2002-06-04 13:57:00,0,"Looking for some ideas . Going fishin in June with 6 guys and want to have some fun. Will be at a cabin on a boat-in. Only got 1 prank so far to respool one of the guys reels, 20 yards at a time. Hoping to find more, Thanks"
521055,Guest,2002-06-04 14:35:00,0,As kids we used do do these from time to time. They escalated till one buddy took exception while they had been drinking for awhile and beat the other guy into a hospital stay. Many a trip has been ruined with out of control jokesters who pulled a prank that they thought was funny but stressed the other guy. IMHO
521056,Guest,2002-06-04 14:43:00,0,If your the bartender for the night always bring up a bottle of prune juice! Mix them a few rum/prune and cokes and watch the out-house get a workout!! If they are buzzed up enuff they will say dang that walleye goes right threw me lmao!! If your the one making scrambled eggs in the morning you can always bring up some of the hottest peppers you can find add a little tabasco and watch the blood pressure go up! Thats just a few but i could go on and on just make sure your one of the bigger guys or your buddies have a sense of humor lol!!!!
521057,Guest,2002-06-04 14:50:00,0,Swing buy the cabin between lunch and dinner and hide everyones booze! Do this early of course the first day or so and you will see people spitting venom lmao!! I could only let this go on for and hour or so i preteded to help look for it just rolling on the ground! It was alot of work moving 18 cases of beer but well worth it!!
521058,Guest,2002-06-04 15:02:00,0,Here is one but it is a little ridiculus ...If your out-house is out of site from the cabin and it is half way dark outside you can bring up some fake blood and make-up for some bruises. Then you scream bloody murder and say you were attacted by a bear.. but you got the best of him <<lol. or tell them the truth and say the west nile canadian mosquitos got the best of you becauce you were constapated!Great topic!!!!
521059,Guest,2002-06-05 10:01:00,0,How about soaking the toilet paper in bugspray!
521061,Guest,2002-06-05 10:29:00,0,Look and see if your cabin has one of those mats in the inside doorway with the hard sticky points on the opposite side. When you go to bed for the night turn the mat upside down so the first guy to get up and head for the door to take a piss steps on the mat. This works pretty good.
521062,River Rat,2002-06-06 19:18:00,43,"Pulling pranks is asking not to be invited on another trip. Regarding the idea of soaking TP in bug spray-the groin and anal area is extremely sensetive to chemical absorbtion, and bug dope is poison."
521063,Mahumba,2002-06-06 19:55:00,345,"Here are a few,We used to do this as kids at neighboring camps.Wait until dark. We would lift the outhouse and move it behind the hole. Makes for a great mess!Disconnect hose from carb. Just pull it off a bit so it still looks like it's connected. Whatch the guy pull the cord all day.Put a gob of peanut butter inside someone's shoe or boot. Stuff it up near the toes.Roger Mayer."
521064,Guest,2002-06-07 06:14:00,0,Plastic wrap (saran wrap) over the toilet bowl always gets people. Guys always fall for this one early in the morning. Makes a heck of a mess though.pooch
