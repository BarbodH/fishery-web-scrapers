521128,Guest,2002-06-05 13:57:00,0,Has anyone had much success on Rice Lake lately? I'm wondering if the River mouth is stil the best area at this time. Will be heading there the week of June 15th. Thanks for any info in advance.

Try the edges in the centre part of the lake out from the south side.Troll the perimeter of the islands out from Gores landing toward evening.Black bucktails are a good bet on Rice to avoid the numerous perch.B.J. tackle in Bewdley has some real good custom ones called Weed Ripper Pro.Don't overlook some shallower areas as well. Open pockets in areas where weeds are not overly dense can be pitched ""bass style"" with good results at times. Good luck."
