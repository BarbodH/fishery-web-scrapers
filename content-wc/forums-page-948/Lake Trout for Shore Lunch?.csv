520792,bbakes,2002-05-28 07:16:00,121,"YES!Fillet the trout, leave the skin on, roll it in fish fry, fry it up, eat everything but the skin. Lake trout cooks better and tastes excelent if you cut it in 4-5 inch pieces."
520793,doc,2002-05-30 05:58:00,143,We ate lake trout for shore lunch every day for a week last year in Canada. Just fillet and cook them like any other fish. They are excellent. I don't think I would leave the skin on.
520794,Fuzz,2002-05-30 06:46:00,85,"Ditto,Our guide took us Lake Trout fishing one day last August on LOTW and he filleted them and floured them just like walleye with skins off, and fried them. They were excellent, a little richer than walleye, but very delicious. Took a few home and smoked them, they were good, but I think I liked them better fried.............of course the fish always is better fresh, on an island shore lunch, on a beautiful day. Hope we do it again this year! Enjoy them.Fuzz"

In some lakes, the flesh is very pink, and tastes almost like salmon, In other lakes, the flesh can be white, and these lakers tend to taste a bit bland. What we love to do on our fly in trips is to bake a laker on the BBQ. We gut the fish, but leave the head and skin intact. We fill the cavity with lemon slices and a little italian dressing, salt and pepper, and a shot or 2 of Tabasco. Wrap the fish in 2 layers of tin foil, and bake on the BBQ on medium heat for 20 minutes per inch of thickness per side. Lakers up to about 4 pounds are perfect for this recipe. You could also do this on a grill over a fire, but it does take a little longer than your traditional shore lunch technique."

Cast iron skillet fried them with ""Shore Lunch"" batter. Very tasty. We try to remove the thin line of dark meat/junk that is left right under the skin too. I have also steam pouched them several times and they are great that way too. Lay a fillet on tin foil, butter it, lay thin lemon slices on it, season it with greek seasoning or your favorite seasonal. Lay it on the grill for about 10-15 minutes. This method is a bit more healthy than the fry method too. Cold, clear deep lakes put out very tasty trout.:9 Good luck 7 out"

Just coat the fish in the egg mixture then into the powdered rice krispies and fry. Use an oil in the pan.This works on any kind of fish. Try it it's great!Roger Mayer."
