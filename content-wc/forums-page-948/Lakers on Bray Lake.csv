521415,guide7,2002-06-14 15:22:00,70,Can anybody tell me if they have ever caught a lake trout on Bray Lake or any other central Lac Seul chain lake. We will be at Mahkwa Lodge late June and have tried Bray a time or two for lakers. Would really like to know if they are in their or any other connecting lake.7 out
521416,Dave,2002-06-17 07:23:00,258,"Guide 7,I will be at Mahkwa the same time and would like to try a little Laker fishin myself. You would think that if they are in Bray that they would possibly be in the main lake also. Looking at the Map, there is some deep water close to Mahkwa that might be worth cheking. You ever try the main lake? Will be at Mahkwa on June 29th, see ya there!Dave"
521417,guide7,2002-06-17 18:47:00,70,"DaveThe locals at Mahkwa say there are no lakers in the main lake. It's been hard to get any laker info out of them. I tend to believe this about the main lake since it is a reservoir. The lake warms up pretty good in the summer and the lakers don't take kindly to that. Bray is isolated enough and flows into Lac Seul which keeps me hoping that what I have heard about the possibility of lakers in there is true. Last year we marked a lot of fish in the 60-80 foot central part of Bray, but it waaaaaaaaaay too windy the day we tried it. We did pull one whitefish and one northern out of 70 feet of water though. That was a bummer! We're there June 26-30 11 strong.Check out the Fez cabin. 7 out"
