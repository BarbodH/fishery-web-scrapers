While I was there, I asked to see the map for the Gouin Reservoir in Quebec. The attendant provided me two color coordinated plastic encased bathymetric maps for the Gouin Reservoir (each map covered two areas of the reservoir). The maps were quite detailed showing water depths of the reservoir, locations of some outfitters, access points, etc. No doubt a worthwhile investment for anyone fishing the Gouin.However, I observed that much of the Gouin Reservoir doesn't provide deep water (over 40 feet) to afford protection on those brillantly bright days. My question for you fishermen who frequent the Gouin Reservoir is which outfitter is best placed for the overall best walleye fishing opportunities regardless the weather? Please include opportunities to find reasonably quiet water in inclement weather (storms) in your selection. Jay"

521280,Guest,2002-06-11 07:16:00,0,"Hi JayHaving spent a few years on the Gouin there are some stories to be told and I'm curious about the shop where you found the map.You may want to email me [email protected] To answer your question about location I would suggest you look at the outfitters on the South Bay, the Walleye Club in particular. this location is now road accessible from Parent and is due north of Clova about 25 miles by air. Just remember that this reservoir does have some significantly deep water where the original lake beds were flooded. I have to make one observation also - fishing with Tony Puccio from the Baitrigs Co. a few years ago under typical high pressure conditions I got a real eye opening demo of anti textbook walleye in shallow water. We had been trolling and bouncing rigs in 25' depths for a couple of hours when Tony asked me if there was a shallow reef close by - in fact there was and we proceeded to get right up on top of it. Tony starts pitching a 1/16th oz jig and twister tail and if I remember correctly on the second pitch pulled a 5 lber out of two feet of water. That was his lesson to me relative to the converstion we had been having on location and weather dictates, when the big fish are hungry they will be where the the little fish are setting the table.I guess that's why he is such a popular fisherman on the PWT circuit. I'll never forget the lesson and will always share the information.Bill McCue"
