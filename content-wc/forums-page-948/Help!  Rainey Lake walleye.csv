520902,Guest,2002-05-30 10:47:00,0,"Fished Red Gut on Saturday. Fish were in 30 feet and slow. 2 of us caught about 25 for a 10 hour day. Used minnows and jigs. Tried leeches and cranks with no success. We had to sit on them and jig. Sunday we went to Seine River. Nothing in Grassy. I think the water is still to cold 48F for action in the shallows. It was also sunny. The mouth of the river produced 15 W's over two hours in the 15 inch range, again on minnows and jigs. Went over to Canoe Narrows in the afternoon and found the honey hole. Caught lot's of W's in the 15 to 20 inch range off a rocky point ajacent to two large weedy bays. Fish were anywhere between 30 and 10 feet. Again everything on minnows and jigs. We also boated 3 Northerns in the 20lb range and had many bite offs. With the warmer weather this weekend should be really good. Fish should be parked in the shallower bays and responsive to cranks. But, don't overlook the deeper spots."
520903,Guest,2002-05-30 12:38:00,0,Thank you very much for the reply. I have two sons and my father to take up for the first time this weekend and can use all the help I can get.
520904,Guest,2002-06-03 21:32:00,0,"Hey Animal:You must have been reading my fishing log book!! Dead on. Leech don't produce and the fish are generally deep. Tolling doesn't work, jigging does. Use medium minnow. One small thing I might add. Stay out of the wind, it isn't a factor right now it just makes boat control more difficult and messes up your finesse presentations.Jackfish"
520905,Guest,2002-06-17 19:37:00,0,"Fishing log book!!!!Laugh Out Loud!!!!you must rely on your book..to bad you don't experiment there jackfish....your missing out out on alot of fun fishing, I'm having great success on leeches and crawlers, just maybe your not fishing warm enough water or something, but you seem to believe in everything you read,(mostly guys writing about what they read) Alls I have to suggest is that if your any kind of walleye fisherman almost any kind of structure fishing on Rainy will work!!!!!!!and bait....even plastics...and hard baits.....just have to know where and how, your guide should know a few different presentations in any given day if he's any good and have the tools to fish with those presentations....right?"
