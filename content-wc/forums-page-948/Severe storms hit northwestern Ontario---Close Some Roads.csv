521346,Guest,2002-06-17 19:40:00,0,"Just got back from white dog, the road is open but many spots are one lane. The lake has come up 5 feet in the last 7 days but fishing was good.Take your time on the road and be ready to stop at any time and you should be fine."
521335,Guest,2002-06-12 10:43:00,0,"On Sunday and Monday, a reported 18"" of rain hit the area, knocking some bridges and closing roads. Now please realize that information is sketchy, but everyone is trying to provide the best they can without scarring the daylights out of people. Supposedly, some roads out of the Fort are closed and impassable. There is information on the home page of http://www.justfishontario.com along with a phone number to call to get the latest reports on conditions. It might be a good idea to call your lodge if you are going up this week."
521336,Guest,2002-06-12 10:49:00,0,"The phone number for road conditions is 807-473-2100. I just got off the phone with a lodge owner just north of Nestor Falls and he says the situation is serious. Certainly don't want to alarm anyone unneedlessly, but you need to keep abreast of the situation if you are going in the next couple of days. Information varies and changes, so take it for what it is worth. Anyone coming back in the last day or so could give some good information. I would call lodge if going near Lake of the Woods or up 502 Road. Just to be on the safe side."
521337,Guest,2002-06-12 11:10:00,0,"I just got through on the line concerning road conditions, there are a lot of roads closed, bridges washed out, unbeleivable. Most definitely call if going this week. 807-473-2100. Phil"
521338,Guest,2002-06-12 12:20:00,0,"Radio station CJRL at 807-468-3181 News Dept. seems to also get reports as far as conditions. Hwy 71 going up through Nestor Falls, Sioux Narrows is supposedly to be open tonite or in the morning. Hwy 502 has no word on opening. I have heard that people are coming in from Manitoba and getting to Kenora, but take it with a grain of salt. Lots of mixed reports out there."

521340,Guest,2002-06-13 13:37:00,0,"As of 1:55 PM Thursday, Hwy 11 from Fort Francis to EMO is open 1-lane only and Hwy 71 from EMO to Kenora is open 2-lanes with a short detour at Nestor Falls 1-807,473-2100 Option #1...........!"
521341,Guest,2002-06-14 16:28:00,0,"Hwy's 71 and 502 are both open. Hwy 502 is open to daytime travel only and local traffic between 6:00 PM and 9:00 PM. Things are returning to normal, and I hear the fish are biting good. With all that rain, just think of the bugs, frogs, and worms that washed into the water. Feeder creeks that are usually dry by now, could be hot where they enter the main lake. Good luck"
521342,Guest,2002-06-15 05:42:00,0,"Announced on the Kenora newspaper website on Friday: Highway 71 is open with one detour, but only to daylight hours driving."
521343,Guest,2002-06-16 06:00:00,0,"Just got back from Vermilion Bay Area - We took 17, 71 and 11 to Fort Francis. The road crews were out working. So there were some minor waits with one lane of traffic. There is still a very short detour in Nestor Falls because of water on road. Between Emo and Nestor Falls there was a culvert which apparently got washed out, but it is replaced and has a gravel road surface. A few extra pot holes on the side of the road. Otherwise the road was in pretty good shape.A big thank you to the road crews.We were without power for a day, but I heard on the radio some people were without power from Monday to Friday. Thanks to the Hydro crews also.Fishing was slow Monday and Tuesday, but was really great at the end of the week. I didn't want to come home, but who does? :)"
