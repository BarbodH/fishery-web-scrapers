521397,Guest,2002-06-14 08:21:00,0,Just came in from Lac Seul last night. Hwy 502 is closed and might not open for a week is the word we got. Depends on more rain or not.Hwy through Sioux Narrows/Nestor Falls reopened yesterday afternoon and you could get through Baudette but not Fort Francis. We live in Mpls and went through Thunder Bay coming home. Trip was 585 miles approximately 135 miles longer but roads were very good and traffic traveled between 65-70 mph so it wasn't all that bad.Good Luck.
