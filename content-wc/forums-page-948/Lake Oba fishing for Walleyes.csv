I was hoping one of you experienced anglers out there might be able, and willing to post me some answers, like lure choice, and technique. And maybe even location if you know the lake. A guy on our party tried leaches, and didn't catch any more than us on trolling lures. This year I thought I'd try worm harnesses. Thanks to all, and THANKS, EH"
