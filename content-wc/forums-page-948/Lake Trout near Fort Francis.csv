521350,fishinnut,2002-06-12 14:46:00,642,Any good Lake Trout lakes near Fort Francis? Will be staying on Rainy and would like to trailer boat somewhere nearby for Lakers.
521351,BD,2002-06-12 20:15:00,739,"Take 622 north to Finlayson. Finlayson Resort (Camp 113) is on the east side of the hwy. There are some nice (not fancy) cabins and campsites there. Finlayson and Dashua both have good laker, and northern fishing with a piggy for a once in a while bonus. There are other lakes and the Seine River in the area that have excellant walleye fishing. Roger and Doris are great and will give you what help they can. One of my fishing buddies has been going there at least twice a year for over 20 years. In fact he's there now while I'm back here working (the dirty rat ;) )."
521352,Guest,2002-06-12 20:52:00,0,"take a short trip north of Emo about 20 miles to the Clearwater / Pipestone chain. Head north on hwy 71 to the 615 (about 10 miles) cut-off east about 5 miles then north about 7 miles to Sportsman's Landing. many 5-12 pound trout available in either lake. We fished Pipestone this spring at ice-out and caught some nice trout. Stayed at Pipestone Lodge, about 18 miles by water from Sportsman's.Good Luck. 7 out"
521353,Guest,2002-06-12 22:04:00,0,Better call ahead before travelling up here. Lots of highways are washed out. Floods and broken dams. Plent of folks are stranded on both sides of the washouts. No way in or out of the Fort right now.
521354,Guest,2002-06-14 12:19:00,0,"Some great lake trout lakes around fort include Bat and Lower Manitou up the Cedar Narrows Bush Road (off the Dryden Highway). I surveyed these lakes and many others in the area as a fisheries tech with the MNR last summer. Drop me a line for more info at [email protected] .Tight Lines,Davis ViehbeckThunder Bay,ON"

521356,troutaholic,2002-06-17 06:03:00,827,Are there Lakers in Rainy? I thought I remember someone saying that there were?
