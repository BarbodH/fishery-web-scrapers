Non-stop lightning and rain for 48 hours. This was followed up by marble sized hail storm on Wednesday, then tornados that we spotted less than a mile away on Big Island. We were 8 miles away from the camp one day and we saw the lake go from dead calm and sunshine to torrential rain and wind in a 10 minute span. It really reinforced the fact that we must respect these large bodies of water. The lake rose 2' during our 5 day stay. But.............we caught some fish!! Not large numbers, but good sized fish. The fishing was much better than it should have been considering the weather. Plus everyone was safe, and they had the roads opened from Morson to Rainy River when we left Friday. Truly a year we'll remember.Good fishing everyone.Fuzz"
