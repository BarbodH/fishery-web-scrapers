6207302,Woollybob,2018-06-11 10:58:00,158,"Fished that area for years. You will not need a guide. Get a pile of 1/4 oz and 3/8 oz jigs, put on a minnow, find fish w/ your electronics - look for bottom breaks, mark fish - catch those fish. Depth can be anywhere from 7'-32' - use your graph. If you are catching sauger, you are too deep. Color does not seem to matter. Don't bother getting up early or staying out late - the fish bite all day (and shut down at night). I catch about as many pike walleye fishing as I do pike fishing. Especially in the evening - Get a lot of T-bones around there. Fun fight on 6-8 lb test. Other than that, find some weed edges and cast spoons (make sure you have a wire or floro leader). Spinnerbaits work well also. You will need to travel a ways to find musky - either Northeast part of the lake or Southeast. A guide would be good for that species. I will say you should temper any expectations you might have for the quality of lodging or service at Mahkwa. Great location though, just remember that is what you are paying for."
6207390,Ricky Spanish,2018-06-11 13:56:00,1298,"Count me in as an American Jigger. Trolling is BORING to me. To the OP, I bring everything but the kitchen sink to Canada but 75% of the time I am using 1/8oz jigs. I have been to Lac Seul once for the day when we were staying at a lodge on Eagle Lake. We boated 200 eyes in about 6hrs between three of us. It was a special day."
6209484,timvigen,2018-06-16 21:09:00,42,"Don't forget to bring a few jigging raps, just pay attention when dropping them down so you don't stick them in the rocks, you can probably see them on your sonar"
6209610,Guest,2018-06-17 09:02:00,0,"No Muskie in that area but plenty of walleye, pike & smallies. No jigs for me, troll 4-8 feet of water with a Klass Walleye Catcher (silver or brass with Steele line). Tip with a 5 Kalins plastic twister and troll at 1.7 mph. 100 walleye per boat per day plus accidentally catch 30 pike, one of which is likely 20#."
6209686,spikeidji,2018-06-17 11:37:00,10,"Look for the Green Warrior Boat. Our gang of 9 will be there battling for the ""PIG ON"" Trophy. We are on the housekeeping side. stop by and say hello. We will be there from Sat 30th to July 6. Get ready to have fun! We usually search with crankbaits and then Jig. This year we tied a bunch of crawler and leech spinners, for bottom bouncing. (we have been fishing Devils a lot lately) Amything we can do to help just ask. Spike"
6210120,CamoHunter,2018-06-18 13:32:00,363,"When will you be up there LundPuller? I'll be there July 8-13. I've been going there since around 1999 or 2000. Here's what we've learned. The fish are not in the same place every year, but general patterns hold true when we're there mid July every year. You'll find a lot of fish on wind swept points, or on mid-lake structure/drop-offs. We quit buying minnows or leeches 10 years ago, there's no need. We bring several flats of crawlers in bedding each year, and most years our group of 6-8 guys will go through 2-3 flats of crawlers. When we run out or the bite is good, we'll switch to gulp plastics and catch just as many. We mostly pull spinners/lindy rigs. It seems like we get bigger fish trolling than we do jigging, but that's not the rule by any means. Lots of guys do a lot of jigging there too, and do great. I don't think there is a wrong way no matter what you do. Walleye age classes seem to hang out together there. So if you find yourself in a pile of 16-17 inchers, you probably won't get many over 20"" in that spot and you need to move on, or deeper if you want bigger fish. If you're going for quantity, 16-19inchers is where you'll find the high catch numbers. If you're looking for bigger fish, move spots until you start getting them over 20"". I'd echo the previous remark that you don't need to hire a guide. Even if it's your first time there, use your electronics to find some drop-offs or points, fish wind swept points, and you'll find fish. I'd also echo the previous remark about the quality of the cabins. Don't expect much. Their cabins are NOT high quality. But if you're like most guests there, you're on the water fishing most of the day, not spending time in the cabins other than to eat & sleep. Don't count on finding any musky, unless you're willing to hire a guide and take a 20-30 mile boat trip. You won't find them in that part of the lake. For Pike, find any weed patches and cast them. About any pike style bait will work. Spoons, crankbaits, spinners, etc. Weeds will be in 10ft or less water."
6210150,SterlingArcher,2018-06-18 14:26:00,92,"Tons of great suggestions in this thread. If you want to keep it simple, just bring lots of glow white 1/4 oz jigs and you will catch fish til your arms fall off. I tend to bring lots of options with me because I'm a bass angler and throwing different baits is in my nature But there's not much that will outproduce a glow white jig and a minnow up there."
6210286,LundPuller,2018-06-18 19:34:00,15,"Will be up at Mahkwa July 2nd -> July 6th, and on to eagle for a few days to try and get a musky. Appreciate the advice, might try and pickup some crawlers before I leave. Won't be in the cabin much hopefully, so that shouldn't be an issue at all."
6210666,RACER|X|,2018-06-19 12:38:00,41,"My 7-trips to Lac Suel we have always jigged with minnow for walleye. Later the season, deeper the hunt and heavier the jig has worked for me. A Johnson spoon with white Mr. Twister tail or spinner will keep you on Northern all day. Actually grew tired of catxhing Northern up there. Smallies have loved a pumpkin green tube jig. I have had more fun with big smallies there than anywhere. I have fished with a tube jig for days straight and caught Notthern, Walleye, Smallies and white fish on same rig and pole. Lots of success with white rigs up there....May, June and/or July trips. That ¡s my experience there. Enjoy...love Lac Suel fishing. X"
6206656,LundPuller,2018-06-09 13:59:00,15,"Going to be fishing on Lac Seul first week of July, out of Mahkwa Lodge. This is my first time fishing up north, never caught a Walleye/Pike/Musky in my life. I have rods/reels that should be able to handle anything from finesse rigs, to casting 10 oz lures. Walleye: I plan on buying a bunch of bright colored jig heads 1/8 oz -> 1/2 oz, with some plastic curly tail grubs, and maybe some small swimbaits for drop shotting. Pike: I have some bass gear such as jerk baits and spinner baits I was going to try. Musky: Was looking at DOMINATRIX #10 double bladed bucktails, not sure what the difference is between those, and the higher dollar bucktails. Not really focusing on Musky, so I would just be getting the barebones, few bucktails I suppose. What would be some essential lures I should pickup before heading up north? Any colors I should focus on? Appreciate any input you guys can give."
6206704,martinbns,2018-06-09 16:13:00,1520,"It's the 9th of June now so I assume you mean July. Otherwise Muskie isn't open yet. Jigs you won't use anything as heavy as 1/2 oz unless you are fishing in heavy current, the heaviest I have in my two jib boxes are 3/8 except a couple rigged up with huge tube baits for Lakers. Most if not all of my walleye fishing is done with 3/16 oz jigs I buy at Scheels, they work great are cheap and unless you are fishing in 30' of water or it's really windy they work perfectly. Otherwise 1/4. Pike will be deeper by the time you get there, I only tend to fish for them in spring but catch a fiar number of them on a jig and a minnow while walleye fishing."
6206710,LundPuller,2018-06-09 16:33:00,15,"Yup, meant July. I wont bother getting 1/2 oz, thanks for the tip. How deep do you think the pike/walleye will be in first week of July?"
6206734,martinbns,2018-06-09 17:22:00,1520,"I suspect off points 20'+ but who knows. Last summer on LOTW which would be similar we caught them everywhere from 35'+ to 2-3"". I think mostly cruise around. After the spring is over, we pretty much seem to catch them by accident but I am not an expert by any means."
6206780,Bob/MN,2018-06-09 20:43:00,178,For walleyes all we use is spinners and crawlers.
6206804,David Anderson,2018-06-09 22:11:00,2073,"Well, fished opener last month and we had the best in years. Heading up next Saturday again. We mostly fish for walleyes, that time of year they should be off the points in 15 - 20 feet of water. We use 3 basic baits, 1/8 oz jig, 1/4 oz jig and rarely a 3/8 oz jig. If you talk to my partners any color is good as long as it's gold. I have found that most gold jigs were plated and the hook needs touching up first. I prefer H20 (http://customjigs.com/categories/bfi...sion-jigs.html) jigs in chartreuse, orange, or white. I like the wire keeper as they really hold plastic well. Also they have a relatively long shaft for running the hook through the minnows gills and hook them through just behind the head. Minnows last longer and you can often catch up to 4 walleye on one minnow. Gulp works really well if the fish are in a biting mode. The water is quite stained so bright colors work well, for all species. Good Luck."
6206956,PRO-V16,2018-06-10 12:02:00,454,For pike I would bring some large crank baits and large silver doctor spoons.
6206974,Bstar,2018-06-10 12:48:00,564,"If this is your first trip to Canada and you say you never caught a Walleye, Pike or Musky in your life then my suggestion would be to hire a guide for the first day or two. That being said, the suggestions so far are on the money. Spinner rigs on a bottom bouncer with a leech or crawler on wind blown rocky points and humps in about 15-20 feet of water is where I would start. Once you find them you can switch to a jig and leech or piece of crawler and sit on them until the action slows and then move on. For Pike I would start by trolling a large crank bait in those same areas. If you find a nice weed bed near some deeper water I would be casting a large Johnson Silver minnow with a 4-6 twister tail on it. A copper and orange Doctor spoon and buck tail spinners work well. Also try a # 5 or 6 Vibrax spinner. They are deadly at times. I agree with gold as being a good color on Lac Seul. Lac Seul is a great body of water to fish and it has some huge walleye in it. Like I said a guide the first couple of days will show you where and how to fish as well as show you the safe routes. Good luck on your trip and post a report when you get back. Bstar"
6207164,MikeinMN,2018-06-10 23:43:00,190,"I second Bstar on your hiring a guide for at least a day. Our group has fished the west end of Lac Seul for many years and I well remember some tough times learning to fish there. Having said that, Lac Seul is a great lake and Makwah is in a really good place on the Lac. We fish for walleye and catch a few pike every year without targeting them. We have caught some pike in the 40"" range but really never on a specific presentation or specific spot. My boat trolls 60% of the time and jigs 40%, the other boat exclusively jigs. No one in our group has a favorite jig color, and just like other replies, we fish lighter jigs mostly 1/8 ounce. Minnows or crawler pieces work well to tip the jigs and we struggle with plastics. Best crankbait colors seem to be bright, although chrome can be good too. If I didn't like to troll so much I would not troll Lac Seul, it fishes better with jigs in my opinion, but I have gotten into some really good crankbait bites. Depth is always unpredictable for us, we fish mostly late summer and have caught walleye from 4' to 30', depending on conditions. We don't fish deeper than 30' as I think too many fish die after release that deep. It's an awesome fishery but it does take a little figuring out. One of the members on this board is ProV1800 and he guides Lac Seul, and if I were new to the lake I would look him up, hire him for at least a day and go from there. Good luck!"
6207260,martinbns,2018-06-11 09:16:00,1520,"It's a funny thing, Canadian's who fish shield lakes for Walleye love to jig and American's seem to love to troll. I recently a bought a kicker as mostly an insurance policy for my big motor when I fish shallow water and for being 20 miles down LOTW from Kenora. When it was being installed by my Dealer who is the second largest Lund dealer in North America, the GM was telling me they don't even stock Kickers anymore as everyone jigs. The advent of spot lock killed off the kicker for 95% of Walleye guys in Canada especially those that fish the Canadian Shield."
