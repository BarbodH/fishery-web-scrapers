You can bring all the gear and equipment and know all the hot spots, but if the fish aren't biting than you're **** out of luck. I will definitely keep this in mind when out on the lake."
6210396,BornToFish,2018-06-19 05:23:00,1224,"Greetings,I had a few other thoughts come to mind about fishing in August. One of them is about selecting potential musky spots in mid-August. My best spots for musky in mid-August have some things in common. One is that these spots have more than one thing going for them. That is, there is more than one structural element present. For example, there is rocks AND weeds, or rocks AND wood, or weeds AND wood. If there are other factors such as complexity (e.g. inside turns, outside turns, saddles, etc.), nearby deep water and wind, these spots can be magical. These kind of spots can be pretty small - I can often cover these in 10-15 minutes, but they hold fish!As I mentioned in my earlier post, I normally don't spend a lot of my day casting for muskies. Rather, I have a mental checklist of such musky spots and head to them when I sense a window is about to open.A few guys mentioned having a musky grab a walleye that is being brought to the boat. I haven't had this happen too often, but having it happen with northern pike is a fairly common occurrence. I find that the biggest pike in the body of water are often on deep water rock humps in mid-August. I target these fish, as little northern pike know better than to be on these rock humps.I believe that many northern pike abandon the shore lines at about the time when the thermocline begins to develop. They just follow the thermocline out into the abyss and wander around until they run into some structure. They stay near this structure until the thermocline breaks down in September or October, and then head back to shoreline.Targeting these pike is fairly straightforward. Get upwind of the rock hump (the same rock humps that anglers are fishing for walleyes or smallies) by two to three casts. Cast any big profile bait towards the rock hump and count it down about ten feet. The retrieve can be steady or erratic - whatever suits you. Keep casting until you are downwind of the rock hump by two to three casts. The strike often comes in twenty feet of water, even though I might be in fifty or more feet of water. The pike is often passing time just above the thermocline, and sees a big profile bait silhouetted against the surface. The strike can be subtle - a tick on the line - or it can be a savage T-bone affair. The bite is often best in the middle of the day. I use my musky gear when targeting these pike. Have, know how and be comfortable using good hook-removal tools or you will be killing trophy fish. I can cast a rock hump and get nothing, and then come back two hours later and catch six pike. Ricky Spanish mentioned keeping a rod in the boat that is rigged with a big profile bait. This is great advice as there is likely a big pike in the vicinity if the walleye bite suddenly ends. My partner caught a mid-40s northern pike two years ago doing exactly this. The pike looked like it just ate a 16 inch smallie, yet took a walleye pattern bull dawg. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6209022,chkncuscus,2018-06-15 12:35:00,6,"Hello All - we will be staying on the west end of Eagle Lake Ontario for a week starting August 18 and want to target big walleye. We will be hiring a guide the first day so that should help, but I feel they will want to put us on numbers rather than the big girls. We have been up there once before and were able to get on a lot of walleye in the 14-18"" range, no complaints there. We used lindy rigs tipped with minnows. Are we able to find big walleye on the west end without having to travel too far east? Do we stick with lindy rigs and live bait or do we try jigs and plastics? If so, what do you recommend? Where and how should we approach this?"
6209034,BornToFish,2018-06-15 13:23:00,1224,"Greetings,I had some thoughts come to mind when I read the original post. However, I first need to state that I have never fished Eagle Lake, so my comments are more general in nature.I have fished MANY weeks during mid-August on another deep-water lake not too far from Eagle Lake. I am almost exclusively a structure based fisherman, rather than trolling open water. These comments are the framework for the following observations.I have noticed over the years that relatively few BIG walleyes are caught on structure during summers with relatively warm water temperatures. I believe that the bigger walleyes moved from structure to the abyss and chase ciscoes. I've done much better on BIG walleyes near structure during August when the water is relatively cool.Nearly all of my BIG walleyes on structure have come from structure with quick access to deep water. I typically fish for walleyes on rock humps during mid-August in 25-30 fow. The rock humps showing the bigger walleyes would be near water that is 35+ feet deep.I am not saying that such structure abounds with BIG walleyes, but that is where my wife and I caught our bigger walleyes. We still had to sort through smaller walleyes to connect with our bigger fish. The original poster might need to do the same, but maybe my suggestions will increase the odds of connecting with such fish.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6209040,chkncuscus,2018-06-15 13:33:00,6,"Awesome... we will mainly be targeting structure and fishing between 20-30 fow. We have not had much luck trolling open water in the past. What technique(s) do you use? Been reading up on drifting with bottom bounces (or lindy rigs) with spinner rigs, slow death rigs, etc. Any idea? Would love to come up with 3-4 solid techniques ready to go to find what works the best."
6209146,BornToFish,2018-06-15 20:55:00,1224,"Greetings,Vertical jigging on structure has been my best producing technique during August and September. I have found that the preferred depth for walleyes can be incredibly narrow in middle of August. For example, the walleyes might be stacked from 26-28 fow on a rock hump. This range in depth might translate to the width of my boat. Thus, vertical jigging has been my best technique as I can keep my lure in the strike zone virtually all the time. Other techniques such as bottom bouncers, Lindy Rigs, Slow Death rigs and casting simply leave the lure in the strike zone part of the time, but not all of the time. I enjoy fishing these other techniques at other times of the year, but I find them unsuitable during August and September when fishing rock humps and other similar structure (e.g. reefs). For me, it comes down to which technique will keep the lure in the strike zone for as much time as possible. I just haven't found another technique that can match vertical jigging when it comes to fishing rock humps in August and September.I have found that all live bait works well in early August. However, there comes a time in middle to late August that the bite collapses down to minnows. Artificial baits don't get the job done for me when vertical jigging rock humps in August and September. It seems that the walleyes just have too much time to think about my presentation when I'm vertical jigging - the lure isn't going anywhere to force them to make a quick decision.Trolling open water hasn't been at all productive for me when fishing lakes on the Canada Shield. There is just too much water to filter when I am only fishing one or two lines.You might find a situation where the walleyes go shallow and hit the top of the rock hump for a feeding window. If you find this happening (e.g. rough water or low light conditions), take advantage of it and try your rigging and casting techniques. In such a situation, you might find that your cast can be retrieved within the strike zone for nearly the entire length of your cast.The lake that I am fishing now has a good population of walleyes that relate to weeds throughout the season. These fish can be targeted by rigging (bottom bouncers or Lindy) or casting - working a weed edge. I will note that I haven't caught many BIG walleyes doing this - most 15-20 inch class fish).I've given you my observations based on my experience. Others may have different experiences.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6209192,pjshorthorn,2018-06-16 04:59:00,5654,"We fished everywhere from the very east end of the arm ( gateway area), Vermilion Bay areas and as far south as Boat Island and Portage Bay. We caught most of our walleye either drifting or trolling about 0.8-1.2 mph with spinner rigs and slow death rigs on a bottom bouncer using Crawlers. We would have been a little earlier in the year than your trip, but found most of the fish in 18-24 foot of water. Over the years on Eagle Lake I have also caught some nice 26-27"" walleye using a floating jighead with a 1/4 oz egg sinker above a barrel swivel and 36"" of leader. Have fun on the trip. It is a beauty of a lake. PjShorthorn"
6209970,chkncuscus,2018-06-18 09:01:00,6,"Any recommendations or how to locate musky during that time? Last trip we hooked one on the far west end off some rocks on a bucktail, I believe."
6210022,pjshorthorn,2018-06-18 10:39:00,5654,Rocks or reefs with related vegetation is a good start. Also look for little pocket bays with some structure and vegetation. You can pick up some nice northern is the same types of spots.PjShorthorn
6210052,chkncuscus,2018-06-18 11:32:00,6,"That sounds like the theme to Canadian fishing (or fishing in general) regardless of species... locate weeds, structure, humps and go from there..."
6210152,BornToFish,2018-06-18 14:30:00,1224,"Greetings,PJ offered some great advice. The thought that immediately came to mind was to encourage you to watch for ""windows"" that may open for you during the course of the day. I am referring to windows involving changes in wind/clouds/rain and solunar tables. Muskies are pretty well entrenched in their summer patterns by middle of August. They might only feed during a window. You can pretty well beat yourself up casting for muskies in mid-summer and have nothing to show for it, and then catch two within twenty minutes. You might just want to fish for them when they are likely to be chasing and fish for something else the remainder of the day.I fished a multi-species lake in mid-August for many years. I sort of learned to go with whatever might be biting at the moment. But, whenever I sensed a window might be opening, I made for my nearest musky spots and started throwing for them.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6210162,Ricky Spanish,2018-06-18 14:45:00,1298,"Everyone has some great advice. I'd definitely key on the deeper structure and keep a ""walleye looking"" rubber bait, like a Bulldawg or Poseidon, rigged up and near me while jigging eyes. It is not unusual to have a musky follow a walleye you are reeling in, if not outright eat the thing. Once you get the walleye off the hook, toss that rubber bait out and see what happens."
