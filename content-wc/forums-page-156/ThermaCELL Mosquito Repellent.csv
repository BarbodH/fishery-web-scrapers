6211630,labsrus,2018-06-21 10:37:00,557,We do a lot of late afternoon into evening trolls. Always take one along in the boat. If you forget it the skeeters will chase you off the lake. Wish they would work for those pesky flies that seem to sting the ankles during the day.

It keeps our 200 square foot deck tucked in the woods mosquito free for hours. I'm thinking this is ideal to have on a boat while fishing and in the fish house. Nothing like getting yourself full of blood smears trying to keep those buggers away. Curious if anyone has had any luck with these up north, so many seem to swear by them:https://www.cabelas.com/product/Ther...tabsCollection"

6211012,hoppy63,2018-06-20 08:40:00,367,"Taking it up this weekend. All reports say Skeeter's are about as terrible as has been seen in some time, so I'll give it a good test. This is Nakina area I'm speaking of."
6211040,Jwendt15,2018-06-20 09:23:00,72,"Hoppy, you'll have to let me know how it goes if you don't mind. Good luck on the trip!"
6211058,Bad Santa,2018-06-20 09:39:00,100,it doesn't work very well where it's windy. the vapor is blown away.
6211060,kona77,2018-06-20 09:40:00,236,Have been using them for hunting/camping in Wisconsin for years. I do not know if the skeets in Canada are tougher but for some reason the thermo cells are not as effective in Canada.. We like to fish off the docks at night or sit on the deck..Thermo cells do help and do not add much weight to our 100lb requirements so we take them every year..
6211158,hoppy63,2018-06-20 11:51:00,367,"Agreed in breeze it is not as effective. You can set it upwind a bit, but usually when its breezy mother nature knocks down the bugs a little."
6211160,hoppy63,2018-06-20 11:51:00,367,Will do.
6211248,Jwendt15,2018-06-20 14:44:00,72,"Right, I'm sure the effectiveness wears off considerably if you have a stiff breeze. My thinking was it would be ideal for the fish house, if it actually works."

We usually lunch with 4 boats so one crew filets, one preps food, one cooks and other cleans up. We put one unit by fish cleaners , one by cooks and one in eating area. They are really good at chasing the bugs away."
