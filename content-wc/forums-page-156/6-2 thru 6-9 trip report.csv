We seen a few moose and bears on the way and stopped for our hot dog roast which has become some what a tradition. We flew out Saturday morning with the anticipation from all running very high for the next week of fishing, the weather had changed from the previous week of hot temps to cloudy with a little rain and lower temps 55-60 deg. A group of family friends had booked the same cabin as our group so we knew we would receive great in-tell concerning the Cabin, Boats and yes the fishing on our way in. Now for the Fishing: (7) boats Saturday: After unpacking we all hit the water the weather was cold and windy with some rain but the fishing was fair to good for both walleye and pike, I would guess that each boat averaged 50 fish per boat. (350) Sunday: Again the weather was cold and windy some boats did great (100 fish) while others struggled I guess if catching 50-60 fish is considered struggling, again mostly walleye with some pike. (525) Monday: Again the weather was cold and windy most boats did great (100 fish) as we started to figure things out mostly the color the walleyes wanted chartreuse jig heads with white plastic's (700) Tuesday: The weather started to change to partly cloudy and warmer temps. and the bite was on for real no problem for all boats catching (100 fish) with a few topping the (150) mark GAME ON (850) Wednesday: The weather was perfect partly cloudy with just the right amount of wind to make jig fishing as good as it gets and the boy's took full advantage of the perfect weather and walleye bite David boated a 27""er which was the trips biggest walleye. On this day you could not help catch fish and the boat totals where outstanding to say the least (4 boats with 100+ fish) and (3) boats posting (200+ fish) (1000+) yes in one day Thursday: Clear skies and little wind BUT IT DID NOT MATTER as the lid blew off the fishing for everyone it was like the old saying goes ""like shooting fish in a barrel"" we where catching walleye and pike and even some very nice perch at will it seamed every boat landed over yes over (200 fish) (1400) Friday: Clear skies and little wind and a repeat of the day before except on this day Jack landed a 23"" lake trout which do get caught in this lake but not all that often and to top it off he caught it in 6ft. of water jigging for walleye. Again all boats over (200 fish) (1400) This place is indeed the walleye factory of the North approx. fish totals for the week (7) boats (14) men (6,225 fish) Just an unbelievable week of fishing family bonding and yes beer. NOW IT JUST DOES NOT GET ANY BETTER THAN THAT!!!!!!!!!!!! Yes I know I did not say which lake we where fishing on BUT I will say we used Twin Lake Outfitters and they did a very nice job once again with the Cabin, Boats and motors and plenty of gas. ""Thanks Chad"""

6208116,Potatoe,2018-06-12 19:39:00,164,"Sounds like a fun trip, do they supply poles and bait also"
6208156,ziggyzag,2018-06-12 21:25:00,125,I did not say it was a secret! Just said I did not mention it.
6208288,stumcfar,2018-06-13 08:28:00,451,"Great report. I went fishing too and had a great trip, caught a ton of fish but I am not telling where this great place is! Kind of a puzzling post, but glad you had fun."
6208382,phishfearme,2018-06-13 11:46:00,1242,"yah, really - a very valuable addition to this blog. here's another one: ""went to xyz lake. it's not a secret how we did, just not gonna mention it""."
6210456,Ebarnett,2018-06-19 06:59:00,60,"Seriously not going to mention the name of the lake? What is the point of the report? - here is one for you......I went up north, cabin and boats were nice, day 1; we caught a whopping 10,000 25+ walleye, but the pike bite was almost nonexistent only about 600, most of them over 30. So sore, we took the rest of the week off and drank beer. Plane ride out we saw a moose."
6210474,Freytown,2018-06-19 07:13:00,770,"ziggyzag went to Abamasagi, just check his older posts. Two groups going to Abamasagi with Twin Lake Outfitters.
