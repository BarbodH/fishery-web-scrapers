These folks rely upon tips as part of their income and I'm happy to compensate them for great service. Thankfully, I've never had an experience bad enough where I wouldn't have tipped them.

6210804,Bstar,2018-06-19 19:22:00,564,Would that be at Voyageurs Lodge and Cookhouse?
6210834,jkaup,2018-06-19 20:38:00,56,Our bank offers overnight foreign currency exchange. It cost me $20 to get enough CAD for our cab ride and a stop at Timmy's.

6210372,pjshorthorn,2018-06-19 04:16:00,5654,Stop at an ATM. Your bank should adjust the withdrawal into US dollars at the current exchange rate when they debit your account. PjShorthorn
6210388,wally28,2018-06-19 05:12:00,65,We always exchange money at the casino which is just past the Canadian customs. Always the best exchange rate.
6210398,Shellback,2018-06-19 05:25:00,8083,"Make sure you call your bank and tell them you will be traveling in Canada. You should get the current daily exchange rate, and just the ATM fee. Not a percentage fee of the total transaction as you would at a money exchange."
6210428,pjshorthorn,2018-06-19 06:10:00,5654,Correct. Good addition to the post. PjShorthorn
6210436,HeHooksHimself,2018-06-19 06:18:00,725,About 40 miles past the border crossing there is an exchange in Agawa. Good rates and no hassles. friends of mine make this a regular stopl Fish On! Hooks
6210446,Freytown,2018-06-19 06:32:00,770,"Also ask your bank what your max withdrawal cap is, as just about every bank has a limit. FT"
6210596,NARDA 1,2018-06-19 09:59:00,636,It's also a good idea to let your debit and credit card companies know where and when you will be traveling so they aren't flagged and restricted for suspicious activity.

Grocery store, hotel, fast food, gas station all took credit card and had no issues. Best part was nothing to exchange when done."
6210638,Guest,2018-06-19 11:20:00,0,"Thats true! There can be a daily limit and a monthly limit. for out of country cash withdrawals from an ATM. I use my Credit Card. Always get the best rates exchange rate with no hassle. Some credit cards have no foreign exchange fee. Most cards add a percent or 2 on the exchange rate. My card does not, but I don't get points. So you give some and you lose some."
