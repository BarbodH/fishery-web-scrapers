6209328,3M TA3,2018-06-16 10:32:00,2846,"Since 2001 I've averaged 3 trips per year totaling 5 weeks of Canadian fishing per year. That would not count the numerous weekend jaunts for a day or two of excitement dipping into Canadian waters while fishing Erie, Huron, or Superior."
6209412,DaBirdman,2018-06-16 16:29:00,164,"First trip was in '77 when I was 5. Haven't made it every year due to job change, wife from California (go there every other year), etc. But total trips would be between 40-45 since some of those years were 2 or 3 trips in a year. Finally at an age and at a point where I get a healthy amount of vacation leave, and don't see myself missing a year unless there are unforeseen circumstances. Doing my 1st fly-in trip this year and am very excited for that!"
6209426,HeHooksHimself,2018-06-16 17:45:00,725,"First trip to Canada was in 2000 after two trips to Minnesota that did not produce what we had hoped. I have been every year since then and started two trips a year in 2011. That makes me a member of the 25 trip club! However none of my trips have included Flamingos, yoga pants or sailing over beaver dams. I guess I am no Bill, but also no PJShorthorn either. I have to start looking for variety! Fish On! Hooks"
6209448,Guest,2018-06-16 18:41:00,0,"No idea but not enough in 45 years. First several years three trips a few days each on all three long weekends. Missed a few in there from time to time but now on a 20+ year run of one a year and a few twofer's in there. Going two a year starting next year and three a year when I retire in a couple of years. Never saw a Flamingo, don't ware Yoga Pants, did fly over Beaver dams, boys sunk an outfitters boat in a fast moving channel. They saw a Boreal Monkey( they swear, we wonder??) Saw 90f many times and 3"" of snow once. Almost all trips the second week of the season. Skunked once on a July trip, 90+f every day, worst cabin I every had and that was the trip I took my wife on. She would still go back. Loved every trip. Thanks to the Canadians for letting us visit and the great hospitality! Not sure we deserve it."
6209452,elway12,2018-06-16 18:50:00,335,5 Next year will hopefully be my 6th time going. But every time has been special and a blast!
6209854,Guest,2018-06-18 05:49:00,0,July will be my 35th trip. As I get closer to retirement I hope to go at least twice a year.
6210156,Ricky Spanish,2018-06-18 14:31:00,1298,"I would have to guesstimate at 16 or 17 trips to Eagle Lake since 2002. I think we missed 2008-2009, but did a 3yr run of 2 per year to make up for it. We are going to try our darnedest to get up to Ontario this fall, but will not be back to Eagle until next year. We would be there right now if my wife didn't have surgery last week. Her Dad and brother are likely bouncing their way back from a hot day down at Nivens Bay right now."
6210740,jambi,2018-06-19 15:49:00,504,"I've been 17 times since 2000. Missed one year - 2016. All of these trips I've driven up from Oklahoma. Avg 2,400 miles round trip puts me at 40,800 miles on the road up and back. Doing it again in September."
6208214,Guest,2018-06-13 05:42:00,0,"If day trips and short weekends count, I must be in the few hundred or maybe more category If only considering the extended 5-day plus type trips, then maybe only 5-6?"
6208222,UKBDM,2018-06-13 06:22:00,178,Started with canoe only wilderness trip to Quetico in 1997 ... missed only one year (bad back) until 2009. Started going to Wabaskang in 2010 when my son was 11. Haven't missed since ... looks like 18 years or trips total. Hoping to go 2x per year at some point.
6208224,andreindy,2018-06-13 06:22:00,308,"I have experienced only 1 Canadian fishing trip. Last year, with my father and brother and son. All their first time as well. However, an element or experience from that trip is laughed about, discussed, or threatened every day since. They were experiences, but on steroids. My dad can fully expect numerous references to his acquisition of Giardia...within 5 minutes of leaving our driveway for this year's trip."
6208230,Bill Krejca,2018-06-13 06:44:00,6107,"Ha! I'm sorta reminded of the country song (about everything reminds me of a country song) sung by Tammy Whynnot, paraphrased ""Gotta Keep Goin' Til I Get It Right"" or something like that! Bill"
6208236,Twodogs,2018-06-13 06:47:00,115,Lac des mille Lodge for 39 years this year...have had 2 week stays up there numerous times and have been to three other places with different groups so 42 trips...where has the time gone ?
6208264,drexje,2018-06-13 07:43:00,18,44 consecutive years . Haven't missed a year yet. All to the same fly in camp. Owner has changed 3 times but the fishing has only gotten better.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
6208322,pjshorthorn,2018-06-13 09:28:00,5654,"I probably have been on about 25-ish trips since 1996 with one or two before that. I didn't count all of my fishing licenses from Canada ( yep, got every one of them) so I may be off by one or so. If Breezy Point reads this thread, I know he will have an amazing number of trips under his belt just like Bill. I don't think I will ever approach the number of trips that Breezy or Bill have amassed so far. Pretty amazing when you think about it, but I do have one trip that involved 12 pink flamingos so I have that going for me. PjShorthorn"
6208360,Lip_Yanker,2018-06-13 10:44:00,116,"Low man on the totem- Only 1 trip, summer of 1984. Never could find anyone willing to commit to go after that, until now.1st trip back will be in a few weeks with my son. Very much looking forward to this... Planning to make it a yearly trek for as long as I can from now on.."
6208406,emma17,2018-06-13 12:49:00,436,"10 trips over 6 years for me, shared with my sons every year and wife the last 4. No matter how often I go or how recently I went, I find it nearly impossible to not think about going on the next trip."
6209116,Jabs,2018-06-15 18:04:00,24,"We talked about this going up this spring. We have been going up since 1983. I was 23 at the time and now 58. As they say when you get older, you get forgetful on things. and we've made numerous trips And I really can't remember which years we made more than one trip. I can happily say that I have spent a year of my life fishing in Canada . I feel very blessed for thatI feel very blessed for that."
6207830,bigwalleye1,2018-06-12 09:03:00,2632,"Just out of curiosity, how many trips have you made north of the border? Maybe total number of trips, and how many in the current string? For me, it's been 30 trips since 1999, two a year since 2005, haven't missed one yet, so my total and my streak are 30."
6207832,Overwatchmike,2018-06-12 09:07:00,201,I have 58 trips under my belt. Almost all of them have been to my cabin since '99. 2 more this year.Sent from my SM-G955U using Tapatalk
6207852,Carnhzkr,2018-06-12 09:52:00,964,"If you count 'em all, it's probably between 65 - 70 trips. My dad drug his family up to Ontario and Manitoba starting in '66 or '67, when I was barely big enough to hold a pole. Since then, I've missed 6 or 7 years due to college and jobs and what not. To make up for those few lost years, I've been lucky enough to make at least two trips per season since 1996. The vast majority of those trips were drive-to lakes, with 7 fly-ins scattered in the mix."
6207856,WalleyeWally28,2018-06-12 09:59:00,298,34 trips to the NW section of Lac Seul since 1997. Three more planned for this year.
6207908,Bill Krejca,2018-06-12 11:45:00,6107,"Roughly, 127 trips, not counting several to Minnesota, and 2 that are scheduled for 2018. Probably shouldn't have counted the 3 before WWII, as I was mighty young. Unlike now. Bill"
6207924,Pooch,2018-06-12 12:20:00,4618,"Bill, you are ""The Man""! This next trip will be number sixty five for me, but compared to BK I'm still the ""New Guy"". (There is an acronym for new guy, but this is a ""G"" rated site, so let's keep it that way.) Pooch"
6208160,mr.crampster,2018-06-12 21:30:00,18,"44 years. Plus the last twenty twice a year.. so 64 plus one year I went three times. Grand total 65 trips to Red Lake ,Ontario. One trip to Whitefish lake in Nolalu."
6208196,btyreprich,2018-06-13 03:48:00,1067,First trip to Canada was back in 1977 - 41 years ago. In the beginning - before kids and when the wife worked full time - we'd make two trips a year. Would gues that we have made close to 90 trips in this time frame. So looking forward to being able to make 2 trips again when I retire.
6208204,Walleye2242,2018-06-13 04:58:00,263,1st trip was in 1979 and i was 7. missed a few years here and there along the way but i would say i am over 25 trips. Various spots in ontario but recently most of them have been to gullrock. red lake area.
6208212,bigwalleye1,2018-06-13 05:37:00,2632,"Some incredible numbers so far! Keep 'em coming! Safe travels to everyone this year, on the roads and on the water!"
