Need to keep our options open and are looking at Showalter's. Looking at Cherrington, Carrol, Cochrane, and Severn. I believe I have read all past threads on them all. Does not seem to be much info posted since about 2015. We tend to target walleye, but enjoy a good bout with a northern. Looking for info on quality/quantity of fish. Quality of cabins, boats, motors, and camp equipment. If there is anything else you would like to add, please throw it out there. Thank you."

6206516,pnnylfr,2018-06-09 08:29:00,114,"Thanks Obabikon, that seems to be the general consensus. As we look at possible new outfitter they are definitely on our short list."
6206802,LoDo,2018-06-09 22:07:00,721,"Ive fished Donald Lake, directly east of Carroll the past 10 yrs and love it. 100 walleye days if numbers are your thing. Donald has two outlets that flow into Carroll. Big are usually 26-28' range with numerous 22-24' caught daily. We usually see a 40"" northern annually, however plenty of 34-36"". If the days are warm and later in the season we'll down rig lakers and def pick up a few. All in all, can't beat Woodland Caribou Prov Park. I'd love to get down to Carroll, but its just not feasible. Portage seems like a lot of work knowing Donald produces."
6208304,pnnylfr,2018-06-13 08:56:00,114,"LoDo, thanks for your reply. Carroll looks like a lake with room to explore. Appears to be one other camp on the lake but still plenty of room. If we end up here, I will hit you up to review your tactics."
6209016,jambi,2018-06-15 12:05:00,504,"I've been using Eddie since 2006 - I've been to Pine Needle, Action, Cochrane, Irwin, Meandrine, and Cherrington. Camp equipment has been just fine. One thing about him, if something isn't right he will be out to fix it asap. We found a boat flooded out on a portage lake (previous guests didn't pull the dang plug!) and couldn't get it started. I called Eddie on the sat phone that night. The next morning it was up and running before we could make the portage.... He's adding new cabins to many of his camps. Action and Irwin both got new kitchen cabins last year. I'm headed back to Irwin in late September. I've become friends with some of his regulars - like 20 + year guys, and they have been to Carroll and Severn many times. I've stopped at Severn and that is a beautiful camp. I know he has 80 to 90% repeat clients so getting a specific camp at a specific date is tough. We bounce around so we are always flexible each year. PM for more info. SG in Tulsa, Oklahoma"

There is a camp about in the E/W middle, one on the far east, and one northeast on Gammon River. The good spots get a lot of pressure for a fly-in."
