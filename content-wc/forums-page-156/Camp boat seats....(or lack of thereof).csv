I am youngest in group at 55 and not sure how long I can manage without a backrest. Has anyone else run into this and are there any good, readable solutions??? Looking at portable boat seats now."
6210978,maddogg,2018-06-20 07:56:00,178,Wow that's the first time I've heard of a camp not having boat seats? May be you could adapt a stadium seat to fit.https://www.walmart.com/c/kp/stadium-seats

6211004,hoppy63,2018-06-20 08:35:00,367,Yes...seems odd to not have seats with backs. I'm quite sure the average age of customers is not in the 30's...I'm looking for clamp on seats but has to be where I can go buy them as I leave Thursday night.
6211304,Pooch,2018-06-20 16:30:00,4618,"I don't think it is uncommon on remote lakes to not have boat seats. Customers destroy them plus they are not overly durable. One big leaning back stretch and the back of the seat is busted or the clamp breaks free. I don't blame remote camps for not having seats. I see many guys carry their own as we also did in the early years. Bad thing is that they are heavy and kill your weight allowance on a fly-in.Whether you like me saying it or not, guests destroy a lot of equipment because they either are inexperienced or just don't care about owners property.Some camps that used to offer insurance on boats have dropped it as guests beat the crap out of props, seats and the boat in general because they ""had insurance"". Most have gone back to ""if you break it, you pay for it"" policy. I don't blame them for doing so.Pooch"

6211506,Doublelung76,2018-06-21 07:01:00,42,Clamp ons are nice but some don't go wise enough for bench seat.also clamp mounts are heavy and it's hard enough to make weight
6211528,antimoniker,2018-06-21 08:07:00,5,"We have gone on a few day trip flyins to a lake that also did not have swivel chairs/backrests. A couple of years ago we started bringing along a very light weight ""trail chair"" that REI and some other camping outfitters sell. I was skeptical that it would provide support given some lower back issues when I saw it on the internet, but it really worked surprisingly well once we actually used it in the boat. The REI version is called the ""co-op trail chair."""
