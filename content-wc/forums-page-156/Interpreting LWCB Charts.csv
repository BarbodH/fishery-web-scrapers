I don't know why, really, since you can't do anything about the water level and I'm going no mater if the water's high or low so ""it is what it is"" as they say. So how do you interpret these charts? I believe the yellow portion represents the expected normal range, so today's chart shows the water level on Lac Seul to be on the low end or normal. Maybe the red dashed lines on the upper and lower side show a standard deviation on either side of normal, but I'm not sure about that. The bottom two charts show the inflow and outflow from a given point. I interpret these to mean there is more water flowing in than going out, but it's coming in at a lower than normal rate, so all in all, I'd expect the water level to rise, but it's not going to rise very quickly.https://www.lwcb.ca/pdf/LacSeulGraph2018.06.18.pdf Anyone have any insight on how to interpret the data?"
6210044,stjoeguy,2018-06-18 11:17:00,979,"I believe that the yellow area shows the water level 25-75% of the time. The red lines are the upper and lower 10%. Lake level is above the upper line 10% of the time.http://www.lwcb.ca/permpdf/CurrentGraphsLegend.pdf On the historical graphs the little numbers are the level and year of records.http://www.lwcb.ca/permpdf/LS/5-Yr_LS-2011-2015.pdf i'd agree with your interpretation of slowing rising lake level. And you're right, it's fun to look at, but it is what it is. I watch both lake level and weather closely before we go. The lake level is accurate, but I don't know why I bother with the weather forecast. It's just part of the pre-trip anticipation."

6210142,DeBo,2018-06-18 14:03:00,211,Don't forget to click on the current bulletin as well. I like that as they give a forecast as to what outflow will be set to and expected lake level changes. I think they update it once or twice a week. Back in the 2014 high water they were releasing updates almost daily. I always check that page before trips too even though it has 0 impact on the trip overall. I think the navionics webapp is worse before LOTW trips for time killers. I enjoy the pre-trip research as it helps build even more anticipation.
