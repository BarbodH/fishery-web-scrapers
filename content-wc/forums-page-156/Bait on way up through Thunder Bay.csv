Any places you reccommend for nightcrawlers, possibly minnows? Probably leaning toward salted minnows as they would be easier to keep. Any places you recommend?"

You probably need to order salted minnows in advance. http://www.fishlakebaitharris.com Or, depending on what part of the Cities you're coming from, Vados Bait on 65 in Spring Lake Park is a good spot for frozen minnows. https://www.vadosbait.com/index.php"
