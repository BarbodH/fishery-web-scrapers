6144729,fldoc1,2018-04-19 16:44:00,69,"Sturgeon Lake is a huge, beautiful, mostly clear, deep, dangerous piece of water. With that said it gets little pressure as most fisherman move on after fishing there a few times. I am fascinated by the lake and think that if one puts the time in it is probably a gem of a lake to fish. My crew did not like lake trout fishing but we trolled and jigged a few hours one day and cough a small one and lost a bigger one. I have also fished out of Lumberjack lodge (southern end of the lake - mid summer) and we did super on the out lakes. Again my crew was intimidated by the lake so I left my 18 ft lund at home and we fished smaller lakes with the lodge boats. I would recommend either host and if fishing gets hard try some of the smaller out lakes. I fished mid-summer the first year the new owners ran Trappers Point. I felt they went out of their way to make it a successful trip. We liked our cabin and the lodge location on the lake. I have the Canadian chip and the map is not too detailed compared to Lac Seul. I had the owner take me out the first time and he identified some hidden dangers. I way pointed the danger areas plus put a safe trail down the lake. We fished hard for big northerns with little luck. Part of our group borrowed my 4x4 and went to smaller area lakes and did well. I recently talked to the owner of Trappers Point at the Duluth sports show and he told me he had identified some good walleye spots. We did drive to Fitchie Lake one day, launched our 18 foot boats, and enjoyed the lake and caught walleyes. About an hours drive north. But I know there are closer out lakes that one can get into with smaller boats. If I remember right it was not easy to find good information of the lake. I know there are some older Walleye Central posts that one could research. Randy from Duluth"
6196644,reidcb,2018-05-19 09:18:00,24,"From above ""Sturgeon Lake is a huge, beautiful, mostly clear, deep, dangerous piece of water."" This is accurate. Don't go flying across the lake. We have yet to catch a laker. I fish out of Lumberjack on the South end. That arm of the lake has an acid that keeps the fish out. The logs were floated down the arm to the southern tip of Sturgeon and the bark came off in the process. As the bark deteriorates the process left it uninhabitable for fish. This may not be exactly correct, however, it is close. However, if you go up into the main part of the lake it is fishable. I like it there. We mainly fish the surrounding lakes."
6210700,ScottWisconsin,2018-06-19 14:26:00,14,"Hello again folks, well its only about 8 weeks until we depart west central wisconsin for north west ontario. We will arrive at trappers point on sept 1st and the long range forecast calls for highs in the mid 60s lows in the low 40s with a hit or miss shower over the weeks stay. I was wondering if anyone has been to sturgeon this spring/early summer and how things went? I follow the trappers point web site and they got 2 walleyes over 30"" last week with a few others in the 27-28 range. A couple other questions for those in the know. 1. the ontario govt website shows walleye northern lakers perch and whitefish as the fishable species. I thought a lake that size would have small mouth as well? wishful thinking maybe. I also was wondering what out lakes in that area you would suggest for walleyes smallies northern? anything really. One last long shot question.. wha about rivers and streams a guy could fish from shore and maybe just explore/wade? One of the bucket list fish i would LOVE to get is a decent brook trout. Hands down one of the coolest freshwater fish swimming in my opinion. As always any info is good info guys. Thank you in advance. Cronk scott"
6110274,ScottWisconsin,2018-04-04 16:00:00,14,"Hey folks looking for info on sturgeon lake near savant lake. We will be there in sept 1-8. Were staying at trappers point. I have looked around on line for reports and any other info but have come up pretty empty. All i really know about it is, shes a big body of water by wisconsin standards. If anyone has any insights about this fishery i would love to pick your brain. Thanks in advance, Cronk Stay safe and good fishin!"
6110866,ScottWisconsin,2018-04-04 22:26:00,14,I guess i should add id also like to do any of my own leg work on this trip. Im just looking for ideas on where to search out this info. I looked at ontarios tourism web site but everything is very general in nature. Are there good resources to dig out this info?? maybe a ontario fishing site? or angling social media hub for ontario? Cronk
6110962,Namegosikaa,2018-04-05 04:17:00,61,"Not exactly sure where trapped point is but I did fish it years ago but at the south end, after you leave the narrows it opens up and becomes very deep where we mostly targeted lake trout with limited success. The back bays were dotted with cottages where we tried for walleye and pike with no success. It was probably the heat wave in mid July that slowed things down not sure, on that note the north end is said to be the best water which I never made it too. I'm sure my experience was a fluke and I've heard nothing but good things especially at the north end. I'm sure you will love it. Maybe post your question on Mike Borgers canadafishingguide.net Or Ontario fishing community"
6111298,Bill Krejca,2018-04-05 07:14:00,6107,"Just do a search here on WC on the lake; we have had several discussions in the past, should be some info you can use. Also try a Goggle search. Bill"

6111738,Pooch,2018-04-05 10:21:00,4618,"Many years ago wife and I stayed at a camp located in the middle of the lake. We were expecting walleye, but guests there told us it was about an hour drive by boat to get to the north end of the lake for walleye. Middle of the lake is deep, cold and gin clear. Lake trout water, not walleye water. We left after three nights. Nice camp, but just felt we were misled.Buddy of mine fished north end last summer and I think he had a good walleye trip.Just a couple thoughts.Pooch"
6116066,JJJMN,2018-04-07 06:16:00,153,"Our group has been going to north end of lake for 30 years for the opener. As the spring fishing would be different than later in season I can only relate feedback from others and camp owner. Walleye, Northern, and Lake Trout all within 10 min boat ride of far north end. Big lake with big rocks. Best maps of lake haven't been available for many years. Camp owners sometimes have decent maps but hard to come by. If you can get GPS tracks from others you can speed across lake to hot spots for trout, northerns and walleye. Water depth can very 1 to 1 1/2 feet thru the season and year to year. Issue when it comes to rocks. In the week we do we usually have at least someone in camp losing a lower unit. We normally fish for walleye but sunny afternoons we go after northerns, many in the 15 to 18lb range, largest over the years about 24lb. Lake trout 4 to 6lb but have seen 15lb plus taken. Slot limits on walleye has improved size and qty over the years. North end protected zone has also helped. In the early years it was common to catch 10lb females off the dock during spawn. Again, opener would be different than later in season but have always had a great trip. Location allows for drive in, close to store in Savant Lake for forgotten supplies and roads have been in great shape for the past few years (wasn't always the case). Hope you have a great trip."
6128106,northernbite,2018-04-12 09:58:00,1186,"Trappers Point is in Northern end of Lake. Camps right off of 599. In the area my cousin and I fished there are Lake trout, large pike. The walleye from what I understand are in certain spots. Big lake to explore. Have fun.Paul"
6135761,HodakaD,2018-04-15 20:28:00,106,"What are the options for digital lake maps for Sturgeon? I would like a good one for my Helix if possible. I had one in my old Lowrance last year, but the contours were in 20 foot increments. Does anyone know if there is a better option?"
6136065,northernbite,2018-04-16 06:21:00,1186,"Also Scott after talking with my cousin who had and has fished the northern end by Trappers Point, felt that the upper end has more options for walleye.Paul"
