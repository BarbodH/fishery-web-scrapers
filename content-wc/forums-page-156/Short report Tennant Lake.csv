6209912,HeHooksHimself,2018-06-18 07:34:00,725,"BStar, the lack of options was definitely a negative, but I can't say we were bored pulling up walleye after walleye. When we got there (June 6) the water was high and the trip up the river was uneventful, even though it was our first time running rapids. We had no issues getting to Kap, which by the way was our go to fishing area. the 6-8' plateau on the north side of the entrance to Kap (across from the cabin) was where we fished the most. Constant action any time of the day. As the water receded about a foot throughout the week we began to contact rocks in the river and the river was less accommodating. We never ventured far into Kap since there was a group in the Kap cabin. Interestingly they were flying the Jolly Roger and acting as pirates. We saw them fishing in the boil as the river enters into Kap once, but most of the time they were further down the lake. The cabin slipping off the foundation was remedied immediately. Chad knew it needed attention but thought he might be able to hold off until an upcoming open week. He apologized profusely but did not offer us any discounts or anything. It turned out to be no big deal and we now have an experience that few can claim. Good luck at Melchett! Hooks"
6209916,HeHooksHimself,2018-06-18 07:43:00,725,"Bill, we have our share of odd things that have happened and many great experiences, At the same time, my resume is tiny compared to yours. What a treat it would be to spend an hour over a beverage of any kind and pick your brain. Are you planning another book about you past 20 or 30 years? If so, I would certainly be among your first purchasers! Hooks"
6210208,Bstar,2018-06-18 16:20:00,564,"Pirates in Kap? Hey, what happens in Canada stays in Canada! Lol"
6210212,pjshorthorn,2018-06-18 16:26:00,5654,I see what you did there. Thanks buddy . Go Irish ! PjShorthorn
6210444,HeHooksHimself,2018-06-19 06:28:00,725,Bingo!
6210600,Bill Krejca,2018-06-19 10:02:00,6107,"Hooks - Actually, I started another book a few years ago, based more upon my observations/experiences, but finally put it away, got maybe 1/3 finished. As you are probably aware, I had promised Dad that I was going to write the book about his adventures, so it was a promise kept after he passed; it was probably the promise which drove me to write it, and I seem to be lacking the emotional incentive to produce another. It is a bit more work than would be imaginable. Bill"
6210750,HeHooksHimself,2018-06-19 16:26:00,725,"Bill, I so enjoyed reading about the adventures of your father and friends in the Hupmobile! It seems like it was more of an adventure of discovery. I get turned around in lakes that I am familiar with but these guys had no fear. I was captured by your writing style and felt like I was part of the adventure. You are talented but it is probably my selfishness to hear about your exploits that motivates me to encourage you. If you ever decide to complete it, I will buy it no matter the price. Fish On! Hooks"
6209548,HeHooksHimself,2018-06-17 06:52:00,725,"Our first fly in with Twin Lakes Outfitters through Nakina Air Services to Tennant Lake. First and most importantly, the river and where it empties into Kappagawonga (I have no idea how the name of that lake is spelled) was a walleye factory. Our party of 6 caught 1338 fish and only about 40 were pike. Largest walleye was 24"" and largest pike was 35 1/2"". We flew in minnows and replenished on the check flight but they went fast. On the minnowless days the plastics worked well. Minnows produced about 3 to 1 over plastics. Positives- Chad with TLO was awesome to work with. He was quick to respond to questions and help us plan the trip. Compared to other fly in opportunities, this is very inexpensive. we payed about 650/person for a week, taxes included. Lots of fish in the river system and they are not picky, Numbers were ridiculous' Weather was great, a little warm but we never got out the rain gear and only had one day where wind was a factor. Cabin was adequate for 6 but would be more comfortable for four. Because of the bugs, there porch was almost unusable. Boats were adequate with 9.9, at least we were going slow enough that no damage was done by hitting rocks, which is inevitable. We had an incredible time with good friends. Everyone was very happy. I am not sure I would do this specific lake again, just for the lack of options, but I would definitely recommend Twin Lakes Outfitters. Reasonable and accommodating. If you want to catch lots of walleye, this is your place. Negatives- TLO is at the mercy of Nakina Air Services. We had some minor issues they worked it out but it resulted in our group splitting up for the fly in. We all got there but the one pilot was really ticked off about it and did not say one word. Also, the pilots don't do the work that you would expect at camp, like filling up the gas tank and checking that the cabin has been cleaned. We inherited a very dirty cabin. While fish are plentiful in the river, they are not plentiful anywhere else. We picked up a few here and there, but only slayed them in one area, which we felt was a lack of variety. We were almost always fishing next to each other. The guy that runs Pennock in Nakina is not very pleasant. Seems like everything we requested and paid dearly for was a problem for him. His wife is much more pleasant. We stayed in their room which worked out okay. No restaurant in Nakina so eat in Geraldton or you are at the mercy of grilling options through Pennocks, which will set you back a little. While the cabin at the lake was adequate, it actually fell off the foundation while we were there. In fairness, the only thing we lost was a jar of salsa off the shelf. We came back from fishing the second day and thought a bear had visited until we figured it out. Chad had planned to secure the cabin later in the month when he had a week open but this happened first. Chad was there the next morning with a helper and they worked most of the day to get it fixed and somewhat level. No issues after that. More mosquitoes than I have ever experienced. Any time we were outside the swarmed you. We managed to keep them out of the cabin for the most part, but several of us had buzzing in our ears a few nights. If you went out to pee at night the swatting may cause a shower for your shoes! The MNR hits this chain of lakes pretty regularly. Make sure you are legal! I hope everyone has a great year. I have a second trip this year going to our go to place- Wine Lake Camp. Fish On! Hooks"
6209756,phishfearme,2018-06-17 18:07:00,1242,"good report - thanks. about going outside to pee at night - we stopped doing that years ago - we now use a ""honey pot"" bucket and place it in the most isolated corner of the cabin - pee here or hold it till morning!! you simply cannot go outside then come back in without dragging in bugs. phish"
6209764,pjshorthorn,2018-06-17 18:15:00,5654,Do you guys draw straws on who has to dump the honey pot or do you have a bee keeper type that just loves the job? PjShorthorn
6209814,HeHooksHimself,2018-06-17 21:03:00,725,"We have used the honey pot before but those who have ""short horns"" and you know who you are, tend to make a mess of the floor like they do in the boat with leaky bail buckets. Hooks"
6209816,wallydave,2018-06-17 21:20:00,2151,Working in health care I have access to bed side urinals! They come in handy in the boat or cabin!
6209850,pjshorthorn,2018-06-18 04:46:00,5654,You better bring one of those with you for Breezy. He tends to leave the cap off the pee bottle. Paint it gold with a pink ribbon around it I'd hate to hear that he peed all over the inside of his boat again.....LOL.PjShorthorn
6209862,Bstar,2018-06-18 06:01:00,564,Nice report. That's a lot of fish but I can see how it would get boring fishing the same spot everyday. Just wondering if the river is navigable into Kap Lake which would open up a lot more water to anybody staying on Tennant. We are going to Melchett in Sept. and we were planning on getting crawlers at Pennock's. Maybe we'll pick them up at Young's in Wawa instead. That's crazy that the cabin fell off of the foundation. You would think that since the owner knew about the problem that it would be high priority to at least put in some temporary shoring until it could be permanently fixed. Might have been a different story if it happened at 2 AM! lol
6209864,Bstar,2018-06-18 06:05:00,564,Here you go. The best product ever made. Tap your kidney and bail your boat all in one cheap product. https://www.amazon.com/Ounce-Deluxe-...70_&dpSrc=srchI never go fishing without one.
6209872,Bill Krejca,2018-06-18 06:17:00,6107,Thanks for the report. Sometimes the odd things which happen remain with us long after the actual fishing just become blended in with so many other catching tales (tails?). Bill
6209874,phishfearme,2018-06-18 06:20:00,1242,"our solution to the ""missing the target"" and ""splish-splash"" problem was to simply put the honey bucket up on a chair or something to get it closer to the source. phish"
