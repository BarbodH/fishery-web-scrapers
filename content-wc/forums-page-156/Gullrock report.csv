Cabins were in great shape and very clean. Very nice accommodations compared to a lot of places that have stayed. We upgraded the boat to an 18' G3 with a 50HP four stroke. Great boat to fish out of and a lot of space for the 3 of us. Very similar were the standard camp boats and talking to the people that were in them they fished great too.Fishing was great all week. We had very warm weather the entire week. I was concerned on a couple of the mornings as there was little wind and bright sunny days. Think the fish moved slightly deeper those days but they still bit.Fishing with kids along we mainly were looking for numbers. Gullrock has a bumper crop of 14-15 inch fish that we found and stayed on top of. Kids loved it and they were perfect fish for the meals of fish we ate several times that week. We had our share of overs too. We had multiple over 20 on each outing. Big fish of the trip was 25"" walleye but like I said we tried to stick to more action than size.Went for pike one afternoon. Did not get numbers but the 9 year old hooked into a 40"" fish that day. Great pictures and memories.Ian runs a top notch place. Keeps everything very clean and was very concerned we were catching fish. He provided pointers each day before we went out and provided more input when we returned. That input helped in follow on days as he would get where we were at and say stuff like go about 100 yards further and look for some landmark, then slide out to a certain depth. Sure enough we found fish in those spots too.We did try one of his portage lakes one day. It provided Smallmouth action. We did not crush them but found a few Smallies that would play. Had we had more experience we probably would have done better. Caught a bunch of smaller pike on this trip too.For anyone looking for a good clean camp with quality fishing I would recommend them. The bonus was they have things for the kids to do. Kayaks and paddle boats. Kids spent some time on them as I was cooking dinner or sitting on the deck watching them."

6210434,Ebarnett,2018-06-19 06:15:00,60,Me and my group will be on Gullrock for the first time at 5 lakes lodge in August. Does anyone have a marked map of hotspots for walleye and pike they can email me? If so please PM me. Thanks!
6210512,valley366,2018-06-19 07:58:00,193,"For the remote lake we went to Flat Lake. Is about 15 minute car ride. Ian had a boat all rigged up and ready to go and we towed it over there. A little tricky backing down the driveway to the landing but not overly challenging. Tube jigs were the ticket for bass. Was told green tubes worked the best. Another group that had more bass fishing experience did better than us but we had fun. For the pike in the bays we just through spoons, spinner baits and Mepps spinners. All were about equally successful.For maps Ian will hook you up. After getting unloaded he gave us a map of the lake. Took out a pencil and highlighted the places people are fishing. Several times during the week he took our map and gave us more spots as we had a chance to digest what he had given us previously. I will see if I can scan mine this week and get it to you.This map is popular in camp. Several times talking to other guests when they talked about where they were fishing they would pull out the map."
6210914,riverat56,2018-06-20 05:53:00,42,I leave for Five Lakes Lodge on Saturday! They truly run one of the best resorts I've ever been to. Gull Rock is a heck of a fishery and they make sure you're on fish.
6211006,johnboat,2018-06-20 08:35:00,2014,"It's a GREAT CAMP that gets better every year.....as does the fishing. Although it has always been in great shape, they manage to make inprovments every year that just adds to the comfort and enjoyment your stay. Our 8-10 man group has been on the same week (1st week in June) for 17 years, as have most of the rest of camp. It's like a family reunion every year. I wouldn't trade that week for all Bourbon in Kentucky!From what I hear, they runs some awesome Bear and Wolf hunts now as well. &#x1f642;"
