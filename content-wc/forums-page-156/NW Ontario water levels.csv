6209846,Stringbean,2018-06-18 04:28:00,279,"In checking the charts issued by the LWCB, you can readily see that the entire area has low water levels. Here is where the lack of rainfall comes into play. It seems as if this year's storm track is taking the storms further south into NE Minnesota and NW Wisconsin."
6210040,packpro,2018-06-18 11:03:00,695,Just got back from fishing the Wabigoon river last week water levels were down 2ft from normal and heading lower. Plenty of new obstructions just below the surface.
6210172,ILScott,2018-06-18 15:15:00,139,Just got back from Wine Lake which is by Wabaskang Lake and the lake is about 2 foot down. Tough to get in some of the other lakes on the system. Many props got chewed up.
6210240,ia bhtr,2018-06-18 17:41:00,212,English River is down at least that same 2 ft down stream from Ear Falls where we were last week
6211022,bigwalleye1,2018-06-20 08:58:00,2632,"Just got back from Lac Seul, down 3-3.5 ft vertically from normal."
6211246,dakota eye,2018-06-20 14:38:00,69,How was the fishing?
6211462,bigwalleye1,2018-06-21 05:26:00,2632,"Difficult. Water temps on Lac Seul were 69-70, which is 15 degrees warmer than normal. The fish don't know where they're supposed to be. Very scattered. We spent a lot of time searching, and never did find a spot where we could catch active fish with any regularity. This was the toughest June trip to LS I've ever had."
6211520,rockape,2018-06-21 07:55:00,215,"I just got back yesterday from Lac Seul's SE area. Water is down 18-24 inches. Water temp where I was fishing was 70-75 degrees. As Bigwalleye1 said, it is 15 degrees warmer than usual. We go from a later than normal ice out to boiling water in a few weeks. The walleyes are likely mega confused. We actually caught our biggest walleyes fishing for musky and pike. Both were 25 inchers. The fish are heading for deeper water, and hitting bucktails and big spinner baits! The average size walleye was good, and you can still catch plenty of them. Go to your normal honey holes, and then move out to deeper water from those."
