There are several that seem to have excellent reviews for their accommodations, boats, meals, etc. but I have been wondering about their mid-August walleye fishing. I have read that the constant fluctuating water level ruins the August walleye bite there. Has anyone here had any good experiences with this area in August? Is the falling water level on the French a normal thing every August?"

I believe it was a June trip and we were confronted with a four foot drop in the rivers level. It definitely made the fishing a challenge. In general, whenever I've been an area that has experienced an unnatural drawdown it ruined the fishing. Could be if you had the time to find new fish locations you would be successful. That's hard to do on a one week getaway. What saved our trip on the French was that we were very close to the area that controlled the drawdown. The waters that were below the dam were loaded with walleye. I've grown to appreciate water systems that are at a natural level unaffected by man. Your coming a long way to fish Canada. August can be a tough month for walleye unless your get into a good productive fishery."

I was hoping that I could find someone to say something positive about walleye fishing there in August but not so far. I even sent a contact to one of the lodges on the French asking about the August draw downs but so far they have not responded. It is a shame because some of the lodges in that area look very inviting."
