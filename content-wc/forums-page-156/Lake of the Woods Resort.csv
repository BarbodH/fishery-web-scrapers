6209258,Bergy,2018-06-16 08:21:00,83,Looking for a Drive to Resort on Lake of the Woods for a family trip with my wife and kids. Want to be as close as possible to good Walleye fishing as possible. Have a clean resort with protected docks. A swimming area would be a bonus. This would be for July 2019. Suggestions appreciated.
6209270,ElectricSlide19,2018-06-16 08:46:00,147,"May I suggest drive to with a little bit of boating? Obabikon Lake Lodge gets very high praise here, along with many of the resorts in the Morson area (Red wing Lodge, Mylies Place, Tamarack Island Lodge). Of those, Obabikon and Tamarack require a little bit of boating to get to the lodge but are awesome locations. I would also like to suggest Ash Rapids Lodge. Again a little bit of boating out of Kenora, but they provide great access to Shoal Lake, a swimming dock, great restaurant, and great walleye and muskie opportunities. Plus at Ash Rapids you might even get to meet a professional athlete! Another option that does not involve a resort would be booking a cabin through Air BnB. It is becoming a popular way to book a location, and if only doing a housekeeping plan the prices are very competitive. In fact I think there is a private cabin In Sabaskong Bay in the classifieds here on Walleye Central that rents it out to people. Might also be worth looking into."
6209310,Obabikon,2018-06-16 09:59:00,2370,If you're strictly looking for a drive in lodge... Mylie's Place would be difficult to beat. Certainly has everything you're looking for. If you're looking for an American plan and wouldn't mind a boat-in... we'd love you to consider us www.obabikon.com
6209338,The tank,2018-06-16 11:45:00,340,I've fished LOW for a few years now. I've stayed at a couple drive too and a couple boat in's. I will boat in for now on. I would suggest rex toltons milesbay camp or grassy narrows. I have not stayed at obabikons yet but it's in the near future.
6209870,forgop,2018-06-18 06:15:00,880,"I just spent 6 days at Obabikon and it's a great location between Miles Bay and Obabikon Lake. Has about everything you need for a comfortable stay. Hope to return next year and take a real shot at a muslie, although I did manage to catch about a 24"" baby while trolling for pike. I'll be sure to go later in the year to steer clear of the mayfly hatch. Sent from my Pixel 2 XL using Tapatalk"
6209886,Shorelunch,2018-06-18 06:57:00,554,Obabikon would definitely be my first choice. Can't beat the location to boot. I'd also maybe look at Tamarack - another boat in. Mylies and Buena Vista would be my two choices for on the main land. Can't go wrong with any of them.
6209892,nicko,2018-06-18 07:09:00,508,"I'd look hard at Obabikon for a boat out. Less people = better fishing. In general, always had better luck being away from the crowd. While I have not been to Obabikon I am heading out soon for my 10th boat in. Specifically the boat in is a very cool experience for the family and he runs a top notch lodge from the commentary on this board. As for the Mayfly's, we actually like em. Throw away the jigs when they hatch and pull bouncer with crawlers and spinners in gold and copper. Works like a charm. Find the mud, find the fish... If its a first time trip, it will be a memory making experience for everyone. Good luck. N"
6209980,MN_Moose,2018-06-18 09:11:00,964,Smith Camps near Kenora would be a good option. https://www.smithcamps.com/
6210038,muskyman73,2018-06-18 11:01:00,401,Obabikon here we come !!! 12 days and counting !!!!
6210472,eyeman_1,2018-06-19 07:11:00,690,"I'm sure Obabikon would be a great choice. I have heard nothing but good things about them. I have not been there, so cannot comment first hand. If you are looking for drive to / boat in, I have been to Wiley Point and it has never disappointed. Great food, lodging and the fishing is top notch. I took the wife there for our honeymoon in 2000 and she has been back three more times. I think if you are looking for a care free, great place for the family and wonderful fishing close to the lodge this would fit the bill as well."
