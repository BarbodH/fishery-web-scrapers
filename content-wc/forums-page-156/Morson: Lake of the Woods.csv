6207068,ElectricSlide19,2018-06-10 17:16:00,147,Awesome. What are you getting for water temps now sir?
6207154,Obabikon,2018-06-10 21:44:00,2370,"Depends on the bay, and time of day... seeing mid to low 60's consistently though."
6211144,ElectricSlide19,2018-06-20 11:33:00,147,Any recent reports for the area from anyone? Eyes moved out to the humps yet? TIA Headed up Friday.
6211150,Obabikon,2018-06-20 11:44:00,2370,"Walleyes have moved shallower. Huge mayfly hatch last week, but hopefully we're past that now. They've been fishing normal June patterns for the past couple days."
6211170,forgop,2018-06-20 11:57:00,880,They're now probably sitting on all the humps I tried last week with little success. LOL
6211180,Obabikon,2018-06-20 12:04:00,2370,They are that really sucks. Wish I was better at predicting/understanding the bite.
6211332,muskyman73,2018-06-20 18:25:00,401,This will make a great rattle trap bite
6198130,Obabikon,2018-05-22 05:41:00,2370,"This weekend was actually some pretty good fishing. It was slow because of the cold Saturday morning, but when the sun came out, the walleye started biting. Lots of 20-25"" fish being caught in 15' of water off of rock points. Had a 29.5"" in walleye caught yesterday. Guides have been finding some small mouth moving in on beaches. Crappie are biting off the dock, and I've heard many of the other spring areas are producing them. Northern pikes are in the backs of bays, yesterday was slower for them... but it was probably too sunny. I fished for an hour or so with my kids for lunch yesterday, and we didn't have any problems catching something to eat. I did see water temps in the low 60's."
6198136,That Minnesota guy,2018-05-22 05:46:00,8293,Thanks for the report!
6198226,ElectricSlide19,2018-05-22 08:16:00,147,"Thanks for the report! Excited to be there in a month! Low 60 water temps! Dang. That water sure warmed up fast! Obabikon, would you say that with the normal winter and ice out, with quicker thaw that the mayfly hatch is on schedule for last week of June/early July? Thanks again"
6198238,Obabikon,2018-05-22 08:29:00,2370,"The mayfly hatch probably has more to do with June temps than it does winter/ice conditions. With that said, I would say we are a little behind normal, but not much. I'm sure end of June/late July mayflies will happen in our area. However, that time frame will vary drastically from area to area due to water temps."
6199174,Obabikon,2018-05-23 18:20:00,2370,"Holy cow it was unbelievably hot today (I saw 93 in the shade)... but the fish loved it. Everyone caught a bunch of fish. Easily the best day of our short season. Big walleyes, and lots of numbers... big pike, a couple of muskies (on accident), crappie were biting.... Storms are rolling in tonight, hopefully that gets rid of the fire ban."
6201060,Obabikon,2018-05-28 16:14:00,2370,The walleyes have moved to humps at this point. Catching some really nice fish consistently. Crappie are biting. Pike are going crazy in the shallows.... man fishing has been fun the past few days!
6201212,martinbns,2018-05-28 20:00:00,1520,"We were out Sunday, caught about 10 eater Walleye in a few hours, most in 12-16 feet. My wife had one 15+ on the line in 5 feet of water before it flopped off. We fished some bays and caught lots of mid sized pike and probably 20 smaller SM Bass casting jerk baits."
6201906,ElectricSlide19,2018-05-30 08:51:00,147,Thanks for the reports! Can't wait to get up there!
6206434,forgop,2018-06-09 06:11:00,880,Any recent updates? Leave Monday morning. Thanks!
6206490,Obabikon,2018-06-09 08:05:00,2370,"There's been a pretty good evening walleye bite the last few days. More boulder points and channels than reefs... but it seems nicer fish are being caught on the humps. It isn't fast and furious, but no one is going hungry either. Catching some fish at every depth... 6' all the way to 30'. I would say the nicer ones are 12'-18' Pike are hit and miss... some days are crazy, and some days are flower... depends on cloud cover. Normal locations... weed beds. Crappie fishing dropped off after the cold snap last weekend, but they'll be moving back in with the stable weather."
