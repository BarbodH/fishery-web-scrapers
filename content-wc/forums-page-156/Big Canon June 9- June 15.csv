Fishing gets better every year, and every year provides a unique experience. We had six quests in camp this year. We were greeted by a brand new fleet of Yamaha 25 HP outboards. I can't believe how long the others ran flawlessly. We had 6 days of fishing. Four of the days were on the portage lakes. Water temps were 69F in shallow areas and bays. On the deeper lakes it was 62F. Water levels down about 2 feet from normal. Fantastic weather for us. Only 5 minutes of rain one day at the end of the day. Mid 70's for a high. High 50's for a low. Perfect breeze for a walleye chop every day. We jack hammered walleye every day. Plenty for two shore lunches and everyone took home a full ticket. Caught 100 one day (2 men) Next day we took fewer minnows and caught 20 in minutes to use up the last 12 minnows. So much fun when it turns on like that. Lake Trout- we had two guys who never fished for them before, Came back with a full ticket after 2 hours They were trolling up high. The week before a 26# and 33# lake trout were caught with the same method. The bass just started to move on the beds as we left. The new guys from Georgia had a blast every night after dinner. 15- 20 fish each night on rock structure, weeds, and downed timber. One guy caught 6 on six consecutive casts. We caught 3 musky's while fishing for the bass. One on top water. That was crazy fun. The coloration is beautiful. As they get bigger, this is going to become a great musky lake. Best part of the trip is that we rarely target Northern Pike. This year we caught 12 between 33""-40"". All caught while fishing for walleye with 1/4 oz jig/minnow. No leaders and no bite offs. A few didn't fit in the nets. All the Pike-Musky-Bass were revived and released. Those pike fights in the middle of a walleye day really kicks up the adrenalin. Hope everyone has a great trip."

6210816,packpro,2018-06-19 20:00:00,695,No extra charge for the portages. Two are very easy: Segise lake is less than. 1/4 mile. 3 boats there. Walleye/pike/smallmouth Francile is 200 yards and 5 minutes from camp. Large Muskies and large smallmouth catch and release lake Howard is a double portage very difficult. Includes pulling a boat ovr a beaver dam. Walleye numbers and large pike. No name and little no name are hard portages to musky only lakes. Beaver dams and paddling plus carrying the 6 hp motor. We are not Musky guys but later in the year a few groups will do it. Not unusual to catch 10-15 muskies as that is all those lakes hold except for the perch forage. 28 in camp including the family that started Galyans Sporting Goods. They have been going to the area for over 60 years. Started in tents and hand cut the trails to the lake. Wonderful to learn the history of the area. There were 28 in camp. Not really that many. There are 12 boats on the main lake and another 10 on the river system. The main lake is wide and 7 miles long with lots of bays. The river is 17 miles long. With the groups all fishing different bodies of water it is rare to see another boat. Also fun to compare notes at the end of the day. We do the American plan. Breakfast and dinner. For lunch they will give you a shore lunch box filled with everything you need or pack you a sandwich. They have one housekeeping cabin available. Great variety walleye/pike/smallmouth/musky/lake trout/perch. Numbers and a chance for a trophy.

I never knew there were Lake Trout or Musky. He always said the fishing there at BC was the best he ever saw in all the years going to Canada, great to see you guys did well."
6210846,packpro,2018-06-19 21:28:00,695,"Caught all those big pike exactly where we scattered his ashes. It was the last place he fished and his last fish was a 40"" northern. Pretty emotional for all of us who knew him."
