Things have not changed that much over the last few years, and the taxes are not so bad. I just booked a rental car for a week in Phoenix. I got a discount for a midsize car, and paid $125.00. With taxes it added up to $181.00!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 44% tax and government fees!!!!!!!!!! But spring training will be worth it, and so will my walleye shore lunch!!!"

I've read that the fair market value for the Canadian dollar right now given the difference in economies is right around par or just slightly under. The government would be comfortable at less than par...around 88c-92c so a drop in the interest rates might not be out of the question and have things back to the more traditional levels by next summer. Long story short..unless you guys face some type of crisis, make your deposit payment as late as you can."

The next time your employer offers you a pay increase your response should be ""no-way, I hate inflation so I am nipping it in the bud"". Let me know how it goes. IaCraig"
