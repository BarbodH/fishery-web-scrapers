569769,Guest,2007-11-08 12:00:00,0,"Example for myself for my Canadian trip with my father....I take $10day for breakfast & snacks/breaks at work and what is left each day goes into my Canadian envelope. This has covered my trip each year. Wife pays for the vast majority of our Maui trip by a separate account that she puts $$ in each & every week. She also does the same when she goes to Las Vegas with her sister/friend. Weekend fishing trips and other trips, I take care of(mostly) with overtime at work. Curious how everyone else does it?? Similar,side jobs,???"
569771,Guest,2007-11-08 14:28:00,0,The first bill I pay every month is my Canada Account. If there isn't enough left for the rest of the bills the wife will have to get a second job. Man has to have prioritys.
569772,Guest,2007-11-08 15:02:00,0,Told my wife she needs to get a side job/belly dancer for fishing and Christmas money... never seen her sucker punch coming.
569773,Muskygary,2007-11-08 15:34:00,137,I work ten to fifteen hours of overtime a week and put this money back for my trips.

569779,Guest,2007-11-09 13:47:00,0,I make my wife work 5 hours of overtime a week. They pay triple time for overtime at the rendering works. She can really skin those cows.
569781,Nimstug,2007-11-09 21:47:00,2605,"I use the end of year bonus to pay a portion of vacation of the trip. I also have a bank made from a post office box that I throw loose change into. I call it bait bucks. It's surprising what it adds up to Being a ""professional"", I don't earn any o.t. They used to pay us a a staight hourly rate (salary divided by 2080) for o.t. but they took that away from us. :boohoo: Elmo had it right. Pay yourself first. Nimstug"

569806,Guest,2007-11-14 14:43:00,0,"have reached the stage in life when having a special ""savings"" is no longer needed. I feel lucky to get here. However, one little thing I did years ago to subsidize my trip was to throw all my small change into a jar each day. Then when time for the trip, i would cash in and use that to help pay expenses. I often had over $150. sometimes I used it to buy something I might not have normally bought, but something to make the trip nicer. currently, use wife's SS check. I'm younger and still have to work. by the way, the definition of a lazy guy is, someone too lazy to help find his old lady a second job to help pay for his fishing."
