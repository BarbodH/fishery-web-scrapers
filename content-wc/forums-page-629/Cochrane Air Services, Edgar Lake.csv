565600,phishfearme,2007-05-25 14:57:00,1242,hmmmm - maybe live bait is the secret for these lakes. we never used minnows or leeches. may have to reconsider - cochrane is only a one day drive for us compared to 2 for NW ontario. be interested to hear how you do at edgar. phish
565643,Guest,2007-05-28 16:58:00,0,Phish: Thanks for the info. Did you you ever fish Kesagami when Jerry owned the place? We stopped going in the early 90s if my memory serves me correctly and I have never been back since the ownership changed. We always talk about one day heading back up there just to see how things have changed and to catch a few fish. We just don't like the idea of someone looking over your shoulder the entire trip. I would like to hear from someone that has stayed at the lodge in the past few years. I will be looking for the Edgar Lake report in the coming weeks.
565662,Guest,2007-05-29 08:05:00,0,"I have been to Kesagami lodge 4 times in the last 10 years. I never felt like anybody was looking over my shoulder. They told us before we booked that only single barbless hooks and no live bait were allowed. I was a little worried about the no live bait the first time. But I have never caught less than 30 walleye in half a day there. We fish walleye in the morning and keep our 2 under 18 for shore lunch (a few times we had trouble finding them under 18). Then we fish for pike in the afternoon. My largest there was 48.5 and I have always caught a couple over 40 in a week of fishing. My 3 favorite pike baits are single hook, so that wasn't a problem either (spinner bait, buzz bait and Johnson silver minnow. I have cought plenty of walleye while fishing the weeds for pike also."

One trip with Air Cochrane the other with that guy who owns-or-owned the camp on Partridge. I say that because he very nasty. On Kesagami we caught lots of walleye. I had banner days with 30 to 40, our biggest up to 27"". But I've seen fronts come in and have the fishing drop off to where it was hard to even get a couple. It's a great fishery equal to the Albany River for size and quantity but it has its days. My 2 cents and I love it up there, Cheers"

569927,Guest,2007-12-04 13:32:00,0,"Hi We Fished out of the Grassi Camp, about 120 miles northwest of Nakina, which was then run by Luenenbergers, which had an agreement with the Ojibwa. The Indian guide was needed due to the rapids ""if they were any bigger would have been equal to the lower Niagara River"". Numerous boats were dashed along the bank. The trips were awesome as was the company of the Ojibwa Indians. The fishing was spectacular but involved portaging. The main fishing difference was that in addition to getting pike and walleye we caught brook trout to 22"", although most were about 16"". The Indians new cold springs where the trout gathered. Unfortunately this camp is closed. Cheers"

This is our first time going in to Edgar Lake.. Does anyone have any info on the lake?? It is 1 mile from Kesagami Lodge... All info would help.. PS..We will be going in June 1st - the 9th.. thanks"

565569,phishfearme,2007-05-24 17:32:00,1242,"Hey beerman - welcome to the best Canadian fishin' board on the web! You're probably not getting a lot of replies to your request because the majority of posters here discuss the area north of International Falls/Thunder Bay. I think there's a reason for that  the totally isolated, wilderness Canadian shield lakes of NW Ontario are truly walleye central! Being a walleye fanatic and living in PA, I used to do trips to the Sudbury area as well as the Cochrane area and Quebec. I've done trips out of Cochrane to Partridge (just north of Edgar) and Kesagami Lake and also with Cochrane Air to their Lower Detour Lake - but these trips were a long time ago. I'm glad you're enjoying yourself on these James Bay lowlands lakes but we just didn't care for them - Why? No structure, flat mud bottoms and small walleye (although Kesagami produced some whoppers). Examples, Partridge Lake's deepest spot was MAYBE 10 feet and you could travel across the lake at a constant 4-5 feet (I would imagine that Edgar would be similar) - and at Kesagami, we never sounded anything deeper than 8ft  the vast majority being 5-6ft and flat. Detour was not really a lake - just a mud flat with a river running thru it - without the river there just weren't many places to fish. And in all these lakes (except Kesagami), an 18-19 inch walleye is big and they're few and far between. I'm not bad-mouthing this area  and it sounds like your experience is different - it's just not what we wanted and for almost 15 years now we've been going to NW Ontario (a two day drive) and the totally private Canadian shield lakes that are common there. After fishing north-eastern Ontario extensively and NW Ontario for the last 15 years or so - I have to say that NW is much better. (Example, I'm flying into a lake this July that is about 15 miles long, two major rivers flowing in, two portage lakes and more structure than you can imagine almost all of which holds jumbo walleyes and we're the only cabin in the area - no roads anywhere near (during our last year at a lake near Biscotasing in NE Ontario, two roads were driven into the lake (Ramsey Lake) and there were water skiers!! We've not been back since.) NW Ontario is just worth the extra day of driving - at least to us.) Anyway, best of luck to you at Edgar Lake and please make sure you post a trip report. Ask the outfitter for the name of people who are there now and returning in time for you to contact them  always a good ploy. phish"
565577,Guest,2007-05-24 19:47:00,0,"I have never fished Edgar Lake before, but I have fished Kesagami multiple times. From what I understand Edgar Lake is pretty much the same as Kesagami without the first class accomodations. The last time I fished there was in 1992 and it would not surprise me if a lot of things have changed. I believe the same people who own Kesagami also own Edgar Lake. We stopped going when Jerry and Valraina sold the place, the new owners decided to enforce a lot of strict fishing policies that sort of took some of the fun out of fishing (only barbless hooks and your tackle is subject to inspection by the camp staff, no nets, can't take home any fish, etc...). I am all for protecting the fishery and I release everything except what I can eat, but I don't like being told what to do when I am on vacation. Not sure it is still like this or if they even own Edgar Lake. Regardless, the area still has a huge population of walleye and the chance of catching a 45""+ pike is much better than anywhere else I know of."
565586,Guest,2007-05-25 06:08:00,0,"THanks for the replies.. Well, we have caught alot of 7-8 pound walleye in these lakes. Last year, my uncle landed a 13 pound wopper in yesterday lake. The owners of kesagami bought all the outpost camps, which include edgar lake. They say edgar is 6-8 mile lake, 40 foot is the deepest, but averages 10-14 feet in depth.. I am really excited to fly into edgar, as its right besides kesagami.."
565594,phishfearme,2007-05-25 10:38:00,1242,"MTP - i hear you about how kesagami has changed. not only are there all kinds of restrictions but you must use a guide also. what follows is a report i wrote to a friend after our trip to partridge lake that has a land use permit for a boat cache on kesagami. you may find it interesting. - phish so - some observations: there was a constant stream of freighter canoes from the kesagami lodge hitting the same spots over and over again. these spots are marked with bouys and are usually rock bars or other structure/cover. one of our guys likened it to a shotgun start in golf where a large group starts at different holes at the same time and after some time moves to the next hole. it seems like they were all concentrating on pike and catching none - probably for the visibilty reason i mentioned earlier. we were surprised to see how flat, featureless and shallow this lake was. sometimes we'd stumble over a school of walleye - usually mixed with a few pike - and wonder why they were there - 3-4 ft., flat bottom and minimal if any weeds. they weren't there long though as returning to these spots were fruitless. i guess the fish have to be somewhere!"
565595,phishfearme,2007-05-25 10:45:00,1242,"beerman - you not only beer man but you're also THE man!! hauling in a number of 27-28inch walleye (7-8 pounds according to the MNR ""weigh you fish with a ruler"" guide) from this area is excellent!! we never came close to this with the exception of a 27incher we got in kesagami. and a 13 pounder!! WOW - that deserves a write-up in major fishing mags - musta been a 34-35incher. with this kind of results, stick with these lakes!! let us know how you do at edgar lake. phish"
565596,Guest,2007-05-25 11:47:00,0,"I will definetly have a report when i get back. All the lakes have new rules and regs. You are not aloud to bring any fish outta the bush at all. It has helped the growth and quantities you catch. We were fishing twopeak lake, my other uncle has a walleye on his wall, thats 31 inches.. This was when you were alowed to bring fish out.. The biggest i got was about 8 pounds on unknown lake.. Last year we went through 120 dozen minnows, 2 lbs of leeches and a flat of crawlers.. We used every minnow up, plus the salted ones we took. I bet I caught 800 walleye myself.. RoadRunner Jigs are the key. We make our own now.... peace"
565597,Guest,2007-05-25 11:49:00,0,"Oh yea, pike are everywhere. I have caught 5, 20 lbers so far.. Last year, it was top water.. Freekin blast.."
