569875,Guest,2007-11-27 10:25:00,0,Wasn't Walleye fishing but I took my 10 year old Grandson to the Red River at Selkirk Manitoba to do some Cat fishing. We fished for three days and we must have caught at least 150 catfish over 20 lbs. It was the most unbelievable fishing I have ever seen. My Grandson's arms ached every night and he was exhausted. We hadn't even left Selkirk on the way home and he wanted to know if we can come back next year. If God is willing and the creek don't rise we will be back.

Had probably 10% of them in the 27""/28"" range. It was SW wind and we were able to find fish on a wind blown series of islands with the proper wind exposure and in 8 to 15 feet of water on sand and gravel. Area was loaded with bait fish on the finder........AWESOME DAY."

569818,Guest,2007-11-15 07:54:00,0,"Walleye fished on the Red River (Selkirk) for three days the first week of October 2007. The second day the two of us caught 4 Walleye over 10 lbs a piece with the biggest being 33"" and 13-4 in weight."
569821,freespoolin,2007-11-15 09:07:00,472,"October 27/07 on Traverse Bay (L. Winnipeg). Two of us caught 66 walleye in the 18""-22"" range. No big ones, in fact we have not caught one fish over 25"" in the 300+ walleyes we have caught at Pine Falls this Fall. Pine Falls has been producing huge numbers of walleye, no big ones that I've heard about but the Red River has been yielding masters. And all these greenbacks are coming from L. Winnipeg. Go figure!"

We left camp in the morning in a nice mild walleye chop waves. the wind blew through our hair and an occasional splash of cool water in our faces. At noon we went on shore for grilled hambergers, hot baked beans and a cold beer. We had a great time together on the lake that day. I can't say if I even remember if we chaught any nice walleye. It was one of the best fishing days I ever had."

But I do remember untangleing lines and retying her jigs and going to shore for bathroom breaks and her asking me ""(What kind of bird is that,it's very pretty?). Most of all I remember the day she caught a 32"" Walleye...she has never let me forget it."
569845,Matches,2007-11-20 18:47:00,236,"It was early October on Lake of the Woods. We only needed one more walleye for our limit. I changed the color of my jig. Put a fresh minnow on. Dropped in about 22 feet of water. Then BAM, my line went tight. I struggled for about 8 minutes but finally got it in the boat. No, I did not release it, I decided to keep it. I donated it to Buena Vista Resort and I am sure it is hanging proudly right now on the wall of their boat house Yes, I caught... a really nice landing net. It was a good day!"
569853,2746,2007-11-21 16:13:00,3206,"Three trips to Canada this year but the one in August to Gullrock with three of my friends who had not fished before was the best. With four of us fishing out of my 18' boat and three being newbies we had our share of %#&!'s but we also had a couple of 150 fish days and lots of 23-27"" walleyes. The trip ranks right up there with taking my grandsons for the first time. I just love to see people catch walleye for the first time....experience a shore lunch for the first time....learn to release a big walleye and watch it swim away.....watch the Eagles flying...learning how to clean their own fish....etc. It was the best trip of the year! They are already planning for next year so I may have created a monster."
569869,Guest,2007-11-26 10:15:00,0,Every day I have spent and will spend on Lac Seul is awesome. Plenty of great fishing and all of it done with my family and good friends. Doesen't get any better than that.
569872,rather-be-fishin,2007-11-26 20:32:00,429,"Awesome, Ditto to your comment!!!! Every day that I have fished on Lac Seul is my ""Best Walleye Day"" .....I know that sounds sappy, but it is true! Especially, when my son, who was new to fishing walleye caught TWO 27 1/2"" + walleye within 15 minutes of dropping his line in the water on our first day on the lake!!! His comment at the time was: ""Fish really are bigger in Canada""!!! He thought that the rest of the week was going to be much of the same, not knowing that he may never catch another walleye that big!!! 8 MONTHS AND COUNTING DOWN TO 2008 TRIP TO LAC SEUL!!! :cheers:"
