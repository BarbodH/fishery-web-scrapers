569947,Guest,2007-12-07 14:57:00,0,"If you're properly connected, about $1.50-$3.00/dozen depending on size, larger being more. If you're just buying a couple dozen for a day or two, it's more like $3-$5/dozen. Note these are summer ranges...large minnows can be particularly expensive in the winter, sometimes as much as $0.75 or even $1 for a single sucker minnow. NWO Fishing Bum"
