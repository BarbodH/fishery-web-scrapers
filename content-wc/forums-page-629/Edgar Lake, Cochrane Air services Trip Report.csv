566282,Guest,2007-06-15 11:12:00,0,"Hey all, just wanted to give you a report from my annual fly in fishing trip with cochrane air services.. We left thursday, may 31, drove to north bay, and got a hotel at The Inn By The Bay. We hung out on the balcony and drank beer all night. Lots of fun.. Friday, June 1st we woke up at 6 AM, for our final 5 hours to get to cochrane, ontario. Stopped along the way for 2 lbs of leeches and a flat of crawlers, and food... Arrived at cochrane around 1 pm. Checked in at the Best Westen, and met Ittalo from canadian sportsfishhing. He was flying out to Kesagami on friday. We talked, very nice person... After lunch, went to see mark and fill out the the paper work, pay for the trip, etc.. Noticed that they had borrowed Hearst Outfitters Turbo Outter, due to the fact that cochrane could not fly for 3 days and people were still in the bush.. Mark said we would be going in the outter at 8:00 am saturday morning.. Awesome!! And thank god for that huge plane as we broke the record for going overweight..1400 lbs over.. LOL. Maybe it was the 25 cases of beer?? Went to dinner, and a small bar in cochrane, then to bed early.. Up saturday at 6:00 am to get flown into edgar lake.. Loaded the outter, and off we went. I will tell you one thing, that plane was freekin awesome!! Landed on Edgar around 9:30 am, unloaded and got camp situated, and then we were off to do some fishing! Second cast, my cousin lands a 25 inch walleye, right at the cabin. It was on.. We caught walleye every where we fished..We did not catched a walleye under 18 inches all week..The weather was warm the first day, then it rained on sunday. I knew a front was comming, and boy, did it.. Monday it snowed, and was 33 degree f....... Monday night was 26 f... But the fish didn,t stop hitting... It warmed up and then friday hit us.. WOW..We were the whole way up the northern end of the lake, when it started to lightning and thunder.. We went into shore to wait it out.. While on shore, I found an old trapppers cabin.Pretty neat.. After an hour, it looked clear, and we left for the cabin. While motoring to the cabin, the winds picked up bad, and I mean bad... Next thing it was sleet and hail, and some bad winds... It was scary, and cold.. And the sleet really hurt the face.. But we made it.. All I can say is we experienced every kind of weather canada could throw our way.. It was awesome! No bugs, lots of fish.. I will post more later, and some pictures!! I love the great north.. Till next year.. PS..Fish caught 1800 walleye, 2 24 lb. pike, and a ton of white fish!!! Only 2 cans of beer left over, ate fish everyday. Cabin, boats , motors, etc all top notch!! Even had a Sauna on the lake.."

566326,Guest,2007-06-15 16:06:00,0,Thanks for the report. How many in your group?
566327,JackSalmon,2007-06-15 16:26:00,169,"That sounds like a great trip! I head north on Thursday. I was just curious, how do you catch the whitefish?"
566341,phishfearme,2007-06-17 06:33:00,1242,"beerman - glad you had a good ""catching"" trip in spite of the weather. looking forward to you more detailed report. phish"
566366,Guest,2007-06-18 09:12:00,0,Whitefish hit minnows and crawlers.. They fight like ####..
566373,JackSalmon,2007-06-18 12:00:00,169,"My son and I are going to be fishing Ogoki Reservoir starting Saturday, and I have noticed there are whitefish in that lake --- sounds like maybe you will catch them incidental to catching walleye? No special methods needed? Thanks!"
566391,phishfearme,2007-06-18 18:32:00,1242,"jack - i think there's a number of different types of whitefish or fish similar. we've been to the area of ontario where beerman was and also caught numerous large ""whitefish"" while throwing twister jigs, spoons and other lures - up to 20inches and a ball to fight as these ""whitefish"" are taller and flatter than the ones i've seen but only rarely caught in NW ontario (they're typically netted in the fall and EXCELLENT smoked). maybe someone on this board knows what the difference is or if i'm off base. i think the whitefish we see more than catch in NW ontario feed much more on small, bottom animals and the ones in the lowlands of NE ontario and quebec are much more into eating other fish. i believe their mouths are totally different also. anybody know for sure? phish"
569913,Guest,2007-11-30 15:49:00,0,"Hi We're going to Edger the same week 2008. As for whitefish there's only one kind and their great eating. I've seen them almost up to 5 pounds, although usually 1 or 2 is more common. Can be tough to hook however, softlips. Glad to hear you did so well. I've always done great up north of Cochrane, but never caught that many. Wouldn't mind talking with you since this will be are 1st trip to Edgar? Cheers Jim"
