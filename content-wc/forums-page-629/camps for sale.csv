569815,Minnow Man,2007-11-14 21:43:00,85,"Hey Finance Man, you need to switch to decaf coffee, you are wound up too tight. We have been Tourist Resort owners for 15 years. You have no idea what a sh*t job is, try working in the mines for 25 years & because of working shift work, having your first Christmas off when your daughter is already 14 years old. The mines run 24/7 365 days a year. You breath in ore dust & other chemicals all day long. You think that's a better lifestyle. I had enough of eating dust all day & bought a tourist camp & have never looked back. It was the best decision of my life, both my wife & I enjoy the life style it offers. working in an unpolluted environment, the scenery, wildlife & great people all make it worth while. We have had the opportunity to meet some of the finest people in the country. Many have become close friends. I resent our guests being referred to as perpetual 2 year old kids. It must be your attitude. Our guests are on vacation, they arrive excited & in good humor, they are looking for a week of fishing & relaxing with family/friends & just having some fun. It doesn't get any better than that. Sure there is work to go along with being a resort owner & things do break down, but they get fixed & we move on. I don't think there is a business out there that doesn't have government regulations that must be followed, it's simple, comply with the rules & regulations and move forward. Most resorts are not going broke, people are still coming & enjoying what the Canadian North has to offer. We do make time to go fishing & enjoy the lake. Now it's my turn to have 7 months vacation,( only had 5 weeks after working 25 years mining). On Friday we'll be leaving for our winter home in Florida & returning in April. We do enjoy the lifestyle. Bill & Maureen Golden Hook Camp"

569819,Guest,2007-11-15 08:24:00,0,"Bill, take it easy on the guy. The only problem I see with your post is you've been trying to sell your camp for years I know I looked at it. Why, if it's such a great life sytle, and why have almost all the camps on Gullrock sold in last couple years. Maybe making to much money eh. As far as babysitting your guest, it's a known fact in Red Lake that you guys run your camp with a iron fist. Oh by the way I'm proud that I work at the gold mine and I make the money in Red Lake and I spend it here, not in Florida!"
569822,Minnow Man,2007-11-15 09:36:00,85,"Hello Fishminer How many boats & motors have you bought lately? We have bought over 30 locally, have built or remodeled 8 new cottages, plus a new lodge all materials bought locally, my service work is done locally, we hire 8 part time staff & one full time employee, so don't give me sh*t about spending my money in Florida. I am just putting some of my earned dollars back where they came from, in the U.S.A. Sorry Fishminer camp is not for sale."

We have always had an amazing time with Grant and Bev. Truly two of the finest people I have ever met. It was disheartening to see in this years Christmas letter that they had sold the camp. They will truly be missed. They always went above and beyond to make sure we had a great experience and have given me memories that I will cherish always. They will always be considered part of my ""Canadian family"". The situation for camp owners is probably more difficult now. The sinking U.S. dollar and climbing gas prices have put the pinch on profits. I would assume fewer people are traveling up north to fish than before. But those of us who really cherish it will always find a way. I moved to Norway (yes the country) 6 years ago and still make it back for the annual Canada trip. Yes, I miss a year now and then, but I always plan on going. I try and save money the entire year by putting my extra change in a jar, not buying the ""latest and greatest"" stuff and putting in a couple of extra hours at work now and then. I wholeheartedly disagree with ""Finance man"" in that the only people who will travel to Canada are rich men and fools. I do not make a lot of money, but I do OK. Living in Europe I could travel to many places that a lot of people only dream about, and it would be cheaper than going to Canada, but I choose Canada. Why? The experience; the friends and good times; and yes, the chance to hook a trophy. The trip to Canada is not all about fishing though, it is only a small part of it. It is about friends, tradition and good times. If you do the math, you will find that a trip to Canada is a lot cheaper than many other crappier, more touristy places you can go. But it is an experience you will always remember. So the next time you go up there. Respect the camp owner, they don´t have to do this, especially now when times are a little tougher. And maybe, if next time we go, we take a new fisherman along and there will be fewer camps for sale. Yes, I realize that was sappy, but it was well intended.

Rock on to Bill & Maureen's feedback on the subject!!! After all their years in the business, I respect their knowledge. If you have heart, you can run any business. As for 50% down, yes, that's what a bank wants down. No different in the states if you buy a bar, restaurant, cafe, diner, etc. They are risky. As for a Canadian fishing trip being too expensive...NOT...$405.00 per person including a cabin, boat, motor, gas...Where can you go cheaper and have 5700 acres of water along with 8 other lakes??? Also, Bill & Maureen, thank you for spending your off-season in the states and putting some of your money back here!!!"

I challenge you to tell me where you can get a fully furnished cabin, 16' boat and a 20 horse motor, all your marine gas for $405.00 per person and have 5700 acres of clear water and 8 stained water lakes accessible by boat and portage? Yes the dollar is weak at this time, but, through the history of finance the dollar changes but people still go on vacations and going to Canada isnt a rich man's vacation. It's about how you spend your dollar. Are you an Ex-camp owner who couldn't make it?"

There are a lot of people who continue to go fishing in Canada because they love it and it is still a good value. My wife and I go for a week and catch all the fish we want to and the total cost for the week from our front door back to our front door is $2400. When I price other vacations for two of us for a week I find that Canada is very reasonable. To many of us have become use to going to Canada on what we felt was a reasonablely inexpensive cost. In fact the trip I go on every year with 3 other guys use to cost us about $400 per man in the ninetys. It know costs about $700 per man. Still a good value in todays market. Everything I buy today costs more and I think that part of the problem is that wages and income have not increased at the same rate that rising costs have. Fisherman that are in dead end jobs that don't have opportunity to increase their income are hurting during rising prices. To many of us fisherman have blue collar jobs and are caught in the middle of inflation. Thank God that i started my own business 15 years ago andhave done well."
569801,Guest,2007-11-14 09:13:00,0,I've spoken to two former camp owners who basically told me the same thing. They made a living running the camp but the real profit came when they sold. The apreciation in the real estate value due to the limited availability is when they made their money. Much like farming in that you work long hours and survive but the real money comes when you sell out to a developer. The rest of your info was good. I liken it to owning rental property. If your handy and can maintain them yourself you do alright but if you need to call a plumber everytime there is a leaky faucet your not going to make it. Regarding the time in running a camp. One of those owners told me if you like fishing then buying a camp is the worst thing you can do as he never had time to enjoy it when he owned the camp while the other fished everyday with the guests. I think it's how you manage your time.

569810,Guest,2007-11-14 15:27:00,0,"Once again, I said I was going to stay away from topics like this, but have a hard time reading them, and not coming to some type of defense. As a ""retirement"" job, it would be absolutely crazy to buy a camp. You will make no money, you'll work harder than previous jobs, and you won't have the time to enjoy where you are. As a life long job, it makes more sense. The job itself is difficult, but... every year you make your mortage payment, you are aquiring an asset. Almost all your loans will run 10-20 years... so, a three year turn around isn't going to help a lot. Another point is that buying a ""fixer upper"" doesn't work. Camps are bought and sold according to their gross income. Making it look real nice doesn't up the value as much as filling the place. The value of lake front property, is going to continue to increase. Of course, paying 1mil on a resort that will gross 200k a year, isn't going to work. So, you have to shop around for the ""deals"". As a child raised on an island resort, it's an amazing place to have a family. How many other jobs are there where you can spend ALL DAY with BOTH your parents. Ontop of that, you live on a beautiful lake, and see things other people can't even imagine. My real point is, camp ownership isn't a ""career"", it's a lifestyle. It's definately not the life for everyone, and I recommend anyone interested think long and hard about it. To say it's not worth it, is a matter of opinion. However, camp owners should get joy out of their guests' enjoyment..."

569642,Guest,2007-10-25 07:46:00,0,"After scanning some of the resort real estate websites there seems to be a lot more resorts for sale than normal. I'm thinking that this is partly because of the low Amercian dollar, high cost of gas and decline in Amercians going to Canada for a variety of other reasons. Based on my assumption it would be a good time to be very careful about investing in a Resort. I would make sure that the books you are viewing are accurate and I would want to talk to a lot of the Resorts past customers in order to get their opinion about the Resort and if they intend on continuing to come to it. I know of several people who purchased Resorts during better financial times and had to let it go back after several years. it is a tough business and getting tougher."

I just hope the new owners keep it as nice as it's been since the current owners have been running it. I've been staying there since the late 70's and that won't change as long as new owners keep up the facilities."

569795,Guest,2007-11-13 20:53:00,0,"I agree with you 120%. If you have a 500,000 0f your own money, a moron can invest it in mutual funds and get a measily 12 -13% return which means 75,000 in interest WITHOUT being a plumber, gas and diesel mechanic, salesman, marketer, electrician, motor mechanic, roofer, cook, welder, accountant, carpenter, banker, policeman and a ton of other jobs you will work your asz off. Why the heck would you borrow another 500,000 to add to your 500,000 for such a crap return while working you butt off assuming you you got ALL AROUND handyman skills and don't have to pay someone else to do skills you can't handle!!! Is this what some folks call retirement and fun. I have a buddy who can't pound a nail, change a tire and has the handyman skills of Oprah Winfrey who is thinking about buying a fishing camp with the some recent inheritance money. I really hate to stomp on anybody's dream but I sat him down and told him exactly the skills which would be required and him being a shoe store manager for 24 years he would be dead meat quickly and his money would be GONE! ` He agreed and thanked the heck out of me because he finally realized his money would be gone if he tried it. I PERSONALLY know of 6 camp owners who used to enjoy fishing. They haven't fished in years because they are too busy running the camp or too tired when they do get free time. After about 3 years, ""the fantasy dream"" isn't all that exciting as they thought it would be and it has become a thankless JOB. The main thing I have found is most camp owners thought it would be easier and less expensive. Reality is a terrible teacher. 1 has quit, 3 are ready and are ALL were disallusioned with the ""dream"". The one busted his hinny and had a gorgeous camp ALL redone and after 7 years sold it with difficulty and only got his orginal purchase price because the vast majority of potential buyers couln't come up with the down payment OR the financing OR found a better deal from another sucker who was giving away his camp at a firesale price. IT IS A BUYERS MARKET and the winner is the buyer until he figures it out in 3 years isn't so hot after all being a camp owner. Lets face it guys. Americans aren't going to EXPENSIVE Canada in the numbers they were even 20 years ago and by recent business trends it is going down every year whether you know it or like it. God knows what gas was in Northern Canada this year but it was 5.00 per gallon in summer of 2006. 2006 was the last year for me in Canada and I have found wonderful places to fish and sitesee in the good ol USA for half the price. The Canandien costs surely aren't going down in 2008 and more people won't treck to Canada. The only people who continue to go are people who have money to burn at any cost and people who are too dumb to figure it out. Another FACT IS that the vast majority of fishing camps DO NOT have the fishing quality they did of yesteryear and I don't care what camp you want to talk about. Add in reduced fish limits and nit picky Canadien red tape with heavy handed law enforcement for every simple transgression by goverment officials who have wages paid by taxpayers and then you start thinking, how much is Canada really worth? The banking people know this and that is why they demand HUGE amounts of down payment money because they know the potential risk and future market profitability plus failure ratio. Bankers didn't get to be bankers by being stupid. Simply stated: fishing in Canada will have less people doing it resulting in higher prices for the ones that do which equals more failed camps fighting for a shrinking fisherman participant base. Bottom line......the purchase of a fishing camp/resort is a pee poor investment which only results in grief and wasted hard work. But then again the road to Hades looks real nice until after you start walking the journey......then after you can't turn back the journey doesn't look so good. Running a fishing resort is like watching a perpetual 2 year old kid that will NEVER grow-up to be any older than 2 years old. You have to watch him every minute of the day because he is always getting into trouble, breaking something or putting himself in danger.......that is running a fishing resort in a nutshell. I have found most people who disagree with my fishing resort business analysis are the type of people who think because they were basketball athletic stars in high school are the ones who are going to ink an NBA contract. It just doesn't happen."
