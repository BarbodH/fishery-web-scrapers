569826,Guest,2007-11-16 05:56:00,0,For the best muskie guide in the Minaki area get a hold of JJ Ross. But get ahold of him early as he books up very fast.
569827,Guest,2007-11-16 18:37:00,0,Can you give me a phone number to contact JJ thanks Brian
569828,Guest,2007-11-16 21:04:00,0,Try Gord Smithson.He might be available. He guides in that area also. 807-224-2412

569910,IaCraig,2007-11-30 12:48:00,434,"I've used several resorts at Minaki, and I wouldn't complain about any of them. But the last 5-6 trips I've stayed with the North Star resort. (They are the gas pumps in the channel under the RR trestle.) It isn't anything fancy and they are a small operation, so if you want meals, tennis courts & sauna it won't be for you. Marcy & Mike treat us well, price is competitive, cabins are decent with most overlooking the water. They are Minaki/Kenora year round residents, and I think 3rd generation owners who have made lots of improvements since they took it over from her dad about 5 years ago."

569792,VMS,2007-11-13 11:28:00,1103,"Hi Everyone, Looking for info on this particular area. I have never been up on the winnipeg river system, and have no clue what anything is like up there in terms of fishable populations, good resorts, travel, etc. Seeing some pictures and reading some resort info has piqued my interest, but as with all brochures they supply info that is designed to bring you there, and it is not necessarily the case once you arrive. So....anyone have personal experiences of the area? I'd be looking at some walleye action too, and if memory serves me correctly, they are pretty strict on what you can bring home (no problem here...wife and I like a meal and one or two fish to bring home for another meal) I am sure time of year makes a difference, and I am guessing this would be an early august trip if we consider it. Thanks for any help you may be able to supply. Steve"
569802,Guest,2007-11-14 09:46:00,0,"Hi Steve: I have been going up to Minaki for approx. 30 years, making two trips a year. One the first week of June and the other the second to third week of August. Fishing for Walleye in Minaki has been a real pleasure and sucess. Go to www.u-tube.com and type in canadian walleye fot a search and watch some video."
569804,Guest,2007-11-14 09:59:00,0,Steve: Go to www.youtube.com not u-tube.com Look at Paradise Cove video. Then give Duane a call about the Muskies and tell him Don R from Wisconsin recommended him. Deisel
569807,Guest,2007-11-14 14:54:00,0,"We were there in mid-June for 2 weeks. The first group I was with had 4 anglers and we caught 13 muskie for the week -- biggest was 48"" with a couple 42""ers. The second week there were 6 of us and we caught 13 more -- biggest was 44"" with a couple 42""ers. I think we also got 5 40""+ northern in those 2 weeks. I've been going up there for 25+ years now, usually 2 to 2-1/2 weeks a year. The biggest muskie I've caught has been 55"". We often hook into them while we are fishing for smallmouth, so don't target them specifically. I've personally averaged at least 2 musky per week over the years at Minaki. The most musky I've caught in a week has occured in mid-August. I personally got 5 and all were over 44"". Walleye is no problem, finding eaters the past few years has not been as easy as previous years (most are usually over the slot). This year, there were plenty of walleye in all sizes, so the smaller ones are making a comeback. Yes, there is a strict size and keep limit, but it's getting like that on the entire Winnepeg river system. It hasn't bothered us, since we mainly fish for walleye, only when we get worn out from beating the banks! Chuck"
569808,Guest,2007-11-14 14:57:00,0,"I forgot, check out Sunset Point in Minaki. Ken who runs the resort is an avid musky hunter, and he'll let you know where they are at. He usually has an opening or two sometime in August, but you better start planning now, since they'll fill by the end of January. Chuck"
569813,Guest,2007-11-14 20:29:00,0,"Hi Steve, I have 2 cabins that I am trying to rent out. They are right in Minaki, not at a resort. So you are on your own, but my husband and I can always help with maps and any helpful advise on Muskie fishing. My husband fishes a two week muskie tournament for the old fishing guides in the area. So we know all the spots. The cabin has 3 bedrooms with 2 beds in each. All linen is supplied as well as all kitchen equipment. If you have any questions, feel free to e- mail us at [email protected] or Call us at 807-224-1048 Ask for Derick or Carol."
569814,Guest,2007-11-14 21:42:00,0,"ChuckE is the guy to ask about smallmouth, and really most fish. There are many others, including some who have posted who know the river well. I fish primarily smallmouth, but have caught 6 muskies in a week on tender tubes fishing smallmouth. Muskies are everywhere in the system. We stay at Birch Island Resort each year. Not inexpensive, but very nice. Good luck. I do not believe you will be disappointed. Don"
569820,Guest,2007-11-15 08:24:00,0,I've been fishing up there for 30 years and the Musky fishing is better than it has ever been. There are some hogs in that system.
569823,Guest,2007-11-15 11:15:00,0,"My brother and his friends were at the cottage for a week of musky in Minaki Nov 5 - 12. They did put in long days, but they also netted 2 fish over 50""."
569824,Guest,2007-11-15 11:46:00,0,"Early aug is a nice time to go. To start it's generaly the end of the bug season. The water is warm and there are some awsome beaches out on Big sand Walleyes are in there summer haunts, and there are too many to choose from in a weeks fishing. I don't fish for smallies unless I have kids in the boat and looking for action. So I don't have much to say about them other then there is a real heathy population. And of course there are lots of musky's. You do have to put your time in fishing for them, and generaly the big big girls and larger numbers come in late oct. But they are there as well in aug. As far as a place to stay, do your homework. I haven't stayed at any, but have talked to a lot of people who have, and have heard good and bad. Mostly good about all."
