569829,Guest,2007-11-18 05:51:00,0,"I was at the post office yesterday and they said you will need a passport to reenter by land into the US starting december 31, 2007. Does anybody no this for sure? Scott"
569831,Guest,2007-11-18 10:08:00,0,"Below is what I cut/pasted from their website. We actually applied for ours this past Thursday and they said it would take 3-4 weeks to receive and they cost us each about $100. Good Luck,Max AIR TRAVEL Implemented on January 23, 2007, ALL PERSONS traveling by air between the United States and Canada, Mexico, Bermuda, and the Caribbean region are required to present a passport or other valid travel document to enter or re-enter the United States. LAND AND SEA TRAVEL The following summarizes information available on the Department of Homeland Security's website. JANUARY 31, 2008 U.S. and Canadian citizens will need to present either a WHTI-compliant document, or a government-issued photo ID, such as a driver's license, plus proof of citizenship, such as a birth certificate. DHS also proposes to begin alternative procedures for U.S. and Canadian children at that time. SUMMER 2008 At a later date, to be determined, the departments will implement the full requirements of the land and sea phase of WHTI. The proposed rules require most U.S. citizens entering the United States at sea or land ports of entry to have either a U.S. passport; a U.S. passport card; a trusted traveler card such as NEXUS, FAST, or SENTRI; a valid Merchant Mariner Document (MMD) when traveling in conjunction with official maritime business; or a valid U.S. Military identification card when traveling on official orders. The implementation date will be determined based on a number of factors, including the progress of actions undertaken by the Department of Homeland Security to implement the WHTI requirements and the availability of WHTI compliant documents on both sides of the border. DHS and DOS expect the date of full WHTI implementation to be in the summer of 2008. The precise implementation date will be formally announced with at least 60 days notice."

569835,kbkakes,2007-11-18 23:29:00,49,"So in other words, the requirements (passports etc.) have yet be officially implemented. And when they are, there will be a 60 day time frame to comply. Correct? Kevin"
569836,Guest,2007-11-19 10:19:00,0,I would take the word of the people at the USPS before listening to a bunch of guys who like to walleye fish. That's just me though.
569840,bigfish1965,2007-11-19 23:16:00,3210,Well the word we just got up here was that you will need either a gov't issued ID (drivers license) PLUS birth certificate or citizenship card or a passport alone. But what is being worked on is a drivers license with your citizenship encoded into it. This apparently would be okay with DHS. Highly unlikely the governemtns on either side will have the new drivers license thing up and running for at least a few years. All to take affect Jan 31st 2008.
569842,stripersam,2007-11-20 12:12:00,5,"you'll probably need one to be on the safe side. the target date is mid-summer so that could be anytime from may-august which is probably within your trip date. no biggee. i just finished my passport form on line. printed it out. now its on to cvs pharmacy for the 2 photos, then a stop at the usps. biggest hassle with the form ? ma and pa's middle names and birth info. had to dig a little. not a date person. best to have it ready before doing the form. $97. and you're done with it. once this starts guess who's going to be searched at the border ?"
569847,Nimstug,2007-11-20 19:35:00,2605,"I'll try to be brief. About 4 years ago, the California daughter gets the idea that a good *surprise* Christmas present for her mom would be for them to meet in London for a week. Got the reservations and all worked out right here at the computer, except for how to get her a passport without being suspicious. I had the son make up a story about how it would be easier to get into/out of Canada on a fishing trip with a passport. This obviously was long before the passport requirements now in place and those coming up were an issue. So while I didn't at the time have a Canada trip planned, I said to my wife I should get one and and she might as well have one too. Immediately, we raced around getting the pictures, filling out the forms, and submitting them PLUS the special handling fee as time was short. With all the running around we did, she thought something was wrong with me. She was completely surprised by the gift. Anyway, the requirements are coming. Order ahead and save the rush fees. Who knows when you'll have the oportunity to travel? Nimstug"
569881,Flip Silverlake,2007-11-28 11:10:00,645,Passports make it a breeze crossing the boarder both into Canada and back into the US. Your going to need them anyway so just get one.
