568766,Guest,2007-09-05 09:42:00,0,">Sorry Fisherman only here... Oops, Sorry i forgot to mention we are fishing Kayedon also. Didn't know if anybody had any info on the moose hunt Remi and Christine offered."
568767,Guest,2007-09-05 09:44:00,0,>Sorry Fisherman only here... Any resources on a kayedon structure or depth map. Heard its better for walleye than pike.
568783,ONE TIME DAVE,2007-09-06 07:50:00,110,I have maps of the lake. Fished the lake once and did well for Northern and Walleye. E-mail if I can help [email protected].
569149,Guest,2007-09-22 22:54:00,0,"Back from Kap Lake, cold and wet but fishing still very good with approx. 860 for the week. Biggest Northern 39"" and Walleye 23"". Remi's camp very nice & clean, shower was a bonus! Nakina Air Service did a great job of getting us in and out as always. Visited Melchett camp #1, looks very nice...maybe for 2008. Timberidge camp on Tennant Lake burned to the ground so that one is a no go. Leuenberger camp on Kap unused this year, needs some repairs/reno's. Question: Has anyone visited any of Liddles camps or lodges? Also has anyone ventured to Armstrong and stayed with Mattice Lake outfitters? I would like to hear some reviews on those two outfitters as we are considering them for 2008. That's all for now...pic's soon Fish On"
569151,Guest,2007-09-23 10:15:00,0,"WW Just returned from Pringle Lake with MLO. Good fishing despite the weather. Top notch outfitter,service, and equipment. Looking at Kap or Melchett next year."
569152,Crede,2007-09-23 10:32:00,134,"I have been to Makokibatan Lodge with the Liddles 7 times since 1993 - including this past June. The Lodge - along with Miminiska Lodge - was purchased by Wilderness North before this past season. We have always had great fishing and service at Makokibatan. If you have any specific questions, feel free to e-mail me at [email protected]."
569196,ONE TIME DAVE,2007-09-26 07:07:00,110,"If you need any info on Kap or Melchett, please e-mail me, [email protected]. Have fished both numerous times. Great fishing for both eyes and pike. Largest two this year a 41"" and a 46"" pike."
569876,Guest,2007-11-27 17:52:00,0,"As Dave said, I also have fished Kap with Remi and also Abamasagi several times, Hebner and others in the Nakina area. If you want any info on the fishing or outfitters, just drop me a line at [email protected] Good Fishing Rob"
566554,Guest,2007-06-20 15:34:00,0,That's exciting to hear. We're heading up to Melchette with Remi and Christine in the middle of August. Where did you run in to the big northern's?
566586,ONE TIME DAVE,2007-06-22 10:33:00,110,E-mail me direct & I will give you info. Have you been to Melchett and Nakina before? Where are you traveling from. [email protected]

568431,Guest,2007-08-16 18:27:00,0,Hey Flipdip I'd be very interested to hear how the fishing was and the water level of the lakes. We experienced very low water last year and it sure didn't help the fishing. My gang and I are heading to Kap Lake with Remi Sept 8th. Cheers & good fishing!
568467,ONE TIME DAVE,2007-08-18 07:40:00,110,Please give us report on your trip to Kap. Thanks
568487,ONE TIME DAVE,2007-08-18 07:40:00,110,Please give us report on your trip to Kap. Thanks
568535,Guest,2007-08-20 20:41:00,0,"Dave, no worries I'll report in with pics upon my return. I hope to get a hold of that 50"" pike you guys played with earlier in the year!"
568629,Guest,2007-08-27 14:24:00,0,"Just got back on Saturday from Melchett 1. The weather was perfect, 60's/70's during the day 30's/40's at night. Water level was much higher than I have ever seen it there (been there in August of 2003 and 2005 too). Previous group reported a bear in the camp on a couple of occassions but we never saw it. Fishing was great. A couple of our normal spots were not that hot because the water level was higher than normal. We had great luck catching many large eyes across from the Melchett 2 cabin by the steep rocks. Also had good luck at the spot the river between Kap and Melchett comes into Melchett. Had good luck at the point across from the other (not AWO) cabin on Kap. We easily made it back to Tennet and caught a few fish there. We were able to make it back to the old rock bridge on Meta Creek too. We tried something new this year. We took a propane burner up with us and attached the grill tank to it to fry fish. It worked great. Kept the cabin cooler and was much quicker than using frying pans!! E-mail me at [email protected] is you have any other questions."
568752,Guest,2007-09-03 19:33:00,0,"Hey Flip, Great to hear the water is high and the fishing was good! We are hearing up to Kap this Friday and I can't wait to get ahold of one of those nice big pike. Thanks for the tips, look forward to seeing some pics. I post a report and some pic's upon my return...Fish On!"
568753,Guest,2007-09-04 06:20:00,0,Anybody have any info or participated in any of Remi's moose hunts? Specifically Kayedon?
565572,Guest,2007-05-24 18:06:00,0,"Thanks Dave, there's an email in your box. Our group has fished several Nakina lakes such as Abamasagi, Queenston, Poverty, Hebner to name a few if anyone is interested, I'd be happy to share any info. Nice to find a little Nakina corner on the web....fish on!"
565593,Guest,2007-05-25 10:13:00,0,Heading to Nakina on June 8 for the 5th year in a row. Can't wait. Any one know reports for how the first week is going? I have an uncle who left today for Nakina.
565605,ONE TIME DAVE,2007-05-26 09:43:00,110,What lake are you goin to and with what outfitter. Also would like to hear a report. Good Fishing Dave
565622,Guest,2007-05-27 19:54:00,0,Twin Lakes with Merv Pennock. Less than two weeks now until I am heading that way. Let me know of other good walleye lakes. Ones where there are quality fish.
565872,Guest,2007-06-03 07:04:00,0,good luck on your trip. Please advise how you did and how the lake/river was
565880,Guest,2007-06-03 12:37:00,0,Relatives just came back and said the lake raised about a foot this past week. They caught a lot of numbers of walleye but not quality ones.
566142,ONE TIME DAVE,2007-06-11 08:35:00,110,"Fished Melchett Lake with GREAT sucess. Water was very high. Largest fish a 41"" and a 46"" Northern. Walleye 20.5"". My son will post a report with pics."
566335,Guest,2007-06-16 10:27:00,0,GOOD FOR YOU WHAT WERE YOU USING FOR LURES?
566347,dpk23,2007-06-17 10:33:00,3,We primarily use Johnson Silver Minnows in 1/2 and 3/4 oz with a twister tail. I caught the 46 inch on a chrome colored JSM with a hot pink and white tail (a tail color I had never used before).https://www.walleyecentral.com/photop...&ppuser=108554
566470,Guest,2007-06-20 15:34:00,0,That's exciting to hear. We're heading up to Melchette with Remi and Christine in the middle of August. Where did you run in to the big northern's?
564914,Guest,2007-05-03 11:59:00,0,"Word out of Nakina that there is still ice on the above lake. Should be gone within a week. Can't wait to see soft water, May 30th can't come soon enough.:fishhit:"
564918,Greg @ ABL,2007-05-03 13:53:00,23,I have heard some good things about that lake. Hope you have a great trip! Greg Bolinski Agate Bay Lodgewww.agatebaylodge.com NPAA #944
564923,Guest,2007-05-03 16:25:00,0,"Dave, What lake are you going to this time?"
564933,Guest,2007-05-04 06:02:00,0,We will be flying into Melchett Lake on June 1 with Arctic Watershed Outposts. Have fished Melchett several times before with GREAT success. Went to Kayedon last year. Different from what we were used to but had a great trip. Can't come soon enough.
564949,Guest,2007-05-04 16:08:00,0,"What was ""different"" about Kayedon? Just wondering."
565006,Guest,2007-05-07 08:44:00,0,"More flowing water which I liked but the majority did not. MANY rocks just under the serface. We caught many nice ""eye"" but had a hard time finding decent pike. I would try Kayedon again, think it has great potential."
565017,Guest,2007-05-07 19:22:00,0,"A few years ago, we fished Harrogate Lake, just downstream from Kayedon. All river fishing there. What would you consider AWO's best walleye lake?"
565023,Guest,2007-05-08 09:55:00,0,"I believe we catch more ""eye"" in Melchett but the fish seem to be larger and scrapper in Kayedon. We have done well for ""eye"" in all the lakes we have fished, Makoki, Meta, Kap, Melchett, and Kayedon. Kap and Melchett are connected by the Kap river and therefore you can fish both lakes no matter which lake you are staying at. We don't use live bait. Just use jigs with twister tails and crank baits.:9"
565450,Guest,2007-05-19 20:49:00,0,"You say you've fished Kap? We're heading up this fall, any info or tips as it is our first trip to that lake? How do you find AWO as an operator, I've heard good things."
565476,Guest,2007-05-21 07:10:00,0,Outfitters don't come any better than Remi and Christine. We have used them ten times with #11 this June. Is this your first time to Nakina? E-mail me direct [email protected] and I can give you additional info. Looking forward to hearing from you.:popcorn:
