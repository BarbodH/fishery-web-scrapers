569893,Guest,2007-11-29 15:28:00,0,"http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,313844,00.html Study: Canadian Beer Drinkers Threaten Planet Scientists have found a new threat to the planet: Canadian beer drinkers. The government-commissioned study says the old, inefficient ""beer fridges"" that one in three Canadian households use to store their Molson and Labatt's contribute significantly to global warming by guzzling gas- and coal-fired electricity. ""People need to understand the impact of their lifestyles,"" British environmental consultant Joanna Yarrow tells New Scientist magazine. ""Clearly the environmental implications of having a frivolous luxury like a beer fridge are not hitting home. This research helps inform people  let's hope it has an effect."" I always knew we could blame Canada!"

569902,Springseeker,2007-11-29 22:15:00,96,Hey-they also forgot to mention that we only have to run those fridges for half the year. From November to April we just leave the door open and it cools naturally. On a second note I blame the USA for making a fridge that lasts too long.To do my part my next fridge will be made in China.:cheers:
