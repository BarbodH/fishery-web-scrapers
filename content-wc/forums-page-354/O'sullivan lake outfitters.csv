Anybody been there at that time ?How are the cabins ,were going to stay at the main camp. Mainly fishing for walleyes and a few pike. Is this a lake were we can catch 50-100 per day 4guys.Any input would be appreciated Thanks and Fish On"
1270464,Bill Krejca,2011-02-11 18:37:00,6107,"We go in mid-July, but stay at O'Sullivan's Rainbow on the main part/other side of the lake. I think it is pretty good no matter when you go. Precluding bad weather, you should be able to enjoy some 100 walleye/boat days, if you want to fish all day. We don't work at it that hard, though. (I'm assuming you are referring to O'S Lake near Nakina.) Bill Krejca"
1271606,northsky99,2011-02-16 04:19:00,41,Wow guess nobodies been to o 'sullivan lake outfitters in Nakina Except bill.Was mainly wondering about the cabins .
1271637,Bill Krejca,2011-02-16 07:19:00,6107,"Northsky, It is my understanding the camp you will be going to is set up more for a fly-in base for its cabins on other lakes, so there may not be as many folks who actually stay right there on the river to fish. This is in no way a put down for the camp, and I may be wrong in my understanding, but this may be the reason you have not gotten any responses. Bill"
1271655,tooski,2011-02-16 08:27:00,393,"Bill, O'Sullivan flies to four or five lakes but I think their main focus is on the cabins at the river. I would guess they have 8 or 9 cabins with about half of those directly on the river. I have been to their outposts but never stayed at the main camp so I can't speak for the fishing or cabin conditions. A couple certainly looked new."
1271858,Curryale,2011-02-16 17:52:00,50,I have fished on O'Sullivan Lake for three trips in the past 4 years. We have always stayed at O'Sullivan's Rainbow which is top notch. I cannot make a comment about what O'Sullivan Lake Outfitters is like - in fact in the three trips I have made to the lake I have not fished by the river it is on.I have fished on the lake in August before. The fish move to a summer pattern and are located around 18 to 20 feet. Bottom bouncers and spinners is a good technique as well as jigging with Glup.There are big Walleye in O'Sullivan. Each time I have been there there have been fish caught in our group over 27 inches with the largest coming last year at 31 inches. If you fished hard all day you could do quite well for the numbers.We dont fish for many pike but they are there. They are a bit on the small side.There are lots of lake trout in the lake bring a few dipsy divers.This year we are going through O'Sullivan Lake Outfitters to Stinger Lake which is one of their drive to locations. This is no negative comment on O'Sullivan but we just want to try something different.
1271887,Mich_Fisherman,2011-02-16 19:26:00,292,"We've stayed there for 7 trips. Every time the fishing was very good to outstanding. Seemed like it was the best the first year we were there and then was consistently very good fishing. Howard and Elsie are very nice people and good hosts. The cabin are adequate and they all have restrooms within the cabins (unlike some of Rainbow's cabins). The upside to their location is that they are on the river. When the lake whips up you can still fish the river and catch walleye and pike. The downside to the location is that it is a mile run to the lake. We always preferred staying there because of the 2 fishing options. We generally were there in mid June and one year in July. One of the guys in our group did a second trip in August and struggled until finding the fish pattern. He did stay at Rainbow for his second trip at O'Sullivan. This will be our third year not going to O'Sullivan and we've talked about a second Canada trip to go back to O'sullivan. We stopped going there because of the long drive and found a place with better fishing but 300 miles less. But we all admit that we miss O'Sullivan and the lake, it's structure, it's scenery and lots of memories. PM me if you are looking for more information. If you're looking for great fishing with adequate accommodations you cant go wrong. Get cabin 7 if you can. It's tucked under some pine trees and doesn't get really really hot like the other cabins that are out in the open."
2120594,iltgh,2013-09-22 20:33:00,2,"If you are planning a trip to Canada before you book with O'sullivan Lake Outfitters you better look into it. We stayed for a week, the fishing was good the lake was good the place is a dump. We had no running water for the 1st 3 days, (all the water is pumped from the river) Nothing in the cabin worked. The people are very rude. There is no one there to help you. They will not tell you where to find fish even though they promise you the world they absolutely do NOTHING! Then to top it off they told us one price then when we got there we paid almost double! Just be cautious We definetely will NEVER stay there again and if you dont want to get ripped off there are plenty of other places. Just an FYI"
2122473,dosxx,2013-09-23 14:36:00,60,"Our group has fished O'Sullivan Lake 3 times, all in July, but stayed with O'Sullivan's Rainbow at their island outpost. First year was fantastic and we got spoiled with the fishing. The second time was really good, and on the third in 2012 (the water was way down that year and may have had an impact), the fishing seemed less spectacular (but still good) and there seemed to be many more boats than our first time. Walleye is our target species. The owners run a nice camp at Rainbow Lodge.We have fished Abamassagi Lake (boat in) with O'Sullivan Outfitters (Howard's place). We stayed one night at the main camp before boating in in the morning. It was just a place to crash instead of staying in Geraldton or Longlac and I can't give the cabin rave reviews. The camp on Abamassagi was roomy, had a hand pump and generator for the freezer, and was nicer than other fly in camps we have done. The boats were adequate (I think 16' with 20 hp) and the fishing was very good. There were a few others on the lake who flew in to there camps, but it definitely was not crowded. There is lots of water to fish. It was a good value and we were all pleased."
2123433,unclepaully,2013-09-23 20:34:00,112,"I know this is an old thread but I do have a few things to say about O'Sullivan Lake Outfitters. First off the main camp is not appealing at all. I've stayed twice as an overnight before our week long trips. Both instances the showers did not work at all(different cabins). Old junk laying around and the river there is nothing to look at. The cabins are overpriced for what you get. I would advise to use that place as a jumping off point and that's it. Now as far as the outpost camp I stayed at on Abamasagi, I was very impressed. I thought for the price we paid the camp was phenomenal. Quality boat and motor. Nice fish cleaning shed and generator shed. Cabin was basic yet very clean(no mice at all!) and had updated appliances(great chest freezer). The location on the lake is great as well. Howard's grandson Kyle goes out of his way to get things done when called upon.There is no way I would spend one week at the main camp, however the Abamasagi outpost is a different story."
