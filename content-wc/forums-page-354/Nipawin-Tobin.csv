The big lake should be very good for huge pike, I like to use big smelts on a quick strike rig under a float. If you want to go for big walleye the river is usually better this time of year than the lake. Yes it will be hard to find big leechs this time of year but night crawlers work well too. Spinners work well by drifting."

Going back in 17 days Many big girls to be caught this time of the year.If the wind is bad you won't get on the lake with a 21 footer, but the river from Nipawin to the Eagles nest area is narrow and protected enough that you can fish out of almost anything."
