We have fished out of Timberlane Lodge near Ear Falls, several times over the years, (both with old and new owners), and always had a good experience there. Thinking it might be fun to try a different place - or maybe we'll just go back there. The only problem with Timberlane is it is a long way up lake to get to the better fishing from Steamboat Narrows on east. Any suggestions on camps we might look at would be greatly appreciated. We always do our own cooking and housekeeping and will need boats. Finances are limited so we aren't looking for a 5 star experience, just good clean cabins and good boats and motors."

2133833,wallydave,2013-09-28 11:51:00,2151,Take at look at Onaway or Lac Seul Lodge . Fishermens Cove is in the same area too. They are south of the Ear Falls area. Good luck
