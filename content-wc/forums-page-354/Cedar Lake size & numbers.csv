We caught more fish than any other trip, blowing our numbers away. The thing that we did not understand was all of the small fish that we caught. We did catch lots of good sized fish, but many, many 9""-12"" 'ers. We were up in spring, we did not catch too many then, in fact, very few. We have never caught them in past trips. These small fish must be a couple of years old, why are they hitting now? Is it just that they are finally big enough to tackle a jig? I would thing it is a good sign for the lake, with that many young fish in the system. Any thoughts on that?"
2120977,fishguide1800,2013-09-23 06:19:00,84,"Not sure what to tell you.i spend a lot of time guiding cedar.and most of our fish are usually pretty good size.have caught a good nimber of fish from 20""-30"".spring was somewhat slower due to the late ice out.but places where we fished still produced fish.right now walleye fishing is on fire on the deeper drop offs.getting some good sized onesand some smaller ones mixed in.perch and smallmouths are on some shallower humps.excellent fishing right now and decent weather.slightly windy lately.water temps are around 61 f."
2120985,1jigfish2,2013-09-23 06:24:00,110,"Fishguide18800, thanks for responding, We have fished Cedar for 6 years. We caught unbelievable numbers of walleyes last week. We caught most fish in 22'-28' of water. We just thought it strange to catch so many small ones, when hardly any in past. We did catch lots of bigger ones, I am NOT complaining."
2121409,BornToFish,2013-09-23 08:29:00,1224,"I fished on adjacent Perrault Lake during June and August. I found my walleye fishing this year to be the best in thirteen years of fishing this system. I am referring to size and numbers of walleyes.I've been fishing Perrault lake since 10 September. I was catching good numbers and size walleyes during the first several days of my current trip - mostly fishing off-shore rock humps in 24-32 fow. I noted the water temperature to be unusually warm for this time of year. I noticed the water was surprisingly clear during the first days of this trip.I hit a ""dry spell"" for around the week of 15 - 22 September. I was catching walleyes everywhere that I fished. However, most of these walleyes were 10-12 inchers. During this week, I noticed that there was a mild algae bloom starting. I concurrently noted that the minnows and other baitfish that were previously hugging the bottom started moving high up into the water column. I saw these baitfish on my Humminbird and also visually. I noticed on some evenings that baitfish were leaping out of the water, presumably being chased by predators. I surmised that the bigger walleyes were chasing baitfish high in the water column. I noticed the leaping baitfish all over the lake, not just near structure. I suspected that the smaller walleyes feared for their lives being high in the water column, and chose to stay on structure. I was catching these smaller walleyes with regularity.I fished again last night and noted that better size walleyes (16-18 inches) were returning to structure, where I prefer to fsih. The biggest walleye last night was 24-25 inches.I don't know if the above information is the complete answer to your observation, but it at least seems consistent.Good fishing...."
2122945,1jigfish2,2013-09-23 17:18:00,110,"BornToFish, We noticed the exact same thing on Cedar. Algae bloom, bait fish up high, fish on surfsce. That may explain what happened, thank you."
2124130,bigdaddyguns,2013-09-24 07:03:00,608,Did either of you try working higher up in the water column during that condition? We ran into a somewhat similar situation in July with an insect hatch. The walleye fishing was good during that time over the morning/evening periods jigging/rigging. However some mid day periods were slow and I suspect an active bite may have been going on during the day in the mid to top of the column that we missed.
2125538,1jigfish2,2013-09-24 15:51:00,110,"BigDaddyGuns, We never tried up higher. We caught fish all day, every day. Numbers were incredable."
2125730,fishguide1800,2013-09-24 17:07:00,84,"Just got off of cedar lake today.fishing was good.lots of 13-16"" walleyes.quite a few 16-18"" fish to with a few in the 19-20"" range.fish are down to 30+ in some spots.along with perch and smallmouths.awesome day of fishing.managed to catch a 40"" muskie whole casting and saw 3 more.the other boat had a lady fisherman and she caught a 33"" tiger.which she caught on a jig.pretty cool.still some good looking weeds for them to hide in.but i mainly hit the rocks today."
2126010,1jigfish2,2013-09-24 19:39:00,110,"Fishguide1800, Thank you for the report, it is good to see things turned back to normal again."
