2136321,dynamite,2013-09-29 19:13:00,20,"Just got back from Golden Hook. We had dinner with Scott and Machelle the new owners and Bill and Maureen the old owners. Scott and Machelle are great and will carry on the great service to guests. Fishing was good. We had a 28"" walleye and 39 1/2 inch northern. Many over slot fish. Winds were out of the east south east all week at 10 to 30 km and water temperatures in the low 60's all week. The lake has not turned over yet. This made for a slow bite. We fish Lac Seuel in June and depend on wind blown points to find fish. Gull Rock fish do not respond to the wind the same, It just adds to the fishing knowledge when searching out fish. We will be back next year.wer"
