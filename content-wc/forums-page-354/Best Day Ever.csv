In late June/early July, four of us fished for 6 days. We primarily focused on 10-20 feet of water with great success on both volume and size. We did some jigging with 1/8 to ¼ oz jigs but spend a lot of time pulling gulp and bottom bouncers. Highlights of the first trip included 7 over 27 with the two largest eyes being 28 & 28.5. We also had a massive 43 pike caught on gulp. Got back from trip #2 a little over a week ago and had my single best day on the water ever. Two of us fished for six days and ended up with another 7 over 27 with the two largest being two 29's that I caught on the same day. This trip we fished primarily 18-30 feet and with the exception of some first day success with gulp and bouncers we moved almost exclusively to jig and minnow. My best day ever on the water was August 31st. The day started with lunch in the box within 15 minutes of fishing. I then said out loud Lunch is in the box, let's hunt for bigs. The wind was blowing and there was a great walleye chop on Lac Seul. Within 30 minutes I landed my first 29 of the day on a deep mega sand structure with a ¼ oz jig and minnow in 30' of water. It was my first 29 in a decade and boy did it feel awesome. Right after an awesome shore lunch I caught a 27 on another mega sand structure also in 30 feet of water. At this point I was like seriously how can this get any better. The wind had progressively declined during the day and late afternoon thunderstorms were starting to develop around us, by 4pm we were faced with almost a dead calm and balmy conditions. The bite had also slowed and I decided to gear down to a 1/8 oz version of the same jig I'd been using all day. Within minutes, I set the hook on my second 29 and this fish fought like no walleye I had ever caught before. In 30' of water this fish had plenty of room to roam, she made several power runs ripping drag with that classic big tail pulse that you just know means you have a large walleye on the other end of your line. Several minutes later the net was in the water and my second 29 of the day was hoisted into the boat. There's one word that comes to mind as I've rewound this day countless times in my head over the last couple weeks and that's nirvana. It will undoubtedly remain as one of the best days I've ever had on the water. I caught at least 80 fish that day including 21 over 18, with 2-24's, 1-25, 1-27 & 2-29's. I spent the next few days just taking in every moment catching lots of great Lac Seul walleyes but nothing over 25, I couldn't wipe the smile off my face and still have a tough time not grinning every time I think of it ... walleye nirvana! To sum it up, we ended the year with 14 eyes over 27 which broke down as 9-27's, 3-28's & 2-29's. Thanks to everyone at Silver Water Wheel Lodge. It is unquestionably one of the best lodges in all of NW Ontario on one of the best walleye lakes on the planet. Their attention to detail in every regard is second to none. The entire staff is simply outstanding and incredibly accommodating. I personally don't think you can get any better owners than Mike and Missy Willems and after 14 years (19 trips) of fishing out of SWWL I still get worked up like kid headed to Canada for the first time each and every trip. I've now got several months to reminisce about my incredible day and get ready for 2014 which will bring my 100th day on Lac Seul. Looking forward to the next 14 years and creating a whole new set of fishing memories at SWWL on Lac Seul."
