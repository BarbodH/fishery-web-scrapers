We made it to stairway point and noticed a lodge to the South of it and I can't find it online. I wish we would have boated over there and checked it out. We are looking for housekeeping accomodations for 5 with an indoor toilet and shower. Thanks"
2097577,1shooter,2013-09-11 16:46:00,1493,Here's the resort you are referring to: www.newmoonlodge.ca Grassy Narrows is another close by resort that is pretty nice. We stay a little further away at Obabikon.

Yes I have had much better fishing up on lac than low, however I had a couple muskies on this year on lotw very fun. We went to lotw because it was closer to home and figured we wouldn't have to run the boat very far every day to catch fish. Boy was I wrong we ran just as far as lac seul..... didn't bring enough gas so had to fill up the prov in morson for $285 bucks ouch"

We pulled to the dock and were treated like long-time patrons,great service and hospitality. I have a cabin up in that region so I don't stay at a resort,but I would not hesitate to stay there, great area, good-looking cabins, and super nice hosts."
