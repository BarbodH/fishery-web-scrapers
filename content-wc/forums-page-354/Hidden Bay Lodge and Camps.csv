Boats were small 14 footers with 9.9 or 15 hp. Seats in them were not the most comfortable. Numbers were great as far as walleyes. Never got anything bigger than 25"". Would not hesitate to use this outfitter. It is a first class fly-in."

Walleye catch has been over the top incredible with not only 14 lb Pigs to 1000 plus fish in a 3 1/2 day trip. Ocomodations are the best I've seen in Canada, excluding the all inclusive guided trips, these cabins are not only remote, but placed well, so you don't have to travel miles to find a hot spot. Most of the fly in cabins are located on prime spots for fishing. Nice boats with comfortable seats and reliable outboards. Cabins are loaded with canned foods and high end refrigerators, as well as hot and cold running water and toilets, showers, etc. Also, a very important feature is the Sat Phone system if you have to call home or for emergency. I would highly recommend this Lodge."

2130289,55walleyes,2013-09-26 17:39:00,131,I have nothing but good things to say about Hidden Bay. Been a long time customer. Original post may have been a little over the top but it is a first class operation.
