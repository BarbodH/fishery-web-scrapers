Nothing big, but the bite was on and cant think of a better way to start the day after a night shift. Lots of fun and proof that in NWO a 200hp strapped to the back of a Tyee is not always necessary (but if anyone wants to donate theirs i wont say no).http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O0YlFGvxg8"

Your style of fishing has great appeal for me - small, simple boat, small outboard, portable fish finder, a few jigs in a shirt pocket, some minnows and the Lab. You demonstrate again and again that a $60K boat, $15K motor, 10K in electronics, and a doz. St. Croix rods aren't necessary to be a class A walleye angler. . . . . . but investing the time and effort to get to know the water you fish and the behavior patterns of 'eyes are. Good reading and watching. Thanks.P.S. Hope the roof got finished so you have some fishing time before freeze up."
