2121321,Pete eer,2013-09-23 08:14:00,14,"Just returned from Sandy Beach Lodge on Trout Lake. The fishing was great, the wife and I, mainly jigging in 25 to 30 feet averaged around 50 walleye per day in the 20-24 inch range. The lake is big and can be rough but there is enough islands and areas to get out of the weather if need be. The lake trout fishing this was the best of 3 prior trips. Fishing in the PM in 100 feet of water we would catch 8 to 10 trout in a 2 hour period. At one point all three in the boat had trout hooked."
2121521,PhilTickelson,2013-09-23 09:13:00,84,"Thanks for taking the time to leave a report you guys. How were you fishing for the trout Pete? Jigging? What was the largest walleye you guys put in the boat? Also, where on the lake is Sandy Beach located? How are the cabins and boats?"
2123778,zeebee,2013-09-23 23:43:00,1144,"Beginning in mid July or so the lakers will concentrate in the deep basin north of the camp..bout a 10 min ride. Just to the N or E of the 1st small island (Off the NW tip of Cat Island) is a deep basin...approx. 70-120 FOW. That's where the lakers concentrate feeding on whitefish. We averaged a fishon every 10-15min using one portable downrigger. The only spoon we used was a large 5"" Len Thompson in firetiger replacing the treble with a single pinched siwash as this greatly adds to a quick release. The most common size laker was 5-7 lbs with every third fish or so over 10lbs. It really is an outstanding laker fishery and a portable downrigger & depth finder make the most of it. We would boat into that area and if we marked active fish we stayed. If they were hugging the bottom and inactive then it was back to walleye fishing. Out of 14 days, they were inactive on only two.The average walleye is larger than most lakes ...20-22"". My PB is 27.5"" but Ive seen larger. I don't focus too much on NP's ...they are incidental catches while I troll for walleye off the points in 20-40 FOW with DHJ's. Catch one eye trolling and odds are you will jig a few up. Sometimes quite a few."
2124386,PhilTickelson,2013-09-24 08:32:00,84,"That sounds fantastic. I know 5-7 lbs probably isn't huge as far as lake trout go, but they have to be fun to catch at that size and depth. I'm pretty excited about this, hopefully I can convince my group to go!"
2131985,Pete eer,2013-09-27 10:21:00,14,"We fished for the trout using jigging spoons and large lead head jigs with twister tails. The larges walleye we caught was 25 and the largest northern was 41. Sandy Beach is an excellent fishing lodge, the cabins are old, but are in great condition and well kept. The boats have 25-40 hp motors, the guides are local and know the lake.

2111482,PhilTickelson,2013-09-18 13:53:00,84,"Hey Guys and Gals, I'm planning a fly-in trip with a small group of guys and we were all but settled on either Hidden Bay(Minniss Lake) or Winoga(Roadhouse or Carling) when I stumbled across Boois's Lodge on Trout Lake. I did a search and pulled up quite a few other threads, but I have a few specific questions. Their website is impressive, it looks like there are some huge fish in the lake. Anyone have any experience there? We want to strike a nice middle ground between ridiculous numbers and quality fish. I've been to Carling before and we caught 1000+ walleye in 4 days, but very few were over 20"". I'd be happy with catching half as many fish if the size was better.How easy is it to catch Lakers on Trout Lake? We haven't done much laker fishing, but would like to give it a try, would experienced fisherman have a good chance to catch a few? I'm not even sure what a 'good day' of lake trout fishing is. I mean we would probably be satisfied with 5-10 fish in a few hours, especially if there is trophy possibilities. Lastly, the lake looks quite large, they have 18' boats but is it every un-fishable? The last thing I want to have happen is to sit in a cabin for 2 out of the 7 days because it's too windy. Is there areas that can be fished regardless of wind direction? Thanks for any and all of the help, this is a great forum!"
2112497,ChicagoPike,2013-09-18 22:05:00,1,I sent you a PM and would be happy to discuss. I have been to both Boois and Minniss.
2113410,dan cardinal,2013-09-19 10:10:00,64,"I have been to Boois, but in August. If you are planning an early season trip, my experience on Trout Lake may not benefit you much. However Boois is great experience. I would not classify it as the best walleye fishery out there, but it would rate good. 21"" to 24"" walleye are abundant. Larger walleye are certainly there, but catching 24""+ walleye during the August period...we did not catch an abundance of them. That I think is due to the clarity of the water...it's pretty clear in comparison to other Ontario lakes I have fished. We jig exclusively. 30 to 40 FOW is primarily the depth....reefs, points of islands, and breaks is where we focused. The main basin is where we concentrated, but there are options if the wind kicks up.Lake trout are so lousy there it's ridiculous. We rarely caught anything over 28""...which is small in lake trout standards, but fun to catch for a change. We caught loads of 24"" to 28"" trout in 75 FOW and deeper. We had medium spinning and bait casting rigged with 3/4 and 1 ounce swim jigs...trailer was a large white tube or plastic jerk bait. Dropping it straight to the bottom...rip it off the bottom a of couple times...if nothing...immediately start cranking it off the bottom as fast as you can crank. We had 3 to 4 boats setting in an area...with double and triples frequently. An hour to two hours action like this was not uncommon...then it seemed to get a little boring and we went back to chasing walleye.What I found a little unique is, you can find abundant walleye in 30 to 35 FOW, drift 25 yards off a break into 75 FOW or more and find large numbers of catchable trout. We literally had boats 25 to 50 yards apart...one boat catching walleye...the other boats loading up on trout. Boois is a treat! Great host! Wonderful in every way. I could go on and on!If you would like to PM me...I can place you on several spots and provide further information."
2114266,PhilTickelson,2013-09-19 17:39:00,84,Thanks for the responses guys! I just responded to your pms!
2114434,eyemike,2013-09-19 19:03:00,233,"My wife and I were at Boois in July. We had a blast. Huge lake but you can always find someplace to fish. We almost exclusively trolled cranks. The walleyes we were catching were 20 to 25 inches. Very few were under 20. We were catching 40 to 50 per day average. Those that trout fished just slaughtered them. I would love to go back, such a great place."
2114650,PhilTickelson,2013-09-19 20:04:00,84,"Wow, that sounds amazing Mike. I'd take 25 walleye between 20 and 25 inches every day . Did you fish solely for walleye while you were up there?Any really big ones?"
2114746,eyemike,2013-09-19 20:25:00,233,"Yes, although I caught a beautiful pike about 44 inches and my wife caught 2 about 36 inches. I would most definitely try my hand at the lakers. Anyone who fished for them caught them. Trolling crankbaits for big eyes is so much fun though, my wife just loved it! She caught at least 6 that were 25 inches."
2116930,zeebee,2013-09-20 19:41:00,1144,"Been up there twice both in mid August. Troll deep cranks (DHJ-13's and TD's #11) and catch, as others an abundance of eyes primarily 21"" and over. PB NP was 47"" and 43""-33 lbs laker. If larger lakers are of interest, suggest you take a portable downrigger. 60' to 70' over 80-120 FOW. Great lodge and upper tier for a fly-in. Its a big lake by fly in standards and you'll never get bored of seeking new areas. Enuff sheltered areas that weather was never a factor over the 14 days fished."
2117170,PhilTickelson,2013-09-20 21:33:00,84,"Holy crap, 47"" pike and 43"" laker? Those are some NICE PB's. When you are fishing for lakers are you finding certain structure in deep water? Or are you just covering a lot of ground trolling over it? How do you know to target 60-70'? Is it just experience or are you watching your graph real closely? I've never fished lakers so I'm not sure what they relate to. I've always heard deep water, but are we talking about a 20,000 acre basin that's 120 feet deep? How do you find them? Thanks for chiming in though, that's SUPER encouraging to know that there's fish that big and that you can fish even in windy conditions.Just out of curiosity, what's your PB walleye there?"
2118106,Guest,2013-09-21 15:36:00,0,"Have been to Trout Lake- but for walleye mostly...we did work hard to catch a few trout.. but a lot of work for a few very small fish- we just wanted to say we did it and thats about what it was.... Maybe a real trout fisherman would have done better, but we did have an old timer who knew the lake and he took us out or we probably would not have gotten any. Also been to several of Hidden Bay camps including Miniss. I was encouraged to try Miniss by a friend who had been going there for like twenty years. It was great, we have gone several times since then.. Lots of walleye and northern and the bigger water does seem to produce bigger fish... at least thats what we found... Caught lots of fish at their camps but got some nicer ones here...Its definitely big enough to get lost on...found gps works well... Lots of islands though which we appreciate as I hate rough water when I only get one trip a year and might have kids with etc.... Hidden Bay has really spruced up all the camps we have been to...which is nice as well..they added internet which I like for safety sake...(and phone) I have the lake maps if you want one ( I save them, pretty sure I have Miniss) can mark spots- but you won't need help if you fish much at all... We quit bringing live bait and just use gulp type bait...lots of fish- don't need the minnows unless you really want them... Cabin is much improved since we first went there...really nice new fridges that actually work and make ice even- although they fly in plenty... we get a kick out of having ice cream with their homemade pies and the freezer replaced the dry ice we used to bring !"
