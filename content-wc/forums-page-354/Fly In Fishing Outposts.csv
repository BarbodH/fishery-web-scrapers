1542691,MarkMark,2013-02-24 16:27:00,7,"We have been going to different fly in camps for about 40 years. Stumbled into Hidden Bay out of Sioux Lookout kind of by accident when we heard they had satellite phones for safety in their camps. I was bringing my kids up who were very young, and the idea of a phone was important to me in the event of an accident. Now they have computers in their camps with phones service and you can post pictures on facebook every day..kind of fun for those at home ie: Moms worried about kids and still an important safety net I think. So we got hooked on their camps first for safety... Luckily the fishing was great as well.. too many stories to even begin to tell... lots of memories. I highly recommend the trips especially with the younger kids to start the bonding process early. My kids are in college now and these trips are our best memories. The fishing is so good the kids are never bored. Have never had a bad lake with Hidden Bay...Blackstone is hard to get into as its always booked.. Minnis is big bring a GPS.. Raggedwood was our first and still a sentimental favorite..its smaller and easier for less experienced fisherman- can't get lost... They don't offer a meal plan there though.. so you have to bring your own food to that lake... The others have all the food there and they fly in the fresh stuff with you like steaks and cookies..pies... kind of fun to eat well... We quit brining live bait..they do sell it and will fly it in with you but we were doing as well on gulp type stuff and in the long run its cheaper and easier to use that we think... If you want a trip that your kids will remember I suggest trying these folks- nice people..and great fishing... Hope that helps !"
1542703,pikeman14,2013-02-24 17:00:00,144,We are booked for Lake Salvesen through Halleys Camps this June! I can't wait! They have a newer cabin on the lake and the fishing sounds great. The winter seems extra long when you have a trip booked for spring. Thanks to everyone for their help here on W C.
2051458,sek2691,2013-08-23 06:58:00,15,"I have been to Ghost River 10 times and have never been disappointed. Lots of chooses as there are 17 lakes. Used to go to Knobby's and it is an awesome fishing experience but I haven't been there since they sold it to the natives. went once to Thunderhook Fly Ins in Armstrong an would like to go back. My 12 year old caught his biggest walleye at Smoothrock at 29"". Had lots of big fish to the point that we had trouble catching enough small ones to eat. This was in the 3rd week on Sept."
2051698,jimirjr,2013-08-23 08:06:00,1149,"Pikeman, We did a fly in to CHASE LAKE way back in 1991 / 93 when it was called LYLE and VALS outpost camps... Did VERY well on Eyes up to 27"" numbers as well... 1000 fish week for four Guys. Eyes probably averaged @ 17"" biggest was 27"". When we targeted PIKE, we did good on numbers, got a few in the upper 30"" range and a couple over 40"" They seemed to be more prevelant in EAGLE LAKE than in CHASE. We got two 40""+ PIKE in the Channel (MIDWAY LAKE?) between Chase and Eagle, although that was, what 20+ years ago... never got any SMALLIES, although, I heard they were in the system... Camps were rather primitive back than, cabins were GREAT! just no running water, or electric... no big deal... It would be fun to go back there, although the fishing would probably not be as good...."
2066850,Flag Island,2013-08-29 05:50:00,32,"Halley's is great and very helpful with some bass only lakes, Jacksons Outposts out of Lac Du Bonnet have some great walleye lakes also. If you dad wanted a little pampering try one of Halley's lodges."
2071914,pikeman14,2013-08-31 08:00:00,144,"We were very happy with Halleys once again. Everyone was very comfortable with their first fly in experience. Now that everyone has a trip under their belt, future trips will be easier to plan out."
2129945,MarkMark,2013-09-26 14:06:00,7,I don't see small mouth at any of the fly in lakes we do in northern Ontario...
1398806,Guest,2012-02-24 17:53:00,0,"Check out Hidden bay lodge. Flew up last July to Blackstone Lake with a group of 8 guys. Caught tons of walleye biggest was 32"" and a good numbr of pike over 35"" , biggest was 41"". I have fished many fly in camps over the last 35 years. Blackstone was unbeliveable. Can't wait till July, our group has grown to 10 guys, should be interesting. I have been to many of the camps mentioned above. Had some good fishing through other outfitters but these camps and the service at Hidden bay lodge are a step up."
1398907,55walleyes,2012-02-25 06:55:00,131,"Red eye,Would be interested in trading some info on Blackstone. Last July was my first trip there and we are returning also. Size of walleyes was very impressive. Contact me if interested in exchanging some info."
1398978,pikeman14,2012-02-25 09:07:00,144,Thanks for the tip Red Eye. Blackstone looks very nice and remote
1399093,Guest,2012-02-25 14:52:00,0,"55walleyes Last year was my first year on Blackstone and did really well. Last summer the weather was crazy. High temps and low water changed things up. Simply put Tim, one of owners, was standing on the dock when we flew into Blackstone. He was flying into Miniss from Blackstone to continue with his ""Quality control checks"". He stated that his father purchased Hidden Bay the year he was born and has been fishing his lakes ever since. He gave me his map that was marked up with tons of spots. Caught good eaters in the moving water and even a few hogs. Most of the 28""+ were caught over the drop offs of 25 feet or more. We just did what he told us and had a trip of a lifetime. Contact him and I'm sure he will help you."
1399324,pikeman14,2012-02-26 07:46:00,144,We've narrowed down our choices to Halley's Camps and Ghost River Lodge...mainly because of the smallmouth bass options. Has anyone have any experience at these places?
1399327,wallydave,2012-02-26 07:49:00,2151,"Pikeman, try the search function, there are some good reports from Ghost River. I have a fishing buddy that loves Ghost River, the service and the ability to fish so many lakes and types of fish. Good Luck and let us know how your trip went!"
1399600,Larry Mac,2012-02-26 19:40:00,530,"Hi Pikeman14, I have found that researching, investigating and choosing an adventure is very exciting (IMHO). You have experienced some very amazing adventures already giving you a huge advantage. You know what you really want and what to expect. It is so exciting being able to spend time in the Canadian Bush with your father and Brother in laws. We have experienced, fly in’s, drive to, boat and portage in along with camping in the Bush. They all have their own Pros and Cons. We will be Camping, doing a Boat and Portage in along with a Fly in this year. They all were chosen based upon specific requirements of the people going. Finding a camp that has specific species of fish should not be too difficult. Choosing the type of experience you want to share with your guest must be decided. You said in a previous post that they have never experienced a “Fly In” so I believe they will want to go on a “Fly in”. I believe you first must decide on the type of adventure you want to experience as they all could be very different. You mention the weight issue and we have found that with the proper planning weight is not a challenge. We have never paid an overweight charge and never wanted for anything. We have adhered to 100 lb per person weight restrictions on 7 day trips and actually weighed in 60lbs lighter on one of them. As you know a “Fly in” trip is very special and unique. As for smallmouth, believe it or not our best smallmouth experience was at a “Drive in” camp. We found them around the beds and averaged 60 to 100 per day per boat, go figure LOL. I have found that the farther North you go the fewer smallmouth if any will be present. Looking at your WC name I believe you really enjoy big pike. If that is what you are looking for this will also help you narrow down your choices. You are looking at some great camps and you will find one that fits your requirements. You will have a great time no matter where you go as you are going with people you care about. Being that you are going in 2013 you have some time. If you want any information on any of the camps or outfitters we have used in the past please feel free to PM me, Have a great year.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1403114,Guest,2012-03-05 12:13:00,0,"I have personally fished Wawang and had a great time. I caught my two biggest fish ever (a 40"" pike and 28"" walleye) and the following day caught even bigger ones LOL (a 42"" pike and 29.5"" walleye)! I found them through the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters Association and was impressed by thier standings as well as the number of pics each year. The camp was a drive to and easy enough to find and our cabin was pretty nice. I cant say it was five star but alot nicer than the last three fly ins I have done. I averaged over 150 fish per day and my wife 75 (she prefers to tan LOL) in mid June. We collectivley caught 11 trophy fish as well. I appreciated those Angler Awards on my wall as a bonus! I cant make it up this year because I took a winter vacation instead, but I guarantee I will be heading back there (with the guys this time) next year."
1403392,GOBIG,2012-03-06 04:16:00,126,"Pikeman, i see you like to fish for pike, have you looked at eddies north? I sent you a pm"
1423950,packpro,2012-04-20 16:40:00,695,"Had a great trip to ghost river in 2007. Get to know Donny. He is the #2 guy in camp. He put us on fish every day. We had great numbers days on some of the portages, and we had great large fish 24""+ days. One guy with us caught four 24""-27"" consecutively on a great reef in an area called Burnt Narrows. Great structure and great current in that area. Donny not only put us the fish, he gave us technique tips for specific areas. We cooked for ourselves, but we gave them notice and had two meals in the lodge to break up the week. Hope you have a great trip where ever you go."
1397464,pikeman14,2012-02-21 19:22:00,144,"Has any one used Knobby's, Armstrong, Halley's, Nwo, or fished the English River System, or Ghost River?Can't decide where to go."
1397480,Pikeslayer8,2012-02-21 19:46:00,1460,"Northern Wilderness Outfitters have great lakes, the most experienced Canadian ""Bush Pilots"" in the north and great service. They can take care of you for sure. What kind of fly-in trip do you have in mind?"
1397485,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-02-21 19:59:00,235,"Have fished fly in outpost lakes that are part of an English River tributary. Used Kabeelo Airways out of Ear Falls (Wakeman, Jeanette, Okanse and Betha outposts). Wakeman was more of a numbers lake (very high numbers), but a bit lacking in size. Jeannette was our favorite overall. Average size Jeannette walleye is about 17-18 inches, many over 20 too (largest was 31.5). Kabeelo is virtually all walleye and northern pike, so if you want bass or musky, it's not your place. One lake has lake trout (Seagraves). I can share good info on the mid summer fishing on Okanse and Jeannette if needed. Excellent service at Kabeelo - Harald is a one of a kind guy."
1397493,Hawkfan,2012-02-21 20:30:00,237,"If you are looking at Knobby's out of Sioux Lookout, don't overlook these others there...www.slatefallsoutposts.comwww.fishredpine.comWe've gone through both outfitters and they have a quality product. IMO it doesn't get any better than Gull Lake through Red Pine."
1397600,pikeman14,2012-02-22 07:17:00,144,"Thanks for your help guys!Without seeming greedy...this is where im at. I've used Halley's Camps to fly into Chase Lake a few years ago..Halley's was excellant for accomodating our trip..8 guys caught over 1200 walleye, some nice pike and smallies.Next year I want to share this with my dad and brother in laws who have not ever done a fly in. I want good numbers of walleye so they stay interested, but we trully enjoy pike fishing. Im just afraid that the pike will all be snakes. I understand you have to work for a couple big ones, but I know some of these lakes might average 30 inchers. My dad wants to catch smallies also. I'm guessing most of these lakes hold bass, but dont advertise them. Im figuring any body of water with falls/rapids might hold easy smallmouths.Ive heard guys catching over 3000 walleye at lake shabumeni, Gawleys outpost, but dont know of the pike/bass situation.Pricing out the outposts is a bit of a question. Knobbys,gatewaynorth,ghostriverlodge,halleys,fishi ngcanada,gawleys,shabu,pfo,armstrong,and wawang(driveto) are on my list. The $ differs by a few hundred for these. All look great! But brochures are only advertisement. I'd rather hear from you about that lake.Some of the biggest questions are weight limit charges, license included, satellite phone, extra bait, decent cabin which doesnt flood, variety of fish, but mainly weight charges. I might go again with halleys, but am willing to explore at a better rate. Thanks for sharing your experiences! Any info would help.pikeman14"
1397609,Mohleye,2012-02-22 07:33:00,368,"Shabumeni does not have smallmouth, just walleye and northern. We haven't fished specifically for northern on Shab for many years, but when we did we didn't catch many larger fish. Nor do we catch much for size or numbers of pike while fishing for walleye, like you do on some lakes. It's a good numbers lake for walleye, but I'd rate the pike as below average. I have no personal experience with Wawa, but from some of the past threads I gather it is not in the same class at all with the other lakes/areas you mention."
1397611,wallydave,2012-02-22 07:35:00,2151,"Ghost River is a boat-in, I have a buddy that won't go anywhere else, he has fished Lac Seul a couple of times, after one trip to Ghost River, he won't go any place else."
1397838,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-02-22 15:02:00,235,"Don't assume that most of the lakes up there hold smallmouth. In fact, among fly in outpost lakes overall, smallmouth are more the exception than the rule. Outfitters are more likely to advertise fish that are present but not common than they are to not advertise an abundant gamefish species in their waters.You may have a hard time finding a perfect lake that offers big pike (unless it's early spring), good smallmouth and abundant walleye. Something may have to give in that equation. I've spent a lot of time researching the perfect smallmouth/walleye outpost camp and it's somewhat elusive. You've had success and a good experience with Halley's. Unless the price difference is extreme between it and a comparable option, I would go with what you know. Reward a good service provider with repeat business. Another option to consider is Excellent Adventures out of Ear Falls...I believe Sumach Lake has a good mix of smallies/walleyes/pike, but you should call Faron and ask him. Good luck and let us know where you go (and how you did)."
1398264,bjb1929,2012-02-23 14:03:00,4,"Have used both. It has been a few years, though. Fished with Knobby's twice at Wesleyan Lake and twice at Roadhouse. Hammered walleyes every time. Not many giant pike. One of our group seemed to always catch one over 15 lbs., though. But we mostly fished for walleyes. At Northern Wilderness Outfitters we fished Glitter Lake. Same story. Lots of eyes and a couple of big pike. Again, we fished walleyes mostly. Hope this helps."
1398287,IaDave,2012-02-23 14:32:00,476,Roadhouse now is a fly-in for Winoga Lodge. They picked up a couple of lakes from Knobby's.
