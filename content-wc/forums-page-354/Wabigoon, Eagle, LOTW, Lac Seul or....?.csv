2128753,Guest,2013-09-25 22:07:00,0,We have excellent muskie fishing and not a whole lot of pressure out here. Boat in easy drive on paved roads. Lots of places to hide from the wind. You wont be disappointed.
2130033,NARDA 1,2013-09-26 15:29:00,636,Check out www.birchdalelodge.com located on the Vermillion Bay area of Eagle Lake. Good Musky area plus smallmouth and walleye. This fish was caught while jigging for walleye on Vermillion Bay.

2099801,Ruddiger,2013-09-12 16:18:00,649,"Howdy, My current camp on a lake system I have fished for 17 years is closing and its time for a change of scenery. Im looking to pick a new lake system to fish for all species (muskie, pike, bass, walleye) and throughout the open water season. I am primarily a caster and try to avoid trolling at all costs, even in the fall if possible. Ideally I would like to pick a lake and a great camp and fish it from May until late October for years to come, gaining addition skill with each trip. As such Im looking at these three lakes and possibly Lac Seul. My wish list is low fishing pressure, safe boating, great casting opportunities throughout the season, scenic and, of course, great fishing. Any suggestions and first hand experiences would be greatly appreciated. Recommended lodges are a plus. Take care, Ruddiger"
2099929,Obabikon,2013-09-12 18:04:00,2370,"I'm going to suggest Mylie's Place out of Morson on Lake of the Woods. I would say my own resort, but it sounds like multiple and longer trips than is typical for our place. Anyhow, check out http://www.myliesplaceresort.com/"
2102297,pjshorthorn,2013-09-14 08:35:00,5654,"Lac Seul offers numerous options from boat in packages to houseboats to outposts.Depends on what section of the lake you want to consider, but the options are limitless and the wildlife and scenery are outstanding. We have fished the NE section of Lac Seul since the '60 and still haven't covered half the water.Leaving 9/21 for a 7 day trip to Lac Seul Outposts. Quiet in the fall, secluded and a class operation with all of the comforts of home.Good luck on your new adventure!!!!PJ"
2102657,Limeyangler,2013-09-14 11:50:00,563,"Hi, of your preferred choices i would recommend Lac Seul.....I have not fished the west end of Eagle or LOTW, oh....by the way I live on Wabigoon Lake."
2104601,scar,2013-09-15 15:10:00,196,"Lac Seul with out a doubt, big eyes and lots of numbers. A 40'' inch or bigger pike every trip and although we don't fish for them, numerous sightings of 50'' + muskies following in our caught walleyes. Scenery is unbelievable. July - October very little pressure or others to deal with. NE end is my recommendation - We find new spots every year and fishing is ALWAYS consistent!"
2104913,Ruddiger,2013-09-15 17:42:00,649,"Howdy, With all of the recommendations for Lac Seul for fishing I was wondering if someone could recommend a resort. Since muskies are my main target it sounds like I need to be on the northeast portion of the system. Unfortunately the only camps I can find are Lac Seul Outposts and Moosehorn. Are there any other camps in that area that would put me close to the northeastern sections of the system? Take care, Ruddiger"
2105578,Limeyangler,2013-09-16 06:21:00,563,"both of those get excellent reviews on here. I know that Ben Beattie who is a musky maniac with many plus 55"" guides out of Moosehorn and the legendary Musky mama is also connected to that operation, If i was after musky i would be checking out Moosehorn for sure."
2105594,Bill Krejca,2013-09-16 06:34:00,6107,LOW for muskies is a preferred location for many muskie nuts. Both Mylies and Obabikon are good choices. Bill
2109138,2746,2013-09-17 13:53:00,3206,With muskies being high on your list I would agree with Bill about LOTW but would add eagle to my list as well.....really good Muskie fishing on vermilion bay of eagle lake. We have fished the western portion of Lac Seul and while we enjoy the walleye there muskies are scarce. Eastern portion may be different. That's just our experience.
2109210,Mike Kansas,2013-09-17 14:20:00,1463,If i were targeting Muskie I would go to LOTW. Check out Sandys Blackhawk Island Mike Kansas
