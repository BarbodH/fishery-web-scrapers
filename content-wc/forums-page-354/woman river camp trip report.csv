2131561,lcwhit,2013-09-27 08:05:00,104,jim was that 80/day?
2133521,Guest,2013-09-28 08:45:00,0,"About 6 days of fishing for 6 guys/80 walleye is only a little over 2 walleyes per person per day. Doesn't seem to be ""Hot"" fishing. Guess we need more details on actual numbers of everything to get a good read on this camp in September."
2134193,v-bay gord,2013-09-28 16:34:00,3168,"I want to know what went on in the ""odd house""....??!!"

I have never stayed at either in the 8 trips to Canada.Anyone else at WRC or at South Shore?We target smallmouth first but just really like to catch fish.The South Shore posts that I have found are all pretty old.Thanks, Mike"
2140977,Basser,2013-10-01 20:35:00,31,That sounds like very poor fishing. Was that your 1st time to the area?
