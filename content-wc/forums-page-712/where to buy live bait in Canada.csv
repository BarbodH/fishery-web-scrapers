555756,Guest,2006-03-29 20:23:00,0,I am going up to fish the northern Ottowa river again this year and don't want to bring my own again. It just seems from all the new posts I have read it just may be easier to buy it there. I will be crossing the 1000 island bridge into Canada then west on 401 then up 41 to Pembroke and then north on 17 to Deep River. Anyone been up in this area and bought live bait in bulk. we used to bring two pounds of leeches and a flat of worms with us but now things have changed. And we have decided to buy these on the way up if we can. Help if you can.
