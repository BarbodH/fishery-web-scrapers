555874,Trailerguy,2006-03-31 20:40:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Ice out is obviously tied to water temperature. At a given temp. spawning occurs, lenght of the spawning period also may be tied to temp. Post spawn the fish start to move to summer haunts. Exactly where the majority of the fish will be in June will likely be tied to water temp., water level, and the food source. How much warm rain falls in May is probably equal or more important than ice out. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"

555888,Guest,2006-04-01 12:39:00,0,"Trailerguy is right on. Water temperature is the key. What happens following ice off is more important. If it stays cold and wet after the ice goes off, water temperatures will not warm much. Things could be pretty normal for opening of fishing. However, if an unseasonably warm stretch hits, the seasonal progression of events will move forward much more quickly and the location of fish will be different. In such case, you'll find them where you'd normally find them in late spring or early summer. (Deeper, on structure, relating to weeds, etc.)"
