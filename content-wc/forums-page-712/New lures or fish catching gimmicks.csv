No problem with Pike bite offs and the walleye eat em up. Developed by a fireman out of Oshkosh this is the real deal. He just introduced a rattle harness that is catching a ton of attention."

555536,Guest,2006-03-23 17:49:00,0,"Tried using a trolling spoon blank ahead of my crawler harnesses as sort of a flasher. Something I read about in maybe in-fisherman. Only problem was pike biting the rig off right behind/ahead of the spoon blank, and some tangling if the rig was left to fall straight down. Working on some mods for this year to pike-proof it since at times it did seem to get more walleye takes than normal harnesses run in the same boat. Anyone ever run a crawler harness behind a dodger on smaller water in the great north?"

We would love to get to your place, but that's pretty much impossible since I bought my own camp. Thanks for the advice, I'll deffinately be trying that rig this summer. Hope to see you in the future! -Dan"

555545,orchard frank,2006-03-23 21:40:00,1900,"Two techniques slightly out of the norm that have worked very well for me on Lac Seul are large tubes on light jigs, and jigging spoons. My best tubes were pumpkinseed (yellowish) about 4"". I think that slow swimming/gliding action will get hits when other stuff slows way down. Fergie spoons and Hopkins or Rattle Snakies are great at times on deep reefs. In Aug. at times, fishing the deep edge of offshore reefs with this presentation has been unbelieveable. Fairly aggressive motion 1-2',semi-controlled drop, almost always hit on the pause or drop."

Only problem I see is that I will have to add another tackle box to gear up for these techniques. Keep them coming guys, it will only add to the enjoyment of our favorite sport..Walleye Fishing.

555558,Hawker,2006-03-24 09:33:00,3967,"Just found something this week that got my interest up. Pretty much looks as if it was designed for bass, but with an alteration or two I'm thinking it'll work well for eyes too. It's called a chatterbait, pretty new out but looks interesting. Found their website just using ""chatterbait"" on a google search. If it won't work for eyes, I'm pretty sure the pike won't be able to leave it alone and the smallies will likely eat it up too. I've ordered a couple just to have and maybe modify for eye fishin on my annual trip up north this spring. Who knows, sure looks interesting! Hawker"

555521,Mike Kansas,2006-03-23 14:55:00,1463,Hey guys its about time to get serious about Walleye Fishing ( my favorite sport). Anybody got any new lures or gimmicks that they like for catching the big girls? Its always fun to try something other than the old standbys. May you all have a great fishing season and a safe one.

555523,515,2006-03-23 15:09:00,254,I've been stuck in a rut for a long time with jigs. Good question i'd be curious to try something different or new if anyone has and ideas. Mike

555525,wooglin,2006-03-23 15:36:00,371,"I watched a fishing show this weekend on OLN (replayed on FSN), it was some pro. who was fishing Lac Seul, out of the Lost Island Lodge camp. He was jigging/rigging/slip bobber fishing for walleye. He was in about 25 feet of water. Couldn't tell what time of year, but he was spring/fall geared up. I know he went to Webster's Bay, as they showed him go under the bridge. Typically, we never fish over 15 feet as we never had any problems finding fish in the shallow stuff. That being said, I'll be trying deep stuff this year (likely with minnows too - we always use crawlers). Anyway, this year, I'll be trying the deeper water as I watched this guy pull up some big girls with all three tactics mentioned above. As for new gimmicks, I heard you can make a wireless network antena from a Pringles can? I might be trying that so I can share free internet with my pal on the next culdesac. Oh, wait a minute...that wasn't a fishing gimmick. Or was it? :)"

555526,Guest,2006-03-23 15:38:00,0,This is nothing new but it can be fun and different. Try flipping 1/4 oz weedless jigs with your favotite live bait on them into and around weed beds. Sounds like Bass Fishing but them Eyes taste a lot better. This has worked for me on several occasions. If you find some Eyes in this pattern they seem to be very aggressive. Guess they are up there having lunch and you get to show them your Blue Plate Special.

555534,Guest,2006-03-23 17:30:00,0,"I borrowed a technique from bass fisherman last season, modified it a bit and used it in several situations to turn fish that we couldn't catch with standard presentations. We were fishing mid lake humps during summer and marking lots of fish suspended 2- 3 ft. off the bottom and we weren't getting bit. I built what I call a modified drop shot rig. Instead of using a standard drop shot weight, I tied a 1/2 jig on the drop line and tied a #4 or #6 octopus hook with a palomar about 2 ft. above the jig. The rig worked with live bait or power minnows attached to the top hook. We still rigged the down jig with either straight plastic or live bait, but at times the top hook caught 90% of the fish. I also used this rig to try to determine how active deep water fish were. I rigged the bottom jig with oversized plastics on the big jig down low and a small live minnow on the top hook. When the fish were aggressive, I was surprised how many selected the oversized plastic. We experimented with 5"" Power minnows, power worms, and big tubes. The best production came on the big power minnows. When the fish were keying on big plastics low, we moved faster, covered water, and caught more big fish. When the top bait was hit more, we slowed down fished more vertically, and even though the fish were in a more neutral mood, still managed to pick up big fish on tiny minnows. I plan to experiment with this presentation more this coming season. Right now, I like this option for both 1)slightly suspended walleyes down deep and 2) as a sampling technique to determine how aggressive the walleyes are that day.
