I only fish the river but don't think you can beat it. Personal largest walleye is 8 lbs. Largest northern is 15 but I try not to catch them. Grandson and I were throwing spinner baits along the shoreline for smallmouth that time. We usually go to the lodge for supper at least once each time we are there. Food is great. Cabins have some age on them but seem in decent repair. I keep hearing people talk about Lount Lake, guess I will have to boat over there sometime and try it. If you go there, watch out for the logging trucks. Good Luck"

555669,superiorchuck,2006-03-26 20:42:00,1,My crew and I have camped at the campground and fished Seperation in late June. We did very well by running down river from the campground. Our most consistent spots were within view of the campground. You'll have a great time. Keep an eye out for those lower unit eating rocks.
555738,Eyesore,2006-03-29 11:00:00,455,"Ditto on the rocks. I saw many many that were a few inches under the surface, just waiting to eat your lower unit. Good luck"

He loves it, but it sounds like it may be changing ownership. Just what I heard, don't know for sure. Anyway, you won't be disappointed with the English River. Happy fishing. - Hawk"

554706,hawk82,2006-02-17 16:31:00,126,">Thanks for the reply Hawk. > >Bass Hunter No problem. As the season draws near i'm sure you will get more responses. I am heading to the Indian Lake Area in the spring. It's about 4 lakes East on the English River from where you'll be. Separation, Lount, Big Fox, Little Fox, then Indian (N) & Grassy (S)...in that order. Found a hole on Lount that produce hundreds of fish in 4 days of fishing it."

I think he visits this board, so bring this topic up a little closer to ""ice out""."
554742,voyaguer,2006-02-20 20:55:00,54,"Separation Lake Close enough to Lount you can fish all the way up to Muskeg if you like. Typical spots towards Lount are 400 hole, Merry go round Island, Seymore pinch, wolf point, several reefs, inner channel, reef bay, all depends on time of year and they move around alot, but there are usually alot of fish there. The past 7-8 years the fishing has changed a little up there, I think maybe due to the warming of the seasons. If ice goes out as early as suspected this spring, then it may be interesting, but hopefully, not disappointing. Separation lake Lodge is ok. Stayed there. Understand its for sale. Is somewhat protected from others as it is a little remote for a drive to. Beware, road in can be rough. Guides there will often take you to the River near the Campground which produces well even thought there are more people there. A ways down the river is Kettle Falls, run by Halleys, they have several camps on Umpreyville. Generally the English river is good. My theory is schools move up and down the river and where it is slow one day it can by very good the next. Being in the current is safest bet. Small mouth were down a few years ago, but have come back. Have seen several 40"" + northerns. Biggest, in weight, about 20 # true. Kind you see on the TV shows as ""another 30# northern"". Mostly jig fish for walley and cast typical lures for northern. As alway, mepps for bass is as good as any. You'll do fine there"
