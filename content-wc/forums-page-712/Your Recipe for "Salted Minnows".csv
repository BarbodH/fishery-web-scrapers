In other words, can you purchase these months ahead of time and feel reasonably assured that they will remain ""fresh"" until you are ready to use them? Or would it be advisable to freeze them to maintain their ""freshness""?"
555707,Guest,2006-03-28 11:22:00,0,"They come shipped in a bag with some fake ice, which had long since reached room temp by the time my minnows arrived on a hot summer day. Minnows were fine, however, and they sure are packed in plenty of salt. I then separated them into several bags and froze them, which would be my preference for long term storage. One of my friends has some leftover minnows from last August that have been in his garden shed since then. Don't know if he's opened the bag yet to check on them. Maybe he'll post and let you know how his fared over the winter. John"
555715,dave10,2006-03-28 15:22:00,342,"This is an interesting thread. Anyone care to weigh in on a comparison of salted minnows versus plastics like gulp bait? I had planned to stock up on gulp, but this has me rethinking that plan. Thanks. Dave"
555724,Guest,2006-03-28 17:34:00,0,"May of 05' compared salted minnows to gulp on Rainy Lake during cold water conditions with my fishing partner and we found that the walleyes hit the gulp about 3-1 and also, hit harder. This was during cold water conditions and the bite was not very good. No, I don't work for berkley, but I will not be messing around with salted minnows anymore."
555726,Guest,2006-03-28 18:49:00,0,The Borax trick sounds intriguing. We do almost exclusively catch and release . . . is the Borax toxic to fish that eat minnows treated with it?
555728,Guest,2006-03-28 21:14:00,0,"My friend referenced above with the minnows still in the garden shed uses Gulp. Maybe he'll post. As for me, I used a jig with a 4"" twister, and when the going got a little slow, I'd tip it with a minnow. Didn't notice a big difference, but I think the salted minnows might pick up the pace a little. John"
555735,Fred_G,2006-03-29 08:38:00,908,I just went out and checked the salted minnows that I have had in an old cooler in the shed since last fall. They are just fine yet. I see no change in color or odor in them. In my comparison last year between the salted minnows and Gulp I thought the Gulp was just as good or better. It will be interesting to try the same comparison this year to see if the results are similiar.
555652,pfg1,2006-03-26 01:19:00,52,"I fish Canada twice each summer. I heard about ""salted minnows"" from someone who used them with great success in remote parts of Canada where live minnows would be impossible to carry into camp. Do you have a recipe? Thanks, DAVID, [email protected]"
555655,LUCKWI,2006-03-26 08:51:00,13,"We have been trying differnt recipes over the years and have found that Borax(yes,20 mule team laundry soap!} works as good as anything. Take your minnows and pour them out onto a window screen to drain the water off. Then put somne in a ziplock bag(we put about 50}.Pour in some borax and shake them up to coat the minnows. We then freeze them..When we need them we take out a bag for the boat. We found that when they thaw they stay soft and pliable similar to a fresh minnow. We found that salt makes them tough and stiff due to the moisture being sucked out of them by the salt Good Luck"
555657,Guest,2006-03-26 10:23:00,0,"I second the last post,the borax leaves the minnows looking the ""freshest"". the salt does work but the minnows do get tough and shrink. I went through 50 dz. borax minnows myself in lac seul last year as a see if it works type of thing and caught as many fish if not more and it was way cheaper. Can't wait til Memorial Day."
555660,Roddy,2006-03-26 11:37:00,488,"We have used a 50-50 mix of salt and sugar. I would place minnows in a 5 gallon bucket and pour the mixture over them and then add another layer of minnows followed by pouring another layer of salt-sugar. then leave them sit for a day or two and rinse using a window screen, place in zip lock bags and put in the freezer. The sugar seemed to give the minnows a rubbery texture. I have never tried the Borax. If the scent does not bother the fish it seems as though that method may be easier as you have a lot of slime to rinse off with the salt-sugar mixture"
555667,Airkiller2,2006-03-26 18:48:00,4,How much Borax to a bag? Is it a gallon or quart bag? AK2
555673,RANGER,2006-03-26 22:13:00,4341,"We do it similarly. I use about 50 - 70 minnows in a gallon freezer bag. I then fill it half full of Borax and fully shake the bag to cover them completely. I then re-fill the bag until it is 3/4 full. Evacuate as much air as you can - I DON'T recommend a vacuum sealer for this particular application. Let them stand for some hours (like five or six) and then freeze them! If the bag reswells before you are ready to put them in the freezer, then evacuate it again. When you take them out of the freezer, thaw them, remove the extra Borax and rinse them. At this point you can re-freeze them and pack them to Canada or anywhere else you go with just a slight coating of Borax - or USE them straight away!! Works GREAT!!"
555679,Guest,2006-03-27 07:30:00,0,"And if you don't want the hassle of making them, you can buy them reasonably in bulk at this website.... http://www.bestbait.com/index.html"
555699,FlyBoy,2006-03-27 23:32:00,631,"We used salted minnows from best bait (I believe) last year on Lac Seul... We did the math on them, and we couldn't buy live minnows at home and kill them for the price we paid. And they are packaged in nice little bags. One tip if you make your own, DON'T make big bags with tons of minnows in them. They start getting 'old' before you use the whole bag. Make more smaller bags so you can grab a new one once in a while. Good luck, -John"
555702,Larry S,2006-03-28 09:02:00,666,JohnN What size are the medium and large minnows? And what size did you use? Thanks Larry S
555704,Guest,2006-03-28 09:34:00,0,"Larry, I only tried the Medium salted, 8# bulk (approx 1200) for $35. They'd be around 2"" long or so. Rebagged them & split the bag with 3 other guys, worked out to be plenty for our week in Canada. The folks at their 800 number will be helpful as to size of the large salted minnows. John"
