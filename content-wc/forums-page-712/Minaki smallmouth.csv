555563,Guest,2006-03-24 13:38:00,0,Going to be in Minaki the last week of July and wanted to try to catch some smallmouth. Have fished there for walleyes and tried to catch some smallies but didn't have much luck. Wondering if anyone could help me out on some areas I might try or is this a bad time of year to be targeting smallies? Thanks.

555564,Guest,2006-03-24 14:09:00,0,"I don't fish for smallmouth bass as a rule. That time of year there under our dock. Rough rock narrows has a healthy population of smallies with a good chance of a bonus musky. I've done a lot of diving with just a mask and flippers and without a wet suit I stick to the warmer waters and shallow flats . That's where I see lots, but not the one over 3 pounds . Bigger go deeper , and try the rough rock narrows area. Big ones in there"

555566,Guest,2006-03-24 14:28:00,0,The last week of July isn't the ideal time of year for smallmouth as far as I'm concerned but you can easily catch them on that river system that time of year. You will find them around just about any island or submerged rock structure. If your staying In Minaki I would suggest going up to big Sand and fishing around all the islands up that way. Unless your fishing early morning or late evening you will need to go a little deeper. I like working tube jigs and senkos. That area is very under-rated as far as smallmouth fishing goes so when you slay em keep it a secret will ya.

555636,Guest,2006-03-25 12:57:00,0,"My partner and I fish almost exclusively for smallies at Minaki, although we go in mid-June to the first week of July. Even so, the smallie action will still be pretty good in late July. We've had days where we've caught 100 to 150 smallies in a day around the time you'll be there. Here's a tip that is always good for some smallies at Minaki. Stop at every day marker or bouy that you see, and cast to the shallow rocks that are near by. (I've won several smallmouth tournaments doing that, on water system's I wasn't familiar with.) Except for an occassional walleye angler, most bouys and hazard markers tend to be avoided and the smallies seem to be nearby. Be careful of the rocks and hazards in the area. The smallies will generally be in a little deeper water by the time you are there, so a heavier green-pumpkin, tube will work well. Also a #7 to #9 shad rap in Baby Bass or original crawdad color will provide lots of action--cast it out and quickly get it to dive to the max depth and then finish the retrieve with a slower and erratic retrieve. They will be most active early and late, so take some rebel Pop-r's (baby bass) and Tiny Torpedos (frog color) for fantastic smallie action at these times. If you get hit with a nasty cold front, you can still catch smallies by casting lighter weighted 'smallie beavers' or shaky head 4"" worms and letting them slowly fall against cover. Green pumpkin, browns and whites seem to be the best for these presentations. It will be hotter than heck in late-July -- it was almost unbearable when we were there in early-august a couple years ago during the big fire south of Minaki. We hit the water as the sun was coming up and worked favorite rockpiles for some decent topwater action in the early morning until about 10, and then did some serious tube and cranking on the shorelines til' about noon. We then came in, ate and took a siesta. We got back up around 5 and ate supper and went back out for smallies then. The topwater and tube action will pickup again around this time, and the temps will be a little more bearable. The smallies will be active til' about 11 pm, and then will quickly fall off, and that's when we headed back in. Big smallies can be found in Rough Rock, Little Sand and Big Sand. However, if you really want lots of smallies, I suggest going South of Minaki and working the river islands around The Big Stretch, MacFarlane River, and Black Sturgeon River. If there is any decent weed growth around the islands on the river, they will usually be in the weeds or on the outside edge that time of year. Chuck"
