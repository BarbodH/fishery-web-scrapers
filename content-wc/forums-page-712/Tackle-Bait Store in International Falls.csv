555732,rpieske,2006-03-28 23:16:00,1276,"Well, we arrived back in St. Louis at 5:30 pm this evening. Our new grandson, Maximiliano Fau Pieske was born nearly 7 weeks early by C-section at 5:31 pm. Both mother and baby are doing well. The baby will probably have to stay a couple of weeks in the hospital, but they expect him to do fine. He is very active, breathing well and all his vital signs are excellent. Max is 4 1/2 lbs. and 17"" long. Black curly hair and a chin like Kirk Douglas. Thanks to all for the prayers."
555733,Hawker,2006-03-29 06:52:00,3967,"Great news Bob, glad to hear they are doing fine. In just a few years he'll be goin fishin with ya!! Congrats, and glad all is well! Hawker"
555562,Hawker,2006-03-24 12:19:00,3967,"Pretty sure someone here on WC is an International Falls resident, need to get some info if I can. Although I always remind myself to write down the name and address etc of a tackle store there in IF, I never seem to do so. It is located behind and west of a large gas station and there is a liquor store right next door to the south of the gas station. It's right on Route 53 there in town and north of the Voyageurs Motel a block or two. The tackle/bait store is tucked behind and between the gas station and liquor store. Any chance I could get the name, address and phone number for this place from a WC'er up that way?? Would certainly appreciate the info if it could be provided. A GPS cord would work too! Thanks in advance for any assistance!! Hawker"

555570,Hawker,2006-03-24 15:31:00,3967,"Bob Pieske: Thank you sir, I do most certainly appreciate the info. I'm going to copy and paste this in with my other Canada trip info so I won't lose it. Every year I come up, we always stop there because he just seems to be a nice guy and always has some good tips for us when we stop in. I've tried to tell several local friends that go up where to stop but never seem to have the name or address for them and it's easy to drive by and miss. On another note, am pretty sure I've seen that you stay around Nestor Falls from around mid May on, is that correct? I'll be up there the end of May into the first week of June, would like maybe to meet up at least once for a cup of Java and a howdy if'n that would meet with your approval as well. Thank you again Hawker"

555647,rpieske,2006-03-25 17:19:00,1276,"Hawker: Don't forget Sportman's Service, also in International Falls. It's the blue building on the left about 6 blocks closer to the bridge. They have a nice tackle shop and are really swell guys. Yes, I am normally in Nestor Falls by the 15th of May. This year I'll be a little later because my son and daughter-in-law are having their first baby around that time. I may not be up till June 1st. If you are still there, I'd enjoy meeting with you. Send me an email right before you leave for Canada and I'll give you my phone number in Nestor FAlls. Hope you have a great season."

555664,rpieske,2006-03-26 14:24:00,1276,"Hawker: Just got a call from my son and he had to take my daughter-in-law in to the hospital. She started bleeding and contractions. She is still about 6 and half weeks out. They have her on an IV to stop the contractions and the bleeding has stopped. My wife and I are packing up and leaving Florida in the morning. The baby is doing fine, but they would like to have a couple more weeks before delivery. This will be our third grandchild, my son's first. I know the kids will feel better if my wife is there. She is the take charge, ""get'r done,"" one in the family. Fortunately, my daughter is there to be with them until we get home. Keep us all in your prayers."
