Anyone else try this and come up with the same results? Just want to make sure its not with my computer or something."

555885,tly,2006-04-01 11:20:00,1900,"I use this instead of mapquest in many instances for locating or trip planning. I have not seen a problem that acute although the remote areas do not always have fine telemetry that urban or more populous areas have. A use I have found is locating from the sat-photo a specific structure, drill in on it and then save the GPS coordinates. This does work well. As a proof of correctness I took several of the LacSeul waypoints from my GPS (skidoo, scalar #7 etc) and zeroed in on each with google, getting very close comparisons. I now have a bunch from various areas."
555887,Guest,2006-04-01 12:34:00,0,"Thanks for the replies. If its not to much to ask, would someone please type in andy myers lodge ontario or whitesands camp ontario and see what markers show up? The markers seem to be way off. Thanks"
555889,tly,2006-04-01 14:42:00,1900,"Found 0 White Sands and 2 Andy Myers #1 Vermillion Bay 48.41.06.51 x 93.47.02.22 #2 39 Rd E Eagle Lake 45.13.48.73 x 78.32.40.95 Vermillion bay is horrible definition, Eagle Lake is pretty good TLY"
555890,grt1,2006-04-01 15:01:00,259,"When I go for Eagle Lake, it always seems to take me to Eastern Part of Ontario, but for my area I have to go to Dryden then scroll west until i recognize my landmarks. I am condo shopping in the Winnipeg area so I use this to get a quick overview of the areas the realtor is sending me the information on. this is a handy tool for me saves a bundle in gas for exploration visits."
555892,Guest,2006-04-01 16:03:00,0,Yes I like this tool to look at different lakes. I use the measure tool to tell the distance from the camp i may be staying at to the spots that i will fish. Gives me a idea of the amount of gas i may use during the week. And gives me a good picture of the lake and islands for navigation. Ever wonder what would happen if your GPS went out while on a large Lake? I have found myself depending on it way to much. Just lazy i guess:) I was just a little disapointed with the search feature for camps and lodges for location. But not that big a deal since i have a map of camps location that i got from freemap.com Thanks. PS have you found the GPS numbers to be accurate?
