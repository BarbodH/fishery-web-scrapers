555423,Lovetofish,2006-03-16 16:00:00,458,Never been there. I know someone who does fish there and likes it. http://www.presslake.on.ca/
555443,pfg1,2006-03-19 01:48:00,52,"I fished there in June 2005 for one week. Caught lots of eyes and pike under the slot. It is part of the English River system. Accomodations were very nice with a great dock area a short walk fromt the cabins. I will go back again. I recommend hiring a guide and fishing Lake Trout in nearby Wintering Lake. I ran out of time to do this but heard it is quite fun. The WED community shore lunch is a nice touch. I highly recommend Press Lake Camp. Tight Lines, DAVID"
555476,Guest,2006-03-20 21:37:00,0,I was there in 2001. Accomodations were excellant. Walleye fishing was great in numbers but no monsters. Pike were mostly on the small size. We did catch & release 2 smallies over 6 lbs. All in all the week spent there was very nice. Nice remote place without a lot of competitive fishing pressure. Also very inexpensive. I just need BIGGER water for me! Best Fishes ! ggg
555483,Guest,2006-03-21 13:23:00,0,"My father used to take me camping there in the late 70's with 83 being the last time we went until four years ago. This year will be our fifth in a row and all of us are counting the days until we leave (73 to be exact). To be short they have nice accomodations, are affordable, and myself and everyone in my party thinks the walleye fishing is pretty darn good. I also believe they have a really good return rate of customers every year because we see the same groups every year. Long winded opinion(mostly because I've been thinking about the trip for the last month and can't wait to get up there) The only other Canadian lake I've been to is LOW and that was once. From my experience (other than the Muskie fishing which Press doesn't have) the walleye fishing on LOW doesn't even compare to Press. Now I'm by no means an expert angler but we could catch our limits (barely) after a few days on LOW when others at the camp were coming in with nothing or hardly anything. On Press, we are on vacation, and we're up there to relax. We don't make it out on the water until 9 or so every morning and are usually the last group to leave camp. But even then we have still caught between 15 (slowest ever) and 100 (best) walleye per person per day. Once we found the good spots I'd say the average is 40 fish per person per day. Like others have said, this is more a numbers lake and isn't really a trophy lake. The average walleye we catch are between 15 and 18 inches which if you ask me are the perfect eaters. Usually the largest fish per person per week averages 23 inches or so. The largest walleye anyone of us have caught in 4 years was 26 inches. Then there's Hut lake which you can get to from Press on the Grassy river. Last year was our first year up there and we thought the fish ran larger but you didn't catch as many. In four years we still haven't fished a lot of Press. But every year we try and find new spots, not because we have to, but just because we like to explore new areas. Most of the northern we catch catch tend to run on the smaller side, but we've only fished for them a few times in the four years. Although a couple nice fish above the upper slot (around 40"") have been caught over the years while fishing for walleye. Hut lake is supposed to have larger northern? If you have any questions I'd be happy to answer them."
555494,mdgretz,2006-03-22 07:32:00,3,"flowagefish... 73 days! Is that the week of May 27th to June 3rd? That's when I'll be at Press again, in Cabin 5. Are you my neighbor? I concur with everything you said about Press. We love it up there, have been going for about 10 years, and will keep going back. We find Press at that time of year to be a jig and minnow bite, or a spinner and minnow if you want to cover more water faster. Twister tail optional ... sometimes the fish like them and sometimes the guy next to you without one will outfish you. Kept trying worms and leeches for the first 5 years or so, but finally conceded that they just don't do as well that time of year. So now all we worry about is having enough minnows. LOL - every year someone in our cabin brings a NEW super duper plastic minnow-like tail (Powerbait, Gulp, Living Eye Minnows, etc.) to try to cut down on live minnow expense, and it never works but is good for a few laughs. Of course there is always the annual ""how many walleyes can you catch on one minnow"" contest. Current record is 17 eyes on the same minnow, or parts of the same minnow (not much left after the first dozen walleyes get done with it). Exactly what cabin and what week will you be at Press? Mike Gretz Montezuma, Iowa Cabin #5"
555501,kbkakes,2006-03-22 13:07:00,49,"We use salted minnows in Ontario year after year. Buy them localy in Mid to late May (before they spawn out)Salt them ourselves. They work just about as good, and stay on longer, easy to pack and keep. Kevin"
555503,Guest,2006-03-22 14:06:00,0,"Mike, Unfortunately, it looks like we'll be up there the week after you (but I should probably email Barb and make sure). We've always been the first week of June cabin #7, and will be there June 3rd to June 10th. For some reason a couple years ago I remember talking to some fellows in cabin 5 that were from Iowa whose party had shrunk in size. Have you always gone the same week? Although I won't be there, my grandpa's cousin, David Seavert (the person my dad and I rediscovered Press Lake from) and his buddies, will be there the week you will be. I'm not sure what cabin or what kind of boats or vehicles they'll be driving but they will have Wisconsin License plates. I'm also not sure how long they've been going. But they've always gone that week except for two years as far as I know. He said his group decided to try a fly-in some place else but said the fishing was better at Press Lake. Then it took another year to get back to the same week as before. It sure is a small world! Believe it or not I know where Montezuma is and I live 275 miles away in Fort Atkinson, WI! In fact, I drive through it probably every other month. My wife's family is from New Sharon and Oskaloosa and we go there quite a few times a year. I agree 100% on the minnow and jig. The first year we brought along a flat of night crawlers but they only caught a very small fraction of the fish minnows did. It's funny you mention the contest with the minnows. We don't have a contest (maybe this year we will though?) but we reuse minnows as much as possible, basically until you can't get them to stay on the hook. If we have a fish hooked and we see the minnow fly off we scoop up the minnow with the net before the fish. It's funny hearing my uncle in the boat next to us say, get the net, my minnow flew off! even though there's an 18 inch walleye hooked. Amazing that minnows looks like ground beef and the walleye still bite it but won't hardly touch anything else. Also amazing is with the mangled minnows we STILL go through 6 to 8 dozen a day. Chad Strommen"
555514,mdgretz,2006-03-23 07:16:00,3,"Kevin... I've thought a lot about the salted minnow trick, but so far haven't gotten up the ambition to do it. What's your method? Chad... I don't know if the group that follows us in Cabin 5 is from Iowa or not. We're always gone before they arrive. We've had Cabin 5 the last week of May for about 7 years now. I don't think anyone in our group would have made the statement that our group is shrinking. We always have a full cabin of 12-14 people - Cabin 5 has seven bedrooms! How do you like Cabin 7? The NEW cabin (I guess it will always be the NEW cabin until they build another one). If you can find out what cabin your cousin David will be in, I will be sure to stop over and say hello. Wow! It IS a small world. New Sharon is basically in our back yard ... the next small town, about 10 miles away.""If we have a fish hooked and we see the minnow fly off we scoop up the minnow with the net before the fish."" Exactly!!! Mike"
555572,kbkakes,2006-03-23 13:37:00,49,Mike This works real good. I use zip-lock sandwich bags. Put in two dozen per bag. They dont look that great when you hook them but once they are in the water they look normal. Hookem right thru the head instead of the lip....Good luck...

555750,Guest,2006-03-29 16:43:00,0,"Mike, I guess it was another group but I know they were from Iowa. Cabin 7 is nice. It sleeps six with a possible 7th person on the futon. It's a lot nicer than one I stayed in on Lake of the Woods that's for sure. I'm not sure how it compares to the other cabins at Press? If I talk to David before he goes I'll tell him to stop by and say high. But I'm not sure if I'll see him before we all leave? Whenever I go to Iowa I always want to bring a pole along but haven't yet. This winter we stopped by my wife's aunt's place. She has a house with a pond south of New Sharon and I was going to hit her up to see if could fish it. I was also thinking trying below the dam in Pella. Do you know of any good lakes/rivers/ponds for shore fishing around New Sharon or Oskaloosa? Chad"
