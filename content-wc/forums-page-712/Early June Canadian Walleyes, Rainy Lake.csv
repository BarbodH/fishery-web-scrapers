555191,Guest,2006-03-05 13:40:00,0,"You can find walleye in any of there spring locations where they spawn. open bays with river or creek outlets, look for them in the weeds or channels, usually never have to to go any deeper the say 13 ft."

Any experienc here. I'll be trolling that area in the moonlight come early June. Tips suggestions would be much appreciated. If you have any dynomite locations and don't feel comfortable shouting them out over this blog, email at [email protected] I've caught a few walleye's over the last 2 decades up dere on Canadian Rainy but never really had that fast and ferious spring action you here about. I think this is the year though. Thanks friends, Captain Oban"

I've fished at nite on rainy before when one of my clients wanted to catch bigger fish then most of the males we were catching during the daylight hours. Look for weedys spots in the 10-12 ft range outside of mcdonalds inlet and northwest bay, they are dotted all over he map."
555407,Guest,2006-03-15 16:51:00,0,"Live Bait on jigs at night in that area, or trolling stickbaits, crankbaits? Is there any presence of Walleye on the western side of the North Arm. I haven't seen it, only Northerns. What water temperatures have you found promote Walleye activity this time of year. Anyway to get big spawning Females to bite, or is the action limited to the males this time of year?"
