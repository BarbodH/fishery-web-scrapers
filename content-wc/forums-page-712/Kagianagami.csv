He really likes trout fishing, which I enjoy but I'm more of a walleyer/piker at heart. I've heard mixed opinions about it concerning the walleye/pike fishing, from really good to really difficult. Any bit of info greatly appreciated."

555643,Crede,2006-03-25 16:09:00,134,"Have fished Kag in May/early June. Fished primarily for walleye and caught both good numbers and size. Will go back. By reputation, has excellent walleye fishing throughout the year. Has lake trout in it, and tons of good-looking pike water - but didn't fish for either, so can't comment. Brook trout are in the river which drains Kag to the Albany, but looked to take a little effort to get to them. Therefore, I highly recommend Kag as flyin for walleye - can't really comment on the rest. Note - went with Leuenbergers out of Nakina. I highly recommend them. Several other outfitters have cabins on Kag, but it is pretty big and you only see others occassionally. Let me know if you want more details."
555681,Guest,2006-03-27 08:46:00,0,"Hi Crede, Thanks for the reply. A couple questions come to mind. One, we're looking at staying with an outfitter whose cabin is on the north end of the lake, so was wondering if you knew anything about the fishing up that way? Second, how bad are the navigation hazards? We don't go crazy but do lik to move around some. Also, what sort of techniques/approaches have proven effective for 'eyes. Thanks"
555684,Guest,2006-03-27 12:41:00,0,AWO outpost is on the North part of Kag. Ck with them. You won't be sorry. www.awonakina.com or 807-329-5812. Ask for Remi or Christine.
555696,Crede,2006-03-27 21:55:00,134,"North_Alabama - 1)In late May/early June have fished for walleye primarily at south end of lake (where water entered) and at small river (Van Poole) at mid-east side of lake. South end approx. 25-30 min. ride from north end, Van Poole approx. 20 min. ride. Usually fish at north end in the evenings - fewer numbers but good size. 2)Many islands of different size (at least 100) scattered throughout with tons of structure - certainly looks like many prime walleye places to fish as season progresses. 3)No real navigation hazards to worry about (i.e. boat-harming kind). However, lake is big enough with with enough islands that it would seem easy to get turned around - I take a hand-held GPS - and would suggest at least a compass/map. 4)Western part of Kag is a separate huge bay with many islands - looks like some good pike water, but I've not spent any time there looking for them. 5)Walleye techniques - We primarily use jig (1/4 to 3/8 oz) with Powergrub (3"") tail. Occassionally troll shad rap, reef runner, or wally diver. Works great - never tried anything else at Kag. Let me know if I can help with any other info. Crede"
