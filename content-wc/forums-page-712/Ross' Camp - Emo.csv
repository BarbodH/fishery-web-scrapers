The muskies and Lakers in Pipestone are supposedly very big, I caught a 30 lb muskie a stones throw from Ross's and have seen a few more. Like the previous post said, there are lots of other lakes within a short drive as well."
555870,Guest,2006-03-31 17:22:00,0,The Clearwater chain is not really a great walleye fishery. It has some decent smally fishing though. If you are after walleye I would look at Lac Seul for a drive in.

We boat in from the main camp to one of their outpost cabins - both about a 30 mile trip. Jackfish outpost is the larger of the 2, and sits on a level, sandy spit of land. Ottertail outpost sits on a rocky ridge overlooking 2 lakes. There is a lot of climbing up and down the ridge at this camp - I don't reccomend it for anyone with mobility problems. The cabins are about 2 miles apart. The fishing can be really good - walleye, northern, and great smallmouth. The owners of the camp - Pat and Wayne Howard, are great people. Very concientiece, great boats and motors, and the cabins at the main camp look very nice and clean. I'm getting married this summer, and can't make the trip, but I sure wish I could!! If you talk to them, tell them the Baxter's say Hi."
