555628,Rich B,2006-03-24 21:50:00,1081,"Last weekend I was up at the Cleveland Sports Show and visited with several Canadian lodge/camp owners. Years ago I spent a week at the ""French River Lodge"" and the week was just ""ok"". Met the new owner and several of his regular customers that go up to the ""Lunge Lodge"" every year - looked like it could be very good fishing (especially for eastern Ontario) in this area of the French River. Has anyone been up to Lunge Lodge since '99 or 2000, when the camp changed ownership (and has new lodge boats, etc). It's a boat-in camp, and looks clean with new docks, etc; though I'm more interested in the fishing. Was told it has good walleye, large & smallmouth bass, musky and pike fishing in this stretch of the French River. Your comments (good or bad) would be appreciated. Am considering this camp for a ""guys week"" (we'd bring in our own rigs). Thanks, Rich B"

One guy went there every year for many years and complained about the poor or difficult fishing. His father or brother selected the destination. Another friend went there with his wife for one trip. He said the area was beautiful, but the fishing was poor. Please do not let this discourage you - they may have gone to a different location and the one you are checking on may be great. I just wanted to offer this information to you for what it may be worth. Check out the place and get references - it may be wonderful. best wishes, O F"
555676,RANGER,2006-03-26 23:45:00,4341,"To be honest with you, we fished that area for many - many years. Went past the ""Lunge"" nearly every day. Really a nice place. BUT - the fishing severly declined over the years - SEVERLY !! We left the French for other areas and haven't been there for about five years now. The problem is/was that there are no ""limits"" for the water so the fish got fished out - really poor fishing! We went for DAYS without even a hit - no matter the presentation. Started fishing for anything we could get!! I understand that ""limits"" have been put in place and the ""Fisherie"" is coming back - BUT I ALSO understand that - IT ISN'T BACK YET - NOT AT ALL!! Your call! But, I would check with more folks, here at WC, before dropping the bucks to go there unless you want to swim on the ""Shield"" like I did in the ""Med""!! :cheers:"
555693,Guest,2006-03-27 18:18:00,0,"Ohio Fisherman & Ranger, Thanks for the comments....I had fished the lower French River years ago and found it poorer fishing (at least the week I was up there), though thought it was a beautiful area. The Lunge Lodge is located in the Upper French River, and after hearing about the new limits/restrictions, etc thought that the fishing was good. Doesn't sound like it's made a full recovery quite yet, so will wait another year or three before considering heading back up to the French (will line up another lodge for this year). Appreciate your info ! Thanks again, Rich B"
555710,Guest,2006-03-28 12:50:00,0,"I guess it depends what you call ""poor fishing"". We've gone at the end of May to the French River Lodge on the lower French since the mid 90's. We are fishing mostly for pike, since we have great walleye fishing at home. We have averaged about 125 pike for 3.5 days for 4-5 guys. Alot are small, but we did have an 8lb last year, and a 10 lb the year before. They instituted a slot limit several years ago, and I think we have seen the evidence that it is improving. I guess too, it depends on your ultimate goal. We are going to get away from work, etc, and we have several in our group that live down south that we only get to see every year on this trip, drink some brews etc.....we've had a great time and I would recommend it .....
