I mainly pull crawler harnesses, which tend to run in a straight line. Spoons and cranks wobble, but generally run in straight lines as well when trolled. Trout/Salmon and saltwater fisherman have many techniques/baits to put erratic action into their offerings, so I thought ""hmm, I wonder if, under the right conditions, walleye (and pike) might be susceptible to such a trolling presentation?"" Does anyone have any thoughts, ideas, suggestions, or am I likely wasting my time thinking along this line?"

Walleyes are ""usually"" not as aggressive, in fact trolling a little too fast, or a few feet higher or lower can be the diference between a strike or not. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
