We have our own boat but the kids are 7 and 10 so they would really like running warm water. They love to fish and do quite well. We have been to Bisco with success (I know most on here don't feel the same, but we have always done well there. Many fish in the 18-20 inch range.) Would most likely go first week of august. Any suggestions appreciated."

Hot and cold running water but no electricity except the fish cleaning hut. This is a small boat-in camp between Wawa and Chapleau. Nice walleye, smallmouth and pike. The lake is 13 miles long and has varied structure.It has a nice swimming beach and they welcome people bringing their own boats. Unmixed gas available at the camp."

About 20 years ago, myself, 2 brothers and a sister-in-traveled from Hawk Junction to milepost 210 on Oba Lake at Sonny-Bob Lodge. You threw your gear into a rail car. We brought in a 6 hp motor, groceries, tackle, beer and food. We put the motor on the camp boat. Best fishing for walleyes was on a bluebird day at noon fishing from the shore of an island-go figure! When its time to leave, you flag down the train, throw your gear in a rail car and ride back in a passenger car. Sonny-Bob Lodge has a website. You can do a google search and find it if interested. More than one resort along the rail line. Although we got on at Hawk Junction, you could get on the train at Sault St. Marie."
