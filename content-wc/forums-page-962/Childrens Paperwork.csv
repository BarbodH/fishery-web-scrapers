The photo ID should be a part of what you also bring for yourself and any of the boys. MOST IMPORTANT for the two boys taht are not you son is a letter from their parents, signed by both if there is any custody situstion, granting you permission to take them to Canada. This will prevent a possible major delay both entering Canada AND coming back to the States. Have a great time.."

And yes, even though we aren't separated or divorced, they still wanted a permission slip/letter from the non-accompanying spouse. Also have phone numbers of all concerned available. They looked over the permission slips, looked at birth certs. and checked photocopies of driver licenses and sent us on our way. Took about 2 minutes but this was before 9-11. You might call customs and see if they need anything else."
519936,Karl,2002-05-08 19:47:00,63,My wife signs my kid's permission slip and has it notarized at my bank. It's just an extra step to avoid delays at the border.
