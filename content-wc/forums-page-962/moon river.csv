Also is there alot of rocks and logs in there, and is there any public boat launches? Any info about six mile lakewould be helpful also. Thanks"

I`ve fished the Moon a dozen times and at times the fishing can be slow but the scenery is awsome. I know it is hard to believe but my brother caught a 78 lb Musky there 2 weeks before season opened, so back she went."

519624,Czar,2002-05-02 05:03:00,408,No offense taken. He was trolling a #5 Mepps Aglia in an area near Woods Bay. The Musky didn`t fight that much till it was in the boat. It was netted with a salmon net. It was weighed on a Berkley 50 lb spring scale. The dial went past 50 to 28 when it snapped. The fish had a length of 64 inches. He lives in Arvada Colorado and Grisdale Cottages in Woods Bay has a picture.
