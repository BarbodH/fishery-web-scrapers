So, you can get dozens of can't miss lure recommendations, all of which will work.That being said, you may as well go with what is cheap and simple. Based on these criteria, I would go with the following:1. A jig (any colour) with a twister tail body (yellow, chartreuse or white) with or without bait;2. Len Thompson spoons (No. 1 and 2) in white/red, five of diamonds and ladybug;3. Lucky strike spoons (yellow/orange, yellow/green and plain yellow, with or without spots);4. Blue Fox Vibrax spinners (plain silver, sizes 2 and 4).With a few of each of these, you will be fine. Of course, if room and budget permit, Northerns will hit cranks and they like rattle 'n raps. But, they are a more pricey lure, and you'll lose a few, because of the Northerns' teeth, and La Ronge's rocky bottom. For these reasons, I have recommended the others ahead of the crankbaits.Anytime you're targeting Northerns, use a steel leader (8"" to 12"" ), or they'll be snapping you off all day.As for timing, mid-June should be good - ice will be touch and go for end of May, but will be out by June 14, and the late melt should have less effect on Northerns. I would fish the mouth of inlet streams, and calm shallow bays, where they'll be sunning in the warmer water. Also pay attention to weed edges in tight.Good luck,derrek.CANADIAN WALLEYE OPEN UP AND SAY ""EH""!"
