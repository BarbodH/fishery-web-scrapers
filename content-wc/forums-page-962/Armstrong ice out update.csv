519840,AL,2002-05-04 13:14:00,89,Anyone have an update on the ice out conditions in the Armstrong/ Nakina area? Heading up for a fly in on opening day and am geeting concerned.
519841,Guest,2002-05-04 15:37:00,0,I live in Thunder Bay and It is slowly getting warmer but the ice is still around on the lakes. The Warm temps we had a few weeks ago got rid of most of the ice on the rivers around here but the lakes are far behind. It is looking like a late spring -5 C tonight..
519842,Guest,2002-05-05 08:19:00,0,How does last year's ice out condtions compare to last year??
519843,tracker,2002-05-06 08:17:00,91,The ice left Lac des Mille Lacs in Sawmill Bay a few days ago. Further north at Kab Lake the ice was going fast as of yesterday.
519844,Guest,2002-05-06 12:45:00,0,"I'm headed up to Armstrong myself May 18 for a fly-in trip to Lake Weese, and I recently talked to the outfitter and they said that the ice is gone from the waters and the snow is melting. They said that at night it's getting down to about 35 degrees and during the day it's low 50's. I hope we get some good fishing in this year. What lake are you headed to? Hope this info helps..."
519845,WillieB,2002-05-06 13:11:00,292,"Hey Nate, Weese Lake sounds real familiar to me. You aren't by any chance flying in with Mattice Lake Outfitters, are you? They're the folks that I think deals with that lake. If you are booked with Don and Annette, you're in for a great time.tight lines"
519846,Nate,2002-05-07 06:58:00,17,"Tight lines... Yeah I'm flying in with Mattice Lake Outfitters this year, with Don and Annette. So you think I'm in for a good time huh? Your the second person that has told me that so I guess that's a good thing. Good luck on your trip...Nate"
519847,AL,2002-05-07 19:51:00,89,"Nate,It's me that posted this email....you're going to get whooped again this year. This ain't Crayon Lake so you youngsters better rest up."
519848,Nate,2002-05-08 08:41:00,17,"Who is ""me"" talking all this smack? Tony? I know this ain't Crayon Lake and I know you don't think you're going to catch more this year. Sure you caught more last year, but with a new lake a new state of mind you're going to run into some competition this time...good luck cause your going to need it. haha"
519849,AL,2002-05-08 18:58:00,89,"Young Nate....I have to admit you are one ##### of a fisherman for a young man, but you two are going up against two crafty veterans! And if you start catching too many we'll break your rods. Remember, jigs suck and black & gold Rapalas just don't work....."
