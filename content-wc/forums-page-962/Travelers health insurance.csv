I just happened to be changing insurance providers a month before departure and asked them if i was ""good to go to canada"". They said absolutely not with us. They referred me to some other provider and i got coverage for the week we were up there. Thx for the reminder, I need to call and get the same traveler's coverage for this year."

Be sure to specifically state emergency usage when inquiring."
