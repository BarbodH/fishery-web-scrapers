519651,Guest,2002-05-01 09:04:00,0,"I have caught bluish tinted walleyes near Timmins, Ontario. I can't say for sure that they are blue walleyes or just a color phase caused by genetics or environment. From what I understand, the true Blue Walleyes were only found in Lake Erie and are considered extinct. I believe that someone had one in their freezer for quite a while and plans were made to obtain a DNA sample and compare it to other samples taken from other lakes such as the ones near Timmins and Chapleau. If any one hears more about this, I would be interested in hearing from them."

519655,Guest,2002-05-02 03:05:00,0,"Years ago there was an article in ""in-Fisherman"" regarding the subject of Blue Walleyes. Having caught one in Quebec, I read it with interest and I recall the evidence was inconclusive as to whether ""Blues"" were a true sub-species (and therefore related to the Blues that once inhabited Lake Erie) or merely an ongoing genetic quirk that showed up with the rarity of, say, albinos in mammal species. I can only assume that this debate continues. The ""Blue Pike"" which were harvested into extinction in Lake Erie were generally smaller than the ""Yellow Pike"" but otherwise were nearly identical to them. One of the points of the article was whether the ""Blues"" could be rejuventated as a species. Interesting. Having caught one of these fish, I can assure you that they are not merely tinged with blue fringes on the tail or fin areas. They are a deep, vivid blue on top that gradually lightens toward the belly of the fish, becoming blanched. If you catch one, you'll know it. And, oh yes, they are just as delicious."

519657,Guest,2002-05-04 11:09:00,0,"We went on a fly-in 200 hundred miles north of the border a few years back. Every 'eye we caught had a bluish tint from the lat line up. I have a theory that they take on that color because of the ice. Have you ever seen a program when they show glaciers and they have a bluish tint to them. The fish will take on the colors of its surroundings for camoflauge, thus the blue tint."
519653,Guest,2002-05-05 05:43:00,0,"I live in timmins and have caught blue walleyes,although rare they do exsist.I have caught them in Massey lake,Massey township.If they are blue because of genetics or environment I do not know but would guess that it is genetics as in the same lake I have caught regular coloured walleye."
519658,Atlanta Dave,2002-05-05 10:37:00,323,They do exist I caught one on Lake Kippewa about 20 years ago.not much size maybe 2 lbs but very blue. Atlanta Dave
519659,Guest,2002-05-05 10:43:00,0,"Yes I have caught blue Walleye on the bay of Quinte in the winter a few years back, there was a school of them on that day. A very light blue color to them.LGMckeown, Napanee,Ontario, Canada."
519654,Guest,2002-05-07 07:27:00,0,"Alan, I've fished Massey many times, but I haven't seen a blue one from there, yet. I have caught them from a small lake just west of Lower Chesterfield in Mckeown Twp. I'm heading up to Timmins for May Run and am going to fish Canoeshed if there is enough water to get down the creek. Where are you planning to go? Feel free to e-mail me.[email protected]"
519660,Dinky,2002-05-07 17:19:00,307,"Catch quite a few in Lake Simard and Ottawa River up in NW Quebec. Quite common,caught 2 last summer. Just a dark bluish walleye. Never seen one more than 1 1/2#."
519641,Guest,2002-04-30 14:22:00,0,I was talking to a Canada fisherman at a party the other night and he told me about BLUE WALLEYES. Does anybody have any information on them or was I gut hooked in a story???
519642,Peanut,2002-04-30 14:38:00,929,"No - you were not the victim of fishing's equivalent to a ""snipe hunt"". Search the General Discussion archives, there was an interesting thread awhile back, I think it was started by Dick Knutson. If you search his name under author, you should find it (and a couple other interesting stories of his).Good luck,derrek.CANADIAN WALLEYE OPEN UP AND SAY ""EH""!"
519643,Guest,2002-04-30 14:44:00,0,Put on some blue tinted sunglasses and even the pike and seagulls look a tint of blue!!
519644,Guest,2002-04-30 15:57:00,0,Not as blue as you may think. I've seen them from the traditional gold right to black. Blue one recently on Nushatagoni up by Chapleau.
519645,Guest,2002-04-30 19:42:00,0,"Yes there were once a variety of Walleye that were ""blueish"", and existed in the Great Lakes. Although they are now thought to be extinct, I know of some of my relatives talking about them being caught a long time ago.Blue Walleyes are not folklore"
519646,Northern Manitoban,2002-04-30 19:48:00,195,Have caught many of these blue walleye's ice fishing just north of me.They seem to be mainly smaller in size like saugers.A trophy one on the wall would be quite the conversation piece.A replica of course.FISH ON.
519647,Guest,2002-04-30 19:58:00,0,"In lakes that have a high level of minerials in the water - mostly iron, you will notice on the fins and on the back of the walleye a very dark blue. This only appears in few inland lakes that I know of - In Canada of course!"
519648,2 DOGS,2002-04-30 19:59:00,361,"Yes, there are blue walleye. Have caught a few on Lac Seul, wife caught one about 22"" but know of a 26-27"" caught by the owner of Evergreen Lodge. I think they are blue-grey but everybody calls them blue."
519649,Tim Blanchette,2002-04-30 21:09:00,4,"On an Ontario lake that wasn't named on the map we caught walleyes that were blue on top and silver down the sides to the belly. The fish had blue fins and tail. In the same lake we caught walleyes with the ""normal"" coloring. These fish were different, but I don't know if they would be considered part of the thought to be extinct species.Tim Blanchette"
519650,BD,2002-04-30 22:09:00,739,"The ""extinct?"" blue pike of the great lakes were not walleye but a different species entirely. The blue walleye is a color variation of the walleye we know. Check out the archived threads for links to a lot of info including DNA charts. There are even two Canadian lodges that advertize fishing for blue walleye.""Even a little kid wouldn't try to catch fish without a sinker. Of course, somebody with no sense might go fishing withut a sinker. No rules for fools."" --- Anton Chekhov"
