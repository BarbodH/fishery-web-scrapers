519825,Rick,2002-05-08 14:18:00,226,"KarlI agree, he should be careful. The only medical emergency our group has had over lots of years happened when one guy tripped on a loose board on the dock and had to be flown out for stitches for a nasty cut to the forehead. Come to think of it, he was carrying a beer at the time. Better ban beer on shore too, just to be safe."
519826,Karl,2002-05-08 17:54:00,63,"Rick, There is no way that I advocate the banning of beer. I only believe that people should act responsible towards themselves and those around them ...drinking or not drinking. I know our group looks forward all year to returning to Canada and seeing the buds we only see once a year. This anticapation can lead to having a frivilous attitude about the potential dangers surrounding the trip. There is no fun in loss of property or injury to fellow fishing buds. I hope that all of the fisherman who fish the blue waters of Canada this year have a great time and return home to their loved ones with only good memorys."
519827,Rick,2002-05-08 19:51:00,226,"I know you don't advocate banning beer, most reasonable people don't and you seem to be reasonable. I know what you mean about the anticipation of the trips and the awareness of possible dangers and with that in mind, we try to be responsible. I think that governments tend to erode the publics support when they spend their resources on trivial matters and to me, beer in a boat is about about as trivial as it gets. Yes, I know there are those who have caused themselves and others pain because of drinking, but punish the offenders, not the masses."
519828,Eric,2002-05-08 19:54:00,114,This whole thread is stupid. I personally don't drink on the water but fish with people who have one or two. We are responsible and careful. Just conduct yourselves with good common sense and you will be OK on the water. I have been on 11 canadian trips and have never been hassled at the border or on the water. Canada is a great place and I am going to share it with my 12 year old in 21 days. good luck and good fishing. Eric
519815,Guest,2002-05-07 04:20:00,0,I'm glad to see Karl is from the USA(the greatest country in the world)I hope he is then he would know what the (pursuit of happiness) means thats what the Gov. keeps trying to take away. I bet our boys are drinking beer in Afghanastan now. AS far the beer thing been fishing canada for along time I've never seen a beer can go over the side.We put ours back in the cooler.
519817,Guest,2002-05-07 05:02:00,0,"Ever been with a guy driving a boat with a few to many underhis belt. He get's wild. It's not about freedom, it's about living.Can't drive and drink, can't fly and drink at least as pilot, driving a boat on the Canadian Shield is not a peace of cake, it takes paying attention. I am not against one or two as long as you are willing to pay the fine, but the drunks are a danger to everyone."
519818,Guest,2002-05-07 05:21:00,0,Your odds of getting caught are not that great. There are only a couple of wardens and a few OPP for a huge area. Most foreigners obey the law when they visit a neighbour. Your post speaks volumes about your respect for another countries laws and your own I may add. You should bring your kids along or a youngster to set an example on how to behave in a foreign country. Make shure you bring your own beer too. OPP like to write up Americans drinking their own beer....its a patriotic thing.
519816,Karl,2002-05-07 06:19:00,63,"Karl, Glad to see that others believe that drinking on the water is a danger to all of us. I live in St Louis and as a (32 year) Policeman see the sad effects of drinking and being behind the wheel of anything."
519819,Guest,2002-05-07 11:38:00,0,just had to chime in on my favorite walleyecentral topic!! ahh skip it and give me another beer!
519820,Rick,2002-05-08 07:22:00,226,"Take the beer and have a few. Just be careful and discrete around others and you'll probably be fine. Personally, I will flagrantly disregard the laws of our northern brothers on this issue and will continue to drink beer in the boat in spite of the laws and I will pay the fine if I get caught. Part of the cost of going on vacation.And to you whiners, no, I won't get ""sloshed, smashed, hammered"" or whatever cute euphemism you chose to substiute for drunk. I've been drinking beer and fishing for 30 years and have never crashed a boat or hurt myself or anyone else, so lighten up. Much like the now-repealed 55 MPH national speed (US) limit that was ignored by everyone (with the possible exception of a few holier-than-thou types) this is another of example of government getting too intrusive. Yeah, I know, alchol kills x number of people a year. Well, if the government was really concerned with our health and safety, they'd outlaw alcohol and cigarettes. But they are more addicted to the revenue than we are to the ""dangerous"" products. Its all just a revenue enhancing scheme and I'll take the money and pay the ticket if I get caught. Maybe it will help support some public works program like adding more CO's to check more coolers."
519821,Karl,2002-05-08 07:45:00,63,Rick...Glad to hear that you categorize your self as a responsible drinker. Drinking a few is one of the pleasures most of us like to enjoy when fishing on our Canadian vacation. It is also true that most of us can afford to pay the fine. Please do us whiners just one favor....when that one person in your party drinks a little to much (and somebody will) make sure that he stays out of the boat and doesent do anything to hurt himself or others. Most of the time when we fish in Canada we are a long way from medical help...so proceed with caution and enjoy Canada.
519822,Guest,2002-05-08 07:57:00,0,"Karl, Your are 100% correct. Several years ago a member of our group had a few to many and burnt himself severly with grease while cooking fish at shorelunch. We had told him to leave the pan alone but being alcohol driven he made the mistake of picking up the fry pan off of the fire. It took a plane flight and over $2000 dollars to get him to medical help and back to the states. Not to mention we lost the last three days of our trip.....Safety is SMART."
519823,Guest,2002-05-08 07:58:00,0,Its sounds like a canadian fishing trip is now more like a cat& mouse game with the opp with having a few beers in the boat! I think its time to just stay at the cabin on the dock pull up a chair and a cooler and watch the bobber! As i am typing this not to change the subject it is snowing here in northern minnesota with the opener just 2 days away it only fitting!!!!!
519824,Karl,2002-05-08 13:46:00,63,"USA 7, Make sure you dont fall out of the chair. Have a great summer catching Walleyes....Drink a couple for me...BE SAFE"
519805,Karl,2002-05-05 19:40:00,63,"USA 7, Get in touch the Goverment already tells you what cars you can buy and the food you can eat. Sounds like you probably dont like living in a free country that the Goverment trys to protect us from ourselves in. To bad that Drunken Drivers are responsible for thousands of new graves every year."
519806,Guest,2002-05-06 04:41:00,0,"Karl, they have you brain washed to i see (the goverment)! Its your kind of thinking that will make us free no more! There is already to much #%#%%# goverment!"
519807,Guest,2002-05-06 06:31:00,0,USA7 I agree with you. who are all these tea drinkers. I thought fishing and a beer or 2 went together It's called having fun!! These guys must read a book after they get back to camp. Listen here's what goes on the CO's can not charge you for have beer but they can hold you to the OPP gets there usally if you are rude to them (the CO'S) your busted.
519808,Karl,2002-05-06 06:44:00,63,USA7&John....You boys can just relax and drink your beer. You might want to try just sticking your head in the sand like a Ostrich trying to escape from reality. Please dont throw your beer cans in the lake...future generations want to fish too.
519809,Guest,2002-05-06 06:55:00,0,"Jerry, you need to relax and have a beer!!!!!!!!!!!!"
519810,Guest,2002-05-06 09:46:00,0,Hey USA- Your not the one who is planting pipe bombs in the midwest. You seem to have the same agenda as that guy. Less gov't is best.
519811,Guest,2002-05-06 10:01:00,0,LOL@ blue and same agenda as the pipe bomber. You really got me pegged dont you! This thread went from getting checked on the lakes to pipe bombs! I see karl has sterotyped a beer drinker as a litter bug mmmm! I am so suprised he would to that!
519812,Guest,2002-05-06 13:17:00,0,"I'll pay the fine! Been throwing one or two down a day while in the boat for the past 22 years, don't plan on changing any time soon."
519813,Karl,2002-05-06 16:05:00,63,"Dear USA, Nobody is stero typing you. There are people out there who understand that our Goverment is the best in the world. Its so good that you can drink all you want as long as you dont endanger anyone else or infringe on their rights. There are also those of us that believe that those people who brag about their drinking have some deep personal issues that are probably affecting their ability to be a responsibe citizen and enjoy freedom in the greatest country in the world. If you dont believe me go live in Afghanastan for a year...no beer there."
519814,Karl,2002-05-06 19:14:00,63,"Hi Karl, I'll continue to use my name (also Karl) on this board as long as I continue to agree with your messages, otherwise differenciation might be applicable.Where are you from?Karl"
519795,Guest,2002-05-03 09:57:00,0,"getting checked by the wardens............ anyone been checked with beer in the boat that they saw and had any problems????No need to hear from you that will comment about not going that far to drink......blah,blah,blahTalking about trolling down the shorline after lunch on a hot day enjoying a couple (meaning 2) of cold blues."
519796,Guest,2002-05-03 11:03:00,0,"I've never seen anyone checked for anything in my two trips to Lac Seul. I plan on enjoying a few open blues in the boat or at shore lunch. Its common and prevalent - don't let it cramp your style. PS. I love the lake, province and country. Please save the ""respect the law rhetoric""."
519797,Guest,2002-05-03 11:10:00,0,"If the O.P.P. catches you, it's tickettime baby! The C.O. is a little easier, or so I've heard, he just makes you pop the tops and pour it all overboard. Then again, a few nasty people got tickets too. I think once they see evidence that just opens the door for further investigation. Suppose they feel if you'd break the law on alcohol in the boat, you might forget the limit too."
519798,Guest,2002-05-03 11:18:00,0,"I was on the west end of Lac Seul last spring when the OP were on the water. One OP and one MNR officer each in the boat. While the OP check for boating regulations the MNR checked for fishing regulations. They nailed four consecutive boats for either open containers or fishing violations.If you need a drink that bad, or need the extra meat, then be prepared to PAY!"
519799,Guest,2002-05-03 11:36:00,0,please re-read 2nd portion of post.........................its all of our vacations
519800,Guest,2002-05-03 11:45:00,0,"What if you have your drink of choice poured into a large coffee mug, or one of those big water bottle things??? That trick used to work on the beach at Detroit Lakes on the 4th of July..."
519801,Guest,2002-05-04 08:44:00,0,"Try telling the judge ""but it's my vacation""! So if you are on vacation the laws shouldn't apply? What part of ""no alcohol in the boat"" don't you understand?? If having a beer is so important while fishing, wheel a couple of cases down to the shoreline and fish off the dock, get blitzed at the same time! Either your wife keeps you on a very short leash or you need to consider attending a few meetings if you can't wait til nightfall to tip a few!!"
519802,Guest,2002-05-04 11:35:00,0,What cant even a a few cold ones on a remote lake anymore. I hope the goverment will start telling me what kind of car to buy or food to eat also.
519803,Guest,2002-05-05 15:25:00,0,"NO NO NO PINHEADS ITS NOT LEGAL TO DRINK IN THE BOAT BOYS...YOU CANT DRINK AT TAILGATE PARTYS,WHILE YOU ARE HUNTING,DRIVING YOUR PICKUP,YOU CANT KEEP EVERYTHING YOU CATCH,YOU CAN FISH WITH YOUR SHOTGUN....AND I DONT GIVE A GOD ##### HOW FREE YOU ARE ...UP HERE ITS NOT LEGAL.........GOT IT"
519804,Guest,2002-05-05 16:19:00,0,jERRYI'm with you....Ya don't like the law...stay home or pay the fine. Cripes you can get hammered @ home!Enjoy the great outdoors!
