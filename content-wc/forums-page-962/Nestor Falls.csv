519536,Guest,2002-04-24 08:51:00,0,There are at least 2 bait shops in Nestor Falls. I've used the one by Dalseg's for a couple of years now. Their number (last year) is 807-484-2525. Good luck with the project. Terry

The minor paperwork or approval needed is a lot easier than a visit from a Conservation Officer."
