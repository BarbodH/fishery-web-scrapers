519124,Guest,2002-04-14 08:02:00,0,Everything you say I agree with. The fishing is worse than poor.
519125,GR8WTHUNTER,2002-04-14 22:26:00,618,Did real good with smallies on the upper french. Not what we went there for but had tons of fun. Lots of 2 to 4 pounders.
519126,Seanik,2002-04-15 07:12:00,218,Bears Den Lodge on Hartly Bay Seems to be a decent place. Hartly Bay is about 9 miles West of highway 69. Caught walleyes 57 feet down with minnows in October at mouth of Wanapatai River also some bass and pike. The French River scenery absolutely beautiful.
519127,duffy,2002-04-15 18:54:00,49,ditto on the poor fishing.:'(
519128,Guest,2002-04-20 13:00:00,0,"wE STAYED AT flat rapids lodge a few years ago. joel & millie are good hosts. walleye small. beautiful area. we were friends with Grandpa Schell and fished in Georgian Bay with him a few times. he took us down to georgian bay by bad river lodge. a very memorable trip! over the chutes! we now go to berthelot lodge in quebec. fly in, good fishing,and good accomodations. flyin in for 2 weeks this year. Grandpa Schell has passed but we have many good memories about him and flat rapids camp."
519129,Guest,2002-04-22 17:04:00,0,you want eyes? i'll show you eyes. but if smallmouth and eyes etc are necessary...well maybe the french'll do. fishing has really dropped off there tho...wont take much to find that out. anyway....you want a super place let me know...im now a lodge owner..just a one week a year guy.

519130,Guest,2002-04-23 05:05:00,0,There's nothing wrong with the fishing in the Upper French. Been going there for the last 17 or so years and I have no plans to stop. We stay on Sandy Island on the southern part of Nipissing and fish the Upper French regularly. The fishing has been outstanding the last couple of years.
519131,Lund AnglerMJ,2002-05-08 10:52:00,610,"If I ever hit the lottery,or take my life long investment's to one spot on earth,it's here.The Georgian Bay has it all;secenery,fish,peace,and above all good fishing.Don't let a few bad trip's determine your good time.How many time's has a bad day on the water,been followed by a grand day? I can say my time on Nippising was the best I've ever had in Canada. The last trip to the upper French,and Pickerel River area was good.We caught Walleye,and smallmouth.Trolled alot for Muskie,but the Northern Pike were on.Late in the year is my favorite.Try a trip in late September.Take the cold weather gear.Don't let cold ruin your time.Long john's,glove's,and a big coat.If you're there,keep a lookout for a grey Lund,trollin' for a big one. Go fast,go long.There are 30-40-50's up here.It's got so much water,that you could fish new water,each time out,and catch fish each time out.Get a good chart type map,and talk to local's,alway's urging your passion for catch and release. Do it too.For Walleye,the shoals have alway's been very good to me.Fish at night too,although you'll be alone.So what,the star's will never let you down,for a site to behold."
519132,Eric,2002-05-08 16:25:00,114,Thanks for all the help and comments. My bud and I are going to try it and I am sure we will have a good time. Eric
519114,Eric,2002-04-09 17:46:00,114,I am interested in fishing the French river area of Ontario. How is the fishing? Is the delta or upper french superior? Can you get to the georgian bay? has anyone any recommendation on places to stay. Will be targeting eyes but also may dabble for muskie or smallmouth. Planning on the 3rd week of sept 2002. Any help appreciated. thanks Eric MacDonald
519115,bigfish1965,2002-04-09 18:18:00,3210,"I absolutely love the French. It is relatively unspoiled and a wildlife bonanza. The lower French has always been more productive for me. Anywhere from the Flat Rapids/Flowerpot Bay area and downstream. In September the big boys are fattening up. Huge musky and really decent walleye.( Through in the odd sturgeon for some boat-towing fun.) But where to stay depends on the kind of experience you are looking for. Trying doing searches with keywords like'Ontario near north'...""French River"" etc."
519116,Red Ruffandsore,2002-04-09 18:26:00,81,The French River is absolutely georgeous. It's a serious fishing place. I can't find a link right now but I'll come back and post one for you. You picked a great spot...either end is great. It'll be pricey to stay somewhere on the river but an experience you will never forget. Make sure you have a camera if not a video camera.Stay off the pipe...and don't forget to wipe.Red
519117,Wawajake,2002-04-10 05:01:00,413,"I used to work with a guy that lives and had a few extra cabins on the French River at ""Flat Rapids Camp and Trailer park"" so thats the lower French. He retired now from his job in Sudbury 2 years ago and always said he was going to concentrate on the camp and tourist since he never advertised before . (a few American regulars and Sudbury people keep him busy)Perhaps try him : Joel Wunderlich, French River 705 857 2439 , he always kept a few aluminum boats with 15hp motors too. Reasonable rates and good fishing for walleye , musky, pike and smallmouth.He is a great character for a laugh too!!!jake"
519120,snaggletooth,2002-04-10 16:03:00,135,"I've been near there once. I stayed at Georgian Bay Fishing Camp. It's on the Georgian Bay side, near the French River delta. I was told that you can't go upstream into the French River by boat because of the whitewater areas of the river emptying into the Bay.Caught some nice pike on the Bay side. But never saw any big muskies which I was trying for. Chuck"
519118,bigfish1965,2002-04-10 17:25:00,3210,"Actually, Flat Rapids is where I always stayed. ( Haven't been in a few years. Didn't know Joel retired, he must be driving Millie bonkers...lol) If he is open, it is the best place to stay. ( We stayed in a cabin, even though he was never 'Open'.) You are only a short trip to some great fishing. Have Joel or his son take you through the rapids the first time though. Scary as all heck..(Did it many time in my 18 ft. Legend). Upstream from the camp, fish the point on the outflow of the bend. Lots of fish. Just below flat rapids is great as well as just below the train bridge. ( Try both sides) Near the bend there is a giant musky I chased so many times...never got him though. Good luck!!"
519119,Wawajake,2002-04-11 04:58:00,413,"BigfishLast I heard Joel kept Millie at work,(or Millie smart enough to stay at work) but if Joel isn't spending too much time at casinos LOL, then he should be spending Millies money at camp. Yes those rapids you definitely need a guide through the first time, matter of fact the numerous bays and off shoots can easily get one lost without some help from a guide and his maps. Us guys from Joels work used to have a annual end of Sept fishing weekend . We always had luck near railway bridge and a few other narrows that Joel pointed out for us.jake(joel knew me as jack)"
519121,Guest,2002-04-12 06:40:00,0,"honestly? i wouldnt waste my vacation on the french but if you must there is one place which is very nice. It's called Crane's Lochaven Lodge. You'll find them on the net. nice cottages, good equipment, good service.but the fishing is pretty poor generally-leastwise it was when we were going there. but the scenery is great and there are some nice trophy muskie and a handful of walleye around. problem is they get hit by the locals year round and the indigenous peoples net the spring spawning walleyes. so...like with everything in life...there are trade offs."
519122,bigfish1965,2002-04-12 07:11:00,3210,"Jack please say Hi to Joel for me. Maybe I'll have enuff seniority at my Casino ( Casino Niagara) to get some good walleye time off one day. As far as chieftains post, I never had a problem catching my walleye limit on the French. The biggest problem we ever had was catching within slot limits and getting them to the boat before a musky grabbed them. ( Scares the heck out of you when they grab it beside the boat...lol.) My name is on my profile!"
519123,Wawajake,2002-04-13 17:56:00,413,"Bigfishyou might see Joel before I do , he does trips to various casinos in Ontario, when he is in the Sault he visits me on his way to Sault casino. (once a year?) I work at OLGC headoffice in Sault.As for musky on French you correct, they are a blast ! Was fishing in calm bay one afternoon for smallmouth and got hit by a fair size musky, great fight!! and they deserve to be released as the top predator for those waters.jake"
