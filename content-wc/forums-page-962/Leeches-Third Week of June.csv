519545,Guest,2002-04-24 10:20:00,0,We have moved our trip up to June 22. We are near Savant Lake-the town. Leeches have always been very good for us during the first week of July. Any opinions about leeches a couple of weeks earlier?
519546,Behle,2002-04-24 12:21:00,51,Our group is also going to be in Canada that week. We will be staying at Allenwater. We too use leeches and are going later than normal by a week. Leeches have been good to us during June. We use them on spinners behind bottom bouncers. Last year we were there the third week of June and we did very well using leeches.
