519920,Guest,2002-05-07 14:25:00,0,Good place to ask the above question:http://members3.boardhost.com/fishmanitoba/
519921,chrism,2002-05-07 16:30:00,429,"I was in the area (Grand Rapids) on the weekend, and the locals are saying another 3 weeks/month - or about 6-7 weeks later than last year. It is still cold -well below freezing at night (and some days lately!) drilled one hole, and the ice is only rotten for about the first 6-10"" of 3.5 - 4ft.Unless we get some freak warm spell, the lakes will be iced on opening weekend."
519922,Guest,2002-05-07 18:15:00,0,todays the 7 of may ice is 4feet thick as of yet in flin flon here .......has not lifted yet
519923,Northern Manitoban,2002-05-08 11:05:00,195,As of today in the Thompson area we still have 30 inches of ice.Todays highs will be +7 friday suppose to be +14.The biggest problem is that its been getting to -10 or colder overnite.We still have over a foot of snow on top of the ice with lots of water underneath so until the stuff on top melts the ice won't start melting.i'm praying it will be off by the end of the month as i'm suppose to be going on a 6 day Laker trip first week of june.FISH ON.
519924,Piscatorian,2002-05-08 20:34:00,12,"Thanks guys. Looks like I'm in luck for once. I moved our trip back to June 20 from Uune 12. I was worried that the lakers might be going deep by then, but I think we're gonna hit it just right the way it's going. Good luck to you all."
519925,Northern Manitoban,2002-05-08 21:22:00,195,You can fish the whole month of june shallow for Lakers this way.I'm hoping the ice will be just off for a couple days or so when i'm out then the Laker action will be incredible.FISH ON.
