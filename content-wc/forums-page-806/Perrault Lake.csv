They were catching a lot of fish over there, a number of big fish on their bulliten board by friday. But we about blew away over the weekend, 30+k winds from the NE."

If your up there you'll have to flag me down, I'll be in a newer red crestliner w/2 other guys with me. Sometimes I like to cast for northerns along the reedline in front of your cabin, so I'll be around on and off. Not sure which cabin is yours but assume its along that corner where there are a few others just west of the narrows. Do you ever get over to Jim's and say hello? Catch you later."

We'll be up the week of July 4th though. As you come by Sleepy Dog working the shore line, the place east of me has a brown boathouse with a very white door, then you'll see my floating dock. The house was painted puke pink when I bought it, but it's brown now, lol. Maybe you'll be up in July?"

This time of year there are several places to catch walleye. Go down to the Ord River and vertical jig or cast and retrieve in the area where the river forks near the entrance to Church lake. Next, backtroll with a jig and minnow or leech in East Bay near the passage to Spidina Lake. Another good place to check might be up in Spidina lake. Go all the way up to the north end where there is an Island. Anchor off of the west side of the island and throw a slip-bobber rig right in by shore. You stand a good chance of catching walleye or smallies. Another spot to troll or to use a slip-bobber rig would be along the east shore of Jackfish Bay. A good place for Pike would be around the entrance to jackfish in the main lake. One more good place to troll would be between Big Hatfield and little Hatfield Islands and out around Peanut Island. I hope this information helps. My groups also did one day fly-ins several times. We went through Excellent Adventures, about twenty miles north of Perrault falls. They fly you in at around six or seven in the morning and pick you up at five or six in the evening. No one else on the lake but you and the fishing is unbelievable.$125 per person. The website for rainbowpoint (rainbowpoint.com) has fishing latest fishing reports for Perrault lake in the news section. Good Luck"
