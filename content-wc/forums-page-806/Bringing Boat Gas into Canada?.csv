540946,Guest,2004-06-18 20:05:00,0,How much extra boat gas can you bring across the border to Canada? I can't seen to find this answer anywhere online?
540950,bubba800,2004-06-19 05:13:00,559,"We usually take 30 gallons over what the boat holds. Just declare it, they calculate the duty owed on the extra and you're on your way."
540953,fishinnut,2004-06-19 06:54:00,642,I believe you are only allowed the capacity of your tank. I have a built in tank and bring along a 6 gallon portable and was never questioned.
540955,bubba800,2004-06-19 07:35:00,559,"""Non-residents of Canada visiting Ontario are allowed to bring in any reasonable amount of personal effects, a reasonable supply of food and a full tank of gas. (Reasonable means enough for personal use for the length of the stay.) Please note that any unreasonable amounts are subject to duty."""
540983,gpbrown,2004-06-20 19:52:00,359,Is the duty just the GST and the PST for Quebec? Or is it more?
540986,Guest,2004-06-20 20:25:00,0,"If you do take extra; meaning more than your onboard tank(s) as in cans or jugs, be sure to give your camp owner/operator a heads up as to what you have in mind. Most will not allow it due to insurance reasons. Makes for very tense times when people do this and it is clearly spelled out in the camp brochure that it is not allowed. Last year had a group of 15 guys from my home state in the cabin next to us and they had at least 18 6 gal. jugs full of gas lined up in a row outside their cabin door. The owner promptly notified them this was not allowed as stated in the brochure. They gave him what I thought were very stupid comments such as ""What do you want us to do, dump it on the ground"". I thought the owner was pretty cool and level headed when allowed them to keep it in a shed out of the heat and away from all the cabins. Funny part is after they would go to the shed and get full cans to put into their boats they could never find enough time to take the empties back to the shed. They would just stack them outside their cabin. I suppose they figured they were empty and that was OK. IMHO I thought this was very inconsiderate to not only the owner after he went out of his way to help them but to the other guests in camp. I suppose if you are camping on a very remote lake that doesn't have a marina or a lodge that has a gas dock you will need to do what you need to do. I guess I don't understand why anyone would want to haul the extra weight or travel with a bomb onboard if they don't need to. Even if you do get that much gas across the border, and you probably could, the group above would have needed only 20.00 per person more in the pot. Not hardly worth it IMHO."
