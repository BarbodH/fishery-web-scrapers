540979,Guest,2004-06-20 19:06:00,0,Has anyone fished Crow Lake just north of Nestor Falls and how is it? Has anyone stayed at Allens' Crow Lake Lodge on that lake and how is it? I'm taking my family up at the end of July and would like to know if the lake and lodge are a good place for my family. Thanks!

Don't plan on getting your walleyes there. It is a lake trout, musky and northern lake. It also has good smallmouth fishing if that is what you are into. I haven't stayed at Allen's so I can't help you there. I caught my biggest musky and northern there so I have fond memories of the lake. There are many reefs that come up out of deep water quickly so get a lake map and have someone mark it for you. Good luck. Fish4fun"

Bull Moose is not a place with a lot of frills and they don't cook meals but the price is great. We had 7 guys for a week and grand total per person for every thing (drive up, drive home, gas, bait, liscense, food, etc.) was $445 for the whole week. If you would like to catch walleye, rent a small motor and at the North end of Crow you can portage the motor and all yor stuff over the hill to boats and you can fish the lake on the other side. It is called Cedar Tree and the only way in is through the portage. It is a fun time and you will almost surly be the only boat on the lake. If you would like to give me a call for the details that would be fine #715-381-4242. Have a great time! Mark"
