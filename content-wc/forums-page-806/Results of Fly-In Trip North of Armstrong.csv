540958,Larry S,2004-06-19 10:14:00,666,"Went on a fly-in trip with Northern Outposts June 4-11th to Dearden Lake. Weather was cold and rainy most of trip Temps on several mornings in upper 30's. Fishing was excellent caught hundreds of walleyes and pike.The owner opened up a new portage to Springer Lake we fished it twice and the fishing was utterly fantastic.The other short portage to Lavoie Lake was also great Hopefully the weather will be better for the fishermen coming up in the future.Caught most fish on jigs and tails ,although one of the guys was doing great with a particular red & black spoon for walleyes.The only bad aspect was that my friend had to fly out on the 4th day of trip due to being sick. He's better now ,but missed a week of the trip Larry S"
