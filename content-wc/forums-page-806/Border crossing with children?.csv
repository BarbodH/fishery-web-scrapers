I am wondering what type of identification would I might need to cross the border with my children? I have the birth cirtificate for my son, but not for my daughter. I do Social Security cards for both. Thanks, Lonnie"

I would have birth certificates for all the children with you. Also, if the other parent is not along, bring a letter from the other parent stating that they know the where abouts of their child and a way to be contacted. I have never had a problem at the border, the most I have been delayed was this year when our boat was gamma rayed coming back into the states. I attributed my good luck at the border to being cleaned up, not joking around, acting business like and answering the questions straight forward. When I have had my kids, I had the birth cerficates laying on the dashboard of the truck. Enjoy your trip. Fritz"

I answered for them once and the agent said he was not talking to me? Other than that never had a problem. Birth certifcate and SS card should be enough. Good Luck"
540942,Guest,2004-06-18 12:59:00,0,"Technically you need 2 pieces of government issued ID and one must posses a picture. For kids, I'm sure 2 pieces will do it without the picture. Call before you go and ask about the birth certificate. I would say you need it."
540952,ankorklankor,2004-06-19 06:33:00,273,"Fritz is correct, you need the birth certificate and a picture id if available ( school id) and a note from the other parent if both are not present. Our fishing party has a couple of teenage boys in it and their dads get asked for a note from the mothers every time. Make sure the note has contact info on it."
