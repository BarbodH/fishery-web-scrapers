Can anyone tell me is it always on the third Sat. in May? Trying to make plans for next year and didn't know if this being a leap year could have any berring the opener.

540981,Guest,2004-06-20 19:29:00,0,Thanks for the quick response. I figured it was when they also noted the third Sat. of May. Just didn't know if this year was different due to being a leap year. Thanks again TrailerGuy
