540960,Steve1,2004-06-19 11:05:00,37,I am heading up to the area the 2nd week of July. I was told it was better to go up I-29 and take MN hwy 11 to Baudette and cross into Canada there. I was told the crossing would be a little easier at Baudette instead of crossing at International Falls. Or is it better to go up to Winnipeg and head over. Thanks for any info. Steve

Side comment////Baudette is much better crossing than IFalls also, if you go up through Minnesota for another reason/another trip....for two things, you don't have to pay at the bridge/and wait."

Baudette is a nice crossing but will really slow you down going across the top of Minnesota. I've made the trip many, many times and the fastest is up the Interstate. Even with more miles driven in Canada at a lower speed limit. As a matter of fact, I'll be going that way next Tuesday."
