If you are fishing a big lake with deep water you might need different tackle then if you were fishing a small lake. Also, some lakes have restrictions on live bait, barbed hooks, etc. Having said that, I would not go to Canada without a a couple of hundred jigs. You will not use them all, but you need some different sizes and weights. Definitely have 1/16, 1/8, 1/4 and 3/8 oz jigs. For colors, I always have orange, chartuese, white, pink, red and some combo's. Chartuese and Orange is my favorite combo. For bait, you can only take in night crawlers in Buss bedding. We always buy leeches and some minnows in Canada. We always have plastics to use on jigs if the fish are really snapping. For crank baits, Rapala's shad raps, tradition floaters, tail dancers and husky jerks have all caught fish for me. Good luck and enjoy the trip, fritz"
