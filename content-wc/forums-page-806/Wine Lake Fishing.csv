540649,Guest,2004-06-13 07:38:00,0,"Just returned from Wine Lake and the fishing was wonderful. The weather was changing on a daily basis so we had to search a little but the whole camp was catching a lot of fish. Fish fry on every night. Some of the big fish for the week are walleye-30.5, 29, 27,27 and 25.5 inch. Plus hundreds of over 18 inch walleye released. Northerns 40 and 38.5 inch also plenty of fish under 24 inch. If you do fish Wine Lake you only can keep Northerns in the range of 24-27.5 inch so that is a pretty tough slot. But they are still fun to catch. As for Lakers we caught and ate a few. The largest was a 36 and some other sizes and released 29, 28, 28.5,26 and a bunch at 25.5. The trout were in as little as 8 feet of water. The best day in our camp was 21 18 inch walleye between 6 fisherman. We also saw many moose back in different lakes and saw them swim across the water. As always Herb was great and if you what good fishing and rustic cabins Wine is the place to go."
540657,AB,2004-06-13 10:31:00,61,Did you find any smallies?
540659,kingsway2,2004-06-13 11:06:00,15,"Shoe89, Would you mind giving some more detailed info on location areas in Wine for the trout, walleyes, and northerns as well as types of bait and presantation. We leave on the 25th of June for Wabaskang and plan on fishing Wine also. I will post after our return. Thanks, Rich"
540662,Guest,2004-06-13 11:56:00,0,We were catching some smallies at the annishinabi falls. The owner of the camp said the smallies are starting to have larger numbers on Wine.
540663,Guest,2004-06-13 12:04:00,0,"Rich We fished various places but I will tell you some of the close places to Wabaskang. A good place to fish walleye is at the entrance to go up to anishinabi falls there is a large rock face and we jig that a lot. Also, when you enter wine from the river there is an old cabin on the right shore, we bottom bounce with spinners there. Some other places that we were successful is Ghost Lake. Which is threw the narrows and you have to go into turn around lake then into ghost. That would be a long trip from wabaskang. We bottom bounced that with spinners. As for northerns you can pick them up jigging or bottom bouncing anywhere. As for the trout we fish the first island once you get into wine, the narrows which is south of camp where the water is 100+ feet, and sandy beach. If you ever been into Beaver Lake you have been threw the narrows that is a good trout spot. Sandy Beach is past the islands threw the narrows and to the left. You will see a tpee out there and we fish right out from there. We caught a lot of trout on spinner rigs and flutter spoons while bottom bouncing."
540670,Guest,2004-06-13 17:17:00,0,What does a 36 inch trout weigh?
540676,Guest,2004-06-13 20:11:00,0,The trout was over 20 pounds
541016,Guest,2004-06-21 13:45:00,0,"We were at Wine Lake Camp May 22-27. We caught trout like never before. My Bro in law caught a 34"" that was well over 20 lbs. We were caught in the post spawn lull for walleye, so only a few wallys. Pike were big but sporadic. In four years, we only caught one smally, it was at Cedar Falls last year when the water was way low. By the way, how do others feel about the boats from Wabaskang fishing in the Wine system. For some reason, it seems to irritate me. We like to think of staying at WLC as giving us some kind of privilege, but maybe I am unrealistic. What do others think?"
541023,Guest,2004-06-21 18:37:00,0,"As for the wabaskang boats coming into Wine it doesn't seem to happen very often and the only place I have seen them is in Beaver. All rest of the fishing would be to far for them to travel into. It is a privelege to stay at wlc and it is one of the best places I have ever been. Also if boats come down from Wabaskang I hope they know the slot limits that are on the lake system. It is different than the Ontario limits. As for fishing I was there the week of June 5 and we also caught trout, we caught a lot of under slot pike and some up 30's and one 40. We caught walleye to eat and the started to really turn on on Thursday. But you are right it is a privilege to stay at the wlc and the owners are wonderful."
