540773,Guest,2004-06-15 13:08:00,0,Hello Trout Ernie and his stuff store camp and the area are beautiful--I just haven't done well on Dog-pretty big water for me. I have camped at Dog many times but take the quad and canoe or the 14 foot aluminumm and pull it out into the bush and fish those smaller not fished lakes.Stephenson is one and have fished McEwen sp. but that is mostly a pike lake and now easy to get to--so don't go there anymore. We have worked our way farther west and north into Ontario for excellent fishing. Now going north of the town of Pickle Lake--the farthest you can drive north on a road in Ontario. Good luck on Dog--for me it is named correctly. The place to go up there for a lot of eyes is to go over the tracks out of Dog into the water that comes out of Wabatomgushi---sp-- and fish at the base of the falls where that water comes south out of the above lake . len
540797,Troutbeck,2004-06-16 06:46:00,682,"Thanks, Len. We've been going there for years and I'm familiar with some of the lakes you're talking about. When you say over the tracks to where the Wabatomgushi pours in, where exactly is that? Are you talking about the tracks you portage over to get to Meath lake? Or the tracks over the river on the far side of the lake? We've found a really nice lake for brookies and can't wait to get back this year. My dad also likes Baltimore lake for the pike. Thanks for the advice. Depending on how we do this year, we may be looking for something a little better, too. Last year we did well. A lot of walleyes (some big ones) plus some monster brookies in one of the small lake. And, of course, a ton of hammer handle pike (a few big ones, too) Trout"

540893,Guest,2004-06-16 19:53:00,0,Troutbeck We have also fished Blackfish lake for lake trout--the other body of water is Loch Lomond up the Lochalsh River also have fished Loch Katrene and Meath. Have a friend up there on Dog should be thre today he is from Coleman Michigan--Don Miller is his name he has a motor home camping at Ernies. I met a couple of brothers from KY. AND TENNESSEE who showed me some lakes up there. len

No Lakers, very few Pike (on Dog, the portage lake Pinney was a different story) and between 7 guys, only 42 Walleye! Of the 42, only 17 were keepers and all on the smaller side of the slot. I've been fishing in Canada for over 10 years and this was by far the worst trip I can remember. I hope that you have better luck."
541001,Troutbeck,2004-06-21 09:30:00,682,"Thanks, Grond. I've been in the Pinney area (both the river and lake). We've had decent pike action in there. Did you get up to any of the lakes on the way to Renabie? We've done well for pike on them. I hope it picks up a little! What were you getting walleyes on? any color/pattern advice? Trout"
