I'd guess that the shoreline and islands are less rocky and a lower profile than further north on LOTW? Please straighten me out if I'm way off base here! I'd imagine that there are loads of shore lunch sites scraped out of the bush, but oftentimes they're not too suitable for camping? Has the higher water made many of them too ""soggy?"" :) Would anyone care to share some decent lake camping site locations? Thanks, Camper"
540930,Guest,2004-06-17 19:48:00,0,I know there are about a half a dozen suitable camping sites in and around Miles Bay and nearby in the Sabaskong area. I talked to a few guys headed up that way this afternoon. There were loaded up with gear and bought a bunch of minnows for the weekend. Said they had some bear trouble last year when camping on the peninsula and were going to find a smaller island and tie their food up with ropes from trees when they were out fishing. People from the resorts should be able to mark a map where some camping sites are.
540956,rpieske,2004-06-19 08:20:00,1276,You better check with MNR. I believe camping is banned on LOTW for those who are not residents of Ontario.
540972,Guest,2004-06-19 22:39:00,0,"It's only banned for non-residents of Canada in certain areas (eg. whitefish bay.) Sabaskong and areas are fine. You just need to buy a camping permit, which is available anywhere fishing licenses are sold. It's $10/night CDN per person over 18 years of age."
