540913,Guest,2004-06-17 10:28:00,0,"I just got off the phone with Gail at Witch Bay. She said the water conditions and fishing is about 2 weeks behind ""normal"" conditions. However, the weather has been improving and the fishing is getting very hot. If we can keep the general warming trend going, you should be in good shape. Other reports I've seen/read indicate the walleye are starting to move in shallow, the smallies are about to or are spawning, and the northerns are starting to pick up and be more consistent. Muskie opens this weekend, and the reports I've seen suggest the fish have just finished spawning and the predictions are for a slow opener. Good luck"
540964,Guest,2004-06-19 18:36:00,0,I left Lake of the Woods friday morning and it was 36 degrees with about a 30 mph wind. The fishing was good all week but the weather was cold and windy. The bass had not spawned but were biting well. Walleyes had a good bite were not bunched up real well. Northerns had a good bite and we caught a couple 40 inchers and several in the 30's. Had a great week but could have stood it warmer.
