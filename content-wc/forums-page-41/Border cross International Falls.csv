6663736,ILScott,2022-06-12 05:19:00,139,Came back from Canada on June 11th at 1:00. We had no line and went across in less than 5 minutes. I didn't see a lot of traffic coming down 502 on Saturday.
6664050,Nimitz,2022-06-13 09:37:00,20,"We crossed the border into Canada on June 3rd with no problem. A few more questions than usual, but very smooth. Crossed back into America on June 10th, again with no issues."
6664062,That Minnesota guy,2022-06-13 10:10:00,8293,Are you the same Nimitz that was registered here in the past? If so welcome back!
6664110,Nimitz,2022-06-13 13:15:00,20,I am. Just took a few years off. Thanks for remembering!
6664118,10point,2022-06-13 14:13:00,102,"On June 3rd we got in line at 6:30 and it took an hour. On the way back I believe it was 7:30 and it took about 20 minutes. We were next in line and a agent runs up and holds her hand up. About 10 agents came out and they took the guys at the booth in the lane next to us out of their truck, made them put their hands behind their backs, and took them inside."
6663542,valley366,2022-06-10 20:35:00,193,Went across going north at 6:30 tonight. Zero line. They had 4 lanes open and 3 were occupied when I pulled up. Talking to the border agent he said things cleared up about 5:30. They had expected 2200 crossings today and registered 200 by the time crossed.
6663634,lmoore,2022-06-11 11:37:00,40,They must have gotten all the ones they expected yesterday today. There is a 45 minute wait right now according to the border wait times website.
6663636,That Minnesota guy,2022-06-11 11:45:00,8293,Any lines on Saturday afternoon are generally people returning to the states from Canada. Morning lines are people heading to Canada unless it's raining. Then the guys will bail from the Lodges and head home early.
6663644,gopherbuddy,2022-06-11 12:27:00,51,"When the line gets real long do most people queue up on Hwy 11 coming in from the East? We did that last time we were up three years ago even though we were coming from the South. But it also seemed like some people were merging into the line from the west a block or two closer to the toll booth. I'm always good at picking the longest, slowest line anywhere."
6663648,That Minnesota guy,2022-06-11 12:32:00,8293,"No, you did the right thing. Line swings East on Hwy 11. There is plenty of room on the shoulder for vehicles. Just don't stop on those railroad tracks. If you don't need gas or anything in town you can take the County Road 332 truck Route. If heading North on Hwy 53 turn RIGHT on 332, follow it about 3 miles to the stop sign. Turn left and you will be in line on Hwy 11. It will save you making a U turn."
6663650,gopherbuddy,2022-06-11 13:16:00,51,Thanks! I like the truck route idea. We usually gas at Jim's or Cook since the stations in the falls can get backed up Saturday morning.
6663654,That Minnesota guy,2022-06-11 13:40:00,8293,"Lucky 7 in Cook is generally the best price. Jims & Gateway pretty much are the same price. Holiday always jacks their prices on Thursday, this week it was nearly a nickel. I buy my gas at the Shell station. They give a lot back to the community and are local owners. Enjoy your trip."
6663658,cle,2022-06-11 16:05:00,7,The duty free store normally has the cheapest gas. When I crossed in May for the opener the duty free was 3.99 a gallon and the other stations were 4.09 a gallon.
6663662,gopherbuddy,2022-06-11 16:15:00,51,Thanks. We will be at Sioux Narrows last week of June. Early August we will be on Namakan.
6663702,packpro,2022-06-11 21:08:00,695,"Friday June 3, going into Canada at 5:15 PM, we waited an hour. Friday June 10 come back to US, 5 minutes. Pullled up and was second in line."
