6662168,mrmallerd,2022-06-06 13:32:00,1,"Went thru Sat morning in a truck. Water was 18"" at most. Centerline was visible most of the way."
6662198,prov1800,2022-06-06 15:01:00,5010,Great.Lot smoother than detour and you get all the crap washed off the bottom of your truck for free.Heading through it tomorrow with my boat
6662212,wallypod,2022-06-06 15:34:00,21,Would be great to hear your feedback. Glad to hear the road is still intact. Took the detour on May 20th and 28th and would rather roll the dice on 105. Free wash and all! Headed back up June 12th
6662216,Eckohlt,2022-06-06 15:48:00,3685,Just the boat??tilt the motor up a bit.
6662238,prov1800,2022-06-06 16:43:00,5010,Won't be a problem.ill give a report tomorrow
6663596,dakota eye,2022-06-11 07:47:00,69,Is 105 fully open now guys? Will be traveling up there Monday. Thx!
6663598,prov1800,2022-06-11 07:51:00,5010,Officially noUnofficially yes.Signs still so closed.apparently there good be structural problems.ill be hauling my boat across it tomorrow so it's up to the individual
6660912,NM_Trout,2022-06-01 14:07:00,1094,Yikes. I think I'll still take the detour. Us desert dwellers get nervous driving a wheeled vehicle through standing water.
6660922,prov1800,2022-06-01 14:21:00,5010,You'll be good.think if the adventure
6661294,nitroman,2022-06-03 09:20:00,368,105 all the way to Cedar or the bypass? In a truck pulling my boat with my wife. What you say John?
6661314,prov1800,2022-06-03 10:20:00,5010,If it was me I'd go through Buller.2 minutes compared to 40.If it stays dry detour not to bad.Very rough in spots depending on amount of traffic.Pickup and boat no problem.Just go slow .there's traffic through it both ways.So one at a time.from Buller to cedar great.watch out for mean bump at culverts where cliff dumps into cedar.they fixed it tgere but left pretty bump there
6661320,Eckohlt,2022-06-03 10:43:00,3685,Gotta tip toe through the land mines.
6661336,Twodogs,2022-06-03 12:04:00,115,Be just like driving in Illinois after our winters with all the potholes ..

6661342,prov1800,2022-06-03 12:44:00,5010,Went to town today through creek.No problems.Heard in town OPP will hand out tickets if you go through.Figured I'd better mention that.
6661350,bus33,2022-06-03 13:22:00,289,I'd raise your kicker and/or main motor when going through the detour.
6661356,N_of_Quibell,2022-06-03 13:56:00,151,"I saw an OPP on the Quibell Rd. detour last week, so they're keeping an eye on things. The sign says ""passenger vehicles only"" on the detour, but I saw a number of delivery/service trucks and rv's."
6660828,prov1800,2022-06-01 09:52:00,5010,So playing wirh traiker bearings today ànd needed to go to town and pick them up.Decided to go through the water at Buller Creek for first in few weeks.Its no problem for a puck up or higher SUV.Felt good not having to bunch through the detour.https://youtu.be/IWnKfv1k0W8
6660838,nwifisherman,2022-06-01 10:16:00,9,Can you pull a boat through it? Supposed to be coming up on Saturday.
6660870,jambi,2022-06-01 11:53:00,504,I'd troll the double cowgirl thru there
6660876,JAY221,2022-06-01 12:33:00,877,"Am i correct in that this is the only place keeping 105 from being open for travel? Thank you for all the info you are posting. Later, Jay"
6660886,N_of_Quibell,2022-06-01 13:16:00,151,Just be sure you use marine grease in the bearings and hope it doesn't wash out.
6660888,Bill Krejca,2022-06-01 13:17:00,6107,"Thanks for the update, John. Kinda crazy, but as I saw the semi heading towards you, I was reminded of the ol' country song ""Walk Out Backwards So I Think You're Walking In."" Funny how our(my) mind works! Or doesn't! Bill"
6660894,prov1800,2022-06-01 13:31:00,5010,Sure can.
6660896,prov1800,2022-06-01 13:32:00,5010,Sign might say road closed in vermilion bay but just go through it.
6660898,prov1800,2022-06-01 13:33:00,5010,"This was the problem.36"" of water."
6660900,prov1800,2022-06-01 13:34:00,5010,No muskies but there would be pike like crazy.
