6663082,Da' Walleye Assassun,2022-06-08 21:53:00,358,July would be a good time in my opinion. The fishing is good and mosquito coils in the cabin work well. Are you driving or flying up?
6663090,pjshorthorn,2022-06-09 02:13:00,5654,"Take a look at Vermilion Bay Lodge on Eagle Lake. If you are thinking about a housekeeping plan, this is where I would take my Mom. Only eight cabins, quiet atmosphere, very nice main lodge where one can relax and boating is very easy to navigate the lake and you don't have to go far to find beautiful scenery. Cabins have a large screened in porch facing the lake, there are outdoor decks facing the lake where one can grill dinner or just sit and read, there is a nice size deck on the lake with chairs and a small beach along with an outdoor fire pit. If weather was yucky on a day, you can go explore Kenora within 30-45 minutes. If you wanted to fish a bit each day, some very good fishing is right out in front of the lodge where you Mom could watch you from the cabin screened in porch. I've really enjoyed my trips to VBL and the cost is very affordable. I hope you have a great trip with your Mom .it will be a special trip for sure. PjShorthorn"

Wabaskang fishes like 5 small lakes interconnected so you can stay as close as you want or run a little ways if you want. It is NOT American Plan but the cabin is fully stocked for cooking with pans and dishes, etc. Has satellite TV and a dvd player in the cabin with heat if needed. Later, Jay"
6663614,emma17,2022-06-11 09:57:00,436,A third vote for Temple Bay. Our family experienced first hand how accommodating they are for special needs. Great set up for someone staying back.
6662852,Walleye2242,2022-06-08 11:44:00,263,"So...looking for time of the year suggestions and maybe camp suggestions. I usually go to gullrock. My mom is 78 and never been to canada. Its a bucket list thing now for her. Her health is below average and sure doesnt get around very well. She has no interest in fishing. She wants to sit in the boat, go for boat rides and just hang out on a deck and enjoy the beauty. She likes warmer weather. I like cooler weather and no bugs. i assume she doesnt want to be bothered by bugs too much either. I go mid sept. I am afraid weather might be too cold for her at that time. Thinking mid august to early sept maybe????? Will be just her and I for the trip. Feel free to throw suggestions at us. Thank you."
6662858,Ricky Spanish,2022-06-08 11:58:00,1298,"Temple Bay Lodge goes out of their way to help every guest, especially those with extra needs. They have a golf cart to take her to and from the dock. A nice screened in gazebo overlooking the lake to relax in. I've seen many people with mobility issues, in their later years, or in wheelchairs having a great time there. Jeff will make sure everything is handled."
6662864,Hot Runr Guy,2022-06-08 12:15:00,16061,"To put my response in perspective, my Father passed away when I was 15 (50 years ago), my Mother has been gone 20 years. Forget about the fishing for this trip, and find the best resort you can so you can pamper her and fulfill her ""bucket list"" wish. HRG"
6662868,Ricky Spanish,2022-06-08 12:21:00,1298,"I agree. Lost my dad a few months ago and wish he would have come fishing with me as an adult, even just to the lodge to hang out. He only took us fishing as kids because we wanted to go. Once we were able to go by ourselves he never went again."
6662874,Yellowfin123,2022-06-08 12:27:00,2182,"this sounds like a trip where weather is EVERYTHING... your august 15-early sep sounds right with bugs and weather... myself i would wait to book on a 2 week notice, I've always done this and never had a problem going anywhere i wanted to go in canada except maybe a fly in outpost but anywhere on eagle, lac seul, lotw, cedar, gullrock, etc your not gonna have a problem with all the unvaxxed, i never had a problem before covid, and i've never tried this before jun 15.. study the weather.."
6662876,Pooch,2022-06-08 12:37:00,4618,"Mid to late August for weather and the winding down of bugs. Very few bugs, but weather can turn cold on you after Labor Day. Labor Day trips have given us some of the coldest and some of the hottest trips of the year. No real way to avoid either.You are gonna want a place with heat. Few places have air conditioning, but the nights cool off later in the summer making open windows and a blanket great sleeping.Not many camps have TV available, though some ""drive to's"" might. Some camps do have golf carts for general guest use, but they are passed around and not always available.Housekeeping or American Plan? American plans usually have a dining area that gets used all day for guests to sit around and visit or watch TV.A cabin near the docks are a huge plus as we age. Though when spending days on end sitting in a boat the only exorcise we get is the trip back and forth from cabin to boat! The west arm of Lac Seul has a number of nice cabin'ed camps. Big water, but sheltered areas not far. Maybe a smaller lake might be in order? Prov1800 probably has some ideas along 105's west side.Pooch"
6662882,proguidedream,2022-06-08 12:59:00,345,"i dont think you will beat that recommendation. i have never been but it is a nice area, vermellion has a coffee shop with good baking, and a gift store or 2 if you get a rainy day. based on the golf cart and screened gazebo that really negates most of your problems. it could be a very very bad year for bugs with all the water we have in the bush up here."
6662894,NM_Trout,2022-06-08 14:14:00,1094,"Likely the spots you are looking at are better than most. But if not, consider finding a place that has some indoor porcelain for her. That alone will improve her comfort level tremendously. Bring bed nets so she doesn't have to go to sleep with DEET on. Consider bringing her own pillow if you can (it makes a big difference for the senior member of our party). Take it easy, and plan around naps :-)I think it is wonderful that she wants to go. Best wishes for a great trip!"
6662900,Eckohlt,2022-06-08 14:41:00,3685,"I think the first thing I would ask my mom is,if she wants to go to a crowded resort,or if she wants to go to a lake we can have to ourselves."
6663064,SweetD,2022-06-08 20:51:00,243,"Based on health considerations I would certainly think a resort/lake near a larger community with hospital access would be important…….Fort Frances, Dryden, Thunder Bay, Red Lake maybe? I like what others have said. Make the trip about her and spending time with her. Play games she likes to play etc. When choosing your resort demand best view on the lake with easy in and easy out access. A handicapped ramp access is available at many. If doing boat excursions be sure boats are stable with flat floors and comfortable seating. Finally I would look for smaller water or at a minimum a location that will allow you to get out without getting beat to death……LOTW US side for example would be a poor selection for this trip IMO plus sceneri is lacking. Sorry LOTW crowd but just doesn’t fir the bill here.Good luck and enjoy time with Mom!!!!"
