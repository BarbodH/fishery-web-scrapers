6659536,lassh,2022-05-27 11:38:00,553,"We are crossing from US into Canada via IF/Ft. Frances to fish Lake of the Woods from a Canadian outpost camp at Bell Island. If we were to cross from Canadian waters into the US side then back into Canada, what kind of reporting would be required? I don't really plan to do that but would like to know just in case."
6659588,Old Timer,2022-05-27 17:02:00,255,"That's a good question and I suspect you'll have to call customs on both sides. I and many others used to cross back and forth on Rainy Lake and LOTW when you could apply for and secure a Remote Border Crossing Pass. A fee was part of the deal. That pass allowed you to stay in the U.S. and fish back and forth across the border and touch Canadian land. But I understand those passes are not available now. And your situation is the flip side because you're lodged in Canada. If you get a definitive answer to your question, let us know."
6659650,Riding high,2022-05-28 05:15:00,69,Call customs to get a definite answer. But I would say your fine. If you have fish in the boat I would guess you better have a license from both places and live bait would be another problem.
6659676,lassh,2022-05-28 08:49:00,553,"I did talk to US customs and there are no reporting requirements for temporarily crossing back into US waters from Canada. As far as reentry to Canada, I didn't want to burden the border folks on the busy weekend and potentially cause fishermen delays; so I'll wait until normal business hours next week to call. I don't plan on bringing fish across but of course have licenses for MN and ON and follow the most restrictive rules of both countries. The bait issue could be sticky as you can't bring live bait across. The only live bait I would potentially have would be some crawlers which I would have bought in Canada and have receipt for them. Even so, it might be a sticking point so would probably not bring any if I planned to go into US waters. I would make sure I have ArriveCan receipt and proper ID for entry on boat."
6659680,That Minnesota guy,2022-05-28 09:34:00,8293,I would have something to prove you are staying at a Canadian Resort. That should satisfy the Canadians if you get stopped on the water. If you were staying in the US you aren't allowed to touch Canadian soil or anchor your boat. That would be moot if they saw you going from the US and touching Canadian soil if you can prove you are staying in Canada.
6659808,Baseline,2022-05-28 20:47:00,3207,Your question would be a good one to ask at the border when you cross. Report back on this thread when you return.
6659882,lassh,2022-05-29 07:58:00,553,I will update when I get an answer. I'm not going to LOW until mid July. Doing a flyin in couple weeks.
6659912,Old Timer,2022-05-29 10:29:00,255,"I'd be concerned that once you're back in U.S. waters you are subject to the no touch rule when you cross back into Canada. Except for your word, the Mounties don't know whether you stopped over someplace in the U.S. before crossing back to your Canadian camp. Some folks who crossed over on Rainy last spring to check their Canadian island cabin were tagged hard by the Canadian authorities for their transgression."
6662824,lassh,2022-06-08 10:32:00,553,"So I called Canada Border services to determine reporting requirements for staying in Canada on Lake of the Woods (after crossing land border into Canada and boating to camp in Canada) if I entered US waters to fish and returned to Canadian waters. The agent did not know offhand the answer so he contacted another person. There was no definitive answer. He confirmed that the Remote Border Crossing permit process was stopped during covid and had not been reinstated. I knew that. He also said that you could temporarily enter Canada waters from US if you didn't touch land, anchor or pull along side another boat. He didn't know what US rules were for the converse. I then asked that were there any reporting requirements as far as Canada is concerned for reentering waters from a temporary excursion into the US side. He did not have an answer for that."

And, you'd be going by a whole bunch of good fishing spots. I wouldn't even bother."
