That’s all changing soon though. Heading to the cottage for bass opener here in Toronto and maybe a redo of the canoe trip in July and then the big fly in to Miniss with SFO in August. I am now getting lake fever, thinking about all of the things I love about these trips and memories created https://www.northernjacks.com/post/lake-feverCheers Andrew"
