6659846,DanM57,2022-05-29 06:07:00,135,I am curious if anyone has been to Anderson's Manitou Falls Camp or Knotty Pines already this year and how the fishing was? We leave next Sat for Anderson's. I will post a report when we get back. DanM

But the hourly changes in the road conditions and detours, plus info from Mike saying they were expecting more flooding in the area caused us to detour to Minnitaki. We had a great week on Minnitaki, and hope to visit Manitou Falls in 2023. Hated to change Â‘day of' but there were just too many variables - including the fact we had never fished there before, and trying to learn a new area of the river system during high water/flooded conditions did not appeal. Neither did getting stuck trying to drag our boats through some detour chewed up by commercial trucks and other things.Hate it for the camps up that way, and all the camps suffering (this time) from the flooding and high water.Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk"

6661062,DanM57,2022-06-02 07:27:00,135,We are still going. We are looking at it as an adventure! Road conditions as much as lake levels have us anxious. Should be interesting.
6661070,ia bhtr,2022-06-02 08:04:00,212,"We did rebook for 1st week July , actually looking like a short drive thru water @Buller Crek is doable , even tho the road closed signs are still up"
6663748,DanM57,2022-06-12 06:08:00,135,"We just got back from Manitou Falls. As for the roads, 105 is still marked closed. We took the detour both up and back. It was horrible! Water level was up about 10 feet. The Barnstrum rapids were fast but no big deal. There were some really interesting ""swirls"" down stream from the rapids where the 2 currents around the island meet. Hang on tight! Once you found fish you were in business but finding them was a challenge. All of our classic shoreline (rock) points of reference were under water. Black flies in Unexpected made it almost unfishable. One of the guys in our group has been going to Manitou Falls since the mid 70's and said he had never seen the system like it was last week! Good luck, stay safe. DanM"
