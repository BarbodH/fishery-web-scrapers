6660152,Old Timer,2022-05-30 10:19:00,255,"The Canadian map series should have coverage for the Atikwa Lake area. It's not a nav map and I suspect one isn't available. However, your camp should have something to give you. I don't recall Atikwa was difficult to navigate when I was there many years ago. Back then I had a preliminary map. It's a pretty lake with mostly trout and some snakes. Then one or two portage lakes with a few walleyes. I remember a larger camp towards the center of the lake and a smaller boat-in/portage camp towards the south. Good luck on your trip."
6660174,LoDo,2022-05-30 11:14:00,721,A group of us were under contract to buy a small island with cottage on this lake. We found out it was primarily a trout lake and went in another direction. I believe the cottage is still for sale. I've heard its a beautiful lake. Good luck! Be sure and send a report of your trip when done.
6660600,Eagle1,2022-05-31 13:17:00,28,Sent you a PM. I have a map from the early 2000's that I used when I went there 3 separate times. Lake is primarily good for Lake Trout and Northerns.
