6664054,SterlingArcher,2022-06-13 09:41:00,92,Idk about that. I've grilled lakers close to a year after freezing them and they tasted great. Fish is always best fresh though.
6664056,N_of_Quibell,2022-06-13 09:49:00,151,"I try to take care of them, once I decide to kill them. This includes 1) Pithing them immediately (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikejime), 2) Keeping them cold back to camp, 3) Vacuuming packing them before freezing immediately. I haven't kept them much longer than 6 months but they seemed ok."
6663810,N_of_Quibell,2022-06-12 10:43:00,151,"Hopefully someone can clarify this for me - it's a problem I encountered a few weeks ago. I typically stay in a camp in Fish Management Zone 4, for which the lake trout possession limit is S-2, only one of which may be over 22"" (2022 Regs p30). Suppose I catch and keep a 23 incher in FMZ 4. Next day, I fish FMZ 5, where the possession limit is S-2 and no size restrictions (except during Sept; 2022 Regs, p37). Suppose I catch a 23 incher while fishing in FMZ 5. Can I legally take it back to camp in FMZ 4, where I already have another 23 incher in the freezer? This would put me over the possession limit for FMZ 4, although it would be apparently fine for FMZ 5. Or would the Province-wide possession limit of 3 (2022 Regs p 12) apply? The simple solution is of course to release the FMZ 5 fish, which is what I did."

6663842,reddemon2,2022-06-12 11:32:00,255,Simple solution would be just catch n release
6663856,walleyecheek,2022-06-12 12:30:00,2231,"This zone, that zone, everywhere a zone, zone. Slot size this zone., that zone. Canadian fishing regs are confusing !"
6663886,v-bay gord,2022-06-12 15:00:00,3168,"There is Provincial limit that applies if you are fishing more than one zone. I had no clue this existed until someone mentioned it a couple years ago. I checked with a C.O. and it isn't common knowledge with most anglers.....but it is in the regs. Back to the post, how you prove the second 23 incher is from a different zone might be the sticking point.......probably best to use common sense."
6663954,N_of_Quibell,2022-06-12 21:13:00,151,"Thanks for the feedback - I had seen the provincial limit of 3 thing, but it seemed sufficiently vague to me that it wasn't worth risking, especially since I seem to be a CO magnet (""yes officer, you can trust me, I caught it in another zone""). Plus I'd never be allowed to live it down if I came home with a ticket...."
6663972,prov1800,2022-06-13 04:27:00,5010,"I like eating smaller lake trout 20"" and under."
6664018,Bakefish,2022-06-13 07:46:00,1077,Trout don't freeze well. At least not for long.
6664052,N_of_Quibell,2022-06-13 09:38:00,151,"I do too, when I can catch them. Aerobus is my usual eater trout lake, but I was leery about trying Timberpoint Rd this year. We ate a George Lake splake a few nights ago - you had mentioned they are good eating, and I definitely agree. A small landing at George would be nice - I had to rappel my sportboat down to the water. I'm getting too old for such nonsense - I worked for that little splake! Interestingly, it's stomach contents were whirlygig beetles."
