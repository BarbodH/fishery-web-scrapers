We were returning from Ghost River camp and had heard that they were building the road. We decided to take a look because no one at the lodge knew for sure. Well, we got there and sure enough there was a road, but it was gravel. We figured that at some point it would turn into paved road. We were wrong. Since the road wasn't traveled it was in fine shape and we made pretty good time. Every time we passed a group of workers they stopped working and looked at us like we were crazy. We were very concerned that perhaps the road didn't go all the way through, but it did. We were towing a u-haul loaded with our gear which was new when we rented it, not so much when we returned it. The front of it was shot blasted down to bare metal and the plastic coned hubcaps were nothing but ragged plastic rings."

First of all you have to get to it 71 which means running through Fort Francis and Emo. For some reason there is a lot more traffic on Hwy 11 west of the Fort than west. 71 also carries more traffic and the towns along the way will slow you down. If you don't care about time 71 is a pleasant drive and the Narrows is a good place for a lunch stop, there are some interesting shops and you can play a round of mini-golf."

6659548,Bill Krejca,2022-05-27 12:22:00,6107,"I remember shortly after it opened, the shops in Nester Falls lost enough business that some went under/changed their operation. Helliar's, for example, used to have a diner which did pretty good, owner told me the reason they closed it down was due to folks taking the new route. Pulling a boat, I still prefer 71. Bill"
6659554,walleyecheek,2022-05-27 12:37:00,2231,Still have pretty good ice cream cones though ! (Helliar's)
6661734,Skywagon,2022-06-05 06:51:00,1106,"I just read on a local highway updates page that water is starting to creep up in a couple of places on the south end of highway 502. The Crow Rock bridge will be the one to keep an eye on, the water has not crested on the watershed down there yet after all of this time. This is one for the record books."
6662166,Pat T,2022-06-06 13:28:00,221,"We took 71 on the way up to Gullrock, and then took 502 on the way back the other day. I was surprised how much rougher the ride was on 71 because several years ago, it was the better of the two highways. Now, I think the other way around. 502 does have much more curves, but in my opinion a better road. We saved half hour by taking 502."
6663704,packpro,2022-06-11 21:22:00,695,"Took 502 on June 3. Road is in great shape. Saw 3 bears, one with a cub. Saw 2 moose, and two deer. All on the side of the road. Made the trip interesting. We always gas up in International Falls. Great scenery on that road. Some times you can get caught behind a slow train of fishermen hauling up their boats. Be patient, there are opportunities to pass."
6658996,10point,2022-05-25 06:21:00,102,"Hi there, I am going up to Eagle Lake on June 4th. Any reason why I would want to take 71 instead of 502? 71 shows it's like 20 minutes longer for me. First time making this trip."
6659008,Ricky Spanish,2022-05-25 07:15:00,1298,I always take 502 to Eagle. I've heard others say 71 is better because of more places to stop for gas or other things along the way and less critters to look out for. I don't know about you but the last leg of a 600 mile trip for me is worth saving 20min. I think 502 has some of the nicest scenery I've seen on a road trip.
6659012,Pooch,2022-05-25 07:28:00,4618,"Apples vs Oranges. Subject has been discussed forever here on WC. 71 is easier to drive with help if needed. Much easier drive for the non adventurous among us. 502 can be somewhat intense on change over days with some folks driving a safe pace and others ramming and jamming on a road that is pretty unforgiving with help a long time away if needed. Pretty much every time we go 502 we see a broken down vehicle, especially boat trailers with failed wheels. Once you turn north or south on 502 you are on your own until you reach the other end. No cell available. Twenty minutes is irreverent. Both drives are pretty. If I'm traveling alone with a boat I lean towards 71 if going north at Vermilion Bay. Going east out of Dryden then I have to take 502. It's a toss up and much depends on your comfort zone. Pooch"
6659014,Eyes_R_Us,2022-05-25 07:35:00,66,"In the 20 years that I have been making the trip to Eagle Lake I think all but 2 of them have been up 502. It has improved a lot over the years but still has the backwoods charm that everyone talks about. On 502 you just have to realize that you are on your own as there is no cell phone coverage, very few places to pull off the road and no services. If you have any questions about the reliability of your vehicle it is not a good route to take. We have to go through the town of Eagle River and then on out to camp. The first year (2002) was a wet one also. We took HWY17 and the road was underwater at one point but they were letting cars drive through it. Might be the same situation this year but I think there is a detour option as well. There are some other active posts on here about it."
6659126,Ricky Spanish,2022-05-25 12:26:00,1298,"Pooch makes good points. I'm always headed to Temple Bay, so it's 502 to 594 through Eagle River for me. If I was going to Vermilion Bay or Lac Seul I'd probably come up the other side. And I've stopped numerous times along 502 to take a leak. Just make sure to do it on a long straight stretch so traffic will have plenty of time to see your rig...and hopefully just your rig."
6659148,Riding high,2022-05-25 13:33:00,69,"I take hwy71 now days. Been up 502 a few dozen times. 71 has a shoulder if you have problems. You have a couple of towns to break up the boredom. And I have cell service most of that way. I've seen a motor home hit a moose, flat tires, bearing problems, newer trucks with problems. Seen all I need to see of 502 unless I go back to Sioux lookout again."
6659178,Old Timer,2022-05-25 15:16:00,255,"Been both ways many times. But side with Pooch on this one, especially at night and/or dragging a boat. At my age 20 minutes doesn't mean much anymore."
6659368,Bakefish,2022-05-26 09:47:00,1077,"I've been taking 502 since it opened, in fact before it opened. I love that road, but you're right, I've seen some doozies on that road. I recall an accident where two vehicles towing boats in opposite directions must have both drifted over the centerline on a curve. Their wheels must have caught each other. I can't even imagine the mega jolt would have felt like. Both guys and their vehicles appeared to be ok, their boats and trailers...not so much."
6659378,Eckohlt,2022-05-26 10:25:00,3685,Do you know what year 502 opened up??
6659490,SteveZ,2022-05-27 06:04:00,271,71 has less traffic and very seldom see OPP.
