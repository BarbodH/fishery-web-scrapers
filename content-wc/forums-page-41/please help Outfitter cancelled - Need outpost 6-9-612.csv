6661818,NM_Trout,2022-06-05 11:18:00,1094,"I checked with Loon Haunt. They have availability at their central camp called Goose lake. It is only Loon Haunt guests on the lake, but there are other cabins there. This is a great lake, but it is not an American plan. You will need to bring food and linens. They can handle a group of 8 for your timeframe, but it sounds as though it is the last opening available. You need to contact them asap, primarily because they will need to get your flight scheduled.Contact Bill Coppen at Loon Haunt OutpostsBox 1344Red Lake ON P0V 2M0807-735-2400[email protected]www.loonhaunt.com If you end up there, let me know. I can provide a brief summary of where to fish.P.S. They fly out of Red Lake Ontario"

6661834,Friedo35,2022-06-05 13:01:00,18,"Thanks guys for all the help!!! You all are such a great resource and good people. It is nice to know there are still good folks out there during these times! Thanks again to all, and also to Janet and Lars for getting us a spot with less than 72 hours notice!!"
6661836,Eckohlt,2022-06-05 13:17:00,3685,Good luck slaying the fish friedo!make sure n report back on devils rapids.

6663880,Friedo35,2022-06-12 13:58:00,18,"Just back stateside after the trip To Devils Rapids with Knobby’s. It was nothing short of a spectacular trip. Weather was great. Fishing was amazing and was honestly stupid easy. The water was very high which caused some issues both at camp with docks being unusable and typical shorelines not available but it also made the flow over the rapids much bigger and it seemed like all the fish in the lake came to see. Water temps went from 53 on 6/8 to 60 yesterday and the fish were on fire. We had 3 boats out and caught at least 300 walleye every day and plenty of northern mixed in. At one point, all 6 of us were hooked up at the same time within 15 yards of each other. Average size was around 17” but plenty over 20”. Knobby’s was excellent and went over the top taking care us us. Their pilots were great too. Hope everyone has great trips this year!!!"
6661640,Friedo35,2022-06-04 16:11:00,18,We got cancelled on last minute. Need an outpost or location for 7 guys. Fly in 6/8 and out 6/12. Let me know of any options
6661644,Eckohlt,2022-06-04 16:50:00,3685,Get on the phone and start calling outfitters.
6661648,Friedo35,2022-06-04 17:05:00,18,Way ahead of you. Any suggestions
6661654,Eckohlt,2022-06-04 17:24:00,3685,"Probably best to call outfitters with many outpost,such as Clark's flyin fishing there loaded with outposts.I'm flying with pickerel arm camps you could try them,but there are so many more,good luck."
6661656,kasmere,2022-06-04 17:24:00,20,assuming Ontario. Amik out of Red Lake is maybe a possibility
6661658,acplumber,2022-06-04 17:35:00,80,Leuenbergers out of nakina. They have a bunch of outposts and their own planes and are a great outfitter. Really haven’t heard anything negative about any of the outfitters from nakina.
6661660,SweetD,2022-06-04 17:52:00,243,Try Slate Falls Outposts. That is pretty prime time but maybe. I’m guessing Clarks’s might have an opening…….. Wright Lake would be good if you can get in!
6661662,SweetD,2022-06-04 17:53:00,243,And what Outfitter canceled you and why when you get a chance????
6661672,RichA$1970,2022-06-04 19:40:00,1159,Call Chimo in Red Lake. Who was your outfitter and why did they cancel?
