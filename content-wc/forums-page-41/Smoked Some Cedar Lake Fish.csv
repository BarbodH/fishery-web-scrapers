One of the problems with smoking these species is that if you zip the fillets before smoking, the amount of shrinkage which takes place is considerable, due to the reduced amount of flesh which is left. I left the fillets whole for smoking, but before eating, I ran a knife down both sides of the zip line (similar to a normal zip). The result was a good eat with an absolute minimum of bones to pick out of my mouth, and the reduction seemed less than zipping before the smoke. Something worth trying, if you haven't. Bill"

6663240,Bill Krejca,2022-06-09 14:59:00,6107,"I ran my pellet smoker 2 hours at 175, used a 1/8 mix of salt/brown sugar, layered, for around 5 hours, 2 hours in front of fan to create pellicle. Bill"
6663284,prov1800,2022-06-09 19:17:00,5010,Sounds tasty.Never had smoked walleye or crappie.would seem it would get dry not being a fatty fish like trout.
6663376,Bill Krejca,2022-06-10 06:03:00,6107,"Yeah, I have to be careful not to smoke for too long, or that can happen, creating the pellicle helps seal in some of the moisture. The result is definitely not the same as when smoking a fish with more oil, around home, smoked carp and buffalo, other river fish with a higher oil content are considered good for smoking. Several years ago, I brought my smoker north and smoked a bunch of crappies at the camp, gave some to the neighbors, they thought they were pretty good, one cabin even responded with a trade of homemade bread. Bill"

6663572,prov1800,2022-06-11 05:12:00,5010,Can see some coming up near bottom on sonar.
6663576,Eckohlt,2022-06-11 05:58:00,3685,"Thanks,it grows fast when the suns out n warmer weather."
6663578,Bill Krejca,2022-06-11 06:02:00,6107,"Re: No crappies - Yeah, during the period between cold water and spawn the crappie can just seem to disappear, making for tough fishing. Around home, my best luck had been to fish deeper water, the strikes being so light as to be almost discernable, no boat movement to speak of, slooowww fishing. Brother-in-law was up a week ago, he got but a handful in Peephole, although weather was miserable. Bill"
