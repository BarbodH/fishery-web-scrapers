6662742,txk4,2022-06-08 07:22:00,31,"I had to re enter my information and scan the vaccination cards/passports again. I believe it had to do with the update done to the ArriveCan when they dropped the need for a current test. Or it was my own lack of tech skills and computer knowledge, which is also quite likely. Either way it went smoothly and was no problem. Crossing was easy. T"

TIA"

If you select passport, my phone (android) starts the camera and it starts looking for a passport page to automatically scan in. This worked for one of my passports, but I had to select ""Enter Manually"" for another passport, and I had to type the info in."

6663074,kona77,2022-06-08 21:08:00,236,"OK I have a similar question on the Passport data. I also entered my data on-line and manually entered the Passport numbers, names, date of births etc. The on-line system did not ask for an actual download copy/PDF file of my passport. The on-line system did ask for a download copy of our Vac data which I did supply . I have completed all the data and have gone back several times under the ""edit"" function and do not see where I can even download a PDF file of my Passport.I downloaded the Phone App and saw all my information for the group of 4 guys, including all the manual passport data I entered .. I see it gave me the option of scanning the Passport or loading the data manually (which I did on-line).. Assume that means they really do not need the actual photo of the passport since I loaded the pertinent data manually. Hope this question makes sense?EDIT- I just saw ELway12's reply and I believe he answered my question and a photo of the passport is not really needed. I also show my group as being ""registered"" under the traveler data.."
