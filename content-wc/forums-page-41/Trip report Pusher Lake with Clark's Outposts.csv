6662152,Larry S,2022-06-06 12:34:00,665,"My sister & I ventured to Canada May 28 to June 4th to Clark's outpost at Pusher Lake We flew into Minneapolis from Las Vegas arriving on 26th at 230pm, delayed due to plane issues. We then picked up a rental car and drove to Ft Francis arriving at 10Pm, crossed border with no hassle in 3 minutes. Proceeded to the Super 8 motel . Got up next morning ,left at 8am drove to Kenora ,bought all our food. Left Kenora at about 1pm drove to the Northside Motel in Vermillion Bay getting there at 4pm..Went down road on Hwy 17 to a food truck at Shell station and got Burgers, fries and drink. Had a 7am flight out so we got up at 530Am to drive up Hwy105 to where fly-in base was. Had to Detour about 8 miles around 105,took 647 off of 17 to Quibel Rd then to 105 and on to Clarks it was semi-rough as we had a car and not an SUV or Truck. Arrived at base in time flew out at 720am, got to lake at 8am off loaded ,checked facilities ,temp was cold at 46 started a fire. Got situated, rigged up and had some lunch. Went fishing at 11am until 4pm. Lake temps at 50 to 53 got 20some fish ,brought in 3 walleyes, cleaned them . I had a fish dinner as sister can't eat fish The whole week was very cold, with frequent high winds. On Tuesday we had 3 to 4 ft white caps, high winds, rain and even hail, plus air temps of low 40""sneedless to say we stayed in cabin all day Runn Down of fish caught by day Saturday 28th--24 fish , Sunday 29th 55 fish with 23 in walleye our biggest of week, Monday 30th-48 fish including a 35 in pike my sister got, Tuesday 31st 0 fish, Wednesday June 1st-33 fish, Thursday 2nd--71 fish including a 41 in pike sister caught, Friday June 3rd we got 81 fish. Most of the walleye here in 17 to 23 range. Lots of 20's,21's,22's and the lone 23 The minnows provided helped a lot . we got most fish in 4 to 9 ft of water. Water temps did not get above 55 all week The Cold and wind along with the rain & hail made fishing very uncomfortable most of the time, but we persisted. Total fish we caught was around 400. Not bad for Crappy weather & post spawn fish All in All a good trip for early May. we are headed for North Caribou Lake with Pickle Lake Outfitters June 27 to July 8,I hope the weather will be Better Larry Schroeder"
