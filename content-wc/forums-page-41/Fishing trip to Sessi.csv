6657018,dschiebel,2022-05-18 02:03:00,85,Out trip for 4 of us was cancelled due to high water and ice way up north. Received word From Northern wilderness outfitters that it would not happen. We were set to leave Friday the 19th and fly back on the 28th. They just couldn't get every thing done the needed to be. So good luck to everybody we will be crying in our brandy godfathers. Hoping to snag a Sept Trip with them latter this fall.

Now I live in Germany, and I will remember those times again. I almost missed the fishing season but managed to book a ticket for a long trip https://www.dbfahrplan.com/de/! I will get there faster by train than by car! I even have a little memo and a minimum set of provisions per person who is somewhat away from civilization. It is necessary to prepare responsibly! It would not hurt to take a lot of food and a few spare fishing rods. I'll take a lot of pictures! Hopefully, someone - something useful!"
