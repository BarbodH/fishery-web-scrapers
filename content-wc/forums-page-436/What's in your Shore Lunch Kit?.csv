Most OPP also use their judgement and like previously mentioned, if there is a small amount that looks like it is for cooking and lunch they won't give you a hard time, so long as it is not open."

1438593,bigwalleye1,2012-05-21 19:42:00,2632,"RickOnt, Help yourself! Glad to be of service."
1438624,Rivratz,2012-05-21 20:20:00,105,"You already have it nailed! Just need a quick dessert like cookies that was mentioned. I do like the fish taco idea. A simple twist on flavor, and so easy. Please pack out more than you brought in if necessary. I hate it when you land at a popular shore lunch spot and someone else's trash is laying around. Like beer tops, paper, foill, etc... People that leave any type of trash after there shore lunches are just plain IGNORANTl Edit Tags Tags None"
1438779,octanehi5,2012-05-22 07:59:00,1104,"We have a spot that everyone meets at about 6miles from camp. shore lunch it just what it says.go on shore build a FIRE cast iron pan, peanut oil,as we get the fire nice and hot someone filets the walleye . we bring already made homefries with onions and bacon in the potatoes Bring a bowl to mix beer batter in ,plates and forks from camp cook fish heat up homefries Eat and drink beer and then light a nice cigar. Thats a real shore lunch. of corse you do not leave any garbage. then go back fishing"
1439425,dustn98,2012-05-23 08:44:00,2,I've never been to Canada so this will be our first year and this is a little off topic but I was under the impression you couldn't have or drink beer in a boat in Canada but I'm reading posts about people drinking during thier shore lunches. Please help me out
1439432,RapShad,2012-05-23 08:57:00,76,"You're right this needs to be clarified for the new folks out there. It is ILLEGAL to have alcoholic beverages in the boat while you are fishing. The ONLY time you can have alcohol in your boat is if you are heading to a campsite, but the containers cannot be open. If someone out there is going to break the laws they should be prepared to face the consequences. The OPP and MNR will punish you and they do not tolerate this type of behavior. I'm pretty sure the same rules apply if they stop while you are at shore lunch and drinking beers too, because they will ask you how the beer got to the shore lunch."
1439442,Rivratz,2012-05-23 09:23:00,105,"By law, you are only allowed to transport alcohol in a boat to a camp that is not accessible by any roads. A boat only to camp. You are chancing getting a ticket and fined for having only one beer in your cooler. I have been checked on the water numerous times by OPP ""Ontario Provincial Police"". They want to see your fishing license, life vests per person, live well ""for fish"", cooler for alcohol & fish, make sure you have a working horn, and asked where are you staying. If you have fish at your camp,""filets in freezer or fridge"" and they check your camp, you will be in some deep manure if you have more fish than your supposed to. You will be breaking the law if you have your license max in your freezer at the camp, and have fish in your live well for shore lunch. Only if they check both. It can happen. Also, the camp owner won't be pleased with you either! It's best not to have alcohol in the boat ever, and know how many fish you are possessing at all times."
1439487,Rivratz,2012-05-23 11:06:00,105,"It's best to carry a govt. issued picture ID with you at all times. DL or passport card preferred. OPP, if checked, will probably ask for some type of ID to make sure that you are who you say you are. You should always be totally prepared for an on water stop. It's best not too joke around with them if stopped. They just want straight, courteous answers to their questions. When all checks out clean, have a nice day officers! Period! You want them to disappear as quickly as they appeared! You are going to have so much fun in Canada! It's going to be like your first French Kiss, with the prettiest girl in school! If you can remember what that was like? Amazing!! You're gonna be hooked forever! :cheers"
1439539,Guest,2012-05-23 13:49:00,0,"Dustn98, I assume you are referring to Ontario laws. As other posters have accurately reported, you cannot have beer (open or sealed) in your boat unless you are on you way to your cabin/campsite. Officially, no frostys in the boat or cool ones at shore lunch. When checked on the water a few years ago by the OPP they said if they caught us with a bunch of beers in a cooler we would be ticketed, But they further said they would not ticket if they only found a few Â– with the understanding one can might be for fish batter and one per person for a lunch beverage. I do not believe they would tolerate more than one beer per person at shore lunch."
1439607,@Lunker,2012-05-23 15:57:00,835,"I'd throw in some extra bacon, onions, molasses and brown sugar to jazz up the beans."
1438393,RickOnt,2012-05-21 12:42:00,217,"Hey GuysWe usually do shore Lunch at least 3 times a week. It is always Fish,Potatoes,Beans and onions.However it seams we always forget something!!!So I am making up a ""Kit"" that I will keep together.Lots of great ideas so far keep em comming.ThanksRick"
1438399,JayM5209,2012-05-21 12:56:00,1050,"Some good and complete lists already, so just an additional idea or two.Two burner Coleman gas stove if there's a fire ban. Otherwise, a light weight grate with folding legs that's just big enough for two skillets (fish and potatoes). Skip the pan for beans, it's just one more to remember and then wash. Get a cheap clamping can/pan handle from a camping supply place like Campmor and heat the beans in the can. I take a small camp ax to make the fire building easier. Leave the cutting board at home. A paddle serves well as a filleting board. Don't forget a strong garbage bag to throw the skillets and utensels in after lunch. It's easier to wash dishes back at camp. Everything we need packs neatly in a fairly small plastic tub with lid.Oh, . . . . and one cigar per person for after lunch!"
1438403,Pikeslayer8,2012-05-21 13:05:00,1460,"Sometimes if I feel ambitious, I will make foil packs to throw in the fire and make the shore lunch itself a bit easier. Par boil a few taters skin on. Throw a few peppers and fresh mushrooms on the grill at camp and cook till done. Slice it all up and let everything cool and place on a chunk of foil, season to your liking and add your favorite cheese such as provolone and wrap up secure. Don't be afraid to use two pieces of foil. Delicious! Another thing that should be on the lists above is salt and pepper and lemon pepper. I really don't know how copacetic this is, but when we are all done with lunch, we burn the oil in the contained fire pit we built and put our fish pan upside down on top of the fire and get it red hot and rush it to the lake for a quick dip. Comes out pretty clean. Always put the fire completely out!"
1438449,oldschooltiller,2012-05-21 14:33:00,515,"I don't do shore lunch so I'm just thinking here, but for me a camp type stove would be necessary just to speed up the process. I'd rather fish than watch a fire get prepared to cook with."
1438459,Pikeslayer8,2012-05-21 14:49:00,1460,"Now that's not very Oldschool is it. Take a few minutes, take a deep breath and enjoy yourself a bit. The walleye aren't going anywhere. Shore lunch is something special. By the time the fillet crew is done the fire crew has the fire ready. It doesn't take that long at all. Cuts down on the skeeters as well. We get the firewood from a beaver house. Nice dry hardwoods!"
1438534,SinOrSwim,2012-05-21 17:30:00,1528,"MorganMan has our list but it ALL goes in a tote. Has much of what people have discussed.We take the big propane fish cooker from the camp with us. We just split up the gear into different boats. In addition, a big turkey fryer thermometer. Keeping that temp exactly where you want it makes everything taste better and keeps things moving along. Stinks to take the time to clean a fish and then accidentally fry the crap out of it because the oil got too hot. Long tongs!!! I'm amazed at how many people don't do shore lunches. It's one of the favorite parts of our trips for all of us. Nothing better than catching walleye all morning and cooking up for lunch.My guess is they have gotten tired of plain fish planks with beans. But, with a little more effort and planning you can have fish tacos or other variations that are awesome. Take a bag of shredded lettuce or cabbage, some onion, pre-fried bacon bits in a ziplock and a couple different sauces. Chipotle sour cream or wing sauce all the way to ranch or tartar. Toss it in a tortilla, which take up no space and boom, an awesome shore lunch. Add some baked beans and you are set."
1438542,Bigstorm,2012-05-21 17:41:00,799,"I'm with you on this, I'd much rather spend my time out in the boat fishing when up there rather than taking the extra time to watch fish cook (or get ready to cook).Relaxing in the boat fishing is where I am the most relaxed"
1438546,bigwalleye1,2012-05-21 18:05:00,2632,"+1 for Rapshad I'd add paper plates, plastic forks, a roll of paper towels to drain fish, a roll of TP, dish soap a wash rag and a dry rag. Sliced canned spuds are the way to fly. We still use canned crisco, one tin will do lunch, and we dump it afterward. Tried oil years ago and saw the cook wind up dumping it in the boat (not mine, and never again). We've stepped up to a turkey fryer with 3/8 round rod legs, cut em off, welded pipe stems on, the legs plug into the stems, and now its more transportable and I can use an 11lb LP cylinder that fits into the third battery compartment on my Pro V. I get the added joy of watching some ""safe-nik"" flip when he sees a 35k BTU burner with removeable legs! I get all the heat I want, and with an 8 qt dutch oven, I can have hot grease ready by the time the fish are cleaned. Spuds get started right away while fish are being cleaned. We use a cast iron chicken fryer with a lid, so when the spuds are done, dump the beans in, give a quick stir, lid goes on to hold heat, grease gets heated, fish goes in, and we all eat together. Life in Canada is too short to eat sandwiches in the boat....."
1438552,jiggster,2012-05-21 18:19:00,183,"Last year we microwave the potates. Quicker to cook. This year we thinking of bringing the a tube of frozen bread dough. Put round balls in the oil, little butter , taste great."
1438563,Rivratz,2012-05-21 18:36:00,105,"Don't forget to pack a roll or 2 of toilet paper! Shore lunches are awesome. It should be done at least once especially if there is a newbie in the group! It's a great way to get out of the boat and stretch your muscles. Don't agree with the sandy beach thing. F'n sand gets in everything. Great for parking the boat though. A flat rocky space on the leeward side of an island is best. I wouldn't carry any alcohol in the boat. Save it for the evening back at the cabin. Again, don't forget the TP. Actually TP should alway's be in the boat in a waterproof container or ziplock bag. Most importantly, ""Only you can prevent a forest fire""!"
1438354,RickOnt,2012-05-21 11:48:00,217,Anyone have a list?What do I need?ThanksRick
1438356,chevtow,2012-05-21 11:50:00,691,Enough gas to make it back to camp to eat
1438358,Bigstorm,2012-05-21 11:53:00,799,"Our shore lunches are usually brats, burgers or pulled pork. We save the fish for dinner each night. We cook the lunch on a small camp stove"
1438363,oldschooltiller,2012-05-21 12:00:00,515,"I actually have not used them yet, but I have a couple Coleman camp fuel stoves that are a single burner w/carry case. Those would probably be really convenient for that."
1438369,Shorelunch,2012-05-21 12:09:00,554,"Let's see. Old cast iron fry pan Oil Charcoal lighter fluid Matches Newspaper Grate Spatula Can opener Flour Eggs Batter Seasoning Ketchup Onions for onion rings - use same batter as fish Beans Cookies We keep everything in a ""shorelunch"" tub."
1438371,camp chef,2012-05-21 12:12:00,915,"We don't do them anymore because of all the work, but we used to haul a propane deep fryer 2 gallons of oil, paper towels, breading paper plates ,rye bread, onion, tartar sauce, beans, chips, plastic forks or spoons. salt and pepper, a board to clean fish on, a card table and chairs and a beer or two each. We found it more relaxing to cook back at the cabin or just have sandwiches in the boat."
1438378,RapShad,2012-05-21 12:24:00,76,"Here's the traditional shore lunch kit (none of this hot dogs and burgers bulls***, c'mon guys no one goes to Canada enough times a year to pass up delicious walleye in the Canadian wilderness)Coleman Camp Stove with two burnersSmall propane tank (usually can find these anywhere they sell camping equipment)Small pot (for baked beans)2 cast iron skillets (one small, one larger)wooden spoonleather glove to hold skilletslarge flipperplastic fillet boardsharp fillet knifecan openervegetable oil (used to use lard, but tried vegetable oil once, and tastes the same and much much more healthier for you)2 cans of sliced potatoes1 onion (mixed in with potatoes)1 can of Busch's baked beans w/ baconfish mixtrash bag1.5-2 walleyes under 17 inches per personThis is what we've been doing for the past 13 years and my dad has been doing for the past 35 up in the MAPB lakes and Lac Seul. We've added in a few extra things here and there but pretty much these are the essentials Usually you are going to want to find a nice pebble or sandy beach to anchor the boat on. On a lot of lakes there are places that are used for shore lunches, moose camps, or mine camps and some might even have a prep table built already. Be aware during drier summers canadian government will not allow campfires, so the coleman stove is a must. Don't take any chances if you think there might be the possibility of a fire. This year looks like it might be one of those summers."
1438385,Pikeslayer8,2012-05-21 12:30:00,1460,Nice list. Very appropriate giving your handle. Also a good idea is to tape the list on the tub lid. Often times somebody will dig into the tub for something they needed and not replace it. We have had a guy pull out the fish flipper/spatula at breakfast and we ended up on the other side of the lake without one. We fashioned a tree branch into one and made due. Seems like we always forget something.
1438388,RapShad,2012-05-21 12:36:00,76,"That's a great idea with the list! I also forgot to put plastic forks on the list, which makes sense because I forgot to pack forks last year and had to fashion some from some whittled pine branches."
1438392,Pikeslayer8,2012-05-21 12:41:00,1460,"Right, the forks. We will bring sliced bread for fish sandwiches as well as a lemon. Tarter sauce for those who need it."
