Fishing Sawmill bay, most fish seem to have moved to spots in Sawmill closer to the main lake. 4 FOW has been key for us, we cast so 4-8fow is prob more accurate. Tried lots of depths but his has been the best. Wish we could get into some larger schools. How is everyone else doing? We have been using jigs and minnow and or leech. Had some great luck on minnows on slip bobber also, I caught this dandy today in 4ft of water on a lindy rig. My first 30""!!!"

1439494,teddi,2012-05-23 11:21:00,349,We did numbers opening weekend. Lots of 16 to 18 inchers but nothing large so far. I have all summer to look for the 30 inch plus walleye. Picked up a 48 inch northern in 14 inches of water right on shore. Glad to see sawmill is working for you Knox.

1439644,Knoxabilly,2012-05-23 17:32:00,225,"Hey Teddi, where did you guys fish? I didn't get a chance to talk to you again before you packed up. We tried Iran creek, got lots of Northerns but no Walleye. We fished Banatyne too but didn't get an overwhelming amount. 48"" Northern! Nice work"
