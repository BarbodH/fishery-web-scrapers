1438259,acplumber,2012-05-21 08:58:00,80,"Hi, this is a question for anyone that has used this outfitter or that has had the same problem on a fly-in. I was going through my stuff last nite and was thinking that I will probly be over my wait limit by about 40-50 pounds, there are 6 in our group and imagine that everyone will be a little over. My question is- Is this bad for the plane? Will they make us pay for being over(which is fine, I know rules are rules) or will they make us leave some things behind? Some things I dont think I could like Beer or a boat seat. Have you had the same experience? Thanks acplumber"
1438276,dog2,2012-05-21 09:30:00,198,They will charge you for the over weight. Check with them on their overage rates it was $1.00#.Some of their boats have seats. If you dont need all your beer when you fly in have them bring it in on the check flight most fly ins will do this .
1438326,phishfearme,2012-05-21 10:48:00,1242,"this is a constant issue on flyins. each person - weather he's 300lbs or 150lbs gets 100 pounds of gear. so where is the safety issue? each plane has an ability to carry a certain amount of weight - if your group is the only one on that plane then your group should be able to use that weight - not some arbitrary per person weight limit. over the last few years, the flyin service we've been using has gotten away from that per person limit and is now more focused on airplane safety and weighing the people and gear. luckily, with our group of 4 and the air service using an otter, we have no real weight limits - even though the outfitter asks up to target 100lbs per person. the outfitter frequently uses the flight with our ""light group"" to carry gear into his outpost. i would ask the flight service what is the basis for the 100 limit - if it's a limit. it's hard to convince me that it's a safety issue - it's more like a money making opportunity. phish"
1438338,wallydave,2012-05-21 11:18:00,2151,"Like Phish said, no matter the weight of the person it is the gear that usually gets you the overage. I wonder if it more of a fuel cost issue than anything else. Knowing the limits and what you need to bring is just a way the outfitters letting us know what to prepare for, if you know what the limits are and show up over, its not the outfitters fault."
1438342,pike50plus,2012-05-21 11:35:00,584,Some have a total on passengers and gear 1600 is about ave for a Beaver. The extar cost is for full since they must have a certain amount of full for the weight carried in flight.
1438513,Ogoki,2012-05-21 16:33:00,291,"A freind and I flew in , just the two of us . We had 280 lbs of gear . The 3 cases of pop and some minnows in bags of water put us over . The air service hit us up for and extra $100 . I quizzed them about a Beaver being able to haul 1200 lbs and they said I was correct but that was their policy . We paid it and went on . The service we use now takes my wife and I along with two of our labs and there is no extra charges . Now if there is four guys and gear , in a Beaver then I can see if there is an extra stop to drop off our overweight, then some extra cost is in order , maybe . Also the air service that charged us overweight fees also charged us for ice and using their phone . Needless to say we have not been back there . It did not cost them ANYMORE to take the two of us in with 80 lbs overweight . I definitely do not want to fly in an over loaded plane , but I like to feel like I am treated fair . Where I go now I have been going since 1999 and plan on going this summer . Every outfitter in business has to make a living but being nickeled and dimed in these lean years will hurt them more than help them. The outfitter we use has a 150 lb weight limit for gear."
1438580,phishfearme,2012-05-21 19:03:00,1242,ogoki - i think you did the right thing by not re-using the outfitter that charged you for a meaningless overweight - i hope you told him about it also. we've only been charged twice for meaningless overweight and i made ****n sure that they knew that i was not bringing my group back. (we do 10 day trips and are alway a little overweight) one did call me back and appologized (without a refund) and he has since changed policy. the only way to get any meaningfull change is for guys like us to make sure our displeasure is clear. i find that things have changed a bit over the years in this area - i hope it continues as these flyins are very expensive already. phish
1438584,onetimedave,2012-05-21 19:14:00,502,We fly out of nakina and never have had to pay for overweight. We try xtra hard to keep within the allowance of 110# per person and this can be done. As said before have the outfitter bring in xtra weight on check flight.
1439704,Gulper,2012-05-23 19:42:00,6,"Flown with Leuenberger's many times before never had and issue with weight. We have been over a few pounds it hasn't been an issue, as long as you are reasonable. If you have any trouble fitting six guys and gear on the otter, then you have way too much gear. As has been said some stuff,beer, water etc, can go in midweek."
1439716,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-05-23 20:13:00,235,"Aw, screw it, just throw it all in there. Hopefully you'll clear the trees!"
