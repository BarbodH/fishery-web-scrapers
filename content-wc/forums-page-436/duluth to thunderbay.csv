1438158,Mr Ranger,2012-05-21 06:14:00,272,"Agreed to all. We have been staying at the DAYS INN AND SUITES - THUNDER BAY 645 Sibley Drive Harbour Expressway & Balmoral Thunder Bay, ON P7B 6Z8 CA Phone: 1-807-6223297 It has a huge well lit lot and nice resteraunt options right across the lot. There are two Days Inn in TB so make sure you get this one. Reservation is a must this time of year. Enjoy"
1438599,fishwteeth,2012-05-21 19:47:00,10,Thanks guys for all the replies. I have gotten a room reserved in Kakabecka Falls.
1438734,bcmss396,2012-05-22 06:47:00,296,"Here's a vote for the Norwester. Located just on the SW edge of Thunder Bay. Across the street is the Neebing Roadhouse. European style tavern and restaurant - Very good food.As mentioned previously, make a reservation!!!Blair"
1438739,steelroamer,2012-05-22 06:58:00,7,"I live in Thunder bay as well, and this is just a suggestion, you could stay at the casino in Grand portage and then cross the border at Pigeon river first thing in the morning when there is nobody there (really nobody!!) this way you can drop some money at the casino stay at a hotel in U.S. funds and fuel up at the gas station just before the border and pick up some Canadian beer at the duty free store and save a fortune. just a suggestionwww.grandportage.com/Ian"
1438901,stevensinks,2012-05-22 10:52:00,330,"Also if you like history there three great Northwest Fur Co, forts on the way."
1438974,Lovetofish,2012-05-22 12:46:00,458,How will the roads be between Duluth and Pigeon River this summer?
1437609,fishwteeth,2012-05-19 09:44:00,10,"Guys, going north of Ignace for a pike fishing trip in June. I have been thru Int. Falls and Fort Francis many times. Was told by the lodge owner to go thru Thunder Bay. He said trip would be 1-2 hrs shorter. Anyway, I have never taken this route before. How are the roads, can anyone recommend a place to stay over nite in Thunder Bay. Plan on hitting Thunder Bay around 8:00 on a Friday nite, stay over nite, have a few ""pops"", get some rest, then get to the lodge around noon . . . a 40"" pike an hour or so later!!"
1437612,camp chef,2012-05-19 09:56:00,915,It is a spectacular drive with great scenery. You will love it. There is a shortcut though before you get to Thunderbay. It saves quite a bit of time and you could spend the night in Kakabecka Falls instead.
1437617,dan cardinal,2012-05-19 10:16:00,64,"Can't help you on motels in Thunder Bay, however there are all kinds. We stayed in Grand Marais, but can not remember the name of motel...it was very nice...as most along this route appear to be very well managed.I can tell you the road (61) was great two years ago... and a beautiful, very scenic drive along the northshore. If at all possible I would time your drive so that this part of the trip is during the daylight hours. You will appreciate the view."
1437621,drlee,2012-05-19 10:30:00,409,"I travel this route several times each summer, since I fish the Ignace area. The road up the ""north shore"" from Duluth to the border is really lovely. You can get frustrated with the traffic and the small towns you pass through where the speed limit drops significantly. But, its three hours, give or take. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the drive! There are a lot of motels in Thunder Bay. The ""short cut"" around the city is very useful time-wise. If you use one of the many chain motels in TB the short cut won't do you any good. Kakabeka Falls has a couple of motels...warning: They are not the Holiday Inn Express and I would get a reservation ahead of time. One of the nicest things about this route is the border crossing itself. I have crossed at International Falls many times and have not always been treated very well...no, I have never had a DUI. The officers there just seem to be rude and confrontational. At Pigeon River, things are more relaxed, the lines are typically short or non-existent. Coming back, the officers on the American side are usually very polite and like to welcome you back to the US. Just before you get to the border you will see a large gas stop/casino/store on your right...Grand Portage, I think. Good place to fill up with gas, since its still a lot more expensive in CA. Catch some fish! Have a great time!"
1437628,Jarbear,2012-05-19 10:41:00,24,"The drive from Duluth to Thunder Bay is very nice and scenic. There are some neat small towns as well that you travel through. We travel this way every year on our way to Armstrong. We travel during the week so I think we see less traffic. There is some construction in certain areas, but have never been delayed too long. We have stayed several times at the Bestwestern-Norwester hotel which is south of Thunder Bay a few miles. They have a restaurant and bar area. If you are planning staying there on a friday night, I would check to see if they have a wedding planned. The last time we stayed there on a friday, there was a wedding and the place was rocking. Not much sleep that night. We now stay just south of the border when we travel. Gets us to Armstrong by noon the next day and we have the afternoon to fish. Works well for us. Good luck with your planning."
1437638,elway12,2012-05-19 12:17:00,335,"All the above responses are right on. For me it is just another wonderful thing about going fishing in Canada. Had a person in our camp stay in/at Grand Marais and said it was great but I do not know what the name of the hotel? As others have said you should make good time but the road has alot of tourists, small towns, low speed limits and sometimes there is construction. There is alot of deer in that area so be on the lookout. We also saw a moose just after the Pigeon River(in Canada) crossing last year."
1437714,Pooch,2012-05-19 18:18:00,4619,"Make that trip three times a year. Here are some hotels and my opinion of them:Thunder Bay: (both are close to airport and on Author Street and both are wife approved)Victoria Inn, nice and close to restaurants, Can get full fast with familiesBest Western, same as above, but a little less priceyKakabeka Falls: (near shortcut, not really wife approved)Telstar Motel, small mom and pop, right on highway, not the Ritz but quite doable except for the train tracks right behind the motel. We stay there every year on the boys trip. Cheap and clean. No restaurant open in town later evening if you arrive late.Ignace:Northwoods Inn, older, but nice place and clean. On highway, Good restaurant on first floor. Wife approved!Pooch"
1437785,waterwick,2012-05-20 00:12:00,32,"I live in Thunder Bay and can recommend the following. MAKE A RESERVATION!!If you are towing a boat the easiest solution would be to stay at the Best Western Norwester 2080 Hwy 61 Toll Free #1-800-528-1234 or 1-807-473-9123. Lots of parking. Pool. Decent retaurant and bar for the night. Gas station next door. An easy in and out. There is some re-surfacing of the hwy 61 going on right now but if you are arriving late and leaving early it should pose no delays, if any. The speed limit is just reduced a little.Next choices would be the Travellodge Airlane 698 W Arthur St 1-800-268-3330 or 1-807-473-1600 or the Valhalla Inn 1 Valhalla Inn Rd 1-807-577-1121 These two are on opposite sides of the corner of Hwy 61 and Arthur St. Both are nice, lots of parking, restaurant and bar. First light, maybe a mile, past the lights at the Airport Rd.The Victoria Inn 555 W Arthur St. 1-807-577-8481 about 300 yards past the Airlane on the left. Right turn off Hwy 61 Has a pool restaurant and bar. Lots of parking.If you are not towing a boat and dont want a restarant or bar at your lodging other options are the Best Western Crossroads or the Comfort Inn. Both are spitting distance from the Airlane. There is a Pizza Hut and Chinese Restarants within a minute or two walk. Safe area and well lit. Boston Pizza is about a mile further down Arthur St.Have a great trip!"
1437858,phishfearme,2012-05-20 08:14:00,1242,"the short cut people are talking about in taking rt 130 north off rt 61 - go to the T and make left - take a right on river road then another right at the stop sign and this goes up to 11/17. roads are all paved now and this cuts off TB totally. pooch is correct about the telstar in K-falls - we use it frequently - cheap and clean enough for flyin housekeeping guys. although we now try to get to ignace as the northwoods is nicer and has a walkin freezer for food storage. they also have one room that can hold 4 guys. if you want more comfort, you'll need to go into TB - a beautiful town with all you'll ever need. phish"
1437863,JackSalmon,2012-05-20 08:25:00,169,"If you like history, and you have the time, make a stop and tour the Split Rock Lighthouse - we stopped on our way up and we all enjoyed it."
