1439135,Rivratz,2012-05-22 18:03:00,105,I heard from Duane at P Cove that the opening for walleye was off to a pretty good start. He said the water temps were approaching 60 degrees. That means the walleye should already be on the move to their summer haunts. Any Minaki reports would be greatly appreciated!
