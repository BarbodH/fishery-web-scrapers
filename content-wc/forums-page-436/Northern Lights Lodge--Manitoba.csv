I can tell you that this area has some incredible fishing, and there are plenty of lakes to fish. I'm assuming that lake is a fly in. It is 1850 miles for me one way, quite a trek, but once i'm there i'm in heaven"

I would assume you to drive to Lynn Lake and fly out from there. i am sure the fishing is absolutely awesome."
