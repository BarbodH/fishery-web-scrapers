Not long after anchoring up on the I-pilot we started to get 12""ers out of 30 to 35'FOW. The action was steady with a steady increase in size upto some nice slot size fish.However the slot size fish were scarce and the over slot size fish non existant, so we moved on to another 30'+ FOW reef i know. Straight away normal service resumed...and at last my buddy got into a nice 26"" Lac Seul hog...followed by a 21""er shortly after.Even better was we both got into a whitefish....they fight awesome on open water too.I counted 43 seperate clips of fish caught for the video and i say i probably did not film about 20 to 30 fish caught. So....all in all a good numbers day but the big ones eluded us. One of the 21"" males we got in 35'FOW had the ole sperm flow goin still.....but that was the only sign of spawn activity we saw. I'd say they are done...surface temps between 54F(main lake) and 62F(sheltered bays).We got an excellent limit in the cooler of 17"" walleye....man are they chunky munkys...really solid fish.When we got back to the landing the boys camping there wasted no time telling us they had landed a 28""er right from shore in about 5'FOW....guess they are shallow too and we were just not in the right shallow areas!Water level is way down on at Williams Bay....stumps i know showing an extra 4-5' above water line.Near the end of the day the wind picked up and the fish all but disappeared/stopped biting on the deep reef...we moved back to the other deep mark where it was shallow and got our last 2 fish for the cooler before heading home. We had crawlers with us but never tried 'em in the end...we experimented with various plastics but live minnows seemed king today.Fish were not responding to anything but the most verticle presentation we could give.....and very few responding to agressive jigging, although some definitely were responding to a more vigirously presented jig and minnow.Given that it was so calm most of the day it was also possible to 'X-Box' fish...that is to say watch your jig and minnow on the fish finder and see the fish come in to get it. I also managed to catch 5 suspended fish this way. I was jigging on the bottom and saw the fish half way up the water column...reeled up to meet it and WHAM! Got a pike, 3 walleye and my whitefish that way....just like icefishing lakers!VIDEOhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He2-wpfHUf0"

I bought one for our trip this year. Seems like a great way to take pics, shoot video AND never worry about it getting wet."
