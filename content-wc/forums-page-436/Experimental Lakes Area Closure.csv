1438218,nubote,2012-05-21 07:48:00,35,"It was announced today that the Government of Canada will be closing the world-renowned Experimental Lakes Area (ELA) after 44 years of research. The ELA is a unique facility for aquatic research  there is no other comparable facility in the world (see www.experimentallakesarea.ca for more information). The ELA, located in northwestern Ontario, consists of 58 small lakes and their watershed that have been set aside for research.I am sending this e-mail in the hope that you will contact the Minister of Fisheries & Oceans Canada ([email protected]), the Prime Minister, Stephen Harper ([email protected]), or your local MP to challenge this decision. Even better than writing an e-mail, please call your MP or (best yet) ask for a meeting. The government pays attention to the amount of effort required to voice your concerns! If you live in the United States, I urge you to also write to the Canadian Ambassador, Gary Doer (501 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, D.C. 20001 Tel.: 202-682-1740  Fax: 202-682-7726). Please let other potentially interested parties know about this.Why is the ELA a vital resource for Canadians? The tremendous value of this facility lies in the ability of scientists to conduct whole-ecosystem manipulation experiments. These studies have provided sound scientific knowledge for the development of environmental policies both nationally and internationally. The key areas of influence have been in understanding and managing algal blooms, acid rain, climate change, aquaculture, mercury pollution, greenhouse gas production, hydroelectric reservoir development, and endocrine-disrupting chemicals.Research at the ELA has demonstrated that smaller scale experiments cannot provide reliable information for managing whole lakes. Thus by shutting down this facility, scientists in government, industry, and academia will be unable to conduct the research required to formulate sound environmental policies.The scientific output of Canada's ELA has been impressive to say the least  it has produced 745 peer-reviewed scientific articles, 126 graduate theses, 102 book chapters and synthesis papers, 185 data reports, and several books. ELA scientists have been the recipients of numerous prestigious international water awards, including the Stockholm Water Prize, the International Tyler Prize for Environmental Science and the Gerhard Herzberg Gold Medal for Science and Engineering. The ELA has also received outstanding reviews by Canada's Auditor General's office, and the Government has invested approximately $4 million in new infrastructure over the last 10 years."
