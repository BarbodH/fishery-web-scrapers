1438045,Jahloaf,2012-05-20 18:41:00,74,"I'm looking for a perch bait that has been successful.Since the limit of 50 perch is quite liberal I wanna try and catch a few for eating, so can you tell me what works best for you?I was thinking a slip bobber with a 1/16 oz jig tipped with a 1/2 crawler would work pretty good, whats tried and tru for you?"
1438055,JayM5209,2012-05-20 18:58:00,1050,"You've got it! Smallest possible jig. White or yellow works best for me. Something with a little bit of mylar/tinsel often helps. If you use half a crawler they'll often drive you nuts as they nibble the end off. A 1"" piece can be enough. Some days it's more effective to have the jig moving - toss it out and work it slowly back to the boat. For this I often use a yellow or chartreuse RoadRunner jig.Fun to catch and good eatin'. My group often freezes fillets from 25 or 30 per person to bring home."
1438065,packpro,2012-05-20 19:22:00,695,"We have had good luck on weed lines and in the pockets of weeds. Very small jigs, ask for small minnows at the camp. When you find them they are usually schooled up. If it shuts down quickly........chances are a large predator moved in the area."
1438084,v-bay gord,2012-05-20 20:05:00,3168,"A guest of mine who I refer to as the ""perchmaster"" swears by ""Chena Bait"" for perch. Google it to see what it is........"
1438129,Shellback,2012-05-21 04:05:00,8083,I use a little spinner for flash with a 1/16 jig and just a small piece of nightcrawler.
1438137,Bill Krejca,2012-05-21 05:15:00,6107,"A small jig with a yellow or white or yellow/white tube works pretty well many times. Glue the tube on the jig, or it will get pulled/chewed off. Bill"
1438294,Lake Wisconsin,2012-05-21 09:52:00,1960,Flippin 1/16 oz or 1/32 oz jig in the shallows with 1/3 or 1/4 crawler.
1438547,Paul H,2012-05-21 18:05:00,1232,"I used to take some wax worms just to fish for perch and used on tiny 1/64 oz jig heads. Also used power grubs (panfish size) or small minnows. If you can get small craws the big perch go crazy. Lake we stayed at had some real jumbos, best we ever had was a 18"" from the campsite bank, hit a Mepps and suprised us. Beaver hutches and weed beds are good most of the time, if you are there during the spawn ""which is about the time of the Walleye opener for ON) any thing will work, including a bare gold hook. Most of our keepers were perch and a few walleye, C&R on most walleye."
1438778,adempsey,2012-05-22 07:59:00,963,"Can't beat worms, but if you get tired of baiting the hook like I do, I suggest some micro-tubes on a micro-tube jig head. They work great.I also like the various Gulp Alive products, like the 1"" Fry.Pink and white are my preferred colors.This kit is one sale at a good price."
