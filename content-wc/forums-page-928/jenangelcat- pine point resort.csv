It was very hot when we went so the fishing was a bit slow. At the time we were told to fish the Five Sisters Islands. Everyone else that was there caught lots of large walleye. I recenlty bought a fishfinder so it should be easier to find good spots. It's a rather large lake with tons of islands and it is very easy to get lost. So make sure you have a compass or GPS. If you check back on this board there is a question about the lac with quite a few replies. The road up to Thunderbird is pretty good, we drove on it with a new car and no trouble. Next week is prime fishing according to the moon phases. And the cooler weather, and rain should help as well. I've been counting down the days to this trip, it's going to be awesome!"
