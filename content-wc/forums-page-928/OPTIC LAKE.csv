I can tell you the walleyes on my trips (June and Aug) were always shallower than you'd expect especially for Aug. I found good size and quantity in 7-15 feet. Best in the late evening (7-10). Best bet was Orange on Orange jigs and White on Pink and Chart on Chart with minnows.Nothing real earth-shattering. Lots of fish in the 18-24 range(easily 50 per day). I really think a lake like this it is just a matter of proper presentation and a bit of looking for Rock reefs.Bob"
