The fishing is great on this lake, but no one uses or maintains this road except me and my buddies. We have two questions. 1) What is the best equipment to use to keep an old road open? and 2) Is there anything illegal about clearing brush on abandoned logging roads on Crown Land? We are from Michigan, so the equipment has to be portable (back of a pickup). We've tried chainsaws and hand clippers, and the such, but just can't keep up with the growth on this long of stretch of road. Any pointers would be appreciated.ps, trees are mostly small aspen and spruce."

The lumber companys have large areas assigned to them, but don't expect any releif there unless they decide to use the road themselves. There is some liablity for them if a culvert or bridge is left in, so they often pull them out if they don't intend to use it any time soon. In the case of an extreme emergency the ministry will sometimes fix a road. They can't leave a party isolated on the far side of a washout for instance. In the area I frequent two tourist camps hire a maintainer to grade the road semi-anually. I've found that a few $$$ to assist with that effert has got me alot of goodwill and new spots to fish. As far as brushing out your 1/2 mile road I see only two options, sweat, or $$$ to hire a dozer. Fair warning if you make it easy to get in, suddenly every local for miles around will use the road to fish ""your"" lake. You'd be better off to leave the first 50 yards look like a goat path."

As i really don't think you're allowed, especially to gain acess to a lake. I have alease on apiece of crown land and my lease papers state that i am suppost to get a permit before i can cut firewood or even cut any bushes on this property, i think i would just 4 wheel it in to you're good fishing and not open it up to everyone to spoil for you."

Most roads on the otherhand show up on the ministry's maps. Maintianing the road is commonly done by the people who use them as the ministry has little funds for that use. I belong to an organized road asn. that maintains the roads into my cottage. We all pay about $50 a year dues and some of the members oversee the maintance. Trees, gravel, grading,mowing,ect. When the occasion arises we all pitch in. The ministry matches about 50 cents on our dollar up to a limit, because this is considered an ""all weather"" road. Basicly a school bus uses it too.I have never heard of anyone being chastised for improving a bush road. I have heard of the ministry imposing conditions to protect the watershed when culverts and washouts were installed. The ministry phone number for the Kenora distict is 807-468-2501 they can pass you to the right person from there."
