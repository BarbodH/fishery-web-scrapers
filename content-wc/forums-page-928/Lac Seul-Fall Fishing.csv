Then, our tactics are strictly jig and minnow in 7-15' water. What can we expect for this time of year? We really enjoy jig fishing, so hopefully that will still work. Also, I imagine the weather can be quite cool (cold) then?"

Best presentation was a lite bite bottom bouncer and a 5' or so leader to a minnow. We did way better with this than jigs - 50-75 fish/day easy. Personally, I'd bring some Little Cleo's and Mann's -1's and hammer the pike for some extra fun."
