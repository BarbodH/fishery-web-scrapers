523577,Ryan,2002-08-13 18:12:00,135,"I have fished Lac Seul many times during August. I'll give you a summary of what usually works for us. We usually catch between 50 and 100+ per day, so hopefully this advice will be pretty good.Baits: Spinner rigs are the way to go and are our primary presentation. Use 2 or 3 oz bottom bouncers, with 2 hook snells, or even 3 hook snells if you can find them. Use #3 and #5 silver and gold colorado blades, but bring an assortment of smaller blades. I suggest you buy a flat of 500 night crawlers in the US and bring them with for bait. If you decide to use the spinner rigs, make sure you frequently vary your speed. Sometimes they like it fast moving, and sometimes they like it really slow.Jigs-your typical canadian jigs. Bright colors seem to work well as the water is very stained. A minnow will outperform a nightcrawler on the jig. Spots: Lac Seul is actually an old river system. If you look at the maps you can almost tell where the old river channel probably went. The fish will relate to this old channel. Start in 18 ft of water and work your way out to 30 feet. Use your fish locator, and when you get good marks in that depth range, throw out a marker bouy, go another couple hundred yards, and throw out another if you want and make a pass with spinner rigs between the buoys. If you don't catch anything in 2 passes or so, good chance you need to move on. Sometimes the marks will be beautiful but they just won't bite (or they aren't walleye) Islands and humps are your primary hot spots, but any place with the right depth is a potential spot. That's about all I have time to write at the moment. Good luck!"

Just got back from the area 20 weeks ago and the 3 of us caught 940 walleyes in 6 1/2 days of fishing. With out doubt the best fishing we have had in the entire time up there. If you want to discuss more just email me and I will give you my phone number. Good luck"
