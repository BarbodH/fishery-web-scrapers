523559,Rat,2002-08-21 07:03:00,102,We have been going into Canada for years and have never been asked. Try the 1-800-ONTARIO number but I don't think it's a problem.One suggestion for a fly in. We always bring a package of lentils. One package goes a long way. They taste pretty good are very nutricious and filling. We keep them just in case the airplane can't get back in. There have been times when flying was impossible for several days when a large front was moving through.
