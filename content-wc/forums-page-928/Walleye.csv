523552,Ron,2002-08-16 14:11:00,387,"Wanting to book a walleye fishing trip in Ontario or Quebec for the 1st week of June 2003. Does anyone know of a lake and outfitter that can provide the following for that time of year. Fast, furious walleye fishing with larger walleyes common. Other fish species in the lake or surronding lakes a plus, but not necessary. We need a cabin and would like to be as remote as possible. We want to eat fish and bring out our limit. Only want to keep a big fish if it goes on the wall and not everyone in the group wants to do that. Any help anyone could give me would be appreciated.Thanks Ron"

Good Northern and Muskie. June is an excellent time to be there. I alway go the second week after opener. Anderson's has a website. If you put in Ontario:Anderson's Lodge I believe you will get it. However, Anderson's is only one of many in Ontario.eyesnatcher"
