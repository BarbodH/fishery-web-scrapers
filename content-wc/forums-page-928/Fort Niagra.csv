523465,Guest,2002-08-14 16:24:00,0,Thnaks for the website info - I'll check it Friday night before I leave. I plan on fishing for Walleye and maybe King Salmon if any are around. I have the abilty to troll or use planer boards. I also have downriggers. So I am pretty adaptable. Any suggestions will be apprecaited.BZ

We get them up to 15 pounds and by September they average about 8 pounds. There's an article on the web site mentioned above that I wrote for Rick along time ago ( the writing is terrible, but it gets the point across.) And on his 'Braggers Board' is some walleye pics. Don't forget to look at the 'Musky pics' on the Niagara site for pics of a few 50 pound musky caught in the Niagara River. Email me if your gonna be on the Canuck side and mebbe we can head out!"
523467,Guest,2002-08-15 16:33:00,0,Thanks for the info - I will be staying in Lewiston right on the lower Niagra. Do these walleye move out into the lake every night and back in in the morning? Do peoplr troll late & early for them or reverse troll up stream bouncing harnesses off of bottom? Sounds like you know the ropes - I have a few guests allready this weekend but maybe we can get out in the near future. Any more info you can send me would be appreciated.
523468,Guest,2002-08-15 16:51:00,0,Tried to find the article you wrote - but had no success. What is the title?
523469,bigfish1965,2002-08-15 19:11:00,3210,"The title of the article is -Port Dalhousie Walleye Tactics...By Rick O'Banion.. I rarely fish the river proper for walleye, but I do know that they are found primarily around Queenston in the backwater at the sand docks. Most guys use an assortment of suspending stick baits."
