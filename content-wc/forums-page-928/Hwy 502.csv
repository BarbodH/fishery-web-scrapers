523407,Guest,2002-08-11 17:19:00,0,"For such a busy and important route, with logging trucks, tourists, fuel trucks etc. it is one of the worst major links of road in Ontario, of course the June floods did alot of damage, but man I wish there was a better way to get from Fort Francis to Dryden."
523408,Guest,2002-08-11 18:34:00,0,AMEN!
523409,Trailerguy,2002-08-12 06:57:00,1407,"Just wait until it is finished, the OPP will be hiding in the bush to make sure they pay for the roadwork. It's a posted at 80 clicks just like hwy 105 and they've been thick on it."
523410,Goldfish,2002-08-14 02:16:00,6,Is 71 a better choice?I'll be heading up to Red Lakethe end of next week.
523412,Babamel,2002-08-14 04:10:00,0,Has anyone traveled the 502 recentlly? Is there any construction on the weekends?
523413,Fred_G,2002-08-14 04:41:00,908,"Just came down 502 last Saturday. They have been working on Saturday in some areas. We didn't encounter any work being done this trip, however they have two stretches ready to pave so they may be working Saturdays just to get it done.Fred"
523411,Guest,2002-08-14 05:53:00,0,"I quit taking 502 tthree years ago. I too go to the Red Lake area. Hwy. 71 is great. It is about 36 miles further than 502, but you make the same time. Vermillion Bay is a nice place to stay. 71 is a great road, not as much scenery, but I had taken 502 for many years anyway."
523415,Guest,2002-08-14 18:36:00,0,Hvae made this trip for years. The best way to do it is to cross customs at day break and make the journey up 502 in the early morning. No body is on the road and it is light so it is easy to drive. The real problems start occuring when there is a lot of traffic on it
523414,Karl,2002-08-15 11:43:00,63,"Yes, they do work on Saturdays. Came back last Saturday, there was a ten mile stretch of gravel that wasn't fun and two waits (flagman) where it was down to one lane. Overall, not as bad as I expected."
