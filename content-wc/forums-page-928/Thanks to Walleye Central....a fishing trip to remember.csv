523605,PETENY,2002-08-14 16:49:00,2,"BAXTER- glad to hear you and your family had a great fishing trip. Those kinds of trips will always be remembered far from now when the kids all grow up and say--"" Dad, remember the time we went to Big Gull Lake and caught all those fish?"" Kids grow up too fast nowadays so enjoy the time. I have heard about the color Purple Haze but cannot find it anywheres. I looked on the Reef Runner website and see no such color. Is that the color the lures are called? I have a few of the Gold Clown and they have worked well at times but the purple is a hot color around here but no-can-find! Where did you buy them? Thanks Pete"

I no longer have the box or the order slip that came with the lure, hope this helps!"

After your last message I looked again at the www.reefrunner.com website and it looks like the colors you described are 1 of their custom colors. Called Metallic Pink Trailer Trash.If you get a chance, check out their website under the custom and standard colors,the color chart is pretty clear and let us know if thats the one. Thanks again, by the way, where did you send for these lures?"

I feel pretty foolish for citing the wrong color/pattern name for the lure and do apologize once again. After looking over the website selections, the pattern is #36, Rainbow Trout. Happy trolling!"

523599,Guest,2002-08-14 05:23:00,0,"Just got back from Big Gull Lake in Ontario, a family trip. My daughter (15) and my twin boys (12) and I just slayed the Walleye thanks to some info I picked up here on this site. You cannot imagine how thrilled my kids were to be the talk of the camp, I'm a proud Dad! I had read in many different threads here about a ""go to"" crankbait that I had never heard of before, so I ordered 3 of them for the trip.....man did they ever produce. Little Rippers by Reef Runner.....the ""Purple Haze"" and ""Gold Clown"" patterns worked a little better than the ""Chartruse and White"" pattern...but really, I think any pattern would have produced. Flat line trolling over 60 feet of water just before and after dark, it was awesome, and built a memory for the ages for my crew. This is such a great site, I lurk often and post seldom...just had to say THANKS!!!"

523600,Guest,2002-08-14 08:46:00,0,"Big Gull Lake came thru with those Little Rippers! Count of approx. 52 fish in the fry pan, had 2 great fish fries for about 20 people and lots of fun. Best fishing in a decade or more. The look on my nephews and nieces faces priceless; as were those on my Brother and the husband/guide - Walleye Sister"
