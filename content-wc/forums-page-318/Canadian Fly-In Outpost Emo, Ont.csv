2975681,ablack86,2014-07-08 10:52:00,17,"I flew out from these guys July 2013. I fished KaopskikamakLake AKA Krooked Lake.We had 8 guys, cabin sleeps 10 and is just huge / awesome. Indoor plumbing at an outpost is also really great. They also have a Pontoon Boat on this lake which is great for relaxing. Be careful though, we did have Ontario Wildlife guys land on our lake and check us for beer in boats and licenses. Luckily, they flew in during lunch and we weren't on the lake.As for the fishing....... The amount of Small Mouth Bass we caught here was extraordinary. All were big 3lbish fish or more, biggest close to 5#... Was an absolute blast.Walleye fishing stunk. We caught ~10-15 on the whole trip which was disappointing. We did however pull a 27 inch Wally out which shows promise.Pike fishing was good. 3 fish over 30 inch, biggest was 35ish. Brother in-law caught a 42 inch muskie trolling for Pike as well. Lake apparently does not have a muskie population which made the catch that much better.Lake Trout fishing was good for early July. Apparently this lake is a world class Lake Trout lake early in the year. We trolled the main lake with cranks that dove 15-20 feet and caught a fair number of Lakers. No big from our group, but they are there....I have done 5 outpost fly-ins now, and this was absolutely one of the best trips we have had. The facilities are awesome, and the fishing is great if you like to catch Smallies."
