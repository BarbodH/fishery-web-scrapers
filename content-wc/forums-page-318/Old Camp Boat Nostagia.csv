Earlier this summer when I spied an old 14' Lund with a For Sale sign on it, I had to stop and take a look. After I walked around her, gently patted her bow, and conversed with her for awhile, darned if she didn't follow me home for some TLC.When I started to clean her up, I found that at least three previous owners had doused her with spray can paint. A true restoration would mean stripping the exterior down to bare aluminum and applying Lund red paint above the spray rail and leaving the bottom bare aluminum. Since I wasn't ready to invest the time and energy required to do that, I cleaned her up, sanded off the worst of the old spray can runs, and applied three coats of gray oil based enamel to the bottom of the hull. The flat green on the top of the hull isn't too bad so I left it. The interior had never been painted, so enough of the original paint remained to see the Lund pale green/grey fleck interior paint. After a good cleaning, including removing all the various kinds of caulk prior owners had applied to leaky rivets, I painted all the rivets and seams with Gluvit epoxy marine sealant. Then the interior got three coats of enamel, plus two more coats on the floor with a non-slip grit added to the paint. The new seat tops got five coats of exterior polyurethane. New decals at the stern on both sides finished the project.By looking at the old Lund catalogs archived on the company web site I was able to determine that she's a Lund Model C-14. Also, because she has the old style aluminum tube braces from the seats to the gunwale, I knew she was pre-1965, the year Lund switched to the flat extruded aluminum braces. The two metal ID plates are still on the transom and readable. Being pre-HIN days, she carries a Serial Number - 4260. In communicating with the good customer service folks at Lund, I was told that records from the early years are sketchy and incomplete, but the boat was manufactured sometime between 1948 and the mid-50s. Dang, she's almost as old as I am . . . . somewhere between 60 and 70 years of age!I thought some of the WC old timers who've had similar camp boat experiences might enjoy the story. I don't know her future, but with limited storage space and two other Lunds in the stable, and despite the strong nostalgic attachment, she'll probably go on the market for someone else to enjoy. I wish she could talk! I bet she has a ton of stories to tell! Maybe I'm nuts, but she's a noble and majestic old lady!"

I have similar nostalgic feelings towards the old 16 foot Alumacraft boats we used ""back in the day"". Not sure about the model but it was basically an oversized canoe....I remember it had a rounded stern. Wish I still had one. Nice job on the Lund. Hopefully you get to catch a fish out of it before selling. Thanks for the reminder that the basic boat still has a place in today's fishing."
2964154,lassh,2014-07-04 07:23:00,553,Great job! Those old boats bring back great memories from my early days in Canada. Spent a lot of time back trolling in those boats. They pretty much became an extension of your left arm. Coupled with a 6 HP Sea Horse or a 10 HP Johnson and a couple marker buoys they were great fishing machines.

2964610,polaris-pete,2014-07-04 09:47:00,343,"Great job on the redo! If you weren't so far I may have thoughts on it.Back in the early 60's when we first started doing the Canadian thing, all they used were the Cedarstrip boats and these were real seaworthy but heavier than heck. I see there are a few Lodges that still use them. Lot more work to restore one of these though. Good Luck and thanks for sharing this with us."
2965265,fishron,2014-07-04 15:59:00,317,"Good job on the boat. I just sold a 12ft 1964 Grumman (redwood seats) that had a lot of memories attached to it. My first trip to Canada in 1962, we fished in cedarstrip boats with ten horse motors. Great feel in the water and a quiet boat to fish in."
