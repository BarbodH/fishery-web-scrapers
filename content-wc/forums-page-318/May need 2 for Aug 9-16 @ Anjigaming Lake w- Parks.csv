2967305,forgop,2014-07-05 18:03:00,880,"So, my cousin and I were going to take a couple of older guys with us this year and things were good to go. One isn't doing so hot health wise last week and is waffling on going and if he waffles, the other said he won't be a 3rd wheel and leave it to just my cousin and I. Thus, we're looking for 2 just in case.Cost is $795 CDN plus tax, which I believe will run around $830ish for the trip with food, gas, license, hotel, etc. on top of that. We're leaving Indy on Aug 8th around lunch time and staying the night in Wawa before flying out the next morning. Anyone game? http://www.canadafishingguide.net/th...g-lake-fly-in/"
2969617,polaris-pete,2014-07-06 16:11:00,343,We were there First week in June. Had a great time. Cabin is really nice. The fishing was pretty good considering the late ice-out and the storms and rain we had all week but its a beautiful lake.The Wi-Fi is the coolest thing and the solar lighting is the nuts.Any questions let me know.
2969809,forgop,2014-07-06 17:28:00,880,Thanks for the update. Will definitely take 2 if we can get a good match. Should be a great trip.
