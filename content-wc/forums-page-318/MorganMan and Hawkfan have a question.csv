2963074,3M TA3,2014-07-03 17:17:00,2846,Guess I need to do more ice fishing.
2963202,SinOrSwim,2014-07-03 18:19:00,1528,"Oh hey, hey, hey! Bums to the wall!!!! LOL"
2963786,Nimstug,2014-07-03 22:38:00,2605,"No preference was noted for male or female. Did I misunderstand something? If so, mea culpa."
2959234,JAY221,2014-07-02 11:14:00,877,"So if I am reading this right he knows he can't get a stripper to go with him so he leaves it up to the brother.... Is that right??? Later, Jay"
2959346,patricktjms,2014-07-02 11:39:00,67,"So, I have had about an hour to reflect on this thread, and I find myself thinking...A good cook and fish cleaner can strip, but a stripper might not be able to clean fish and cook. The reality of it is that if I wanted to spend my hard earned money on a woman that looked good, but couldnt clean fish and wasnt going to sleep with me, I would go back to high school."
2960074,Pikeslayer8,2014-07-02 16:24:00,1460,"I find many responses on this thread completely disrespectful to the heartfelt pleas coming from Morganman and Hawkfan. Lucky for them they have such a brother that looks out for their well being and mental constitution. Thank you Sin for your dedication and hard work to make their trip memorable. Now I've pondered this quandary long and hard and have consulted the utmost authorities. Lucky for you guys I've been able to make contact with Leon Phelps, ""The Ladies Man"". Leon is a regular in my group and even hosts a Wabakimi ""call in show"" on occasion. Upon hearing this dilemma Leon replied ""Yeah, well, you guys suffer from homo-unerectus. That means your wang is hugeified not by women but by a walleye."" Leon goes further saying ""What is love? What is this longing in our hearts for togetherness? Is it not the sweetest flower? Does not this flower of love have the fragrant aroma of fine, fine chowder? Does not the wind love the dirt? Is not love not unlike the unlikely not it is unlikened to? Are you with someone tonight? Do not question your love. Take your lover by the hand. Release the power within yourself. Your heard me, release the power. Tame the wild cosmos with a whisper. Conquer heaven with one intimate caress. That's right don't be shy. Whip out everything you got and do it in the ""."

2960402,patricktjms,2014-07-02 18:03:00,67,You lost me at homo-unerectus.
2960426,Pikeslayer8,2014-07-02 18:21:00,1460,"Hey, don't shoot the messenger. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io3R6xx_l5Q"
2962138,tv4fish,2014-07-03 09:21:00,2694,What did you just say ?
2962186,Larbo,2014-07-03 09:32:00,231,I think Pikeslayer8 needs to change his WC handle to FloweringLovePike2.
2962786,Pikeslayer8,2014-07-03 14:29:00,1460,"Peace, Love and Bug Dope!"
2962922,Nimstug,2014-07-03 15:32:00,2605,Have you checked with Chippendales or Thunder From Down Under?
2958354,SinOrSwim,2014-07-02 07:44:00,1528,"So, we are stuck on 9 guys and MorganMan and Hawkfan decided this morning to make the group an even 10, they would like to take a stripper? Anybody ever done this? Seems like a bad idea and a very expensive idea but they are dead set on it. So, where to find a stripper that likes to fish?"
2958362,Fishoil,2014-07-02 07:47:00,1277,
2958458,Blackmacs,2014-07-02 08:09:00,2121,"Make sure she has her passport, work permit, and all her shots."
2958506,tv4fish,2014-07-02 08:22:00,2694,WELLLLL - You USED to be able to find that species in Dryden..............
2958698,MorganMan,2014-07-02 09:02:00,341,Anyone have any leads on a job so SinOrSwim can get a life??
2958770,HeHooksHimself,2014-07-02 09:16:00,725,Make sure you get a stripper that can clean fish and cook....otherwise what good would she be?
2958802,SinOrSwim,2014-07-02 09:23:00,1528,"[QUOTE=HeHooksHimself;2958770]Make sure you get a stripper that can clean fish and cook....otherwise what good would she be?[/QUOTE]Well I can think of a ""couple things"". LOL"
2958946,patricktjms,2014-07-02 09:54:00,67,"There are sooooo many opportunities here for jokes that are totally inappropriate. Strippers, fish, money, vaccines, Actually....now that I see it in print, its sounding like a better idea."
2959058,ftfarms,2014-07-02 10:28:00,444,My only thought is can I go with. (Gosh I hope my wife don't read walleye central)
2959122,Hawkfan,2014-07-02 10:44:00,237,"It's actually a perfect place for a ""your mom"" joke, but he's my brother. Touché Sin...Touché He is just giddy because he is going on two trips this year and his first is in a month. A month sooner than our annual trip."
