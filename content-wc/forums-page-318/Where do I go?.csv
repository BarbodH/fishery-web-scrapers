2965937,Red Beard,2014-07-04 22:14:00,10,"Live to jig... Did you ever stay at the Dunn's island outpost? If so, what did you think?"
2965961,Live to jig,2014-07-04 22:44:00,159,"I have not stayed there myself, however my brother in law stayed there with his boys one year and I spend a couple of nights there. This year they stayed in the main camp, when I asked them which they preferred, and they said it was a toss up. It is absolutely beautiful country and the camp is well set up. It also doesn't hurt that the best fishing in the lake is within a couple hundred yards of the island. Have you been to OS?"
2966025,John N,2014-07-05 05:04:00,362,"Consider The Old Post Lodge - been going their 18 years now, couldn't be more pleased. Very well run camp, fishing always superb. http://www.oldpost.com/ John"

2972721,derek204,2014-07-07 15:07:00,56,"http://www.kingfisherlodge.com/ Definitely worth a look at. Safe lake with many species, great camp only a 100yd off the highway so easy access. Lester the gentleman who runs the docks there will clean your fish when you come in off the water, huge bonus IMO. Cabins are complete and clean and the owners are awesome, check them out the prices are good and I have never been disappointed."

2946553,Red Beard,2014-06-28 19:19:00,10,I'm looking to take a couple of a anglers to north west Ontario. I'm looking for a drive in lake lodge or outpost. I'd like it to be on the cheaper side with boats and gas included in the price. I'd like to make it a good first Canada fishing experience for them. Any thoughts?
2946681,ftfarms,2014-06-28 20:04:00,444,I own my own boat so it's even cheaper but one of my favorite places for the money is cedar point resort on cedar lake south of Perrualtfalls Walleye and smallmouth fishing is really really good
2946689,JAY221,2014-06-28 20:08:00,877,"http://www.ontariossunsetcountry.ca/Go to this website & try to narrow it down. There are so many places that are good that you could/will get hundreds of different answers to your question & they are all right. Later, Jay"
2946785,Nimstug,2014-06-28 20:38:00,2605,"Besides echoing Jay's comment, depending on where you are located you may need to do a ""time budget."" How far can you travel / do you want to travel in the time you have off. That might help to narrow down some choices. Remember the miles are longer on the way back. I would not rule out boat-in lodges / camps. NimstugWhen I grow up, I want to be a little boy."

I just got back from by 25th visit to this camp. Their website will tell you all you need to know or e-mail Dave Peffley at camp for more info."
