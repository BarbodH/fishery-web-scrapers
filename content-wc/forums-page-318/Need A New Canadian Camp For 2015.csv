2967081,alberta bum,2014-07-05 15:52:00,312,Just got back from lake mattagami south of timmins.. Very disappointing trip. Either Quebec or western ontario next year... Would prefer Quebec much shorter drive.
2972689,derek204,2014-07-07 15:03:00,56,"x2 I stay at Kingfisher a few times a year and I just love that lake! Great place to stay, having Lester the dock hand clean your fish when you get off the water is a real treat and accommodations are great! Safe lake with little in the way of obstacles. I will be up there in a few weeks see how the fishing is now. It was Awesome in the spring here's a link to their Lodgehttp://www.kingfisherlodge.com/"
2960498,Sportdog,2014-07-02 18:39:00,6735,"Just returned from Canada and was very disappointed in the fishing. I went to this place last year and did much better but not as good as 2011 at a different place. The last 2 years were a drive to river location and the first year was a lake location that they packed you in and had to use camp boats which I don't like. Soooooo, I'm looking for a drive to location on a lake. My river fishing lack of location and technique skills were quite evident this year. High water presented some difficulty finding and catching walleyes, not to mention anchoring nightmares. I would prefer not to go to a mammoth body of water. Is that place out there??? Thanks for any help. (Note: Something north of Michigan from say, Marathon east to the Sudbury area would be real nice.)"

2963306,stillangling,2014-07-03 19:00:00,149,"Go west man. The good fishing starts around Nakina/Hornpayne and says that way right to the Manitoba Border. The area you are limiting yourself to will be full of disappointments. Spend the time to drive across the UP, cross at Pigeon River or better yet, International Falls. Then get yourself at least two hours north of the border. Read the fishing reports on this site that you get excited about. Nobody talks about 100 walleye days when they are fishing anywhere near Sudbury!"

2964386,NARDA 1,2014-07-04 08:40:00,636,"Check out www.birchdalelodge.com while it is on a large body of water (Eagle Lake) to me it's more like a bunch of smaller lakes connected together, especially on the north end. This will be my 26th year there. Only 46 days to go!!! I hope you find your go to place."
2964818,trapper_john,2014-07-04 11:02:00,83,We have been going to lake Wabaskang for many years. It's north of Vermilion Bay. The camp is Kingfisher lodge. The fishing has always been good to us. The camp is spotless and the owners are great people. I'm sure that you wouldn't be disappointed. One of the up sides of Wabbie is that it has jumbo Perch. Check it out.
2964874,Yaba,2014-07-04 11:34:00,88,"You are deffinetly limiting yourself by staying in that area, howver there used to be a couple decent camps around Gogama and Kirkland Lake! There just isnt really that much water in that part of Ontario."
2966209,Red Beard,2014-07-05 07:38:00,10,"http://pickerelcreekcamp.com. The Ogani outpost is great! There are falls all around. It's cheap and the owners were really good to us. We fished for big ones all day and then caught our dinner at the dock in the evening. Went in June and caught a few 38"" pike and one 40incher. I also caught a 28"" and a 29"" walleye in the same spot in about 30 minuets."
