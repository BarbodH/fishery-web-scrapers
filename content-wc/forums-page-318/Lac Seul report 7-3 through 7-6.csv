I learned my lesson last year speeding on that rd so I took it easy. From Dryden to Hudson, we saw 10 moose. One I came around a corner and a big cow was in the middle of the road. Rock on both sides of the road so she trotted down the middle for awhile till she got a spot to get in the woods. The others were all along the side of the road. Alot of 2 bull pairs. and one cow with a calf which was kind of cool to see. Also saw 2 bobcats right on the road up close. 13 moose total seen. Two bulls side by side yesterday afternoon and 1 cow on our way to get bait one day in town.Thursday's fishing we got on fish right way on a sand area jigging with a minnow. Seemed to be alot of sauger in that area so we went over to a rocky area in about 12 ft. Started getting into the bigger fishing and perfect eaters. Got our limit of 17.5 inch fish in about an hour and continued to catch fish all day.Friday, we hit the same spot and hammered the walleyes as well.Saturday we hit some spots closer to the landing on the east side of big pine island but it was slow. Scattered storms, so we went back to the sand and got into the walleyes again and had a blast. Missed 2 big storms so we stayed out.Sunday we decided to go to Big Vermiilion and go after some smallmouth. Started off slow as some info we on them must have been incorrect from the source so I put my own plan of what I thought would work from my days on Mille Lacs and then we started getting into smallmouth. Couple of small split shots on a plain hook with a plastic worm tossed up in sand under trees was the ticket. One tree I think we pulled 6-10 fish out of it. Catch one and 3 other fish would be following that fish up to the boat. Got out limit of Smallies and hit the big lake for lakers and managed one nice one in about 5 minutes of trolling then got pushed off the lake because of storms.All in all another awesome trip with great fishing."
