2972129,wallydave,2014-07-07 12:56:00,2151,In just over 3 weeks I'll toast you properly in Ontario eh!
2972225,tooski,2014-07-07 13:11:00,393,"That would be great Dave. Actually I think anyone with the inclination to hoist one to the vets and post the photo would be appreciated by Ronnie and Wayne (the two vets). They were keeping track of the previous thread on donated lures and were asking questions on the different types. A free week in Pittsburgh for the best photo. Second place gets two weeks, although I doubt anyone can top the apparel Phish is proudly displaying. What was Larry wearing??"
2972241,wallydave,2014-07-07 13:17:00,2151,Toasting the vets? No problem there for me!
