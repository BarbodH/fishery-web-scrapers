2965417,Fred_G,2014-07-04 17:07:00,908,Discover Card does not charge foreign transaction fees. Best card to use IMHO.
2930905,Obabikon,2014-06-24 09:55:00,2370,"3% is pretty light. Many outfitters charge 5%. I don't even accept plastic anymore, because they take so much on our end. With a check, the bank takes 1% for processing and exchange. Some credit cards will charge the customer 2-3% and the merchant 2% with a bad exchange rate. I just don't like it. I know I run the risk of a bad check, and not collecting. However, in 8 seasons here, I haven't had one that I didn't eventually get. If I do end up getting one, I figure its paid for itself several times by saving the credit card fees. A good way to potentially save a little money would be to ask the owner how they prefer payment, and if that could potentially save you a little money."
2930945,5thsuit,2014-06-24 10:09:00,54,We always pay cash. Very few repeat customers are ever going to stiff an outfitter on a check!
2930993,adempsey,2014-06-24 10:20:00,963,"Paying by email transfer this year. I think it costs me about $1 to do it. I am not from the USA, but I doubt that matters. For me, that's better than carrying cash or having to pay more fees to get a certified cheque or bank draft. Anything else will be on CC or cash."
2931225,bigwalleye1,2014-06-24 11:26:00,2632,"We always used to stop at a bank in Dryden for a stritch and to get Canadian funds. Couple years ago, they quit accepting USD any more than a nominal amount for non-customers, and other banks were doing the same thing. We were told they have no fraud protection and don't want to take a risk. I think they'd change $100 per person, but no more than that. +1 on Cabelas foreign 1% currency transfer fee. I just called to let them know I was going north. I now get CDN at my local credit union where I'm a member. I call, they take USD out of my account, orderthe CDN funds and call me when the funds arrive."
2950337,F250,2014-06-30 03:12:00,75,"This year I paid for everything (worms, fuel, motels, lodge) with my Cabela's Visa card. When we got home, I divided all the costs by 4 and my guys paid me back in US funds. LOTS of Cabelas points ! My guys were happy to just sit back and have me take care of the purchasing, and told me to have fun shopping with the extra points.."
2953641,drlee,2014-06-30 19:23:00,409,"Me, too!"
2955945,Ralfeee,2014-07-01 12:06:00,33,"I am pretty sure Discover does not charge an international transaction fee, but finding someone who takes it might be a different story."
2956281,2746,2014-07-01 14:02:00,3206,We pay the lodge by check as we have been going there for years. 1% on everything else I spend in Canada doesn't amount to enough to mess with getting Canada money. Even if I paid the camp with a card our total trip runs less than $1500. At 1% that's only $15.....not worth the time or hassle.
2960698,zeebee,2014-07-02 20:00:00,1144,"For whatever its worth, I dont believe thats a legal practice and contravenes their contract with the credit card companies."
2961178,btmbncr,2014-07-02 22:44:00,492,I send a check for our cabin rental in January.I pay for our whole month long trip.Any incidentals I pay cash for before we leave.Bill
2929785,heritage2008,2014-06-24 05:55:00,92,"So what do others due to pay for purchasing items in Canada coming from the USA--Discover, Mastercard, VISA, Cash? Is there a difference--can you save anything by exposing plastic?? I remember the days of the $1.50 exchange---long gone. We are staying in Huntsville overnight just to refresh for first day in Gowganda. In the past I'd grab a flat of worms from BillyBob's in NB but last few times they were not the best shape. Any other places I should drop in on the way to Gowganda? Thanks, David"
2929881,Skywagon,2014-06-24 06:13:00,1106,"I have a Canadian credit card as well as a US Mastercard. I unintentionally used my US card to pay for a large purchase in Canada last month, I just got the Mastercard statement, I was absolutely raped on the exchange rate. I am not sure if this is the practice with all Mastercards or just with this particular one I have, but it is something to be aware of and maybe to check out, if you are planning any large purchases in Canada with a Mastercard."
2929905,bigwalleye1,2014-06-24 06:16:00,2632,"I've got a Cabela's Visa, and they've always used the exchange rate of that day, and I don't think there's been any sort of fee attached."
2930137,Fishoil,2014-06-24 07:25:00,1277,"Last year my Cabela's card charged a small foreign transaction fee. This year I checked with my card providers and found that my Capitol One card doesn't charge a fee, so I used that one. Both of them give a fair exchange rate. You can also convert cash before crossing the border. Ryden's will give you 1% below the actual bank exchange rate. Generally this is better than the various merchants will give you if you spend US dollars in Canada."
2930225,SinOrSwim,2014-06-24 07:38:00,1528,"I've used my Visa with no issues. One thign to remember is to call your card company. If you use it in Canada the first time it works but many times they shut it down for fraud purposes after that. Also, we just pay american cash for most things. We get back change in Canadian currency and try to use that as we go. Always end up with some money left but not enough to worry about exchanging at the end.We use the kitty system. Everyone puts X dollars in a kitty and unless they buy something specifically for themselves, everything else comes out of the kitty. Gas, food etc."
2930273,Pooch,2014-06-24 07:45:00,4619,"I use my capital One Master Card and (so far) it's been the best conversion deal out there.Doesn't hurt to call your card holder and ask and also let them know you will be using it out of the USA. Sometimes, if there is no pattern of prior use in Canada, your card will be refused in Canada.I try to always use Canadian currency if I have enough on me for normal purchase such as meals.Pooch"
2930289,polaris-pete,2014-06-24 07:45:00,343,We have for many years gotten our Canadian money exchanged at the bridge where we cross. It sure isn't what it used to be exchange wise but in May we got 5% at the Border.I use my card only in an emergency as CASH always seems to work well. Our trip is always paid for in advance so really the only other expenses we have is gas and a motel room before flying in and our meals and any incidentals we may have forgotten or need.
2930345,JDP,2014-06-24 08:03:00,1457,I just called Customer Servicefor my Cabela's Card.I let them know each time I go to Canada.They reminded me that there is a 1% Foreign Transaction Fee (as Fishoil posted) for my purchases in Canada.
2930681,5thsuit,2014-06-24 09:10:00,54,Some Outfitters add 3% to your bill to cover their costs.
2930889,Lovetofish,2014-06-24 09:52:00,458,Is there a place in International Falls or Fort Francis to exchange US for Canadian dollars? Used to be able to do it at the Travel Center just after you cross in.
