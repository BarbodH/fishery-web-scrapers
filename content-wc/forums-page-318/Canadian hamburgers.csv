2956273,clarkend,2014-07-01 14:02:00,140,I agree with the barley comment above....Barley is the difference I think....most Canadian beef is barley fed. Not a lot of corn in Canada. and honestly if you are talking a fast food place I don't think there is a lot of real beef in a burger in the USA or Canada...lots of filler. Clarkie
2956785,drlee,2014-07-01 16:44:00,409,"I am not in the business of advising others what to do. I have read a great deal of literature on cooking ground meat, beef, pork, etc. I am fully aware that all recommendations are to cook to an internal temp of 185. I only commented on my personal experience; if people would ask me, which they do not, what they should do, I would tell them to follow the prescribed guidelines. What I do is my business. So, my statement is not uninformed. If you think it is foolish, that is fine with me."
2956857,kzoofisher,2014-07-01 16:54:00,5144,"Never had a burger in Canada but I can tell you that the best pizza I've had was at Romano's in St John NB. Crust was far superior to any thing I've had, including New York and Chicago pizzas."
2957145,v-bay gord,2014-07-01 18:23:00,3168,I have a guest that works for Oscar Meyer and the products they sell in Canada have to have more meat added to them......less filler. Go figure!

2959754,NMG,2014-07-02 14:44:00,1053,"One thing my wife noticed when she worked in Kansas for a year was that their ground beef seemed to be fresh ground steak. She said you could get ground sirloin, ground chuck, etc. She said it was much tastier than here, where I think ground beef is pretty much ground ""whatever can't be sold as roast or steak"", LOL.The best ground beef I've ever had here came from a Middle Eastern market where they had a halal certified butcher. That beef was incredible and it was unlike anything I ever had growing up in Canada. It actually tasted like steak.If you are looking for a good burger, your best bet is probably some roadside stand that makes their patties fresh. That said, it's likely still the beef referred to in the first paragraph"
2960042,2746,2014-07-02 16:20:00,3206,Actually the best burgers in Canada come off our grill in camp.

2944385,v-bay gord,2014-06-27 19:34:00,3168,Never trust an Ontario hamburger. They are full of grass. Which reminds me of the South Dakota prime rib I once ate. The worse piece of meat I ever 'et. Of course it was in a bar......

2953625,drlee,2014-06-30 19:21:00,409,"Not certain about NW Ontario, but some Canadian provinces have laws that require them to cook all ground meat ""well done."" Hence, the tasteless, dry burger. I ordered one, asked for med. rare, and was told no. Did not ever eat a second. Grass fed vs grain...wrong. Both are just fine if they are cooked properly. People are too nervous about eating less than well done beef...I have been doing med. rare for years and have never had a problem, if you don't count on eating too much as a problem. Will be 70 soon and all is well."
2954593,MrSimon,2014-07-01 06:45:00,922,"We buy a half cow every year and put it in the freezer. It's our meat for the year (along with a few deer). The last few we've gotten have been 100% grass fed. You can tell a difference between grass fed and grain fed, but its minor. If you get good quality grass fed beef and cook it properly, it is absolutely delicious. And better for you. It's also not pumped full of hormones and antibiotics like the grocery store meat. I do agree that most burgers I get in Canada do not taste very good."
2955017,biggamefisher,2014-07-01 08:18:00,540,"Anyone who doesn't know why they should eat all ground beef well done, cooked to at least an internal temperature of 185 F is flirty with one of the deadliest bacteria on the planet, it's been so much in the news lately, that I can't believe you would make such a foolish and uninformed statement! E Coli 0157 E7 is deadly, you've been lucky so far, and might be for the rest of your life, maybe not!http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health...onwide-n110336"
2955385,biggamefisher,2014-07-01 09:52:00,540,"Forgot to mention, the bacteria is on the outside of the meat, so ground products are a concern because during the process the bacteria, if present, is mixed into the product, cooking to an internal temperature of 185 kills it, whereas on steaks the bacteria remains on the outside, is killed by the cooking process, the inside of the cut can be as rare as you want. Again I have to say that it bothers me that there is still the thought process out there that someone thinks that ground beef that is not thoroughly cooked is ok, brags about it as if they are some sort of hero! Hopefully the rest of us are way smarter than that. We also have a handfull of local burger joints have outstanding homemade burgers; Blondies Mrs. Mike's V.J.'s Country Porch Super Boys Juniors White Top Red Top GFB George's To name a few in this city (Winnipeg), hey...and they all cook their product thoroughly."

2955681,Elrik,2014-07-01 11:03:00,82,"To the original poster's comment, i suspect it has nothing to do with the beef being used, but the style of burger they are eating. In canada ""meatloaf"" style burgers are quite popular, lots of filler, breadcrumbs, eggs, spices etc. for the most part they are pretty nasty. I much prefer places that stick to a simple meat salt pepper mix and save the flavouring for the toppings. Most likely the specific same taste ones that the poster is complaining about are either maple leaf or m&m frozen patties. These are about 50% fat/filler and the other half low grade beef. If you come into the more populous parts of the country you can get some darn good burgers, so please don't judge our whole country on what you eat around the fishing camps"
2939841,Mrnovice,2014-06-26 15:19:00,75,"I agree totally. Awesome country, have many good friends that I have met through the years but I haven't found a burger I like yet. Just something different about it. Even the Heinz ketchup tastes different from the states, that's part of the problem"
2940049,v-bay gord,2014-06-26 16:24:00,3168,http://www.livingabroadincanada.com/.../#.U6ydPSIU8dU Apparently others have noticed the Ketchup difference too.
2940401,Pooch,2014-06-26 17:56:00,4619,We've noticed the different flavor of beef and pork around the country and world and it is usually what the animal has been fed. On some islands in Hawaii the beef tastes (to me) like the grass they graze on. Same thing in Ireland.In the States we are used to grain fed beef also on alfalfa or clover hay forage. Pooch
2940465,zeebee,2014-06-26 18:18:00,1144,"My impression...USA corn fed beef is tastier, Cdn grain fed pork is better.This seems to be supported by international demand for the respective products.For a good steak or prime rib I try and source out restaurants that offer USA beef. Not too many up here do and you pay a premium for it......well worth it though.Those factory ""beef"" patties are high in filler cereals. My local butcher offers pre made bison patties which are great if you are too lazy to make your own."
2940601,Mrnovice,2014-06-26 19:04:00,75,I knew it!! Can't wait to show my family this. They thought I was nuts
2940785,BuckeyeBill,2014-06-26 19:51:00,76,Son and I just had a burger at Knobby's in Sioux Lookout. We both enjoyed them but realized we could only afford one burger per trip. Will look forward to our next one in 2015.
2941241,CamoHunter,2014-06-26 21:57:00,363,"I don't think so. Taste wise, I've had WAY better steaks and burgers in the US versus Canada. I don't know what it is, but I would guess it has something to do with what they're fed and what they graze on. Think I'll go fire up the grill..."
2941377,adempsey,2014-06-27 04:35:00,963,It's probably where you are eating. I lived in Boston for three years and never noticed any difference in the meat. There are differences in various foods though. For example I think Coke is made with sucrose in Canada and high fructose corn syrup in the US. People can tell the difference.
2941465,northernbite,2014-06-27 05:13:00,1186,"Well the only place I eat hamburgers in Canada is at the ""Watershed ""stop On 144 south of Timmons. They are hand make them, but all is subject to change. So far they have been good for 30 years. Paul"

I've been going to Canada off and on for years, and every one that I've had has tasted like some sort of weird pre-pressed kind of beef breakfast sausage. Have I just always eaten at bad restaurants? Or am I just being to American, and Canada just has different food? Don't get me wrong, I'm not knocking Canada. I love it up there - great fishing, nice people, lots of wilderness etc. I just haven't figured out why the burgers are so weird."
2936801,v-bay gord,2014-06-25 16:30:00,3168,I think burgers have gone downhill too ( I think they cook them ahead and let them sit in a drawer)......but maybe this is what is missing? http://www.thespec.com/news-story/22...49th-parallel/

2938633,deadhead1,2014-06-26 08:38:00,193,From what you are saying I think those establishments are too lazy to make their own patties and are buying pre-formed ones. Some of them are ok and some are real bad but nothing beats a home made patty.

2939825,NeLab1,2014-06-26 15:14:00,30,"better or worse its all based on what you were raised on, I grew up eating corn finished beef. I worked in a custom butcher shop for 14 years you can tell by the feel if an animal was raised on corn or grass fed. by the marbling in the meat and the way it cuts. it all comes down to the flavor of age meat, a fat animal will hang in a cooler 28 days and be in great shape a grass fed beef will not hang as well."
