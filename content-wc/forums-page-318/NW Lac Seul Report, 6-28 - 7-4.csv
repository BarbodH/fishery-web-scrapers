We had a steady SW wind the first three days and we found lots of quality walleye just outside the weed edge at about 8 - 12 FOW, where the SW wind had been blowing into. One day in particular will rate as one of my best walleye days with both great numbers and good size (lots of 22 - 26"" fish). I watched the forecast and saw that the wind was going to shift to the NW and temps were going to drop, so I assumed our luck might change on Wednesday, and it did. Couldn't find the same quality or numbers in the weed beds that had been producing for us, so we had to hunt. We hit most of the islands just outside the shortcut that feeds into the Bay of Islands, but they were very spotty. We'd catch one or two, but that was all. The word I was getting from around camp was that water temps were still a bit low in the main body of the lake, so I never got out around Manitoba Point and that area. Maybe I missed the boat on that one. Several of the folks staying at LSL made the daily trip to Broad and reported fantastic fishing, although they had LOTs of company. I'd rather keep to ourselves than fight the crowd, but that's just me.We did find a couple spots in Rat Bay, right close to home, where we could probably catch 200 fish per day if we just stayed there. Most of those would be in the 12 - 14 inch range, but we did pull out a 24 and a 26 in those spots.Overall, a very good trip. This was my first time staying at the main lodge with LSL (stayed at the Sunlight outpost last year), and my wife was very impressed with the cabin we had. Not only was it newer and very clean, she was impressed with the little things - all of the dishes and cutlery matched. The three-piece furniture in the living room matched and was very comfortable. Most lodges where I've taken her are equipped with whatever glasses, dishes, and silverware the owner can find at a garage sale. That doesn't bother me a bit, but add up all of those little things and she was impressed. Oh, one other item to note - the water had been rising steadily when we were there. Each morning, the rising water would pick up every log lying along the shoreline and we had to maneuver through the gauntlet of floating debris. The Shortcut, in particular, would be jammed with logs. By evening, the chop would push the logs back to their resting place along the banks. Be careful out there!"
2971761,Carnhzkr,2014-07-07 11:13:00,964,Forgot to mention I caught a small musky in Scout Bay. I'd never caught a musky before and didn't think there were many in the NW part of LS. Also caught two blue walleye - one in Scout Bay and another in the South Inlet.
2972001,rather-be-fishin,2014-07-07 12:12:00,429,"Thanks for the nice report! We are heading up in 19 days to Lac Seul, Fisherman's Cove in Scout Bay. We also caught a 27"" Musky in South Inlet 2 years ago & were surprised too! RBF"
2972185,muskyroller,2014-07-07 13:04:00,56,I'd love to see pictures of the two muskies you both caught. Send me a p.m. And we can exchange emails. Steve
2972217,Carnhzkr,2014-07-07 13:11:00,964,"Sorry, I don't have a picture. It was only about 27"" or so. It was just significant to me because I can now put a check next to musky on the varieties of fish I caught. I remember an older thread where someone asked if anyone had caught musky in the NW section of the lake, and as I recall, no one reported to have done so."
2972289,muskyroller,2014-07-07 13:36:00,56,"I just wonder if it was indeed a musky...We've been at Onaway the last seven years and Evergreen the three years before that. I throw musky stuff chasing after big pike and I haven't seen one in ten years of trying some prime stuff. I have caught silver pike, no color, just silver, but they have the tail of a northern pike...rounded fins and spots. Muskies will have the pointed tail tips...that's the easiest way for me to tell the difference between a pure musky, tiger musky, and northern pike....look at the tail...pointed = musky. rounded = pike or tiger musky. Also was in contact with Silver Water Wheel and in fifteen years of fishing the central basin (much closer to the east end where they are) and they have never once encountered one in all their chasing big pike."
2972329,Aspencreek,2014-07-07 13:53:00,2911,"Was at Onaway a couple years ago and after dinner my son and I went to a spot just as you enter the Bay of Islands from Scout bay. Those of you who stay at Onaway or Fishermans cove will know the area. While drifting along the west shore in about 12-14' there is a large Boulder that comes up (now do you know the spot) that sits just below the surface or just above. My son hooks into a walleye and as he is getting ready to net it a LARGE musky tries to rob his walleye. Not once but twice! Now the first thing I saw was this mouth of teeth about a foot wide and the distinctive stripes of a Musky, the second time all I thought was .......we need a bigger boat (Jaws flashback). The walleye didn't make it to the boat at least not all of it. The Musky are there, and getting more plentiful, that is the only one I've seen this close to camp. We don't try to fish for them, but exciting things like this is what makes the trips so memorable."
2972369,Carnhzkr,2014-07-07 14:07:00,964,"Maybe it was a silver pike. I'm certainly no musky expert. It was the shape of a pike but had no spots. It didn't have the typical musky stripes either, for that matter. Guess I'll have to white-out the check next to musky."
2973065,BenBeattie,2014-07-07 16:31:00,232,"The muskies in Lac Seul are the type 'clear' (as opposed to spotted or barred) and have next to no stripes, spots or markings whatsoever. I've also encountered 'silver' pike that no doubt get mistaken as juvenile muskie. I've never fished the NW section of the lake so can't comment on the muskie population there. However after working 4 years at Silver Water Wheel (and knowing they've never caught one after casting thousands of angler hours over prime structure with bucktails etc. for pike in 15 years) I know the density is low on the west/central side. Being on the SE/NE area for 6 years now, I can say for sure this is the part of LS to chase muskies."
2973521,muskyroller,2014-07-07 18:54:00,56,"Ben, thanks for chiming in...should've put quote marks around the fifteen year silver water wheel comment I made. Still love seeing pike and musky pics from the NW section of LS. I'll try getting some up from our Onaway trip two weeks ago."
