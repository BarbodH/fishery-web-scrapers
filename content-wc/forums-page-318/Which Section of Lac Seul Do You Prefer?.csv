2970777,WalleyeWally28,2014-07-07 06:02:00,298,I agree.
2970785,Jwendt15,2014-07-07 06:07:00,72,We are planning on going the first or second week in June. Does that make a difference?
2971057,SinOrSwim,2014-07-07 07:39:00,1528,"That video is awesome..........only because I can feel your pain as we have been there before. Never had one in the net like that but have tried getting a big fish into a small net before. We stay at Onaway. I honestly don't think you would find nicer accommodations. Cabins, docks, fish house, boats etc. We fish over by Manitoba point quite a bit. Have never ventured too far into the main basin though. It's about a 35 to 50 minute drive to Manitoba from Onaway. Not bad if it's calm."
2971505,btmbncr,2014-07-07 09:39:00,492,"Jwendt15Yes it does make a difference.At that time the walleyes will most likely be moving out of their spawning locations.On the northwest end of the lake I'd look for those June,1st or 2nd week of,walleyes close to the mouth of the Wenasaga Sanctuary and in Sawmill Bay.Bill"
2972401,Aspencreek,2014-07-07 14:11:00,2911,"Early season the ear falls end of the lake would be a little better, but guys seem to forget about all the spots that lend itself to ""spawning grounds"" around South islet, and bay of islands earlier in the season. But after the weather warms and the lake temps rise along with the weed lines, the area around Bay of islands, Manitoba, hungry narrows, Stoney Pt and McKenzie all heat up. And it's a HE)) of a ride from Ear Falls all the way to McKenzie or even Manitoba Pt. Finally, don't wait too long deciding on a place, Onaway fills up with repeat customers (that should tell you something) and so does most of the other places in the area. My opinion, if you can get in, do it!!"
2972961,Jwendt15,2014-07-07 16:01:00,72,"Yeah, trying to book this week, especially with a larger group. We can get in at the end of the lake at Ear Falls, but not all in one Cabin. They do have large cabins available still at Onaway or Lac Seul Lodge. All look great but we are goi g to fish. If you guys think fishing is better at the far NE end of the lake at the beginning of June, it may be worth the sacrifice on accommodations. They are still very nice."
2973001,Aspencreek,2014-07-07 16:11:00,2911,"If you can get in at Onaway, do it. Blair can put you on fish that time of the year in that section of the lake, what people forget to tell you is that the best fishing is just outside the sanctuary, that's great, but do you want to spend your entire time in one place with 5000 of your closest friends!!! I may be exaggerating, but it will seem like 5000. if this lake is new to you, you should get a guide anyway, and a guide will certainly get you on fish from Onaway's dock. Plus, the cabins, docking facilities, fish house are THE BEST!"
2966809,Jwendt15,2014-07-05 13:16:00,72,"So we are starting to plan our 2015 trip. Stayed at Evergreen this past June and loved the area. Had some great fishing this year as well. Due to a larger group size for next year, we may need to look elsewhere with availability. I really like the look of Onaway Lodge, but it is in a totally different area of the lake, still NW though. Does anyone prefer a specific spot on the lake over another? Not sure if it is worth the move to a different section after becoming familiar with the area around Evergreen. And for your viewing pleasure, a 30 in walleye flops out of the net on our last night. I still blame the smaller net, but glad we have a video and not just a story! Might not be ""huge"" for some of you guys, but for our first time fishing in Canada, we had never seen a walleye that big. Looking forward to next year!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbO_l8eC74E"
2966817,Jwendt15,2014-07-05 13:27:00,72,"I should add, if anyone has ever stayed around Evergreen and Onaway, have you had better fishing experiences at one over the other? From the fishing we experienced in June, I would almost assume you can catch fish anywhere in that lake."
2966849,ftfarms,2014-07-05 13:39:00,444,This is my 2cents. I like the area around evergreen lodge early in the year and than we move down by Onway lodge for the summer months. Now I haven't fished lac suel in a few years but I'm sure it hasn't changed. We switch to fishing lotws so we don't have that extra 2-3 hours driving time.
2966865,rather-be-fishin,2014-07-05 13:43:00,429,"I had fished 2 years out of Evergreen area resorts & then 9 years out of Scout Bay Fisherman's Cove Resort which is next to Onaway resort. This is a great lication on the lake. Closer to McKenzie & Bay of Islands, South Bay, South Inlet & Manitou Narrows area & main basin. Scout Bay also has good fishing close by if it is very windy or questionable weather. I know people who go to Onaway & rate the resort top notch. So is Fisherman's Cove. Both have large cabins to accommodate big groups. Nice docks & camp boats & motors. You won't be disappointed! 21 days & counting down to our return trip to awesome Lac Seul! RBF"
2967737,thunder1,2014-07-05 20:55:00,27,Been going to Gold Pines for 20 some years in the N.W. section of Lac Seul. A couple of times each trip venture east 35 miles to fish new territory. With the price of fuel not really cost effective. We like the hosts so well probably wont change. Excellent fishing!
2968041,btmbncr,2014-07-06 01:30:00,492,"I like the main lake basin,south and east of Manitoba Point,Stony Point and Windigo Point in Mid July through mid August."
2968969,geomax,2014-07-06 12:54:00,29,"Nice fish, thanks for sharing the video, I felt the pain of watching that flop out. Looks like its time to step up your net when fishing Lac Seul, I use a frabill conservation series net on Lac Seul or in tournament waters."
2969801,Pooch,2014-07-06 17:08:00,4619,"You could buy a deeper replacement Fabril rubber net for your handle. I like that type of rubber net, but yours and most others are way to shallow. Like a trampoline. We've never lost a fish out of our deeper net and you'd be surprised at how large a northern you can ""scoop"" in to the boat with it.These rubber nets do have a lot more drag in the water and would be scorned by a lot of folks. Especially tournament people. I doubt I'll buy another, even though I've had good luck with them.Pooch"
2969889,Jwendt15,2014-07-06 18:02:00,72,I agree. Already purchased a couple that are deeper and a bit wider. Never had an issue with them until we got that larger walleye. Can't imagine netting a 40+ inch pike with those.
2970017,Pauleye78,2014-07-06 18:43:00,57,I had the same thing happen to me about 25 years ago. My rubber net is at the bottom of LOTW along with my trophy walleye. Will never buy a rubber net again.
