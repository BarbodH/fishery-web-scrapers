2961034,Mrnovice,2014-07-02 21:29:00,75,Heading up to Fishermans Cove shortly for the first time. Fished Lac Seul out of Ear Falls but totally different area. Anyone been there the last couple of weeks? Bringing up 5 teenagers who don't fish a lot so crossing fingers that the fish will cooperate!
2961130,btmbncr,2014-07-02 22:04:00,492,I'm sure the camp owners can steer you to good fishing.I love fishing down on that part of the lake.I wouldn't be surprised to find the walleyes showing up on the Big and Little Sand Banks in Mc Kenzie Bay. We leave for Lac Seul in 16 days.Bill
2961810,tlars,2014-07-03 08:03:00,137,The owners are great. They'll put you on fish. Consider hiring a guide for a day to take a fishing tour and find spots that you can return to.

If you haven't fished McKenzie, Bay of Islands, South Bay, South Inlet or Mannitou Narrow areas, it is a very good idea to reserve a guide for early in your trip. They will show you safe travel routes & good fishing spots & what their biting on. If the weather is bad or windy, there is also good fishing nearby in Scout Bay. Heard the water is high, so keep an eye out for floating logs & stumps! A good GPS/depth finder is a must! It's an AWESOME Walleye lake & you all will have a blast! When are you going? Counting down ... 23 more days & we will be there too! RBF"
2962498,Mrnovice,2014-07-03 11:49:00,75,"Will be fishing on the 12th. Weather permitting, suppose to have a guide on the 13th. Little worried about the high water, fish won't be where they are supposed to be???"
2962610,rather-be-fishin,2014-07-03 12:49:00,429,"Mrnovice ~Yes that is true with high water fishing will be different check out the post on this site ""Onaway 2014"" by Muskyroller on 7/1/14.
