2961202,btmbncr,2014-07-02 22:48:00,492,Does you r group need boats or do you bring your own boats?If you need boats I'd look at every Evergreen Lodge or Gold Pines Camp.If you bring your own boats I'd say Gawley's Little Beaver Lodge.Bill
2964130,cuamb,2014-07-04 07:21:00,203,You can also look at the houseboat option. I have stayed with Ken and Brenda and also done the houseboat. Enjoyed them both. Houseboat will run you a little less money.http://siouxfloatinglodges.com/http://www.lacseulfloatinglodges.com/index.html
2967849,Guest,2014-07-05 21:36:00,0,You really need to consider this camp. 20 plus years there and never a bad experience. Excellent hosts reasonably priced variety of boats and excellent fishing
2968433,btyreprich,2014-07-06 08:35:00,1067,"In the Ear Falls area of Lac Seul, look at Whitewing Resort. They have two houseboats for rent. Cabins - especially the non-log cabins are quite large. Boats and motors are first rate. Dave and Bobbie are great people. We have been guests of theirs for 12 + years and have a very high rate of repeat customers."
2968697,narly12,2014-07-06 10:21:00,13,"Past 15 years I have been going to Lost Island Lodge along with up to 10 other fishermen. Cabins on an island, great docking facilities, and the Staff are all reliable, knowledgeable and very willing to help."
2951961,deke4257,2014-06-30 11:36:00,5,"New user...Hey guys and gals we just returned from Sioux Lookout area fishing Minnetaki and Abrahms lake. Good fishing this year at the English river and Abram chutes. We are looking for recommendations for a place to stay on Lac Seul, shooting Pelican Falls is not for us. I know we will need a guide for a day or so. We usually have 8 in our group. Any help would be appreciated, I understand the need to book early for 2015. Thanks again"
2952097,wallydave,2014-06-30 12:21:00,2151,"http://www.lacseul.com/Give this site a look, nice cabins and boats, 17.5 ft Lund Outfitters, gas and nminnows included, not far from several spring spawning sites. Fished out of this camp for many years, as noted try to book early! Happy shopping!"
2952369,SinOrSwim,2014-06-30 13:41:00,1528,That is the opposite side of the lake isn't it?
2952577,Bitinlight,2014-06-30 14:48:00,95,Lac Seul Outposts is definitely worth looking at. www.lacseuloutposts.com
2953265,WalleyeWally28,2014-06-30 18:08:00,298,www.whitewingresort.comBeen staying at Whitewing in the NW section of Lac Seul for the past 12 years and are never disappointed. Cabins are very nice and they have a couple that will accommodate 8.
2953393,MorganMan,2014-06-30 18:35:00,341,"Does it matter where? If not, check out Onaway Lodge. Accomodations are great! Not all the way up to Ear Falls, but up Hwy 105 from Vermillion Bay."
2953601,drlee,2014-06-30 19:14:00,409,"Stayed a couple of years at Lac Seul Lodge...excellent cabins, excellent service on the docks, cannot say a bad thing about any of our experiences there. Was recommended to me by Guy Winterton, the retired walleye management coordinator in NW Ontario many years ago. The lake was too big for me, but I have fond memories."
2955737,Steve Ediger,2014-07-01 11:12:00,97,"I would second the vote for Lac Seul Lodge. The cabins are roomy, clean, and modern. The boats are top notch. The service is second to none. Rod and Lorita are great hosts. Just got back two weeks ago and am heading back for my second trip in three weeks. Been going there for fifteen years and love the place. Steve"
2955753,Aspencreek,2014-07-01 11:13:00,2911,"Second this recommendation, Blair and Kathy are top notch and run a great camp. The cabins, boats (if you don't have your own)and docking facilities are second to NONE. Great part of the lake and close to many spots that even a 13yr veteran has not hit them all yet.Check out their website: Lac Seul Onaway lodge, the video at the start has pictures of my grandson and uncle. Unfortunately I am not able to make the trip anymore, but have lots of great memories and maybe someday will be able to get back up to Onaway."
2959354,geomax,2014-07-02 11:45:00,29,"From the Sioux Lookout side it is hard to beat staying with Ken and Brenda at Chamberlain Narrows. So I second the vote for Lac Seul Outpostshttp://www.lacseuloutposts.com/I live in the area and fish in Sioux Lookout very often including running the falls up. But even with that I still stay with them at least once a year, some years twice. Top notch equipment, easy sand beach landing, best access to NE Lac Seul overall. You want walleye fishing, they got walleye fishing."
