2968273,fisher_i_am,2014-07-06 07:09:00,498,sounds as if the hatch is on now in SE LS area.... Typically how king dues the hatch last?
2968777,Fisherman Ted,2014-07-06 11:01:00,461,"in NW Ontario the nymphs are emerging now. Bass, walleye etc all gorging themselves. Just a matter of a few days until they spin."
2969745,jokerjim,2014-07-06 16:58:00,473,I have had good luck using small mister twister curly tail grubs in yellow during the mayfly hatch.
2970153,Pooch,2014-07-06 19:08:00,4619,"Just got back from Lac Seul Lodge and there has been a fair hatch going on last week. After the wind some areas of the lake we saw had large mats of carcasses floating around. There were also a lot of them on and around the cabin. One morning we came down to a boat covered with dead and dying mayflies.I've seen worse, so I'm guessing (only) that it's not over. I've seen them coming up even later in the year, but not in huge numbers. Not so sure they don't hatch all summer to some extent.Pooch"
2952225,Bakefish,2014-06-30 12:59:00,1077,I was in Canada early in the month and didn't run into them. Anyone else see them this year? I was in the Ear Falls area the week of June 8th.

2952569,ftfarms,2014-06-30 14:47:00,444,We seen a few the later part of the week when we fished 5-31-6-7 out of morson on lotws. A very few.
2952593,Hump,2014-06-30 14:53:00,578,"Just returned from NW Lac Seul, none"
2955793,Aspencreek,2014-07-01 11:19:00,2911,"The Mayfly hatch in Canada usually doesn't happen in Ontario until July, just an observation, in CA they should be referred to as July flies."
2956041,Jaskonie,2014-07-01 12:31:00,80,"We go mid July every year, love fishing during the hatch, find the flies find feeding walleyes! We fish right under the balls of larvae and kill um!"
2958074,north560,2014-07-02 06:19:00,53,With the hot weather the hatch has begun.
2962170,Fisherman Ted,2014-07-03 09:27:00,461,"In NW Ontario we have several mayfly hatches. We had our first 2 weeks ago with the smaller variety. They are long gone and now we are waiting for the hexagenias to show up, which are the big suckers that fish will go crazy for. Walleye and even lakers will follow the nymphs around the lake as they hatch and come to the surface (and are at the mercy of the winds/current). Once they spin bass will go nuts and fly-fishing is absolutely incredible. -FT"
2964146,fisher_i_am,2014-07-04 07:21:00,498,Silly question...What is the best way to find these mayflies. I've been going up for years and must be to late to see or experience them. I'll be up in Sioux Lookout area starting July12 th wondering if they'll be gone and if not what to look for.... Are they more likely to be in certain areas and are they quit noticeable. Thanks
2964274,kzoofisher,2014-07-04 08:08:00,5144,"Mayflies look like sailboats in silhouette. The particular ones we're talking about will be 1""-2"" long with yellow bellies and brown backs, three long tails an mottled wings. They are the burrower type and will emerge from area of mud or silt bottom at night, fly to the trees and molt into their reproductive phase. Next night they will return to the water and lay eggs. When the hatch is heavy the water will be covered with spent bugs in the morning. Obviously lakes that are mostly rock will have smaller hatches, also having a good river entering the lake helps."
