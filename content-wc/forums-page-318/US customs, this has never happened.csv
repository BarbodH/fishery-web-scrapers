The north , south , east , west each had a dot on them to glow in the dark . Didn't take them long to find it either . They waved an instrument around the back of the truck and there it was ."
2964954,Jimmy Jig,2014-07-04 12:14:00,1905,Crossed at I.F. 6/2/14 the nice ladies gave my dog a treat. Most of the times they never knew she was on board.
2946241,3M TA3,2014-06-28 16:47:00,2846,"Both sides of the boarder have a job to do. Some are friendly, some not. Answer their questions truthfully and let them do their job, however they see fit. Getting your panties in a bunch usually becomes obvious to these guys and some of them just like to be entertained. Let it go. give them what they want and be on your way. Do you really accomplish anything by getting all bound up?"
2949521,JayM5209,2014-06-29 18:55:00,1050,"I suspect that most of the folks who have difficulty at a border crossing do so because they approach with a chip on their shoulder, such as the chip demonstrated by your posts. Just because you know you're a citizen of the U.S. and have served in the Corps doesn't mean they know that. Thanks for your service, but I'd suggest a little humility will go a long way in easing any future crossings."
2949601,Rich B,2014-06-29 19:15:00,1081,"Just spent a week north of the Soo, and had a very good crossing heading north on Sat (a week ago). Ontario Border Guard (younger female) was very professional, asked the normal type questions and wished us a good week at camp.Yesterday morning, had a very professional yet through older male USA Border Guard address both my wife and I, as well as our married daughter and her husband. Respectful, yet many more questions than had been asked in the past....I had noted that our ""line"" moved much slower than the other lines at Customs...at the end, he welcomed us back to the States.We just missed the start of the Soo ""Bridge walk"".....we caught it last year, and while it held us up for a time, it was certainly interesting to see a lot of folks in costume walking the Soo bridge.Faith, Family, Friends.....and Fishing,Rich B"
2950249,MuskyMaster,2014-06-29 22:27:00,79,"Crossing into Canada we planned on claiming our extra booze, but the guy didn't ask and sent us on our way real quick. The way back the guy was cool joking with us because 1 guy had a different last name. Both crossings were easy"
2950785,Stu,2014-06-30 07:24:00,472,"I was waiting in line one year and accidentally laid on the horn REALLY LOUD. The agent leaned out and gave me a really mean glare. I must have had that ""Oh Sh!t"" look on my face because when I pulled up, he just started laughing. After a few cursory questions he waived us on thru."
2951593,MrSimon,2014-06-30 10:23:00,922,"I'm pretty sure the Constitution doesn't grant you the right to be treated politely at a border crossing. You seem to forget that border guards protect our country too, not just members of the military. But regardless, as was stated above .... if you have everything in order, answer the questions truthfully, and maintain a pleasant and agreeable attitude, you won't have any trouble."
2951777,CI_Guy,2014-06-30 10:49:00,2118,"As someone who handled warranty calls in a service industry I can tell you with 99% certainty that her boss would tell you he agreed with you even if he didn't! By the time someone calls to complain, it's a damage control situation. It doesn't matter who's right or who's wrong, you make any reasonable concessions to the angry customer and hope they leave satisfied!"
2953201,MorganMan,2014-06-30 17:55:00,341,"Well said. As much as I dread the interactions, this is definitely the best advice for those of you who haven't experienced it yet. After many years, I make sure everyone in the truck removes sunglasses, opens windows so they can see in, and don't get cute with comments or questions. Only answer what they ask, IF they ask. Have your things in order for questions you KNOW they will ask. Booze? yep and here is a list. Tobacco? Same thing. Know what is in YOUR vehicle, even if there are many vehicles with the group."
2953553,drlee,2014-06-30 19:11:00,409,"For the past several years, we have been crossing at Pigeon River, rather than Ft. Frances. It is only because we fish lakes in the Ignace area and it makes more sense to take that route. However, we have found the crossing to be much more enjoyable at Pigeon River. Border guards are business like, but generally pleasant. I think they keep track in their electronic records, because I have been going across there and to the same camps for a number of years, and they seem to even remember me, depending on the agent on duty. They are often surprised at the amount of alcohol we take in, cause we have some big time beer drinkers...but they are good natured about it. We always declare every drop and give them receipts from our US purchase to make it easier for them to figure the duty charge. They like my dog, Daisy, a Brittany who thinks everybody loves her. We had some pretty rude treatment over the years at Ft. Frances on the Canadian side. I know they are more stressed there and very busy, but it was annoying. That said, it has been a long time since I have crossed there. The US agents have always been pleasant, but quite business like...except they always want to pet Daisy."
2956057,Iowa4ND,2014-07-01 12:41:00,35,"last time we crossed was several years ago in Emerson. Going into Canada was fine, took a little while as we had one who had an old public intox charge he had to explain. Coming back was another story. They got a hit on a vehicle in our line for some type of radioactive material, so they pulled four or five out of our line to move to a separate bay. Well an hour later and guess who's truck was the only one still being searched? We took the truck thru several times, agent drove the truck thru himself, we walked thru out of truck and we could never find what was causing the hit. In talking later with my sister who works at a lab, she asked if I had some of dad's old lures, which I did. She said they may have gotten it from the type of paint used on those lures. Anyone else have that? I can say, throughtout the whole process all agents were very professional and courteous. Going back up this year so going to separate those lures and have them ready to pull out if needed."
2936673,Nimstug,2014-06-25 16:06:00,2605,"At the risk of being obvious, the driver should not be hard of hearing. One year on the way back into the U.S., my partner gave all the right answers, but they were to the wrong questions. I leaned forward in the passenger seat and pointed at my ear. Got a nod from the agent and shortly we were on our way."
2936697,yoopertrout,2014-06-25 16:09:00,1172,"This year the American was nicer than the Canadian to me (both were fine though.) I've been treated badly by the American agents a couple times, once very badly, and for no apparent reason."
2937273,jimirjr,2014-06-25 18:52:00,1149,YES.... as a matter of fact....
2937425,MorganMan,2014-06-25 19:41:00,341,"Yup, and I like it that way!"
2937497,Pooch,2014-06-25 19:55:00,4619,"Border agents on both sides have always been easy to get a long with. Only once was there a misunderstanding. My wife and I were coming home through Pigeon River and were the next car up so we were setting there where we were supposed to wait and the agent was waving his hands talking to another agent and I thought he was waving me in, but wasn't sure. So I started then stopped and he then was gesturing with his hands, but evidently not to me. It was really kind of comical. I asked my wife ""is he motioning for us?"" and she replied that she wasn't sure either.Finally he actually leaned out and made eye contact. He gave me a mild dressing down for starting in then stopping. At the most it hurt my feeling a (very) little as he was right, but he needs to not talk with his hands.Otherwise these guys are great in my opinion.Pooch"
2937577,ch1488,2014-06-25 20:15:00,6,"This year upon entering Canada one of our guys was informed that his passport was expired. We felt it best to be straight forward with the US agent about the situation, so included his DL with the passport. I as driver informed the agent of the situation. He asked that I roll down the back window so he could see the ""gentleman."" He said ""Mr. CD do you promise to renew your passport as soon as you get home."" The answer was ""yes."" The agent then said ""That was your tongue lashing, welcome home guys."" He then smiled and sent us on our way."
2938041,HeHooksHimself,2014-06-26 05:29:00,725,"We were crossing the border on the far east entrance of Minnesota, I forget the name of the crossing as that was the only time we used it, but its the one that is at the end of the beautiful drive on the north side of lake superior. Anyway, we were coming back into the USA and i was the driver. The agent, very business like asked a litany of questions. When he asked, ""any fruits?"" I replied ""Just him"" while pointing at my BIL and the agent just laughed and sent us on our way. Later we decided that reaching for that humor could have ended much differently."
2940681,MorganMan,2014-06-26 19:28:00,341,"I'm sure it kind of sucks to have those jobs. I was up in the bush on a fly in when 9/11 happened and I'm sure both sides have had an eye opening and have added stress with their jobs. Not a job I would want, much like an air traffic controller. Too much responsibility I think. I DO believe in profiling, as it does make sense in the short term, but would not the responsibility of theirs to be sure nothing crosses their lanes on their time! Kudos to those folks and I do have an understanding of their stress. They have a job while trying to be friendly."
2945649,J.Iverson,2014-06-28 10:36:00,64,"We came back on the 21st with the same thing ""welcome back"" and that was it. It was a welcomed change to the way were have been treated in the past when they separated my children and asked them if they took home any rocks and if my wife and I were really their parents, they would typically search the back of the truck to. I understand they are doing their job, but there was a 5 year period there where we felt like we were being treated rude and condescended to for no reason."
2945665,packpro,2014-06-28 10:47:00,695,"After many years of a one-two+ hour wait (one year, four hours-we drove to the next crossing) I have to give both governments credit for improving the wait times. Getting into Canada (usually midnight on Friday) has never been too bad. Getting back into the USA has always been bad. You get to the ""T"" in the road at Fort Francis and you turn right and head into town, make a U-turn (with a boat) and get into the back of the line. So frustrating when you still have 10-11 hours head of you. However the last four years, we have turned left at ""T"". Each year the line is shorter. Last year we were the 8th car in line. This year we drove right to the booth. Plus, professional attitudes by the officers. They got it right."
2934681,Aaron-IN,2014-06-25 08:45:00,500,"Coming back over the border Friday afternoon (6/20), nobody in line ahead of us, we get to the Customs agent, hand him our passports, he looks at the two of us, looks back at the boat, turns around and stamps the passports and says ""welcome back""......., that was a first."
2934817,Sportdog,2014-06-25 09:13:00,6735,"Yes. The two times that I returned from Canada the exact same thing happened. Very friendly and a hearty ""Welcome Home""."
2934889,LOW1,2014-06-25 09:35:00,2828,I have had one US agent at IFalls give my dog a dog biscuit. The poor pooch remembered and was disappointed on the next trip when he was forced to return to his homeland hungry.

2935913,SinOrSwim,2014-06-25 13:05:00,1528,In the last 8 to 10 years we have had nicer Canada border agents than the US side.

2936129,bigwalleye1,2014-06-25 14:11:00,2632,"We were in Canada hunting geese the fall following 9/11. VERY thorough search coming home, but what impressed me was the businesslike attitude without the ""police state"" BS. After a thorough search, and everybody was getting it, and understandably so, the BP agent handed us our passports, thanked us for our patience, shook hands with each of us and, said sincerely, "" Welcome home, gentlemen."" Given the state of the world at the time, that was a very thoughtful and polite gesture that made me very proud and glad to live where I do. That went a long way with us, and the memory of that one experince makes me considerably more tolerant of the process going forward."
