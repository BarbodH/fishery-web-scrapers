Had a great week with five of us catching over 1800 Walleye and a higher than normal amount of them above slot. First three days was cold and windy but fish still were biting good. The last two days the weather was great and the bite was as good as I have ever seen in 30 years on Lac Seul. We had two 29"" and several 28"" and caught several nice Blue Walleye. Wife got a 42"" Pike and my buddys wife had one at the boat for a long time that was huge but broke off. The last day we fished we noticed the Mayflies began hatching. Mike Kansas"

2969857,Mike Kansas,2014-07-06 17:52:00,1463,Yes Basil is still there and he put us on the fish. We love being with him and not only enjoying his lake knowledge but his company. The fish were spread out but he found the schools that produced one of our best weeks ever. Mike Kansas
