2946921,Eagle1,2014-06-28 21:31:00,28,"6/14/14 - 6/21/14:We couldn't wait to get back to Kapikik Lake since the fire took out the cabin in 2011. Wayne & Karla Clark put up a beautiful and very comfortable cabin this year, so our dreams were fulfilled of getting back to Kapikik. The fishing was absolutely fantastic. Our group of nine pulled in 6711 fish for the week. The first day of the trip I personally caught 210 and my son caught 207, for a total of 417 in our boat. I caught 1100 for the week, which is almost double what I normally catch.We used live minnows & leeches, crawlers, salted minnows, twister tails, Impulse plastics, and sometimes even bare jigs were catching them. Big northern for the week were; 43"", 42.5"", 42"", 41.5"", and 39"". Big walleyes were; 29"", 27.5"", 27"", 26.5"". Wayne & Karla run a great operation. My only complaint was that the nets were too small to bring in the northern. What a great problem to have! Overall, it was unbelievable fishing."

Sounds like you caught most of your fish jigging? Which is how we like to fish as well. Did you target those big Northern or catch them jigging for walleyes? I'd always heard there was big Northerns in JackPine L to the SE of Kapikik...did you make it down there? Looks like the Cat R. from Kapikik is not navigable down to Zionz due to all the falls, did you fish above the falls in the Cat R. much? How deep was the deepest part of that lake? Deep enough to catch any Lake Trout or no? Cant wait to post my own trip report and I hope it sounds a lot like yours!"
2947537,Eagle1,2014-06-29 06:56:00,28,"Yes, we were primarily jigging for most of the week. All of the big northerns, except one, were caught while jigging with 8lb test. We had plenty of ""snap offs"" during the week also, which means that the big northern came in and engulffed our jigs. Kapikik is a fairly large lake, but not very deep, so there is not any lake trout in there. We caught primarily walleye, northern, and a few sauger. We usually catch big northern at the south end of Jack Pine, but not this year. We did catch plenty of walleye down there though.You're correct that you cannot get down to Zionz Lake due to a waterfall, but one of our group did go down the south rapids to the river system that takes you to Zionz. He did quite well down there. I'm adventurous, but I wasn't up for taking an 8hp boat up those rapids...though it worked quite well for him."
2947921,kona77,2014-06-29 09:01:00,236,Great Report..I remember meeting your group when we came off the plane this year from our trip to Antenna.. Our group is also from Wisconsin. I agree with your comments about Wayne/Karla..Our group has been real happy with their service and our trips the last two years to Grace and Antenna lakes have met or exceeded our expectations. Looks like Kapikik is another lake we will need to explore in the future.
2960810,wallypod,2014-07-02 20:25:00,21,"Fantastic report! What a great week of fishing. Joined a group that fished Kap about 10 years ago and never missed a year until the fire. We'll be back next year. Glad to hear the 8HP's made it back up the outlet, I would have bet against it. I agree Wayne and Karla are the best. Fished Kam (Kamungishkamo) with them this year and they are tops in every way from flights to cabins to gear."
2961730,Eagle1,2014-07-03 07:44:00,28,"WallyPod,How was the fishing on Kam? That might be a lake that I'd like to try in the future."
2962298,wallypod,2014-07-03 10:09:00,21,"This was our first year there, found a couple of spots with walleyes stacked up and had two good mornings of fish/minute action. Spent time checking out the 6 points of this star shaped lake with good success in the larger bays. Most of the north half of the lake is 10' deep and we had good fishing around the slightly deeper holes. South half is deeper with great fishing not far from the cabin. Never got into the big fish, quite a few 30 to 35"" Northerns and 19 to 23"" eyes. The group ahead of us are regulars and caught 40"" / 25"", claim there are even bigger northerns (i believe them) Overall a great lake with a terrific cabin (2 years new) and the best outhouses I have ever seen. I think this lake has a lot to offer and I hope to go back some day."
