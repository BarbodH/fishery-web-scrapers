1068983,wolverine fan,2008-12-17 12:27:00,71,I want to take my 13 yr old on a fishing trip to canada. I have been to minaki and roughrock quite a few times and loved it. I was looking at the Vermillion bay area or Eagle lake area for this year. My son has rarely fished so i was thinking norhtern fishing quite a bit so he could learn etc. Any help appreciated.

I bring my boys 11 and 7, and they put the hammer down on them. There are alot of big fish in the lake, but if you want numbers just put on a spinnerbait and hit the bays/shorlines and I guarantee 100 fish days on the small ones....easily. Whichever place you decide its just great to see another kid introduced to the sport."

They are wonderful people and offer reduced rates and plans for families.We are going there in August of 2009. The camp and environment provides the full experience. This is boat and portage in camp. They Have access to 15 lakes and the only camp on these lakes. Wildlife is outstanding i.e. Moose, Eagles, Beaver, Ect. The lakes are mostly Walleye and Northern and they will mark maps and give tips if requested. This is a river system with tea colored water so fishing is good all season long. It is truly an adventure and we always catch fish. My youngest is 13 years old and has been up north (9) times. He has been to this camp (7) times and tries to Drive the boat from the front. He knows too many spots. lol We have fished there the months of May, June, July and August. Catch fish all months, of course have to adjust to the time of year. Below is the website link and have a great time wherever you go up north with your son. You are building memories of a lifetime.Thank you,Larry Macwww.ghostriverlodges.com"
