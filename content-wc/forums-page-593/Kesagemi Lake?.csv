I caught my biggest ever there, 48.5"". I have never caught less than 20 walleye each day with the most being 80 or so. We only fish walleye in the morning and then pike fish after lunch. The lake does get fairly rough often. But we have never had a problem getting anywhere. To me the only real draw back is that the best pike fishing is way at the north end of the lake and it is often a wet ride to get there."
1068269,pike50plus,2008-12-12 20:39:00,584,Anyone fish there recntly? How is it?
1068330,Guest,2008-12-13 07:02:00,0,"I was there about 14 years ago. It was good. Very good numbers of pike. We did get a few over 40"", but most were 32-38"". The lodging is very good, comfoortable. You'll fish out of freighter canoes. The walleye action is very good too, just small sized fish. Overall it was a very good experience, If you are looking for GIANT pike, save the money and go to Alaska. We were there this past June with Midnight Sun Trophy Pike Adventures. Just a phenomenal trip. Our group of 6 had over 425 pike most 34-44"" with 15 over 45"", the largest was 49 1/2"". Also caught Sheefish. Outstanding scenery and accomadations, staying on a custom houseboat. Give it a try. It is lifetime trip!"

1068541,pike50plus,2008-12-14 18:26:00,584,"I have fished some in manitoba, last year Campbell lake and we did very good, 2 47""'s and 17 total over 41 with 4 guys"
1068890,Northern Manitoban,2008-12-16 20:50:00,195,"That is a fly in lake, 2 47's good size and 17 over 41 thats decent fishing, how long one week trip? Manitoba has amazing fishing, and ice fishing is in full swing now, just waiting for the -40 weather to pass so I can get out Xtreme Sportfishing"
1068969,Guest,2008-12-17 11:09:00,0,"We fished Kesagami 5 years ago.Kesagami Lake Lodge is a first class operation all the way.The cabins,equipment,food and guides were all excellent.The lake itself is a very large,wide open and fairly shallow body of water( 9'-10' avg. )with extensive cabbage weedbeds.The boats are 22 ft. frieghter canoes ,more like a extra long jon boat,but very stable & comfortable.Fishing--The week we were there Northern fishing was very good but sporatic.You would pull up on a spot catch a dozen or so then they would shut down.We sometimes went an hour or more with no action ,then Bang!,like hitting a switch we would hammer 10 - 20 pike in 30 minutes.This was the pattern thru out the week.Our group had a total of 19 pike over 40"" with one 43.5""and high numbers of mid 30"" range fish. Large bass-type spinnerbaits ,#5 Mepps and daredevles all took fish.There's plenty of Walleye in Kesagami as well although we did'nt spend alot of time on them in our boat.The guides have some great walleye spots where you'll catch loads of fish.Being a open lake the wind & weather play major roles on fishing success,but here again the guides can usually find some action. Kesagami Lodge aint cheap--$2,200 - 3,000 per person,per week but if your after a first class trip in a remote location this could be it. Good Luck."
1069208,pike50plus,2008-12-18 19:45:00,584,At least it's a one day drive from Cleveland without a flight cost?
1069320,phishfearme,2008-12-19 14:57:00,1242,"let me give a little different perspective on this lake. our group fished kesagami for a week portaging in everyday from partridge lake - the guy who runs partridge has a boat cache LUP on the western shore of kesagami - the lodge is on the eastern shore. first, we had a terrible weather week including being snowed in at cochrane the first day (july 1) and then had 4 straight days of storms and strong west winds. kesagami - like most all james bay basin lakes is very shallow (4-6 ft in most places) and featureless (flat bottom practically no structure). these storms really stired up the water and made it extreemly muddy so besides fighting hugh waves we were also fighting the poor visibilty - as such, fishing was not very good although we did get a half dozen 40""+ pike and one 28inch walleye. the average size of the walleye though was dissappointing - maybe 15-16inches. you also need to recognize that all of the structered areas are marked with bouys and are hit constantly by freighter canoe after freighter canoe every day all season. we talked with a few people in the canoes and they're weren't doing any good also. i believe guides used to be included in the package and required but not sure now as they advertise a daily rate for guides. to summarize, 1 - this shallow lake can get seriously muddy during storms and seriously impact pike fishing, 2 - DON""T expect the structure fishing that is the norm is schield lakes like in NW ontario, 3 - winds can seriously restrict where you can fish. the surrounding land is flat and wind breaks/islands are few and far between 4 - better expect to spend in the $2500 - $3000USD range for a week. tips, guide fees and booze can really add up. otherwise, other groups i've talked with had an enjoyable trip but if you're used to structure fishing you'll totally have to change your ways. phish"
1069452,Guest,2008-12-20 16:23:00,0,We were just lucky and hit some stable weather the week we were there.It was the third week of July and except for a few light showers and one windy afternoon the weather held up.Temps ran from the low 50's - up to about 70.But Phish is right on those windy days it can get tuff as the lake murks up and fishing can shut down.
