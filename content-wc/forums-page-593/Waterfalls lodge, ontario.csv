I have a friend who look up the site and was impress with the camp and fishing, show the 2007-08 catch, but nothing earlier shown. Has anyone been there recently, any report."

Fishing was simply not good. However, the ATV fishing option was outstanding. The smallmouth fishing was very good and the ride to the lake was fantastic. So in that regard it was good. Just poor fishing at the lodge itself"
