1060238,Juls,2008-10-13 17:36:00,13414,Thanks for sharing your vacation with us. Those were nice photos.It looks like it would have been a great time!Juls
1060254,dibling,2008-10-13 18:42:00,53,Nice Pics. I have not been to the great north for three years now. Looking forward to next year trying to make it back to an annual tradition. I also would like to say thanks for sharing.
1060290,SinOrSwim,2008-10-14 05:00:00,1528,"Would love to see more PowerClown. Do you have more of the inside of the cabin? And, how was fishing? We are looking at Root Bay for our trip next year. Thanks"
1060291,SinOrSwim,2008-10-14 05:09:00,1528,"Out of curiousity, why do you stay at the Best Western? If you fly with Slate Falls and are using SFO/Red Pine Lodge you would have the bunkhouse available? It would be much cheaper and probably nicer imo. Again, just curious. Hope you had a great trip."
1070456,PowerClown,2008-12-28 15:56:00,32,Sin the cabin is a work in progress....not as nice as north or south gull...but very liveable...it has a huge stove and battery refridge....the front room is prolly 20x25 plenty of room for 6 guys or more...the front deck is huge also and has plenty of room for all the junk a guy hauls up...the wood stove was awesome and kept the cabin toasty the whole time we were there....there is a tankless water heater that worked great..the boats were new alumarine that dident leak a drop which was nice..the motors were 15 merc 4 jokes and in my humble opinion are a step backwards as far as outboards that i have run in the past...big heavy and slow....every one of them made a popping noise at higher rpms..but they were very fuel efficient....the fishing was fantastic...we caught fish every place we tried...average was 20-22 in...3/8 jig with a white gulp minnow was excellent...dident need live bait at all...anyone looking for a top notch place to go and catch fish like crazy and come back to a comfortable cabin this is the place http://www.slatefallsoutposts.com
