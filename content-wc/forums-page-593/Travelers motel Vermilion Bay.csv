1064040,Boots,2008-11-11 09:20:00,19,I have trird to call Travelers Motel in Vermilion Bay to make reservations for July but get a message that the phone is no longer in service. Does anyone know if this place is out of business?
1064065,tackleman,2008-11-11 13:45:00,444,"We tried a few weeks ago to call them and had the same result, so when we went through Vermilion Bay we stopped. They told us that they were getting a new phone system and had the old one disconnected. You might have to try directory assistance for a new listing."
1064083,v-bay gord,2008-11-11 16:13:00,3168,"Right now the restaurant has been closed....which is where you used to call to make the reservations. The motel office is now in the motel part, which also has a hair dresser. I imagine once they get the phone thing sorted out you will be able to call there.....I will post the number if I find out what it is."
1065192,ALLEYES_,2008-11-20 08:07:00,49,I was in V-Bay deer hunting two weeks ago and stayed at the Northside Motel. Terri and Red took good care of us. You could try calling them for reservations. 807-227-5339
