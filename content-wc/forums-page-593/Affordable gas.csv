1064988,joeman79,2008-11-18 20:30:00,417,I own a gas station and never has the gas market flucuated like this. In the last 4-6 weeks there have been days when wholesale gas would drop 10-14 cents and the next day up 4-8 cents. We are a very low volume sation and believe me we are losing our ARS on fuel this year. My buyer has to be the most unlucky person in the world I swear. He says he has been listening to some top oil ecomomist and they think possibly the bottom may be 30 dollars a barrel oil. That would be a buck a gallon area. I'll believe when it happens. MORE MONEY FOR CANADIAN BEER!! And WISER
1065017,Backwater Eddy,2008-11-19 07:07:00,3871,Is the prices falling in Canada now too? How is it in comparison to our per gal since it started to fall?
1065456,Obabikon,2008-11-22 09:08:00,2370,"Minnow man, you live in Ocala? I just got back from there. Infact, I lived in Belleview a couple years ago."
1065481,oldblue2008,2008-11-22 16:31:00,313,"gas here in now around 85 to 89 cents a litre, so X 3.78 and x.75 for the US dollar equals about $2.44 -$2.60 a US gallon."
1065519,Skywagon,2008-11-23 07:40:00,1106,"Saw one station at $1.83 Thursday while in Duluth. In the big picture, the much lower gas prices are probably not as good for the two countries as it appears. Should be interesting to see the numbers of fisherman crossing the border this coming summer, even at lower gas prices and higher US dollar. Golden Eagle?"
1065527,Obabikon,2008-11-23 08:44:00,2370,"I think it will drastically help offset the passport problem. I think if tourism has a small increase or even remains the same, it will be a big win for resorts. It's way too early to predict now though. Mainly due to the fact if the stock market drops even more, it could make the money saved in gas look like pennies."
1065608,Guest,2008-11-23 19:26:00,0,"$1.52 in Des Moines, IA today."
1065632,Golden Eagle,2008-11-24 06:41:00,2642,"Skywagon, I'm looking at three trips in 2009. More and more guys are wanting to come along. Three cabins filled for walleye opener and two cabins needed for the second week. Interest is up. We don't watch CNN, ABC, NBC or CBS. They can have their recession. We'll not be participating."
1065650,Skywagon,2008-11-24 08:12:00,1106,"Golden Eagle, Good attitude, I should practice more of that. They always say ""when everybody else gets on the boat, it is time to get off"". I guess it's time to apply contrary opinion, buy low, sell high."
1067944,Minnow Man,2008-12-10 18:51:00,85,Hello Obabikon Just go back onto WC. I answered your post a while back but don't see my reply so will try again. We live just west of Ocala in Hernando. It's our winter hide away. Gassed up today in Hudson FL. gas was $1.61.09. With just under a quarter tank of fuel it cost me $12.50 to fill up my Geo Tracker that we use while here. News media is talking about a $1.00 gal. for gas. Wouldn't bet any money on that story. See you at the sport shows. Happy Holidays & may your reservation book be full for 2009.
1064060,joeman79,2008-11-11 13:09:00,417,no sales tax on gas there is i think 50 cents fed and state tax on all fuel in kansas
1064070,rebs,2008-11-11 14:33:00,7587,2.85 here in western new york yep we are still being gouged
1064121,Tonyo,2008-11-11 21:21:00,212,Lake Ozark Missouri - $ 1.85. already looking forward to the trip in the spring. hope the prices hold until than.
1064167,SSH,2008-11-12 09:56:00,526,"$1.83 per gallon in Blaine, Minnesota"
1064169,stinkycat,2008-11-12 09:59:00,2018,Still $2.13 in Vacation Land N. Central Minn. I have a feeling that somebody in Walker MN controls this whole area on fuel pricing and doing a bit of gouging.... this has been going on for many years.
1064192,waenut,2008-11-12 12:44:00,5,"Gas price here in Upper Michigan is $2.39, was as high as $4.29"
1064216,tackleman,2008-11-12 15:16:00,444,"Here in Red Lake, it was $1.099 a litre.that's $4.24 per US gallon or $4.95 per imperial gallon."
1064838,elmo,2008-11-17 19:45:00,43,$1.74 here in Central Missouri 100 miles west St.Louis. I 44 and US 63
1064945,2746,2008-11-18 16:45:00,3206,"On 11/11 I posted that gas was $1.72 in Des Moines and, in the middle of the day, jumped to $1.89. Well it's back to $1.72 today and I still don't know what caused that spike."
1064980,mswope13,2008-11-18 19:48:00,73,$1.67 in Colorado Springs! Just bought gas guzzling Ram. Timing's everything.
1063949,Minnow Man,2008-11-10 16:20:00,85,Just wanted to let my northern friends know I purchased gas today in Ocala Florida for $1.96.9 a gallon. Hopefully we'll see these prices for next fishing season.
1063950,rpieske,2008-11-10 16:40:00,1276,It was $1.89 here in St. Louis today. I hope the price keeps dropping as we transition to Marco Island for the winter.
1063951,1shooter,2008-11-10 16:52:00,1493,$1.93 in Minnesota.
1063958,stinkycat,2008-11-10 17:52:00,2018,Not all of Minnesota! Up north in central MN it is $2.13 and $1.99 in Fargo last Thursday. Keep it coming!!!
1063963,dibling,2008-11-10 18:08:00,53,$1.75 today - it is so nice to be under $50.00 for a fill up on my Full Size Ram 1500. How long will it last?
1063964,JAY221,2008-11-10 18:12:00,877,"1.77 today in Des Moines, Iowa! Later, Jay"
1063974,2746,2008-11-10 18:45:00,3206,"$1.72 in DesMoines this morning and this afternoon every station in town had gone to $1.89. Figure that one out! A 10% increase in 4 hours and somehow, magically, it's affected every station. They must have all been out raising the prices on their signs at the same time. How does that work anyway, that every station in any citiy all get the same information at exactly the same time?"
1064025,oldblue2008,2008-11-11 07:43:00,313,"Price in southern Sask. is at 96.9 a litre, or $3.66 a US gal. Lowest we have seen in a couple of years. Exciting compared to the 1/2 price fuel you guys are talking about!"
1064032,joeman79,2008-11-11 08:28:00,417,I own a Gas Station Convience Store in Ks and I bought 2 loads late last week and it cost me 2.06 I think my gas company is screwing me big time. But love the fact that it is nearly half price of a year ago. Maybe it will get cheap enough we can fly to Int'l Falls instead of drive. That'd be awesome.
1064036,Golden Eagle,2008-11-11 08:49:00,2642,"joeman79, how much sales tax per gallon at the pump?"
