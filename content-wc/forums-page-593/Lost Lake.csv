According to most posts it is a 45minutes-1 1/2 hour boat ride (With Rental Bat and 50H.P) to the big water and big fish spots. I have looked at aerial views and from what I can gather to get to the big water from Lost Island you have to run way to the east and then back to the north to the big water. Is that correct? Looks very confusing to me and looks as if I best have a depthfinder with GPS capabilities. Just wondering from anyone who has been there, how diffucult is it to navigate to the big water spots. There are no guides available when we get there, which is fine with me. But being able to follow one would help me find my way. Anyways just bored and thinkin about fishin. And help finding a place to buy a good map would be great also."
1065343,joeman79,2008-11-21 09:53:00,417,"ttt just wonder if it is like running through a maze to reach spots on the Big Water. Also any #'s for where to get a map of that section of the lake. Thanks, Joe"
1065426,Nimstug,2008-11-21 21:24:00,2605,"Joe,I don't know about Lost Island so I can't help you specifically. I had the experience of navigating through islands/channels on unfamiliar water (east end of Rainy) this past summer. Even with map and gps, I was nervous about having the choice of which side of an island to go on. It amazes me how fast the bottom can come up in some places. You have to be careful relying on your sonar when navigating at speed as the transducer is (usually) mounted on the transom. What you see on the screen is more than a boat length behind the front of the boat. Whenever I started to see the bottom start to rise above 10', I would come off plane and idle for awhile until I got familiar with the area. That may make that trip out to the main lake and back a little longer the first few times out and back. Make notes on your map as you travel, and have a compass out. Don't rely on your gps to tell you where you are. Do you know if the channel out to the main lake is marked with buoys? That helps some. I was confused for awhile when I saw three reds and one green. Make sure you have the camp owner explain which color bouy should be on what side of the boat when you are going out and coming back. Lastly, pack yourself an emergency kit with some fire starting materials-I have candles-, maybe ""space blankets"", something for light, and first aid items, in case something goes wrong. While I usually have some water in the boat, next year I am going to put a water filtration bottle in the boat for our Canada trip. Nimstug"

I would watch my gas as after all the running and fishing all day, you may be cutting it close on fuel. Definately don't to get lost and be cutting it close."
1066908,Guest,2008-12-03 07:03:00,0,"When going up the big lake towards the N.E. section, navigate the buoys as such. Stay LEFT of Green and RIGHT of Red until you get to Taylor island, then it changes. You still continue going up the lake, but after Taylor island you navigate RIGHT of green and LEFT of Red. When heading downstream from N.E. section, you navigate LEFT of Green and RIGHT of RED until Taylor island, then it's RIGHT of Green and LEFT of Red. Hope that helps."

Heading up to Sen Bay, or Windy/Taylor Islands can be a nice trip, good fishing, lots of sights. Best bet is to hire a guide, follow someone, or have a map card in your GPS, and be careful. On the other hand, don't think that you have to travel that far for quality fishing, regardless of the season. We caught tons of nice fish (and some of our biggest) within sight of the Lodge. Boat trips and exploring are great, just not necessary for great fishing. You don't want to be ""up the lake"" when one of the screamer fronts come through. Have a good one, Frank"
1067270,joeman79,2008-12-05 18:17:00,417,"Thanks Frank I am a bit worried about traveling that far but tips about fishing closer to island is what I wanted to hear. In looking at the Map- Deception Bay looks easy to find and from there to where you were talking about I do not know. I am looking at GPS of some kind, that takes a card. The August part is what scares me. When most of what I read and hear is big water deep humps in main lake. I am excited about going."
1067323,orchard frank,2008-12-06 09:30:00,1900,"Joeman, send me an email, I'd be glad to give you some suggestions for August fishing. August was actually my favorite time at Lost Island. Frank"
1067325,Guest,2008-12-06 09:33:00,0,".......As far as finding good quality lake maps, try fishingmap.com or trakmaps.com. I have purchased from both. You will be in the S.E. section. I really like the trak map maps, it has a Nautical chart on them. They are the most accurate map for "" The walleye capital of the world. "" The houseboat operations out of Hudson use them in the houseboats for navigation routes. We just follow those routes with the houseboats, because the houseboats have no depthfinders. Liked them so much, I bought all 4 sections and the one that has the entire lake on it. Hope this helps you."
