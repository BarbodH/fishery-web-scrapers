Red Lake has great walleye fishing. Enjoy your stay.I'd say you'd get at least 30% off for a second week at your fly in. More if it's a long flight."

1066600,REG,2008-11-30 18:39:00,445,Check out Snake Falls Camp on Pakwash about 20 minutes south of Red Lake. Good Walleye lake and Rob and Nancy run a great camp. You also have the option for fly-ins too.
1066603,walleye_freddie,2008-11-30 19:03:00,10,Why not stop at Lac Seul or Dogtooth on the way up. Excellent walleye fishing.
