1066308,evy TN,2008-11-28 09:13:00,15,I'm Wondering how long it takes to drive to Thompson from Winnipeg? Google says almost 16 hrs. and a web site for an outpost up there says about 7.5 hrs. Thats a huge difference.
1066340,Guest,2008-11-28 16:07:00,0,Streets and Tips says 473 miles and 9 hours and 30 mnutes travel time. Sounds like you will averaging about 55 miles per hour if you can sit that long. You still have to get out and stretch and fill up with fuel.
1066362,sptrix,2008-11-28 19:15:00,175,"I've made the trip multiple times. I would say that it's about 7.5 hours. It's an easy drive. The roads are pretty good. Not what I can say for Thompson to Lynn Lake, however."
1066397,evy TN,2008-11-29 06:21:00,15,Thanks for the info. I will be comming from Mpls. so thats another 7 hrs. Are ther any decent hotels maybe halfway between Winnipeg and Thompson? May just end flying from Winnipeg. Driving would add 2 days on each end of the trip. Thanks again.

1066578,AMPHIB206,2008-11-30 16:03:00,191,"Your best bet for a ""decent hotel"" would be to hole up in Winnipeg for the night. The hotel in St Martin is a 10 room, mom and pops style motel with outdoor access to your room. Motel 6 has everything up on these Hwy #6 motels. The one in Grand Rapids is on an indian reservation (not that there is anything wrong with that), but I'd be skeptical to park a nice rig outside of that hotel for a night. You may not get the best rest either. Thompson to Winnipeg is a polite 8 hour drive. The RCMP will be out around St, Martin/Gypsumville, Grand Rapids, and closer to Thompson. There is a 4 hour stretch of road between St Martin and Ponton (a one horse town-gas bar) where you will only pass through Grand Rapids which offers gas only at Pelican Narrows or at the ESSO (bus stop). Pelican is the cleaner of the two choices, but bring your own hand sanitizer. Once you hit the turnoff at Ponton, the scenery gets better (Stop at Pisew Falls for a breathtaking tourist photo opportunity-it's only 1/2 mile off Hwy #6- you won't be dissappointed; a good place to stretch your legs)"

1067508,Bill Krejca,2008-12-08 08:04:00,6107,"If you do a Walleye Central search on ""Ashern"", you'll find a little info on a motel at Ashern, where we stayed several times a few years ago. The Sharptail Motel is on the main highway and has a restaurant, which isn't too bad. Don't expect many fancy, or even quasi-fancy motels once you get north of Winnipeg. This motel has a place to park boats that allows some visibility during the night. Grand Rapids has a fairly OK reasonably priced restaurant on the left as you are leaving town. Again, don't expect many fancy establishments in this ""neck of the woods"" (literally). Bill Krejca"
