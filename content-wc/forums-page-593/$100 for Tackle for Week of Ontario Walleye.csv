Homemade salted minnows are a cheaper alternative and they do work quite well. We just use white 3"" berkley powerbait twisters and when things get slow switch to Gulp - but the Gulp will probly cost you more than real bait.If you find yourself baitless or want to add a little scent to your hook - some belly meat strips from a walleye are great but may be illegal where you are going.In the stained waters of Ontario that I have fished - many different lakes - the same things work over and over again. I use metallic jig heads (metallic gold or silver or even plain old lead works good too) or white or chartreuse jig heads. I don't even take anything besides white twisters any more. We use firetiger bombers (Long A) to cast with and a few hot and tots or rattle tots to troll with. Many places we go to we get plenty of walleyes on our big pike spoons, spinner baits etc to keep us happy.Planning and shopping is 1/3 of the fun so enjoy your preparation!!Most of these lakes can be hammered to death with just jigs but add in a few spoons, a few spinners and 4-5 stickbaits and I dont see how you can miss. One of my first trips the outfitter said all you will need is 1/4 oz jigs, white twister tails and a half dozen large Johnson Silver Minnows and you will be set. Of coarse I didn't believe him and took a tacklebox that weighed 28 pounds! Guess what I use on every trip, including that one? I have to add in that I have never been up north past mid july - so take my info for what it's worth! lobo1"
1070658,guidedfishing,2008-12-29 20:47:00,531,"Slug72, I use both regular and short shank, but truth be told, most of the time I just use the regular jigs with the longer shanks, if the bite is good with live bait, we usually switch over to soft plastic right away. When they are really pounding it I use just a touch of super glue to hold the soft plastic to the back of the jig head. We prefer soft plastic to gulp, its more durable, costs less, and has better action. Walleyes are primarily sight and movement feeders we have found no advantage to using gulp, some swear by it and if you have confidence in a bait then you will likely work it harder. It is hard to beat a lively minnow or leech carefully worked on a jig.. A spinner with a 30 to 40 in snell behind a bottom bouncer with a crawler is an effective way for covering some ground and find active fish. Sometime you don't even need the spinner, just a colored float and beds ahead of the crawler harness, or single hook for minnows. They ""bouncers""are easier to use then most think, just use enough weight to keep your line at less than a 45 degree angle to the water. When you get a bite just sweep your rod up and reel, no need to set the hook. In this case its better to have a little to much weight then not enough. The key is don't let the weight drag, just dip your rod often enough just to feel bottom with the bouncer then bring it up so you are just above. Keeps your bait in the near bottom zone, it also tells you when you transition from hard to soft. If there is a lot of submerged timber then it can be tough. All in all its hard to beat a jig, some of our most effective fishing has been with a light chop and a lighter jig under a slip bobber, the ultimate vertical jigging tool. When ever we use slip bobbers we are using live bait. Slip bobbers are not glamrous but they put a lot of fish in the boat.. especially if the bottom is to nasty to work a jig thru. good luck GF"
1070661,joeman79,2008-12-29 20:53:00,417,"I own a sporting goods store and I bring everything but the kitchen sink and usually end up using a dozen or so jigs and a dozen spinners and a dozen walking sinkers or bottom bouncers and a flat of worms. But by gosh if I ever need anything else I have it. We usually use 1/8 and 1/4 oz jigs a half of twister tail or whole one and a half a crawler. Easy and fun and CHEAP. White is always good good color seems, but cht and pink are great too. This past June the guys did real well in shallow water on a lindy rig with a small floating jig. Good Luck and have a great time"
1070678,Guest,2008-12-30 00:01:00,0,"The owners of Peffleys will point you in the right direction, and also set you up with what's working. You will be able to catch a ton of walleyes within 1 to 2 minutes from Peffleys. That time of year there will still be fish using the cabbage weeds, especially the deeper edges, but will also be using the reefs and rock edges out in the main lake. You will have alot of success if you...listen to the resort owner, he'll get you hooked up. Also, pay attention to 1)this message board, there will be frequent posts this summer from myself and others about the bite, 2)Peffleys website gives weekly updates, 3)Jim and Julies also gives a weekly update with pics. Bottom line, have 1/4, 3/8, and 1/2 oz jigs with regular barbed collar hooks, buy minnows from camp because trust me, Wabaskang walleyes do not like plastics unless they are in the weeds, and bring a flat of crawlers to pull around the weededges with spinners. Also the smallmouths will go nuts for the crawlers off the Peffley's docks. Good luck, wish it was summer already."
1070690,Tonyo,2008-12-30 06:32:00,212,"Just my 2 cents. We have been fishing in Canada for 10 years or so. The first trip I bought all kinds of lures, spinners, etc, etc. What I buy now can fit in a coffee cup for the week. A few jigs of various colors and red #4 hooks. We tie our own snell, consisting of a a slip sinker, swivel, 3 or so foot snell and a red hook. Crazy simple and very inexpensive. Keep things simple and as mentioned before listen to the owners and you will catch tons of fish and have a trip to remember for a lifetime. TonyO"
1070706,doubleheader,2008-12-30 08:54:00,2652,Is it me or does that knot look wrong in the 2nd illustration. I've been snelling quite awhile but that's not how I tie them.
1070753,lobo1,2008-12-30 15:00:00,734,"Right on Tonyo - like I said - we used to buy and take the kitchen sink and now I might buy a handful of jigs or some hooks or maybe nothing at all. I do take some goofy stuff called ""nitro grease"" now days that I never took years ago and seems to get the fish going when they slow down - it's a cheap way to impart some serious scent when the fish get spooky or lazy - no bait where we go."
1070791,Fishin Fun,2008-12-30 19:38:00,218,"We've always used Lindy rigs, Little Joe Spinners, and lead head jigs. The one color that worked for us a few times is white along with the usual yellows, oranges, etc. We've also used blood red hooks on our spinner rigs. I have a tackle box full of Walleye equipment, but only use about 1/10 of it."
1070830,Guest,2008-12-31 07:51:00,0,"Jigs, spinners and slips are what we use the most. Haven't been to Wabbie in a couple of years, but every night we went out to the ""Hotel"" with a couple dozen minnows, 4lb. test mono on light reels/rods and our slip bobbers and had a grand old time. Anchor right at the edge of the reeds,(4-6'at reeds edge) set your slip around 10-12 feet and fish the channel side. We fished 3 out of the boat and at least 3x each evening we would have triples on. As the sun goes down and you start hearing splashing behind you in the reeds, cast back a floating rapala and slowly work in back to the boat for some great smallie action. Picked up a 18"", 21"" and 17"" on consecutive cast one evening as I watched a glorious Canadian sunset. Wishing for June! Craig"
1070880,AllenW,2008-12-31 12:52:00,11482,"Never fished in Aug up there, but Sept its almost exclsively jigs, 1/2oz and 30-40 ft of water, I'd bet they might be a little shallower in Aug, but gear the jig to wind conditions.To a 2 or 3 pound walleye a 1/2oz jig is not to big, plus you get better control than using the lighter weights in deeper water.Another tip I found years back, don't drag the jigs like you do in southern lakes, you'll spend most your trip unsnagging someone.Bounce the jig off the bottom keeping it a few inches off, no snags, still get fish...imhoI cast my own jigs because I like a longer shank on the hook, helps with the bite offs, we've had our best luck tipping with minnows, in the mouth, out the gill and though the back, thats why the longer shank.Have fun and they do sell tackle up there if ya run out..Al"
1070849,Larry Mac,2008-12-31 09:38:00,530,"Hi Slug72, I strongly agree with lobo1 and Tonyo. Walleye is our targeted species of choice and we have fished several different Canadian Shield Lakes over the years. We have been fortunate enough to be successful fishing walleye. Many times we have Children and first time Canadian fisherman with us and must keep them busy. We are jig fisherman; we keep it extremely simple and do not even bring a tackle box in the boat (1 small plastic Plano tray). The key is locating the fish. This is where the lodge owners along with the shared experience of the fisherman on this site are invaluable. Have a great time and keep us posted. Happy New Year to AllThank you,Larry Mac"
1070603,slug72,2008-12-29 16:00:00,34,"I'm headed to Wabaskang with my two sons in August. I have enough smallmouth and pike gear to fill a boat but I am not that stocked on walleye gear as I haven't fished for them much. Money is a little tight this year. So, I am trying to put together a budget tackle shopping list. What would you buy and how much of it would you buy if you only have $100 to $200 to spend (not including the livebait)? The camp owner has been very helpful with tackle selections but even just trying to figuring out how many spinner rigs to take has been tough. Chris"
1070611,lobo1,2008-12-29 16:30:00,734,"for 25 bucks you could buy enough equipment to make spinner rigs to last for many years!! buy some quick change clevises and an assortment of blades including hammered silver, hammered gold, fire tiger, chartrreuse and white for sure - sizes 3 and 4 should be good but throw in some 2's just in case you get sluggish fish that want smaller. Gather up some beads and hooks and whatever weights you like to use, a spool of line and some small barrel swivels.... spend the winter learning to tie them up good and take about 20-30 with you pretied and when the fish dictate what they like - tie more to match - takes about 5 mins top to maqke them - even in high seas. lobo1"
1070613,guidedfishing,2008-12-29 16:41:00,531,"Lobo is right on throw in a few bottom bouncers around 2 oz to go with those spining rigs, and a small assortment of 1/8 to 1/4 ounce jigs in orange, gold, and chartreuse. Use your spining rigs and bottom bouncers to find them then pound'en with the jig's. I'd also pick up some slip bobbers for the weed edges. You'll have money left over to spend on live bait, or some soft plastic for your jigs. good luck GF"
1070624,Obabikon,2008-12-29 17:31:00,2370,"You shouldn't need nearly that much money for three walleye fishermen. I would personally just buy a bunch of 1/4 oz jigs. On Lake of the Woods in August, for the most part, that's all the guides use. (Tipped with a minnow)... Spinners are tough, because you're usually dragging rocky areas or reefs... they get hung up more than a simple jig and minnow. Just my $.02 If it's rough, or the fish happen to be 25 feet or deeper... switch to a 1/2 oz."
1070627,tackleman,2008-12-29 17:38:00,444,"If you are looking at tying your own spinners, it is pretty easy once you get the hang of the knot on the hook, I would recommend using a 2/0 hook. I tie several hundred a year for sale in Red Lake and unless you like to make lindy rigs with the #4 hook a 2/0 hook is just about right for minnows. I also use #4 indiana spinners and 4mm beads. along with a #2 clevis.If you want to have the versatility of few hooks tied and optional coloured blades you should get the white interchangeable clevis. they cost a little more but do give a readily available colour change feature.buy some jigs too, 1/2, 1/4, 3/8 ounce are good. lots of guys use 1/16 and lighter but when the wind blows it is nearly impossible to get them to the bottom. I use pink, white, chartreuse, purple, blue and 2 tone colours.if you aren't used to using bottom bouncers, you should get the inline trolling sinkers. I use 3/4 ounce mainly"
1070630,Guest,2008-12-29 17:48:00,0,"Chris, Depending on the time in August you will be there...I'd use spinner rigs with crawlers the 1st two weeks of Aug, and I'd switch to plain white or chartreuse 1/4 or 3/8 jig tipped with minnow during the last 2 weeks of the month. Which week will you be there? I'll be there the last 2 staying at Jim and Julies. Anything I can help just let me know...Mike"
1070634,lobo1,2008-12-29 18:49:00,734,I have never used spinners on any of my Canadian excursions - (all jigs) - but since he asked about spinners.......... that is how I responded. We use spinners quite a bit here in Michigan and tie up what the fish call for - on demand - while in the boat most times. lobo1
1070642,Guest,2008-12-29 19:33:00,0,"The last few times in canada, I used 1/8, 1/4 and 3/8 plain lead head jigs with yellow 3 to 4 inch twisters. I would try gulp. And definately tie up some spinners. Theres a decent web site that shows how to do it. http://dns.advnet.net/mkg/harness/Article/HowTo.html. I remember checking this out many moons ago."

1070646,slug72,2008-12-29 19:37:00,34,Thanks for the input. I am open to using anything. I just mentioned spinners because they were something recommended to me. We'll be up in the first 2 weeks from 8/8 to 8/15. We'll be staying at Peffleys. How specific do you guys get with jigs? I was planning on just buying standard type jigs like that you would normally use with twisters. Should I also be getting some short-shank jigs for livebait? Chris
