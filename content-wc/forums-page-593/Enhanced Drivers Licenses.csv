Talked to the Iowa drivers license office and they said they are not even close to getting them out yet.Also it is my understanding that children under 18, will need to only have a birth certificate to enter the states by land.Trying to get ready for a possible Canada family fishing trip this summer. But if we all ( 6 ) need a passport, may have to look at Minnesota."

1068808,Family fisherman,2008-12-16 11:33:00,49,"Thanks guys, Have been looking at these sites for info.http://www.dhs.gov/xtrvlsec/crossing...575704846.shtmhttp://travel.state.gov/travel/cbpmc/cbpmc_2223.htmlI will need to renew my drivers licenses this June anyway, so i thought that the enhanced license would be the way to go. The person at the license office said that these license will also be used to gain access to federal buildings and the feds cannot decide what all info they want on them. So they are waiting on the government to give them directions From reading these sites it is my understanding that kids under 16 will still just need a birth certificate.One thing i haven't seen yet is how long a passport card will last. Is it the same as a passport?I have been to Canada with my family a number of times and that is something that they always talk about. The kids always ask, Are we going this year?With all these new laws and regulations with added costs it is getting harder and harder to save up for our vacations. If it gets to the point that we no longer can afford it, we will miss it greatly!!!"
1068822,Catman59,2008-12-16 12:44:00,345,"Because we still go to Canada as a family , we all needed passports. We just spaced them out every couple of months . Its a lot easier spending $45 - 5 different times over the year than coming up with $225 all at once. Just another way to spread out the expenses."
