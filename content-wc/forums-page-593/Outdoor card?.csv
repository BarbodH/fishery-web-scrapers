1066991,Guest,2008-12-03 16:11:00,0,"I thought the boating exam thing was discussed on here earlier, and it's not a requirement for tourists, unless you stay a certain (long) period of time. Am I wrong or has something changed?"
1067001,Nimstug,2008-12-03 17:49:00,2605,"Mohl,You are correct.https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...t=boating+examIn short, if you are meet the requirements of your home state, you are legal in Canada.Nimstug"
1067147,Guest,2008-12-04 20:00:00,0,I googled the boater card since I not heard about this new requirement. It will apply to us residents as of Sept 09 but non-residents are exempt for 45 consecutive days. So unless you are here for a long time (more than one trip would not be consecutive days) it sounds like you're off the hook.
1067356,yarcraft91,2008-12-06 14:36:00,11487,It looks like the hunt-fish cards only apply to Ontario province.
1067528,JDP,2008-12-08 09:56:00,1457,"I called the Outdoor Card Centre today. The gentleman that answered the phone was very helpful. He said, that the final details of how things will work have not been communicated to the Outdoor Card Centre. However he did say, this is what he expects to happen: For 2009 that non-residents would buy the their fishing license ""just as in past years"". At that time a form/application would be filled out for an Outdoors card. A $9 fee for the 3 year card will be collected. Applicants then will eventually receive an Outdoors Card in the mail. For 2010 Non-Resident Outdoors card holders (now possessing the required unique ID numbers) then would be able to order Fishing Licenses via the Internet. JDP"

1066317,stevensinks,2008-11-28 11:20:00,330,What is a Fish/Hunt card?
1066329,Nimstug,2008-11-28 12:45:00,2605,I think the fishing/hunting card applies to Ontario or Canadian citizens. I came across a refererence to the card when I ordered our fishing licenses by mail this past summer. We did not have to get a card. Check with your camp to be sure.http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business...ge/244610.htmlNimstug
1066339,Guest,2008-11-28 15:42:00,0,"You do now. We just found out by mail a few days ago. Reason given - ""These changes will result in the Ministry's ability to capture client information for our entire client group including residents, Canadian residents and Non-Canadian residents."" It costs $9 for 3 yrs. Yes it does seem like another gov't rip-off. They want to know but you're paying. And they didn't bother giving the outfitters a heads up til 1 1/2 months before implementation."
1066345,Nimstug,2008-11-28 16:32:00,2605,"Well then, I stand corrected. Nimstug"
1066393,Glenman12,2008-11-29 05:48:00,762,"So the bottom line is, besides a passort to get back into the US we will need these new cards when we enter Canada next year?"
1066409,retire55,2008-11-29 08:59:00,1029,"The following text is from http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business...ge/260308.html The Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) is working on a project to improve the fishing and hunting licensing system. Once these improvements are complete, anglers and hunters will be able to purchase Ontario fishing and hunting licences from home, using the Internet or the automated toll-free phone system. As part of this project, MNR will also be developing an automated licensing system for licence issuers to improve service to anglers and hunters. The automated system will mean that all anglers and hunters will need a unique identification number. That is why MNR will be extending the requirement to have an Outdoors Card to non-resident anglers and hunters, effective January 1, 2009. The Outdoors Card will be required to purchase an Ontario fishing or hunting licence, except for a one-day fishing licence. ______________________ Information about Ontario fishing licence options for non Canadian residents in 2009 is available - seehttp://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business...02_165336.html ______________________ More information about the Outdoors Card is available from the Outdoors Card Centre (toll free) at 1-800-387-7011 from anywhere in North America. The hours of operation of the Outdoors Card Centre are Monday to Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time). The Outdoors Card website is http://outdoorscard.mnr.gov.on.ca/"
1066918,Guest,2008-12-03 07:58:00,0,With the upcoming law in September of 09 requiring a boating certificate...has anyone taken the online training and if you have what was the price? I've talked to a couple guys that started taking it and the price never appeared then at the end it asked for a credit card number but still didn't say how much it cost so they stopped taking it. Anyone have any info on this?
1066936,Guest,2008-12-03 09:41:00,0,"The above issues are part of the reason that yesterday I booked the family fishing trip on ths US side of Rainy Lake for next year. Won't need passports, won't need an outdoor card, won't need to do a boating exam."
1066944,Bill Krejca,2008-12-03 10:22:00,6107,"Re: Boating cert and outdoor card. It seems to me that the All-Canada Show could help alleviate some of the frustration and misunderstanding of these items by having a booth to explain how we will(?) be affected by these new requirements, if that's what they are.
