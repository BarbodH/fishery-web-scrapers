I anticipate we'll be there between 5 and 7p on Friday evening. Is it generally better to cross Friday evening or very early Saturday morning (prior to 6A)? We'll be crossing at International Falls. Thanks, Chris"

1070447,Guest,2008-12-28 14:00:00,0,We go to Wine Lake which is a boat in camp across Wabaskang. We always cross on Friday and then stay in Dryden. Dryden is about a 2 hour drive from the border. Dryden has a few hotels and dining places and it is a nice relaxing drive the next morning. It is only a little over a hour to Wabaskang from there. Less traffic on Friday going across we have found. We cross however at 6 or 7 in the morning and spend a whole day in Dryden to relax and get ready for the trip in. Much more enjoyable and get a head start on the canadian beer. Scott

We're always apprehensive about going up the 502 aka ""The Tire Slayer"" at night. However the idea of staying in a hotel on the other side is a good idea... Don't risk lines in the morning."

As mentioned, we are always making sure we are in Dryden before night fall. We don't want to have to share the road with a moose or have troubles on 502 at night. We stay at the Holiday Inn Express in Dryden. Very clean and comfortable with lots of room for our trucks and trailers."
