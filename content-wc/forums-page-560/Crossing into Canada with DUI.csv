1131058,Denver-Cheese,2009-08-24 08:30:00,1,I've heard many different sides to crossing @ I Falls with a DUI. Going up with the boys in a couple of weeks. One of us has a DUI from 24 years ago. He has doc's regarding sentencing/'payment to society'/etc. He also is starting to get his 'rehab' permit for next year. Some friends of his were denied entry due to a 20 year DUI. It seems like it is a crap shoot as to if people get in or not. What have you guys seen?

1131266,BB3,2009-08-24 20:03:00,48,"My brother inlaw said yes to a DUI from 1978 when they asked. Immigration told us they go back 10 years, if it's older than that they said to say no if asked next time."
1131298,GNO,2009-08-24 21:22:00,153,"That's right, after 10 years from the date yourfines and sentencing was completed, not from the date you were charged."
1131406,J-Man,2009-08-25 10:51:00,191,"http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/conviction.aspSee section on deemed rehabilitation. If that is the only blemish on the record, then it will not be an issue. Enjoy your trip."

I got all of the documentation they required and I am now crimminally Rehabilitated in Canada atleast. the Canadians are Tied into NCIC (FBI) so they know every thing about criminal histories. When I crossed at the border I handed them my passport and Rehab paper And was headed north in about 20 minutes. Be prepared to start the process early and do everything early because they will send it back. For example when writing an address do not use St. for street,write street . Make sure not to abbreviate anything. The hardest thing I had to get was when my driver license reinstatement date. The problem with this is most states only have only 10 years records because that is all that is required for commerical drivers. Any way it took about 4 months to get everything in order and finally receive my letter."

If there has been more than one DUI, stand by to stand by. I have heard that lying about a DUI will get you sent back to the USA."
