The others there are No names and were not expected to do well. The USA team Crushed them bad. winning weight was 102 lbs. Next time you see them tell them congrats. On the big Win. LOL
1134288,Guest,2009-09-07 12:32:00,0,"So there were 53 anglers, and the USA won. How many of them were Canadian, 5 or less I think. Is that a even field? I didn't realize that this was another Can AM event???"
1134291,lund rebel,2009-09-07 12:52:00,138,and your point is???.
1134399,Guest,2009-09-07 20:23:00,0,Point is the poor showing and they are the best from each Division in Canada. Where were all the good guys when they cant break 27th place. And the top Dog Andrew K was 49th.USA is by far a better set of angler and that's my point. Thanks
