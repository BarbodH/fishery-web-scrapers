Saturday was better, had a good day, but only a couple in the slot. I caught more small fish than normal on both trips. The weather finally starting improving last week and looks good through this week, so hopfully you will have a nice week and the fishing will get back to a more normal pattern."

I know for a fact that he goes out to find spots for their guests. We stay at Mahkwa which is 15 miles west of where you're staying. Muskies have been scarce in the southwest part of Lac Seul. Most of the Muskie we've heard have been up at Chamberlan Narrows. We have been up at Lac Seul for 15 yrs and have not seen many. Good luck. I am up 09/10 through 9/18.Mike
