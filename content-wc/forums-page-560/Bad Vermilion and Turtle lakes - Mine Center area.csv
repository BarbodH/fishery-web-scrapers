Resort owner doesn't have one or know where to obtain one. How is navigation on either lake? particularly Turtle lake? I run a 20 ft. Lund with a big motor and obviously common sense prevails, however some insight would be greatly appreciated....Will be targeting lakers and big eyes and any general locals of sunken reefs would be appreciated. Especially if there are no decent maps available...Thanks in advance for ANY info. from anyone who has fished these lakes!"
