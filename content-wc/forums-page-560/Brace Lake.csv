I caught and released my personal best with a 43"" Pike on a firetiger Rapala. Also caught 38"" , 2-36"", 33"" and many more in the 27-30"" range. Most were trolling and a few were while jigging for walleye. The largest walleye was 25"" with many between 17-22"". This was my most productive trip to date. No live bait used on this trip, all Gulp Alive and Gulp products. I was very pleased with the results. The Hosts Kyle & Teri Polesky were fantastic hosts. They are knowledgeable and accommodating in all aspects of making sure your trip is successful. This camp is shaping up quite nicely in its second year with the new owners after sitting empty for a couple of years. Cabins were clean and comfortable. Boats & Motors were flawless. Beautiful ""Northern Lights"" show on the 19th. If any of you are looking for a new trip, I think you will be pleasently surprised as I was. I am already counting the days until I go back. Good luck to all in the coming year.Rob Weimer"
