We have a group of six, three boats and we are looking for a fish camp or cabins rather than a motel. A place that offers launching, wharfage and proximity to good water is our primary focus. Our trips are conducted after Labor Day. If anyone has suggestions, references or any other ideas we would appreciate hearing about them. While we would be planning a week's stay in 2010, we are also interested in taking a long weekend trip this year. Any information from local outfitters or lodges is welcomed. Thanks, again."
