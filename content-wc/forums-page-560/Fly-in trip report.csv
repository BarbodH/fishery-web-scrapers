Most fish were caught jigging, 1/4 or 3/8 oz. with plastic grub and a piece of crawler in 15' to 30' of water. Water temp was 61 to 63 degrees. Three walleye over 25"" and many from 21"" to 24"". Compared tp previous years when we have been there two weeks later, I'd say the fish count was down a little but we defintely caught more large fish."
