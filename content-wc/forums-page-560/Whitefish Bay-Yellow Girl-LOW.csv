Our group always makes the run up to Yellow Girl and Chisolm Island area for walleye. I just follow the group who has fished up there for years. The walleye fishing is usually good in Yellow Girl and beyond. However, I can't help but think we are driving by some good walleye water during the long drive to Yellow Girl.Has anyone fished a lot for walleye in the Whitefish Bay area. That basin of the lake is very deep, but I would sure think there are some resident walleyes in the bay or nearby.Any advice would be appreciated. Depths, tactics, etc.. Thanks."

1132197,Wall-i-Lama,2009-08-28 09:43:00,1524,"Stcriox, The creel surveys for LOTW for 2006 show about 45% of all walleye caught in Canada LOTW are from the long bay, yellow girl and west section. About 5% come from whitefish bay section. This inverse is true in that 95% of the lake trout are caught in whitefish bay and zero percent in the YG and west section. This is based on an estimated 700,000 walleye catch. It's not to say that you can't catch nice walleye in the whitefish area, as we have caught a few nice ones in Regina bay, but we fish with the odds. And maybe it's cause we all read the creel survey and don't try hard enough for walleye in whitefish and trout in YG, but I don't want to play that game. Good luck this fall! In July, the walleye fishing was good and we hooked a few trout by three sisters."
