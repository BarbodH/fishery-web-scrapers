1131666,Jig Man,2009-08-26 08:56:00,95,Clouds in the trees is what nailed us. We were the second group out on saturday. The first groups plane had to land on a lake in mid flight. They waited 6 hours for it to clear. They ere almost forced to sleep on the plane. I guess it could have been worse for us. At least we got to spend the balance of saturday and all day sunday on ground with a cold blue in hand.

1132018,way2goofy,2009-08-27 14:22:00,22,"I believe rpieske when he said it's been the worst weather he's seen in 56 years. We saw the sun 2 days and it rained so hard on Thursday we didn't go out. Walleye fishing was good but I couldn't hold on the reefs north of Chisholm due to the strong winds. We have several favorite spots for walleye south of Sunset Channel that produced 18"" walleye so we were happy. We also went to Blueberry twice for crappie and had good luck there also. The slab crappies didn't seem as plentiful but we still got out share of them. I don't think there were as many boats on the water as last year and definitely not as many houseboats. The fish didn't seem to mind the weather - just us older guys with all our aches & pains that increase as you get older. It wasn't one of the better years weatherwise but I can't wait for next year. In all due respects to Canadian weather the states had lousey weather this year also. The NorthWest was flooded by rains and then a heat wave like they haven't seen in years. We've spent a week on Spider Lake outside Hayward, WI the 2nd week of July for the past 25 years. It's usually in the mid 80's to low 90's all week and we have fans running at night. The hottest day this year was in the low 70's and we had the heater running. Global Warming? Who Knows!"

1132436,new hips,2009-08-29 14:02:00,498,"Was up in Ganglers North Seal, week of July 11-18 surface temp was 48deg., the camp manager said there were still ice chunks on shore in a shaded area's on one of the portage lakes. Temps most of the week were good 65-70 degrees. One bad day 24hrs of high wind (30mph) and high of 42 degrees. Northern were still sunning in sand bays, lake trout were in 20ft or less.........Global warming???????????"
1132438,new hips,2009-08-29 14:04:00,498,"July 19-26th Red Lake May Fly's were hatching.....Wow fishing sucked big time, not even a decent Northern bite"
1132705,fishanytime,2009-08-30 23:14:00,63,I have fished on LOW about 30 days this summer. We had snow in the boat on the opener and it is unuasal if it doesn't rain for more than two days. I have a full cover for my pro V and used it most of the summer including August. Walleye fishing has been good to great depending on the day. I usually start in Long Bay and work west. Trout have been slow some days and great others in the Whitefish bay area. Northerns were pretty active in August. I wouldn't fish LOW without a full cover very long as the wind or rain make it miserable. Fishanytime
1131051,Jig Man,2009-08-24 07:58:00,95,"Just returned from a 7 day flyin trip that was reduced to 5 days due to weather. Was scheduled to fly in on Saturdat 8-15 and dis not get out until Monday due lingering fog. Boy do you miss those two extra days. No time to relax and get settled in due to the missing days. With that being said walleye fishing was good for never being on this lake before. Weather did not always cooperate with cold windy days. 3' whitecaps on the last full day. Ended up with 2-27"" a 26"" an numerous 20""+ walleyes. Did anyone else run into weather related problems?"
1131078,greenie,2009-08-24 09:10:00,87,"Grassy Narrows, ON; English River 8-14 - 8-20, 2009 Rained 60% of the time we camped on the island in our tents. Was great fishing. Luckily no severe storms, just showers. Rained either mornings or afternoons. Had only 2 campfires. Ate walleye dinner 3 times, steak and chicken other dinners. River rose at least 6-8"" while there."
1131084,Whopper,2009-08-24 09:27:00,340,Jig Man I had friends that were on the other end of your dilemma. They flew out of Armstrong and had to wait two extra days to get back
1131177,Larry Mac,2009-08-24 14:39:00,530,"Hi Jigman, Battled weather both in June and August. caught fish on both trips. Have a great yearThank you,Larry Mac"
1131185,Flip Silverlake,2009-08-24 14:53:00,645,Spent from June 13th to August 15th in Kenora and never had such bad weather. Rained just about everyother day and was quite cold. BUT it won't stop me from going back next summer!
1131221,onetimedave,2009-08-24 17:14:00,502,First week of June it rained or snowed every day we were at Kayedon. Air temps were only above water temps of 45/49 degrees one day. Water 3 to 4 feet high. Tough conditions.
1131277,rpieske,2009-08-24 20:44:00,1276,I live in Nestor Falls from mid May to Mid Sept. We've had 8 days that were sunny without rain. I even got snowed on twice. Worst year for weather I've had in 56 year of coming here. Mostly in the 60's or lower this whole summer. Oh well....there is always next year.
1131440,alanexpup,2009-08-25 12:54:00,278,HI. I am hoping that in the near future I too can talk about bad weather in canada alllllllll summer long. LOL alan
1131646,Mike Kansas,2009-08-26 07:46:00,1463,"Had rainy, cold days on both trips this year but caught lot's of nice eyes on both trips. This makes two years in a row of wet, cold weather but good fishing. Mike Kansas"
1131655,evy TN,2009-08-26 08:18:00,15,"I've been on the short end the last two fly-ins thatI've been on one for wind, one for clouds in the trees. I guess I'd better to be waiting at the basecamp then up at the outpost packed up sitting on the dock waiting for the plane."
