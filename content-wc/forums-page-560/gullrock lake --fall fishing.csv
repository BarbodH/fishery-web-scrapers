1132169,tackleman,2009-08-28 08:13:00,444,"this year has been really different, high water and cold temps, so what I would bring is a supply of jigs in different colours and sizes. I would also bring some spinners (little joes) in silver, gold, chartreuse.the water never hit its normal temperature and the fish are very scattered. the slower the presentation the better. take it from there.I don't normally fish for northerns so I'm afraid I cant help on that side of the fishery"
1132186,Moondog,2009-08-28 09:11:00,362,Is the water level going down any?
1132264,Guest,2009-08-28 15:08:00,0,"The only spinner that produced consistently for us was a combination of pink, blue and white. Probably had best luck with just a bare night-crawler rig (no beads, or spinners) on a lindy rig. The bottom bouncer set did not do very well for this year."
