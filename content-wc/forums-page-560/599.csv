1134396,slugger doug,2009-09-07 20:16:00,15,just got back from Savant lake area. I must have missed the warning on the road construction. They turned pavement from Ignace all the way to the English River to a rock road. My new trailer will need a new paint job. The rims on the edges are all chewed up. Left one day early from camping because we had a bear that kept coming around and would not leave. We left a half loaf of bread and pancake mix in cook tent which the bear came through the screen to get. Fishing made up for it. Will be talking about this trip for a long time!!!!!!!!Anyway I wanted to warn everyone of the road. They also oiled and chipped the road on up north. Lots of rocks in that area also.
