I have done alot of research on them and it appears to be the full Canadian Wilderness experience. I like the idea about providing staple food and also the location of the outposts. Which outpost are you staying at? Have a great trip.Thank you,Larry Mac"

Cabins so-so, at the time smaller boats and motors also. I believe Hartells owned the camp. You fly in on big plane into Sandy Lake and then float planes to camp. No reason for leaving them other it was getting kind of pricey. We started fishing Lac Seul....Hope this helps"
