We've been going to Gullrock and Lac Seul for 20 years and used several camps but have never run into it until this year. It was not communicated to us and is not in the web site so we missed a day of fishing Not a huge deal as it was raining on that Friday anyway but it left our group wondering how many camps did this and what the advantage would be? We would have had to leave work on Thursday to take advantage of the Friday check in and still used up all the next week. Just wondering what we were missing.
1132857,REG,2009-08-31 15:35:00,445,"Most of the drive-to camps I've ever checked with are Saturday to Saturday. Seems like it's been that way since the beginning of time. That doesn't mean that it couldn't be, but I would hope that any camp doing it differntly goes out of their way to communicate it to prospective customers. I would be hacked if I lost a day of fishing! I have run into some fly-in camps that go out on days other than Saturday - probably based on the number of cabins they run and the logistics of all the flights they have to make."
1132860,Larry Mac,2009-08-31 16:05:00,530,"Hi larrym, like Mr. Reg stated the majority of the camps we deal with offer Saturday to Saturday with the exception of some fly in camps that run the Friday to Friday. Some of our favorite camps will adjust the arrival and departure days if possible. The majority of the drive in Saturday to Saturday camps have a later check in i.e. 2:00PM to allow preparation time for the incoming party. One thing is for sure we have Never been surprised or misunderstood the start date or check in time. I feel bad this happened to your group. Every day in camp, good or bad, is very precious. I am very disappointed that something as important as your arrival date was not spelled out in detail by your outfitter. You are a very understanding man. Your outfitter should feel very fortunate to have you as a customer. Have a great year.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1132861,Steve of Madison,2009-08-31 16:06:00,230,"We use a Friday to Friday camp, Onaway, on LS. For me, I prefer it. The traffic along the way is never an issue, never a wait at the border, and to me is a much more relaxed trip. On the drive up 502 this year on friday I passed 1 truck otherwise I had the road to myself. Why are they a friday check in? You will have to ask Blair or Kathy, but with all of the repeat business they get it doesn't seem to be a problem. Our normal itinerary is to drive to Ft Frances on thursday and then have an easy trip into camp on friday. I have then started home on either thursday late PM or friday morning and driving as far as we want too. I will say this.....having the lake to yourself on Sat when everyone else is leaving or checking in can really make for a great day."
1132910,rockpt,2009-08-31 19:33:00,589,"I know this is unusual, but our camp allows check-in and out whenever the guest wants. Twice a year for ten years we've been arriving Friday evening and leaving Sunday morning. We get nine nights in camp and eight days of fishing. For a long time I went to a Sat.-Sat. camp and the week seemed to fly by. Too bad about your experience. I'm curious: did you confirm your reservation (including arrival and departure dates) before arriving? If you did and they waited until after you arrived to tell you that you had to leave Friday, they mislead you. And I agree with the other comments, they should have affirmatively told you check-out was Friday to avoid any misunderstanding."
1132935,2746,2009-08-31 20:56:00,3206,"They seem like good folks and it may have just been a miscommunication. They do not provide any of this type of information on their web site.....rates, packages check in times ect. They said it was provided it to me as an attachment to an e-mail confirming my stay but I never saw the attachment. Possibly I missed it or it did not get attached. Because I never even thought of a check in time being Friday I never pursued the point. My post was not so much to complain about the arrangements as to try and understand why a camp or clients would prefer Friday to Friday. It takes more days away from work and on our return trip Friday we experienced a longer border line than we usually do Friday night or Saturday morning. Just curious and a bit surprised."
1132940,bpetersen,2009-08-31 21:25:00,251,The camp I go on Lac Seul is Saturday at 7:00 am. to Friday till 9:00 am. and is well communicated.
1133215,Dacotah Eye,2009-09-01 18:11:00,2722,My camp just asks when I want to arrive and when I want to leave.
1133249,2746,2009-09-01 19:50:00,3206,"Rockpt and Decotah, would you mind sharing the names of your camps or just send me an e-mail. I'd really be interested in being able to pick my days."
1133256,rockpt,2009-09-01 20:04:00,589,You have a PM.
