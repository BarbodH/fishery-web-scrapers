1049113,Guest,2008-08-13 20:19:00,0,I have been fishing with an outfitter in Ear Falls Ontario for over 12 years. See the trip report: Antenna Lake Or call the Gawleys.... 807-222-2197 807-222-3333www.womanriverflyin.com or www.gawleyslittlebeaver.com
1049116,SinOrSwim,2008-08-13 20:30:00,1528,"My group has been doing a fly-in for quite awhile. This year is year 15 I believe. For the last 9 or 10 we've been with Slate Falls Outposts out of Sioux Lookout. I would HIGHLY recommend them. We had used a couple different outfitters prior to finding Verne and to be perfectly honest the other ones were nice but not even in the same ballpark.First, there are no weight limits. Some stuff may get flown in later but you do NOT pay extra. Still need to try to pack with weight in mind however.He has a bunkhouse where you stay the night before which is not only cheaper than a hotel, but much nicer imo. You don't have to share a bed with anyone, it has a pool table and an area to play cards. Flying - they are always on time weather permitting. We fly out on a Saturday morning and are literally fishing by 9 or 9:30. When you get picked up being on time is a HUGE factor. We were with an outfitter who said to be ready by 7am and then didn't show up until almost 10 am. That is a long time to sit and wait since everything you have is packed. Fishing is outstanding. He has catch and release EVERYTHING over 18"" (walleye). Can not bring any fish home (well. can bring 2 per person I believe). This may sound like a negative but when you have trouble catching fish small enough to eat some days you will not complain. Not only do we catch bigger fish but we catch a lot of themCabins are first rate. Solar power, indoor toilet and shower, frigs, freezer etc. Always clean and well maintained. Covered outdoor deck to cook in the rain. Dock walkways to the cabin lessening sand/dirt in the cabin. Boats and motors are always in top notch shape and we don't go until September.Slatefallsoutposts.com"

Hands down the best service, accomodations and fishing I've had."
1122257,Hayduke,2009-07-19 20:26:00,11,"I have been fishing this area since I was young, and have been fishing mostly Walleye. I have experience in both June and August, and have no preference. So far I would suggest Arctic Watershed Outpost from Nakina, www.awonakina.com and Gayle from Woman River Fly In Outposts Ear Falls www.womanriverflyin.com Good LuckTodd"
1122351,onetimedave,2009-07-20 09:43:00,502,"Look at www.awonakina.com Arctic Watershed Outposts are operater by Remi and Christine Moretton, residents of Nakina. We have used them 13 times with #14 nest year. Great operation all the way around. I can help with marked maps etc. if you need."

The new owners of Brace Lake, Kyle & Teri Polesky have certainly got my attention on how to treat people on a fishing vacation. Good cabins - Good accommadotions - Good equipment and grat attention to detail. They are only in their second year of operation, but totally understand what needs to be done and how to treat their guests. Give them a try and I guarantee you will not be dissappointed. bracelakeoutfitters.com e-mail me for pics and more info.[email protected]"

I found a cool website, www.canadaflyinfishingreview.com but their forum only has one post. I kind of wanted to ask somebody with experience a couple questions: When is the best time of year to fish northern ontario for walleye and pike? Anybody know a good outfitter for the Nakina ontario area? Thanks for helping a newbie"

575702,Guest,2008-07-02 09:02:00,0,"Flown out of Nakina 11 times with #12 this August. In the past we have gone in late May or early June. We have used Arctic Watershed Outposts (www.awonakina.com) since trip #1. Great people, fishing and camps. I can help with maps of many of their lakes marked where we caught fish. E-mail me for additional info [email protected].:rant:"
575726,Guest,2008-07-03 05:31:00,0,"I have gone to Esnagi Lake (near White River, about 2 hr north of Wawa) a couple of times, both times in July. Fishing was fantastic, and so was the camp/accomodations. Extremely well run camp. One nice thing about going in July was no black flies. This lake will even produce in August. go to www.northtoadventure.com and check them out. Would love to make it back there someday"
575727,Guest,2008-07-03 05:33:00,0,"whoops I goofed. White River is about 1 hr north of Wawa, not 2 (hit the wrong key)"
575739,scar,2008-07-03 12:32:00,196,"try this one. you wont be disapointed. only a 20 minute flight from red lake will get you on 100,00 acre trout lake. walleye, lake trout and northern fishing is spectacular and jim and tracy booi are wonderful hosts. it is a 5 star and a bit pricey though if thats what your looking for. all the comforts of home with quality personal service.www.boois.com scar"

1046866,Guest,2008-08-02 13:30:00,0,"Herman, We have used Timberidge Air & Outposts in Nakina for the past ten years. We normally go the third week in June. This year 8 of us caught over 1100 walleyes and just under 100 Northern during our 7 day trip. Timberidge is run by Corky and Brenda Sischo. They are great people and very accomodating. You can check out their operation at www.timberidgefishing.com They have outposts on 6 or 7 lakes and can accomodate groups up to about 12 on some of their lakes. Good fishing"
1046893,Richard B,2008-08-02 16:55:00,735,"My brothers, 2, took there families to Tip Top Lodge during the week of July 4th. They said the fishing was nothing short of phenomenal. They caught walleye, pike, and smallmouth at will. My youngest nephew told me that his arms hurt all week from catching all these huge fish. He is 11 and I just started laughing at him until he start showing me pictures of the fish he caught. Everyone also said that the staff and food were fantastic."
