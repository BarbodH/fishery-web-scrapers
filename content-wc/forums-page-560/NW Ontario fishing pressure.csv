1124966,Kevin R,2009-07-30 07:21:00,305,perrault lake has loads of boats on it this week. Counted 25 fishing even in the rain must be a holiday.
1133863,81Saluki,2009-09-04 13:59:00,97,"Just returned home from another trip to the Indian Lake Chain. Saw fewer boats on the water this trip than earlier this year ... only 6 boats during the busiest day. Holy Cow!!! The camps have to be hurting. Granted, this was before the Labor Day week, but still ... At least the fishing was good again."
1133940,archer66,2009-09-05 03:26:00,21,"My impression of Lac Suel is that it is busier than ever. I was there in the 1970's and didn't see a soul. The next time I was there was in 1989 and we saw one boat that wasn't staying at the same lodge as us the whole week. Was there in 2005 and saw a couple boats each day from other lodges and saw several around the Manitoba point area. This trip we saw boats EVERYWHERE we went around bay of islands, south bay, south inlet, McKenzie bay, Manitoba point. There were several times we actually had boats pull up next to us and fish the same piece of structure we were fishing. This happened in south inlet, in hungry narrows, at Manitoba point, and in south bay."
1133953,Batteryman09,2009-09-05 06:47:00,17,"archer 66 totally agree with you on Lac Suel being busier, I have been fishing the southeast section about 20 days a year since the early 90's. We used to say ""wow there is a boat"", because we would see very few. Now it is ""geez I can not believe how many boats we seen today"". Thank goodness it is a huge lake!Mike"
1133958,81Saluki,2009-09-05 07:15:00,97,"Perhaps the difference in boats seen on Lac Seul versus the Indian Lake Chain is the fishing? I know people who like Red Lake and Lac Seul because there are lots of big walleye. But their biggest complaint is that nearly all fish are in/over the slot and they can't catch many eaters. On the Indian Lake chain, we see the opposite ... lots of eaters but only an occasional lunker. Maybe people who used to fish the IL chain are heading further north for more big fish. Guess it depends on one's preference of 'quantity' versus 'quality'.For what it's worth, I prefer catching lots of eaters. Catching a lunker from time to time just makes the trip that much more thrilling and memorable. But that's just me ... I'm sure there are plenty of people who prefer the opposite."
1120886,Guest,2009-07-14 12:04:00,0,"I don't doubt that business has declined in some areas, but I am surprised that fishing lodges are doing poorly. When I was calling for reservations (Lac Seul), nearly every resort I called already was booked for most of the summer months. No one can say that my husband and I aren't supporting the economy... he is out of work and I pushed to go on the trip. I NEED to get away from work. Hasn' t really saved me any money... somehow he always convinces me that we need SOMETHING new for the trip... Sigh. Guess that's why he keep me....."
1121033,Pooch,2009-07-14 20:39:00,4619,"Ten years ago I was PO'd that an average pickup truck was $20,000 now a work truck is pushing well over $30,000. Shopping with my wife and was shocked at the price of food. Just the staples! I looked closely at buying a resort a few years ago and decided that it wasn't a very good investment let alone trying to earn a living from it. Sure glad now that I didn't. Our trip cost have nearly doubled in the past ten years. It's not the camp owners fault. Most all of us working stiffs are getting our shins kicked everyday. It's just life and it's the best offer I've had so far! Pooch"
1121127,ukats,2009-07-15 09:23:00,9,"The assault on corporate greed is having its affect as well, Corporations are scared to travel because of what it looks like to the general public because of the pressure by our government. Last week I got an offer to a camp I went to two years ago that was $3990 (high end, northwest territories). Because a coporate group cancelled all 24 slots for a week in August have to be filled, they were offering it for $2100. That really hurts as the camp employes around 23 people for the summer, it really affect everybody.Dave"
1122584,Kevin R,2009-07-21 07:05:00,305,Back in the 1970's & 1980' more people camped the roads were loaded with trailers & RV's now I see very few Campers & RV's. Some Resorts had more than 20 Campers & Rv's a week for most of the season. Now 1-2 or nobody. That is the biggest change I have seen in highway traffic in Canada.
1122753,Mohleye,2009-07-21 15:17:00,368,"As far as costs go, our camp's rates have stayed the same for at least the past three years. We had a couple extra guys who wanted to go this year, we kept the same # of vehicles and hotel rooms for the overnight on the way up (we took along a couple air matresses). Between splitting the rooms and the gas more ways, and gas costing over $1 less per gallon than last year, our per man cost this year was down considerably. We also had a couple extra fish meals and switched from steaks to burgers for our Friday night meal. I'm as concerned about the economy as anyone, but I can't complain about the cost of my Canadian trip."
1123096,Kevin R,2009-07-22 18:10:00,305,I have some friends that pay pay about $3000. for 4 days. I think the cost for that trip is to high but they went this year again.
1123108,Obabikon,2009-07-22 18:49:00,2370,"Pooch, While owning a camp is not the way to get rich... it is a great way to live a rich life. However, anyone thinking it's all fun, and the owners just sit in their cabins counting the money, is mistaken. At this point, I could never go back to another job... this is what I love! Anyhow, just my 2cents. Tough economies are tough on everyone. Nobody can be at their best all the time."
1123191,AllenW,2009-07-23 07:24:00,11482,"Just curious, does anybody have a idea on average age of todays tourist to Ontario/Canada for these kind of trips?Wondering if its on the older side if the war babies are getting close to retirement and with the economy being as poor as it is, if they are not spending or have, the disposable income they had a few years ago??I'm 61 and many of my friends are worried about retirement and finances so their not so likely to spend larger amounts of money on vacations.Al"
1123673,Kevin R,2009-07-24 19:55:00,305,I think things are better than some have posted. We had Dinner on Rainy Lake at La Place Rendez-vous they looked busy. Asked about rooms & they were booked full. I just finished the drive & saw many coming back on 502 & many behind me going to Dryden yeah I was the slowpoke. Checked into the Holiday Inn & they are full glad I booked a few days ago they were turning away people. Looking out my room window I see 4-trucks pulling boats.
1123848,Ogoki,2009-07-25 17:47:00,291,"Like I said on an earlier post, I think the guys still doing fly-in trips are well established in life . Many in the 45 to 65 year range . I know several who don't go now since they retired. I know some who are nearing retirement and have bought boats an now go up and rent a cabin for the week and split the cost with their friends . One group of four , two own the boats and the other two pay for the cabin . I know of two who use to fly-in a couple times a year and now they bought a small cabin on a lake and are also nearing retirement so they can go more often . The one thing constant is change and I think we are seeing many changes now . Maybe drive to lakes will see more pressure and fly-in lakes will not . I kow from my area very few are going to Ontario anymore . Guys wont to fish and enjoy the northwoods so they will find a way they can afford . Lord Willing,I will be back up in two weeks for two weeks of fishing and bear hunting ."
1119261,81Saluki,2009-07-08 02:07:00,97,"The economy appears to be having a huge impact on fishing up north. I returned last week from the Indian Lake chain near Vermillion Bay and noticed boat traffic was really down. Just a few years ago we would regularly see 2+ dozen boats on the water and often had people coming in to ""share"" our hole. Last year was lighter (due to high gas prices and weak US dollar) but this year it was almost like a ghost town on the water. The most boats we saw was 8 one day. Has anyone else noticed a significant reduction in the number of people on the water? Good for the fisheries. Good for road traffic and border crossing. But certainly can't be good for the camps!"
1119315,jswinter40,2009-07-08 09:07:00,127,we were up to lac seul the last week of June and saw the same thing. not as many houseboats going in and out and not nearly as many at the public access in Sioux Lookout. I am glad I have a job that still produces.
1119341,Mohleye,2009-07-08 10:53:00,368,"Times are pretty tough in NW Ontario. Not only is tourism way down, but I think the mill in Dryden is shut down and most logging operations have ceased. I'm trying to do my part to help by taking two trips this year!"
1119353,Ogoki,2009-07-08 11:26:00,291,"I fell in love with Northern Ontario when I was in my late teens . Decided to work REAL hard and build a house and PAY for it quickly. I was fortunate enough to have a GREAT Dad that helped build the house with me . NEVER had a bank loan on a vehicle either . I can now take my wife and go to Ontario twice a summer too. My friends are crying about all their bills and are now very envious of the way I did things . That being said I also noticed not near the traffic on the roads or at motels and resturants . Had a short conversation with a cashier at a resturant ( she was also the owner) and she said her business was way down . Not only tourism but the forestry and mills. The owner of the motel where we stayed one night said the very same . What bothers me too is that some outfitters have worked real hard giving customer service and providing top notch equipment and accomodations will feel the pinch also. I believe the outcome will be some with high debt will be forced to fold as I cannot see a quick change in our economy . I know of numerous men who use to go every summer and now that they are retired they cannot afford the trip. Talked to one guy at church and he said his retirement is just under $2000 a month so he cannot spend $1400 for a fly-in . He said the outfitters fee, his part of the gas and motel were about $1400. I don't see many young guys with a mortgage and young kids going either . My buddies now do a canoe trip in the Boundry Waters and don't fly-in with me . The positive part of this will be less fishing pressure on the lakes and maybe more fish if the lake food supply is good."
1119565,onetimedave,2009-07-09 07:43:00,502,"Noticed the same on our trip to Nakina. No lumber mills, mines, and fisherman means many of our favorite motels, restaurants, and outfitters will be gone. The outfitters surviving can not afford to purchase assets of down and out camps because of cash flow. If you can't go this year it is not to soon to make a reservation for 2010. You will get the choice lake and time along with helping the outfitters."
1119830,Glenman12,2009-07-09 21:27:00,762,the only difference I noticed on Cedar Lake in June was because one of the resorts has shut down..other than that it was business as usual
1120136,@Lunker,2009-07-11 07:11:00,835,"Just returned from a camp on LOTW. Business has been down a good 60%. We heard a report of one well known lodge on Eagle Lake that did not have a single guest this past week.We also had several lengthy discussions about current business vs past levels ie ""the heydey"". None of us believe business will return to levels of recent years."
1120152,fishman10,2009-07-11 08:11:00,226,"i live in thunder bay and work in sioux lookout, so i travel there on sunday and return on thursday. the highways are desolate. june saw steady traffic but now i am seeing very few fisherman on the road. the economy in northwestern ontario is in terrible shape with the collapse of the forestry industry. resort owners are hurting very much. a friend who owns a fly in business was down 150 customers last year alone. any resort has many openings right now. hopefully things turn around for them but i dont see it in the near future."
1120601,Tom/MN,2009-07-13 14:54:00,35,"Might be time to revisit the rates a bit... By the time you add it all up, it's crazy what it costs now vs. 10 years ago."
1120619,Ogoki,2009-07-13 15:46:00,291,"I still have the brochure from the first fly-in that I went on in 1972 with Airdale out of Wawa , $ 105. I have one from the first trip I took my wife on in 1987 at White River Air $ 335. Now those were very ""rustic"" camps too but I did not mind . Had a great time then and now . From what I see most camps are in the $1000 to $ 1400 range . I guess the only way to compare is to look at the average wage in 1972,1987 and now and see how it compares ???????? In the mid 1990s I new of 54 trips to Armstrong from either our church or people who came into where I worked . About a 1/3 of those were the same people doing 2 trips . This year I only know of my wife and I going .Many guys are deceased , many retired and so forth ."
