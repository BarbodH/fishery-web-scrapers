We would probably hit the Minnesota border around 9:00 am. Sat.. Anyone been up there in that time frame on a Sat. Just want to know what to expect for delays and should we consider an alternate route. Thanks in advance for any help."
1130278,rockpt,2009-08-20 13:41:00,589,"We went through that on Sat., July 31 just about same time you're going to hit. Lost at least 45 minutes at Faribault and again north of St. Paul. Backed up a good 3-4 miles before each merge. Was just as bad or worse coming home late Sunday afternoon. Here's a detour suggested by went22 for the construction north of St. Paul. And BTW, according to the MNDOT website, both areas will not be completed until Nov. larrym 08-19-2009 02:26 AM ________________________________________ Construction on 35 North of Minneapolis Just got back from Canada and going again on Friday. Ran into a real traffic mess north of Minneapolis due to construction on I35. Was wandering if 65 would be a reasonable alternate? went522 08-19-2009 03:19 AM ________________________________________ Not sure if they finished the const. N. of Mcgregor on 65 yet?? It was pretty bad a few weeks back. We ended up taking 169 back south for the ride home. We took 35 North last friday, what a cluster FK that was. We missed a turn that would have saved us alot of time...if you take exit 129(i think) which is just N of the 35 Y to the east and hook up with 61/forest blvd and head North you can miss all the traffic. The traffic stays at a good speed and moves right along on forest blvd which parallels 35, while we were at a stand still on 35 we watched the traffic scooting along headed N on forest blvd. If I were to take that route again I wouldn't be missing that exit. Once you get to Rush city head back W and hook up with 35, smooth sailing from there. BIRDDOG"

1130310,IaDave,2009-08-20 15:33:00,476,Sioux Lookout thru I-Falls
1130374,SinOrSwim,2009-08-20 19:55:00,1528,"I was just up there (MPLS) last weekend for the PGA and the construction south of MPLS didn't delay us at all. Went up in the afternoon and back in the morning. Neither time were delayed. Have a good trip. We fly out of Sioux Lookout the 29th. Let's hope for cool, sunny and CALM WINDS."
1131035,IaDave,2009-08-24 06:54:00,476,Anybody been thru the construction lately- It looks like going to Hiway 61 or 65 to bypass is the answer to getting around the work-
1131138,Smitty,2009-08-24 12:30:00,1934,"I can't speak to the construction North of the cities, but drove to the Mpls airport and back Saturday afternoon to pick up my wife's mom and the Owatonna/Faribault construction areas were no issue. There were highway patrol at both of them, so if traffic is light just make sure you're at the posted speed limit in the construction zone. I think it really depends on traffic as to whether they back up. Of course on another note, they have signs on both of those telling you to use both lanes and ""take turns merging"". It seems like it would be a lot smarter to do the normal ""x lane closed ahead"" a few miles before and at least get the majority of the vehicles in the right lane prior to the merge.."
1132254,Guest,2009-08-28 14:44:00,0,we just came back thru yesterday and going south had no stopage at any of the spots you mentioned. When we went up we had no stops either. Now when we were coming back at about 3:00pm yesterday the traffic around the construction N/B out of St Paul was backed up and stoped for several miles. My guess is you will be fine on a Saturday morning. The earlier the better.
