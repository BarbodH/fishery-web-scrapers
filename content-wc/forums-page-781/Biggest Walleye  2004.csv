543996,Guest,2004-10-31 08:11:00,0,"36"" walleye using clown colored rogue, caught below powersite dam near forsyth missouri from my favorite spot on shore last week, best walleye area for catching a 5lb'er i know. Powersite dam is where bull shoals lake starts and the upper 5 miles of the lake is like a river with lake width being no more than a couple hundred yards, from now til mid march the walleye congregate below the dam due to increased water flow due to generating electricity. I live about 8 miles from this spot and have fished this area for 12 years. I don't own a boat and usually fish the same spot using either a clown or blue back colored rogue. I've guided a few people using their boat and the best time is about 30 minutes before dark and an hour after dark trolling."
