Would appreciate info re: good spots on both Partridge and Kesagami, and any tips on what tackle to bring. I did a search and found some info, mostly about Ron, but would like some more info re: the fishing. We are going June 19th. Thanks."

Partridge has no islands or rock faces and few points, we found Walleyes and Pike in fair numbers trolling the lakes center humps in 8' to 12' depths. Kesagami is very shallow, I believe it averages about 7' of depth, there is supposed to be some 25' holes but we never found them. We caught walleyes along the Western shore near Ron's boat cache, we were able to get a limit of 15"" to 17"" Walleyes for a fry on one of the two days we fished Kesagami. It's a huge lake and winds can be a problem. Most any lure that could be trolled close to the bottom worked well, blue and silver seemed to be the hot color when we were there. Good luck with Ron! Some people love him, most don't, enough said."
