544390,Guest,2004-12-05 09:12:00,0,Anyone know if there is going to be a ban on lead jig heads? Thanks!

544404,Guest,2004-12-06 08:55:00,0,IT IS NOT A PROBLEM OR A CURRENT ISSUE IN ONTARIO!
544409,Guest,2004-12-06 13:22:00,0,"Thanks guys, just wondering if this went any further than the rumors I had heard...."
544418,bigfish1965,2004-12-06 22:04:00,3210,It seems to have been put on the back burner for now...we'll see what happens in the next session of parliament....
544434,Guest,2004-12-08 11:47:00,0,Actually lead jigs are allowed in Ontario Provincial Parks but banned in Canadian National parks.
