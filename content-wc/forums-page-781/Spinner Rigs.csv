544439,Guest,2004-12-08 16:19:00,0,"Good information! A group of us have been fishing Gull Rock/Keg/Red Lake, Lac Seul and Eagle for several years. About three years ago during a slow bite on Eagle I switched from spinners to a plain 60"" snell, colored hook and 1/4-3/8 oz lindy weight (just enough to get to the bottom) and slowed the speed down. That was so effective we've found ourselves doing that almost exclusively the last couple of years. Just an interesting alternative to spinners and bottom bouncers."
544441,Guest,2004-12-08 16:57:00,0,Thanks for the response on the weights. I also wondered how you guy's are tieing the hooks on and what sort of loop are you using on the end. Thanks. Steve
544444,Guest,2004-12-08 17:27:00,0,"steve, here's a good basic tutorial. http://www.walleyesinc.com/walleyeinc3/howtotie.html a few years back, i switched to fireline for my snells. i also use the quick change clevises. i use a palomar knot for the bottom hook and snell the other 1 or 2. i also use a swivel at the end attaching it with a palomar knot. i buy tiny ziplock bags for storage and can keep about 100 in a sandwich bag. if you use those other type swivels and attach the blades, you can get into all kinds of storage challenges. i used to fly up there (commercial), so space was at a premium. another reason that i use fireline is that i don't have to worry about mono deteriorating over the years. no reties. i never want to risk a trophy on an old mono snell. there are lots of acceptable ways to tie these things. i don't pretend my way is best. just remember that they are just a method to direct a fish to your bait. lots of combos of flash, vibration and color will work for this at different times. good luck."

544464,Guest,2004-12-09 07:53:00,0,"The best line on the market for tying harnesses is maxima line. I live in northern ontario and the light brown colour mathes the water pefectly. Pete Harsh uses this line when he comes up this way. I know some of the top guys in the MWT and PWT are now swithing over because of its stiffness and superior abrassion resistance. I usually tie with 10lb test when I fish the St. Marys river and 15lb test in northern lakes with more pike and in saginaw bay when we get into big eyes and the accidental cat. Everyone here has quoted the 10ft per ounce thing which is good. However, I don't like my like to be at a 45 degree angle. I like it as verticle as possible. In rough conditions I have used upto 3 oz in 20ft of water to make sure I am exactly where I want to be on a piece of structure. The spot on the spot. I never use painted bottom bouncers. The plain colour works best for me. Jason"
544398,Stehle,2004-12-06 06:20:00,95,"This question may be a little dated and probably answered thousands of times, but what color, size, setup do you make your spinner rigs? My daughter (age 9 with little fingers and good eyes) and I made some rigs up last night. We made 4 sets of three of the color combos that I prefer. As a general rule, I use #2 hooks and put 4-5mm beads and 2-3.5 or 4mm beads on a 4-5 ft. line (8 lb. Silverthread Excaliber). One set had an Orange hook with yellow, ruby, and chartreause beads and a firetiger Dakota spinner. Another set had yellow and red beads with yellow hook and bronze Colorado spinner. Another set was Chartreause and Green with Green hook and Chartruese Tiger Colorado spinner. The last was Green and Red beads with either red or green hook and Red Splash Colorado spinner. I tip them with bungee leeches, leeches, 3"" Power Grubs, or Gulp Minnow Grubs in Pumpkinseed, Chartreuse, Firetiger, Green/Orange, Chartreuse/Green colors. Almost all Berkeley stuff with some Cabelas brands. I did Ok last year in NW Ontario, but would like to hear what works well for others fishing this wonderful area (vacation paradise)."
544403,Guest,2004-12-06 08:52:00,0,WHAT TIME OF THE YEAR ARE YOU COMMING UP?
544405,Stehle,2004-12-06 09:22:00,95,"Late June...Savant Lake area (Kawaweogama). The water is stained with Tanins and is usually only 60 degrees. It is a typical shield lake. Air temperature varies from snowing to 75 or 80. It rained every day last year, but most of the time it only rains have the days. BTW, I just reread the article in JustFishOntario.com ""Bottom Bouncing A-Z"". It is a decent article and he doesn't put much emphasis on bead colors, but a lot on blades and blade colors. Even though I run 4'-5' snells, I don't have that many snags as was suggested in the article. I feel the distance helps with any visual disturbance the bouncer may make."
544406,Guest,2004-12-06 10:01:00,0,"phil is of the opinion that beads are rather insignificant other than keeping the blade away from the hook. he also doesn't think much of colored hooks. i can almost guarantee that 5 foot snells will not work on lac seul. i have some amount of trouble keeping 30 inchers out of the snags. many believe that the bright colored blades invite more pike strikes and bite offs. i keep it pretty simple and stick pretty closely to rolph's formula. i do, however, use some large deep cupped colorados. size 7 mostly. always 5 and above. works for me. good luck."
544407,Stehle,2004-12-06 11:19:00,95,"The pike thing may be true, but they often attack anything that moves. A Caveat to this was a psuedo experiment that my Dad and I had last year. We had already gotten our limit for the week and we were messing around. We had been working 12'-20' all week, but decided to pull Williams Wabblers on the meandering ride back to camp. We fished anywhere from 5' to 10' with my Dad using a Gold Wabbler while I was using a Gold/Silver Wabbler (no Gold in the box). My Dad caught all Walleyes and they hit hard (the bite had been very light all week). I caught half pike and half Walleyes with each of us catching about a dozen. Needless to say, I'm going to stock up on Gold Wabblers for next year. I've always had good luck on the Firetiger colors, no matter if it were in a crankbait or a spinner. Some years (or days) Pumpkinseed was hot and others it is Chartreuse. Either way, it is always good to mix up color and presentation in the boat to see what is working and what isn't."
544421,Guest,2004-12-07 09:53:00,0,"I don't like coloured hooks at all. I use size 4's and 2's. I never tie a 3 hook system, always a 2 hook set up. All you need is two colours. Chartruse and cooper. Try to match the beads to the blade colour. I always use one 5mm bead (chartruse) a floater body (chartruse) and one 5mm bead fire orange behind the blade. I use quick change clevises and a size 4 blade. Fire tiger or chartruse and orange. Next put a 2mm bead above the clevis to keep the algea off the clevis so it can spin. The copper set up mimics a crayfish and works well in stained water especially after you fished a piece of sturcture fairly hard. The key is the weight you use and your boat speed as well as boat control. Any other questions just fire away. Jason"
544427,Guest,2004-12-08 05:59:00,0,"I have a couple of questions on this subject. Do you guys use a bottom bouncing weight or just a sliding weight? In 10-20 feet of water trolling slow, what size of weight would you more than likely use? Thanks. Steve"
544429,Guest,2004-12-08 08:07:00,0,I use bottom bouncers and go by the rule of thumb of 1oz. per 10 feet of depth...or whatever keeps the line at a 40-45 degree angle to your bouncer. In swift current or a fast boat you will need more weight in the bouncer to keep it near the bottom. My daughter asks every night if we're going to make more spinners. I'm running out of storage pouches and I may have to take some old ones apart to redo (gives us something to do and we get rid of the old line). All in all it's our way of bonding together...and she doesn't complain when I request another cold one.
544430,NateW,2004-12-08 08:51:00,96,"When we travel to Lac Seul we use 30 -35"" in leaders made from 14 lb Trylene XT, unpainted ""baitkeeper"" hooks, #4 blades and #4 beads. Our best blade colors are usually chartruese, lime/Chart., Green and orange--pretty much in that order. We generally match the bead colors to the blade colors. Not sure if that makes a difference or not, but they look impressive to us. Our last trip up we found that 3"" twister tails out-performed live bait. Again, we matched the plastic bait color to the color of the blade and beads. Dioes it make a difference? Who knows. We generally backtroll them with 1 oz or 1.5 oz Bouncers. We buy all the components from Cabela's, then on the coldest day of the year, get a case or two of ""beverage"", some of venison sausage and tie spinners, tell lies, and talk about what great fishermen we are. (Which when coupled with the lies is redundant, I know) When our trip arrives we'll take the entire spinner-making kit with us and will tie more in the cabin as needed. But we use as inexpensive stuff as we can. It seems like the fish don't know the difference and the pike will bite-off the more expensive line and hooks as quickly as they will the cheaper stuff. We also found that sometimes we would get little ""hits"" on our rigs instead of solid bites. As soon as we'd increase trolling speed then the hits would turn to bites. I'm probably just echoing what most everybody already knows anyway. Good Luck. Sure wish it would get cold, I've been saving up some really good lies for spinner-tying night!"
544431,Guest,2004-12-08 09:14:00,0,"skylane, i also use the 1 oz per 10 foot rule and use the straight line bouncers on a quick change clevis. my son uses bullet weights about 1/2 oz and fishes way back from the boat. he gets a few more snags than me, but not many. we catch about the same amount of fish. i think both work fine. depends on what you like i guess."
