544428,Guest,2004-12-08 06:35:00,0,Do any of you know anything about these two adjoining lakes. They are located somewhere north of Red Lake. If anyone is familiar I have a couple of questions. Thanks.
544436,Guest,2004-12-08 15:01:00,0,I fished Nungessor annually until about 6 years ago....not familar with Story. Birch Point lodge which was a boat in location owned by George and Connie Green. A good Walleye and Northern Lake.
544460,Guest,2004-12-09 05:52:00,0,"Thanks for the reply Larry. Since posting I came up with a little more information. I had received info on a fly-in cabin for sale on Story Lake and knew it connected to Nungessor but did not realize until yesterday that Nungessor had road access. Now, knowing that I have concerens about fishing pressure. I would really like to find an outpost cabin on a remote lake."
544461,Guest,2004-12-09 07:00:00,0,could you email me the info on the cabin for sale on story lake ASAP i am VERY interested in a cabin up north..... i have fished nungesser before... it is a decent lake. THANKS SO MUCH my email is ...[email protected]
544463,Guest,2004-12-09 07:47:00,0,"YEs, any info on this outpost cabin would be greatly appreciated. As I am interested as well."
544470,Guest,2004-12-09 12:52:00,0,Nungessor does have road access but it's to Nungessor river and the trip into the lake by boat is not easy so people just dropping in would not be an issue. There are 2 camps on the lake however that accomadate several fishermen. One had started to bus in from Chicago the last year we were there and that affected our decison to look eleswhere. Fishermen coming out of Nungessor into Story would be rare I would think....we never did it in the years we were there and didn't talk to anyone else that was either.
544471,Guest,2004-12-09 13:35:00,0,"Not an easy trip into story . Up a grown over creek that in many areas not even navigable. Went to Nungessor about 8 times years ago before mining road was therwe, Itr was a flyin for many years with 2 different outfitters and also the lodge near the river enterance, Atn that time fabulous pike fishing always a coulple over 42 ' best was46.5. Good walleye as well but we never got any pigs. Early June fishing. WE quit when road opened up and access to river."
