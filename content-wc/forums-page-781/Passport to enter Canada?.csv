544384,Guest,2004-12-04 14:32:00,0,Took my boat 5 times across the boarder at the Soo this year and not once did anybody suggest that I register my boat with them. I don't get why one place has one rule and another has different rules. Seems all crossings should have the same rules.
544386,rebelrn2001,2004-12-04 20:05:00,1563,We go to Canada yearly w/my boat in tow and never have had an issue about 'registering' my boat. Maybe thats because it's a LUND??? LOL
544392,Trailerguy,2004-12-05 09:59:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]A boat coming from the USA can be used for 45 days without any registration problems. If it is going to stay longer than that you must notify customs at the border, a simple form filled out lets it stay the entire season, but they need to know when it returns to the USA. If it remains over winter it must be at a marina with a ""repair"" tag and additional paperwork. If customs finds a boat that has overstayed it's welcome or without proper paperwork, PST and GST taxes on the value are immediatly due or they will confiscate it. Boats may be registered in Ontario by non residents after taxes are paid, and a boat number is assigned very similarly to the way it works in the USA."
544482,Guest,2004-12-10 10:07:00,0,"You do not need a passport yet, it you have one bring it along. You should have a birth certificate. I live on the border, with MN. I have been asked for a birth certificate for years. Not always, but most of the time. A driver's licence does not show "" origin of birth"". Anyone can get a driver's licence after 6 months."
544491,Cold Front Illinois,2004-12-10 18:46:00,449,"A couple of us are in the planing stages of a Canadian fishing trip through International Falls. One of the guys mentioned that we should not be asking anyone who would have a DUI on their driving record. Any truth to that? If so, wouldn't a lot of people be turned away at the border unexpectedly? Just trying to stop a rumor here in Illinois."
544528,Trailerguy,2004-12-13 16:59:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]DUI is a felony in Canada and they don't let felons across the border. Do a search of the archieves on DUI, a lot has been written, under some conditions they allow old DUI's in."

544083,Guest,2004-11-05 13:18:00,0,"Wonderful . . . more brilliance from south of the border. These are Americans who are so strongly opposed to the direction of the U.S. they want out. THEY ARE AMERICANS! They are not Canadians, or citizens of any other country, yet! That has absolutely nothing to do with Canadians working across the border, other than the fact that many Canadians have voluntarily given up their jobs and moved back home for much the same reasons. They see no other alternative. Americans wanting to renounce their citizenship is purely an American problem!!! Only in America would someone be so arrogant (or stupid) as to suggest this issue has anything to do with foreign citizens employed in the country. Talk about ""the blind leading the blind!"""
544084,Sam,2004-11-05 13:48:00,16,Take a deep breath. My point was that not all Canadians hate the US like you seem to. I would be willing to bet that more Canadians immigrate to the US than the other way around.
544086,Guest,2004-11-05 14:15:00,0,Don't want to live there and could give a #### if a bunch of lefties want to move there cause an election didn't go their way. I just wanted to know if a passport was required to take a short vacation next summer. I like Canada and like it's citizens but I live here in the U.S. Thanks for the info I didn't mean to start anything.
544089,Airwave(OH),2004-11-05 20:15:00,1179,"One thing I did run into this year going into Canada is now you have to stop and register your boat at customs. You fill out a paper and then when you return you have to turn it back in. They told me if I got stopped on the water and didn't have this paper they COULD confiscate everything. Not likely but could. It was all free but kind of a pain turning your rig around when the booths are plugged up back past the bridge. Never ahd any trouble going TO Canada, US Customs was alot more strict."
544099,Guest,2004-11-07 20:10:00,0,reister on the Us side or Canada side???
544172,Guest,2004-11-15 08:51:00,0,"1st week of october this year is the first time we have had anyone tell us we needed a birth certificate or a passport. this was in pembina,nd. he said this will be mandatory soon, but didn't tell us a date. this hasn't happen to us yet in baudette, but i am sure it will get to that. the guy in pembina asked us if we go to mexico or anywhere else without a passport or birth certificate...i guess it makes sense but it doesn't seem real neighborly."
544176,Guest,2004-11-15 16:15:00,0,"No. What you need will vary depending on what part of Canada you are planning to enter. For Eastern Canada including Ontario, a membership card for the Democratic party of the U.S. will suffice. This will also work in B.C. For entering via Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, a Republican party membership card would work better. LOL"
544205,rpieske,2004-11-19 10:23:00,1276,"Canada has taken a real hit in the news for being a vulnerable border to terrorists. I believe this action is a step toward correcting the concept that Canada is not responding to the terrorist problem. The more it tightens its borders, the safer we all are. Look at this as a positive action, not as an unneighborly act. Canada is the best neighbor we have and has a history of supporting most US policy decisions over the past 60+ years. However, we must remember that Canada is NOT a part of the US. It is an independent country with problems and concerns that are often unique to its constituency. Try to take a broader view of this issue. I am thankful that we have Canada as a neighbor. I can imagine many other countries that would be horrible as neighbors, but few which would be better."
544208,Guest,2004-11-19 15:55:00,0,Been to Mexico many a time. Never needed a birth certificate.
544061,Western Walleye Editor,2004-11-04 16:59:00,465,I also haven't heard it of being set in stone. However I was also told that it is good to have. I have a passport from traveling overseas for work so that helped. My wife only had her Driver's License and it slowed us a little. They were very polite and recommended either a passport or birth certificate as both are proof of citizenship. I would guess that if you renounce citizenship or something that could slip through though. Honsie
544064,Guest,2004-11-04 23:38:00,0,in september my wife and I and the boat sailed right accross in both directions. did not ask to see anything either way. coming back ona sunday afternoon and not much traffic the US guys were giving every trailer the once over though. only about 10 minutes though.

544066,Guest,2004-11-05 05:54:00,0,"Please be reminded that it is the USA that asked Canada to be more viligent at our borders, for us to do that requires we apply the same paperwork rules for someone arriving on a boat or plane as one arriving by car, or else it would be discrimination against other countries by our Immigration officers. I imagine we will always bend the rules more on our USA Canada border even if we ever go as far as passports in next couple of years or chip implants 20 years from now :) jake"

As I told the border officers, people shouldn't be offended by having to answer a few questions, UNLESS they have something to hide. We all want to be safe, it's just that we want the other guy's rig to be gone through. I know I wouldn't want their job."

544011,Guest,2004-11-01 09:13:00,0,I read on a Musky site that passports will be required to enter Canada starting 1/1/05. Has anyone heard of this? It was I checked with Pat at Evergreen Lodge and she hadn't heard of it.
544014,REELMAN,2004-11-01 10:24:00,1624,"when i went across in Oct. they wanted pass ports or birth certificates. we had neither. they gave us some guff, hauled us in and took our ID's. Held us up for about 45 minutes and sent us on our way. that was in Pembina ND."
544015,Guest,2004-11-01 11:44:00,0,I called US and Canadian customs and both said that they would prefer you have a certified copy of your birth certificate and a picture ID such as a drivers license but that any two forms of ID would work as long as one was issued by a State or Federal Government. I have never shown an ID going into Canada and only my drivers license back to the US
544036,Guest,2004-11-02 23:52:00,0,Hi. I think I read that if you are a forinor to these shores of North america then they want to see something good. i to have never had to show anything going either way my whole life going up there for 30 years except lately whats in my boat. What is canada going to turn you around when you are bringing cash up and the states not letting you come back with all the taxes you pay them? no way.
544039,Backwater Eddy,2004-11-03 07:42:00,3871,"The birth certificate is a must these days, especially if you do not posses a passport. They do not consider a drivers permit as proof of much. Even with that we have been held up for up to an hour when things are tight. You never know what may be going on behind the scenes so you maintain your composure and never..ever smart off to them...that is a bad deal. I seen it happen where guys ""Smart off"", MMM-Boy...they get the full treatment then...big blue greasy glove and all...Ya...best not to smart off Eh. We have not gone the passport rout in the past but likely will go ahead and get one. It may streamline things if you go in and out of Canada frequently. I suspect things will get even tighter at the border in days ahead so getting one early may save time and hassle latter, that is my thinking anyhow.

544045,Guest,2004-11-03 10:27:00,0,"My experience THIS YEAR, is the same as BE's. In the past, a picture ID was fine. This year, birth certificate or passport was asked for. On the first trip this year, I did not have birth cert or passport, after a SHORT delay, they let me enter Canada. I was born in, and live in MN. The trip to the county clerk to get a copy of my birth certificate took 5 minutes, and @ $15.00. Walked out of the county services building with it in hand. Friend of mine from ND had to request one to be mailed to him, will take about 2 weeks, similar cost. Later trips with birth certificate were smooth sailing. I learned many years ago to never snicker at the Queen's authority. They think alot of that gal up there..."
544046,Backwater Eddy,2004-11-03 11:06:00,3871,"I do not have trouble getting in, or out of Canada. No more or less then anyone else I suspect? Most of our crossings this season were accomplished in far less then 5 minutes. All of the personnel going in, and out, were friendly and very courteous to us. I understand they are doing a tough job and act accordingly so they can do their job efficiently. I did not mean to say they harass anyone as a practice."
544048,Guest,2004-11-03 14:39:00,0,As long as you have that $10 bridge fee you are fine. They have never checked our ID's going across. The only time I have showed an ID was when I was paying the duty on our weak American Beer. (GO BUSH !!!!!!!!!!!)
544050,Guest,2004-11-03 14:50:00,0,WE CROSSED YESTERDAY BACK INTO US. THE GENTLEMAN AT THE BORDER SUGGESTED NEXT TIME TO CONSIDER GETTING A PASSPORT. HE SAID IT IS NOT LAW BUT IT WOULD HELP PROVING YOU TO BE A US CITIZEN. HE ALSO STATED THAT THEY HAVE BEEN PROBLEMS WITH PEOPLE PRINTING FAKE BIRTH CERTIFICATES. HE SAID SOME DAY IT MAY BE REQUIRED TO GET A PASSPORT TO CROSS BUT IT IS NOT YET. WE HAD BIRTH CERTIFICATES AND ID'S AND IT WAS SMOOTH CROSSING. HOPE THIS HELPS.
