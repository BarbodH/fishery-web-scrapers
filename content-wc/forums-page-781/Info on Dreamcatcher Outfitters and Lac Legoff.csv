I was wondering if anyone had any experieneces with these guys good or bad. They fish Lac Theodat, Lac Legoff, and Lac Tesceau. I've fished the area they guide to on five different trips in the late 80's/early 90's. We flew in the first four years and then drove the fifth on the hydro transmission line road. It was about a five hour drive from Waswanapi to Lac Legoff. I'm wondering if anyone could share any recent experiences with me on these lakes. I'm really wondering if the road and the new outfitter camps on these lakes have made an impact on the fishing."
