544506,Guest,2004-12-12 00:26:00,0,Hi. we stayed at timberlane for a long time when glenn and delores had it the next owners we never tried. golden fawn right there was real nice too. get all the brochures and decide for yourself.
544507,Guest,2004-12-12 12:32:00,0,Pat & Gary at Evergreen Lodge are going to 19ft boats with 50hp 4strokes in 05. They have a great fall package
544508,Guest,2004-12-12 13:48:00,0,"alan, don't know how long ago you stayed at timberlane and it was ""real nice"", but it must have been a while. only thing real nice about the place are the kids that run it for the absentee owner. boats, motors and cabins are rough. they have raised the prices in the last couple of years so that they are as expensive as the good lodges in the area. used to be able to save a couple of hundred bucks if you were willing to put up with the problems. no longer the case. it was for sale a couple of years back; not sure if it still is. i've seen folks rate the ear falls lodges on this board and timberlane finishes consistantly last. lots and lots of maintenance issues over there."
544517,Guest,2004-12-13 11:01:00,0,Its probably been 15 years since we stayed at timberlane. Glenn and delores anderson lived right there and were allways there to help. the prices were good. the boats and motors were first class. we probably went there for 10 or 15 years. things allways change when a place changes hands.
