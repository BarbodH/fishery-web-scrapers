544462,Guest,2004-12-09 07:45:00,0,We went on a trip a few years back and there was a guy who went with us who was Brother in Law of one of the other guys in the group. He was a self acclaimed expert on everthing and a real pain in the rear. He was in my boat one day and we were fishing an Island point that was about two miles from the cabin. He announced that he wanted to go back to the cabin and I told him we would go back in a few minutes. He insisted that we leave now and told me if I wanted I could take him to shore and he would walk back. I explained to him that we were at least two miles from the cabin and the island we were fishing didnt have the cabin on it. He of course said he knew the cabin was just around the corner and hw wanted me to take him to shore. Since he was an expert I dropped him off. It was a small island and I knew he would bo OK. I came back about one hour later and picked up the expert. It didnt stop him from being a expert on everthing but it did stop us from inviting him back.

544489,Guest,2004-12-10 12:50:00,0,"We were on a Father&Son trip up to the Goiun last summer, 4 adults and 4 teenage boys. One afternoon, the kids were fishing off the dock in the bay at the remote camp we were staying at, catching little 4-6"" Shiners off the dock with small hooks and tiny bobbers. They were having fun, just chillin and passing time. I piped up from where the adults were sitting and said ""Hey, save a few of those shiners, in fact, put one on a bigger hook and heave him out there.....you'll catch a Northern"" The response, from my son was ""There's no Northerns in this little bay."" You know the deal, they know it all at that age (as we did too). It was perfect. Within seconds, as my son was lifting another small shiner out of the water, a dandy Northern smashed the shiner and gave him one heck of a tussle for 30 seconds or so, before it broke off the small #6 hook. To this day, that Northern was easily a 20#er in the kids telling of the tale. Needless to say, the kids strategy quickly changed that day and they had a ball with the Nords. Ah yes ""There's no Northerns in this bay!"""

We fished all day without any luck and the guide said to take one last cast and we will head in for dinner. All of a sudden, the boat jerks and my buddy goes ""Oh F##K"". Turns out he hooked himself in the head with the bucktail he was throwing. These hooks were soo sharp that they went right through the baseball cap he was wearing and burried the hooks past the barbs in the back of his head. He had the guide look at it and asked him to pull it out. Because the hooks were in so deep he wouldn't touch it. My friend was begging him because he didn't want to go back into camp like this. Unfortunately, he had no choice. Once we got into camp, the camp owner took a look at his head. He cut off the cap and suggested we go to the hospital. We took the boat back to the mainland and headed to the hospital which looked like a big mobile home. While the doctor was working on him the nurse fainted. The doctor finally got the hooks out and stitched him up. Since the nurse fainted, there was nobody who knew how to do the billing. The doctor kept asking what we thought his services were worth. Little did we know he was serious. After everything was all done, my friend was more embarrassed than hurt. He now has a new nickname of hooks. We were unable to get a picture of the bucktail going through his hat but our memories will live on forever. Wingman"

544412,jerry bark,2004-12-06 17:54:00,822,"my brother in law, who is a really good guy, went with us to canada for his first fishing trip other than fishing the lake where i live. As a treat his wife bought him a really nice fishing hat at gander mountain to wear while fishing. he told us all how great his hat was, ""don't even have to hold it on while running."" he said. well, on the last day of the trip the wind was up from the west and he rode in holding his hat until we got to the no-wake zone around the docks. as soon as they slowed down he let go of his hat and in it went!! so his buddy turned the boat around just in time to watch his new super-fantastic-gander-mountain-fishing-hat SINK LIKE A ROCK IN THE NO-WAKE ZONE!!! oh man did we laught at him......all the way home to lansing michigan, yes sir, 700 miles of crap over that hat!! Still make me laugh. i'll bet next year he brings a U of M ball cap..... cheers jerry"
544426,Guest,2004-12-07 17:23:00,0,"On just (one) trip to Alaska my friend: 1. Gashed his finger deeply opening a can. 2. Stood up and banged his head on a cabinet, swearing loudly until he passed out. 3. Followed me wading down a river until I took a turn from a deep hole and he didn't, resulting in a hat floater and a 1 hour trip back to camp in 50 degree weather. His 1000$ portable radio was ruined when his friend tried to turn it on while still wet and fried it. He missed 2 weeks of work from the resulting bronchitiis. 4. Took a 1/2 oz pixie spoon to the head and spent a few minutes on his knees when my dad cast and barely flicked my line as I was seving as a human anchor behind the boat. He still doesn't know I caused it. 5. Set the cabin on fire (twice) with white gas. 6. Set his food outside to keep it cool that a bear ate on the first night in there. He is actually able to laugh about it already,too!"
