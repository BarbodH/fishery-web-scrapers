I will say that I have gone out in a number of guide boats and most have been great. I will continue to use guides, and I am a big tipper. My best guide experience was when a guides boat came free overnight from a dock, and drifted off. We drove him around the lake and finally found it hiding against a bog. It had drifted over 2 miles. He thanked us and marked on the map two of his personal hidden cribs he put in himself, and a downed tree that for some reason holds slab crappie all year. The spots were unbelievable. We tipped him when we saw him that night. My worst was this popular guide on the Chippewa Flowage about ten years ago. His answer for every fishing situation was a Beetle Spin. He must have been a rep for the company, because he kept trying to sell us these things all day. We caught a few small pike and nothing else. We kept asking if we could stop at a resort and pick up minnows and he kept telling us that the beetle spin will produce. Since the walleye were not hitting in the morning, we went pike and musky fishing after lunch. His lure of choice? A big Beetle Spin. To this day, if my friends see a beetle spin we rattle off the guides name and laugh."

Many years ago (1962) when I first started Walleye fishing in Canada my boss invited me to go on a trip with him and several of his buddies. We went to a camp that had Guides avaliable and we booked Guides for all five days prior to going to the camp. Our first day on the water was awesome. We caught big numbers of fish and many very nice Walleye. That night the guy who was the self appointed leader of our group told the rest of us that he had told the Guides we didnt want them the rest of our trip. He figured we could find fish without Guides since we seemed to be in Walleye Heaven. The Guides and camp Operator were upset since we had booked guides for the whole trip but our leader stood his ground and said NO GUIDES. About 2;00AM that next morning there was a loud knock at our cabin door and it was a Conservation Officer. He confirmed that our boats were at the dock and wanted us to explain the over limit amounts of Walleye that were neatly tied to our boats. We of course were shocked but paid our ""on the spot"" $50 fine per man. I have always assumed that the Camp Ownere and his Guides got their Guide money and we and our intelligent leader got the short end of the stick. I actually thought the Guides ingenuity allowed them to get what they had coming and we got what we had coming too."
