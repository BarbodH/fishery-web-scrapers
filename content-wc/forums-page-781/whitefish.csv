544549,Guest,2004-12-15 10:24:00,0,"Whitefish is the most underfished fish. I fish them all winter and most of the spring and fall. Summer is for walleyes. People don't realize that small stuff works the best for whities. I have spent years starring at my camera screen figuring these babies out. I use light line and very small tear drops but ofted times use custom made flies (size 14-18). I also love them to eat. When you trim the fat and take the side bones out, there is no better fish. As for Lake trout tips, try jigging white tube jigs with a medium shinner, and a size 4 treble for a stingger. Use heavy line so the tube falls slowly. A fish finder (vexilar) is a must as lake trout often suspend and I sometimes catch them just below the ice."

544531,jerry bark,2004-12-13 20:20:00,822,"forgot my whitefish tip: we catch them in late june during the mayfly hatch on small orange rapalas floating in with the hatching mayflies, or in the early morning on orange rapalas trolled near the mayfly hatching areas. took home a cooler full last year for the four of us, and were not even close to our limit. they are good eaters!! cheers jerry"

Match the hatch best you can, and get ready to have some fun! I know this is a walleye board, but if you'd like to toss up a lake trout thread, I'd be willing to post. All the best!"

544535,jerry bark,2004-12-14 04:59:00,822,"i thought about a fly rod, thing is the whitefish are not eating the adult mayflies, they are eating the wigglers as they swim up to hatch, or are struggling in the surface film trying to break out. maybe i'll try a wiggler pattern and grease it a bit so it just stays in the surface film. as strong as the whitefish pull they'll be a blast on a fly rod! thanks jerry"

544544,Guest,2004-12-14 15:54:00,0,"You're mostly correct in your assessment that they're eating emergers, but not entirely. A few years back I discovered something while targeting whities on the surface with my fly rod. During the peak of the hatch when fish were boiling all around me I missed fish after fish on a dry fly. I'd get these utterly savage strikes and pull back to nothing. I finally figured out that the whitefish were initially submerging the dries with there snout, then leisurly sucking them in when underwater. I forced myself to count to 3 after every strike before I set the hook (something that's REALLY hard to do), and had a heyday after that with multiple hookups. On our lake in northwestern Quebec I anticipate the mayfly hatch every year, as it's incredible fishing. Usually the peak runs for a week to 10 days, late June into July."

544521,Guest,2004-12-13 12:06:00,0,"Yes we do fish whitefish. They are great eating, pretty easy to fillet, and a scrappy fighter. I liken them to fishing for panfish... but they come a bit bigger in size. An extra bonus with whitefish is you tend to have predators in the area also.. could be lake trout, pike, or walleye. We fish for whitefish in spring and into the first part of July. As the water warms, usually after the mayfly hatch, they will seek colder water, and will head deep. But during this spring period you will find them in shallower water. During spring we will use ice fishing jigs tipped with a small piece of worm. Just fishing straight down seems to be the ticket. Also use small minnows with a small hook and sinker. The mouth of a whitefish can tear easily... so give a firm steady hook-set being careful not to rip the hook out of their mouth. Whitefish are underappreciated by many... but get into a mess of them and you are going to enjoy some great fish frys."

It's great in the spring, after ice-out we will catch them from shore, or catch them while fishing for walleye/pike/lake trout. Never a bad thing for me. Like I mentioned they make for great dinners, and it only takes a few fish in the 2-4 lb range to give you plenty to eat."
