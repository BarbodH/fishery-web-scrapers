My two adult sons and I are hardcore whitetail hunters and would like to plan a hunting trip for next year to a northern area. Here in Ohio, we have great hunting for whitetails. However, we would like to do a northern big woods rifle hunt for some large bodied bucks. We would like to go to NW Ontario or anywhere in Ontario, Wisconsin, or Minnesota. We have all necessary gear and can drive and bring it with us, or we can fly and rent a vehicle. If you have any suggestions on a reasonably priced lodge, or someone who rents cabins, or any other helpful information, we would greatly appreciate it. As far as the hunting is concerned, we do not need a guided hunt, but some local helpful information would be great. Maybe someone who rents cabins and has stands built in the woods. Big woods do not imtimidate us. Both sons live here in Ohio, but are hunting and fishing guides in Alaska for 5 months each year. Thanks in advance for your help. O F"
