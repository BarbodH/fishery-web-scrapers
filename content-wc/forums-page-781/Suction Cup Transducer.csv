544468,Guest,2004-12-09 10:46:00,0,The guys and I usually only have KY on hand. Can I substitue KY for Vaseline?
544472,Guest,2004-12-09 14:27:00,0,"Me and my buddies bring vasoline anyway, might as well try it on that too!"
544477,Pooch,2004-12-09 21:39:00,4619,"Clean the area on the transom with a scouring pad or sanding pad to remove the slime that builds up on a boat that is in the water all of the time. That will cure most of your problems. You might still have it come loose once a trip but use a string and tie it up short to keep it out of the prop. Also the suction cups do harden after a few years and they won't hold as well if distorted or smashed out of shape. In the off season keep them from drying out by coating them with vasoline as long as it does not attack the rubber. It takes a little patience to get the transducer ""just right"" on the transom so that it reads at speed and does not throw up a ""rooster"" tail if it is too far below the bottom of the boat. Also, watch that you don't get it directly behind a brace on the bottom of the boat. That will make it harder to get a reading at speed. Pooch"
544479,Backwater Eddy,2004-12-10 06:34:00,3871,"If your using a unit that has a puck style transducer here is a trick that will save you some frustration. Cut a piece of PVC tubing just larger then outside diameter of the transducer puck. Lay a bead of silicon around the rim of the tubing and affix it to the center of the sump area at the rear and center of the boat. Then insert the ducer into the tube with a shot of water. You may wish to add a thin layer of felt in the bottom of the tube to protect the ducer from vibration and damage. As long as it is wet, the signal will shoot through the hull on aluminum as well as fiberglass boats. Vaseline will also work instead of water in the tube. Just be sure to press out any bubbles trapped in the jelly under the face of the transducer or the unit will pick them up. I have used my Vexilar FL-8 SLT and/or my FL-18 ice-fishing package on boats many times over the years with this trick. No suction cups to tinker with or to get loose and end up in the prop.

544486,Guest,2004-12-10 10:59:00,0,"Wow this is a great idea. Can you get a good return while running at full speed? I could never do so with my portable transducer i nthe water, either held by the suction cup or screwed onto a stick that is clamped onto the transom. >If your using a unit that has a puck style transducer here is >a trick that will save you some frustration. > >Cut a piece of PVC tubing just larger then outside diameter of >the transducer puck.

544490,Backwater Eddy,2004-12-10 15:11:00,3871,"On most hulls, as long as you center the ducer well you get a good signal at all speeds. I use this system on my Tri-hull boat because I get less disturbance under the ducer then I did with a transom mount. It is an easy matter to test for the best location at a few speeds before you stick the pvc pipe down with the silicon. Ed ""Backwater Eddy"" Carlson ""ED on the RED"" ><,sUMo,>"
544498,Guest,2004-12-11 08:31:00,0,"Use of the suction cup resulted in my transducer taking a dive to the bottom of the lake. Use one of the ""c"" clamp devices. I believe I bought mine at Cabelas - for the next unit I bought after loosing the transducer via ""non"" suction cups."
544438,Guest,2004-12-08 16:03:00,0,"I am curious how many have used a suction cup transducer mount on an aluminum boat and what type of success you have had. If this has not been successful, what other options do I have for using a portable fishfinder on a rental boat? Thanks"
544440,Guest,2004-12-08 16:48:00,0,smear some vasoline on the inside of the cup
544442,Toolman,2004-12-08 17:04:00,2570,"Pikefisherman, I've used the suction cup mount made by LEI with an X85 on several fly-ins on AL boats with no problems. I haven't tried the vaseline idea (a good one) but the suction cup usually stays right where you stick it with no help. A small nylon string comes with the one I hav. Tie it off to the handle on the boat to keep the TD out of the prop, in case it comes off while underway. Edit: Forgot to add that a buddy of mine uses a 1""x3"" board (app 16-18"" long) and a Vice Grip ""Quick-clamp"" and clamps his to the transom."
544443,retire55,2004-12-08 17:16:00,1029,"I have been using outfitter boats for years. When I purchased my Lowrance sonar unit 5 years ago, I also purchased a separate transducer holder from Titelok. I opted for model number 5D698. It has worked very well other than it doesn't keep the transducer in the water at speeds above 8 mph. If that is an important requirement, you may want to opt for model 5HS798. You can check out both models at the web reference provided. You will also need to purchase a bracket from Titelok to hold your transducer onto the transducer mount. http://www.titelok.com/transducer%20holders.htm"
544445,JimH,2004-12-08 17:50:00,320,"Mine is at the bottom of a lake in Canada. Luckily the finder didn't follow it. I would second the Titelok transducer bracket too. It's got a nice c-clamp, adjustable, etc. Actually use it for ice fishing when I'm in a shack with a wood floor. Mount it right to the edge of the hole."
544448,Guest,2004-12-08 18:15:00,0,The Titelok idea seems to be a good one. There are no prices on the webiste. What is the approximate cost?
544449,Guest,2004-12-08 18:18:00,0,Just found the price!
544455,Guest,2004-12-08 21:24:00,0,"Been using the suction cup for a couple of years,never had one come off while moving. Mine came with a string tied to it so you can fasten it on to the boat incase it did come off,you wouldn't loose it."
544457,Guest,2004-12-09 00:11:00,0,Hi. i got my portable about 20 years ago. I saw this on another boat and coppied it. It was similar to the stuff for sale but I made it myself at work. I bought a 4 inch 'C' clamp and welded to that a piece of half inch pipe about 16 inches long and then found the next size smaller pipe that just fit inside the first pipe to have a slip adjustment. I put a bolt through the smaller pipe at the top so it would not slip through the bigger pipe. then I welded a nut on the top of the bigger tube so I could have a clamp type of affair to hold the smaller tube at whatever point I needed it. at the bottom of the smaller tube that the holds the sonar unit I filed just enough to allow the unit to be attatched at the end. it has worked fine and did not cost anything but a little time. I use it on my tyee now as a fish finder. I have the finder that came with the boat on at the same time with no problems. I clamp it on so its just below the bottom of the boat and forget it.
544467,Guest,2004-12-09 09:02:00,0,"Have been using the suction cup for the past 15 years on fly-ins. The only problem, they will come loose and as stated earlier, tie it off with the string provided, to the boat handle. I try to clean the film off the transom of the boat where I want to mount it and that seems to help some, but even then, they loosen up sometimes. I have never lost one because it has been tied off, but sure have banged it on the back of the boat and motor before, flopping in the water. The vasoline idea is interesting. Wouldn't that make it more slippery or in the cold water, stick better?"
