544362,Guest,2004-12-02 18:41:00,0,Purchased the Eagle Fish Easy II last year and did a fly in trip to Manitoba lake. The unit came with the temp free. Used a 12 Volt 7amp battery and it lasted for the entire trip. You don't want to go into a trip without one!
544364,Catman59,2004-12-03 04:15:00,345,"I have a Bottomline Fishing Buddy that goes everywhere with me. It has temp + the sidefinder option. I love it. It uses 3 ""c"" cells and it takes about 6 of them for a good week of Canada Fishin. Its very portable and has been very reliable ."
544379,Pooch,2004-12-04 07:52:00,4619,"The ""OLDER"" Eagle units will not last a week on one set of batteries. Even using premium batteries. By ""older"" I mean those units that would have used two 6v lantern batteries. Buy a newer unit and like the others have said you will be ok. BUT, an extra set of batteries isn't going to hurt. Don't go cheap after spending the money and time on a great trip only to run out of battery the last day or so. BECAUSE! You may forget to turn it off at night and that will be the end of that! Trust me on that one..... Somebody does it almost every year. Pooch"
544395,nitroman,2004-12-05 22:31:00,368,I also have the fish easy 2 portable but i use the small 12v battery that fits inside the unit and i scrapped the suction cup and made a clamp on holder out of stainless steel to hold the x-er the unit works great i've had it for 3 seasons now. the fishing buddies can't be used while you are moving you gotta pull them in before you take off so you cannot watch the bottom while you are moving
544397,Catman59,2004-12-06 04:04:00,345,"""the fishing buddies can't be used while you are moving you gotta pull them in before you take off so you cannot watch the bottom while you are moving"" Yes that is their downfall , they are only good to about 3-4mph"
544425,Guest,2004-12-07 13:00:00,0,Before you buy - look at this one:http://www.bobbershopfishing.com/ele...arywaters.html I have the earlier version without color - works great - marks great even on the run - very small footprint
544458,Guest,2004-12-09 00:16:00,0,"Hi. I got a portable hummingbird 20 years ago, uses 2 of the lantern batteries and last over a week. I did not trust the suction cup though. comes in a nice case."
544299,Guest,2004-11-28 10:28:00,0,"I am curious how many of you bring portable fishfinders when you go into the remote camps of Canada. If so, what brands and models. I am considering purchasing one and would like some advice. Thanks"
544302,Guest,2004-11-28 15:20:00,0,"Eagle Fish Easy II. Works great, and all week, on 8 D cell batteries. Easy to use and to pack in. Had one for three years now and have had zero problems. I think they sell for less than 150.00, but I got mine on sale for 129.00."
544317,Guest,2004-11-29 10:18:00,0,Wouldn't think of going without one!
544318,Guest,2004-11-29 10:23:00,0,Eagle Fish Easy is what I have used for the last four years. Works great. Have never had to use more than one 8 D Cell battery pack in one full week. CATCH AND RELEASE
544330,jerry bark,2004-11-29 15:13:00,822,"i have the fish easy II as well, well worth the money and effort to bring along. go for it..."
544343,Guest,2004-11-30 15:30:00,0,We have three Eagle portables and they work great. One set of fresh D batteries will last the entire week.
544344,retire55,2004-11-30 16:32:00,1029,"I take a Lowrance X-85 in with me and I use a 35 amp-hour battery as power source. The X-85 uses 400 milliamps per hour with the back light off and 700 milliamps per hour with it on. I purchased my 35 amp-hour battery based on power required for 6 days (10 hrs/day with no back light + 2 hrs/day with back light on). I've had no power supply problems in four years. Whats the power usage (milliamps per hour) for these eagles you guys use and how many D cell batteries are in a set? Are there 8 D cells hooked togther in series, thus providing 12 volts? Thanks in advance."
544355,jerry bark,2004-12-01 18:00:00,822,"hi, my fish easy 2 uses 8 d-cells in series for 12 volts. the current draw is 300 ma no backlight, 400 with backlight. though i have never used the backlight i can run a week trip on one set of batteries, I always bring a spare set just to be safe. cheers jerry"
544357,JohnAB,2004-12-02 07:27:00,49,I take a Piranha Max 10 with me. Runs on 8 double AA batteries. With no backlight on and the inverse bottom view on I can run the whole week no problem.
544358,retire55,2004-12-02 08:39:00,1029,Thanks to both Jerry and John for your responses.
