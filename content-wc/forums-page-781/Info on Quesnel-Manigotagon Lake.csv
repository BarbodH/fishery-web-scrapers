Would like to get info on were to fish, best bait and what to expect as far as size of walleye, pike and smallmouth. Also, would appreciate knowing how anyone did. Thanks Jim"

You won't be the only one on that lake as remote as it is, a lot of people make the journey.You'll meet more Americans than Canadians. I have fished that lake in june for the last 4 years with different results every year. It seems when the water table is high the fishing is awesome. We have gone out there some times and hardly caught anything. However I have had the best fishing of my life on that lake. One night about a mile and a half from the lodge on the same side of the lodge,15 feet from shore we hit a honey hole that I dream of still today. For about 1 1/2 hours we pulled in walleye on every cast trolling in a circle around a big rock. Return visits to that spot have netted not a #### thing. The lake is like that. If you are not hitting them ,move, or keep moving. The people who run the lodge will map you out the locations and you will find fish but keep moving till you find a hot spot. We fish with Cabelas living eye plastic baits 2 inch green with white tails tipped with minnows live or frozen as well as night crawlers. This will catch you anything on that lake. A good starting point would be just past the four star cabin by the falls. A lot of people make the treck to Happy lake and have lots of success on slow days.If you are driving I'll give you a piece of advice ...bring gas! The only gas station up there is Bisset and the station is closed Mondays if you can believe that!The next one is about 100kms back towards Winnipeg. The road in is very tough on autos. It will take you an hour to drive the last 5 miles! Have fun it's beautiful up there. From Winnipeg, Doug"
544381,Guest,2004-12-04 10:37:00,0,"Doug, Thanks for your reply. You indicated this lake can be hot and cold. Is this for all species (walleye, pike and smallmouth)? How did you do on pike and smallmouth? This lake is suppose to have pretty good size perch. When the lake is cold is the perch fishing decent? When you said there are lots of boats on the lake does that mean hot spots will be difficult to fish? Can you boat into Happy Lake or is this a portage lake? Yes, we will be driving in to this lake. When you brought to my attention the gas situation do you mean to fill up the auto? I assume they sell gas at the lodge for boats. I am concerned about the last 5 miles you mentioned. I was planning on bringing my own boat. Based upon your caution do you recommend bringing it? Is the road in such poor condition? Did you stay at Jackson's Caribou Lodge during your visit? We went to their outpost camp this year at Bloodvein River and had a tremendous stay. We are planning on doing it again in late August or September 05. This will be the last year for this outpost camp the Povincial Government is tearing it down. What a same! Thanks Jim"
544400,Guest,2004-12-06 08:20:00,0,"I meant gas for your auto, but an extra jerry can of gas is allways a good idea. We always camp at Jacksons. They have a rustic campground there with outhouses and thats it, $15.00 a day. You can buy gas,ice,bait, and a few other supplys at the lodge. If you stay in the campground you can still have a shower at the lodge, but they charge you a small fee, $3.00. Don't worry about the road it's not that bad. The road has so many twists and turns in it that it forces you to drive about 7 miles per hour. If you drive fast you will bottom out or go off the road, so take it slow and you'll be ok. There is this guy from Michigan that brings two large motor homes in every June( for a month) he tells me it takes him 3 hours to get them in, his wife walks along the road and guides him all the way! He and his family have been there every June for over 20 years! Even when its slow you can always find northerns. Walleye are always there too, you just have to find them. Pearch and smallmouth are a little more elusive. Happy lake is a portage lake. THe camp may have boats stashed I don't know ask them, we've gone in with a zodiac. There will be lots of boats out there but not to worry you won't be bumping into people unless you want to. Lots of water to fish out there. This is something you might want to consider if you are really organized. You can rent an island campsite all to yourself to camp on. You can rent them at Jacksons prebooking is recomended. Again just an outhouse on the islands but how cool is that! As far as water temp I've never paid attention, if I'm there I'm going to fish no matter what. Hope this helps you out Doug HUM"
544411,Guest,2004-12-06 13:55:00,0,Doug Thanks for your info. Will you be going up this year? Jim
544416,Guest,2004-12-06 20:39:00,0,"I'll be going up this year for sure ! The water table should be up for the spring . I'm hopeing we get lots of snow so we have lots of run off. I don't like to shovel it but it sure helps the lakes. Don't know when I'll be up there in June , have to make plans with my fishing buddy. It's just so beautiful in Nopoming Park. It's just where the real Manitoba wilderness begins . I feel so blessed that all this beauty is only a couple of hours away. Make sure you check out some of the other lakes in the area, there's lot of good fishing up there. How long are you going to be in Manitoba and how long at Caribou Landing ? If you have the time I can put you on to some awesome pike fishing on the way back to Winnipeg. Really easy to drive to. Good for an afternoon of fishing. It's catch and release only though... Gotta put em back. It's an hour north of Winnipeg. Let me know. Doug Hum"
544437,Guest,2004-12-08 15:58:00,0,"Doug, I would appreciate it if you have a good nothern lake to fish. Catch and release is our whole agenda. If you come to Jackson's when we are up there, please look me up. Here is my email [email protected]. We will be there from June 14-22. Drop me a line and let me know your schedule in May. Thanks again, Jim"
