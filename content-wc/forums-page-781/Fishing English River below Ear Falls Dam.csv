544399,Larry S,2004-12-06 07:02:00,666,Am thinking of fishing English River below Ear Falls Dam in mid July has anyone fished the river at this time of year? What worked for you in bait's and lures? Larry S

But, since there is never more than a couple of boats I'm guessing that it may not be as good as it looks. Plus, that water seems to be really boiling at times. In central Illinois guys fish below the wickets for white bass. There may be a few sauger there as they seem to be moving south down the Illinois. Didn't answer your question but your post caught my eye. Pooch"
544419,Guest,2004-12-06 23:58:00,0,It was great. try it. leach on a small hook with a couple of split shot up about 2 feet. cast out from near shore anchorage and let it sink and sit. wife an limited out on walleyes and northerns in about 6 hours. no slot limit there like on the lake back then anyway. dont need luck there.
544420,Guest,2004-12-07 09:26:00,0,"never fished down there. i watch the fishing reports religiously for all areas of lac seul. seems that they catch a lotta fish there, but slightly less and slightly smaller than up in the lake."
544422,Guest,2004-12-07 11:05:00,0,"Make no mistake about it. below the dam seems to be always hot. and the fish are big. I had seen people before my turn below the dam come back to the lodge with really big walleyes and northerns to clean and was amazed at there size, asked where they caught them they responed- below the dam. I did not know that the lodge would put a boat in for me below the dam if I wanted."
