My primary interest will be BIG pike with a fly rod and with conventional tackle as well. At $2,500.00 this will be the most expensive trip that I have ever taken and I obviously don't want to pick a dud. All of the info that I have heard from the references provided by the lodge has been extremely positive (I know... don't ask the butcher if the meat is tender), and I know that In-Fisherman filmed there during the Lindner days with great success. Any experience that you guys may have, good or bad, would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for everything and have a great holiday season!! Ruddiger"

We have always gone to Silsby in August but Im sure that June would supply you with plenty of great Pike Fishing. My personal biggest Pike at Silsby is 45"" but one of the guys in our group got a 48"" giant one year. The accomadations are very nice and the Hosts are great."
