I wrote as it came into my head and then went back and added things so grammar and spelling may not be the best.Trip reportThis was a short 3 night trip at the lodge. Schedules were tightDay 1. Drove to Virginia, MN. We stopped at the Mine in Virginia and the Hockey Hall of Fame. I have been going to Canada for over 20 years and this was the first time we had driven up the hill to see those big mining trucks. The view up there is very cool. We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express. Very nice hotel, nice breakfast selection in am. Day2. Took time to make several stops. In Orr at the big Blue Gill and again at the turn to Kabetogoma on the big walleye. Jack thought getting on the saddle and riding it was pretty cool. A man in his 60s was up by the walleye and Jack yelled up you have to get on it!!!!! The mans wife laughed and sure enough he got up on the walleye for a picture. Lol Next stop I-falls and then the border crossing. Was by far the easiest border crossing I had ever had. I had a notarized letter from my wife but they didn’t ask. Next stop was the Beer Store. Alas, it was a Canadian Holiday and all Beer Stores and LCBO’s we found were closed. I really wanted to take some Kokanee with but was afraid that may not happen. But, Nestor Falls Dalsegs saved the day. A quick stop at the air hangar there to look at the float planes then to Sioux Narrows. Had lunch at Big Johns. It was good but not great. Neat view though. I had the walleye sandwich. Very average but I saw someone who had their special of the day which was a spicy beef sandwich and it looked very good. Next time stick to the special. We saw an O.P.P. station and I pointed it out to Jack and what it stood for. He then said oh, I thought you were going to say it stood for Oh I need to go Pee Pee. I then said I just hope we don’t end up there. Mocking the OPP may not be such a good idea. We also stopped at Gills for bait and the Rushing River Falls. I have been coming up to Ontario for a long time but we are always ready to get to the lodge. This trip was different and we took out time and saw a ton of places I wouldn’t normally stop. I explained to Jack what an Inukshuk was. He got a kick out of these. We counted them from the first one we saw north of fort frances until Sioux Narrows. We counted 158 in all!!!!! And we know we missed some. One of the most entertaining aspects for me was listening to him read the name of a lake and randomly deciding WHY the lake had that name. For instance dogtooth lake was because a bunch of dog teeth are at the bottom, Hawk Lake was because a Hawk was eaten by a walleye and then the dark one that Percy lake got that name because some poor guy named Percy probably died there and is somewhere on the bottom. RIP Percy. There were many many more.Arrived at Hawk Lake Lodge about 2:30. Very easy to find. A long windy gravel road that was very well marked with signs and arrows brought us to the end of the road where “registration” signs pointed the way. We were greeted by Virgina and Ted. My original thought was to get settled in, unloaded and rigged up before dinner. Little did I know THEY unload the truck and haul the gear to the cabin. So, Jack got to take a couple rides in the utility vehicle which he thought was awesome!!! They also gave us a brief tour and explained how things operated and after that feel free to do whatever we wanted and if we had any questions or needed something we didn’t find to please ask.Got into the cabin and poles rigged up quickly and were able to get out fishing for an hour or so before dinner. No luck fishing but boats are very nice. New Crestliners with 50hp Yamahas. Electronic trim and more importantly electronic idles. If you want to troll with that motor the idle control actually works, unlike most I have ever used, and the idle was down to a very low setting. Very nice Humminbird 596c depthfinders with down imaging. The nicest part of these boats was the Minnkota trolling motor on the front. The foot pedal came all the way to the back of the boat so I could control the boat from the rear. This is something I have never fished with and all I can say is wow, what a great way to control the boat. Cocktail hour was great. Complete open bar with a great selection. Some wild rice stuff sausages with a creamy/spicy dipping sauce and we met several of the guests. Dinner was a Veal stuffed with proscuito, currants and pine nuts topped with a cognac cream sauce. Went fishing after dinner. Had a smallie on within the first 10 minutes of fishing but nothing else after that. Came back and got settled in for the first night. Toured the area a little bit to see the workout room (the one and ONLY time I would see that) and the game room. Has a nice pool table, poker table and dart board. It is above the fish house and overlooks the lake. Our cabin was so close to the water you could almost fish off the front. The cabins are older but very well kept. It was extremely clean. The bathrooms are dated but at the same time are very very clean which for me is important. I’d rather have harvest gold floors and tubs that are clean vs new fixtures that are dirty. Beds were small but very comfortable. Day 3. First full day fishing after breakfast. They have a special or you can order eggs anyway, omelets, pancakes either plain, blueberry or chocolate chip, French toast, hashbrowns, sausage, bacon etc. I had the special which was corned beef hash with 2 over easy eggs on top with a side of sausage and toast. Excellent and probably my favorite breakfast of the trip.We had a guide named Collie (spelling?? Short for Colin I believe) big guy and was extremely helpful and nice. We told him I wanted to fish for Walleye but talking to some of the guests it sounded like that was going to be a challenge. It was very slow. So, we would start out doing that and let him point us in the direction of whatever he thought would bite after that. Jack picked up the first walleye after about an hour. It was about 18 or 19 inches. I caught another 19 and then Jack caught a 21. Another boat next to us caught a 23 or 24 and then it shut off. Those 4 fish came literally within about 10 to 15 minutes of each other. So, off to sapphire lake for smallies after shore lunch. Shore lunch was walleye, potatoes/onions and beans for me and some huge hot dogs for Jack. He casted a floating rapala as Collie made lunch. First cast was a fish. He was reeling in and only about 5 feet from shore when a 12 inch bass just attacked it!!! It startled both of us but was very cool to see it just leap out of the water to attack the bait. Sapphire was a short portage. It was fast and furious. We trolled the shoreline pitching jig and crawler or a hook and crawler with split shot and there were times it was one after another after another. Most fish being pretty small. Every so often we would get one about 10 to 12 inches long. We asked what he thought the biggest fish was in this lake and he said most likely about 17inches. Not huge but this was a very kid friendly lake. Next thing you know Jack hooks a 14 and I keep hitting the 10’s and 12’s with a random 13. He also caught a15 and 16in smallie. Collie was awesome baiting his hook and never flinched even though Jack is 9 and left handed. This meant he was casting over the top of collie’s head each time. LOL A very good guide and easy to talk with. Back to the lodge to shower before happy hour and dinner. Dinner that night was bison short ribs. After dinner we went back out by ourselves for some walleye. I caught a 23in walleye within the first 30 minutes. Thunder in the distance that we were keeping an eye on. Out for less than an hour when we saw some serious lightning in the distance. Back to the lodge we went. Sat on the dock and Jack fished off the dock as boats were coming in before the storm. Caught a nice 16 inch bass off the dock and a couple smaller ones. Storm hit later. Wind, rain etc. Power went out about 9 or 10 and came back on about 3:30 am. Day 4. Got up early to do some fishing before breakfast. We flew the drone above the cabin as the sun was coming up and then went out fishing for an hour before breakfast. Caught a 19 inch walleye and a couple small bass. This day Jack and I portaged into Mirror lake. They had given me a map with places to fish and I forgot it at the cabin. So, we winged it. Small boat on this lake. Short portage thank god. Someone (me) needs to exercise. Lol We trolled the shores and pitched cranks and also back trolled them. Caught several smallies with the biggest being 16.5 and a 20 inch northern. Pulled over for a picnic lunch. Jack made an Inukshuk at the shore lunch site which he thought was pretty cool. A few more bass after lunch and I decided we would go back to the main lake for awhile. It was HOT this day. Had to be pushing 90 with very little wind. Ugh!!! Fished the main lake a little with no luck so we went back to the lodge. Jack fished off the dock for awhile and then we went to dinner. Ted and Virginia are from Boston so I don’t know if this was their influence but dinner was clam chowder, fresh bread, Caesar salad and then a pasta dish with big chunks of sausage in penne pasta with cheese and a red sauce. This was probably my favorite dinner. Went out fishing for awhile but didn’t catch much. Beautiful night though. I let Jack run the trolling motor for awhile which he loved. We went back to the dock and I sat in the shade drinking a few beers while he casted a shad rap off the dock. Within 30 minutes he pulled in a 19 inch and 21 inch walleye off the dock. Other boats were starting to trickle in and his big smile was a dead give away he was catching fish. I think he did better than most everyone else. He literally fished off the dock for hours. It was about 10 pm and dark when I finally cut him off. He had a head lamp on and would have stayed out there longer had I let him. Day 5. Our day to leave. We got up, Jack flew the drone for a bit and then went to fish off the dock while I packed everything up. After breakfast, we checked out and they sent a UTV to load our gear and haul to the truck. I packed the truck because I had a certain order I wanted it but I wouldn’t have had to. Trip back was fine until between Nestor Falls and Ft Frances. I decided to pass a slow vehicle and ended up going pretty fast. Came up over a hill and BOOM, there was the OPP!!! If anybody was ever curious what a speeding ticket cost it is approx $100 for going 110 in a 90. Border crossing very uneventful and they were friendly. Stopped at Border Bobs to get my other kids something from the trip. I’m not one to complain about pricing but we ended up not getting anything. Prices in there were ridiculous. $17-$20 for a tiny tiny little stuffed animal? $9 for a keychain?????? C’mon. Some random notes. I have to be honest and say I was a little disappointed in the fishing. It wasn’t bad but wasn’t as good as I had hoped. It sounded like most everyone else was about the same. Some smaller fish with a random bigger one but for the most part it was pretty spotty. Walleye fishing in particular. BUT, as we all know that is fishing!!! You just never know when they will bite. The site does indicate it is NOT a numbers lake for walleye but you do have the opportunity to catch a big one. I fully believe that. One thing I do question is the wording of the site saying the average walleye on the lake is 28. We caught many walleye in the 19 to 21 inch range. It would take A LOT of huge hogs to raise the average to 28. But, I know they are there. I’ve seen the pictures and videos. But, I question the average size claim. The rest of the site is more than accurate. The service was beyond outstanding. Everyone from the ladies of the wait staff, the guides along with Ted and Virginia were amazing. Not over bearing or intrusive but always there to make sure people were having the experience they want. Countless times when a question was asked by us or another group I heard them answer the question but that was always followed up with something along the lines of …….if you need something else, let us know. We’ll get it for you. Even when my son was deciding on the next night’s dinner we were told those were the choices but if he wants something in particular to please ask. They would make it for us. Down on the docks the guides etc were always there to answer a question or ask if we needed something. Again, not intrusive in the least. It reminded me of a Pebble Beach. I took a golf trip a few years ago and was amazed at the service. They weren’t “in your face” at all. Half the time you didn’t know they were there but if you looked confused or like you had a question, they were right there asking if they could help. The service at HLL was right up there with Pebble Beach. That is saying something! Most places I have been in Canada the lodge owners welcome us and then we are sort of on our own. Not necessarily a bad thing but at HLL there was almost always someone talking to others about what lakes were biting and WHERE in those lakes to try. The amount and detail of information sharing was more than I have ever seen. I also noticed the little things. Like outside the main lodge is a barrel with umbrellas in it just in case it rains for your walk back to the cabin. I’m not a coffee drinker but noticed the coffee mugs were sitting on a warming plate so the mug was already warm before putting in your coffee.I thoroughly enjoyed sitting on the docks watching the kids fish and chatting with the other guests and Ted while we all had a couple beers and discussed the fishing and how we could change things up. All in all I am not sure my 9 year old could have had a better experience for his first Canada trip. He caught Walleye, Small Mouth and Northern. The smile on his face rarely left. He very rarely got bored and his electronics were hardly used. His Nintendo DS actually never came out of the bag the whole trip. Not even in the truck. The ipad was used less than an hour or so while in the cabin. So, even though the fishing wasn’t as good as I had hoped, it was enough to keep him interested the whole time. In addition, I didn’t fish nearly as much as I normally would. Spent a lot of time retying lines, baiting hooks and boat control. Which was perfectly fine with me. As long as he was having fun."
3073793,Pikeslayer8,2014-08-09 09:54:00,1460,"I enjoyed reading this report and was really hoping for some 30""+ walleye to find their way into your boat. I think the 100$ speeding ticket is payback for taking a Nintendo, Ipad and Drone into fishcamp. Sorry for saying, but fishcamp is the place to get away from all that crap, cellphone included. Clam Chowder?????? Sin, glad you had a good trip with your son, but what is up with babying him so much? Baiting his hook, really? Man, I musta got up on the wrong side of the bed."
3073969,SinOrSwim,2014-08-09 11:13:00,1528,"I too was hoping for some big walleye. But, when the walleye bite was slow we fished more for bass since they were biting. Had a good time with it too.I completely disagree on the technology. Vacation is about fun and relaxation. I can use my technology to augment the fishing portion. I don't check work emails etc. But, I did share pictures on facebook etc. Plus, with a 9 year old and it being his first trip, what does one do in the car? Or, if it rains? I take an ipad in the boat to play music. I honestly don't understand the need to get away from technology. I used my air conditioner on the way up too. I missed my AC in the cabin. My idea of the perfect camp would have great fishing along with air conditioning and satellite tv. On our guys trip we take a laptop and a TV to use a slingbox to watch football. I don't think there is much better than fishing for walleye all day and coming back to drink beer, play poker and watch a football game. This was his first trip. I wanted him fishing as much as possible. If that means baiting his hook, so be it. He is not afraid to hold a fish or touch bait. I can do it more quickly.And, I LOVE clam chowder. If I ever moved from the midwest I would probably find some little fishing town on the coast. Fresh seafood is awesome. To each their own, but I have no desire to ""rough it"". I like the modern conveniences. I was amazed he didn't ever take his DS out of the bag. Not even in the truck on the way up or back."
3074153,Pikeslayer8,2014-08-09 13:01:00,1460,"It's just that I was nine on my first trip and I brought up my boys when they were nine on their first trips. Without having access to electric power or wifi or cell towers, I look at the techno aspect in a different light."
3075233,rather-be-fishin,2014-08-09 21:23:00,429,"Great trip report! Enjoyed reading it! Glad you liked the Holiday in Express and stopped at the Mineview in the Sky. Hope you saw some miners and their huge trucks actively working in the open pit on the left. Interesting thing that they need to move Hwy 53 within 3 years because they are going to mine the area under where the HWY is now in Virginia. Looking at going across that deep pit on the right. I can't wait until my grandsons, who are 2 & 4 year old get old enough for me to bring them to Canada fishing with me too! Great way to make memories to last a lifetime! RBF"
3075561,Fisherman Ted,2014-08-10 06:15:00,461,"Glad you and Jack had a wonderful time and sorry you didn't get into some truly huge walleye. In the heat of the summer with high temps, no wind and bright sunshine (and just a 2 day trip) it can sometimes be tough. During those 2 days we only caught 6 fish between 28 and 30.5 inches by the 4-5 parties that were here which is below our high season in June and July but to be expected under such hot weather conditions (the bigger ones go deep during these times). When the weather sours (or at least we have some clouds!) the big gals come right back up. I still remember his beaming smile as he caught fish after fish off the dock and hope he remembers his trip with his dad for years to come. -FT"
3075953,Bill Krejca,2014-08-10 08:50:00,6107,Interesting report! Bill
3076441,SinOrSwim,2014-08-10 12:32:00,1528,"Yes, we had an awesome time. We knew fishing for walleye that time of year could be more difficult. The great thing was if the walleye were slow we could just go for smallies. I have never fished smallies but man were they fun to catch. Also the first trip I've taken with meals included. I have to say I love the food we make on our trip but the meals were great. I could definitely get used to that. lolCouple more stories. One of the guides caught a 28"" walleye one morning while he was out by himself. He had a video of it on his iphone. I asked if it was a gopro? He said, nope just my iphone. I asked how he did that? He held his pole AND the phone with one hand and reeled with the other. LOL It was really good video too. it was like it was mounted to the pole. you could see the reel and most of the pole. Very cool.On our last evening fishign after dinner we were down past the narrows. We were on our way back in and there was a boat fishing by the narrows. It was not a lodge boat. It was a couple cottagers. They saw my son sitting in the front of the boat and waved us in. Told us to have him cast into shore right where they were for bass. You could see the bass feeding. I thought that was very cool these strangers saw a kid and let him take their fishing spot. Also a very pretty lake. Easy to navigate. Actually almost impossible to get lost. The areas of the huge sheer cliffs were very cool."
