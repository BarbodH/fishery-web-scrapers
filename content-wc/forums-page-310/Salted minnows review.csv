2928225,yoopertrout,2014-06-23 16:54:00,1172,"I haven't used crawlers for walleyes, so I don't really know. I figured the salted minnows would be easier to keep alive though."
2928233,yoopertrout,2014-06-23 16:56:00,1172,Where do you get them? I liked Minnesota bait and tackle because they were so cheap. Do you trap your own?
2928241,yoopertrout,2014-06-23 16:57:00,1172,"We used them on 1/4 and 3/8 oz jigs and they worked fine. They were a bit smaller than live fat heads, because they were a little shriveled. I think Minnesota Bait and Tackle has different sizes of shiners if you want something a little bigger."
2928393,Fishoil,2014-06-23 17:41:00,1277,"I buy them from the local wholesaler. I think they retail for $8-10 per pound. Two pounds per person are more than enough for a week in Canada with the group I go with. Some of our guys have a minnow on every time they cast a jig and some use twister tails and very few minnows. I take about 2 lbs each and usually come home with 1/3 to 1/2 of what we take. The price is cheap enough that I don't want to risk running out of them, and yes, they do work as good as live minnows. As an added benefit they stay on the hook better too."
2928457,stillangling,2014-06-23 17:52:00,149,"Minnows must be very small. As a general rule of thumb you can expect somewhere between 60 and 75 doz per gallon if you buy live bait up here. I tend to favour the larger ones. Regardless, if you do the math, that works out to 600-700 minnows per gallon. I can appreciate the fact that minnows shrink in salt but I am thinking that if you are getting that many per gallon that they must be tiny?? I use salted spottial shiners but they probably cut your fishing ""power"" by about 25% during open water fishing in my experience. The other thing that drives me nuts it the way they get your fingers all goopy. Nothing like digging I into your lunch like that. I also find that they really dry my fingers out and they are already cracked enough! I tend to be cheap so I can put up with some issues. Might not feel the same if I was only up here once a year and couldn't fish walleye as often as I do. I tend to use salties more when I am ice fishing for walleye. Normally just tipping a spoon or a rapala jigging lure then and I don't notice any difference under those circumstances."
2928569,zeebee,2014-06-23 18:20:00,1144,"They both work very well....havent noticed and significant difference. Make sure you have a large towel to wipe the salt off hands otherwise it gets on everything. Reminds you that you are alive if you have cuts on your finger and, you end up smelling like a real cheap Vermillion Bay hooker. Also, wash your hands well before you pee otherwise you may experience an inflamed orifice the likes of which is legandary in Vermillion Bay.I prefer crawlers but wouldnt hesitate using salted minnows if that was the only option. Worm crap is slightly preferable to salt in cuts. Havent bought live minnows in decades....'bout as long as the V-Bay tramp."
2928753,Fishoil,2014-06-23 19:15:00,1277,"I use the salt to cure the minnows, then rinse it off. When using them in the boat I keep a ziplock bag full of them in my cooler and throw a handful in a CoolWhip container with a little water. It keeps them extra moist and soft and makes for no salt in the cuts. Now if that's all the worse that V-Bay tramp makes you feel I might be interested after a week in fish camp."
2928865,zeebee,2014-06-23 19:39:00,1144,Well OK that makes the minnows more user friendly. Up here when you buy brined and frozen minnows they are impregnated in a heavy salt solution and mushy.
2932433,yoopertrout,2014-06-24 16:43:00,1172,"If the salt gives you owies, use a leech locker to rinse the bait. If your criteria for a president is what her **** look like, don't vote. Please."
2959266,BornToFish,2014-07-02 11:25:00,1224,"FishOil, I just noticed this thread and your generous offer to off-load some of your salted minnows. I am from the Appleton, area. We swapped some emails and private messages last autumn about salted minnows. I'm a believer. I was about to salt some minnows in preparation for upcoming trips. Please send me a pm if the offer is still available. The lack of availability of nightcrawlers and leeches has me looking more towards salties for my upcoming trips."
2924249,yoopertrout,2014-06-22 17:36:00,1172,"We just got back from a great trip to Canada where we used salted minnows for the first time. We also used live minnows. My wife used mostly salted (they tend to be easier to put on the hook as they don't wiggle) and I used mostly live, but I used some salted too. We caught about the same number of fish, and the same size. When I switched to salted, I noticed no difference. This was on a fly-in lake that has one cabin and is lightly fished. We used both with twister tails, and, when they were biting good, we would notice a lack of bites when the bait was taken and we were fishing only with tails (i.e. it was not so ""stupid easy"" that tails worked as well as bait. We had planned to try gulp too for comparison, but only ended up using it a little bit (and we caught some fish with it), but not enough for comparison. We were on a small stained lake. The fish were a week or two post spawn, and were caught in 5'-10' of water near open lake rocks, and in 12'-20"" of water off shore. We bought from this outfit: http://minnesotabaitandtackle.com/ and would highly recommend them. A gallon (about 1200 minnows) of salted, frozen fatheads cost $60 dollars including shipping. They arrived in about 6 separate vacuum sealed bags, in a styrafoam cooler, with separately sealed ice, that was still frozen nearly solid. The minnows weren't rock hard, due to the salt. When we opened a new bag, we put them in a frabill leech locker and rinsed some of the salt off. The company shipped on the day we asked them too. The minnows were firm, and they stayed on the hook very well. The same amount of live minnow in Canada would have cost $700. We were very pleased!"
2924329,JAY221,2014-06-22 17:56:00,877,"Thanks for the review. I have been curious about how they work. I think I will give them a try. How quick did you get them? Later, Jay"
2924681,yoopertrout,2014-06-22 19:47:00,1172,"e ordered them well in advance, and gave them a window of time during which we wanted to get them. The arrived two days after being sent."
2924897,michigan walleye guy,2014-06-22 20:50:00,95,"I ordered several bags of the salted minnows from Minnesota Bait and Tackle after I read your initial post about this topic. I was on a fly-in trip last week, and used the salties too. Thanks for putting me on this option, as these salted minnows do work great. I bought them more as a back up option than anything else, but was glad I had them along.Nothing beats life bait, but these things work great. Nice to correspond with a fellow yooper. Have a great rest of the summer!!"
2925441,h8go4s,2014-06-23 05:55:00,1673,"Buy live fatheads, throw them on the driveway, sprinkle pickling salt on them, put them in ziplock bags and freeze them."
2925961,Golden Eagle,2014-06-23 08:10:00,2642,Do you consider the fatheads to be the right size for a 1/4 oz jig? Hoping they're not too tiny. I've been buying 3 pounds of live fatheads each year and salted my own. Your way seems better.
2926761,Fishoil,2014-06-23 11:14:00,1277,"I salt my own every year. I did 25 lbs for this years trip and have a bunch left over. If anybody in my area is heading north soon send me a PM and I'll give them to you. They're experienced travelers, already made one trip to Canada and returned wanting another."
2927721,forgop,2014-06-23 15:00:00,880,Would you say salted minnows are a better option than getting a flat of night crawlers?
2927977,tooski,2014-06-23 15:51:00,393,Good question. Have wondered the same thing...
2928217,yoopertrout,2014-06-23 16:53:00,1172,"I have to confess that I'm a wanna be yooper. We live just over the border in Wisconsin, but we bought and rehabbed an old camp up there."
