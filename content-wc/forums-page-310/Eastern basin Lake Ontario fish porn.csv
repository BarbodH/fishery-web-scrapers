3074145,iBigmacius,2014-08-09 12:52:00,334,Been a decent summer out here. Lots of trips with some big fish being boated. Not crazy numbers yet but they should be on soon. http://img.tapatalk.com/d/14/08/10/gu8yqypa.jpghttp://img.tapatalk.com/d/14/08/10/5eberega.jpghttp://img.tapatalk.com/d/14/08/10/ejybytu9.jpghttp://img.tapatalk.com/d/14/08/10/8yre3ypa.jpghttp://img.tapatalk.com/d/14/08/10/ruva2yre.jpghttp://img.tapatalk.com/d/14/08/10/8e6upuzy.jpghttp://img.tapatalk.com/d/14/08/10/ena8ave8.jpg

3075177,iBigmacius,2014-08-09 21:08:00,334,Yup offshore for sure. All of those were released. I have only kept one this summer and it's because it was hooked bad. What a fishery.
