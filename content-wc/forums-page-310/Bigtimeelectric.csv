We have caught ten times the number of walleyes and all the bigger ones on bouncers and spinners.Bouncers and a colored bead and hook was the ticket today.Bill"
3067265,sped28,2014-08-07 07:30:00,18,what color and size spinner blades are you using and what color of beads leave for lac seul in 3 weeks and always pull spinners and bouncers don't have the patience to sit and jig
3073609,btmbncr,2014-08-09 08:49:00,492,"SpedWe have been using hammered nickel #4colorado blades,Propeller blades from Jannes Netcraft in silver/nickel(the propeller blades have out fished the Colorado blades).We have had good success with spin-n-glo's the small size in chartreuse and hot pink.Bead colors red,orange,chartruese,glow and pink have all been good for us.I tie the leaders 25 inches long and this greatly reduces the number of snags/hangups. Thursday I tried a white soft glow bead in front of a #4 hook with a big leech or up to 3 small leeches and out fished everybody in the boat until they changed to a single bead.I hope this helps.Bill"
3073689,sped28,2014-08-09 09:15:00,18,thanks for the info bill and I see from your other post I will have to load up on crawlers and tie up so propeller spinners before I head thanks again brad
