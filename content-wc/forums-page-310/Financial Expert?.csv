3070921,port1042,2014-08-08 08:51:00,509,I'll be sure to wave as we drive by. Our spring trip is Memorial Day week too. Maybe we could share a Blue at Whiskey Jack's next spring.
3069185,port1042,2014-08-07 16:52:00,509,"OK, here's the question. 2 of us are going to Perrault Falls the first week in September. History has shown that we will need a case of beer (nothing special Bud Light or Blue Light) and a couple liters of Brandy. In the past, we have taken 1 liter of Brandy and a case of beer, (the legal limit without extra tax) and then we stopped and picked up another bottle of brandy in Canada. Fact is, we really don't need 2 liters of Brandy, but one isn't enough. A 1.75 liter bottle is a much better buy and is plenty for us. So here's the question. Are we better off buying a 1.75 liter bottle of Brandy here and a case of beer in Canada; or a case of beer here and a bottle of brandy in Canada? Here a case of beer is about $18.00 and the 1.75 liter bottle of brandy is about $19.00 (Korbel). Ever since I retired I worry about this stuff!"
3069249,trollingforwalleye,2014-08-07 17:03:00,445,boy I wish that was all I had to worry about. vacation and let the moths out of that wallet. if the budgets that tight you better fish local lol
3069257,Golden Eagle,2014-08-07 17:04:00,2642,"Do an August trip, do it one way, then try the other way for your September trip. Post your findings."
3069297,Obabikon,2014-08-07 17:13:00,2370,Better off buying the beer in Canada... A couple reasons. 1st. It will save you a few bucks. The average case of bottles will run around $30 US for 24 beer. The average handle of whisky runs around $50. 2nd. Canadian beer is unpasteurized. Many can tell a large difference between Blue from Canada (much better) and Blue from the US. Have fun and be safe!!!
3069425,bigwalleye1,2014-08-07 18:27:00,2632,"Buy both here, declare one for one of you, the other for the other of you and watch the customs dude try to figure out how to charge duty on .75 ltr. You'll likely get a pass. I declare 2 750 mls or one 750 and a twelvie every trip in and get a wave. They're after the group of 8 bringing in 20 cases."
3069433,port1042,2014-08-07 18:31:00,509,"Thanks Obabikon, that's the information I was looking for. I didn't realize there was a difference between Canadian beer and the US version. I did know the Blue I had in Canada was good but never really thought about a comparison. Maybe one of these trips we'll try Lake of the Woods and we can compare a Blue to a Brandy Manhattan!"
3069585,Glenman12,2014-08-07 19:42:00,762,actually I think you can bring in 1.1 liter of hard liquor so you would be paying the duty on .65...even if they charge you splitting it two ways would be minimal..
3069785,JayM5209,2014-08-07 20:54:00,1050,"Port', before you make the final decision, remember to calculate the cost of the extra gas to haul the beer and the brandy the 750 miles to Perrault Falls and deduct that added expense from the higher cost you'll pay to buy it in Canada. Then adjust the results for the value of the added taste enhancement Obabikon pointed out. P.S. Where you headed in P. Falls. That's the area I've been going to for 35+ years, unfortunately only one trip this year."
3070465,port1042,2014-08-08 06:53:00,509,"You guys are so helpful. I can improve my gas mileage by getting the beer in Canada and the Korbel's down here. A case of beer has to weight a lot more than 1.75 liters of brandy. Maybe with the savings I can get that Flicker Shad I've had my eye on! Jay: I'm heading to Manotak. We make the trip each spring and fall, but this is just the third year. I'll be on my way again 3 weeks from right now!"
3070833,JayM5209,2014-08-08 08:26:00,1050,Just before you get there wave at the Gold Arrow Camp sign for me. First trip there was 1979 and it's been home for my group's annual week of Memorial Day trip ever since. I do my fall trips elsewhere in the same general area. Have a good week on Perrault!
