Paul the owner seems like a decent fellow, and the facilities are good. Not sure what you are wanting to fish for, but there isn't a population of walleye on Crow. Its mostly musky, smallies, and lakers. He does have a portage lake to go into for walleye, and of course LOTW is right across the street. Its the most beautiful water I've ever been on in Canada. I have seen bottom at 30ft on a sunny flat calm day."
