3076753,Anglin Andy,2014-08-10 15:07:00,100,"Arrived at Gawley's on Sat evening on July 26th and fished Sunday, Monday and Tuesday (Power trip as the crew I was with could only stay a short time). Thank You Doug and Gayle for a FANTASTIC trip. First I will start off with Gawley's, for anyone who is planning to go to Lac Seul for the first time, or if you are a seasoned Lac Seul vet, you will not find a better deal in Canada. Cabins very clean, as well as the rest of the camp, cabins come with fridge and a freezer (check out their site). $50 per person, per night, is a price you cannot beat (included is boat launch, dock tie up, electricity, all the ice you need, and a fish cleaning building). Ear Falls is just up the road if you need anything else. We fished the Manitoba Point area of the Lake. Three guys, three days, 270 walleyes (I have a counter in my boat--I'm sure it could be plus/minus a few, but it gets you in the ball park)!!! 400 total with two boats as the other boat did a bit more exploring. The final day alone was 112 in seven hours of fishing--in matter of fact, we did not move from our original spot--pretty much a 100x100x100 area (if it slowed down, just move up or down the break and you would find them again). In my boat two of us were using a bottom bouncer (one with a copper colored spinner and one with a plain crawler) and the other was using a leech and a copper colored spinner. At times they would clobber it and at times they would just hand with it. Fun, Fantastic Trip. Dave"
3076881,bigtimeelectric,2014-08-10 15:36:00,174,Outstanding report. Gawleys run a great camp don't they. Did you guys trailer down to other ramp or just run the boat down to Manitoba point? Did Bill help you out at all? We will be there in 2 weeks and can't wait. Thanks for the report and feel free to pm me with that 100x100x100 spot!!!!!!hahaha
3077161,Fishin Fun,2014-08-10 17:57:00,218,"Total agreement. I just got back from a week at Gawleys and they couldn't have been more accommodating. Doug met us at the dock every morning with the day's weather report, ice for the fish and minnows, and advice on where to fish that day. Then he met us when we came back in at noon and in the evening to see how we did and if we needed more spots to fish. Cabins were clean and comfortable. Our cabin had 2 bathrooms, 2 refrigerators, and a chest freezer. Doug even turned on our air conditioning on the hot days while we were out on the water so that way we came back to a cool cabin. We were so impressed that we rebooked for next year already. Doug and Gayle, thank you for your hospitality and can't wait until I see you again next year."
