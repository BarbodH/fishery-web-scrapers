To say the very least, it was an unbelievable time neither will soon forget. Amidst the week long threat of forest fires, periods of choking smoke and even snowing ash, we boated hundreds of fish while surrounded in Arctic awe. I did up a lengthy picture loaded report but can't post here in it's entirety and format, so if interested you'll have to take a step aside and experience Great Slave Lake over here...http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/f...howtopic=75664 Hope you enjoy. Bunk."

3073873,Pikeslayer8,2014-08-09 10:17:00,1460,Amazing trip report Bunk! My wife wanted to tell Bren that she loved her fishing apparel (outfits). Lol
3075865,Moosebunk,2014-08-10 08:26:00,211,"Will do PS8. Bren will like that. At the lodge one gentleman was admiring her red wetskins... horny bugger! lol. The bibs is what I meant. If it's a color anything close to burgundy, my wife LOVES it! When buying our house, the burgundy shutters caught her eye and before we even set foot in the door, it was the one. Her car... has to be burgundy. ""What kinda car you wanna buy honey?"" ""A burgundy one"" she'd reply. Anyways, I think she's cute in her fishing get-ups, even better when she's posing with giant fish."
