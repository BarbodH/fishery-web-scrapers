3069281,Obabikon,2014-08-07 17:06:00,2370,Just want to give a shout to Jason Gibbons (Obabikon's head guide) and his brother Oliver Gibbons (Tamarack's head guide). Some of you may have fished with either of these two... they are both just flat out amazing fishermen! 18.35 LB's has them in 1st place out of 141 teams in the Kenora Bass International (after day 1).
