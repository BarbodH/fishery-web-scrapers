3062817,camp chef,2014-08-05 15:32:00,915,I am looking for Information on Whitefish Bay Camp.We saw the show on Due North Outdoors and would like some input from someone that has been there. It is remote? Walleye fishing? If you have been there would you return? Thanks Bryon
3062985,downriverbob,2014-08-05 16:40:00,880,"I stay at a resort just north of Whitefish Bay Camp(been going there for about 20 years), it is on the Whitefish Bay, on Lake of the Woods. It is not remote there are several resorts and privates residences in the area. It is very clear ""trout waters"", there are walleyes in the area, they can be tough to find and catch but typically are larger fish. That area is know more for musky, northern pike, bass, and lake trout fishing. There are numerous island, reefs, and bays in the area. Attached a picture of a couple nice fish we caught in 2012. If you have any more questions feel free to contact me. BOB"

The inside scenes were shot in the main lodge, I didn't see any pictures of the inside of the cabins.I've been going there since 2002. It is located on an island that is 5 miles from the boat landing. It is an old style camp in that there isn't TV or air conditioning. I always go up this time of year and I haven't really felt the need for any of those things. They do keep the generators running 24/7 so there is electricity also hot water, inside bathrooms with showers. I do like the quiet of the place. There are no cars running past the bedrooms at 1am. The camp has 8 cabins so it isn't crowded. The dock is in a quiet bay and I've never seen the wind blow the boats around but then, the spring might have a different wind flow than august. Bob and Peg are some of the nicest people you will meet. They work hard to make your trip a success.Another thing I like about the camp is that it isn't a Saturday to Saturday camp, you can tailor your trip to your schedule. they also let just the two of us (my wife and me) stay there. Not all camps are this flexible.Most people I've met fish muskies and small mouth bass and do real well. I am strictly a walleye fisherman. I must admit that the numbers are not as good as they are in the northern part of the lake but it make it up in size. I also enjoy fishing for Lake Trout and I found that it is a good way to spend a sunny afternoon - trolling for them under the Bimini top, out of the sun.Peg does make a trip to town on Wednesdays and will pick up anything you might have forgotten or you can go there yourself. The area around the camp has lots of islands which means that you have the feeling of isolation. There is always a place to fish out of the wind if you want that. The downside is that navigation is a bit of a challenge. You need a good mapping gps or you need to pay good attention to the map. Being a bit of an explorer, I enjoy the challenge of navigating the lake. I could go on and on but I won't. If you have any questions, email me."
3063897,Further North,2014-08-05 21:38:00,2008,"I was there the third week in June, had a lot of fun chasing pike, musky and smallies.Never saw a walleye, but that was likely due to the really late spring, really high water and cold water temps - walleye are clearly caught there most years, and in plenty of numbers.I don't spend a lot of time on walleye when there are pike and musky around...It's an easy trip from International Falls and is more than remote enough for me. As noted above Bob and Peg are great hosts, the cabins are very nice and you won't be bothered by a lot of the ""noise"" of civilization.I will go back."

3064529,camp chef,2014-08-06 08:06:00,915,Thanks all for the replies. Very useful information. Exactly what I wanted to find out.
3068369,Bill Krejca,2014-08-07 12:31:00,6107,"Bob and Peg are nice folks, as stated. I believe if one were a nature lover, you could spend the week just sitting in front of the cabins, and enjoying the calm and the view. Bill"
3068449,thyme to fish,2014-08-07 12:52:00,307,"fished there several times while staying at ""Youngs""..... all I can say is,,,,,,,,very big aggressive pike......never saw a walleye lots of bass,,,,,,,but the pike were big and full of energy.......lots of high 30's.....and many 40""...... I will be back"
3071433,camp chef,2014-08-08 12:05:00,915,"I am sure they are very nice. I have met very few people in Canada that were not fun to be around.I do enjoy nature and the vistas at our other fishing destinations are also very serene,but while I am enjoying mother nature I like to do it in a place where the Walleyes have a good chance of catching me. Thanks again for all the input.This is a place on our list,just not at the top of the list right now."
