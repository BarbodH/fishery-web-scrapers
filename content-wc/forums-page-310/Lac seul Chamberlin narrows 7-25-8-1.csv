3069001,Red legs,2014-08-07 15:56:00,27,Returned home to purgatory after week on heavenly water with good friends. Fishing was good but not as good as years past. Suspect this was purely related to weather. We had light winds from NW every day and thee highs following mild cold fronts. Water temps were 71-74 in back bays with main lake 68-70. Water level 95th percentile. Been fishing this area for over 25 years and this is highest I've ever seen it. Active Walleyes were 15-30 feet on points and mid lake structure. Numerous walleye graphed in 40 feet but were isolated and hard to contact. When successful they were good size. Leech rigs produced best with jigs a close second and spinner rigs a distant 3rd. Northerns were deep holding on mid lake structure with almost no action in weeds. Smallmouth were hard to locate and we did not spend much time on them. Musky were active in deep weeds. Our party spent only about a total of six hours fishing them and raised six fish catching one a nice 49.5 hog. Prop baits worked best followed by buck tails. Overall our boat had a 2500 fish week with only 15 over 25 and largest a fat 29.5. Numerous moose seen - this is significant since locals are in uproar over DNR cutting tags in this zone by 80%. We come this week every year and have seen increasing moose and sign each of the last four years.

That's some hardcore walleye dedication right there. Sounds like a perfect trip, and very quiet time up in that end of LS compared to the spring. Yes, the moose have been everywhere, tag reduction is just a result of poor aerial counting and lack of funding for the mnr to do their job properly. It's amazing to me that so many moose survived one of the worst winters yet up here!"
