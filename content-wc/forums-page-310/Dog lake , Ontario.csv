Maybe the fishing gets better in a more stable weather condition. One group did ok on walleyes. They caught 40 in a day. We did well on perch. The kids had a ball with that. Caught some decent northern. Not the numbers we wanted. We did poor on walleye. The lake seems overfished to me. Maybe if you spent a lot of time there you could figure it out better. Good luck.

Actually, if you find things slow, the lake trout are always willing. Just locate them in the deep and send your bait/plug/spoons down to them and they usually cooperate. Things can be slow in September but when you catch, you will catch big."
