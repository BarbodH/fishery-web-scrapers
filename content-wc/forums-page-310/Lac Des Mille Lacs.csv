Love the pictures of the huge walleyes and the terrain that accompanies them. They all seem to look like the shorelines on Lac Des Mille Lacs.I have been fishing this body of water for over 20 years and although we have never caught a pig, we sure have caught plenty of fish. We don't specifically fish northerns but they will pick up the jig and twister tail and give you a fun run for your money also. The past couple of years smallmouth have also made it into the waters. We will be making our annual trek up there leaving Green Bay Saturday morning, very, very early Saturday morning. My wife wants to know why we don't just leave Friday night . . . good question. Anyone else fish the lake??? Woodtick"

Never caught huge fish, but we always caught plenty. I just may have to go fish it again in the future. Good luck on your trip and please give us a report when you return."
1111810,Planocat,2009-06-07 23:56:00,473,I'm sure you are familiar with site on LDML. We leave Friday and should be at Pine Point on Sunday or Monday. 25 years - all at Pine Point. This link to the LDML site will put you in tune with what's happening where on the lake.http://www.lake-link.com/fishreports...ThreadID=41004

Last year our boat average for Walleye's was about 22-28"" . we had a hard time catching eaters.The troll bite was outstanding for the big fish sometimes catching doubles. If we wanted eaters we would jig for them. Just starting to get to know this big body of water, it is one of my Favorits. 28 days and counting. Can't wait."
