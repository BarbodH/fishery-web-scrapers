3024753,centralstater,2014-07-23 18:05:00,20,Anyone been up Graham Road recently? We are heading to the Bright Sand area in a week or so and was wondering how the road is? Is it dry up in that area. I think last time we were there this time of year there were burning bans on. Thanks.

They just finalized a 5 year logging contract, so the road should be maintained. It all depends on how much rain they get the week before you go. If they get a lot, the road will be rough until they get around to grading it again. Was a very wet spring and early summer at Wawang, and at lac des mille lac, where I was in June. Will be headed up Graham in fall. Have not talked with anyone that has been any further north than North Allely Lake."
