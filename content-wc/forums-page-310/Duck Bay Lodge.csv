3063953,Painter1,2014-08-05 21:50:00,26,We are headed to Sabaskong Bay and hoping to catch some smallmouth. Should I pack anything other than inline spinners and jigs with grubs?
3066009,mt hook,2014-08-06 16:06:00,65,"With the high water and never fished that part of lotw.I think I would hire chris or bill as your guide, both will go above and beyond for a client. Or just ask what type of structure there fishing. (not where there fishing)The high water makes the shore line hard to read. I was up a last week and the walleyes were all over the place. On the weed lines or on the humps.That was a week.?Ask dave he will be glade to help...Till him santa said HIPainterI left out some info. da I did well on sm with tub jigs (brown) and smaller size spinner baits throwing right under thetrees hanging over the water. That being said, best was a 20"" on a black+white spone and white twister. Go figuer. (grin)As i said above high water makes it hard to read the shore line. Med to small size boulders and shade seemed to do the trick. Skip the bait RIGHT UNDER THE TREES. or as i do some times, land it in the trees and hope it falls in.Hope this helps"
