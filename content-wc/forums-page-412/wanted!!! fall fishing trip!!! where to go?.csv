1467508,Limeyangler,2012-07-28 20:45:00,563,"All good suggestions for some good fall fishing. Just a heads up though...if its lake trout your thinking about the season closes in Zones 4 + 5 Sept 30th, and from sept 1st there is a size limit on lake trout too. brookies, rainbow and splake open all year as far as i know though"
1467558,GOBIG,2012-07-29 05:46:00,126,"Does Eddies have any openings. I wish I could get my wife to go, but then again. Call a few places, some camps are about done that time of year, they may cut you a deal."
1470205,oxdrift2,2012-08-03 14:28:00,37,"Birchdale Lodge is a good bet for your wife to be. Clean cabins with your own full bath, full kitchen and air with either propane heat or wood stove. Bar and resturant on site. 15 minutes to small town of Vermillion bay. In September the lake is not that busy. Boats are good with either a 25 or 40 hoarse Honda Motor. If you don't want to cook your own food, the American plan is great. You can order off of the resturant Menu and eat anytime that you want. Thanks for listening to me. I took my Wife and kids there and the loved it."

Send me a P.M. if you want more information."
1336375,Obabikon,2011-08-01 21:57:00,2370,"Lake of the Woods would provide all of that. www.obabikon.com is my place, but I have many resorts on the lake that I could suggest. The fall crappie fishing can be flat out amazing, and you'll get lots of walleyes and northern. With a shot at all the other species."

Pm me of you have any questions. Terry"
1336417,jiggster,2011-08-02 06:28:00,183,"If you like larger water, you might want to look at Eagle Lake Island Lodge."
1336467,Wade B AKA: Ruger2506,2011-08-02 08:27:00,5533,I would look into Pasha Lake Cabins. Chad runs a top notch operation. http://www.pashalake.com/
1336524,Mike Kansas,2011-08-02 10:11:00,1463,"Red River below dam at Selkirk, Manitoba. The river holds a lot of big Walleye in the fall. We have caught more 10 lb+ Walleye here than anyplace we go. Just Google Red River Walleye and there is plenty of info. Mike Kansas"
1336532,Guest,2011-08-02 10:26:00,0,"Eagle Lake Sportsmens Lodge!!! Eagle Lake has tons of big fish. The west arm is where this camp is located so you can still fish when its windy because there are no big open waters in that part but you also can access the big lake. I was just there last week and there were 4 40+ inch muskies caught, a few 19+ inch smallies, and tons of 20+ inch walleye. All within around 7 miles from camp and the muskies were all caught within a mile from camp or so"
1336713,Robert Cardenas,2011-08-02 18:52:00,138,"You really need to check out www.bonnybay.com this resort is located on Lake Wabigoon and has every species your looking for except the lake trout but if you wanted to get lake trout they would set you up on a lake next door. Check out the website, I have been going up there for the past 10 years and would recommend to everyone. Nice cabins with a nice price also."
