I found out that 2 of the 4 hubs on my trailer had bearings that were shot, so its been a busy day replacing all the bearings and making sure its good to go, It is my fault to wait till the last minute, but for the last 10 years I have been doing the same routine and always had good grease and was good to go. I am very thankfull to catch this before the trek. I will post a report from lac seul."
