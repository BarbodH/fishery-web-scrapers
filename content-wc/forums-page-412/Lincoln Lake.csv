1469600,wallags,2012-08-02 10:47:00,10,Headed up from Pittsburgh in a couple of weeks to fly out with Air Ivanhoe to Lincoln Lake. Any recent fishing reports or anyone who has fished it before? Can't wait to get there. Thanks!

The water is crystal clear not tea stained so you need to gear up for clear water.. There are no rivers that can be navigated. We went 2nd week in aug. & had a major cold front move in, the water temp droped 10 degrees so it pretty much shut off the walleye. Lake has good structure, if i recall we found depths into the 50' mark with rocks & shoals. Lots of coves & bays to dodge wind & waves. My big one there was a 40 1/2"" pike caught in front of camp & yes she was released!!. I spend most of the week spincasting spoons, spinner baits, husky jerks & bucktails. The cabin as all of AI's is very well equipped & had the solar power no complaints at all."
