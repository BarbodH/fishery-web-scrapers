1468382,GOBIG,2012-07-31 02:39:00,126,How is the fishing in late aug? What kinda of numbers should i expect. We fish all day. Thank you
1468383,GOBIG,2012-07-31 02:41:00,126,"What kind of numbers should we expect? I know the feeling on group falling apart. Mine, is just to **** picky. I have a buddy where i live, and from now on, it will be just him and i. Tired of trying to please everyone."

In seven days in the 90's for 3 and1/2 days and a cold spell plus thunder my boat boated 300 walleye. The construction crew that was working on the dam came out with their equipment on July 19th and the water level seemed good. I would think 2 guys in late August should do 50 fish a day if you know the lake at all.Let me know how you do, I may go up in Sept.By the way we have 8 that go up and some times it feels like you are baby sitting but all in all it still is going fine. our trouble is we are getting old.Good lick,Paul"
1468764,fisherguy,2012-07-31 18:06:00,13,I've been to biscoti lake above ramsey and i wouldn't be plannining on a 300 walleye day form my experience.
1469148,northernbite,2012-08-01 13:21:00,1186,"I think if you read my thread you'll see I STATED THAT IN 7 DAYS MY BOAT LANDED 300 WALLEYE NOT IN ONE DAY. I fish in areas where we have landed 300 in a day and Ramsey or biscoe are not those lakes. In one day back in 06 or 07 my bud and I did boat 131 one day. I never ever seen a day close to that since or before. The 40 fish aday is more like it.Still a very nice lake to visit,Paul"
