I've always just used in-line spinners, spoons, big cranks etc for Pike fishing, and of course smaller baits for smallies, and have never really checked to see how many hooks are legal to use at one time. A lot of the big Muskie baits have multiple (3) treble hooks, so I just dunnooooooooooo!!How bout it Obabikon, would you happen to know for sure???"
1387085,Pikeslayer8,2012-01-28 12:44:00,1460,"The Bama Rig as designed comes with 5 wire attachment. Ontario rules as I understand them says you may have up to 4. 4 wire rigs for Ontario are under development now. Course, you can have a dummy lure with no hook for total complience. Its what I'm going to do. I don't think you want to push the envelope with trebles, however."
1387259,Skywagon,2012-01-29 05:30:00,1106,"Interesting you brought this up. A friend from the states was telling me about those things last month, so I ordered one. Thought it might be fun to try using it for ice fishing lake trout. I have not had it out yet or really decided how to rig it, five 3 1/2 inch tube jigs with minnow might be a bit much. Can you imagine catching two lake trout at the same time with one of these? It would be a tiger by the tail. Going out for trout today, should take it, but probably wont."
1387316,a3dad,2012-01-29 09:54:00,115,How do you think the Bama rig would work jigging for eyes?
1387331,J-Man,2012-01-29 11:00:00,191,"The last time I attended a presentation with an MNR officer, this topic came up. A couple of years ago, you were limited to 3 hooks max. Whether they be trebles, singles, etc. At that time, 4 or more hooks on one rig would have been illegal. I would assume that is still the same, but don't know 100% without checking in either the regs or with an MNR official."
1387560,Skywagon,2012-01-30 05:41:00,1106,"J-Man, I had wondered about the regs also, so I looked through them before ordering the lure, could not find anything, but may have just missed it. If you hear more about it, keeps us informed, if I run into an MNR, will do the same.a3dad, my gut tells me it would not be great for walleye a lot of the time, but maybe in certain situations? It would take a different mind set and we tend to get entrenched in our old ways.If I ever get around to using it and lose it to the first Jackfish, that may be the end of the experiment."
1387695,FrankLeigh,2012-01-30 12:10:00,80,"The 2012 regulations (page 8), ""a fishing line must not have more than four hooks attached."" ""A hook includes a single-pointed, or multiple-pointed hook on a common shaft.""So, big lures with 4 trebles are OK, as are ice-fishing rigs with a 3-way spreader and a cheater."
1470080,jambi,2012-08-03 09:34:00,504,Anyone have any success this year on this rig this year? I've decided not to bother messing with one but curious how you did. Thanks
1470094,new hips,2012-08-03 09:48:00,498,"I let you know in a month, got mine rigged with 4-5in flukes.......going to try it trolling for walleye. I can't find any reason that it won't work well. Wish I had it last year for the Lakers."
