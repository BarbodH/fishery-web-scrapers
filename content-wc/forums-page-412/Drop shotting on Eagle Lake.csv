I used to come up with my first wife and really enjoyed it. Lots of good memories with Ernie, Greg and Lynn Marilynn Nickolas and the whole crew. I know the camp has changed hands , but it is still the first place I fished in Canada. One of my best memories is my 5 year old son catching a 30 inch Northern of off the dock at Birchdale at sunset. What a wonderful picture. The next week at the fish fry Greg presented him with a certificate and a frisbee and a fishing lure. Great memories.."

1470054,oxdrift2,2012-08-03 08:52:00,37,Has anyone tried Drop Shotting on Eagle Lake for Small Mouths? If so what was your results. It will be challenging but I am willing to give it a try.
1470614,Bobbajig,2012-08-04 20:21:00,24,"Going to Eagle Lake Aug. 24. I want to try a drop shot rig using a leech for walleye. I saw a video on youtube of a leech on a drop shot rig. I think it would work good for smallmouth, walleye , or northern on Eagle Lake."
1470676,oxdrift2,2012-08-05 03:24:00,37,Thanks for the tip! Have a great time.
1470768,Bobbajig,2012-08-05 09:42:00,24,"If you get up to Eagle Lake before we do, let me know if drop shotting worked. My wife and I are going up from Aug. 24-29, and are staying at Cedar Point Lodge. It will be our first time there so I hope we have good weather and can find some fish. Good luck."
1470883,oxdrift2,2012-08-05 14:47:00,37,"Going to be at Birchdale Lodge ( Around the bend from Cedar point ) September 6th-15th. Good luck , have fun and let me know how you do."
1470887,oxdrift2,2012-08-05 15:00:00,37,"Bobbajig , sent you an IM in regards to Eagle Lake. Enjoy!!!"
1470904,bigdaddyguns,2012-08-05 16:13:00,608,"Should work great. I used drop shotting on Perrault last week and caught a lot of smallmouth using a 5"" smoke rootbeer senko. I ran the dropper 18"" below the hook to give the senko more distance to flutter down. The smallmouth could not resist it. Good Luck."
1470911,oxdrift2,2012-08-05 16:29:00,37,"Thank you! Been going to Canada for 16 years, thought I would try something new. Never gets old."
1470950,Bobbajig,2012-08-05 17:42:00,24,Wish we were going to Birchdale. I have a bunch of good memories there. I used to go there with my former wife. You must have been going there when Ernie ran it . I don't know how to do IM . If possibble I will let you know how fish are biting. Have a great trip. The steaks at the Bullpit are awesome!!
1470956,NARDA 1,2012-08-05 18:06:00,636,"Bobbajig, Cedar Point is a great camp, you will have a great time. Tell Wayne (one of their guides) that Terry said hi. Oxdrift2 is one of the NARDA Guys, you should join us next year at Birch Dale."
