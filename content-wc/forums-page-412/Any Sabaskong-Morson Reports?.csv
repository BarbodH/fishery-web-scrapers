1470086,johnboat,2012-08-03 09:39:00,2014,"Was up 2 weeks ago. Was tough. Water temp was as high as I've seen. Caught fish to eat and brought home limits but had to ""Put on my big boy pants."" This trip was more of a family boating/tubing/beaching thing. So I may not be your best judge. Although I would run out in the mornings before the cabin woke up. Deeper the better. Weather was calm and sunny, which didn't help out the fishing."
1470155,lakerbreaker,2012-08-03 12:28:00,253,Our trip will be pretty much the same with families and kids....We will be staying on another lake but trailering over to LOTW a few times to chase walleyes. I have heard fish are in the later patterns already and plan on fishing deep it sounds like...
1470210,J-Man,2012-08-03 14:41:00,191,Talked to a guide this morning that has been getting walleyes on the sand in 15-20 feet of water.
1470223,Guest,2012-08-03 15:11:00,0,"Was up last week. Fishing was tougher than usual. Walleye were 20-22"" and minnows outperformed crawlers although because I brought a flat I refused to use minnows and caught plenty. Muskies were slower for us too but we caught some big ones. Rocks outperformed weeds. Good luck and have fun."
