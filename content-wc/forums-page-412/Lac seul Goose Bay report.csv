1470502,btmbncr,2012-08-04 12:33:00,492,"Got on the computer in the office.So far fishing has been world class.The last 2 days have been spent in Mc Kenzie Bay fishing wind blown reefs off islands and the Sand Banks.Friday we had way over a 100 fish day,big fish was 25 inches,about 30 slot fish,lots of fish16 to 18 inch fish.Bottom bouncers,spinners or a hook and bead with 1/2 crawler or leech have been the hot setup.We have fished the same island for 2 days and just hammered walleyes.Thursday same island,more real big fish,25 inches and better.They started in 16 feet of water and when the wind died and it got bright,hot and clear skies the big walleyes moved into 9 to 10 feet of water on top of the rocks.It was nuts for about 2 hours with big walleyes.The fish on the Sand Banks have been in 16 to 18 ft of water.The last 2 days we got there late in the day caught some fish and left.The bigger northerns have come from 20 plus feet of water.There are lots of small walleyes in 20 to 26 feet of water and the big northerns have been hanging around them.I don't fish for northerns on purpose. I haven't fished in Steamboat yet.I know there have been some fish caught there but Mc Kenzie has been better.Going to run past Manitoba Point and fish some of the main lake islands and reefs.The wind has been out of a different direction everyday.We just fished where the wind is blowing in on that side of the reef or point. Bought a new propellor in Ear Falls this morning.Not all the rocks are marked on the Navionics chip,hit one last evening and ran back from Mc Kenzie Bay at 6 mph. Wednesday went blueberry picking,my wife and I picked 2 gallons of berries in about 2 hours.We have fresh blueberry pancakes for breakfast.Theres tons of berries still ripening here.Been eating wild raspberries also.Saw a cow moose up close yesterday,no bears yet though. The cabins are clean,with comfortable beds,the staff bends over backwards to help you have a great experience here.I brought my own boat but the camp boats are really nice. If I were coming to Lac Seul now I'd bring a flat of crawlers and pick up a pound of leeches.1 1/2 oz and 2 oz bottom bouncers,#4 hook with a Chartruese,Pink,orange,green or glow bead.Hammered silver and gold colorado spinners in #3 and#4 size with chartruese,orange,geen and pink beads.Short leaders,30 inches max. Got to go pick more berries with my beautiful bride and dog Tuffy.Later.Bill"

Tell me about your boat! I'm toying with the idea of getting a guide and try McKenzie next year. Keep the reports coming, say hi to Andrea!"
