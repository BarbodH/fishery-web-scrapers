1470456,octanehi5,2012-08-04 09:46:00,1104,"just your luck its a blue moon the end of this month.Its still a great idea to have some type of contact if someone gets lost at night or motor dies, If you are within the 1 mile they will work to help out. I rather be caught with them than without"

1470111,SinOrSwim,2012-08-03 10:31:00,1528,"Anybody have really good walkie talkies that have a long range but don't cost $100 per pair? We have always taken them but for the most part we fish in same general area. But, with 6 boats this year the talkies might be more important?Thanks"
1470123,oxdrift2,2012-08-03 10:49:00,37,"A couple of quys in our group tried these. They worked but in the end they opted to get a temporary sim card for their phones through a Canadian phone store. As long as their is service, they work and you don't get screwed as you do if you used your phone with your States plan."
1470142,octanehi5,2012-08-03 11:32:00,1104,"having two way talkies is a good idea, for safety you all will not be on the water at the same times"
1470160,wallydave,2012-08-03 12:44:00,2151,"I had some older, almost 20yrs old walkies, only good for a couple of miles, for this years, and future trips, I now have a pair of 36 mile Midland walkies. Rechargable, camo, and lots of features, that I wont ever use, but I gottem! They have been great for boat to boat and boat to cabin communication. Next year it will just be my wife and I fo the early morning trips will be solo, when she wakes up and is ready I can motor back to camp for lunch and some afternoon trolling/exploring! Sure they are not cheap, but they sure come in handy and they can last for several trips, in the long run you'll be glad you packed them!"
1470172,JayM5209,2012-08-03 13:32:00,1050,"SinOrSwim, I don't think they make what you're looking for. My group has been taking walkie talkies to Canada for years. We always have them in the boats and in the trucks when traveling. After a variety of brands and price ranges, I don't think we've ever gotten a maximum range of more than a mile and a half or so. We actually use them more during the convoy north and back than we do in the boats.There's an interesting article on different kinds of radios and their capabilities here: http://www.techwholesale.com/two-way...drF0ADA#uhfvhf It points out that manufacturers can claim distances over which the unit will communicate based on what might be possible when all variables align to give absolutely ideal conditions. However, the distance you can expect for consistent results with FRS units in normally encountered real world environments is about 1 to 1.5 miles.I always have one in the boat when fishing with a group, but I really don't expect to reach out more than about a mile . . . . . if there are no trees, hills, or other obstructions between me and the other boat."
1470185,phishfearme,2012-08-03 13:48:00,1242,"we have them with us most all the time - for flyin outpost cabins they're a good piece of insurance. across open water we've gotten more than 5 miles range - our's were advertised as 30 mile range - don't believe it - but you should do MUCH better than one mile. there's some tricks to getting max range. - always broadcast from a spot with LOTS of water around you if you can. - range will be radically decreased if there's intervening trees especially if they're near you and the receiver is on the other side of the trees - get into the open water - the signal has a better chance of going over the trees - stand up in your boat when broadcasting and receiving. these are ""line of sight"" devices and every bit of elevation helps - don't hold the talkies right up at your mouth - hold them away 6 inches or so and don't yell (to close to your mouth results in overmodulation and garbled broadcast. - and of course - fresh batteries help alot phish"
1470196,wallydave,2012-08-03 14:10:00,2151,"Phish has some good tips! speak very slowly, short yes no kinds of conversations work best! The best range we got with ours this year was around 3-4 miles, both on the road and the lake."
1470257,lcwhit,2012-08-03 17:09:00,104,"i've got a pair. not much good on lac seul. too many islands and trees. mine is supposed to be 36 miles. don't believe it. direct line of sight, ok. anything in between. no way."
1470282,1860Angler,2012-08-03 18:56:00,2642,"I gave up on walkie talkies. Everyone in our group has Marine Radios now and we all use the same channel that the outpost or resort uses, it just seems to works a lot better, on LOTW there are to many islands and the range on everything we tried was poor. I feel a lot safer with a marine radio as well."
