1468426,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-07-31 06:58:00,235,"As a student pilot and someone who loves fly in fishing, I always read up on accidents and how they happened. There is very little to find online about this crash. The news stories have the most minimal information. I imagine that there will be a government report that details the causes of the crash, but that investigation is ongoing and I think those take a while to prepare. My heart goes out to everyone affected by this crash. I hope the victims had a minimal amount of suffering. I hope Air Cochrane can learn from it and move on."
1468453,CSH Kucinski,2012-07-31 07:53:00,1340,We were there a week and a half after the crash and did not find out about it until after we got home. All was in order while there and no issues with flying from what we experienced. I expect that it will be quite some time before the report comes out as you state Ten Horse. I'm curious how the overall business is doing.
1468482,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-07-31 08:50:00,235,"I'd say that's pretty remarkable that you didn't even hear about it. It's understandable that they would want to keep a lid on it. You have to applaud them for being able to continue on and keep their game face. I would imagine that a tragedy like this is HORRIBLE for business. Many people already are leery of small planes, and something like this will confirm that bias. I imagine (or at least hope) that their loyal customers will stick with them, but for people who are shopping around for a fly in and who find out about this, it may sway them elsewhere. It will be interesting to see the accident report. As far as I know, the plane was landing but got flipped by wind. Was it a crosswind? Headwind? Tailwind? Were they flying in conditions that were beyond the recommended limits of the aircraft? Was the pilot experienced in these types of conditions? Was the pilot fatigued? Sometimes these reports, fair or unfair, really come down hard on the owner/operator. Anything that suggests Air Cochrane was culpable/negligent could be real bad for business."

1469560,CSH Kucinski,2012-08-02 09:35:00,1340,"Pikehunters, we're already booked for next year, can't wait. Let us know how do. Good luck!"
