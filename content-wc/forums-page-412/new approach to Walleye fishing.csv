It was slow and we were discussing whether or not the area was fished out. just so happened we had some dynamite in the boat and my buddy lights a charge and drops it overboard and a bunch of fish belly up to the surface. We were gathering them up when we noticed the noise of the plane landing. The MNR officers came up next to our boat and, after checking out our beer stash began to berate us about our fishing method. my buddy had enough of it, lit another charge and handed it to the officer and said, ""Are you going to fish or continue yapping at us?""We got fined for the beer"
