1469407,Andyeye,2012-08-02 03:44:00,179,7 of us are leaving tommorrow at 5:00AM. I woke up at 3:30 this morning thinking about all the last minute details. I hope the trip goes well and the walleyes are on the reefs. We are taking 2 boys on there first trip up there and they are pretty fired up to go. How have the black flies been lately? I have the day off to get the rest of the supplies and finish loading up so I will be checking the site off and on all day. Good luck to all who are going up this weekend and be safe.

1469453,WalleyeWally28,2012-08-02 06:46:00,298,We also are leaving at 5:00 AM tomorrow. We are going to the NW section of Lac Seul. Wife and I are taking our Grandson on his 1st Canadian fishing adventure - talk about excited - his suitcase has been packed for over 2 weeks.
1469454,mrwalleye5,2012-08-02 06:50:00,1922,How have the black flies Just something I saw on another forum for a balck fly solution is to use Coppertone Sport sun block. Although not on the label apparently does a pretty decent job keeping the little biters at bay.
1469472,wallydave,2012-08-02 07:15:00,2151,"Andyeye, which camp on the NW end of LS? If your staying at Goose Bay, look uo Bill, he is a WC member, he has posted recently about some good fishing! Have a great trip with the grand kids! Make some memories that you all will treasure!! If possible, stop at Dutchies, good folks from Iowa living their dream in Ontario! We get our dry ice there for the trip home!"
