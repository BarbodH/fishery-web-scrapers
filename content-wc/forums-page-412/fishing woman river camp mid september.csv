1468922,Guest,2012-08-01 05:40:00,0,"we will be fishing woman river camp mid september for a week 33 miles miles north of ear falls plan to fish the chain and 3 portage lakes SPOT, NARROW, and SNAKEWEED appreciate comments or suggestons from fishermen who have fished the camp recently or in the past thank you jim wolf chicago boys have been told SPOT is a trophy northern lake plan to troll and cast a full day there anyone catch a fair amount of large northerns there 35"" +"
1469007,Mohleye,2012-08-01 08:30:00,368,"I think that could be a really long day. Spot has been catch and release for all species for many years, but I've never heard it referred to as a trophy northern lake. We did catch one in the 37"" range on a mepps spinner while casting for smallies. Spot has good fishing for smallmouth and walleye. We never fish intentionally for northern, so it may be better than I think, but large numbers of 35""-plus fish seems really unlikely. The lake just isn't that big. I'd bring walleye and smallmouth stuff too a small box of jigs is all you need."
1469038,Guest,2012-08-01 09:34:00,0,mohleye thanks for your help owner claims on website its a trophy northern lake (who knows) any sugestions for the portage lakes or womsn river chain for larger northerns also stated that snakeweed is walleye factory did you ever fish it?? thanks again jim wolf chicago boys

We did catch a 38 in Corliss, but its a long walk through a clearcut. good walleye there too, but you have to have jigs with bump. I have never fished narrow but it sounds great and Paul loves it. it is just a long ride. Big Woman has large pike, I caught a 41 there trolling a crankbait (rapala perch I think). Woman River is a good system, lots of water to explore. have fun and say hi to Paul and Deb from Jeff and norm."
1469138,Mohleye,2012-08-01 12:49:00,368,"Wolf, No I have not fished Snakeweed. We don't target northerns at all so I can't help you much there. Narrow is a good walleye lake but a long ways from WRC, as HHH stated."
1469572,HeHooksHimself,2012-08-02 09:51:00,725,"Wolf, We have had good luck in Snakeweed. On the shoreline to the right on the way to the incoming falls we have caught some big ones in the 26"" range. In the channel where you get the boat you can pick up plenty of eaters. The spots that Paul marks for you are productive. Paul has always told us about how good the falls out is, but we have never had any luck there (three different trips)"
