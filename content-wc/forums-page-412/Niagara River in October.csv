Have looked on the New York side but would prefer to stay on the Ontario side as we may want to drive up to Port Dalhousie for a day. I will be bringing my boat so would prefer a well lit parking lot and the ability to charge batteries at night. Thanks, David"

1468414,CSH Kucinski,2012-07-31 06:33:00,1340,"kliph,I just read Bill's article and can't believe where things are heading in regards to fishing in Canadian water. They should really focus in more on policing their commercial fisherman and let the recreational fisherman enjoy themselves. Most if not all are responsible and law abiding fisherman. If you're not, you'll eventually get caught by the DEC, Sheriff, Coast Guard, or Border Patrol/Cusotms. Last weekend my brother and I were in Canadian water and we tried to call in five or times only to have our phone conversation cutoff every time for some reason. Not sure if it was the location, my phone or theirs but we finally gave up. Could not believe the questions they were asking. Our government agencies should think about doing the same for our waters."
1468481,kliph,2012-07-31 08:42:00,2337,"I contacted my congressmen/women and senators, they have noidea what's happening. Clueless! I used to get an Ontario fishing license, not any more.I'm boycotting Canada until this is corrected."
1468788,CSH Kucinski,2012-07-31 18:43:00,1340,Who specifically did you contact? I would like to contact them too.
1468810,kliph,2012-07-31 19:24:00,2337,"Here it is: To the feds, Sen Chuck Schumer, Sen Kirsten Gillibrand and Congresswoman Kathleen Hochul. Nothing worth while came from these three, 0, zero, zip !Also New York State Senator George Maziarz.I didn't think it was a state issue, and told Maziarz that.The only semi- intelligent response was from Maziarz.Also Maziarz has called me on the phone a few times about some issues in the past. But he is only state.Good luck tiring, maybe you can articulate better than I can.The more people we have on this the better.Here is two of the E-mails:Hello Mr. MaziarzThank you for responding to my e-mail.According to the link you sent me, Canadians have to report only when they make land in the US.""When Reporting Is RequiredArrival of a vessel means the time when a vessel firstcomes to rest in U.S. waters, whether at anchor or at adock: After touching foreign soil; After having contact with a foreign vessel, or coming incontact with a vessel entering U.S. waters from foreignwaters."" A US boater must report every time they (except in transit) cross into Canadian waters.Not just making land or anchoring. This means if you are drifting or trollingin Canadian waters you must report. The laws are not the same for both sides.As I said in our phone conversation, I'm not sure what can be done locally.I have not received a response from our federal senators.Thank you for your time.CliffDear Cliff: Thank you for the response to my last email. The purpose of my last email was to show you that there are penalties Canadian boaters can face for not reporting to the US authorities. However, I completely agree with you that the Canadian laws are more strict and unfair to U.S. citizens. I will continue to urge my federal colleagues in Congress and US Customs and Border Patrol to take a tougher stance until the Canadians stop their aggressive actions. Thanks again for bringing this issue to my attention and please let me know if I can ever be of any assistance to you in the future. George D. MaziarzSenator, 62nd District"
1468937,Shellback,2012-08-01 06:20:00,8083,"Sounds like the law is just common sense. If you lose your GPS and have no paper chart or compass, you s**t out of luck. I'd bet 70% of money spent on rescues is due to people without common sense."
1468953,rebs,2012-08-01 06:51:00,7587,"In the old days it was no big deal to have a Canadian boat in US waters in border water areas like the Great lakes and the river. But not anymore- since Canadian boats have to have the new special US Customs ""decal""- or they get stopped and ticketed- or worse. The decal is now required by US Customs, which is now separate from US Immigration. It costs $25 and must be bought yearly and stuck on your boat to avoid a ticket. Even worse, the first time my buddy ordered his, he bought it in December- but it didn't show up until the following September- screwing up a trip or two. he found that the only way to guarantee getting the decal is to order and pay a $15 expediting fee to Customs. Thus, the US is essentially taxing Canadian boats that come over here $40 per boat per year- and yes- the Canucks are pissed off. Even worse, if you come across with the decal affixed and land on US soil, you still have to call US Immigration from their cute little video phones- except the video phones are all broken, so you have to call a person and read to them all the passport info for you and your passengers- after you wait for a free operator. Then they tell you to stay with your boat until an Immigration officer shows up- which can take several hours. After hearing this- I understand why the Canadian's are retaliating. I saw the ""decal""- and it's a little 2 inch square POS with US Customs and a serial number on it."
1469006,Mark Komo,2012-08-01 08:25:00,867,"I havent had any problems with the canadians at all. When I hit their waters, I call CANPASS ( 1 888 226 7277), and quickly register. I have 2 gps units, my nice Niagara Fishing map, and a couple of Hotspots maps. Probably all of them are useless to the canadian federales. Most of my fishing is between Abino to Peace Bridge on Canada waters and Peace bridge to sturgeon on the US side. I can point out a few different ports, so probably ok."
