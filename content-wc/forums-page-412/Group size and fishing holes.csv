You also hear about multiple boats being on certain ""hot spots"" at times. It made me wonder about the size of other groups and how close you fish to each other. Our group has generally been a few boats and we stay mainly in the same area. This year our group is quite a bit larger and we will have to split up. So how many people are in your group and do you fish by each other or go your separate ways?"
1469914,wallydave,2012-08-02 21:17:00,2151,"We have had as many as four boats in our group, but for the last several trips it has been just two boats. Sometimes one boat heads out first to check out the usual spots. The second boat will try another spot. With our walkies we can meet at which one is holding fish, or we can meet to try another spot. Using the walkies saves time and gas!"
1470009,camp chef,2012-08-03 07:34:00,915,When our group has several boats we always try to give each other plenty of room. We spend plenty of time together when not on the water.Most days we won't see each other until lunch and then again at the end of the day.
1470048,Bigstorm,2012-08-03 08:35:00,799,"we have always had at least 2 boats in our group, sometimes 3 boats. We always fish within 50 to 100yrds of each other and sometimes we even tie the boats together and fish. Where we fish, there is 30miles of river going between 15 lakes so we stay togther for the most part. Occasionally we do separate, but we always know where each other are going"
1470055,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-08-03 08:53:00,235,"We fish a roundish shaped fly in lake with many small islands. It's about three miles long by three miles wide. We separate and agree to meet back at camp at specific times for meals. Occasionally we will be fishing in a same general area, but rarely are we close enough to talk without the walkies. Personally, I like a bit of both. It's fun to go explore and try spots without having to decide by committee. But it's also fun when you are close by with friends on everyone is catching fish, trash talking etc."
1470102,1860Angler,2012-08-03 10:07:00,2642,"We usually 2-4 boats, we split up in the morning and find the fish, call on the radio move to the boat that is on fish, if we're all on fish we stay apart. If we are together and the fishing slows down, we do the same thing separate and find the fish, call on the radio and move to where the fish are. We usually make it a competition of some sort, it's fun fishing next to the other boats in your group. Now fishing next to boats that are not in your group, not so much!! In Canada there is to many good places to fish to have to fight for a fishing hole!! We usually all do lunch together and head in at around the same time in the evening. Ahhhhh, good times!!"
