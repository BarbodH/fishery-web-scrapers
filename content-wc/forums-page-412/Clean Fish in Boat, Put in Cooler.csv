1469477,wallydave,2012-08-02 07:20:00,2151,"On Lac Seul, as far as I know, the fish you keep have to be dead, but not filleted. Other lakes may have different rules. I'd rather be in compliance, than hope the CO's is having a good day and look the other way!"
1469516,Bill Krejca,2012-08-02 08:22:00,6107,"Thanks for the input, guys. I think the hypothetical fisherman will just gill and gut any lake trout he keeps in warm weather from now on! Bill"
1469693,dkrusin,2012-08-02 14:21:00,97,"Really..... The fish that you catch and keep may be cleaned. However, please remember that fish taken from waterbodies where size limits are in effect must be readily measurable at all times, unless the fish are:Being prepared for immediate consumptionPrepared at an overnight accommodation for storageBeing transported on the water from a temporary overnight accommodation to your residence and you are not engaged in sport fishingBeing transported overland."
1469091,Hawkfan,2012-08-01 11:09:00,237,What is the correct way to do shore lunch? Carcasses on the shore ok? If you keep them in the boat what do you do back at camp? They have to go somewhere right? What do you do legally at an outpost?
1469118,Mike Kansas,2012-08-01 11:56:00,1463,We have always just left them on the shore at shore lunch. Makes a nice lunch for the Gulls. At the outpost we go to we take them over to an island and once again the Gulls and Eagles have a feast. At the outpost them main reason they go to the island is to prevent Bear problems. Mike Kansas
1469126,NathanH,2012-08-01 12:24:00,697,"I used to fish Superior with my family for many years when we caught lakers we would gut and gill them out so the head and everything else is still in place. Then toss em in the cooler, you should have no problem with this method and the fish stays fresh."
1469178,plumberjoe,2012-08-01 14:33:00,54,I got a ticket for this exact thing a couple of years ago. We did our shore lunch and cleaned more than we could eat so we left the skin on and put them in the cooler. On our way back to camp we got checked. We had 3 walleyes in possesion and 3 guys in the boat and no fish in camp. Ended up costing us $100 because they couldn't measure the fish. We paid our fine right away and wrote it off as a leason learned.
1469215,Golden Eagle,2012-08-01 15:37:00,2642,What lake were you fishing?
1469248,lcwhit,2012-08-01 16:43:00,104,i have always wondered why you cannot dispose of head and guts back into the water they come from. cannot quite understand that thinking. usually lots of meat left on a filleted fish. food for other aquatic species.
1469264,Campcountry,2012-08-01 17:26:00,164,"The Ontario fishing guide says nothing about disposing fish remains in the water that I can see. It used to say not to dispose of remains on shorelines but I can't seem to find that anymore. There are a couple of bulletins that suggest not disposing or remains in the water because of the chance of spreading fish viruses and the like. Nothing in the regs though that I can see. In Manitoba, the regs say you can't dispose of remains on beaches and shorelines. Nothing about disposing of remains in the water."
1469310,J-Man,2012-08-01 19:30:00,191,"A few years back, one of our guests received a ticket for a northern he had filleted at shorelunch and had on ice to bring back to camp to freeze. He was not aware of the regulation and at that time, I'm not sure I knew of it either. Gut and gill, leave in tact on Lake of the Woods at least."
1469430,CSH Kucinski,2012-08-02 05:36:00,1340,"When fishing outposts in Canada, we have always been told by the Outfitter to clean the fish on shore and dump the carcasses and all other remains out in the lake. Reason is they don't want a bear problem near the camps. Never have they told us that it is illegal to do that."
1469441,mrwalleye5,2012-08-02 06:17:00,1922,"In Manitoba the fishing guide states that fish remains cannot be left on shorelines and beaches. The lakes that I fish, although very accessible, do not have fish cleaning facilities. Standard equipment in my boat is a rubber mat and a cutting board. I fillet the fish and dispose of the remains into the lake. I have been checked by CO's as I have pulled the boat out of the water. I have had to pull them out of a bag and divide them up into two fillets per fish but but no probelm. When fishing at Nipawin, Saskatchewan ( Tobin Lake) the fish filleting shack has a giant garbarator that grinds the fish remains up and pipes them right back into the river. When out on Pine Falls ( Lake Winnipeg) in the fall, soon as your knife hits the first fish the sea gulls are there immediately although a minute earlier not one is in sight. Common practice."
1468828,Bill Krejca,2012-07-31 19:43:00,6107,"If someone in a boat hypothetically cleans a lake trout and puts the fillets in a cooler with ice to prevent spoilage in the livewell, is this allowed in Ontario? Because the length cannot be established after cleaning, would this be considered an infraction? What if the fillets in the cooler totaled a limit? It could seem a little ""iffy"" re: the wordings as to ""just prior to eating"", or ""taking home."" What are the chances this hypothetical person could be breaking the law?? Do you get my gist? There is obviously not a question if the fish remain whole, but does cleaning present a problem? Should be some interesting replies. Bill Krejca"
1468833,Jimmy Jig,2012-07-31 19:49:00,1905,I wouldn't do it. Gill and gut them and then put in the cooler.
1468834,Juls,2012-07-31 19:49:00,13414,"I'm thinking you have to have the carcasses on board, since I don't know of any lake (US or Canada) that allows dumping the carcasses in the lake. I believe it's against the law. I could be wrong about Canada, but that's how it is here in the states. Juls"
1468853,v-bay gord,2012-07-31 20:15:00,3168,If there are size restrictions (ie slot sizes) then obviously cleaning the fish does not allow for the size to be checked by a C.O.
1468950,Stu,2012-08-01 06:45:00,472,"I addressed this issue personally several years ago on Wabby after I had a laker spoil. I even put it in a cooler, but it didn't help. The lodge owner told me that I should have cleaned it when I caught it. It's been a while, but I don't think there was a slot restriction. If you keep the carcass, you would be able to confirm the length. In my ""limited experience"" with Conservation Officers, they seem to be pretty flexible when you are doing your best to obey the law."
1468990,Mike Kansas,2012-08-01 08:02:00,1463,"Jimmy has the right approach. That is what I have done on several occasions and it works well for meat preservation and will make the Warden happy to. I do keep the removed parts in a Ziploc bag so there are no questions about throwing them in the lake. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1469002,Mohleye,2012-08-01 08:19:00,368,"I'm not aware of any restrictions on throwing fish carcasses in the lake. We clean fish for shore lunch all the time, but we throw the carcasses on land and the gulls make short work of them. I've also filleted fish for supper or take home on the lake before and have had a CO tell me not to do it anymore. I made sure that the total we had was no more than 1 fish per person, so technically they could have been any length and there was no reason to need to verify that they were under the slot (although that's all we keep). But trying to explain that starts to sound like splitting hairs, and I have no desire to start an argument with a CO, so I didn't push the point. A lake trout I would gill and gut."
1469045,Obabikon,2012-08-01 09:38:00,2370,"You aren't allowed to throw fish guts into the lake. I wouldn't do it, but if you do clean the fish... keep the carcasses"
1469047,Golden Eagle,2012-08-01 09:41:00,2642,Guessing you've never met Don Maw in the Red Lake District. Zero flexibility for that boy.
1469058,hoppy63,2012-08-01 10:12:00,367,"Juls, just got back from salmon trip in NY on lake ontario. The way i understand it, it is ILLEGAL to cut fish on shore. They all clean them on board, then feed the gulls. In fact for tourny we left biggest fish whole to bring in to weigh, then they had to take boat back out on lake to clean fish and dispose carcass."
