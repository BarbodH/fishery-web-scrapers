1469798,MorganMan,2012-08-02 17:28:00,341,"DownriverbobI know that one of those bridges has been closed or had construction recently, but don't know the status today?? I know that the bridge from 33 to 53 is closed and a small little detour gets you onto 53. It's just a little reroute onto the south 53 lane and then a cross onto northbound lanes so no big deal. Then there is a very short little 2 way traffic on 53 north of Cotton as they work on a small river/creek bridge so no biggie there either. Rest of the way is clear to I falls....I am there this week. Have a good trip."

I am pretty sure there is construction on the Blatnik Bridge, but wasn't sure about other areas. I know about a couple areas heading to International Falls, one I can go around. Thanks again, BOB"
1470128,Fishin Fun,2012-08-03 11:00:00,218,You can go to 511mn.org and find out too. I was looking today because I leave in about 4 hours and travel 35 up to 33 and 53. Looks like the bridge is still out north of Cloquet for the next 2 weeks. A couple other areas are showing road construction projects/single lane/etc.
