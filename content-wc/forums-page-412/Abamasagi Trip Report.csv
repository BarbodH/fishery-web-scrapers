1469545,mroyle,2012-08-02 09:04:00,74,"Just returned from our 7/21-7/28 trip to Abamasagi. Flew in with Nakina Air through Chad at Twin Lakes Outfitters. Good and on-time flights with Nakina Air & we had nice visits with Chad prior to our morning departure & upon our return to Nakina. Nakina Air provided a Tuesday check flight at which time propane supply and gas for motors was checked and replenished. Cabin #3 provided everything we needed with good propane fridges(2) and stove, solar lights with a generator for backup, a BBQ, a great ice house, and fish cookers with primo cast iron skillets. There is a second smaller ""sleep"" cabin that we did not use. It has bunks for an additional 4-6 guys and also houses the 2nd fridge. The boats were in good shape as were the 9.9 Mercs. The weather was atypical with bright sunshine and 80 degree weather everyday....never donned the rainsuits! A couple days were pretty windy in the afternoons that kicked up the lake a bit but most days were pretty calm with light breezes. My son and I have been doing trips together for a little over 20 years; since he was nine. We've done a combo of outposts as well as small fly-in lodges so have a good bit of experience and have kept pretty good records. On to the fishing: The two of us caught just over 400 Walleyes for the week and about 60 Northerns. Two others accompanied us and hauled in about 250 Walleyes and 40 Northerns. My son and I fished a little harder than the other two. Biggest Walleye of the trip was 28 inches. Interestingly we caught this fish a few miles down the river. Biggest pike was just over 40 inches. Total number of Walleyes over 20 inches was only 19. Lots in the 17-19 inch range. Pike were on the small side with only about 6 or 7 over 26 inches: the one 40 incher and one 32 inches. We fished exclusively for Walleye mostly with jig/twister tail tipped with a crawler. Did some trolling with Hot N Tots to locate fish and then mostly jigged. Although 400 W's for the two of us sounds like a lot, this was some of the toughest fishing we've had. We fished 8-10 hours/day and admittedly were not up and at 'em early and also were back at camp most nights by 8:00 to put the feedbag on. Fish most nights with Taters, onions, and creamed corn. Our totals per day ranged from a low of 30 to a high of just over 100. Most fish were caught in 7-10 FOW on wind-blown points/islands or adjacent to the many weeds in the lake. Seems like we'd catch 4-5 fish in a spot & have to move on. We did find 3-4 spots that were more productive and yielded quite a few fish. These were on the far end of the lake so required about a 30 minute ride. All in all a fantastic trip with great weather, pretty good fishing(guess I'm spoiled), unbelievable scenery, and good company...not to mention a few tasty cold ones! PM me if you'd like any additional info."
