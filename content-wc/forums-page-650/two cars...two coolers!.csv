This is not a new >action, and probably will not go away. It's called the Lacey Act (not sure if I spelled it correctly). It makes sense because not only does the US have a right to enforcement on the ""over the limiters"", but they can also call the Canadian authorities in to get their piece of the pie. Follow the rules or get burned. It is in some ways applicable for those bringing illegal drugs across the border. BTW, we got checked as well. I was happy to see it. The USFWS Agents were very courteous and acted like law enforcement people are supposed to be...educational."

Now that I got a ticket, I guess I have no one to be mad at but myself. I would recommend anyone traveling in Canada or any state respect their game laws, and that would include traveling with fish correctly. They have done a far better job protecting their resource than we have done in the US (I think we are finally waking up). Although it is inconvenient, I was checked on the water three consecutive fishing outings in Minnesota this spring. I was happy to the the DNR protecting our resource. I will celebrate the day we start regular road side checks in Minnesota. Plan ahead, do the right thing, and have a good time."

566097,Guest,2007-06-08 10:14:00,0,I told this story last fall. We got stopped by Minn. DNR as we came back to US side. All fish for 6 guys in one cooler. 2 vehicles and the other had already passed customs. The DNR let me try to call them to come back. No answer. I told DNR the rest of group at Border Bob's waiting for us. He drove me to them and asked that they come back. They did and checked all 6 licenses & counted fish. We were legal but should have split fish between vehicles. We got a lecture and I got a warning ticket with no fine. The were very professional and polite. I learned my lesson!
565784,Guest,2007-06-01 10:44:00,0,"Yep....we got called on this last year. Two vehicles and all fish were with my dad and I, and we were right behind the other vehicle in our group. We got the lecture but they let us go. We split them up now!"

565848,wooglin,2007-06-01 20:57:00,371,"I don't want to sound like an @ss or anything, but why would you NOT seperate your fish limits to go with the guys taking them? I've never, NEVER, considered taking more in my vehicle than the amount of passengers in it. Common sense tells me that I take no more than the amount of people (bag limit) in my truck. I guess I can't understand why people would consolidate all fish into one vehicle, and yet drive in multiple vehicles. Simple as that, it's against the law. Ignorance is not an excuse. Neither are assumptions."
565852,Guest,2007-06-02 04:48:00,0,"I remember preparing to leave Canada and learned the fish were in one of our two vehicles while traveling in Canada. I insisted the fish be divided into coolers for each vehicle and the limits for the people in the vehicles. We were stopped and checked and all was OK. A few blocks over the border we divided the fish the way we wanted with the licenses traveling with the fish to the final destination. If your going to divide after crossing, I suggest doing it out of sight of customs, etc. I think it unlikely that Minnesota or another state will check your car on your way home. If you stay at a lake cabin on the way home or are involved in a traffic accident your chances of being checked will go up."
565874,5thsuit,2007-06-03 07:37:00,54,"We have kept our fish seperate since they told us the same thing 15 years ago. This year however we were stopped an hour south of Ear Falls in one of their fish checks where they stop all cars on the highway. This year we were told all fish must be flat and in seperate bags. We had 4 walleye(4 bags) for 2 people and 17 perch in 4 bags, I generally put the perch in bags of 5. Well I was told he could fine us on the spot for this but he wouldnt if we seperated our frozen fish. It bothered me to unthaw my perch, but I should have known the Canadian game laws. However when he made me break apart each individually bagged walleye, ""because they were not Flat"" and the bag of 2 perch because ""there could be a walleye fillet hidden inside"" Give me a break, this guy was just being an ####. Oh and while he had us do this he walked 30 feet out of sight where he could shoot the breeze with his buddy. None of the walleye were over 18 inches. I have made 35 trips to Canada in the last 23 years and this is my first Bad experience. I have often wondered why so many of my friends are now fishing Minnesota and South Dakota because they refuse to go North again!"
565875,Guest,2007-06-03 08:28:00,0,"I have stopped taking fish home. First, it is a hassle, the freezing, the space required, and the attitude that you are trying to sneak uranium or anthrax across the border. it is easier to get in and out of China. Secondly, fish is relatively inexpensive in the grand scheme of things. Better for me to keep just what I will eat while at camp, take pictures. I'm not trying to be preachy and don't fault others who would like to be able to have a few fish at home. The idea for me is relaxation and relief from stress. I do not want to engender more angst than necessary. For me, keep it simple, enjoy the fact you can ""borrow"" time in this beautiful country. LIfe is too short to argue in the woods about how many fillets should go in how many bags in how many cars."
565878,Jimmy Jig,2007-06-03 09:33:00,1905,"5thsuit, after 35 trips to Canada you should have read the regulations at least once in all those years!"
565879,FISHNBOWLJOE,2007-06-03 10:40:00,80,Years ago I used to fish Pelican Lake in Orr Minnesota. (About 50 or 60 miles south of IF) The Minnesota DNR sometimes had a check station set up on 53 between there and Duluth. So to be on the safe side I would keep your fish separated until you get home. Joe
565882,Old Critter,2007-06-03 14:51:00,14,"I have been fishing Canada fifty years. Was stopped at a roadblock in Canada about twenty-five years ago with all the fish in one truck with the second truck right behind. I received the same lecture as other posters and let go. Ever since the fish have been split up and we've have been stopped twice since. IMO you can't be in possesion of more fish than allowed. If you have all the fish in one vehicle, you are in possesion of too many fish. I understand the citation. By the way, the fish cannot be in a frozen bundle. They must be packaged in a way that permits separate counting. It's the law and makes sense to me."
565883,5thsuit,2007-06-03 15:51:00,54,Jimmy Jag somehow I think you and that kindly man at the road block have a lot in common!
565800,Fred_G,2007-05-31 15:29:00,908,"We had this happen last year at the border. Minnesota DNR was checking Canadian licenses and limits. We were in three cars, one of which had been waved on ahead. The coolers containing the fish were in the other two cars. Long story short, we ended up over the limit for the number of licenses we had resulting in fines totaling about $250 and the confiscation of the over limit fish. It seemed like a real scam by the MN DNR to raise some funds. I will say that the officers were professional and courteous at all times but it still didn't make sense to me."

565801,2746,2007-05-31 16:33:00,3206,Not sure it makes sense to me either but I guess the real lesson is a seperate cooler in each truck and license to support the fish you have.

565805,Guest,2007-05-31 19:07:00,0,strange isnt it. coming back into the states it was allways the us border guards that wanted to know the fish count etc. never asked for licenses just how many fish. like hey buddy we are in the U.S. now. if we were over would i tell them that. what about self incrimination? if the canadians were concerned they would have stopped and asked us. get a life!

565775,Guest,2007-06-01 07:30:00,0,I kind of understand getting checked at the border for fish and other things. My question is for being stopped 1hr south of IF. If you have a minnesota fishing license and are not transporting more fish than legal. What could the MN DNR do if you showed them your MN license and not your Canadian license?

565714,2746,2007-05-30 14:58:00,3206,"Been going to Canada for 30 years and in that time have been stopped 4 times on the way back to check number of fish. Two of these were road stops coming out of Red Lake and two were at the border. We always have 6 guys and use two trucks and pack the fish in one cooler. This year we were stopped at the border and the US DNR guy got all six of us together, gave us a lecture and made us seperate the fish into two coolers, one in each vehicle. He was nice enough about it and I understand his logic....just thought I'd pass along the info. Said he could have fined us and I expect he could have."
565715,back357,2007-05-30 15:04:00,106,"Happened to me as well. Have to say that they were nice enough to let us off and ever since then, we have heeded their warning. Split it up."
565716,Guest,2007-05-30 15:32:00,0,"put all the licences in a plastic bag inside the cooler. doesnt matter how many guys are in the vehicle. if fish count matches licence count, no problem.. fish on.. bender ouuuut!!!"
565729,Bill Krejca,2007-05-30 20:00:00,6107,"In Manitoba, the person must be with the fish, says so in the law literature, not real easy to misinterpret."

565742,2746,2007-05-31 12:03:00,3206,Had not thought about it until now but who would have been checking our fish? I didn't pay any attention but we had already been passed through border inspection and were asked (I assumed randomly chosen) to pull over and have our fished checked. It was at that time I told them we had fish for 6 guys and had the second group join us. They appeared to be U.S. officers but I did not look at thier uniforms to identify if DNR or Border patrol. Why would US officers be checking Canada fish limits?
565748,Guest,2007-05-31 13:46:00,0,"We got pulled over one time about an hour south of IF on the way back. MN DNR checked our Canadian fishing licenses, AND our camping tickets. Not sure they could have done anything, but you know those guys: always want to keep you on your toes."

When was the last time the ONTario DNR ever enforced a U.S. fish laws. That's right ...NEVER. U.S. authorities should keep their U.S. paid noses out of Canada's enforcement problems. God know the U.S. has enough problems of its own to attend.
