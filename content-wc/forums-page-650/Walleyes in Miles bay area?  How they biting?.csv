566168,1shooter,2007-06-11 17:00:00,1493,Just got back from there today. The fish were biting very well. caught most of mine on minnows but the other boats in my group did well with crawlers. As far as the lake levels. I had heard prior to the trip it was way down in the 3 feet range but to me in didn't seem like it was down that much.

566177,1shooter,2007-06-11 20:23:00,1493,"Yes we did and it was no problem and I have a 1850 sportfish. We caught a fair amont of northerns back there but nothing of any size. I believe the biggest was 28"". When we were walleye fishing my wife had a nice northern hooked that I bet went at least 40"" but it snapped the line."
