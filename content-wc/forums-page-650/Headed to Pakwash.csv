566027,OHIOPILOT,2007-06-06 19:13:00,19,Headed up to Pakwash this weekend for week long fishing trip with my life partner AL. Looking forward to having a fabulous time soaking up the sun and relaxing with some daquiris. Any of you guys have any TIPS for us? What time does the Red Lake golf course open on the weekend? Where do the local miners like to hang out? Hows the humidity? (not a huge fan of sweating)

Don't worry about the humidity and sweating. The weather looks to be in the mid-60's and possibly low-70's. Fishing on Pakwash has been good. People fishing near the camp ground area have been doing well. Enjoy your trip."
