566084,Trailerguy,2007-06-07 17:15:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]They generally don't bother you with a ""reasonable"" amount of boat gas. How much is reasonable? I've never been bothered, with as much as 5 6 gal tanks. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
566087,VMS,2007-06-07 20:05:00,1103,"I called customs/border patrol on this as well. As long as it is considered reasonable, they cannot charge duty. If you plan on burning 10 gallons a day, then figure that in. Now if you had a 6hp motor and planned on running 10 gallons a day, they might raise an eyebrow at that.. Steve"
