566130,Guest,2007-06-10 17:09:00,0,I am going to the Gouin Reservoir in two weeks and was just wondering if anyone knows what the water level is like this year?

On our 2 previous trips we had low water levels on one trip and high levels the next time. The water levels didn't seem to affect the Walleye bite or areas where they were concentrated."
566170,Guest,2007-06-11 17:54:00,0,Hi Seanik; I will be staying with Cargair( they have sold this year and I can't remember who bought them) from June 23-30. This will be my third year in a row fishing this part of the Gouin(East Bay).The water level has been fairly steady but the other guys I am going with have been going there for years and were there in 2003 with very low water levels and had their best year ever. I think the fish are more concetrated and made fishing easier. Thanks for the reply and I hope you have a great trip.
