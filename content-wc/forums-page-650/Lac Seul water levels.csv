566106,Guest,2007-06-09 09:27:00,0,water down 4-5 feet but rising very fast. Lots of rain over past 2 weeks. fishing is always good but very weather (front) dependant.
566107,Guest,2007-06-09 10:33:00,0,What part of the lake did you fish? Where did you stay?
566112,tlars,2007-06-09 19:22:00,137,"I just got home also. We were at Evergreen the last week in May. We had a rain of biblical proportions from Monday night through Tuesday evening. A coffee can in the open filled to the top. While we were there the water in the stream flowing into Lac Seul came up at least 1 1/2 ft. Beached boats were floating loose in the night. Many of the exposed rockpiles on the lake disappeared. Unfortunately on Sunday evening I connected with a rock pile at 31 mph. That cost me a new lower unit on Monday morning. We were back on the lake by 1:00 PM. I almost had a stroke when I saw the invoice ('05 75 hp Etech). Ok fishing, not great for us. 50 to 60 fish days with sizes not up to Lac Seul standards. The previous week brought 3 cold fronts. One more the week we were there. Water temp was 49 when we got there on the main lake - no higher than 53 in any of the bays we fished. Water temp increased to 51 on the main lake by the time we left. Had a great time with our youngest daughter, her husband and our granddog Buster. 357 days to go."
