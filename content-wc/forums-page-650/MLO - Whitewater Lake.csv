566073,kbkakes,2007-06-07 12:19:00,49,Greetings to all Its been great reading these posts again. Been awile since I posted myself. Been thinking of trying a different spot in 2008 and am curios if any of you guys been to or know of anyone who has been to MLO's Whitewater camps?. Our group likes to fish Pike as much as Eyes and have heard WW is a great Pike lake. Any info would definatly be usefull. Also I know there are other camps on the lake beside the four cabins at this camp and are wondering if this creates a room and or privacy issue. Thanks....Good fishing to all Kevin

I can tell you that at Ogoki there are 5 cabins and I certainly didn't feel ""cramped"". Lots of water and the cabins are spread out a long ways apart. I assume WW is similar."

We were staying in cabins managed by Waweig Outfitters out of Armstrong (no longer in business). We ran into a party from another camp (probably Matise-however don't know if they managed a camp on this lake back then)and fortunately they knew where they were at and gave us a setting on getting back to our camp. We caught alot of fish and many northerns in the mix. Great lake but will never forget getting lost. Bought a hand held GPS for the next year and never leave home without it. We'll be going to Kagniagami this year and flying in out of Nakina. You will have a great time if you choose to go to Whitewater and the lake is so large you will rarely see boats from the other camp."

566138,jigman 2003,2007-06-11 06:22:00,981,Thanks for the tip Kevin. One week from right now I'll be fishing on Sumach. Can't wait. You can't go wrong using MLO for an outfitter.
