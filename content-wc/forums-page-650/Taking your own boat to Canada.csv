566131,Guest,2007-06-10 17:50:00,0,"Jesse, I thought I was the only one who took extra hubs; with bearings, seal, extra grease, etc. I used to go through trailer bulbs in Canada like crazy, until I switched everything over to LED's. The winter is sure tough on the roads. Chuck"
566133,Guest,2007-06-10 19:17:00,0,"Make sure you carry a Canada card for car insurance. If you have a fender bender, thats the first thing they ask for. As everyone has already said, take along a tool box and all the spare parts for the trailer. I used to take 2 spare tires along and some years, I would need them both. Now I switched to a better grade of tire. Still take 2 along for peace of mind."
566134,Guest,2007-06-10 20:59:00,0,"Man, I sure am sweating.....I leave for Canada in 10 days and my registration has not come in yet on my new boat....all I have is a copy of the application for registration....I would suppose that no Hull numbers will equal trouble at the border !!!"
566137,Jesse-WI,2007-06-10 22:42:00,534,If your registration does not come carry your copy for application of registration and a copy of your sale invoice to prove ownership. That should surfice since there is often a time lag in between taking ownership and getting the registration back. No expects you not to use the boat until it comes.
566143,wooglin,2007-06-11 08:50:00,371,"One thing I suggest is pack your boat in a very organized way. We pull boats every year and the times we had covered boats, they opened them up and fingered through them...if it's a mess, it'll take a long time. Also, I agree with the hub comments below. We had to replace one a few years back, thankfully our Camp Director 'knew people' and got the job done for us. Strap everything down good, you don't want to have to stop every 100 miles.... Good luck."
566146,Guest,2007-06-11 10:14:00,0,May I add a handful of assorted sized bolts and washers and lock nuts. Seems like someone needs one every trip for a bunk or fender or something else.
566115,polareyes,2007-06-10 08:13:00,12,"We are leaving this coming friday to head up to perrault lake for a week. We will be taking our own boat up there. This will be the first time to take it to canada. Is there anyhting special I need to do? Is it going to cause a longer delay for me at the border? thank you in advance, Polareyez"
566118,Jesse-WI,2007-06-10 09:36:00,534,Double check all safety equipment. Verify its placement on the boat ensuring it can be easily found and removed for use easily. Simple open hooks on trailer chains not legal. Suggest switching to closeable links.
566120,joepa,2007-06-10 10:21:00,366,jesse: Open hooks on trailer chains not legal? Never knew that! Crossed the border many times and no one ever said anything. Where can I pick up a pair?
566121,Guest,2007-06-10 10:22:00,0,"Make sure you have the trailer and boat registration papers. You can wrap electrical tape around the trailer hooks to keep them from accidently coming off the tow vehicle. Coming back into the states at IF, your boat will likely get X-Ray inspected if it is covered. (It is fairly quick and painless, and who knows what they are looking for?) In 25+ years now, we've gotten checked more for boat registration while on the water, than going into Canada at the border (3 times I think -- all when I had Georgia registration). We've got checked for trailer registration I think once at the border, and delayed for a bit on the hooks the first time (we've taped or used rubber hook retainers ever since). Chuck"
566123,dave10,2007-06-10 11:43:00,342,"Make sure you have all the required safety equipment - throwable preserver with 50 feet of rope (I think), horn, fire extinguisher (these may only be applicable to certain size boats), etc etc. Your resort owner should be able to fill you in on what you need, and I know there is an Ontario web link that tells you everything - just can't put my finger on it. Have fun! Dave"
566125,Jimmy Jig,2007-06-10 14:20:00,1905,The safety equipment required is the same as the state the boat is lienced in. You are not required to have the same as Canada boats.
566126,Flip Silverlake,2007-06-10 14:57:00,645,"THANK YOU!, Unless your in Canada for more than 45 days."
566127,Jesse-WI,2007-06-10 15:07:00,534,"On google do a search on Stainless Steel Chain Quick Link to see a picture. They are very common and most places that have a good supply of trailer items carry them. Its just a chain link that can be screwed open and shut. As others stated, you can use tape or rubber, but I always seem to lose mine so I decided to be extra safe."
566128,Jesse-WI,2007-06-10 15:13:00,534,"If your trailer is newer or in real good shape, I would not worry about the following but I have had some interesting experiences. So I also carry an extra hub with pre-installed bearings and a set of springs with ubolts and all tools needed to change either. I basically have a trailer repair box that I take north. Depending on the lights, I would also take bulbs. Depending on where you are going help can be a couple hours away and thats lost time you do not want while on vacation."
