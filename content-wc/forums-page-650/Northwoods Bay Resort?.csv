565868,ace,2007-06-02 18:47:00,10,1st I would like to say I have learned a TON from reading these boards.Thank you. We are heading up 6/30 -7/7 in an RV and staying at Northwoods Bay on Pakwash Lake.Ron there said they have nice full hookups on the lake. It is my wife and my 1st time ever to Canada! Does anyone have any info on Pakwash and in particular this resort? Steve

Depending on the weather and water temp.,you will likely want to fish around the walleye islands trolling at the edge of the drop offs,but the owners will let you know where the bite is happening. The camp is actually off the lake and a couple hundred yards up stream on Chukuni River. Actually quite a nice spot but haven't been to the camp itself. Enjoy your trip and bring an appetite for fish."

To my surprise, the fishing has been great. We fished in front of Pakwash Camp Ground (along the beach) and had good success. You'll enjoy the lake, but be certain to get information from the camp owner on where the reefs are. Any time you enter a bay or river system, be sure to take your time as there is various undisclosed reefs. Water levels are high, but I would still be careful. I don't know anything about the resort. Have a great trip."
