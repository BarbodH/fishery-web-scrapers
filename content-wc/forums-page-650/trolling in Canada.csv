566080,FISHNBOWLJOE,2007-06-07 15:29:00,80,"If you do use a leader, use one of the ball bearing type. Eliminates most all of the line twist. Joe"
566083,Trailerguy,2007-06-07 17:11:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I seldom use a steel leader. Walleyes don't skin up a mono leader, and yes,a steel leader hampers the action. I just watch the mono, and when it gets nicked I change to a new one. Very seldom does the occasional pike bite it off, the first hit, and I don't keep pike anyway. On the occasion I'm targeting pike I'll use a steel leader. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"

The pike are seldom hooked inside the mouth, so they can't reach the leader to bite it off. With jigs or small spinner rigs for walleyes, the pike often do have the line inside their mouth. We get some bite-offs with 20 lb but none with 30 lb. I suppose my best ever pike or musky will bite me off this summer for writing this. I think we get more hits from pike using mono leaders. We use cheap Shakespeare mono from Wal Mart, it is very tough. It is probably slightly visible in the water, although this does not seem to be a problem in the very dark waters we fish in Canada. Around Iowa we do better with 17 lb fluorcarbon leaders, Vanish usually. Cabela's fluorcarbon is tough but can still be seen in water, makes me wonder. I am trying to get fluorocarbon in 30 lb, suppose I have to use special leader stuff that is expensive."
566151,Guest,2007-06-11 12:11:00,0,We troll Bottom Bouncers with spinner rig on braided wire all the time for walleye - works great. Have tried mono and fire lines but always go back to wire.
566154,ssauvain,2007-06-11 12:46:00,21,I use fluoro leaders...don't hinder the action and won't get bit off.
