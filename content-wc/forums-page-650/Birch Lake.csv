566105,Pooch,2007-06-09 07:31:00,4619,"Have fished it and others for many years and will be there over the fourth of July with my wife. We use Green Airways and stay at their camp. There are two camps and then Kay Air has two cabins in the middle part of the lake. There is also an outpost cabin in the NE corner of the lake owned by Green air. Very nice new log cabin, but does not catch much of a breeze and could be hot. Next to the bay where Kay Air's cabins are located is a private cabin that I have never seen in use. Birch is a good average lake. Maybe above average from the lakes I've fished over the years. It is fairly large (29,000 acres)and has many arms that are all fishable. Lots of sunken islands and several deep areas that hold Lake trout. Good numbers of walleye from ""eater"" size to 24/25 inches. Walleye seem to top out around 28 inches. Your starting to get too far north for the really big walleyes. Occasional Northern to over 20# not uncommon. Most northern run from hammer handles to 30-35 inches during the summer. Larger ones will most likely be deeper or near deep water when you are there. All of the usual baits work well. Walleye do seem to like Rattle traps on this lake. Or it seems that way to me. They actually like about anything you throw at them. Some of the pictures under ""Pooch"" are from Birch. The rest are from Savant. You can email me through WC if you have any other questions and I'll try to answer them. Have a safe trip. Pooch"

It's a pretty lake with lots of islands and structure, and in July you should have lots of water to yourself. I found the lakers deep and hard to catch that time of year, but the walleye fishing was very good, and we caught northern up to 38"" while walleye fishing. I don't think it's the place to go if you're looking for that 30"" walleye, but the ratio of 20"" plus fish to smaller fish was as good as I've seen. Have fun and let us know how it goes."

The last lake we went to was much like this one I think...fast action and lots of fish in the 23-28 class. Appreciate the info...any hot spots you would like to share with us...I was told to find the rivers and they would be stacked up in the current. Did you troll shad raps, and the such???"

There were a couple islands that were consistent producers. If you want to email me I'll try to describe them for you. Otherwise, it was typical summer walleye fishing, finding structure, especially with wind blowing into it or across it. We are strictly jig and spinner fishermen, and both worked very well, drifting or backtrolling. I'd recommend bringing crawlers and leeches. As far as rivers, the Shabumeni River flows into the northwest end. Depending on where your cabins are located, it's probably a pretty long run. That would not be my choice of spots for mid-summer fishing, but could be a fun adventure if you're confident of your navigational skills. There are several narrows as you go upstream, try any of them. Make sure you have enough gas to get home."

Or strictly live bait. I have never tried to tip my grubs like Gulp with live bait???? do you use minnows at all?????"
566195,Guest,2007-06-12 08:37:00,0,"What I meant was we use either jigs or spinners. By spinners I mean the Little Joe type thing. Four Seasons in Ear Falls sells some real nice ones made by Klaus or Klass. Other bait shops in the area have them too. Jigs- we use either 1/4 or 1/8 oz with twister tails, and tipped with live bait. I think in mid-summer leeches and crawlers produce as well or better than minnows, and are a lot less expensive and easier to deal with on a fly-in. We've never used the Gulp-type products, but some people on this site swear by them. I'm sure they would work, but I'd still bring the live bait. If it's hot and calm and the fishing is really slow, a crawler on a Lindy rig will sometimes produce for me when nothing else will."
