6351812,eyecatcher1,2019-08-21 06:52:00,323,"A resort owner told me about 8 years ago that someone had put crappies in a small lake near Sioux Lookout. Maybe that was Ralph Lake? Maybe the reason that I've never caught a crappie on Lac Seul is because I rarely fish south of Taylor Island. Now that I hear they are there maybe I'll look for them next time. I rarely fish for them, but if there's nice ones I may give it a try. I agree with Colin though, I'd like to see some pics."
6351814,eyecatcher1,2019-08-21 06:54:00,323,Do you work out of Anderson's Colin? I think we may have met when I fished out of there from 92 to 97.
6351990,SeulAreaWalleye,2019-08-21 18:19:00,100,"I did work there back in those years, but I've been running my own rig from Moosehorn for many since."
6352070,eyecatcher1,2019-08-22 06:40:00,323,"You must know Greg Marino then. He was my guide out of Anderson's a few times back then. Nice guy! I've seen him a few times since then out on Lac Seul, but never got a chance to talk with him."
6352174,lazermule,2019-08-22 12:02:00,86,"I was on LS 8/16-8/18 and did pretty well. Walleyes were hitting pink the best (we were using jig and crawler), my son was also catching a few walleyes on a 6 inch cisco swimbait that he was targeting pike with, which would lead me to believe that they were on the hunt for minnows as well.Walleyes seemed to be wherever the wind was blowing them to in 25+ FOW but we did find some shallow as well which we preferred so we didn't have issues injuring any from swim bladder issues.Interestingly enough, the first fish I marked and we dropped down on my wife caught and it was about a 5 lb sucker which was a first for us.We caught quite a few pike (my son's favorite species to target) but none over 40"" as we usually boat 1 or 2 big ones. He did catch a decent sized pike that was in the slot so we had to release it. The only issue was that it was hooked pretty deep and sustained a bit of injury so it was struggling a bit regaining its composure when we released it. Unfortunately (for the pike) there was a hungry bald eagle that took advantage of the situation and really didn't care that the pike was very near our boat. Now this pike was between 6-8 lbs and I really didn't think the eagle could lift it out of the water. Fortunately I had my phone handy and I caught the entire act on video HERE: https://youtu.be/1sWPdDr5XXY That certainly was a cool experience for My son, wife and I to see. So, all in all it was a good trip. We caught a limit of walleyes, and ate some. Also did well on smallies and ate a few of those too. Water temp was about 69 deg where we were (East side) and water was up at least a foot from when I was there in early June. None of the resorts seemed real busy, the RV park we were at has roughly 50 sites and about 6 or 8 were occupied.Good luck, look for wind and humps and you'll do well.Be safe,LM"
6355106,Skiball,2019-09-02 10:48:00,82,Hey Pooch: Long time no talk. Hope all is well. How's fishing been out of Mahkwa lately? We're headed up on 9/7 through 9/16. Hopefully your trips up there have been good ones. Mike
6351090,Lmbkiller,2019-08-18 12:43:00,639,"There's spiny water fleas in lac seul now too......spineys, crappies, I wonder what's next"
6351104,eyecatcher1,2019-08-18 14:24:00,323,Are you having a little fun with us or are there really crappies in Lac Seul now Sniper1980?
6351168,Sniper1980,2019-08-18 21:34:00,33,Limited out four out of seven day on slabs. Gotta know where to find them. They are out there!
6351208,eyecatcher1,2019-08-19 07:39:00,323,I've been fishing there for 27 years and this is the first that I've heard about crappies in Lac Seul. You think that I would have caught one by accident in all those trips there.
6351246,wooglin,2019-08-19 11:36:00,371,"Fished the 9th-16th - found walleye in deeper water (25-40FOW). When they were biting, it didn't matter what you put in front of them - crawlers, minnows, leeches, plastics. Wind blown rocky points were always holding fish. Pike were everywhere as usual, caught plenty while muskie fishing. Put 4 muskie in the boat (50, 44, 42, 37.5). We fished NE section out of Lac Seul Outposts. Water temps always around 70."
6351430,Pooch,2019-08-20 05:07:00,4618,Next thing you know it will be bullheads......:-) I think sniper is liking the new hemp laws to much.... Pooch
6351444,Sniper1980,2019-08-20 05:51:00,33,It is you who is smoking too much. As hemp and marijuana aren’t the sameNice try tho
6351448,eyecatcher1,2019-08-20 05:52:00,323,LOL! I think that you're right Pooch!
6351744,SeulAreaWalleye,2019-08-20 20:02:00,100,"In 27 years of guiding multispecies all over Lac Seul, there are no crappie....yet. I know how to fish crappie well and also find on sonar. Yes, I believe that eventually they will invade Seul, but not yet. I call bull unless you post a pic of your slabs on the houseboat. Great way to bring attention to this post though, well done. Bet you got a pile of Lake Trout too."
6351762,Sniper1980,2019-08-20 21:13:00,33,There a few and far btwn lake trout on the big Lake of Lac Seul. There are a few. But in the far south east section up to Taylor’s we catch plenty of slabs. Locals have been transplanting out of Ralph lakeNeed I say more
6350802,bradsto,2019-08-17 06:11:00,4,looking for a recent fishing report for the west side of lac seul. not looking for spots just looking for info on bite and depths heading up in two weeks
6350836,Jesse-WI,2019-08-17 08:32:00,534,I've got one week to go. Seems like less reports this year.
6350932,Pooch,2019-08-17 17:46:00,4618,"In camp near Hudson right now. Fishing about normal to slightly less than past years Storms last night slowed things down a little this morning. Today everyone chased off the water a few hours ago, but it appears there is a couple hour window before the next storm so most went back out.Fishing is slower than same camp a month ago with numbers about the same, but size down. Fishing slower than last year for us, but we are only day two of seven days into the trip.Jig bite better than trolling right now. That will change day to day. Minnows working well with crawlers a close second. Plastics on jigs dismal. Trolling plastics on spinners catching larger, but fewer fish. Fish are in general found deeper, but still catch-able. Many times seeing a sterile screen, but catching fish who are there, but buried in the bottom.PoochMore as the week goes on.Pooch"
6350958,TRapperJones,2019-08-17 21:39:00,36,I'm headed up Friday ..will be fishing nw side of lac seul starting around noon on Saturday. Have a guide hired for Sunday.
6350962,Sniper1980,2019-08-17 22:24:00,33,We pounded the crappies around Taylor’s island last week. Bout 16’ down on the weed edges. Walleyes were after pink and white jigs tipped with a live crawlerFound the eyes drifting just off the weed edges. Houseboats were struggling as they couldn’t handleThe big water in the little boats
6350992,Skywagon,2019-08-18 06:48:00,1106,"""crappies""?"
6351068,eyecatcher1,2019-08-18 11:16:00,323,"I was going to ask the same thing Skywagon. I know there are crappies in Dryden, but never heard of anyone catching them on Lac Seul or any other lake in the Sioux Lookout area."
6351074,Skywagon,2019-08-18 11:38:00,1106,"I understand there is one small lake near Sioux Lookout that has some crappie, hopefully some misguided soul has not put any in Lac Seul."
6351078,eyecatcher1,2019-08-18 11:43:00,323,Now that you mentioned it the resort owner where I used to stay told me about 8 years ago that someone put crappies in a lake up there. I don't know which lake though. Do you know which one it is Skywagon?
6351082,Pooch,2019-08-18 12:34:00,4618,Sawbill off of 502 has crappie in it. Big crappie!! Buddies fished it four years ago.Pooch
