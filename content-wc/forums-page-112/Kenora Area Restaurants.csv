6354672,Mojo-NC,2019-08-31 13:48:00,1929,We usually start our trip to Canada by flying into International Falls and driving to Dryden that afternoon. It has become our tradition to have a nice dinner at the Riverview Lodge to begin our week in Canada. This coming Friday we're flying into Winnipeg instead of INL and will be staying in Kenora on our first night instead of Dryden. Can anyone recommend a nice restaurant in the Kenora area so we can at least continue our tradition of starting our week in Canada with a nice dinner? Thanks in advance.
