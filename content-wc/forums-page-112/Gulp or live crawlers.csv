6350894,eyecatcher1,2019-08-17 12:21:00,323,I usually use 3/8 oz up there. Sometimes 1/4 if they're real shallow. How heavy of a jig do you use PRO-V16?
6350896,PRO-V16,2019-08-17 12:28:00,454,"1/4 to about 15', 3/8 when I go deeper."
6350900,Huntindave,2019-08-17 12:44:00,2194,"I'm in agreement about the need for ""action"" with any plastic, Gulp or otherwise."
6350980,tv4fish,2019-08-18 05:42:00,2694,This is just my (our) experience -- When the bite is really ON - I will try to switch to either a Gulp crawler or minnow - the minnow always seem to work better. The artificial leech doesn't seem to work as well. IMHO - you will never outfish live bait with an artificial..............
6350984,Huntindave,2019-08-18 06:13:00,2194,"""When the bite is really ON - I will try to switch"" Is this a fair test under these conditions? Seems like the conditions are skewed towards what ever bait is already working. as an example, lets try the following. Say you are trolling crankbaits and the fish are really hitting the perch pattern Shadraps. ""the bite is really on"" but you will try to switch to a lazy Ike or a spoon; results, the Shadrap always seems to work better. conclusion= you will never outfish the Shadrap with a Lazy Ike or a spoon. I'm not sure either conclusion is totally accurate."
6351110,kona77,2019-08-18 15:35:00,236,"As others have noted when the fish are really active we always switch to Gulp (or other plastics).. You can usually catch numerous fish on a single Gulp minnow and it just saves time from re-baiting. Have a brother who just wants to use plastics (including small crappie type plastics) and he usually catches as many fish as any one in the group (early June..fly-in's)..I do agree that it helps to change your jigging methods from ""snap jigging"" to sometimes even just dragging the bottom to find what will trigger the fish.. We are almost always fishing in 4-12fow and use the lightest jigs we can ( 1/16oz, 1/8oz).. Will only go heavier if we have a strong wind.."
6352212,walleyeguy3,2019-08-22 14:16:00,42,"Interesting advice on fishing Gulp versus live bait. I am glad that I dialed up this thread. We have never done very well switching to Gulp, but maybe that is because we have presented it much the same as our live bait. I am going to give it a try next week near Ear Falls with this new information. Can't wait!"
6352216,PRO-V16,2019-08-22 14:20:00,454,Good luck and report back. I always buy the buckets of Gulp. They don't dry out like the bagged ones.
6352262,kettyspanky,2019-08-22 17:51:00,271,I tried gulp for perch when we were up there. Not worth the hassel. Gulp nuggets anyway. I have tried gulp leeches and caught a few walleye on them. We mostly go for perch and crawlers always work best. I have tried the gulp minnows also and not much luck. Just my 2 cents.
6350630,Doc Northern,2019-08-16 12:43:00,4,Which works best for walleyes gulp or live crawlers or leaches.
6350634,Huntindave,2019-08-16 12:54:00,2194,"All of the above. From my experience it depends on time of the year and individual waters. I generally always have Gulp products available to use. Having them always available is the biggest reason to keep them on hand. It doesn't hurt that they are an effective bait. For me, I catch as many Walleyes on artificial (includes hard baits) as I do on live bait. But that may be because I use artificial at least 50% of the time."
6350640,eyecatcher1,2019-08-16 13:15:00,323,They eat anything. We've even caught them with cheetos.
6350682,stumcfar,2019-08-16 15:32:00,451,"Not sure if it is just us, but we have had very little success on Lac Seul with any kind of plastics or Gulp. We have often had days where we have ran out of live bait and switched to artificial and virtually caught nothing. With that said, I did catch a few on red licorice once!"
6350748,eyecatcher1,2019-08-16 19:45:00,323,"I guess I'm not the only one then. The past three summers on Lac Seul I have tried plastic, GT 360 and jigging raps during a fish every two minutes bite. I get nothing, but my wife will keep on catching them. I switch back to a jig and live bait and hammer them. I have caught a few on gulp leeches, but it takes a long time to get them to hit it. They hit crankbaits really good though."
6350840,The tank,2019-08-17 08:39:00,340,Worms and live minnows or preserved minnows from best bait shinners from ohio has always out shined any artificial baits for us. Leeches at times are hard to beat but not worth messing with unless you're bobber fishing. The best artificial baits for us have been from northland tackle. Paddle tail minnows and jigging leeches.
6350864,PRO-V16,2019-08-17 10:27:00,454,"Mid June this year on Lac Seul I decided to stay with a jig and 3"" Gulp emerald shiners the whole trip. Everybody else used minnows or crawlers. I caught just as many fish as they did and we did very well. The key to Gulp minnows is to go with a slightly heavier jig than with live bait and rip jig or keep them bouncing hard. It's the action that get's them. It will put neutral fish on the attack and I've frequently outfished the live baiters on these neutral fish. When pulling spinners I use a half of a Gulp crawler on a single hook. Works well and keeps the perch from cleaning you off. The other plus to Gulp is catching maybe 10 or more fish before you have to replace the bait."
6350874,eyecatcher1,2019-08-17 11:07:00,323,Maybe that's what I'm doing wrong then. I try to work the plastic just like live bait. Something to try next time. Thanks!
6350886,Bill Krejca,2019-08-17 11:41:00,6107,"Interesting point re: weight of jig. I guess I too have noticed the Gulp minnow to have better action when the jig head is a bit heavier than I would use with bait. I think the added weight causes the minnow to flex more,which seems to be what they like. As I have mentioned before, my personal opinion is that the fish hit due to the Gulp action, scent being a lesser p/o the attraction formula. Bill"
6350888,PRO-V16,2019-08-17 11:43:00,454,My personal belief is the rapid rise and fall of the jig is what triggers them. Plus it thumps bottom harder.
