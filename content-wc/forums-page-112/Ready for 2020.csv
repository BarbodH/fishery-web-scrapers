If you have and are willing to help with fishing information would be greatly appreciated, especially hazards to avoid. We will try to have a guide for at least one day, ordering maps and will have GPS on hand. I have read and covered information over the last 10 years and gained a lot of information. I am seeking the legendary 33"" walleye, yeah I know it's impossible. My biggest walleyes have come from a small lake in BWCAW in northern Minnesota. The trip was day after the memorial service for my dad, stopped on the lake wore out. Then caught 8 fish in the week, 5 between 30"" to 32 3/4"" guide service from the heavens. So looking for the bigger one that could happen if stars and planets align."
