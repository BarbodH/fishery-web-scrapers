6353598,prov1800,2019-08-27 14:44:00,5010,Will be doing a moose hunt at Okanse Lake in a couple of weeks so went in to look the lake over for moose sign and see what the fishing is like.We had bad winds but got out anyways and fished where we could.Fishing was excellent for both walleye and northern pike.Walleyes are very shallow there if you found a rock you found fish and every weed bed was also full of walleyes and northerns.jigs and minnows were the ticket but they bit on twistertails also after we ran out of minnows{my fault didn't bring enough}and there free.lol.but good to find out what they will bite on.Also bit good on a search bait never knew what would hit the lure.The Gt 360 got them to.Excellent cabin with all the comforts of home thanks to the very quite Honda generator.Cabin is new and has 3 boats for up to 6 guys.Smaller lake but easy to find fish that way and don't have to boat far all the time.Highly recommend it.Found lots of moose sign and actually saw caribou there.sight to see.beautifull animals which are the woodland caribou in that area.Anyone interested in a trip look it up on www.clarksresorts.com.
