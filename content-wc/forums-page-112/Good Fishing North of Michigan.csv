We typically all meet in Chicago and drive the 15 hours up to Lac Seul, but that would be too much for a 3-4 day trip. We would all be taking off from Grand Rapids, MI next year. Has anyone had a lot of success with walleye on lakes just north of Michigan? Ideally the trip would be less than 8 hours from Grand Rapids. Thanks!"

They have a main lodge there and also do fly in trips to remote lakes. Depending on the time of year you would be going, they may offer 3-4 day trips. The drive along the North Shore of Lake Superior is gorgeous . I'm heading up that way at the end of September and can't wait. Best of luck finding a great place to go. PjShorthorn"
6353634,dvl2700,2019-08-27 17:51:00,371,Look at Lake Anjigami (sp??) up near WaWa. Drive in where we rented the whole camp (20 of us from our church group) Caught and ate a ton of fish. There were two other lakes you could portage too to catch pike. dvl2700
