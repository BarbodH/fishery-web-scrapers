At least on that side it took us half a week to figure out that the walleye were much shallower than anticipated, I think just chasing huge clouds of minnows which are so thick sometimes they can mark as bottom. 12-25 feet seemed to be the ticket and we had a heck of a time finding them on electronics, even with a helix mega though we would catch them right where nothing was marking. Trolling cranks crossing tips of points and productive looking shores was a nice way to find them. We got a week of hard wind so that impacted our ability to fish the humps.
