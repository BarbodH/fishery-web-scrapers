6350858,camp chef,2019-08-17 10:00:00,915,Planning next Springs trip and decided we are going to do the houseboat thing on Rainy Lake. We are trying to decide between Rainy Lake Houseboats and Northernaire. We would appreciate any input...positive or negative about either company. Thanks for the help. Bryon
6350996,BCNeal,2019-08-18 07:11:00,19,Can't speak for Northernaire but I've been on 3 Rainy Lake Trips with Rainy Lake Houseboats and all 3 were excellent. Well organized operation and excellent quality houseboats. I wouldn't hesitate to use them again.

The yacht-style hull of Rainy Lake Houseboats is a huge advantage over the pontoon boats some other companies use. These guys and gals have been doing this for a long time. I usually travel through the Brule to the ""big lake"" and tie up at a nice sandy beach with world-class fishing close by spring or summer. This was my 14th houseboat trip with a couple of different companies, but the last 9 or 10 have been with Rainy Lake Houseboats. Enjoy the planning!city"
