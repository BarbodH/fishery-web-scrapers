6354358,prov1800,2019-08-30 08:04:00,5010,"Had a day planned with 6 guys from iowa that wanted to try Cedar Lake for a day.Met them at Clarks yesterday and got boats in the water grabbed some minnows and took off.Wind was still nasty at 42 km gusts from the west and it would be pounding us all day.Our first spot produced a lot of crappies right of the bat.Everybody was pretty impressed with their size as most were 12""and some up above that.From around 8 till 11 we had a fantastic bite but seemed to slow up.Caught a number of good walleyes also.Worked our way back toward camp and tried sme other spots but was sower only catching here and there but walleyes did bite in the other spots.So turned out to be a good day fishing.Had a treat also with one of the guys had a small bbq in his boat and he was cooking us up some awesome pork burgers that tasted pretty good out on the lake.Hard to beat days like that."
6354372,prov1900,2019-08-30 08:34:00,544,Nice crappie! Looks from the pics that the weather is cooling down up north. Crappie bite is probably just going to get better.
6354374,prov1800,2019-08-30 08:52:00,5010,Temps have been cool the last week.cold front.water temps 67f yesterday and have had brutal winds daily. Crappies it's is always pretty good on cedar but fall is ways good to fish period.queiter now also.
6354442,Bill Krejca,2019-08-30 13:19:00,6107,"I believe I was contacted by these folks some time ago, and that they would be having you guide them on Cedar for a day, sounds like everyone did well. Several more weeks before I get there, glad it worked out, and that the crappies are still/more hungry as fall approaches. Bill"
6354450,prov1800,2019-08-30 13:37:00,5010,Hi Bill.they are definitely hungry.We had a fantastic bite from around 8:30-11:30.Then it slowed down.caught a couple here and there on the other spots.Boys had a great time as I did to.
6354452,prov1800,2019-08-30 13:38:00,5010,When do you come up and where are you staying.
6354504,pjshorthorn,2019-08-30 18:21:00,5654,Bet these fellas didnâ€™t have Flamingo bouy markers out to keep those spots identified. PjShorthorn
6354590,Bill Krejca,2019-08-31 07:32:00,6107,"Coming Sep 21, staying at Cedar Point - stop over if you aren't moose guiding. Bill"
6354592,Bill Krejca,2019-08-31 07:37:00,6107,"Yeah, flam markers are a stealthy way to hide a spot, all right, fit right in with the wilderness, trouble is if everyone used them, they'd begin to become a spotlight for all the best spots. Bill"
6354630,prov1800,2019-08-31 10:21:00,5010,Unfortunately we didn't have them.Think it might have been to rough on the poor birds at 42 km.
