6353276,MN_Moose,2019-08-26 16:47:00,964,Very cool. Did you go up through the rags?
6353282,pjshorthorn,2019-08-26 17:09:00,5654,Sure looked like it. The rags would have been towards the very end of the video....tall tree stumps on the right of the boat. PjShorthorn
6353316,TSR6,2019-08-26 18:17:00,4,Yes -right around 5:10 in the video!
6353558,lazermule,2019-08-27 13:19:00,86,"Cool video, looks like you stay where I stay and I think you passed me on the water. LM"
6353958,Bob/MN,2019-08-28 16:23:00,178,That brings back some found memories of my annual trip.
6353978,TSR6,2019-08-28 18:41:00,4,"I meant to multi-quote you, but looks like I goofed up the formatting. No kidding?? Where do you stay? and where (time stamp?) did we pass you on the video? That's pretty cool..."
6353980,TSR6,2019-08-28 18:42:00,4,I'll have a lot of fun watching this again come December / January
