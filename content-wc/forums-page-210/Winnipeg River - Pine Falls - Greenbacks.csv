Most of the bigger stuff in that 26-28 inch range with the odd larger one. You will get a boat full of cookie cutter fish while waiting for that big one to come along so you won't fall asleep.

We experienced dead calm conditions which isn't the best. We had 20 walleye within a couple hours but most were small-14""-15"". We slowly upgraded in size and caught larger fish (18""-21"") in the Winnipeg River. We have not caught a lot of big fish this year. Probably only a dozen fish in the 23""-28"" size range and the walleye are skinny. The tournament results show the shrinking size when 2016 tournaments were won with under 40 lbs over 2 days and in years past there were 50 lb winning weights. There are still lots of boats even on weekdays and weekends are chaotic."
5130250,luv2huntnfish,2016-09-27 19:59:00,73,Any updates on the status of fishing on the river and lake is appreciated. Current water temperature and lake water levels updates appreciated as well. Thanks in advance.
5130314,Don the Tinman,2016-09-27 20:51:00,5,"Was out last week Thursday, water temp was 63 degrees, lots of current and water was very dirty. Walleyes we caught were skinny, caught lots of drum...heading back out Saturday"
5131369,Balzy,2016-09-28 11:43:00,76,We are going up Oct 4th - 9th so I'll post when we get back. When were you going up there?
5131681,luv2huntnfish,2016-09-28 15:14:00,73,Ready to head up any time depending on how the fishing is. Thanks to all who are responding on the fishing.

5133714,Minakiwalleye28,2016-09-29 16:21:00,37,I will be up there the 4th to the 9th as well. Prefishing for the tourney on Sat and Sun. but mostly going to have fun catching fish all week. haha

5148825,Clanton,2016-10-10 21:00:00,44,Spent the last couple days fishing Pine Falls. Fishing is slowly starting to pick up as the water temps drop. Sunday was 56 degrees. Walleye caught in the river/bay where still thin for this time of year. Not many bigger ( 7lbs + ) fish being caught right now. Hopefully that changes over the next couple of weeks.
5149153,Balzy,2016-10-11 07:27:00,76,"Just came back on Sunday from the Winnipeg river 4 fisherman 338 walleyes and the fish did look skinny. I think that's why they were biting so well and very few large fish. Out of all those fish we had 2 - 27.5"" / 2 - 27"" were the biggest fish caught and the water temp. was 60 degrees. Until next year!"
5167985,luv2huntnfish,2016-10-25 12:45:00,73,"Anyone been fishing up there recently? I am interested in going back if the conditions are right looking to hear if a population of bigger fish may have moved in. Also curious of current water levels and temps, water clarity. Thanks in advance."
