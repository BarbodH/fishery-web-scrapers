This camp has 2 newer cabins that can hold up to 12 or more, and those newer cabins have 2 bathrooms and a large kitchen, with a deck overlooking a bay on the lake chain...our group of 10 would go to this camp for the Spring Opener (on the Cedar Lake chain) and brought in our own boats....we would rent one of those newer cabins and it worked out good for us. PM me if you want more information - is a clean and well run camp.www.Sportfishin.com Good luck with your decision. Rich B"
5202017,jamesherbst,2016-11-21 11:31:00,12,"Thanks for the suggestions everyone! To answer a couple of you, we cross over through International Falls and have fished as far north as Red Lake, and a bit east over towards Lac Seul. Hope that narrows things down...and thanks again!"
5202081,stjoeguy,2016-11-21 13:00:00,979,"For a remote, boat-in cabin 25 miles from the nearest cabin try the Winoga Lodge outpost cabin on Lake St. Joesph: http://www.winoga.com The website isn't very good but the walleye fishing is the best I've found. Call Dick Mansfield at 807-737-1829 Boat-in camps on the lake are Camp Lake St. Joseph and Old Post:http://www.lakestjoseph.comhttp://www.oldpost.com There are a lot of reviews and reports on Walleye Central. Do a search in the Canada, eh section for winoga, Joseph or Joe and you'll find a lot of information. Or PM me."

5199722,jamesherbst,2016-11-18 14:55:00,12,"We are a group of fathers/sons that have taken an annual fishing trip for the past 10 years. We've done fly-ins and drive-ins, and are looking for a good boat-in lodge. We like the remoteness of the fly-ins, but the sons are all over 21 now, and the beer requirement has increased to the point that we far exceed the weight limits for the fly-ins.Looking for some suggestions on boat-in lodges with solid walleye fishing. We always go housekeeping plan and cook our own food, so we don't need full service accommodations. Any suggestions and experiences would be helpful!"
5199802,bthomas3333,2016-11-18 17:21:00,465,One of my fly-ins will stage the beer in camp before you show up for free. They just load the plane the week before when they are light (aka a check flight). Of course it helps to choose a camp that does their own flying as opposed to one that contracts out the flight side. Check out Viking Island. New owners. Newer clean cabins. If you drink Blue they usually have extra cases around or will bring the beer in ahed of you.Tons of 18-23in Walleyes and 24-30in pike.Just another thought based on how we handled groups that at times brought in 23 cases of beer.B-
5200122,Thompmd,2016-11-19 05:24:00,320,LOTW has others but you might look at Ash Rapids Lodge and Crow Rock. Crow Rocks housekeeping is on a private Island.

5200178,h8go4s,2016-11-19 06:39:00,1673,"Where would you be boating in from? Canada's a big country, you know. It might help to narrow it down."

5200425,adempsey2.0,2016-11-19 15:17:00,612,"I wouldn't worry too much about weight for a fly-in. That can always be managed and if there's an extra cost, it's not that bad.I do like boat-in trips a lot though. As mentioned, it would be most helpful knowing your starting point and how far you're willing to travel. Any interest in a boat-in outpost? or just lodges? Is your group size 10+?"
5200681,packpro,2016-11-19 22:05:00,695,"If you work with your outfitter, you can figure out the beer allotment. Big Canon Lodge can help you get the beer in beforehand or mid week when they bring their camp supplies in. If you're set on a boat in, we had great trips to both Ghost River and Anglers Kingdom. Lots of fish, with a quite a few braggers thrown in. Very nice accommodations at both places and fantastic service from the owners."
