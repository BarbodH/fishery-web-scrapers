We like the idea of once we hit Sioux Lookout we would not have to make the further trip to St. Joe. They both have the same accomadations so we are curious of the quality of fishing between the two. I would love to hear your guys thoughts and recommendation, thanks. And if it matters it would be mid to late August."
5164402,Mike Borger,2016-10-23 06:05:00,1554,"I can only comment on St. Joe as I've never fished Lac Seul. My group and I fished the western end of St. Joe last year in August and had a great trip.Endless amounts of walleye, some trophy sized pike and I loved the size of the lake. Lots of water to explore. Perhaps the best part was we had the entire western end of St. Joe to ourselves, we didn't see a single other boat! I've been on a lot of trips over the years and this one was one of the better ones, don't think you guys could go wrong.Have also heard nice things about Winoga's cabin, by all accounts it's very nice.If you're at all curious here's my detailed story on the St. Joe trip:http://www.canadafishingguide.net/la...eye-beat-down/"
5164890,Bayou,2016-10-23 09:42:00,52,"Thanks for the response Mike and I remember reading about your trip. I'm the guy that talks to you every year from Cincinnati, Ohio. We tried to get into Bauer's Onaman but they were full and they won't know until November if they have a opening. We will now be going to the NW section of Ontario. Last year was it with the Central-North area. I'll shoot you a PM, Bill"
5164986,stjoeguy,2016-10-23 10:44:00,979,"First, the disclaimer: As you can see by my name I really like Lake St. Joseph. Some of my favoring St. Joe is probably based on being more comfortable with the lake and style of fishing used there. I've fished at the Winoga outpost cabin on Lake St. Joe for 10 years, always in June. Last September was the first time I fished with Lac Seul Outposts (LSO). My only other Lac Seul experience has been a couple days in Senn Bay in 2014 and a week on the SE end at Onaway Lodge in 2015. Getting there: At both camps you spend the night at Sioux Lookout; LSO at a motel and St. Joe at the Winoga Lodge camp on Abram. At LSO you park your truck at the Deception landing just outside of Sioux Lookout and follow the LSO boat for an hour up to the camp. Winoga is a much earlier start, followed by a 2+ hour drive up to the St. Joe landing. You meet the Winoga barge there, load your gear and boats and then boat 45 minutes into the cabin. With my Honda Ridgeline pulling a boat the trip up and back to the St. Joe landing is a full tank of gas. Cabin: I've only been in one cabin at LSO so my comparison is limited, but the Winoga cabin is much nicer. It's solar powered with a back up generator. Indoor bathroom and shower with an outhouse as a backup. It sleeps 10 with 4 in two main floor bedrooms and 6 up in the loft but 8 is more comfortable. The table only seats 8 so a couple guys have to eat on the couch. The LSO cabin we were in was all bunk beds, many with very poor mattresses, whereas Winoga is all single, comfortable beds (easier for us old guys to get in and out of). Both have WiFi, good stoves, refrigerators, freezers, etc and neither have TV. Camp: At LSO there are many other cabins. The owner and his wife and at least 3 other assistants are around to fuel boats and help in any way. On two of the cooler days this last September when we returned one of the assistants had already built a fire in the wood stove for us to warm the cabin. The camp is rather isolated but there are other outpost cabins and houseboats in the area so you do see other boats, but LSO is nowhere near as crowded as the SE end of Lac Seul. There are benches at the end of a dock where people gather to have a drink and fish in the evening. It's a camp experience. Winoga, on the other hand, is all by itself. No other cabins or anyone else in a 25 mile radius. On fair weather days you may see some boats that have come up the 25 miles from the Old Post at the NE end of the lake but usually you are the only boat around. I believe one reason the Old Post guides come to the Winoga outpost area in good weather is because of the excellent fishing in the area. Before discovering the Winoga cabin I used to fish out of Camp Lake St. Joseph on the NE end of the lake by Old Post. Every day we would go out 1/2 hour to the fishing areas. Every day we had shore lunch. It was on one of the calm days that we ventured out the extra 20 minutes and found the Winoga cabin in a prime fishing area. At Winoga we fish 5-10 minutes from the cabin and usually return to the cabin for lunch. Bottom line is that LSO is a camp experience and Winoga is an outpost. I prefer the isolation of Winoga. Lake: Both are great fisheries. I think that St. Joe has more fishing structure than LSO, but again, that may be because I know the lake better. And by fishing structure I mean rocks. A fellow that fished with me last year at LSO and has fished many years at St. Joe won't return to St. Joe because last year rocks took out his lower unit both times on two trips. I've watched him, however, and he's definitely a ""d**n the torpedoes, full speed ahead"" type of guy. I, on the other hand, mild mannered CPA, have fished St. Joe over 10 years and never hit a rock. I have to admit, however, that I've seen many boats come out of St. Joe with bent props or worse (sorry, Dave). Fish: At LSO we got primarily walleye and sauger with very few northerns. There was one 40"" northern but nothing else close. We went days without catching a northern. One very nice smallmouth was caught but it was the only one. We saw a musky at the surface several times but couldn't hook it. The walleye were much smaller in general than at St. Joe and much more timid biters. We fished with minnows using a slow vertical jigging. Numbers were way below St. Joe. Again, this is only based on one trip to LSO. St. Joe is a barbless, single hook lake that we fish primarily with artificial bait like Gulp or twisters. We've tried leeches, worms and live or salted minnows but keep going back to Gulp. It's far easier and just as effective. On St. Joe I prefer pitching and retrieving jigs. I'm told that there may be a better chance for a trophy fish on Lac Seul, but that hasn't been my experience. Biggest fish I've seen on St. Joe are a 42"" northern and 30"" walleye. My experience has been much greater numbers and overall larger fish on Lake St. Joseph. On St. Joe there are more fish in the 17-19"" range and sometimes you have to work to get the keeper under 18"". On Lac Seul our keeper standard kept going down because it was harder to get fish approaching 18"". Lac Seul has a slot size that you can't keep and St. Joe is just 18"" maximum with one over. On Lac Seul fish have to be killed and kept on ice whereas on St. Joe keeping fish in the live well is OK. Either choice would be good. They're different experiences, but as you can tell, I prefer the Winoga cabin at Lake St. Joseph. Mike Borger's trip was a fly-in to the Slate Falls outpost cabin even further down Lake St. Joe and that sounded like a great trip. I'm going to keep going back to the Winoga outpost on St. Joe in June but would like to try the Slate Falls fly-in in September. I love to talk about fishing Lake St. Joe, especially now that my boat has been put away for the winter and there is no ice fishing yet, so feel free to ask any questions."
5165082,Bayou,2016-10-23 11:09:00,52,"Thanks StJoeguy, that was very thought out and I appreciate the time it took you to write it. I would like to try St. Joe but the next morning drive of 2+ hours might be too much. And Slate falls is too expensive for us. We take a July trip with my family and a August trip with the guys. It sounds like LSO may be fine for the family as they did their first fly in but they like the sound of a camp atmosphere. We are primarily looking for numbers as in walleye. Thanks again"
5167401,Skid1966,2016-10-25 06:01:00,14,"I have fished both ST.Joe and LAC SUEL, ST JOE IS HARD TO BEAT. and more remote."
5167961,btyreprich,2016-10-25 12:17:00,1067,"I have fished both lakes and feel there are probably more fish on St Joe given the structure and far less fishing pressure. With that being said, our group feels that Lac Seul grows bigger fish. Both lakes have plenty of positive points to them and you'll have a great time on both lakes. We haven't been to St Joe in several years but another trip is on me bucket list when I retire in a few years."
5204297,fldoc1,2016-11-23 09:46:00,69,"There is nothing I can add to stjoeguys Winoga lodge summary. Our crew has been to Camp Lake St Joe twice in July and August. Great hosts, reasonable, and a basic fishing camp. We had good fishing and it was important to fish the wind. We used their 14 ft. boats and got beyond Bolder City the second trip but still a long distance to the Winoga lodge. I now have an 18 ft. boat and hope to join stjoeguy at Winoga lodge someday. Most of our crew loves LSJ but it is a long drive. We went to LacSeul outposts only once the second week of June. We had great fishing close to camp. The camp, in Chamberlain narrows, funnels tons of water down the lake. Because it is like a river it has more current which is always good for walleye fishing. In fact one could fish off the dock. Because of the time of year most big northerns were caught while jigging for walleyes. A 40 in northern was caught by a young man off the dock while we were running around the lake casting for them. Mostly walleyes with jig and minnows within a few miles of camp. Lots of great water and good fishing spots. We caught more big walleyes vs. LSJ and as many. It was the nicest and priciest place we have ever gone to. We have not gone back as one fisherman can't stand jigging and loves to cast for northerns and we did not catch many and nothing of size. Plus the $ issue. (next paragraph) Our group starting fishing together at least 10 years ago. We have some that price is not much of a barrier but we have others that like to stay in the $500 for a week. Since we try to accommodate the entire group as often as possible the $500 a week becomes our goal. With that said some of us want to return to LSJ and fish with stjoeguy at Winoga lodge. I do have friends that go to the Old Post Camp on LSJ and like it very much. It is pricier and mostly use guides. The boats that StJoeGuy sees are the guide boats from the Old Post camp. They have nice 16+ foot boats with adequate motors so get down the lake fairly quickly. It is a fancier camp and I think it has meal options and a bar. Randy from Duluth"
