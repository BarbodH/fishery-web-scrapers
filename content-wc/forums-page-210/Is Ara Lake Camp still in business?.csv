5192026,Buckstersmith,2016-11-10 08:57:00,4,"Thanks, Mike! Take care!"
5193097,Buckstersmith,2016-11-11 12:36:00,4,Thanks for the best wishes! Ara Lake has a special place in our hearts and we're excited about sharing both the fishing and comradery with our friends in the near future. All our best and hope to catch up with you sometime!
5173265,Ebarnett,2016-10-28 13:33:00,60,I noticed their website is no longer up and running. One of their outpost lakes is on my groups radar for the future (Peninsular). Anyone have any information?
5173457,Mike Borger,2016-10-28 15:51:00,1554,I was just chatting with someone about this. Pretty sure it is still operating but has recently changed hands.Hopefully someone else can confirm things.
5173473,adempsey2.0,2016-10-28 15:52:00,612,"Not sure. Unfortunately, Dick Fayle passed away on January 26,2016. I believe the camp was closed for the season and was up for sale. Not certain what the status is though.Website still working for me though.http://www.aralakecamp.com/"
5173729,Ebarnett,2016-10-28 18:48:00,60,"Yes, their website is working for me now...while we are on the subject.... How is the outpost on Peninsular? The cabin looks nice, elctricity? Hot running water? Indoor facilities? Its a long lake, where is the cabin located on the lake? Im sure Mike has been here and could chime in."
5173881,Mike Borger,2016-10-28 20:33:00,1554,"I paddled through Peninsular years ago. My buddy Chris Brock fished the Peninsular outpost maybe 3 years ago and liked it fine, although I believe the camp is very basic and kind of run down a bit. Lots of walleye, some larger pike and even some brook trout in the Attwood river. He'd be the guy to chat with.I do know there's another large native owned camp right across from that outpost. You'd have to hope it was unoccupied if you book that camp."
5175401,theishaveit,2016-10-30 03:48:00,2,"Ara Lake Camp was open this past season. I was there the last week of June. They do have new owners that will be operating the camp in 2017. Evidently, many ""upgrades"" are being planned. The new owners did NOT purchase the outposts at Studd or Peninsular, nor did they buy the airbase at Partridge Lake. Flying is still done by Leuenberger out of their base in Nakina. Website works and Shirley still answers the phone. Hope this helps"
5175913,adempsey2.0,2016-10-30 10:30:00,612,"Good to know, thanks. Wish them all the best on their new venture!"
5178809,onetimedave,2016-11-01 07:17:00,502,"If Ara does not work out for you, look at Brace Lake. From Brace you can fish Ara, Meta, Brace and Meta creek. GREAT young coupe operating camp."
5191186,Buckstersmith,2016-11-09 10:14:00,4,"Hi Guys! Ara Lake Camp is under new management and raring to go providing the same fishing experience on Ara Lake as always! Thanks to all for your encouragement! We promise to continue the legacy of Dick and Shiryl (along with a few planned facility upgrades) in providing each fisherman with a high quality and responsive wilderness experience smack dab in the middle of what we all know is a great walleye fishing lake. Incidentally, with her permission, we ARE keeping Shiryl involved!"
5191362,Mike Borger,2016-11-09 14:28:00,1554,"You got yourself a real nice spot there, congrat's!"
