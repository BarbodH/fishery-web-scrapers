5157506,bthomas3333,2016-10-17 16:07:00,465,Ok. So what and where are you guys buying that is 50% less somewhere else. I just did a quick look on amazon for a few items then compared the prices to cabellas. I looked at Storm Swim baits. They were .2 cents less on Cabellas. Then I looked at Savage Gear Glide baits. These were .19 cents less on Amazon. Of course all of the Shimano and St Criox stuff is price controlled.Genuinely curious because I don't want to waste money at the big boxes but when I am looked in the past the prices just don't vary much. Occasionally I have seen used stuff on ebay which is obviously cheaper. Can you give an example of an item that is 50% less.B-

5158026,phishfearme,2016-10-17 20:27:00,1242,"well, it's always good to ""update"" your assumptions and experience. I've not ordered anything from the big box stores in many years and my ""50% less"" experience is certainly dated. so, I went to cabelas and ebay to find 100 1/4 ounce jigs and 100 3 inch Mr. Twisters. here's the results: - Cabelas - $14.36 + $14.76 + $8.95 ship + $2.04 sales tax = $40.11 (BPS is a little more) - ebay - $17.99 (includes shipping) + $13.99 + $3.95 = $35.93 (no sales tax) so, cabelas is about 12% more expensive - however, the above compares apples with apples as much as possible which means name brand twisters (Mr. Twister) and on ebay I can get generic twisters for $9.50 + $3.60 ship which would save about $5. I also checked for basic hooks - our preference is the Mustad 3366 for wormin' - can get them for $4.85 / 100 plus shipping at Netcraft and just can't find them at either Cabelas or BPS. so, with these new data, I would have to say that my old value of 50% cheaper is wrong - maybe 20% is more like it - and much of this is attribute to no sales tax. my apologies for stating dated info - must be age. phish"
5158738,wallydave,2016-10-18 08:17:00,2151,"I have taken advantage of the BPS trade in program for reels and rods, sales on crankbaits from Cabela's cave.Being a jig and minnow guy, most of my jigs I buy from Sirmanski and Capt Redbeard.Mike Kansas runs Sirmanski, and I have fished with him too. Redbeard often posts on his website, he will be fishing, so the orders will be processed when he returns.Buying my jigs in the winter means I'm ready to roll for the season.Help the little guy that loves fishing like you do!"
5168417,Guest,2016-10-25 15:49:00,0,"""My"" Cabelas (Ritchfield, WI) has a restaurant in it--the Great Lakes Grill--and it's usually our first stop when we go there. ""My"" BPS is in Gurnee Mills mall--food in the mall, but not the store. Thinking about it, seems strange to go to a fishing store for a meal, but I've certainly done stranger things. I use BPS when I need to find a cheap version of something before committing to the ""real"" thing--they seem to have more ""disposable"" (China-made?) items, or at least they're easier to find. Once I lock in on something I want, I want the best I can get...and generally find that at Cabela's. I have concern that the cross-pollination will put an inferior product on the shelves at Cabela's, but perhaps I'm just being cynical. ""My"" Cabela's also carries different boat manufacturers...is BPS going to stuff Trackers in there instead? -42"

Heck, most folks get sucked into buying stuff they don't need when sober. Just think what sales would be like if a BYOB opportunity was instituted........"".Uuuuummmmm , Ethyl ?

5145418,1K1MOA,2016-10-08 09:08:00,90,"I believe competition is good for the consumer, that is why anti-trust laws were formed in this country to help ensure competition is not eliminated by a single entity controlling a major portion of a market. While like most on this site, I am a customer of both entities, but I am not thrilled about seeing them under single ownership. Business consolidation normally results in less choice as management tries to maximize profits by offering products that offer them the most margin. I also believe consolidating market share under one company gives them too much power in dictating terms to the supply chain as to what they will or will not sell and at what prices. This can result in quality manufacturers and brands reducing the quality of their products to be able to hit the price points and margin requirements of the company that now controls the majority of the marketplace, or be locked out from the major supplier to the market they serve. The other side of that coin is where quality is preserved, prices are likely to increase to provide the margins being ""dictated"" to them in order to do business through them. We have witnessed this with fishing reels and rods over the last few years; just look at the average selling price compared to a few years ago. Yes, they're touting new features; but look at the massive price increases that have come with many of those features. Of course change will be slow to protect the brand value of this investment, but over time I tend to believe the change that occurs will be to the benefit of ownership and not the consumer. Just my two cents, but with everything else going on in our country, I guess this isn't one of our bigger problems at the moment."
5145474,adempsey2.0,2016-10-08 09:53:00,612,"Well said. I couldn't agree more. I think BPS made a dramatic shift over five years ago, at least here in Canada. Their own BPS product lines started growing exponentially and basically took over the store. Once that happened, I stopped shopping there for the most part. There is no way this acquisition will be a good thing for the consumer. Has it ever been?"
5145530,Obabikon,2016-10-08 11:05:00,2370,"In my opinion... BPS and Gander Mountain and Cabelas are all out of my price range. Financially, I have found that I can get better deals and higher quality product from smaller stores or from ordering online. Just my two cents."

5151890,bthomas3333,2016-10-13 09:30:00,465,The same is true here in the US. BPS has become 90% BPS brand vs other products. I'll walk around a BPS but I still buy from Cabellas. After this merger I will just be driven to order what I want online. Its too bad because it is nice to actually see and touch a product in person but I am not going to buy China made BPS crap. In person shopping is basically dead to me.

5157458,phishfearme,2016-10-17 15:55:00,1242,"correction - after looking thru some buy options comparing Cabelas to ebay for example - my statement below of ""50% cheaper"" no longer appears valid - maybe 20%. however the internet provides a much larger selection of gear than what the big box stores provide.YES! i think Oba is right on.could you guys please tell me what you buy at these places? if I ever need tackle I find the best deals BY FAR in ebay or amazon or elsewhere - 50% cheaper for same if not better gear.I do however enjoy spending a few hours at these places looking at all the surroundings - but hardly ever buy anything. I think this is what's driving the merger.phish"
5143490,Bstar,2016-10-06 15:46:00,564,Just wondering what everyone thinks about the BassPro buyout of Cabela's? I'm kind of lucky since I live within 20 miles of both stores with Cabela's being somewhat closer than BassPro. But BassPro has a restaurant where I can get a beer after a hard day of shopping! I like both stores and nothing has been announced yet about any stores being closed but these two stores are only 18 miles apart. I guess we'll have to do a wait and see....
5143554,spurs101,2016-10-06 16:08:00,635,"My guess would be a few of the ""non performing stores"" may close, no retail expansions unless there is a void and for the most part keep their own identity. I think they will take advantage in buying power, reduce or eliminate redundancy in corporate. I think the transition will be slow and we not even notice. I've always liked Cabela's and have been a customer for years."
5143634,octanehi5,2016-10-06 17:14:00,1104,I'm betting both stores stay as they are
5143642,Weby13,2016-10-06 17:16:00,57,"I have two buddies that work for Bass Pro and they told me the new owners did not purchase the hunting or fishing side of Cabelas. They only purchased any food products that are sold but plan on putting arestaurants at all Cabelas. Locals are not happy because the new owner is an ""ethnic"" and that's all I know. I do know they paid a lot of moola for the place but what my two buddies said they would do anything to make Bstar happy! Maybe I should of signed in as a guest to post this! Sorry to all I offend!"
5143650,Bstar,2016-10-06 17:24:00,564,"Lol! I hope they keep me happy! Yeah, I seen those crazy posts about Bobby's Corner."
5145202,northerneyes,2016-10-08 05:45:00,72,I have been pondering what would happen to Cabelas ever since Jim Cabelas death earlier this year. I guess the sale really shouldn't be a surprise. Always liked Cabelas and purchased tons of items from them over the years. I have a Cabelas Visa card so that has always been a good way to accumulate points to buy all kinds of goodies.
5145210,Joek3,2016-10-08 05:48:00,244,The owner of Bass Pro is Johnny Morris who founded the company. He is not ethnic. You can google him. Guy is a billionaire and they bought the entire Cabelas business.
5145242,pjshorthorn,2016-10-08 06:43:00,5654,You have slightly misstated the transition of this merger. There intends to be a food truck at each of the legacy Cabelas location; not a restaurant. PjShorthorn
5145250,Bstar,2016-10-08 06:47:00,564,Will it be BYOB at the food trucks?
5145266,Bstar,2016-10-08 06:57:00,564,Weby13 was making a parody of a post on the Bobby's Corner thread. If you read the thread you will know what I mean. I don't think his intent was to disrespect Johnny Morris. His post was pretty funny though!
