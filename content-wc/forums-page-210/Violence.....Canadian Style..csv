5170529,pjshorthorn,2016-10-26 18:45:00,5654,"I have stared into the eye of the beaver. It is not a good feeling to see that glare. They are nimble and crafty and before you know it.......you are getting whacked in the "" naughty bits"" when they launch a full frontal assault over the bow of the boat. I'm serious when I say this.....it looks like a pod of flying squirrels coming over the bow with ""fangs this long"" being presented as deadly weapons; then they spin 180 degrees and start the whacking attack. PjShorthorn"
5170858,Mike Borger,2016-10-27 05:08:00,1554,"Agreed, staring into their beady little soulless flat black eyes is a glimpse straight into he11.This is worth sharing, if for no other reason than to raise awareness.In this chilling account an angry beaver actually took a Latvian man hostage:http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/211481Beware people!"
5170882,pjshorthorn,2016-10-27 05:33:00,5654,"The truth in what can truly happen has been told. One aspect from the article that doesn't line up with my experiences is that beavers tend to go for your right nipple.......not your leg. I think they consider the right nipple a delicacy of sorts. I've never been confronted by a beaver that is a ""lefty"" so I guess they may go for the left nipple . In the event you are in a stare down with an angry beaver, don't forget about your nipples. PjShorthorn"
5170906,Mike Borger,2016-10-27 05:43:00,1554,Good point! You need a titanium nipple guard Pat!
5171026,pjshorthorn,2016-10-27 06:49:00,5654,"Is that the right or left nippled model ? Pretty hard to tell from the picture . Where can you order some of these? My only concern is that a fella could end up looking like a Vikequeen crossing the sea , but I guess ""safety third"" is really important when facing a formidable foe. PjShorthorn"
5186745,Darrenf442,2016-11-04 22:55:00,1369,"Beavers can become aggressive in the fall because parasites , flees and other bug irritating the skin. The weather is cooling off and the beaver being warm blooded gives a warm home to the little critters. Only way to solve this is to shave the beaver and then give it a good scrubbing."
5186897,Mike Borger,2016-11-05 06:25:00,1554,"I'm not going to touch this, but it's tempting."
5186929,Bstar,2016-11-05 07:21:00,564,It is impossible to fight the temptation because touching a shaved beaver is truly a zen like experience!

5168553,Bstar,2016-10-25 17:08:00,564,Nothing worse then a hissing beaver..........
5169249,Pooch,2016-10-26 07:23:00,4619,"Guess you folks have drunken schmucks up there, too. Thought we had most of them. Maybe not.Pooch"
5169609,Mike Borger,2016-10-26 09:42:00,1554,"Rogue beavers are a huge problem in Canada, but vigilante justice is NOT the answer!We need to let the police handle things and do what they've been trained to do. Otherwise we become as bad as the beavers themselves. Malicious killers of innocent trees with horribly rancid breathe and spreaders of fever.We're better than that people!"
5169625,Bakefish,2016-10-26 09:52:00,1077,Aint that the truth. Never had to beat one with a chair though.
5169657,LOW1,2016-10-26 09:57:00,2828,Where were the curling brooms and hockey sticks? At the least a Canadian baseball bat could have been used - few of them were used for their intended purpose in October anyway.
5169721,v-bay gord,2016-10-26 10:36:00,3168,Time to call in the Beaver Police Department. Who knew there was such a thing!? http://beaverpolice.us/
5169729,pjshorthorn,2016-10-26 11:00:00,5654,You ought to see what beavers do to ya when you go and jump their dams getting back into remote lakes. A whole gang of them chase you incessantly from fishing spot to fishing spot wedging limbs in the prop and slapping the heck out of the boat. I used an oar to try and remove limbs one time and they chewed the snot out of it until it looked liked a nub of a pencil from grammar school. It was pretty dang scary........... PjShorthorn.
5169777,v-bay gord,2016-10-26 11:36:00,3168,"Yes, Beavers can be very scary. Here's a short instructional video to help you understand the visual cues before a beaver attack. Take note of the eyes, ears, and the pouty look. Warning, this video contains graphic images of an enraged beaver. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CF1-DLAzwLM"
5170089,bigwalleye1,2016-10-26 14:23:00,2632,Perhaps it were a case of Beaver Fever that afflicted the poor devil.
