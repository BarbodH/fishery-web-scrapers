Most fishing was done buy other people in the mourning and towards night. That's what it was, fishing during the day was almost nothing. All small walleyes, smallmouth were not bad at all but not very many for us. Northern fishing was slow also. Weather was up and down. Not what I expected at all for Canada. Your week might be better who knows."
