5182601,mickr,2016-11-02 16:43:00,74,Hi I haven't been up the Clova road in some time and was planning a trip in 2017 that will require a long drive up that road. Anyone know if there have their been any improvements to that road in the past 5 years? thanks

That being said I did pick up a nail in Parant but was able to get through to a repair station two hours later. We could maintain a speed of about 50 mph on much of the road. A caution through whenever you come to a turn, slow it down. It would be amazing if they ever get that road paved but I don't think it will happen in my lifetime."

The lower half can be good but the upper part that goes to Clova is said to be tough . All of the outfitters that work out of Clova or beyond will tell you it is impassable and you should take white knuckle road through Parent or come in from Senneterre which is a good road now. There is a video on youtube of an off road motorcycle chap that took the Clova road and he shows one bridge that he had to repair before he dared cross with his bike and it looked pretty scary. The rumors still persist that this road is being renovated . Let us know if you take it.
