Located in far northwestern Ontario, it lies 500 kilometers north of Sioux Lookout close to the Manitoba border. Easily the furthest north operating camp within the province.Its waters have rarely been fished, and the surrounding lakes accessible by camp float plane are still unknown. They have yet to be fished by anyone! Future guests will have the opportunity to explore lakes that are truly virgin.We had some pretty amazing fishing for incredible numbers of lake trout, trophy northern pike, and as many walleyes as we wanted. My full report on this trip is forthcoming, but in the meantime I put together this 20 minute feature video. Have a look! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fNfNNxAa2E"

But with fish just jumpin in the boat like that,...doesn't that put a guides job at risk ?!!!!! I guess they could still take you and pray like heck that they win the contest so you would have to cater to their needs---dishes, fix meals, etc !!! Heheheheeeee!! Great video!Chuck"
5195434,bthomas3333,2016-11-14 14:12:00,465,Thanks for posting the great video. The reason for the kinda is because last winter I emailed them about taking a smaller group of 2 and the rate was really high. At 4 guys the rate drops back to high normal. After seeing this I should've paid the high rate to fish with only two guys. Do you think there is any scenario where they will split the camp between 2 or 3 smaller groups next year? B-

I know they were taking things slow. It's Shaun Szachury running the camp (great young man). Knowing him my educated guess is, yes, he would take a couple of smaller groups together. Preference is one large group for sure, but that's not always possible. Pretty sure 6 guys would have the whole lodge to themselves.Probably worth a phone call!"
