We live in south western Ontario near London. 10-12 hr drive at the very max ( figured we could travel at night for the most part) walleye and pike would be the preferred catch. And somewhere that doesn't break the bank so 1000 for each dad. I'd like to use camp boats. And catching enough fish to kept the kids entertained is a must so lake nipissing is out We were looking at woods cabins on oba lake but the train to there was cancelled Not sure if there's a good camp near chapleau, fished that area on a fly in and liked it Thx"

Island 10, Garden Island and Red Pine all offer American Plan. Ellen Island offers housekeeping. Lady E has good to great walleye fishing as well as smallmouth. We never spent a lot of time fishing for pike but they are there. We have stayed at Island 10 and would recommend and Ellen Island which we liked but the diwnside is its the furthest away from the best fishing in my opinion.Other option would be a fly in with White River Air. We have fished Pickle Lake and Shekak. Based on your description Pickle would be perfect. Nice thing about white river and those two cabins is they are quite deluxe for outposts. Generator power, hot and cold running water w an indoor toilet and showerI have never been with them but air dale out of Wawa gets many great reviews as well and per someone else Mike Borger could certainly help as he has done many fly ins w air daleheersGordy"
