Along the north highway, stopped in Mattice briefly enough to recruit a partner in adventure, the Agent Stevie Zebco. A quick tour further north for trout and pike, campfires and big water fun, the usual turned a little unusual but as always, it was an experience... This is that story...http://bunksoutdoorangle.com/humpbac...ple-moonshine/Down in Florida there was this hurricane named Eddie that made a big ole mess to clean up. Couple days later my hairy, pale arse landed in the Sunshine State for a week of shark fishing. Teeth and grit, sweat and spit, I'm rather thankful to the surf, sands and fish God's for some great southern hospitality, full moons and rows and rows and rows of razor sharp teeth that didn't bite any toes off. And that is this story...http://bunksoutdoorangle.com/hurrica...-bully-sharks/"
