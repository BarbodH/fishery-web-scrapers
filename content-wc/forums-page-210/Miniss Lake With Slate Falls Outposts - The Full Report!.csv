Verne runs an impressive operation so that was no surprise at all.We battled some really horrible weather on our trip, with quite a bit of rain, wind and cool weather, but we toughed it out and persevered.I managed to figure out the pike - kind of. Considering what we faced in terms of weather and the size of the lake I was quite pleased catching a handful of giants. Precisely how and where we caught them was interesting I thought.Walleye fishing was predictably easy, and the other two members of my group who focused on them put some incredible numbers in their boat. I'm not going to say exactly how many here, but on a couple of days especially it was a lot!There were a number of other highlights including some close encounters with wildlife and a BIZARRE incident that involved a sacrifice to the fish gods and a pepperette. If you want to read about it you can find all of the gory details right here: http://www.canadafishingguide.net/the-magic-of-miniss/Cheers"

5174353,Bstar,2016-10-29 07:33:00,564,Another great report Mike! Hopefully the big pike bite will be a little better when we are up there next August. I'm going to try one of those Svartzonkers on them. They won't be able to resist that! Gotta love that name...Svartzonker! Lol
5174545,Mike Borger,2016-10-29 09:12:00,1554,"Brian, I doubt the pattern will be much different for big pike when you're there. My feeling is if unlike me you're fortunate enough to have stable weather 7-8 big fish is realistic as opposed to 3-4. IF you actually focus on them. The lake is a walleye factory so it's easy to get sidetracked."
5174889,Bstar,2016-10-29 14:13:00,564,"Heck, I'll be happy with one 40""+ pike. My personal best is 37"". I doubt that we will be as dedicated to the pike fishing like you are but we will spend some time hunting for them. I'm sure we will get sidetracked with the walleye fishing though."
5175929,adempsey2.0,2016-10-30 10:45:00,612,"Great report Mike! Looks like a spectacular camp and fishery. Before I get into one of those multi-hook predicaments, I've decided to remove ""extra"" trebles and pinch down all the hook barbs on my lures. Still cannot believe the pepperette story. That's something else."

5176169,Mike Borger,2016-10-30 14:17:00,1554,"Brian, I hate to make bold statement, but yeah, you will definitely get at least one 40. Quote: Originally Posted by adempsey2.0Great report Mike!

It's specifically made to replace trebles on crankbaits. I can say with authority the hooking percentage is nowhere near trebles. Pinching down the barbs is another story.Quote: Originally Posted by bthomas3333Hey Mike,I think I remember hearing you were going to visit Echoing Lake.

I'm just starting that write up now and it will be done in due time. First order of business is editing over 1600 photos and 132 separate video clips LOL! It was absolutely incredible, just crazy numbers of fish."
