It's crazy how remote and uncivilized the northern parts of saskatchewan, manitoba, and ontario are. They're some of the last truly pristine and untouched north american wilderness areas left. It's so nice being able to camp on a huge lake for a couple weeks and not see another soul the entire time you're up there!"
