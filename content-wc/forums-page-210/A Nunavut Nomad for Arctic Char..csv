5165914,Moosebunk,2016-10-23 22:56:00,211,"One of the most remote communities within our Canadian arctic, this past summer I had the opportunity to travel north to Kugaaruk Nunavut. Little known and nothing written of the fishing there, during a month long work contract my hope was to explore the tundra at every chance, and find and catch some of the most incredibly beautiful fish on the planet. Immersed in Inuit life and culture, providing healthcare within a unique setting and wandering the land like a lone nomad, the experience and arctic char fishing was all truly exceptional. Any interested in reading more, the whole story is written here...http://bunksoutdoorangle.com/a-nunav...r-arctic-char/ Bunk."

5166521,DeBo,2016-10-24 10:58:00,211,Great report as always!! Very cool that you have your own site now as well. Now I don't have to go searching all over OFN to find the old reports!
5166889,retire55,2016-10-24 14:59:00,1029,"Another awesome read Bunk. While it doesn't come close to expressing my gratitude, I'll just say thank you."
5167009,1K1MOA,2016-10-24 17:17:00,90,"What a great article! Thanks for taking the time to post it. The landscape there is ""other"" worldly. The Pic of the flame orange-red Char was incredible. Your glimpse into the lives you were serving while there was also very interesting. Thanks again for sharing."
5167673,vteye2,2016-10-25 09:29:00,123,"Truly enjoyed the report - arctic and its char are worthy bucket list pursuits. I fished char out of Pangnirtung, Baffin island back in 84 on a drop off unguided hiking, fishing trip. Yearn to get back to the Arctic. IMO you will not catch a more beautiful freshwater fish than spawning char."
5167905,yoopertrout,2016-10-25 11:48:00,1172,"Very cool!. It's especially interesting to see the the different colors of the char. Also, beautiful coloration on the lakers. I hope to fish somewhere north of the tree line someday."

Am surely hoping to get there one day and could care less if I fish or not. Really just want to hike around Mt.Odin and Thor Peak and take some photos. Most would say it's the most beautiful town in Nunavut."
