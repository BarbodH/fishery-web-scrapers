5169825,gordy28,2016-10-26 12:28:00,437,Hey guys Have tried searching for reports or details on Sim Lake withough much luck We are action lake guys for walleye - trophys are great but prefer catching lots of fish as opposed to searching for 25+ inchers. Dont spend a ton of time targetting Pike - say 20% of the time Also interested in the cabin - nice? A place to charge electronics? Cheers Gordy
