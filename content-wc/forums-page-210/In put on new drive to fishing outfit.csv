I was thinking along the $150 US a day Per person making it $1050 for 7 days? As well as would you take this trip."
5190498,vteye2,2016-11-08 12:53:00,123,"I've fished couple hours north of Chibogamau up on Lac Albanel. Are you looking at outpost camp or part of a outfitter territory?I would want to know how big the lake system is, how many other campsare on the lake? How long has the camp been in operation and feedbackfrom others who have fished it? Have you been to the camp, condition?"
5190642,octanehi5,2016-11-08 16:35:00,1104,"the outfitter that owns the rights does not have a good rating,the lakes are 40 miles long, the camps will be new and up to date,the fishing is very good,Thinking of buying the rights but would have to build the business from the bottom up.need the in put to see what its worth?"
5190666,Fisherman Ted,2016-11-08 16:57:00,461,"So are you asking this question from an owners point of view? As in, if I bought this place what would be a good price point?"
5190746,Fisherman Ted,2016-11-08 20:04:00,461,So the way I read it you are thinking about buying this place and going into the business. Good for you! I would search this board for threads that talk about doing exactly that. There are so many other things to consider than the few you mention above. Polling people on this board on what they would pay for a week is just the tip of the iceberg. If you call me or PM me I would be happy to assist as I just went through this a few years ago. -Fisherman Ted

5191466,mickr,2016-11-09 17:02:00,74,"Hello Octanesomething I think you need to consider is the Canadian dollar. Based on where that resort is, I think you are looking at having to attract a lot of Canadian clientele to keep yourself afloat. When I convert the number you quoted in to Canadian dollars it is on the high side price wise. I've read a lot on this board and I've seen the arguments. You can't charge 150 US for example to one guy and 150 Cdn to the next. I have read all of that and see both points of view. The problem that you'll encounter is one guy viewing your pricing as pretty reasonable and the other guy viewing it as expensive. I book two trips a year for 3 to 4 nights for anywhere from 6 to 8 guys and I've been doing that for a long long time (thankfully I don't need t spend 18 hours in a car to get in to quality fishing and remote wilderness). I am pretty familiar with the different opportunities from Val D'or across to the Gouin but that said there are literally hundreds of them so I don't know them all. But personally I have a policy and that is I don't go to resorts that charge American currency because I can find better value in resorts that charge me Canadian currency. I am Canadian and I know from the fishing communities I frequent that I am not alone in operating my group that way. So.....without wanting to re-hash any of the currency debates that I've seen on this board, personally I think this is an issue that you need to think about. It may be different for the resorts in northwest Ontario that have a heavy American clientele but I am not sure, based on location, that this will be the case for you. Just my 2 cents....which is really only 1.5 cents cause I'm Canadian"
5191818,octanehi5,2016-11-10 05:36:00,1104,"This kind of input is just what I am looking for.Lets say 150$Canadian a day that's 1050$a week. breaking that down in american at 25% exchange its $787.50 american. I feel that's a good price for a well outfitted Drive to Camp In excellent fishing area, New camps, boats, motors,"
