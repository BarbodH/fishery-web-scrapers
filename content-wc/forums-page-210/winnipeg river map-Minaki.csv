Fish the windswept bays with a no. 4 or 6 hook and a split shot....Leeches make the best bait this time of year. You can usualy find the eyes in 4 to 18 ft in these bay areas....look for ones that the wind is blowing INTO with rubble or sand beaches...also check out the points around Harbor Island area...fish the plain hook-leeche setup with a little more weight from 8 to 35 ft. Points off bays often produce walleyes with this same rigging adding a bobber in the rocks off the point across from slanted rock, and the small bay SE of Honeymoon island. Keep your rigging simple....plain hook, add a green bead if you like...just a basic lindy rig...buy a pack of no 4 and no 6 eagle claw hooks, some weights, a bobber or two, hey...you're in business for Minaki walleyes! there's lots and lots of great spots for eyes in the Minaki area, some of my favorites are on the northern end of Big Sand...Good luck, I'm sure you'll enjoy the area...."
