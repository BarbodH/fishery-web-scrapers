6747213,jambi,2023-06-28 09:51:00,504,Johnson's no doubt. Most of my pike fishing is in shallow (<10') water and I can throw the silver minnow through the slop with ease. I spent a week in Alaska last year and fished 80% with the silver minnow and 20% with a bucktail. Now if I want to fish to deeper water or troll I'd switch to a doctor/daredevle/Krocodile/Williams Wabler/etc etc style of spoon.
6747315,Old Timer,2023-06-28 21:48:00,255,"I mentioned the doctor and silver minnow above. Here's one I forgot the Len Thompson spoon. The five of diamonds and potato bug patterns have been effective for me. Many years ago someone smarter than me said shallow lakers, char and snakes prefer the Thompson spoon over a daredevle. He was right. I've used them all in the Arctic and I caught way more fish on the Thompson than the daredevle. The Thompson has a different kind of wiggle that fish seem to like."
6747345,Peterpikes,2023-06-29 05:32:00,33,"I do have success with both those, but I recommend trying a Eppinger red eye wiggler, the yellow 5 of diamonds color."
6747495,chunger21,2023-06-29 18:33:00,11,Johnson silver minnow with white grub is the go to. I have fished the doctor spoon a lot also and does well but the paint comes off them after a couple of fish. Shouldn't have to pay that much for a lure and then the paint comes off after a few fish. They need to figure out how Eppinger keeps the paint on their lures.
6747503,RichA$1970,2023-06-29 20:00:00,1158,Here’s a new Dr Spoon I used last month and not too many or big pike I caught off it and the paint just chipped off. For what they charge they should at least put a clear coat on them. Someone already mentioned but a Mepps Syclops is also a solid spoon.
6747625,emma17,2023-06-30 10:34:00,436,Five of Diamonds. I think the smartest Northern Pike got together and built a marketing plan of pure propaganda for this lure. Every trip I take I dedicate time to the Five of Diamonds as the result of their propaganda plan. Still haven't caught a fish yet w this lure.
6746513,Bakefish,2023-06-25 11:09:00,1077,Has anyone ever changed the location of the hook on a doctor spoon? I'm talking back to front. I've heard it rides higher and is semi weedless.
6746591,pjshorthorn,2023-06-25 18:00:00,5654,Never tried it but YellowBird advertises that it can be fished that way .soooooo it has to work. LOL. PjShorthorn
6746757,MrSimon,2023-06-26 12:43:00,922,"Doctor Spoons work fine but not any better than anything else. Same with the Johnson silver minnow. Even on remote lakes the fish get conditioned to seeing the same lures over and over. I really like to find things that are a bit different and not so main stream. The bigger Phoebe lures have always been lights out for me. People don't throw them that much and the pike absolutely love them!! If I had to pick one pike lure, that would be it."
6746775,NorthernExposure,2023-06-26 14:09:00,6,"Dr spoons are $13 a piece now??? My best success has been on a Mepps Syclops, usually I start with the orange. My second favorite spoon is a little cleo in red. Never had much luck with the Johnson silver minnow."
6746783,reconssd,2023-06-26 14:27:00,147,"Thanks to everyone who has responded so far. There's some great content in the replies. I've never heard of the phoebe. I'll definitely check it out. I also agree with throwing something that's a little different that the fish have never seen before. The cost of lures is ridiculous. When I started going to Canada, grandma baits were $5.99. Now they're $19.99 and it's the exact same lure."
6747099,MOJO !!!,2023-06-27 17:32:00,2,Anyone know the brand of this jig? Notice the bend in the hook. Need more of these. Can’t find them online. Thank you in advance for the assist.
6747121,Moosebunk,2023-06-27 19:21:00,211,"They're called Knuckleballs I believe. Have had a few kicking around here for years, never used 'em."
6747123,Moosebunk,2023-06-27 19:27:00,211,"Two Ontario 49""ers and four 48""ers all on Williams. Johnson Silver Minnow, Eppinger Husky Jr and dressed Bluefox Vibrax Spinners #5 & #7 blades have all taken some 45 to 47.5""ers. Just placed an order for six Doctor Spoons, never bothered with 'em before."
6747159,pjshorthorn,2023-06-28 02:53:00,5654,Yep $13 -$14 depending on the color and style. Everywhere I look the price range is fairly consistent unless there is a special sale. PjShorthorn
6747195,adempsey2.0,2023-06-28 07:30:00,611,"These 'old' spoons still do the trick! On one trip the Krocodile/Crocodile spoons did some serious damage fishing for big pike! I only have small Phoebe spoons for ice fishing, but never considered the larger ones. Might have to find some. I love fishing the classic spoons - although, most spoons I use have been around for 50+ years.I use Silver Spoons and Doctor Spoons differently. So, I would not normally replace one with the other. That being said, I never actually fished a Silver Spoon outside of casting into cabbage. I am a big fan of Doctor Spoons [and it will usually be the first lure on my rod], but Williams, Len Thompson, Eppinger all clearly all make very effective spoons. The paint doesn't come off after 5 pike either....."
6746299,reconssd,2023-06-24 12:46:00,147,"This question is for the pike anglers. If you could only bring 1 spoon on your trip, which would it be? Our records indicate Johnson silver minnow tipped with a 3 inch white twister tail. We have fished a bunch of other spoons, daredevils, etc.. Nothing has out produced the silver minnow."
6746323,NETim1187,2023-06-24 14:57:00,166,Lots o' weeds? Johnson Minnow Clear(er) water? Red Eye/Doctor/Daredevle
6746335,Camoclad,2023-06-24 16:37:00,628,I would take the Dr every time. I don't get near the strikes on the Johnson as with a Dr spoon. I usually swap the treble for a siwash hook. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
6746341,Old Timer,2023-06-24 17:14:00,255,"I seldom target northern pike. But when I do, it's either a doctor spoon or a silver minnow with a tail."
6746343,lionfan19,2023-06-24 17:17:00,41,"As we found out three weeks ago, the doctor spoon was very effective. The only issue I had with it was when we got into that shallower stuff with all the dead weeds from the previous year. Thats where the silver minnow was clearly the better choice. Now that the lessons of that last trip have started to sink in I am considering changing some of those doctor spoons over to single hooks and putting a grub on them. Wondering if this will allow them to get through those dead weeds more efficiently."
6746377,RichA$1970,2023-06-24 19:00:00,1158,They make Dr Spoons weedless. Both are good plus a Williams Whitefish gold/silver dimpled.
6746379,Walleye Wanderer,2023-06-24 19:13:00,101,"Johnson Silver minnow when weedy, Williams Wabler (silver) when not too weedy. Occasionally change out treble on the Wabler for a single hook."
6746451,pjshorthorn,2023-06-25 04:53:00,5654,"I like both the Silver Minnow and the Doctor Spoon. I have weedless and plain spoons. If I have to chose I'm going with the Doctor with some modifications. I change the hook a siwash for ease of releasing the fish, but also add a coordinating color bass skirt and twister tail/grub. In the pic with the firetiger patten, the paint was almost completely gone by the end of the week. The hammered nickel version took my largest pike to date so far @. 45 1/2 PjShorthorn"
6746477,Mojo-NC,2023-06-25 07:23:00,1929,"I too would choose the Doctor Spoon. To date I've used the spoon as it comes right out of the box with the standard treble hooks, but I like the modifications to give the spoon a little more pizzaz and to make it more snag free. I have a bunch of size 5 Siwash hooks, but they seem maybe too large? Which size do you use? Also, which way to you connect the hook when the painted side of the spoon is up, pointing up or down?"
6746495,pjshorthorn,2023-06-25 09:52:00,5654,"These are the specs on the Doctors that I bought and have had good success with.- Weedless version is model P585. 1 3/16 Oz and 4 in long in various colors. I put skirts and a large curly tail on. - Standard Spoon version is model P285. 1 3/16 oz and 4” long in various colors. I put a #5 siwash hook on ….I think . Could be a #4. From eye to hook bend is 2 1/4”. Gap is 1” . when holding the spoon vertical, the hook points down ( or towards the underside of the spoon…). No skirt or curly tail. I think they ruin the action of a standard spoon.Pricing from vendor to vendor is about the same. I bought all mine from Walmart quite some time ago only because shipping was free to a store near me. Color patterns will vary the price per spoon and current availability spin off of color and detail. Some colors/patterns are hard to find. Bass Pro, Yellow Bird, WalMart all carry them. Maybe Fish USA. too.Do your self a favor and get some standard spoons in Orange/ Hammered Copper along with the weedless version in same orange . They have been a go ;to color for consistent bites.Not cheap lures, but all I know is that they work.Hope this helps.PjShorthorn"
