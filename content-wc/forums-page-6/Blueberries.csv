6747735,Eckohlt,2023-06-30 18:38:00,3685,Someone with a fish clicker must have sat next to a bear and hit that clicker for each berry he ate.

6747489,Eckohlt,2023-06-29 17:47:00,3685,do they grow better in a fire?
6747491,Huntindave,2023-06-29 17:56:00,2194,"I imagine the bears are eating the berries that are available. In fact, blueberries are a critical part of a bear's diet. During the time when blueberries are abundant in July and August, per North American Bear Center, bears love to munch on blueberries. Black bears can reportedly eat up to 30,000 berries each day in a good year Â— that's a lot of berries. Berries offer a high-calorie and vitamin-dense food source for these foraging omnivores and The University of Calgary reports that a large, male grizzly can eat as many as 200,000 berries in a single day."
6747493,Eckohlt,2023-06-29 18:15:00,3685,"I guess we're alittle light on the blueberries we add to pancakes,alittle shy of 30,000.have to kick it up a notch to keep up with yogi."
6747505,KC Walleye,2023-06-29 21:02:00,274,I wanna watch that show the bear puts on while eating 200k. That's 2.5 berries per second for 24 hours straight .lol. Would be interesting
6747513,N_of_Quibell,2023-06-29 21:40:00,151,And they apparently don't like competition:https://northernontario.ctvnews.ca/a...bear-1.5042604
6747519,Ohio fisherman,2023-06-30 01:09:00,988,"Years ago in Montana while trout fishing in a mountain stream, I was distracted by a beautiful patch of huckleberries - similar to wild blueberries. I started picking and munching, then heard some commotion that I thought was my buddy picking huckleberries on the other side of the bushes. Just then my buddy walked up beside me. He informed me that a very disoriented black bear jumped out of the bushes and ran off. We suspected that it may have been sleeping after enjoying the berries."
6747525,Wallychowder,2023-06-30 04:06:00,1567,Next time your in Canada ask a local about blueberries and fire ......LOL.
6747527,BIGUGLY,2023-06-30 04:38:00,17,"Yes they grow better after a fire or logging. Once they get established and can get sun and nutrients they grow like mad, until the trees start to grow back. Once the trees get a new start you have a few years till they choke out the blueberries."
6747551,grizzley,2023-06-30 06:29:00,2518,"Don't need to go that far, on top of a mountain by our town in Pa, huckleberry fires were intentionally set every few years, but not anymore, locals picked huckleberries there for years. I believe it was for the same reason BIGUGLY posted, so trees and other growth wouldn't choke them out."
