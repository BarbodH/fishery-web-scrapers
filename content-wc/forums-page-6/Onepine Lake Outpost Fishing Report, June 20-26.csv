6747151,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2023-06-27 22:51:00,240,"Just returned yesterday from our annual Onepine Lake outpost trip with Nestor Falls Outfitters. Our group of four drove to Nestor Falls on June 19 and flew in to our outpost camp early on the 20th. The first day of our trip was marked by a massive thunderstorm complete with several inches of rain, large hail, and howling winds, which caused us to run down to the dock and pull our boats high and dry, fearing they might swamp if left tied to the dock. We did get some good fishing in the afternoon, but the scorching 90-degree heat broke our resolve to fish for very long. We each caught about 15 walleye that afternoon, ensuring a great first-day fish fry. Later in the evening, about 11:30, we were treated to a heat-lightning show that was unlike anything I had ever seen. The flashes of lightning illuminated the horizon for 4-5 seconds at a time. The northern lights pushed through the looking glass. On Tuesday, an 84-degree day saw the blackflies come out in huge numbers, and they were an issue the entire week. Simply murderous, and deet spray did little to deter them. Fishing was great, overall. We caught real good numbers of the 18-20"" walleye, which are such fun on medium-light tackle and small jigs. My average day saw 60-70 walleye landed and released. We are getting to know the lake much better each year, and finding and marking the mid-lake humps was key to finding the bigger fish. Fishing Strawberry Lake, a short portage through the woods, was a real highlight of the week. Catching 50 walleye in the 16-19"" range was simple, and much larger numbers were taken by those willing to bear the blackflies, mosquitoes, and the discomfort of fishing in a very small, leaky boat, which saw my knees come up to my chin in this tiny boat. Having had both of my knees replaced the past few years made for some uncomfortable fishing. But the fishing in this medium-sized lake is so outstanding that I made 3 separate trips to Strawberry during the week. On one occasion, my brother Rob and I caught 157 beautiful walleye in 2 1/2 hours. Rob uses a clicker to get exact counts, so this can be reported in all accuracy. The highlight of the trip for me came on a day-5 trip to what we call Indian beach, named after a small structure and dock adjacent to the main lake, located on a nice sand beach. There are a pair of submerged rocks in this lake area, dropping down to 29 feet and coming back up to create a pair of nice humps in this area of the lake. On this day, my boat partner Dave and I were having some great luck with the bigger walleye, boating close to 8-10 of the 20-24"" beauties which are so much fun on medium-light tackle. Anyway, a few minutes before we decided to quit for the morning, I hooked into an absolute tank--here is the outcome, exactly as I journalized it later that day: ""just before going in, I hooked into what I knew was the best fish of the trip. I was using my Daiwa SS 1300 reel, paired with a 7-foot ML Cabela's XML rod, and the fish was stripping line from the drag at will, just pounding for the bottom with powerful head shakes, making the rod tip jump 2 feet with each run. When the fish finally surfaced neat the boat, I couldn't believe it--the heaviest walleye I had ever seen, in perfect profile--black, gold, huge tail, massive head. As we landed the fish, the tiny 1/4 ounce fireball jig popped free. Measuring the fish quickly showed a walleye of between 30 and 31 inches, and what I considered to be 12 pounds, but we'll never know. A quick, perfect release means that fish is still out there. Nothing to do at that point but to just go in for the morning. I was simply shaking."" As a point of reference, I have caught over 30 hawg walleye in the boundary waters in my life, so I feel like I was able to estimate the weight of this fish fairly accurately. The huge tail, thick belly, giant head, and large, dark eyes were unlike anything I have ever seen. The black and gold coloration only added to the beauty of this tank. I may never see another fish like that in my life. Again, those of you that fish Lac Seul probably wouldn't be impressed, but, to me, so incredible. Easily the best walleye I have ever caught at an outpost. Anyway, what a great week. Great fishing, good friendships, delicious fish fries, plus a portage lake that gave up lots of walleye for anyone willing to go in and spend a few hours there. Already looking forward to my second trip with NFO in August, at Clear Lake. I hope everyone is having a great fishing season so far."

6747169,gordy28,2023-06-28 05:18:00,437,Thanks for sharing sounds like an awesome trip!
6747181,epiepenburg,2023-06-28 05:58:00,365,"Awesome! We were just up at Clear two weeks ago for our annual trip. Recording our second highest total of fish in our 20 year history of going there. We also believe that we had some of the best numbers of 20-24"" fish this past trip as well."
6747183,kona77,2023-06-28 06:10:00,236,"Thanks for the report. A 30"" walleye on any fly-in lake is a real trophy to remember.."
6747193,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2023-06-28 07:29:00,240,That is great to hear--we are going to Clear in early August. Was your whole crew able to make it back up there?
6747199,epiepenburg,2023-06-28 07:57:00,365,"We've had a few different guys over the years, some of us rotate in and out. One of the main group made last year his last year, which is why I went. I personally hadn't been up there since 2018. We might be losing two of the other guys for next year."
