It all started in SS class in January, wife and I had talked about numerous trips to canada, and some of the guys started inquiring about going, cost, the like. To sum it up, we have 4 of us doing train in at end of month with yes, yours truly being the chicken herder. As in I have to provide all the tackle and lures, not that I don't have enough for an army, along with packing directions, food, the whole nine yards. You all get the drift of what i'm facing here. Everything. So last nite at church, one of the guys walked up to me and asked about fileting pike. Said he had been watching videos on utube on how to do so. The one plus here is that he is a retired butcher. Hey I think to myself, I can pawn off fish cleaning. So we talk a little and he then asks if there are pike in canada ? Trying to keep a straight face, I say yes there are. And I discuss the numerous biteoffs that will occur. I call them smash/grab. Somehow slime comes up. He had read something about soaking them in something to get rid of slime. Do they really have slime ? Now I want to roll on floor laughing..... Sometimes after doing this for 30 yrs, you forget how much 'common' knowledge you have accumulated vs a newbie. stayed tuned as we have get together saturday nite to go over things."

They are excited to catch it and can't believe they should throw it back. When I tell them they will be tired of catching that size pike by the end of the week they say there isn't any way that could be possible. By the end of the week they have to admit the truth and are calling them hammer handles, snakes, and slimers."
