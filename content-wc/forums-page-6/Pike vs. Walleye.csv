6747249,MrSimon,2023-06-28 14:29:00,922,"We joke about small pike being dangerous in the boat, but it can honestly get scary fast. Especially if you are remote. I've had to dig multiple barbed hooks out of fingers on fly-ins. It's nasty, painful, and scary. Things I take seriously now:First aid kit in the boat at all timesTwo pairs of LONG needle nose pliers in each boatSmash all barbs real flatHave heavy dudty hook cutters in boatI wear neoprene fishing gloves with the finger tips exposed - It's amazing how much these protect my handsPAY ATTENTION and respect the fish - you get hurt when you get lazyLastly but important - small pike never come in the boat and never get netted - ever - reach over the side and pinch the fish behind the head (gently) and use pliers to remove hook. Quick and easy with no fuss."

6747137,Ohio fisherman,2023-06-27 21:24:00,988,"This is an interesting discussion. In Canada, I enjoy targeting walleye, smallmouth bass, and pike. I tailor my fishing to conditions, time of day, and location to be most successful catching. I enjoy catching the targeted and bonus species. I have caught up to 33 walleye, and yes walleyes have plenty of fight. (Try catching 8-10 pound walleyes on an ultralight rod.) My largest pike is 43+ and approximately 24 pounds. It put up a tremendous fight and could not be revived so it is a beautiful mount. I do not enjoy catching hammer handle pike. Big pike that grab a hooked walleye are always fun whether landed or not. Nobody is going to force me to record fish on a clicker. Likewise no fishing buddy is going to record my fish on his second, spare, backup, or emergency clicker. That would end an outing. For dinner walleye are great. Big ones make great fish chowder. (The prime eaters from Lake Erie, not the old breeders from Canada.) Pike are good if filleted properly AND the meat is not allowed to roll in the snot. Some pike just smell too much like weeds - they cannot help it. I would like to try the boiled or steamed pike. Now getting serious, I will take a plate of Perch over walleye or pike. The only fish I like as well, but is very different, is Pacific halibut."

6747191,adempsey2.0,2023-06-28 07:18:00,611,"That's never happened to me, but I don't find it at all surprising. I haven't found too many alternatives without having to resort to a 3-way rig or some other method for trolling deeper than 20-25 feet. Bandit and Mann's do make some deep divers that I am sure would work just as well. Although, a clip-on weight or 3-way rig isn't really that much of a problem to use."
6747197,RichA$1970,2023-06-28 07:54:00,1158,"Rapala’s design on tail dancers is very poor. The lip is a straight shaft instead of a self tapping or barbed design so the adhesive really doesn’t have anything to resist against on the shaft. I had in 1 week, I lost 2 tail dancers when I got the pike to the boat thinking it spit the lure out but only to see the lip attached to my leader. I also had a new large Xrap that I used last year on a fly in and the rear treble hook ripped out of the lure on a northern. Rapala’s work but Ive had 3 failures in the past year at around $45 so not very durable. Northland has a Rumble Stick that I’ll try but never used one this Fall."
6746861,NM_Trout,2023-06-26 19:08:00,1094,"LoL.. yes, but I am trying to keep them alive. I could club them over the noggin and that would make everything easier! I'm guessing the trick is to find a way to pin them down by the shoulders and get the spreader in."
6746863,Golden Eagle,2023-06-26 19:15:00,2642,Turn the spreaders 90 degrees to the right or to the left and they'll slide right in. Wiggle the spreaders a little bit to let the pike know what you're doing.
6746865,Eckohlt,2023-06-26 19:20:00,3685,"It's either the spreader forced in or your hand,take your pick,second choice bring a gross of band aids,lol"
6746975,stumcfar,2023-06-27 08:21:00,451,"Went for a quick trip to Buffalo Bay in Manitoba last night with my wife for walleye. Pulling shad raps, caught four of those stinking rotten northerns! It think it was karma for me ripping on them in an early post yesterday!! Speaking of mouth spreaders, on our fly in a few weeks ago, I unfortunately caught a northern and he had swallowed the jig. My buddy gave me his mouth spreader. I commented that I hoped I remembered to take it out of his mouth before I threw him back, as I have seen that done before. I got the hook out and dropped the northern over the side and yes, forgot to take the mouth spreader out. Luckily the fish was just starting to swim away and was able to grab him and retrieve it and then let him go! For the guy wanting to catch 100 pike a day casting over weeds, I will just say that I would take a 50 walleye day over 100 pike day any day of the week. I grew up on a small river and caught pike almost daily. I will target them on occasion in Canada, but rarely!"
6746993,Wallychowder,2023-06-27 09:36:00,1567,"Did you have your ""clicker"" with you last night ?......LOL."
6746997,Bakefish,2023-06-27 09:48:00,1077,"Have you ever been fishing for walleye and hooked what you thought was a monster walleye, only to find out it's a snot rocket? Or uttered the phrase, if this is a walleye it's a big one, and then bring up a 24"" pike. There is no comparison to the fighting quality between the two fish. As for taste. Many years ago I was on a houseboat trip on Rainy and we were debating the best tasting fish. So I conducted a blind taste test among 8 guys with northern, walleye and sm bass. To a man, pike won out. My stepson used to have a Christmas party where he invited all of his friends. One year he decided to have a giant fish fry. He had bluegill, crappie, perch, walleye and pike. We conducted a taste test. Again pike won, not unanimously, but by a wide margin."
6747015,Mojo-NC,2023-06-27 11:10:00,1929,It has been become somewhat of a tradition for us while we're in Canada to save a few nice norderns (Swedish pronunciation) just under the slot size over the course of the week and have a fish boil on Thursday evening before we leave to head home. It is quite tasty dipped in butter and served with taters and onions. There are lots of videos on YouTube showing how to filet the fish to remove the Y-bones that everyone seems to hate so much.
6747059,emma17,2023-06-27 13:58:00,436,"Unfortunately, over the last 12 years, I've tossed two Northern back into the lake w jaw spreaders still in. The kids still tease me. This year I had the whole plan in place. Gloves, sunglasses and the spreader. The wife went through the checklist w every Northern I caught. I didn't plan for the Northern that shook so violently he spit the jaw spreaders into the lake. The next pair will have a chord tied to my pants."
6747075,stumcfar,2023-06-27 15:45:00,451,Always have a clicker in the boat. Quick trip last night so didn't need it and could keep track in my head.

Get some good rod holders and let them do the work for you. If you really want to have fun, run a fire tiger pattern j-plug with a rattle behind the dipsey. Pike love the erratic movement of the plug."

It’s a great fight and the size can be frankly shocking. Pike is also a great tasting fish, but as others have mentioned, it is more of a “craft” to fillet and some people just can’t get over the smell and the slime. I, for one, can’t stand the smell, which generally steers me away from eating them, despite their great taste."

6746815,NM_Trout,2023-06-26 16:51:00,1094,"I really hate catching hammer handles though. The small and medium sized pike are the ones that cut you bad. The bigger ones you can grab inside the gills and still have some distance from the teeth. The smaller ones clamp down on jigs or flies or whatever, and trying to get them to open their dang mouths without hurting them is a huge PITA. We struggle to release small / med pike, even with barbless, single hooks. Is there a trick?"

6746827,Megatron,2023-06-26 17:39:00,13,"15 years ago, up near Taylor’s island on lac seul I hooked into a ‘run of the mill’ pike. While removing the hook she did the death roll in my hand, slid down and in slow motion I felt the hook slide under my right index fingernail. Torqued hard enough it snapped off the hook flush with the skin. Radioed our other boat, my brothers hopper in with them, and I drove back to the Hudson launch, loaded up and went to the emergency room. Doctor literally opened a closet up with ‘fish hook removal kits’ labeled on them. Shot my hand up, did some work with a large needle and pliers, got it out and was on my way. 650$ later . . .I Still chase after those things religiously. &#x1f919;&#x1f3fb;"
6746829,NM_Trout,2023-06-26 17:44:00,1094,"I have a pair. In order to get them in, you still have to open their mouth, and keep them from flopping around while you do it. The spreaders work great for pike that are north of 3# or so. Not great on little snot rockets."

6746449,kona77,2023-06-25 04:47:00,236,We like to fish for both and also use the 5 fillet method on pike to take care of Y-Bones. Back home in Wisc. we will pickle smaller pike and the y-bones just disintegrate during the brine process. All of my fishing buddy's like eating both. Some of our best memories in Canada are from bigger gators attacking walleye's we have caught on jigs.
6746729,10point,2023-06-26 11:13:00,102,"Just returned from Eagle Lake and I am starting to really like Pike fishing also. I think one thing that really helps is fishing with barbless hooks. Makes getting the lures out of those pike much easier. Also, must have a jaw spreader. If I didn't have barbless hooks and a jaw spreader I wouldn't want to mess with them either. I think some people are just scared of them maybe. I am now trying how to learn how to locate the bigger ones in anticipation for my return. Biggest I got this year was 30 inches. Suggestions? I know I probably need to go deeper but not exactly sure how to do that. Maybe I need to look at dipsy divers? Don't know if it's hard to hold a rod in your hand when using those or not. We rent a camp boat so must be able to hold rod in hand."

I don't understand running around a lake trying to find fish at different spots and wasting precious days of a trip. Call me whatever you want. I love to fish and catch them. TO each there own. Not sure what the dislike is for so many people on the fun people have with clickers??? I have caught walleye up 31.5"" and pike to 45"". Big fish are fun, but an afternoon of 17""-21"" walleye one after the other is amazing! I have caught more slimy pike in my lifetime than I want to remember. I don't want to get a hook in the hand on a fly in trip from one of those buggers. If I never catch another, I will be fine!"

6746755,MrSimon,2023-06-26 12:33:00,922,"Pike are a superior fish to walleye in every way! Pike fight harder, are more aggressive, feed throughout the day, get way bigger, are less selective, and taste better than walleye. I know they have teeth and slime and make a big ruckus in the boat. But go barbless and get a good set of fishing gloves and you'll never want to fish for walleye again. PS - for the guy who just wants to catch fish after fish after fish ... find some green cabbage in 3-10 FOW and cast a small Little Cleo. You'll catch 100 pike in a day."
6746205,Stickman8474,2023-06-24 03:13:00,39,"That's a valid point but my response was more within the frame of the original post, Walleye or Pike? Give me one fat 35-40"" northern over ten 15-20""walleye any time (except maybe dinner time). Never salt water fished but have friends who have caught Tarpon, You can hear the awe in their voices when they retell the stories, so there's no doubt tarpon are amazing fish."

That is when we jigged for walleye, but with the hope there was a large Esox Lucius roaming the depths ready to inhale our jig. As far as taste... the owner of the camp would often come to our cabin at night to check in and to make sure all our needs were met. He made it no secret that he did not like eating pike. One night he stopped in while we were frying fish. We told him it was walleye and gave him a few pike nuggets. He didn't know the difference."
6746279,h8go4s,2023-06-24 10:46:00,1673,"On my latest trip to Rainy Lake, I caught a 21"" walleye that I thought was a pike. It slammed my shiner, I fed it line and when it stopped I set the hook. Reeled it in a few feet and then it took off like a freight train. It made 3 good runs before I got it close enough to see it was a walleye. That was a couple of days after I had caught a 34-1/2"" pike on a shiner. Both netted, measured and released. Great fun."

I got the biggest PIKE I ever hooked on Lac Seul mid day, while fishing for Eyes. 42"" but had a 32""+ girth.. Didn't scale it ... didnt have one.. had to be 20+ lbs. took about 15 mins to land it..

6746145,Bakefish,2023-06-23 15:08:00,1077,"I'm always amazed at how few people target pike in Canada. Many times I have passed boats trying to shake off a pike at the side of the boat so they wouldn't have to bring it aboard. While I do like fishing for walleye I really love the action of a good pike bay. I have a good friend who explains his love for pike over walleye fishing this way...Pike eat walleye. Not only do I prefer pike fishing, but I also prefer eating pike. To me they have a much better taste. While I do like walleye, I think that their taste is too mild, sometimes almost tasteless. I know that I am in the minority on this, but that's the way I like it. Very little to no competition. I just don't understand spending a day catching 15-20"" walleye and counting them on a clicker and calling it a good trip.
