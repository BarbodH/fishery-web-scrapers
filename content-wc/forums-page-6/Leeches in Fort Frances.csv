6747645,Fisherman Ted,2023-06-30 12:10:00,461,Leeches are pretty much gone in NW Ontario. Have been for a few weeks. The very hot spring coupled with just a couple of trappers means short supply. Sunset Baits in Kenora which had one of the only supplies the past few weeks is basically out and assuming they are done for the season. I buy 10 lbs a week for my guests and I too gave up a few weeks ago. Go with crawlers. Work great. -FT

The Bite-Me tackle shop was completely out, and the Nestor Falls Bait Shop had a small supply, but wanted $19.75 for two dozen. Is there a bait shop in Fort Frances that anyone here can recommend? Or is this just going to be a summer-long problem? Heading back up that way in another 6 weeks or so for another trip. Thanks in advance for any info. anyone can provide."

6747247,Wallychowder,2023-06-28 14:02:00,1567,To be honest with you I'd forget the leeches and get crawlers ! Jig and a piece of crawler is all you need. Don't go spreading that around !

6747283,Old Timer,2023-06-28 17:38:00,255,"Ten days ago I bought a 1/2 pound from Rainy Sports. Not much for size, but they were healthy and caught plenty of big eyes."
