I haven't been active on this site much since the pandemic hit, partly because it ended all the travel, but mostly because life just got in the way. Something that I know everyone can relate to. I lost my dad, then the next year my mom, then last year my son and I made a life changing move north of Sault Ste Marie, on Lake Superior, and that consumed almost every ounce of my energy and and time as the house I bought needed to be completely rebuilt. We're loving it here now, it's a fantastic environment, and best of all I'm finally getting back to doing what I love. To that end I recently visited Windsor Lake on the north channel of the Attawapiskat River and had a trip for the ages. In all my years I've never had a more perfect weather week that early in the season and with zero bugs. Good numbers of large pike and all the walleye you wanted - most of them caught incidentally on oversized pike spoons. The camp is operated by Graywood Outfitters, recent new owners, and they did a great job renovating and improving the old camp. I was at Windsor many years ago and back then the camp was rough to say the least. Beyond the great weather and fishing we DID have a pretty large black bear wander into camp one night providing a little extra excitement. He poked around a bit then took off like a scalded cat after my buddy whipped a can of Coke at it. We never saw him again after that.
