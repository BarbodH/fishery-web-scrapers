6747227,winston123,2023-06-28 11:52:00,13,We have been going to Lac Seul for 20 years and love it. Our resort is Sat-Fri. We wanted to try a different lake on Friday. We will be in Ear Falls. Can someone recommend a place that rents boats by the day on a lake that has good smallmouth bass or pike fishing? We will be walleye'd out after a week on Lac Seul!
