6748519,MrSimon,2023-07-05 11:06:00,922,"Walleye in the St. Lawrence River are often really deep, around 60'. I've been able to catch them using a drop-shot rig with thin braided line and a heavy weight. It rockets to the bottom and you have good feel and sensitivity. I just use a half nightcrawler for bait. It works great. BUT, every fish I caught that deep had their eyes bulging out of their head. They all died. I won't fish deeper than 25' now. Truth be told, there are ALWAYS shallow-ish walleye no matter where and when you fish."
6747341,Jorge1074,2023-06-29 04:50:00,5,What's some good techniques for walleye fishing 35-45 feet deep for walleye?
6747355,Eckohlt,2023-06-29 05:51:00,3685,"There are no good techniques for that depth,that will send most to the grave yard!"
6747357,tv4fish,2023-06-29 05:51:00,2694,"My advice (AND I think others will agree) is that is possibly too deep to successfully bring up a walleye from that depth and have it survive if you have to release it. Can you say ""baratrauma"" ?https://thefishingwire.com/anglers-s...water-walleye/"
6747361,h8go4s,2023-06-29 06:06:00,1673,do not do it!!!!!
6747389,Steve Comerford,2023-06-29 07:42:00,28,"Jorge, something that might be important is determining the thermocline. It varies from lake to lake but 45 feet might be below the thermocline, and generally walleyes don't spend much time that deep. Are you marking walleyes at that depth? Overall I'd say that fishing below 30 feet is unnecessary and harmful to the fish (as others have stated). My recommendation is to focus on 20-30 feet of water. I'd be amazed if the lakes you fish don't have the majority of the walleye population holding in 30 feet or less."
6747395,phishfearme,2023-06-29 07:59:00,1242,"Correct - just don't do it - unless you plan to keep all you catch from that depth. also - most modern depth sounders can ""see"" the thermocline since there is a radical difference in the water density. just turn up the sensitivity all the way and you should be able to see it - 15-20ft +/- in the summer is a good estimate thought for most lakes in NW Ontario depending on clarity and wind action. indications you see on the sounder below the thermocline are more than likely whitefish or lakers. phish"
6747421,Jorge1074,2023-06-29 11:35:00,5,"Ty for the response. I was marking fish in pockets that were that deep in the lake and i just assumed that they were walleye. However, everything i've read on this makes sense, so i'll won't have to bother fishing for them that deep."
6747451,Pooch,2023-06-29 14:32:00,4618,"I've seen the same things over the years. Great looking arches, but really deep. Tried fishing them just to see what they might be. Not a bite. Assumed they were either, whitefish, Northen or Lake trout. Pooch"
6747521,Ohio fisherman,2023-06-30 01:13:00,988,Similar experience at a river mouth on the edge of Georgian Bay. Four large arches at about 35 feet. Caught four large catfish.
6747535,last chance,2023-06-30 05:56:00,3262,"we fish at depths up to 60' and the best way we have found so far is using lite bite slide divers rigged up like a dipsy. we use about a 7' 20# fluro leader off the back using the lite bite arm set as loose as it will go so even most white perch will trip our divers. we use 65# power pro for our main line but most people just use 30#. we have a dive curve for the divers with the 65# line that's pretty close. we started in 50' of water at trolling speed and with the lite bite divers with rings. then we let out line until we started bumping bottom. then figured our line in 10'. for us it took 185' to hit bottom at 2.0 to 2.2 with the diver set on 4.5. so we divide 185' by 10' which gives us 18.5. then we divide 50' by 18.5' which gives us 2.7' depth for every 10' of line out. then when we see the depth we are marking fish and let out enough line to get us right on top of the fish. you never want to troll for walleye by setting your rigs below the fish. they are more of a fish that feeds up more than down. we use worm harnesses at times. but for the last 3 years we have only been using mid size and large spoons trolled 2.8 to 3.2 and have been catching fish. you can go by the depth chart for lite bite divers and be close. then you can adjust the leads up or down until your getting fish. we also have 2 riggers that we run mostly bandits with about 25' leads. sunspot, blue chrome, and perch pattern has been out best cranks."
