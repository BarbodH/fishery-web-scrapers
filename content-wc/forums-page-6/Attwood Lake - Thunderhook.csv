Have done Auger and Hurst multiple years (I know EVERY spot on Hurst) with Mattice and then Boreal (first trip to Auger was 1985 in the old cabin that is now used for storage) and now heading for Attwood July 22. We are staying at the West camp. Hurst is very much a jigging lake, once you are on them, as is Auger - so probably the same style. Any experienced folks out there wanna point me to the spots they found?"

All of them were really good & ran top notch fly-Ins. The new Thunderhook owners are really good people & doing a great job. Attwood is a pretty good size lake with good fishing. If you head east from the west camp, be careful. There is a huge rock shelf just under the water. Itâ€™s best to go around the island to the north, then head east. You will find fish in all the normal places ( islands, points, & humps). I am going to be there in August. Hope you have a great tripBfgilly"

Trying to book Auger again for next May or early June. Sorry I can't help regarding Attwood, but I have found that Don's maps are marked up very well."
