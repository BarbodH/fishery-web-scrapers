I heard another guy saying 18 was the magic depth for him. We caught fish anywhere from 12 - 25. One of our best areas was a rock pile out in the middle. I liked around 18 feet there. We also did well fishing islands and I liked around 15 there, but we caught them in all depths."

6748013,Carnhzkr,2023-07-02 11:31:00,964,"This was year 9 or maybe 10 staying at Fisherman's Cove on the NW side of LS. I just thought I'd mention a couple of points, in case anyone might be heading that way soon. Prior to the trip, I was concerned about two things: mosquitos, and the water level. I had been hearing reports that the bugs had been horrendous up north this year, but they were a non-factor for us. They've never been bad at this camp, and this year was no exception. I never used spray, even while out in the evenings. Also, I had been seeing reports that the water levels in NW Ontario where at near record lows. That's not the case on LS. It is couple feet lower than last year, but that's because it was two feet high last year. According to Devin, the owner, they're right at average, so no issues with the water level. The first several days, the smoke was really bad. It did begin to clear up near the end of the week. Come to find out, it was probably even worse back in Iowa, so I'd have had to deal with it even if I'd stayed home. I will add that this year's fishing was probably the best we've had in this area. We do a lot of jigging, rigging, and slip bobbering, and all seemed to work equally well using either minnows or crawlers. We found fish in the typical summer spots, off rock piles, points and islands. Everywhere we tried produced fish, and the fish are extremely healthy, well-built, and strong. We caught many in the 20 - 24 inch class, with the largest at 27"" and a few more 26s. There was at least one 30"" caught while we were there, but unfortunately, not in our boat. Good luck if you're headed that way. Let me know if you have an extra seat available. I've got the time!"

6748031,LacSeul,2023-07-02 12:38:00,6,"Thanks for the report, I’ve been wondering. Headed that way soon, can’t wait!"
6748047,Carnhzkr,2023-07-02 13:20:00,964,"The correct dates for our trip were 6/24 - 6/30, but I'll bet those that really care already figured that out."
6748105,ILScott,2023-07-02 18:10:00,139,That is interesting with the water levels. I go to Wine Lake and it was down about 7-9 feet from last year and below normal. I know Wabaskang dumps into the river that leads to Wine Lake and Annishinabi dumps into a river that goes through Wine Lake that meet and go to the English river that goes to Lac Seul. In the last 5 or 6 years Wine has fluctuated a lot. Any idea why this lake system would be lower than normal. I know Wabaskang was down a little from last year but not like Wine Lake. Just curious on any thoughts.
6748111,Carnhzkr,2023-07-02 18:27:00,964,"I saw your report on Wine and someone else's fishing the English River below Ear Falls and both mentioned how low the water levels were, so I was completely expecting to see new rocks sticking up out of the water where my usual travel routes were. I was very happy to see that wasn't the case. They must not be letting much water out at the dam at Ear Falls."
6748145,pjshorthorn,2023-07-03 04:29:00,5654,Glad you had nice trip and bug free. One of these years I need to fish that side of the lake LOL PjShorthorn
6748147,pjshorthorn,2023-07-03 04:32:00,5654,This is my inclination as well.Probably managing LS based on rainfall. PjShorthorn
6748209,N_of_Quibell,2023-07-03 13:00:00,151,"You raise an interesting question. I'm thinking (and I could be wrong) it reflects differences in the water shed sizes. I think the main feeder to Wabaskang is the Cedar River (Cedar Lk->Perrault Lk->Wabaskang Lk->Cedar R-> English R) and also Aerobus Ck. I'm guessing Wine has a much smaller watershed (Annishinabi?), and hence probably lower inflow"
