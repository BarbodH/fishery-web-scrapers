I'd like to give you some of my fishing experiences as maybe I can help somebody out on their own trip. I was there the first week of June. We had some very hot weather for the first 3 days, but it eventually cooled down a bit, with only a half day of rain mixed in. My group caught a lot of fish.....every day, all day. As a spotted bass fisherman, here's what I experienced: 1.) Plastics worked as well as worms and leeches. Curly tails in white, chartreuse, pink all worked well....sizes in the 2-3 inch size worked better than larger ones. 2.) Small crank baits worked very well for both walleye and pike if the bite slowed on the curly tails. Gold, blue, green....they all worked at times. 3.) A spotted bass technique, Ned rig, worked extremely well and was a lot of fun. I used a Z man minnow z in white, pearl on a 3/16 oz jig head and got all sizes of walleye to bite. It was a lot of fun catching them that way and was probably my favorite technique over the week. It was the greatest fishing experience of my lifetime and hopefully I'll get back there."

Most of the time we just cast the crank bait out as opposed to use them for trolling. It is more exciting to cast and catch vs troll and catch. We also anchored up in 6-8ft of water and just cast different lures for a couple of hours in different directions at a time when productive. If not, we'd move a 100 yards and just repeat."
