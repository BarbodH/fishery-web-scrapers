6747113,7 Mag,2023-06-27 18:27:00,1887,"Yes and it hasn't improved any today, they extended the air quality alert another 24 hours so at least another day of coughing."
6747179,prov1800,2023-06-28 05:47:00,5010,Been smoky in nwo for few days now.Need a wind change to get rid of it.
6746929,prov1800,2023-06-27 05:41:00,5010,Was on Cedar yesterday and looks like there was a major mayfly hatch going.We fished for bass but had mayfly popping up all over and with the bass surfacing it looked like it was raining.Still managed to put a lot of bass in the boat but defiantly numbers down compared to last few days.Today we head to Clay Lake for bass so will see what's happening there.Weather is still good but lots of smoke in the air as we have north winds bringing the smoke from up north.Still dry even though we had some rain couple days ago.Talked to some guys walleye fishing at camp and sounded like they were having some problems getting walleyes
6747001,7 Mag,2023-06-27 10:16:00,1887,"The north wind has brought the smoke all the way here to northern Indiana, horrible trying to breathe that stuff!!"
6747017,Wallychowder,2023-06-27 11:10:00,1567,Yeah ! Canada needs to get that $#/] under control or there wont be a Canada !
6747019,pjshorthorn,2023-06-27 11:19:00,5654,What is the Chowder plan to do so .being you probably have one. PjShorthorn
6747031,Yellowfin123,2023-06-27 11:40:00,2182,"being probably 350 miles west of you there has been a nice cool dry breeze coming from the north, so far no smoke at least for now..."
6747035,7 Mag,2023-06-27 12:14:00,1887,"Hope you don't get it! We've had an air quality alert for a few days, but today is the worst so far."
6747039,7 Mag,2023-06-27 12:21:00,1887,"I think they're trying as best as they can. Good thing the fish don't have to breathe the smoke, it might stunt their growth!!"
6747045,Wallychowder,2023-06-27 13:04:00,1567,"I realize they legalized marijuana , but man ! Take it easy !!!!!!!"
