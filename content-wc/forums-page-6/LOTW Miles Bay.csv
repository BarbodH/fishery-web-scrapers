6748181,port1042,2023-07-03 09:27:00,509,"My trip was my first to LOTW but my 17th trip to Canada. We always did fish fries but we always pan fried our fish. I had never used a propane deep fryer. That made all the difference. I got home on Friday night and ordered a propane ""fish cooker"" on Saturday morning. It was delivered yesterday and the kids and grand kids are coming for a ""Fourth of July Fish Fry"" tomorrow!"
6739937,port1042,2023-05-21 06:23:00,509,"I'll be fishing out of Miles Bay Camp in late June. My first trip in that area. Any suggestions or ""secrets"" to help learn the area will be appreciated! I'll be looking for walleye and bass but I love to get into a nice northern when the opportunity presents itself. Any perch or crappies in the area?"
6739983,Old Timer,2023-05-21 11:28:00,255,I think that's what some call Rex Tolton's camp. It's tucked into the NW corner of Miles Bay. Matt will show you where to catch fish close to the camp. You shouldn't have wind problems because of all the nearby islands. It's quite secluded. If this is your first trip you may venture no further east than horseshoe island and the nearby stream flowing into Miles Bay. Good fishing all around there. To the west you may not venture further than stairway point. There is current flowing past there and that means good fishing. Also check out the island points where Miles Bay chokes down to the narrower water going west. You'll find humps on your way to stairway that always hold walleyes in the summer. I mostly use a jig and minnow up there. Good luck on your trip and post a report.
6739985,Old Timer,2023-05-21 11:51:00,255,"By the way, Port, I'd recommend you order a Canadian navigational map for the Miles Bay area. I wouldn't simply rely on your electronic chart or a hotspot map you buy at the bait store. I've fished LOTW for many years and still carry a nav map in the boat. LOTW can be very confusing, especially on your first trip."
6740021,Obabikon,2023-05-21 13:16:00,2370,"Matt is a fantastic dude. I hope you have an amazing trip. That time of year, there are a bunch of humps on the North West side of Miles that are good. Lots of spots around horseshoe island and down from Thompson's Creek. You won't have to go far for either walleye or bass. Bolder shorelines are great that time of year for smallies. Good luck!"
6740239,port1042,2023-05-22 16:37:00,509,I appreciate your help. I will post a report.
6740291,Riding high,2023-05-22 20:43:00,69,I have stayed in milesbay with Matt for several years now. Smallmouth is real good in that area. Crappie fishing in that area is good in May and in the fall. Not sure where they go but end of June they're hard to find. Alot of pearch in that area also. I have walleye fished and musky fished starting from Rabbit island all over Milesbay and little traverse. I like to explore. We've caught walleyes all over. That time of year jig and worm will slay walleye and Smallmouth in the same area. Good luck and have a wonderful trip. Pink is a very good color in lake of the woods. Oh so is gold. I also like purple.
6740363,Obabikon,2023-05-23 07:12:00,2370,Crappie typically go to shallow brush piles that time of year.
6747827,port1042,2023-07-01 07:20:00,509,"I got home last night from my week at Miles Bay Camp. It was a great trip. We arrived on Saturday to pretty wild water. 5 guys with 2 boats. Matt met us at the marina and led us out to the camp, three of us (plus a guy from another cabin) in the camp boat and three boats followed through some pretty wild water for just short of an hour to camp. That was about twice the normal travel time but we made it safe and sound. I'm sure without Matt's help we would not have tried it on our own. (The trip back yesterday morning was a piece of cake.) We caught a lot of fish although the size was a little disappointing. This seemed to be the case throughout the camp. Lots of ""eater walleyes"" but only a few walleyes over 20"". The perch bite was good and those were really nice perch. We were not fishing for bass but of course we found some good smallies and rock bass. We did not fish for musky or pike but one of the guys got a 32 inch pike on a jig. Most walleyes were found at 15 to 20 feet. Night crawlers seemed to work as well as leeches or minnows on a 1/8th ounce jig. Guys in other cabins reported that crawler harnesses worked well too. The camp had great facilities and the guys I was fishing with are regulars there. They sure know how to cook! We had some great fish fries. Miles Bay Camp is a good option if your looking."
6748035,Bill Krejca,2023-07-02 12:43:00,6107,Nice report. Lots of good places to try in the area. Sometimes the path to and fro can be a little exciting. Bill
6748045,Yellowfin123,2023-07-02 13:18:00,2182,"thanks for the report on the woods... reading it reminded me of a time we were invited to a dinner on eagle lake from the big crew next door, WOW they put on a show!!! one of the best fish fry/ bbq dinners of my life!! some of these crews can really cook and do it up big... myself and my crew you could say the cooking is lacking.."
