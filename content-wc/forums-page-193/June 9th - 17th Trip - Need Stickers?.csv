We are staying across the border in FF that night and driving thru Dryden / Vermillion Bay in the morning on our way to Ear Falls for the week. If you are traveling this area during the same time frame and want to meet to get a Walleye Central Sticker, send me a PM and I will give you my cell. The Stickers are $4.00 (US ) If you aren't sure what I am talking about, I have designed and I am selling Walleye Central stickers for your boat/car/whatever. There is a thread in the General Discussion on it as well."
