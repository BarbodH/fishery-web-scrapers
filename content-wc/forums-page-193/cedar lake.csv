5571257,Rich B,2017-05-26 06:57:00,1081,"Prov1800, Thanks for your fishing report of Opening Day and this week on Cedar. My brother and a few other friends are finishing up the week today at Cedar Point Resort (Ray & Kathi), and they experienced the same fishing as you mentioned....and found a few mid to upper 30"" Musky biting the walleye presentations, which made for a fun time for a Florida friend that had never caught Musky before. Plenty of mixed bag action, though no trophies. Other friends and I will be up at CPR the 2nd week of July, so looking forward to getting up to your neighborhood and having a fun week on Cedar. Rich B"

5578505,Riverkeg,2017-05-30 09:57:00,134,"It definitely tough fishing on Sunday and Monday. Things improved steadily throughout the week and we were catching them at all depths but only 2 to 5 from each spot and then we had to move on. We found ourselves again spending most of our time on the east side. We just can't seem to figure out the west side during the opener. Maybe the fish just aren't there that time of year. We too found crappie more in the staging phase than stacked up like last year. We did also make our way up through Perrault to the river and had some good luck there also. ProV1800 - I was hopeful you'd catch us on the lake so we could say hello and pick your brain. FYI - for those looking for a camp, I'm still impressed with Clark's. They seem to be constantly making improvements and they are awesome hosts. This year they improved the electrical access on the docks, as well as replacing a couple of docks."
