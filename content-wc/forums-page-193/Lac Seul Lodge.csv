5573993,Pooch,2017-05-27 21:03:00,4618,"Not only is Steve E. going to be fishing out of LSL before wife and I get there, but now PV is going to be there, too. There will be no fish left in the area by the time they both head home.Appears I should bring more hotdogs with me.Pooch"
5582321,Steve Ediger,2017-05-31 21:14:00,97,"Pooch, Don't worry. I will make sure to throw a few back. Maybe I will have a few located by the time you get there. Steve"
5582353,Smithwick,2017-05-31 21:36:00,63,Will be close by at Scout Lake Resort the 17 - 24th. Fishing out of a red Reata and our group also has an Alumacraft Trophy and a Ranger Angler. Counting down the days and can't wait! It's always interesting the first day to find where the fish are at this year.
5582545,Pooch,2017-06-01 05:05:00,4618,"I'll trade you beer for your thoughts on location! I still struggle on this trip to this part of the lake every year. This part of LS fishes so very different that the other end of the lake (NE) in the later summer.The only consistent year to year places I've found are the sand banks in McKenzie and Manitoba Point area. Found a few wind swept pockets that held a lot of fish, but few and far between. I think I learn more about fishing on this part of the lake because one has to really hunt fish or know the lake well.One morning fishing a pocket with scattered weeds in particular was interesting in that when the wind was blowing hard I caught all over slot then when the wind slowed down only eaters. Wind kicked back up and larger fish once more. I was by myself that morning and within a few hours lost count at fifty or sixty walleye. Leech & hook only. A very pleasant morning without having to travel many rough miles to find fish.Have a safe and great trip.Pooch"
5583313,muskyroller,2017-06-01 09:19:00,56,"ProV is going to guide our group on the 18th. We've been at it on this side of LS for the last 12 years, but figure it's time to learn something new AND some new spots. We've kind of fallen into a rut of jig/minnow in the same spots the last four or five years...I think this has really slowed our productivity and numbers of quality walleyes way down."
5583329,muskyroller,2017-06-01 09:30:00,56,"Were you guys there last year at that time?? I remember a Ranger coming through the channel, into Scout Lake and I thought...""sweet ride!"" We were in Lunds and Onaway camp boats with 60s on em."
5586161,Smithwick,2017-06-02 13:02:00,63,"Nope, first time at Scout Lake and looking forward to it. Have stayed up at Goose Bay years past and determined we liked fishing McKenzie Bay and that area of the lake and figured this was a shorter ride than coming down through Steamboat and Shanty narrows. On the road two weeks from today! Can't wait."
5570905,Pooch,2017-05-26 03:44:00,4618,Anyone going to be there this year the week of June 17-24?Pooch
5571169,Guest,2017-05-26 06:13:00,0,"Pooch, We will be up there the same week, but on the other side of the lake. Staying at Lac Seul Outpost Camp. We'll have to compare notes after the trip. I think we are about 100 miles between camps. It will be interesting to see how the fishing compares between East and West sides of the lake."
5571457,Pooch,2017-05-26 07:56:00,4618,"We also fish out of Mahkwa on the SE end of the lake usually in late August to Labor Day time period. You wouldn't realize you were fishing the same lake as they fish so different because of the time of year and location. More ""apparent"" or ""defined"" structure on the Sioux Lookout end of the lake IMO.Have a great trip (they all are..)Pooch"
5571809,muskyroller,2017-05-26 10:33:00,56,"Pooch, we'll be in the bay over at Onaway the same week. Fishing out of camp boats mostly,, but will have two Lund Fishermans with 150s on em."
5571929,Steve Ediger,2017-05-26 11:13:00,97,"Pooch, We will be at LSL June 10 - 14. Steve"

5572665,Shotgun,2017-05-26 18:41:00,759,"Pooch, we'll be there a little earlier than you. Will be there June 3rd to the 10th."
