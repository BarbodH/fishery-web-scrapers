Coming back into the US has been a little different with more interesting questions about relationships of the people in the vehicle (s), employment and who you work for, etc. Last year my son was riding with Breezy in the lead vehicle and the US agent asked about their relationship and how they knew one another . Answer, my Dad and Breezy are friends and my Dad is in the car behind us. The agent then asked the son if his luggage was in Breezy's vehicle. Answer : My duffel bag is in the car with my Dad. I pull up driving my Dad's car and they ask a few normal questions. Then it starts with, how do you two know each other. Answer: This is my father ( I guess the same last name on our passports didn't give away the fact that we may be related ). Are you traveling with anyone else ? Answer: My friend and son are in the car that you just spoke too. Is anyone else's luggage in your vehicle. Answer: Ummm, yes, my son has his duffle bag in our vehicle. Why didn't he put it in the vehicle he is riding in ? Answer: We are heading home together and it was just easier to put his gear in this car then having to transfer it later when we get to my friend's house. I didn't know that was a requirement. It is a requirement ? I got no answer on that question. Sir, please pop your trunk so I can take a look. Answer: You bet. The agent spent about 10 minutes digging through the son's nasty clothes of week long fishing stench while we sat in the lane at the booth. Nothing came out of the inspection other than a few odd questions I had never been asked before. I told Gramp's to never wear his Packers sweatshirt again when we were crossing in Baudette. That had to be the trigger for this agent as he made a comment about it when asking my Dad questions. PjShorthorn"
5583497,Multispecies Guy,2017-06-01 10:33:00,447,Spending tomorrow night in Baudette and crossing Sat morning. First time crossing at Baudette. Is it as busy as Int'l Falls? Best time after 7 AM on Sat morning to cross? Launching at Pier North near Mormon. How busy is that launch on Saturday? Thanks
5583513,MN_Moose,2017-06-01 10:43:00,964,"Baudette is rarely busy. On a Sat afternoon there might be 2 or 3 rigs waiting turn. I will caution, don't blast past the Canadian border crossing station. Without any vehicles around it looks pretty non descript. They'll blow the air horn at you and make you turn around. Or so I've heard......"
5583817,The tank,2017-06-01 12:50:00,340,We croossed at 6-6:30am on may20th and no one but us. They're being weird at the crossing at baudette this year going both ways. Canadians ask us why we came that way then pulled us over for 20 minutes never said any thing walked out gave us our passport and have a nice trip?? Last 3 years I've crossed there twice a year not sure what the deal was. On the way back to the US they opened trunks and back of picks; SUVS of all vehicles. no big deal just something different. You'll be fine just don't stop till you get over the bridge. It looks like there's something on the US side but never seen anyone around there.
5583825,The tank,2017-06-01 12:53:00,340,Pier north you should be good. Never had to wait much their. Just drive in go to the office and the nice lady will tell you where she would like you to park. You pay her when you leave. Have a great trip.
5584545,Obabikon,2017-06-01 19:04:00,2370,"Maybe a couple other boats will be there... you will not be swamped at all. If I was to guess on the border I would guess fewer than 4 cars in front of you when you cross the bridge. Even on a Saturday, it is pretty slow up there."
5584625,patrick,2017-06-01 19:52:00,277,You won't have any problem at all it'll be there 510 dimes year and never have to wait
5584993,Multispecies Guy,2017-06-02 03:49:00,447,Thanks to all
5586329,stumcfar,2017-06-02 15:02:00,451,Baudette is usually very quick.. we had the same thing happen a few years ago as mentioned above. They kept our passports made us park and we sat a half hour without anyone saying a word to us. They came out gave us our passprts back and sent us on our way. Found out later that they occasionally do background checks and need to call in to do it and that was the delay.
5586961,Multispecies Guy,2017-06-03 05:02:00,447,Thanks all.
5587073,Bill Krejca,2017-06-03 06:38:00,6107,"Normally, crossing at Baudette is fast and relatively painless, assuming all is in order. Last fall, we did have an extremely thorough search, involving 5 officials - I don't know where they all came from. They pretty much took out/opened up everything in the truck and boat, except the clothes which we had on. The operation took perhaps 15 minutes. They were professional and generally didn't make a huge mess for us to repack, too much. This was an exception to the normal amount of time we have had to wait there in the past; as stated above, there usually are only several or no cars ahead when we arrive (around 8-9 AM). Bill"
