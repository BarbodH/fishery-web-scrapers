1085481,Bigfishhunter,2009-03-04 17:19:00,803,The Can Am PWT event held on Wabigoon was a big success. Most of the successful fisherman were pitching bladed jigs in the heavy cabbage. Just a side note totally off topic - Canadian Team beat the American Team.

You can catch Walleye, Small Mouth Bass, Northern Pike and Muskie. You have to watch out for the hazards, most are marked but you have to keep your eye out. Talk to Len and Nancy at Bonny Bay and they will take great care of you. Great hospitality and a lot of memories made."
1073769,Guest,2009-01-14 16:35:00,0,I have stayed at bonny bay several times had a great time caught nice fish. I took a 11 lb wally home with me went on my wall.
1077374,gary2242,2009-01-30 14:44:00,49,"Bonny Bay Camp is an awesome place to go to. The fishing is fantastic. Just look at their web site. They have tons of big new photos. www.bonnybay.comAlso, may I remind everyone that of all the lakes in Ontario, In-Fisherman chose Wabigoon for the In-Fisherman Walleye Trail Tournament. They chose Wabigoon because it's good marketing for their fishing pros and their magazine. They want pictures and video of their pros dragging monster Walleye out of the lake to sell more magazines and they chose Wabigoon as the most probable place to have that happen.Gary"
1077718,mdoehling,2009-01-31 21:18:00,81,"Yeah, because Lac Suel doesn't have hog walleyes and neither does LOTW.? I think it may have more to do with the proximety of the town of Dryden and the services available for more poeple to stay there as opposed to more remote locations. JMHO."
1077799,Skywagon,2009-02-01 10:40:00,1106,"You have to wonder what these responder's connection to the resort is? Are bookings slow this year? I can walk out my back door and step onto the lake, and until this thread started, did not know how great the fishing really was. I can stop being frustrated. Will probably not have to go to Lac Seul any more.Yes, I would guess location and motel rooms available had a lot to do with the tournament's selection of location. Lac Seul just doesn't have many available motel rooms on either side of the lake."
1078354,fisherman 1,2009-02-03 18:57:00,39,"Wabigoon, LOTW and Lac Seul are all great fisheries. I have fished on all of them and still can go to any of them and catch my limit of eyes in no time flat! I feel that the reason the PWT didn't go to Lac Seul wasn't because of lack of lodging availbility or services, Sioux Lookout could easily house 50 to 60 pro's and co anglers if necessary. I think that the problem there is the catch & keep as livewells are not allowed, catching and killing trophy fish in a tournament like this wouldn't be accepted by the MNR. No doubt that there are also great fish on Lac Seul. As for LOTW there is also sufficent lodging there as Kenora has more lodging opertunitys than Dryden ever will, not to mention Nestor falls, Sioux Narrows, Clearwater Bay and the US side of the lake, maybee it was the luck of the draw for Dryden. Like I said I still love all of these fisheries and I have no doubt that I will enjoy catching my walleyes on them for years to come!"
1078475,Skywagon,2009-02-04 08:04:00,1106,"Sioux Lookout sponsored a walleye tournament last year (2008). Yes, it is sad to kill all of those fish, but it is legal and MNR has no say over that. Remember, it is all about tourist dollars. A local friend told me (that worked the Wabigoon tournament the last two years) that after weigh-in a lot of the fish did not make it. They saved the floaters, which were given to charity, but who knows about the stressed fish that were released."
1078541,Guest,2009-02-04 12:35:00,0,"What impressed me was the fact that it took a 3lb average to win. only 2 fish per day over 18"" and it was the middle of August. I heard there were camps across NW Ont. that were closing up and going home for the month of august last year, because the fishing was no good and their camps were empty."
1084274,Robert Cardenas,2009-02-27 13:20:00,138,What's nice about this lake is that there is many other lakes attached to it that are crystal clear and easily entered by boat without portaging. You won't go wrong with this lake and I have priced all the other resorts out on Wabigoon and you won't beat Bonny Bay and there class act.Robert from the Twin Cities
1084500,walleyeslayer1,2009-02-28 15:12:00,19,"go by it every year on way to minnitaki(Donnellys)....heard its slowly gettin worse, as far as fishing goes. Try a camp on minnitaki, the fishings excellent! Minnitaki is only approx an hourish north of wabigoon on 72."
1084545,fisherman 1,2009-02-28 18:33:00,39,"I have fished Minnitaki in the past. I do much better on the goon. I can limit out every day, I usualy keep enough for supper and release the rest. The walleye fishery is as good now as ever and the pike fishery is phenomonal! To each his own I suppose. All I can say is fish shallower than you would on a clear lake and you will have no problem filling your boat! Because of the water clarity or lac of, it is not normaly necessary to fish deep or low light conditions in order to catch fish. If there is a cold front you may have to go to 18, to 25' otherwise fish 4' to 12' in the summer and 2' to 8' in the spring. Good fishin!"
1068107,Guest,2008-12-11 19:16:00,0,"hi thinking of going to bonny bay camp.any info on this camp. also how is wabigoon lake. is it big like eagle lake, tons of people on it. would be going end of june early july. hows the fishing. is it a hard lake to read... any info would be great thanks for your time wayne"
1068150,Skywagon,2008-12-12 07:14:00,1106,"I have been past Bonnie Bay while on snowmobile in the winter, but do not know anything about the camp. The Wabigoon lake system is slightly smaller than Eagle. The water depth in Wabigoon is rather shallow (max of 35 ft or so) and murcky because of the clay soils in the area. There used to be several fishing from the camps, but that slowed down a lot this last summer. In my opinion it has been over-fished and there needs to be stricter limits, like some of the other lakes. I have been told that years ago the fishing was great. I have hopes some day the MNR will wake up to this and make some changes.I live on the lake system for the conveniance of the location, not for the fishing. When friends come up from the States, I always take them to Lac Seul, where it will be a lot more likely to get into more and bigger fish."
1068169,Jimmy Jig,2008-12-12 08:45:00,1905,I go by it every year on the way to Minnitaki and L.S. Don't like the rocks and dirty water....
1068200,2746,2008-12-12 12:21:00,3206,"I fished Wabigoon as a teenager 50+ years ago and it was good fishing. Went back 10 years ago, for old time's sake, and fishing had deteriorated badly. LOTW, Eagle, LacSeul, Gullrock and Red Lake are all better choices."
1068219,Babamel2,2008-12-12 14:47:00,414,I have been fishing the Wabigoon Dinorwic lakes for the past 20 yrs and have noticed a decline in size and numbers.
1068309,Guest,2008-12-13 01:14:00,0,"The Goon still has excellent potential for trophy Musky,Northern & Walleye but I would agree that overall numbers are down. Too much catch & keep ?"
1068416,Chris K,2008-12-13 18:50:00,278,"I stayed at Bonny Bay this past summer. I have been to several other camps and lakes in Northwest Ontario that are popular camp destinations. I really liked the diversity Wabigoon and the surrounding lakes had to offer, and each day we caught quality fish. Len and Nancy whom own Bonny Bay provide incredible customer service and they really know what it takes to make you feel welcome and enjoy your stay to the fullest. They treat you like family and appreciate your business, and the hospitality shows from everyone. I will be back, I hope sooner rather than later and from everyone I had spoken to in looking for a place to stay at Wabigoon, the best referals and pre trip information came from Bonny Bay. Chris Kindraka"
1069865,Adam Schlaeger,2008-12-23 10:18:00,4,"Chris, I agree with you on all aspect of Bonny Bay and Lake Wabigoon. To start Bonny Bay camp's location on the lake makes it ideal to get to all the great fishing spots within a short boat ride, as a matter of fact trophy Walleye and Muskie are in the same bay. The camp itself is a beautiful setup with very well maintained cabins, camper hookups, rod storage. They have a great cleaning house and the dock system they have makes it easy to maintain your boat, there is electricity as well as a fuel station right there. Once the boat is in the water it doesn't have to come out until you leave. The main lodge offers a great place to get together and talk with other campers as well as Len and Nancy about the day on the water. There is a camp dinner that is provided by Nancy and her staff that is second to none. Len and Nancy and the crew are the best in the business. Their reputation speaks for itself. From the first day I walked into the camp I was made to feel like we have known each other for 50 years. I have been going to Bonny Bay coming up on seven years and there is no other place on the lake I would go. I have priced out the other camps in the area and by far they have the best packages and prices. No nickel and diming like other camps on the lake. As far as the lake, it is thriving, every day we are there we limit out and we catch trophy sized fish. I haven't seen a drop off in the fishing at all. There is not a lot of fishing pressure especially on the eastern end. If you want hot fishing action, a respected camp and the peace of mind that Len and Nancy give, I highly recommend Bonny Bay and Wabigoon, you won't regret it.Adam"
1069927,Robert Cardenas,2008-12-23 18:09:00,138,"Adam,You have explained this camp to a ""T""! I have been going up to Bonny Bay Camp ever since Len and Nancy took ownership. This resort is a class act! Fishing is spectacular. There is a reason the PWT (Pro Walleye Tour) chose to host one of their big tournaments the last 2 years here, the walleye fishing is the best you will find. I have fished a lot of lakes in Canada and stayed at many resorts, and have finally found a lake and resort I will be coming back to every year! The best part about fishing Lake Wabigoon and the Dinorwic lakes which are connected and accessible by boat is that you will catch not only walleye but musky, northern, smallmouth bass, white fish, and the biggest jumbo perch you will come across. I fish Mille Lacs, LOTW and Red a lot and have not come close to the size and numbers of the perch on Lake Wabigoon. The last 2 years our group has caught a 31"" walleye, and last year pulled in a 42"" northern pike and saw much bigger musky and pike caught. We caught many walleye's in the 20""+ range. You will catch so many walleye's that you will want to fish northern and musky's in the afternoon. I have had such a great experience staying at Bonny Bay Camp that my group of fishing buddies has grown to 12+ people every year that come up with me. They are #1 in Hospitality. Nancy has a camp dinner for the entire resort one evening and she and Len have a spread of food that could feed an army, you also get to talk to everyone in the resort. The cabins are very clean and if you forget something from home it probably is already in the cabin, if not I know Len and Nancy would find a way to get it to you. The dock area is very protected and safe for your boat from the wind, and not to mention a hot spot for walleye and northern. Yes you can catch walleye's all day long off the dock! Our group rents the 50HP/4Stroke flat bottom fishing boats instead of hauling up our boats from the twin cities, you can't beat their price and with the 4 gallons of gas a day per boat that you get, you won't have to buy gas the whole week. If the weather is bad you always have the lodge to watch movies on the big screen, play pool, cards etc. They also make camp fires at night for the resort by the lodge and typically everyone congregates there to talk about the days fishing stories. Len and Nancy make you feel like your part of their family for the week. You will not regret booking a trip to Bonny Bay Camp.Robert CSt. Paul/Minneapolis"
1069939,Guest,2008-12-23 19:18:00,0,"We had a great experience at Bonny Bay a few years ago...not a great fishing experience, but a Len and Nancy made our stay there a great experience. The accommodations, lodge, boat/motors and cabins are all well maintained. The Thursday night meal was awesome and both Len and Nancy made you feel at home in their home. Having easy access to Dryden for food, beverage and extra-curricular entertainment was a plus. The negative is that lack of ""getting away"", the STAIN of the water and the overall quality of the fishery in comparison to the Lac or Gull Rock. The fishing was okay, once we figured out that shallower is better...due to water clarity. We could limit out on 15"" eyes, pick up northerns when desired and found decent spots for smallies...boated one 21 incher. Biggest plus is again the host. Craig"
