You are a very good writer and enjoy your articles especially regarding Pike fishing adventures in Nipigon. Thanks again and keep up the good work."
5587905,Moosebunk,2017-06-03 20:06:00,211,"Thanks Brian. Always appreciate hearing from readers and getting some feedback. Gar are in Ontario and have been around for long before any human beings. They are in every Great Lake and St. Lawrence and Ottawa Rivers and therefor many, many other tributary lakes and rivers too. Probably the best area to fish them is on the Ottawa River and, the past four record gar have all been caught there. I was out fishing them just today. 48+ inch fish are common place and on the right weather days catching one is almost a given. Record gar are 20+ pounds, 50+ inchers IMO are true trophies. You will often see dozens if not hundreds in an outing. Again, weather and season dependent and, hooking gar and keeping them on the line is difficult challenge for even some great seasoned anglers. Carp on the other hand, they're in Manitoba and all over Ontario as well. Again, the Ottawa River and St.Lawrence nearby could be considered two of the best waters for big carp. BIG fish are 30+ pounds but a 40 would be considered a rare but record-like catch. Lots of cool ""other"" species to fish for in Ontario. Many around the Great Lakes."
