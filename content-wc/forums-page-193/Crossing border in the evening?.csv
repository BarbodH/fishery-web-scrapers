The past, we have always crossed early on Saturday morning but this year we decided to cross about 6PM and driving thru to Dryden. What is the crossing usually like at that time?Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk Pro"
5584913,LoDo,2017-06-01 21:50:00,721,"We are doing the same. We used to stay in Int Falls, but the last few years we've decided to stay in Dryden or Red Lake depending on our flight into MSP. This year we'll be driving through Int Fall closer to 6p and making it to Dryden. Crossing is no different. be sure all booze/smokes has a receipt to follow in the same vehicle. We only have the driver speak to border patrol. Passports ready and open to photo/demographics page to show, etc... easy!"
5584937,flntknp17,2017-06-01 22:23:00,151,I cross every trip in the late afternoon on Friday and then get to Dryden about 6-7 pm. Works very well for us. Extremely short lines typically. Often less than 10 minutes wait. I think you'll like it. Matt

5585177,a3dad,2017-06-02 05:58:00,115,I always find this site useful for this purpose.http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/bwt-taf/menu-eng.html
5585361,Wedge,2017-06-02 06:52:00,270,"Cool site, but kinda hard to use for planning a long road trip since they don't give forecasted times anymore. Once you get to your crossing after a 9 hour drive, this info is kinda moot. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk Pro"
