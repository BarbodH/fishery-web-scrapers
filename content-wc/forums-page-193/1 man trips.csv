Now i do enjoy fly fishing for brook trout but when i go to canada i want to walleye fish. I enjoy an advernture as well. Would prefer to stay away from the perrault/cedar area or indian chain area. I know these are popular and have fished them all. i dont mind a drive further north. Also a drive in camp. Its hard finding a place that takes 1 person for the week. Thanks."

5581769,gullrockguy,2017-05-31 16:24:00,44,"i posted about fishing walleye in manitoba a few years ago and a number of people came back and said :if you fish gullrock, why would you go anywhere else to catch walleye?. so i'm saying the same thing to you. I know a change is as good as a rest but if you are limiting your spending to 1000 bucks, there must be places around the area that would take your money,. but if you want good walleye fishing, lac seul is among the top . if you are looking for adventure, why not book on gullrock for your walleye and some of the resorts have boat caches on smaller lakes that you can have access to. I know 5 lakes lodge has 3 or 4 of the outlaying boat caches. don't know about the others. if you are limiting yourself to 1000 bucks why not look at american plan resorts for a shorter time period. i know stormer lake lodge has amazing walleye fishing and they are american plan (great food) and they may be able to accommodate you."
5581873,Golden Eagle,2017-05-31 17:23:00,2642,"I've made about 20 solo trips, just me and my dog on fly in fishing. Never thought much about it, just did it. My party of 6 spent a week at Cobham River Outpost. Pete Kay picked us up at the end of the week. Asked if he would drop me off at a camp on the ride back to Red Lake. Okay with Pete, but he told me the camp was shut down until moose season. He dropped me off, told the owner I was there alone and I had one of my guys call my wife to tell her I was extending my trip a week or so.I've also arrived at Red Lake without plans and hitchhiked a flight to a lake-on two occasions. Stuff works. Haven't run across any skeletons in my travels.On one trip I never saw the camp owner, but looked up his wife in town. Made out a check to the owner, gave it to his wife, but did not include the amount. Mrs. Camp Owner couldn't believe what had happened.Life works."
