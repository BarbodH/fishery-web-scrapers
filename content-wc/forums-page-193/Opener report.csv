Big smallies and several over 30 inch pike welcomed us along with a fantastic camp staff. Nick has made nice improvements and while Herb and Ann will always be legends, Nick has assumed the role of Caretaker of Paradise well. We had no issues and began the hunt for walleye on opening day. We certainly caught plenty of walleye and ate plenty for the week. While we sat on a few productive holes, we never felt like we hit a honey hole. Several times we spent a few hours on a spot and caught 30 or so, we are not used to 10 fish an hour being the best we could do. Between the four of us, we caught well over 500 fish for the week. I managed to catch my pb walleye at a solid 28."" Fortunately for us, a system like this one always provides good options. While the walleye were not highly productive, the lake trout were shallow and hungry. We all managed to catch several trout but I have assumed the role of ""Master Angler"" of our group by pulling up a fish of a lifetime at 40"" I hope I can figure out how to post the picture. If not, I put it on the Wine Lake Camp facebook page. While we never targeted big pike, we caught quite a few over 3.0' with the largest being a 42"" bigboy pulled up by Sleepy. Smallies have taken over Turnaround Lake and while we hooked a few walleyes there, smallies were everywhere. Biggest smalllie by our group was 18"" but there we many over 17 with the smaller ones still at blast at 16"" A long but uneventful trip home (thankfully) with plans already made for another trip next year.https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...1&d=1496068590"

Good to hear that you didn't draw the attention of the MNR this year . I hope Doc was able to make the trip after all. Hopefully we can catch up at ND in October to compare trips and have a few beverages together. PjShorthorn"
