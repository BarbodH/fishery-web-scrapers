John who is the camp attendant will be able to point out some hotspots for you. The sandbar just out from camp always provided good action for us at dusk. Have fun!"

We wore ourselves out on the pike and walleyes, over 800 in a week. Walleyes ran on the small side but we did get over 10 pike in the 40-47."" Good luck and look forward to seeing how you do.
