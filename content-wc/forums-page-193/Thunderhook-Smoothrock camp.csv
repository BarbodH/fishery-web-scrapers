The average size walleye has been going up steadily as all walleye over 18 inches are released. Some days it was difficult to catch fish small enough to keep for shore lunch. What a problem to have ! With the late ice out trout were shallow with several in the 20 lb class being caught. Drake and Debbie and crew took great care of us even though camp was just opening up. Smoothrock is a beautiful lake of 24,000 acres with 4 major flowages coming in and plenty of places to fish even on windy days. You know it's a great place to go when you meet the same people from all over the country and even the world at camp year after year. I can't wait to go again !"

A few years ago while sitting at the shared dock waiting for Don Elliott to load us up i met four gentleman from Ohio who were doing the same and ready to head to Smoothrock, this was their annual pilgrimage and for 30 years! A few years ago while at the All Canada show i had the opportunity to meet Debbie, was very impressed as she was friendly and helpful. Man so many places and so little time."

The boats also have swivel bucket seats. We averaged 10hrs per day on the water so a comfortable boat is a must. Feel free to p.m.. if you want any info
