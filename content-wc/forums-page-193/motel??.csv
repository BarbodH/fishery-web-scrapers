5571409,stumcfar,2017-05-26 07:44:00,451,Thanks for all the help guys. A Walleye Central reader got us hooked up with a camp in Perrault Falls that had a cabin available and were more than happy to accommodate us for a night. This is a very helpful site!!

5566482,stumcfar,2017-05-24 09:20:00,451,"We come from the other direction, so Dryden would be out of the way. Not sure if any camps in the Perrault Falls area would have a cabin available to let a group crash for a night? Any ideas would be appreciated. Thanks guys."
5566746,pjshorthorn,2017-05-24 11:09:00,5654,Give V-Bay Gord a call and see if he has anything available for a night. Vermilionbaylodge.com PjShorthorn

5567538,Lazy Fisherman,2017-05-24 15:49:00,276,"Maybe if you said what routes you are taking and how far away from Ear Falls you are willing to stay, someone might have more choices."
5567562,stumcfar,2017-05-24 15:55:00,451,"We are coming up through Sioux Narrows. We can look at staying there, but were hoping to get a little closer."
5567626,Lazy Fisherman,2017-05-24 16:16:00,276,The Sioux Narrows Motel was recently remodeled. I stayed there last year. You can walk to the Dock house or Big John's for food.
5567986,Larry S,2017-05-24 18:54:00,665,You could detour 7 miles west and go to Kenora where there are lots of motels

5564066,stumcfar,2017-05-23 13:28:00,451,Are there any places to spend an overnight between Vermillion Bay and Ear Falls? We are trying to find a place to stay on a Friday night as we can't get into our camp until Saturday. Vermillion Bay is booked.
5564130,walleye22,2017-05-23 13:38:00,59,i believe there is Timberlane lodge in ear falls. 866-539-8117. Other than that might have to drive into red lake...about an hour north and they have hotels.
5564146,mjayn,2017-05-23 13:44:00,1188,The Friday night before getting to the Saturday to Saturday lodge was always a sleep in the truck night. I might be too old for that now.
5564170,stumcfar,2017-05-23 13:47:00,451,"We have done that before, just checking for something a little more comfortable!"
5564242,walleye22,2017-05-23 14:12:00,59,yeah...not sleeping in my truck on vacation. Now a blow up bed in the back with a topper...all for it. i will take a hotel and hot shower on vacation though.
5564786,NARDA 1,2017-05-23 17:27:00,636,Did you contact the Northside Motel in Vermillion Bay? 807-227-5339
5564970,team walleye,2017-05-23 18:20:00,336,What about just staying in Dryden for the night and making the drive from Dryden to Ear Falls in the morning?
5565434,btyreprich,2017-05-23 20:19:00,1067,We travel on Hoghway 71 on our trip up to Ear Falls. I remember seeing several motels along that highway - try once of these spots as a place to spend the night.
5565682,Wedge,2017-05-24 03:08:00,270,Most hotels are booked on Friday nights up until the mayfly hatch. There is a place to camp about 10 miles north of ear falls called Pakwash Provincial Park. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk Pro
