5583033,Sportfisher,2017-06-01 07:54:00,47,"Walleye/Musky:I have fished Minnitaki for the last 5 years. I have caught fish in about every bay up and down the arm. Our group goes out of Donnelly's. You can catch fish in about every bay up and down the arm. We usually catch a lot of eaters just across the bay from the Moonlight Falls. Also, don't overlook going to Lyons Bay. Hope this helps.

5585625,Sportfisher,2017-06-02 08:28:00,47,"Walleye/Musky. Glad I could help. We are leaving 6/10. Good luck!There are a lot of bays in the arm and most if not all hold fish. If it is windy, you can always find a calm spot in the arm. Also, keep in mind that there is a lot of lake other than just the arm. We fish Lyons, Southwest bay, Redpine and around all the islands, and where the English River enters the lake, but that can get crowded. (Southwest and Redpine are sanctuaries, and won't open until 6/15) Great fishery.Good luck!"
