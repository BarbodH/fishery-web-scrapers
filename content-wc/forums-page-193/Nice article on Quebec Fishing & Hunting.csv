5580297,fishron,2017-05-31 05:38:00,317,Good article Andre. I've always considered Quebec a good alternative for quality walleye fishing for anglers on the east coast of the U.S. A twelve to thirteen hour drive put us into some great walleye fishing not to mention seeing bear and moose on most trips. Recent fly-in trips have put the fishing off the charts but many drive-ins were productive and we usually had our traveling limits to twenty inches by the first or second day. Of course it's not all about what you keep......more about the experience.
