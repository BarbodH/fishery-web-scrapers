Ha, they would both come back pizzed at me! But I would still get in a week of fishing in Canada! I think it would be worth it!"
5588561,pjshorthorn,2017-06-04 09:04:00,5654,Ahhhh.....my slow comprehension of humor prevented me from connecting the dots. We could test the theory though..... How about we send your girlfriend to Vegas with my wife and then you and I go to Canada. Your wife would probably understand that you and I are just having a mid-life fishing emergency and your girlfriend would be pretty happy too. PjShorthorn

5589289,zeebee,2017-06-04 16:53:00,1144,Learn to fish...its all 5 star

5585473,Mojo-NC,2017-06-02 07:34:00,1929,"I am toying with the idea of taking my wife up to Canada for a few days to fish and relax - probably September. The problem is, she doesn't fish, so it would have to be a pretty nice place with a guide (so instructions would come from someone other than me!). I checked with one place where I've stayed before and the rates have gone out the roof ($1,825 per person for 3 days /4 nights). The rates were less than that for a whole week when I was last up there. It included a full breakfast that was served to us, the guide prepared a shore lunch each day, and they also served a formal dinner. We'd have to add airfare and car rental on top of that. I'm not going to drop $5K for few days because I'm too cheap for that. I could take her on a cruise for half that amount of money. She's not totally miss prissy, but I know she would not enjoy the rustic cabin where we currently stay while fishing from a 16' boat with a 15 HP tiller motor and then have to prepare all of our own food. Any recommendations? For this particular trip, fishing would be secondary to relaxing and enjoying the scenic beauty of Canada."
5586257,Golden Eagle,2017-06-02 14:27:00,2642,Pretty sure you know the solution. Book a cruise.
5586449,Bstar,2017-06-02 15:53:00,564,"One place that comes to mind that would fit your criteria is Hawk Lake Lodge. It has all of the amenities that you are looking for but the price is probably a little higher than what your looking for. It's a trophy lake with top notch everything including a happy hour. Haven't been there myself but would like to go there someday. You also might want to check into some of the LOTW camps. Or, take her to Cabo San Lucas and go Marlin fishing for a day."
5587481,Mojo-NC,2017-06-03 14:25:00,1929,"Based on the deluge of responses I've received so far, I think you're right. Truth be told, I'm sure I was just looking for another way to fish Canada by bringing my wife along. We've gone on a bunch of cruises. Love that too but it ain't fishing. We've also tried Cabo before - we had a blast. **** that tequila..."
5587513,pjshorthorn,2017-06-03 14:34:00,5654,"Mojo, If I were in your shoes, I would send the wife to Las Vegas with a girlfriend for 4 days and head to Canada for 7 days. It will be cheaper in the long run. The sad part is, my wife would actually take that deal...LOL PjShorthorn"
5587881,kzoofisher,2017-06-03 19:21:00,5144,"""a"" girlfriend? How many do you think he has?"
5587961,pjshorthorn,2017-06-03 20:23:00,5654,"Hey, when you are negotiating with the wife there are talking points to consider. - You will be seeing the sites ,sitting by the pool and sleeping in a suite at Cesars. I'll be fishing in the sun, wind, rain and have a wood stove for heat. - You will be eating at a nice gourmet buffet each night. I'll be cleaning fish while being bitten by mosquitos , cook the meal myself and clean up after dinner the entire week. - You will be going to a show or two for evening entertainment. I will be playing some cards after dinner and staying up to see the northern lights and hear the loons call. - You will be gambling a bit and be pizzed when the house takes your money. I will be enjoying a trip of a lifetime every year I get to go and not be pizzed off when I write the check. Do you want to go to Vegas with A girlfriend or not ? PjShorthorn"
5588033,Aspencreek,2017-06-03 21:16:00,2911,"HAHA HA.......my wife takes that deal in a heartbeat, asks me when I'm leaving and then asks why I didn't negotiate for 2 weeks. My wife has NO ambition to go with me to do a Canadian fishing trip, and personally I am the lucky one!! My former boat partner took his wife a few years ago and now he can't go along with me without her having to go along. I miss him. I filled in with his group a couple years ago, 4 couples, 3 young girls (daughters) and my son and I. The only nice thing about the females along was I didn't have to cook any meals or do any dishes the entire trip, but I didn't enjoy the female complaining, delays due to personal hygene and hair, and constantly asking why there were not seeing any moose or bears. My response was simple ""because you ladies are always TALKING!!!! The animals are like us males, we like the quiet"". My son and I took each one of the daughters with us in our boat for a day so they could catch fish, they had to bait and remove their own fish, and each one had to abide by our rules in the boat (shut up and fish). Each one fought the night before who would go along with us, and were pizzed when they had to go with their parents. Seeing the reaction to actually catching a fish was priceless, but my wife going, her response is NO WAY!"

5588489,Golden Eagle,2017-06-04 07:56:00,2642,This subject is not the type of problem I'd consider sharing with fishing friends.
