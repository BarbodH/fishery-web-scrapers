These fronts will occur approximately every other day until they cease on approximately July 06, 2005. During that time, on those odd occasions it's even safe enough to launch a boat, the fishing will be beyond miserable. As a matter of fact, it will be so cold the walleyes' teeth will chatter until they all fall out, giving them sore gums and even more aversion to feeding than the weather otherwise would. 4 inch perch, however, will bite on occasion if you are willing to work for them. How do I know this? Because the above dates correspond to the dates I'll be in Ontario, and if history is any indicator ... So cancel your trips, take your women and children to your safe place, and clean you guns. Don't say I didn't warn you. (LOL)"
549282,Pooch,2005-06-15 06:26:00,4619,That is what it felt like on last year's August trip. This year we will probably feel like we are in a sauna. Most likely both during the same week. Gotta love a guy with such a defeatest attitude. Pooch

549296,Guest,2005-06-15 07:18:00,0,We'll be in NW Ont at the same time - going to Minaki. We've had snow on July 4th during a couple of trips. Had to light a fire in the fireplace to keep warm. So it figures! :( The good news is that the beer won't have to be put on ice back at the cabin! :) Chuck from IL
549313,Guest,2005-06-15 10:36:00,0,"Been up there in June and slipped on the dock because of frost, and been there in June when the high temp of the day was 100, that time we left for home on Tues noon. Too hot. August has usually been a good time, however last year it did get quite cool. Usually Aug is OK, seldom have really had it hot, cold or rainy. Nor many black flies. The fishing may not be quite as good but it is acceptable and we have a great time."
549324,Guest,2005-06-15 12:48:00,0,I live about 2 hours west of Kenora and its rained here for about 15 days straight. Were actually moving into a sunny trend for the next couple of weeks! the weather for Kenora this weekend is calling for hot and sunny 26 - 28 degrees celsius (high 70's low 80's). I hope this doesn't slow down the bite. Was out last weekend and must have caught over 200 walleye between a few guys. Gonna head back out this weekend for more action! (packing sunscreen this time as its going to be sunny and drunk this weekend!!)
549326,Guest,2005-06-15 12:51:00,0,Thanks for the update Rye. I'm looking forward to some decent weather and a decent bite. Chuck from IL
549327,Guest,2005-06-15 12:54:00,0,"Come on, I've never missed a 4th of July in NW Ontario, it doesn't snow here then unless your refering to the kind you snort! seen that many a long weekends in the wild!!!"
549328,Guest,2005-06-15 12:57:00,0,Here's a couple of good canadian weather links to keep an eye on the weather in the area (a lot more accurate than cnn or yahoo)http://www.theweathernetwork.com/wea...s/CAON0340.htm andhttp://weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/city/p..._metric_e.html
