549157,JDP,2005-06-13 14:51:00,1457,"I saw the ""accident scene"" as I was driving from Dryden to Fort Frances before the flatbeds arrived. It appeared as though the boat was not secured to the trailer with a bow safety chain and/or transm tie-downs. The boat was laying on the ground, with engine parts scattered on the ground. The 3 tavelers all appeared to be be fine."

549307,Guest,2005-06-15 09:55:00,0,"I am not sure if it was the same accident but on the 3rd of June we passed the truck and boat (still attached) down in the ravine all smashed. It must have just happened because the police, as well as 4-5 witnesses were standing around. This was about 5pm....it didn't look good. It was hard to believe that the boat as well as the truck took so much damage and were able to stay attached. We talked about that all week while we were fishing at eagle. I hope those people were all right."
549378,Guest,2005-06-16 08:18:00,0,WHEN WE DROVE 502 AT NIGHT ON JUNE 2ND WE SAW 12 MOOSE AND NEARLY HIT TWO OF THEM. THEY ARE ALMOST BLACK IN COLOR AND VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE TIRED. BE VERY CAREFUL IF DRIVING 502 AT NIGHT - VERY DANGEROUS!
549379,wooglin,2005-06-16 08:26:00,371,"Our first year (two years ago), we did the night-driving thing - almost hit a few moose. Last year, we drove through the day, didn't see a single moose. We will be driving in the day this year again - it's pretty hard to be fishing on no sleep in 30 hours anyway."
549386,Guest,2005-06-16 12:23:00,0,"I've driven 502 many times, but only once at night. I swerved to miss about the 9th moose we saw that night and clipped his rear end with the outside mirror on the passenger side. It ripped the mirror off, but what really shook me up was that my son was sleeping in the seat right next to the mirror. Never again will I make that drive at night."
549389,Trailerguy,2005-06-16 15:30:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I've driven 502 many times at night. The moose are more prone to be on the road after dusk for several hours and at pre-dawn. Also I have two sets of deer whisle's mounted on my truck, one set on the front bumper and one set behind the cab on top of the topper. I know a lot of people don't think they work, but between them and the rattle of my Cummins, I've not had a close call yet. Generally I see them turn their head toward the headlights and then they move off in plenty of time."
549411,Guest,2005-06-17 09:35:00,0,We came across the same accident on June 2 involving the Dodge on our way home. The driver and his young son appeared to be fine. They were on the side with the troopers. The Dad was wiping blood from his ear but looked ok. They must have been wearing seatbelts.
