549314,Guest,2005-06-15 10:47:00,0,Heading up to Eagle next week wondered if anyone has any update on bite activity.
549330,Guest,2005-06-15 13:46:00,0,"What side of the lake are you going to? We just came back on Sunday June 12th. We were there for 10 days and had one of the best years in 17 years of fishing Eagle. I can help you with the east arm.... Osbourn bay was hot last week, mucluk,Rice, muskeg and Stanton bays were all on as well. For what ever reason, spring bay was producing good size fish but a very slow bite. This may have changed by now. Walleyes are on the weed edges 5-8ft, Northern are everywhere. Smallies are still prespawn for the most part. Rocks/coontail/ and cabbage combination for smallies, also wind blown points in deeper water for bigger fish (we had 7 fish over 5lbs. I hope this helps. Danny"

549381,Guest,2005-06-16 08:59:00,0,"Yep, You will be on the west arm of the lake. It has Deeper, clearer water and very productive. I would not really be able to point you in the right direction because I havn't fished that side of the lake in years. Good luck, have fun."
