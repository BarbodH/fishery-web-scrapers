Is it worth the time to take a half-day and try for some smallmouth, lake trout, or muskie on Vermillion? I have a very limited amount of experience chasing these three types of fish. I am not expecting specific spots but any general information concerning depth, structure, and lure presentations would be great."
549354,Guest,2005-06-15 21:43:00,0,"i am sitting by a fireplace right now about a mile up the road from deer path in a cabin on botham bay of big vermillion lake. we fished hard today for muskie and smallies. caught about a dozen smallies up to 4lbs on blue rapalas and husky jerks around main lake boulders. we rose 13 muskies catching two on white spinner baits, slug o's and blue huskie jerk in 5 to 10 feet of water in covered mud bottom bays with weeds. there were a couple boats trolling for lakers in main lake deep holes. good luck"
549372,Guest,2005-06-16 07:17:00,0,Thanks for the current report. I am going to try and get a map and give it a go. Would you suggest morning or evening? Hopefully our resort owner can point out some things also. We mainly pull the boat up to deception bay launch and fish the manitou rapids or sen bay areas for walleye. Just looking for some other options. Thanks again.
549385,jimbo,2005-06-16 11:45:00,223,I have fished Big Vermillion and LacSuel several times. Your Host (Rick) knows the lake as good as anyone O know. He has a map aND WILL HELP YOU. I stay there too. Was to go up the first part of June but wife had a blood clot in her lung so postponed it till later. Rick is great about helping guests out. Say hi from Jim in Minnesota if you would.
549393,Guest,2005-06-16 17:08:00,0,Thanks for the reply Jimbo. Sorry to hear about your wife. I figured our host could get me started but I thought I would give this forum a shot. I will say Hello from you for sure.
549394,Guest,2005-06-16 17:45:00,0,Hey Rock Guy...How do you fish Manitou Rapids? The last time I was through there the water was swift and deep. Do you fish the bay to the right going down stream or the small one on the left? Will be up there this fall and appreciate any help. eyesnatcher
549397,Guest,2005-06-16 20:45:00,0,Both of the spots you mention hold fish. Get out of the fast current and use bottom bouncers with a spinner and nightcrawler or minnow.

One second, we'd be floating near the shore at 10 FOW, the next second we're out in the current showing 60 FOW....didn't catch a thing. We didn't anchor in the shallow stuff though, we just got out of there and tried to get fish up stream. Any suggestions? Anchor shallow and throw deep? Live bait, plastics, troll cranks? Thanks."
