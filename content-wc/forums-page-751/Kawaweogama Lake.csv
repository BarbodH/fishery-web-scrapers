548901,JohnAB,2005-06-07 14:42:00,49,Heading out to Kawa first week of July for 3 weeks. Anyone else going to be out there during that timeframe?
549219,Guest,2005-06-14 09:07:00,0,6 of us will be there the last week of July. It looks like we will just miss you. We get there on the 24th - will the days overlap at all or will you be back? I would like to find out how the fishing is. This will be our 7th trip and we always go about the same time of year. We stay at Allanwater Lodge. I noticed an older post where you mentioned that your in-law's own the cabin on Star Island. That is one of our favorite places to fish especially for big Northern. We spoke to Barney last week and I heard the water level is just right. Looking forward to it.

So by all means stop by and gladly tell you where we had good luck on the lake. I know last August we had tremendous success fishing in the mouth of the river south of Ignace Airways cabin. Even managed to catch a 10 lb northern there as well. I am really looking forward to the trip. Be leaving here in two weeks, arrive in Sioux Lookout on the 30th of this month. Fish around there for a few days before we fly out to camp. We use Art Latto for the flight, real nice people. Who do you fly out to Allanwater with? Went over to the lodge last year, seems to be a very nice place and Barney (hope I got the name right)and his sons are real nice as well. This year I am going to pick up some momentos (sweatshirts and hats) from him."
