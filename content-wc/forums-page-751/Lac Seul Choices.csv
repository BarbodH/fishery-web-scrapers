549310,NateW,2005-06-15 10:15:00,96,"Steve, I'll be at Onaway in July, this will be our fifth trip to LS but first to Onaway. We took a tour on our last trip and loved the place! Can't wait to stay there for a week. But it took us two years to get in! Mickey, If you don't want to use live bait, then let me suggest a spinner rig tipped with just an ordinary twister tail. Our last trip in 2003 there was a minnow shortage and our lodge had trouble getting minnows in on a regular basis. We switched to twister tails and never missed a beat. LS is a great fishery, but it's not like you can just throw ANYTHING into the water and expect it to get hammered. You still have to give the fish what they want. I have sat in a boat and caught fish after fish after fish, while the other guys in my boat caught one or two to each of my ten. The only difference was the color of our spinners. When the other guys finally realized that it DID make a difference--the fish wanted lime green, we all caught fish. But if the fish want spinners and you give them cranks, you're probably not going to think LS is all that great."
549338,Guest,2005-06-15 16:43:00,0,"Guys, I use live bait all the time, I just read others posts about using hundreds of minnows during a weeks stay and I asked if crankbaits would work if the fish were biting that well. I may not be too bright, however, if I was catching fish on live bait rigs and switched to cranks and the bite stopped, I think I would be smart enough to go back to what was working. Some things that I'm unsure of is the ""slot size"", and are most of the 100 per day ""eyes"" under 15"", or do you normally catch quite a few nice fish per day? Can you fish most days in a 16ft. boat safely or does a smaller boat limit you on access to ""hot spots"" on the lake? Are there so many underwater hazards on LS that I need a guide so I don't tear the lower unit up on my 40hp motor or are the hazards well marked? You guys certainly have peaked my interest in LS, now it seems like I have to focus on a time and resort to pick. Thanks for all the information, tight lines to all !!"
549344,IA  DAN,2005-06-15 19:29:00,53,"Mickey,First of all this will be my 6th yr on the great L.S.and your 16ft boat will be just fine as long as you watch the weather and wind.We go up the last of July to the 1st of Aug. and we dont use minnows(to hard to keep alive and we dont need them),theres 6 of us and sometimes 7 and we always take up 2 flats of night crawlers and buy 2lbs of leeches in Ft. Frances.We make our own Lindy rigs around 12-16inches long with a 1/2oz sliding sinker.I put the quick change clevises on but I dont always use a blade.If you make your rigs to long your going to get alot of break offs and with Lac Seul being a stained lake you dont have to worry about the fish being spooked.If you use common since in navigating(I recommend a GPS)and dont go to fast you will be alright however all of the bolders arent marked on the map and yes they can take out your lower unit.As far as having 100 aday catches yes its possible but wont happen everyday,depending on what time of year your going but we find them bunched up on windy sides of Islands when we go.Sometimes its one after another and I'm talking walleye anywhere from 17-26in.If anyone wants to know we use Fireline and Power Pro line on our reels and also in making our Lindy Rigs,#4 and #6 wide gap hooks.Last year we found that 1/4oz Ratl Traps in crawdad,firetiger,silver and blue worked well for Small Mouth and Walleye.We normally float and vertical jig with our Lindys 90% of the time and then maybe throw afew cranks to do something diff.by the end of the week I cant hardly move my trigger finger(taking some kind of hand lotion isnt a bad idea).You guys are getting me all excited I cant wait,we leave July29TH.I've already made up 32 Lindy Rigs to take up with me so all I can do is WAIT. If you have any more questions I will try to answer them.If you want to know we stay at Lac Seul Lodge at one of Dans Outpost cabins,BlackBay.Good Luck to all that go there and have a safe trip. Catch and Release the Big Ones so somebody else has a chance to catch there DREAM FISH."
549348,Guest,2005-06-15 20:47:00,0,HEY NATE... When in July will you be headin back to LS Will be there 6/26-7/8 Would be nice to soak a twister-tail w/you... MP3553
549349,Guest,2005-06-15 20:47:00,0,HEY NATE... When in July will you be headin back to LS Will be there 6/26-7/8 Would be nice to soak a twister-tail w/you... MP3553
549375,NateW,2005-06-16 07:44:00,96,"I'll be there July 22 - 29. This is the latest we have ever gone. We usually are there the week after July 4th, but this is the only time I could get our group into Onaway. Didn't mean to sound so patronizing earlier, I guess I need to read the posts a little differently. In previous trips we've usually left the dock with 3 - 4 dozen minnows per boat--two guys in each boat. That has lasted us about half the day and then we would switch to plastics. However on the last two or three days of the last trip we didn't even reload our minnow buckets and used plastics exclusively. A 16 ft boat will be fine. That's all any of us have. Just be smart and pay attention. I strongly recommend the Explorer Series of maps (AW Coldstream, Dryden, Ont. 800-465 7230) These maps are color coded and do a ""pretty good"" job of showing most hazards in the water. Take note that ""most"" does not mean ""all"". But these are the best LS maps I have seen. (IMHO) We have never used a guide at LS and never had problems finding fish, and I consider my group and I to be pretty crummy fishermen. The Explorer Maps and a compass seem to work pretty well for us. But by asking a few questions on this board-like you are doing, pretty much got us up and started. Once we found a pattern to the type of structure where we caught fish, we started slamming them all over the lake. Find a lodge, make your reservations, then come back here and seek out people who have stayed at that same place. Your camp operator should give you good instructions on where to begin as well. I bet it is safe to assume that you will not ask him any question that he is not capable of answering and no matter how much you think it's a ""stupid question"", it is a safe bet he/she has had heard much worse. My best advice would be: Pay attention to the weather; troll past the windward side of any island--especially if it is adjacent to deep water; troll alongside any beach--especially if the winds is blowing into it--start at 10 ft and move out a foot or two deeper on each pass; when in doubt, boat slow; make sure everybody in your group knows and obeys the fishing and boating regs and if stopped by the MNR be couteous and respectful. Oh yes, one other thing. Plan a good shorelunch. Eating shorelunch might just be the best part of the day! Now what am I going to do to kill these last 36 days?????????"
549388,Guest,2005-06-16 14:16:00,0,"Hey Nate, thanks for all your insight into LS, and what to expect. Do you have a website for Onaway Lodge? I've also heard that Fisherman's Cove is a good resort if Onaway is booked, any experience at the ""Cove""? If we can put this trip together I will definitely have ""shore lunches"" as a part of our day!! We used to go into the BWCA & Quetico and we ate fish almost everyday. Leave a few for me next year, and I doubt that you & your group are ""crummy"" fishermen. Take care and have a GREAT trip!! Mickey"
549414,NateW,2005-06-17 10:45:00,96,"We made a quick drive through both Onaway and Fisherman's Cove and stopped to talk to both owners. Fisherman's Cove is also very nice and is on the same bay (Scout Bay) as Onaway. Now having never stayed at either place I only have a ten-minute observation as my judge, but when we went through Fisherman's Cove we noticed a well-manicured swimming beach, some paddle boats, a playground and beautiful manicured flower boxes on each cabin. The place was spotless. But it seemed a little too-family oriented for us. Our entire group is comprised of fathers of small children. (When we started taking an annual fishing trip in 1997--NONE of us had kids!) So taking a vacation at a resort that seemed family-oriented just didn't get us that excited. If I were taking my wife, 6 year-old and 4 year-old, I'd take Fisherman's Cover over Onaway. Onaway seemed to be more geared to fishermen and only fishermen. Here is what they have for a website, and it isn't much:http://www.sunsetcountry.net/onaway/ Like I said, I have never even stayed there yet but the little drive-through tour told me a lot and what I have learned from this board seem to back that up. I hate to talk about it here though because getting in to the place is hard enough already!"
549415,Guest,2005-06-17 12:13:00,0,"Nate and Mickey are correct. The best thing to do is what the fish want. And sometime it seems that if you can get anything into the ""zone"" it will work, other days you can throw the kitchen sink and just find the ""sheltered workshop"" fish. But that is the great thing about LS, you can go into South Inlet and they will hit on spinners with a minnow, go to Ghost Narrows and leeches will work, up in Steamboat you may have to go deeper with jigs. Sounds great doesn't it? In our group of 4 we will go through 80 dz minnows (provided by Onaway) and 2-3 pounds of Leeches, and 20 dz crawlers for the week. And DEAD MINNOWS work just as well as live ones on spinner rigs and jigs, in fact I was at an expo this spring and a guide said he preferred his minnows dead. I have never noticed a difference. If you are slip bobbering I guess it might. Watch the weather, don't wait until the last minute to outrace a storm, the spot will still be there tomorrow, I guarantee you will lose the race. I have seen a couple of boats that spent a night on an Island, they survived but gave up a pint or 2 to the local insects. Only a few of the spots are marked with bottles. Most are not, just make sure the front man has his eyes open. I came real close to taking off the lower unit last year, just missing a Volkswagon size boulder in the middle of open water. I wet myself that day. I have stayed at Onaway the last 5 years and gets better every year, but I go there because it is for guys/gals who want to fish. If you are taking the family or kids go someplace else that caters to families, like Fishermans Cove. Onaway is getting hard to get into because of that. In our group.... no wives or kids under 20. I had a cousin bring his family now he can't come by himself....told you so. I leave next thursday, check in on friday....Packed and ready to go. Good fishing to all"
549419,jswinter,2005-06-17 14:23:00,4,"wow what a great site. I have fished LS the past 3 years and I'm going up next week. We Don't fish the same area you guys are referring to but we fish the east side going out of hudson. We usually take 2-3 trips up there per year. we're going to take a houseboat in august this year also. this is absolutely the best walleye fishing lake I have ever encountered. If you have any type of walleye fishing know-how then there is absolutely no need for a guide. Wind blown points, islands, sunken rock piles adjacent to deep water are all outstanding places to try. We have had many 100 fish days and the fish are healthy and strong. I have had a 30 minute stretch were I caught 7 26-29 inch fish in a row. Plus there is many eaters in the 15-16 inch range. I look ahead every year when I am sitting in the fish house on the ice in MN. We go out of hudson, with the houseboat or when we go with out the HB. We just stay in a hotel in sioux lookout put in at the public launch in Hudson. we fish in and around Lost Island Lodge a little bit, but most of the time we end up fishing 35 miles up the lake. NO need at all to fish like a Minnesotan (on top of another because you saw them catch a fish). We go until we can't see another boat or just go to some favorite spots. We use minnows in June mostly but with warmer weather usually means they preferr crawlers. Leeches work well too and plastics like GULP! will be my best friend from the experience using them in MN lakes. I can't wait. By the way we have done well with cranks also and slip-bob. just an awesome fishery for numbers and quality. good luck , but you won't need it."
549109,Canadian Club,2005-06-12 19:45:00,5,"We just returned Friday night from a Houseboat trip to the Chamberlin area. We had 5 people and went through 100 dozen minows, 60 dozen frozen (Borax) minows and 3# of leeches. The bite was amazing, two of us boated 100 eyes before lunch one day. we didn't count much after that but every day was great!"
549119,Guest,2005-06-13 07:18:00,0,"Just returned from week at NW sec. Lac Seul. Weather-worst ever, rained everyday (7 total)w/wind also. BUT the fishing was the BEST by far that I've seen in my 8 yrs. going up there. Water level is way up from last year (4feet) and was going up about 10"" inches a week from the people at camp. Went through 68 Dozen minnows in 5 days but leeches & crawlers worked great too! Stayed around 5-10 feet of water and caught around 60 pike in the 6 days we fished but the slot high limit was hard to top at 34.5"" but several 31-34 inch northerns. Walleyes about 1/3 of them were in or over slot. The 2 of our boats easily caught over 600-700 fish."
549129,Guest,2005-06-13 09:05:00,0,"You will find that Lost Island is considerably less expensive than Chamberlain. We have done both and you cannot not go wrong with Lost Island. Cabins, docking facilities and all the help you can use is right there. And it comes with a smile."
549177,Guest,2005-06-13 19:31:00,0,"Do you have to use live bait to catch numbers of fish? I understand that live bait probably produces more fish but if you throw crankbaits at them there must be a few that will bite. When you guys are catching 100 ""eyes"" per day, are most of them under 15""? I'm very interested in trying to find a ""sure bet""(is there such a thing when fishing?) for a neighbor and his sons for next year with my son and myself(they are novice fishermen). I've been designated the ""scout"" to find the resort and I've narrowed my choices to 3 lakes(LOTW,LS,Rainy) with Coppens Resort on Rainy the only 1 of the 3 I've actually stayed at. Smallie fishing was awesome but we caught walleyes also, although 20 a day was a normal day. Anyone who has fished all 3 lakes with a preference? I should add that remoteness is somewhat important to me, I don't want to fish where you're surrounded by others and have boats buzzing by all day, I can stay home and enjoy that:("
549192,Guest,2005-06-13 23:18:00,0,"You do not have to jig or backtroll spinner rigs with live(or dead)bait, but if that is what the fish want, why disappoint them? Sure there are the few that will hit a crankbait, but why all the hard work? And i also guarantee that you will lose 1/2 of what you throw to either sunken lumber or Northern. When I want to cast, I cast for Northern or Muskie but believe me it's just for comic relief, certainly not because I want those slimy, smelly snakes in my boat. As for reseaching for a place to go, that's easy.....Lac Seul. LOTW will cost you more, just because, and Rainy can be very unpredictable, and pricy. Any of the Ear Falls camps are very nice, my personal favorite is Onaway. Blair and Kathy are the best, and working hard to overcome a bad rap from the previous owners. New boats (17 Lunds w/ 50hp 4 strokes)new fish house and upgrading of cabins, plus being located in the middle of the NW section you can go north, east or west of Scout bay and find good spots everywhere. Getting reservations is getting harder and harder but there are other camps nearby that you may be able to get into. I make mine a year in advance, and keep it every year. I go up the 23rd, Onaway has a Fri to Fri week which makes life much easier at the borders. Plus we get Sat on the water to ourselves when everyone else is moving in or out."
549193,Guest,2005-06-13 23:21:00,0,I recommend it too. But we are making it harder to get our own reservations.
549194,Guest,2005-06-13 23:22:00,0,I will send you an e-mail tonight
549260,Guest,2005-06-14 16:54:00,0,"Steve, would slip bobbers work better at avoiding snags yet keep the bait ""in the strike zone""? The other members of my party fish about 4-5 times a year while I try to fish 15-20 days per month(when my wife says OK:-)) so I don't want to see them snagged on the structure all the time. Would anchoring be an option or does trolling/drifting work lots better? Is the smallie action as good as the walleye bite or don't you target them? Thanks for all your insight into LS !! Mickey"
549274,Guest,2005-06-14 23:01:00,0,"You are bound and determined to use crankbaits aren't you? I suppose that would work.....but why? I used to throw all the time too, but after days with 10 fish, I now get 50 to 60 fish per day with better size. Spinner rigs are less than $1 CN and jig heads less than that. I catch walleyes, Northern and Smallies doing the same thing. I have found a couple of good smallie spots(that I will keep to myself) that if I want a change of pace I will cast, but I raise plenty without changing tactics. Tell you what....you use your stick baits for a day, then try my way, then you decide. Or better yet, hire a guide, and do what they do, that's how I finally figured it out."
549279,Guest,2005-06-15 04:20:00,0,Actually I prefer to locate reefs/humps and use slip bobbers to cover the structure. Leeches & minnows just above the bottom have produced very well for me in the past. I'm so used to casting for pike/muskie that throwing cranks just seems natural but I'm just as happy to watch the bobber slowly disappear. Thanks again !!
549030,Guest,2005-06-10 19:04:00,0,"Comtemplating going to Lac Seul next year and considering either Lost Island Lodge or Lac Seul Outposts at Chamberlain narrows. Anyone been to both....and have thoughts regarding both? Also, how many minnows do you typically use in June and July? One of the camp owners today told us that one group went through 368 dozen in one week last year. I think she said that the party had 4 or 6 in it. Seems like a lot of minnows. Any other recommendations on Lac Seul? SWW looks awesome...but a little to pricey. Any help would be appreciated."
549033,Guest,2005-06-10 20:38:00,0,"Lac Seul is simply an awsome fishery. But I'm not going to tell you where I stay, it's getting harder and harder to get my own reservations. Anyway, Our group has gone to the North end for the last 10 years, Ear Falls area camps. All are very good and fishing is excellent. It really depends on what you want. We fish! ALL DAY> No families, just the guys week out, the best thing for me is that when the phone rings I know it's not for me. If you are bringing the family some camps are going to be better suited than others. Walleyes like you would not believe, I believe there are more ""eyes"" in Lac Seul than in WI and MN combined, and if you don't believe it.....you have not fished Lac Seul"
549034,Guest,2005-06-10 20:44:00,0,"Sorry.. I forgot about the minnow question. That group had to be eating them like sardines. No way they went through that many catching fish, somethings screwy there. We usually will take out about 3 to 4 dz per 2 men in boat along with some leeches and worms and that will last through 50 to 60 fish per day."
549035,Guest,2005-06-10 20:46:00,0,Steve: What depth did you find walleyes in? How are water temps? Water levels? Will be going up next week Friday.
549037,Guest,2005-06-10 21:02:00,0,"I am going up the week after you. I have heard but not confirmed that the water temps are a bit higher than last year at the same time and water levels are up too. Good news for us. I will backtroll inline spinner rigs tipped with minnows or leeches in less than 10' and move out until we find them. Listen to the lodge owner, they know. If it's your first time, HIRE A GUIDE! Absolutely worth the $$$, better than guessing and that's all you are doing. You can buy the spinner rigs anywhere up there cheap, but buy a bunch. Our group (4)ties our own and we will go through 100 in a week. You will lose them to snags, breakoffs and more than likely Northern. We don't even cast for northern because we catch enough fishing for ""eyes"". I use the leaded inline chain sinker to get it down, it's simpler and I can feel the bite better, bottom bouncers you can keep, in fact you can have all of mine. They to can be purchased there. Where are you going, if it is near Ear Falls I can give you a couple spots to try. My son and I were there 2 years ago when the water level was down almost 4 feet. That gave us a really clear picture of what kind of structure most people drive right by. There was stuff sticking out of the water that I had driven by for years, now it is a hot spot."
549048,Hump,2005-06-11 09:38:00,578,I will be in the same area the last week of June for the first time. I would sure like your wisdom. I don't know your e-mail. Mine is [email protected]. I would appreciate any or all advise! thanks
549052,Guest,2005-06-11 10:57:00,0,If you are looking for an awsome lodge in Canada on Lac Suel Go to Onaway Lodge. It is an awsome resort and the fishing cant be beat. Give them a call.
549060,Guest,2005-06-11 15:11:00,0,"I would go with Lost Island Lodge, they have great cabins, boats guides, equipment, and different packages to fit your needs and budget. They will personally make sure that your trip is enjoyable. That seems like alot of minnows, but I would believe it, if they were 6 people, and walleye fish hard everyday, you could do it. We have had lots of 100+ walleye days on different trips. I don't think you'll be disappointed. If you get a guide, ask for Basil, he's a riot."
549072,Guest,2005-06-11 23:16:00,0,ttt
549099,Tom Larson,2005-06-12 14:07:00,2,"My wife and I spent the week following May 28 at Lost Island. I'll vouch for the prior post. You couldn't ask for better service or a better guide than Basil. As for the minnows, we went through 25 dozen. Most of our fish the last two days were caught on gulp and power baits. We fished 5' to 7' of water. Never caught anything deeper than 7'. Walleyes to 25 1/2""; SMB @ 18""; pike to 33"" (not many pike caught all week. I did hear a report of a 43"" er. This was our first trip to Lost Island. We have a reservation for next year. We really didn't keep track of numbers other than the first hour of our last day. We caught a walleye every three minutes, on average. Quite a few shorts but also a few in the 22"" to 23"" range. Only 50 weeks until next year."
