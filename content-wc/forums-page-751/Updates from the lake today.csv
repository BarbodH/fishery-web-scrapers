We launch about 1/2 mile down the road from there too. We have three boats this year, so I'd like to spend more time on Vermillion going for the big ones while the other boats can go get dinner off of Lac Seul. That is the one thing that really stands out about B Vermillion, how clear it is...you can literally see your lures attracting the fish...awesome. Keep 'em comin! PS, when are you off the lake? I can't recall if you'll be up there when we get there, our first day on the water will be the 25th, so if you're around, we should hook up for a cold one or maybe some fishing time!"

We have been fishing Minataki and Lac Suel for the past three days pulling 50 to 75 walleye a day. good supply of 16s to 17s to eat, a dozen in the slot and 3 over. sun happened the day before yesterday for a couple hours and was able to hit a few Beeig smallies 19, 20 inches on minataki on minnow cranks around rock. the eyes have been deeper 15 to 20ft, pike are around them and hooked one 55+ inch muskie on lac suel that almost made it to the net. it was in 5 feet of water in weeds and hit a slugo type bait on the surface. weather in sioux lookout has been 55 to 65 with clouds and 70 to 80 when the sun peeks out. been good fishing."
549121,wooglin,2005-06-13 07:44:00,371,"Great new Wildcat - keep 'em comin. Any word on where you guys lost that big muskie? Will be up there in about 10 days, always looking for the big one!"
549153,Guest,2005-06-13 14:05:00,0,"Bear claw bay on lac suel. amazing, way back in the back in the weeds, uncommon for this time of year unless we caught her sunning after a day of eating. right out of the video. casted to an open pocket in the weeds fishing for pike. she came from about 15 feet away all the way out of water, hammerd it hard but those top water plastic baits only hook one out of 10 fish. had her on for a few seconds and she came all the way out of the water as she passed the boat and threw the hook right at me. my biggest was a 48 incher and this one was way over 50. guy in the boat next to me likened it to one of the gators he saw of a boat in florida recently. good fishing around manitou rapids on lac suel but not to good at crooked."
549154,wooglin,2005-06-13 14:17:00,371,"Are you referring to BearPaw bay, just NorthWest of Sioux Lookout on the map? I see BearPaw bay just south of ""Manitou Shortcuts."" Do you guys get there from the Deception Bay landing or Lost Lake in Hudson?!?!http://crownlanduseatlas.mnr.gov.on....fs/_930500.pdf AWESOME fish man, I hope to see that same one when I get there. Were you targeting muskie or casting for pike?"
549195,Guest,2005-06-14 01:59:00,0,"We got there from pelican lake. the water is high enough to get through pelican falls. if you are trailering i think deception bay would be the best boat launch. we were fishing for pike in the weeds and that is the right bay, all the way in the back."
549199,Guest,2005-06-14 05:52:00,0,"Wildcat, don't feel like the Lone Ranger, I am at the cottage this week (Dinorwic area)and still feel like I need to keep up with what is being said on Walleye Central. Will probably travel up your way at least once this week to see if we can find a fish. For those of you coming up later this week the weather looks good after today (Tuesday). Has been a little rainy but not bad and the fish are biting. I will add the mosquitoes are about as bad as I have seen but are not much of a problem on the water and I have not noticed any black flies."
549287,wooglin,2005-06-15 06:58:00,371,UPDATE! UPDATE! UPDATE!
549299,Guest,2005-06-15 07:36:00,0,"Yesterday was the toughest yet. we only boated about 40 eyes yesterday a few pike, a few smallies and a mid 30's muskie. however, with the crappy weather came three eyes over the slot from less than 6 feet of water. looks sunny the next few days so we are going to chase smallies and musky on big v then hit the english river opening tomorrow. more to come....."
549300,wooglin,2005-06-15 07:39:00,371,"Sounds great. Let me know how you do on Big V., we have a campsite on that lake and might park the boats there for an early morning muskie run....spots/tips appreciated!"
549357,Guest,2005-06-15 22:01:00,0,"fished from 10am to 3pm, rose 10 skies caught two in the mid 30s fished from 5pm to dark and caught 1000 skeeters. we did see a couple of them on a nest in the back of our bay (botham) i would try there as well as the far east bay on the main lake. did good on blue husky jerk, white spinner bait and slug o. they were a little skiddish today, very sunny out and crystal clear water. one of the fish was a nice tiger muskie and two of the ones we rose were over 40."
