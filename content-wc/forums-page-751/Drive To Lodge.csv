548985,Guest,2005-06-09 11:34:00,0,I know the title is drive to lodge but a lot of people are putting boat in lodges. So I would recommend wine lake camp off of wabaskang lake. It is the only resort on the lake system. It is a wonderful place and also the owners have a couple of young kids.
548993,Brax,2005-06-09 13:18:00,52,"I second Witch Bay Camp. Spent a couple of years there until I switched for LOTW to Lac Suel. Great people, good food and they spend time showing you where the hot spots are."
549332,Dr. Lee,2005-06-15 15:15:00,15,"Another possibility is at www.thaddeuslakelodge.com It is about one hour on partially paved/partially gravel road just north of Dryden. Thaddeus Lake is connected via a large culvert to Ord and Moose Lakes, so plenty of water to fish. The guy who runs the camp (Rocky) is really a great guy and will help you with fishing from marking maps to guiding to whatever you want. The cabins are very nice and clean. It is definitely remote: Treat it like a fly in and take everything you want on your trip in from Dryden. There is no real camp store, bar, etc. Boats are good or take your own. The docks are nice and you have a 24 hour generator for electricity. Many people who stay there are repeat customers and rave about the place. Fishing is quite good...especially the quality of the fish. Some darn big muskies in the lake if you are interested, but primarily it is a walleye fishery. Weed edges, points, a couple of reefs on Thaddeus. Ord has islands, points, weed edges and Moose is mostly weed edges. Jigs if you find a school of walleyes, but Little Joe type spinners with a crawler or minnow are preferred. I am certain that there are no other camps on this three lake system, only a few private cabins. I think there is one primitive boat landing on Ord. Check early for reservations...Rocky is usually filled for the summer, but seems to have a few openings if you are flexible on dates. Good luck!"
549359,Guest,2005-06-15 22:10:00,0,"I have never been to Indian Lake Lodge, sounds OK. We stay at Clark's Camp or KC's Landing on the chain. The Clark's own both places and we have been happy there. We normally do pretty good on walleyes. Always have some musky action while fishing for eyes. Normally catch a smallie or two. We are not happy about the northerns showing up, but they are there now. As far as other fishermen, seems to be more of them every year. We had one boat troll between us and the shore line we were casting this year. Fritz"
548828,Guest,2005-06-04 22:26:00,0,"My friends and I are looking for a secluded drive-in lodge in Ontario. Preferrably one that is the only lodge on the lake. We were considering Wawang Resort but they got very unfavorable posts (although they are about 2 yrs. old). We are also considering Medicine Stone Lodge, Young Lake Lodge and North Star Lodge on Clay Lake. Does anyone have any suggestions? If you know of any other lodges please let me know. Our primary concerns are remoteness and good walleye fishing. We still haven't ruled out Wawang but we're doubtful. Thanks in advance - Seth"
548838,Gary_IA,2005-06-05 10:42:00,144,My brother went to the resort on Wenasaga Lake about 7 years ago. As I recall there was only one resort on the Lake but that it has a public ramp access. It is north of Lac Seul. I believe the camp boats come with a 15 hp electric start motor. The Walleye fishing was good and other lakes are nearby with boats caches. Try the website: www.wenasaga.com I have no connection or financial interest in the above resort or in any of the resorts that I mention. Remote drive in resorts might be hard to find. An alternative is to go to a boat in resort. We went to Cascade Camp at the north end of the north arm 5 years ago. Basic bare bones camp with outstanding smallmouth bass fishing. Resort operator arranged for a boat big enough to carry our 5 person party and gear in. With the boat operator and his friend there were 7 in the boat. I think it took us about 30 to 40 minutes to get to the resort. Lake of the Woods has several resorts arround Morson or Sleeman Ontario both drive in and boat in. Hope you find a good resort and good fishing.
548840,Trailerguy,2005-06-05 10:55:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]You might try Pickrel Creek Camp, south of Perrault Falls. The camp is located on the creek entering Pickrel Lake, which has no resorts actually on it. It has boats on a number of remote drive to lakes as well, with walleye, pike, lake trout and smallmouth bass. The new owner, Dave, is easy to work with 807-529-3132."
548844,Guest,2005-06-05 12:48:00,0,"Witch Bay Camp probably the most secluded drive in camp on the Lake of the Woods. Great camp boats, 50 HP four strokes, two depth finders, bow mount trolling motor, live well, and built in gas. American Plan camp. Fishing program to get you on fish. Silver Water Wheel Lodge on Lac Seul. Mike Willems probably runs the best show in the business. Not cheap but most likely catches more 28 inch plus walleyes than all the rest of the camps. Very well trained guides. Andy Myers Lodge on Eagle Lake run by Steve Herbeck who might be the best musky fisherman alive. Great program for serious angler."
548845,Guest,2005-06-05 13:25:00,0,"Try Dog Lake Resort near Thunder Bay. Big lake, one resort, great fishing! -Davis"
548886,Guest,2005-06-06 17:25:00,0,"Seth, I would think long and hard before going to Wawang. I have heard nothing good about the lake, although I have never been there. Perhaps someone who has been there recently could give you an update?"
548891,Guest,2005-06-07 07:55:00,0,I have fished out of Williams Lake Lodge for several years and have access to LacSeul via Williams Creek. Lots of good fishing but mainly you are fishing SW to W end of LacSeul. Good luck!
548895,JimH,2005-06-07 10:20:00,320,"I would highly recommend Indian Lake Lodge, just north of Vermilion Bay. It's part of a 10 lake chain, good walleye, muskie, and lake trout, and now northern. Fishing pressure isn't too bad, very nice cabins, and fairly easy access. I've been going there for 20 years now. I know others from this website and others that have gone there on my recommendation and have been very happy with it."
548973,grt1,2005-06-09 06:26:00,259,"ONE OF MY FIRST EXPERIENCES IN VERMILLION BAY WAS FISHING INDIAN LAKE AND ALL WE CAUGHT WERE SMALL 8 - 10 INCH WALLEYE, THAT SAID, I WATCHED A FISHING SHOW THIS WINTER WHERE THEY WERE FISHING THE INDIAN LAKE CHAIN AND THEY WERE GETTING SOME AMAZING MUSKIES AND WALLEYES OUT OF THE CHAIN OF LAKES. I WOULD LIKE TO GO THERE AGAIN AND TRY IT, WITHOUT MY PREVIOUS GUIDES."
548974,Gary_IA,2005-06-09 06:52:00,144,"My brother and I fished out of Ballantyne's Indian Lake Lodge several years ago. We took our 9 and 11 year old nieces along and allowed them to choose whether to fish or stay at the lodge. We did take them for shore lunches and long boat rides and fishing when they wanted. We caught a reasonable number of Walleyes. The almost last fish of the trip was a small Walleye that the youngest girl hooked. She got tired of trying to wind it in. You guessed it, a musky had taken the Walleye. She handed the ultrlight spinning rod to me (4 pound test line). We played the musky, it would let go, jiggle the walleye, musky would grab it again, play the musky, eventually got the musky (estimated 9 pounds up to the side of the boat. Eventually, the line cut off. We knew there would be no topper for that so we went back to the cabin. Laura reported it to the camp so she had the credit for catching and releasing the fish. Ballantyne's had outstanding cabins. It is the nicest resort I have stayed in. It had a circular pool in back, felt great after fishing in late July or early August. Indian Lake is where we had our best fishing-there are a number of lakes in the chain. The area is more developed than I like and there may be more than one boat at a ""hot spot"", but its still Canada. If I had my druthers, I like to fish with no other boats or only a few. (If you catch a big one, its nice to have an admirer before you release the fish!)"
