549302,Bearcat,2005-06-15 08:42:00,209,There are 7 of us going up near Dryden in Sept. We are traveling in an Expedition and would like to tow an enclosed trailer so we can keep gear out of weather and keep our stuff locked up. Any suggestions as to where we might rent one (besides U-haul-their stuff is pretty run down)? We will be coming from SW OH....Thanks
