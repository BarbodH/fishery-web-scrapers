549151,boomersooner,2005-06-13 13:22:00,3,We fished whitefish bay from sat 4th thru sat the 11th between turtle portage and timber island. Rained every day and cool weather. Caught 98 northern 30 bass 1 musky 0 walleye. All in All a good trip. But wont be going back to that area looking for walleye. Good luck everyone.

Checked with one of the locals and they said you worked for the Mottlong Boys.I am on an island off the north end of Little Russel.. Need to have a cup of coffee some time, Tom Giles Trout Scout"

We visit Sabaskong Bay in August and sometimes we portage through for a day of fishing on Whitefish Bay. Its been hit or miss if the conveyer is working or broken when we visit."

549295,Guest,2005-06-15 07:18:00,0,We did not use the portage. But it looked like it was in good condition. The lodge owner said their is a boat and motor size limit. I dont know if it is in use or not. good luck.
