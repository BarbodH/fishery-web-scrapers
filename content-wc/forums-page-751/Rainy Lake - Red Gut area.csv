549410,Guest,2005-06-17 09:10:00,0,I was there the first week in June and the water was high and still rising. I have been fishing that area for 15 yrs and have never seen the lake so stained and with so much current. The waterfalls woure pouring in dingy reddish brown water and you could not see your lure 2 feet deep. It made the fishing sporadic but hopefully it has cleared up since.
