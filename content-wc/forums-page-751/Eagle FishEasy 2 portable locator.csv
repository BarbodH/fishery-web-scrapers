549206,Guest,2005-06-14 06:57:00,0,"It will usually last the better part of the week even if run alot. But I always take 8 more, as at least once I had to replace the batteries by week's end. If weight is a concern and you can't take spares just try to conserve the unit and be mindful that you may not get thru an entire wk............"

549369,515,2005-06-16 07:07:00,254,I have the same rechargable set-up and it works great. When I do my annual fly-in trip I take and extra set of D cells and the bracket just in case. My rechargable has always made it thru the week though. Nice to have back up just in case. Mike
