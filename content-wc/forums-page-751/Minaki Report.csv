549079,Reels,2005-06-12 06:54:00,2876,"Well, back from another week in Minaki. Mother nature through us a curve ball. We had a cold front move in the day after we got there, and they opened the dams in Kenora, raising the water at least two feet over five days. This made things challenging. It totally through off the small mouth, but we still managed to get some, but not near the numbers Don saw the week before. Walleyes are very scattered, hanging in 25-35' of water. We had a hard time getting fish for shore lunch as over 95% were under the slot. We did manage to get lunch though. Current seemed to be the ticket, either in the river or little sand the walleyes were hanging. Jigs and minnows or spinner rigs seemed to work best, but night crawlers seemed to get the bigger fish. Go figure... We did have a lot of 4"" shad spit up in the live well, as the fished were stuffed with them. We never did find the 20""+ year class. We had zero luck on big sand for the walleyes, unless we caught it casting for smallies. We did boat some nice muskies and northerns casting for smallies. Huskie Jerks seemed to be the ticket. We boated a montser 53"" muskie caught on a sninner rig with a crawler. She was photo'ed, and was released healthy. Other muskies were 38,36,and a few 30's. Biggest Northern was 42"" boated with a jig and minnow by sugar loaf. Water levels stabled Thursday and the Minaki bite was on, catching over 100 walleyes a day, but almost all being dinks. Fun anyway, after sitting in cold rain for four days. WIth all the *****ing about the slot, it looks like the MNR hit the size limit right on the head. Livewells would be filled with the dinks if the old limit was in place. Yes, we had to work harder to catch walleyes for lunch, but it was doable. Take care, and tight lines! <{{}}><"
549081,Guest,2005-06-12 07:37:00,0,"Reels, Thanks for the report. I'm heading up Thursday...looks like the weather is improving so I'll have you covered on the smallies! Dinky Walleye.....imagine that....THANK YOU MNR!"
549084,Reels,2005-06-12 08:16:00,2876,"Have a great time! the water should be more stable when you get there. It was still running off land when we left. The bay by your place is loaded with huge northerns. Not sure why they are there, the wind was not blowing that way, maybe just a stop on the way to big sand. <{{}}><"
549090,Guest,2005-06-12 11:02:00,0,"Reels...thanks for the info. I caught a 46 inch pike off the dock last year. Spoke to my father this morning (he stays up there all summer), he said they have been catching walleye just outside of West Bay up on Big Sand and just to the west of Big Sand Beach so they must be moving in up there, he also said slot fish were tough to find. The weather foreacast looks good for next week so things should be in good shape. Never really had any issues fishing rising water up there for smallmouth.....are you sure you weren't just fishing immediate post spawn?....I guess a drastic change like that could make a difference but I've always been more worried about water temp than water fluctuations up there as it seems like flucuating water levels are always an issue. I've always had much better luck fishing rising water vs. falling water levels on that system."
549097,Guest,2005-06-12 13:05:00,0,"We've been going to Minaki for the past 20 years or so. Usually spend 2 weeks most years, but have been there for 3 weeks or so over the past 8 years. Fish mostly for smallies, northern and musky, but like to get an occassional walleye or crappie, especially if we are tired! I've noticed that the smallie bite is affected to a large degree when the water is rising quickly or falling quickly at Minaki. However, severe cold fronts seem to impact them more, driving the majority of them into deeper water, even if they have started to move onto the beds. Of course river smallies seem less affected by rising water and cold fronts, so that's why we head south of Minaki in these cases. We fish the river down south between the Big Stretch and the Indian Reservation, for nice big chunky smallies when a lot of other places up north have slowed down. We work the islands on the east side, and the shoreline on the west side for some nice action. We've even fished the lake that is between the river and Big Gunn Lake, had some outstanding smallie action there! I'm betting the smallie spawn has another 2 weeks or so before it really gets in full gear. I'm basing my info on water temps and reports from friend that just fished smallies on LOW, Rainy, and Catastrophe Lake (on the way to Minaki). By the way, there are some very nice walleye and smallies in Catastrophe, that don't see much fishing pressure. Just be careful because there is a ridge of rocks running down the center of the lake about a foot below the surface--guess that's why they call it Catastrophe. Chuck for IL"
549100,Reels,2005-06-12 14:16:00,2876,"Thanks for the insite on the bass guys, I am more a walleye nut, but will cast a few hours for bass up there. This was my 19th year for me. Like you, a lot of years twice a year. We did fish the river some, that is were we boated the 53"" muskie. We fished mostly for walleyes south looking for bigger fish. I suspect the rising water with the cold front moved the bass deeper. It was 75 friday when we got there, and dropped to 52 and stayed there most of the week. <{{}}><"
549106,Guest,2005-06-12 18:44:00,0,"Hey Reel, Where were you fishing for walleye down south of Minaki? We usually give the southern end of Big Gunn a try, down by the power lines or the west shoreline about a mile above the powerlines. There is also a good island on the east side of Big Gunn that has some good hard bottom points on it that usually will have some bigger walleye. We've only tried for walleye once or twice over the years, down around the mud flats where the Big Gunn part of the river connects with the main part of the river. We caught a few, but nothing to brag about... So just curious... Chuck"
549107,Guest,2005-06-12 18:52:00,0,"Reels, I forgot, we also catch some nice walleye at the small island just before going into the Black Sturgeon River. There are some nice weed beds on the east and west points of the island, and you can also cast to the banks on the island and get them on Shad Raps. By the way, the cove the Black Sturgeon River dumps into is usually loaded with nice smallies and northern. We've spent many a long day just going around and around this cove, hammering the smallies and northern. On a calm day, the top water action along the east shallow end of this cove can be a real blast for smallies. We always spend several afternoons with Chug Bugs and Pop-R's that way. Chuck"
549108,Reels,2005-06-12 19:23:00,2876,"Hey Chuck, We fished the power lines, but the wind was howling a bit, so we went to the point just south of Big North and did real well there. Once we found the spot on the spot, pulled about 40 walleyes off the point in about 18'. We also caught some big northerns in Gun at the mouth of Duck bay, and a few spots farther south. Also Pistol had some nice northerns too. (30-35"") Sounds crazy, but we put 184 miles on according to the GPS, but the bite was so goofy, we gunned and run looking for fish. Hard to find a spot that was consistant. We fished pretty hard fishing about 14 hours a day, with the exception of Sunday due to the rain. We hung it up after about 2:00 and had the Minaki series of poker championship! <{{}}><"
549289,Guest,2005-06-15 07:08:00,0,"Slim & Others, Here are a few other places where we have picked up nice walleye North of Minaki: Little Sand - Duck Reef comes up out of 28 feet of water to about 11 feet. Check the transition between the mud bottom and rock reef for walleye on sonar. Use Jig and leeches. Sometimes they will be sitting right on top of the reef, especially early in the morning or late in the day. (The shoreline east of the reef is great for some nice northern and musky, as well as the top of the reef.) Little Sand - The point just south-east of Duck Reef. Check the point from 18 feet to 22 feet. Very snaggy, but can be worked with jigs and leeches. We've caught some very big walleye here for the past several years. Little Sand - Strawberry Island. Jig from 24 to 18 feet with leeches. Snaggy but can be jigged. Alternatively you can rig with bottom bouncers and leech leader. Nice walleye at times. Big Sand - Check the Sand Beach south of St. Johns Island, or the west side of St. Johns Island for walleye on the sonar. Only fish it if you mark walleye. Often you will mark smallmouth instead of walleye. Big Sand - The east side of Deadman's Island can be very good at times. Look between 18 and 24 feet of water for walleye. Sometimes they will be in the saddle between the North end of Deadmans Island and the western point coming from Deadman's Bay. Big Sand - The South-eastern point coming off of Pine Island has provided some +24"" walleye over the years. Look for the walleye to be feeding in between the humps on this point. The humps rise about 2 to 4 feet off the bottom, but can be difficult to locate and fish if there is much wind. Use a Linde Rig or jigs with leeches or crawlers. We will be in Minaki June 25 to July 2, then on to Rainy from July 2 to July 9. Good Luck! Chuck from IL"
549297,hoowaa,2005-06-15 07:30:00,6,"Wow !! Chuck and other's I must say all of these tips are most appreciated - very unselfish of each and every one of you - hat's off. have fished Minaki a few times in the past with moderate to limited success. Me and 2 good friends are heading to Paradise II from Winnipeg this Friday til Sunday (Father's Day) and I will be trying out many if not all of the tips you have been kind enough to share. The one location I have always had success (mid July time frame) is in the Channel between Roughrock and Little Sand back-trolling in the heavier current areas trying to keep steady so's to stay in place or just barely making forward progress if you follow me. The fish I have caught here are almost always perfect eating size. Keep those tips coming folks and when I return I'll do my best to let you all know what I tried and what worked and give credit where credit is due. Thanks again, Hoowaa !!"
549304,Guest,2005-06-15 08:58:00,0,Don't overlook Roughrock as a walleye lake!
549318,Guest,2005-06-15 11:40:00,0,"Yes, Rough Rock is a good walleye lake, but we usually go there more for the musky and smallies. If you go to the west side of the lake (immediate left after swinging out around the two left-hand bouys [in the lower part of the lake]), there are a series of points on the south side that can be worked for walleye. Use jigs and leeches, or jigs and crawlers on these points because they are very snaggy. Slip bobbers will also work if you can drift them in deeper water. You can also often cast up and down the length of the points with deeper diving shad raps and get walleye that way. There are some nice humps that come up on the northern shoreline(same lower-west part of the lake), the best comes up to about 6' or so (right where the 'G' is on the Canadian topo map). We've caught a some nice walleye most years on top of this hump in 6' of water, just under the boat with leeches and jigs. However, we have never had any success in casting around this hump with crankbaits, except for small northern and a few bass. If you go all the way to the east side of the lower lake, there is a 'fly-in' resort with a large mud flat way out in front of it. You can catch walleye in 16' - 20' on the edge of the mud flat. If they are not there, then head in shallower until you find the edge of the weedline and fish it. [By the way, you can sometimes find crappie on this weedline, especially the outer edge (or in the weeds if they are not to thick). We use yellow, white or gray 2"" twister tails on a jig fished under a bobber for crappie. You will occassionally get a nice walleye that way too, if the northern don't bite you off first!] Have fun! Chuck from IL"
549321,Guest,2005-06-15 12:10:00,0,"Tahnks for all the honest posts, they are much appreciated. For those of you who fish Roughrock, how is the navigation through that area? Does a guy need to be concerned for rocks and such. I have never been in that area at all so I am unfamiliar with it. I would hate to crash a rock up there. Thanks, Slim"

549323,Guest,2005-06-15 12:31:00,0,"Yes, you need to be careful in Rough Rock, especially in the upper part(North part) of the lake. The north end of the upper part of the lake has several large boulders that are just under water and are not shown on any map (even the light yellow Canadian topo maps and the Great Lakes West Navionics XL3 GPS maps.) Several years ago, there were 2 or 3 fly in outposts up there, that always had these rocks marked with jug bouys. However they are not up there any more, so the bouys have long since disappeared. Over the years, I think we've seen a dozen musky fishermen loose lower units in the upper end(northern part) of Rough Rock. That's a long way to come back to Minaki on a kicker motor! [It's a great place to fish musky, but you need to be careful, even manuevering in what you think is open water in that area. The area is dotted with lots and lots of small islands and bigger rock piles, saddles, and nice points. Not what I would call good walleye fishing area, but definately good Musky area.] You should still have a decent map of the area, even if you are only fishing the lower (southern) part of the lake. It can get tricky manuevering around the bouys on the lower west part of the lake, and the north side of the lower east end of the lake. Other areas in the lower part of the lake aren't too bad, except at the entrance to Rough Rock from the narrows (around the two islands you come to as you enter). We haven't ventured into the channel going to the dam in several years. It is very shallow in many places and very-very swift in a normal year, and will be worse now with the rapid release they have going on. I suggest not even going into the channel leading to the dam (there were signs on the shoreline the last time we were there), the current will be about 3 times swifter than what will be going thru the narrows leading into Rough Rock, and there is usually white water anyway. Chuck from IL"
549325,Guest,2005-06-15 12:49:00,0,"The channel leading from Little Sand into Rough Rock used to be very very good for consistent and nice size walleye. However, we've noticed a big down-turn over the past 4 years or so, since they have been controlling the water level a little higher and have been letting a lot of water out of the dam. Over this time, the current has been very heavy, and the walleye seemed to have moved out of the area. You can still catch a few, especially around current breaks or eddys, but not like in the past. We used to have a 'honey hole' in the narrows, where 2 guys could easily go thru 2# of medium sized leeches in an afternoon, catching walleye after walleye on almost every cast. However it is gone now that the current is faster and the water is up. (We even went looking for it in August of last year, and the water was still too swift...) We have been able to catch a fair number of walleye off the islands at the north arm of the narrows, just to your left(west) before you enter Rough Rock. However, it doesn't seem to even be as good as it was several years ago. The areas around the island is great for mushy though! Chuck from IL"
549329,Guest,2005-06-15 13:12:00,0,I second what Chuck says!
549350,Guest,2005-06-15 20:56:00,0,"Wow you guys are amazing with all this info. I will be fishing with Slim, As some of you know it will be my son and myselfs first time on Minaki. The information you have given us is greatly appreciated. We will be fishing in a Smokercraft Ultima 175 if you see us, stop by and say Hello. Thanks again"
549136,Reels,2005-06-13 10:51:00,2876,"I agree, last few years, we had trouble catching fish under the slot. So, those fish have to be somewhere. I am guessing with the rising water and the cold front, it had the pigs suspended. Hatrack, Whiskey, Burnt, and sugar loaf all had fish on them. At the begining of the week, they were not there, but towards the end they moved in. So, the fish are on the migrate up north. Didn't matter if you jigged or bottom bounced. The fish were so scattered. I liked the spinners because we could cover more water quickly. <{{}}><"
549152,Mille Lacs Guy,2005-06-13 13:29:00,401,Where can you find the best map of Minaki online? I printed off the map from Paradise Cove's website and it is a decent map but I'm curious if there is a better map.
549158,Guest,2005-06-13 15:20:00,0,Go to Google maps...type in Minaki and get the satelite view....gives you a good birds eye view of the area.
549159,IaCraig,2005-06-13 15:21:00,434,"Reels, No fair getting me all excited when I have another month to wait yet. Slim, I agree with you, except last year there were some days that we picked up quite a few dinks while doing the evening troll. (fish not much bigger than the crank baits). Thanks for the reports ! IaCraig"
549223,Guest,2005-06-14 09:47:00,0,"Reels: Thanks for the info. We have usually done well at Burnt as well. Also, Buds buoy, the SE corner of Harbour Isl., Echo, the Sand Beach, and Wildedge has its time and place. Can I ask what side or how do you fish sugarloaf or Whiskey? I have never fished either area. Thanks for your help, Slim"
549225,Guest,2005-06-14 09:53:00,0,slim.......won't be hard figuring out how to fish Sugarloaf. You can barely get between Sugarloaf and Harbour Islands from all the lodge boats sitting in the same spot every day.
549231,Reels,2005-06-14 10:36:00,2876,"Aaron is right, it will be easy to find, but reservations are down this year at the paradise from what I heard. Hopefully won't be as crowded. Whisky you want to fish the point off the NE end. It has a slope that goes from 20-40 at a fairly slow taper. Best thing to do on that spot is drive slow and try to mark fish. If you mark them, stay, if you don't, move on. Don't be afraid to toss a marker, as the fish sometimes will school up tight on the point. It saves a lot of time drifting. Keep in mind though, it is also a flag that attracts other fishermen. Aaron, that must have been your dad I saw fishing by west bay. I didn't drive by to check it out, because there were only three boats on Big sand that I saw. I would have felt pretty stupid and guilty fishing on top of another boat when it is so quiet and peacefull. It was nice up there, as most people had the same mindset. Only time we fished by another boat was when Duane from Paradise pulled up to the hatrack, and saw us catching fish. Hats off to him, he did not crowd in the small spot on the spot. <{{}}><"
549233,Guest,2005-06-14 10:44:00,0,"Reels...all these years I've been going up there I have never sat there between Harbour and Sugarloaf and fished for Walleye. I feel kind of bad for Otto when he is up there....having all those boats parked right off the end of his dock all day long. I'm even more surprised people don't come back farther in the bay fishing for walleye...I can catch a limit of walleye right off our dock (red a-frames in the SW side of the bay) with a slip bobber and nightcrawlers just about any evening. Leaving Thursday morning......the weather is looking sunny and warm, the smallies should be in a feeding frenzy...CANT WAIT!"

549132,Guest,2005-06-13 09:39:00,0,"Reels and Others: Thanks for the updates. Our group leaves Saturday (18th) for 6 days of fun. I must admit I am really surprised to hear about the small fish. Usually the problem for us has been finding them small enough in the past. We have been going the last 5 years and have seldon ever caught many or any 'dinks'. I wonder what is different with the bite now. Reels, if you don't mind what areas were you in. We are usually spend a lot of time on the East half of Little Sand and up on big sand. We have also done well at the powerlines which you spoke of. Do you think it was weather? How warm was the water? Thanks for all of your help. Our group does not have many serious fisherman and two new guys are going who are good fisherman but have never been there so I try to compile some info ahead of time to make fishing more enjoyable for everyone. Thanks for all of your help,"
