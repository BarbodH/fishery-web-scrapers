549125,Sam,2005-06-13 08:14:00,16,"I have been there three times and had an great time. Each time the walleye average seems to be getting bigger. Three years ago, most were over their 18 inch shore lunch limit. We also caught 4 pike over 40"" with the biggest being 48""."
549127,phishfearme,2005-06-13 08:30:00,1242,"here's a report i sent to a friend who was considering kesagami a few years ago. we accessed kesagami from partridge lake (the only othe LUP for kesagami) in 2000. it'll give you a good idean of what the lake is like. i don't think the lodge permits live bait and i think you have to have a guide. good luck, phish we started our week by being stuck in the west way motel in cochrane for an extra night due to an incredible SNOW STORM. all of the canada day weekend festivities were cancelled. the weather didn't get much better from there - the whole week. we called it our ""white week"" - white snow and white caps. we were only really able to fish kesagami friday and saturday when we finally saw some sunshine and the white caps took a pause. this was the worst weather we've had in over 20 of doing these trips. when we could fish kesagami, we did however catch some nice fish - although they were very difficult to find. we got a 43 and a 42"" pike followed by a 36, 34 and two 32's. (NOTE THAT OF THESE 6 FISH, 4 WERE CAUGHT ON WORMS FISHING FOR WALLEYE - WITH NO LEADERS - JUST DUMB LUCK!) but thats about it for pike - 6 people only caught about 20-25 all week - including partridge pike. we caught a pretty good number of walleye - including a 27"" whopper - but we had to revert to worms - lures were worthless with the exception of friday and saturday when the sun came out, then the fish could see the lures. water clarity in kesagami was about 6"" - probably due the constant storms and the shallowness of the lake. the people in partridge the two weeks before us had bad storms and poor visibility also. so - some observations: there was a constant stream of freighter canoes from the lodge hitting the same spots over and over again. these spots are marked with bouys and are usually rock bars or other structure/cover. one of our guys likened it to a shotgun start in golf where a large group starts at different holes at the same time and after some time moves to the next hole. it seems like they were all concentrating on pike and catching none - probably for the visibilty reason i mentioned earlier. we were surprised to see how flat, featureless and shallow this lake was. sometimes we'd stumble over a school of walleye - usually mixed with a few pike - and wonder why they were there - 3-4 ft., flat bottom and minimal if any weeds. they weren't there long though as returning to these spots were fruitless. i guess the fish have to be somewhere! so with so few ""structured"" areas in the lake and with essentially all of them marked and hit multiple times each day, we (and the lodge people) had a hard time catching many fish. we found fish in un-bouyed areas but it took tons of trolling to find anything interesting. the island to the south of the gardiner boat cach produced three large pike and the 27"" walleye and a good number of other walleye. it was also THE most popular spot for the lodge freighter canoes - rarely were we there by ourselves. there's about 8 bouys around the island and towards the point to the east. the marker bouys are also there for motor protection but they also are the only reefs/structure. the points to the east of the edgar lake inlet produced good walleye and a few pike but only for friday afternoon. fishing there saturday produced little. so - i hope this gives you some idea of our ""interesting"" week. i suggest you ask the lodge for some references who've been at the lodge recently. the two groups we chatted with weren't all that happy but i'm sure the weather played a role."
549150,Sam,2005-06-13 13:18:00,16,"The lake is almost always rough. So you will get wet most days. I believe thats why they have those freighter conoe's that seemed to bother you. They don't allow live bait. But I have never needed it. Using a jig and Sassy Shad or twister tail has worked fine for us. We fish for the Walleye's until it's time for lunch and I'm sure we have never caught less than 20 or so each, on any morning. I have fished many lakes with more pike. But never one that had as many 35"" and larger fish."
549168,Guest,2005-06-13 18:13:00,0,"I have been to Kesagami 6 times, however the last time I was there was back in the early 90s or late 80s (the last year Jerry owned it). We stopped going because the new owners started imposing all sort of rules. Don't get me wrong I am all in favor of catch and release, but I prefer to fish a lake where I can use a net and not have to modify all of my tackle. That being said Kesagami is an awesome fishery. If you fish for walleye all day you are likely to catch 50-100. From what I remember the walleye size was not great, but the quantity of fish more than made up for that. We either would jig or troll with shad raps. As for pike, there is no better lake in the world! If you are looking to catch a huge pike this is the place to do it. The lake averages like 10ft (no joke) and is filled with large bays. Cast a Johnson Silver Minnow with a twister tail into the reeds and hang on. The boats are about 21', which gives you enough room to spread out and tackle the waves when it gets windy. I have been out there during storms and you would swear your in in the middle of the ocean. Hope you have a good time. Please post when you get back, I am interested to hear if it is anything like it was 15 years ago."
