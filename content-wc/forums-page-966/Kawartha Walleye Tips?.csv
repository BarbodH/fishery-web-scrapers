(Peterborough, Ontario.)I am mostly a bass fisherman, and a musky fisherman in the fall. I plan on doing some walleye fishing this spring since walleye season opens before musky and bass. I know where to find bass and musky, but I have no idea where the walleye are in the lakes around my cottage. We catch walleye sometimes at dusk, but I think we are just lucky, more than tactical. The lakes we fish are typically 10-20 ft deep, with the odd 30ft spot. Lots of weeds and rock shoals. Any tips???Tackle/bait???"

But the fish are still there. Find a good hydrographic map and give it a good once over. You will still find them on shoals and along typical structure, but just deeper than before. On some lakes ( Buckhorn etc.) that don't have alot of deeper water you may find them buried in weed beds during the day. I think that the walleye there have adapted to being more proficient night hunters and near shoals and river mouths would be good night-time locales. It is expected that within a few years the bass and musky poulations will be at all time highs, so there may be a silver lining to the clouds."
519519,Guest,2002-04-23 15:27:00,0,Try jigging with worms. I know a guy who lives on Pigeon lk catches a lot of walleye that way. Find goog structure and look at the pros pointers on this web site they are great.
519520,Guest,2002-04-24 07:15:00,0,"I've fished Pigeon Lake over 20 times and have found walleye in all the classic spots. It's been tougher the last several years and this has forced us to try other waters outside of the Kawarthas area. But, I know these tactics have worked and continue to work for us everytime we go there. Try mid-lake rock humps in 10-16 ft. of water (drag a worm and jig), on the edges of visible rock piles where it drops to 30-40 ft. of water (vertical jig with worm or leech), mid-day 7 - 10 feet of water in pencil reeds and coontail (thrash a bucktail jig), on the edge of coontail clumps (small in-line spinner), casting crankbaits on weedflats at night (Hot-n-Tot, Shad Rap...this gets the big 'eyes), trolling shallow rock spines at night with 5""+ Rapalas. Also try the breakline from shallow flats into the deeper lake basin....the line will be about 13 - 16 ft...drift this with a crawler harness or bottom-bouncer and Phelps jig with full 'crawler. Deadly !!!!Hope this helps."
519521,Guest,2002-04-24 20:16:00,0,Bigfish I'm curious as to why you predict an all time high for certain fish species in our area coming soon?
