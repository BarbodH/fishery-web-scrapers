519543,Guest,2002-04-24 11:41:00,0,I think you can only get the rehab-pass during the week 8- 4:30! Your best bet is to go through when it is fairly busy i beleive anyways. Anybody that has been crossing the fort frances customs latley? Please let us know how things went. We are going with a group of 6 and everybody has had a dui in the past some as recent as 8 yrs ago to 22yrs ago. But i wont worry about that until the day we go never had a problem in the past. If they dont let us in the resort will be losing about $3200 big ones that week.

Last year my buddy admitted a 23 year old dui (expunged by the way)on friday afternoon at approximately 3pm and they said he could come back on Monday morning to try for the exemption. Well, we stayed in a frieking hotel in New York for the weekend and after paying his fee we finally got into Canada on Monday afternoon. Point being, there was no one on duty capable of making that decision late friday afternoon, much less on the weekend, at least where we were crossing, i.e., Ogdensburg, NY. Good luck."
