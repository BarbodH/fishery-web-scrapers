519512,gammon,2002-04-22 19:28:00,9,I have hunted there during the fall for moose. some of my partners fished in the area (three of them caught about twelve pikes in a two hour period between three and five thirty in the evening using spoons). It is a very remote area. The pike just about jumped out of the water trying to get to my moose in the canoe.(Hanging over the sidetrailing blood probably). There are some good prickle(walleye) in the main river system (Ogoki river) Bring a good winter jacket You'll need it for those cool summer nights.Hope this help
519513,Guest,2002-04-26 05:17:00,0,"I have fished O'Sullivan/Superb twice. Don't know much about the main lake of O'Sullivan as we have spent more time on the portion that connects with Superb. The first time (late July), we canoed across O'Sullivan/Superb and then down the Little Current River (its not on the Ogoki as the last message said). On Superb Lake, near where the Little Current leaves, we caught seven or eight nice walleye in two hours while paddling the canoes with Hot-n-Tots trailing. Went back a few years later in mid-June with our own boat and fished/camped for three days in the same part of the lake. Jigged and crawler harnessed most of that trip. Didn't catch a lot of eyes, but my brother did manage to land a 29 incher (his biggest to date). O-Sullivan/Superb is a beautiful lake and we saw lots of wildlife including several otters near the river. Have fun."
