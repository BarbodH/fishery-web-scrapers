519496,Guest,2002-04-22 14:00:00,0,"Can anyone provide some insight on crossing the border at Fort Francis on the Friday before walleye opener? We'll be driving from Iowa and should be crossing sometime around 3 in the afternoon. To tie in with some of the other threads, none of us have DWIs, we love Canadian beer, we respect Canadians and all of their laws, and we're hoping for ice out before we get there (since we're flying north of Red Lake on opener). Thanks in advance. Terry"

519498,Guest,2002-04-22 14:41:00,0,I guess I should have been precise in my query. We have some ability to vary our arrival time on Friday. Does anyone have any advice/experience on crossing the border on that day? Thanks again. Terry
519499,Guest,2002-04-22 15:43:00,0,"if your flyin' in, won't you be going via Crane Lake for the customs check on the water? If not the trip thru Ft Frances is a bit more busy on that day. 3 pm is not a good time to go thru the border check. Bring your beer if you want. (1 unit = 1 - 24 pack of 12oz, or 1 liter of spirits.) Max allowed per person of age is 1 unit. Bring your smokes if you want but don't bring too much. Can only have what you will smoke. I don't know the per person max. Tell them exactly how many packs of cigs or how many cigars you have.Don't fret the border guys / gals if your clean, they are just doing their jobs to secure their country.guide#7 out"
519500,Guest,2002-04-23 07:03:00,0,"I've been across the border many times and never really had any complaints about the people just doing their jobs--only been searched once and since I was honest, there weren't any problems. I haven't ever crossed on the day before opener, however. Thanks for the advice.Terry"
519502,Guest,2002-04-23 09:27:00,0,"I hear that a wait of one to three hours is to be expected. if the weather forecast if bad, then a wait of one hour. Good weather? Then three hours. Have some good fishing and dress warmly."
519501,Guest,2002-04-23 20:41:00,0,Friday afternoon is usually not bad. Most of the resorts have Saturday to Saturday arrivals and departures. Plan to go across between 1pm and 3 pm or after 7PM and you shoud breeze right through. We gennerally go up Friday evening after work and cross about 8 pm and have no wait. They just opened a 4 lane customs station so I hope that will solve some of the problem for weekends.
519503,Guest,2002-04-25 10:27:00,0,"Don't worry about the ice, it will be long gone. As to crossing the border rather than going thru International Falls, you may want to enter Canada at the Baudette,MN/Rainy River, ON crossing. Line ups aren't nearly as bad there. Just one note for your border crossing, minnows or leeches can not be brought into Canada and nightcrawlers(worms) must be in an artificial bedding rather than soil. Be sure to check up on the Ontario Sportfishing Regulations as well.Enjoy your trip."
