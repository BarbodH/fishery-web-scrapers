519515,Guest,2002-04-23 19:49:00,0,"Caught my biggest northerns in Sept. Like that time of year>trees are turning and the fishing is usually very good. The weather can really suck. Froze my rump off and also have roasted that time of year.ALL the biggert northers came on spoons or crankbaits > down the lake.Poplar narrows, Hungry narrows, Manatoba point, Stoney point and Windago point. 48"" was the biggest and many 40-44"". With the ""slot"" on northerns, you should see an improvement in the quality of fish in the next couple of years."

Those ruffed grouse make for some mighty fine eating! Don't overlook places much closer to camp for the big walleye and northern, i.e. Steamboat Narrows. Many big walleye are caught at the old railroad bridge less than a mile from camp that time of year. Talk to the owners, Gary & Patty, Gary does a lot of guiding, he can find'em, he just can't catch'em !!P.S. That's a little bit of humor GB!!"
