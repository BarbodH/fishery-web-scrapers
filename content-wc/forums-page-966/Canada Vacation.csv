519409,Mal,2002-04-19 16:30:00,55,I make two to three trips to Ontario during the year. Someone told me the other day that border crossings will now require a Passport. Does anyone know the answer?? Will also try to contact the MNR but may get a quicker answer when posted here!!!

519411,bphunger,2002-04-19 19:17:00,28,You do not need a passport to cross the boarder but you should be prepared with photo ID. A passport is a good photo ID but a drivers license works well too. If you use the drivers license then have a birth certificate too. The idea is to show citizenship not just place of residence. This goes for both into Canada and back to the US. No point in calling any governemnt office as the last I heard they were out on strike. Have a great trip.

The MNR cannot help you with any federal matter, however the prior post was correct. Bring as much ID as you have. A passport is not mandatory, it just makes things easier."
519413,Mal,2002-04-20 04:09:00,55,Thanks for the response. I have plenty of ID when I cross anyway. Last year I just happen to have another ID and it really made a difference. I had to renew my teaching certificate which includes fingerprints sent to the BCI and I had that official response sheet with me at the time. I showed that along with the other ID and they stopped the search right then and there and sent me on my way. It won't work this year (being a year old) and thought a passport might offer the same information.

This was crossing going to British Columbia and not Ontario. Please let me know if you find out more info about Ontario. thanx."
