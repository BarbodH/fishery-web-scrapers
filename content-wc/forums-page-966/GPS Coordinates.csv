I'm looking for a specific lake in Quebec, but am also interested in obtaining coordinates for some Ontario lakes. Any information on where I may obtain GPS coordinates for Canadian lakes would be appreciated. Thanks."
519385,Guest,2002-04-18 20:20:00,0,"Try this site http://toporama.ctis.nrcan.gc.ca. I played with it a few times and you even get coordinates on the lake where you click.I am no expert, but found it and am learning my way around it. Good Luck...........RocFish"
519386,Guest,2002-04-19 05:59:00,0,That's the one I was looking for....thanks very much.
519387,Dave S,2002-04-19 13:28:00,314,When I zoom in it shows a number of cross hatched locations. Does it only give the location of the indicated cross marked points? I can see a lower bar numerically changing but not sure how the numerical change relates to the longitudinal / latitude .
519388,Guest,2002-04-22 20:26:00,0,"Dave,I can't answer your question. I just found another site that may help. Try www.gpsnuts.com and click on Canadian Digest. Looks like one could spend a week looking at the various choices.Good Luck.....RocFish"

519389,Guest,2002-04-23 14:17:00,0,"I spent some time on the site--the cross hatches are hazards (rocks, etc...). You should be able to get a rough idea of the latitude and longitude coordinates by going to the 1:50,000 scale map that you wish to use and then clicking on the spot on that map whose coordinates you are interested in. They will appear in the bottom boxes of the screen. You will need to convert their decimal numbers to minutes and seconds by multiplying them by 60 (60 minutes in a degree). For example, 51.82 degrees converts to 51 degrees and 49.2 minutes, which converts to 51 degrees, 49 minutes, 20 seconds. Be aware, the maps are large scale so don't expect too much precision. Enjoy. It is a great site."
519390,Dave S,2002-04-23 22:08:00,314,"Worldly Traveler - Thanks for offering an explaination on what the cross- hatches represent. Goodness, looks like many lakes are like ""Mine Fields"" if that is the case. :) As you say the maps are large scale so the accuracy one can obtain is rather limited. Your explanation of the numbers on the bar below the map being longitude and latitude measurements in decimal degrees makes sense."
519392,Guest,2002-04-25 10:23:00,0,Go to a good map company like Canadian/US map and the map will show coordiantes you figure out and can use to plug into your GPS that will allow you to get you where you want to navigate. I made a route from such a map in Green Bay of a 25 mile long lake(Northern Lights Lake) in Ont. with several dog-legs and blind bays. Worked out well for me. I refined the coordiates on the way.
