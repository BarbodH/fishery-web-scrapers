519491,Walleye Wacker,2002-04-22 13:28:00,6,Just A Tip: We have been haveing good luck useing the Drop Shot Rig with crawlers or shiners fishing below dams on the Missisippi. Also works great below wing dams. Best luck with 1/2 oz sinker and bait rig 6 to 10 in above sinker..fish it slow and keep line tight for subtle bite..Good Luck

519493,Walleye Wacker,2002-04-23 05:38:00,6,The Drop Shot is rigged so the bait is horizantal to the bottom instead of hanging limp at the same angle the sinker is. I think you can get a better feel of the bite this way. I use 6lb for my line and 2lb for my sinker this saves a lot of rigs because sinkers are cheap and total reties cost fishing time. I pre tie extra weights with a snap swivel thus more water time. In reality both rigs are very effective but I do think the horizantial bait is a advantage for feel and presentation....catch and release
