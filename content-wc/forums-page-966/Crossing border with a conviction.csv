I basically lied when asked about a friend who was having an affair. I didn't feel like it was the military's business who was sleeping with whom and I lied. Well, I was convicted of a false document charge. There is no civilian charge associated with this and my brother who is a cop said I should have no problem crossing the border. However, I want to do things legally and was wondering what I should do. Is this something that will keep me from crossing? It happened 4 years ago and I have nothing else on my record, not even a DUI. Any help would be greatly appreciated"
519438,outdoor fanatic,2002-04-21 19:07:00,90,That's a good question. I'm not sure how they would handle that. I'm assuming that the conviction is only a misdemeanor. Any lawyers out there that can handle that one?

Note it says crime and not felony or misdemeanor. I do not know the answer to your question as to whether a military code violation would be considered a crime in Canada. There is an information packet on the Canadian Government's website for ""Rehabilitation for Person Who Are Inadmissible to Canada Because of Past Criminal Activity."" While that packet does not answer your question, you might be able to get a phone number or e-mail address to contact. In addition, check out the witchbay.com site in the ""Gabbin with Gail"" section. She put up a post on crossing the border with a DUI and included a name and phone number for a guy in International Falls to call with questions. Good luck."

Try asking a cop buddy to pull your name up and see if the old military record is there. Hmmm...that means OJ can come here and you can't? Thats silly."
