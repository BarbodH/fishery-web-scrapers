519524,Jim,2002-04-23 10:48:00,238,"Hey Fred, (or anyone who has a good Lake St. Joe story!)I emailed you a few times last year about your Lake St. Joe trip. Are you going again this year? When? I have a group of buddies going up July 9 - 13. I will be going from August 3 - 8. I can't wait. Have you ever gone this late before? Have any more Lake St. Joe stories?Last year was our best year yet. Didn't have to travel much either. Soules Bay and the islands to the north of the mouth of Soules were great for us. Also the islands going into Peddlar Path were awesome. Did all our fishing in less than 8 feet of water. Most were caught in 4 feet. If we didn't have a fish every 1-2 minutes, it was slow. Biggest walleye was still only 25 inches (I am still looking for a hog there). Northern was 38 inches. This is the first year we actually fished for northerns. It was fun, we'll have to do more. We did take a few salted minnows which seemed to help locating a feeding group of fish. After we found them, we didn't waste the time putting them on. Anyone else have any good St. Joe stories? My best last year was on a northern that nailed my spoon with 3 feet of line out. After a good fight I went to first try to grab him on the back but he was too thick! I tried numerous times to turn him right to get him under the gill plate but couldn't get a good spot for it. He finally made one last jump and spit my spoon out. He would have gone around 36 inches. Fred, email me at [email protected], and let me know when your going. Jim Grebin"
