We go to LOTW every year and fish the Sabaskong Bay area. I go for the catch & release on the smallies and the muskies. Now my relatives from chicago go for the walleye. They have been nearly blanking for the past few years. I told them the problem is we need to fish some more water that has deep water near by, as we fish in June and the reefs out in the deeper reaches tend to be more consistent. They do not fish that often, and there skills are not up to par. They are also die-hard jig-n-minnow fisherman. They are not versatile and basically cannot adapt to conditions. I could care less about walleye as I am there for the rush from the topwater explosions from the smallies and muskies. What would you recommend in order to help them get fish in the boat (walleye). The trip is not successful in their eyes unless they get walleye - too bad they are missing out on the other fish. I live in California and fish bass out here, so my walleye skills are not up to par. How productive do you find fishing the lighter jig-n-minnow in the shallow depths - 5-10 feet ? Weed choked bays ect. ? I do not want any spots in particular, just some ideas to throw around. And I know you cannot predict how the bite WILL be but what have you found in the past ? Hey take it easy, and who knows, maybe I can convince them to get you for a day. Good luck this season. David"
