I'm also taking the canoe, because we're going to spend an additional 3 days in the Nestor Falls and Kenora area fishing some lake trout, smallmouth, and northern pike on some out of the way lakes that we've discovered in the past couple years. So, it's going to be a 10-day trip. Already counting down the days. (and remembering to include the Leap Year when doing so) ""Jackpot"" John Schroeder"
