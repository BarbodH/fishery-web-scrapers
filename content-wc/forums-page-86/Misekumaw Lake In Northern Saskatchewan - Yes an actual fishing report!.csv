Report is tremendous, reviewed it for about 2 hours. As mentioned you are gifted writer, photographer, etc. My father declined to join us this year on our trip a real bummer. Best wishes. Charlie"

Although we never had the type of fishing you guys enjoyed Thanks again for sharing..Glad you enjoyed it. Truth be told I've been calling that rig a Wolf River Rig my whole life, I just figured ""3-way"" rig would be more descriptive to most people. If you look at some of the lake trout vids from last years trip to Bain, I'm calling the rig my ""ghetto Wolf River rig"" Quote: Originally Posted by BornToFishGreetings,Mike: You are a gifted writer.

6477080,Mike Borger,2020-08-23 21:33:00,1554,"Like pretty much everyone my travel and life in general has been severely disrupted by the Covid virus this year, but thankfully I was still able to travel to Misekumaw Lake in far northern Saskatchewan in early July with my son Brendan. Misekumaw is a remote single cabin outpost camp operated by Milton Lake Lodge in the far NE corner of the province.I fished Misekumaw 3 years ago and had an incredible time catching large numbers of trophy pike. This time around not only did we catch large pike in abundance, once we figured out where and how to catch the trout, we had easily the best lake trout fishing I've ever experienced in my life for both numbers and size.I had no idea the lake trout fishery was that good at Misekumaw, and in my opinion it's every bit as incredible as the pike fishery. Maybe even better.To date this was easily the best outpost fishing trip I've ever experienced in Canada. A strong statement I know, but the truth. What made it even better was the camp itself has seen vast improvements under new ownership since my first visit. Brand new Lund boats with full floors and electric start 4 stroke Yamaha motors. New walkways connecting all the cabins, new shower house and flush toilet, brand new big deck in front of the cooking cabin, and inside a new 50 inch flat screen satellite tv, and flawless satellite wifi to stay connected with the outside world.The only downside was Transwest Air lost my bag with all my reels and good video camera on the way in, so for the first 5 days of the trip we fished with 3 borrowed reels. Then amazingly on the way home Westjet lost another one of my bags with my video camera in it, which is apparently gone for good now. None of that was the outfitters fault, and in the end it wasn't the end of the world.My dad passed away shortly before this trip, so for much of the time I was fairly emotional although I wasn't really showing it. Being there with my son was the best possible therapy and I know my dad was smiling down at us from above!This story is a pretty good one, so if you have a bit of time and would like to read about it in detail you can see it here:https://www.canadafishingguide.net/t...isekumaw-lake/Cheers,Mike"

6477156,pjshorthorn,2020-08-24 07:34:00,5654,"Awesome trip !!! I love the adventure aspects of the trip. It reminded me of a few things from the Athabasca trip...... - Fishing the small narrow inlet on day one where we got caught in a brief storm with heavy rain and lightning, but the pike still kept biting after it passed. The second trip there, we caught plenty of nice pike and saw a giant bull moose feeding in  our spot. - Finding many many big pike in a bay towards the end of the evening where I was lucky enough to land a 45 beast. If it hadn't been for a two hour run back to camp, I know we would have stayed there for a really long time....LOL. - Deciding to roll the dice and going down lake on Engler, to explore the outlet not knowing what we would find, including fish, and knowing that we would get are arses kicked by the wind and waves on the way back. That day fly in trip checked all the boxes for sure !!! So glad that you and Brendan had an epic trip together. There can't be any better time than spending it with your son on an adventure like you had. Kudos to you both. May your next one be just as fishy. One day it would be amazing to get back to the the northern fringes of Saskatchewan. Best Wishes, PjShorthorn"

Many on here can appreciate the family/relationship side you mentioned about losing your father earlier this year and how the trip with your son helped in the healing process.. BTW the laker set-up you used with the drop weight is called a Wolf River rig in many parts of Wisc. and I have used for a number of different species.. Great to see it worked well on those lakers in 60-70fow..Also enjoyed the effort you guys made to get to that portage lake.
