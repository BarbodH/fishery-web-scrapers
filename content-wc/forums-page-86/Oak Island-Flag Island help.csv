Hazard areas on way there, fishing patterns in that area in mid Sept etc, I know its not in Canada but the people who are familiar with the area typically fish in Canada as well as MN so i am posting the Canada forum. Thanks everyone and good fishing to all!"

6482300,Baseline,2020-09-10 17:46:00,3207,A water crossing to the NW Angle is about 30 miles though the heart of Sullivan Bay. The only hazard is wind. The winds if strong enough can push waves making the crossing impossible for smaller boats and a rough ride for bigger boats. Sullivan Bay sits on the edge of the midwest prairie lands and there is always some sort of wind blowing. I suggest you time your crossing for early morning before any winds get going as the day wears on. I'd recommend you contact your resort and advise them of the type of boat you have and what they would recommend for crossing safely. When you get there you will find excellent walleye fishing and September is prime time.

6482500,Walleye990,2020-09-11 10:22:00,8,"I was up there last weekend and man did the wind blow!! I am also heading up to Oak Island area on the 19th. I contacted Sportsmans Lodge, they offer a shuttle service up to Oak. They are going to let me follow them up to Oak, leaving at 6:30 am. lassh your welcome to follow me up as well."
6482888,lassh,2020-09-12 08:51:00,553,Thanks Walleye990. I appreciate the offer for us to follow your boat. I'll PM you.
6483398,txk4,2020-09-13 18:33:00,31,"We just got back from a week at Flag Island Resort. We took the transport service from Sportsman's lodge up to the Northwest Angle. Greg Hennum from Sportsman's has done a fantastic service for the resorts up there with his work on getting people up there for their trips. Coming home was an easy trip, but going up on 9/5, I was glad we were in his SportCraft due to the wind etc. Fishing was good. Early in the week most of the guides were pulling spinners, by the end of the week most had switched to jigging. When the wind blows (especially from the SW, W), the fishing spots in Minnesota are limited but doable. Any little thing you see on the chip, depth finder will hold fish. No real big fish for us (biggest was 24 3/4"") but there were a few guys that reported bigger. A couple of northerns over 40 were caught and photoed. The folks at Flag are great about sharing info. If you don't have one booked for your first day, just ask for some help and they will give you the current update. Enjoy your trips up there, I am sure you will have a great time. Wish I could go back!"
6483456,lassh,2020-09-14 05:47:00,553,Thanks for report TXK4. What kind of pattern were the pike on?
6483660,txk4,2020-09-14 17:39:00,31,Not sure I can give much info on the pike. The ones I saw were caught while fishing for walleyes. One on a jig and one while pulling spinners. There was a group of guys in camp that spent time trolling for muskies/pike but I do not know how it went for them. This time of year we usually find some nice pike while walleye fishing but not my boat this trip. Plenty of rocks to cast to if you are so inclined. Good luck. T
