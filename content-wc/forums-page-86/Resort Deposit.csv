6480154,Seanymph75,2020-09-03 16:21:00,3,Had reservations at Temple Bay Resort for this summer. Deposit was $100 per person (3 People) for a total of $300. Will not be going back to Canada next year as have booked stay in northern Minnesota. Received email from lodge today saying I have a $300 credit for next year or I can pass it on to someone else. Would sell for $150. If interested PM Seanymph75.
