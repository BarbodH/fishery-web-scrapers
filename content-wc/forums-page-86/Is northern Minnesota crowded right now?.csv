6481468,andersaki,2020-09-08 07:05:00,1426,"We just returned Saturday from a week at Lake Vermilion. Looking at the numbers of boats on the water, it didn't seem any busier that it usually is. Talking with a few resort owner friends however, tells a different story. They both say that they have been booked solid for the entire season, with new requests coming in every day. Mark"
6481470,Eckohlt,2020-09-08 07:10:00,3685,"One boat on press it's probably fished out then,haha"
6481472,Skywagon,2020-09-08 07:11:00,1106,"No sorry, I have driven within 10 miles (as the crow flies) of Press three times this year, but always come in from the other direction (west), which is an entirely different road system. I have never fished Press, but the friend that was riding with me on Saturday has. The boat we saw fishing was in a narrows."

6481504,Guest,2020-09-08 08:21:00,0,"The statement that was made, was ""Less Fish"" not the 'Experience' If Erie doesn't count, as far as fish goes, that's easily solved.... Don't go LOL"
6476344,jburns,2020-08-20 21:44:00,31,"Yes, June trip to Canada canceled, tentative fall backup trip to Canada canceled. Went ahead and booked a week stay on a smaller lake near leech lake. Going to meet some friends in Wisconsin to fish kings for 4 days then spend the next week fishing around northern Minnesota. Was hoping to get away and have a more secluded trip similar to Canada but nervous lakes may be crowded and not get that experience. Will be up end of September, so I guess we will see."
6476446,DLwalleye,2020-08-21 07:47:00,13,"the resorts in ND are very busy this season. booked solid, then into hunting season. seeing license plates from over 40 states in Bismarck/Devils Lake with fishing guys. fun to see. great conversations of fishing from around the country. talked to many guys who had a blast in ND and plan to come back instead of Canada, or add it to the trip."
6476468,Hook_settr,2020-08-21 08:16:00,127,I can totally relate to this as I am the ramrod on our trips to LOTW. I always tell myself that I’m going to be more go with the flow and appreciate it more. I don’t get up there nearly as much as I would like to so I always feel the pressure to get the most out of the trip that I can.
6476488,1shooter,2020-08-21 08:53:00,1493,The border is closed by agreement from the US and Canada......
6476954,tadler,2020-08-23 11:30:00,43,"Just returned from a week's trip to the Turtle Flambeau Flowage in northern Wisconsin. 95% of flowage is state owned so it has a very Canada feel. But the fishing was terrible. Blue bird skies with no wind. Blaah. However, very busy. Cabins, resorts, restaurants much busier than normal. The guide I used for a day said he hasn't had a day off since June. So I'm sure northern MN is busier than normal and so is Wisconsin. Tom"
6479248,muskyman73,2020-09-01 06:17:00,401,"Just got back from Crane lake. Boats everywhere. From Crane up to Namakan and all inbetween. The fishing pressure is defintely there but at the same time, it's nice that the money is being spent and pumped into the economy and into an industry that we all like to participate in."
6479276,Guest,2020-09-01 08:21:00,0,So says you Erie has more catch-able walleye in it than you can shake a stick at Muskie???????? I'll give you that much.
6479278,MrSimon,2020-09-01 08:30:00,922,"Erie doesn't count. Sure, it has tons of huge walleye .... but it doesn't give the ""Canadian experience"". Not even close. The biggest four walleye of my life came out of Erie. Those pictures aren't on my wall, ones from Ontario are."

6481268,drlee,2020-09-07 14:29:00,409,"Usually a month in Northern Ontario every summer for many years. One in the Ignace area and one near Pickle Lake. Kept in touch all summer, but as you know, no luck this year. Pretty tough. Both camps I go to held my deposit over and kept my reservation for the same week in 2021. Grateful. I actually volunteered to send another deposit, buy both owners declined. ( I have been with both of them for lots of years.)So, we did Pelican Lake near Orr, MN for a week. No walleyes, but we had some fun with small mouth and large mouth and northerns. Large mouth were nice size at around 20"". Some nice small mouth, quite a few smaller ones. Used top waters on the bass and that was a lot of fun. Some spectacular strikes! Really nice camp, but pretty expensive. Good service, nice people, great setting. Lake was NOT that crowded. The resort we used was full. We did not have good numbers of fish, but it sure was good to get out of Dodge. First time on Pelican.Buddy and I leave for Ottertail Lake near Fergus Falls, MN. for a week next week. Will target fall walleye. We shall see. Big lake. Lots of sand and gravel bars. Again, new lake, sort of, so a real adventure. From 1955 to 1965, my grandma and grandpa, mom and dad, my two brothers, aunt,uncle and cousins spent two weeks on Ottertail every summer. Drove up from home in NW Iowa (Rock Rapids). Was a walleye heaven back then. Wind was often an issue, so we visited different lakes in the area, Anna, East and West Lost, Pleasant, Clitherall, Dead. Rented boats and carried our 5 horse motor. Great memories. And, the camp we used is still there! Its now called The Lodge on Ottertail Lake. So, it will be a trip down history lane, regardless of the outcome. That darn border better be open next summer."

Was going with my 2 sons & another father/son duo. But we rolled our deposit into 2021 with them and went to Devils Lake 7/25-7/30. Another bucket list destination. Great trip and we caught a lot of fish!! My wife & I are also going to Lake Vermillion 9/26-9/30!! Another bucket list destination!! Have one kid left in HS for 2 more years with 2 in college right now, but these destination trips are going to be a lot of fun for years to come!!"

6476100,emma17,2020-08-20 08:57:00,436,"Skis- you have a similar family situation as mine- we are a bit older so we started a few years back. The annual trips have been an absolute blessing for us in many ways. I'm curious to hear about your Devil's Lake trip. Sounds like you did well, how does the environment compare to NW Ontario? Boat traffic? Would you go again?"
6476254,nd89sc88,2020-08-20 16:27:00,92,"I didn't have a trip planned this year, so didn't have to deal with any rolling deposits, but when my fishing partner and I decided we wanted to do a trip this September, we chose Flag Island in the NW Angle (going via boat). Unfortunately those resorts have been hurt by the border being closed because not as many people are comfortable going 30 miles via water. It's a place I've always wanted to fish, and this just seemed like the right year to do it. A little disappointed we can't cross into Ontario waters, but there's so much water up there, I'm sure we'll never get bored. Bill"
6476286,Northwoodswalleye,2020-08-20 18:13:00,262,I live on Lake Vermilion and the resorts are maxed out. Full across the board.
6476294,Barley,2020-08-20 18:39:00,10,We diverted our trip from Canada for the 2nd week in June to Kabetogama. The weather and the fishing was bad but the company was good.
6476338,floorguynate,2020-08-20 21:08:00,22,"I live in Park Rapids and it doesn't seem any busier than normal (downtown shopping seems less busy). There might be a few more pleasure boaters than usual. Had a musky trip to Morson planned for a couple weeks ago that we had to cancel but we managed to catch fish around here instead. Walleye fishing has been pretty good lately, hope you do well."
6475342,stjoeguy,2020-08-18 10:31:00,979,Sounds like a good trip. The numbers won't compare to Ontario so don't even try. I like your approach of just relaxing. Have a great time.

Contacted 13 campgrounds in Walker/Bemidji area. 3 did not reply, 9 were booked for 2021(taking waiting lists) and one had one site available. I took it."
6475388,Eckohlt,2020-08-18 12:15:00,3685,Guest45 might be less of a hassle but also a lot less fish
6475398,emma17,2020-08-18 12:32:00,436,"Not too far from Bemidji is a camp named Wausota Resort- on Round Lake in Squaw Lake, MN. Pretty close to Winnie and Leech."
6475560,LoDo,2020-08-18 20:30:00,721,"Many of us will have decisions to make in years to come. As usual it'll come down to cash, family dynamics, etc.... Many will continue doing Ontario with the guys. Many won't and do MN and WI with the family. 2020 was going to be a HUGE year for Ontario camp owners. No question. Pre CoVID, Americans had loads of discretionary income. Many would say the last 3-5 yrs were the best fiscal years they had. Time will tell. Regardless, 2020 definitely changed this particular trip. Will be interesting to see if Americans continue this tradition or stay south of the border."
6475568,RichA$1970,2020-08-18 20:37:00,1159,Agreed and last year several resorts close down due to the wildfires. I also feel many of the loyal customers are approaching that age where it’s tough on them to go off the grid for a week and I just do t see as much interest due to multiple reasons of younger fisherman filling those gaps. Camps will be full in 2021 if allowed to open however that is due to carryover 2020 deposits.
6475608,Eckohlt,2020-08-19 03:20:00,3685,"I will go to Ontario until my last breath,it's what I live for,the boat motor only gets to rest after dark when I go,I make it a job when IM fishing buts it's the best job in the world to me"
6475142,jackpotjohnny48,2020-08-17 20:23:00,153,"Hi guys, Wondering how many of you decided to go with ""Plan B"" and decided to fish northern Minnesota instead. Just got off the phone with a resort owner in the Park Rapids / Walker, MN area and she says it's one of their busiest years ever. Apparently a lot of people who would otherwise be fishing in NW Ontario have opted for northern Minnesota instead. So, my fishing partner and I just pulled the trigger on a trip to Park Rapids, MN area (technically Nevis, MN) and from the sounds of things, it seems that the majority of places in the area don't have many (if any) vacancies right now. (Note: I had booked a 6-night stay in Nevis, because that was all that was available at the place I wanted to go to. I really want to stay 7 nights, so I'm looking for a 1-night stay either in Park Rapids or Walker, but it seems that a lot of places are super crowded / booked right now). So, I'm curious... How many of you guys who normally go to Ontario decided to book a trip to northern MN instead? Will I be able to escape some crowds by doing some night fishing (my preferred method), or should I be expecting crowded waterways in northern MN even after dark? Thanks in advance for any feedback, ""Jackpot"" John Schroeder"
6475164,LoDo,2020-08-17 21:43:00,721,"A buddy of mine from high school owns a family camp SE of Walker on Thunder Lake. He says his busiest year to date. He's owned for over a decade. Hes going to go deep into fall as so many states are delaying school. I mentioned this on a thread that was deleted, but IMO, MN/WI offers a different trip. Its a family trip with loads to do outside of fishing. Its a trip you can take your wife and youthful kids. You don't take your 5 and 3 yr old on a NW Ontario fly in. You probably don't take your 10 and 7 yr old on a fly in either. Does a family of four with kids 10 and 7 go to NW Ontario for a week? Maybe. IMO, NW Ontario is hardcore fishing. MN and WI offer a trip for all ages. Great lake towns, shopping, casino, golf, boating, pontoon, water skiing, etc.... Ontario is geared towards hard core anglers. When we go to Ontario, we fish 100% of the time. We fish in all weather too. About the only thing that gets me out of the boat is full sun and 85 degrees. At least thats what my group does.I think the next few years could be interesting with the Ontario trip. Will the numbers be there for those camps? I know I'll be there, just curious on everyone else. Time will tell."
6475206,tv4fish,2020-08-18 05:11:00,2694,"I think LoDO has covered it very well - most of us go to Canada primarily for the fishing (and to be with ""Buddies"")."
6475212,Blue walleye,2020-08-18 05:49:00,29,"My brother and I had both of our trips to Canada canceled. We had to roll our deposit’s for next year. To replace out August trip, we booked a houseboat on rainy lake and will be going next week. I heard there’s been a lot of boat traffic on rainy this year. I’m sure quite a few fishermen did back up trips to northern Minnesota. Hopefully the fishing will be good. Been to rainy lake on a houseboat a few years ago and had a blast."
6475216,Guest,2020-08-18 06:05:00,0,"I was up on Rainy Lake from 8/1 thru 8/8. My past trips there are always in early October so I cant gauge how busy this August is compared to any other August, but there was definitely a lot of people out, resorts were pretty full, lots of houseboats coming and going daily. That said, the lake is plenty big to get away from any crowds and find your own fish. There were a few days that we fished reeds that had a couple other boats around them, but also days that we fished and had nobody within a mile of us. The further east you go, the less boat traffic, and most of the pleasure boaters dont make it half way to the Brule Narrows"
6475222,eyecatcher1,2020-08-18 06:14:00,323,My wife and I have fished NW Ontario 2 or 3 times a year since 1992. This will be the first year that we haven't been up there. We'll be back for sure as soon as we are able to go.
6475230,RichA$1970,2020-08-18 06:29:00,1159,"I agree and glad to see the local resorts generating the revenue due to the border closing and interesting how I’m not hearing COVID outbreaks from the Northwoods fishing camps. I’m waiting to go up to northern MN until October 3 as the traffic will be gone n fall is my favorite time. Still holding out to join Eck in mid Oct in Ontario, but if not, glad to be on a big lake, fishing with some friends and enjoying what is and has been available to us."

6475336,emma17,2020-08-18 10:21:00,436,"We also had two Ontario trips planned. We booked a week on a Rainy Lake houseboat the second week of September. I'm as prepared as I can be to fish w much lower expectations. I do think there is a chance this will be a more relaxing trip (assuming I don't crash the houseboat) than our Ontario trips. When in Ontario, it seems I spend every waking moment either fishing, driving to a fishing hole, planning the day's route or pushing everyone to get up and get going. On this trip, I'm hoping to chill out more, even throw a bobber off the back of the houseboat while making breakfast/dinner. Smell the roses a bit more. Take time to try different presentations. Feed the eagles. Play cards later without worrying about getting up too early."
