Review of my Garmin E Trex 10 which I recently used quite a bit on our fly in trip to Root Bay this past week Overall I am happy with the unit especially when considering the cost and the run time I get out of 2 AA batteries https://www.northernjacks.com/post/garmin-etrex-10-handheld-gps-product-review Trip reports and such will be up soon but I did post a short video of our flight into the Root Bay on the website â its on the home page near the bottom Cheers Andrew
