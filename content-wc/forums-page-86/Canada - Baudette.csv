6483956,stumcfar,2020-09-15 15:12:00,451,How was your trip??
6484366,Iowa Hawkeye,2020-09-16 23:20:00,90,"Great trip, the fishing was OK, nothing like Lac Suel, longest was 26"", couple of tough days because of the wind. Zippels to the river isn't far, unless the wind is blowing, which is the case everywhere on Lake Of the Woods. You can boat anywhere on the river, but not fish on the Canadian side without a license, which I believe is the same on the US side. The water is very low right now, at least 2 foot low."
6484408,Net_Man,2020-09-17 06:59:00,580,Do they have a different set of laws that applies to the Rainy river or are they just not enforcing it? In a typical year you can lawfully travel back and forth if you follow law/procedure. Currently you can not cross by land or water. Illegal border crossings are not the friendliest conversation to have with with the authorities for a US citizen.
6484606,stumcfar,2020-09-17 12:13:00,451,"I don't believe anything has changed on the Rainy. Travel on the river as far as my experience has never been mandated that you do not cross the middle of the river. With that said do not stop on shore or be caught fishing on the Canadian side and that is enforced any time not just now. While sturgeon fishing this spring, a Canadian CO boat travelled the river where we were fishing and pulled up near boats that were over the line and made them move. I never saw them board a boat or hand out any tickets, but I know it has happened."
6481566,Iowa Hawkeye,2020-09-08 10:26:00,90,"We are going to Baudette later this week and have never been there before. Can you boat from the Lake of the Woods to Baudette? Looking at the map, the Canada border is along the US shoreline at the mouth, then goes to the middle of the Rainy river in the town of Baudette. We are staying at Zippels resort. Any tips for that area would be greatly appreciated. Thanks"
6481590,tandm,2020-09-08 12:21:00,679,Google maps shows the border coming across Lake of the woods and not anywhere close to the U.S. border until it goes down the middle of the Rainy River.
6481600,johnboat,2020-09-08 12:44:00,2014,I would error on the side of caution as far as getting to close to the border in the water.
6481604,Woodhead,2020-09-08 12:54:00,75,"I would definitely ask at Zippels since your assessment is the same as mine and that being it appears as though you could cast into Canada from the US shoreline. Perhaps a better picture would be that you could vertical fish in Canada from the US shoreline!! The line may be ""off"" a little, but I would not use that as an excuse!"
6481636,stumcfar,2020-09-08 15:05:00,451,"It would be a fairly long boat ride, but you can get from Zipple to Baudette. Boats, including charters go up and down the river all the time. I have never heard of the Canadian side bothering anyone unless you are clearly fishing over the center. I am not sure on maps, because if you look at most maps, the Lighthouse Gap, which every charter and hundreds of boats on a normal day, use to get from the Rainy River to LOW looks as if it is in Canada. I fished that area this weekend and it is clearly considered U.S."
6481658,IowaWalleye1978,2020-09-08 15:32:00,96,A friend of mine just fished the south side of the lake and the river this last weekend. He fished both sides of the river. Good luck!
6481728,MikeAnkeny,2020-09-08 17:54:00,67,Hey! We are at Zippel this coming week too from Iowa but Cyclone fan. First time instead of Lac Seul. Was told that there are stakes dividing the river and best not to cross. Don't want to endanger future crossing privleges. Cabin 2 stop for a brew.
6481768,muskyed,2020-09-08 19:00:00,727,"Wouldn't worry about crossing the border if you have a map chip. Border line should come up on your chip. My friend just drove up to his trailer this morning, by 4 mile bay, at Cyrus resort. Should be good fishing if the winds stay down."
6481932,srj,2020-09-09 09:02:00,971,"The center of the river is the border. There are no physical markings. You cannot fish on the Canada side. As mentioned, many boats use the river every day. There are several resorts on the river between the river mouth and Baudette, many with great food. Have fun"
6482168,Baseline,2020-09-10 07:32:00,3207,Baudette is a long way from Zipple Bay. The whole of Sullivan Bay of LOW is US waters. You will have no worries about accidentally crossing into Canada. If you do fish the Rainy River the border is roughly in the middle. The river is wide enough that there will be no problem decreeing where the boarder is. If you are moving on the river and do cross the center line I doubt that you would have a problem with the Canadian law enforcement. It's not like they have a big army on the border. I fish the Rainy River several times every spring and fall and have for 35 years and have never seen any Canadian MNR on the River. Your biggest problem with LOW will be wind. If you do get winded out. Trailer your boats to either Frontier or Birchdale landings on the Rainy River. Walleyes can get active this time of the year. There is also Lake Sturgeon present. Another alternative would be to trailer to Wheelers Point and launch at the public landing where the Rainy River terminates into 4 mile Bay. Head up river.
