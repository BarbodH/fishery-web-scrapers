6484942,Net_Man,2020-09-18 08:36:00,580,Thank you but I was interested in which lakes that you already have fished at Clark's and how the fishing compared to Lower Wapesi.
6484954,Eckohlt,2020-09-18 09:20:00,3685,"I fished with Clarks,upper wapesi and snelgrove lake,there are 2 wapesi lakes upper wapesi and the other is just wapesi lake there is no lower wapesi,there are plenty of guys on WC that have fished plenty of Clarks lakes,I've only fished 2 of there lakes so I'm really not the guy with good info on there lakes"
6484764,Camoclad,2020-09-17 19:01:00,628,"I guess I have missed where get over it was conveyed, but I just don't get that vibe/attitude/disposition from my communications with him. I am not disagreeing with the frustration folks have felt with regard to losing deposits and even with my roll over deposit with another outfitter I too am concerned about losing that money (about $6600 + airfare for our group) should next season be affected by the border closure like this one has been. Grace and forgiveness are a two way street during the tough times and hopefully there will be an opportunity for both down the road for everyone involved when we have the benefit of hindsight to rely on. I am not flaming you, just sharing my thoughts, take them only as that. On a brighter note, only 15 more weeks of the terror that is 2020 remain! Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
6484774,Eckohlt,2020-09-17 19:14:00,3685,Who could forget about fanny Brice
6484784,BrianinVA,2020-09-17 19:28:00,160,I completely agree that it is a two way street. The absence of grace and humility from the outfitter in this instance makes forgiveness an especially tough pill to swallow. It certainly doesn't help when others continue to rub salt into the wounds.
6484792,Net_Man,2020-09-17 19:37:00,580,The get over it comment was conveyed in a post by Prov in the morning earlier this week. He was complaining about the people *****ing about loosing a few hundred dollars in doing business with Clark's is very close to what he stated. He started a bit of a storm with this comment and the thread got nuked.This comment from him seemed out of place for him except for his other post complaining on how much lost income he has experienced this year compared to the amount that Clark's customers were loosing. I guess he is human also.
6484796,pjshorthorn,2020-09-17 19:38:00,5654,"Yep, your response was transparent and spoke volumes for only myself. You didn't answer the question I asked just like the person you have been pushing to answer your question. I guess you got the point.... PjShorthorn"
6484800,BrianinVA,2020-09-17 19:41:00,160,"It was a clown question, bro."
6484806,pjshorthorn,2020-09-17 19:48:00,5654,Yep....for sure. Just asking the same line of questioning as you started out within your previous posts. Nothing more nothing less. You aren't big on accountability are you ? Oops....another question. PM me your home address and I'll be happy to ship you a new axe to use. The one you are using has to be quite dull by now. PjShorthorn
6484808,Eckohlt,2020-09-17 19:48:00,3685,"6600 ouch,may I ask where your group is headed next year?"
6484816,Net_Man,2020-09-17 20:08:00,580,I am a curious sort on some occasions. Which lake or lakes did you visit at Clark's and how was your fishing experience compared to your trip to Lower Wapesi lake?
6484820,BrianinVA,2020-09-17 20:18:00,160,"OK, I'll play along. No, I haven't called Clark's to discuss matters personally. When they posted their non-apology here on Walleye Central explaining that they were keeping customer's deposits I learned all I needed to know about their operation straight from the horse's mouth. Here are some of the gems from that post. Which quote do you think resonated the most with a customer that just learned they lost a couple thousand dollars? 1.Quote: All of our Outposts are equipped with Honda EU generators, lights on a switch, electric outlets, and mostly electric appliances to make things easy and efficient so our guests can enjoy their holiday. 2.Quote: We also include free minnows in our package, which might not mean much to some but to most it's a game changer 3.Quote: What I'm also wondering is, do people actually think that by abusing our guests or not being fair 4.Quote: Regarding our current position on deposits, as everyone is well aware, at this time we are not refunding OR rolling them over to another season 5.Quote: we will continue with our deal days specials on select lakes. 6.Quote: We are already re-booked over 60% for May and June next year 7.Quote: I won't bore you further with our financial situation 8.Quote: I greatly look forward to stocking your minnow baskets every second day next summer"

6484738,pjshorthorn,2020-09-17 17:43:00,5654,"Since you are in the question asking business, I’ll ask a simple question. It only requires a yes or no answer.To gain your own personal perspective on whether this outfitter has integrity and transparency, have you picked up the phone and personally spoken to them about the situation you deem to be very important ? I’m sure everyone on this forum is anxiously awaiting your response.Just a tip, look up “ critical thinking” on the internet. The concept may help you make decisions for yourself instead of relying on information posted on the internet. BTW, Is my post transparent enough for you ? Sorry for a second question since you only asked one previously, but.......Thanks for the entertainment value you have provided in your posts Keep them coming.PjShorthorn"
6484746,Camoclad,2020-09-17 18:18:00,628,"Prov1800 is a stand up guy and he is standing up for a friend and his business. He doesn't say you have to agree. I don't take it as advertising, merely sharing the benefits of his association and his personal experiences. That is what friends do. I message with John regularly and did so while planning a trip for this year with another outfitter. He often mentions other lodges as well as other locations where he takes clients. When we were looking for a replacement trip to Wisconsin for this year he offered up a contact for me to reach out to for a guide trip and offered to help with some strategy. I don't know a lot of guides but in comparison to the ones I know, John shares information more freely than any of the others. The group I went with to Eagle lake last summer used him for a couple days of guiding through another lodge and he told us about his relationships with several area lodges he also works with. He is a family man and shares of those experiences too, and is an avid outdoorsman who makes a living doing what he loves. I wish him well, I hope he brings home a ton of moose meat and a ton of fish stories to share. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
6484752,BrianinVA,2020-09-17 18:28:00,160,"Cool story, bro."
6484758,BrianinVA,2020-09-17 18:47:00,160,"Your thoughtful take is appreciated as is the guidance Prov has given so many. No one is calling that into question. What many do take issue with is the shilling of a outfitter with questionable business practices and the dismissive tone conveyed when someone mentions they've lost money to that resort. Telling someone to ""get over it"" when they've lost hundred or thousands of dollars is not a good look for a stand up guy."

6484624,BrianinVA,2020-09-17 12:32:00,160,"That seems like a good use of customer deposit money. Am I right? Honestly, part of what makes me scratch my head is that John does provide so much good guidance when he's not touting Clark's and he seems like a genuinely great guy. It makes it all the more confounding that he's chosen such a strange hill to die on."
6484630,Net_Man,2020-09-17 12:39:00,580,It is not as bad when Prov defends them when responding to a negative post but he keeps giving and giving and giving and giving them a plug with most of his reports. Prov is surely the energizer bunny in this issue...... Some one has to be paying advertising with the content of the bulk of his reports.

6484590,BrianinVA,2020-09-17 11:56:00,160,"You are absolutely correct about me not giving up. But I do think your comment is best directed at the poster who keeps starting problematic threads advertising a resort that is holding customer's deposit money hostage. I'm simply trying to help the fine folks at Walleye Central enforce their no free advertising policy. If John receives a free or discounted trip, his trip report would be sponsored content which violates the rules of this site. I'm sure John will clear things up when he returns and let us all know he paid the going rate for his trip."
