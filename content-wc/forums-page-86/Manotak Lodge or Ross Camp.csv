6480902,BornToFish,2020-09-06 06:38:00,1224,"Greetings,I am familiar with Perrault Lake, having fished there for about one hundred weeks. I am not familiar with Ross Camp. I don't know what species you intend to target.Perrault Lake is an interesting body of water. It's a great multi-species lake - walleyes, muskies, northern pike, small mouth bass, perch and whitefish. Something is almost always biting on Perrault Lake.The lake is straightforward to navigate. There are numerous navigational hazards, that are pretty much in places you would expect to find a hazard. At one time, the hazards were marked with orange buoys. I understand from friends that many of these buoys have not been in place since I was last on the lake in 2015.One thing to recognize about Perrault Lake is the importance of knowing ""spots"" to fishing success. Obviously, the same can be said about nearly every lake. I found this to be particularly important when fishing Perrault Lake. Knowing the location of fishing ""spots"" for differing wind conditions is a definite key to fishing success on Perrault Lake.September was one of my favorite times of the season to fish Perrault Lake. Bugs weren't a factor. Boating traffic on Perrault Lake can be a concern throughout much of the season as there are four lodges on the lake. However it's not a problem in September when kids are in school and many guys are hunting.Two factors come into play in autumn on Perrault Lake. Autumn winds can be a problem. Big waves can restrict anglers as to where they can safely boat and fish. Perrault Lake has numerous islands that are found around the perimeter of the lake. Thus, anglers can almost always fish behind these islands when the wind is blowing and still catch fish.The other factor is fog. Obviously, the length of day is much shorter in September than May - August. Fog will frequently shorten the day even more. There were many days that I didn't get out on the lake until mid-morning as I had to wait for the fog to burn off.I have many fond memories fishing on Perrault Lake. It was a bit of struggle in the early years on Perrault Lake. Nevertheless, I can honestly say that I became a much better fisherman having fished Perrault Lake for so long.Good fishing and tight lines!!"

Walleye is what I’m after but I like to catch crappies and game fish as well. I love fall fishing and September is the month I’m looking at, I’m headed to Leech Lake in a couple of weeks. Next year’s availability will probably be challenging so I’m looking at a few places.Ross Camp is on the Clearwater/Pipestone lake chain, I should have listed the lakes instead of the Camp names."
6480942,BornToFish,2020-09-06 09:30:00,1224,"Greetings,I describe Perrault Lake as having clearer rather than stained water. The secchi depth is usually around ten to twelve feet of water. Having said this, the water clarity in mid-September can get sketchy. There is normally a wave of algae blooms that come down Cedar River from Cedar Lake. These can, and often do, turn the water green in Perrault Lake. Turnover is often in the middle of September, but can be as late as late-September to early October.Perrault Lake is about 8,500 acres. It is ""deep"" water, with the main lake basin around 40-50 fow. Weeds are present in the lake, but NOT widespread. The weeds in the lake are clearly on the decline by early September, and pretty much gone by mid-September.Perrault Lake is clearly a mesotrophic body of water, with attributes of an oligotrophic body of water.Water primarily enters Perrault Lake from Rainy Lake, Ord River and Cedar River. The only outlet is at Perrault Falls.The walleye fishing in September is good. The key to walleye success is finding the off-shore rock humps, of which there are many. A challenge is that these off-shore rock humps are fairly small. The depth the walleyes are likely to be hanging out at during September will run 24-32 fow. Vertical jigging is a highly effective technique in September.The musky fishing can be sensational in mid-September, especially if you hit the ten days or so preceding turnover. The ""musky corridor"" is a prime place to look for muskies. Bigger Northern Pike will likely be hanging out on the rock humps with the walleyes. If interested in the lake, see if you can locate a copy of the book that I wrote entitled ""Secrets of the Canadian Shield: An Angler's Guide to Perrault Lake"". Many folks on Walleye Central have copies - maybe someone will sell or loan you a copy.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6484436,lenray,2020-09-17 07:41:00,467,where is this???????????????????
6484444,BornToFish,2020-09-17 07:48:00,1224,"Greetings, Perrault Lake is situated near Hwy. 105, about forty two miles north of Vermillion Bay. The lake is on the east side of the highway. There is a wayside/rest area along the side of the highway that has a nice view of the lake. Perrault Falls is near the north end of the lake. The lake is about twenty miles south of Ear Falls. Kindest regards...."
