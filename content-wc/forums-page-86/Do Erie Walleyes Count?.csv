6482032,Habitual Eyer,2020-09-09 16:55:00,144,"I travel 3-4 hours due East to fish Erie. My own boat, boards, rods, harnesses, cranks, etc. Fish it a handful of times started in the spring and finishing in the fall. Seems like the (does it really count) charter experience is just a small percentage of the sticks fishing Erie. However...my heart lies in Canada. Through I-Falls into Sunset Country. Canadian Shield lakes. Dark, stained, and beautiful walleyes. Scenery is to die for. Vertical jigging is my all time favorite way to fish (spring jig bite on Erie is not even close to being the same). I hit Canada (1000 miles due North I drive) at least 3 times a year. Not looking at industry on the shore nor worried about getting blown off the lake. I sometimes think I go to Erie to fill my freezer but go to Canada to go fishing. I would not pass up a Canada trip to fish Erie. Really like Erie. Its close and loaded with walleyes....Mostly open water trolling after Memorial Day (not my preferred method but have to go with what works). I a not going to bash Erie...I have enjoyed it for decades. I live only a few miles South of Southern tip of Lake Mich and still travel to Erie instead of Lake Mich....for decades now. I would not make the Erie faithful feel like second class walleye citizens because it is fishing at its best on a great fishery and those that excel there are really good. But...I wish the Erie faithful who are as addicted to walleyes as I am could experience the Canada scenery and bite. I wish it for them in a good way."

They catch a fish and I tell them that they really didn't and I get 2/3 the credit??? That seems dumb.
6480200,spurs101,2020-09-03 18:40:00,635,"Interesting post. I've fished Erie a couple times just to give it a shot. My own set-ups, no guide, my rig. Different experience and crossed of bucket list. I've been to Canada at least 45 times on a remote lake known for trophy eyes and can tell you the over 30's are the ones that are the memorables. Largest was 34. It's the overall experience---remoteness, camp environment, peace and quiet, the loons, releasing any fish over 21. It's way different than any body of water south of the border. I'll be back. I've got a few good years left I think I can pull it off. Back on topic - sure it counts but it's based on your own perspective. Your own experiences."

6479640,HeHooksHimself,2020-09-02 06:55:00,725,"I have been to Erie and we did well, chartering with Fish Fishman. It was a good trip for the boys in the family and we caught some fish, had some laughs and did some bonding. And I have been in Canada at numerous resorts. When I talk about Canadian fishing with people that have never been, most times the question ""Did you bring home a cooler full?"" or something similar is asked. My most frequent response to those types of questions is, ""For me, there is much more to fishing in Canada than the fish."" Then I dream out loud about the serenity, the solitude, the hunt, the camaraderie, the wildlife, the rocks and trees, the stars, the long days, discovering new techniques and new spots, how a 40 inch laker or 42 inch pike changes your day and your life, poker, the stories, etc. etc. While I am not really sure what ""does it count"" means, my response is simply the same as my report on Birch Lake, MN said. ""it ain't Canada."" This forum is the place where people know what I mean. Here's to 2021 and the reopening of our Happy Place."

6479660,Juls,2020-09-02 07:34:00,13414,"Then, of course, it counts! Why wouldn't it?"
6479664,eyecatcher1,2020-09-02 07:36:00,323,I agree HeHooksHimself. I learned to fish walleyes from a friend on Lake St Clair when I lived in Michigan. I moved to Minnesota in 84 and finally bought my own boat in 92. Since then I have fished 4 of the Great Lakes and caught lots of fish and had lots of fun. I started fishing NW Ontario two and three times a year since 92 and for me the Canadian experience is different and something that my wife and I love to do. We're hoping for the best in 2021 also.
6479682,Bobby Winds,2020-09-02 08:43:00,10817,"I have been fishing Lake Erie for walleye, perch, bass since I was 3 years old with my dad. My favorite way of catching walleye and especially bass is with my hand tied bucktail jigs. I don't know how many fish I have caught but it has to be in the HUNDREDS just jigging with no bait whatsoever. I learned how to tie and fish jigs by Will Elliott that has passed away. He was a EXPERT at finesse jigging. This year's first cast with a 1/8 oz round white bucktail jig produced a 8 pound walleye and the second cast got me a 4 pounder in 27' of water with a good current near the head of the Niagara River.......don't ask what the rest of the morning was like....LOLI also like to just drag homemade worm harnesses on the bottom of Erie via drift or slow troll with my TM. This produce a LOT of walleyes for me while relaxing on my boat.I use to fish tournaments when I was much younger and did very well by using downriggers and Great Lake planer boards. I consider this ""HARVESTING"" and no longer do it.If your chartering and just reeling in the fish you are Harvesting and should only be given 1/3 credit for the catch. The guide who set the lines and the boat get the other 2/3 credits IMHO. Most charters use the Harvesting method to get you back to shore ASAP so they can take out their afternoon clients.If you were taken by your hand via a fly-in remote area where the fish have no pressure and was given maps circled with areas to fish you deserve 1/3 credit also. If you use a guide then you should be B slapped and take up golf......LOL"

It's beautiful, accessible, and full of big healthy walleye, bass, perch, drum, catfish, etc etc. I've enjoyed my time on the lake and will definitely be back. But I don't dream about Lake Erie. I dream about Canada."
6479458,Juls,2020-09-01 14:04:00,13414,I couldn't agree with you more. I'm the same.
6479474,Mojo-NC,2020-09-01 14:55:00,1929,"^^^^ This! ^^^^ If you charter on Lake Erie, you will likely catch a limit of nice fish and fill your cooler, but it's not really fishing, it's catching. I chartered recently on Lake Erie with a very accomplished guide (look above), and we caught a lot of fish in a short period of time, but it's not the same as doing it all yourself. Don't get me wrong, we still had a great time and I would do it again (when it's not quite as rough out there), but it's just not the same. I didn't even take a single picture, except of the sunrise over the lake. In retrospect, I wish I would have take some more pictures, but I was too busy reeling in fish - and then it was over. We caught our limit in about record time, and we were done. We perch fished after that and to be honest, that was more ""fishing"" than the trolling part. And those little buggers are as tasty as fish get! Same goes for deep sea fishing. When you pay a captain to haul you out to the blue water, have a mate baiting all of the rods and putting them all out just so you can reel in the fish when it's your turn, it just doesn't count the same. Don't get me wrong, it's still fun but it isn't the same. Canada is awesome for all of the reasons mentioned a gazillion times on this website. The experience of assembling everything you need, packing, traveling up there, getting groceries, driving for several more hours, and the excitement of finally arriving at the camp. Unpacking, assembling the gear, and going down to the boat. Heading out onto the lake and deciding where to go, which species to chase, choosing your one rod and one bait (Ontario law), and getting after it. Then there is that first click, click on the end of the line, and boom - and the rest is history..."
6479510,eyecatcher1,2020-09-01 16:42:00,323,"My wife and I did an Erie charter a little more than 20 years ago just to see how they fished there. The captain took us into a military firing range that was marked to stay out of, but it's where a lot of reefs and fish were. We jigged for them, but my wife and I were jigging 1/4 ounce jigs and the captain and first mate used one ounce jigs. Mine and my wife's fish were hooked in the mouth while their's were all snagged. The captain told us that the hook set was over rated and just to cast and yank. The limit was 10 back then and we did catch 40 walleyes in not much over an hour. Of course he did give us all 40 walleyes since there wasn't a possession limit there at the time. He also told us not to buy the local shiners and just get minnows out of his tanks as long as we were there. We were very surprised to see a charter just snag fish. We did catch a lot more fish in our boat the next few days, but we fished for them and didn't just snag them."
6479522,Obabikon,2020-09-01 18:14:00,2370,"Count as what? I mean... a personal best? Sure. Greatest experience of your life? I have fished Erie. It is an incredible fishery. I've been... I have no interest in or intention of going back. If your single life goal is to catch a 34"" walleye at any cost... by all means. You should fish lake Erie exclusively until you accomplish your mission. Then maybe you can take a break and enjoy the beauty of fishing after your accomplishment. Catching a record is just not one of my life goals. I prefer quiet, calm, pristine waters in the Canadian shield! I like to catch beautiful fish, in picturesque scenery. I love the feeling of boat flipping a 15"" walleye and saying... ""you're lunch"". I'm not sure why everyone is stuck on the idea that the bigger the fish, the better the experience."

6479598,Juls,2020-09-02 02:55:00,13414,"All of them? That's an over-exaggeration, and I'm calling BS on that statement. The one ounce jig is used because of the current here in Erie...and, if there is any wind, the drifts can be fast unless they are slowed down by drift bags. The majority of people jigging would be using that size weight. If you look in the bait shops for the Erie hair jigs used here, 3/4 to 1 ounce is the most popular, and not because people use them to snag fish. I've used them from time to time and the fish caught weren't ""snagged"". And, if there was any wind on your trip, your little 1/4 ounce jig was never on the bottom."

6479300,Carnhzkr,2020-09-01 09:26:00,964,"In the Is Northern Minnesota Crowded thread, I noticed MrSimon said about Lake Erie walleye, ""Erie doesn't count. Sure, it has tons of huge walleye .... but it doesn't give the 'Canadian experience'. Not even close. The biggest four walleye of my life came out of Erie. Those pictures aren't on my wall, ones from Ontario are."" I thought that statement deserved a thread of its own. So what do you think, do Erie walleyes count? I took my two sons on an Erie trip earlier this year for the first time. Fishing with a guide, we filled our coolers with some impressive walleyes, one of which was a 29 incher pulled in by my son. The next day, I asked him if that was his personal best and he said it was, but then paused and asked me, ""do you think it counts?"". My response was along the lines of, if it were me, I wouldn't count it. Maybe with an asterisk by it. He did real the fish in, but he didn't really catch it. We were fishing with 8 lines out and when a board would drop back, whoever happened to be closest to the back of the boat grabbed the line and brought it in. That's not quite the same, IMO, as holding your own rod and teasing a walleye by bouncing a 1/4 oz jig. I'd rather catch a 24"" eye on Lac Seul than a 29"" on Erie, but that's just my opinion. I've always wanted to try Erie. Now I've checked it off my list and I have a freezer full of walleye to show for it."

Better believe they count. Especially if your setting out your own spread, you still have to get alot of things right to fill the cooler- speed ,depth,color,location. It might be relatively easier but it's still fishing"
6479336,stjoeguy,2020-09-01 10:15:00,979,"I know this site has a bunch of Erie fans, so this topic could get heated, but I'm in your camp on favoring catching a walleye by jigging over reeling in a walleye that hooked itself while I sat back and waited my turn. There are many fishing techniques and no right one. I just prefer jigging. Like you, I also prefer the Canada experience, which is also why Erie and Devils Lake just don't appeal to me. Of course, if a fishing buddy called and asked me to join him on either Erie or Devils Lake I'd jump at it. A 29 walleye is a good sized fish, so I'd consider it his current personal best and the number to beat in the future. I empathize with the asterisk feeling, however. My personal best is 32.5, so I'll probably never beat it, but it was caught jigging off the back of a charter boat with six other guys on Lake of the Woods out of Baudette. In Canada I just can't break 28, however, so my goal is to break into 28+ in Canada and have a personal best Canada walleye."
6479344,7 Mag,2020-09-01 10:19:00,1887,I agree the wind makes it a challenge. Finding the fish can be easy as many people just follow the guide boats out to the hot spots. I prefer to drift fish Erie so I typically have my rod in my hand. I can honestly say I still get excited every time I catch a walleye and I'm thankful for the experience.
6479352,Husker525,2020-09-01 10:30:00,720,"To the OP, I think Erie should count. I am chuckling a little while reading these. I may or may not ever have the chance to go to Canada to ""experience"" whatever that may or may not be. I think the real issue is the definition of 'experience' which is different for everyone. The size of the fish, however they may be caught is incredible from what I read from Erie. I know my limitations, and will never be on Erie in my boat, as it exceeds my limitations. And a 'man has got to know his limitations' in the words of Clint Eastwood. Guide is out of the question. Wifey seems to think I walk on water, and REFUSES to entertain paying a guide to catch Walleye for any reason. My life's goal is for her to catch and release a 10 lb Walleye, possible in my area, but still hunting. She caught a 9 lb 2 oz, not good enough. I think that the 'experience' is relative to what you are used to or come from. Erie would be a bucket list for me, let alone Canada! So yes it should count!. I keep logs of fish caught out of my boat. Between the two of us, we average over 1000 eyes caught a year. Just caught, not kept and size doesn't come into play. I am happy with that considering we both have full time jobs, and fish recreationally. I think if you spend enough time on our lakes south of our border friends, you can have the same 'experience' as a Canada trip. JMHO"
6479370,bthomas3333,2020-09-01 10:49:00,465,I don't think it is remotely the same experience as most of Canada. It is especially different than NWT / N SK / N MB / AK as I have never moose / caribou / musk ox on Erie lol but the walleyes sure get big:-). To the point does the fish count? Sure! Why not? I have seen guys hold up 42 inch pike and call them 48. I've seen 26 in walleyes claimed to be 30. I LONG ago quit caring what other people count. You just need to be honest with yourself and have fun doing your thing.B-
6479392,troutwater,2020-09-01 11:28:00,299,"This is an interesting topic. I've been on an Erie charter before and caught a 23 incher, but I never ""counted"" it as the OP has said. I think along the same lines with a guide too, and have never hired one(I'm a muskie guy). For me its always been very rewarding figuring it out on my own. I'll also add my 5 biggest walleye have all been on the lake erie charter or while muskie fishing, but its hard for me to really count those, and I got a replica of the biggest at 27""."
6479440,Juls,2020-09-01 13:24:00,13414,"Erie, or anywhere else.... Unless you are using your own equipment, choosing your own baits, and presenting it the way you want to...none of them count. Doesn't matter if it's Erie or any other lake on the planet. On a side note, I like the fly in vacations we do up in Canada for the ""experience"" too. It smells good, there aren't a bunch of houses surrounding the lakeshore, and there's very little boat traffic. And, when you do see a boat, and wave....they usually wave back at you. It's very peaceful. I think too many get hung up on the size of the fish rather than the memories made during the trip. It must be a ""man thing""."

Plus i get to bring some walleye home, which I rarely do from Canada."
