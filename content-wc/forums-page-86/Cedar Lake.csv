6484006,prov1800,2020-09-15 19:42:00,5010,Got out on Cedar today.Was to nice of a day not to.Mainly a muskie day.Never left Clarks bay. Saw 5 but couldnt get them to take the lure.Only one made a attempt to chase the posiedon.Fished all 5 spots again during the day.Decided it was time to catch some supper fish.Fished a hour and a half and had some good action for late afternoon.Smallies are in same depth as walleyes and caught a lot of them to.water temps holding at 60F and walleyes were in 20 ft where i found them.Took off to head back to camp and engine stopped.Used the terrova to get back to camp maybe half mile.Couldnt lift engine as there was noo power not to tilt either.Left it there but waynes nephew Chris found a blown fuse.So all good now.Will be of the grid for a week or so will catch up later.
6484062,Eckohlt,2020-09-16 00:24:00,3685,Which one of those fish in the pictures did you have for supper?
6484074,prov1800,2020-09-16 05:23:00,5010,"Haha.funny.neither one.brought 4 13"" walleyes home for supper tonight."
6484084,Bill Krejca,2020-09-16 06:50:00,6107,"John - when a fuse blows, there is usually a reason, you might want to trace the wiring down and check for a worn wire, etc. Jis' sayin'. Bill"
6484086,Eckohlt,2020-09-16 06:51:00,3685,13 inchers like eating chocolate melt in your mouth
6484090,jambi,2020-09-16 07:06:00,504,Wow. Clarks Bay is the place to be.
6484192,Eckohlt,2020-09-16 11:33:00,3685,"I wouldn't mind being in any Bay in n.w Ontario,the closes I've been to a bay this year is a bay leaf"
6484196,prov1800,2020-09-16 11:46:00,5010,Got ya Bill.Waynes nephew checked it out and said everything looked good.I didnt even know where those fuses are.I do now and theres about 5 fuses in behind a cover.And there are spare fuses there.Good to know.Glad i was on Cedar and not on Lac Suel.lol.My engine is a 2011 and this is a first that something happened.3500 hrs.
6484204,prov1800,2020-09-16 12:03:00,5010,The area by Clarks is fairly big and has all species except crappies.I have a great time around there and i barely use any fuel.Its half a gallon to fish there rather than 5 gallons running to other end. Only do that for crappie days. If a gallon of gas was the same here as in states i would run farther.5 gallons here is like 30 bucks.
