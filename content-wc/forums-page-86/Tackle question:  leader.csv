For Father's Day, my son sent me a couple titanium leaders that are a stiff wire (single wire, minor flex), 9 inch, 100 lb, by Inhaler Tackle. Called a jerkbait leader. Is this what it says, maybe reeling straight in a husky jerk or other large jerkbait for musky or northerns? Won't it affect lure action? Thanks"
6481618,bthomas3333,2020-09-08 13:41:00,465,A lot of multiple strand leaders will get tangled up in a jerk bait when you sweep forward and then swing the rod back towards the bait on the stop. Single strand leaders are meant to stop the tangle on the stop when the lure darts back / sideways / whatever. My two cents anyway.I only use them in this application. I imagine some presentations would be a mess with one of these and some would be ok.Brett

They can be used with virtually any type of lure, but are especially effective when fishing jerk baits and gliders (e.g. Suicks, Bobby Baits, Mantas and the like). These lures are customarily fished in a stop/go or dive/rise fashion. These lures will keep pushing the single-strand wire leader out of the way on a pause, thus keeping the leaders from being fouled in the hooks.A down side of single strand leaders is that they can get kinked - most often when the fish is in the net. I haven't used titanium single strand leaders (yet) but suspect they will be more resistant to being kinked. Minor kinks can often be massaged out. Severely kinked leaders go into the recycle pile to reclaim rings, swivels and sometimes snaps.Another point to keep in mind when fishing single strand and multi-strand wire leaders is they can be heavy. If so, the leaders will weight down the nose of the lure, causing it to go through the water in a nose-heavy manner. Thus, I make my own single strand leaders in varying lengths and diameters of wire. I choose the length of leader that runs best with a given lure - most often five to seven inches in length.Good fishing and tight lines!!"

Solid SS wire is fairly stiff. Since the action on jerkbaits is imparted by the rod, you don't lose any action with a stiff leader but should actually gain some as the action is more easily transmitted through the solid wire vs. something more flexible.Flexible leaders can also tangle up more with a jerkbait.Single stranded titanium is not as stiff as solid SS wire (titanium has smaller diameter for a given test strength), but it's far more stiff than multi-stranded wire. Single stranded titanium will work reasonably well for jerkbaits, but I prefer the SS wire. I use single-strand titanium leaders for a lot of cast/retrieve fishing for pike. Multistrand for trolling and sometimes casting. Titanium wire is also far more expensive and harder to work with if you make your own leaders."

I was just surprised by how stiff the leader is...not just single strand, but it stands up on end and needs to be forced to bend and then springs back. I'll have to see what else is in my box that I don't know what it's for."

I have only ever seen the pre-made ones in the musky section. Anyway, that sounds like the type of leader I was referring to. It's a solid wire leader and probably almost as stiff as a really cheap wire coat hanger."
