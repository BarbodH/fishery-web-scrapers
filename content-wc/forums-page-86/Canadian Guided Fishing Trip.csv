6477088,Jquinn_7,2020-08-23 21:45:00,4,"Hello, Looking for any suggestions for a Guided Fishing Trip next year. Prefer a drive to destination to save on costs but would also consider a fly in. Fish type = Pike, walleye, and bass. Prefer America plan but could go with housekeeping plan if needed. Do not need a 5 star resort. Willing to go to Ontario or Manitoba. Group size is down to just 2 guys. I have been in the past to Shoal Lake, Pipestone Lake, and Separation Lake. if anyone has any questions about any of these lakes or lodges, please let me know. Thanks for any information- much appreciated. I Hope everyone is holding up and take care. JQuinn"

6477120,RichA$1970,2020-08-24 04:58:00,1159,Take a look at the thread on “How did your camp owner handle your refund” and there’s a ton to research.
6477124,Pooch,2020-08-24 05:10:00,4618,"Silver Water Wheel on Lac Seul has a good reputation and is located in one of the most productive parts of Lac Seul. I think it is all guided? Though I've not been there others here have and I've never heard anything bad about it.Just a thought when you mentioned Pike, Bass and Walleye.Pooch"
6477138,The tank,2020-08-24 06:30:00,340,Witchy camp is a good choice. Its on lake of the woods. Obibikon Bay lodge is also a good choice. Its a boat in but they'll come get you. We stay not too from them in milesbay. Haven't stayed at either place cause I don't do American plan or use a guide thats all part of the trip for me. Grassy narrows is also one I would suggest. Stayed with Wayne a few years back and did house keeping. One day he offered us to eat with the American plan cabins and the food was awesome.
6477142,eyecatcher1,2020-08-24 06:40:00,323,When I first started going to NW Ontario I went to Anderson's Lodge in Sioux Lookout. They fish Lac Seul as well as other lakes in the area for the fish that you are looking for. They do housekeeping and American Plan and are very good at it.
6477166,Duflebag,2020-08-24 08:25:00,218,"JGuinn, i have been going to Northwinds Canadian Outfitters for 32 years now. Family owned in Vermilion Bay, NW Ontario. American plan and fishing in a boat with a guide every day. A fishing camp for fishermen. Every day you can fish a different lake. After breakfast you ride in a full size Ram pickup to the lake you are fishing that day towing a 20 foot Alumacraft Competitor. If you want walleyes you can fish Lac Seul. If you want muskies you can go for numbers on Indian or Cedar or a fish of a lifetime on Eagle Lake. Smallmouths on a lake where you can put 150 in the boat every day. casting for big pike on Clay. One of the problems i have experienced at camps on one lake is that you are tied to that lake. The species that live there and if fishing is good. Northwinds gives me the ability to change up where i go. I would highly recommend it. Mom Munford does the coooking and her boys are your guides. Brad Munford and Ken Gauthier are by far two of the best guides in the Vermilion Bay, Eagle Lake area. www.northwindsoutfitters.comhttps://www.facebook.com/northwindsoutfitters"
6477216,GBS,2020-08-24 10:09:00,2271,"Check out Grass River Lodge - https://grassriverlodge.com/ Near(ish) Flin-Flon. Drive to, but only resort on the big lake. You get a guide for the entire time of your stay. They supply the boats. Full meals. Shore lunch included. Free open bar Happy Hour before dinner. Morning coffee delivered to your cabin. Ike, the owner, spends time at dinner going from table-to-table, asking about the day, and encouraging everyone to talk about what and where worked, and what didn't. Primary emphasis is on very big Northern. Mine was 52"". Ones in the low 40's very, very common - several a day. Usually a couple mid-40's or higher a day. Walleye fishing as you want, but usually done no more than 1/2 hr before shore lunch. He also offers same day fly-outs (using his own aircraft) to smaller private lakes, if you want to try for your 100 walleye day. Lake has huge population of lakers, too. As usual, early season for them is best."

6477438,BornToFish,2020-08-25 06:36:00,1224,"Greetings,Stormer Lake Lodge will satisfy the requirements of the original poster. At least several guys on this forum have been to Stormer Lake Lodge. I submitted a few trip reports on this forum that can be found with a simple search.Stormer Lake Lodge is located about fifty miles north of Red Lake, Ontario. It is a drive-to lodge that has the feel of a fly-in. It is the only lodge on two lakes. The lodge is American Plan only. Guiding service is available for those that want a guide. Three of the cabins are designed to accommodate two guests.The lodge is usually booked tight for the upcoming fishing season by mid-winter. This, along with the upset from the border being closed for the entire fishing season, it might be best to contact whatever lodges interest the original poster before too long.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
