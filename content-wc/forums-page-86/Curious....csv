6485120,gordy28,2020-09-19 06:37:00,437,"We did our trip with Slate Falls Outposts near the end of August out of Sioux Lookout Having never been there before I can't really bench mark but I would say it was not a ghost town. Chatting with Ryan at Slate Falls and some of the Slate Falls Air staff they mentioned that its on the lakes where you notice the difference (as someone else mentioned). We have been lucky enough to be at the cottage a few times this summer. Its located between Orillia and Gravenhurst. Biggest thing I have noticed is that Highway 400/11 seemed to be packed with people heading to camp, RV, fish etc. Lots of articles in the news here about how the pandemic has driven a huge increase in RV sales, camping and fishing gear, cottage rentals etc. People stuck in the city, social distancing, not a lot of travel options has equaled more people spending time doing staycations in Ontario. Gut says that this probably only impacts area's within a few hours or so of major cities as opposed to really making up for cross border tourists is ""true"" northern towns like Wawa, Little Vermillion, Sioux Lookout, Nakina, Armstrong and others. If you are in the Toronto area its a long haul to get to those area's for a long weekend or even a week. Really hope 2021 is back to being a regular season for all of the lodges"

6480502,Eckohlt,2020-09-04 14:12:00,3685,Glenn you didn't mention how the fishing was?
6480736,gmattbruin,2020-09-05 10:24:00,174,"Hey, fishing was fantastic. Ill admit the #s werent the same as mid June, post spawn, but still amazing. Avg June per boat each day is 125-150 walleye. Last week Aug we found it about 80-100 each boat/day. Still good #s. It was a big surprise to see the water levels down 4-5ft, not exaggerating. Its funny how when you go each yr at a specific time, eg mid June, you think you know a body or water. But until you experience it all yr round or another time of yr, you get a wake up call. We found many rock piles, shoals,etc that we never knew existed. Those are now marked and will come in handy come net June. Fish size on Aba was the same as June for walleye and mostly smaller for pike. But we did not target pike in any way, all accidental catches. Last week of Aug has now been added to the list and will be our 2nd trip each yr. No bugs was the biggest bonus i must say....really was treat."

6480452,Hook_settr,2020-09-04 12:24:00,127,"The camp I have been going to for a while now has been providing updates on Facebook on a regular basis this summer. Mostly repairs and improvements that they are making around camp with a post about the weather mixed in. It's kind of a double edged sword to see those posts. It's nice to see camp, the things they are doing to improve/maintain the camp and some connection with the camp owners but on the other hand, it's a cold reminder that I don't get to go to my happy place and that the camp owners are struggling through a difficult season. I'm trying to remain hopeful that the border will open in early 2021 but I have this nagging feeling....."
6480466,prov1800,2020-09-04 13:03:00,5010,Maybe Nov Rod.Be real cool and frosty but last few falls have been decent.
6480470,gmattbruin,2020-09-04 13:07:00,174,"Another thought on the idea that there isnt much updated website info. We just returned form our trip outta Nakina, Cordingley with twin Lakes. It was a postponed trip from our annual June trip. This area is a ghost town. Very little activity and id say very limited outfitters operating. TLO, CHad and his wife got up there and opened a few lakes for Ontario customers. But to the lack of website activity.....i know a lot of his time has been taken up with flying into his camps and working on them. So he is taking advantage of the ""free"" time and doing some positive work. They and maybe some others were limited on who could come north and cross the border, eg not ALL family members who normally come to aid and help the full operation are or were able to do so. So everything is limited, if operating at all. Maybe when the season is over there will be more updating for 2021. I also think many operators realize there are these chat groups and we tend to beat topics to death with updates and thoughts. just a few pov ."
6479956,Pooch,2020-09-03 07:46:00,4618,"Browsing various camp websites I've not seen one mention of border cancellations or any ""Pep"" talks concerning roll overs or any news about the camp like on going projects or just in general what might be going on around the camp. If anything. Even an occasional fishing report keeps customers interest fueled. People who stay in camps for years become ""vested"" in a weird way to the camps and are concerned or interested in it and the owners well being. People get ""connected"" to camps on an emotional level. Kind of a home away from home thing or a ""safe and quiet"" place away from the crazy out there. Barring anything else happening, I'm really enthusiastic about 2021. I can't imagine it being anything but bountiful and very busy for camp owners. Also, I don't want to wish my life away, but I wish it was June 2021 instead of fall 2020. The wait will be worth it... Pooch Keep the faith brothers..."
6479960,stjoeguy,2020-09-03 07:50:00,979,Amen!
6479976,Huntindave,2020-09-03 08:21:00,2194,"Pooch, I suspect very little is going on, even fishing. I would imagine anything that cost money, like fuel for the boat, is limiting even the camp owners and their family. I myself have sometimes walked down to my local river and fish from shore when I didn't have the funds to take the boat out. Right now I have two fishing boats, one a bit fancier than the other. The ""other"" boat is a 15 footer with a 2cycle 25hp tiller motor and a transom trolling motor. I have a HDS7 for electronics. No live well, no rod holders, not even a cup holder. I sit on a bucket seat that does swivel and has a back support. Even so, day in and day out, this is the boat, one will most likely find me fishing from. I do understand what you are saying about ""keeping customers interest up"". From what I have seen, many (not all) resorts could do a much better job with their web pages."
6479980,Skywagon,2020-09-03 08:35:00,1106,"Not to pump you up pooch, but I heard an interesting factoid at a meeting last night. The operator of a large tourist camp on Eagle Lake estimated that in a normal year their camp used 12000 walleye for shore lunches. Combine that with the amount of fish taken home by guests and compound that with the number of tourist camps on Eagle lake amounts to a lot of walleye still swimming around. I know you fish Lac Seul, but the percentages are probably similar, with that said, it would seem your odds of catching more fish next year should be improved."
6479988,pjshorthorn,2020-09-03 08:45:00,5654,"Pooch,Check out VBay Gord’s website. https://vermilionbaylodge.com/ He puts a blog out every month and addresses all the things you asked about......especially this year. Maybe a smaller lodge, but he does keep his customers informed very well, whether it be by a blog, email or phone calls.I am looking forward to 2021 as well.......just to get back into the “normal” fishing adventure experience in Canada . One of those trips will definitely be visiting Lord Gord again. PjShorthorn"

6480030,Habitual Eyer,2020-09-03 10:39:00,144,"I hear ya Pooch, After all the threads regarding relationships with Camp Owners and how we may be just dollars... I really disagree. They need to make money off me to stay afloat but I have built some strong friendships with many owners who's Camps I frequented many times. Some guest may not....but some may not be able to connect with anyone I surmise. Couple I have talked to have been fishing alot simply cuase its cheap entertainment right out their door in a time when funds aren't aplenty. They don't get much time to fish during a normal season so I imagine many are taking advantage of this weird time. GullRock and Red have become my second home and not only hope to get back next summer....but somehow partially retire up there in a few years. Great waters and after learning this beautiful and large expanse it seems most places I stop this is what my graph shows (gotta love Chirp technology). Here's hoping next year is a **** sight better than this year !!!"
