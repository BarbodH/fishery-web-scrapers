6479448,heritage2008,2020-09-01 13:30:00,92,"Looking for information on the quality of fishing in this lake. Not the further west Hawk Lake. This is located by the town Hawk Junction. I know that Whitefish and others are close by but I am being drawn to this lake for multiple reasons. Does not look like there are any lodges on this lake. I have fished the French and Pickerel Rivers, Gowganda, Zec Dumonine in Quebec and all over Ohio. Yes, having a fly out business there is also interesting for those further north lakes. So, have you fished it--when, for which species? Retirement is May 31st so we are looking for a place to call home in the summer. We have a DP Class A which we plan on traveling over the next 2 years and then finding something more permanent for fishing in the summer/fall. Thanks all, David and Dee"
6479508,Wawajake,2020-09-01 16:39:00,413,"I assume you realize there is a town of 200 people on this lake and various cottages and Hawk Air runs a commercial airline ( mostly Beaver planes) to support fishing outposts and logging and mining company fly in needs.( I used HawkAir a dozen years ago to help scout for fire ban infractions) A secondary highway runs along side lake too. This is not my definition of a "" remote"" lake ....admitedly I have never fished it , but when I saw it back then it had too many private and Hawkair planes landing and taking off to ever want to fish it serenely."
6479532,heritage2008,2020-09-01 18:48:00,92,Guess I will have to look into air traffic on the lake. Did reach out to Rodney at the campground on the lake and he didn't mention that plane traffic was that big of an issue. I fished the Pickerel river system and there were 2 companies within 3 miles of each other and did not affect my fishing. A town of 200 people can't be an issue either. You ever fish Erie in the summer--dodging boats all the time. Sure its not deep Ontario or Quebec but we are trying not to drive 20 hours to camp either.
6479562,MrSimon,2020-09-01 19:51:00,922,Sounds like you should plan a trip all around Ontario next summer in that big RV and check out a dozen different lakes & campgrounds. Personally I wouldn't put Hawk Lake real high on the list of places I'd want to park at for an extended amount of time.
6479780,heritage2008,2020-09-02 13:29:00,92,Any reason why not? Have you fished the lake?
6479782,heritage2008,2020-09-02 13:30:00,92,Found some land on the SE part of the lake--looking to get out of Rving.
6479968,MrSimon,2020-09-03 08:05:00,922,"No, I haven't fished it .... for all the reasons mentioned above. It gets a lot of pressure, isn't remote, and has a bunch of airplane traffic. Even if the fishing is fine, I personally wouldn't want to spend much time there because of those reasons. Again, that's just my opinion. But I'd really recommend doing some legwork in the area before buying land."
6480406,heritage2008,2020-09-04 10:51:00,92,If I drove to dog lake I'd rather fish the other Hawk Lake. Trying to find a cabin to purchase. Have not heard about a lot of pressure on the lake I am talking about. Talked with a camp owner and he said the exact opposite for lake pressure.
