6477946,IowaWalleye1978,2020-08-27 08:08:00,96,Just booked a week at flag in september our group as never fished the US side of the angle we will be going after walleye and muskie any tips would be appreciated!!!
6478342,Net_Man,2020-08-28 20:53:00,580,"Jig and minnow, jig and plastic as well as spinners will take walleyes. It is hard to go wrong with a jig and frozen shiner. Orange or pink jig head should get the job done but frequently I have a plain lead (unpainted) jig head tied on. But on trips I have made in fall in recent years my fishing partner has out fished me with Rapala Jigging Raps on several days. I would suggest that you bring a few of these along in size 7 to try out. I would suggest chrome red for my first choice of colors for LOTW. Good luck"

You can always find some fish jigging but the Minnesota side does lend itself to pulling spinners and trolling, and most of the guys I have talked to have been doing that more than jigging. Overall the fishing has been pretty good. T"
6479074,Lazy Fisherman,2020-08-31 11:30:00,276,"Because of the border closure, is Flag Island a boat in resort?"
6479182,txk4,2020-08-31 19:00:00,31,"That is correct. To get to the Angle, you have to boat from the south shore and stay in Minnesota. You can only fish in Minnesota also. It is about an 1 to 1 1/2 hour trip instead of a 10 minute trip from Young's Bay if you could drive thru Canada. Wind and weather will influence your trip heavily. Lake of the Woods Passenger service out of Sportsman's Lodge is available to take you across if you are not bringing your own boat. Our Sept. visit to Flag Island will be our third trip up this summer. Better than sitting at home. I know this is not really a Canadian discussion (except concerning the border closure) and would be glad to answer any questions on personal message if that is preferable. T"
6479376,Lazy Fisherman,2020-09-01 10:56:00,276,Thanks T. I was wondering how people were getting there.
6479706,wmd,2020-09-02 09:50:00,388,Flag Island is in the US and can be accessed by water never leaving the US. Customs doesn't come into play on water. wmd
6479832,IowaWalleye1978,2020-09-02 17:02:00,96,Yes you have to boat in from the US side...praying for good weather so we can get there!
