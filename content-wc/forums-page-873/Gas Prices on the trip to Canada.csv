531608,Guest,2003-05-27 19:09:00,0,"I always hate it when I go some place and find out the gas was cheaper down the road. Who has the cheapest prices in the Duluth/Superior area?Thanks!PS - I know I should just kick back, spend the money and forget about cost."
531609,bigfish1965,2003-05-27 19:25:00,3210,"Dude, gas prices are changing here by the hour. Any info you get now will be obsolete by tomorrow. Expect to pay around 60 cents per litre. With exchange etc it is .60 X 3.8 (litres to US gallon) X .74 (exchange Can to US) which is about 1.68 US dollars for a US gallon. Without the drastic changes to the US dollar recently, it would have been much cheaper for you."
531610,Guest,2003-05-27 20:34:00,0,"The price of gas should be one of the cheapest parts of the trip. You shouldn't let that bother you or you can't afford to go to Canada. Drop a few bucks in Canada, they can use the help in their economy too."
531611,Trailerguy,2003-05-28 08:43:00,1407,"If it's anything like going through International Falls, top off at least a 75 miles south of the border. The stations know they have you, the prices are as much as 15 cents a gallon higher."
531612,jcd,2003-05-28 09:06:00,185,"Last week when we were in Canada, the gas in International Falls was not much different than the rest in Minnesota and even Iowa. Paid $1.48/9 in International Falls Holiday station. Most stations in Fort Frances was $.77/9 per liter. Vermillion Bay corner station was $.75/9 per liter. Cheapest gas in Canada during our trip was a Husky station in Dryden at $.73/9."
531613,Trailerguy,2003-05-28 10:24:00,1407,"You must have come through later in the weekend and missed the $1.59 gas prices at International Falls, even the Conoco south of town was $1.57 Thursday night."
531614,Xplorer,2003-05-28 10:51:00,244,"Gas was $1.50 from duluth to Orr yesterday, very little fluctuation.Xplorer"
531615,Guest,2003-05-28 11:30:00,0,I live in Ontario and today gas is at 69.5 cents a litre...that's roughly about $1.75US per gallon. As was said earlier...the prices change every 5 minutes. It can get as low as 58 cents per litre and as high as 85 cents...every time I gas up it's like going to Vegas...it's a gamble to say the least.
531616,Guest,2003-05-28 17:00:00,0,"If you think that is bad, I paid $3.85 per gallon for aviation gas in International Falls a year ago last January. That was about a dollar more than any place along the way. Business must have been slow."
531617,Guest,2003-05-29 12:38:00,0,"If gasing your boat in Canada, be prepared to dig deep. Was being charged .99 Can. per liter at the only gas dock within reach. Thats about 2.75 US per gallon."
