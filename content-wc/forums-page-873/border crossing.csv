531508,ackermannsacre,2003-05-25 09:52:00,196,Nothing has changed. Here is a site that has regulations going both ways.<a href=http://travel.state.gov/tips_canada.html>
531509,Guest,2003-05-25 10:01:00,0,Just got back. No problems. Just need a license. We were the only ones at the border at 11am on a Saturday.
531510,663,2003-05-25 11:02:00,15,Just got back and crossing into Canada was easy. Due to Orange alert the crossing back into the states took a little longer....they were looking into each vehicle and using detectors around each boat as well as a mirror to look under boats and vehicles. Also asked if we had meat purchased in Canada...said if we did they would have to confiscate due to Mad Cow problem.
531511,Guest,2003-05-26 20:37:00,0,"Going into Canada was no problem. Coming back they will want to look into your car trunk or topper so leave it unlocked. One guard was asking questions while another looked over the vehicle. After exiting the guard shack we had to pull under a boom where they x-ray'd the boat. We came through about 9 am Saturday and there was not much of a line but I expect it will get worse as there were not many people in most camps last week. No beef or lamb due to mad cow desease, if you purchased a cheese burger at McDonalds to eat while you wait in line make sure it is gone before you get to the guard shack as you can't take whats left into the US."

Comin back a quick light inspection of van luggage compartment,no big deal. Seemed more of a profiling exercise than anything. Very polite courtious treatment on both sides."
