I see that they're getting some rain right now, but I imagine it's too little, too late. What a change from a year ago. All it did was rain. I'd appreciate any words of wisdom you might have to offer on the water levels!!"

531672,Guest,2003-05-30 05:49:00,0,"Bill:We go to the Silver Water Wheel Lodge which is in central part of Lac Seul. This will be the fifth year in a row, same time every year. LS is terrific fishery. Despite the size, its not that hard of a lake to fish, but it does help to either have a guide or spend a few days with one because of the size of the lake. Just read a e-mail from the resort we are going to and the fishing was good this May, very good from the sounds of it. Conditions in a week will not vary from this week unless they get lots of rain between now and then. From experience and from the resort's email, there are two bites going right now. (1) The shallow water bite, which is a strong tradition in spring on LS. Find the right combination of shallows with deeper water close, the right amount of wind pounding the shore and the walleyes move in very shallow. At times in the past we pitched jigs (3/8 in pink with white 4"" curly tails) right into the shoreline (1 foot of water) and the walleyes would be there. What is fun about this bite is usually you expect this to be the little aggressive males, but the LS standard fish is a solid 18"" with lots of plus 20"" up to the upper 20's pretty consistenty. While a walleye does not fight like a bass or even a northern, a 25 - 29 walleye in a foot of water will put up a nice tussle. The second bite which has aways been strong is the spinner with minnow on a bottom bouncer. That bite traditional for us happens as you move into the summer, but this year with the low water it sounds like its stronger this year then in the past. I know everybody has their favorite color in spinners and jigs and frankly I think you own confidence is more important than the actually color, but for me I almost always have only three colors of spinners, hammered gold, hammered silver and fire tiger. However, have a bunch because you never know. One year it was blue that outfished everything. Go figure, what is blue in the water?Northerns like northerns everywhere are not fussy. Hit any bay with weeds and you should find them. However, the back bay skinny water bite is just about over. The warm weather and low water they have had have pushed the big mammas back into the summer haunts. Thus, you will likey catch as many northerns while your backtrolling spinners as you would through hardward into the shallows. My advice if you want northerns next week is hit the early summer haunts already as I will bet they have slid back to the 10 - 15 and maybe even 20 foot range. The shallows will still have plenty of smaller northerns which are fun to catch on the right equipment, but the upper 30"" pike will likely have move a bit deeper.The central part of LS is just now getting some fish and they should be starting to think about bedding up. Remember to let every bass go as they are great fish to catch and LS is just getting a good population.Have a great trip. Have to run, let me know if you want more info. IA Walleye"

531665,Guest,2003-05-29 05:57:00,0,"Alsn, be prepared for a little construction slowdown on I-90 in the Beloit area. I came through there on Tuesday afternoon and it added about 45 minutes to my trip home from MN. Good luck on the fishing! We'll be at Lac Seul the following week."
531669,Guest,2003-05-29 11:08:00,0,That anticipation is what keeps us young at heart and spirit. Share the excitement with a young person and the joy is greater. When the joy is gone so is life.
531666,Hammerhead Herb,2003-05-29 13:25:00,259,Heading to Ear Falls on Sun and then flying out on Mon. How was the detour on 53 in Duluth? Does the detour bring you back so that you are going past Gander Mtn.?
531667,Guest,2003-05-29 16:20:00,0,"Bill, where you going on Lac Suel. Our group will be there June 5 - 12. With the water being down 6 - 8 feet this year, it will be a new experience. A week to go and I cannot sleep...."
531670,Guest,2003-05-29 16:35:00,0,"My Dad and I don't go to Canada for another 4 months and we're allready antsy. We're getting tackle and gear in order now! I think it's still a little too early to start packing the truck, don't you? Good luck to Al and everyone heading north. Have a safe trip. And let us know how ya made out when ya return."
