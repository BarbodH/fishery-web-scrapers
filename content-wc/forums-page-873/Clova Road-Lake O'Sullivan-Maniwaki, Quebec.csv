Water is down in some of the areas - not sure about O'Sullivan, haven't talked to anyone who has been in.If you do get low water the fishing will be even better."

531646,Guest,2003-05-29 10:24:00,0,Didn't you hear? They paved the Clova Road.
531647,Guest,2003-05-29 18:16:00,0,yea right
531648,Guest,2003-05-29 19:50:00,0,"as well as paving the clova road, they put in a macdonalds at the reast stop at mile post 75, oh yes and a car wash- seriously- the road has not been to bad the last couple of years- 3 3/4 hrs from the paved road to clova - good luck"

531650,Guest,2003-05-30 12:12:00,0,Great news about the paving and Walmart/McDonalds. I suppose O'Sullivan's ruined now because of the access.
