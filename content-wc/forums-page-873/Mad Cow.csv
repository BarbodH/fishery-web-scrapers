531448,Karl,2003-05-23 19:40:00,63,I can't see fishing with (or near) a cow - mad or not.
531449,Guest,2003-05-30 06:40:00,0,"Well here we go. It finally has happened.In every lake across Canada and probably the World we have a new disease.I was fishin the tuther day and caught some very nice Northern Pike. All over 10 lbs to manybe around 15. Nice looking fish too. BUT...When I released every last one of them, they gave me ""The Tail"" and splashed water all over me, and the friends I had with me. ""The Tail is a fishes version of ""The human finger"" I guess.Could this be ""MAD FISH DISEASE?"" The same thing seems to be happening with smallmouth bass too. I caught a few of these too and they too seemed really MAD when I took them out of the water to remove the hook. They too gave me ""The tail"" and just swam off without so much as a how do you do, and thank YOU too.YUP- Me thinks it is that same ole disease - ""Mad Fish Disease""All resorts have a varied menu. Pork, chicken, turkey, etc. How many will serve beef this summer I do not know, but I bet they all will here in NW ONtario. Remember we are 1200 miles FROM Toronto.If this is all I have to worry about after three strokes, and a heart attack, I consider myself lucky.;)"
531438,Guest,2003-05-22 08:50:00,0,Is this a concern to anybody going to Canada or do all the lodges just eat fish. It has made my wife nervous as a ******* in church. I am not really concerned at this point but am paying attention to any news on the subject. Right now it seems like a lot to do about nothing. We really don't need any more things to concern us.

Fish, chicken, pork...there are many alternatives.The Canada trip is all about enjoyment and relaxation...not worry and anxiety.As the old line from the Mel Brooks movie states:""Let a coo'...let the coolness into your vertabrae."""
531442,McQ,2003-05-22 09:04:00,615,"It has been found in one cow out of 13,000,000 - not hard to figure out the odds. You almost stand a better chance to win a lottery. Too bad the media needs this type of fodder to make headlines. So far 3 herds have been quarantined and the investigation relative to the disease source is on a fast track. Early estimates are the answers will be published within 2 weeks.This disease has a long incubation period up to 8 years - controls on the feed source that is attributed to the disease were put in place three years ago.Point of interest - the UK situation was so blown out of proportion it actually forced the economy close to bankruptcy on the initial scientific so called ""Evidence"". Madcow was supposed to cause an epidemic that would exceed the aids crisis. Well so far, a decade summary of deaths equate to 100 people, while not a pleasant thing 10 people a year were infected and died. How does that relate to deaths from the commom flu bugs we all suffer through the course of a year?The disease is concentrated in the animals brain tissues and can only be transmitted to those humans who consume sweetbreads. When's the last time any of us has partaken of this so called delicacy."

531444,BobG-IL,2003-05-22 19:57:00,7,"Two Illinois cows were overheard talking about just this topic the other day; One cow said to the other, ""I'm really worried about that Mad Cow case they found in Canada. What if it comes our way?"" The second cow replied, ""Aahh, I ain't worried...it don't bother us penguins.""I'm more worried about the 1500 mile round-trip drive than SARS or Mad Cow."
531445,winchester70,2003-05-22 20:46:00,0,Q. Why do they call it Mad Cow Disease ?A. because PMS was already taken !!Q. What's the difference between PMS and a pit bull?A. Just the lipstick !!

531447,Guest,2003-05-23 15:51:00,0,"I live in Ontario and have NO FEAR whatsoever. First of all, the majority of beef sold in Ontario is Ontario Beef or USA beef. If I lived in Alberta there might be cause to worry but if you are planning on a trip to Ontario I wouldn't worry about it. Besides, there is an upside...$2.00 T-bones in August...yum-yum"
