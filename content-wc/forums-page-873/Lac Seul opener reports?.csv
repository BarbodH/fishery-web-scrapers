531187,anie hankslaben,2003-05-18 06:58:00,1,"i was wondering the same thing, just maybe the eyes went to the beach, with no water left in the lake, hey?"
531188,Arkie eye jerker,2003-05-18 07:20:00,228,This one sounds good.http://www.justfishontario.com/_disc26/0000005d.htm
531189,Guest,2003-05-18 09:40:00,0,"Fantastic, at the Ear falls end. 10 lb walleye in 1/2 hr of fishing.Even the green horns limited out. Some nice pike action too.I'm sure the whole lake is is producing some nice fish."
531190,Guest,2003-05-19 20:18:00,0,"I fished south-central Lac Seul until yesterday. Walleye action was good by opener standards. We had plenty of fish in the 4-9lb range, with good volume for the smaller eyes as well. Water temperatures raised dramatically last week due to four consecutive sunny days, resulting in surface temperature in the 50-60 degree range for most shallow areas. The water level remains extremely low, and the fish have been quickly on the move. We caught walleyes in post-spawn feeding areas, but also in transition and even late-transition locations. It's possible the low water caused many of these fish to attempt spawning on suitable main lake structure, and whence they are feeding in nearby suitable areas. Most were caught on jigs and twister tails, pitching in shallow (2-6') or dragging under the boat (6-12'), while some were hooked on standard bottom bouncing-spinner rigs. A warm front came through yesterday and a weak cold front came through last night. Heavy north winds were present when I left this morning. The cold front may slow the fishing (it often does) and may result in more fish returning to shallower, warmer areas. Usually the day after the cold front is slowest for fish numbers (i.e., tomorrow), whence I am returning tomorrow night to be back out for Wednesday morning. It looks like the spring season should yeild more trophy walleye fishing on Lac Seul, at least it seems that way thus far.Jay"
531191,Jigger1,2003-05-20 11:24:00,234,"Jay,You better be teaching the newbie's all the tricks of the trade. I'll miss not seeing you up there this year and wish you all the best in your endeavors. I have no doubt you'll succeed with whatever you set your mind to. Our group is a short 39 days away from our first Lac Seul walleye. Jigging rod is already warmed up and the new bottom-bouncing rig is ready to be broke in. Hoping to break the 30Â” barrier this year!Take care,Jigger1"
531192,Guest,2003-05-20 12:15:00,0,"Jigger1,The new guys are becoming more proficient by the day. They should certainly be in good form by the time you arrive. I am headed back up there today to train tomorrow and Thursday, then guide Friday to Sunday. I am being worked in and out of the ""line-up"" throughout the season, whenever an extra guy is required. That said . . . you may see me up there after all this year when you come up. As it turns out, you will see Glen again too. He changed his mind yet again! I bet you are already having sleepless nights thinking about your trip! The first full fishing report should be forthcoming in the next couple days. I will give you a new analysis when I get back to the office next Monday. I bet YOU wouldn't mind being able to drive up to Lac Seul in a couple hours . . .Jay"
531193,Jigger1,2003-05-20 14:09:00,234,"Jay,I have a couple choice words for you and they're not Happy Birthday! You know it's not fair to rub that one in, however I will be fishing this weekend just not on Lac Seul. I hope to be catching smallies this weekend, they were popping opening weekend and I landed several 18 - 19"" smallies. Walleye's should be moving out to their usual haunts so I'll be on the early evening hunt for them. This lake is clear as drinking water so low light rules. Did Glen show you the photo (silhouette) I took of him fishing at sunset? I call it ""the guide"" and have it framed on my desk., it's awesome! Ask Mike if he has my email address at camp and send me an email next week. Say hello to everyone for me. Jigger1 - or BillP.S. - Yes - yes - I would love to be two hours away!"

531195,Jigger1,2003-05-29 16:39:00,234,"Well Jay - where is the analysis? Did you get my contact information from Mike? Walleye fishing was slow, but the smallmouth action was great, caught and released a 20.5"" smallmouth on Sunday, my daughter caught a 19"" - what a rush!Take care,Jigger1"
