531283,rpieske,2003-05-23 17:08:00,1276,"I can't help you with walleye fishing at night on LOTW, but muskie fishing at night can be outstanding during the hot dog days. I used to night fish almost every night and had very good success. Haven't done it in recent years...must be getting old. I would not encourage anyone to night fish on LOTW this year with the low water unless you are REALLY familiar with the lake."
531284,Guest,2003-05-29 16:33:00,0,"Probably correct on driving at 45 miles per hour. I could go faster though. I have been on this body of water for over 20 years. and I can and have ran from Kenora to Crow Rock Island in pitch dark. Had to as I had to work the next day.Fishing at night here on LOTW never has been all that popular. Not sure why. When I did guide, we would go out from maybe 7:00 until dark. After that the owner wanted us in. I travel a lot at night however as I find it very relaxing. No idiots so to speak. You would be surprised how many are out their not knowing where they are, nor where they are going to begin with and in big expensive yaghts.But as for fishing right in what many consider a main run is just asking for trouble. As ya never know when I or someone else who is experienced on this lake is really cruising around.Take care, buy a light."
531272,Guest,2003-05-19 15:55:00,0,Can you night fish from either a boat or shore on Lake of the Woods? Or is there a night fishing ban as there is on Eagle Lake?
531273,PASSION 4 THE EYES,2003-05-19 19:15:00,5,"I HAVE NVER HEARD OF A NIGHT FISHING BAN, ALSO NOT MUCH NITEFISHING GOING ON ALMOST NON. THE LAKE IS VERY STAINED/COFFEECOLORED!!!"
531274,Guest,2003-05-19 20:01:00,0,"You can fish at anytime you wish on Lake of the Woods. However as the one message did say not many really fish at night.One thing, if you do, please have a light on the boat. I know that sounds stupid even to mention, but being a guide on this lake, you would be surprised on how many people will sit on a reef in a main run, and fish without a darn light. I have on more than one occasion nearly ran them over. I at one time had to pick up guests for a resort at night. I used lights but I was also going around 45 in a cruiser. I only saw the guy as he was flicking his lighter. I will not say, what I said when I abruptly turned around to talked to him.He was not their on my return trip.

531275,Eric,2003-05-19 20:38:00,114,Driving a boat at 45 mph at night is not responsible. Please be more careful. Eric
531276,Guest,2003-05-19 22:49:00,0,the rules require one white light on for anchored boats at night. and dont anchor in main stream.
531277,Guest,2003-05-20 06:12:00,0,"Well, Ron, it is GOOD you chewed that guy out. You probably saved his life."
531278,Guest,2003-05-20 09:38:00,0,"Thanks guys...probably wont fish from boat much past sunset. But might just wet a line at night while by the campfire,assuming no burning restrictions exists at the time. Was concerned because when we were on Eagle a few years ago,was advised could not fish after sunset,even from shore. Thanks again."
531279,Guest,2003-05-22 21:41:00,0,we have been to eagle lake in the past and never heard that. Is this something new. I know the boats the lodges give you dont have any lights on them and now the law has progressed to canada about having lights on after dark so people dont run over each other. No lights on the boats you have to be back at the camp dock by sunset or someone is in heep big trouble. Next time the rates go up for the boats it will be to have night lights installed on the boats.
531280,Guest,2003-05-23 07:38:00,0,You can buy battery operated bow and stern lights that clamp on. Not expensive either.
531281,walleyedude,2003-05-23 09:11:00,34,Actually there has been a night fishing ban on Eagle for about 8 years now.It was done at the request of the lodge owners and cottagers on the lake.
