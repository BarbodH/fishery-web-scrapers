Also, I am considering buying some crawlers (in the commercial bedding) to bring too. Any thoughts on those for walleye vs using leaches? Thanks. We leave next Friday!!!!!!!!!"

531494,phishfearme,2003-05-29 13:54:00,1242,hey rebel - i gave up freezing minnows years ago - they're a pain to keep frozon and fall apart after thawing way too fast. do a search on salting minnows or preserving minnows a chack out the borax recipe. you'll never mess with frozon minnows again. phish
