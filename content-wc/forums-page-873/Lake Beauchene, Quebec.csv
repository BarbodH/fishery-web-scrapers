531245,nemio,2003-05-28 12:25:00,96,I agree with you Mickey stay as far as possible from Canadians & specially Quebec everybody will be thankfull and we will fished peacefully without your bright presence and your free mind.Bye!!!
531246,Guest,2003-05-28 13:22:00,0,stayed at beauchene 4 years ago. Nice place and good fishing but not great. Way overpriced and not good bang for your buck.
531247,T Bone,2003-05-28 14:19:00,18,Thanks for the on-topic info Jim. As for the other stuff...entertaining reading but a complete waste of time to debate.
531248,5Paulie4,2003-05-29 02:39:00,34,"I guess Mickey doesn't get it. One of the beautiful things about tripping up to Quebec to fish is the absence of politics and enjoying a unique opportunity to escape the crap that makes living in the real world such a drag. For at least one week the ignorance of our governments is put on the back burner and for one week the most important question we'll need to ask is: ""Which color lure should I tie on my line today?"" When considering where to take my annual fishing trip, borders and politics matter nothing at all. I only want seclusion, clean water, cold beer and the opportunity to feel a tight line. Thunderstick"
531249,Rob,2003-05-29 15:51:00,103,"Why go into Quebec at all? Come to Ontario, much more friendly and all the signs are in english.Quebec doesn't need the business, they get 79% of the Canadian Tax money allocated to all the provinces in Canada.Ever wonder why most contests exclude Quebec?I agree with micky on the pm, thank god our next leader won't be from Quebec."
531250,Trophymuskie,2003-05-30 06:22:00,254,Martin wich is our next leader is from Montreal. LOL Keep releasing them allRichard Collinhttp://www.trophymuskiecharters.com
531251,Rob,2003-05-30 14:30:00,103,Who said Martin is going to win?I won't be voting Liberal in the next election.
531252,McQ,2003-05-30 14:32:00,615,Nemio - - - wait for me
531253,Trophymuskie,2003-05-30 15:23:00,254,Rob wake up LOL the Liberals have a 55% support rate as of right now. As long as you have 4 other parties spliting the votes the Liberals will never be defeated. If it ever gets back down to only two ( Conservatives and New Democrats ) then the Liberals will have their work cut out for them but as long as the new parties stay there it will never happen. Well not in my lifetime that's for sure.Keep releasing them allRichard Collinhttp://www.trophymuskiecharters.com
531254,Rob,2003-05-30 19:23:00,103,"I agree Musky, but Liberals win in Ontario, and Ontario alone.It doesn't matter what the rest of Canada thinks, Ontario makes or breaks it when it comes to elections.We will see what the feds do about the latest bout of Sars and the softwood deal, lets also not forget about the 1 Billion + Gun registry that has been wasted for nothing.Come election time its a whole new ballgame.I remember when the provincial liberals in Ontario had a 62% lead and they went to the polls, the day after election the NDP were in power.No more Liberal for me."
531235,T Bone,2003-05-21 05:41:00,18,"Yeah...I realize that $1350.00 US is a fair amount of scratch for a week of fishing. I'm sure my better half would have more to say about it than that. However, like many things in life, I believe you get what you pay for and that includes quality fishing opportunities. We have checked into many different trips including Wollaston Lake, Sakatchewan...Bolton Lake, Manitoba...Knee Lake, Manitoba...and Gunisao Lake, Manitoba. Big fish and lots of them, all day, everyday, but you pay about $3,000.00 US for that assurance. I'm not sure being a big-wig has anything to do with it as I'm sure some people would consider us 'big-wigs'. That doesn't factor into the equation though. It's the once-a-year trip that minimizes expenses for the maximum opportunity to catch quality and quantities of fish. It looks like Beauchene has that, and I believe Whiskey Fox and McQ are only giving me what I asked for...their opinion. Thanks guys...I appreciate the subjective views you've offered."
531236,McQ,2003-05-21 06:18:00,615,"gotta be kidding. No I'm not paid to talk anything or anyone up but I am a bit more aware of the reasons why you have to spend a little more to have the opportunity to trophy fish. I can also identify value for money when I see it too.Most fishing packages are for 3 to 4 days and the basic costs will be in the area of $300 - $400, add to that the cost of a boat/motor, gas, oil and groceries and the trip now costs $650 - $700. All of this to fish public waters that may or may not support a strong fishery.Not all locations can put you in a trophy situation, so you spend more to have the chance. La Reserve Beauchene is a well managed private system of lakes that is recognized for the trophy fishing. Their accomodations are first class and the service is great. Regardless whether you choose the American Plan including all meals or elect a remote cabin and you furnish your own food the fishing is stupendous.Beyond these obvious reasons for choosing this type of lodge you have to recognize the behind the scene costs of managing a world class fishing system. The maintenance of these systems require constant input of dollars to keep the infrastructure in peak form. I'm sure this adds a bit to the overall cost - it just makes good business sense.You're absolutely right, some of us just don't have the budget (me included) that allows us the opportunity to enjoy a place like this on a regular basis but being able to make the trip occassionally is one of those small pleasures we all plan for - that's life not a rip-off."
531237,Guest,2003-05-21 07:53:00,0,too pricey for me too - used to renting cabin for under 400.00 canadian per week - bring my own motor - rent boat for 25.00/day - bring our food & beverages. split costs with 2 other guys - do 7 days for 300.00 U.S. each. fishing not bad - good time guaranteed.:)
531238,McQ,2003-05-27 08:53:00,615,"I just got off the phone with Don. He tells me that the fishing was as usual "" great "" through the past week at Beauchene. They got into a bunch of 4 -5# smallmouth, didn't spot any beds and most of them were taken on black/blue & black/chartreuse bucktails while jigging for walleye.The back lakes produced the duker walleye for the week from a newby, a 33""er that hadn't spawned yet - they estimated the weight around 14#s. The main lake gave up a few fish in the 30"" range and overall the fishing results were averaging over 20""s. No particular pattern has set in, most fish were caught jigging and the bite though steady was all over the lakes.The back lakes which are restricted to 1 party at a time were putting out 3 - 4# brookies all week on streamer and leech patterns. He says anyone going up should ask at the main lodge about the Beauchene streamers which everyone seemed to be having success with.Only a few Lake trout were caught - seems that the early season shallow bite was just starting. The winter has been really long and cold, although he noted the surface temps rose almost 10 degrees through the week.He managed to get some good shows shot and they will air next spring."
531239,Guest,2003-05-27 16:56:00,0,I'm thinking that ALL U.S.A. People should skip Quebec and look elsewhere.Lets not forget the French views towards the war.
531240,McQ,2003-05-27 17:43:00,615,Mickey you obviously failed geography - the French are on the eastern side of the Atlantic Ocean on a continent called Europe in a country called FRANCE. I hope this clears up some of the confusion in your young life. If you continue to have difficulty I'm sure Minnie will help you out.
531241,nemio,2003-05-27 18:15:00,96,"McQ, obviously you know your fishing stuff quite well but has everybody can see you know more then just fishing stuff. It is always good to read and watch other things then the same old crap (CNN).Where are the massive arms? Do Israel got nuclear weapon? Who got all the reconstruction contract in Iran? (Dick Cheney company).48 hrs and I will forgot all this. I'll be fishing on the Gouin.Bye and good fishing!"
531242,Guest,2003-05-27 20:39:00,0,"mcq, No I didn't forget about geography, I also didn't forget where your lame PM comes from.I see you forgot all about the comments his people have made about us ##### Americans, and how our leader is a Moron huh? Maybe you don't read the paper guy or follow the news at all?Explain to me why I can;t understand a single friggen sign in your Province? Why is it the last time I asked for directions in Quebec the guy I asked forgot they didn't know a word in English? I thought Bylinugial in Canada was supposed to mean english and french or did you forget that too?Your rope-A-dope PM is from Quebec, need I continue?"
531243,Guest,2003-05-27 20:43:00,0,"The above ######## was supposed to say B A S T A R D Americans.Lets all boycot those French, especially the one's who come from the rope-a-dopes place.If we are going to be called B A S T A R D S then we might as well start acting that way."
531244,McQ,2003-05-28 03:44:00,615,you are Mickey - you are
531225,T Bone,2003-05-19 11:06:00,18,"One of my buddies was asking me about this ""Reserve"" lake a little NE of North Bay, Ontario...just east of the Ottawa River. I was wondering if anyone out there has experience fishing there or any input on the accomodations available. I know it has pike, walleye, and smallmouth and from what he said there seems to be a good opportunity to get several 'trophy' fish on the lake and surrounding portage lakes. Your assistance is appreciated."
531226,McQ,2003-05-19 12:09:00,615,"My associate Don Meissner is up there right now, doing the opening series of shows for the PBS 2004 ""Streamside"" production. La Reserve Beauchene is noted for big fish opportunities including smallmouth, walleye, northerns, lake trout and speckles. This is by far a 5 star spot and if you get a chance to fish there don't hesitate. This marks the 17th year Don has done the opening at Beauchesne and the reason is simple - quality fishing, great accommodations and the service of an excellent staff.http://www.beauchene.com/I'll give you folks his fishing report when he returns home next Saturday, for sure he'll be calling me to gloat just a bit - it's the same thing every year - I'm here working and he's up there doing what any self respecting fisherman wants to do - fish one of the premier waters in Canada."

531228,Guest,2003-05-20 09:23:00,0,"let me get this straight....4 people,7 nigjts,$4,645.00....how can anyone not jump on a deal like this?i wonder how many trips i could take in lieu of going here? 2 or 3 ?seems to me the price is someone in the praying position.....come om just give me two more paying customers and i will never....."
531229,McQ,2003-05-20 10:04:00,615,"I guess you don't travel much - $1,122 is full american plan for 7 days - $160/day includes boat-motor, all meals etc. at a 5 star resort where the fishing is nothing short of phenominal.Do a little comparison shopping before you have a heart attack over this."
531230,T Bone,2003-05-20 12:36:00,18,"I talked to the manager today and asked about a trip for summer 2004 to one of their outpost cabins. I asked for a ""quick quote"" including taxes, boats...gas..everything. Mind you, this is in U.S. dollars and is NOT American Plan...rather housekeeping 'cook your own food'.Per guy: $1,000.00 for a Sat-Sat stay.Add in ancillary travel expenses, license, bait, food, beer..etc. we figured around $1,350.00 US per guy. A little pricey, but the multiple species and trophy fishing opportunities may be worth it. Thanks."
531231,McQ,2003-05-20 13:11:00,615,"T Bone, you wont be disappointed - La Reserve Beauchene is a world class fishery - is managed very well and the service is without comparison."
531232,Jim,2003-05-20 16:56:00,238,"I agree, far to pricey unless you want to rub shoulders with the big wigs.Plenty of other world class fishing opetunities to be had for that kind of scratch and that includes the ocean."
531233,Guest,2003-05-20 22:25:00,0,"i hope maybe MCQ sees that ALL of us aren't wrapped in the green like he is and need real value for our time and money.....mcq ,i would say i travel to fish probably as much as any one that pays his/her own way...i suspect that somewhere/somehow for you to be touting this rip- off that you might receive a little something or other...ok,maybe i'm wrong about that..just a little bit strong for me...not rying to start anything ,just sayin what i feel to be true.i will not respond again."
531234,Guest,2003-05-21 03:25:00,0,"Well guy's Ive been to Beauchene 15 times in the last 10 years. I work 11 hours a day 6 day's a week and don't consider myself a Big Wig...Just a hard worker that loves good fishing. One main lake and 30+ back lakes with good boats and motors, Great food, great accomidations and a staff that there to help you not just get through the day. On the back lakes they allow just one boat at a time and the selection of types of fish is super. If you want to save money ask about the campgrounds at the end of the lake, I have not stayed there but all of the lakes are available to the campers also. I understand that the Reserve has a new manager this year ( I met him last fall) and Shirley retired so there is a new cook. The small mouth bass fishing is the best I have ever seen along with big pike & eye's. In the last 50 years I have had the pleasure to fish Canada's many lakes and area's and most have been good but what my Pop's used to say is still true today. If you want to dance, You've got to pay the band. I hope to be able to fish more of Canada's lake's for another 50 year's. Just my thoughts.... W.F."
