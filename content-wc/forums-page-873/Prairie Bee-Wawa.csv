531682,Reelmn,2003-05-29 17:56:00,328,"Hey Chuck, I will arrive in camp on July 26th and depart Aug. 2nd, what about you??????"
531683,chuck c c,2003-05-30 03:00:00,34,Reelmn;Our group is arriving July 12th. I won't be with them this year due to a family trip to Greenland and the Arctic. I guess that's a fair trade ????

I don't know if the patterns are the same in late July or not, but I'd start by working the rockpiles, especially mornings and evenings.Good luck."
