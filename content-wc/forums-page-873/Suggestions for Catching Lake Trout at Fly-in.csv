Longline trolling these spoons will put you down fairly deep as they are so heavy. Have had great success fishing for Lakers with them. Late last fall, after the Lakers had spawned and the water turned over, they were heading back deep for the winter. Every day we kept marking them deeper and deeper, 45 feet at one point compared to 25 feet deep about four days prior. We hammered them on Kit-A-Mats as they got deeper. Trolling speed was just under 3 mph and anyone doing less had no luck. Then again, all lakes and locations are different. Just a suggestion.""Hold on to the boat, boys, she's gonna ram us!"""
531687,Guest,2003-05-29 07:45:00,0,"Greetings all,We're leaving on Monday for Ear Falls to begin our fly-in (near Red Lake). I've been told there's a great lake trout lake that requires a small portage.Wanted any suggestions on presentations this time of year for lakers. I've tried trolling plugs / spoons with little success in 20 to 30 feet of water later in the season.I have marked fish deep (50 to 75 feet) and tried heavy bucktail jigs and ciscos...Any help on presentations appreciated, depth and lures..Thank you,md"
531688,Trailerguy,2003-05-29 09:22:00,1407,"Most lakes in NWO stratify or turn over around the 1 st of June, I'm sure lake size and depth have a lot to do with exactly when this happens. The trout are in the top layer in the spring and go down when the lake turnsover. In the last few weeks they have been on top, around rocky points near deep water is a good place to look. Everything from spoons to Raplas on a straight line has been working. The more vibration/wilder wobble the better trout like it. Trolling ten to twentyfive feet has been adequate. But if the lake turns it's time to breakout the downriggers."
531689,Guest,2003-05-29 10:50:00,0,Thanks Trailerguy for your response.Is there a way to tell if the lake has turned over other than taking tempuratures at various depths?
531690,Stevie B,2003-05-29 11:02:00,157,"I know that when some lakes turn over there are small currents created which in turn stirs up particals and sediment. These particals will be ""floating"" in the lake for a few days and then settle down when the temperature of the water stays more consistant.Fish ON!!"
531691,Guest,2003-05-29 13:15:00,0,Sorry guys but the lake turns over when the densest water(39 F) sinks to the bottom and displaces the water that was at the bottom before. This upwelling brings up bottom particles which cause the water to become murky. This occurs in the fall when the surface temp. cools to 39F and possibly right after ice out when the surface temp. rises to that temp and then sinks. I don't think there are many lake that are in that situation now.I have had luck trolling with crankbaits behind a bead chain sinker (1-4 oz.) (up to 25-30 feet)or with spoons behind a 3 way rig with sinkers up to 5 oz. The superlines would work great for this because they are thinner and more sensitive. I've also had luck with a slide diver which is a dipsey diver that slides up and down the line but unless you live in Wisconsin near Lake Michigan they are tough to find.Best crankbaits for me have been hot'n tots. Lakers love the erratic action. Make sure to pump the rod or increase speed every once in awhile because lakers are notorious followers and a change of speed sometimes triggers them. Good luck
531693,phishfearme,2003-05-29 13:35:00,1242,"mike - we usually go in early july and the trout are deep - early june (assuming a normal spring if such a thing exists) would keep the trout much more near near the surface since that's where their baitfish will be and it's cool enough for them. i suggest getting large lipped, deep divers like fat raps in silver. in any event i would troll in the 20ft or deeper range with wabbling spoons (we've had good success with syclops or similar) trolled behind a diving device like dipsy diver. a fish attracter like a string of flashers also helps but my buddy calls these fish detractors. best of luck, phish"
531692,Trailerguy,2003-05-29 19:07:00,1407,"I agree with you about fall turnover, that's what brings the trout back to the top. But there is the oppostie affect in early summer, as the surface water heats, the deep cold water becomes their summer home, whitefish do likewise."
531694,Guest,2003-05-30 06:24:00,0,Thank you all for your suggestions -
531695,fishinnut,2003-05-30 07:30:00,642,"Don't forget to try jigging with large white jigs,especially white tube jigs. There is a jig made with rabbit hair that is said to work really well on lakers.I think it's called the Hammerin Hare jig."
531696,Guest,2003-05-30 08:45:00,0,"I've said it before, I'll say it again. Smithwick Suspending Rogues. I can't say why they seem to work so well. All I can tell you is my boat partners have run a myriad of different lures against my Rogues while up there, and I have yet to be outfished for lakers.It is certainly not me, its something in the rolling action I guess."
