Also fished off of point of Sunset / Bayview Lodge. Water temp here was 62.5 Given the lack of current / low water & the temps, I'm thinking that maybe we are all fishing it wrong. Hope to get out in the next couple of evenings..... think I'll hit Little / Big Sand. These fish are definatly ahead of ""schedule""Good FishenRobwww.minakilodge.com"
