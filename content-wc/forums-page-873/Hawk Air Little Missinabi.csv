We fish mostly with crawler harnesses and bottom bouncers, jigs and crawlers or Rapala shad raps in the ""clown"" color (size 7 & 9). We troll the bays where there is weed growth and, if we hit a pocket of 'eyes, we cast jigs or the shad raps. The bay to the south of the camp island is good in the evening-we just cast raps there usually. The shore across the lake from the camp (behind the big rock) is good in the evening. Lookout Bay at the other end of the lake is good most any time as is Stump Bay. Just south of the narrows and past the island on your left is a sand point shaped like a hook. Fish in that sheltered area from the point until the water shallows to the south. Anywhere on the lake, just look for 8-15 feet of water, some weed growth and the walleyes will accomodate you. There is no need to go north of the cabin, it's shallow, rocky and pretty unproductive. Leave a few because I'll be there at the end of August."

After that bay, the lake narrows to a small river.Stump Bay is past the narrows from the camp, past the island on your left, past a large arm going off to your left and the bay has a 1 acre island in the middle of the mouth of it. Stump Bay goes off to the left from the main lake.I leave for Ontario this afternoon but can give other info if needed when I return June 7th.Chuck"
