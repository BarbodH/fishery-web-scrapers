530662,Guest,2003-05-11 05:11:00,0,"Older lodge and cabins, boat and motors are also old. Nice owners though. Clearwter lake known for muskies and some walleye, Pipestone lake known for lake trout and muskie. I wouldn't go there for my vacation or to catch fish, I always liked English river north of Kenora."
