531496,luckyketch,2003-05-29 20:29:00,46,I know this is a little late for your trip.We have been fishing on Cameron Lake right next to Pine Portage on Big Kabi.Weather had been beutiful until Wed. the 28th as I'm sure you found out we had very high winds in the afternoon. We had four footers plus on Cameron. It made for an interesting ride back.Hope you get to read this and that you have a good trip.We caught lots of eyes but all were to big for slot size.We also caught to many pike to count.Luckyketch
