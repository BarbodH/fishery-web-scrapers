531674,Guest,2003-05-29 04:33:00,0,Am going to be fishing Lac Seul week of June 21. Would like to know of areas close to Ear Falls(Golden Fawn Lodge) for good pike fishing.Don't want to run real far across the reservoir. Thanks!
531675,Guest,2003-05-29 08:32:00,0,you dont have to go far at all. we always had good luck around the railroad bridge turned roadway for the logging trucks now.. right around the pileings. trolling along the shore all the way around to where you can see the dam..
531676,Guest,2003-05-29 11:20:00,0,Try turning right after leaving the dock and go around the point and fish the group of small islands in that bay. There are several submerged weed lines and many good points of islands to check out. Hang on.

Because I was the teenager, I carried the fish up the incline to the car. One of my favorite memories is thinking I had snagged a rock, being told by my grandfather to fish above the rocks, and having the ""rock"" swim away-nice fish! There used to be shallow pools of water along side the dam and river that you keep your fish in until you were ready to leave."
