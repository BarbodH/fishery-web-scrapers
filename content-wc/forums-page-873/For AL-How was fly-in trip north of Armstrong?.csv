531554,AL,2003-05-26 19:11:00,89,"Larry,We used Mattice Lake Outfitters and fished Weese Lake this year. The pike fishing was better than last year with the late ice out, but once again the larger pike fishing was inconsistant. We caught some nice ones but most ranged in the 24""-36"" range. The walleye fishing was once again fantastic. My party of 6 netted roughly 1000 fish for the week. That number was considerable down from last year due to 3 of my party members had never fished for Walleye. We caught alot of post spawn females with decent size (22""-28"") with the males being in the 18""-22"" range. Our hot colors this year were orange, green and white jig heads. The multi colored power baits worked well in the green/ orange, Christmas Tree and Captain America colors. We also founf the brown/ gold with blue specs and brown to work good. We used some minnows but didn't see a huge difference in quality or quantity caught. For the second year we missed the bugs. We had snow/sleet last Monday and Tuesday but the rest of the time the weather was great bordering on a little warm. You can email me at [email protected] with any other questions.AL"
