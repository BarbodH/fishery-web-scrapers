1320997,illiniharrison,2011-06-21 15:25:00,4,Couple of questions for people that have been denied or know someone that has been not permitted to cross because of DUI. 1. How long ago was the dui? 2. What border was it? 3. Did you try to pay the extra fees to try to cross? I called and was told it's up to the agent to let you cross if the DUI has been between 5-10 years. I was told don't even try if under 5 years. It really sucks that a stupid mistake over 5 years ago might stop this fishing trip. Any help or ideas would be appreciated.
1321009,jswinter40,2011-06-21 15:43:00,127,"I don't think you are going to like the answers to your questions. I personally have not been in this situation or know directly of a story. You could go up to the border and not even be checked and be on your marry way but having a way home for those people would be wise. The way I understand it is if you have a DUI in the past 5 years you are not likely to get in, 5-10 depends on situation, 10+ and no other convictions then you SHOULD be good. The biggest problem is that you seemed to have asked a straight forward question but THERE IS NOT A STRAIGHT FORWARD ANSWER and YOU COULD GET TREATED DIFFERENTLY AT EACH AND EVERY BORDER CROSSING. There are some on WC that will say this isn't true but when there are thousands of stories about it and its a topic on nightly news in the Twin Cities then it happens."
1321035,bluegussler,2011-06-21 16:42:00,124,As usual everything is a gray area. Although you can go online [Canadian website] where it states you can bring potatoes into Canada. I was asked if I had any potatoes. Now are these trick questions? or are the crossing guards that misinformed or just plain stupid. I actually believe the later.Tryed to ask a direct question like how much gas can I bring and you will not get a straight answer. My friend that is 67 years old was turned around for a ticket that happened in 1982. Illegally discharging a firearm in city limits wupty-do. He shot a Rat.Nothing suprises me or the power they give these morons
1321044,guide7,2011-06-21 17:08:00,70,"If you get your ""Rehabilitation"" papers filed and PAID for (I think they just like the filing fee of about $200.00) they should grant you a ""letter of Rehabilitation"" that you can bring with you along with your passport. Show them the letter if they ask or do their background check. If it is not 5 years from the end of your sentence period (30, 60, 90 or 365 day sentence...) don't bother going thru the rehab deal as I think they will keep your filing $$$$ and tell you to start over after the 5 year period. I was turned back after 23 years in about 2003 or 4. So I went thru the Rehab $$$ process. Then 2 years later they waived all offences beyond 10 years. Go figure. Life is simpler when you plow around the stump. Guide7"
1321053,v-bay gord,2011-06-21 17:28:00,3168,"Try this....... The NOTO office continues to receive more calls than ever from guests who are concerned that they may have problems entering Canada due to an old criminal record for offenses such as DUI. A number of operators are actively informing guest about this issue and urging them to call the NOTO office with any questions or for help with the process of applying for rehabilitation. This advice is a FREE service that NOTO provides to your guests - they do not need to pay nearly $1,000 to an ""immigration consultant""! What if a guest has a trip planned but has just discovered that they have a problem? Although the rehabilitation process often takes 4 to 6 months, all may not be lost. If they have a rehabilitation application in the system, they can still request a Temporary Residency Permit in order to complete their trip. Although this will cost them an additional $200, many guests we have spoken with are very thankful that there is a possibility of saving a planned vacation. We also get calls from operators regarding guests who feel they were treated badly or turned back illegitimately by border officials. We urge those guests to raise their concerns directly with CBSA via their website http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/contact/com-eng.html These concerns will be followed up by officials, usually in the form of a direct phone call to the guest. This process also makes sure that complaints or comments make it into CBSA statistics. Since I am currently leading this initiative in the NOTO office, please have your guests contact me directly by phone or email me so we can arrange a convenient time to talk about their issue and steps they can take to clear up their problem. I'll make sure they have the necessary information and correct point of contact so their application for rehabilitation goes as smoothly as possible. Of the many calls we have receive this winter and spring - often 5 or 6 a day - the vast majority find a solution to their issue and are able to continue a planned trip. We can't help your guests if we don't hear from them, so please use any opportunity you have to let us help them cross the border and visit northern Ontario.

1321108,Stu,2011-06-21 19:20:00,472,Thank you very much for your help Doug. I have lots of friends who have stopped going to Canada because they don't know if they'll get turned away or not. They have chosen to fish in the states instead of taking a risk of getting turned away at the border and losing their deposits. I will forward your info to them. Thanks again - Stu
1321187,Hawker,2011-06-22 05:03:00,3967,"Very recently (3 weeks ago) me, my wife and a fishing buddy were returning from our annual trip to LOTW and stopped in International Falls for fuel, trinket shopping & coffee before hitting the road for our long trip home. While at a small shop we overheard a gentleman (Del) asking for a ride down to Duluth from I-Falls as he'd been turned back at the border because of two (2) DUI conviction over 40 years ago at the age then of 18. I approached Del and asked him what his story was! He was with a group of folks from Wisconsin and as they were being questioned, it was determined that he (Del) had two prior DUI's some 40+ yrs ago and he was denied entry to Canada because of that. He'd done the checking over the phone prior to making the trip and was told that he'd be good to go because of the time lapsed, so figured there be no problem. Of course, there was, and not wanting to ruin the trip for the group he was traveling with, opted to have them continue and seek a ride home on his own! Del had already contacted some friends from his church back at home in Wisconsin and they were en-route to meet him in Duluth if he could find a ride to that point! Having room, we offered and gave him a ride to Duluth where he was able to meet his friends and get on back home.All that to say, you just really don't know what for sure will happen at the border if you have a DUI or something similar in your past. Del said the border agent told him they can (and will it seems) look as far back as your 18th birthday, no matter your age! Del is 62! Go figure!"

1323466,danforth,2011-06-28 03:17:00,117,"For a U.S. citizen to go to Canada with a DUI it is a felony per Canada law. It is not a felony for a Canadian citizen to come to the U.S. with a DUI per U.S. law. (This is why a Canadian can enter the U.S. with a DUI). A person must be charged and convicted for it to be held against you not just arrested and not charged and/or released BBBUUUTTTT hear is the kicker to this, if they want to they can send you back to get your court records if you were not convicted and it shows that there was some form of action taken against you on your record and they don't believe your story. For the most part only in rare situations will you be sent back to get your court records but it does happen? I hope this helps some of you. Never say never but the big one going to Canada is the DUI."
1323479,Guss,2011-06-28 04:55:00,27,"I was turned back at the border in 2009 for multiple DUI's in 1978 and 1990. I was informed by the Immigration Officer that the only way back in was to go through the Criminal Rehabilitation process. 11 months and some leg work I received my letter for acceptance, it was not very diffucult and worth it. One thing to remember is that even if you do make it across the border with convictions, if you were to be stopped by the OPP. or MNR. and they see your record you will be seen as a felon in there country and things may not go well. This came from the Immigration Officer, so beware."
1531416,Guest,2013-01-31 12:16:00,0,"I know this is an old topic, but I came upon it in a google search and thought I should add that this info is out of date... New legislation in 2012 made it possible to come to Canada even if you have a minor criminal record such as DUI. Small misdemeanors may be okay, but its always a good idea to get a TRP (explained better here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?&v=HunrhDeLQj0) to make sure you can get in. With a TRP you can at least know ahead of time if you'll be denied entry -- so yes, it is a bit of red tape, but probably worth it so you don't waste your time getting turned around at the border..."

1532905,drlee,2013-02-03 16:37:00,409,"A friend of mine, who has a dui from well over ten years ago, was interviewed at some length, had his vehicle torn down, and had to pay $200 at the International Falls/Fort Frances crossing two years ago. On the advice of a very nice person from the Ontario Board of Tourism, I have told my friend that he should go to the Wisconsin DOT Drivers License station, and they will give him a copy of the report showing the dates of the dui, the documentation that he has completed all of the required penalties involved, and that this will likely simplify his crossing. The OBT respresentative told me that border officers have a good deal of flexibility in how they handle people who have had a dui at some point in time. The person also told me that many of the problems occur at the IF/FF crossing and that the officers there have been required to take some customer relations training in the past couple of years due to the number of complaints that have come from people using that border crossing. (The representative did say that IF/FF has such a high volume that some of the problems may be due to that factor...makes sense to me.) I have never had a dui, but have been treated rather rudely (my opinion) on occasion at the IF/FF border crossing. I now cross at Pigeon River just south of Thunder Bay. The distance to my fishing camps is no further when I cross at PR. I have been treated more politely at this crossing...plus, the wait time is typically non-existent. My son, who is in law enforcement, has told me that making people feel uncomfortable, treating them a bit rough, is an acceptable law enforcement technique, so we need to remember to understand the job these folks have. Also, they have every right/responsibility to enforce Canadian laws as in, dui's as a felony."
1321566,ftfarms,2011-06-22 20:34:00,444,I had a owi in 1985 and had a none conviction and was arrested for a dui in 2008 and was found not guilty. When we crossed in may at fort francis thay pulled us over and had us wait about 30 mins so thay could make sure it was a nonconvition. The officer said that the 1985 was old enough it didnt matter but he had to make sure of the nonconvition in 2008.
1321697,tilldawg,2011-06-23 09:18:00,55,I did some research and this is what the officials had to say on the issue:You may be deemed rehabilitated if at least 10 years have passed since you completed the sentence imposed for your crime. Some requirements for deemed rehabilitation include:* You have only been convicted of one offence; and* The offence would be punishable in Canada by a maximum term of imprisonment of less than 10 years.You are not required to submit an application to be deemed rehabilitated.
1321701,Guest,2011-06-23 09:28:00,0,"The key word there is ""may"" you may be deemed rehabilitated. Doesn't say you are rehabilitated. That part is appearently left up to the border officer and his/her mood at the time of your crossing."
1321703,hawg,2011-06-23 09:29:00,2008,Take 2 cars.
1321717,tilldawg,2011-06-23 10:05:00,55,"The problem for the guy you mention is that he had 2 DUI's. If you have 1 and it has been over 10 years ago, and you have not been in any other trouble, you are good to go and do not need to appoly for rehabilitation."
1321739,tv4fish,2011-06-23 10:44:00,2694,"All that to say, you just really don't know what for sure will happen at the border if you have a DUI or something similar in your past. Del said the border agent told him they can (and will it seems) look as far back as your 18th birthday, no matter your age! Del is 62! Go figure! To me -- THAT'S the biggest problem - IF there was some consistency -- people would KNOW what they should do."
1321938,go dart,2011-06-23 20:21:00,77,Man these DUI threads make me nervous. Not for me but for my son. We crossed last year and he had a 3 yr old DUI so we didn't consider the rehabilation thing. We were part of a group of 9 and had my vechicle if denied entry. We would not of lied if asked. Thankfully the guard seemed more concerned if we were bringing in fireworks and never ask'ed about our records. I was watching as he scanned our passports and I guess it doesn't give your record. We want to go next year but I don't need another stressful crossing.
1322042,Stu,2011-06-24 06:57:00,472,"I understand your problem go Dart. Our group dropped from 18 to 6 because of the same problem. Some of the guys are now fishing the Northwest Angle of LOW. Lake of the Woods Passenger Service will take you by boat to several lodges in the area and you don't have to go thru customs. They charge $95 per person for a round trip.

1322048,Guest,2011-06-24 07:03:00,0,"As usual it is all about money. Pay em, they'll ""rehabilitate"" you LOL Amazing that money makes ""criminals"" acceptable in Canada?"
1322128,Northern Exposure,2011-06-24 10:02:00,29,"GO DARTYou always hear about these stories of people being turned away but I have never met anyone who got turned away. One guy we go with has 2 DUI's, he has made it across without any trouble 10 years in a row. We even take his truck some years. And I personally know others that go with DUI's andhave never had aproblem. I think your chances are very good to get through. Just keep a backup plan in place because it is possible that you will get turned away. You only live once and if you and your son have time to get up there together I would do it without even thinking twice. Years down the road when he gets rehabilitated you might not have the time or health to do it. Remember life is short."
1321238,Stu,2011-06-22 07:11:00,472,"You pled ""nolo contendre"" or no contest. Basically it means you didn't plead guilty but admit that there was enough evidence to convict you. Without knowing all the facts it is impossible to give you an accurate answer, but most likely, there is a DUI on your record. Go to your local police station and ask them to print out your record. They will usually charge you a small fee."
1321239,NARDA 1,2011-06-22 07:12:00,636,The only way to really know that would be to have your local police department run a check on you and see what shows up.
1321242,Guest,2011-06-22 07:16:00,0,If you were arrested for DUI it is on your record with the National Crime Information Center as an arrest. The NCIC is a records data base held by the FBI

1321440,Stu,2011-06-22 14:25:00,472,"No Ex-Con, you are absolutely correct. However, a no contest plea is a conviction."
1321441,Guest,2011-06-22 14:25:00,0,"I didn't say that you wouldn't get in because of an arrest I said it would be on your record. Therefore, if asked "" have you ever been arrested"" answer thruthfully cause they probably know the answer."
1321443,Guest,2011-06-22 14:28:00,0,What about a deferred judgement does that show up on the record? Do they check criminal records or DOT records or both?
1321551,Legend115,2011-06-22 20:11:00,39,"i have a DUI and have had zero problems in or out of Canada to the states. when they ask if i have any arrests or convictions i immediately say yes and tell them about my DUI and i'm good to go. and to top it off, i went to the states (4 years ago) and i bought two snomobiles and an enclosed trailer. but i didn't declare the proper amount and was fined 2700$. the next time i went to the states i went with an enclosed car hauler to pick up my buddies Viper in AZ. upon return, they searched everything but everything was smooth as silk. however, now when i travel to mexico (once or twice a year) no problemo. but upon my return my baggage ALWAYS get searched. i'm always the one that has to go to ""the other line""..oh well..better than getting denied.."
1321198,AllenW,2011-06-22 06:08:00,11482,"Might help to remember that Canadian laws are different than the US, DUI's, if I have it right, are the same as a felony and gun laws are much stricter.Far as turned back, yes, once when a buddy had a conviction for DWI 8 years prior and once we sat at the border for over two and a half hours while they decided whether another friend could pass, his was about 15-16 years prior, they finally let him through.Not sure on the potato thing, AFAIK you haven't been able to bring fresh potatoes across for many years, I think canned are OK and maybe cooked and frozen...not to sure. That might be where the confusion lies???If in question, maybe give Doug here a call, sounds like he may be able to help ya.Keep his/or who ever you talk to name and number when you cross, in case of a problem, might help. btw thanks for posting that v-bayAl"
