We will have all of the necessary gear like shanties w/heaters, electronics, mustang survival suits, satellite phone, etc. We will have a 4 by 4 truck with a trailer to pull our gear, and snowmobiles for the harder to reach bush lakes.We will be on Eagle Lake itself some days, the strawberry island area for starters, then other areas of the lake.We also want to try some of the smaller, local lakes that are hard to access during the Summer, but have easier access during the Winter. These lakes are primarily lake trout/ walleye water or lake trout/whitefish waters or some other combination of fish.One of my buddies has been ice fishing up there before, so we're not going to be clueless, but I could use some advice in the following areas:#1 How to approach the walleye and perch on Eagle Lake.#2 How to approach the lake trout and whitefish.#3 Anything else I need to aware of in terms of techniques/styles/safety, that I should know.Thanks ."

With any luck you will leave the portable ice shacks in the truck. I am a wimp, but my personal comfort zone is -10 F or warmer, with little wind I can stay out all day, no shack needed. The key is to dress properly and have really good boots, not the run of the mill snowmobile boots. I prefer Bunny boots, as you can stand in 6 inches of slush water and you will still have dry-warm feet, there are other good footwear optons also, just come with utility in mind, not fashion. Take several gloves with you every day. Portable shacks will slow you down, are a pain pulling through deep snow/slush and in my opinion, at the end of the day you will probably have caught less fish, because you confined yourself to one spot, probably not drilling near as many holes as you should have.Slush, unless you have been stuck in it, you cannot appreciate it. Thin ice, be very careful at creek entrances, narrows and think twice about running a creek, unless you know it is safe. The floater suits were a good idea.I enjoy winter as much as summer, if you are prepared with the right equipment/clothes it gives you an opportunity to get into places you never would in the summer. It is beautiful here in the winter, enjoy your trip."

Definately something to keep in mind.fwiw, my portable is an Eskimo Fatfish 767 that sets up in 60 seconds by pulling on 5 hubs. I'm not quite sure what my other friend has in terms of a shanty.."
