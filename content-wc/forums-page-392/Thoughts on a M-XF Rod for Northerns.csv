1531429,Guest,2013-01-31 12:38:00,0,"I have used Cabelas' 3 piece, 7 foot spinning and casting rods for a number of years. I can pack both rods in the supplied spinning rod case and take them as cabin luggage on commercial flights. The case is about 32 "" long. I have yet to have one fail. They are great pike rods. Cabelas has the rods in less stiffer weights suitable for walleye fishing."

1533284,rocko0305,2013-02-04 14:43:00,138,Thanks for the input. I appreciate it. Spring can't come soon enough.
1533789,Mike Borger,2013-02-05 16:09:00,1554,"Regarding one piece rods on planes, I agree it's not an issue if you're flying in an otter or cesna caravan. However it is an issue in a beaver or cessna.Yes you can fit 1 piece rods in a beaver, but it can be a pita.Because weight was at such an extreme premium on one of my trips in a beaver last year I put all my one piece rods in rod socks and taped them together. Even taped a piece of stiff cardboard around the tip section.Ended up having the tip of my favourite custom baitcaster snapped off on that flight...Never again. I'm currently investing in a new arsenal of two piece rods for the flights in smaller planes..."
1534288,Walleye Wanderer,2013-02-06 17:32:00,101,Geez if you are throwing away any of those custom one piecer's let me know Mike I'll be right over
1530308,rocko0305,2013-01-29 10:41:00,138,"I wanted to know what you guys thought about this rod being used for fly-in trips to Ontario for targeting northerns? I have a 3000 Sahara that it would be paired with that has 15 lb. drag.http://www.fenwickfishing.com/prod.p...M-XF (1253043) ESMS692M-XF (1253043) 9+tip 2 6 to 12 1/8 to 3/4 6ft 9in M X-Fast I already own a MH baitcasting rod, as well as another MH spinning rod, so I wanted to get a Medium power rod, so that when it comes time to smallmouth fish back in MI, I don't have 3 MH rods."
1530325,camp chef,2013-01-29 11:06:00,915,"I fish northerns and Muskies with a St. Croix with the same action you are describing and absolutely love it. I wouldn't change a thing. I don't throw the really big baits, I fish manily with 4 or 5 Mepps and medium sized spoons."
1530329,rocko0305,2013-01-29 11:11:00,138,"Okay great, that's good to know. I would be using my MH baitcasting or MH spinning outfits to throw my heavy baits, and would plan on using the Fenwick M-XF to throw soft plastics like sluggos, reapers, or money minnows."
1530352,TIGHTLINER,2013-01-29 11:38:00,223,MIKE.. I WOULD SAY THAT ROD HOOKED UP WITH THE REEL WOULD BE A GREAT OUTFIT. REMEMBER IF IT DOES NOT WORK OUT THE WAY YOU THINK IT WILL DON'T TOSS IT IN THE RIVER. I WILL SEND YOU MY MAILING ADDRESS. HAVE A GREAT TRIP.
1530626,zeebee,2013-01-30 03:52:00,1144,Nice to see its a 2 piece .... witnessed a pilot frustrated beyond reasonable trying to load 3 guys and their 1 piece rods onto a Cessna. We were loaded and gone while they were still dickin around. Had more than one pilot smile and thank me for bringing 2-piece rods in cases.
1530763,rocko0305,2013-01-30 09:14:00,138,"I know there is a M-XF two piece on that link to the Fenwick site I gave, but I am actually going to go with the M-XF one piece. I have never had a problem on any of my fly in trips with bringing one piece rods, as long as they are in a hard rod case. All of my rods are one pieces, with the thought being increased sensitivity vs. a two piece.....whether that is actually true or not is another story."
1530796,pike50plus,2013-01-30 10:15:00,584,"I love a 7-7 1/2 ft telescopic rods, MH for pike. Especially the Daiwa interline ones, no guides to worry about and better stability landing at boat side since it will not ""flop-over because of guides. IMHO I have an extra St Croix 6-10 telo that I would get rid of if you need one."
1530920,camp chef,2013-01-30 13:15:00,915,All my rods are 1 piece as well. That's just the way I roll LOL
1531064,ohiojmj,2013-01-30 18:07:00,1262,"Ditto, except 7' for me"
1531121,zeebee,2013-01-30 19:50:00,1144,"Ok....the model # you gave corresponds to the two piece. Regardless I think its a good choice for NP and smallies. Enjoy. As for the shimano, I swapped out the felt stock washers with some carbonite after market on mine. Good/cheap/easy upgrade where bigger fish are targeted. I dont fish heavy line (10 lb max) regardless of the species (not a Musky guy) and the carbonite give me confidence."
