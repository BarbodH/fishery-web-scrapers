1535750,still fishin',2013-02-10 09:06:00,69,Our reservation fell through this year. Looking for fairly remote Southern Quebec outfitter (no popular resorts). We don't mind navigating a logging road. Willing to consider almost anything at this point. I'm sure there are lots of places we've never heard of. Anyone have suggestions? Thanks.

1536412,Jaskonie,2013-02-11 19:47:00,80,"Try the Kipawa area. Good lodges on Kipawa, and down the logging roads you got a few mainly Ogascanan, Sasseginaga outpost and Bush Country Camp. Visit Kipawa.net for a bunch of others on the lake kipawa"
