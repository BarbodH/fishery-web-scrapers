There is a place near Hornepayne on Highway 631; Uncles Restaurant & Lodge that may be able to accommodate you-(807) 868-3237- they also have a website. We have reserved rooms with them the day before our July 2011 fly in. Staying in White River an hour away would be the only other choice. If you stay at Uncles please report on the accommodations.

1302910,Guest,2011-05-04 12:58:00,0,This is a question for Tooski: Is Northern Pines a motel? I can not find anything on the internet on them and am a bit leery. I need to stay somewhere for 4 guys and would rather stay in Hornepayne if possible. Do you also know if Rick's restaurant in the Centre Inn closed too? Thanks

A bit north of Hornepayne which usually leaves us with about a six hour drive to Nakina. Nice for you in that all four of you can stay in one cabin."

You won't be disapointed at Northern Pines. If you do go ,tell Mike Hi from his friends in St.Helen MI."
