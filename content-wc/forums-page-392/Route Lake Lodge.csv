1327284,nsideirish,2011-07-08 02:42:00,4,I will be up at Route Lake next week from the 16th-23rd for the second year. I will be sure to e-mail you how we do/tips.It really is an absolutely beautiful lake. I have been to quite a few up there and this one stands out. Pretty decent fishing too. The out lakes that you can go to also are great. Centrefire Lake has awesome smallmouth fishing.
1327803,Guest,2011-07-09 18:53:00,0,Thanks for the information. We plan to stop in Dryden to get any food that needs to be refrigerated (milk) and bring the rest up. I will be driving a Venture-so hopefully that has enough clearance; it should. We leave on July 28th and are looking forward to a great trip. Thanks again for the help.
1532915,ricksiewert,2013-02-03 16:54:00,5,"HI - Down to 2-3 lodge for this summer with my boys and Route Lake Lodge is one of them. I see several have listed emails to have info. sent - I would appreciate a chance to talk to someone who has been there in the past few years. Looks like a pretty neat place. Just want to make sure that we are going to the right place. We will have 16 kids under 16 so i can't go hunting all day to find some fish. We have been to a lot of other places most recently Anderson's Manitou Falls, Cat Island Lodge, Boois, Knobby's to name a few. If someone could either email me or be willing to provide a contact i would appreciate a chance to have a live conversation with someone. Wondering if this is more of a #'s lake or size lake?Thanks, rick[email protected]"

549264,Dr. Lee,2005-06-14 17:48:00,15,"I made a trip to Route Lake Lodge in 2003. One of the prettiest lakes I have fished in Canada, or anywhere else. The cabins are great...clean, well cared for and just plain comfortable. You boat in a short distance to the lodge, which is no problem. The boat docks are well protected and the fish cleaning facilities are nice. If you want American plan or an occasional break from housekeeping, the lodge serves ""plain"" but very good food. The lodge owners and crew are friendly and easy to get along with. Will help some with fishing. The lake is very deep. Many lake trout...I don't fish them so I can't help there. We caught some northern, not big, but did not fish for them alot. Walleye fishing was good in quality and fair in numbers. Certainly plenty to eat. Toughest thing was finding walleye haunts in such a deep lake. The two ""arms"" are about as pretty as you will find anywhere. Thats about what I can recall off the top of my head. Dr. Lee"

1326032,Gary from Iowa,2011-07-05 08:16:00,74,"I agree that Route Lake is beautiful and deep. We went there 3 years ago-last day of May, first week of June. Good boats, decent cabins, although solar lights can be challenging on my old eyes. We caught a few decent sized Walleyes but not much for eating size until the end of the trip. My uncle caught a couple of Lake Trout. I like the lakes accessible by logging roads, namely: Centrefire and Gilbert. We caught many smallmouth bass and some good northerns on Centrefire and good northerns on Gilbert.The starter went out on my car in Dryden and I left it at the Ford dealer for repair. (We doubled up in my Uncle's SUV to the camp.) Mrs Ralston took me to town to pick my car up (she was on her way to do some shopping but still it was nice of her. It gave me the opportunity to get some more groceriesBe sure to make a good list of what you need to eat. Its a long ways to town to get more. While I drove a Taurus, I think a high clearance vehicle is better for a road that can be rough. I noticed a large being pulled at low speed.Good luck fishing if you decide to go.Gary"
