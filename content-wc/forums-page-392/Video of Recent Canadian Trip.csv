1533096,MrSimon,2013-02-04 07:10:00,922,"And one more from a trip to Crotch Lake in eastern Ontario. The fishing wasn't that great, but the scenery was amazing. The lake also had a couple dozen shore lunch areas spread out around the lake. Each one had a great fire pit, fish cleaning table, and little outhouse box. A few even had picnic tables. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this as a destination if you want to catch a lot of fish, but if you want a place that is only a few hours over the Thousand Islands bridge that is breathtakingly beautiful, this is the place.http://youtu.be/ABmyoA3yTXY"
1531861,MrSimon,2013-02-01 08:29:00,922,"Roland's recent slideshow was so much fun to watch that I decided to make one of our recent trip to the Chapleau area.http://youtu.be/aUtqrchuKtE You can check out my channel for lots of other fishing related videos if you want .... I made slideshows from trips to Black Lake NY, Crotch Lake Ontario, and the Susquehanna River."

1531904,RolandDeschain,2013-02-01 09:26:00,30,Nice video - those were some chunky smallmouth! Yup - definitely adds to the cabin fever....

1531958,Pikeslayer8,2013-02-01 10:20:00,1460,"Enjoyed the video, some breathtaking photography. Thanks for sharing."
1531986,wallydave,2013-02-01 10:58:00,2151,Nice pictures! Only 19 weeks to go before we head North to Ontario!! Not that I'm counting the weeks and days!??
1531987,adempsey,2013-02-01 10:58:00,963,Thanks for putting that together. Was a good teaser for my trip to HDL this summer!
1532018,HeHooksHimself,2013-02-01 11:50:00,725,It all looks so familiar. Counting the days til walleye opener. We leave in 104! Time to go buy some tackle i don't need!
1532276,andreej,2013-02-01 22:42:00,248,nice pictures. Its always amazing how much Canada lakes look alike. We fish hundreds of miles away from there but you could throw in pictures from our trips and you'd never tell the difference!
1532295,rebs,2013-02-02 04:35:00,7587,"Thanks for sharing your trip with us, now I have to work on my tackle boxes. That video got me all hyped up."
