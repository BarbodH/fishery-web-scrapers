1537126,Golden Eagle,2013-02-13 10:50:00,2642,Don't think those 2 ever show up on our TV.
1533322,youngcanadianguide,2013-02-04 16:21:00,60,"Hey guys,Did anyone see the Labatt’s Blue Super Bowl commercial? We were all laughing about it here. This is a prime example of how not to cross the border. I don’t recommend telling the guard how frisky you are feeling at the time even if she is an attractive looking guard. If you missed seeing the commercial, heres the link.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VU62DWte3I"
1533348,wallydave,2013-02-04 17:21:00,2151,the Kokanee eh?!
1533350,bluegussler,2013-02-04 17:22:00,124,Thats not the same guard I had to deal with
1533352,wallydave,2013-02-04 17:25:00,2151,"at our house, when commercials are confusing is... ""its a commercial its not reality! !""We must be crossing at the wrong place!!I always thought they partied with confiscated beer and Cuban cigars!! Not that I would know anything about that!"
1533463,Pooch,2013-02-04 20:54:00,4619,We live in Central Illinois and that commercial wasn't on our programing. Most were Budweiser and a couple other beers I'm not familiar with. Probably cater to different regions.Pooch
1533534,Shellback,2013-02-05 05:50:00,8083,Canada doesn't have the same commercials as the US. Read a story about it a couple days before the SB.
1533676,youngcanadianguide,2013-02-05 11:00:00,60,"Just saw the commercial again last night on CBS on regular TV . We are currently in the midwest (U.S.) at this time. The commercial still makes us laugh every time we see it. We posted the link because we knew that it may not have been seen in all regions. Also, we thought it might bring some laughs to those who have experienced waiting in line to cross the border."

1535223,youngcanadianguide,2013-02-08 20:20:00,60,"Hey guys,I have reposted the link above and again here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VU62DWte3IEnjoy!"
