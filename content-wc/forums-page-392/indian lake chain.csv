Haven't fished any other times as I've been working on the cabin. I go home mid next week. If you get up into Forest, stop by and say 'hi' if you see me in the yard. Where are you staying?Good luck!81Saluki"

1458175,81Saluki,2012-07-05 17:54:00,97,"Wishin, Yes, the cabin is still on the market. My ""chores"" should end Monday or Tuesday. I might stick around a couple more days to enjoy the fishing. Maybe I'll see you on the water. BTW ... I forgot to mention in my last post ... the fish were biting so good for a couple of days that it nearly didn't matter what was on the end of my line ... a beat-up jig head, a torn up twister tail, and 1/4th a crawler did just fine. Once I ran out of worms and had to come back to the cabin to restock. Hope your luck is as good!! 81Saluki"
