1532886,drew59,2013-02-03 15:50:00,87,My wife and I are regulars. We love the camp and the lake. What do you want to know?
1532890,Wallster,2013-02-03 15:55:00,9,"I am going up there in mid sept. Mostly on a moose hunt. Little fishing once we get a moose or two. Where should a guy fish for walleyes? How deep, bait? Is there any part of the lake that you see moose while out fishing? Thanks for any info you got on the place. Wallster ><((((>"
1532900,drew59,2013-02-03 16:19:00,87,"We've been going spring and fall. We've not seen moose on the lake but have on the drive in. The nice thing about fall is there are walleyes close to camp (not that they're far away in the spring) and the trout are biting. Fish the bars and humps around the islands in 25-40 feet of water. Don't drop a line unless you see fish on your locator. We use 3/8 and 1/2 oz jigs.Mary Jo and Scott are nice folks and the camp is very well kept. The rental boats and docks are great. It's a big lake so you can get away from everyone else. In short, there's a reason we keep going back."

1212686,Mike Borger,2010-06-22 19:44:00,1554,"I've paddled the lake on a couple of occasions enroute to Wabakimi park.Even from a canoe the walleye fishing was stupid.It's a big beautiful lake with very little traffic and one I've always wanted to return to and fish properly.The lodge from what I've seen in passing looks five star. I do know they have very, very nice boats to fish out of.Not much but hope that helps."
1215673,Guest,2010-07-03 14:20:00,0,the place is the best. last year was the first year i missed in 15 years. heading back up the last week of july. cant wait. want more info you can email me at [email protected]
1233507,Bearfangary,2010-09-06 14:31:00,22,I'm heading up to Caribou for the first time on September 16th. Mainly Walleyes and Lakers. I;ve heard nothing but good reports and a few warnings about strong northwest winds. BFG
1233897,Rich B,2010-09-07 20:16:00,1081,"Have a great time and be sure to post a report on the lodge and lake when you get back from your trip.....accommodations, fishing, level of service provided, etc. Safe travels, Rich B"
1273940,bubblehead,2011-02-22 10:38:00,18,"Was up to Forrest Lodge in early June. Fantastic people. Very nice place, clean, well run, right on the water.You can drive right into the place, and the carry from your cabin to the dock is a short level one. I know she's running a special this year on some weeks she's got open. We're going back up there again this year in early June. Great lake for walleye and Trout. Numerous places to fsih. We were there for 7 days and I don't think we fished the same place twice. Highly recommend Forest Lodge and the lake."
1526252,Wallster,2013-01-20 16:40:00,9,Anyone else been to this lake??? I am going up in sept on a moose hunt. Staying at forest lake lodge. How is the fishing there in sept. Is there a lot of moose around. Is there a lot of logged off areas?? Thanks Wallster ><((((>
1526333,Pikeslayer8,2013-01-20 19:50:00,1460,"I was there in Sept. 2011 for a short 3 day trip. I didn't do very well in the fish catching dept., but I do believe Caribou is an excellent fishery. The lake trout are more accessible that time of year and Caribou offers a good chance of catching the elusive ""blue walleye"". The 9 mile road from Armstrong to Forrest Lodge, from what I understand from Scott and Mary Jo, is nearly impassible after dark as the trophy moose all congregate and are all dancing on the road. The drive up 527 is truly spectacular that time of year with the fall foliage. Your trip sounds fantastic, keep us informed how ya do."
1528438,Wallster,2013-01-24 18:41:00,9,Are you going back this year again?? Wallster ><((((>
1528446,Pikeslayer8,2013-01-24 18:50:00,1460,It's a possibility but not a likelihood. Thinking about putting together a fall trip to Wabakimi. Say hi to Scott and Mary Jo for me will ya.
