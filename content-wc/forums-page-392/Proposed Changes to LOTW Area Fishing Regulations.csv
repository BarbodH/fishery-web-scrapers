1534844,Obabikon,2013-02-08 05:43:00,2370,I would guess that amc make up less than 2% of the fish eaten out of LOTW. That'd be 1 in 50. I agree that they should be let go. I'm against the new crappie and perch regulations.
1535154,adempsey,2013-02-08 16:44:00,963,Some of those seem drastic. Do you think the fishery is in that much trouble?
1535229,stillangling,2013-02-08 21:02:00,149,"The fishing on Lake of the Woods is great. One of the things I really appreciate about NW Ontario is the conservative approach that has been taken when it comes to fisheries management. Take a look at the regulations in the NE and southern Ontario in comparison. A good example is zone 15. You can keep 6 bass, any size, 6 pike any size, 50 perch and 30 crappies. Sounds fine but good luck with that because it would take you two weeks! http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business...02_163615.html Do a quick scan of this site when it comes to lakes that users rate as having the best fishing quality. Lac Seul, Lake of the Woods, Lake St. Joe, Eagle....all of these lakes have restrictive angling regulations and all are in the NW. Does anyone need to keep 50 perch, 15 crappies or 12 whitefish to have a good fishing trip? I know I don't. Freezer burnt fish tastes horrible. Move on guys."
1535296,wallydave,2013-02-09 06:04:00,2151,"A good friend of mine ""retired"" from Canadian fishing because of all the rules and regs on LOW! His group would fill a houseboat and head out for a week of fishing. Not any more. It is a tough call to protect the resource and promote the fishing!"
1535312,Bill Krejca,2013-02-09 06:51:00,6107,"I can remember when the LOW crappie limit was unrestricted. One winter, when I was a lad, ice fishing folks were hauling them out through the ice by the literal pickup load. Later the limit was placed at 80, and continued to go down as the years went by. The downward spiral, and continuing lower limits were precipitated by increasingly larger harvests. Some 10 years ago, the number actually seemed to be coming back, according my (and my friend's) catch successes. At the risk of starting an all-out war, it seems reasonable to me that the fish being harvested in the last 10 or so years, especially by other than rod and reel, are causing this downcycle in crappie population. Certainly anglers last year did not do much damage to the crappie population, due to the unusually poor fishing for same. Some say last year was a down year, due to their normal up and down cycle, around 7 years for crappie, if I remember correctly. I sure hope so. I am not against a total possession reduction, going from 15 to 10, but feel this should apply to all types of harvest, not just for anglers. Those of us who have been around a while are aware of which I speak. As to the small-mouth regretful restrictions - Again, this is in my opinion/observation over the years: I believe bass kept to eat are kept pretty much only when not much else is available/able to be caught. I have not met many folks who love eating bass, although my dad did used to occasionally have one for supper. There does not seem to be much of a lack of supply for bass, one of the easiest of fish to catch, most being released. At the risk of instigating argument on this subject, I personally feel additional bass restrictions are being considered for the purpose of creating a larger bass population to promote the region's bass tournament industry and accompanying increased tourism. This is not necessarily a bad thing, just somewhat buried in the culture of why limits are set as they are, and maybe not so evident to the casual angler. I realize my comments may seem controversial to some, but this is just the way I see it. I write this with a regretful tear in my eye, as I have loved this part of the north ever since my first trip there in 1939, and wish nothing but the best for those visiting it and the great folks who make it their home, and their business. It's just that that's just the way I see it. Bill Krejca"
1535539,Obabikon,2013-02-09 18:23:00,2370,No. The fishery has never been better.
1537441,1750 FH,2013-02-13 18:56:00,297,you have a great fishery since adapting the slots why mess with it.unless you are trying to go C&R only.Be care full not to legislate your tourism away.It will be real interesting to see the new regs. on Mille Lacs and what it does to the local economy.
1534450,LOW1,2013-02-07 08:09:00,2828,http://www.lowdpoa.com/news/new-prop...public-review/I don't remember seeing this posted here before and thought that it may be of interest to Rainy River-Lake of the Woods-Shoal Lake-Winnipeg River anglers. Please note that comments are being sought from the public.
1534609,Obabikon,2013-02-07 13:05:00,2370,I got a letter in the mail a couple weeks ago and called to protest the changes.
1534621,LOW1,2013-02-07 13:23:00,2828,What are your concerns?
1534639,@Lunker,2013-02-07 13:51:00,835,"I would favor increased protection for SMB and trophy sized NP, but wonder if subsequent increased perch numbers would be detrimental to walleye and SMB reproduction."
1534717,KTroller,2013-02-07 17:48:00,237,"A question I have is around bass slots and reduced limits on those fish. Are there that many people keeping bass that it has an effect? Just curious. I wouldn't think so but perhaps folks do keep them for the pan even with walleye, perch and crappie in the system.Just curious,KT"
1534735,Obabikon,2013-02-07 18:18:00,2370,"I am for protecting sport fish, but lowering limits of crappie and perch hurts those wanting to take fish home."
1534736,Obabikon,2013-02-07 18:20:00,2370,The number of smb that hit the frying pan is VERY low
1534771,KTroller,2013-02-07 19:34:00,237,"That is what I thought. So I have to wonder what they deem the purpose/effect of bass slots to be. I wouldn't think that they would want to be fostering those populations on lakes where the other species were the primary targets. It hasn't helped walleye populations on lakes like Mille Lacs so I don't really understand the goals. I'm perfectly willing to accept more restrictions on walleye, perch and crappie to help preserve those fisheries but it seems counterintuitive to also restrict bass bag limits if those fish are rarely harvested as it is. There has to be bass predation on the walleye, perch and crappie populations so why not help those fish by keeping the bass limits as they are and thus not risk shifting the population in favor of bass. Don't get me wrong, bass are fun to catch but I have to think that the other species are the primary species they should be protecting on the lakes for which they are proposing these changes. Perhaps I'm missing something. KT"
1534782,@Lunker,2013-02-07 19:51:00,835,"I might tend to disagree. Perhaps percentage-wise, but I see a LOT of smb carried to the fish house at the camp I go to.'Course, I will admit perhaps I'm simply overreacting because I don't believe in killing smb or lmb at all. Just irks the he!! out of me."
1534834,bellbuoy,2013-02-08 03:55:00,490,"Here they are: Black Crappie  change the current regulation from a daily catch and possession limit of S-15, C-10 to S-10, C-5. Lake Whitefish  change the current regulation from a daily catch and possession limit of S-12, C-6 to S-4, C-2. Northern Pike  maintain current catch and possession limits of S-4, C-2 but change the existing size regulation of none between 70-90 cm and not more than 1 greater than 90 cm to 0 greater than 75 cm. Yellow Perch  change the current regulation from a daily catch and possession limit of S-50, C-25 to S-15, C-10. Smallmouth/Largemouth Bass  change the current regulation that applies to Lake of the Woods, Shoal Lake and Kakagi Lake: S-2, C-1 from Jan. 1  May 31 & Dec. 1  31 (must be less than 35 cm): S-0, C-0 from June 1 - 30; and S-4, C-2 from July 1 to Nov. 30. to S-0, C-0 from January 1  June 30; S-4, C-2 from July 1  Dec. 31."
