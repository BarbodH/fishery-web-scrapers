1530700,mr-fish,2013-01-30 07:38:00,58,"We use sealed [no caps] acid batteries which are used in motorcycles,atv's,snowmobiles. Never had a problem. Use a 10 year old depth finder,basic unit. The more bells and whistles the more power you need. We do all our meals at camp."
1530765,adempsey,2013-01-30 09:17:00,963,Thanks for the info guys! Appreciated.I hadn't realized they were different. I assume those are the ones that come with the portable units?
1530772,dog2,2013-01-30 09:24:00,198,"We use sealed battery units .1 is a 12v 7.4amp hr. the other is 12v 9amp hr. These are used in emergency exit lights ,for a charger we also use a solar panel ,these vary in cost I paid$40.00 for mine. the batterys will go 3 full 12/14 hr days. we throw the charger on during lunch and at the end of the day. Quit shore lunches takes too much time out of the days fishing sandwiches; beans an weanies ;sardines you know high fat low calorie stuff."
1530795,pike50plus,2013-01-30 10:08:00,584,"Regular style batteries must be packed a certain way for safety on all flights, fyi!"
1530807,SinOrSwim,2013-01-30 10:27:00,1528,"We have done fly-ins for about 17 years. Our outfitter for the last 12 years or so has propane cookers at the outpost to take with us for shore lunch. Prior to that, we cooked over a fire. Take a long turkey fryer thermometer regardless to keep your oil the right temp. You know exactly what your temp is regardless of usig propane or fire. If your outfitter doesn't have the cooker, find one that does. Most of them do now.Fish finders. We ahve always taken our finders and whatever batteries they run on. I have a flexible solar panel I attach to mine while in the boat. About the size of a flexible cutting board. I made pigtails to attach it while it's hooked up. We also take a small inverter and hook it up to the house batteries or the battery that runs the water pumps. We have never run out of solar lights either. You can hook up an inverter to the house battery bank, use your regular battery charger and it's fine. As long as you aren't charging 15 batteries, you will be fine. Same with camera batteries.We do take a tote with us with a list for shore lunch. It has all the stuff we need, tongs, plates, papertowels, batter etc. Use the list so you don't forget stuff. Nothing worse than stopping for shore lunch and having forgotten batter. I'm amazed at how many people DON'T do shore lunch or just do basic stuff. To me, that IS what Canada trips are about. I don't know if there is anything better than catching walleye all morning, pulling over and cooking them. We slice the walleye in strips, batter, fry and place in a tortilla. A bag of shredded lettuce or slaw, zip lock of bacon bits, onions and some sort of sauce for one of THE best fish tacos ever. Take a carton of sour cream mix with garlic, shallot, cilantro, lime and chipotle peppers. Make before you go. Baja walleye taco!!!! Anybody you go with will be astounded with your abilities. Or, we also take buffalo wild wings sauces for the tacos or wraps. Step it up a notch and fry your tortilla into a taco shell for a crispy taco. Ahhh, can't wait!!!!! Other favorites:Cajun Seafood Alfredo. Shrimp, walleye etc in alfredo sauce with pastaWalleye/seafood Chimi's. My all time favorite. To me, the trip is all about the experience and not just the fishing. Shore lunches, great meals at the cabin are part of it. Along with enjoying the cocktails on the dock etc. Then again, we aren't fish sun up to sun down and them fish more at night."
1530828,Mr. Sauger,2013-01-30 11:10:00,285,"Fly Ins are all about the right balance between packing light and efficient and having the right toys to have your fun. Part of the fun is tweaking all year.I have an older Humminbird monochrome portable that runs all week on two 6 volt batteries. That is all I need on a remote fly in lake. We used to bring a spare pair of batteries which was a waste of space, weight and moolah. We're mostly just marking depth, not spotting suspended fish. Bottom is mostly hard rock anyway. Like others mentioned, color and GPS will eat up juice in a few days. We usually had a few shore lunches for fun and tradition when we planned to be fishing far from the cabin. Gathering good firewood and getting the fire down to coals was key while others cleaned fish, cut onions, etc. One heavy skillet for the fish. Cooked the beans and corn right in the cans. Used a needle nose pliers to handle the hot stuff. Used fillet knife to whittle sporks when we forget silverware. Sneak garbage bag in other boat. Sometimes you may not be allowed open fires due to forest fire risk. A small one burner camping stove speeds things up a lot and is a lot easier to regulate the cooking temperature. Keeping it simple adds to the adventure."
1531039,RolandDeschain,2013-01-30 17:07:00,30,"I have used the same D cell portable depth finder for almost 20 years. If I start with fresh batteries they will last the week. As others have mentioned, most cabins will have an outdoor propane fish cooking set up. Generally what we do is have our big meals/fish frys in the middle of the day back at the cabin. Some lakes are set up better for shore lunches than others. If the lake has a nice shore lunch spot, especially by a run in or out, we always take advantage of it. I used to bring a Coleman stove, but its just more trouble than its worth. There is always plenty of firewood laying around and it only takes a few minutes to get a fire going and get hot enough to cook."
1531500,bullhockey,2013-01-31 14:35:00,41,"we go to nakina each year and take 2 depth finders. run off double A batteries and they last almost the whole week for us.we use them almopst constantly. we just take an extra aset along and fly them in in pur pockets. we are really cheap. have only 110 lbs per man LOL. also have to have a generator for a CPAP so we can charge batt. for cameras, etc."
1530281,adempsey,2013-01-29 09:48:00,963,"If you bring in sonar/depth finder do you have one that runs off of alkaline batteries? or do you bring your 12V lead-acid batteries? How do you normally charge it up? Anyone use a solar charger?Do you bring a shore lunch kit? Coleman stove etc.??Thanks!edit: Sorry, was referring to a fly-in outpost."
1530283,tooski,2013-01-29 09:58:00,393,"Dempsey, If you are talking fly-in then no, we don't take shore lunch kit or coleman stove. We do take our coleman lantern however. I will say shore lunches are usually pretty minimal for us. Maybe hot dogs and beans once or twice."
1530288,nitrodude,2013-01-29 10:10:00,60,"Two 6 volt lantern batteries or 8 D batteries will give you 12 volts and amperage to run a depth finder. GPS, color screen, high return sonar speeds, etc. will shorten the battery life, but with a simple depth finder I can usually get a weeks worth out of a single set unless ran constantly. Good luck!"
1530300,Seanik,2013-01-29 10:24:00,218,"Hi Adempsey, We use 12V lead acid batteries about the size of 8 ""D"" cells and a 5 watt solar charger from Walmart ($42.00) The Lowrance elite-4 color fishfinder/gps drains the battery with about 2 days constant usage. The 2nd battery is always on the solar charger and ready when we need it. We fish at Flindt Landing camp and are usually within 20 mins of the cabin so lunch is at the cabin. Sometimes we venture further up Heathcote Lake and the shore lunch is Walleyes and beans and for the gourmet in our group spam and beans with fruit cocktail. Yes, cabin fever is in full bloom. Seanik"
1530361,adempsey,2013-01-29 11:52:00,963,"Thanks for the answers guys.Asking more out of curiosity because during my research several fly-in outpost outfitters suggest bringing a shore-lunch kit - including the portable stove. Which I thought odd due to the weight etc. I also assumed they would provide what you needed at the cabin - well, minus a stove.As for the batteries, I only ask because I've noticed a few air services state that the 12V lead acid batteries are not permitted on the flight. So I was wondering how many people adhere to that or not. Also, if there are any alternatives.I assume a very basic depth finder. Sounds like the 8 D-Cells can last the whole week. Not sure I would want to bring 8 spares. Anyone use rechargable ones? Do the 6V lantern batteries last longer?Thanks."
1530391,oleJoe,2013-01-29 13:04:00,114,"We take a coleman latern that is propane and 2 tanks as for the locator, its 8 AA batteries and they will last the week usually if you turn it off when eating and when the day is done. We usually take spares anyway for that and flashlights. Never do shore lunch. Big breakfast and big supper. Shore lunch is 2 beers and cheese crackers. (always good). Enjoy it!!"
1530433,epiepenburg,2013-01-29 14:34:00,365,"We bring portable locators along. One of them runs on D's and will make it all week on a set, the other runs on AA's and usually requires a change during the week. Our outpost has a propane fryer stand and propane, we just need to bring the basket for the fryer."
1530464,Larry S,2013-01-29 15:58:00,665,"Use a Hummingbird Portable depth finder,it runs on 8 AA batteries which will usually last for 7 days,but since I go on 10 day trips I take an extra set of batteries We never bother with a shore lunch kit,take cheese,canned meats,crackers,cookies and sausage for lunches. Have a large Breakfast and large Dinner. Not messing around with a large,time consuming shore lunch gives us more time to fish"
1530503,fosterthedog,2013-01-29 17:11:00,51,"I use two 6 volt lantern batteries,on a small fishfinder, make a jumper with alligator clips and and 12-14 gauge wire. Put the jumper (+) to (-) between the two batteries, red power wire from fishfinder to open (+) terminal on one battery with black power wire going to (-) terminal on the other battery. Turn down your back light to 0%, lasts me on a 7 day, try to get freshest batteries you can. Got suction cup mount for the transducer and take a 3M Scotchbrite pad to clean where it mounts on the boat. Good Luck"
1530628,zeebee,2013-01-30 04:18:00,1144,No need for a coleman......last time I went up there was plenty of firewood. Doubt things have changed. If theres a BBQ in camp you can use the grate and most camps have cast iron skillets. Taking a coleman and a propane tank on a fly-in is extra weight . Gotta be a little resourceful on fly-ins. Talk to the outfitter.
