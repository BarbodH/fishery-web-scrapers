All as I can say is the fishing at Obabikon is really good, you really don't have to run to catch fish. And you can always get out of wind too. Just remember to bring some pork chops for Jared........ he looooves them !"
1534845,Obabikon,2013-02-08 05:44:00,2370,Haha
1534902,Maskinonge,2013-02-08 08:20:00,13,"Speaking of Jared, I was just leafing through a 2012 back issue of In-Fisherman and saw a familiar name in the destinations section. Obabikon, that has to be you, right?"
1535088,Bill Krejca,2013-02-08 14:11:00,6107,"That be him holding a muskie, if I remember correctly. his camp is in the background. Great reef for a variety of fish about where the picture was taken. Bill Krejca"
1535544,Obabikon,2013-02-09 18:27:00,2370,Lol... Yeah. Was out evening fishing with my wife when I caught that fish.
1535688,1700SS,2013-02-10 07:29:00,104,"Call Mike @ red wing and reserve Lenny(their guide) for your first couple days there. That is my best advice. Quite nice of Jared to mark up a map for you, even if you are staying at one of his competitor's. Jared, you still have that pic Bill is talking about? Could you post it here. I would like to see that spot, I mean fish."
1535858,Obabikon,2013-02-10 13:17:00,2370,Go to www.obabikon.com. The pic of me on the front page is the same one.
1528453,Maskinonge,2013-01-24 19:07:00,13,"First post, thanks for any information you can provide. For walleyes alone, where would you go? Sabaskong Bay (resort is about 8 miles from Miles Bay) or Northern edge of Eagle Lake? This will be a week-long trip, June 15-23. Unfortunately mayflies might be an issue, but it's the only possible week."
1528455,Rich B,2013-01-24 19:15:00,1081,"Mask, First, welcome aboard to Walleye Central.....I don't know the answer to your question regarding Eagle Lake v. LOTW, though there is a current series of posts regarding the Mayfly Hatch on this Canada, Eh ? section, and how to fish the hatch (info is excellent). No doubt others will be able to give you answers on your question, though I'd look over the information in these posts on fishing the Mayfly hatch if you have not already done so. Have a great time in June at which ever lake you decide to fish (I don't think you can really go wrong with either location). Rich B"
1528457,Maskinonge,2013-01-24 19:20:00,13,"Thanks Rich, will do."
1528458,fishguide1800,2013-01-24 19:21:00,84,"I can only speak for eagle as i have not fished lotw,dont need to,eagle has everything i need,you wouldnt be dissappointed going to either lake iam sure,northern edge,you talking the vermilion bay area or the eagle river area"
1528477,Obabikon,2013-01-24 19:48:00,2370,"I'm biased of course, but miles bay has some amazing walleye fishing. Eagle has clearer water, and both usually have great fishing"
1529143,Maskinonge,2013-01-26 11:35:00,13,"I know you were on pins and needles wondering where we were going. We ended up at Red Wing Lodge on the edge of Sabaskong Bay. Looking forward to it. Obabikon, any tips on the area? Will be our first time up there - so any info would be great. My understanding is that the bite will depend on the spring and the mayflies - if it's a cold, late spring, fish will still be reasonably shallow and shoreline oriented, whereas if it's an early summer and warm spring, the bite will be more on reef/rock humps in open water. How do you tend to fish Miles Bay?"
1529205,Obabikon,2013-01-26 15:31:00,2370,"Swing by the camp on your way to miles, and I'll get you fresh updates marking up a map. Fishing 8-12 foot humps"
1529224,Maskinonge,2013-01-26 16:00:00,13,"We might have to take you up on that Obabikon - looks like you have quite the setup up at your lodge as well - just browsed your website - we will have to keep that in mind for future trips. This one was kind of last minute, though. I asked the folks at Red Wing about Miles Bay and they agreed that it was great water, about 25 - 35 minute boat ride away from where we'll be at the end of the road north of Morson. I'm sure there's some great water even closer to us, too. Sabaskong has some walleye reefs, humps spots of its own, and we're going to be up for trying a little bit of everything. Certainly will make it up to Miles a few times, though, just to see what the buzz is all about. Ha. Have you had any luck with gulp minnows or something like them as opposed to the real thing? And do you usually us a jig an plastic tipped with live bait, or just jig and minnow? OK, sorry for the flood of questions. Just excited to get onto LOTW for the first time."
1530188,Obabikon,2013-01-29 06:42:00,2370,"I'm not huge on gulp, but they do work. Especially when the fish are biting well"
1534755,1750 FH,2013-02-07 18:58:00,297,"Stayed at Mylies the last 2 years on the south end of Sabaskong great fishing all over,been up to miles bay,not a bad ride doesnt take to long 20 minutes after the first trip. Have a great time we used live bait when we were there."
