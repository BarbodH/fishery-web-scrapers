1529588,port1042,2013-01-27 16:09:00,509,"I'll be heading up to Perrault Lake in late May. Are there any places where we might do some shore fishing on the way up? Last year we ended up in International Falls much earlier than we expected and also ended up at Perrault Falls earlier than expected. We thought this year we might be able to stop somewhere along the way on Friday evening or Saturday morning and try some casting. Any suggestions? We normally take Hwy. 71 north (through Nestor Falls) and Hwy. 17 (east to Vermilion Bay) and then north on Hwy 105 -- but I would consider taking Hwy. 502 to Dryden if there is a place to fish. Are there any places where we might shore fish around Fort Francis, Emo, Nestor Falls, Kenora or Vermilion Bay? (We will have Ontario licences but not Minnesota.) Also, any suggestions of motels along this route beyond Fort Francis?"

This is a narrow channel that separates Whitefish Bay of LOTW from Regina Bay. The north side will have less boat traffic than the south because of the large underwater rock partially blocking the channel on the north so that's where I'd start, but I have also seen many folks on the south. The north side is a public park."

1532471,port1042,2013-02-02 14:43:00,509,Thanks for the advice. I was able to book one of the motel rooms at the Arrowhead Resort in Nestor Falls for Friday night. We'll be able to fish Friday evening and Saturday morning around Nestor Falls and Sioux Narrows before heading on the Perrault Lake for a week of fishing on Saturday. Can't wait! (Does anyone know anything about Crooked Pine Lake?)
