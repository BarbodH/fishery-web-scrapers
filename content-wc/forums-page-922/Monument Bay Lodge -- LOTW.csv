I don't know much about the area you'll be in, but I've seen lots of good reports from that area. I've talked to only one guy who stayed at Monument Bay, and he wasn't impressed. But, I have no first hand knowledge about the lodge. I go up twice a year (Aug. and Oct.) for 10 days each trip and stay at a lodge in Miles Bay area (southeastern part of the lake, nearest town is Morson, ON). Good luck!"

Our party is normally 6 or 7 guys with 3 boats and we did very well there. Muskie fishing is our thing but fishing for anything is good around there. We stayed in the ""Mallards Nest"" cabin and it was very roomy and comfortable. Try to get that one if you can. I have been going to LOTW every year for the past 16 years and stayed at 5 different resorts on different parts of the lake and Monument Bay is as good as any of them. As another post said, I'm not sure what your used to but all of the resorts I've stayed at are a little ""Rustic"" and that has always been fine by us as long as there is good fishing.All resorts seem to be continually making things a little better and I'm sure Monument bay has added a few things since I was last there.I go every year to LOTW and I am always impressed by it, I have been there when the weather was beautiful and when it was a nightmare. It's 100 square miles, 14,000 + islands. It's BIG.You will need maps and such but they are available at Monument Bay along with a few other things, they have a decent store.Go to their website at www.monumentbay.com and contact them with any questions you have. They are great people and I'm sure you'll be very satisfied with the service. I would go back in a minute. Scott"
