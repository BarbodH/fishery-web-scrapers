524367,Setter,2002-09-18 14:15:00,165,Is anybody having second thoughts about going up to the Red River this fall? Were supposed to go up in a couple weeks. I'm just curious about how all of you feel about this? Is it even going to be worth going up? Will the fish bite? Is there going to be long term affects? Thanks to all who reply. Ryan(Setter)Hale

No matter what kind of spin they put on it, it sure can't be good.This spring my favorite local lake had a few million litres of ""treated sewage"" dumped into it. The spring walleye tournament that usually has 1500 fish caught had just over 200 fish caught. And the fall classic had the lowest number of fish caught in it's history. We also had a very late spring but I don't think that affected the fishing as much as the sewage did. Raw sewage dumped into a water body has to affect the ecosystem for sometime but it will depend on the water flow in the river and if you are planning on fishing upstream or downstream of the dumping site. My guess would be the downstream fish would have some pretty bad breath."

But still, that's a lot of sh*t!"

There is a lot a water to accomodate everyone, its too bad there are not more boat launches in the Pine Falls area."
524371,Hawgeye,2002-09-19 18:26:00,1355,"Anyone know the latest on the sewage spill? Have they gotten it fixed yet? If so, I understand that it would not take but a couple of hours to flush it out to the lake. Any updates are very welcome!"
524372,Guest,2002-09-19 19:19:00,0,"The city of winnipeg has got the spill stopped now,but it will be 4-5 DAYS, not hours,before the sewage is out to the lake. This is from our local news cast.The greenbacks are going now,and the weekend forecast is for cool temps and a brisk northwest wind.Perfect weather for Red river greenbacks!"
524373,Backwater Eddy,2002-09-19 20:47:00,3871,"Spill is stopped.City may be faced with big fine and charges.~~~~~~~~~A report from Stu McKay at Lockport.""Cat""illac manLockportCanada[email protected]Thursday September 19, 200207:28:52 PMLatest on the trials and tibulations of the Red! As of approximately 5:00 am this morning, they stopped the flow of sewage from entering into the Red. ( Prayers answered)! Lets see what type of penalty will be handed out too the city for this outrageous and incompetent act! I only hope that the powers too be act in the best interest of this incrible resource. There has too be a strong,clear message sent that this type of negligence will not and cannot be tolerated. No exceptions please! On a more positive note: (fishing update) Fished for 'eyes late this afternoon from 5:30 til 7:50 pm. There were two of us and together we managed eight walleye, twelve sauger and three large kitties. All fish were taken on 3/8 oz. orange jigs tipped with a salty. We fished just north of channel marker 38. Depth was twelve feet. In a nutshell, the event that has just taken place hasn't seemed to have any negative effect, (thus far)! Another foot note: The cats are absolutely nuts! I mean they are spanking any kind of quality cutbait such as goldeye or tulibee. We're finding them in shallow aswell as deep water. One angler claims to have caught seventeen cats on corks near the eastside rock pile below the dam. He claims that he was only there less than an hour before his bait (goldeye) was depleted. Til next time, Stu ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Backwater Eddy...><sUMo>"
