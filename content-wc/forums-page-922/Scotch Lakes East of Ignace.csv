Does anyone have any information about Upper and Lower Scotch Lakes. It is called English River Outfitters he has cabins, a motel, and a restaurant. The owner is from Spooner, Wisconsin. I talked to one person about it and his reports sounded good, just looking for some additional information. Thanks for any help in advance."

Lower Scotch is a good lake for early and late season walleye, but the river leading to it can be a tough one in low water conditons. You will also have to make about a 10 mile run on a gravel road everyday. There are alot better choices in the Ignace area. Try Agimac Outfitters on Indian Lake just north of Ignace. They have direct acess to some fine W fishing and you can access 5 or 6 more area lakes with a short drive."
