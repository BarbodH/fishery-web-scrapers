Try jacksons hole, the wanipitie,the rapids before the chutes and the channel by alcatraze for walleye and bass. While you are there you should take a trip out to the bay with a guide it is worth the trip. We caught a real nice muskie out there on sat. Most eyes were caught on worm harnesses and worms with lime green blades, the muskie and most pike were caught on bucktails and spoons let us know how you make out!!!"
