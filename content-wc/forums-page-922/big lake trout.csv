524273,Guest,2002-09-17 19:02:00,0,"I've been to Nueltin 6 times. It is hard not to get at least 5 trophies while you are there. If you hit it right you can triple that figure. There are plenty of trophy pike also.Besides all that,it is a superior lodge in every respect."

524269,gms,2002-09-13 21:50:00,91,"If money is no object you can't go wrong with the list Outdoor Canada has provided as the top 5 in Canada1. Great Bear Lake, NWT - Plummer's www.canadianarcticfishing.com)2. Great Slave Lake, NWT - Plummer's (www.canadianarcticfishing.com)3. Kasba Lake, NWT - Kasba Lake Lodge (www.kasba.com)4. Victoria Island, NWT 5. Nueltin Lake, MB - Neultin Lake Lodge (www.nueltin.com) We are looking to go to Great Bear Lake this year as this would be the pinnacle of Laker fishing.Good luck"
524270,BD,2002-09-14 04:54:00,739,"I'm going up to the Atikokan area next week. I will be getting to the camp a day ahead of everyone else and wanted to try for lakers before the other guys showed up. I think the lakers will still be deep, but due to the access points, I will be limited to my old 14' Lund (no downriggers). What do you suggest for a plan of action? Would jigging with spoons, Swedish Pimples or Sonar type lures be a good way to go? Thanks for your help."
524271,brianj,2002-09-14 05:17:00,64,"We have been successful using a 2 oz bucktail jig, yellow and white seem to work the best. You can drift along and bomb for lake trout. I have found it is key to try to keep the lure as vertical as possible. If windy you may need a drift sock. All you do with this lure is drop it to the bottom and reel it back up. Sometimes speed matters, you have to let the fish tell you what they want. If real deep, we don't drop over about 150 ft. Stop the lure early and reel back up.We have also been successful using the same basic method but we use a shad rap. Number 8 or 9 deep runners work. Put a 2-3oz wt about 6 ft in front of lure. Tie a leader and shad rap to end of leader. Make a short cast in same direction you are drifting and let it fall. Then reel it up. Firetiger and chartruese/white have been most effective.Let us know if you tried these methods and if you had any success."
524272,Guest,2002-09-14 15:44:00,0,"You cannot go wrong with staying in the Atikokan area. Try Browns Clearwater West Lodge. The trout are spawning right now (shallow) 30' - 15' reefs. The owner ""Barry"" will help you locating the trout. The lake trout season ends the end of Sept. If you have any questions please e-mail me at [email protected]"
524274,phishfearme,2002-09-15 08:15:00,1242,"tim - i'd strongly recommend conifer lake with excellent adventures out of ear falls. we spent a week at that lake a few years ago and did really well on lakers. 10-15 a day for each of us in july was no problem. they ranged from 18"" to 27"" and i'll bet there's bigger ones. this option (a private cabin on a fly-in lake) would be priced between the northwest territories places (really expensive) and the antikokan area which are pretty reasonable.also, springpole lake with lac seul/amik outfitters outta ear falls is also a laker lake that has produced 20-30 pound lakers. we were just there this past july and one of our guys caught a 33""er.phish"
524275,doc,2002-09-16 06:41:00,143,Don't overlook Lake Athabaska in northern Saskatchewan. We were there last year and caught 10 over 30 lb and 3 over 40.www.lakersunlimited.com
524279,Bobby,2002-09-16 18:59:00,211,"I've seen several fishing shows and magazine articles about Lake Nipigon in Ontario. Here are some claims in an article I've recently read (""The Outdoors Guide""), published out of Thunder Bay:""By early afternoon we landed 11 Lake Trout...several in the 25 to 30 pound class."" ""Forty pound Lake Trout are caught each year."" ""The average size Lake Trout is estimated at 17 pounds."" ""A 55 pounder is currently the unofficial record however tales of 60 and 70 pound fish and even bigger Lake Trout have been reported by commercial fishermen."" The author says Lake Nipigon is the best drive-to trophy Lake Trout fishing in Ontario, possibly the world. I don't know, I've never been there and for all I know, ""The Outdoors Guide"" may just be a travel/tourism magazine! But I have seen fishing shows about this lake, including one where the guy said it was better for trophy Lakers than Great Bear Lake (Fishing Canada, I think, don't quote me...) Just thought I'd mention this."
