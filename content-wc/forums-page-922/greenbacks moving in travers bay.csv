Have not been out myself but will be going out sunday. I will post numbers, sizes and presentaion. Two years ago by mid september it was a complete smorg out there, could be an indication it will be the same this year....yee ha!!!!"

523726,Guest,2002-09-11 20:38:00,0,"Saw your posting indicating that you would be posting results of your fishing on lake Ttaverse last week in August. Would be interested in your success or lack there of. Please post results. We plan to go early this year, last four days of September and hope this is not a mistake. The two tournaments in mid-October have made it difficult to compete for rooms and or a spot to fish without hundreds of boats."
523727,Guest,2002-09-12 13:13:00,0,Did not make it out that week but Went out Sunday and Monday of this week...Day 1 was not so hot day 2 we did ok. Nothing big yet.

523729,Guest,2002-09-13 16:04:00,0,"Hawgeye:We will be driving a Suburban, marroon and sand color with a green and white Warrior boat. Would be fun to visit and compare what is and is not working while we are there. We will also be staying at the Papertown Motor Inn. Look forward to seeing you!"

523731,Guest,2002-09-13 22:17:00,0,"OOPs, one more thing. The last week of Sept. will be pretty close to the full moon. There is so much georging going on at night that the daylight seems to slow quite a lot.Lawrence"
523732,Hawgeye,2002-09-16 22:05:00,1355,What is the latest? How about the Red near Selkirk? Any updates would be greatly appreciated. I know we have been tooooooooo warm but sometimes I have done well early when it has been warm...just curious what the locals have to say...
523733,gms,2002-09-17 17:38:00,91,"Just got back from Pine Falls (Sept. 17th, 2002), there were only 2 boats out on Traverse Bay (and we were one of them). Winds were SE 30km gusting to 50km. Tough slugging in the waves, caught 9 smaller greenbacks jigging and 5 pulling crankbaits. Biggest was only 20 inches....still a lot of rough fish in the area. Caught some white bass, perch and freshwater drum (silver bass). Four of the greenbacks we caught trolling were about 12inches in length.Water temperature is 19 Celcius and there is very little current.At the parking lot (mill) there were only 8 boat trailers."
