524289,Guest,2002-09-15 08:36:00,0,"Wondering if any of you have any experience, good or bad with these rods? I've tried to look at them at my local store, but they were on sale and constantly out of or very low in stock. Some one must be using them. They seem to blow out of there. Thanks in advance."
524290,AL,2002-09-15 17:23:00,89,"Whit,Bass Pro built a store a few years ago where I live and I've purchased several of their rods over the last 3-4 years. The last three years I have walleye and piked fished Canada exclusively with the BPS XPS rod. I have a 7' heavy (pike), (3) 6 1/2' medium heavy, a 6 1/2' medium and a 6' medium all for Walleye. I have nothing negative to say what so ever. The sensitivety is excellent! I broke a rod two years ago (car window) and one last year (snag) and Bass Pro replaced both without any questions. I compare this rod closely with the 2 G. Loomis rods I have in both performance and looks.AL"
524291,Guest,2002-09-15 20:09:00,0,"I have three of these rods and love them, one ML two piece 6'6"" for walleye (have taken 11 lbs and 10lbs with it) broke it and it was replaced by BP. Got a 7' heavy for pike and a 6' one piece for bass and some walleye."
524292,GR8WTHUNTER,2002-09-15 20:39:00,618,I have 4 xps bait casters. I use them more than my st criox rods. Buy one even if you have to do the mail order. Put the money saved into a high quality reel and put it to a real test - on the water. Rich
524293,Guest,2002-09-16 10:26:00,0,thanks guys for the info. a common thread running in your responses is broken rods. is this something unique to bps exp rods or is it a problem that exists with all of these high modulus graphite rods?
524294,AL,2002-09-16 12:28:00,89,"Whit,Neither of the rods I broke was due to the material of craftsmanship of the rod. It was the user. I was simply communicating how easy it is to get a replacement. I break expensive rods as well...."
524295,Guest,2002-09-16 12:36:00,0,"No,broke rod was my fault they just replaced it promptly."
524296,Guest,2002-09-16 13:29:00,0,"Been fishing with them for a while. Before that I used their ""Bionic Blade"" rod series which is also a great rod for the price. The rod quality for both is not only great but Bass Pro return policy is #1. I have returned two broken rods and they both were replaced without question."
524297,Guest,2002-09-16 16:07:00,0,thanks again guys. about 10 years ago i bought an expensive (for me) graphite rod. over $100 back then. i snapped it in half shortly after the warranty period hitting a 1 pound channel cat while on a white bass/walleye fishing trip to kansas. thus my nervousness. whit
