524241,Tom,2002-09-12 21:25:00,1063,"Try Silver Water Wheel Lodge on Lac Seul....You will both love it...Great fishing,food and BIG FISH"
524242,Guest,2002-09-12 21:48:00,0,"If you don't care to travel too far north of Ft Frances, try Clearwater / Pipestone chain. about 60 miles north on hwy 71.Happy Landings Lodge on Pipestone would take ""reel"" good care of you.The walleye are returning to Pipestone and looking for lunch.Also a very spectacular, scenic glacier cut lake .7 out"
524243,Fuzz,2002-09-13 06:56:00,85,"Wayne, I highly recommend Reel 'em Inn Lodge on Lake of the Woods. It is only a 11 hour drive from Des Moines, IA to Morson, Ontario, then a 25 mile beautiful boat ride out to the lodge on Alexandria Island in the center of the lake. Very remote area of the lake, almost seems like a fly-in. 18' Alumamarine boats with 40 hp Yamaha 4-strokes. Boats rigged with seats, locators, radios. Guides available. American Plan- they do all the cooking- great meals, great service. They clean the fish. $125/day includes everything including boat, motor, gas. Doesn't include license and any beverages you wish to bring. They don't charge extra for ice, fish cleaning, etc. like a lot of places. You can do it for less than $1000 each for 7 days. Fishing is great in July...it's a good month to go, better chance of stable nice weather. I was there this year mid-July and it was great....with 2 in my boat we averaged 50 walleyes per day with the largest one 8.5#, 29"". We were pulling plugs and catching bigger fish than other guests who were catching more quantity than us, but smaller fish. I took my Dad there when he was about 75 and he was very comfortable. If you want more information email me.Fuzz"
524244,catchNrelease,2002-09-13 14:10:00,157,"Wayne, Check out www.Templebay.com. It's on Eagle Lake and they have a nice package. A week of fishing w\ guide, meals, shore lunch, and cabin for about your price range. As part of the package they have a quasi comfortable bus that will take you there from pickup points in Il, WI, and Mn. I took my Dad there this year and the guide did an excellent job taking care of ""the old man."" Tied the jigs and baited the hooks for him so I was able to fish the whole time. Good time and great fishing.catchNrelease"
524245,csm,2002-09-13 16:24:00,0,"I would recommend Silver Water Wheel Lodge, Outstanding service, great fishing and the best boats at any of the lodges I have been too (18 foot Lunds with 80 HP Yamahas. I have been going with my father (72 years old) for four years and he loves the place. There are lots of great places in Great White, but the fishing on Lac Seul is at or near the top and this is one of the best places on Lac Seul...csm"
524246,Guest,2002-09-14 14:30:00,0,"My strong recommendation for you is Anderson's Lodge in Sioux Lookout, ONT. Their base camp is located on Pelican Lake which is in between Minnitaki and Lac Seul. Their accomodations are excellant and they have a full American Plan w/ fantastic food...this includes a guide AND 20' Lund Cruisers which would be VERY comfortable for someone a bit older. I made two trips there this year w/ great success both times. I have fished Canada for 20+ years and never had a better experience....they are very service oriented. A five night 4 day trip would be right around the $1,000 price you were looking for. Feel free to email me if you have more qeustions @ [email protected]."
