Walleye fishing was good pulling spinners w/minnows, caught fish on both weed lines and rock reefs. Also did lots of casting for pike/muskie with mixed results. As usual, when we had overcast skies fishing was much better. Lagrest pike was 15#, lots of muskie follows but none caught. We even spent a half day fishing crappies in Miles bay with ok results. Tight Lines !!"
