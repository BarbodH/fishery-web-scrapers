I do not fault anyone who fishes/hunts legally and stays within the daily & possesion limits. I trust DNR people to be competent at setting the regs according to the pressure a lake receives. I may practice catch and release a little more than some, but I take home a few limits each year for the table too. IaCraig"

We have read for years that the biggest trophy deer come from their trophy fathers. Big Walleye mommas produce big Walleye mommas."
522854,Jim,2002-08-08 07:58:00,238,"Rick, you said it very well. The DNR folks set the guidelines and no one should feel guilty for abiding by them. Nobody should consider themselves the sole authority on this issue. So, relax everyone, and enjoy the experience."

522857,Guest,2002-08-09 04:49:00,0,"Try it you'll love it- get at least a 26""+ eye early in the spring. Carefully milk all the eggs out and release her and make sure she's fine. Take the eggs and saute them in fry pan w/ butter and onions about 12 mins. Great on toast or as appitzer with them 13""ers we should be keeping. You'll never look at a hawg eye the same again and hey just think if that same fish isn't caught again next spring she can spawn again!! Eyes over 30"" got what couple years left?? Should be putting the 19-25""ers back- they have years left to spawn and don't hold enough eggs to make it worth milking!"

522861,Guest,2002-08-27 07:12:00,0,"I have read this entire section and its very interesting. It seems that a lot of fisherman believe in Catch and Release to the ultimate while others have varying degrees of commitment to catch and release. It is 100% correct to follow the possesion laws of the lake you are fishing and these fisherman should not be judged for doing what is legal. Those fisherman who think only small Walleye should be eaten and all others released should also not be spat upon. The viability of tomorrows fishing is all of our responsibility and a mixture of both approaches seems to be working. Lets all keep catching fish and enjoying the gift that Mother Nature has bestowed on us....eat want you can and release when you want and fish for enjoyment......By the way the original inquiry of this post was ""BIG WALLEYE""....Proud to report that Lake Winnipeg gave me a 32"" beauty in July...she was caught on a Smithwick Rouge on a bottom bouncer in 12' of water at about 8:00 PM....released her."

This year we took his 10 year old son for the first time. His excitement was contagious, cant wait until next year. Life is great with a rod and reel in your hand.

The law allows one big fish which leaves it open for judgement. I hear new slot limits will be enforced next year but will still allow for one over the slot. Like to see a way to limit the big ones being removed, but don't think they will address. I like giving them big ones a good looking over, a few pictures and put them back for the next time. Not everyone agrees with that nor do they have to. I just don't have to fish with those that don't. Had a great trip to Lac Seul this year, lots of fish, consistent bite all week. Lots of 27, 28, 29 but no 30's, but again just a helluva trip. Enjoy your fishing fellas! Go Hawks!"

Besides, a big old fish like that tastes like crud!! I see nothing but lazy hillbillies on this board, who are too drunk to clean 5 two pounders so they just clean one, so's I'd reckon. We should all try to think of the future a little bit harder. Don't you want all your hillbilly children to be able enjoy fishing as well? Think of them too and not just yourselves.

522851,ohdaddy,2002-08-07 18:37:00,21,"Krusty, I could not agree more. I have caught more tan 100 5lb plus walleye but have never eaten one larger than 2lbs. I know that 2lbs and less are the best eating walleye in the world. Only a trophy walleye (10lb +) should be taken to mount. Not eat!!!!!!!!!!!! and if you have one, (10+) then you don't need a second! Coservation is the only wat to go!"
522852,Walleye Wacker,2002-08-07 19:03:00,6,"oh daddy, I agree with everything you say except for one item. I think a trophy should be a facsimile mount. They last longer and the cost is relativly the same and it puts spawn back in the lake. There is no doubt that Walleye fishing is better in all the lakes when only two pounders get removed."
522853,Rick,2002-08-08 06:20:00,226,"You seem to be so proud of your opinions, why don't you carry a sign up and down the docks on Lake Erie this fall and let the charter captains know your feelings. Take a look at the numbers of 5-10 lb. fish in their coolers and call them hillbilly-losers to their faces.The real hillbillies and losers are those who try to force their personal opinions on others who fish within the regulations set up by the states or provinces. Most of the fish I used to keep to eat now seem to be protected by slot limits so if I keep a LEGAL fish that offends you, get over it."
522855,Jigger1,2002-08-08 06:28:00,234,"Throw big ones back, study saysBy Paul RecerASSOCIATED PRESSWASHINGTON - Most fishermen like to catch and keep the big ones and throw the little guys back, but a new study suggests that it's better for the fish species to do exactly the opposite.In a study in the journal Science, researchers at the Stony Brook University in New York conducted a four-generation laboratory study of fish and found that when the bigger fish are allowed to live, eventually the species may double in size and number.The study, led by David O. Conover, a professor at the Marine Sciences Research Center at Stony Brook, experimented with a species called the Atlantic silverside, a small fish that lives, reproduces and dies within a single year.The silverside is commonly used as bait by sports fishermen in the Northeast.Conover said the experiment started with 1,000 fish in each of three groups. In one group, the scientist harvested the 900 largest fish.In a second group, they took the 900 smallest fish, and in the third group the fish were harvested randomly in size.Then all three groups were allowed to reproduce and the cycle started all over again.In the first year, the largest-harvested group produced the most weight or biomass, while the smallest-harvested group produced the least.But after that, the biomass production roles reversed. Conover said that in each succeeding generation, the group from which the smallest 90 percent were harvested began to produce more and bigger fish than the other groups.The randomly harvested group did not change in size.""In the small-harvested group, the average survivor evolves to a bigger size and their reproductive output is twice that of the survivors in the large-harvested group,"" said Conover.The scientist said the experiment shows that a management plan that limits the catch to only the bigger fish -- a common practice for many sports species -- is actually harming the fishery in the long run.The reason, said Conover, is ""evolutionary dynamics"" -- the effect of genetic selection.He said that when only the big fish are harvested, it leaves behind the smallest to reproduce.Over time, this tends to make the survival genetics favor small size and the species actually get smaller in succeeding generations.However, when only the smaller fish are harvested, then the survivors are bigger and tend to produce offspring that are also bigger."
522856,Guest,2002-08-08 06:58:00,0,"HiIt is nice to hear you going on about putting the big ones back. Like the pike the walleye's females are larger than the mails so if you eat all the smaller fish and put all the big ones back there wont be any mails to breed with the females. I say put them all back. We in the UK arnt as luck as you guys in the US and Canada. We only have very small pockets of walleye or Zander as we call them over here. If a walleye is badley hooked and gose belly up, I wont waist it They taset to good, but the future of are fishing is more important than my belly.Have some luckJim UK"

522841,Walleye Wacker,2002-07-29 05:43:00,6,"eye eye captain, You are absoulty right...but those who feel it is better to throw back a ten lb female are also right. Some of us just simply believe that a large part of future fishing rests in the hands that have a ten pounder. One of the reasons that Walleye fishing may be at a all time high is the conservation efforts that are being made by both the authoritys and the fisherman."
522842,Guest,2002-07-31 16:51:00,0,"Just one more reason they should not issue licenses at least in Minnesota, Canada, and any other walleye area to Iowans. Like my dad says ""son don't worry about the bullheads, the Iowans will take them"". Let's not let history repeat itself of seeing stringers of 8lb fish and then generations after struggle to catch fish. Bass, muskie, and walleye fishing is at all time high because of catch and release. On the otherside, Pike, crappie, and sunnie fishing is hit and miss because every big fish caught is taken out of the system. not hard to figure out. The big fish resort I fish in Ontario the owner will not let you return if you clean a fish over the 26"" slot. Put them on your wall and not in your belly! I'll give you the five bucks for a burger if your struggling for something to eat!"

The regulations allow us both to take that fish. You stick it on your wall, I eat it and wash it down with a Crystal. Your a dick! Crawl back to your 2 bedroom trailer, have yourself a Mickeys Bigmouth, tell you dad how you set those Iowa boys straight and stare at that crusty old walleye on the wall. In 5 years you will be selling it at the trailer park garage sale for $5."

In fact some of the worlds finest people live in Iowa and its a great place to raise a family.

522829,Guest,2002-07-26 06:52:00,0,"i have a question to ask that is relative to this.If we continue to eat the small ones and always release the breeders, do we eventually risk the chance that there will at some time only be big fish and very small fish available?"
522831,Guest,2002-07-26 07:28:00,0,10 1lb fish or 1 10lb fish. What does it matter? It seems easier to clean 1 fish instead of 10. You also don't have to keep screwing around with the fish stringer which gives you more time to drink.

If one fish doesent matter how about if we all felt that way and the 1000 guys a year that catch a ten pounder on a lake did the same as you that would be over 800,000,000 eggs that would never have the chance to be Walleye....please grow up boys and show some respect for future generations...I agree that fishing should be a bunch of fun but it does have responsibilty....please CATCH & RELEASE"

Jumping off my soapbox and thanks for listening."
522825,Guest,2002-07-25 17:17:00,0,"Jigger1,Jiggin Jimmy, You boys are right on track. Im in hopes that the guys who ate the ""Big Ones"" had a better reason than just being hungry. The programs of catch and release that have been implemented the last 20 years or so are the primary reason that Walleye Fisherys are providing the fisherman with the bounty we enjoy today. I realize that there is a opportunity to keep at least one large eye a year or more and still be in compliance with fishing regulations in most jurisdictions. However my personal opinion is that if you want a trophy for the wall have a replica made. I have had several done and they look and last better than the real thing. If you are hungry eat the little ones and if you only catch a big one enjoy the memory over your bologna sandwich.Im a lot like you Jigger1...every time I throw back a trophy I think of the opportunity for my Grandchildren and their Grandchildren and each of your Grandchildren to someday enjoy the clear blue waters of Canada and the battle that ensues when a 10lb Walleye makes you stand up in the boat. I pray that they to will release for the future.Todays fisherman have the responsibility to manage the resource and protect the unborn fish and the unborn fisherman."
