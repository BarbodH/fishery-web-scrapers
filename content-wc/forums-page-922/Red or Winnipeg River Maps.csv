524348,fishcop,2002-09-18 17:13:00,11,"the best place to get a nautical chart is from map sales at the following address1007 Century StreetWinnipeg, Manitoba, R3H 0W4E mail; [email protected]Website; www.canadamapsales.com (site still under construction)or call toll free @ 1 877 627 7226You can get one on the entire South Basin of Lake Winnipeg, or one specifically of the Traverse Bay/ Winnipeg River to the Powerview Dam. As for the Red, I am not familar with this area, however as it is a main waterway connected to Lake Winnipeg, I am sure they have charts for it-Question; do you still want to fish it after the sewage spill???Good fishing!"
524350,Bobby,2002-09-18 17:23:00,211,"I just picked up a map of the Red River from CanadaMapSales. It was about $20, if I can recall. It doesn't show depth contours, but it was a decent map overall."
524349,Guest,2002-09-18 17:29:00,0,"Let me give you a very important tip if you order a map from Map Sales. Ask that it be shipped in a heavy duty cylinder and offer to pay the extra money for it. If you don't do this, they likely will ship it in a cylinder like you see Christmas wrapping paper on, and the cylinder likely will get damaged in the shipping process, and so will your map. It may not matter much if you're only going to use it on the boat. But, if you intend to have the map framed - and the quality of their maps is very high - then you'll want your map to arrive undented and uncreased. The good news is that if your map does arrive damaged, all you need to do is call and they'll ship you another one. They're very polite and understanding, but you'll wait another 2-4 weeks for your map. I understand this is more of a problem for maps shipped from Canada to the U.S."
524351,manitobawalleye,2002-09-18 18:14:00,885,it does not show contour linesbut it does show depths...just so there is no confusion on what is available....
524352,wallidiver,2002-09-18 19:12:00,50,Thanks to all that replied. And yes I'll probably still fish the Red for Terds..ooops meant Greenbacks!
524353,Bobby,2002-09-18 20:10:00,211,My strategy for the Red to hook into a trophy terd: I'm just going to tip the rear treble of my shadraps with either a corn niblet or a small piece of Charmin TP. That'll give me the edge this fall...
