Hoping to get into the walleyes, but a couple guys wanted to try to northern...(they just arent raised right) Is there any significant pike fishing within an hour of selkirk?thanks for the tips""Winners never quit, quitters never win, and those who never win and never quit are idiots"""
524252,gofish,2002-09-13 07:11:00,24,"While there are pike in the Red River system, you'd be hard pressed to put together a pattern for Pike here. There is some winter activity through the ice where the Red meets the lake. However, it's not Pike that the Red is famous for. If you're really serious anbout some Pike action this fall, you should head east to the Lac du Bonnet area (big lake) which is part of the Winnipeg River System. You can also launch your boat at the Town of Pinawa which gives you access to many miles of good Pike water above the Seven Sisters Dam. If you're willing to travel a bit further, go to Big Whiteshell Lake or the Winnipeg River by the town of Point du Bois. Get a good map of Manitoba, and you'll see the areas I'm talking about. Have a great time will visiting our province & good luck! Remember C&R those big 'uns!"
524253,Setter,2002-09-13 12:54:00,165,Hey husker where ya from? I've seen a few post that you had about fishing Spirit for perch.I've been up there about a dozen times this year also. What day are you going up to the Red? We will be up there Oct 5th-12th. We stay right in the camping area at Selkirk.Take it easy and let me know what's going on. Ryan Hale
524254,Walleye Wacker,2002-09-16 09:45:00,6,We caught a 48' Pike last year while Walleye fishing on the Red River. We also talked to several other fisherman who had caught 20 lb Pike while jigging for Walleye. The only pattern I could imagine would be trolling. This could result in Pike or Walleye. There are some shallow areas with Pike like cover as you approach the mouth of the River. There is also a large shallow flat that is more like a lake about 3 miles north of Netley Creek. Looks Pikey to me....
524258,Guest,2002-09-16 10:48:00,0,"Caught one pike, using a crankbait, just south of the sea plane base in the inlet/arm that runs south. Caught another on a pickeral rig last year while fishing from shore. I've heard stories that pike fishing was excellent on the river years and years back. I've also seen pike caught by shore anglers. They're there, the debate would seem to be if the river is prime pike territory. By the way the lakes north of Netley off the Red are very shallow."
524255,Cornhusker,2002-09-16 12:12:00,104,We will be at the red from Oct 6-13. We should try to look for each other.My email is [email protected]
524259,Walleye Wacker,2002-09-16 12:34:00,6,TRUE...The Lakes North of Netley are very shallow during normal water levels. If you go North of the lakes and check out the sloughs to the east they look Pikey. Locals have told me that there are Pike caught in that water but it has only been told to me ...never proved.
524260,timeout,2002-09-16 21:00:00,28,"I think that gofish gave a very comprehensive assessment. having said that, there are occasionly some large pike caught in the river. I believe that the pike follow the sauger up to lockport. I have caught a few smaller ones and last year the girlfriend had one at the surface before he let go of the sauger which was about 11""."
