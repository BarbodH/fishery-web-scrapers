I'll be heading up there 9/20 for 8 days of great fishing. Also how the weather this year. It seems that it keeps getting warmer and warmer about this time of year. This will be my third trip and hope there will many more to come."

Directly across from the dock at Burleigh Island Lodge ( BIL for short now, it's too long) you'll see a big island. Just to the left of that island is few markers sitting on a sunken island. Tossing bucktails and spinnerbaits around that area should net you a few good shots at a musky. There is a spot a few miles downstream that I think is called 'Hurricane Bend'...you'll know it by the 3 red chanel markers that are all close to one another. On either side of that channel and around to the church on the island is also good. The falls will probably be a trickle now but I will give you a spot in there just in case. First..( find this spot in the daylight first) you'll notice an island splits Burleigh Falls into two outlets. The right one ( looking up at the falls) is the primary flow. The left one, at night, holds good walleye. Go in the left opening and you can get quite close to the outflow there. Jig minnows or use a carolina rig with a minnow ( my favourite). If the low water level has slowed the left side, use a jig and minnow while drifting around the main outflow at night. If you want to anchor there, be a bit careful..there is a severe underwater shelf there that goes from 30 ft to 2 ft in a flash right near the island between the two outflows."
