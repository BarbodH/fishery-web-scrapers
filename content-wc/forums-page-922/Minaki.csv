524355,Guest,2002-09-18 09:06:00,0,My dad has been up there for a while. I guess the water has dropped drasticaly in the last month and is actually a little low. That's hard for me to imagine as when I was there in late June it was higher than I have seen it in the last 20 years. He said the fishing wasn't the best......wonder why?
