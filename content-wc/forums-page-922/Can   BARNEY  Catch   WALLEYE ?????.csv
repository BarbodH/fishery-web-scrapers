524158,Guest,2002-09-14 11:24:00,0,Oh sure Betty ...Barney can catch a lot of Wallirusus but he needs to start practicing catch and release. Let them Mommas lay their eggs Barney.
524159,Guest,2002-09-14 12:14:00,0,"OK,OK. I JUST THOUGHT I SHOULD CLEAR THE AIR ONCE AND FOR ALL. IT'S ALL TRUE. I AM A WALLEYE GOD AND I AM A FISH DETECTIVE. SOMETIMES I AM BIG & PURPLE. OCASSIONALLY I CAN BE SEEN AT THE BOWLING ALLEY. I DO LIKE OREOS, ESPECIALLY THE ONES WITH THE CHOCOLATE IN THE MIDDLE. I DO PRACTICE CATCH & RELEASE. I JUST FIGURED THERE WERE A LOT OF YOU OUT THERE WONDERING WHAT THE REAL STORY IS, SINCE THIS LITTLE JOKE SEEMS TO HAVE GOTTEN QUITE POPULAR HERE. WOMEN WANT ME AND FISH FEAR ME. LATER, BARNEY"
524160,Guest,2002-09-14 12:49:00,0,Thanks for clearing up all the rumors. It must be hard to a Walleye God and still have time to take care of all those Womens needs.
524161,Guest,2002-09-14 14:12:00,0,"YES, IT IS A ROUGH JOB, BUT SOMEONE HAS TO DO IT."
524162,Guest,2002-09-14 19:05:00,0,"Hope we have this much fun on the trip...see you soon,Mike"
524163,Guest,2002-09-18 17:08:00,0,"this guy is crazy. believe me, i've been fishing with him numerous times, and i've never seen him catch a fish... the only fish i saw caught was a 24 inch walleye by a 12 year old girl named samantha brunner, she is the best walleye catcher in all of illinois!!steve jordanstockton, Illinois"
524164,Guest,2002-09-18 18:42:00,0,"Steve, Thanks for helping set the record straight on Barney. I will get to see him in action soon and if he isnt good the whole world will know. Are you saying that Barney got beat by a girl????"
524148,Guest,2002-09-09 20:54:00,0,A feller named Barney that I talked to on the phone the other night told me he is the best Walleye fisherman in Illinois. Does anybody know this Barney Fella and is there any truth to him being the Walleye God of Illinois???
524149,BD,2002-09-09 21:04:00,739,Is he big and purple?
524150,Guest,2002-09-10 05:14:00,0,"It's not like Barney to brag. Fred? Yes. Barney, no. You can ear Fred brag all the time at the Royal Order of Water Buffalo meetings."
524151,Fred,2002-09-10 06:22:00,32,"Barney is the ""ILLINOIS WALLEYE GOD"". He also moonlights as a ""FISH DETECTIVE"". He is a legend on Illinois water and holds many state records."
524152,Guest,2002-09-10 13:35:00,0,"I have heard of this Barney. I heard he is a fish catching machine. But I never knew he was a ""FISH DETECTIVE"""
524153,Guest,2002-09-11 12:50:00,0,This Barney is wild and crazy guy HUH. Des he fish with two poles and a string tied to his toe still? Once I fished with him and he drank a whole case of Orange Pop and ate two packs of Oreos...Be careful he is a good one.
524154,Guest,2002-09-12 15:30:00,0,If Barney is going fishing he better not miss bowling night. Because if he does Wilma and I wont have him over for Brontasoras Burgers anymore.....yyyyaaaaaaahhhhh
524155,Guest,2002-09-12 21:27:00,0,Barney couldnt catch a cold....
524156,Guest,2002-09-13 19:05:00,0,barney is one of my favorite fellers. i have fished eith him and fred and they can fill a stringer up like nobody can.
524157,Guest,2002-09-14 05:15:00,0,"Wilma..huh..the nerve of you saying that about my Barney. Why, my Barney always brings home more wallisaurus meat than Fred and never, ever brags about it. The nerve of you saying that!"
