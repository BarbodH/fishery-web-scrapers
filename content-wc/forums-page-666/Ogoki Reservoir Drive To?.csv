563308,Wisconeye,2007-02-11 09:35:00,79,Where did you find information about a road into that area? I'd like to take a look. I for one sure hope there isn't road access now or in the future.
563309,Guest,2007-02-11 09:46:00,0,I had a friend who drove to where the bridge crosses the Ogoki River. He took a light weight boat and a small motor. He lowered the gear over the bridge and portaged his way to the Ogoki Reservoir . He said he would never do such a thing again . He was around 50 and in very good shape at the time . By the way it was his second trip before he made it to the reservoir as on the first trip his buddy was lowering the 15 hp motor over the bridge and dropped it . Ouch ! He wasn't even fishing the reservoir he was on his way to Whiteclay Lake.

Northwest Ontario is covered with forest acess roads the loggers use. We drove to Wollaston Lake in 1969 and I have been driving to these wilderness lakes with my camper and trailered boat ever since. All you need to do is take a ride on Google Earth Plus to your favorite lake to see if road acess exists
563311,Guest,2007-02-11 12:16:00,0,"Actually you are correct with the above statement. Logging is a industry in NW Ontario just like alot of other area's in Canada and so is tourism. There are logging roads and if people have done enough fly ins Im sure they have seen the roads by air. Alot of the ""north"" country yet has been logged though, meaning no logging roads yet. If flying far enough north, there are no roads and some cases it may be 20 plus years or more before a logging road will reach that far north. If you want to drive to a lake via logging roads. In alot of cases where a fly in tourism value is placed on the lake the road could be closed, access traps placed in, etc. where you will not be able to travel the road. Some lakes, do not have this restriction depending on the lake and area. So you can see the MNR and logging companies in Ontario work together to have both industry's work hand in hand bringing money to the Ontario economy."
