I had never been on either lake. I was there fairly early in the year...first or second week in June, if I recall. The owners were helpful in pointing out places to fish, plus I found some good spots on my own. I trolled weed edges with little joe spinners, jigged off points and along shorelines where the wind was blowing in, the usual stuff. I caught a lot of walleyes, though I had some slow periods. Many were small, but then within a few hundred yards of camp I trolled some weeds and caught a number in the 18"" - 22"" range. Very nice fish! Yes, the water is not the prettiest, but the walleyes are fat and happy. It is not a real tough lake to fish in terms of finding probable spots. I would recommend the lake(s) at least early in the season. Best of luck!"
