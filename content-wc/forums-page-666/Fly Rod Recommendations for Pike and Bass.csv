(Must be a mid-life crisis thing!) Anyway, I would like to get a set-up, if possible, that I could use for Bass as well, here in beautiful Cornfield County USA.(Better known as Indiana,where all the lakes are whipped into a lite, and fluffy froth by all the boats and fishermen)Now, since it is well known in advance that I will hurt myself or someone else in the boat severely, by whipping this thing around,it might be nice to find a package deal that offers a first aid kit as well! I would like some equipment advice as far as rod length, reel, etc. for Pike and Bass, and find out if I can fish multiple species adequately with one set-up? However, the little research I have done shows a rod /line weight of #8 or #9 for Pike and a #6 for Bass. Could I split the difference and go with a #7 weight set-up and a 9' rod for both species? I am sure I am over simplifying this, so that is why I am asking the experts here on the board. Thanks, Mike ""Indiana, where fishing is so unbelievable...Well, that's exactly why I go to Canada!"""

Might overpower the bass some when you fight them, but if your going to toss bigger bugs and rabbit strips it'll make the casting much easier than a 6 weight. If you split the difference maybe go a shade to the heavier then the other way. Just my opinion.A fly really is deadly on the pike."

563307,Ruddiger,2007-02-11 09:10:00,649,"I have been fishing for pike and bass on the fly for some time and went thru the exact thought process you are experiencing now. Since then I have purchased a number of rods of various lengths and weights and applied them for both bass and northerns. In the final analysis, and with all due respect to other opinions, I suggest the following: Bass: a 9 foot 8 weight is perfect. I really see no reason to go any smaller, particularly if you want to be able to cast all types of flies. Don't be fooled by the weight of the rod as it is plenty light and will make a 12 inch bass fun to catch. This rod will also work for northerns, although it is not ideal. Northerns: A 9 foot 10 weight is perfect. Like the 8 weight for bass, this rod can cast all the flies available for pike and do so far easier than the 8 weight can (although I have done it with the 8, it is just easier with the 10). Also, it too is light enough to make a 24-inch pike very fun. Compromise: If you don't want to pick between the two go with a 9 foot 9 weight. It will do everything the above-mentioned rods will do and will give you some versatility in a single outfit. With all due respect to other posts, anything less than the above-mentioned weights would be too light for many applications and would perform poorly in the long run (especially in casting the flies to your fish). In the past finding a good and inexpensive 9 or 10 weight was difficult to do but this is no longer the case. Many good combos and outfits are available from almost every retailer. Cabela's, fore example, offers a number of excellent introductory outfits that would be perfect for your applications. As does LL Bean. I hope this helps, and good luck! Ruddiger"
