Have received conflicting information on tackle allowed for northerns, walleyes, lake trout etc. Do the rules require barbless hooks only and no treble hooks ?? I think these are the rules in Manitoba Kind of like to know before I show up with incorrect (or illegal) gear. thanks in advance V."

They know we are bringing tourist dollars which helps their economy."
