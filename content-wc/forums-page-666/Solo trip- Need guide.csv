563384,IaDave,2007-02-14 11:32:00,476,Our yearly trip to Canada looks like it is off for this year due to various reason mainly some of the guys are as tight as bark on a tree.I was unable to go last year because of family dealings and I can't stand the thought of not going again this year. I'm thinking of going to Sioux Lookout and staying in a motel for a few days and hiring a local guide from town. Anyone have any contacts there?

Going to North Caribou Lake and then to Onaman River Resort on Lake Nipigon after the fly-in, both trips are open for you to go . When my former fishing buddys got to old to go I found new fishing friends on this site. As I said if interested give me an e-mail Larry S"

We have fishing that neck of the woods for about 10 years and chase a mean walleye, smally , pike and muskie. Feel free to join us and if not, I have a local guide up there that some of the folks we have had through our place have used and have had luck with. email me directly at [email protected] if you are interested. Good luck"
