I think the best thing that each of us can do is find a new person to take to Canada every year. We all know friends who love to fish and have never experienced the fishing bounty that Canada offers. It is a shame that anyone who loves to fish would go through life and never enjoy Canadas beauty and excellent fishing. Find someone that you know and share with them Canadian fishing and a weeks worth of awesome Canadian Sunsets. Your friendship with them will grow if you do this.
563359,Mike Kansas,2007-02-13 09:54:00,1463,Great Idea!!!! We are lucky enough to have someone new join us every year on at least one of our trips. It is always great to see them enjoy the trip and hear the excitment in their voice when they talk of their days on the water. Find someone and make their life a little better for at least that week in Canada.

We went to Canada a few times, and he struggled some, but slowly started to make progress. Two years ago we went with our wives. Now, our couples vacation is the highlite of our year, my friend and his wife have become addicted to walleye fishing, and they are getting quite competent. Last winter I showed them how to tie spinners. My buddy's wife tied up the most God-awful colors and I was kidding her that no self respecting walleye would ever..... Open mouth, insert foot. First morning she had two eyes over 8 lbs. Also, whereas in the past it was pretty much up to me to locate the fish and identify the best pattern, my buddy is now finding and catching fish on his own. It is very satisfying to see them having success and enjoying themselves. This year we're going for 2 weeks, I can't wait. The only problem is we all seem to gain weight. Oh well."
