563371,Grappler,2007-02-13 15:28:00,47,"Thanks, but the twin cites are out of the way for us on our trip. Somewhere around 80-100 miles. We looked at taking that route before, but decided to stick with Superior/Duluth. Thanks to everyone for their responses. You have all been a big help."

That is the route we are taking again this year. We just had wondered about crossing the bridge and getting off on the MN side to hook up with 2."
563329,Grappler,2007-02-12 10:12:00,47,"Hello, I am looking for directions to make a smoother path through Superior/Duluth than taking Hwy 2. We are traveling from Northern IL, and will coming into Superior on 53. We are heading to Baudette, MN for our border crossing. In the past we have turned on Hwy 2 and gone through town. Is there a better way to get there? If we continued across the bridge on 53 and then exited on (if there is an exit) 35 to get to hwy 2? Thank you! 108 days and counting...."
563330,VMS,2007-02-12 10:52:00,1103,"Definitely stay on 53 (along the south shore of the bay). Take the bridge across that hooks up directly with 35 south. Take 35 south up the hill a ways to where HWY 2 cuts off to the West. Your on your way then... Definitely better than taking 2 through town. a little faster traffic, less lights, and once you are to the bridge, no lights... Enjoy your trip. steve"
563332,Grappler,2007-02-12 11:10:00,47,"Steve, Thanks very much for your directions. Have a great year fishing!"
563334,Guest,2007-02-12 11:49:00,0,"Take Highway 2 to the left in Superior, this is at a stop sign or stoplight, with I believe a McDonalds off to the right. Follow Highway 2 thru Superior and over the Bong bridge. You then go south on 35/2 for about a mile, then exit on Highway 2 which will take you to highway 33, take that to where it rejoins 53. I've taken this route many times and I think I have described it correctly. Very quick way around Duluth."
563335,Guest,2007-02-12 12:06:00,0,"My previous post had an error, turn left in Superior at the Bong museum, not McDonalds, and take 2 thru Superior."
563336,Sutsgold,2007-02-12 13:41:00,219,Is this faster than just staying on 53 all the way through town?
563337,Grappler,2007-02-12 13:57:00,47,"Thank you for the info. We will use your shortcut if we are going all the way through to International Falls. I may not have been clear in my question, as we want to take Hwy 2, but wanted to avoid the stop and go traffic after we turn on 2. Thanks for the advice"
563351,Guest,2007-02-12 19:47:00,0,"Definitely stay on 53 all the way thru town and across the bridge. Then take I-35 south to exit 250 and US 2 goes west thru the town of Proctor and further west you enter the Indian reservation. You said you were going to Baudette so you will have to get off US2 at Deer River and take 46 north to Northome, take 1 west to Hwy 72 and go north to Baudette."
563354,Guest,2007-02-12 20:53:00,0,"I'm not so sure the ""shortcut"" described in the earlier posts to get thru Duluth is any shorter, now that the 53 construction thru Duluth is all but done. Granted, it was bad before and during the construction, but last year it was nearly completed and getting thru Duluth was a breeze, even with a couple of lights by the Mall. I have taken that route around a couple of times and it seemed to me to not be any faster, less congested, and more miles, but not faster. And with the by-pass around Eau Claire completed that alone cuts off a good 30 min."
563361,Guest,2007-02-13 10:10:00,0,Have you ever tried going through the Twin Cities through St.Cloud Brainerd to Bemidji? I have gone that way several times. I Usally stay in Brainerd and drive to Baudette easy by lunch time the next day. Maybe that is too far out of the way? But Duluth is aways up there and then go to the west.
