Very family oriented resort. We will be there June 2-9. From a fishing standpoint so much of it depends on the timing and your ability just like anywhere else. We stay within several miles from camp and catch fish every day, morning and evening. Sabaskong Bay where they are located is arguably the best area on LOTW for muskies. We have always taken are limitsof walleyes home and we don't even try to catch them. Brian/Kathy will do everything then can to make your stay enjoyable. If you have specific questions leave me your email and I will respond."

I have been coming back here for over 50 years. The quality of the fishing is a large part of that. I am more a muskie, norhtern and bass fisherman than walleye, but walleyes are always accessible. Nestor Falls is a great community with most service available locally. Sabaskong Bay Lodge also has great owners and places you in the middle of some of the best muskie fishing available. The same is true with Duck Bay Lodge. Good Luck!"
