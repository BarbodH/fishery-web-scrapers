562968,Guest,2007-01-24 17:52:00,0,"Eric and voyaguer, silsby is a shallow lake with an max depth of about 50 feet. It is a true monster pike lake. There's only lodge on it and only 1 owner since it opened around 1994. They have averaged about 80 people per year for the lat 10 years. The two outpost lakes (cuddle and High hill) are just as good and only see about 30 fisherman per year. Walleye fishing is good with an average size of 22 inches. they have a very well enfirced single barbless hook policy. No trebels."
562969,Guest,2007-01-24 19:10:00,0,"Hi V. Silsby is exlusive with no other camps. They are way north of any old logging roads. The only way in there is by airplane. Silsby Lake Lodge is on Silsby Lake but they have 2 other connecting lakes and each lake has an outpost camp for guys who want more privacy. The camps are owned by Kip as well. I don't remember the names of the other lakes but they are just as stuffed with fish as Silsby Lake. All their lakes are strictly catch and release. You can eat as many Walleyes as you want but the pike are only for fighting. You have to use barbless hooks to. That's not a problem because if you lose fish, who cares, you get another one in a few seconds. My friends and myself are saving up our money and going back in 2008. I can't wait because it's just an incredible place to be. gary"
562977,voyaguer,2007-01-25 11:16:00,54,Thanks Gary and Tylerd Your information is very helpful to get a better feel of what is there. I will contact them . It seems to have many of the feature I want. take care and good luck voyaguer
563221,Guest,2007-02-06 11:55:00,0,"Silsby is truely a gator factory and Kip manages it extremely well. He has imposed the ""single"" barbless rule and it works. I got 3 trophies using spinner baits and spoons in mid lake weedbeds. Bolton is also exceptional and either places will make for fantastic Manitoba gator fishing experiences."
563313,Guest,2007-02-11 14:10:00,0,"I have been doing some research and found a few other lodges with monster pike and their web sites have the pictures to prove it. Pine Island Resort - Saskatchewan - www.saskatchewan-fly-in-fishing.ca Beaver Lodge - Saskatchewan - www.beaverlodgeflyin.com Way North Lodge - Ontario - www.waynorthlodge.com As far as I can see, if you have your heart set on Manitoba, I think Silsby Lake Lodge is the place to go. gary"
563314,Guest,2007-02-11 14:11:00,0,I made a mistake. Pine Island Resort is www.saskatchewan-fly-in-fishing.net gary
563415,Guest,2007-02-16 07:52:00,0,"Thank's to all for you're input. Check out travelmanitoba.com Go to Master Angler Awards enter lake name , this gives you GOOD info on the size of pike caught."
563438,Guest,2007-02-17 14:01:00,0,"I Wire Em, I'm also doing some research for a possible ""Big Gator"" trip next year. The 2 that I'm strongly considering are... 1. Little Vermilion, Red Lake, ONT (Sportman's Lodge) 2. Nungesser Lake, Red Lake, ONT (Angler's Kingdom) Seems that these are the only 2 places I've found where you have a realistic chance at 40+ inch pike, without spending a TON of cash. If money were no object, or if I were just doing a ""once in a lifetime"" trip, I would look at the following places... In Saskatchewan 1. Wollaston 2. Reindeer 3. Athabasca In Manitoba 1. Knee 2. Molson Lake Lodge (or their Max Lake Outpost) 3. Nueltin 4. God's Lake Northwest Territories 1. Great Slave Lake But I think it all depends on how much you want to spend. Anybody else have any suggestions other than the 2 in Ontario, if you're trying to do it on a more reasonable budget?"
563447,Guest,2007-02-18 11:46:00,0,"Hi Kevin who owns Angler's Kingdom use to own Way North Lodge. Many of the pictures of big pike on his Angler's Kingdon web site are from Way North Lodge. That's something you should be aware of. He does have big pike and massive Walleyes but some of the pictures on his web site are not representing his fishery. Another thing you should consider is many of the lodges you have listed are very well known and historically had great fishing. Many of these lodges have Indian guides because there are Indian villages on the lake. Indians in Canada hate non-natives more than you can imagine and have been going out of their way to poison or net lakes clean just to keep non-natives away. Fishing has been whipped out on some of these lakes and the lodges are only surviving because of reputation and big budget marketing (TV shows & Mags). It's a really serious problem in some areas. After all the crap that has gone down in Calidonia, Ontario between the natives and the towns people, Indians in Canada are now even more motivated to keep people out of the north. If you go to a lodge's web site, make sure the pictures are new and investigate if they have a large Indian population that has access to the same fishing areas that the lodge has. I don't want to sound like a bigot but unfortunately that is what's going on in some areas. New pictures and lots of them is the key to finding good fishing on the internet. Gary"
562815,Guest,2007-01-16 15:02:00,0,"Looking for some input on the PIKE fishing at this lodge. Been fishing Lac Seul for years , plenty of Walleye. Ready to step up for some GOOD pike action. Any other feedback on other lodges for Pike ?? Thanks In Advance !"

562829,Guest,2007-01-16 19:49:00,0,Bolton is good and the service is very good however look into silsby lake lodge. It's in the same are of Manitoba but much better trophy pike fishing. Here is the web site: www.silsbylakelodge.com. Good luck what ever you do!!
562882,River_eye,2007-01-18 22:09:00,1486,"Silsby was for sale a few years ago, did it change owners? I think that the owners of Bolton looked into purchasing it, but didn't."
562918,Guest,2007-01-21 14:23:00,0,"Hi I've been to Silsby Lake Lodge. Kip and Mickey still own it. They do have the very best pike fishing in the world. Their Walleye fishing is the best to. You can easily catch 100 Walleyes in a day but with all those 25 pound pike hanging around, you will not want to spend all your time Walleye fishing. I was there 2 years ago and caught 11 pike over 20 pounds. My biggest was 48 inches and he was around 28 pounds. My friend Dean caught a 52.5 inch pike that was 31 pounds. You should check out Pike Heaven www.northernpikefishing.ca if you want to look at other pike fishing lodges. Northern Manitoba and Saskatchewan is where you want to go for the biggest pike. Gary"
562935,Guest,2007-01-22 19:41:00,0,River_eye Kip and Mickey would never sell Silsby. It's Kip's life and his pike are the most important thing to him.
562939,River_eye,2007-01-23 11:47:00,1486,"Well, it was a heck of a prank in 2004 when they said it was up for sale. Actually, a very funny story, a guy from Minnesota contacted me because he was thinking of buying it, but he needed a full time, year-roud employee to run it, so he contacted me through this board just because I was a Manitoban that sounded like he knew somthing about the fishing lodge business, it was pretty exciting for me at the time, being only 22. Then, when I went for an interview that spring at Bolton, I mentioned it, and they told me they had considered buying it, but the price wasn't right for them."
562941,Guest,2007-01-23 15:55:00,0,"Eric, There you go. Anything is for sale at the right price. If I wanted to buy your boat but you love your boat you may give me a price that if I was stupid enough to buy it for you would sell it. Thats what you had there. Trust me, I am in the know."
562959,River_eye,2007-01-24 11:01:00,1486,"So tell me more about Silsby, is it a very deep lake? What's the water clarity like?"
562960,voyaguer,2007-01-24 11:18:00,54,Hello Gary Are there multiple lodges\camps on Silsby and the related outposts ? Are the lakes accessible by the general public ? What type of pressure overall do these lakes get ? Sounds like a place I would be interested in as I begin to look north and west of NW Ontario. thanks in advance V.
