563258,NAV165,2007-02-08 10:37:00,412,Please share some insight on fishing in Canada around the opener (May 18-20)? Some in our group like to fish walleyes and some like Northerns. Is it too eary? With this cold weather I'm worried there will still be ice! We are looking at going to Crowduck Lake.

That week can be tricky and is almost never the same from year to year. Part of the fun is figuring out if the spawn has occured yet and where the fish are.....almost always they will be scattered unless it was a very early spring. We love being among the first on the lake for the season and will be going up at least once and perhaps twice more anyway. If it will be your only trip and you don't like the ""hunting"" aspect of fishing then waiting a week or two is probably safer. If you go then expect anything from some minor ice still on the lake to warm balmy temperatures and anything in between."

The earliest I've been in there was right around the Manitoba opener (usually a week before Ontario) and we did super good, catching over 200 walleyes that day between three people. Oddly enough, some unpredictable weather set in after that and the lake shut down for about three weeks until the water warmed."
