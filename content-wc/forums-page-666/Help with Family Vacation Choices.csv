563187,Fishing Traveler,2007-02-04 23:17:00,19,"This is my first post but I have spent a lot of time reading this board. It is a great board, and I hope to tap some of your expertise. I am planning a trip with my dad and two sons. My sons are 12 and 9. While they like to fish, they love to catch and still get pretty bored if the fishing isn't good. From my research, I have narrowed my options to the following four. 1) Fish Lake Seul's Evergreen Lodge. Lac Seul is 1500 miles from my home. They have a nice family package that fits into my budget and would allows me to spend some money to hire a guide for a couple of days. I'm a little nervous about the absence of panfish. If we hit the lake on an off week in the summer, it could make that 1500 miles each way even longer than it already is. I am also just an average boater who boats on fishing trips only. I am a little nervous about how some have described the boating hazards on big Lake Seul. 2) Fish Sportsman's Lodge on Little Vermilion. This place has the added adventure of a fly-in. It is on the edge of what I can afford but sounds as though that enough small walleye to keep my boys interested won't be too much of a problem and big pike are a very real possibility. 3. Fish a lake in Southeastern Ontario. Many of these lakes have a ton of panfish that can serve as backup to pike, bass and walleye and are much much closer to my home. Maybe I'm being selfish but they don't have the same sense of adventure or trophy potential as the other two options. 4. Any other suggestions the folks on this board can come up with. When we go on fishing trips, we fish. They aren't into whether a lodge has a nice playground or not. So, I am looking for a place that consistently provides consistnet fishing action for walleye, pike, or bass (and panfish). Sorry for the long post but I appreciate any help you may be able to offer. Thanks, Chris"

Lac Seul is supposed to be the best walleye fishery in the world according to some of the posts here, but I live 40 miles north of it and found it to be not worth my while to go south to try it. Red Lake and the Gullrock system has more than enough fish to keep me happy. The Red Lake fishery has , pike, walleye, lake trout, perch, and whitefish. Gullrock has mainly pike, walleye and perch, but the odd lake trout is taken in the early spring and summer. Both lakes have good navigation markings on them and very few spots that would cause you problems (unmarked reefs) Look on google for sunset country that could give you a listing of camps that might fit your budget."
563189,jerry bark,2007-02-05 07:29:00,822,"you might consider happy day lodge (www.happydaylodge.com) north of the sault. a good lake with lots of territory to explore, good walleye and smallmouth with some nice pike if you go look for them. they have a few portage lakes as well, one is a great pike lake. only lodge on a ten mile long lake with aobut 15 private cottages scattered around. tell them jerry bark sent you, might not help but won't hurt. cheers jerry"
563190,Guest,2007-02-05 07:57:00,0,"Chris mind if I ask where you live? 1500 sounds like alot wow... Might I make a suggestion? Take a look at Lake Nippissing... The West Arm in particular.. Nippissing is a massive body of water and the West Arm is connected to it... it offers alot of shelter and does not get nearly as rough as the main lake when the wind whips up.... There is fantastic Walleye fishing.. as well as the other usual suspects, Trophy muskie, Pike, perch, bluegills, crappie whitefish you name it Nippissing has it.. Just something to consider if you are somewhat interested I will provide you with Links to places I have stayed and throughly enjoyed myself. A Canuck."
563191,Guest,2007-02-05 08:48:00,0,"We go to LOTW which is an excellent lake. We stay at Canadianhaven.com in Nestor Falls. Great people and family resort. They can schedule day fly-ins to area lakes and the one for walleyes are caught nearly every cast. The fly in is around $130 p/p and includes flight,boat,gas,etc. and is a neat experience. As far as panfish you can catch perch anytime but they run a little on the small side,IMO. We also catch plenty of the other species(walleyes,northern,bass and we catch a few muskie without fishing for them). The water around C/H is pretty easy to navigate and we have never ran very far to catch fish. You can bring your own boat or they have nice rental units. They also have children about the age of your kids so they could play if you get rained in for a day."
563193,Fishing Traveler,2007-02-05 09:29:00,19,"I live in south central Pennsylvania. I am somewhat familiar with the lodes on Nipissing but have not fished it. I've heard mixed reports on the consistency of fishing on Nipissing. Where have you stayed? Thanks, Chris"
563206,Guest,2007-02-05 17:18:00,0,"I have stayed a few places around the West Arm... here are a few that come to mind and really stand out...www.lakair.com if you are looking for a great place that is known for catering to Americans (ie. breakfast supper etc) <--- Kevin and Leslie are top notch.. They are located just after the causeway so you have two choices fish the main lake (slot limit) or fish the West Arm (no slot limit as of yet) I have stayed in their cabins and camped... our fishing club meets there yearly and this place is nothing short of amazing. and here is the other... This is where I take my family www.welcomelodge.com/ it is very family oriented, the cottages are in good repair and John will put you on fish...Angela is also a super host! the staff working there are top notch as well... they dont have an american plan however so you are on your own for meals etc.. The thing I like about this place is your boat is right in front of you on your own dock... vs. a marina so you can keep an eye on your stuff should you need to come to shore for lunch etc...All the cabins are waterfront as well... My family and I have been coming to this place for years and have never been disappointed in terms of number or quantity of fish. Anyways take a look and do a bit of research on Nippissing... our fishing club has a few members from PA as well and every year they are on this lake... and can attest to Nippissing... if interested in perhaps talking to them and asking their opinions drop me your email address and I would gladly get you in touch with them.. no matter what you choose have a great time up here in Canada! A Canuck."
563218,Guest,2007-02-06 10:26:00,0,"I am a canadian who has fished all over southern and near north Ontario including Nipissing, French River, Rice lake, Balsam lake, Pigeon lake, Temagami, Gowganda, before trying Northwest Ontario. I have fished Rainey Lake and Lac Seul. I go to Lac seul in mid-July and early September and have never been disappointed.When your kid sees a 42"" pike try to eat the 19"" walleye on the end of his line he'll forget all about panfish! Give Lac Seul a shot you won't be disappointed.If you drive the boat prudently and pay attention to the markers and where everyone else is driving you'll be fine. I'll be at Gold Pines Camp in mid-july for 2 weeks, when are you going ?"
563230,LeeHawk,2007-02-06 20:56:00,12,"Blackjack is right on. I fished Lac Seul for the first time last summer and after one 30 minute run to the Bay of Islands with a guy who knew the area, I was fine. I run about 25 mph with my 50 hp Yamaha tiller on a G3 boat and I am cautious. I use my locator and common sense around points, islands, and narrows. The great thing about LS with kids is that you can drift into islands and points with a jig and minnow and catch lots of walleyes. Not real complicated! I will be up there the first week in July with some friends, but will also have my grandson with me (a 6th grader) later in the summer...can't wait! Good for you...take that family fishing. You will love Canada...some of the greatest people in the world!"
563235,Guest,2007-02-07 11:52:00,0,"I'll second the west arm, plenty of eyes but you do need to be fairly savy to consistently catch them, which is why this is our destination of choice each year."
563236,Guest,2007-02-07 12:18:00,0,"Lakair is a fine destination. Private docking is available depending on your cabin selection. Leslie's pork chops are fabulous. We'll be there the 1st two wks of July this year. Last year we caught a 7.5 and 8 lb eye as well as many many smaller fish around the same time. Seems like we regularly pick up at least one 8-10 lb eye/trip. Also hooked up but didn't land a 50"" class musky. The truth is there are many great Canadian lodges, find one that your family can develop into a tradition. My family has been going to Lakair since the 1950's, so for us there is no other place."
563293,millerltman0905,2007-02-10 06:26:00,2,"I have a lot of experience on Little V. You wont be sorry with the fishing. Your right, the walleye will average about 15-16"" but they will more than keep those young boys happy. Also the pike potential is unreal, numerous fish in the 32-39"" range, and a handful over 40"". Brett and Judy run a great camp, you and the boys would have a great time. And yes the short fly-in makes the trip for everyone. Let me know if you go, I'll mark a map for you. [email protected]"
563234,Guest,2007-02-07 10:42:00,0,"Hi Chris, If your looking at fishing up in Red Lake, I might have a few options for a group your size. Also I know of a few guides that would be willing to put you on some nice walleye and monster pike... You can give me a shout anytime: [email protected] ."
