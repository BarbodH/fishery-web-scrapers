563340,Northern Manitoban,2007-02-12 15:37:00,195,Gas prices have been dropping but i bet come spring and closer to summer they will go back up over $1.00 a litre maybe we will get lucky and it won't happen right now its around the 90 cent mark. Keep checking my website as I will be upating gas prices from around the Province as many of us are now thinking about our trips north. Dave

The food at the main lodge is fabulous. Island Lake is named appropriately because one would get lost in minutes if one didn't know the lake. Guides are so worth the pay....they do everything for you and get you back home safe."
