563253,Guest,2007-02-08 00:10:00,0,Anyone have any experience crossing the border into Canada at International Falls on July 4th? Busier than usual......er no? Thanks Lunk
563260,Guest,2007-02-08 12:11:00,0,I believe it's actually a bit slower that week as lots of us Yanks like to stay home to celebrate our Freedoms!!! DL
563268,FishTwentyFourSeven,2007-02-08 16:56:00,38,How far is it from I.F. to Baudette? Last year our wait was 3.5 hours to get back into the states. Does Baudette get backed up too?
563267,Guest,2007-02-08 18:14:00,0,I tried it a few years ago and the line was 2 or 3 miles long. Unbelieveable. I drove to Baudette and crossed with little to no wait.
563285,driftersifter,2007-02-09 11:35:00,109,Not like Int falls. It is about an hour drive and if you are headed to kenora you make up about half that coming back East to the North highway. Michael
563292,Guest,2007-02-09 20:42:00,0,Cross at Baudette and go to Morson to fish right in the middle of Lake of the Woods and only 45 minutes from Baudette.

If you cross at International Falls on the weekend, do it early morning or late at night. Baudette has little congestion at any time. Here is a link to check out border wait times.http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/general/times/menu-e.html"
563324,MoWalleyeguy,2007-02-12 08:36:00,409,All depends on what time you get to the border crossing. If you get there before 8am to go into Canada you wont wait long at all. If you get there after 8:45am then you wait will be much longer. After 10am and your wait can be VERY long. Its the same with the return trip... after about 9am and the wait can take 30 minutes and more! I have go to Canada 5 years in a row over the 4th of July.
