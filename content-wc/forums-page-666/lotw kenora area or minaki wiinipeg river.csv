But don't get me wrong fishing is still very good. With that being said we make a few trips to LOTW every summer for 1 reason. Lots of fish and lots of big fish. LOTW is such a big lake and with so many hot spots that never see a boat all summer. Mind ya I fish off of clearwater bay on the north west side. You won't be disapointed with either location."

Superb bass fishing, not too bad walleye, pike is good too. Muskie is great and trophies are around if you happen to get lucky. You do not have to travel any great distances to find fish as it literally can start within seconds of the docks. Ron[email protected]http://www.yourkenora.com"
