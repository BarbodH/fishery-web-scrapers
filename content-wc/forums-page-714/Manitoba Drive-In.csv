555206,Northern Manitoban,2006-03-06 02:45:00,195,"The best fishing you will find is up in the Snow Lake Flin Flon area in Northern Manitoba loads of top lakes for Lake Trout, Pike and Walleye I fish this area's all summer and there are allot of anglers here from your state. Lakes to consider are Reed Lake,Athapapuskow, Kissising, Tramping lake,Clearwater,Cormorant,Iskwasum,Simon House,Come June and early July these are the best times. The drive will be worth it. Hope this helps? NMhttp://www.xtremesportfishing.com/forum"
555209,manitobawalleye,2006-03-06 06:31:00,885,nm is right for multi species for walleyes with a shorter drive also would suggest lake of the prairies or cedar lake
555211,VMS,2006-03-06 09:47:00,1103,"If you go to kississing, be sure your rig is up to it. 40 miles one way of mediocre to low grade gravel road makes for havoc on trailers, tires, axles, you name it...let alone the dust. Many a trailer has lost an axle on that road...but it is well worth it once you are there. Steve"
