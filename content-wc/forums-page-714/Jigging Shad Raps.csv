What part of Ball Lake is the Lodge on? I didn't know there was a place to stay on that lake. Which rapids are you speaking of? Are those the rapids flowing out of Indian Lake? I'd like to chat a bit if you have time send me an email at [email protected]."

554498,hawk82,2006-02-09 14:20:00,126,Has anyone ever used them for anything other than ice fishing? Was wondering how they work for normal conditions. Anyone?
554508,hawk82,2006-02-09 17:09:00,126,Does anyone have any experience using these in open water?
554523,Guest,2006-02-10 10:27:00,0,"Yes, I used one on Lac Suel last year and it worked very well. It was perch patterned. I didn't use any bait on it but I've seen people put grubs and small bits of crawlers on the treble. I actually caught my biggest walleye of the trip on it! (26.5 in) The one I used last year was a gift but I bought a bigger one this year to use."

I thought one with a little bit of Gulp bits on it would work well in place of live bait."
554532,Guest,2006-02-10 16:16:00,0,Yes it was comparable. However the smaller model I was using had a little trouble keeping the bigger fish on the hook. That's why I bought the biggest one I could find this year! I am also going to try some of the Gulp! grubs on it.

554537,Guest,2006-02-10 19:13:00,0,"I bought a 3/4 oz Jiggin' Rap which is about 3 1/2 inches long. The one I used last year was the 1/8 oz size. Rapala has a good website that shows them. There are two kinds the Jiggin Rap which is longer and skinnier, and the Jiggin' Shad Rap which is shorter and fatter. check out this link to Rapalas website:http://www.rapala.com/products/lures...shorsalt=Fresh"
555265,Guest,2006-03-08 11:30:00,0,"Ever since I fished with ""chief"" who pit me on Rapala Jigging Rap, but I have since started using Nils Master Jiggin Shad in the glow series. And also started using the Salmo Chubby Darter, both have worked aweseome on Rainy River and Lake of the Woods, Rainy Lake, Wabigoon/Dinorwic for walleye. Tried them with Lake Trout also with good catches. Putting a minnow on the front treble hook sometimes increases your catch/sometimes the smelliest minnnow you can get is the best."

Harvey, Do you have any good depth maps of the English River below Maynard Falls? Any suggestions on where to fish early (opener). Not necessarily spots, but techniques? Thanks, Christian"
