I.E. location, depth, tactics and areas? I realize the weather factor will determine much of this, but I thought maybe someone out there has some experience in this location of LOW. Coming in from Denver, so you see wer'e travelling a distance... Thanks, Jim R."

The walleye fishing is great in these areas and pike are good to, no numbers but good size.Also bass and muskie in these areas as well a crappies close by.The house boat company will point you in the right direction also they have maps with spots that they prefer you use and they are always around good fishing areas.Good luck"

I see lots of walleyes on the graph and dangle a jig in front of them but they won't eat. Very frustrating. Tried live bait, cranks, spoons (vertically jigged), split shotting, etc. The same techniques in June/July/August put tons of fish in my boat! Would appreciate any advice you can provide. Thanks."

555357,Guest,2006-03-13 08:25:00,0,"Yes, I have fished LOW the same time in Sept. about 3 years ago... found some nice eyes ( 25-35 ft. deep) the first 3 days as well as some fair pike action... then the weather turned and temps dropped 30 degrees and everything turned off for a few days (even the northerns). As it goes, the temps got better the last day out and the fishing picked a a little. We had to head the houseboat back in and call it a week. JIMI"
