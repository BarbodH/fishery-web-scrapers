Plus as a member of the OFSC naturally it will be necessary to purchase a permit.http://str.kenora.com/ is their url. Although nothing is on it pertaining to this winter as yet."
551549,kenoraonca,2005-08-17 12:33:00,19,"I also heard today that one of the last resorts on LOTW to open during the winter is not opening this winter. Ash Rapids located on the Western Peninsula has decided not to open. It's a shame actually. People try to operate a business and with the cost of the permits (mainly) business's have to close. Of course there is other things too. Gas prices, Diesel for generators and next comes wages all contribute to reasons not to open. Not to forget the plowing of a winter road which local cabin owners took advantage of, big time. Now those cabin owners who want to winterize, upgrade their facilities will have to pop for the price to have a road plowed. Now there will be no stops for anyone looking for a place to relax, have a meal, and whatever. One thing for sure. Things like this happening will certainly not help generate Winter Tourism in this area. Meaning a loss of a few jobs, support for local stores for supplies etc. Every little bit helps."

THX The Sunset Trail Riders can be found at www.strkenora.com and have been in operation in 2004, 2005 and 2006 seasons. We did not aquire a website until the late fall of 2005. You can find all trail updates, etc. in a concise and daily (sometimes hourly) updated trail report right up until the last trail closes."
