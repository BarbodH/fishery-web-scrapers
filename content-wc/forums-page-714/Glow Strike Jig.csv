Does anyone have any experience with this product and if so what kind of results or recommendation do you have in regard to this product? It looks awesome and if nothing else it would be a special addition to my Tackle."

However, last July up at Findlay Lake ( Northern Ontario), I took some of the green and orange glow jigs and I had more success with them. When I would switch to a plain jig color, the action slowed yet my buddy, who did not switch, saw more action. Needless to say I would put on another glow jig- I'm a believer. :bowdown:"
