554698,bob888,2006-02-17 13:11:00,244,"FYI: I purchased the Navionics Hot Maps Premium North; date on the cartridge is Jan 2006. The cartridge includes lakes in the upper midwest and Lake of the Woods and Eagle Lake in Ontario. I purchased the cartridge because I fish LOW and lakes in MN and IA. I assumed that because the Navionics web site states ""the best detail"" for the premium map that the LOW map would match that on the Navionics Hot Map Gold North, Dec. 2004 cartridge that my fishing partner has. It does not. The ""premium"" for LOW does not show rocks awash or rocks just below the surface as his gold cartridge does. (His gold cartridge does not have near the midwest lakes the premium does.) Both of us have the Lowrance 332c and I verified the above today by doing comparisons in my unit with both cartridges. Oddly, Eagle lake on the Premium cartridge does show rocks awash on the map and a pop-up window says ""under water/awash rocks"". Strange, odd and I wonder why as my experience on LOW is that the designations for rocks awash and rocks just below the surface is very valuable. I talked to Navionics yesterday and was directed to post a message to cartography on their web site."
554745,PJM,2006-02-21 00:00:00,3516,bob8888 I have run the Navionics maps since the first map came out in like 2001 in my lowrance 1600 which I still have. I have an X-15 with the Hot Spots maps (which I got cheap) and they are not as accruate as the Navionics Premium maps that I run in my Lowrance 25C. What are you looking for and what part of the lake are you on?
554747,bob888,2006-02-21 06:27:00,244,"Thanks for the follow-up. I fish sabaskong, miles, basil channel, and the northeast area of little traverse. Must fess up, I fish 90% of the time for smallies, any walleye are accidental. What I'm looking for is a map for my 332c that will show the rocks awash on Woods as it does on my paper map. Navionics is open today and I'm going to talk to them again. It appears that I have two possibilites, the Navionics Gold Map # 2G182S and Western Great Lakes."
554752,PJM,2006-02-21 09:16:00,3516,"bob8888 The Maps that they use are off the NOAA maps are they seem t have most os the rocks maped. If the lake levels are normal and again you use your head you won't hit. The thing that I have found out is that there are deep holes in the lake that are not on the map so I mark them. Example of that is going down to the Obabikon, the channel going down there has a 20 foot hole we fish that is not on the map. But on the other hands there are rock they have missed also. If you go into the Obabikon you have to go though a 2 foot deep channel then it get deep like 13 feet then the rest of the channel going down is shallow. get you boat on plan and fly down the middle of the channel and go around that first island on the left side. If you go on the right side there is a rock and it is on the map but I have never found it. Also if you into the Obabikon stay tight to the left when you go in or you will get hung up."

555334,PJM,2006-03-11 00:35:00,3516,ShopCntrTony The Navionics Gold Map is better the Hot Spots are ok the the the gold is better.
555335,bob888,2006-03-11 05:39:00,244,"I have the Navionics Gold Lake of the Woods map designated NE/2G182S, Nov. 2004. It shows the cartographic markings of rock awash, dangerous underwater rocks that are on the Candadian Hydrographic Maps. The Navionics HotMaps Premium North dated Jan 2006 does not show those cartographic markings. I have that map and will not use it on Woods as 2G182S is superior. Otherwise the maps seem the same. As I also fish Iowa and Minnesota lakes it was not a total loss. Map 2G182S has been discontinued. Navionics informed me that the same map is on the Navionics Gold Great Lakes West Map. After numerous phone calls including to Reeds in Walker with no luck I managed to locate the cartridge by sending out mass e-mailing to Navionics dealers. Retail is $129 Note: Several days after purchasing the 2G182S map Reeds answered my e-mail saying they had the map. I did not confirm it though."
555350,Guest,2006-03-12 17:33:00,0,"Bob8888, Thanks for that post. I was about to purchase the same map package you did. You are right, LOW will show you the rocks by braille if you don't have a good map!!! I have seen plenty of folks find them. I don't intend to be one of them!!!"
