555280,Guest,2006-03-08 19:09:00,0,Does my 16 year old need his own license or can he still fish on mine. I know that if he can still fish on mine his fish and mine count toward limit. Thanks
555281,toby,2006-03-08 19:42:00,49,No license necessary till 18
555284,bigfish1965,2006-03-08 21:36:00,3210,He does not need a license and his catch does not count towards your limit. He has his own limit same as if he was licensed.
555290,Matches,2006-03-09 09:20:00,236,"bigfish1965, I believe that is only for residents of Canada. If he is from the US and wants to keep his own limit, that his son needs to purchase a license. http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/fishing/oc3a.html Hopefully a resort owner can clear this up."
555291,Guest,2006-03-09 09:23:00,0,Matches is correct. Only a resident under 18 can keep a limit if they don't purchase a license.
555294,bigfish1965,2006-03-09 10:21:00,3210,Yes...did not know he was not from Canada (although I shoulda figured that). The best solution is to get him a license anyway. Helps teach him about the responsibilities of fishing as well.I also think it was changed a few years back so that anyone from a Canadian province was eligible for a 'resident' license...
555297,Guest,2006-03-09 11:26:00,0,"Bigfish, that is also correct, anyone from Canada is considered a resident and can buy an Ontario resident license."
555298,Guest,2006-03-09 11:59:00,0,"Have we been wrong??? For years now we've been getting conservation licenses allowing 2 walleyes. Some take 2 fish home, some of us don't. We do however eat fish. The issue is the last 3 years, we've been bringing our boys along (all 15 and under). On our fish eating days, we thought the boys could each have 2 and adults each have 2. What I'm reading is that my son and I can only have in possesion 2 walleyes, thus only eating one each?? If this is true, I'll have to bark up cash for a license for him so he can eat because even though I would give him a kidney, ain't no way he's getting my walleye dinner."
555299,Guest,2006-03-09 12:08:00,0,"You are correct Freight Train. From what I gather, you have been keeping more than your limit. As for buying him a license, you can either buy him a conservation license or spend about $15 US and upgrade your license to an 8-day sport. Also, as you can see, they have changed the 7-day non-residnet license to 8-day."
