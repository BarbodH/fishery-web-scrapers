555343,jimmie,2006-03-12 15:43:00,123,"""I have crawlers in original bedding"" is what I say when asked. The irony is that I use Canadian crawlers grown in Canada, sold in Grand Rapids, MN Walmart and trucked back across into Canada. I carry a box of bedding just uin case with bait box. Cheap compared to up there. $3.75/doz in Fort Frances > $2.73/2doz at Wallyworld. Good for 4 weeks if kept cooooool!"
555344,jimmie,2006-03-12 15:50:00,123,"Not as wealthy as NWO fish bum buy gas in MN bait in MN and spend hundreds on some gas, motel, resort, meals, stops at Robbins and minnows, license, and lake landing fees; there!"
555345,jimmie,2006-03-12 16:03:00,123,"If you don't smoke or drink or need to bring back fish for your survival, there are no rstrictions. You pay your $10, show your Driver's license (that you are supposed to have) answer the ???'s and drive on to have a great time. Most restrictions that ,may come about will be invoked by us not them. I'm trying to gret the stupid idea of a passport recinded before next year. Write your congressman (MN) If a MN resident my contention is that your DL has all the peerinent info on it. I've been in the Canadian data base for 12 years. Afterall non residents are not sipposed to be issued MN driver's license. So that plus photo ID prettty much legitimizes who you are. If those from MN and other who utilize phot ID's wwill make enough noise you will be heard. Google your Cogressional folks snd email 'em. Only take about 10 minutes to save more than $100 for passport fees."
555356,jigman 2003,2006-03-13 07:56:00,981,"Yes, bait is cheaper at home than in Canada. However, since we go up there and catch Canadian fish it would make sense to me that we help support Canadians and Canadian business. I end up spending over $1000 on my trip, I don't think an extra $10 for bait is out of line."

Apparently, it was training day for a bunch of new employees. They took apart our boats, trucks, luggage, etc. Just routine training stuff. Fortunately for us, we did not have anything we weren't supposed to. If you get caught with items that are illegal and you lied to the border crossing agents, you will find yourself on your way back home with a big ticket. That is after you spend a few hours having your stuff examined and thorough questioning. It isn't worth it, buy your bait in Canada."

We had two truckloads of guys and the group before us didn't tell them they were with us. Well, we had one of their bottles of boozae and happened to get searched. Had to pay $20 duty on that bottle. More severe penalties for other things i'd imagine. I'm always the first vehicle to go through now and we be sure to have the boozae divided accordingly."
554996,Guest,2006-02-28 13:00:00,0,"like i said, ""we got lucky....anyway ...we loved fishing Canada but won't go back...due to way to many restrictions...mainly on fish...but also on food, beer and bait....we can fish in Minnesota, bring back more fish to eat for our family and not have the hassle of crossing the border.... don't get me wrong ...the fishing won't be as good and I do understand why they want you to buy things in Canada, and it makes sense for their economy...but will stay in Minnesota and support our economy, and actually save money. We may go back someday, because it is an awesome place to go...and most everyone we've met in Canada has been great."
555001,jigman 2003,2006-02-28 13:30:00,981,"If I were going fishing purely for meat and catching big fish, I would spend a few days on Erie. Just like you said, the fishing won't be as good in MN as in Canada (I'm sure it will be a lot better than in WI). If you are prepared to deal with that, that's fine. I like to support our friends to the north. I imagine you will return after a few years of saying ""this isn't as good as Canada."""

554812,Guest,2006-02-23 06:54:00,0,"2 or 3 years ago Ontario had a rule or proposed rule, that the worms must be out of soil and in worm bedding for two or three weeks before crossing from US to Canada. I recall some discussions on this board and suggestions that fisherman keep their receipt when they purchased the bait to determine when the worms were acquired. I don't know what the rules are for bringing nightcrawlers now. I suggest a search of the archives for futher information."

554815,jigman 2003,2006-02-23 08:13:00,981,"Yes, there is a time restriction on how long the worms have been around. Presumably so any soil in there digestive tracts has a chance to be expelled? Also, when you buy them in Canada make sure you keep your receipt. If you get checked by MNR and don't have one proving they were purchased in Canada, they'll confiscate the worms and issue you a ticket. I've found the best solution to this issue is to do a fly-in where no live bait is necessary to catch all the fish you'd ever want ;-)"

554818,Guest,2006-02-23 10:17:00,0,"The solution is simple . . . cross the border THEN buy your crawlers. Support the communities in which the places you visit are located. And not just bait, but groceries, drinks (and certainly beer), etc. And don't try the old ""we want to drive straight through thing"" as some excuse for not stopping for 20 minutes to get your supplies in Fort, or Kenora, or Dryden, or Ignace, or wherever it may be.

554793,Guest,2006-02-22 14:16:00,0,"We take crawlers across every year and they require the grey bedding, also that they be in the bedding for three weeks before taking them across the border. We have never kept them in bedding that long, the thing you need to worry about is any soil in the worms, the castings that are deposited when you first put them in bedding will mostly be soil so be sure that the bedding is grey when you cross in case your checked.
