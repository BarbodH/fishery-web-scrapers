555310,Trailerguy,2006-03-09 16:55:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Immediatly after the bridge over the ""falls"" at Perrault Falls,Ont., on the left there's a small park or picnic area. Follow the laneway straight in and curve to right, you'll see the ramp. Don't pull too far ahead, it's soft beyond the edge.:o The ramp is below the falls, in what's called the ""river"", you'll see three of the resorts, as you go north into the shallow lake, turn WNW until you find the narrows going into a larger part of the lake. Always stay pretty well centered in Wabby if traveling. There are some nasty rocks that can be 50-60 yds off the points as you go North. You really should pick up a map, they would have them at Dutches Store, just before the falls. Most walleye fisherman will be going up north, to the ""big"" part of the lake, sometimes the weed bed around the 2nd narrows can be good, or to the flats in the NW end often called Gawleys Bay. That's probably a 7-8 mile run, depending on where you end up. There are other spots closer, but they'ed be harder to find for a new person. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
