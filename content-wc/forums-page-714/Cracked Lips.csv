I read in newspaper to use a lip blam with a moisterizer, so I purchased some Banana Boat with Aloe Vera...but have my doubts. HELP."

He went into town to get me some hand cream for my cracked hands, and a bottle of Canadian whisky for himself. He saw a Hustler magazine on the shelf and grabbed that too. The lady behind the counter asked if he was going to have a party by himself! <{{}}><"

555264,Mohleye,2006-03-08 10:39:00,368,Try Blistex with Sun Screen.
555266,Fred_G,2006-03-08 11:35:00,908,I've been using Avon Moisture Therapy Lip Balm for years. It works great. And you can usually get them on sale for less than $1.00.
555268,Guest,2006-03-08 12:16:00,0,"Natural Ice Original lip protectant. It is hard to find but it is the best stuff. Go on Drugstore.com and buy it there. I ski, which is about as bad as it gets for your face and this is the best. My hands usually take the worst beating on a fishing trip and crack up bad. Gramma had an old remedy that my wife thinks is kinda ""Brokeback"", but it works. Cover your hands with vasaline or neosporin ointment, and then put socks on your hands and go to bed. The next morning, your hands are no longer cracked."
