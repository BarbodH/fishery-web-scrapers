The other walleyes are caught on a jig, or slip bobber. Not real hard. This year, now only 12 weeks away, I will going in June. Besides spinners and jigs, is there anything else I need to bring up?"

They almost act like Bass (sorry to use a swear word!) they smack a grub tail (gulp is my favorite, no live bait needed) like they have never eaten before. We've pulled walleyes from water that a large mouth would call home anywhere else I fish. Our better fish typically seem to come in the 15' range, but numbers and an occasional pig come from shallow water as well. Then again it is Lac Seul - you don't have to try very hard to catch a bunch of fish! I can't believe it's only 12 weeks away already! -John"
