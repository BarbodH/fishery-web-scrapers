548716,tjsker,2005-06-02 08:13:00,301,Can anyone provide a link to or give me info on what I need to have in my boat that I'm taking to Canada? I would think that Canada (Ontario) would have some regs different than the states.
548727,Guest,2005-06-02 10:08:00,0,what ever the rules are where you come from thats the ones you have to follow. generally everything required here is required up there. check the coast guard rules for stuff you have to have.

548736,bigfish1965,2005-06-02 11:19:00,3210,Ontario regulates that whatever the required equipment is in your jurisdiction is what you need here if you are staying for less than 45 days.
548737,Guest,2005-06-02 11:20:00,0,"Execpt for the big rule of no alcohol allowed in the boat. I have never actually heard of anyone getting a ticket for this, but it is the law."

I don't HAVE to have that but I got one anyway just to comply w/Ontario. BTW, I had some beer in the cooler and they didn't check that. They really didn't do any checking, just suggested it because they saw my throwable on the deck. They didn't eve ask for license (it was me and my wife). They just asked where we were staying and that was it. It was about noon and I was just going to tap one....whewwwww!!"

I have been stopped three times on White Lake in Eastern Ontario, near Ottawa. All three times it was the OPP. Each time they immediately asked if I had any alcohol on the boat. They also asked for proof of ownership, once I had borrowed a friend's boat and the OPP guy had a problem, had to show him my friend's cabin and give him my friend's telephone number. All three boats were equipped with Ontario-type safety equipment, which they asked to see. They never asked for my fishing license."
555160,Guest,2006-03-04 10:22:00,0,Actually the law says that it is legal to have alcohol in ANY boat as long as it is sealed or in a closed container.
555277,Guest,2006-03-08 17:51:00,0,"I too have been checked three times. All three they checked coolers for alcohol. Once they checked for fish in the livewell. Once they checked fishing licenses. Alcohol in the boat seems to be a BIG deal by what I have observed (as well as what our camp owner told us). This may be local emphasis, but be careful. Your camp owner should know the local officers."
