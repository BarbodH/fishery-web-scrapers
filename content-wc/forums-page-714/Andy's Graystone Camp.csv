We were going to book a 5 day trip from June 10th to 15th before we go on a fly-in to Windsor Lake with Northern Outposts,unfortunatly there were no openings available. We are going to Cozy Camp about 20miles north of Ignace on the English River for our short trip before the fly-in Larry S"

555242,Guest,2006-03-07 13:13:00,0,"Have a good friend that has stayed there a number of times. Fishing on the Lodge Lake is pretty good and accomodations are excellent. If you're up for a little more adventure, they offer a bush trip that is excellant. They'll cart you back through the timber and put you in 14 foot boat with 5 hp motor on a very remote lake. I understand the lodge owner prospects area lakes in the winter by snowmobile and sets them up. These lakes are usually serpentine and not suitable for fly-ins. He makes a trail through the bush and none of these lakes are within 5 miles of any paved/gravel roads. These lakes only see a handful of fisherman each year so the fishing is top notch. If it was my trip, I'd find a way to do the bush trip at least once, Aye! Regards,"
