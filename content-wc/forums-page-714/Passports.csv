Since he is not my biological child I'm not quite sure what to bring with me other than a birth certificate and a permission letter from his mother for a smooth border crossing. Also what is the status of passports, are they needed here yet? Any helpful and accurate info appreciated. Thanks in advance folks!"

He was 9 years old. yes of course, had plenty of trouble at the border. we politely answered the questions and told them about the paperwork. they asked to see it and then told me to pull over so they could question the boy. i agreed, but asked that they not take him out of my sight. we went into the building and they took him about 30 feet away and questioned him. afterwards, they told us to go on our way. as soon as we drove away from the border, step-son started crying. he said that they tried to convince him that my brother and i had kidnapped him. oh well, i hope you have better luck. best wishes"
