534607,Jig A Lowe,2003-08-25 05:17:00,87,"I just started to notice some trim drift on my 3 yr. old, 2001 Johnson 115 HP. When the motor sits for several hours, the trim drifts down and will eventually drift all the way down after about 24 hrs. I know this isn't normal but I don't know what the cause may be. I also don't know if it is really that much to be concerned with as is certainly is easy enought to trim back up. The fluid level is OK! My dealer tighten some screw that he thought may have been loose but the motor is stil doing it. He said that the next step would need to be a total disassembly (and probably very expensive). Any ideas? Bulldog"
534632,Guest,2003-08-26 00:02:00,0,It seems if the fluid level is OK then it must be leaking down back into the tank. It could be the valve in the hydraulic system that is leaking by. If you can identify that valve by trimming down and have someone feel the valves to see which one is operating then you might know which one take a closer look at. probably a little dirt holding the valve open. If it has been a while maybe its time to change out the fluid. Dont take your dealers word for it being a big job. he does not want you cutting in on his profit. A little detective work could save you a needlesly expensive job. Alan
534755,Jig A Lowe,2003-09-02 05:57:00,87,Thanks Alan. The boat is at the dealer's now. The service manager suspects a speck of dirt as well. My experience with the dealership has always been good and I have a good relationship with those guys. I am mechanically inept so I need to rely on trained people more than others. Thanks again for the input.
