534782,Guest,2003-09-03 07:48:00,0,We have been picking up a few Walleye every day on the Red. Salted minnows have been the best with a few fish coming on chartreuse twister tails and minnow in combo. Catching enough to eat good with biggest in 5to6lb weight.
534540,Backwater Eddy,2003-08-21 08:33:00,3871,"Yup, the wind has a big effect on levels on the last 30 river miles of the lower Red River of the North. Most folks can't understand it tell the see it's effects once. Levels may drop or rise 5' in a single night if the winds are right. You don't want to beach your boat on shore at night and have the winds switch from the North to the South. Seen many boats left high and dry because of it. It's kinda funny to see, that's unless it's your boat left high and dry on the bank, then it fast becomes far less humorous. Ah....Yup! ;) Ed ""Backwater Eddy"" Carlson ""Piggy's are my business, and business is good"" ><,sUMo,>"
534583,Guest,2003-08-23 09:38:00,0,Lots of food in the Winnipeg River too. There's been a huge run of shiners in the last few weeks. We haven't seen this here in 3-4 years.
534584,Guest,2003-08-23 10:45:00,0,The wind on the lake will do that .... you can really see that here on the Winnipeg River. A hard south wind will case the river to drop sometimes a metre or more and a hard north wind the opposite. These winds push the water around on the big lake (from the north to south basis and vis versa) and you see a near immediate reponse on both the Red and Winnipeg Rivers. Once the wind drops or changes direction the water on the big lake redistributes and so its effect in the rivers.
534664,Guest,2003-08-27 14:33:00,0,"No one can accurately predict how the fall run will unfold. From what I've been observing over the past several weeks is there's a huge population of emerald shiners. I don't think that it's necessary for me to explain what this translates into providing their presence remains well into the fall. Over the past two seasons both the Red and the Winnipeg Rivers fished poorly. The reasons for this could have been many, no doubt aboriginal netting activities could have played a roll in the lack of walleye. But then again, natives have been netting these rivers for many years and under most conditions their efforts never seemed to have much of an impact on angling success. Don't get me wrong, I'd be the last man standing who'd support this type of activity in this day and age! During the past couple of seasons the emerald shiner were all but non-existant in either river. Without emeralds there's no reason for the walleye to migrate in off the lake........ I will say that at this time the Red River is literally infested with emerald shiners. I'm talking baitfish from bank to bank! So it's my prediction that if the emerald population remains strong into the fall, we should see a serious run of big 'eyes! By the way, I've been a ""full-time"" professional guide and resort operator on the Red for almost twenty years now. One thing that I'll ""never"" do is give false or misleading information regarding fishing conditions. I call a spade a spade and tell it how it is. Anyone that personally knows me, knows that this is where I'm coming from! So those of you will be making the trek to the Red or Winnipeg this fall, keep your fingers crossed. Who knows, maybe we'll see a repeat of 1999......WOW! Fish ""Hard"" Forever!"
534666,Guest,2003-08-27 14:49:00,0,"Stu, Thanks for the encouraging information about the Fall Walleye on the Red. Have been fishing the Red the last three years and while we have had a great time the fishing has just been so so. We have managed some 10lb + fish every year and are in hopes that this year the fishing Gods treat us with some better action. Love the Red. Thanks Again, Mike"
534675,Guest,2003-08-28 07:24:00,0,"Hey Mike, Believe me when I say that ""I too"" love the Red. When's she's fishing, she can take your breath away. Of coarse the same applies to the 'Peg as well. I'll keep everyone who's interested accurately informed on the progress of the fall migration. It's my gut feeling that the action this fall is going to be hot! If the weather continues to cooperate and these cooling trends continue, I feel the Red will be producing well by mid September. Over the years I've seen the action pick-up as early as the first week of September...... Keep your fingers crossed and stay stuned! Fish ""Hard"" Forever! Hey ""Bud-Man"", if you feel like getting away from Erie for a few days let me know!"
534682,Guest,2003-08-28 11:16:00,0,"thanks for all of the info Stu. I enjoy reading it. I ussually fish the Winnipeg River, but would like to try the Red. Give me some info on where to put in and any spots that i should try. what baits are hot, we ussually troll plugs on the Winnipeg or anchor and jig. thanks again Stu/"
534700,Guest,2003-08-29 07:29:00,0,"Pulling cranks on the Red during the early part of the season can be very productive. Average depth to concentrate is 10 to 14'. Seldom do we troll with the current and when you're working a particular area work it throughly. Jig fishing.....do I drift or anchor, I prefer the latter. I've found the those who are willing to tough it out and don't waste a lot of time and fuel running up and down the river, usually consistantly catch the fish! On days when the actions slow, this grinding style of fishing can take it's toll, but when you stick a ""pig"" it all becomes worth it! We've sat for hours knocking the paint off a jig with only a few sauger or small 'eyes to show for it and then just when you thinking to relocate somewhere else, wham, there she is! Like I said, it's a tough game to play, but when the going gets tough the tough................ What we're all hoping for this fall is that the Red and the 'Peg get back some of their old form and really produce some serious numbers of ""BIG"" fish. We're hoping that the past two year drought is over and once again the cream rises to the top! It's easy to become spoiled on these types of World Class venues and it's also hard for some us more seasoned anglers to simply write them off because of a couple of bad years. Fish ""Hard"" Forever!"
534703,River_eye,2003-08-29 09:27:00,1486,"This is true and it is called a seiche. It is a product of the warmer layer of water (epilimnion) to shift on top of the cold water layer (hypolimnion) the warm water layer will build up wherever the wind is blowing and in some cases you may have cold water coming up to the surface at the end that the wind is blowing from. This has interesting biological implications if the cold water is poor in oxygen content. When the wind stops, the warm water will bounce back like a pendulum and actually take a few sloshes back and forth to come to a rest once again, where the barrier between the two layers (metalimnion or thermocline) finally becomes horizontal again."

534501,Guest,2003-08-20 10:22:00,0,Heading to the Red River at Selkirk in October in hopes of catching some nice Walleye. Do any of you experts have any early predictions on how the Walleye fishing on the Red will be this Fall.
534504,red_river_fisher,2003-08-20 11:27:00,24,According to experts up here the fall run should be good. Some nice walleye have already been caught in that area. They are starting to come in from the lake. I will be heading out in the next few weeks and will let you know how it went. Born to Fish But Forced To Work
534517,Guest,2003-08-20 14:35:00,0,Thanks for the update. Would love to hear how you do in the future. In fact if you live in the area you are more than welcome to stop by and join us for a Steak and beer when we get there.

534520,Guest,2003-08-20 14:51:00,0,"It will be the same so called experts and business owners as last year telling us their great expectations for this year. It is in some peoples interests to tell us of such great predictions ya know. With all the factors involved such as weather, water levels, and whatever else that comes into play who actually has a crystal ball to tell us how it'll be this fall. I remember last years glorious predictions from a few folks here. I'll be fishing regardless of so and so's grand predictions and I'll take the good days and the bad days."
534521,Guest,2003-08-20 15:09:00,0,"Well spoken Different Day....Guess the reports really dont matter we will be back this year fighting off the Bullheads and the small Sauger in hopes of catching some keepers and a couple of ""catch and release girls""....thats why we call it fishing ...."
534523,Guest,2003-08-20 15:31:00,0,"Well with your attitude I see in my crystal ball a 15#+ Greenback in your not to distant future! Good luck on the Red, they'll be in there come fall, thick or not."
534534,Backwater Eddy,2003-08-21 05:02:00,3871,"There is lots & lots of food already in the Red river, that is real good. But little water is on the flow from the South (the Red) or the East (The Winnipeg River), that is not so good. That may change, who knows? Will they come? Ya if there is food, they always do, that is if they can. How many will show, nobody can say yet. There are far too many variables that may influence if and when they may show. I would work under the premise that fall 2003 is more of a ""If they show, I will go"" type of year, then a ""If I go, they will show"" type of year. What I do know is if you don't go, you will never know...either way. ;) Ed ""Backwater Eddy"" Carlson ""Piggy's are my business, and business is good"" ><,sUMo,>"
534537,Guest,2003-08-21 06:59:00,0,Sounds like we need some North wind to move the water from the lake back into the Red. I have been told that the North wind will do this. Does this make sense to anyone else?
534538,red_river_fisher,2003-08-21 07:20:00,24,"Yes this is true we just had a South wind for a coouple of days and some boat launches were closed because water went to low, they reopened a day later when it shifted. Born to Fish But Forced To Work"
