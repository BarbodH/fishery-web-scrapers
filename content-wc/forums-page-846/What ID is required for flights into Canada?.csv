Has something changed?? The fine folks at United are insisting that only ORIGINAL birth certs. will be accepted, NOT notarized copies. Is United pulling my chain or has this gone into effect across the board in the last 12 months? Thanking all in advance, WillieB"

You can still take your chances, I'd say with a photo ID and notorized copy customes will let you in. If I were you I would just get a passport and save yourself future hassles, the passport is valid for 10 years before it needs renewed."
