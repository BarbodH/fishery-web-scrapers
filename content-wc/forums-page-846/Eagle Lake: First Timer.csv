534793,fishmaster,2003-09-03 15:03:00,209,Where you are going will play a big part on how to for fishing this lake. I have learned that fishing from one end to the other is differant just on walleye alone.
534795,zugbug,2003-09-03 15:28:00,67,"Sorry, we will be fishing and Staying near Vermillion Bay. Out of Eagle lake Lodge, I will be travelling with an experienced Eagle Lake Muskie Angler but will be meeting them up there and want to be as prepared as possible. I have access to all the tackle I need Just want to bring the recommeded things from guys who have been there done that. zugbug"
534826,fishmaster,2003-09-04 17:46:00,209,"Have not done any musky fishing on this end but have been going to Vermilion Bay Lodge the last few years and have started to learn the lake for walleye and other species in the spring time. Your lodge owner should be able to help you out the best for your fall fishing but working Rock reefs and weed beds should work if the pattern is anything like the south end in the summer or fall. Make sure you work the islands and weeds off these islands and rock points. Drop offs on bars is another place to try. Remember this is just a recomendation on my prevous adventures while fall musky fishing. I have had luck on surface baits in Sept., but your deep runners will or might work best I know lot of big musky fisherman say the bigger the better in the fall so take it what it is worth on that saying, my opinion is work what you like to throw and work it hard. Good Luck!!!!!!"
