534789,red_river_fisher,2003-09-03 13:08:00,24,Breezy is also called The End of Main you go north from Winnipeg through Lockport and Selkirk and you just follow the Highway till it turns into a gravel road and keep going till you run out of road. You are now at Netley creek and the river is just to your right. Hope this helps. Born to Fish But Forced To Work
