Not exactley September, but it was cold and wet enough to be :-) Water levels are better than they were earlier this summer, but not yet back to normal. Fish will be harder to find, if our experience proves anything. Our guide stayed in 10' to 15' but we didn't do well at all. Maybe they've gone deeper already? Good Luck!!"
