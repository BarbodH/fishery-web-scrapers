Moose Creek is located on Eva and Young Lakes. Young was a good producer of pike and big walleye. The best lake in the area was Lake of Bays. Check with Moose Creek about access. Lake of Bays was just about as fast a fishery as anyone could want for both action and size. Panasi was a close second. Press is a good lake, but the average size fish is 15 inches. You also have to travel many miles on a gravel road to access Press. Out of Ignace is Agimic Camp on Indian Lake. From there you can access Indian, Barrel, Heathwalt, Arethusa, and Flat Rock. You will be rewarded if you don't mind a little driving each day. TGG"
