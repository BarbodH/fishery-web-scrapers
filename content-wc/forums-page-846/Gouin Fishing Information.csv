Many outfitters around the Gouin but the last I've went was the Oasis du Gouin and I was very satisfied with the quality of foods & hospitality. Don't be concern with the quality of fishing on the Gouin this is one of the best body of water in Canada for walleyes & pikes but specialy for walleyes. Minnows are allowed but only dead minnows that come from the Gouin itself, worms & leeches are also allowed; one thing I should say; on my last trip one day we were fishing grubs and other kind of rubber with no meat and they were producing fish after fish. From Ottawa to Mont Saint-Michel it's about 2.30hrs then from Mont Saint-Michel to Parent, gravel road (105mi.) 2.30hrs. and from Parent to the landing around 50 mi.1.30hr. 95% of the gravel road is a road very well maintain and the beauty of that you never know what your going to see on the next corner; could be a bear, a moose or a deer. Talking for myself I'd rather drive that kind of millage for going to the Gouin then driving the same amount of miles to any other destination. If you need more infos I will be glad to help."

We had good success with leeches at Berthelot Lake this June and will get a good supply in Manawaki before going to the Gouin. I have questions about Parent. Are there any Gas stations, vehicle repair garages and resturants available if one needs them? Looking forward to hearing your comments."
534705,Seanik,2003-08-29 09:43:00,218,"I forgot to mention and thank a gentleman from Ottawa who e-mailed much unbiased information on the Gouin, Thank you Peter! Posters on this board sure make it easier to plan a great fishing trip. Also mis-spelled restaurant on last post,sorry."
534710,nemio,2003-08-29 15:44:00,96,"Seanick, there is 2 garages that sale gas and can do repairs; 2-3 restaurants to eat, motels etc... I know few outfitters on the Gouin but don't have a lot of experience with them because I got my own fishing camp, but this year the area where I'm located was particuliary hit by the low water situation. I,ve got offers on my camp on a regular basis but I'm absolutely not interested; I let you decide why. As for the road I'm driving a 4Runner and habitualy it is 6 times per summer and I never broke anything on my truck or even got a flat so the road must be fair. I like this area so much this why it's a good idea to find infos somewhere else."
