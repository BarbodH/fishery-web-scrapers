534711,JawedUp,2003-08-29 16:04:00,60,There is a group of us going to MarMac next week. Does anyone have any info on fishing or other important info regarding this place. We have never been there before but have heard some pretty decent things about the place..Thanks a bunch
534723,ggg,2003-08-31 11:31:00,115,"I returned yesterday from Mar Mac. Fished with a group of 30 guys. Largest walleye was 26.5"", largest northern was 42"" with some larger ones lost due to small nets. All of the big northerns came on big musky baits. ( Crane baits, grandmas, etc. ) Big northern came from stumpy bay and Mosambuiqe Bay. Walleye fishing gets better the further north you go. ( East side of Refuge Island, west side of Steve Island,and the north side of Gull Island. Crawlers and minnows performed equal unless all they had was very small minnows. Drifting or very slow trolling with bottom bouncers and a plain hook on a 6' mono leader kicked butt over jigs. These walleyes are fished very hard on this lake with the slot protecting the overall fishery. The more subtle the presentaion, the more productive you will be. Cabins, lodge, staff and cook get a A from me as we were well taken care of. If you plan on fishing big northerns, take along a lip gripper."

534748,JawedUp,2003-09-01 18:26:00,60,"ggg. thanks for the info, incase you did not get my email; did you guys take a trolling motor? were the fish shallow or deep and what were the water temps? Thanks again."
534749,ggg,2003-09-01 19:10:00,115,"We did not take a trolling motor as you would also have to take a battery. We just backtrolled with the 20 hp. or drifted. Walleyes were mostly 18' to 25' on the slow dropoffs. We did find some in as shallow as 12' on a windy day on the windy side of Steve Island. Also the lodge owner will give you a lake map and if you ask him he will mark the hotspots. If all else fails, 1 block south of Shore Lunch Beach, there is sandy bottom and always a ton of eaters ready to catch in 12' to 18' of water. Enjoy tour trip. ( If I told you anymore Id have to come along and catch them for you! ) HAVE FUN!"
