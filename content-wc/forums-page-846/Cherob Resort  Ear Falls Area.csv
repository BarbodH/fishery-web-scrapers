534717,Guest,2003-08-30 19:48:00,0,Has anyone stayed at this resort? Their website says it is located between Goose Bay and Whitewing just south of Ear Falls. I have been up in that area twice but I don't remember driving by it. Any comments good or bad would be helpful. Thanks.
534720,Guest,2003-08-31 06:36:00,0,"I was in that area just recently and heard about that place. From what I have learned is that it is kind of a ""bootleg camp"" Not really licenced with the local gov't and marginally legal. Not the kind of place I would like to go. I know it has some of the legal, established camps in the area a bit upset."
534721,Guest,2003-08-31 08:36:00,0,"fisheye, When you say ""bootleg"" camp are you talking about someone who puts up a couple of cabins and starts renting them out without going through the proper channels? Does anyone know how big this camp is? Are we talking about one cabin or ten? Could a person get in trouble for staying there? I see people in the U.S. advertising to rent out their private cabins all the time for a week or more. Some of them even have websites. Maybe Canada has some regulations against this. Any thoughts from fisheye or anyone else? Thanks"
534727,Guest,2003-08-31 16:08:00,0,"River Man, I think there is only one cabin there so far but a couple more are being built. I'm not sure but I don't think You can get in trouble for staying there. There are laws in Canada about these things but on private land there are ways of surcumvemting{spelling} the laws and being not quite legal and not quite illegal. I guess my point is there are plenty of ligit resorts out there that have to pay the taxes and licenses and so on that could really use the business.Not just some guy with a full time job that is trying to make some quick cash. The decision is yours. Lac Seul is a big lake with lots of resorts. What ever you decide enjoy the fishing. The lakes around there are great."
534729,Guest,2003-08-31 18:08:00,0,"The only reason I was looking was the place I have stayed at in the past could not get my party in for the time frame I was looking at. Also, many of the other resorts in that area will take ""week only"" reservations in June and this one lists a daily cabin rate on their website. Can you recommend a camp that will book for four nights, six guys bringing their own boats? Thanks for your help."
534733,Guest,2003-09-01 06:16:00,0,"I have stayed at Evergreen Lodge before. Great place, and I am pretty sure they have a 4 day pakage. Depending on the time of year you want to go it may be a bit difficult to get the less than weekly rate. I would start checking around right away as many camps fill up pretty quick. Good luck and good fish'n."
534743,Guest,2003-09-01 12:01:00,0,Check out Golden Eagle Resort - 1-866-384-0117 - Just a mile from Ear Falls and on Lac Seul. Usually pretty accomodating. Nice clean camp.
534810,Guest,2003-09-03 23:53:00,0,Hi riverman. I noticed you said you have seen adds for people willing to rent out their private homes for a week. Where did you find that and how might I contact them? thanks for the help that is sort of what I have been looking for. thanks alan
534836,Guest,2003-09-05 11:06:00,0,Look in the classified section of Outdoor News or regular big city newspapers. Some people rent them out for a week or month at a time to help them pay for the place. I even saw one that included a small boat and motor for the week. These were all in Minnesota.
