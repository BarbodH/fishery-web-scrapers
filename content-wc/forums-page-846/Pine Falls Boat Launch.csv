The docks are all back in place and rock has been placed at the end of the launch to eliminate the sharp break. Equipment is scheduled to remove barricades today. Thank our local Wildlife federation for making these repairs.

My friend Grant Cyr told me about the repairs your organization has been making, and believe me, we really appreciate that! I can only imagine the economic damage for the community that would have caused if the ramp was shut down permanently.:-)"

Nobody that I have talked to has seen shiners so thick. The bait guys are happy, the pelicins are happy, hopefully the greenbacks are on there tail and well all be happy. Still trying to get on the lake..Its been blowing for days first chance I'm gone."
