The camp is in fair conditiona, considering it it 140 miles north of Red Lake and the staff was unbeliveably couretous. Connie and Bob make you feel at home and make that all the details are taken care of. Clint the camp manager provides you all the details of the fishing spots. Both Matt (dock hand) and Tom (camp pilot) take care of all the other details including handling the portages and fly out lake. The walleye fishing was remarkable. We primarily fished Favorable Lake and the Fly out Setting Net Lake. On Favourable the action wasnt lightning fast but each boat averaged 40-60 walleye per day, with more fish taken by the experienced anglers who worked hard. On Setting Net each boat averaged 100-125 walleye per day. One boat caught and released over 200 in one day!! The size was not huge, 16-22"", but the action was relentless. The only downer for the trip was the weather as it pertains to Trophy Northern Pike. It was 90+ degress for all 5 days. We caught some larger pike in some of the traditional August spots, but most had retreated to the safety of deeper water. We were able to land 2 fish over 40"", but thats it for the trophies. Don't get me wrong, we caught Pike, many 30+"" and as many hammmer handles your arms could reel in. But when you have dreams of at least 1 40"" per day, you get a little dissapointed. At least the walleye fishing was great!!! All in all it was a great trip for the die hard fisherman. Way North is a place for serious fisherman, it is not suited for the ""recreational"" fisherman. Bring your gear, and your will to catch fish, and it will happen!!!!!"

For walleyes the color combination that we fould to be the most successful was a 3/8 th ounce White Jig with 4"" white twister tails. Specifically the Walleye Assasins had an advantage over the traditional twister tails. For PIKE, Johnson silver minnows (gold and silver in 1 1/8 ounce) and double white twister tail trailer. The only lure that consistently caught PIKE. I would not go to WNL without making sure I went to Setting Net. Take at least 1 day ther and you will have NO regrets!!!!"
