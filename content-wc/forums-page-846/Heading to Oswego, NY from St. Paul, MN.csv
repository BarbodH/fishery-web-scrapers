534735,Stillwater,2003-09-01 07:47:00,87,"3 of us are leaving St. Paul this Sat. morning (Sept. 6th) for a trip to Oswego, NY. Yahoo travel guide says to go from STP to Chicago and then north through Lansing, Michigan and cross into Canada and then cross back into NY between Lake Erie and Ontario (Niagara Falls?). Yahoo travel guide says this is 1112 miles and should take 17 hours. In my experience, Yahoo is always a bit crazy in their time estimates. I went from STP to Cook, MN (Lake Vermilion) 3 weeks ago and Yahoo's time estimate was 4 1/2 hours and we made it in 3 hours. I'm thinking we can do this in 16 hours. Has anyone out there done this trip recently? We will be staying with a friend in Oswego and I would like to give him an (accurate) Estimated Time of Arrival. I'm thinking if we left STP at 05:00 we could be in Oswego at 21:00 (9 PM.) Any help would Scott"

534812,Guest,2003-09-04 05:11:00,0,I'll second the I90 opinion. With potential holdups for 2 border crossings you're better off. You'll pay tolls in the U.S. but it'll be faster.
