534687,McQ,2003-08-28 13:22:00,615,What do you have an interest in? They have a huge operation.
534765,Guest,2003-09-02 13:09:00,0,"McQ, Thanks for replying. Our group usually does a fly in trip. We typically fish walleye and pike but have never fished in Quebec.Any information you could provide about this outfitter and any others( Fly-in) in Quebec would be greatly appreciated. We are in Philadelphia so a 12-13 hr drive is about our limit. Thanks!"

It's an interesting place to fish - good cabins and a resident care taker. They also have trout lakes that produce well too. Here's the assn website which will help you locate others.http://www.fpq.com/fpq/owa/fper.cons...ATR10&p_lang=2 Melancon's listing is in the Mauricie Region. If you have other questions just post and I'm sure we'll be able to help."

Excellent camps, great service, good boats and motors, fantastic lake. We did Lake Naticum both trips, a 7 mile long walleye lake. Lots and lots of 14""-16"" eyes....but come to think of it, that was 4 years ago now, they should have grown some....No, I'm not affiliated in any way with Melancon, I'm just a walleye fisherman from northern NY. We did catch some larger walleye, but not many. There's also northerns in the lake, caught some in the 3' range, but lost a few that woulda been huge. My group had a ball while we were there. The camps were spotless, good frying pans for the fish frys, and not that it matters, but even all the plates and coffee cups matched....just an indication of how these folks keep the places up. We've been to other places, and one of the nice things about Melancon was that there were no ""hidden"" costs....all the gas you'd need was provided up front, for instance. One trip we were over the weight limit by 6 cases of beer, and they flew them in later in the day, no charge, as they were on their way by to another lake. Bring your own boat seats, your backs will appreciate the support!"
