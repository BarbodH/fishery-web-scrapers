564722,zzlaw,2007-04-24 20:35:00,34,"Look there is a lot of misinformation on this thread - I wouldn't drive 30 minutes to Last Mountain to fish walleye - however I do drive 30 minutes to Last Mountain to fish carp - the carp fishing is amazing early season - but anyone who implies that the walleye fishing is great or easy in 2007 is blowing smoke - Diefenbaker is similar - having said this it is not as if there aren't walleye to be caught in these lakes or the Qu'Appelle chain or Buffalo Pound or Rafferty Dam or Nickle Lake - but I just wouldn't bother travelling to fish reservoirs for walleye when you have your own - you have far better walleye fishing for size and numbers in Fort Peck, Oahe, and Sakakawea not to mention Devil's Lake - if you want the Canadian experience head further north into the Canadian Shield and fish the natural lakes - and I know of what I speak - I actually do live 30 minutes from Last Mountain and Buffalo Pound and just slightly more to the Qu'Appelle chain and Rafferty Dam - and i have a question for you - do you ever fish paddlefish or sturgeon in the Yellowstone? - zzlaw"
564725,waltstalker,2007-04-25 03:46:00,46,"I am sorry about your luck zzlaw but both last mountain and deif are first class walleye fisheries and if you aren't catching them it is no reason to slam them . Last year we had 60 -80 fish days at the north end of long later in the year we caught some good numbers with awesome size (36 walleye in an afternoon with 29 being oversize) an eleven two tens and a wack of six through nines . Rowans tourney had over 50 lbs for first place on a two day tourney, thats as good as the vanity . I also got some huge fish on deif early in the year we had an afternoon with a 10.5 a 10 a 9 a 8.8 a 8 and 2 7s the 8.8 was 35 inches long (love those river fish long with big heads).Take a quick look at the 10 lb club on here for sask and look at the #s coming from last mountain and tell me again that it is not a first class walleye fishery ."
564727,Dave Q,2007-04-25 09:18:00,1003,Waltstalker you should have email :)
564760,zzlaw,2007-04-26 16:37:00,34,"waltstalker - that you have a level of talent and committment and can catch walleye in Last Mountain and Diefenbaker during very narrow specific times, fishing very specific locations using very specific patterns is of very little assistance to someone coming all the way from Williston with no knowledge of the lakes - and obviously you need to brag but you've found the wrong guy slick - your ""accomplishments"" mean little to someone who has caught scores of trophy fish of innumerable species - and you should know that the comments I made I made in spite of the fact that I can and have taken huge walleye from both of the lakes you mention - but if you ever want a challenge lets walk a steelhead river sometime - or jump tarpon in Florida - ah didn't think so - but if you just want to talk walleye you should know my family lived on the BAY OF QUINTE - heard of it? For your information a fishery is only a great fishery if it maintains its fishing throughtout the year and gives up fish not only to accomplished fisherman but to ALL fisherman regardless of talent level - Last Mountain and Diefnbaker are largely seasonal and the average fisherman let's facr it catches little - to pretend that Lake Diefenbaker and Last Mountain are like Lac Seul is ridiculous - oh and say hello to Dave - if he is the bumbling Dave I've known previously who only fishes a radius of 50 miles from his house it is no wonder you are friends - zzlaw"

564164,uzzi,2007-03-29 09:15:00,349,"A few of the better walleye lakes in the souther part of the province include Last Mountain Lake, Sask Landing (which is at the SW end of Lake Diefenbaker), and theres lots of other spots along Lake Diefenbaker as well, like around Elbow SK. And there's the Qu'appelle river system including Katepwa Lake and Echo Lake. Another option would be Regina Beach too. Just throwing a few out there, you can google any of them for more info, I'm not from down that way and have never fished any of them, but I know these are all lakes that the Sask Walleye Trail uses for tournies, so there must be fish! Good luck."
564173,T Mac,2007-03-29 12:40:00,10084,"Dieffenbaker.....the east end in May. Last Mountain... the northern part of it, in May. Not a bad drive from Williston at all."
564182,Mike M (Sask),2007-03-29 16:08:00,374,"Last Mountain can be a good lake for Walleye and Pike. It's only 1 hour away for me and we spend a fair amount of time on it starting in mid to late July until freeze up. A good camp ground is Rowans Ravine in the north end of the lake. Here is a link to their site. http://www.se.gov.sk.ca/saskparks/ParkInfo/parks/park.asp?park=Rowan's%20Ravine Also right at Rowans is a marina and they also have guides. Here is a link to their site.http://www.gsmarina.com/ I'm in no way associated with either one of these, I just spend a fair amount of time fishing there. We do get a number of walleye over 10 lbs there from that time of year till freeze up. I remember the editor for Western Walleye Magazine goes there every year in August I believe. He has done a number of articles on it. Here is a link to one of his articles.http://www.westernwalleye.com/pastis...t-oct2003.html Another place is Tobin Lake. There is a couple of places to camp there as well. I know TMac goes there every year so you could get some input from him this. Hope that helps you out. Mike M (Sask)"
564184,Guest,2007-03-29 18:30:00,0,"In my opinion the extra time to drive up North is well worth it.It is a whole different experience. You will catch smaller Walleye than the South but you will catch more. My choices would be Jan, Deschambault or anywhere on the Churchill River system."
564187,Guest,2007-03-30 03:16:00,0,tmac hit the nail on the head with his picks I live between the two lakes here in sask. and his directions are good . Don't be afraid to go shallow 2-12 feet of water . Caught my personal best on dief. at the end of may last year 11 lbs 9 onces in 7 feet of water right under boat on a turn. if you want some more insight email me @ [email protected]
564191,T Mac,2007-03-30 10:19:00,10084,Mike... I'll agree. Rob and his lovely wife run a good operation at Rowan's Ravine on Last Mountain. LOL...Rob is way fun ...too!
564246,Cameron Muir,2007-04-02 16:53:00,11,"An hour and a half drive will get you excellent walleye/bass/pike fishing at the Boundary Dam and Rafferty Dam reservoirs near Estevan. This won't get you the ""northern experience"", but for that you have to be willing to drive north of Tobin (the Nipawin area is essentially where the farmland ends and the purely bush/lake country starts. There are a couple of decent municipal-type campgounds at Estevan, if that's what you intend. Or make a day trip of it. But someday, spend the money and go north."
