564932,scar,2007-05-04 05:40:00,196,how would you get to bear narrows or chamberlin from deception bay or hudson? would you have to go through sen bay? scar
564938,Guest,2007-05-04 08:45:00,0,"Even though it's a shorter route, I wouldn't go that way. It's scary enough at normal levels. You should go past the rags to devils elbow & up that way. More boats on that route to help in case you hit anything."
564941,Guest,2007-05-04 10:38:00,0,You can get up-to-date water level info from the Lake of the Woods Water Control board. They have graphs that are updated almost daily because they have remote monitoring stations set up on Lac Seul. The website is:http://www.lwcb.ca/ Click on Basin Data on the left side of the page and find Lac Seul. All the data you'd ever want. Regards
