564841,Guest,2007-04-29 22:01:00,0,So we have fished Gull Rock late May and early June for a number of years and it has been great to confused???(last year with early ice out). So what is the consensus of opinion on which time is better? This year we are scheduled for late August into September. Tell me? Bigger fish? Less bugs? Deeper spots? What up?
