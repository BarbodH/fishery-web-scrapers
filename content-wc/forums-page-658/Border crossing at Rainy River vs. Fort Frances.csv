564792,Guest,2007-04-28 06:53:00,0,Tonyo We also try to time it to cross in IF at about 5PM..our waits are usually 35-40 mins..but since we spend the night in FF its really no big deal to us
564807,Guest,2007-04-28 22:11:00,0,"rpieske Have you ever tried the route over to Motley, up to Ackley and on north. Allows you to bypass Brainard and 371. Just wondered how it compares, this has been my route for the past 5 years or so."
564837,rpieske,2007-04-29 20:30:00,1276,"I have never tried the route up 64 from 10. It would appear to be a little further and on roads not as good. The plus would be less traffic (unless you're behind a farm truck/trailer or combine). From the locals in Walker, they have always said the route I mentioned as being faster. But I don't know that for sure. Why don't you try it this year and see. Or maybe you already have and that's why you go 64. I usually go up through Eau Claire, Wisconsin to Duluth and then to I. Falls. That has always proven the easiest and fastest route for me from St. Louis. I go up to Rockford on I-57. Once in a while I'll go up to Walker, MN to have my trolling motor fixed by Maxxum Rigging and visit Reed's. Occasionally I'll go from Nestor Falls to Walker for the same reason. It's about 200 miles. I have a Genesis motor and not many work on them anymore. In fact I have two of them just to keep one running all the time. Both working right now and that's a scary thought. Good Luck!"
564844,TECK,2007-04-30 08:03:00,151,That is the way I go all the time. Roads not as got but very little traffic
564737,jigman 2003,2007-04-26 06:52:00,981,"I think I posted this awhile ago, but couldn't find it on a search. We are heading to Ear Falls this year. We've been going to Armstrong, and the border crossing at Pigeon River is easy. I know what the crossing at the Fort Frances can look like from previous trips to Red Lake and Mine Centre. Has anyone ever gone to the Rainy River crossing instead of Fort Frances (while enroute to Vermillion Bay, Red Lake, Perrault Falls, Ear Falls,etc.)? I'm wondering if the extra travel time is worth it? I know it will all depend on the length of time you sit in line at Fort Frances. We're going in the middle of June, so I would imagine that is a rather busy time at FF. Anybody got thoughts on this?"
564740,Guest,2007-04-26 07:26:00,0,Where is the Rainy River crossing?
564741,jigman 2003,2007-04-26 07:52:00,981,"Near Baudette, I believe"
564742,Mohleye,2007-04-26 07:53:00,368,"It's at Baudette, MN, west of Ft Frances. We have always crossed at Ft Frances, but are going to try the Rainy River crossing this year, at least on the way home. Partly to avoid the lines in FF, partly just for something different."
564744,Guest,2007-04-26 09:33:00,0,Hi. we would always cross at FF going up and if the line coming back to the US snaked more than a block we would just drive down to baudette. At baudette there was never any line going either way. its just an hour out of the way there and then another hour back to some connecting road on the us side of the river. the first time we did that was back when someone got caught smuggling beany babies accross and the line back to the US went all the ways to the city limit of FF wow. that must have been a mile or 2.
564745,Larry S,2007-04-26 09:34:00,666,"Jigman, What time do you think you will be crossing at Ft Francis? I went across at Ft Francis many times,if you cross early you shouldn't have any long waiting times. If you get there in the morning at 7am or later,especially on a saturday ,then be prepared for a long wait. Larry S"
564746,rpieske,2007-04-26 09:42:00,1276,"I have been crossing the border at Fort Frances and Rainy River for over 50 years. Here's the deal....it depends on where you are coming from as to whether it is worth the time. It is more than an hour's drive from I. Falls to Baudette and then back. If you are coming from Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska and points West re-route yourself to come up through St. Cloud and head straight North. The key to crossing at FF is to cross at off times; i.e. early morning, late evening or on weekdays. There is very little traffic at those times. Saturday and Sunday can result in several hour wait times. You can breeze right through in Rainy River. Usually almost no traffic backup. If you decide to go through Baudette,take I-94 to St. Cloud, exit 167. Go North on SR15 to West on US10 to North on SR371 to West on US2. North on US71 to North on SR72 right into Baudette. There may appear to be shorter routes, but they are not as fast. The easier way may be to just cross at I. Falls at off peak times."
564747,jigman 2003,2007-04-26 10:05:00,981,"Thanks for all the replies. On the way up we will be crossing on Friday at mid-day. Coming home it will be Saturday (don't know when, depends on when they fly us out). I'm thinking Friday shouldn't be a problem, but am considering going to RR on Saturday. rpieske-thanks for the directions. That type of info. is valuable."
564780,Grappler,2007-04-27 14:04:00,47,"Good Luck at Friday midday!!! Yikes...Have done that several times in the last few years and have ended up waiting hour and a half to 2 hours to cross. Earlier in the day would be better, like closer to noon. Good Luck."
564790,Tonyo,2007-04-27 22:03:00,212,"We drive in from Missouri headed to Gullrock and have crossed, I. Falls, at several different times but for the past 3 years have timed it out to cross around 5 pm or so and we haven't had to wait too long. It doesn't seem so long since we know we are a lot closer than where we started from. It's a samll price to pay for a terrific week of fishing."
