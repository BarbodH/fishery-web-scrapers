Can anyone point me in the right direction or give me a heads up as to what I can expect? I have had great water the past 4 years, but I have a feeling that the area did not get as much precipitation as in years past. Thanks for any help."

The area did not get much for snow so you can take it from there. The area needs rain badly, I was seeing rocks sticking up in Sep that I had never seen before in the last 20 years. Plan accordingly, good luck GF"

The only year I did not do well, it was low water. Any advice on how to fish low water? I guess most of my hot spots will be too low this year. Is it as easy as moving farther out towards the deeper water?"
