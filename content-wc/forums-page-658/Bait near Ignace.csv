564926,joeman79,2007-05-03 17:43:00,417,What was crawler price last year a Cabelas? (Canada Ready)
564934,Guest,2007-05-04 07:35:00,0,"Yes, we have good luck with crawlers. If ice just went out in 2 weeks before openner then minnows are best but crawlers work fine. We try and take both. Minnows in camp are 4 bucks a dozen so we might be taking some bulk shiners (preserved) instead of buying those live ones in camp. Where do you do most walleye fishing on Sturgeon?"
564940,Catman59,2007-05-04 10:20:00,345,PM or email me
564879,Guest,2007-05-01 15:08:00,0,Does anyone know of a good place (good price) to get flats of crawlers around Ignace for the openning weekend of May 19th? Or minnows less than 3.50 a dozen? Thanks
564880,515,2007-05-01 17:09:00,254,I would think that Verns Baits would be your best bet. I'm not sure if they sell flats though but you could call them and find out.
564881,Guest,2007-05-01 18:59:00,0,Vern's......807-934-2254......
564887,guidedfishing,2007-05-01 20:20:00,531,Vern's does sell flats if you are going to really buy some large quantities you should give him a call ahead of time. We have even had him pick up Potato's and onions for us before we arrive so we get everything at once. You will pay top $$$ for the bait but it will be in very good condition. There is no where you will get minnows for $3.50...that I am aware of. If you find'em let the rest of us know. good luck GF
564889,Guest,2007-05-01 20:53:00,0,"Are you by chance heading farther north or staying in the Ignace area? We have always purchased from Vern's and besides the price the bait is great. If you are heading further north though there is a place just north of Savant Lake that has minnows. Troy and Penneys is the name of the place and the guy flys traps in and out and distributes. His minnows are excellent and he has been very generous in his counting. Give him a shot if your in that area, his operation and tank set-up is pretty sweet as well."
564902,Lovetofish,2007-05-02 15:33:00,458,I thought I read somewhere that the bait shop/dealer on 599 was for sale?
564904,Guest,2007-05-02 17:35:00,0,We are going to Whiskey Jacks on Sturgeon Lake. So Savant lake area is about 15 miles north of where we stay. May try that. What do you expect to pay per flat of crawlers in Canada?
564908,Catman59,2007-05-03 04:46:00,345,If you are coming up 35 past Cabelas---------- they have flats of Canada ready Crawlers. Have you ever fished Sturgeon before ?
564909,Guest,2007-05-03 07:41:00,0,Yes we have been going there for a number of years. What are Canada ready crawlers? Are they just packed in buss bedding?
564921,Catman59,2007-05-03 15:40:00,345,Yep........ They are in approved bedding !!!! Do you have good luck with crawlers on Sturgeon ??? I really never have.
