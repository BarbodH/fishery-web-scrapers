564965,waleht,2007-05-05 18:29:00,132,Is this the place?http://www.onawaylodge.com/index.html Depending on the details I maybe interested. However I need a few days to check on something. Brent
564968,Guest,2007-05-05 22:05:00,0,"Yes, thats the right place. The cabin has 2 bedrooms but will sleep up to 6 people. It is one of the newest cabins and is around $580 per person depending on if you bring your own boat or how many you fish out of 1 boat. I believe you get 30 gallons of gas for the week and 20 dozen minnows. Kathy & Blair are great hosts and in my opinion have the best docks and fish house around. You can call me for the details 641-585-5184 or if you contact the resort just tell them Rod from Forest City referred you. Let me know soon as I have 1 other person who has contacted me about that week. I am so looking forward to the return to Onaway. It won't be long now. Rod"
