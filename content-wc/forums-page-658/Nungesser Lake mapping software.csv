564882,nip,2007-05-01 19:29:00,12,I was wondering if anyone knew of any mapping software that had Nungesser Lake on it. I will be going there in June. I just bought an Eagle 642c and wanted to load a map of this lake. I have never owned a mapping/GPS/fish finder. I looked on Hot Spots map and did not see the lake listed there. Is my best best a TOPO map of Canada?

Gary Worrell of Red Lake Digital has made nice depth maps of may of the area lakes. Gary's maps are most likely available from Northern Sporting also. I've called them and they sent the maps to me before the trip. You can also get your bait and license from them. 807-727-2302 Good luck and have a good trip. Pooch in central Illinois"
