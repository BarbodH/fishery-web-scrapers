564884,Guest,2007-05-01 20:08:00,0,Thanks for the report! Anyone going to be up there for walleye opener this year? First time up near the morson area at this time of the year. Anyone have any advice? Thanks!
564890,dkl,2007-05-01 23:11:00,113,Most of the ice was off of Big Traverse by Warroad today. Some of the ice that was left had blown to the NE. Any ice that is left should be gone by the weekend.
564901,Guest,2007-05-02 15:11:00,0,sledman i'll be up there at the same time. email me you have my address
564955,Guest,2007-05-05 01:41:00,0,"Lake is ice free as of yesterday am, nice to run around again in a boat, but boy is the water low, pray for rain we need it."
564845,rpieske,2007-04-30 10:38:00,1276,"It appears that Lake of the Woods is ice free, at least around Nestor Falls and Kenora. Crow Lake should be clear in a few days. It's warm and windy."
564847,Guest,2007-04-30 11:53:00,0,"question: is this early, late, or typical for ice-out on LOTW?"
564853,Ia Walihntr,2007-04-30 17:26:00,320,"ICE OUT: 2004--April 23rd, 2005---April 14th, 2006---April 14th around Oak Island and Falcon Island. Marv"
564857,dewyg,2007-04-30 18:49:00,1006,Manitou still has ice as of 5 minutes ago when I looked from my buddies dock.
564858,rpieske,2007-04-30 19:12:00,1276,">question: is this early, late, or typical for ice-out on >LOTW? In the past 16 years, the earliest has been April 8th and the latest was May 16th. Average has been April 29th. There still is ice in the big water North of Warroad and Monument Bay area. So it will probably all be out by May 7th which would put it late on average."
564865,old fisherman,2007-05-01 06:53:00,545,Any report on the water level in the Nestor Falls area? I'm hoping the goverment dock won't be to shallow to use? Thanks
564866,5thsuit,2007-05-01 06:58:00,54,"The Minnesota DNR website still shows LOTW and Rainy as Ice covered. LOTW Ave ice out April 29, Rainy Ave May 3. It seems like every 4 years the Canadian opener is cold one!!"
564867,TECK,2007-05-01 07:13:00,151,More signs of global warming
564870,rpieske,2007-05-01 09:44:00,1276,Water level at Nestor Falls is still very low. It will have to rain quite a bit to bring the lake up. I would think the Gov. dock will be able to launch boats.

It seems like >every 4 years the Canadian opener is cold one!! There still is ice in Whitefish, Regina and the Big Water areas. I believe there is still ice around the Northwest Angle and Monument Bay. But the wind is strong and that will help. A week at most for ice out entirely according to what I've heard."
