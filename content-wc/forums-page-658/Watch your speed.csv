564831,Guest,2007-04-29 12:33:00,0,I have recently heard that the Ontario Police are having a blitz on tickets for speeding. It is STRONGLY suggested that all of you traveling into Ontario stick to the speed limit in all areas. Ticket quotas mean lots of writting. Watch it.
564832,FISHNBOWLJOE,2007-04-29 13:44:00,80,Thanks for the info. We're always careful when traveling in Canada. I had a friend who wasn't a couple of years ago. Cost him an arm and a leg when he got the ticket. Almost got caught again the same trip. They had another speed trap set up about 15 miles down the road from where he just got his ticket. He thinks they radioed ahead with the description of his vehicle. Again thanks and we'll be extra careful. Have a good one. Joe
564833,Guest,2007-04-29 13:46:00,0,Why would you speed through canada? What a beautiful trip with the nature and the lakes and some water falls? Take your time and enjoy the view.
