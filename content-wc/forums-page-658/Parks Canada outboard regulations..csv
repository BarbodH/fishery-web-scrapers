I have heard now many times that fourstrokes are the only motor allowed in Federal parks such as Riding Mountain National park (Clear Lake). This is not correct. This was taken directly off Parks Canada Web site. ""Parks Canada and its partners are committed to protecting our environment and the ecological integrity of our national parks and national marine conservation areas. As a result of public consultation, a decision was made by Parks Canada in 2001 to move towards protecting park waters by only permitting cleaner marine motors. In order to reduce emissions within Riding Mountain National Park of Canada, all internal combustion marine motors used within the Park must be either 4-stroke or direct injected 2-stroke engines effective January 1, 2007.
