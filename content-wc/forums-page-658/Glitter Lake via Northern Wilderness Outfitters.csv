557699,Guest,2006-05-25 18:54:00,0,"I have no experience with Glitter but our party has used NWO for two years now, going on three this August. We have gone to Holly and currently to Carillon for the second time. Top shelf outfitter. Nice cabins. Nice friendly people to work with."
557700,hawks_rule,2006-05-25 19:02:00,115,"Thanks for the feedback regarding the outfitter. I have been to Canada fishing over a dozen times. This is the first time doing a fly-in so I am really excited. We are going 8/25-8/29 and I am looking for some suggestions. I am also concerned about the weight limits, any words of advice would be great. Thanks, Hawks_Rule"
557741,Guest,2006-05-26 17:53:00,0,"You're allowed 80 pounds of gear and groceries per person. Sounds like alot but it adds up quickly. Especially the liquids, water, beer, pop. We take our own food and pack it in large plastic tubs for easy handling. Eat all the fish you want and that will save on weight. We also take rice, noodles, things that are lightweight but filling for meals at the cabin. But nothing beats beans and potatoes along with the fish at a shore lunch. Take the bare necessities for clothing but pack for any situation. We've been there in the middle of August and some mornings were pretty chilly and some were warm. Jigs, spinners, spoons, and a few crankbaits are all we take. According to the brochure, Glitter also has smallies besides walleyes and northerns. Last year we took a flat of crawlers (make sure they're in bedding not dirt) but we ended up using alot of Berkley Gulp minnows and curly tails. We are leaving 8/5 for Carillon. Where are you from? How many are going? Hope your trip is safe and fun. Along with my son it is the highpoint of the summer for us. Don't forget the camera!"
557742,Guest,2006-05-26 17:55:00,0,One more thing---the flight is fun but typically noisy. Take some earplugs.
557755,hawks_rule,2006-05-26 23:22:00,115,"Thanks for the input. There are eight of us going most from Cedar Rapids, Iowa and a few from Des Moines. I don't think I am going to take any live bait, I use a ton of gulp. I like the ease of transportation with gulp. I think we are going to do the pre-purchsed food package. I was just trying to find a good way to cut down on weight. I think I may leave some of my tackle behind. Thanks for the tip about ear plugs. Hawks_Rule"
557810,Guest,2006-05-28 20:55:00,0,"Their food plan looks pretty good. We have thought about it from time to time. But after going with the same guys for several years, we pretty much know what everyone likes and we're not paying for food no one eats. I'm in charge of the shopping, so I'm always looking for deals. Like in my previous post, liquids are the anchor. A case of pop or beer is about twenty pounds. We have taken water in the past (a couple guys are squeamish about drinking lake water). But this year I am looking at getting a filtration kit. Lay out your tackle and look at it several times. The first couple years I went, I always took too much. There is only so much time and not enough time to do everything. Stick with the basics and you'll be better off. Another hint is to get your hands on a rod tube or case. Makes handling easier and less chance of any breakage. Keep in touch."
557816,Guest,2006-05-29 07:48:00,0,"I have no personal or financial interest in any resorts, US or Canada. Even though you are fishing on a different lake and different outfitter, I suggest you read the trip planner put out by Slate Falls Outposts. In addition to packing suggestions, it covers topics, including but not limited to, bears, insects, tips for going through customs, how to keep from getting lost, emergency numbers, etc. The planner is well written and is worth reading for the humor alone. You can find this by googling Slate Falls Outpost trip planner or by going to the website: www.slatefallsoutpost.com Save a few fish for the rest of us!"
557817,Guest,2006-05-29 08:33:00,0,We went to our local menards/home depot and purchased a 10' stick of pvc. It is only $3-4 and you buy caps($1) and cut the 10'pc longer than your longest rod but MAKE SURE to allow for foam in the ends. Use a couple pairs of your socks to also keep the rods apart. I also use bleach/old toothbrush on the cork handles each spring and the rods are as good as new. We also took lemonade/tea/koolaid pkgs with the water filter the gentleman menationed above.
