In reality there are many anglers that legitimately target northern pike in watersheds with musky before the musky season opens. Unfortunatly there are a growing number of poachers that say there ""pike"" fishing while really targeting musky. Catch and release has nothing to do with this law, musky are to be left alone during this time period as they are recovering from the rigors of spawn. The Ministry is starting to really crack down on this. If an angler is observed by an MNR officer with a heavy action musky rod casting 9"" suicks or a 10"" Jake, things will not be in his favor. Obviously theres always a good chance of hooking up with a muskie by accident..dont sweat it. Just try to handle the fish carefully and gently as possible and get an immediate release. Maybe next year you could plan your trip for your group a week later then you could actually target musky. Good Luck! have a safe trip. J.Merics"
564982,Guest,2007-05-06 13:56:00,0,"That makes sense for recovery time and I wish I had paid attention to the dates as I would have liked to really target them- but oh well plenty of smallies, eyes, and northerns to go after and so little time. If I do hook into one- it will be a case of releasing it in the water to ensure the least amount of handling as possible. We need to ensure the future success of these fish. Thanks Chad"
564873,smallieman53,2007-05-01 10:49:00,11,"Dear fellow fisherman, Due to being a husband and father or two young ones, getting to Canada to fish is rare. I finally put together another trip this year after not being able to go for a few years and would love it if anyone has any info to share with me on Minnitaki or Little Vermillion. I will be glad to send a follow up e-mail detailing my trip and helpful tips upon my return. Our plan: Going up June 9th-16th (full moon towards end of the week!) We are 99% catch and release other than a few walleyes for dinner. We love too smallmouth fish first, than walleye, and would also love to get into some big muskie/northern (I know, we want it all!). We are going to stay in the Arm and really not sure what areas to target (outside of the community hole Redpine) and what tactics--we are somewhat green. We were thinking that we would target walleyes/smallies/norhtern on Minnitaki and take a day trip over to Little Vermillion for smallies/muskies. Any info would be great and very much appreciated! Thanks Chad Iowa"
564874,JohnAB,2007-05-01 11:50:00,49,"Hello, Do not overlook Big Vermilion for smallmouth. I found it to be as good as or if not better than Little Vermilion. Also the lake in the Musky reserve is good for muskies and northern pike. Short trip up the river off of Little Vermilion but beware, special hook restrictions are in place for these lakes."
564877,smallieman53,2007-05-01 14:44:00,11,I guess I never even thought about Big V for having decent smallie fishing- that is good news. I always wondered why there are no resorts on that big of lake (maybe there is but I could not find any on the net). I know there is most likely a good and easy answer but does anyone know why there would be no walleyes in Little and Big Vermillion but most all the other lakes within a 1/2 mile have tons of them???? Do you think with low water you can still take the creek back to the Muskie sanctuary?? Thank you for your feedback Chad Iowa
564878,keywest,2007-05-01 15:07:00,3,"Chad ,big vermillion also holds musky as well as alot of smallies , the only camp i know of on it is "" country camping""which sits on it , i been a few times , nice ppl cabins are ok .you can drive dwn the rd to little vermillion if you choose but low water , you wont get to the sancuary . you can put in at the provence park , they have nice boat launch . also a lake thats loaded with walleye up the rd , i think its scout if im not mistakin , google up country camping and they have a map of area lakes , blow it up . hope you and the kids have a nice trip enjoy ,oh big vermillion also holds lake trout"
564906,smallieman53,2007-05-02 19:54:00,11,Thanks for the info on Big V-- I will have to check it out!

One year we were there the last week of May, and we could not enter either English River. If they are open, both should be great in mid-June, if the water level is high enough at English River. One year we were there in late May, in a year when the weather had been colder than usual. Best place at that time was Minnicou Creek.

We have caught only a few smallmouth on Minnitaki in 5 weeks since 2002. We mainly fish for walleyes, but I would expect to pick up more smallmouth than we have, as we spend a lot of time on submerged rocks and rock shelves. I have heard of only one musky caught on Minnitaki in that time, and i did not see a picture of it. The camp we go to has no musky pictures. In 2005 we spent almost the whole week trolling big cranks; got some nice walleyes and northerns but no muskies. Any info on the water level likely on Minnitaki? I heard the ice is going out now. I have been told that last fall was very dry. Last July we had a lot of trouble getting from our camp on Butterfly Lake through the channel to Lyons Bay. If the water level is lower still, I don't know if we can make it. I would not recommend Lyons Bay. We don't have a single reliable walleye spot there, again after lots of fishing in 5 trips. I have been told the deep hole at the east end of Lyons Bay (just west of Burnthut Island) can hold lake trout in mid or late summer, but I have not caught any or even fished for them much. Hope you have a great trip! > >Any info would be great and very much appreciated! > >Thanks > >Chad >Iowa >"
564930,Guest,2007-05-03 20:14:00,0,"smallieman, i have a place on big v just up the road from country camping. we are going to be up there the week after you or else i would take you to a few places personally on big v. this is the man trip so it would be a little rough on small ears. family trip is in august if you make it back up. we do very well on smallies and muskie. that time of year, the chunk rock shorlines on the main lake with blue rapalas are good for smallies and the back bays with dark bottoms produce muskies for us on spinners. email me if i can help any further [email protected]"
564966,Guest,2007-05-05 19:54:00,0,Here's a link to Deer Path lodge on Big V. I stayed there a few years back and can vouch for the outstanding smallie action. They are my favorite also. Nice camp and owners.http://www.deerpathlodge.com/index.htm

564972,Guest,2007-05-06 08:05:00,0,"Well thank you for the Muskie info and we will respect the laws as this is not our main target anyway. I guess the first concern that comes to my mind is that if we do target Northerns on either Little V, Big V (assume they are in there) or Minnitaki how can you distinguish yourself from one type of fisherman vs. the other? I guess this law is more for the guys that want to keep the fish for eating or wall hanging-- I AM NOT ONE OF THOSE GUYS-- any wall hanger will be a fiber glass mount."
