We usually have salted Minnows and a flat of crawlers but was interested to see how the Gulp Alive works. May stop and get a lb of live leeches in Fort Francis. On the Gulp Alive minnows, how do you hook them to a jig? Hook up from the bottom in the mouth or through the mouth and bury the hook in the back? Any rsponse for those of you that have use Gulp Alive would be appreciated. fishman"
568641,Guest,2007-08-27 20:06:00,0,"I hooked 3"" gulp minnows thru the mouth and left the hook stick out of the back. My son just hooked them thru the nose. It didn't make any difference becuase they do gulp them. For us gulp alive performed equal to crawlers or minnows . Best Fishes ! ggg2"

It didnt seem to matter what I was using. If I thought 1 bait was starting to slow down on bites I switched to a different bait.For nightcrawlers and gulp crawlers I used a 3 hook snell, with the other baits I used a jig or a single hook, didnt matter how it was hooked on. It seemed that my bigger fish came on the gulp baits. Has anyone else had this experience ? Good Luck on your trip. W. P."

568715,Guest,2007-08-30 18:14:00,0,Do the leeches stay on the hook as good or better than real ones?? Wondering if we can get more than one fish per leech? thx.
568733,Guest,2007-08-31 16:54:00,0,Yes I have had good results with the gulp baits. Usually I catch 2 to 5 fish on each bait but once in a while they get you the first time. I caught 9 walleyes one time with a gulp nightcrawler and a 3 hook harness. If your on a hot bite its easier to rig and rerig a gulp bait than a live nightcrawler that usually gets destroyed by 1 fish. Good Luck W.P.
568749,Guest,2007-09-03 06:25:00,0,Got back from our Canadian fly in camp out trip. I took along Gulp Alive in Minnows and Leeches. Got the 5 inch Leeches but should have gotten the shorter ones as many times the Walleye's would just get the end of the Leech and pull it off. Pinched off about an inch or so off of the tail and the bait worked. We had live Crawlers and salted Minnows. I think the Leeches caught as many fish as the other live baits. The minnows did not work for me as good as the Leeches. Some times could get 3 to 4 fish per leech before the leech got tore off. Got a few fish but not steady on the minnows. Maybe the size of the minnows were too large. We jig fished all of the time. Jig color did not seem to matter. Not sure if I will go back to Canada and buy the Gulp Alive again. Would probably stay with salted Minnows and Crawlers. Fishing was good. I think the size of the Walleye's was down from last year and we fished the same lake and area. Also did not catch as many fish. Could have been a small cold front that came through. Got the fish from 3 feet to 32 feet.
