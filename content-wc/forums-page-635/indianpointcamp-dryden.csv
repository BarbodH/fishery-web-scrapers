568619,Guest,2007-08-26 21:16:00,0,just returned from week of fishing. lodge owners were best in over 35years fishing canada. lodge was very nice. boats were great. i believe lake was turning over first part of week. but we still caught over 30 walleyes per day (2 persons). first 4 days fish was in 10'-12'. last three days 18'-30'. already made plans to go back next year. highly rec. lodge.
