568236,ap2049,2007-08-10 05:03:00,65,Was at Mahwaki Lodge near Hudson and the fishing was great. Caught a lot of 20 in Walleyes and smaller. Mostly on bottom bouncers and night crawlers. Seemed like a small hammer brass spinner was very effective. It is starting to get cooler in the morning so make sure you take rain gear and layer clothing.
568275,FISH STICK,2007-08-11 13:14:00,135,"Just got back from a week up there yesterday. We fished the Hudson-Sioux Lookout area the first 2 days and out of Timberlane (right next to Evergreen) the next 4. Pretty good fishing! From the Ear Falls area I would definitely recommend running to Mackenzie Bay. Unfortuneately we waited until the last day before going up there, but there was a heavy west wind blowing into the big sandbanks area and we caught 76 walleye in about 6-7 hours. All bigger than 16"" with the biggest at 22 1/4"". Several others at the resort had good days up there too. Shorter runs to Cox Island worked well for us too. Good numbers the whole trip we just couldn't find the bigger fish. Everybody up there says leeches or minnows are the ticket, but we fished with worms all week on spinners and did well. Good luck Matt"
568561,Guest,2007-08-22 11:45:00,0,"Dear Rather be fishin, It is great to see fellow fisherman helping out. I am traveling to Evergreen Lodge next week with my Father-in-Law and a group of his retired buddies from Florida. I have been trying to do some research and look for areas to fish. If you could send me a copy of the map it would be greatly appreciated. I will be the young pup making sure we are catching the fish. I have talked with Pat from the Lodge and she seems like a super nice lady. Any recommendation on bait to bring with - such as size of Jigs/colors etc. Plus is it worth buying Gulp grubs etc? Thanks for the assistance John My E-Mail is [email protected]"
568577,Guest,2007-08-23 17:04:00,0,"We just got back a couple of weeks ago and we couldn't get the fish to bite on Gulp. We tried the shiners, shad, grubs etc.., and had very little success compared to last year when the fish bit on everything. We found minnows worked the best but we also caught a lot on crawlers. Bottom bouncers/spinners with crawlers worked very well when conditions were favorable(we had 3 very windy days, 25mph+ winds) otherwise vertical jigging/drifting kept us occupied. Make sure you have a drift sock(maybe 2) as we caught more fish by slowing our drifts down. Good luck and leave some for next year !!:)"
568108,Guest,2007-08-06 07:48:00,0,"Thank you for your response. We will take your advise and purchase some maps on the way in. We plan to hire a guide the 2nd day depending on how the 1st day goes. YOor offer to mark up a map and scan is appreciated and we have enough time as that we are departing on 8/10. Also, we are taking up GPS so if you have any coordinates that you would like to share this is appreciated as well. Please email to [email protected] I'm hoping the walleye size thing is not a problem as that I'm the camp cook and am really planning walleye meals 2x / day. Thanks again, Paul"

568116,Guest,2007-08-06 11:25:00,0,"Just got back Saturday night from a week long stay on Lac Seul near Ear Falls. The first three days were HOT and calm, the last three days were cooler and windy. The fishing all six days was fantastic. Not only were the numbers good, the quality of fish was very good. We didn't catch any monsters but but we did catch a LOT of 20"" - 24"" fish. I would guess over half of the fish we caught were slot or over, and that makes for a fun walleye trip. I fished Lac Seul the last two weeks of June this year and the fishing last week was better for both numbers and size. You should have a great time. Kansaseye"
568118,Guest,2007-08-06 11:58:00,0,"Lund, going up to Gold Pines Friday. Any chance of telling us about where you were fishing and what you were using for bait. Any info would be great. Went up last year at this time and did good in Steamboat Bay. Thanks"
568121,Guest,2007-08-06 12:16:00,0,Where were you finding the fish and at what depth?
568125,Guest,2007-08-06 14:40:00,0,We also fished Steamboat Bay one day and did well. Fished the south bank in 18 to 23 feet of water. Most of the week we fished humps in the deep water in McKenzie Bay. We found humps in 60 - 70 feet of water that topped out at 8 - 20 feet. When you get to the edge of the hump - hold on to the rod because some of them would just hammer the jig. Lund from Kansas
568140,rather-be-fishin,2007-08-06 23:32:00,429,"Paul I emailed you a map so let me know if you got it and can read it. I just talked to another couple who just got back from Goose Bay Camp. They were there last week....guess they had very windy days and hard to get out and fish....they said they didn't bring any fish home :( Nice thing about the far north, even if it is windy you can fish close by in sheltered areas and catch them....there is even good fishing right off the dock and across from the dock of Timberlane resort... If weather permits it's worth the trip to Steamboat Bay just have Gary/Pat show you the proper travel route to and from! P.S: it won't hurt to pack some hot dogs too! Have a great trip and let me know how you do! Rather-be-fishin AGAIN ON LAC SEUL"
568146,Guest,2007-08-07 11:00:00,0,"Dear Rather be fishin, We will be going to the Ear Falls area September sixth and staying at Evergreen for the first time. Prior to this we have always fished the Chamberlain Narrows area. If you think your map with the marked spots would be benifishal to us we would sure appreciate you emailing a copy to us also. Thanks in advance for any help you can give us!! My email address is [email protected] Locopoco"
568171,rather-be-fishin,2007-08-07 21:48:00,429,"Locopoco I'd be happy to email you a copy of the map...it's a pleasure to always help out another LacSeul fisherman...I know I really appreciate the tips I have gotten from others...hope it helps you... First year I went to LacSeul was in 2003 at Golden Eagle Resort which is right next to Evergreen and we went the last week in August....weather was just right not too hot or cold....a little windy at times, but the walleye like that ""chop""..fishing was good too!!! I've never fished the Chamberlain narrows area, but have heard there are some nice big Muskies in that area....right now I've been exploring McKenzie Bay, Bay of Islands, South Inlet, Manitou Narrows and Fish gut bay area.... It is so awesome that this lake is so big with so much water to explore and so little time to do so!! Have a safe and successful trip! :driver: rather-be-fishin AGAIN on LAC SEUL :cheers:"
568220,Guest,2007-08-09 11:26:00,0,"Here is a mapping site that I found that might help.http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/topo/map Once at the site enter your location in the ""Search using Latitude and Longitude"" section near the lower right of the page. Use 50° 38' N 93° 10' W for the Ear Falls area. Good Luck!"
568027,Paul M,2007-08-02 10:31:00,4,"We have a large group going to Lac Seul out of Ear Falls. In reading some of the recent posts it looks like fishing was pretty tough due to weather. Looking for some more recent reports out of this area to see if fishing has picked up. We have a large number of younger kids so hope it gets better, plus most of our meals are planned around eating walleye and would hate to have to go to Ear Falls to buy Hotdogs!!! Any responses are appreciated. Thank You, Paul"
568028,rather-be-fishin,2007-08-02 11:13:00,429,"Where will you be staying on LacSeul? We just got back from LacSeul Sat. 7/28 Scout Bay area just South of Ear Falls....Fishing picked up Wed. - Sat once we got some wind....too hot and still prior to that. If your up on the very North West End (start of English River) we have stayed up there and there is always good fishing under the railroad bridge entrance to river. Also, there is a reef inside the river just past Golden Eagle Resort on the right hand side.....Goose Island shoreline west and southwest side and points usually produces and Steamboat Bay Channel entrance and West Shoreline of Steamboat bay usually produces. We had best luck on spinners sparkly pink or chartreuse trolling slow windblown side of islands and jigs tipped with minnows chartreuse, gold, white, pink produced well for us. At first we had trouble catching small enough ones to eat (most were 21-25"") but on Wed. finally caught plenty of eaters....that was in Bay of Islands, but don't know if you would want to travel that far depedning on where you are staying... Black flies were really biting bad, so bring LOTS OF BUG SPRAY....Have a great trip and catch lots! Rather-be-fishin!!!!"
568031,Paul M,2007-08-02 12:30:00,4,rather-be-fishing This is my first trip to Lac Seul so I don't know the locations your refering to. We are staying at Evergreen Lodge and it's my understanding that this resort is very close to Ear Falls. Hopefully you know where this is and can advise me of some good locations that are reasonably close to our Lodge. We've been to a number of other Canada locations but never Lac Seul and have always heard good things so I was somewhat concerned reading the recent post about fishing being down. Thannks! Paul

568071,Guest,2007-08-04 07:31:00,0,I'll be up the river from you at Gold Pines during the same time frame. I believe I would bring the hot dogs along for a weenie roast around a campfire some evening. Nothing like a campfire for the kids.
568080,Guest,2007-08-04 16:12:00,0,"We fished out of Evergreen the last week of July last year. My suggestion would be to follow the advise of Camp Owner. For us it was well worth the trip to Steamboat Bay. It takes about 25 - 30 Minutes to boat there but for a day on the water, that's nothing. We fished whatever side the wind was blowing in on and caught fish all day long. A jig & Minnow was the trick for us, green / yellow combo but I don't think it mattered much. Plus if you lose a jig, you only out 25 cents. I don't want to sound cheap but after feeding a dozen bouncers and spinners to the lake, you'll see what I mean. I too took the kids and they were snagged all day long with the bouncher ( let them lay on the side and all ). Don't be afraid to go deep. 20-30' will be the norm. Also, we fished snag free areas if possible. Fishing is just as good and you can get into snagville pretty easy. Lose a rig or two and move out. There's plenty of no snag areas to fish. Be sure you understand the safe travel zone. If you get off line you'll likely lose a prop. I'd follow a lead boat for the first trip out to the lake. If you want more info let me know. I can go on and on. Oh yea, bring some buzz baits for Pike. It's blast to have'em smack it off the surface. JSO"
568104,rather-be-fishin,2007-08-05 21:29:00,429,"Paul The resort owners up there (Gary & Pat) are great resources and will show you on a map on where to go AND hopefully where NOT to go.....I like to purchase a good map of Lac Seul at the Four Season's Bait store in Ear Falls....you'll will go right by it on the road to Evergreen...I like the one with the Northwest part of the map on one side and the Southwest part on the other side....have wore out one map and bought a new one this year....if you have GPS that is very helpful also. I think it is always good advice and well worth the $$$$ to get a guide for your group for one day, preferably 1st or 2nd day you are there.....like is said below....this lake has lots of rock, log hazards and you have to be careful and follow the routes recommended.....if it's not too windy, it is nice to venture down to Steamboat bay, but Goose Bay can be pretty rough too.....there is nice fishing close by.....Evergreen is located in the river system by Golden Eagle and past Timberlane....you will see the railroad bridge and go under it when your leaving the river channel to go out to Goose Bay...so there is nice fishing close by if it is too windy.. I'd be happy to scan and email you a picture of the map on that end with recommended fishing spots if not too late for your trip.....you'll have a blast! It's an awesome lake to fish for walleyes of quality size!!! Sometimes it is hard to catch them small enought <18inches to eat, so I would plan alternate food items on your menu...but we have always ate fish 2 x week, plus took our limits of 4 walleye home....' Good luck! Rather-be-fishin!!!!"
