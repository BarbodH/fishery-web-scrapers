568667,AllenW,2007-08-29 06:43:00,11482,"Why call??? I agree I don't want to hear from work, phonesales or any of the normal day to day garp we have to put up with, but I do like to let the wife know all is well every couple of days, and check on how she or the dogs doing, I call that consideration, must work as we've been happliy married over 25 years now...:) But do I carry my cell while up there? nope, it stays in the truck only to be used when needed.

568680,Guest,2007-08-29 13:18:00,0,I call everyday with a phone card. My camp owner told me my Verizon wouldn't work.

568602,2746,2007-08-24 18:22:00,3206,"actually has to do with the towers in the Red Lake area. They are now analog but, I understand, are being chnaged to Digital. They are just still using old technology......or at least that was the explanation I got."
568604,Guest,2007-08-24 19:44:00,0,"About a year ago ""Bass and Walleye Boats"" had an article about a guy who used a cell phone amplifier to get improved cell signal both on the water and in his home in the mountains. Based on that I bought an amplifier from the sources shown below (GOOD SERVICE and GOOD ADVICE!!). I now get 5-bar rating in northern Minnesota where I had ""no service"" before and I also get service in NE Quadrant LOW where I had ""no service"" before. I spent about $300 on the amp and connectors but the peace of mind (for emergencies) is worth it. Here is where I bought my stuff --http://www.primecellular.com/index.a...OVMTC=standardhttps://www.primecellular.com/index....dual-band+boat"
568607,Guest,2007-08-25 06:34:00,0,I agree with AJB 100%. Its nice NOT to have the phone work! Where are you going/gone on Wabby?
568610,FISH STICK,2007-08-25 22:12:00,135,I was just in Ear Falls 3 weeks ago and made several calls on my Sprint/Nextel combo. That was from our resort on the English river. I hadn't done anything other than dial the number home and press send.
568636,Guest,2007-08-27 19:24:00,0,"whatever has happened up there, phones that worked fine last year did not this year. only one that worked was a brand new verizon phone with the gps option. all others---nothing anywhere."
568638,Guest,2007-08-27 19:39:00,0,Why would anyone want to call home when fishing in Canada? If an emergency happens at home my wife has the camp phone number.
568639,Guest,2007-08-27 19:47:00,0,"noone wants calls up there. my group includes a bank president, 2 business owners and a senior executive type with the us navy. we really cannot ever get totally away from out jobs."
568644,Guest,2007-08-28 04:28:00,0,Thanks for all the help guys. And for all of you that can't understand why I want to call home. I hope you have a great time in marriage counceling. Hey maybe you'll meet Britney.
568655,Guest,2007-08-28 12:32:00,0,"Hey Mike, off topic, but darned if the camp I go to at Lake St. Joseph doesn't now have wireless interet access at the camp store! Some guys use skype (sp?). I like calling home to my family occasionally too. Business? No way."
568662,Guest,2007-08-28 20:15:00,0,"Stop at Dutchies in Perrault Falls and buy a phone card for $10. It will provide enough minutes to make calls all week and some left over for the next year. Most campowners have a phone they will let you use if you have a card or call collect. I go to Canada to get away from my cell phone but agree it's nice to talk to a sweet voice on the other end every couple of days. This way, I only have to talk to the people I really want to. Some knothead from work can't use the excuse ""I did not know you were on vacation, but while I have you...."" Fish on!"
568579,Guest,2007-08-24 04:33:00,0,Does anyones cell woek at Ear Falls. I have a cingular Razr and it hasn't worked in two years. My old Nokia did. Of course it was analog not digital.
568580,JDP,2007-08-24 07:03:00,1457,"I have never had my cell phone work in Ear Falls, Dryden, Sioux Lookout. My ATT&T/Cingular service disappears once I get a few miles up Hwy 502. I hae had Nokia and Razor phones ovet the last 10+ years."
568581,ajbuff,2007-08-24 07:05:00,11,"Mike, You should probably start by checking with Cingular to see if they offer coverage for your plan in that part of Canada. I leave in T-13 hours for Wabaskang and the true joy of my trip is that my cell phone dies about 15 miles north of Fort Francis. Good Luck and tight lines!! AJB"
568584,Guest,2007-08-24 07:51:00,0,"you have to call cingular first to activate your canada service. you must also have a quad phone, like a razr."
568585,stumcfar,2007-08-24 07:55:00,451,We use our cell phones every year to call back and check on the family from in town Ear Falls and Goldpines.
568587,2746,2007-08-24 09:01:00,3206,I'm no expert but I think the keys are the service you have and if your phone is analog. I have verizon and it works but my phone is both analog and digital. Those in our group with digital phones only could not get it to work. Our camp owner explained that most of that area is analog yet but in the process of going digital. One of our guys even had trouble using his on star service and a call to them resulted in the same explanation.
568588,Guest,2007-08-24 09:04:00,0,I have used my verizon phone from wine lake camp from the cabin. It was a analog cell not a digital. The other guy in the cabin had a digital and couldn't call out. Its interesting old technology works and the new doesn't sometimes. Scott
568591,Frankm,2007-08-24 11:04:00,154,My cell went out when we got to Emo. We stay in Ear Falls and I was never able to get service. I have Cingular.
568592,AllenW,2007-08-24 11:32:00,11482,"The old Verizon I had was analog/digital and it would work as far as the Red lake Chukuni campgrounds, if I stood in a certain spot. I've also heard that digital isn't as good for that area, but haven't tried the new phone up there yet. Al"
568596,mwal,2007-08-24 13:11:00,151,I have used my Verison tri mode phones for years in the Sioux Lookout area. It worked in Dryden etc. This year no coverage. I called Verizon said the local carriers no longer have an agreement with Verizon so no coverage. I voiced my displeasure to deaf ears I'm sure. Mwal
