We came home with 11 gallons of berrys, they were large and plentiful. We went fishing 1 evening, but the weather wasn't faverable and we didn't do well. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"

568564,Guest,2007-08-22 18:09:00,0,"John, I took the gps on your island. what fish did you locate there? I have a number of co-ords from previous trips for perch on keynote and Lost. thanks john"
568582,ajbuff,2007-08-24 07:08:00,11,"If anyone has a good area to target perch, I would be interested too. Leaving for Wabby in 13 hours!!!!!!!! Tight Lines, AJB"
568583,Guest,2007-08-24 07:20:00,0,"We are shoving off in 14 days!! Can't wait. Its always a great time up at Wabby. Good luck, leave some fish for us. Let us know how you do."
568605,Guest,2007-08-24 21:33:00,0,here's a nice perch spot: N50 21.253 W93 13.091

568076,Guest,2007-08-04 10:21:00,0,"We just got home from Wabbie. What a great time. Kingfisher camp was just a great place to stay. Jerry (owner) and Lester (dock guy) were super to deal with. The weather was hot and a couple of days super windy but the fishing was great. Walleyes were on the upwind island points. All we ever used was a 1/4 oz jig with a crawler. Many Wallys caught. Nothing huge but enough over the slot to keep a smile on your face. No problam at all catching 17 to 18 inch fish. Bass were stacked up in the first narrows later in the day. All you had to do was drift down with the current and hang on. Again, Jig and Crawler. Lots of Pike, again nothing big. It was tough finding any over 26 inches. With the wind coming out of the west the big water got pretty rough and hard to control the boat on the reefs and keep the jig vert. I found the ""sunken island"" with Lesters instructions and have the GPS numbers if anyone wants them. It comes out of 26 feet up to 7 and is quite large. Lots of fish on it. We crossed over at about 8:00 AM and sailed right through. On the way home we hit the crossing at 9:00AM and only had about a 20 min wait. We had passports and it seemed to go a bit faster. I was just asked to open the trunk on my car. All my luggage was in the boat and covered and I wasn't asked to remove the cover, although the boat ahead of us was. Good Camp, Great people, Good fishing, Good Whisky and a good trip there and back. if anyone wants GPS waypoints just ask."
568088,wildernessgum,2007-08-04 22:02:00,19,Thanks for the report Trapper. I will be heading up to Kingfisher next week Aug 13 with my father-in-law. This will be our 2nd year there. We can't wait. Last year we went in July. Had good luck with the pike. One 40 incher and a couple 36 inchers. Where is that sunken island you speak of? Any luck with perch? Did you go down to Keynote? Wildernessgum
568093,Guest,2007-08-05 09:41:00,0,What did you use to target the larger Northern? We'll be up next week also staying at Sleepy Dog. I would like to get my fishing partner latched on to a 15lb Northern.
568094,wildernessgum,2007-08-05 10:05:00,19,We trolled larger spinnerbaits with twister tails and also trolled some large crankbaits. We definitely caught our fair share of 2-5 pounders as well. The 40 incher I caught in the first lake between the falls and the 1st narrows where generally not a lot of people fish. We were just trolling in 6 ft of water on our way up to the first narrows when it hit on the spinnerbait. The other 2 36 inchers caught in deeper water off a sharp drop off on crankbaits. We generally fished for walleyes early mornings and evenings and target pike the rest of the day. Fairly common practice I think. Sorry I don't have any great secrets I think more luck than anything. Hope you have a great time. wildernessgum
568097,Guest,2007-08-05 11:13:00,0,"We didn't really find the perch. By the time I was told that there were nice ones up in Gawleys bay, the wind was kicking up so hard I couldn't get my wife to go through the second narrows. I have a 17 foot deep V and the prop came out of the water twice in the waves and she said, ""I don't think so."" Never did get down to Key Note sorry to say. I did want to but just never made it. So much water, so little time. As for the pike, you could catch them pretty much on what ever you pitched at um."
568098,Guest,2007-08-05 11:19:00,0,"Oh yeah, The sunken Island....... if you use N 50 21.597 W 93 11.651 it should put you pretty much on top if it."
568101,wildernessgum,2007-08-05 13:57:00,19,BigMike or Trailerguy Any recent reports from Lake Wabaskang from either of you frequent fisherman? Local knowledge is the best!!! Wildernessgum
568102,Guest,2007-08-05 16:59:00,0,Just curious if anybody has portaged back to Wine Lake while staying on Wabaskang? If you did how was the fishing? Scott
568103,Guest,2007-08-05 20:27:00,0,"My new favorite pike bait is a 4 inch 1/2 oz swimbait in fire tiger or perch color. WE caught 4 big northerns (one was 20 lbs and the others not far off) casting them to weeds and rocks in Georgian Bay. And my son hooked, for about 5 seconds, the biggest pike? muskie? I've ever seen in my life. Only got a short glimpse of it before it bit off the line but it was 50+ inches(The bay is known for huge muskies). After the biteoff I tied on a thin titanium leader and no problems. Very versatile bait. Can steady retrieve it or fish it like a jig. Walleye like them too. Also, they seem to come out of weeds well with less snags than a spoon or jerkbait, by comparison. I'll never go to Canada without them now--I'm sold!!!!"
568122,Guest,2007-08-06 13:21:00,0,"Sometimes you just have to tell it like it is...I would rate my last two trips for walleyes as very subpar. I was up the 1st week of July and faced one of the worst bug hatches I've ever seen. Walleyes were very tough to come by. So I was excited to be going back the week of July 21st...only to be met by record high temps. The walleyes were once again very tough to come by, with most being caught in the weedbeds. All of the summer reef and rock areas were for the most part void of fish. Finally on Wed the weather broke with strong winds and pushed alot of baitfish out of the weeds onto reefs...and bingo, there were the walleyes! The last two days of that trip we caught walleyes on the traditional rock structures at will. Northern fishing as has been the case all year was phenomenal. One of the good things about a tough summer bite usually means the bite in late Aug/early Sept is awesome for walleyes. I think this year is alot like that...there are alot of walleyes that have been living in the weeds all summer that are going to be catchable when they migrate out to deeper water. I'll have alot better update soon as I will be up at Wabaskang for 17 days straight coming up."
