It was an enjoyable week with great fishing until the COLD FRONT FROM #### worked its way through last Thursday. 30 mph winds were tough to position ourselves over structure along with the rain and cold making things a tad less comfortable. But we were still able to catch fish which is remarkable in itself. Prior to that, we had some of the best fishing yet with a fair amount of fish over 20 inches. Most were taken on spinner rigs with silver blades, a mix of silver and chartreusse beads and nightcrawlers. A few were taken jigging with green heads(1/4 oz.), twister tail tipped with night crawler. Also caught some with cranks along the edge of the reefs. One thing I noticed was when the cold front came though, everything shut down at the same time- everywhere. We could see the marks in the deep water and had to resort to fishing in 40+ feet to get any bites. Water levels were very good compared to last year. Interestingly bear hunting just started and there were bears hitting the bait piles pretty steadily, one or two small ones wandering up to the fish cleaning house at night. They didn`t cause any problems for us. A bear hunter in camp got a 345 lb bear bow hunting before we left. It was a pretty good sized one from my point of view. Overall a good trip and we booked for next year. Kevin and Diane took very good care of us and were wonderful hosts(and hostess). LazyK"

568554,Guest,2007-08-22 07:34:00,0,"Will be there the first week in Sept. Where did you stay and what area of Minnetaki did you fish? We will be at Abrams Lake Park. I have fished Minnetaki some but would be interested in depth, area, what bait was most successful, etc. I'm usually there in the spring and it is different than fall fishing. Any help, suggestions would be greatly appreciated."
568565,lazyk,2007-08-22 19:17:00,26,"We fished mainly in Lyons Bay and Troutfish Bay. When the wind wasn`t too bad we ventured out into the main lake. The fish were anywhere from 15 to 40 feet deep, deeper after the last cold front. The main lake humps were where the fishing seemed best. We used spinners with crawlers and 1/4 to 1/2 oz. weight. It seemed that the fishing was good everywhere there was good structure so there was no real `hot` spot. Hope you have fun in September. LazyK"
568586,Guest,2007-08-24 08:31:00,0,Thanks Lazyk...I've never fished Lyons Bay or Troutfish Bay. Anxious to give them a try. I appreciate your response.
568599,IaDave,2007-08-24 15:49:00,476,"Haven't been there in a couple of falls but if your coming from Abrams there is red bouy before you go thru Harvey's Narrows. If you are going towards the narrows fish left of the bouy and start at 30'of water with a jig and minnow- Best if you can keep as vertical as poosible. we think one of our guys hooked into a big Laker as he fought a fish for about 1/2 hour and never got it off the bottom. Finally his line broke in about 60' of water. Caught nice walleye there-biggest of the trip was there 27-1/2"". Might be worth a try.I would like to know if it is still good may head next fall."
568603,Guest,2007-08-24 19:03:00,0,Where is this lake located? is it big? Hazards? Please tell all.
568608,prov1900,2007-08-25 08:42:00,544,"Close to Sioux Lookout. Typical Canadian lake as far as hazards, although the Navionics chip helps in some respects. There are some areas that aren't clearly marked from the chip, some very frightening areas in that you are traveling in 90+ fow and come up to 2 fow or less. Great fishing lake. Easy learning curve. Try Donnely's Minnitaki Resort for accomodations. Great place, clean cabins, and the staff is very friendly and helpful. Holler if you need more info."
