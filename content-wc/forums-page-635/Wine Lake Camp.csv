567771,Guest,2007-07-25 11:55:00,0,"Never actually stayed but did portage there for a day trip from Wabaskang...we checked out the camp and if I recall correctly, its one of those camps where you have to ""rough it""..no electricity in the cabins, outhouses, central shower cook your meals on Coleman stoves etc..also have to chop your own ice..IM sure someone will correct me if Im wrong about this but it was several years ago..also I do know the camp is presently for sale"
567781,Guest,2007-07-25 19:46:00,0,They have a very good web site that shows all accomodations. Google Wine Lake Camp.
567842,Guest,2007-07-27 06:13:00,0,"Been to Wine Lake every other year since 2000 just because it make my wife happy I don't go every year. It is a 25 mile boat ride to camp across Wabaskang and there is a portage on the way. The portage isn't bad at all, if the water is high Herb will drive the boats down and if he can't he has a roller system to roll the boats down. Usually the whole camp is there at the same time so everyone helps each other. The one thing to remember is to bring everything you need in with you because they have limited supplies at camp and it is a long way out. The cabins are nice and he has remodeled 4 or 5 of them. Like the other post said their is no electricity, Coleman Laterns light up the cabins at night. You have outhouses to use which are real clean. Their is a central shower house you can use. Each cabin has a propane refrigerator with a top freezer. The stoves aren't coleman stoves but propane burner stoves. No oven. Some of the cabins have gas grills and you can get the propane fish fryers for outside. The two water front cabins have there own dock and everybody else uses the main dock. There are only 7 or 8 cabins so there maybe 30 people in camp a week. The do have a ice plan where you can shave off your own ice from the ice house. The cut ice in the winter in big blocks. We do this because it makes those evening drinks even better. Also, we put a cooler in the ice house with all our fillets to take home. The service is excellent from the owners. They are always working on something but if you need something they will go out of their way to help you. They don't cook for you except on the fish contest day were they make homemade ice cream and brownies. Fishing wise I can't compare to other lakes in Canada because I haven't been to another camp. We always eat fish everyday and bring our limits home. I target walleye in the morning and evening and then fish for pike, trout, and smally's in the daytime. To me Wine Lake takes you off the beaten path to relaxation and the closest road is 25 miles away. It is quiet with only roughly 30-40 people in camp and you can fish 9 different lakes if you want. It is the only resort on the system but you might see some Wabaskang resorts come down, which I see a lot of times. If you have any other questions you can email me at [email protected]. Scott"
567987,Mr. Walleye,2007-08-01 11:38:00,74,"We went there a couple of times several years ago. Great accomodations and very well run camp. Walleye fishing was not near as good as we hoped as we have been spoiled by fly-ins. Back then Wine seemed over-populated with ""snake"" northerns. We had our best walleye action when we boated into Ghost Lake from Wine. Hope this helps!"
568611,Guest,2007-08-26 13:03:00,0,Just wondering if anybody has been to Wine Lake this year. If you were what was the fishing like? Did they build any new cabins? How was the boat ride from the new pickup spot? Did anybody stay at the Wabaskang outpost. Scott
568615,Guest,2007-08-26 18:24:00,0,I havent been there in years and never stayed there..we stayed on Wabaskang one year and used that portage to get to Wine Lake..where is their new pick point located?
568616,Guest,2007-08-26 18:46:00,0,I wasn't there this year but the new pickup spot is close to Kingfisher Lodge on Wabaskang near the perault falls. It is listed as there outpost cabin but it is on Wabaskang. Scott
568633,Guest,2007-08-27 16:51:00,0,I have been going to this camp for 16 years straight. It is the best kept secret around. Walleye fishing strong Opener till late June. Lakers good early spring and late september. We have started getting small mouth in last three years on regular basis in a river system which is a portage away. With Hot shower house and propane stoves and fridge there is no roughing it. Bring some big spinner baits and throw weed lines after the morning walleye bite and you will catch ton 24 to 32 inch northern all day long. If you want list of what to provision I have in an excel format with menu etc. Doing this long time and learned what to leave home. [email protected]
