I use it on the Turtle Flambeau Flowage in Wisconsin which is full of wood and they are the best. http://www.isgfishing.com/ I have no connection to this product...only that I use it and they are great. I have had great success on beaver knockdowns for walleyes. I do not know if the wood is burned will it turn fish away.
