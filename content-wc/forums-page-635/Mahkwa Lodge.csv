Any recommendations on where to fish, bait, etc. Have not fished this lake in the fall, only June. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks in advance."
568621,Guest,2007-08-26 21:35:00,0,i fished at dryden but spoke to 4 guys who fished where you are going said lake turned over last week and fish went deeper. said they caught fish 17'-28' wed. thu fri. mentioned steamboat. hope this helps. we caught fish on waybegoon 10'-12' early wk and later 18'-30' so sounded to me fishing was about same. minnows on live bait rigs were best for us and the guys i spoke to today said worked best for them also.
