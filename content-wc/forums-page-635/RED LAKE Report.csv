568552,Guest,2007-08-22 06:02:00,0,"Bud, Thanks for the water temp report, I appreciate it. Got a question for you or the board...we do a fly in out of red lake and last year had great success using chunks of large dead ciscoes on jigs basically sitting on the bottom. Went so far as to put a whole dead ciscoe on a let it sit on the bottom..resulted in a 26"" eye..we had been worm/leech jig guys before this and it took us off guard a bit..have you heard of this before?? Thanks"

568556,AllenW,2007-08-22 08:10:00,11482,"bman, we've been using dead/frozed minnows for years with great results, put them on a 1/2oz or so jig and hit 30+ foot of water for the most part, late Sept btw. After live minnow's it our next favorite bait for eye's Al"
568558,Guest,2007-08-22 09:19:00,0,"Yep, Works great, we use em all the time in the winter. We attach a frozen minn, Shinner, ciscoe, with a live minnow..My buddy picked up a 30 inch Walleye in Gullrock 2 winters ago. Can you say WOW!!! If your jiggin' up and down, the big ones are pretty lazy. When they see a fat free meal they seldom say no... Mista W"

568296,Guest,2007-08-12 16:59:00,0,"Well well, I just finished an 8 day fishing frenzy.. Lots of fish out there. Almost every hump, point, ridge, rockpile are loaded with fish... I caught a few 27, 26, 25, 23, 21, 19 and a few 18 inchers. Those 27's where fun but they where sitting in deep cool waters. I nearly lost one. I did everything but give her mouth to mouth... but she came through after 45 minutes of sweet whispers and mesaging her soft belly... We definately bonded. She promised to meet me at the same rockpile on Sept. Long.... I told her to bring a few of her friends, her fat bellied friends. lol.... I covered mostly the fisher Island and behind MacKenzie... Heading West Tomorrow for some fat bellied 29 inchers... Two more days of hoggin and I'll take break... Now I have to clean up a few Wallees for din din.... Catch yas on the water... [email protected] Mista W PS: be nice to my honeys..."
568297,Guest,2007-08-12 17:24:00,0,"Just heard from Mary Spenceley at South Bay on Gull Rock that they had the worst rain storm that she has seen in her 30 years there......washed out the dock road etc. She ALSO said that the fishing was fantastic and that her customers were really grumbling because they were releasing all the over 18 inch fish. Yes, be nice to those honeys......they make the ""honey's"" that we will fish for in years to come. It makes no sense to harvest reproducing females. Just plain downright stupid. Counting the days......12!!! Mike"
568337,Guest,2007-08-13 21:45:00,0,Four days to my departure. I love releasing those big fish. Last year went up in July and the fish were more scattered and we caught a lot more saugers and smaller walleyes. Looking forward at getting back to our typical time of year.
568351,Guest,2007-08-14 10:51:00,0,"Oh yeah, The walleyes are hitting hard... Heading out this afternoon for my last session until next week. Have to put a little bread on the table, walleyes are nice on the table but they don't pay the bills. lol... Still looking for that hidden honey hole....Still searching for the Bay of Pigs.... Happy Hunting Mista W"
