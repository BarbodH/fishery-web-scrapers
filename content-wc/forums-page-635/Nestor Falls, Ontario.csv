568720,old fisherman,2007-08-31 05:23:00,545,I'll be there Sept. 6 and I'm wondering how the fishing is on LOTW or at Arrowhead Resort. Thanks Old Fisherman
568724,Guest,2007-08-31 08:09:00,0,What difference does it make? You will be fishing that week and the rest of us will be working and hoping our wives don't start a new HoneyDo list. Hope you have a great week and may the fish attack your bait all week.
568728,rpieske,2007-08-31 11:31:00,1276,The walleye fishing and crappie fishing on Arrowhead's lake has been pretty good this year. LOTW walleye and crappie has been doing all right in the past couple of weeks. Some big northerns being caught and the muskies have improved in the last ten days. Looks like you are timing it about right. I'll be leaving here on the 10th after 4 months. Tell Dessie and Clyde Hi from Bob Pieske. Good Luck!
