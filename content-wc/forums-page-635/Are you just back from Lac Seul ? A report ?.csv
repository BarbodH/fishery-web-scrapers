568618,Guest,2007-08-26 20:51:00,0,"Nice question with so many variables. If the wind is blowing in, the walleyes will be shallower. We caught fish in 16 fow with a moderate chop on the water. Other places where the waves really kicked up, we caught them shallower. Boat control was a real challenge. It is almost impossible to say that you are going to catch them at a specific depth if you don't know the wind and weather pattern."

568632,Guest,2007-08-27 16:27:00,0,"you are trying to make me recall a week i'm trying to forget. arrived friday night to 37 degrees. left home in the 90s. seems like there were 2 straight days of fairly strong east winds. then wsw turning to wnw. we were in a camp boat with no trolling motor, so holding on fish was tough. found them from 20' to about 38'. water temps 63 to 67. huge schools of baitfish all over the lake. really had to work for a bite. had about 2 or 3 four hour periods where we caught fish fairly consistantly. mostly bottom bounced with crawlers and minnows. never came out of my guideware bibs all week with the exception of about a 3 hour period. believe we got rained on for a little while at least once every day. came close to getting skunked on lac seul on two different days. picked up a lot of pike bottom bouncing. the good news was for my brother and brother in law. the pike fishing was very good in the shallows. the big girls are back up in there. they got a 43 and a 40 and several in the mid thrities. my son and i have no interest in that so we suffered with the slow walleye bite. the last day we went 2.5 miles from camp. wind howling out of the wnw. temp in the 50s. found fish setting below baitfish at 38 feet. caught 2 in about an hour and went back to camp for a nap and to pack. kinda lost interest. the guys next door went down to mckenzie with big lunds and had a good day. they were running their trolling motor batteries dead every day trying to hold over fish to jig. overall a rough and very sporadic week."
568640,Guest,2007-08-27 19:58:00,0,"Returned last night from Lac Seul. 307 walleyes for 2 people in 5 days. 1/2 of those were slot or over. Most fish last week were in 14' to 30"". I caught a 26"" in 14' and 2 minutes later my son caught a 26"" in 30' on the same reef. Crawlers, minnows or gulp alive all seemed to work equally. Also caught 16 northern while walleye fishing. We presented everything behind bottom bouncers either controlled drifting or slow trolling with the bow mount. Quite challenging because of strong wind. Best Fishes ! ggg2"
