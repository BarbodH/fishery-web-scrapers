568626,Whopper,2007-08-27 11:53:00,340,"Been across twice this year and it the tale of two tales. Ist crossing was the walleye opener at Fort Francis and not a problem too and from. Second trip was just a little over a week ago at Windsor, it was a little over an hour from the time I pulled up to the customs window till I was able to continue my journey. Got a rookie or trainee at the booth, was asked about three times as many questions than ever before plus was made to show two forms of ID, was made to go to inspections while two ladies went through the cab of my truck, they were very pleasant, then I had to go register my boat and the man that waited on me was nice enough. After boat registration with my son waiting for me in the truck I was getting back in my truck when a voice speaks ""and just where do you think your going"", Told the young man I was leaving and he says ""no your not and please stand in front of your truck"" WTF?...I say to the young man why do you want me to stand in front of my truck? and he reponds ""I want to have a look inside of your truck"" now at this point I tell him that that was already done by two of his fellow female officers to which he made me prove at this point,then the young man acts deflated. Now I have crossed the border at three differnt locations at least twice a year since 911 and never been delayed that long on any of my trips going in, and another thing I noticed was there were about at least 25 inspectors plus rovers with dogs this time through which I have never seen before. All said and done I had all the proper paper work, ID's and registrations and was allowed to enter Canada so no problems there. Just took me awhile longer than it normally would and must have been my time to get checked. Coming back the only question asked after we showed ID's and birth certificates was who's truck is this? and away we went."

We pulled up to the stop sign on the south side of the bridge and one agent had just finished a pickup in front of us. Other years, if you were at the border after 7AM, be prepared to wait. The agent asked the standard questions and popped the back door on the van. He said, ""Have a nice trip home"". No x-ray either."
568712,Guest,2007-08-30 12:07:00,0,it seems most of the time its the luck of the draw. this year crossing on highway 16 in montana the canada guy asked only a couple of questions and since we dont have a plate on the front of the car i dont know that they have us in the computer like they do at international falls. coming back even with passports it was the 3rd degree. they asked about meat and sausage we might be bringing back. they never mentioned them in baudette or IF. ir suprised me that the first thing he asked was citizenship even though they had our passports. there is no telling what you might run into when crossing the border.

I'd say we are inspected about 25% of the time. We don't get bent out of shape when they check us and consider it a plus if they don't. They are just doing their job.... granted some do it better than others. Last year 1 hr and 15 minutes at the Canadian border. This year a 40 minute line at the US side. Like I said... plan on it. It's a small price to pay for enjoying such a beautiful country. Planocat"
