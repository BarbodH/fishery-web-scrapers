565645,Guest,2007-05-28 18:24:00,0,"Hard to admit here, but I'm a rather crappy jig fisherman when it comes to walleyes. I catch them alright trolling spinners and crankbaits, casting crankbaits, spinnerbaits, and with Lindy rigs and slip floats. But when I put a jig on, I may as well be fishing in my bathtub. The situation is self-fulfilling, since I don't catch fish with them, I don't use them much. But this year I've decided to spend more time with them. Anyone have words of advice or encouragement? If it matters, my ""light artificial"" setup is a medium/fast 6.5' graphite spinning rod, with the main line #15 PowerPro with a 4-6' fluoro leader. I don't think my setup is the problem, if you know what I mean."
565647,Guest,2007-05-28 19:27:00,0,"All I say is this...if your trolling and start to catch fish, stop over that spot and try jigging...works for me"
565648,dave10,2007-05-28 19:34:00,342,"I think I would adjust your tackle - it sounds too heavy and you're probably missing light bites. We use 6 or 8 pound test line, with no leader or terminal tackle - just tie a plain lead head 1/4 ounce jig (3/8 if you're going down more than 30 feet or it's windy) directly to your line. Then, trust your locator, and assume the bumps on the bottom might be fish holding tight. Use your engine in reverse to hold the boat right over the spot where you catch the first few fish. It's often the case that the walleye will be tight to particular weeds or a rock hump and you won't catch them ten feet away from that spot. We often hold straight down almost like we're dead sticking, just a half crank off the bottom. I'll be anxious to read what ideas others have to offer! Dave"
565649,Mr. Walleye,2007-05-28 19:36:00,74,"Hi North I usually just use 6 or 8 lb. mono. Make sure you have a jig that is heavy enough. The vast majority of the time, we use 1/4 oz. If dead calm, or real shallow bite (under 7 ft.)we'll use 1/8 oz. We use 3/8 only when really windy or when fishing deep water (20 ft. plus). A lot of guys hear the pros say to use the lightest jig possible where you can still feel bottom. They think an eighth or even a sixteenth oz. is necessary and then they think they are on the bottom when they really aren't. It's much better to use a jig that's a little heavy then one that's a little light. The key is to keep the jig within a foot of the bottom (in most situations). Let it touch bottom, and then slowly lift and drop it back again. THE BIG KEY IS TO KEEP YOUR LINE TAUGHT AT ALL TIMES! If you jerk it up and let the line go slack before lifting again, you'll miss a ton of hits, or be too late if you do feel something. I used to try and let walleyes ""take it"" before setting the hook. Bad idea. As soon as I sense anything ""different"" with the jig, I set the hook. I still miss my share, but my hooking percentage is way higher than it used to be. If using live bait, use a short shank jig like a Northland Fireball. If crawlers is your live bait of choice, use no more than half of one. Walleyes don't feed on crawlers swimming around in a lake. They feed on 2-5 inch minnows. A crawler just simulates a minnow to them, and a crawler that's 6 inches or longer is not what they normally look to feed on. Plus, they'll just bite the end off anyway, so why not speed up the hooking process by shortening the crawler. If using plastics like twister tails, the ""normal"" hook is great. Hope this helps!"
565652,Guest,2007-05-28 21:19:00,0,I was a bad jig fisherman until I tried Gulp Minnowgrubs on a 1/4 ounce jighead with a small piece of crawler added for a little extra scent. With this setup I was outfishing the two guys in my boat that had spinners on.

This allows me to cover most of the reef. - Never try to force your boat back to reef , you're better off starting all over with repositioning your boat ? I hope some of these tips will help?"
565659,jigman 2003,2007-05-29 07:05:00,981,"I prefer a shorter rod for jigging than some of the others here. My favorite is a 5'9"" Walleye Signature rod from BPS. It has enough strength in the butt to rip a jig out of the weeds, but is sensitive enough to detect light biters. The best tip I could offer would be to go high vis line and become a line watcher. Many of the fish I catch on jigs are caught due to seeing the bite instead of feeling it. As the jig is falling (if you're casting), watch that line, any little ""tic"" means set the hook. Don't worry about the line spooking the fish. If you feel you must, tie on a short section of fluorocarbon leader."
565660,Guest,2007-05-29 07:08:00,0,"Well, I am a reformed jigger. I use to jig exclusively, thinking anything else was heresy -- at least that is what the pro who taught me to vertical jig used to think. :-) Now I use the other techniques you mentioned as well. I can tell you what I was taught to do and still do when I jig. 1.) I DO use the lightest jig I can get away with. Typically that is 1/16th ounce. In wind I go to 1/8th. No, I don't ""feel"" the bottom. I watch the line pile up on the surface of the water and THAT is how I know I am on bottom. Then I wind up the slack, plus about 2 turns on the reel handle and I use that depth. Occasionally I spool out more line to check that I am still on bottom and repeat the process. 2.) Work the jig up and down. Different days require different work techniques. Find the one that the fish want on THAT day. This can be raising and lowering the jig as much as 2 feet in a slow motion, or holding it in one place just shaking it, or raising it sharply 5 or 6 inches and letting it drop at its own speed, or holding it in one position and not moving the jig at all, etc. 3.) I use my bow trolling motor to hold us in EXACTLY one spot providing we are marking fish under that locator. ""IF YOU THINK YOU ARE MOVING, YOU ARE GOING TOO FAST"" my mentor used to say. You can see flecks of material on the water surface, or spots of foam, etc. to use as reference points to make sure you are not moving. 4.) Stay on THE SPOT ON THE SPOT. A walleye pod can be concentrated in a spot the size of a suburban lot. HOWEVER, there is a spot about the size of most people's dining room table which will contain the most fish. Find it with your locator and stay with it. Note: that spot will move as the fish graze out a spot and need to find more food, so you will have to chase the spot on the spot occasionally. Note: even being off the spot on the spot by one boat length means one person can be catching fish of that spot and the partner in that same boat might not be. I have my partner watch the dash locator as I fish watching the front locator to make sure we are both over fish (my partner is usually my wife, so I have reason to want to stay on her good side ... lol). 5.) 80% of your bites will occur ON THE WAY DOWN as the jig drops. What happens is, you raise the jig, the walleye spots it, swims over to it, and then hits it. It takes a bit of time for the fish to get there after spotting your bait, so it hits the bait on the way down. A ""bite"" is a VERY SLIGHT increase in weight of your jig. It feels like your 1/16th ounce jig has increased to a 1/8th ounce jig. If you feel that slight weight increase, drop your rod tip to the water. If you can feel that fish, that fish can feel you!!! It will be trying to spit out the bait as fast as it can. Don't let it feel you -- drop that rod tip to the water instead. THEN, wind up the slack you created by dropping the rod tip, and set the hook hard. VIOLA! One walleye in your boat! 6.) Until you get used to jigging and hooking fish, you can add a soft plastic body (jig tail) to your hook. The fish will have trouble spitting out the jig when he feels you. The soft plastic will catch on the little teeth behind the big teeth in the fish's mouth -- just like you have trouble spitting out very soft bubble gum. Put the soft plastic on first and add a half-crawler on top of that for scent. 7.) I use 6 pound test FireLine. Its sensitivity is amazing. Line diameter DOES make a difference and my 6 pound Fireline will usually outfish even 8 pound Fireline. I didn't believe it until I experimented and proved it to myself, but my mentor was right. Now I firmly believe in using the thinnest line I can. Fish do see the difference. Plus, in the wind, the thicker line will billow more even in the short distance between your rod tip and the surface of the water. That billow affects your ability to feel the ""bite"" and also your ability to move your jig in the ""technique of the day"". My wife was a horrible jigger until I put FireLine in her reel. She use to hate jigging and get very frustrated with her lack of success. Now she catches as many fish jigging as I do and loves vertical jigging. She sits there nailing fish and grinning. 8.) Make sure your hook is sharp! I sharpen my hook every 30 minutes or so when we are nailing a pod of fish. I hope these tips help. I have passed my mentor's training on to several frustrated jiggers and they improved almost immediately. I hope you do too."
565661,Guest,2007-05-29 07:16:00,0,I too am not that great at jig fishing. So i try a slip jig system. I use a small bullet weight and slide that on and then use a very tiny sinker for a stopper with about 12-18 inches of line and then tie on a floating jig head. When the walleye picks it up the weight slides so they do not feel it. I just bump it up and down every so often. I tip it with an active minnow. works fabulous.

Like a previous post stated, most hits occur on the drop. Therefore, watching the line as it drops will be important in detecting the bite. Sometimes you will need to set the hook when you feel nothing. This is when the fish takes the jig and is moving upwards. When the fish are aggressive, many times you will feel a tick on your rod. I would reccommend setting the hook as soon as possible when you think there is a fish present or when you feel nothing."

Usually I'll use a 1/4oz jig but for deeper water i go for the 3/8 or even heavier. Probably the most important thing for jig fishing is the depth of the jig. One day we were fishing and i kept catching little snakes while the two others in the boat were hauling in walleyes. It turns out i was too far off the bottom. It varies but usually once i hit the bottom i crank up 1/2 to 1 1/2 turns, or keep adjusting until you hit the ""zone""."

568745,Guest,2007-09-02 12:47:00,0,">Question for the jigisup...You said you use 6# fireline & I >am wondering how you get snags out w/out using a mono leader? Sorry, I have been fishing a lot the past 10 weeks and missed your question. Several things come to mind when I read and re-read your question. First, I am not sure I understand it fully. I don't understand how you would think that a mono leader would help you get snags out. By breaking off? By stretching? To me, Fireline works well at trying to get out of a jigging snag. When you are snagged, pointing the rod tip at the snag and then whipping it up and down will send all that pressure/relaxation to the hook and will often cause the hook to back out of the snag, especially with rocks (whereas mono line will just stretch and not snap out of the snag). Second, when I am jigging, I am referring to vertical jigging, not casting and retrieving. One should not get many snags vertical jigging (after a bit of practice, that is). You lower the jig to the bottom and then lift it several inches ( maybe up to a foot or a little more) from the bottom and jig in that position. You should not have the jig lying on the bottom -- THAT would indeed get you snagged. If you have further questions, I would be happy to answer them. I will watch this post for a bit. Again, I am sorry to have missed your question when it was originally posted."
566290,Guest,2007-06-14 12:00:00,0,"Aye, very good words. I agree with everything except I'd move that sharp hook thing to number 1 because it is just amazing how often a hook tip gets bent or dulled jigging. Walleyes have some pretty tough mouths and you need a sharp hook to set the bite."

I still miss my share, but my hooking percentage >is way higher than it used to be. With a very light jig + live bait, my recent experience is that a fish will keep it in its mouth for a long time, 10 seconds or more. We never see this with 1/4 or 3/8 jigs, and we see it noticeably less often even with 1/8 jigs. The light jig gives you plenty of time to reel up the slack and get a booming hook set. The fish will often tug back repeatedly before the hook is set, which we never see with heavy jigs. Of course, don't wait this long to set the hook, just making a point. Almost all the hits on these very light jigs occur while the line is slack and the jig is dropping. Since the fish will hold onto the jig, you don't have to keep the line tight. We like to keep a tight line while pulling it up, and we do get some hits on the way up. Another advantage of small jigs: they snag much less often, and can often be ripped out intact when they do snag. If you can't feel the bottom, just let it drop on slack line. With 10 lb Fireline or 8 lb Seguar fluorocarbon, we have no problem feeling hits, and these lines are strong enough that they usually stay together when ripping the jig thru a snag. If using live bait, use a >short shank jig like a Northland Fireball. I actually prefer longer shank hooks. With a minnow, run the hook into the mouth, out the gills, and then thru the back. This kills the minnow faster than just hooking thru the lips or back, but the falling motion of the light jig with the minnow simulates the action of a dying minnow, so there is little need to keep the minnow alive. We get lots of fish with the tail of the minnow and hook just inside the mouth. We would miss these fish with a short-shank hook. So far I have not had much luck with stingers. I am looking for suggestions on how to move around and still fish these light jigs. We have our best luck with them while anchored, then pitching the jig out to scan for fish in the area. Most hits come with the jig right under the boat, some hits occur away from the boat. This gets harder to do in deeper water or when you don't already know of a good spot to anchor. For whatever reason, my boat is very hard to stop completely otherwise, partly because it is usually windy (20 mph or more) here in Iowa.
