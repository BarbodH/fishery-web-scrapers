568600,Guest,2007-08-24 16:16:00,0,I am trying to identify a fishing lodge with very good facilities and service in Ontario or Quebec. I need a place that would cater to my wife who would like to do something besides fish all the time. Something more like a true resort with a little more upscale facility. Of course the fishing needs to be good too. Any ideas?

Nearby Golf, Shopping, Horseback Riding, Sightseeing etc. They can send you all the information. In short she will have a lot of things to do and the walleye, bass and pike in the river are worth the trip. I have been there four times in last twelve years."
