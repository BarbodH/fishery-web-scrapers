568635,Guest,2007-08-27 19:05:00,0,"Ok, quick question, the lodge we are staying at has a phone for public use but it is a radio phone and most people use their credit card to call out. Will a calling card such as CiCi or IDT work on these?"
568637,Guest,2007-08-27 19:29:00,0,I just used the same type of phone at my lodge a few weeks ago. I used the calling cards from the 7-11 in Dryden and it worked just fine.
568285,Matches,2007-08-11 19:14:00,236,"Wondering what you think is the best calling card to have for calling from Canada to US. I've had the same calling card from AT&T for years. I thought the minutes were reallly being used up fast when calling from Canada. I charged my card 1,000 minutes for $60.00. 6 cents a minute right? Here is where they got me. Using a pay phone is a .45 connection fee per call. Then calling from Canada, they charge 12 minutes of card minutes for every actual minute talked. So I was paying .45 Plus .72 per minute. Even when calling state to state in the US, they charge 5 card minutes for every minute talked (.30 per minute). So I did some searching, and the best card I could find on the internet was The CiCi calling card for multiple calls. I called them and verified rates. 3.3 cents a minute off the card for every minute talked. In addition, if you use the 800 number to call out, they charge an additional 3 cents per minute. Still not bad. They do charge .80 (approx. 24 card minutes) connection fee when using a pay phone to call out, per call. With this card, I am still way a head than AT&T. I found it at this site:http://www.ontariophonecards.ca/cardinfo The only negative I see with it so far is the card does expire after 6 months. If someone knows of a better one, please let us know. Thanks"

One if you make a lot of short calls, and one if you make fewer calls but stay on the phone a long time. I have never used more than a $10 card and I call home every day to talk to the wife and kids."
568288,Guest,2007-08-11 20:38:00,0,"I do alot of calling using phone cards. CICI is the best. If your worried about expiration of them,, buy a few $5 ones."
568289,Guest,2007-08-11 21:20:00,0,"Try IDT, best we've found. You can recharge the card whenever it gets low in minutes. Can use it in Canada or Mexico."
568291,Guest,2007-08-12 06:02:00,0,I am with Dave B. We buy ours at the little grocery in Nestor Falls and I don't even know what the name is?? We typically call every day and talk for 5-10 min and the card last us all week for $10. I have no idea what the charges are per minute or connection? In fact there is always some minutes left when we leave and we leave the card by the lodge phone and hopefully someone else will finish up the minutes.
568435,Guest,2007-08-16 21:09:00,0,"Check with your resort operator. They may have phone cards available if they have a payphone on the property for guests. We have them in 5 and 10 dollar options and you can get about an hour of talk time for 5 bucks. There is a connection fee for them from payphones that you can't get away from. We've tried and tried with our supplier, but bell Canada dings every calling card for a certain amount. The rates are better depending on how much you want to profit on the cards. We have the best rates we can get as we think it's just something the guests should have access to while they are up in Canada."
568448,Guest,2007-08-17 12:27:00,0,"Here is what I found.....I have my own business so I got an 800 number. Nobody uses it, only I do when I call from Canada home. I don't know about the rates where you guys all live but this thing costs me $.03/month to have and there was NO set up fees. The only charges I get is the monthly bill FOR 3 cents, and any minute charges for when it is used, those are .08 cents a minute from Canada. So I keep the 800 number just for my trips. My last bill came for the 800 number and it was $18.80 for the month, I write them a check for $30 and in the next years worth of monthly bills I have a credit. Fun to get a credit statement in the mail every month. Something to possibly check into."
568451,T Mac,2007-08-17 14:46:00,10084,I know one thing. Don't use your cell phone unless you are feeling invincible. Your wife might kill you when she gets the bill. Mine produced quite an oratorical display complete with epitaths about if it ever happened again.
568470,Guest,2007-08-18 10:06:00,0,$10.00 at Walmart will let you talk more than any fisherman should. They work in the US & Canada just the same. The only diff is you call different number to get started in Canada. JSO
