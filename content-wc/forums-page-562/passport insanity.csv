1128321,trapper_john,2009-08-12 14:03:00,83,"we got passports for a trip to Ireland a few years back. Very easy to obtain. I don't know if it's easier to cross the border with passports or not. We never had any problem before. I will say though when crossing with a passport, I just handed them out the window of the truck, they handed them back and said ""enjoy your holiday."""
1128801,Guest,2009-08-14 12:06:00,0,It's a good thing Obama has a passport cause I think I heard he is coming up short in the birth certificate dept.
1128816,alanexpup,2009-08-14 13:18:00,278,"HI. last year the wife and i had our passports. we were coming back in the usa from canada at some little poducnk place in the middle of nowhere from saschachtawan into montana. we thought with the passports it would be a slamdunk because we were the only car around for miles. well think again. there were 4 customs guys that took turns looking at the passports and asking question, like we are the first people they have seen in weeks trying to cross and they all had to do their job. it took about 10 minutes. that was a real load of crap. talk about haveing a slow day."
1128856,Opti-Mist,2009-08-14 16:12:00,1402,When he visited Pakistan in 1981 it was not on a U.S. passport as Pakistan was on the State Dept. don't go there list.
1129019,Dipstick,2009-08-15 13:48:00,101,This is why blanket comments on the internet need checking. Check out this site.www.Snopes.com/politics/Obama/passport.asp
1093184,walleyeduran,2009-04-01 13:42:00,286,"I told my wife that I refuse to get a passport, what is the worst thing that could happen? You go into Canada fishing for a week and the US will not let you go home!!! Sounds like a win/win situation for me and a great excuse to stay in Canada. PS wife figured my plan out and is making me get a passport."
1093239,rpieske,2009-04-01 16:06:00,1276,"Things have changed: Updated February 2009- Bottom line: As of June 1, 2009, everyone from every country that comes to Canada by air, land and sea needs a passport or equivalent travel document. (Some exceptions apply to children's passport requirements) Before June 1, 2009, U.S. citizens do not necessarily need a passport entering Canada by land or sea, but need valid ID that proves identity and citizenship. Currently, everyone arriving in Canada by air needs a passport or equivalent travel document, such as a NEXUS Card."
1093268,Guest,2009-04-01 17:25:00,0,Every civilised country in the world requires passports for entry into it's borders from non residents. except North America.
1093277,Guest,2009-04-01 17:42:00,0,Obabikon. I can never really figure out where you are coming from. The Canadians are going to force us to have them (passports). Where you not born in Rainy River.
1093287,Dan G,2009-04-01 18:24:00,31,Everyone has their own opinion on the passport subject. Some are very messed up....but we've hammered the subject to death almost. Time to move on to a new topic...lol.
1093386,english bob,2009-04-02 06:29:00,14,"Yes Dan G, it is time to move on. Those who think they have a given right to enter a country without a passport will never be convinced of the advantages to THEMSELVES of having one!As a citizen of the UK, I have to:1) Have a passport to enter Canada - and who is their head of state?2) Have a passport to enter the UK when arriving home.3) Send my passport details, travel details etc to the US DHS 72 hours before I arrive in US and still sometimes get a hard time at immigration when I arrive. If any of this restricts the lunatics from travelling around the world, then I am proud to show my passport to anyone who wants to see it!"
1093662,Steve of Madison,2009-04-02 21:37:00,230,Right on BOB!
1093762,danceswithwaves,2009-04-03 09:47:00,17,So your telling me you need a passport to use the chunnel from england.
1093907,Chad711,2009-04-03 18:27:00,11,"I also sent for mine today. Not happy about doing it but I guess I need it... $110 total for the passport, that included a picture. I'll be in Canada alot this winter, I hope this speeds it up. Seems like they are really tightening up right now."
1094399,Obabikon,2009-04-05 19:25:00,2370,"Not meaning to be confusing... I have two different opinions... As a resort owner, I don't like them, because they will affect traffic, which in turn affect business. Maybe not much, but some. As a citizen, I'm for them. I cross the border often, and love the idea of less wait/more efficiency. I was born in Rainy River, and have dual citizenship."
1092327,Dan G,2009-03-30 10:30:00,31,"If you are not fond of paying the price for a passport....or similar document, then don't travel anyplace...sheesh."
1092362,Guest,2009-03-30 11:39:00,0,"I'm not fond of paying fees either, or as an American, having to be registered to enter my own FREE country. What is the purpose of this again? Will this stop drug dealers or terrorist from entering this country?"
1092377,Nimstug,2009-03-30 12:19:00,2605,"...nor does it prevent smuggling drugs into Canada, say, maybe hidden in the top cover of a trolling motor. Guest, by your own words, you have perfectly described the value of a passport...from anywhere in the world you are able to return to this free country. Nimstug"
1092390,Guest,2009-03-30 12:55:00,0,"<value of a passport...from anywhere in the world you are able to return to this free country So, What you are saying is that with a passport and being registered, makes you a good person? Fit to return to your own country? That makes no sense. Papers Please!!"
1092393,Guest,2009-03-30 13:02:00,0,"Other than to get $115 from us, I don't see the benefit. Now, I am a good citizen and already got mine. Just don't like it much."
1092418,Nimstug,2009-03-30 14:07:00,2605,"Since the 1920's, a passport has been used to prove citizenship. Nothing more, nothing less. I said nothing about a passport proving someone is a 'good' person. If you don't like what you think a passport represents and / or don't like the cost, here are your choices:1. Work to repeal passport laws. 2. Don't get a passport, either the full blown or the card version. NimstugNever get in a battle wits with someone who is unarmed."
1092476,v-bay gord,2009-03-30 16:38:00,3168,"There is another choice: 3. Show up at the border and express your displeasure to the officials regarding the passport issue. Claim due to your special significance, and what should be obvious that you are neither a terrorist, or a drug dealer, that you are just wanting to re-enter the land of the free. Then sit back, smile, and be prepared to be either: pepper sprayed, or tazzered. Problem solved!!!"
1092626,Dan G,2009-03-31 03:53:00,31,"Lost in all of this discussion is that this is a U.S.A. requirement!!! Canada still does not require you to have a passport to ENTER Canada....nor will you after June 1. You will be welcomed into the country with the normal proof of citizenship documents...a driver's license and birth certificate typically. But, after June 1, don't count on getting back into our FREE country via the U.S. Customs crossing.You can complain as much as you want here...but, if you want to travel outside of the United States to ANY location....the law after June 1 is very clear...you MUST have a passport or other suitable documents. If you don't like this....then appeal to your legislators to change the law. It's not like you haven't had time to argue this matter. The whole process has been delayed several times...but I firmly believe that June 1 is it...there will be no further delays. So, either get your passport, or stay home. You live in a FREE country...you still have CHOICE!"
1092939,danceswithwaves,2009-03-31 18:56:00,17,One can also cross the border at will on Rainy Lake and say screw the passport mania like the locals do.
1092945,SSA,2009-03-31 19:19:00,19,"Many of the locals to the border towns have passports already. Just as I do, when the rule comes into effect we want to be able to go across into the USA with out any problems to shop, vacation, or whatever it may be."
1091293,Seanik,2009-03-26 12:29:00,218,"I applied for my U.S. passport today and it was a simple and easy process that took about a 1/2 hour. The total cost was 115.00, 75.00 for the State Dept. and 40.00 for the Post office processing and picture fee's. They said 4-6 weeks before you get it. It's a good idea to call the post office for a passport appointment. This is another step getting us closer to our planned Aug. fishing trip to Lac Achepabanca, 65 miles Northeast of Senneterre, Quebec."
1091369,Larry Mac,2009-03-26 15:52:00,530,"Hi Seanik, I took the last of our group for his passport last Saturday. As you said we made an appointment. Everything was quick and painless. He was very happy.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1091439,Rayburn36,2009-03-26 20:02:00,17,as long as the gas stays cheap us canadians will keep crossing with passports. most people I know already have one you need to fly onto the US now anyways.
1091573,Guest,2009-03-27 11:13:00,0,I wonder if those who smuggle drugs into this country will get passports?
1091577,Obabikon,2009-03-27 11:23:00,2370,Depends if they're crossing at a border check or cutting a hole in the fence...
1091921,fishinnut,2009-03-28 18:16:00,642,Here's a little reminder to you first time passport users. SIGN THE PASSPORT! I didn't and the custom agent was nice enough to let it go..
1091991,bellbuoy,2009-03-29 04:39:00,490,"If all you are going to do is cross the Canadian border by land, might I suggest the new passport card, which according to the website is only $35. You can't use the card for air travel to foreign countries, you 'll need the full version that can be stamped."
1092075,Seanik,2009-03-29 11:31:00,218,"There is also a processing fee of 25.00 charged by th USPS, so your 1/2 way there to a full book passport."
1092113,Jimmy Jig,2009-03-29 14:31:00,1905,"I just filed for a card Friday, the cost was $25. for the County Recorder and $20. for the State Dept. A total of $45.00. Didn't go to the Post Office!"
1092117,fiker50,2009-03-29 14:37:00,3,I'm not fond of paying the price for the passport.
1090558,Obabikon,2009-03-24 10:22:00,2370,"I think everyone here knows that... However, they make it easier, simpler, and faster to get into Canada than do alternative forms of identification."
1090602,freespoolin,2009-03-24 12:53:00,472,"9/11 happened. The Department of Homeland Security is real, the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative was signed between Canada and the US. Yes there is some cost and inconvenience to getting a passport or some other form of approved identification: NEXUS, FAST, Enhanced ID. But, it's a requirement to travel between Canada and the US so there's no point whining. It's a requirement for June 2009 so just do it."
1090609,AllenW,2009-03-24 13:16:00,11482,"I was kinda deading having to go though all the hoops, finally a couple months ago the wife and I had the day off so we went to get it, wasn't much trouble at all, we got the forms online and had them filled out and copies of our birth certificate before hand and it all went pretty easy.2 years ago we were over 2 hours getting though, if this helps, I'm all for it.Al"
1090640,Jimmy Jig,2009-03-24 14:23:00,1905,"I have been going into Canada for years. I have never had any trouble at either border, Canada or the US. I have never shown anything except a drivers lience. Now things are changing and we will get a Passport Card this year and we will not save time coming back into the US but the law is the law....."
1091029,Dan G,2009-03-25 18:16:00,31,"Even after June 1, I venture that Border Services will still ask for driver's license and birth certificate, or passport....or similar WHTI approved document. This is not a Canadian requirement folks! The requirements have not changed going IN to Canada. But, after June 1, you'd better have a passport to get back to the U.S.A. Lost in all of this concern about having or not having a passport is that ultimately...this is a good thing for everyone."
1091058,danceswithwaves,2009-03-25 19:08:00,17,HELLO!!! Crossborder commerce for people in the Falls refers to Canadiens purchasing in the U.S.
1091067,prov1900,2009-03-25 19:27:00,544,Dan G is exactly right. Passports are a great thing for this country. We needed to do this years ago.
1091073,Obabikon,2009-03-25 19:35:00,2370,"Crossborder commerce isn't a good enough reason to prevent this. Major commerce providers (employees: ie drivers) will get or already have passports. The ""small"" people that live on border towns should get them anyways for speed/efficiency in crossing. (as they cause a large amount of traffic) All that said, I would guess that it is pushed back again, just like it has been all the previous times."
1091152,Dan G,2009-03-26 06:22:00,31,"You said. ""All that said, I would guess that it is pushed back again, just like it has been all the previous times. ""I respectfully differ in that opinion. From what I'm hearing their will be no new deadline set. The process for applying for passports has become streamlined....and the earlier delays in delivery appear to be behind us. So, if anyone is headed north of the border...I suggest gettin' your passport now.Might as well get your fishing license and outdoors card via the 800 number ahead of time too. I did mine that way....was REALLY easy. Got mine in 7 days."
1091207,SSA,2009-03-26 08:41:00,19,"Best thing is to just get the passport. I dont forsee the deadline getting pushed back, but its possible. As I am in the tourism industry here in Canada, I am working as hard as I can to get everyone of my clients and potential clients to get there passports now, so its no issue when the time comes."
1090375,danceswithwaves,2009-03-23 19:09:00,17,"The international Falls locals are now calling the border security the Iron Curtain. Predictions are that what little cross-border commerce there is will virtually stop on June 1 when the Bush era passport mania goes into effect. Mr. Obama tear down this wall is the falls battle cry. Koochiching county is now down to 13,250 people and dropping."
1090380,JDP,2009-03-23 19:21:00,1457,Really...Personally I think passports are the least of the problem.
1090395,Obabikon,2009-03-23 19:51:00,2370,"No need to bring politics into this issue... as ""Mr. Bush"" and ""Mr. Obama"" have little or nothing to do with this. It will probably get pushed back again, just like it has the last 5 or 6 times it's gotten close."
1090403,slugger doug,2009-03-23 20:06:00,15,Last year I got through the border half the time it usually took with using my passport. Explain how this stops commerce.
1090428,Steve of Madison,2009-03-23 21:46:00,230,ME TOO! Way less time to get across than in years with no passport. Why is this such a difficulty for some people? Get a passport and be done with it!!!
1090451,Backwater Eddy,2009-03-24 05:00:00,3871,"Actually the passport effort for our connecting border nations started way back in the early Clinton era. The homeland security concerns only redefined the needs and parameters of what they will institute on June 1. Lots of procrastinators, and I'm one...but the process is simple enough and the sooner we get it done the better. It will streamline entry once it is all said and done. As long as your fallowing the rules, in and out you will go, likely even faster then before."
1090513,Northern Exposure,2009-03-24 08:42:00,29,"Last year the Canadian border agent asked us for drivers license, birth cert., identifacation or passport. I said we have all of that which do you prefer? He said passports if you got them. I handed him everyones passports. As soon as he saw the passport he said ""go through"" without even looking at them. My gut feeling(he seemed more serious than normal) was we were going to get stopped. I believe the passport saved us some time last year. Maybe we wouldn't have been stopped, but as soon as the passports came out the truck window he let us through."
1090529,Wall-i-Lama,2009-03-24 09:15:00,1524,"Last year for us was the quickest ever. 5 mins in, 5 mins out. We all had passports."
1090530,Obabikon,2009-03-24 09:17:00,2370,"Passports are MUCH easier for border officers... as there are 50 different types of drivers licences in the United States. The Canadians are going to force us to have them, but without a doubt, it will make your trip in easier."
1090538,teddi,2009-03-24 09:45:00,349,passports are a us regulation not a canadian one.you do not need a passport to get in to canada from the us only to get home again
