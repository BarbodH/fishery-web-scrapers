1126352,fish 4 fun,2009-08-04 16:53:00,101,"Bushy, We stayed at Scout lake and didnt get up any farther than the bay of islands so I cant give you any specifics for Steamboat north. Steve has some good advise. Our best luck was on the wind swept points as well. I would add that I didn't spend much time working a spot. If we didn't get into them right away we kept moving and eventually found some good concentrations of fish. (It took a couple days) We didn't find many fish on the main lake submerged structure. For the most part we pulled bottom bouncers and spinners. Spinners seemed to outproduce bead w/bare hook or slow death rig. The preference for crawlers or minnows seemed to change from day to day. Most of our fish came out of 4-15 fow. Its great you can spend some quality time with your dad on the water. It doesn't get any better than that. Let us know how you do."
1126413,archer66,2009-08-04 20:36:00,21,"We stayed at Onaway and fished primarily from the Bay of Islands, down South Inlet, South Bay, McKenzie Bay, and out and around Manitoba Point. The walleye are still very scattered and we found them in depths ranging from 7-25 foot but mostly around 16 foot. We pretty much stuck to windblown shorelines, reefs near deep water, and islands We stayed in the wind all week with the exception of the last day when we found a concentration of fish in the back of South Inlet in 20 foot of water where the water temp was 68 degrees....most of the week the water temp was 63-65 degrees. What made the fishing tough was that we weren't able to find a spot where they were stacked up...just a few in each spot then nothing unless we really stuck to the spot and maybe we'd pick up a few more. We caught a LOT of 12 inch fish and even more 18-25 inch fish and had a bit of trouble finding enough 14-18 inchers to eat. The good news is the Northern Pike fishing was very good and we padded our meals with them. The weather is cool...blueberries are still green which at this time of year they are often done....so that's an indication of how the season is going. I did talk to some other guests at Onaway who seemed to be catching more Walleye than we were...I imagine that is because they are more experienced at it than I am. This was only my second trip to Lac Seul since the late 1980's so I'm a newbie while some of the folks we talked to have been there 10+ years in a row. One report I got was that chartuese jigs tipped with minnnows were very effective. I tried that for part of a day but my inexperienced wife, 16 year old son, and 11 year old daughter weren't able to master jig fishing so we went back to trolling spinner rigs with bottom bouncers."
1126491,bushy,2009-08-05 07:54:00,17,Thanks for the advise guys. For the most part I just hope for good weather compared to what is has been. This will be our 4th straight year going up and the fishing has been real good. Dad is now 82 so don't know when it will be the last. Will report when we get back.
1126495,fishingMN4eyes,2009-08-05 08:13:00,109,"Giving it one more shot to see if this catches anyone's eye. We are leaving tonight and just hoping to get some quick info out of the Chamberlain Narrows area. I'm not too worried about catching fish, but a good starting point on presentation would be helpful....."
1126633,J.Iverson,2009-08-05 17:03:00,64,"We just returned from Mahkwa on lac Seul Aug 1st. They are definately scattered and not as concentrated as they usually are this time of year. Archer is spot on with his advice, it worked for us as well. The action was slower than what we are used to up there, but there was still plenty of catching done by my wife and kids. I think our gear is finally dry! The stable weather will probably treat you better. Have fun."
1126760,Guest,2009-08-06 06:46:00,0,"I hope this catches you before taking off for Chamberlain Narrows. I just returned from 8 days of fishing on and above Chamberlain. The weather was cold and rainy but the walleye and Musky fishing didn't seem to suffer. For some reason, bass and northern were tougher to catch this year than I have seen in 10+ years, we'd catch a few hours of good northerns but then they'd completely shut off - same with the bass. The walleye fishing was different for us this year b/c the water temp was at 63.5 degrees - we are used to the water temp being around 67 degrees the last week of July. This meant our usual spots were not as productive as years past but we changed gears and pulled out 3-5 trophy's per day. Interestingly enough, most of the trophy's were caught in 12-15 ft of water on shad raps, unusual for us since late July usually means fishing between 20-30 ft of water. A nice surprise with targeting 12-15 ft of water was the number of accidental musky - we caught 4 musky between 40-45 inches and one at 48.5 inches. Out of the 5 musky caught, 3 were either caught on a #7 shad rap or similar sized crankbait. The other two were caught at dusk 10+"" musky baits. The weather was strange for us, hopefully it normalizes for you. Try the regular spots to start, if unsuccessful, keep moving and trying different things until something works. Too many fish and good spots for nothing to work - just need to find the pattern and execute."

1128007,fishingMN4eyes,2009-08-11 10:22:00,109,"Got back yesterday evening from another awesome trip to Lac Seul. Went to the Chamberlain Narrows area from Thursday-Sunday. Thursday we went to Wapesi Bay and caught a ton of fish for only about half a day of fishing. We fished the Three Sisters Reef area on Friday and had decent luck on some spots around there, but the action wasn't as good as Wapesi. Then we went to Scaler Lake on Saturday and fished the main island there as that's all there really is to fish there. We caught a ton of fish there too and they were really nice sized fish too! Scaler produced alot of slot fish which were fun to catch and Scaler produced the most 16-17"" walleyes that were perfect for take homes. Then we had some slight motor troubles so we stayed close to camp on Sunday and went out to the Three Sisters area again and fished the same spots we did on Friday. Those spots prodeced better fish than the other day I would say. We had the best luck making drifts and passes along islands. Mid-lake structures didn't seem to be holding as many fish. We were told that the walleyes hadn't really moved out into the main lake as it has been a really cool summer for them. The baits of choice were minnows and crawlers and we even caught plenty of fish on Gulp minnows. There seemed to be no preference on crawlers or minnows. Both seemed to work at almost all times. We didn't buy any leeches because we were told minnows were the way to go. We tried some Gulp leeches and had very little success on those. Jig heads were basically the only tackle we used. The main color was chatruse(spelling??) or some mixture of that. Almost any bright color seemed to produce fish. We tried Lindy Rigs and I caught fish on it, but the fish seemed to be attacking it and they would have in inhaled deep in their throats when I got them in the boat. It was no fun to do minor surgery on the poor things every time I reel one in. So it's not to say Lindy Rigs won't produce fish, it was just difficult to release them sometimes. Like, I stated earlier, we fished mostly off of islands and we caught fish in and where from 10-27 fow. We would make some drifts that would start out in about 17 fow and we would be ready to give up on the drift when we hit 25 or 26 fow and all of a sudden we would start catching fish again. We had beautiful weather and had almost no wind while we were up there. It was almost too nice as we could have used a little wind to push some water around and use the wind to make drifts, but you won't hear me complain about not having wind as it was great for boat control and staying on structure. Great trip for us and good luck to anyone going up there any time soon as we thought the fishing was top notch as usual!"
1122344,fish 4 fun,2009-07-20 09:21:00,101,Our group is heading up to Lac Seul this Saturday. For awhile I wasn't sure that it would happen. We were scheduled at Fisherman's Cove in one of the cabins that no longer exists. Scout Lake lodge thankfully was able to accommodate us. Does anyone have any current tips and reports they would like to share? Thanks.
1122405,WalleyeWally28,2009-07-20 13:05:00,298,fish 4 funI sent you a PM.
1122456,archer66,2009-07-20 16:35:00,21,"I'll be at Onaway starting Friday the 24th. I talked to Kathy at Onaway and she said fishing had been tough this week as they had experienced some ""unstable"" weather....an understatement if ya ask me!! Anyway she said she'd still been dumping full fishgut buckets at the fish cleaning house all week so it must not be too bad. Can't wait to get there...been waiting 4 years since my last trip. Sometime over the years I hope to make this an annual trip...maybe when my kids grow up and move out."
1122475,archer66,2009-07-20 17:29:00,21,Hey Walleyewally ...check your PM.
1122494,WalleyeWally28,2009-07-20 18:28:00,298,Archer66 - check your PM.
1126048,WalleyeWally28,2009-08-03 14:37:00,298,"Heading for LS this Friday. Any current reports out there?archer66, fish 4 fun and rather-be-fishin check your PMs."
1126056,fish 4 fun,2009-08-03 15:04:00,101,Our group got back last Thursday (July 30th). We fished 4 days and it rained every day. Our group found the fishing to be tougher than it normal. As others have said it seemed that the fish were scattered. We did eventually find a couple of spots that had concentrations of fish like we are used too but it took us awhile to find them. I hope the weather straightens out for everyone. I didn't have my rain gear off once in the boat for four days.
1126241,fishingMN4eyes,2009-08-04 08:47:00,109,"Hey guys, first time poster here. I am heading up Wednesday night to arrive at Lac Seul Thursday morning and I was wondering if anyone had any fishing information out of the Chamberlain Narrows area. Any report, advice, or tips would be much appreciated. We have been going to Lac Seul for the past 5 or 6 years now. Can't remember the exact number of years because we have had so much fun and so many fish that they all kind of gel together in my memory. So since we have been there the past few years we know what we think will be decent fishing spots from years past but it would be nice to know what they are biting on most prevelently, depths, etc. Thanks in advance for anyone who replies to my post."
1126251,bushy,2009-08-04 09:39:00,17,"Fish 4 fun, I am leaving for Ear Falls area this Friday with my 82 yr old Dad. Would you care to give me any info on what area you found your best fishing. Farthest we go though is south end of Steamboat. Don't have a real big boat. Thanks"
1126330,Steve of Madison,2009-08-04 15:35:00,230,"For you guys heading up soon, the best advise I can give you is to be flexible, think through the conditions and be ready to try anything.I found fish anywhere there were weeds and a soft shoreline, that means sandy beaches, reeds and a gentle slope to deeper water. NOW that said, I could be way off base by the time you arrive. We are going to have some hot weather here in WI for this week, but who knows what it will be like on LS. Hot weather for an extended period will make the fish move to mid-lake humps and the wind will push the baitfish around to windswept points. When we were there in mid-july the water temps were mid to low 60's, I looked for backwater bays with soft bottoms where the water temp was nearer to high 60's to 70.But we found fish, they are feeding, you may have to backtroll, jig, slip-bobber anything to get them to bite. My advise, stay flexible and try different tactics and depths all the way from 4' to 20' until you find them."
