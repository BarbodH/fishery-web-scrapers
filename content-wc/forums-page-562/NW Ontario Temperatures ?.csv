1128006,Guest,2009-08-11 10:19:00,0,"8 day trip, fly in, last part of July, NE of Ft. Francis about 150 miles. I packed shorts; wish I'd taken long johns; wore the same pair of jeans all week. One day I think I wore all the clothes I took up there under my rainsuit. Been going up there for 25 years, by far the coldest and most windy. 6 out of 8 days: cold- highs in the upper 50's low 60's, windy all week - 10-25 mph winds all day and all night, drizzly rain - off and on all week. Didn't see blue sky between Mon-Fri. Fire in the wood stove every day and night. 2 days sunny, about 65-70, windy. Fishing was great when we braved the whitecaps to find a protected spot; out in the open wind would blow the boat all over the lake; even with anchor (large bag of rocks weighing about 25 lbs). Every walleye we caught (lots of them) was right on the botton in 15-20'. Leadhead jig w/minnow or leach. Could have left the rest of the tackle box home. Outfitter said he's given up on his garden for the year; too cold and wet. Flight in to the lake was by FAR the roughest I've been on. Winds slammed us up/down, sideways for over an hour. Hopefully things have changed since then, if not, dress warm and take a good rainsuit."
1128156,Glenman12,2009-08-11 19:49:00,762,We go to Canada the 1st or 2nd week of June...in the past 25 years we've been in shorts and a tee shirt all week..we've been in winter clothing all week and we've been in raingear all week...and every combination in between..dont trust long range forecasts because apparently they are as bad as forecasting the weather in Canada as they are in the US

1127431,way2goofy,2009-08-09 08:54:00,22,Our group is heading up next week to LOTW's. I was wondering what the temperatures have been running for highs and lows the last 2 weeks. I'm betting pack everything from shorts to snow gear. If you reply - Thank You in advance.
1127472,elmo,2009-08-09 12:56:00,43,Just back and the day temps would be in the low to mid 60's one day maybe close to 70. Night was in the low 50's to high 40's Rain and windy.
1127480,micropterus,2009-08-09 13:44:00,450,Try www.theweathernetwork.comHas a 14 day forecast
1127510,hogridnfool,2009-08-09 17:54:00,349,"Also, Environment Canada and Accu-weather. I usually print out all three forecasts before I go and then get totally different weather from what was forecasted when I get there. In other words, be prepared for anything."
1127596,Skywagon,2009-08-10 06:26:00,1106,"It has been cooler than normal all summer, but the big issue has been rain. There has been rain in the forecast most days all summer and it has rained a number of those, not large quantities, but it has been persistant. Bring good rainwear, a cheap poncho won't cut it. If anyone did not fish in the rain this year, up to this point, they did not do much fishing."
1127628,Larry Mac,2009-08-10 08:46:00,530,"We arrived back home Sunday 8/9/09 from Northwest Ontario. We experienced the same as stated by elmo. If you are heading up North please take Skywagons advice. We had raingear on all week. The walleyes were scattered everywhere. We caught walleye in 8' to 28' FOW. Have a great trip.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1127767,Catman59,2009-08-10 15:25:00,345,Amen -- cold and rainey ............. Very well put.
1127771,wkochevar,2009-08-10 15:51:00,1,Just returned Saturday from a week up there. Cool and rainy most of the week. The lake we were on gained nearly 8'' of water level while we were there. Unbelievable!! Fishing was remarkably good once you found them....as Larry indicated they were scattered all over the place.Good Luck!
1127851,rockpt,2009-08-10 19:48:00,589,"Just returned from a nine day trip to LOTW and it was the coldest summer trip I can remember in 20 years. One of the cabins in camp had a fire burning for part of the week and we burned our Coleman lantern for heat. Pretty windy and wet, too."
1127951,Steve of Madison,2009-08-11 07:14:00,230,"I wonder how the environmentalists are explaining this summer in the context of global warming........or is this just ""normal cycles""."
