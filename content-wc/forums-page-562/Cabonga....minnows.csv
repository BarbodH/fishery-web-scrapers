1128954,cnydave,2009-08-15 06:33:00,33,"Iam looking to bring some salted minnows into Canada (quebec) the first week in Sept.... Does any one have a good way of preserving them for a few days of fishing. The lodge we stay at does not have live minnows so i thought it best to try and just salt my own...I have had pretty good luck with using minnows up there, but it is getting harder and harder to find live minnows up there....Any help would be gratly appreciated.....Thank you , cnydave..."

I just put some live or fresh minnows in a plastic bag, add some pickling salt to mostly cover, shake up the bag a bit, and freeze. That's it. I have even used a bag and then refroze and used the minnows again, and they were still usable. I do feel there is a size of bait ""point of no return""issue, whereas large chubs, for example, would develop a mushy belly. Preserving large bait would first require placing salt into the water they are swimming in to get the salt into their innards. You might try a bag, as suggested above, and then thaw it out before you go, to see if the results are what you envision. Bill Krejca"

1128995,McQ,2009-08-15 10:29:00,615,"A message for all coming into Quebec for fishing. Live minnows are restricted in the interior and over the past year some of the fishing zones have banned preserved minnows (including packaged) too because of the VHF problem. Best to check with your host to be sure there won't be any problems. There are some areas that allow trapping and fishing with minnows as long as they come from that lake, adds to the confusion I guess. McQ"
