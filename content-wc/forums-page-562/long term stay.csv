1126953,Guest,2009-08-06 19:16:00,0,Hi. after I retire my wife and i were thinking of renting a cabin on a lake for the 3 summer months around lake of the woods or lac saul. will i need any special permit to stay that long in the country with my vehicle and boat. I am from chicago so there is a possibility that we would travel home once or twice during the summer. if we did that the boat would stay in canada till the end of summer. any thoughts?

You can take the test on the internet. there must be a post somewhere on this site that can give you information about it"

Tackleman is correct on the boaters card. You can take the exam here: boaterexam.com"

The only thing you need to do is stop at Canadian customs and get a boat permit (free) that is affixed to your boat. You do not need to have any special visa or anything like that to stay the summer in Canada. It is all pretty painless. If you have any other questions just PM me. Congrats on your pending retirement.

The only glitch about the boat is that ""legally"" you cannot leave the boat in the country without being there with it. It has been rumored that people have done this in the past, without anyone knowing it and it worked out fine. If you are still looking for a cabin to rent long term, I may know of a situation, PM and I can expound."
