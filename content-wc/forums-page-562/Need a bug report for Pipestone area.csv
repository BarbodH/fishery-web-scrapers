1126585,Jig Man,2009-08-05 14:25:00,95,How bad are the BLACK FLIES and MOSQUITOES this year with all the rain they have been getting? Heading up to the Pickle Lake area in about a week. The last two years we hardly had to break out the bug spray.
1126649,Guest,2009-08-05 17:50:00,0,May I ask which resort you will be staying at and what species targeting? As for bugs....don't know the report right now but can easily make a call to someone that has been up to Clearwater 3-4 times already this year and just as of last week.

1127321,lenray,2009-08-08 17:42:00,467,Hi Paul yeah Snow for sure. Also I fished everyday with my ole farmer Carharts on. Takes a mighty big and potent bug to bite thru that stuff. I am not the best dressed fella on da water. I see the pics of you Keystoners and the Hawkeye bunch--mighty fine duds you wealthy guys are wearing. Take care you going to half century of progress in Rantoul??? len
