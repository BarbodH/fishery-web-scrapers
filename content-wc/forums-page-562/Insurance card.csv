1126335,alanexpup,2009-08-04 15:47:00,278,I guess thats why it nice to pull your boat up to canada- its hard to speed-for me anyway.
1126362,Jimmy Jig,2009-08-04 17:37:00,1905,My State Farm agency said the card issued to me will work fine in Canada or the USA. In Iowa it is law that the card be carried in the vehicle at all times. Some states do not have coverage cards and would need something for Canada.
1126858,eyecrosser,2009-08-06 13:09:00,12,"We will be traveling from Kansas to Lake Herridge,Ont. and sharing the drive. If behind the wheel of someone else's vehicle do you need your own card or will the owner's card suffice? Thanx in advance and tight lines to all, eyecrosser"
1126878,2746,2009-08-06 14:47:00,3206,"Actually we were pulling a boat. Sitting there enjoying the scenery and talking up a storm and NOT watching the speedometer! Oh well, the first one in over 50 trips.....guess it was bound to happen. Some other fishermen were following us and watched the stop. We met up with them later at 4 seasons and they said it was good we were first or it would have been them he got. You can bet your life I'll be more careful this year."
1127034,Dacotah Eye,2009-08-07 08:46:00,2722,Interesting thread. I haven't been to Canada for a while and I don't think a Canadian card was required the last time I was in Canada. At least my agent said it wasn't. I just called my agent and they are going to send me one for my pickup and one for the boat which probably isn't necessary.
1127576,fishforlife,2009-08-09 23:55:00,77,"I just talked to my ins. co. and was told I did not have to have a ""special card"" while there, just my regular Ohio ins. coverage card. I had taken a special card previous 5-years."
1127601,JAY221,2009-08-10 07:01:00,877,"I don't know if the standard Iowa card will be good enough but I do know that they have a different yellow card certifying that you are legal in Canada. It cost nothing extra through our insurance agent. Later, Jay"
1125807,ole timer,2009-08-02 15:18:00,34,A co-worker told me his agent said that a special Canadian proof of insurance card is now required to drive your US vehicle in Canada. Anyone else heard of this?
1125816,JayM5209,2009-08-02 15:45:00,1050,"Yes, and it has been for some time. Your insurance agent's office should have them at the receptionist's desk. They fill it out and it takes about 1.5 minutes. The one I have is called ""Canada Non-resident Inter-province Motor Vehicle Liability Insurance Card."" It serves as proof of liability insurance at the required levels in every province in Canada. ""Don't leave home without it.""If you have multiple vehicles insured, make sure the card specifically identifies the one you are driving to Canada."
1125830,WalleyeWally28,2009-08-02 16:26:00,298,I've been fishing Canada for the last 13 years and have taken a special proof of insurance card every year. My insurance company (State Farm) told me it was required. I just call my agent every spring and he mails it to me.
1125878,alanexpup,2009-08-02 19:55:00,278,been going to canda for over 30 years and have never had one or asked for one at the border.
1125893,Jimmy Jig,2009-08-02 20:45:00,1905,I have State Farm insurance and I have never had anything special to go into Canada. Been doing a trip or two every year for 35 years.....Never been asked either.
1125901,5thsuit,2009-08-02 21:19:00,54,"Drive a little faster or get in an accident and they will ask for it. I got to show mine in June, just south of Ear Falls. I promise to drive slower next year. Luckily the HR dept of the company I work for sent a memo out last fall informing me of this requirement for driving in Canada."
1125904,SkeeterJeff,2009-08-02 21:24:00,31,"I was ticketed for speeding on the way home yesterday just north of North Bay. Gave 'em my State Farm insurance card and no problem. This is the first year I didn't get proof of insurance from my agent, and the first time I've been stopped. Nice officer wrote it up lower than I was running, so fine was less and no points. Jeff"
1125905,Rich B,2009-08-02 21:25:00,1081,"5th Suit is right......get in an accident (doesn't matter who causes the accident) and you will need to show an insurance card (documenting that you carry valid auto liability insurance). It's my understanding that if you don't have a Canadian Insurance card for proof of insurance, your vehicle/boat/rig gets impounded until they (Canadian police) have written documentation/proof from your insurance agency or auto insurance company. I've been traveling up north since the early 80s and never been asked for an insurance card at the border, but have heard that if you're stopped for a traffic violation or an accident; you better have a valid insurance card. Should be no cost to anyone to get one from their insurance agency......if there is, you probably need to get another agent (ha). Good luck......I wouldn't go north of the border with out my Canadian insurance card. Rich B"
1126262,2746,2009-08-04 10:13:00,3206,I've never carried such a card (50 + trips) but never had an accident either. Was picked up last year for speeding south of Ear Falls (tough to stay at 55 on that nice road so watch it) and the Mountie asked for proof of insurance but seemed ok with my regualr US issued card from my company. Cost me $60 for the ticket but he nicely explained that had he fined me for my actual speed it would have been $300!
1126269,Golden Eagle,2009-08-04 10:48:00,2642,Is there an insurance company writing in the U.S. that does not include coverage while driving in Canada? I don't know of one. A U.S. policy does not provide coverage while operating your vehicle in Mexico.
