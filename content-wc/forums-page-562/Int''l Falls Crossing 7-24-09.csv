1127420,Kevin R,2009-08-09 08:15:00,305,15 boats on one point this past thursday evening on Perrault lake busy week. Lots of people out on vacation.
1127421,Mark R,2009-08-09 08:18:00,1538,Hey Joe what time did you get to the border when you had to wait 2 hours?
1127442,Skywagon,2009-08-09 09:58:00,1106,"We had friends that got to Ft Frances heading south, at 10:30 am yesterday (Saturday) and waited 1 1/2 hours to cross into the US. Always best to cross before 6:00 am or later in the day on Saturday, this time of the year to avoid the wait."
1127529,joeman79,2009-08-09 19:09:00,417,11 a.m Dave said it was 1 hr and 40 minutes. Was backed up past Tim Hortons
1127549,Glenman12,2009-08-09 20:37:00,762,"He asked that next time I not bring so much Rum and Vodka and stick to the beer. Anyone understand this statement"" my only guess is that he was giving you a tip on how to save on paying so much duty on hard liquor.."
1127560,SinOrSwim,2009-08-09 21:36:00,1528,Hey trapperjohn. If you didn't tell them you had the booze then they probably thought you only had 2 cases of beer. You can take one case per person without paying. You are probably lucky they didn't pull you over to check. Even though it was probably an honest mistake you are suppsed to tell them everything you are bringing and let them tell you what is owed.
1127631,trapper_john,2009-08-10 08:57:00,83,I did tell them that we had two bottles from the duty free store. The border inspecter even smiled. A totaly new exeperince for us.
1127658,joeman79,2009-08-10 10:22:00,417,"A week ago saturday night at 7:30p.m. our group of 3 vehicles crossed at Int'l Falls. With 2 vehicles in front of us. My vehicle was first and the little yellow paper appeared and the friendly cute young lady started asking all the questions. I answered all honestly looking her in to her eyes. She smiled handed me the yellow paper and said proceed ahead and pull over in inspecton area please. Vehicle behind me #2 had the same thing happen. My vehicle was inspected we were asked to go inside where the other group was sitting inside. Nothing was found and we were then asked to hand over passports. Then we sat there and sat there and sat there. the 3rd vehicle was allowed to go right thru. at 9 oclock I asked the officer if I could call our friends and have them go check into motel they said no problem. So I called them we were being delayed due to a random inspection and passport check, and to proceed to motel. At 9:30 we were told everything looks good, they handed our passports back and left. 2 freaking hours. They were way under staffed and had several other that came in and paid duty, etc. were waited on in front of us. No one in our party has ever had a DUI or any other kind of felony. Although I was not mad, I was frustrated that it took so long. We were courteous, respectful, and did as were were told. I had my wallet on the dash and everything in cab of truck was checked includng my wallet. So if you get pulled over in the late evening at Int'l falls be ready for a 2 hour nap inside the customs office. I am blaming it on my Walleye Central ""Shut Up and Fish"" Decal on the back window of my topper. LOL"
1123724,tcasica,2009-07-25 06:42:00,14,"Hi All, crossed into Canada at International Falls yesterday at 6:30 pm. Traffic was light 3 cars, 2 boat trailers and a bus when we arrived. Wait was about 5 minutes and the border guard asked the usual questions, checked our passports and documented our alcohol. We had 4-1.75l of Rum and Vodka and 2 cases of Corona ($25 each at the Duty Free shop). Had to pay duty on 5 liters of alcohol and the two cases of beer, cost was $83. The border guard figure the duty made a comment after I paid, which I do not understand. He asked that next time I not bring so much Rum and Vodka and stick to the beer. Anyone understand this statement? Just want to make sure that I'm not over stepping in anyway."
1123788,Golden Eagle,2009-07-25 10:59:00,2642,"Not sure, but I think hard stuff comes at a decent price in Canada and beer costs a lot more than in the U.S. Guy might have been giving you good advice. Trying to save you money? Maybe. Maybe not."
1123803,Northern Manitoban,2009-07-25 12:46:00,195,"I dont understand that comment, hard booze costs a fortune in Canada in the USA its like half the price, i'm usually a beer drinker but because the hard stuff is so cheep in the UA i and the wife usually buy some whisky and Vodka yahoo! can't wait 6 more days"
1123820,Golden Eagle,2009-07-25 13:49:00,2642,I stand corrected.
1123896,Skywagon,2009-07-26 05:49:00,1106,"For what ever it is worth, here at our local LCBO (Dryden area), Crown Royal is about the same price as at the Liquor store in Illinois for a 1.14 liter container (low $40 area). The Duty free store in International Falls has a deal where you get 2 bottles of that same size for $35 (great deal). Miller lite can be had for $15 a case in Illinois, where here, it is $40.50 per case of cans. These are local currency. Manitoba may have different pricing."
1123944,Northern Manitoban,2009-07-26 10:54:00,195,"Booze is priced different every Province, I was just talking with my friend in Sudbury Ontario who moved there last year from Manitoba, he was telling me how expensive Beer is in Ontario, he usually buys his Beer when he is in Quebec as he says its way cheeper, I guess I;ll find out in 2 weeks when i hit Ontario, I know B.C. is very expensive for Beer as well, I pay $23 dollars for a box of 15 Beer in Manitoba"
1124006,Guest,2009-07-26 17:50:00,0,"We just ran into the same thing. We bought Crown Royal and it was about $34 for 1.14L in Canada. It would have cost about the same around home. Beer was close to $40/case and the same beer locally is about $16. We were tight on space so we bought beer up there. Even after paying duty, we would have been ahead about $12-$15/case."
1124067,fishforlife,2009-07-26 23:56:00,77,Anyone know what time the duty free store opens? We will be crossing at the Seault St. Marie early Friday morning.
1124075,Jay Merics,2009-07-27 05:57:00,21,Should be open 24/7
1127104,trapper_john,2009-08-07 15:30:00,83,"A couple of years ago while crossing at IF, we each, wife and I, bought a bottle of booze and a case of beer with the intention of paying the duty on the beer. When we stopped we were asked if we had anything to declare I said yes, a case of beer. The girl doing the asking just said ""ok, have a nice holiday."" Not wanting to step in anything I repeated that we had beer, and again, she said ""that's fine, have a nice trip."" I don't know what it was about but she just let the beer slide."
