1114632,Guest,2009-06-18 09:56:00,0,"Any recent reports regarding walleye activity on the Wabby? Also, where are some of the better spots for mid July walleyes? I have fished the lake several times in the spring with good luck but have not figured out the mid-summer bite. We generally fish with jig/minnow drifting or trolling slowly. Any advice from guys who fish it regularly? Fish the weed edges or reefs?"
1114669,teddi,2009-06-18 11:49:00,349,"there really isn,t a july bite. it slows down big time when the warm weather hits. it,s good again in september into fall."
1114722,wildernessgum,2009-06-18 14:37:00,19,"Big Mike is a regular Wabby guy he posted this last week. I have been there the past several years in July and each year is defferent depending on the weather. Last year cooler similar to this year had better luck in and along weeds. A couple of the resorts on the lake post weekly fishing reports on their websites. tallpinescamp.com and www.peffleyscamp.com Wabaskang 6/6-6/12 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mad it back from my first trip of the year. The first trip is always much anticipated and cannot get here soon enough, but seems to go by the fastest! That holds true once again this year as it seemed like the week flew by, even with somewhat crappy weather. The water temps were relatively cool ranging from 50 degrees in the morning to 53 by the late afternoon. I thought this would spell doom to any hopes of catching big northerns on jerkbaits and crankbaits, but luckily I was surprised at the aggressiveness of these fish this week. We landed 5 over 40"" with a pair above 43"". The key was very slowly retreiving the bait with many slow pauses and also slow trolling below 2 mph. There are very few weeds with the cool water temps and high water, so any area that had even the slightest weed growth starting to come up was the ticket. Areas on your graph that looked like shag carpet were areas we found our big fish. The large clumps and even strands of cabbage aren't anywhere to be found as of yet. Walleyes were caught quite easily, and everywhere throughout the lake system. Many boats were fishing west of gawley's bay, along the opening of the big lake, close to the reservation, ruby bay, and keynote. It didn't matter where, the walleyes seemed to cooperate. The best catches were on small jig/minnow combos and slip bobbers fished still with a minnow. One group of guys just pounded them with this little used approach. When the fish are still a little lethargic the slip bobber keeps it right in front of them. Finally, the bass where just starting to get going by the middle of the week. The males are starting to show up near the bedding areas with females also lingering out in 5 to 8 feet water close by. We had a 19 and several 18's over the last few days on everything from topwater, to spinnerbaits, to tubes. They were truly a blast to catch and release! Well, after 5 straight nights of fish frys my body needs a break and its back to work for a few weeks and then back up north for another good week (hopefully). It was tough to leave wabaskang camp after this trip especially the way the bite is starting to set up. My buddy just called"

We had our best luck in the bay to the left of the red cabin(the one with the large reef/rock that goes out75 feet or better straight out past the first island after the first narrows. Later, Jay"
1114776,Guest,2009-06-18 18:34:00,0,"Thanks for the feedback guys. Look forward to heading up to paradise again this year. This trip will be the most special one I've had. My fiance and I are getting married on the Wabaskang. If you see a bride and groom out on an island in the middle of July, it will be us!"
1114779,Guest,2009-06-18 18:40:00,0,"Teddi is not far from being accurate about the bite slowing down in July...however I have had several trips where we caught as many and bigger walleyes than in the end of August. One of the nice things about July is that the walleyes are still scattered over several areas so you can fish alot of places and not have others jigging next to you the whole time like in the fall on Devil's, Doe, and other places commonly fished in the fall. When I go up in July I primarily fish the reefs with a jig/minnow. Locate pods of fish and fish them for awhile until they quit biting and leave for another spot. Unlike fall fishing these spots tend to produce only for short periods and then are done. Next I will fish the weedlines with a lindy/minnow or a spinner/crawler harness. This works really well as far as covering ground and seems to put nice fish in the boat all summer long. Finally anyone who knows me has seen me fish open water with crankbaits. I love open water trolling and summer is the prime time to do this. Fish the same areas you would jig fish in the fall but troll around them instead. One last piece of advice...get up early. The best walleye bite in my opinion in July is between 5:30 am and 8:30 am. Once the sun gets up it seems to shut down, unless you've got clouds. Jig fish first, then go to the lindys/spinners rest of the day. Good luck, I'll have a report after my next trip after the 4th of July."
1114872,Guest,2009-06-19 05:58:00,0,"Mike, I appreciate your feedback. My problem is that I have fished the lake mostly in the spring and done well casting towards the bank with a jig and minnow. We never spent much time trying to locate any reefs because the fish are shallow that time of year. Can you put me in the vicinity of a few? My email address is [email protected]"
1115100,Kevin R,2009-06-20 06:22:00,305,"They bite fine for me durring the day even better than most would think. I have been up early & they bite good then, but when the sun is high they still bite. Last year I caught so many over 25"" it was like nothing I have ever seen before & they were hitting anything I tried. The change in limits has helped so much it is amazing how the fishing has come back."
1126368,trapper_john,2009-08-04 17:58:00,83,"We were at King fisher last July and had great luck with Walleys. It was very windy all week and we just looked for a rocky point that the wind was blowing on. Such as the yellow cabin. We vert. jigged with a crawler, starting at about 12 feet and worked up to about 5. It was hard to control the drift with the wind and waves but the Walleys loved it. Hammered um. In the evening the SM Bass were in the first narrows. Many many and nice sizes. No perch though, and only hammer handle Pike. We are looking to go back next June..Family thing............."
1129175,Larry Mac,2009-08-16 15:01:00,530,"Hi MartyT, Very nice report, I am glad to hear you and yours had a very nice time. We actually target those 15"" to 16"" walleyes for eating. Man, are they good!!!! The day you talked about going to the ""walk in"" catch and release lake sounded like a very special day (42 walleyes of which 35 were 18"" or better). I bet the kids had a great time and will remember that ""honey hole"" for many years to come. Thanks for the report.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1129173,MartyT,2009-08-16 14:31:00,23,"A bit late, I suppose, but we were at Peffley's Camp on Wabaskang from July 25 to Aug 1. Family trip (wife and 12 / 9 year old kids), their first time to Canada. Weather was cool and cloudy almost every day, with quite a bit of rain. Water temps were far below normal and even in the last week of July, the mayfly hatch was in full swing. So the odds were against us.Given that we were all fishing in one boat and limited somewhat in the techniques we could use (they didn't have the patience for a lot of backtrolling), we still managed to have a great trip. Daytime walleye were non-existant for us, but we went to the ""Hotel"" every evening from about 8 to 9:30 or so and caught 20 to 40 jig-and-a-minnow walleyes each night, all of them small but darned good eating. Daytime found us fishing for perch at several spots and we didn't have any trouble catching lots and lots of nice big perch. Spent very little time casting for pike but caught a few here and there, all small. Lost Lake is Peffley's private ""walk-in"" catch & release lake and we spent one day there - our 4 dozen minnows were gone in 4 hours, and we boated 42 walleyes, only 7 of which were less than 18 inches. Non-stop action that I could barely keep up with (being the chief baiter and fish-taker-off'er).Everybody in camp that week caught plenty of fish to eat and took home there limits, but I didn't hear or see any reports of lunker-size walleye; most folks were struggling to catch 16""-17"" fish to take home. One group in camp took home a full limit of perch (200), walleye, smallies and pike.The constant theme up there this year seems to be the abnormal weather conditions and the subsequent abnormal fishing patterns. I've been watching the weekly fishing reports on Peffley's Camp website and they all sound about the same since we were there - cool, wet weather; difficult daytime bite but still enough fish to eat and take home."
