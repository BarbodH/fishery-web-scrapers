1127540,buzzard9311,2009-08-09 20:01:00,6,looking to find info on where monkey rock or bird poop rocks are located at deer horn lodge? i read some other post about the cabonga reservoir and these two spots were mentioned a couple times. i have been going there for about 7 years now and this is the first that i have heard of these spots. i fish mostly barriere lake as the fishing there is great but am looking for a few new spots to try on the cabonga.also i will be at deer horn starting aug.31st and was wondering if anyone has fished there this late in the season and any help would be great.we always go in the spring but not this year.
1127578,Guest,2009-08-10 03:02:00,0,Monkey rock (a large boulder that teeters at the waters edge) is at the far side of Van Geason lake within Cabonga. Its a common structure used to mark the entrance to Burns Bay. No spot burning here as anyone who has fished deerhorn knows the area. Bird poop rocks are found everywhere on Cabonga due to a large population of gulls and terns.
1127633,joepa,2009-08-10 09:05:00,366,"Buzzard, Do you have a map of Cabonga? If you do, look at where chenal Barriere is (south then east of the lodge.) There will be a pass on the left that leads to Iraquois point, a shallow area, stay to right, bottles marking rocks on the left. When through the pass, look straight ahead and you will see a large rock with bird poop all over the top. Go almost to the rock then go left around the rock. Watch your depthfinder it gets shallow. Continue straight into chenal de Waskega. If you look south (right) down and across the bay, you will see a large boulder (very evident) at the edge of the water that looks like a monkey head. If you go through the channel with monkey rock on your left, stay to the right side, the left gets real shallow. On the map you will see Ile Menard. I believe behind Ile Menard is the channel that leads to where the lake trout are. Ive never been that far. Also, we have only been to Deer Horn once and are going again on August 29th to the 5th of September. We have been to Pavillon Cabonga (lodge on the southern end) several times. We decided to go to Deer Horn from now on because of the reservation and things that weren't good at Pavillon. Fishing the first week in September has been good at times and so so at times. Hope this helps!"

I have fished all over the cabonga with very good success. I have to admit the best fishing is about 2-3 hrs. just before dark and shortly just after dark. Have you ever fished after dark there , it is very good at times. We just troll with jointed rapala's. I have fished that monkey rock area , but have better luck at fox lake . Maybe it was just the right time , I brought my son and his friend up to deer horn and the first fish he caught was a 13.5 lb. walleye. That was the biggest i have seen come out of where we fishing. Have you ever fished the rapids that Steve talks about , and if so how was it. Per Steve the rapids are about 10 mins. from camp by road. Well gotta go , hopefully you or anyone else will respond to this memo....Hope to see up there , can't wait we always give Gary a run for his money.......Take care....cnydave......"
1128089,joepa,2009-08-11 16:12:00,366,"cnydave, We are just learning about the area around Deer Horn. We stayed at Pavillon Cabonga several years and know that area well. I have heard about the rapids but have never been there. I often thought about fishing at night but when the lights go out up there they really go out! Always afraid of the rocks, you know the ones that sneak up on you in 30 feet of water. Hope to see there. I emailed Steve twice but got no response yet so we don't know what cabin we will be in."
1128626,cnydave,2009-08-13 18:45:00,33,"Joepa.....The area around deer horn is not to bad at night providing you know the area , you can see the camp lights from the boat with no problem. You just need to troll slow along the shore areas along weed lines . The night time is when the best walleyes are caught. We fished them back in a camp called Camichigama about 70 miles back in on the same road that leads to deer horn. We caught some real hogs about 2 hrs. after dark.I fished that area (Pavillion cabonga) a few yrs. back and did not have that much luck. I have been fishing in Quebec for about 30years now , so i have gotten to know the area fairly well. A couple yrs. ago we went up to Labrador to hunt caribou and flew back into camp. We all got our bulls the first couple days , so we were""forced"" to fish the rest of the week. That was some of the best brook/laker fishing i have seen. I also fished the broadback river north of Chibougamo in the asecina preserve . Thats the first time i ever saw 8lb. brookies. I had one mounted and it's over my fireplace. It's a beautifull trophy.I had the same problem getting Steve Hamel's e mails. I know he has some other buisness ventures farthur up north on rt 117 at the Dozois resevoir . I have not fished that camp yet , but due plan to maybe next spring.Hope to see ya on the water at the cabonga at the end of the month! I have 16ft. white Lowe fishing boat, should you see me up there....Tightlines............"
