From what I have heard, fishing in that whole area has been off this year. The guide, Gary, thought the season was running three weeks late. I tend to agree because some of the plants that were blooming are normally finished by the time our week arrives. We also caught more large perch and large chubs with much red in their fins indicating a later spawn. Our fishing was productive, but only in one spot for walleye, many fish in the 18 to 22 inch range. Pike only to 30 inches, some great lake trout for the one run we make for them. Checking Steve's report indicates the rain and multple wind changes have been rough on the fishing this year. I believe if it settles down the fishing will turn on big time. Hope your there when it does."

Looking across the width of the river there, you can only imagine the great fishing that could be in some of the spots you can't reach. We always caught walleye and chubs there but nothing over 18 inches. I'm sure there are times when larger fish are present. If you go, make sure to get downstream a little, there's a great pool that would possibly give you a shot at sturgeon if you put in the time."

I know steve has said the fishing has been off all yr. due to the weather and wind. hopefully it will clear up when we get there , anyways i am sure we will have a great shore lunch. You can always count on catching enough for that.Tightlines !"
