1127170,bpetersen,2009-08-07 21:07:00,251,"I was there several years ago. New owners since then, thank goodness. Cabins were good. If you take your own boat. The docking area is not protected for wind. They had ramps you have to run your boat up onto wood planks and then winch the boat up the rest of the way. I popped several rivets. Ask the owners if this is still their practice."

1127566,bpetersen,2009-08-09 21:54:00,251,"I believe it has been 10 plus years. It has been awhile. Owners names were Norm and Sue but can't remember their last name. Since they are not their anymore, commenting on them would be pointless. I really had no problems with facilities except the docking area but that shouldn't matter using their boat."

Mike and Chris Briesemeister were and still are the owners - they're good people, very friendly and helpful. Nice, clean camp; well-furnished cabins. Boats were basic but in good shape. I didn't like the ramps that they used instead of docks - I slipped and fell on the ramps twice in one day, soaking my only 2 pair of boots... But overall, the accommodations were just fine.The fishing for us was pretty tough though - our first ever trip to Canada and right in the middle of the mayfly hatch in a major drought year. Took us several days to find the walleyes, but eventually got onto some good fishing, back-trolling a crawler harness in about 25 ft of water in the crescent-shaped bay of the island northeast of the lodge by a mile or so - we caught many 18 to 24"" fish with a few bigger ones mixed in. Pike were everywhere and easy to catch, as were the smallies.The one thing about Perrault Lake that I remember is that we generally had to travel a *long* way to get to the ""recommended"" fishing spots (the nearby island was the exception) - and Perrault gets mighty rough on windy days. Most of the time, our long boat rides ended up being just long boat rides - few fish to be found.I booked a family trip this summer (wife and two kids, 12 and 9) and chose to go to Peffley's Camp on Wabaskang Lake (the next lake downstream from Perrault, just on the other side of the highway, about 5 minutes from Rocky Shore Lodge's driveway) instead of going back to Rocky Shore Lodge. Peffley's is actually located about 12 miles out on Wabaskang lake - no roads, you boat-in with all your gear in a nice big Crestliner. Generator runs 24/7 and there's a phone and even wireless internet and hot/cold running water. Very basic cabins - kitchen, table, old couch and old beds with a wood stove for heat.Overall, it was a far more memorable and rewarding experience than my 2006 trip; we fished most days within a 15 minute boat ride from the cabins, had trouble with the mid-day walleye bite but found them in good numbers in the evening and generally had a great time. Peffley's has a private ""walk-to"" catch & release lake, and we caught 42 walleyes in 4 hours (until we ran out of minnows), all but 6 of them were over 18"" in length. It was easily the best day of walleye fishing I've ever seen.So the bottom line is, I found Rocky Shore Lodge to be a nice place to stay but I really liked Peffley's Camp a lot better. If you search around the board for opinions about Perrault Lake, you'll see that a lot of folks don't think the fishing is very good there. And a similar search for Wabaskang will reveal just the opposite. Good luck with your choice!"
