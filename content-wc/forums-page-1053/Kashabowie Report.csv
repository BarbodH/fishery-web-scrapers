The lake is 14 miles long with beautiful senary and the loons are a real bonus to listen to. We caught walleyes to eat, some to bring home as a reminder of how delicious they tasted for our shore lunches, and of course we returned many for our next trip back. We also caught northerns, smalleys, and the lake trout are there also if you are so inclined. The log cabins are very nice they have a toilet, sink and shower, with a fantastic view of the lake, and they were rented per cabin not per person, up to 6 people. The week was $450 Canadian which is about $325 in U.S. dollars so it was a great value. If you want more info e-mail Wally or Sue at [email protected] and they be happy to send you back any info you would like. Tell them Rich & Janet said Hi. I'm sure you will enjoy your stay with them just like we did, good fishing to you. Rich"
