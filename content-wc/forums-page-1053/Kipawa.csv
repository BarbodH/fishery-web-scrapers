Also, if you are familiar with any of the camps, are they located where you can drive to them or do you have to load into a boat to get to them?I have information on the following:Corbeau LodgeKipawa LodgeLandriault OutfittersChalets Scarf"

Gave us the places to go to catch fish and the presentations that work best. Has access to several ""back lakes"" for pike or smallmouth. Caught a lot of fish in unstable weather including a 42"" pike. Bernard and Eunice are great, call them or email them for info. Tell them the Ohio Boys sent you.Good Luck."
509465,Guest,2000-08-22 13:07:00,0,"I'll reiterate Todd's post as I know he had a great week. I think any of those camps will serve well. Are you trying to stay in one part of the lake? Other camps to try farther up the lake from Kipawa would be Taggary Bay Camps (where we go) or 3-Seasons Camp or Smith Bay Camps. There are a couple I would avoid, so if you haven't seen them listed in your list or mine, consider yourself warned or email me if you have others in mind. You can check out Taggart Bay at taggartbay.com; if you email them tell Yves that Mike Miller sent you (I use Kip on the WWW; there's just too many Mikes out there!). If you go, keep in touch with me; if we pool our Kipawa knowledge we'll all have great trips (Ma Nature willing)."
