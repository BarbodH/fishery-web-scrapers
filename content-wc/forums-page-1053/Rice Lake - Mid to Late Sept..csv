Can someone help me out on some good locations for bass and walleye, and what are the best techniques. Also would like to know what the panfishing is like that time of year!! Thanks in advance for your help! If you prefer, you can email me at [email protected]"
509374,oleruff,2000-08-03 19:37:00,23,Mal this is the best time for smallies in this lake! Fish the otanoby river where it meets the main lake using live crawfish and you will score BIG FISH!! Note the small island on right entering the channel of the river FISH JUST UP STREAM ABOUT TEN METERS! OLERUFF
509375,szopster,2000-08-08 16:50:00,48,"For walleyes go up the Otanabe about a mile or so across the river from Rainbow Cottage resort, there is a deep (25-30 ft) hole that runs close to the east shore. Slip the area with jig minnow/jig crawler combos on the bottom. I used 1/4 oz jigs with 6 lb line. You'll catch all the walleyes you want. The current will make most fish will fell like weight or weeds on the line - set the hook - it doesn't cost you anything!Good luck!"

I am assuming you know where the railroad tracks are in the water( you better know or you'll definitely rip a prop off, find out from a local) Anyhow, go to the railway track, at the most southern point of the railway track in the lake there is a channel, and somekind of park where kids play. There is a weedbed there (water is 8-12 ft) fish that for 3-4 hours guaranteed a handful of smallies from 2-5lbs. I used jigs with white power baits and also spinners. There is also a lot a crappie there, pulled out a 1 lb wally there also. Good luck"
