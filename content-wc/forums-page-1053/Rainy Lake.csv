509308,Guest,2000-07-30 16:55:00,0,"I'm interested in others experiences on Rainy Lake. Is the fishing better on the Canadian side or isn't their much difference? Are their different size limits/possession limits across the border? What about traveling into Canadian water while staying at a U.S. lodge?,(I know you would need both fishing licenses). I'm not sure if I want to go thru the added headache of crossing the border if the accomodations & the fishing is just as good here in the U.S. Thanks for sharing your insight!! Marty"
509309,Worm Dunker,2000-08-02 10:09:00,23,"WE fished Rainy about 4 years ago. We used a house boat and only fished the MN side. It was not worth the hassel to fish the Cananda side - limit was one then I think. We had good fishing. We went in July and had good luck on the rock reefs15 to 30 feet. We caught and released alot of slot fish 18 to 25"" I think was the slot then. The house boat was fun - hot tub on the roof - slide into the lake - did not have to travel far to fish and so on. The draw back to us was the cost of gas to fill up when we were done. It was $2.75 per gallon then and I am guessing it will be higher now. We use 175 gallons.Good Luck The Worm Dunker"
509310,Guest,2000-08-08 16:25:00,0,"If your interested in the great fishing experience then Rainy Lake is thee place but if your more worried about take home fish then this isn't the place. There's a reason Rainy Lake is such a great place to fish is because of the regulations. It's alot easier to come over the border by car and stay on this side not to mention cheaper. An american dollar in canada is worth 1.50, I can hook you up with all of this for you.It's not as troublism as some people sa√ΩI lived on Rainy all my life and the fishing is great, the smallmouth bass are all over the place. Walleye are on reefs."
509311,Guest,2000-08-09 19:02:00,0,"Harvey, or anyone else who has fished Rainy Lake, I'm interested in fishing Rainy Lake because of the good fishing reputation the lake has however, I would like to know if it matters on which side of the border you fish. I have fished Basswood Lake near Ely, Minnesota and in my opinion the Canadian side is the better of the two sides although to be fair, motorboats are allowed on the U.S. side in some areas but not on the Canadian side. Less pressure, more fish. I will admit that my family & I do like walleye and I would like to have a meal or two but I don't need to fill a cooler full of fillets to be happy, catching fish is the most fun, eating a few would be great too! Thanks for the info!! Set the hook! Marty"
509312,Guest,2000-08-10 04:21:00,0,"My dad and I fished Rainy pretty regularly 10-15 years ago, but the fishing wasn't that great and so we stopped going. However, we went back two summers ago, and couldn't believe how much better it was. The regulations have really helped. Numbers of fish, and size are both readily available. Sometimes the problem is finding fish in the slot. We have always fished the Canadian side from a fishing camp called Coppins. Luxury it isn't, but clean, with hot running water, and a kitchen. If you don't want to take lots of fish home, which we never do, then the Canadian side is great. We've never had any border hassles, and there are so few boats, we rarely ran into other fisherman in any of the places we want to fish.We're going back there for a long weekend August 19. I'm hoping to hook up with a big Northern this year--I'm due. I'll update then."
509313,Guest,2000-08-12 06:08:00,0,I'll be very interested to hear about your trip. I hope you have good luck and can share a story or two! Marty
509314,Guest,2000-08-22 04:51:00,0,"Just got back from Rainy. It was a short trip, but fishing was good--streaky, but good. Didn't catch as many walleyes as expected until the last spot on the last day. Actually, we went to the wrong spot. We were trying to fiond a rock pile off Dude Island in Swell Bay, and we were having a disagreement about how far up the shore it was. Fortunately I looked down at the depth finder and saw fish stacked up. We threw two markers on the fish and were set up perfectly to back troll into the wind through the markers, then cut the motor and drfited back. The walleyes were on a rocky shelf that went from 22 to 32 and feeding on scholls of bait fish we could see on our depth finder. In the next 2 hours we boated 23 walleyes. No size, but lots of fun. On one of them, I had a huge northern hanging onto a 13 inch walleye. I got him up to the boat a couple times. I never actually had him hooked, but he had my walleye 3/4 into his mouth and wouldn't let go. Finally, when he saw the net, he just opened his mouth and was gone. We never got a good look at him, but I think it was a pretty big fish. I've heard that a northern will eat things up to 1/3 their own length. If true, that makes this fish 39 inches or better.Even though we didn't catch lots of walleyes, we ate fish three times--including a couple of northerns which were big enough to fillet out the y-bones, and still leave beautiful fillets. Not bad for 2.5 days of fishing. I think we would have done better if we had done more looking for fish on our depth finder, rather than fishing places we caught fish in other years. To be honest , I have read all the articles about marking fish on your depth finder, before you start fishing, with a healthy bit of skeptism. However, our Sunday evening experience has made a believer out of me. It is going to change how I fish my home lake, which feels like the Dead Sea."
509315,Guest,2000-08-22 13:40:00,0,Appreciate the report on rainy. Did you make it up to Seine bay during your weekend? How deep were the smallmouth?
509316,Guest,2000-08-23 14:46:00,0,"We did go into Seine Bay just briefly on Saturday, but the wind made that pretty tough. We went out just a little ways past the Berry Island area, to the outer ring of islands, and trolled some breaks with no success. Most of our fishing was on Swell Bay and Red Gut Bay. We caught most of our fish in water over 20 feet, and up to 35 feet. We did not specifically fish smallmouth, but caught them by accident trolling for northerns on Countdown Rapalas, and even on big bucktails (Mepps Giant Killer). We also caught a couple backtrolling or drifting on lindy rigs with floating jigs and leeches. There was a group at the Camp from Missouri who were there primarily to fish smallmouth. They were planning on fishing shallow rocky points/shelves with top water, spinner baits and jigs and plastic bodies. I don't know how they did, though because we left the day after they arrived.If you are looking for action, a good place to troll crankbaits is just under the highway bridge into Swell Bay at Bears Pass Narrows. From that bridge turn right along the rocky cliff, until you reach the first cabin--don't go much past it though--lots of shallow rocks. Troll crank baits as close to the cliff as possible at varying depths. Perch color works great there. You'll catch lots of northerns and quite a few smallmouths. Best if the wind has been crashing into the cliffs, or in the evening as the sun sets behind the cliff.Hope this helps. Good luck!"
