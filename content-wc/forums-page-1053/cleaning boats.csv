509604,Russ,2000-08-23 20:06:00,17,To keep you boat looking good I suggest a mixture of Vinegar and water. It works great on boats. As for the algae get it real wet first and let the vinegar soak in a bit before wiping it off.Russ

509607,Guest,2000-08-24 13:10:00,0,"I've used a product called ""Zing"", it's much like Lime-a-Way but made specifically for painted aluminum boats. It's acidic and does a great job on water spots."
509605,chrism,2000-08-26 09:45:00,429,"Just did the vinegar clean for the first time - works great, and leaves a nice shine - gets the water spots off as good as anything. I used a 50% mix. Too bad about the smell..."
