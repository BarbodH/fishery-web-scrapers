Any advice/tips you may be willing to share about Lac Seul or surrounding lakes would be greatly appreciated! Also, we will be staying at the Golden Fawn Chalet. Has anyone had an experience with this lodge, good/bad/otherwise? Any replies will be appreciated."

For the past 6 years, I have caught most of my fish in the 6-12' range in Sept. Trolling cranks or spinner rigs w/minnow have been the most productive for me. This June the lake level was rising by the day due to all the excessive rain and the fish were usually 2-4' deeper than normal. Spinner rig is 24-30"" snell with #2-4 Indiana or Colorado blade (bright colors: red, chartruse, hunter orange, etc) with Aberdeen 2/0 gold hook pulled on a 1/2oz bottom bouncer. Mainly fish Steamboat Bay, Cox's Island, McKenzie Bay, Sawmill Bay, Winnagauga River or anyplace in between. Weather is very unpredictable that time of year. Can be warm or cold. Most mornings it's nippy (35-45 degrees)and afternoons range from 45-80 degrees. Suggest clothing to cover the spectrum and a REAL GOOD RAIN SUIT! Many days have been spent in insulated coveralls/rain suit due to cold/rainy conditions. The trees are usually turning due to frost by the first week in Sept.The main channel is marked if you know where the markers are located. Suggest you get a GOOD lake map with depth contours. Four Seasons or Smitty's in Ear Falls has decent maps. Lac Suel is known to eat lower units!"

I wouldn't say he was real knowlegable about the lake, but he will give you enough info to get you going. Try Cox's Island and any point or reef you can locate. Make note of where the other boats are as you are cruising around and pay those spots a visit later. Any bait or presentation will work. We usually start with jigs and minnows and then go from there. Crawlers can work when the minnows won't so be sure to bring an ample supply accross the border. Cranks are fun if you find the fish oriented to the main shorelines. Cranks can also produce some nice sized northerns. Yum Yum Be prepared for bad weather. Winter gear and good rain gear is a must. Lac Suel is big water and can kick up 6 footers so be careful."
