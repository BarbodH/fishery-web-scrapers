509556,KnottyBuoy,2000-08-18 09:30:00,110,We have fished it 2 years in a row .......one year out of LumberJack Lodge on the south end and this year Whiskey Jack Lodge on the north end.......It is one of the best lake trout lakes in all of Ontario.......very deep and very clear......last year the limit was increased to 3 trout per person but this year it went back to the providence normal limit of 2.........Some of the other guests did fish walleyes and northerns but they all said walleye fishing was tough.......there are some lakes near by that produced more walleyes so most everyone fished lake trout on Sturgeon and then went to another lake to fish walleyes.......Both of the resorts mentioned above were excellent and the prices in August are super reasonable.......
509557,Guest,2000-08-19 22:48:00,0,Thanks for the reply; I guess we'll keep driving by; we generally only fish lakers after we have had our fill of northerns -UNLESS- you have been catching sea monster sizes !!lobo
509558,KnottyBuoy,2000-08-21 11:02:00,110,Not real monsters but we had some in the 8 pound range and broke some lines on what I am sure were bigger fish. We downrig for them in 60 to 90 feet of water.......nice change of pace from our usual fishing for walleyes. We started going there in August because the price of the cabin is unbelievably low.......4 people for the week for $450 .....and the accomodations are nice. And if you have to fish walleyes Whiskey Jack has boats on some smaller lakes that you can drive or hike to and fish walleyes and northerns for the day. 14' boats with small motors........just take some jigs and bait and you have a ball......
