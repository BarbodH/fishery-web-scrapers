509522,KnottyBuoy,2000-08-14 05:58:00,110,We were up in July and the water level was high......which made naviagiting the rocks just a little bit trickier........but the walleys were in 12 feet of water and hit leeches and minnows equally as well........
509523,Fred_G,2000-08-15 05:03:00,908,"Just returned from Lake St. Joe on Sunday. Water levels are about 5 feet above normal, which has had an effect on weed growth. Big Pike are somewhat off but walleye fishing was fantastic. Our group had many in the 20 - 25 inch range. Surface temps are in the upper 60's. We had one day that was the most miserable weather to fish in, cold and rain all day, yet caught lots of walleye. Spots that were good for us were just around the corner from Boulder City, Waynes Rock, False Rib and the area around Sand Island (check out the little island just inside False Rib, WOW!), Broadrib, the Big M, and the Hog Trough. With the water levels up like they are, be careful for submerged rocks that were previously visible. I understand there has been a lot of lower unit damage this year. LOL Fred"
509524,Guest,2000-08-15 08:27:00,0,Can you provide the name of the outfitter for Lake St. Joseph?Thanks!
509525,Fred_G,2000-08-15 09:58:00,908,We satyed at The Old Post & Village. John Grace is the owner/operator. Their website is www.oldpost.com. LOL Fred
509526,Brad,2000-08-16 20:17:00,95,"Thanks Fred. Any trouble with delays and/or gravel stretches due to road construction? Also, isn't it fairly shallow around the island as you head into FalseRibb?"
509527,Fred_G,2000-08-17 04:48:00,908,"There is a 20 mile stretch of gravel on Hwy 599. It wasn't bad, unless you're towing a boat, then you may want to slow down a bit. We drove 55 mph on it, no problems.Normally, the water would be shallow at the entrance to False Rib, but with the current high levels we experienced no problems. We mainly came in from the south, but coming in from the north just requires a little swing out further. Interestingly, last year there was a big sand beach on Sand Island. This year it's completely under water. They did say towards the end of our week there that the dam was being opened up some to start to lower the lake levels, but they expected it to take quite a while to get back to normal. LOL Fred"
509528,Guest,2000-08-17 18:12:00,0,"Just returned from St. Joseph Tuesday and the fishing is good. The water is high and had risen during our stay. They're trying to obtain permission to open flood gates but haven't yet, to my knowledge. We found our fish on reefs and shoreline flats in 10-30 ft. with the bigger fish coming from deeper water generally. 24 3/4"" walleye and 39"" pike were our biggest.Good luck...SkeeterBoy"
