509254,Guest,2000-07-25 06:00:00,0,Take a 6 to 9 inch bait fish and put it on a two to three ounce jig. Find the deepest hole in the lake and drop this monster down to the bottom and jig it like you would for walleyes.
509255,Guest,2000-07-27 03:27:00,0,"Since live bait is not legal in much of Quebec there are two options. Downrigging with huge spoons (Bigger is better.) or lead lining with huge spoons. At this time of year you'll be going deep. If you mark fish that are hugging bottom, things will be tough, but as fish move up and become more active, troll through them at that depth. Jigging is another possibility. Bring along plenty of patience."
509256,Go_Fish,2000-07-27 08:10:00,28,"Scoot,I know that I have mentioned it before on this board, and everyone is probably tired of hearing it, but start with finding the thermocline. I think that a temperature probe works best, but their might be a few who argue with that. Wherever the thermocline ends start fishing for trout. The depth should be around 50 - 80 feet. Although, this depends on the weather and how windy it has been over the season.Over the years, I have always used a 3-way rig with 6 - 8 oz of lead. Lately though with the new braided lines, I only have to use 6 oz and some times 4 when fishing shallow. Anyway, fish breaklines on bars that project out into deep basins. Start in deep water, and work your way shallower, bouncing your way up. Once you become familiar with the structure, you can troll along the breakline at the appropriate depth. The 3-way that I use has a drop line about 16"" long which is usually monofilament, and leader about 36"" long. This way if your sinker snags, you can usually break the mono so you don't loose you spoon. I use a spoon made by Sutton Co. out of Naples, NY. My favorite style is #88 Two-toned (Gold/Silver) hammer finish. This technique has almost always worked for me. Hopefully it will work for you as well. With regards to jigging, I have spent some time doing that but it is really hit or miss. I usually can find fish trolling, but you need a lot of patience when you are trying to jig. Especially.....if you can't use live bait....I would stick to trolling.Sorry so long fellas....once I got started...I couldn't stop!Good luck and let me know how you did.Go_Fish"
509259,Guest,2000-07-27 09:13:00,0,Next year go in late mate or early june and catch them in three to 10 feet of water with anything you have in your tackle box. It's much easier and more fun. Good luck!!!
509257,Guest,2000-07-27 18:41:00,0,"Thanks Go-fish for the great response. This lake I will be fishing is about 7 mi. long by 2mi. wide. The deepest water is over 300ft. deep. Most of the lake is over 100Ft. deep. Should I fish just below the thermocline or above it? I understand bouncing bottom with the 3 way rig, but should I fish where the thermocline meets the bottom, or should I go after suspended fish? Also,what is the favored temp. range for Lakers? Thanks again!"
509258,Go_Fish,2000-07-28 14:17:00,28,"Scoot,I would start fishing where the thermocline meets the bottom. Look for a real rocky bottom adjacent to deep water. I usually start here, and then make adjustments as I get more info...like what depth I'm getting the fish, and/or if I'm marking a lot of fish suspended. Several things that you have to be careful of are at what speed you are presenting the bait. Usually the slower the better, just look at the action of your spoon before you send it down. Also, frequently you will catch trout just at the end of you troll in shallow water (If you are fishing deep to shallow). This makes you think that the fish are in shallow water, but actually they are following your spoon, and hit it when it is getting out of there comfort range. In addition, you will also get trout on the reel up because you might have had one following for a while. These are just a few things that make you scratch your head, but if they happen just hang in there and keep fishing the bottom.I think that the favored temp range for Lakers is around 42 degrees F. This is where water is the most dense, and holds the most O2, which is why it is at the bottom of the lake. They will range around though.I also wanted to mention that the good thing about fishing for Lakers in the summer is that there are fewer places for them to hide than in the spring when the water temperature is low. Almost like fishing in a barrel! Well maybe not quite....Good luck and let me know how you did.Go_Fish"
509260,retire55,2000-08-05 10:08:00,1029,"Scoot:According to the ""Fish-On"" Field Guide from TV Ontario, lake trout prefer 50 degrees F. Their blurb goes on to say that during warmer months, lakers stay beneath the thermocline and will be found at depths and temperatures associated with their prey (i.e. 53-55 degrees for alewives, 52-56 degrees for ciscoes, 49-51 degrees for smelt and 45-50 degrees for lake chub and sculpin. Jay"
509261,Guest,2000-08-22 13:16:00,0,"Tackle tips: Line counter reel and at least 200 yards of steel line. The LCR will allow you to determine and repeat depths once you locate fish. The steel is thin and doesn't stretch much and may allow you to troll a 1.5 to 5 oz. Krocodile spoon w/o weights. However, I'll often use up to a 4 oz. keel sinker on a three-way swivel to maintain better lure control with less line out or when trolling Rapalas. Use a silver or chrome colored Rapala or equivalent. I've also used Fireline with good success but it's not quite as good at deep trolling w/o weights.Locating fish off the bottom is the key. Do that, catch one, repeat the pattern and location, and you'll be golden.Good luck!"
