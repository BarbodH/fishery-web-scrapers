Are the cabins on the near shore side or do you have to load all gear into a boat to get to the cabins? I spoke with one outfitter at the Cleveland Sportsmen Show and his access was by boat from Kipawa. So camp owners names and addresses would be appreciated. Also, prices - American or Canadian. And any general information you can pass on would be apprecriated."

We stay back on Hunter Lake...put in at Kipawa heading north 9 miles (a little over half way to Laniel), east past Corbeau Lodge (have site on the net) for 7-8 miles. Although I have never saw the camp...Two Moon Lodge and the Van Der Donk's give the impression of nice people with good accomodation at a reasonable price...have spoken to them several times at Harrisburg Show. I have saw Corbeau...it is a ""nice"" lodge. I found Bernard and Eunice very personable and accomodating. They run a top rate camp. Check them out on the web. Good Luck...be well!"

509326,Guest,2000-08-22 13:23:00,0,"Do a search on ""Kipawa"" and you'll get some info a few of us have been exchanging.Many of the camps are boat-in camps, especially those accessed between Laniel and Villa Marie. Taggart Bay is a drive-in camp, as it is located near the boat docks where the others (including Jack and Jason Van der Donk at Two Moon) will pick you up. Taggart Bay's proximity to the fishing ""hot spots"" is about the same as Two Moon's and closer than the rest, and it is one of the nicest camps if not THE nicest camp on the upper side of the lake.Be very, very careful about choosing one of the lower-priced places on Kipawa; Taggart Bay and the other camps get many folks that stayed elsewhere first and hated it. Trips to Canada are really only great when you get all three things - great fishing, great companions, and great accomodations.Keep in touch!"
509327,Guest,2000-08-24 19:29:00,0,Thanks for the info. I will do a search for Kipawa. I have fished in Belleterre for about 30 years and find it difficult to leave a place one is familiar with. We tried a camp at Remigny this year and was not satisfied. So it is either back to Belleterre or check out Kipawa.
