509610,Frank from TBay,2000-08-23 16:07:00,312,They are both good producers. Either would be a good choice. Both lakes have good resorts and campground on them. Good fishing: Frank

The lake is 14 miles long with beautiful senary and the loons are a real bonus to listen to. We caught walleyes to eat, some to bring home as a reminder of how delicious they tasted for our shore lunches, and of course we returned many for our next trip back. We also caught northerns, smalleys, and the lake trout are there also if you are so inclined. The log cabins are very nice they have a toilet, sink and shower, with a fantastic view of the lake, and they were rented per cabin not per person, up to 6 people. The week was $450 Canadian which is about $325 in U.S. dollars so it was a great value. If you want more info e-mail Wally or Sue at [email protected] and they be happy to send you back any info you would like. Tell them Rich & Janet said Hi. I'm sure you will enjoy your stay with them just like we did, good fishing to you. Rich"

We have stayed at Pine Point Resort and found it to be very good in all aspects. And at a reasonable price.Your catch will be limited to Walleyes and Northerns, so if variety is what you want, perhaps the other lake mentioned would be a better choice. But for beauty and decent fishing for the species mentioned, we find it hard to beat. I love Lake of the Woods for the beautiful smallmouths that it holds and make that trip for a week. Lac Des Mille Lacs is good for our month long trip. Our campground neighbor lives in Kenora but for the last 30 years has been coming to Pine Point and now that he is retired, he spends the entire summer there. There is something special about it.Good luck with whichever you choose. In our opinion, Canada is worth the drive from Texas each and every year and we wish we were there now. If you choose Lac Des Mille Lacs next year, stop by and say ""hi"". We'll be in the campground at site # 7.Planocat"
