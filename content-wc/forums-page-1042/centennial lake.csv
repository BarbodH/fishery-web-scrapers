We went up to the Lady evelyn area last spring, but would like something a lot closer. We live in Central PA. We didn't like going through Toronto so we're trying to find something east of there. We heard of centennial/ black donald lake, a man made lake that is not built up. Any suggestions? We'd appreciate hearing from you. thanks."
