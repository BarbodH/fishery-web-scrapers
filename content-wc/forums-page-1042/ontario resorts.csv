510484,Guest,2001-01-08 21:09:00,0,We are looking at two resorts for a september fishing trip. Does anyone know anything about Indian Point camp on Wabigoon lake and also the fishing on Whitefish Lake southwest of Thunderbay?Thanks
510485,Bill Coomes,2001-01-10 03:19:00,70,"For Whitefish Lake, go to the links section of Walleye Central. Under ""Canadian Links"" click on ""Mahumba's Fishing Page"". He is one of the guides on Whitefish."
510487,Frank from TBay,2001-01-12 08:28:00,312,Whitefish can be a very productive lake. It is very shallow in a lot of areas and has a lot of weed growth. Perch fishing is very good. I would suggest cheking out Lac des Mille Lacs which is not that far from Whitefish. It is a huge lake and the walleye fishing is very good. A lot of people beat up on the smaller fish there. My suggestion is to get some of those and hunt down the larger fish. It requires a little work but we catch some very large fish there every year. Check out Pine Point Resort. I have heard a lot of good things about them. Good fishing: Frank

The wind can be a problem because its big water and it really had an effect on what areas we could get to and fish effectively. Our guide said fishing is better in June, July and early August. Dennis and Marilyn are nice folks and the resort is well kept. E-Mail if you need more info."
