510454,Guest,2001-01-17 07:41:00,0,"PeteStorm lures was purchased by Normark and several hot n tot PATTERNS have been discontinued but the lure itself has not. All sizes except for the 3/4 ounce magnum are still in production, the magnum has been retired. The packaging remains the same and tots are now available in what Normark calls ""the top 16 fish producing patterns"". This is a crock because some of the best patterns have been retired but since all companies have jumped on this cost reduction band wagon what else can we expect. Bass Pro, Cabelas, Gander Mountain, and Dicks Sporting Goods all carry good selections. FISH ON PARTNER!"
