Could you please give some info on the logistics of that. ie: where did you launch? how far is resort from launch? etc. I usually take camper and go to WaWa area but thought I might treat my wife to an american plan resort this summer. Any info you could give would be appreciated. Thanks in advance. email is [email protected]Bucks"
