510533,Guest,2001-01-15 06:44:00,0,"This past weekend I was up at Pine Falls and talked to a couple of groups who usually go to the Red religiously but they said the water is still ""chocolate brown"" with silt and they were only catching the odd fish so they decided to give the Winnipeg River a try. Unfortunately for them (and my group) all that was biting on Saturday were burbot/eelpout. Caught only 2 small walleye. The weekend previous the fishing was quite good at Pine Falls."
510534,manitobawalleye,2001-01-15 19:27:00,885,was out sat. morning for half the day. access is horrible walked out to a favorite spot and caught 2 burbot. did not mark many fish and the water is as mentioned like chocolate milk...would try up by breezy bend as the river seems to be clearer there in winter but this winter who knows..... tried big baits... rattle spoons and sonars to see if could draw in a sniffer with no luck... will try breezy bend next time out....whitemouth is hot..........
