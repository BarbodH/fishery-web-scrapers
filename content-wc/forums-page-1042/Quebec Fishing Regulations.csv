510342,Frank from TBay,2000-12-12 19:17:00,312,They have their new regs out. Check it out at www.fapaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/index1.htm. Say hello to that seperatist Lucien Bouchard if you see him. We love him here in Ontario because a lot of business has relocated to our province. We love you Lucien. Good fishing: Frank

510344,Frank from TBay,2001-01-12 19:24:00,312,Lucien quit yesterday......too bad.
510345,stewart,2001-01-12 20:41:00,100,Not such a bad day for those of us of who aren't 'pur laine' over here :).
510346,Frank from TBay,2001-01-13 06:45:00,312,"I wonder what the French definition for ""Pure Walleye Fisherman"" is. Up here the definition for ""pur laine"" is a six pack of Molson Canadian or is it Molson Canadien. Frank"
