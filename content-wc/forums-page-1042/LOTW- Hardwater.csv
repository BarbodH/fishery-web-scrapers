Am thinking about taking the sled up to Yellow Girl, does anybody know if they ice fish it? Any info would be helpful!!"

Walleyes, slow, need to go to the nestor falls area. they are catching them but slow. Crappies are slow as well. Right now everything is slow. Consider march to come up, the action starts heating up(along with the temps) in march."

We've already decided on the March trip but may still head up to check on the cabin and do some fishing. Around here- Eau Claire, Wisconsin the warm weather has put about 6"" of water on the ice! Makes it hard to do anything- pull sled, fish etc. Hope it isn't that bad up there!!! Stay warm- and dry!"
