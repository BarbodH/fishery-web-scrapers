Yeah, it's not a walleye - we caught them later.The story behind the picture wreaks of ""Beginner's Luck"". This was my son Spencer's first trip with us to Canada (he was nearly 7 when the pic was taken), and we weren't on the water for even an hour when he hooked into this fish - his first from Lake Kipawa. Hopefully it will be the first of many, as he represents the 4th generation of our family that has been traveling to this region since 1978.What you don't see in the picture is the fish slowly slipping from view as Spencer's wrist contorts to new angles. You also don't see the lengthy father-to-son conversation immmediately preceeding the catching of this fish regarding (a) complaining about being bored in the boat and (b) if you want to catch fish, you first have to fish. Fortunately, this fish came along during our discussion just in time to reinforce my reasoning!I know all of you have been on at least one side of that discussion, and many of you have been on both sides - so I hope you enjoy the picture!"
510304,Guest,2001-01-16 15:34:00,0,lucky dad! they (mom and dad) had to put my first on the hook when i wasnt looking!we're doing our first kipawa trip ever this year and any help on what typical daily numbers are would be a great help. we've done quite a bit of walleye fishing over the years but getting a feel for the daily action in terms of numbers would be a big help.i know you don't have a crystal ball but any good estimate would be appreciated! thanks! and keep him fishing!p
