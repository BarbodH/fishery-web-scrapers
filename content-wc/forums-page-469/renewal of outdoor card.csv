1341182,Golden Eagle,2011-08-17 09:21:00,2642,Only loss to resort owners is the mailing information they received from filling out fishing licenses.
1340897,Jig A Lowe,2011-08-16 12:07:00,87,I'm south of the border and just tried to renew online. Got a message saying that non-residents could not renew online and had to call the 1-800 number. Called that number and was told that my card was still valid so it could not be renewed. Explained that I would not be fishing in Canada again this year so I wanted to renew for next spring. Was told to call back in November as the system was able to handle my request. What's the purpose of this card anyway other than to generate more revenue?
1340914,wallydave,2011-08-16 12:54:00,2151,"Blah, blah , blah, to raise revenue, yadda yadda yadda, any questions??"
1340917,v-bay gord,2011-08-16 13:06:00,3168,"I believe the purpose is to put the data into a database (ie the ""card"") so that the licence process is not the drawn out affair that it presently is.......entering names, birthdates etc manually. This is a bonus to the issuer. On the receiving end (you) this should speed things up, especially since next year most issuers will have computerized terminals to print off licences by just plugging in your card. You should also be able to renew on line, replace lost licences, apply for hunting licences on line using the card etc. Is it worth 3 dollars a year? Don't know , but the government likes to think they are covering their costs."
1340922,joeman79,2011-08-16 13:11:00,417,"I was told that if you purchased a license this year and your card expires this year, that they will automatically send it to you in the mail just like the first time you purchased your license. And that if you did not purchase a license this year you would have to pay the 9.00 fee when you renew your license in 2012, don't know if thats right or not but thats what I was told."
1340930,Golden Eagle,2011-08-16 13:39:00,2642,"v-bay gord, thanks for the site. I tried it and it wouldn't fire up for me. Wonder if it's just for Ontario? I like the idea of renewing on-line.Maybe somebody else will also give it a try. Could be that my computer doesn't like the site."
1340932,Aaron-IN,2011-08-16 13:41:00,500,"The card does make it alot easier to buy a license every year, the last thing I want to do when I get to Canada is wait for 20 minutes while me and the crew get our license.....I'll glady pay the $9"
1341158,Bill Krejca,2011-08-17 07:58:00,6107,"Some resorts will no longer be selling licences next year, as they are not all geared up for the computer required. This is maybe not a bad deal for them, as issuing license is a pita, and the amount made is a pittance. It can be more inconvenient for the angler, however, as it either will require another stop, or ordering via electronic means. Bill Krejca"
1341161,wallydave,2011-08-17 08:05:00,2151,"This year my boat/cabin buddy and I used the 800 number for both the card and license. About 5-8 min on the phone, about a month wait, we called in April, and the card and license arrived by mail. A few weeks later, our hard copy cards arrived. If the south of the border crowd can use the MNR website next year, that might streamline the process. We will still stop at Dutchies for Kokanee and a few Cuban cigars...less waiting means more time on the water!"
1341164,Juls,2011-08-17 08:12:00,13414,"Thanks for the heads up....I just checked my card that my ex had ordered for me last year, when I was on the road.He got my birthday wrong and my eye color......... lolTwo minutes on the phone and they are issuing me a new card.Glad I checked it. Juls"
1341181,Golden Eagle,2011-08-17 09:19:00,2642,"Juls, glad you dumped the guy who didn't know your date of birth or eye color. Bet you could also outfish him."
1340822,Hump,2011-08-16 09:11:00,578,Mine expires in Dec. of this year. Does anyone know how you renew this card?
1340829,Mike Kansas,2011-08-16 09:26:00,1463,"Hump, I think they automatically send you a new card if you obtained a fishing license in 2011. Hope all is well with you and yours. Mike Kansas"
1340832,Mike Kansas,2011-08-16 09:33:00,1463,"Hump, After thinking about this a little more I think when you buy your lic next year you will also purchase the Outdoor Card. They will give you a reciept for the card that you must keep with your lic and they will send you a card in the mail later. This getting old is definitly affecting my memory. Mike Kansas"
1340856,v-bay gord,2011-08-16 10:02:00,3168,Renew it on line at : www.outdoorscard.mnr.gov.on.ca
1340860,wallydave,2011-08-16 10:06:00,2151,"I am not sure, but I think for those of us south of the Canadian border, we can call 1-800-667-1940, you can buy your license over the phone too! Last time someone posted on this topic the website was only for Canadians, this might have changed! Good Luck!"
1340867,Glenman12,2011-08-16 10:19:00,762,I believe Americans can order or renew the Outdoor Cars online but the website isnt set up yet or us to order the non resident licenses...at least thats what I was told in April when I called the 800# to order my license..that could have changed by now
1340873,v-bay gord,2011-08-16 10:47:00,3168,Hmmm.....you could be right. I guess the 800# is the only option.
1340877,Bill Krejca,2011-08-16 10:56:00,6107,I wouldn't on getting it for nothing. It would be just as simple if the license was just increased $9. Bill Krejca
1340889,Hump,2011-08-16 11:34:00,578,I tried the site. It said I wasn't eligible. Must have to wait until it expires. Thanks again.
1340894,wallydave,2011-08-16 12:03:00,2151,"There was another phone number to try for the card, 1-800-387-7011. Last spring I called the 188-677-1940 number and order both the card and my license over the phone. All told about 5-8 min. Both came in the mail within a month. Give the numbers a try, you may save yourself some time."
