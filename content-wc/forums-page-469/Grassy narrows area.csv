1330943,Biggerbear,2011-07-18 06:45:00,13,How was the fishing ?Was the water high enough to get into Dumpy Lake ?
1331064,Guest,2011-07-18 10:38:00,0,I just got back from guiding up there and the water is to low to get into Dumpy. The fishing is hot right now with big fish all over the humps and current areas.
1331133,Biggerbear,2011-07-18 12:42:00,13,HarveyCochrane do you know how to contact the Marina and who might be running it now. I am talking about the Marina on Tommy's Road.
1332623,hiwayman,2011-07-21 20:44:00,201,Marina is run by Robert Williamson right now.Marina 807-925-2051
1334417,Biggerbear,2011-07-27 08:14:00,13,Thanks for the replys and I am glad to know the fishing is still open to us.Talked to them and am probably going camping there next year.They only have 2 cabins at this time so it sounds like booking one would be hard but the marina still runs the campsites so that good for me.
1338034,Biggerbear,2011-08-07 07:35:00,13,"I talked to the fellow running Last Resort on the English River and he seems very nice. They only have 2 cabins so most likely getting one will be hard.I then talked to Robert at the Marina but he told me his Son really runs the Marina. Anyone have first hand knowledge about the service quality ?i.e. Safety of vehicles/trailers when left at the Marina, Supplies like gas and ice and in general how did you feel about the new managers ?Thanks for any information given !!!"
1338362,Biggerbear,2011-08-08 11:05:00,13,BumpHope someone responds !
1341542,dstich,2011-08-18 13:21:00,2,The Marina is open and is currently being managed by:Rober & Annette WilliamsMarina: 807 925-2051Home: 807 925-2678The road leading up to the marina is significanly better as they have been doing a lot of work on it.
1341543,dstich,2011-08-18 13:24:00,2,"We've gone up there 2 times this year and have 1 more planned next month. The service has been excellent, when they are there. They have snacks, ice, gas. I'm not sure of the condition of the boat rentals."
1212514,Guest,2010-06-22 11:02:00,0,Any good lodges with camping near the grassy narrows area? Seperation lake is a bit spendy.
1212595,Guest,2010-06-22 13:58:00,0,"There is a marina there but I am not sure what the name is, I looked in the phone book and there is a # for English River Outfitters...807-925-9990. I know the marina has campsites on the river, the campsite down by Little Fox Lake is a big nice site.....hope that helps, if it's not the right #...hopefully they'll have the right # for you."
1212956,JoeWho14,2010-06-23 13:38:00,20,"The marina Harvey was referring to is Misty's Fishing Adventures, here's the web site: www.mistysfishingadventure.com The phone number for English River Resort is actually Ball Lake Lodge, I just came back from there on Monday. They offer full American Plans as well as an American Plan without guides. The lodge is nothing fancy, but the food is good, guides are knowledgeable and the fishing is terrific, I've been going there for over 10 years. They don't have web site, but if you decide to call ask for Harvey!"
1212984,Paxton,2010-06-23 15:08:00,10,Does ball lake lodge have camping?
1213281,JoeWho14,2010-06-24 16:55:00,20,No.....unfortuneately!!
1213325,Paxton,2010-06-24 20:08:00,10,ok thanks
1213554,hiwayman,2010-06-25 19:42:00,201,"Spent the week of june 12th to the 19th at the cabin at the Marina. That's Mistys fishing adventures marina.They have camping at the marina and also remote camp sites. Rodney and lillian are super people. give them a call. #807-925-1010. Been going there for over 15 years now. Fishing last week was a little slower than normal for the walleyes the first part of the week due to a mayfly hatch. The bite picked up later in the week. We caught numbers of 16 to 18 inch eyes, but we struggled on the bigger fish compared to other trips. a 24"" was the big walleye. We did very well on Northerns tho. had a 37 and a 37 1/2 incher.We did very well on the smallies also.Great people, very scenic area and very good fishing. Not as snaggy as Seperation lake. you can run west to Seperation and Lount or north to Ball lake and Tide lake. Many good spots to fish. If you go there Rodney and lillian will give you some spots to get started."
1213652,Bigstorm,2010-06-26 09:56:00,799,"I just got back from up here last night. We launched at the marina where Rodney is, but stay at a different cabin on the lake not far from the marina. The water was a little low but not bad. Out of our group of 7, we had roughly 15 eyes over 20"", 4 being over 25"" with the largest at 28"". We got our first Musky out of this area too (37"") and the largest northern was 38"". We dont really fish for the northerns, but always manage to find a few when jigging for the eyes. Some of our spots that dont have much current didnt produce due to a mayfly hatch monday night, but went to a few other spots where there is a decent amount of current and managed to do pretty good."
1330648,Biggerbear,2011-07-17 08:16:00,13,Now that Rodney and Lillian are out of the Marina does anyone know if the Marina will be open again ?Have not been up in a few years and Rodney sent me a Email saying he is not at the Ojibwe-Aking Marina this year.
1330806,Bigstorm,2011-07-17 16:20:00,799,"the marina is open this year, not sure who is running it or how to get in contact with them. I was up there about a month ago, but used a different launch on the river system"
