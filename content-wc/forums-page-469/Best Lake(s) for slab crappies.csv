1340039,Glenman12,2011-08-13 19:37:00,762,havent been there since the mid 80's but the best crappie fishing Ive ever had was on Rainy Lake..fished the Northeast portion
1340406,MrWalleye73,2011-08-15 06:30:00,821,"+1 Glenman....since we have fished the same waters. Little Grassy Lake on the east end of Rainy. There was a rock hump that came up just above the surface, just off of two points. Fish there in the evening, and bring back a limit of 10"" plus blacks, with the largest being shy of 17"". Fun for sure!"
1337925,Ia Walihntr,2011-08-06 15:19:00,320,"Don't know about the average weight for Crappies on LOTW but the average length, from my experience, is around 12 inches."
1338387,aggie kolisnik,2011-08-08 12:38:00,39,We have a place you might be interested in around the Tug Channel area for Aug 28-sept 4th or sept 24th-Oct 1 for crappies. Call me at 807-468-3624 or email me at [email protected] Thanks
1338409,hawks_rule,2011-08-08 13:27:00,115,Where is tug channel?
1338410,Obabikon,2011-08-08 13:34:00,2370,Obabikon Lake or Obabikon Bay both have some of the best crappie fishing in all of Lake of the Woods. Flat out awesome crappie in the fall.
1338581,Ia Walihntr,2011-08-08 21:59:00,320,"Hawks_Rule, The south entrance to Tug Channel is about 8 to 10 miles straight east of Angle Inlet. It runs north 3 or 4 miles to French Portage---Johnson's Passage area. Upper end of Tug has good crappie action at times."
1338972,1700SS,2011-08-10 08:14:00,104,"I agree with Obabikon/Jared. LOTW in the fall is awesome. Give him a call he will take care of u. I will be up there in 4 weeks from this friday but who's counting. I stay at Red Wing Lodge, but Mylies is nice and Jared runs a heck of a camp."
1339547,Guest,2011-08-11 21:49:00,0,"Look at the all of aggie's posts. All spam. Obabikon is only slightly better, at least he posts a few reports on fishing conditions and throws in the odd bump for another resort. Mostly spam though. Give us a break, this site was never intended to be used for free advertising."
1339549,Ia Walihntr,2011-08-11 22:00:00,320,I'd have to say Obabikon's posts are 99.9% information rather than solicitation. Give him a break! Keep the posts coming Jared.
1339550,Guest,2011-08-11 22:12:00,0,"Bill hit it on the nail in terms of fall fishing. I have watched too many people trying to release these fish. Personally I look for places that are just out from the obvious spawning locations. Look for a reasonably good sized basin with depths that max out between 30 and 40 feet. Fish the edges of these basins. These sites tend to be uniform...no real structure just mud flats. Very clearly northwestern Ontario holds the best crappie opportunities in Ontario but folks in the know may keep these spots tight....other than the obvious spots on Lake of the Woods. Crappies are expanding like crazy in the region and tend to experience their best growth rates within a few years of establishing themselves in a new lake. You will need to keep your nose to the ground but there are a bunch of lakes between Kenora, Dryden and Ear Falls that are taking off and I believe that these are your best bets if you truly want the best crappie fishing that the province has to offer."
1339551,Guest,2011-08-11 22:35:00,0,"A little bit of a cut and paste...must be a whole pile of other posts that I am missing to make up for the 99.9%www.obabikon.com is my place, but I have many resorts on the lake that I could suggest. www.obabikon.com Has some of the best walleye fishing on the entire lake within a few minutes of the camp.www.obabikon.com is a great place. We have a ton of guests from ND and SD. Close drive, and Lake of the Woods is an amazing fishery for all species. www.obabikon.com kids come for half price!"
1336810,Guest,2011-08-03 07:07:00,0,What are the best lakes in Ontario that have slab crappies in abundant numbers?
1336822,Guest,2011-08-03 07:55:00,0,Try LOTW
1336823,filetnfish,2011-08-03 07:55:00,4,We got into some slab crappie one time at Rainy Lake while staying at the Fisheries Resort.
1336851,Bill Krejca,2011-08-03 09:53:00,6107,"We go to LOW in the fall for crappies and do very well. Although I've never fished it, Rainy Lake also is noted for some biggies, and may even be better (?). When they are in the shallows in the spring during spawning, some great catches are possible. The situation I've found, however, is that this is so weather/water temperature dependent, that it can be hit or miss by several weeks. Fall fishing for me has been more predictable, mid-September to as cold as you can stand it. 18 - 30 feet deep is usually where they are at. Anything below about 23 feet should be considered a keeper, as they will probably not survive being released, due to the ""bends"". Watch where the eagles are sitting, they've learned to wait for the throw-back floaters and scoop them up. Bill Krejca"

1337852,Guest,2011-08-06 08:43:00,0,What is the average weight of the crappies in Lake of the Woods?
1337885,lassh,2011-08-06 10:48:00,553,Lac La Croix has some schools of slabs. You can catch a bunch once you find them.
