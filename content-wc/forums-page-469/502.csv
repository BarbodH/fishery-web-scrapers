Our wait on the causeway was about the same, the rest of the way to NW Lac Seul was without any problems what so ever! Drive safe and have a good trip! Tell us about your results! Some of us have to wait until next June! Only 312 days to go!"
1340290,jkretch,2011-08-14 17:00:00,80,Delay very short for us....5 minutes on way up and almost nothing on the way back. 502 was in the best shape I can remember. Border wait 2 cars on way up and about 10 cars on the way back - both Saturday AM. In general - a breeze. Thanks for the responses.
1340434,tv4fish,2011-08-15 07:42:00,2694,"I really think it is now a ""perpetual project"" as they have been working on it every year for quite a few years ???"
1337689,jkretch,2011-08-05 15:33:00,80,Just wondering what the condition of 502 is. Thanks

1337774,Glenman12,2011-08-05 20:23:00,762,"yeah, the causeway was a pain on the way back..had two trucks pulling boats that had entered the one lane area...they stopped us and the trucks and boats had to be backed out so they could get a piece of equipment in...hope its done by next year..502 was a breeze"
1337801,Catman59,2011-08-06 04:53:00,345,Our wait seemed a little long in Mid July at the causeway and we came accross the reason ..... someone sure had a bad day !!!
1337898,wallydave,2011-08-06 12:49:00,2151,Yikes!! Good thing they have health care! You might need a hazmat team to clean off the seat!
1337917,Catman59,2011-08-06 15:07:00,345,There was a few guys on pontoons out in the lake beside the mess studying it ! I hope it looked worse than it was.
1337947,KSauers,2011-08-06 17:07:00,385,Is it just me or does it seem that no progress is ever made on the causeway? How many years has it been?
1337978,Catman59,2011-08-06 19:53:00,345,No its not just you .......... It sure doesnt change much as far as I am concerned !
1337988,tadler,2011-08-06 20:26:00,43,Anyone think heading up to Perrault Falls might be better on 71?
1338026,cruiseforever,2011-08-07 07:07:00,177,The delay is just a few minutes.
