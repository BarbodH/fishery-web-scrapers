1340394,Kwags,2011-08-15 05:00:00,48,They've changed their site address recently. Did you update your favorites? That could be the cause
1340489,gapwedge,2011-08-15 10:40:00,19,"Thanks, but that's not it. I've googled it and can't get onto the site by hitting the google link either. Are you able to access the site?"
1340499,Kwags,2011-08-15 11:04:00,48,I can get on this way:http://www.ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/

1340737,gapwedge,2011-08-15 23:04:00,19,"Thanks. I guess it is my ""IP"". OK, what is an IP?I can get on initially using the link provided by campcountry, but get the error message when I try to access any other page, including the page to contact the site in order to get the matter resolved.Any suggestions?"
1340857,Campcountry,2011-08-16 10:03:00,164,"The reason why you get the error message when you try to access any other page is that when you click on a link you then are leaving the proxy server so you are back to using your own IP number. You can try turning off your modem for 15 minutes. Sometimes that results in your ISP giving you a new IP when you turn your modem back on.If that doesn't work, you can go to http://www.whatismyip.com/ to find out what your IP is. Make a note of it and then ask the folks at the Ontario Fishing Community to unblock or white list the IP.[email protected] should work for an email address.I hope that helps"
