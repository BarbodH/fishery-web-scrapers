1339661,Mike Borger,2011-08-12 09:22:00,1554,"I always take these kinds of posts with a grain of salt. But when multiple people make such negative comments, well then that's a different story."
1339666,jignminow,2011-08-12 09:27:00,168,"Feel free to tell me ""your side"" of the story. I think that is absolutely fair. I would love to hear the ""real"" version. Anyway, it doesn't really matter since I don't even fish that area any more so there won't be a time that I will have to consider any resorts from that area. And, there is no sense getting into a peeing match with posts going back and forth with accusations and responses so you can have the last word without me adding to it. I already know the truth. The most important thing is what you wrote in your last sentence ""So the bottom line is that we work harder to make it better for guest in the future"". What you should, or I hope that you take away from this is that obviously, there are many people that you have rubbed the wrong way. Maybe you didn't realize it at the time because you were under a lot of stress or you have so many people calling to book trips that you didn't care or whatever but it has cost you business and has given you bad press. Maybe this has opened your eyes and will help you to take a step back and realize that a lot of your guests or potential guests only have 1 week a year to spend up there in God's country and the last thing we want to do is worry about being unhappy or stressed out over a place that we paid to stay at. Realize that every first timer is a potential life long customer. If we would have had a pleasant trip we would have been returning to your place every year. Now we have a place like that as a result. It seems like a pretty simple plan to me. Be willing to bend a little. The littlest things can make the biggest difference. Being happy to see (or at least puting on a happy face) when guests arrive and asking how their week is going, thanking them for coming etc. seem like pretty s.o.p. things to me. 2 rolls of t.p. per week per cabin? Really? Does your household only go through 2 rolls per week? You might need more veggies. I used a roll today already...lol We did really enjoy feeding the eagles. That was a highlight. Do what is right Scott. It will pay you back in the end. Thanks for responding."
1339693,tv4fish,2011-08-12 10:44:00,2694,"Scott: Your header says ""Not true"" and then you respond in ""generalities"" -- Could you please respond directly to some of the specific items mentioned, i.e. ""2 rolls of TP"" - was/is that true or not??My opinion -- you have quite a few ""specifc"" items mentioned in quite a few different posts - maybe respond to those specifics??"
1339697,Knoxabilly,2011-08-12 11:18:00,225,"I have never stayed at Golden Eagle, I stay at Evergreen Lodge yearly. This year however, I had a very positve experience with Scott. One of our 2 camp boats broke down in Sawmill one day, we all piled into one boat and drove back to camp, leaving the broken boat tied up in Sawmill. When we got back to Evergreen, Gary (evergreen owner) was gone trapping minnows so Pat contacted Scott and he gladly took me and another guy out to fix our boat. On our way out he shared some great stories and shared some of his fishing spots with us. He got our boat running, let us stay out to fish these new spots he gave us, and took the other boat back. Pretty thoughtful for a guy who doesn't know us what so ever and we weren't even stayin in his camp. The spots he gave us proved to be great also, had some of the best fishing of the trip at his spots."
1339707,SinOrSwim,2011-08-12 11:45:00,1528,"People need to understand all these posts are opinions. Someone telling about their bad experience is just as important as someone telling about their great experience. We had a very bad experience with the Guardian Eagle Resort many many years ago. But, it also put us in touch with the outfitter we used for the next 12+ years. So, some good came out of it. Information is key. It's no different than reading a review about a TV you want to buy to gather information as to what others think of the purchase. It's too bad this resort may lose business but the flip side is if someone came on here and said how great the experience was, nobody would bat an eye."
1339714,Mike Kansas,2011-08-12 12:12:00,1463,"It's probably time to put this thread to sleep. There are obviously some upset people involved in it and for all of them I wish they would not have had a bad experience. Canada and lac Seul are full of many great places to stay. I too would be upset if I had a bad experience at a resort but the two I go to now are as good as it gets. It has not always been that way...I too have been to resorts I wouldnt go back to and I dont. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1339722,stumcfar,2011-08-12 12:36:00,451,"We have stayed at Golden Eagle 3 of the last 4 years. We typically only stay for a half a week. We have been to other camps that wouldn't give us the time of day, because we were only at the camp a few days and not the entire week, that has never been the case at Golden Eagle. We have always been treated fairly and have had pleasant experiences there. THe cabin has always been clean and nice, the boats and motors have been great and everything ready to go each day. We took a prop off and broke the shaft this year and Scotty and Alma took it in stride, he had the boat out of the water within minutes, had it fixed, took it out for a test drive and had it running perfect for the next morning. He gave some advice on how to make it easier to pull a boat in if it ever happens again. We all took it as a learning experience and not as a criticism. This year we had two 10 year old boys with for the first time. I'm not sure if they should have been, but they fished off the docks every chance they got. They were never treated rudely, in fact Scott took the time to visit with them and have a little fun with them. He told them on our last night that they enjoyed having kids in camp, hoped the boys had a good time and hoped to see them again next year. I'm not sure what else could have been done to make our trip any better. After all the bashing, I just wanted people to know that we have had great experiences at Golden Eagle and will be back again."
1339333,Guest,2011-08-11 08:35:00,0,the added 3% for use of a credit card is not uncommon at any of the camps I have been to in Canada or Minnesota. That's what the onwers get charged by the CC companies. Lots of small businesses get charged this 3%
1339420,rms0528,2011-08-11 12:20:00,18,"I cannot speak to what the rules are in Canada, but in the US it is against the rules for merchants to charge extra for the use of a credit card vs. cash. It's in the merchant agreement with the bank. Most of the time it's not worth the hassle to squable over it, but for larger ticket items it can be worth the time to dispute the added charge through the cardholder issuing bank. A couple years ago I made a $2000 purchase and a couple days before closing the sale was told it would be x dollars more if I used a credit card. I called my card issuing company and inquired. They told me I would be able dispute the extra amount and wouldn't have to pay it. I didn't tell them the name of the company charging extra, but they definately wanted to know who it was. It's a major violation for merchants. I ended up speaking with a manager at the company and told them they had an option to charge me the extra and having it disputed or not charging it at all. They didn't charge the extra. The reason the merchants pay a small percentage to the merchant bank for credit card transactions is part of the cost of benefit of quick reimbursement from the bank for a sale without the risks associated with customer checks bouncing. Does anyone remember the old days when the overall cost of collecting on personal checks and dealing with NSF checks far outweighed the 3%. I've used credit cards to pay for my trips to LS in the past and was never charged extra by the camp I went to. It would be interesting to call up my card issuing company and ask about disputing the extra amount charged by a canadian merchant? 3% on a a couple thousand dollars would be worth the hassle for me, especially after having been treated as stated in the OP."
1339433,Mike Kansas,2011-08-11 13:05:00,1463,I sincerely hope that the accusations against golden eagle have not been exaggerated or taken out of context. It is sad when one has a business that is critized like this and cant defend itself. I hope golden eagle responds with some defense before their reputation is damaged anymore. I have never stayed there but i have seen some people report they liked golden eagle but apparently not everyone. Mike kansas
1339471,tv4fish,2011-08-11 15:21:00,2694,"Why are you saying that they can't defend themselves ?? I would say they have every right to ""defend themselves"" -- and I would think that if what is being said is NOT true , they sure as heck should be posting their rebuttal ?"
1339488,wallydave,2011-08-11 16:34:00,2151,"It would be a nice move for someone who has had a good experiance with GE, to post a reply, or tell GE, about this thread and let them reply. This site is for open discussion, perhaps the owners do not hit the web?! Some operators do, but not all operators post here."
1339496,teddi,2011-08-11 17:12:00,349,scott and alma should post their side of the story. i know both of them and have found them to be very good to their guests.
1339504,SinOrSwim,2011-08-11 17:46:00,1528,"If you use the search function you will find many posts about Golden Eagle. Some positive but from the small sample I read, overwhelmingly negative. A lot of the same complaints about the owner being rude and these were 5+ years ago. There were some people who had positive feedback though too."
1339574,jignminow,2011-08-12 05:59:00,168,mine are 100% accurate.......
1339629,the seeker,2011-08-12 08:21:00,1,"Good day to everyone from Scott at golden eagle I want to address some of the responses to the reveiws of golden eagle that where posted on walleye central in the past few years and to be sympathetic to people at the same time. We find from time to time complaints come from some people that will have an experience that's not conducive to what they expected from there trip to Golden Eagle and we try to use that information to correct any problems that may arise in the future. We work hard to make everyone's stay enjoyable. It's sad to say you can't make everyone happy all the time but all of us up here that own resorts try to do just that. Whatever the complaint may be it's one version and there is usually another story behind it. People are free to make comments on walleye central and that's a good thing, but when the truth is stretched and it's done to cut someone down, without them having an opportunity to voice thier side, that's wrong. It's quickly forgotten all the good things that where done for people and going out of your way to help them have an enjoyable trip. So the bottom line is that we work harder to make it better for guest in the future"
1339645,PARAJOHN,2011-08-12 08:47:00,15,"To Mike and the other posters,First off there were no exagerations in my original posting. Quite frankly writing that post was not an easy decision. As I stated the owners are from my small hometown. (>20,000) In fact I have a number of coworkers who know them personally.My group originally wanted to go another resort but I pushed for this resort because I like to support our local business people. In fact we looked at the older posts and it made us apprehensive but we decided to give the local guy a shot. Since I returned I have talked to people who love the resort but were perplexed by their behavior. Other people I have talked to experienced the same thing we did and wouldn't go back.I know I was very fair and balanced in describing our experience. I would welcome feedback from GE. In fact they have all of my contact information including my email. So if they read this post they can contact me directly.Maybe we did catch them on a bad week. I don't know. I do know one thing my family would never go back. Also, to WC and all of it's members, this is a great medium for all of us who love to persue our favarite gamefish. Unfortunately, not all of the posts can be about how many over 25"", or were are you going and when. I think threads like this give each of us information in order to make informed decisions on how we spend our money and precious vacation time. If I would have heeded the the warnings from the earlier posts I am very confident this post would have been very different. Live and LearnPJ"
1339049,jignminow,2011-08-10 12:07:00,168,"Not trying to be a smart *** but if you have had such good experiences at the two resorts, why are you changing?"
1339055,HeHooksHimself,2011-08-10 12:55:00,725,"Thanks for asking that, Steve, just so no one gets the wrong idea. For the last few years I have been taking a spring trip with six or so guys. That trip has been almost always at Wine Lake Camp. One year, we just thought we would try something different and we went to Woman River Camp. We did that for two years and it was cheaper than WLC, but the distances are long and there is a public boat ramp on the chain which just added people and ""cadillac"" style boats. We like the solitude of WLC. Even so, Paul and Debbie were awesome. For the last three years we have returned to WLC with the six, but my BroInLaw and I have been taking a fall trip to Woman River. We just thought we would mix it up a little this year and so we are trying Cobblestone. The idea of fishing a different lake each day appeals to our adventurous spirits. Also, a friend of mine's parents went there two years ago and said they enjoyed it. It seemed affordable and we just wanted something different. No down side to Paul and Debbie at WRC, though. They are the best. No hidden charges. Real fishing advice. Flexible. Does that make sense? In any case, the worst day I have had in Canada far surpasses the best day I have had at work, so I am counting the days! (28)"
1339060,jignminow,2011-08-10 13:06:00,168,Sounds good to me. Just wondering. We leave a week from Friday to Block Island Rhode Island for a week of entirely different kind of fishing and partying..........
1339065,marayzl,2011-08-10 13:25:00,3,We all work hard for our money and it sucks when you give it to people who don't deserve it. There are some great outfitters in Canada. The folks at Gold Pines (Ear Falls) and Howey Bay (Red Lake) are some of the nicest people I have ever met. Give them your money.
1339109,jambi,2011-08-10 15:34:00,504,I agree!! Too many other places to try than to go back and wonder if it will be better.
1339127,Reels,2011-08-10 16:04:00,2876,"Yeah, I remember those nut jobs. Booked a cabin and Steve warned us of the experience, but wanted to try to fish Lac Seul. Sent a deposit and three weeks before we left I got the deposit check back in the mail saying someone else had the cabin booked before my deposit arrived. Thought, OK, no biggie. Found somewhere else to go. Got a call at home while we where gone by Scott chewing out my wife that we didn't show up and I owed for the week. Worse thing was explaining to the old lady, yes we went fishing. Best thing was sending his letter back to him so he could use if for toilet paper."
1339241,J.Iverson,2011-08-10 22:12:00,64,"All in all I think you'd be cheating yourself out of a pleasant experience if you didn't give them another try, they really are good people. And I do not have a financial interest in the camp, if my wife hadn't contracted skin cancer 2 years ago, I'd be back up there right now. Larry Mead[/quote]Larry, you raise a valid point; and I am very sorry to hear about your wife. I also have skin cancer, the terminal kind. I have stage 3 metastatic melanoma and 2 years ago was given 6 months to live from the Mayo Clinic. With experimental drug trials and a positive outlook I have beat their predictions thus far but realize what I am ultimately up against. That is why this trip was a pretty big deal for my family. My wife and I are both 40 years old, and our daughters are 8 and 10. I have switched my goal of catching a 30 inch walleye to living long enough to walk my daughters down the isle. I realize I won't get a chance to relive those 7 days we spent at Golden Eagle, we made the best of it and created photo memories of dad for the kids. I just thought if I could help somebody plan a better trip by sharing my experience it would be constuctive for them. In my case I feel (my) life is to short to give them another try. In your defense I did see Scott and Alma interact with some of their repeat clients while I was there, just not with us. John Iverson"
1339299,wallydave,2011-08-11 07:32:00,2151,"I work in heath care, helping people emotionaly and spiritualy when they face these difficult health issues. My older sister, and the father of my boat/cabin buddy have had similar heart breaking health reports recently. Our trips to Canada with the bonding that comes from the shared experiance go beyond just the fishing. It is the peace, natural beauty, along with making memories that combine to make these trips so special. Even more so when members of these trips face difficult issues. By recording these trips and the memories that make them so special, our friends and families will cherish the stories and the memories and hopefully find consolation and peace!"
1339314,v-bay gord,2011-08-11 08:04:00,3168,"A very good point WallyDave. In the lodge business I see the different attitudes...those that are looking beyond just ""catching"" and those that have a real narrow view of what makes a great trip. I prefer the folk that have the bigger perspective. It is a real pleasure to deal with happy people. Mr. Iverson, I feel badly that your trip was spoilt by someone's bad attitude. Best of luck and keep the good memories.......forget the bad."

There are far too many good operators out there that would be more than willing to provide a good experiance for thier clients! Sites like this help all of us to find good places to fish out of, and to steer clear of the rest!"
1339003,jignminow,2011-08-10 09:57:00,168,"That was the first place that I ever stayed in Canada and we absolutely hated it!!!! We were supposed to be at Evergreen next door and when we got there, they moved us over to G/E. I don't remember the 2 roll per cabin deal but that is a ""bunch of crap"". lol......I use a roll every visit....big shooter = big ****ter.....kidding.......the cabins sucked and where on a huge incline. Scott used to walk around the camp at night fogging but wouldn't bother telling anyone so the fog would come right through the window. AWESOME!!!! He made us move to a different cabin after we were already completely unpacked and dug in. At the time, I was there with my two very young sons 8 & 12 and he offered no help to move us, just a command to move because a different group was taking our cabin. The biggest thing that I remember is that my 12 year old caught a Walleye that was pretty big for him and we were fishing right by the bridge that you have to go under to get out of his bay. Scott was out in his boat and saw my son fighting the fish and raced over to help net it. he scooped up the fish and without saying a thing or letting my son hold the fish for a picture or even really see it, he just tossed it back and said that it was camp policy to let fish of size go.......I was pissed and quite honestly, my blood is boiling right now thinking about it. That was the closest I ever came to punching someone out. My son, was very upset and instantly made me hate the guy..................I wouldn't stay there if it were free or even if I was getting paid.........we switched to Minaki the following year and have been at Barbers Resort every year since........man this brings up some bad memories...."
1339013,2 DOGS,2011-08-10 10:22:00,361,"Having spent 10+ summers at this resort I feel a need to defend Scott and Alma. No, not the limit of 2 rolls of toilet paper, having had 4 daughters and a wife I can speak with great authority about ""paper products"". Two would not cut it for me either. However, I have seen guests load up anything not nailed down for the trip home also. I really think you happened to catch them on a bad week, it is so unlike them to be unappreciative. I have seen Scott, at his own expense, take people out fishing when they weren't having much luck. For those who have ever hired him as a guide, know what a good job he does. I have never seen a better guide on that end of Lac Seul. All in all I think you'd be cheating yourself out of a pleasant experience if you didn't give them another try, they really are good people. And I do not have a financial interest in the camp, if my wife hadn't contracted skin cancer 2 years ago, I'd be back up there right now. Larry Mead"

And then reading what he told Iverson's wife about the kids swimming. I cannot believe and only hope this jackwagon loses everything. People work hard to afford a vacation like this and go to a place where they are treated poorly. Really leaves a bad taste to ever want to take a risk of crossing the border again.
1339042,HeHooksHimself,2011-08-10 11:56:00,725,"Compare the report here to SWW lodge and you see the difference that customer service makes. I, for one, am glad that this forum exists so poor experiences in camp don't go unnoticed. We all know that resort owners read this forum and maybe it will help one of them make the right decision when presented with a choice to serve their visitors or ignore them. I have most of my experience with two resorts and we love both of them. For the record that is Paul and Debbie at Woman River Camp and Herb and Ann at Wine Lake Camp. Both are quality operations run by great service-minded people that have become dear friends over the years. We are at risk as we go to a new place this fall (early Sept.) that we have received some warnings about since we booked. (read the Cobblestone Lodge thread) I will definitely post our experiences when we return."
1339046,jignminow,2011-08-10 12:03:00,168,"I decided, after the initial shock of it all, that this ended up being a good thing because it forced me to find a new location which we love now as much as we did back then. It turned out to be the best move ever. As far as giving them another shot, not a chance! If I were going to be fishing the Lac Seul area, they would be the very last spot on the list of possible resorts that I would consider. First impressions are everything to me. I can forgive a bad day, a ""bad week"", not a chance. Seems to me that the ""good week"" is more of an oddity. I will say this, if I remember correctly, the week that we were there may have been very early in Scotts ownership of the camp. It may have even been his first year but I can't confirm that. Even with that, a jerk is still a jerk."
1338672,PARAJOHN,2011-08-09 08:43:00,15,"The group I go with has been fishing LS since the early 90's. Every 4 to 5 years we like to fish new water and decided to fish the west end this year. We picked this lodge because we found out the owners live in our hometown during the winter. But right from the get go the Arrogant Condesetion by the owner treating us like a bunch of idiots really turned us off. Once he realized we were from his hometown and had fished the lake for many years he changed his tune somewhat. However, the manic way in which we were treated the rest of the week was truely puzzling.First off, I will give them their props for having clean cabins and shower house. Half of our group camped and the other half stayed in cabins. However, the camping spot (1) for two families left alot to be desired. It sat directly on the main entrace to the resort. When the shower house ran out of TP it was like pulling teeth to get more. Come to find out the Cabins are limited to 2 rolls per week. (Camp Policy per the owner) So everyone was either using the shower house or taking it out of there and back to their cabin. We finally just ended up going to town and buying more.Secondly, Scott was great when we cracked a gear case in trying to locate parts. (Thank god for good insurance) However, after we decided to have it fixed in the States his wife tried to charge us for two extra days of docking fees. When we called her on it she tried to justify the charge by saying ""It was still parked in our yard"". Needless to say we didn't pay it.Third, no ""Thank You"" at the end of the stay. I don't expect the warm and fuzzies but when some doesn't even thank me for spending money at their establishment they just guaranteed that I won't be back.I'm sure there are going to be posts from satisfied customers ripping me for this thread. But what I posted and a whole lot more is what our group experienced at this resort. Take it for what you will and make your own determination. I just hope it saves a few people some money and aggrivation.PJ"

FYI: I had problems with a camp owner , but it was after the trip, through phone and letters. If I even mentioned what an *** I thought this guy was, I get paraded right off line. Each of us have had experiences."
1338752,PARAJOHN,2011-08-09 13:19:00,15,"fishing was slower than what we normally do, but it was to be expected since we were working new water. Our biggest was 27 3/4. We fished primarily in Mac. Bay"

Andrea, is an easy host to work with, she puts you on the fish, keeps upgrading the camp, boat and cabins. The only problem might be getting a cabin! She has always worked with our group to prevent any problems, and she deals with the problems, very few, in a prompt manner! LS has plenty of camps to fish out of! Good luck!"

Business has been a challenge for camp owners these last few years, stress can take us into dangerous waters, if you catch my drift! Our trip in June was a challenge due to everchanging weather! We still caught enough for a walleye meal each day, plus we brought home our limit, but we only had a few moments of one after another walleyes! Judging from the reports on WC, it had been a tough year, better luck next season!"

Most places you book online for trips have a place to write reviews and I hope this can be the case here. You said nothing in your post that was offensive, but rather what your experience was. If nothing else, they need to learn from it and work to make things better for others. Bravo for not letting it go and letting the rest of us take the good with the bad in the decision making process. You didn't mention fire/smoke as an issue?? Hope that take care of itself up there soon as I have read posts about people being moved to different lakes than what they scheduled."

I brought my wife and two daughters and spent $1600 on a cabin for our summer family vacation. Yes, we were only alotted 2 rolls of toilet paper for 7 days. With 3 gals in camp that was gone the second day. I agree with parajohn that the cabin was clean, but felt for that kind of money my wife shouldn't have to drive into town to buy more, but we did. I emailed the resort before we drove up asking what I need to bring like linens ect and that was never mentioned. We would have gladly packed some had we known. Perhaps I caught them on a bad week, but the resort cabins were 50-60% occupied so the schedule didn't appear to be overbearing. I pulled in there with the family excited and Scott drove by in his pickup, he pulled up and told us we weren't putting the boat in tonight because it could storm. I said that is fine, we can wait til tomorrow. His next sentence was ""Your not tying that barge to my camp dock, I don't need that thing turning my dock into toothpicks. You can tie it up to the far dock down by the boat landing"" I am still waiting for the ""Welcome to Golden Eagle Resort, my name is Scott"" but it never happened. I have a Lund tyee 1950, pretty normal sized rig for Lac Seul sized waters. My wife then tried to make conversation with him by asking if he knew when the storm was supposed to come and his reply was ""Welcome to Canada"". My wife and I have been coming to Lac Seul for 18 years now and have done 15 fly-ins together, this isn't her first ride on the merry-go-round. We just took it in stride. She took the kids to swim, he drove down there and told them not to touch the rocks on the shore and then told my wife there is a public beach in town. That was our first hour at Golden Eagle, take it for what it is. We were told when we booked that they liked to have kids in camp? Part of our cabin package was 75 liters of gas, so on Thursday I saw scott sitting on a bench 20 feet from the dock gas pump and asked him if I could get my fuel. His reply was ""I wish you had said something to me yesterday, I only fill on Monday and Wednesday"" I mentioned that I didn't see that on the camp rules sheet he had hanging in our cabin so he said ""I'll do it this time but for future reference."" I have stayed at many other resorts where someone stops by during your visit just to see how you are doing or how the fishing has been during your stay, that did not happen on this trip. At checkout I pulled out my visa card since there was a big Visa sign hanging on the office and was told to use a personal check or I will be charged 3% to use it. Like parajohn there was no ""thank you"" after payment. I am a small business owner that that also caters to the public, and in no way wish to deface another business but merely wish to share my experience."
