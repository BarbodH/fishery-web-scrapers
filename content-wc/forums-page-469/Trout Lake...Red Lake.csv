We caught most of the fish in 10-14 FOW with jig & yellow twister tipped with a nightcrawler. On the first afternoon of our first trip there we trolled a windblown shoreline and the first 4 fish we caught were 26, 28, 27, 26 inches. During that entire week we caught 3 or 4 fish under 18 inches----tons of 20-22 and lots over 25. I probably have a map at home and if you're interested in more detail let me know via PM."
