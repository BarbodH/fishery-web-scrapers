Dock fishing in chamberlain narrows when I reeled in (unknowingly) this monster. I didnt measure it but guessing about 9-10 inches. Lipped him because he really didn't have many chompers yet!

Both were barely able to get the jig in their mouths. I may have beat them in the biggest fish contest, but they certainly beat me when it came to finesse.81Saluki"

1327567,1shooter,2011-07-08 16:07:00,1493,Here's some good ones. The 2nd one isn't a walleye but thought it was funny considering the muskie lure was bigger than the perch.
1327606,phishfearme,2011-07-08 19:16:00,1242,it's harder to hook these than the big ones! phish
1327635,Glenman12,2011-07-08 21:03:00,762,Caught a tiger musky about 20 yrs ago around that size ...still have the pic somewhere but it was way before digital cameras

1340163,Bill Krejca,2011-08-14 10:19:00,6107,Sort of reminds me of when I used to bow hunt for carp. I always felt that anyone could shoot a big one - it was the tiny ones that required the most skill! Bill Krejca
