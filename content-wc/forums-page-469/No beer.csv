1340404,MrWalleye73,2011-08-15 06:26:00,821,"Yeah, they will fine you good. I know the many times we've been ""pulled"" over on the water (yeah Glenman....they always come to visit us at Mudge's!!), they've told us it's close to $100 per can if found. I know on certain shore lunch days, my group likes a beer batter I make for the fish, and I've carried a can on the boat. The MNR guys don't seem to mind that (yeah, they check the whole boat), seeing that there's three of us in the boat, and there'd be a fight for that one beer if we decided to drink it! LOL. I explain to them what it's for, and they brush it off as not an issue. I know a few guys will buzz across the lake after dinner with a couple beers in the boat, but that's a risk they take."
1340420,Bigfishhunter,2011-08-15 07:07:00,803,"For beer batter shorelunch I use near beer, it works almost as good as the real thing."
1340442,jigfisher9,2011-08-15 08:01:00,23,"I've always been told that it is a $100 per container or serving. I suppose it is up to the official that is writing the ticket as to what constitutes a container. A twelve pack of beer could be 12 individual containers for a $1200 fine or a fifth of whiskey is about 25 oz. which would be 25 one ounce shots so they could fine you $2500. This is just what I have been told by camp owners in the past so don't take this as law. With that being said I wonder if a 16 gallon keg would be $1600 or 170 12oz. equivalents for a fine of $17,000.In my mind it is not worth the risk/reward to even try having a beer or mixer on the water. We do our consumption back at the cabin, and sometimes it is mass consumption if we have a bad weather day."
1340522,wallydave,2011-08-15 12:10:00,2151,"About 10 years ago, at the NW end of Lac Seul, OPP was out checking boats for beer. Clients from every camp were stopped. One party from each camp was fined. My brother-in-law was fined, and has never returned to Canada, keep in mind he has issues with authority, and likes to have his way! One family in our group brings thier sons along, so we don't see the need to have beer in the boat, not the best message to teach our kids! We will have a beer in the fish house along with a couple with the meal, but we do not take beer with us on the lake. Stay safe and live to fish another day!"
1340534,PRO-V1,2011-08-15 12:26:00,142,"Never mind the fines for having beer in the boat guys, here in ontario if you blow over you could get a bui and lose your steering papers for your and car, boats are considered motorized vehicles.Mike"
1340542,hawg,2011-08-15 12:45:00,2008,Stay at Rainy Lake- keep your money with people that want you to be there.
1340545,AllenW,2011-08-15 12:54:00,11482,"Rainy had the same fishing and slot limits I might, till then, no beer in the boat and Canada here we come..I think ProV hit it when he said it can be a BUI and goes against your driving record, least I had a Co up there tell us that once.Not sure if you need to be intoxicated or not though.Al"
1340552,PRO-V1,2011-08-15 13:10:00,142,"Over .08 is intoxicated and will pull your papers, any thing under and they could give 12 hour suspensionMike"
1340835,corvette1,2011-08-16 09:37:00,243,i know for a fact its 210$ per can
1340901,Jig A Lowe,2011-08-16 12:11:00,87,I know a guy who was fishing with his grandfather and they both had open beers and maybe two other beers in the boat. They didn't know that it ws illegal and explained that to the OPP. The operator was fined $150. This occured last summer.
1340181,BURNSEY,2011-08-14 11:33:00,2,Heard you cannot have beer in your boat.Is this true?I like a couple of beers with lunch.Thanks in advance for the replys.
1340231,drew59,2011-08-14 13:51:00,87,True. It's been the law up there for years.
1340259,v-bay gord,2011-08-14 15:13:00,3168,"Apparently the police frown on that. Does it still happen? You bet. Bottom line is be responsible, have fun, be prepared to accept the consequences. By the way I am not advocating drinking in the boat, I just know that some people enjoy a beverage with lunch. Now you know the rules, it is your decision. I think this topic has gone around a few times........."
1340270,Glenman12,2011-08-14 15:56:00,762,Do you know what the fine for that runs?...not that I would ever do that...
1340289,SinOrSwim,2011-08-14 16:57:00,1528,Death by hanging I think?
1340314,v-bay gord,2011-08-14 18:48:00,3168,"I don't really know. Never been an issue for me or guests....but I'm thinking if you were ""over the top"" it might be stiff."
1340318,joeman79,2011-08-14 18:58:00,417,Some guys got checked on fly in lake we went to and they had 14 empty beer cans in the boat and 2 illegal walleye and I head it cost them 1200.00
1340327,MorganMan,2011-08-14 19:27:00,341,Yowza! You better win a lot in poker at night to pay that kinda fine!
1340337,Bill Krejca,2011-08-14 19:49:00,6107,"It cost the guy on the lake I was on last year about $250, according to others in camp. Bill Krejca"
1340340,v-bay gord,2011-08-14 19:55:00,3168,I think that sounds about right........
