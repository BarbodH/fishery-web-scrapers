Be advised, however, that the lakes up there can have a number of unseen reefs and water obstacles. Much more than southern reservoirs. Hazards between islands can be particularly common, as well as way out in the middle of nowhere! Check your game laws, they may not be the same in all places, or what you may be used to. Have fun, and give us a report when you return. Bill Krejca"

The camp you are at should be able to point you to some nearby spots where you will catch fish. You can't go wrong dragging some bottom bouncers and crawler harness's.......use your locator to find fish.....they can be scattered in basin areas, not just on obvious humps."
1340852,oxdrift2,2011-08-16 09:59:00,37,"As far as cell phone, see if the camp you are going to has a pay phone. If they do go to Walmart and get a pre pay phone card. You can use the camp pay phone with the card. that way the cell can stay off and you will save huge money on your bill."
1340693,stevethomps,2011-08-15 20:34:00,105,"all, everything came together last minute and my 16 yr old son and I decided to make a first trip to Canada this Wed Aug 17-Monday Aug 22nd. heading to Eagle lake. Have some questions and would really appreciate some help with a few questions. I'm a total novice at the Canada thing but learn fast so I only looking for a little jump start.1. GPS Chip. I have Lowrance LCX Series locators....what chip would have Eagle Lake on it and where can I get one last minute? Are they genrally available in Canada if I don't have time to get/find one here before I go? 2. Hwy 502 vs. 71/Trans Canada to Eagle Lake- all things considered which is the better route? I understand 71/TransCanada will take maybe an hour longer but wondering about road conditions, pit stops, etc. 3. Cell Phone (tmobile) coverage in Dryden area? Any one have any experince with this? I have just a couple of client calls for work that I should really be on during the week and just have no idea on cell coverage up there in general and tmobile specifically. If it wasn;t such a last minute trip I'd reschedule calls but they were only things I could not shuffle so trying to make work if i can.I know these are kind of random questions but really appreciate any input/comments anyone can help with.If you have any other things you think I should know for my first trip to Canada/eagle Lake I'm all ears.Thanks!"
1340697,jiggster,2011-08-15 20:44:00,183,I do not know about the chip. My son and I like 71 for the reason he liked stopping at the different sport shops to look around. Friends have told me 502 is a good road but not much along the road. I might be concerned about the charges of a cell phone from Canada. Where are you planning on staying? My son and I have fished most of the lake.
1340704,Guest,2011-08-15 21:01:00,0,"I don't have an answer for your Chip...what resort are you going to? Many of the resort owners who do not employ guides will have way points...if you do a search of Eagle Lake post on this site, you may come up with some way points as well. Take 502. We were just on that road 2 weeks ago and it was in the best shape I've seen it...we were even pulling a large trailer and were easily making the speed limit and beyond. You will get coverage in the Dryden and Vermillion Bay area but you will be paying the International Roaming rate unless you have a Global Plan. I have Verizon and they charge .69 a minute for International Roaming. Eagle is a HUGE lake and I would strongly suggest you hire a guide for at least 1 day/2 if you can afford it. Use your GPS and mark all the hotspots they take you too...don't let them see you do it or they'll be sure not to take you to their hotspots (this will cause a little ""reply"" issue with this post, but the truth is the truth). Have fun and wish I was on my way up again! Craig"
1340706,eyemike,2011-08-15 21:07:00,233,"You might try Cabelas for the GPS chip. Either route is good. As the last post stated 71 has towns to stop at along the way. 502 is a long ride with no stops. 502 is quicker. If you can't get a chip for your GPS they sell a pretty good map of the lake at Vermillion Bay. Give a call to the resort you are staying at, they can probably answer most if not all your questions. Good luck fishing.....Mike"
1340710,Skywagon,2011-08-15 21:12:00,1106,"502 is a good road, about 100 miles with no services, no big deal. Fill up with gas at International Falls (it will be a lot cheaper there than Canada) and travel on to Eagle. No idea if Tmobile works there or not, you should call them now to find out. My guess is that cell service will be better on the north side of Eagle, if it is business, the cost of calling should not be a consideration. Cabelas should have the chip, which will include Eagle and some of the big lakes in the area."
1340733,Danbear,2011-08-15 22:45:00,72,"1. I trailer my own boat and 502 has been fine the last few years, 71 is slower but there are places to stop. Nothing on the 502.2. If you are staying on the West Arm PM me and I will give you a few of my spots.3. We will be hitting Eagle on Sept 10th for our 5th time.4. Where are you staying and when are you going ?5. I would agree with the other guys and hire a guide for at least a day. Eagle is big water and can be intimidating, everything looks good and it can be confusing on where to start.6. Make sure you get a Fishing hot spots map.Good Luck and have a great trip."
1340734,Danbear,2011-08-15 22:47:00,72,"ForgotI have US Cellular and the last 2 years my cell phone worked at Birch Dale Lodge what a suprise that was, cost a few bucks but came in clear as a bell."
1340739,gapwedge,2011-08-15 23:15:00,19,"If you are going to use significant cell minutes, I would call your cell provider and determine whether it makes sense to change your plan during the time you are in Canada. I did this with Verizon in advance of my trip. They will help you pick the best plan ahead of time, but once you incur the charges they will rape and pillage with no mercy or shame."
1340771,NARDA 1,2011-08-16 06:31:00,636,"I have T-mobil and haven't had any problems on the north end of eagle lake. The towers are along the 17 and 71, none on the 502 so no service. As far as the roaming charges go, you can go to DMTS Dryden Municipal Telephone 807-223-1100 and purchase a sim card $20 and there pick 6 package for $30 (no contract) it allows you to select 6 telephone numbers in USA or Canada that you then have free unlimited calls to and from. You will also need an unlock code for your phone, just call Tmobile for it. Will save you quite a bit. Have a great trip, you picked a Great Lake!!!!!"
1340788,skindzier,2011-08-16 07:20:00,137,"I have an older Lowrance - the Navionics Hot Maps Premium Canada chip covers Eagle well. I agree with the person earlier who mentioned that Cabelas might have it. Bass Pro might too. As a last resort, if you aren't to get one earlier, the Canadian Tire store in Dryden might have it. I would recommend 71 because there are services and even though it is more populated, I think there is more to look at, simply because 502 is just a path through the trees, so for much of route, that is all you can see. On 71 you go by Lake Of The Woods for long stretches and at one point you have a postcard view of Crow Lake. Also, if you are going to be on 502 in the evening, there's no way you should be going the speed limit, as there are often moose standing in the road & there are a lot of twists & turns with very limited visibility. Bad combination..."
