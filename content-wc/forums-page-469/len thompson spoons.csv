1339839,adempsey,2011-08-12 21:31:00,963,Every Canadian Tire store that I have been to carries a selection of Len Thompson spoons. You should have no trouble locating one somewhere along your route as there is one in almost every large town and city in Ontario.

Like stated above, every canadian tire store, and many gas stations that sell bait also have the Len T's. I prefer the #2 size. I will use the gian #4 every now and then, but the #2 catches everything including walleyes in the weeds. Colour doesn't matter, I like the 5 o' D and my wife likes the classic red stripe on white, but we both catch fish."
