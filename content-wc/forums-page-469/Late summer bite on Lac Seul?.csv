Consistently found fish on breaks and rock piles in 15-25 feet of water. Jigging was effective color didn't really seem to matter. All in all the fishing was great, but I guess that is typical for Lac Seul."

Weather varied throughout trip, but walleye fishing was pretty steady. Color didn't seem to matter much and a little meat (nightcrawler) occasionally helped, but not much of a difference compared to those without. Pretty much jigged."
