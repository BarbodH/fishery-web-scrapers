Luckily caught some very nice smallmouth out of Barrel Lake at the southern end of the big lake , got caught in a severe thunderstorm trying to make it back to camp with my older brother, very dangerous lightning, we found an island an waited it out , it is a memory i will never forget. And i hate to say anything bad about a lake or area, i'm sure it has it's moments, but honestly there is much better fishing on up the road, my advice would be to keep seaeching for other water ."
