1339684,IaDave,2011-08-12 10:12:00,476,Heading up after Labor Day and just wondering about the levels. We stay on Abrams and go thru the chutes to Minnintaki and just wondering waht to expect at the chutes.

1339795,scar,2011-08-12 16:54:00,196,Was up July 31 - Aug 4.We own a place on the lake and looking at the water levels on the docks my guess is over 3' and closer to 4 feet down. Had the boat way over loaded with supplies on the way to the cabin and the chute was frightening. When the water is low it all pours through the area you must ride up. Fishing was outstanding! 20' was the magic number and rock points/bars and humps were very good. All we did was jig with a 1/2 crawler and we boated over 100 eyes each day with a 27'' and a 26'' being our 2 biggest. Lots of slot and over though-probably 15-20 % of our fish!

Many rocks showing up that are not marked. Will not go back until levels are higher. Fishing was poorest in many years of being there. Don't mean to paint a bleak picture just telling you our experience. Best fishing was catching fish on flats in main lake. Other fishing was poor including Red Pine Bay, which has produced in the past."
