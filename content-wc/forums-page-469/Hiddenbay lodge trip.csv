WE KILLED IT FOR 5 DAYS AND CAUGHT FISH WITH LIVE AND ARTIFICIAL BAIT THE FISH DID NOT CARE. WE CAUGHT OVER 500 FISH IN A 5 DAY STAY AND MY 80 YEAROLD FATHER LANDED A 24 INCH WALLEYE WHICH HE PROUDLY DISPLAYED AND THEN RELEASED.MY DAD SAID HE NEVER HAD THIS MUCH SUCCESS FISHING .

I would love to give them a try, but putting a group together is always a challenge, we have a hard time filling a cabin to our drive-in camp, usually the cost is an issue. Maybe someday!"

Nice deal to see the old guys catching fish, and it's been a bigger kick for me watching him catch them than catching them myself. He did it for me as a kid, and started that fire burning, and it's nice to do it for him, and seeing others doing the same. Those are memories, that, sadly, a lot of kids of all ages these days never get to have, so cherish every one, both with your Dad and with your kids. Take a kid fishing, even if he's 80.... Good on ya again."
