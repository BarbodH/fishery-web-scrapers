2481281,jkwildhunting,2014-02-23 19:50:00,361,Only stayed at the motel in Balmertown... But the group we go with now stays at the super 8 which was just built in last few years.The Howey Bay Motel would be a good choice. The resturant is very clean has bar and food is pretty good also. If we have a bad weather day on Gull Rock we usually will always drive up for lunch and get us a Howey Burger!
