2467233,rancocasrich,2014-02-19 14:58:00,45,We spoke with Dave about it and it sounds like a fun adventure. We did not stay there and met no one who stayed there.
2467545,wallydave,2014-02-19 16:53:00,2151,I sent them an email asking about the outpost! After some bumper to bumper spring fishing on Lac Seul outpost and late season trips have a strong appeal!
2476345,Lambertson Rock Guy,2014-02-22 11:50:00,20,"Try Goose Bay or Evergreen. Both have some inexpensive cabins that would work for your group. Both have docks, fish cleaning shacks, bait, gas...pretty much everything you would need."
2477529,8210t,2014-02-22 19:18:00,292,look up pukani or pakuni something like that. talked to a guy the other day that was up there last year said the fishing was nuts.
2464265,walley3,2014-02-18 16:11:00,7,"Looking for a place to stay, somewhere between Dryden and Ear Falls.I'll be taking my own boat with 2-4 people. Walleye and Northern are the name of the game, doesn't have to be fancy just good enough to keep most of the mosquito's and bears out. Has to be a dock and no meal plan. Is there any place that would do it for less than $900 for 6-7 nights for the whole group and im not talking $900 per person.Any recommendations? thanks"
2464337,revitup,2014-02-18 16:27:00,140,"Is this 1964? Sorry--read your post wrong! Thought you were trying to get 6-7 guys up there for a week for less than $900. Hope you find something. Possibly later in the season, when the lodges do specials to fill their camps."
2464465,wallydave,2014-02-18 17:00:00,2151,Check your pm!
2464505,Carnhzkr,2014-02-18 17:09:00,964,"You'd have to find some place that rents the cabin per night, as opposed to per person per night. There may be some like that, but I don't know of them. You could also consider staying in a hotel. I think the hotel at the intersection of 17 and 105 in Vermilion Bay cost me around $90 for two people last year. You could use that as a base and fish Eagle and many surrounding lakes. Come to think of it, they had a few cabins out back. That might fit your bill. I remember the owner told me that fisherman bring their boats up and user her cabins as a base. I'll bet she's pretty cheap. Lone Pine or something Pine. Google hotels in Vermilion Bay - there's only two of them. A buddy of mine used to stay at a camp right on 105. It's about 18 miles north of V Bay, on the west side of the road. Just a little place with a few cabins. It's the place that when you drive by it, you wonder where the water is, because you can't see any water from the road, just the cabins (anyone know the place I'm talking about?). They stayed there because it's cheap and they would launch at the public ramp on Lac Seul, about 30 miles north. I'll repost if I find the name of the place."

2465313,Guest,2014-02-18 20:10:00,0,Gold Pines in Ear Falls!
2465401,HeHooksHimself,2014-02-18 20:29:00,725,"This is the Pine Grove Motel. We stay with Gail and Brad for the night before we go into the camp for the week. They usually charge about $40/ guy so its not cheap, but it is part of our routine. We rest up, eat a good dinner and breakfast and then go into our camp about 45 min. up the road. We also have our poker game to determine sleeping and chore choices. We usually eat at Buster's since the Village Corner burnt down. Can be pricey but its pretty good. We like the Poutine, but they won't poutinize your breakfast. We had an interesting experience at the Middle of Nowhere Coffee shop and Bakery, I will have to share that one some time."
2465425,Carnhzkr,2014-02-18 20:33:00,964,The place I was trying to think of is Pickerel Creek Camp. Their website says $375 pp/pw.
2467113,rancocasrich,2014-02-19 13:53:00,45,I have stayed at Pickerel Creek Camp. Dave ? is a very good host. The cabins are nice and he goes out of his way to make you satisfied. Our group liked the place but decided we wanted to stay at a place that is on the water. We got tired on trailering the bat every day. The advantage is that we also got to fish different water every day if we chose. We switched to Rainbow Point just up the road. Pickerel creek Camp is a nice place.
2467153,wallydave,2014-02-19 14:07:00,2151,Has anyone stayed at the outpost mentioned on their website?
