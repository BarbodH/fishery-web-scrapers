2474689,Rich B,2014-02-21 21:05:00,1081,"Loved the ""dog-sled race""....thanks for sharing (shameless plug or not for the local Kinsmen club - ha).....what Larry said is true....you have a country that is beautiful when it's green or when it's covered with snow (though I love it when it's green and the waters are sky blue).Rich B"

2475169,NWwalleye,2014-02-22 06:26:00,223,Great video Gord... the 48th Vermilion Bay Kin Karnival ... What a great tradition !!!!
