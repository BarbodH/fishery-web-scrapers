2215362,pwbmlr,2013-11-11 18:44:00,37,"Thanks to all of you that responded to my last post asking for advice and where to go on our first fly in trip. Special thanks to solopaddler for all your help. We are schedule to go to anjigaming lake via Parks on May 24th. This may be a little early to start planing but I am pretty Anal and like to get all my ducks in a row well in advance. Since I am the organizer for my group of 4 I am looking for advice as to what to bring as far as food, gear and clothing. I know the basics like passports, warm clothes,rain gear but what else at wouldn't be obvious? As far as fishing gear I am assuming mostly jigs with a few spoons and crank baits would work? How about live bait this early? Just worms or should we order some minnows also? FYI- one of the reasons we picked Parks (other than solopadder's recommendation) was that out of the 5 or so outpost I reached out to Martin from Parks was the nicest and most helpful out of all of them. I must have asked him 30 questions and after every response he would tell me to keep asking questions until I have them all answered. The other outpost I emailed gave one word answers and didn't offer any other tips or suggestions outside of what I asked."
2215410,Duflebag,2013-11-11 19:04:00,218,"My reply is in a thread I wrote earlier this year. I hope it helps a little. Have a great time on your trip. I think planning sure helps you make it through the winter. Here you go:This will be my 24th trip to Northwinds Canadian Outfitters this year. I have taken both of my sons and many friends to visit the Munford family for the first time through the years. One constant question is what do I need to bring with me? I will attempt to answer this question the best I can using what I have learned through many years of fishing in Northwest Ontario and valuable experience shared by Brad and Scott Munford. First I want to say that those who know me will tell you that I don't necessarily follow everything I am going to tell you. You don't need to bring every piece of fishing tackle you own with you. Less is better, bring what you need and get to know how to use the tackle and techniques thoroughly. The better you know how to use your gear the better your chances are for locating and catching fish in a changing structure or pattern. Fishing in Northwest Ontario typically involves four species; walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass and musky. Generally speaking, you can successfully fish for all four species with two outfits. One spinning rig for Walleye and smallmouth bass and one bait casting rig for casting to northern pike and musky. As one gets more experienced you can add more specialized gear for specific species and patterns but you can catch the fish of a lifetime with just two good outfits. Of course equipment often does break making backup outfits a good idea. For those learning to fish the area, a shared use of backup equipment is a good idea. For walleye and smallmouth bass fishing a spinning rig is the way to go. A good quality 6 to 7 foot graphite medium light spinning rod with a fast action tip will work well. This is one area where buying higher quality equipment results in catching more fish. Many times fishermen miss walleye hits because they hit so light. A lack of sensitivity in the rod results in the fisherman not feeling the light tap of a walleye taking a minnow. I have seen many times a fisherman missing several walleye strikes changing to a more sensitive rod suddenly catching significantly more fish simply because they could feel bites they missed with the less sensitive rod. I recommend a minimum of an IM7 medium light spinning rod. A good quality spinning reel with a good drag in a 100 or 200 size is perfect for catching both walleye and smallmouth bass. Line capacity of 125 to 200 yards of 8 pound test is what you are looking for. To me one issue that takes a high priority in my tackle decisions is weight. I will be holding this outfit in my hand for many hours. The lighter the better on my hands, wrists, shoulders and back after many hours of casting and jigging. There are several store brand rods sold by Gander Mountain, Bass Pro Shops and Cabelas that are not expensive and are of a high quality. Shimano Spirex or Sahara and the Pflueger Supreme or President are all good quality reels that are not too expensive. For a few more dollars, A Pflueger Patriarch or St Croix Stradic matched up to a St Croix Premier rod would be a good combination. For fishing line, 8 pound test in green is a good choice. I personally have used Trilene XT in 8 pound green for many years and are happy with the performance. For northern pike and musky casting heavier bait casting rig is required. Again, you will be making many casts with this outfit so weight is important. You can really tire out your hands, wrists, shoulders and back while casting. A graphite 6 ½ to 7 foot medium heavy trigger casting rod with a fast action tip is a good starting rod for casting to both northern pike and musky. A heavier action bait-casting reel is needed to muscle in a big aggressive musky. Shimano Compre or St Croix musky Mojo or premier rods are good choices. A good starting reel choice would be an Abu Garcia C3 or C4 in the 5600 or 6500 size. These rods and reels have all proven themselves through the years to be tough and good for years of use. For fishing line, 80 or 100 pound test braid is a good choice. There are many brands of good quality braid line available. I have seen spiderwire stealth and power pro used commonly. For the size reels I have recommended a 300 yard spool is needed. Let's discuss the terminal tackle you will need to bring next. As I discussed earlier, we tend to bring a lot more than we will ever use. Many folks bring enough lures and tackle to fish one of the bass tournaments you see on TV. At the end of their fishing trip to Canada they realized that very little tackle was actually used to catch hundreds of fish with many of them trophy size. The truth is a small box will get you by in Canada. Sure you can bring the latest lures and try them out. You might catch fish but in my experience, I consistently catch more and bigger fish by using the simple techniques suggested by my guides. Jigs, hooks, sinkers and swivels in a small box will catch all the walleye and smallmouth bass I can handle. A few casting lures will work fine for catching a lot of northern pike and musky casting. Sure there are a lot of lures you can collect for musky and pike fishing but we are talking about what a person coming up for the first time should bring. Jigs in a few sizes for jigging for walleye and Smallmouth bass with the occasional hungry northern pike and musky causing havoc and excitement. Colors aren't as important as a quality hook in jigs. I have seen too many really nice fish lost because of a hook breaking or bending on a cheap jig. I have also seen just as many fish caught on plain lead unpainted jigs as fancy colors through the years. Sure there are sometimes where a particular color seems to catch more fish but not enough to require every color. I would rather spend my money on a jig with a quality hook built in that will not fail and cause me to lose a fish of a lifetime. For the most part an assortment of lead jigs with the majority in 1/4 and 3/8 ounce with a few in 1/8 and 1/2 ounce sizes is what you need. Bring enough for the week, as you will lose a lot to snags in rocks. The other rig you will use for walleye and smallmouth bass fishing is a live bait or lindy rig. Very simply, a lindy rig uses a sinker with a hole that allows line to run through it, a swivel to stop the sinker from sliding to the hook, a leader and a hook. I bring both number 1 and number 2 circle hooks and J hooks for lindy rigs. For sinkers, either walleye sinker or egg sinkers in 1/4, 3/8 and 1/2 ounce sizes. The items you should bring for casting to northern pike and musky are pretty simple for your first trip. A few 12-inch musky leaders in either fluorocarbon or wire with good cross lock snaps. A few 9-inch original bull dawgs. Walleye, black with orange tail and twinkie are traditionally good colors. 9-inch original suick thrillers. Black is the most used with fire tiger being next. A large one-ounce musky sized spinner bait with black skirt and nickel blades. One item that every person coming to Canada for a fishing trip should bring is a good rain suit. I have spent some wonderful weeks fishing in Canada where I have spent the entire week wearing my rain suit. Because I have worn decent rain suits through the years, those weeks have been pleasurable experiences rather than wet and cold ones. You don't need to spend a fortune. Good affordable rain suits like frogg toggs won't break the bank and will keep you dry if needed. When buying a rain suit think about being in that suit for a full day. Buy a suit that is made of breathable material. A rain suit that is not breathable will be miserable when worn for hours. When packing clothing for the trip think changing weather conditions. A day fishing in Canada might start out cold and rainy and turn hot and sunny mid day. The opposite can be true. Nothing makes a day fishing more unpleasant than not having appropriate clothes for the weather. Just because it is summer and there have been temperatures in the 100's does not mean that you won't see cold days in the 40's when you get there. Bring clothes from shorts and tee shirts to long pants and sweat shirts. Layers that can be added or taken off are the best bet as the conditions often change during the day. A dry bag of some type is also recommended. Something like a water proof gym bag to put your camera, sun block, extra clothes and other items. When I say waterproof I do not mean water-resistant. If water can get through or into something, it will on a fishing boat. A good pair of polarized sunglasses is a necessity. In sunglasses you get what you pay for. A good pair of sunglasses will allow you to see fish you will miss with a cheaper pair. You don't have to spend a fortune. There are many Internet articles on the subject and many great glasses for not a lot of money. Next to your tackle sunglasses are the next most important, especially when casting. Other items brought are up to the individual. Remember, you have to carry what you bring and it has to fit in the boat with the guide, fishermen and fishing tackle. Think what you need and what you will use, not what you have and can possibly bring. Some items to think of are a decent camera. Remember, it may get wet, sunscreen, insect repellant, a good knife, needle nose pliers or multitool, toilet paper in a plastic bag (several times vital), pain relievers like aspirin, ibuprofen or acetaminophen, fishing towel (you will get slimed), gloves, a hat to screen the sun and a spare, Extra line, back up fishing tackle (things will break, get lost and go over the side), something to drink both on the boat and at night in the cabin, snacks if you want them, a cooler for your drinks and to bring fish home (for on the boat, smaller is better), your passport for the border, clothes from shorts and tee shirts to long johns, long sleeve shirts, sweat shirts, jacket and spare shoes or boots because they may get wet. The last thing to bring is a good attitude. Leave work and problems at home, you are on vacation. Enjoy the scenery. Look for the wildlife. Learn to be a better fisherman from your guide. Share stories with your friends. Bring your children and grandchildren so that they can enjoy this wonderful experience. Life is much faster paced these days. Going on a fishing trip to Northwest Ontario forces you to slow down, enjoy the day going on around you and enjoy the people you are with."
2217402,pwbmlr,2013-11-13 07:38:00,37,"Any reason why most of you that replied use spinning rods in Canada? I fish Lake Erie and pretty much exclusively use either my ML St Croix Legend Extreme or M Legend casting rods. I also own a few spinning but prefer to use casting rods when I walleye fish. Just wondering if it is just your preference or if I am missing an advantage to using a spinning rod? Thanks for all your responses. I pretty much have everything you guys listed, ie- Muck boots, Full rain suit, a ton of jigs, spoons. I will be sure to share all this info with the rest of my group.Oh one last question, I saw on Park's website that they now Fly out of Canada Airventures. It states that it is 2 hours closer than Wawa for people from the US. I googled it and it looks like it will take us an extra 2.5 hours MORE to get there from Cleveland... Maybe I am just not looking at the right location? If anyone has info on this it would be great. If not, I know I could just Email Park's and ask them also."
2217434,jambi,2013-11-13 08:11:00,504,"I like to use really light jigs, mostly 1/8oz. If 15' deep or more I will use 1/4oz. Spinning gear is more sensitive for me with the light stuff. When casting for switch over to the bait casting setups."
2217554,tooski,2013-11-13 09:14:00,393,"In regards to the flight- they are referring to people from the Eastern US. You are correct, Hawk Air is much closer for Ohioans. I received your mail today and will be sending maps of Anji soon."
2219826,Tylumps,2013-11-14 14:57:00,73,"Hello,Here are my tips.Take jig heads, slip bobbers and Rapala's for Walleye. In May, the walleyes are in close to shore or near where a river dumps in. The walleye's will also be chasing minnow's because the minnow's want the warmer water for what minnow's eat. Bring minnow's if you can, catch minnow's if you can or use the Rapala's in a pinch. Bring worms too, you may burn through your minnows pretty quick if the bite is good. Have them fly some minnows in on your check flight if they provide that service.If you were going in June or July I would say you can forget the minnows because the walleye will have moved on to bugs, leaches and worms after the May Fly hatch. Minnows will always work, it just so expensive and hard to manage minnows.Best advise is to bring a really good rainsuit and water proof footwear. I use the rainsuit just to keep the heat in and the cold wind out. Have a great time. Stay Dry!!!!!"
2220018,Bill Krejca,2013-11-14 19:17:00,6107,"Just another thought on the food:One trip, although I had planned the meals fairly carefully for the week, it turned out that the rest of the guys each decided to bring a special meal treat for one meal. At the end of the week, we had an absolute abundance of food left over. Lesson:It is important to communicate how much food is being brought, by all in the party, and plan accordingly. Bill"
2224633,beerman69,2013-11-18 08:06:00,15,"Nice, we are heading into the same lake the 3rd week of June... Please leave us some fish..Could you please send me a few maps of the lake? Thanks"
2237050,RickOnt,2013-11-24 11:05:00,217,As for Flying out of Chapleau or Hawk Junction Martin will try to coordinate flights so as the group inbound and outbound are out of the same base. Saves planes flying empty and likely saves him a few buck$
2237961,bob888,2013-11-25 06:31:00,244,"For warmth and foot dryness I've used Neos overshoes for over a decade. They go on over your shoes easily. Yes, they are bulky, however, I fish primarily for smallies on LOW and am standing on the casting deck running a trolling motor for hours. And, have not had a problem."
2493570,sek2691,2014-02-26 17:26:00,15,"To save weight we freeze anything that can be frozen and use it for ice in the perishable cooler (eggs, milk, condensed juice, etc.). We have a good cooler we use for that and have gone up a day ahead and still have frozen stuff left. According to http://www.askthemeatman.com/ you can refreeze meat as long as it stays cold (we do it every year). I also bought a gallon of walleye minnows (1200 -1300) for $65.00 and salted them this way. http://www.midwestoutdoors.com/magaz...alted-Minnows/At $4.00 a dozen for live bait, that saved us hundreds for the bait and we didn't have to add the water for the minnows to our weight limit. I have fished in Canada for 30 years with live minnows and had just as much luck with the salted ones. My son and I caught over 100 in a hour on them and they worked all week. The place we went to didn't allow live minnows. http://www.saslodge.com/ The salted minnow work much better then live Night Crawlers. Have a great trip and eat fish every night!!!"

2215714,kzoofisher,2013-11-12 04:29:00,5144,"Good advice from Duflebag, I would only add a few things:1. It's going to be cold in May, especially the water. On a fly-in you won't be bathing much so be honest about how dirty/smelly you can put up with and bring enough underclothes to deal with it. Being able to wear the same top layers for days saves a lot of packing space. A package of baby wipes is also essential if you need to wash when it is 50 degrees out and the lake is 40. Some base layers can be washed and will dry overnight, consider those.2. Choose the softest soft plastics because when the water is cold the plastic gets stiffer and lose action at slow speeds. There's a thread in Strictly Fishing about soft plastics and the one thing it makes clear is that there are a lot of good baits out there. If you want to be sure about them buy a small pack and put them in your fridge, that's what they'll be like in May. Softer plastics don't last as long though so get as many as you think you need and then get 30% more. If you and your buddies get together on this you can buy in bulk and split them up which saves a surprising amount. The difference between buying a bunch of 25 packs of each color for yourself versus splitting 100 packs is worth doing the math. Very often your local store won't have enough stock to fill your order all at once so pick out what you want early and order it. My local shop gives my a break if I tell them in January what I want and they can include my stuff in a general order, that way I get what I want at a price that usually beats most of the big name places and keeps my money in town and helping out he guy who is there for me day in and day out.3. You don't have enough jigs. Figure on at least 5 doz per size because the other guys aren't going to bring enough. That's about 4.5# for 1/8-1/2 oz but you can sell any extras to the other guys when they run out. I don't actually bring that many 1/2 and I bring more 1/8 and 1/4 but I know the rate I go through them. If you know somebody with a lead pot and mold try pouring your own, you'll save a lot of money for much better quality hooks.4. Minnows. It's too cold for worms and leeches. Figure out how to best keep them alive so you have less waste. Buddy of mine has a sturdy minnow basket he built and can anchor near shore. He uses it to pack the dry goods in. Parks probably has some good advice on this.Enjoy the planning and the trip!"
2215914,Bill Krejca,2013-11-12 07:17:00,6107,"All good suggestions. Regarding rain gear - one thing to remember is that water runs downhill. That means that the rain repelled from your state-of-the-art rain suit mostly ends up at your feet. Folks that are able to wear tennis shoes in the rain are a lot tougher than I can imagine, however, many times this seems to be the shoe of choice while fishing. Leather high top shoes coated with a water repellent work well for me. Rubber boots are even better. Just another thing to think about. Have fun! Bill"
2216122,SinOrSwim,2013-11-12 10:02:00,1528,"Second, third and fourth on the rain gear. In my opinion, you need bib overalls for the lower half of your rain gear. Sitting in those boats your coat will ride up and you end up getting a bunch of water down your backside. Good point on the boots. I take very lightweight over boots to put over my shoes. Easy to keep in the dry bag.One other thing I do now. It is COLD in the morning when we go and HOT in the afternoon. I wear shorts every single day and wear my rain pants as my pants in the morning. If it stays cold, rain bibs stay on. Gets hot, take the rain pants off and I have shorts. Dress in layers.If you are drinkers, figure out how much beer/booze you want and add extra. It stinks running out of beer on a fly-in. Factor in things like beer batter etc. Food. Decide on a menu and write down everything needed. Prepare as much as you can prior to going up. Have one person responsible for this. Pack meats frozen in cooler and use that for ice for things like lettuce, milk and eggs.Pack everything in containers/bags of some sort. It is embarrassing handing the flight crews loading planes a random jacket or pillow etc. LOL Been there.Make a list of everything you are going to take and check it off. Stinks getting up there and forgetting something.You will over pack. Do you know the policy of over weight charges? Our outfitter didn't charge. They just flew extra weight in on a later flight. So. we made sure to pack what we needed for the first day in a separate bag so we could fly out and beer and other heavy things could fly in later. Example. my brother packed his rain gear in a different bag. It came in on a later flight. And, yes it rained while we were fishing before the second plane came in. LOL"
2216146,chris.brock,2013-11-12 10:14:00,112,"Can't go wrong with Martin and Parks,I wouldn't bother with bringing minnows, maybe worms to tip your jigs, we have never brought any live bait on a fly-in and have never regretted it, you could bring a minnow trap as insurance thoughbring a water filter pump, someone in your party may already have one if they are into hiking/ portaging, for $70 it will last you for years and most importantly it saves weight on the plane, we've never got sick using this systemhttp://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/ka...-0760101p.htmlI bring a pair of rubber boots and a pair of sport sandals for footwearbug spray and bug jackets, the black flies could be bad"
2216194,JayM5209,2013-11-12 10:34:00,1050,"In addition to all the good recommendations offered by others:1) If your group likes to sit around a camp fire in the evening, take a small camp axe, or at least a small folding pack saw.2) DO NOT forget 2 or 3 mouse traps or some rodenticide. It's amazing how much sleep you can lose because the mice are rattling around your food bags and boxes at 2 a.m. . . . . . or are running laps on your bed!!"
2216786,Blades-n-Beads,2013-11-12 18:03:00,484,"I would love to offer my advise on gear to pack BUT I am a serious over packer! If I have an empty 2"" space, I will find something to fill the gap, I also am the organizer of our group. Needless to say I have it all covered on our trips. Hope you enjoy your trip."
2216802,Mike Borger,2013-11-12 18:11:00,1554,"You're going to love Anjigaming! That's a great time of year as well imo.I'm right in the middle of steelhead season at the moment, in fact I'm heading out the door shortly for a 4 day road trip to Michigan (love this time of year)When I have time I'll shoot you a pm and go over all of your questions. Can mark a map for you as well.Cheers, Mike"
2217306,new hips,2013-11-13 07:06:00,498,"You will be overweight believe me. Start now with your fishing gear and weigh it. You can fly in your beer or soda before hand. What about portable fish locators & GPS......figure on eating fish a lot, saves on food weight. I'm a firm believer in using the best terminal tackle you can find, snaps, leaders,swivels, I use Fireline or Power Pro on all reels. Take 8-10lb fluorocarbon for leaders. X10 for the dry bag & rain gear and rubber boots. Check with other guys and avoid duplicate items, it all adds up. I take 3 rods 2 spinning 1 casting ML ML MH......if possible 1 extra reel. You can get all the walleye you want with a Lindy Rig with or without a floating jighead. Spoons should be the ticket for early Northern. If I was going to take bait it would be salted Minnows, they work great, plus you keep them frozen. I make a menu for the week and figure in all fish meals. Find some smaller sturdy boxes for the plane and label them. It's impossible to be under weight believe me."
