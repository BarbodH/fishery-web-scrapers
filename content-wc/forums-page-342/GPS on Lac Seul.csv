2464801,zeebee,2014-02-18 18:18:00,1144,The Etrex series are wonderful handhelds. Very user friendly. I picked up a 10 series for my fly-in trips on sale for under a $100. The batts last a long time (got a full week outta one set of AA's) and they are very quick and super accurate.
2466681,jimmie,2014-02-19 11:22:00,123,"Its Canada converted English for ""rocks"". Not all can be maked but it seems to me if you stay in the middle of the noral navigation treks you should be safe. One thing we all muct remember. Lac seul is a resevoir. Water fluctuating sometimes more than 10 feet depending upon time of year. Water should be fairly deep and safe early this year as the snowfall had been substantial. I( bought my Navionics hotmaps Premium lakes North Chip last year and it has the lower NW Ontario lakes on it. Most all will have prominent reefes, sunmen Islands ect noted as will hand held maps. Good luck. Just ask the one selling what your chip has on it."
2485097,KHedquist,2014-02-24 19:37:00,4367,You can download or save the map to mobile device and if your phone is capable of using gps you can use your mobile device. SonarCharts are now available in Canada. I will post some screen shots Here are FAQ on Mobile Apps http://www.navionics.com/en/faq/409
2456737,Jwendt15,2014-02-16 11:25:00,72,"Heading out to Lac Seul for the first time the week of June 7. Could not be more excited! I am debating if I should purchase a handheld GPS or try using the Navionics app on my smarthphone (Samsung S4). From what I am told, the GPS tracking still works on the S4 even if you do not have cell coverage. Has anyone had any experience with this? I have a USA sprint plan if that helps. I am just concerned about relying on my phone and not having it work when we get there. However, the $200-300 needed to spend on a decent handheld GPS is steep as well! Thank you for any guidance you can provide."
2457033,Carnhzkr,2014-02-16 13:41:00,964,"I researched this last year. From what I learned, for the GPS app to work, you can be out of range to make or receive calls, but you still need to be able to hit a cell tower. The owner of Lac Seul Lodge told me that people used the app and reported it worked well. I ended up not using it. I borrowed a Etrex 20 and bought the chip. You will need a data plan that works in Canada, or you'll incur some big charges. My cell was off, but I've read on this board that people have been able to make calls while on the lake, although it's sporadic. I would highly advise using some type of GPS with mapping on Lac Seul."
2457089,SinOrSwim,2014-02-16 13:55:00,1528,"Lac Seul is easy to navigate. Or, use some bread crumbs. j/k. I don't take my phone out there because I don't want something to happen to it. But, my brother had his with him last year and actually took a call from his brother in law. Personally, I'd either find one to borrow or buy a hand held. Or, get a fish finder that has GPS on it and kill two birds with one stone. I would definitely make sure what I had was reliable and not roll the dice with a phone that may or may not work for you. Some people are really good at reading a map and knowing where they are. I'm okay if I'm paying attention to where I'm going to start but I have found if I have been fishing for awhile I don't pay as close attention. Can easily get confused if you have a map only and that is one big body of water. Plus, I like having the line my GPS puts on the screen. I can then follow it back knowing I am using a safe route that has no rocks."
2457177,rather-be-fishin,2014-02-16 14:34:00,429,"GPS is a must have for Lac Suel safe navigation. Also, you need a good lake map chip. Not sure where you live, but the Navionics North Region chip has the major Ontario Canadian lakes North of MN including Lac Seul & also has ND, SD, MN, IOWA, WI, some MI & parts if Lake Superior & Lake Michigan on it. Well worth the money. Are you bringing your own boat or using a resort boat? You also need a good depth finder/fish finder too. To have a combo depth/fish finder & GPS unit would be great too! Lac Seul is a BIG lake has MANY unmarked rock hazards, so having a good map & safe travel route is very important for a successful trip. What part of the lake are you going too? Where are you staying? It's a FANTASTIC lake to fish! Have a great trip! 160 days & counting down to our 10th year fishing trip to Lac Seul!!! RBF"
2459369,bob888,2014-02-17 09:52:00,244,I may be wrong (hope I am) but I thought that the more recent Navionics North chips no longer includes lakes in Canada. There is a specific chip just for Canada.
2460385,SinOrSwim,2014-02-17 15:28:00,1528,"Not sure but when I bought mine a a couple years ago the hotmaps North/Midwest had the big lakes in CAnada like Lac Seul but the PREMIUM edition did not. It is extremely confusing buying those chips on line. I went to Bass Pro and they had a demo version of all the chips. We were able to put the different chips in a finder and tinker with which lakes were on there etc. Worked out well because it saved me $50.00 AND I got the lakes I wanted at home in addition to Lac Seul.Also, I marked way points as we followed one of the guides from our lodge out one day. If the power gets disconnected from my finder the line goes away but the way points don't. I have tried to mark different areas with way points so I have a safe route. Then, STICK to those routes even if it takes a little longer"
2460481,Blades-n-Beads,2014-02-17 15:45:00,484,"Bob888, I believe your correct, navionics has separate chip for US north and Canada we have to buy both separate ."
2461785,rather-be-fishin,2014-02-17 21:41:00,429,"""but when I bought mine a couple years ago the hotmaps North/Midwest had the big lakes in CAnada like Lac Seul but the PREMIUM edition did not."" I must have bought the same Hot Maps North chip as you, because mine has Lac Seul, LOTW, Rainey, Eagle on it plus all the other States I mentioned above! Glad I got that one & didn't have to buy a Canada chip. Although I also have an old Canada chip too. :-). Too bad if the new North Chip doesn't include those big lakes in Canada. RBF"

2462705,Jwendt15,2014-02-18 08:07:00,72,"That was my concern, especially for the first time. It seems like the lake can be very confusing to navigate and I have heard there are numerous ""danger"" areas with rocks. We are staying at Evergreen Lodge and will be using their boats. Fortunately they do have fish finders equipped on them, seemed like really nice boats from the description and pics. Any GPS units you guys recommend under $200? I wouldn't be opposed to buying something used on eBay for the right price. How did that Etrex 20 work out for you?"
