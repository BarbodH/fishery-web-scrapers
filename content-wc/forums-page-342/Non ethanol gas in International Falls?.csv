2478313,NWE,2014-02-23 06:52:00,13,"For those in the Perrault Falls / Ear Falls area, Dutchie's sells only premium, non-ethanol gas due to the amount of boats coming through. Prices are fair too (as fair as gas prices can be)."
2478969,stillangling,2014-02-23 09:45:00,149,"Not really answering your question but I thought others would be interested. The Canadian Tire gas bar in Kenora sells ethanol free regular - 87 octane. Most outboards don't need the higher octane but the recommendation to buy premium normally is there to avoid ethanol. It is my understanding that the Safeway gas station in Dryden is the only other spot west of Thunder Bay that carries ethanol free regular gas. I don't know about the Dryden station but the one in Kenora has a constant flow of boats and snowmobiles on trailers going through it to avoid that ""green"" ethanol c@@&p"

2148425,lassh,2013-10-04 21:24:00,553,Does anyone know if any of the gas stations in Int. Falls carries gas without ethanol? Thanks for the help.
2148433,JDP,2013-10-04 21:32:00,1457,"Yes,just as in come into town there is a Mobil branded station that has 92 Non Oxy.The name is: THE FISHERMAN, 100 MEMORIAL DR, INTERNATIONAL FALLS, MN 56649Located next to The Chocolate Moose Restaurant on Hwy 53 (Memorial Drive)."
2148441,GNO,2013-10-04 21:35:00,153,Koerters BP also has it and is right on the way just past Mc Donalds. Great owner and he enjoys talking fishing.
2148505,lassh,2013-10-04 22:28:00,553,Thanks for the responses gentlemen.
2151081,bigwalleye1,2013-10-06 15:52:00,2632,+1 for GNO's post. Great little restaurant right across the side street. Out of the BP and into the restaurant lot for breakfast on the ride north.
2157026,milfish,2013-10-09 10:04:00,249,"Korner Kwik Stop, 3467 Hwy 53 South 56649, about 8 miles south of I Falls has good premium with no ethanol. Right on the curve where Minn. 97 intersects with 53. Easy in and out. Been using it for over 15 years on my way in. The people are also very friendly, the have flats of crawlers and a limited bait selection. I will always go there on my way up and on my way back to gas up. Also, right on the bottom of their credit card receipt it is printed: ""Thank You and remember to uphold our Constitution"". I like to patronize patriots.Milfish"

2171114,milfish,2013-10-17 10:27:00,249,"Jay, When we bought them they were packaged correctly. We did call ahead to make sure they had a flat for transport to Canada though.Milfish"
