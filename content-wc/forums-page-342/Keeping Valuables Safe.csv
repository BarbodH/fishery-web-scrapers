I've always been very concerned about this. I pack all of my gear in the back of my pickup with a vinyl tonneau cover. The tailgate locks, but anyone with a pocket knife could get in if they wanted to. I always take my rods and other valuables into the hotel, but still, someone just making the effort to take a look and see if you have anything worth stealing would really put a damper on a trip.I've only had one issue. It was on the trip home two years ago. We were driving a Trailblazer at that time with a hauler on the tailgate. We'd taken our valuables into the room (or so we thought), but moved the totes from the tailgate into the Trailblazer, so it was stuffed with plastic totes and duffles. The next morning I noticed some of the dirty clothes had been removed from one of the totes and sitting on the driver's seat. As I looked around, I began to realize that someone had broken into the vehicle. There were no broken windows or areas where I could see a lock had been jimmied or pryed open. I couldn't swear to it, but I was 95% sure I had locked the vehicle. After taking an inventory, the only things missing were a cheap GPS unit ($120), My son's IPOD, and his wallet that had $50 in it. All of my reels were still stashed into dirty socks at the bottom of the tote containing a week's worth of stinky clothes. I could see they'd opened that tote, but chose not to dig into it. All in all, it could have been a lot worse, but it's an odd feeling of being violated.I filed a police report and the policeman told me they'd had a lot of break ins in the downtown area. Someone was using a device to open vehicles with keyless entry. I felt safe parking below the Hilton in a well-lit parking garage. I guess you can't be too careful."

We always try and park where we can see the truck from the restaurant, and in a well lit and busy area. We usually are towing a boat with all kinds of stuff just sitting in it uncovered and unlocked. As long as we keep it in sight at all times, we feel pretty comfortable nothing is going to happen. If we were to spend the night somewhere, we'd have to re-think it."

2475601,ifish267,2014-02-22 08:17:00,253,I bring a baby monitor if im going going somewhere im not sure of. I know some guys use the two way radios they use for hunting if it has the voice activated feature. For forty bucks it gives me a little peace of mind.
2482633,Bill Krejca,2014-02-24 08:49:00,6107,"Re: baby monitor - How is the transmitter (the unit in the vehicle) powered? The ones I have seen are plug into the wall units. A few years ago, on one of my far north Manitoba trips, the camp owner told about the guests who arrived at camp, only to discover all of their tackle, which had been in the boat was missing. The thieves had gotten in to the boat at the overnight motel, removed what they wanted, and carefully replaced the cover, leaving the theft to be found out the following day. Bill"
2483409,feathersandfins,2014-02-24 12:11:00,10,"When we drove to Alaska to catch the Red Salmon run, we used this wireless driveway sensor (mounted the transmitter to the wood rack on the truck, the receiver was inside the camper with us). Only one time did we have someone scope out the contents of the truck and we knew it. Both transmitter and receiver are battery operated.http://www.sportsmansguide.com/net/c....aspx?a=604949 We use this unit for its intended purpose (a driveway sensor), just took it with us on this trip. Worked for us because we already had it. Don't know it if makes sense to purchase it just to guard your stuff, but we were sure glad we had it."

2488297,ImpactFishing,2014-02-25 14:45:00,446,I have a motion activated alarm mounted to a piece of 2x4. Hopefully it scares them away when it goes off.
