2488785,btyreprich,2014-02-25 16:44:00,1067,Same lake at same time of the year- Lac Seul in late July. Trying a new lodge in the Ear Falls area to save $. In today's economy I feel fortunate to be able to make this trip.
2489561,Glenman12,2014-02-25 19:21:00,762,"same place, same time....Cedar Lake 3rd Sat in June and its a drive to/boat in.."
2486049,port1042,2014-02-25 06:00:00,509,Same plans as last year. Memorial Day week and Labor Day week on Perrault Lake. Drive-in.
2486121,Bigstorm,2014-02-25 06:33:00,799,"Same as last year, just different timing. English River by Grassy Narrows for a week in late July, then Rainy Lake for 4 days in early October"
2486289,REG,2014-02-25 07:24:00,445,"We drive up to Snake Falls Camp on Pakwash every year. I just sent the deposit yesterday. Looking forward to it as I do every year! We had a pretty long and cold winter last year as I recall, and it was one of our best fishing years ever. So as tired of winter as I am, it's OK if it stays cold for a little longer...the fish will be just that much hungrier."
2486977,campchick,2014-02-25 10:24:00,96,"Thanks everyone for the replies. Just from the positive feedback, it appears there might be a ""season"" after all. Stay warm and keep thinking about fishing!"
2487553,troutwater,2014-02-25 11:47:00,299,"Wow two trips to Perrault, just curious what are you mainly going for? Our group fished it for a day 3 years ago. Nice looking lake and had some nice smallmouth if I remember correctly."
2487585,Danbear,2014-02-25 11:52:00,72,"If every thing goes good with my work schedule we should be making our 6th consecutive trip to Birch Dale Lodge on Eagle Lake the 3rd week of August. Our routine is leave Milwaukee area early Friday morning, Stop for lunch at Uncle Mikes Pub in Trego, Wi. get to I-Falls between 5-6 stay the night in I-Falls. If we stay at the hotels on the south end of town we walk down to the Spot Supper Club for dinner and cocktails if we stay at the American Inn we eat at the bar there, both are very good. Get up in morning and head for Birch Dale arrive by 1 pm, unload, get boat in the water, rig the rods, eat supper, fish after supper and meet in the bar after. It is the best week of the year !!!!!"
2487985,jimmie,2014-02-25 13:10:00,123,Heading to the Sioux Lookout area. Began trying the water there in the late 90's to fish several bodies of water. Should be making reservations soon for the last week of June thru however the good fishing lasts and hopefully again in Late July or August. Irratic weather the past cpl years has made the fishing a bit more of a challange during those periods of summer. I do like exploring the differnt bodies of water though searching for the hot spots. The older ones seem to come and go. Always a fun adventure. If I could afford it I'd stay in the area the entire summer each year thru mid Spetember anyway. Absolutely beautiful in the area in the fall especially Ojibway Park. See all of you on the water!!
2488097,NickDalasio,2014-02-25 13:30:00,34,"Taking my son on our first fly-in this year, to Lake Nagagami. Can't wait!!"
2488169,port1042,2014-02-25 13:52:00,509,"Mostly, we just like fishing. That being said, walleye and northern are typically what we're after. Catching smallmount is fun too, but we really don't key on them. If we run into perch we'll stay on them until they quit biting. I've got one nice perch fry left in the freezer but we do better in the fall for perch so this summers fish fries will be Wisconsin bluegills. The Perrault Lake walleye are saved for those days I don't have company! We stay at Manotak."

2484625,Mrnovice,2014-02-24 17:35:00,75,"We plan a weeks stay on Lac Seul and then maybe out of the blue, do a quick 3 day trip later on if things fall into place"

2484793,Rich B,2014-02-24 18:23:00,1081,"Driving up (2 days) for the opener week to north of Vermilion Bay from Eastern Ohio and staying at a drive-in camp with some good friends (from Ohio and MN).Then back home for 3 weeks and head back up north of the border via the Soo with my bride (of 35 years) and our youngest daughter and her husband to a drive-in camp for a week at the end of June.In early September heading back up to Northern MN for a week at a camp (drive-in) with my twin brother and other good friends. Hopefully will be able to get out for a few weekends or more of fishing in-between these week long fishing trips. Did I mention that I really enjoyfishing and especially fishing good waters ?OTHER than the winters, I could live in Northern MN and have so many excellent lakes in my backyard, or drive a few hours north to the border and then fish Western Ontario....guess I'll have to be thankful for being close to Lake Erie and the ability to drive to other good waters.Faith, Family, Friends and Fishing,Rich B"

I have a niece who relocated to the Twin Cities (works for Cargill) several years ago with her family and gives us the weather reports. My Dad would say how the cold below zero wasn't all that bad because it was a ""dry"" cold....I told him -10 (or whatever it was) is too cold for me (dry or wet - ha).Yea, this winter for us Buckeyes has not been kind (nor to many other folks), though the last few winters haven't been too bad (like we have a choice - ha). Now just counting down the days until ice out on Lake Erie, and the the trip up for the Ontario Spring Opener !Rich B"

2485185,beer slayer,2014-02-24 19:56:00,33,"This will be my 5th year in a row, 4th on a fly-in. You just can't beat the solitude of a Canadian wilderness trip and still have some level of comfort. As a bonus the fishing can be pretty dang good too! I tell folks from my home state of New Jersey how I drive 20 + hrs. and spend lots of money, then I tell them about the experience. Most are like wow!!"
2485945,troutwater,2014-02-25 04:56:00,299,"Going to a drive to camp in July, and then a boat in trip in August."
2483633,campchick,2014-02-24 13:35:00,96,"Doing an informal survey... How many of you plan on a Canadian fishing trip this year? Drive in or fly in? If you have nothing planned so far would a last minute trip still be possible? If a trip is definitely out, what are the reasons? Just something to think about as I look at the mountains of snow outside my window. I welcome any replies. Thank you."
2483681,Pooch,2014-02-24 13:50:00,4619,"Same as past years. Two one week trips to Lac Seul and a fifteen day trip to Lake Savant. Drive in, drive in and trail in.Haven't done a fly in for six years now. No particular reason why not though.......Which camp is yours campchick? Please humor me, I'm getting old and forgetful!Pooch"
2483777,SinOrSwim,2014-02-24 14:15:00,1528,We are doing our normal trip. Drive-in for the last 3 years. Flew in for about 17 before that. Cost got too much to get the same group together so we changed to a drive-in. That along with the fact my Dad won't fly and a couple people use CPAP machines and need the electricity. Am trying to organize a second trip so I can take my 9 year old. Will be a drive-in but just not sure where yet. Hard to get dates nailed down when I don't know how many people and sports schedules.
2483897,Knoxabilly,2014-02-24 14:47:00,225,Drive in trip- Evergreen Lodge on Lac Seul on opening week. Missed last year so I'm extra excited for this one!

2484009,adempsey,2014-02-24 15:19:00,963,"I live in SW Ontario, but haven't booked anything yet. We normally go in July, so I am never that concerned about availability. Not really waiting for anything in particular, just haven't decided where to go yet. I suppose I better book it soon though!!I usually aim for a fly-in lodge, but also do boat-in and drive-to lodges. Probably flying in this year. Usually focus on the area east of Nipigon/Thunder Bay out of Nakina, White River or Hornepayne."
2484097,camp chef,2014-02-24 15:34:00,915,1 week boat in trip through the voyagers national park in the spring. Possible repeat in the fall.
