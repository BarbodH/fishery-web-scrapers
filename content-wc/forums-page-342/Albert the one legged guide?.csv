2468249,go dart,2014-02-19 20:23:00,77,Did anybody fish with this guide? It was maybe 35 yrs ago on Lake of the Woods. He was First Nation and his son would run the second boat. One fish catching son of a gun. I remember him once in a great while and try to remember the name of the Lodge he fished out of. Anybody?

He worked for both Anderson's and Moosehorn Lodges in Sioux Lookout back then, several other too I'm sure. An island on Lac Seul is named after him. Albert and his son Allan were two of the legendary guides of the Sioux Lookout area. He was one of my mentors when first learning Minnitaki and Lac Seul. He always had jokes for everyone, and loved to laugh. Incredible fishermen, both of them! Allan is still in Sioux Lookout, I had guided with him for many years. Great guy as well. He does not guide to often anymore, as works another job in town. I regret to say that Albert passed several years back."
