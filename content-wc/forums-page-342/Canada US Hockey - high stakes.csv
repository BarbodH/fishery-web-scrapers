2492242,Simple Man,2014-02-26 11:45:00,92,All credit to tp Canada on the gold....but we laid an egg. Thought for sure Gold was coming our way this time. Oh well....go Bhawks!
2472497,Carnhzkr,2014-02-21 10:26:00,964,"I see this is getting serious (maybe it's already over, I haven't checked)."
2473105,RickOnt,2014-02-21 13:26:00,217,It was close But you guys can have him!!! Go Canada Go
2474169,zeebee,2014-02-21 18:02:00,1144,The little prick has a net worth reported at $150mill and is barely outta puberty. Could probably stop performing and buy a hockey team.....hey I like the first part of the idea.
2476177,btyreprich,2014-02-22 10:37:00,1067,"The US team should be very, very embarrassed with their performance against Finland. To play so well against Canada and not even get one goal in today's game is hard to fathom. Kane misses on two penalty shots?? Seems that Finland wanted the win more than we did"
2478161,Skywagon,2014-02-23 05:10:00,1106,"Canada is playing for the gold this morning, should be a good game."
