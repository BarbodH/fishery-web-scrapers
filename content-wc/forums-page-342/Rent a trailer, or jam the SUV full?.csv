2477889,SinOrSwim,2014-02-22 22:01:00,1528,"We have used a trailer for years. Started out my little jon boat and it's trailer for gear only. Then my brother had a little flat bed he put sides one. We spent a ton of time and money in tarps trying to keep that thing dry. It worked but was a lot of work. Now we borrow a 12 to 15 foot long enclosed and it is awesome. use a trailer, even if that means it only carries gear that can get wet. Use it for coolers, rod cases, etc. Put your personal gear in the truck. If you can find an enclosed one, do it. Rent or borrow. It makes a world of differnce. Be comfortable. Unless you are 23 years old and can be cramped. Those times have passed me"
2479969,roscoe33,2014-02-23 15:23:00,653,"Sorry, didn't mean to give that impression. Photo is of type of trailer I have. Mine is out in the barn, but didn't want to walk out in the -16 wind chill to snap a photo."
2481529,Pooch,2014-02-23 20:51:00,4619,"Pulling a trailer or boat has one disadvantage that usually doesn't factor in, but could. Parking at hotels and restaurants. Sometimes by the time we arrive late to our motel it can be tough to find someplace secure to park.Hate to park in the dark ""back forty"" of a lot and make it too easy for the cockroaches to ruin our trip.Just an after thought.Pooch"
2472601,Pikeslayer8,2014-02-21 10:54:00,1460,"Big issue for me as well as I am driving 2400 miles bringing 3 others from Colorado in my Navigator. The last few trips weren't so bad as my boys were part of the crew. Between the 3 of us, we packed in 2 duffles including their tackle boxes, but this year, my boys are unable to come and I will be bringing my brother, a friend of his, and another TBD. So I am sure more space will be needed as I will be looking to pack an additional duffle and 2 additional tackle boxes. I have to bring the food for party of eight which amounts to 3 big plastic containers for the dry goods and 1 big cooler and a medium sized cooler for frozen food. I guess that I'm going to be in the market for one of them roof top carriers or perhaps one of these.http://www.sears.com/rightline-gear-...&blockType=G17 Anybody have any experience with these cargo saddlebags?"
2472649,MrSimon,2014-02-21 11:14:00,922,That's a neat looking bag. We use a roof top carrier and a hitch basket .... its amazing how much stuff you can fit on one of those things.
2472681,Pikeslayer8,2014-02-21 11:25:00,1460,Nice setup you got. How long a rod can ya put in one of those roof carriers? It sure would be nice to get my rods outta the cab.
2472849,MrSimon,2014-02-21 12:25:00,922,"To fit up there, it pretty much has to be a two piece rod. Anything over 5.5' isn't going to fit. I've always thought about building a big PVC rod holder for the roof, but haven't got around to it."
2473089,dutchboy,2014-02-21 13:21:00,5717,Go to Menards and get a PVC tube with caps. Strap to the rooftop luggage rack. Rods in the PVC reels in the truck.
2473737,btyreprich,2014-02-21 15:44:00,1067,"We rented a trailer last year after selling our boat. The trailer we rented was the smallest covered trailer the rental agency had. It was a good foot higher that my buddy's Jeep Cherokee. I would say that the gas mileage was lower with the trailer than when we pulled the 17' boat!Let's face it, the higher profile of the trailer just makes it harder to get decent gas mileage. Previous poster was right - the faster you drive, the more gas the car will use.In looking at our local UHaul agency for a trailer for this year's trip, they do NOT have spare tires to loan or rent. A lot of rental agencies also do not have spare tires for their trailers.Buying a spare tire for a trailer I don't own doesn't seem right. New tires & wheels are not cheap. My buddy thought to go to a local junk yard and get a tire that is as close to the trailer tires as is possible. Idea here is to have a spare that will get you to the next town.If anyone knows of a rental agency in the Chicago area that has small trailers complete with a spare tire, please tell us. I'd appreciate it very much."

2473961,btyreprich,2014-02-21 16:52:00,1067,"Thanks! They even offer trailers with spare tires. For our group of four, you don't need a big trailer. Last year the trailer we had was large enough that we did not have to double stack anything. Will check these folks out."
2475041,F250,2014-02-22 04:47:00,75,"Annual trips that I take : 4025 miles, 3100 miles and 1100 miles (round trip). Usually 3 or four guys in my crew cab pick up and sometimes a dog. Passenger comfort is the name of the game. All gear is packed under the pickup cap, and into the enclosed cargo trailer, (or into the boat if I take that instead of the cargo trailer). Part of the fun is the ride. I get to visit with friends and enjoy the North American countryside. Trailer preparation is #1. Jack, spare tire(s), extra hub assembly, grease gun, test light, bulbs, fuses, electrical tape, 12 volt compressor, tool kit, and breakdown reflectors are packed into a tote. I would clear out the passenger compartment of the SUV and load everything into an enclosed trailer."
2476721,roscoe33,2014-02-22 15:16:00,653,"I vote for trailer, a low one.They are free to borrow, cheap to rent, and cheap to buy, last forever.I bought a 4x8 26 years ago, and it is still in use.They are light, and tuck in behind the truck, have minimal tongue weight, don't effect mileage like a tall box trailer. Taking 1000# of weight out of the Excursion with likely improve the ride. You can load it up with a dozen plastic totes and coolers, and it still won't block your view out the back window."
2471657,MrSimon,2014-02-21 06:41:00,922,"For our fly-in this year, we are looking at about 2,200 miles of driving with 5 guys in an Excursion. We did it before and used a roof top carrier, a hitch basket, and stuffed every nook and cranny inside the SUV. It wasn't all that bad, but it did get a little cramped. But for this year, we are thinking about renting/borrowing a small box trailer to put all the gear in. It would free up a TON of space in the SUV and allow people to spread out, and maybe even lay down and get some sleep. The pros of a trailer are: easy to load, everything covered, space in the SUV. Cons are: higher tolls, have to tow something for 2200 miles, and rental cost (if we can't borrow one). What do you guys do?"
2471745,Pooch,2014-02-21 07:11:00,4619,"Pulling a small trailer wouldn't be that much different than pulling a boat back and forth to Canada, would it? I drag my small Lund back and forth two trips a year to Canada and barely realize it's back there. Costs me a couple miles per gallon at the most. Suburban gets 15-18 mpg with just two of us in the cabin pulling the boat and running the speed limit at seventy on the interstates. Going seventy five with a boat just kills the mileage.I understand what you are saying about being cramped. There are four in our two week trip using my Suburban and it is crammed full and the boat doesn't make that trip. Sometimes after picking up our bait and freshest bread in Ignace the two guys in the back seat can barely see each other. In our shop I made replacement hoops for the roof racks that specifically fit a four inch PVC rod tubes and that saves a lot of room as they are so long. Coming home they can be put inside as there is room by then.Take the trailer, but make sure you have a decent jack, correct wrenches and spare tire for the trailer. I check bearings before every trip. Seen too many guys along side 502 with blown out bearings. They look pretty forlorn! Pull the loaded trailer around before you leave for the trip to make sure it's balanced right and not tongue heavy. I like to carry about a hundred pounds of tongue weight on my half ton Suburban or what ever it takes to make it ride smooth and track right. Thousand miles one way is a long time to fight a misbehaving trailer.I've got a dollar that says with the trailer you guys won't make the weight limit for the fly-in! More room equals more stuff! Our group rules are that if total bulk won't fit in the Suburban then it won't fit in the plane and we don't need it. Even doing some drive to camps the past few years that is still our guideline.Where are you going? Have fun.Pooch"
2471937,camp chef,2014-02-21 08:16:00,915,Trailer for sure. Wouldn't think of doing it any other way. We have done it both ways in the past.
2472025,zeebee,2014-02-21 08:34:00,1144,Buy one used. You dont need a large one. Tarp it and you are good to go. Use it for several years and then sell it for what you paid.
2472185,LOW1,2014-02-21 09:13:00,2828,"Why not take a compact car where two people can ride? You will then have enough room for all sorts of stuff which you won't be able to put in the plane. A little more expensive than a trailer but not by much. And more comfortable. Or why not leave the gas sucking Expy at home and take two smaller cars?If you have your heart set on a trailer I'd rent a Uhaul. The ones I have used in the past were rock solid. I think they were about $125-150 per week. Unless you have a need for a trailer more than once a year, buying one seems like too much of a commitment to me."
2472265,MrSimon,2014-02-21 09:29:00,922,It would be silly to take two vehicles when taking one is a possibility. Doubling the drive time and splitting up the group turns a fun road trip into a not fun grind. The truck is a diesel and gets 17mpg fully loaded on these trips. That's really not too bad.
2472345,2746,2014-02-21 09:51:00,3206,"5 guys equal a trailer for sure but Pooch is correct about the amount of ""stuff"". If each of the five guys work at it I'd bet you can cut the amount your carrying by a third or more. One medium size suitcase, one medium size tackle box, no more than two rods etc. Buy as much of your food as you can after you get there. We travel with trucks and boats so plenty of room to carry stuff and, sure enough, we get a lot of it. finally began a training process during our planning meetings on what was really needed and what was not. It's amazing how much we cut out. Half the things we used to haul up never got used."
2472425,dutchboy,2014-02-21 10:07:00,5717,"I agree. Do the U-HAUL, it's secure, heavy duty and dealers nationwide if you have a issue. Split 5 ways it's almost nothing. If you do a open trailer whose stuff is riding in that?"
2472441,MrSimon,2014-02-21 10:13:00,922,"I couldn't agree more about pairing down the gear. We actually have our planning meeting tomorrow night ... hence the question about the trailer - we'll be discussing it. Now that I think about it a bit, I think that it makes more sense to NOT take the trailer, if possible. Its cheaper, less hassle, and less things to break down. If we could fit all our stuff in the truck for a boat-in (no weight limit), then we should be more than able to do it for a fly-in."
2472481,LOW1,2014-02-21 10:23:00,2828,"I have never looked at it that way before. To me, the more distance between my passengers (which usually consists of my kids and their friends) the better. Nothing creates a bigger grind for me than too many kids jammed into the vehicle.It's great that you find the drive to be such a good part of the trip."
