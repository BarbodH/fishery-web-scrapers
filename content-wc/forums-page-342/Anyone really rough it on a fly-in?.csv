2489481,Mike Borger,2014-02-25 19:06:00,1554,"I've been to pretty much all of their lakes. Let me know if you end up booking, I can likely help you with some info."

2490570,stillangling,2014-02-26 06:08:00,149,"There are lots of areas in NW Ontario that you can drive to, launch a boat, set up a tent camp and experience absolutely crazy good fishing if you want to avoid the cost of a float plane. The area north of Ignace comes to mind. Just be sure you check to see that the area you are interested in is not covered by a non-resident camping restriction. If you can find yourself on the English River system or a tributary it can be awesome. Just do a little homework. Canoes would open up even more options but in my mind are not needed. Personally I like to take coolers, ice and all the comforts."
2490610,Bill Krejca,2014-02-26 06:27:00,6107,"Enjoyed many years of boat-in camping. Early spring sometimes meant helping ourselves to shovels full of hard packed snow or bay ice to keep our coolers cold all week; many late fall trips with snow on the tent roof, whiteouts, and multiple tent repairs. It seems that camping brings back the most memorable of fishing adventures. Bill"
2490882,forgop,2014-02-26 07:19:00,880,Some of us don't own a boat nor do I ever have the time available to justify owning a boat. Part of the experience imo is getting far enough away that the odds of seeing anyone else is highly unlikely.
2490938,zeebee,2014-02-26 07:26:00,1144,Be aware that if you are a non-resident you need a permit to camp on Crown (public) land.http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business...02_170045.html
2464545,forgop,2014-02-18 17:31:00,880,"I made my first trip last September and have always thought it would be a more challenging experience to go with tents/sleeping bags/coolers/etc than staying in a cabin. The shameful thing about it was when pricing such a trip with the outfitter we chose, I think it might have only been $150/person cheaper not to stay in a cabin. At that point it's worth paying for the amenities because if you're going to spend that kind of money, might as well splurge a bit. However, if I could do a trip that was perhaps half the cost, it's much more of a likelihood to happen. I spent in the neighborhood of $1k for my trip at a nice cabin. Anything within driving distance from the midwest that can be significantly cheaper to go without a cabin?"
2465417,wallydave,2014-02-18 20:32:00,2151,"Check out Parks, they offer flyin trips that might be roughing it, but the pricing looks pretty good. Black Bear Lodge on Red Lake is a drive to, rustic American plan place. 620 a week includes meals, boat and motor."
2465537,MrSimon,2014-02-18 21:11:00,922,"While I very much enjoy camping ..... I love love love having a roof over my head and a real bed to sleep in after fishing for 14 hours straight. But, I fished on Crotch Lake in Eastern Ont once .... they had some absolutely beautiful campsites spread out around the lake. Most of them were boat-in. Since the land is Crown Land, the rates were next to nothing. I don't know much about fly-in camping though. Like you said, seems like if you are going to spend all the money on the flight, might as well spend just a little more for the cabin."
2465665,adempsey,2014-02-18 23:02:00,963,Northwest Flying has a bunch of fly-in tent camps.Park's Fly-In Fishing has a tent in camp on Trump Lake. There are plenty of outposts that are under $800 per person (for a group of 4 for 7 days).

2465681,zeebee,2014-02-18 23:54:00,1144,"Several years ago we would have an outfitter strap our canoe onto the pontoons and fly us into a lake of our own choosing. A week later they would pick us up. Our annual moose hunt was arranged on such a basis and these trips are the ones I remember with the greatest fondness. One year we took an Otter and got the canoe into the plane. The pilot landed in the middle of the lake, we unloaded the canoe and all the gear then, we paddled around in the rain looking for a suitable camping spot. We cleared an area by axe and machete, set up our sleeping tent and tarped an area for cooking. Built a latrine seat outta lashed together birch branches...gotta have some comforts. Slept well that night. We called in moose, ate grouse, caught fish and even squeezed in some waterfowl at the end of the week. Man this brings back memories...I recall having a local baker mix up some special loafs of bread for us before we left. He claimed they would last a month without refrigeration... they were hefty and cost me 10x what regular bread went for. In paddling around, the loaves got wet and weighed bout as much as a cinder block. Set them out on a log the next day in the sun and at day's end they were dried out and good as new...best bread I ever ate. Real colon cleanser. Funny the things we remember. We flew outta Armstrong into the Ogoki Reservoir area."
2465737,Mike Borger,2014-02-19 04:00:00,1554,"I used to do that all the time, until the cost of chartering a plane went through the roof.I can remember a few trips we did, splitting the cost 4 ways the cost per person was under $300. Unfortunately those days are long gone.The the OP you'll find it's very difficult to find cheap air charter and in most cases it is cheaper to fly into an outpost.One scenario that is cheaper is a fly in canoe trip if you're into that. Fly in with canoe and gear then paddle back out. Only one flight involved makes it a reasonable option."
2465865,zeebee,2014-02-19 06:22:00,1144,The outfitters in Quetico Park/Boundary Waters are well versed in such an arrangement and will supply all or part of the gear required. Would be an awesome trip.
2466313,Tylumps,2014-02-19 08:50:00,73,"My first fly-in was when I was 8 years old. I went with my Father, Grandfather and 9 year old brother. The camp was a tent camp and all we had was canoes. We went in July on a 4 day trip but the weather was awful for two days. It snowed hard during the night and I remember my Grandfathers teeth freezing in a cup. My Dad was not a good cook to say the least. He tried to make Mac and Cheese and he messed it up bad. The fishing was tough. We had to canoe up river over many Beaver Dams. We caught some trout but the bite was very slow. The positives were there too. We got to pick blueberries during the afternoon and saw plenty of Moose while we went up and down the river. Caught a ton of minnows every evening with a piece of bread in a minnow trap. We ate sausage and hot dogs for the 4 days because that is what my Dad could cook. The plane ride was a real thrill for the first time and we saw a bear on our flight back. My Dad took his super 8 film camera so we get to re- live the trip once and a while on film. My sons are 10 and 11 and did their first fly in last year. Cabin, hot and cold running water with shower and 9.9 hp on the boats. Caught a thousand Walleye for the week and stayed warm and dry in the cabin. Don't think a tent camp will do going forward."
2488417,forgop,2014-02-25 15:36:00,880,I checked out the Parks website and think I may have just found my new lake for August 2015. Is it too early to begin a countdown?
2488929,wallydave,2014-02-25 17:13:00,2151,"Good luck! This outfitter looks interesting that's for sure! I don't start the countdown until the last trip of the year has ended. The ""official ""countdown starts Jan. 1st! If you have some room let me know!"
