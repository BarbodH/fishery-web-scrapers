1423218,heritage2008,2012-04-19 07:17:00,92,"Looking to try out a new fishing hole either the last week of June or first week of August. I fish mostly for pickeral or pike and have been fishing Quebec for the past 16 years. Looking for information on cabins and fishing reports from any that have fished these waters. I have scouted the area and have found what is available for accomodations but reading reviews online are always positive to help sell the business. I'm leaning towards Mountain Home Cottages on Red Cedar. June or August better--my lady like August since black flies are gone by then but fishing is the priority. Also looked at West End of Nippising but prefer less pressure and smaller lakes. Thanks, David"

There are about 6 fishing camps on the lake and it is only 40 minutes from Northbay. With many islands and separate areas, you can certainly find a bay of your own, but it's been fished. Last year, I stayed at Red Cedar Lake Camp. The owner and his wife were very nice people and the cottage was most reasonable and clean, nothing fancy. We trolled and cast, catching some decent eater pike and walleye, but nothing to write home about. On prior trips we stayed at Pozniak's (a short drive in back woods to dock on lake each day) and a cottage near the temagami river (forget name, but it was north ""campus"" of some camp offf route 64 past RCL camp). I've been to Quebec (Lac Remigny and Des Quinze) and had better luck with both size and quantity of pike. We didn't focus much on walleye when in Quebec. Where in Quebec have you been going? If rather remote and you can catch 50 pike in one day during a hot bite, then you may consider going back.Check the slot limits for that region of Ontario. Think about throwing back walleye from 16"" to 23"" and only being allowed one over 23"" if I recall correctly. You need a few 15"" dinks for a dinner. For pike, there are also slot limits. No probelm for the C&R fisherman, but tossing a 20"" walleye back when the livewell is empty...I'm not sure where you are driving from. I'm 30 miles below Cleveland so RCL is a long haul, but driving a little further north may pay big dividends.don't get wrong though, I might still return to RCL for a pleasant week of fishing on a lake that I am somewhat familiar with and nice RCL Camp."

They have great boats , you can fish all day and be comfortable 16footers,25hp swivel seats.Lots of smallies, some real nice sizes seen guys with some over 5lb."
1424994,heritage2008,2012-04-23 07:23:00,92,"Thanks for the suggestion on Gow-Bush-Kon Lodge. Can you elaborate a bit more about the fishing? Looking to fish for eyes, pike, bass, and perch. 750 mile trip one way so I want to make sure it is worth the time--nothing is a sure thing but looks like this camp is secluded--just what we like. Is there a place to load up on groceries or gas after North Bay--traveling as light as possible. Have you stayed there more than once? Any info would help. Also looking at Red Cedar Lake at Mountain Home Lodge but haven't read too much about this lake for eyes--seems Marten River may also be doable but seems more public being close to North Bay and several camps nearby. Thanks, David"
1424995,heritage2008,2012-04-23 07:25:00,92,"I work in East Akron and live in Massillon. Crappies are hitting well at Wingfoot--some nice 9-10"" taken Friday-threw the females back."
