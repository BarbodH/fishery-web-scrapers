2450201,Pooch,2014-02-14 06:31:00,4619,"With little traffic on 502 at night, no cell service and a hard road to traverse in the day, light logic says to avoid the road in the dark or when tired. Like most over the years, I've seen the remnants of overnight accidents along that stretch nearly every time we drive it. From moose, deer hits to vehicle still down in a rocky ditch.Help is a very long time and distance away. It's a risk / reward thing.We avoid 502 by crossing at Pigeon River. About the same drive TIME as making Dryden through Fort Francis from Central Illinois. Maybe a few more miles, but worth it. Not that the drive from Superior Wisconsin to Thunder bay is a peach, but we do hit it during the day on our schedule. Border crossing is better, too.Pooch"
2450281,v-bay gord,2014-02-14 06:49:00,3168,I can vouch for the dining experience...it is very good. I haven't stayed in their rooms but think they would be very nice as well. Here's a link to their website.. http://www.theriverviewlodge.com/index.html
2450793,tv4fish,2014-02-14 08:45:00,2694,"Gord, your post reminded me of what happened to us a few years ago. Now, this was NOT at night, so it could have been a lot worse! We were headed north on 502, pulled off for a ""pit"" stop, yeah - you know what I mean. Got back in the vehicle - no starty - Long story short - the fuel pump was history. Had a cell phone and AAA was called. Tow company showed up from Dryden - loaded the Exploder on the tow truck, hooked the boat trailer to the back of the tow truck - away we go. (Now this is going to be a ""plug"" for the Red Pine Lodge, especially Verne Hollett - but it IS deserved). We convinced the tow truck driver to take us all the way up to Sioux Lookout (yeah, it took some talking, but AAA was paying the bill). Besides - IF we were to take it in to Dryden, what the heck were the 3 of us to do while we had to wait to have it fixed? So, we call Verne, tell him what has happened and that we are coming to his place. Verne generously offers us to use his pick-up while my truck gets repaired. Talk about Canadian generousity! Took until Thursday for my truck to be ready for us to use. As you said - stuff happens."
2450945,SSH,2014-02-14 09:09:00,526,I have driven all night just twice to get to the Canadian lake. Haven't done it for the last 20 years. Just doesn't seem like a vacation when it takes several days for me to recover from no sleep. So I will never do it again cause it just isn't worth it for me.
2451137,2746,2014-02-14 09:42:00,3206,"No matter where you live there are folks at both ends of the spectrum....good guys like Verne and butts like Advantage Towing. Just glad that most folks we meet are of the ""Verne"" category."
2461385,go dart,2014-02-17 19:53:00,77,"Excellent thread. We leave Kansas City on Friday morn 3:30 sharp. Both vechicles have cb radios and we use them to pass time and for assisting the rear truck with passing. We'll arrive in Minneapolis around 11:00a and miss rush hour. Typically get to Int Falls at 3:00p for a easy crossing. Our lodge on Perrault lets us stay Friday night for free, we just cant use the boats which is fine. Arrival at the lodge is between 7:30 and 8:00p. Perfect for stowing food and gear. We discourage coffee cause some guys have to squirt every 30 minutes then. 2 gas stops and pee breaks before the border. We call in a pizza to pizza hut and pick it up right across the border and get our fishing liscenses then right back on the road. I believe its about 937 miles"
2461697,2746,2014-02-17 21:10:00,3206,Sounds like you have it down to a science. I don't expect anyone gets much sleep before leaving at 3:30...... At least I wouldn't.

Then load up all our gear and drive the appx. 11+ hour drive from Savant Lake to Minneapolis. Then hopefully make it in time load all our gear on the plane to catch our 3+ hour flight back to Phoenix, AZ. And lastly load up the vehicle 1 more for the 40 minute drive from the airport to home!

Our boat had a cover on it and when we sold the boat, we rented an enclosed trailer which we secured with a padlock. Always take valuables like electronics, cameras, and pass ports into the room with you at night. Try and arrive early enough so as to grab a parking spot under a light or in sight of the front desk.that's what our group does and it works for us."

Well my first trip to Canada, I just clipped a cow, in the middle of the night. Since then always carry duct tape. Just got the riders front corner. Come back to S.W. Iowa, and tell your insurance man you hit a moose. Doug"

We stayed in I-Falls, had some dinner and got up fresh in the morning to cross the border. Previous years we always drove straight through and took turns driving....it was a chess match to time out who would have the 502 leg from I-Falls to Dryden and it seem slike I lost more times than not....Nothing worse than driving up 502 dog tired in the middle of the night while your buddy is snoring in the passenger seat only to have him wake up in Dryden saying how fresh he felt that morning! Make me mad just thinking about it!!!! LOL...."

The later it gets, the more your eyes start playing tricks on you also- every reflector ya pass looks like deer eyes! Few years ago, I pulled the all night drive card, when we got there Saturday we went our fishing, it was really slow and I ended up passing out on the bottom of the boat. You know you're tired when you can A) sleep on the bottom of the boat B) not fish!"

2448737,rockape,2014-02-13 14:55:00,215,"We have driven all night every year up until last year. It is about 1100 miles for me. We have 3 drivers, so no big deal. It gets it over with. We go right into dropping the boats in and go fishing. We don't fish super hard the first day. Just enough to feel the tug on the line, and keep enough for a killer fish fry. Then a killer night's sleep for sure. Last year we stopped in IF. Got there about 8:30 or so. Ate a decent dinner and then slept. Got up at 5am and we were still on the water at a decent time. We did drive al night on the way back. We will probably repeat this again this year. Only one hit deer in all the trips. We are smart about it."

2449746,v-bay gord,2014-02-13 20:52:00,3168,"I may have posted this already, but this thread is all about what can happen. A guest who always drives straight through from the Chicago area (who now realizes he is getting too old for that nonsense) drove off into the ditch this past Spring in the middle of the night(speaking of ""ditches""...very few good ones on this highway, so he is darn lucky) on 502 getting closer to Dryden. Some rear axle damage on the Ford truck, and boat and trailer in the ditch as well. His road side assistance calls ""Advantage Towing"" from Dryden. The long and short of it is these people hold his truck and trailer for hostage. He is unable to get it taken to the Ford dealer for repairs....the ""crook"" (what else can he be called) wants $5500. Calls to the police are no help...this is not a legal issue. Finally the insurance companies settle the issue...months later. Beware...if you are in need of roadside assistance DO NOT CALL ADVANTAGE TOWING....if they show up do not allow them to tow your vehicle. There are several other towing companies in the area that are legit....he is not!"
2450009,Skyraptor,2014-02-14 03:46:00,291,Thanks for the heads up V-Bay Gord. They can sure hold you hostage when they know they have you over a barrel. Any thoughts on the Riverview Lodge in Dryden? Plan to stay the night in Dryden this October with the wife and would like a nice place for her with a good dining experience.
2450081,Skywagon,2014-02-14 05:29:00,1106,"Skyraptor, Riverview is the best place to eat in town. I have never been in their rooms, but would guess they are on par with the food. I get the impression that a lot of the VIP's that visit town stay there. I resisted commenting until now, but I can't stand it anymore, so here goes. Traveling down 502 at night is a fools game, there is a reason that there is little to no traffic on it after dark. The hills, curves, wildlife and the unforgiving sides of the road that Gord mentioned, make for a cocktail of hazards after dark. If anyone feels the need to get there that bad, you are not thinking straight. I suggest instead you stop, have a couple drinks, spend the night and hit it first thing in the morning, you will feel better the next day anyway. If for no other reason, save our endangered moose population."
2430538,pjshorthorn,2014-02-08 06:17:00,5654,"We never drove all night, but we invariably would still have the last 1-2 hours of the drive in the dark. Somehow I always seemed to pull the ""last stretch"" duty between Dinorwic and Sioux Lookout. Pucker factor x10.......moose, bear, fox, deer, coyote,lynx......so far I've seen them all and have missed them all .....WHEW!!! IF we were fortunate enough to have someone come up behind us, I would slow down enough to let them catch up and pass. Nothing beats having a rabbit in front of you clearing the path the rest of the way. Did hit a deer in Wisconsin on the way home one year. PjShorthorn"
2430746,NARDA 1,2014-02-08 08:13:00,636,"We used to drive all night in order to arrive at IF at around 6am until we had to wait in line for over 2 hours one year. Then we started leaving early Friday morning and getting to IF in the late afternoon, cross the boarder and spend the night in Fort Francis and head to the lodge in the am. Now we leave at 8am Wednesday and drive to Superior WI (about half way) and stop at the Super 8 on Rt 53. We have dinner and some drinks at Gronk's (they are very nice people and let us put stuff in their freezer and cooler overnight) which is right next door. We then leave after breakfast, cross the boarder before noon (no lines) and arrive at the previous lodge owners house at about 2pm, spend 2 days with him and then on to the lodge on Saturday. The trip home is done all in one shot."
2430930,packpro,2014-02-08 09:11:00,695,"We try to hit the border (IF/FF) around midnight. The thought is that it is less crowded and that timing also gives a buffer in case of a breakdown. We have needed that buffer a few times. Then we have the fun drive/moose dodging up 502 in the dark while tired. We always pull over onto a log check area on 502 about 1/2 way up. Great idea for a bio/smoker break. The fresh Canadian air gets everyone geeked up for the last push. Every so often we hit a perfectly clear night. This is quite a treat for us city dwellers. I have never seen stars like that. Perfectly clear, very bright, and all the down to the horizon for 360 degrees. After that we pull into the our favorite hotel......The parking lot of Wilderness Air. Some guys get a few hours of sleep. Good luck sleeping upright in that snorefest. Guys getting up to relieve themselves gives the skeeters a chance to rush in. None of it makes sense until you factor in the anticipation and excitement offered in the upcoming week. As ridiculous as it all sounds, it is part of the experience. It is amazing to me how anticipation/excitement can create the required adrenalin to conquer fatigue."
2431050,2746,2014-02-08 10:03:00,3206,"All this has brought back a lot of memories......Clear Canadian nights, crossing IF in the middle of the night, 502 in dark you can cut with a knife (we've left a fair amount of tire rubber on that road stopping for moose), sleeping sitting up in a truck, breakfast after an all nighter trying to drink enough coffee to wake up, peeing along the side of the road......oh to be young again! Packpro, I hope you never grow to old for such foolishness."

Started driving to Nogales, Az. and crossing the border to Nogales, Son. Bought TRAIN tix to Mazatlan ($6 US) .... Tons of FUN.... The Ferrocarrill De Mexico (Nationalized mexican train Co.) was something else.... BUT, we were ONLY in our Mid 20's back then and could handle it.. LOL!! I would NEVER attempt it NOW..."

Was fishing LacSeul with a buddy for 3 days, we stayed late on last afternoon due to fishing was off the chart (as usual). Stopped in Dryden at pizza hut to fill the belly for ride home, 30 min down the road WACK. Yes it left a mark. My nose hit the dash so hard thought it was broke. Blood everywhere inside and out. Moose took off how I will never know, amazing, we nursed the truck back to Dryden to get repaired. So for me No Way. Plan our trips to avoid those roads at dark.

Moose still in it with butt on the hood and head on the trunk and body laying on top of seats. He had gone clear through the car....woman driving was hurt but lived. Got my attention!!
2431890,hoosiercanadian,2014-02-08 17:02:00,104,"Unfortunately still driving straight thru. It takes us 24 hrs. from southern Indiana to twenty miles north of Red Lake. I do try and avoid driving 105 at night, and have been going up 17 instead of 502 the last several trips. I think 502 has too many logging trucks, and there is more to look at going up 17. We also fish in northwestern manitoba, that road trip is 1,875 miles one way or 36 hrs. and yes we drive that too, usually with 3 to 4 drivers. But there is more dense bush going up thru Manitoba, not as many moose seen as in Ontario where there habitat is being reduced by clear cutting."
2432066,Guest,2014-02-08 18:01:00,0,"From the responses to this post it's evident that many have had close or impact experiences with large animals at night. My wife and I had one near hone in Philadelphia at night when a deer came over a mid-highway barrier right in front of us. At 65 mph she (it was a doe) would have killed us if her trajectory was rising as opposed to decending. Air bags deployed, 8 thousand dollars of damage to our Honda crv, we survived. If your trip takes you into darkness, be aware of the heightened danger. A safe trip to all."
2426506,jimmie,2014-02-06 18:50:00,123,Watch pout for Moose!!! They are plentiful at night and early am especially on 502 oout of Fort Frances to Dryden. I leave home at 4am and get thru the Fort around 6.:30 so plenty of datlight that time of year still get in saome fishing to get my line whetted (my feet if I forget the plug). You have to leave it out in Minnesota when trailering you boat in the state. I'm old and some times forgot!1 Try not to anymore tho.

Make our only non-fish dinner for the week, down a few brews, crash and burn. No sense in waiting til morning to leave, since I can't sleep the night before a trip because I'm all wound up. The 1 am departure puts me past Toronto before the traffic gets ugly. The night time drving is in OH-PA-NY so no moose, just leftover Friday night happy hour leftovers. For return trip we depart at 8am and again don't hit darkness in moose country. I hate drving part way and getting a hotel; it drags out the travel, costs more, and I'd rather go direct and get there sooner."
2426802,Lambertson Rock Guy,2014-02-06 20:41:00,20,"My first trip to Lac Seul three of us left the Twin Cities at midnight. Arrived in I Falls around 6:00am on a Saturday. Decided to eat a good breakfast at the place on the east side of the highway as you enter town. Very busy, took what seemed like an hour. Drove toward the border...the line to cross must have been a mile or two long. My buddy nods off while idling in line...nearly bumps into the vehicle in front of us. We get across and head toward Dryden. Vehicle owner is now sleeping, other buddy is driving. I look at the map. Looks like a good short cut to bypass Dryden and go near Eagle Lake. Starts raining cats and dogs. Can't remember if the ""shortcut"" was gravel or if they were just working on the road. Anyway, no mud guards on the tow vehicle. We stop for gas in Vermilion Bay. Vehicle owner wakes up, sees mud caked on the sides of his boat and isn't real happy with us. Thank goodness he had a tarp on it. Discover we forgot to fill the boat with gas in I Falls. Made it to Lac Seul. Didn't catch much that first half day. Talk to others in camp who did well in McKenzie Bay so we decide to go there the next day. We make the long trip. Raining again and our map gets wet and rips. No idea where to fish in this huge bay. We drive way up past the large and small sand banks. Stops raining, sun comes out, no wind. Bugs start bothering us. We see a small bay and decide to cast for pike. Small creek coming into bay and we could see tons of minnows. We make a few casts with daredevils and catch pike up to about 8 pounds and walleyes up to about 5 pounds the rest of the day. Didn't catch any small enough to keep but obviously had a blast. Returned the next day. The pike were still there but no walleyes. Found other great spots and had a great week.Have been back many times. We no longer leave at midnight. Even though we had a few little things go wrong we still tell more stories about that first trip compared to all the others."

Drove through the night after we played in a baseball game. I don't think my wife and I spent $300 for the whole trip. Now $300 doesn't cover the gas to get up and back. Fun times.

We now try and leave before 6 am here in the Chicago suburbs so as to have a safe drive to the border hotel. That saves us on gas and allows up to have dinner in Int Falls.

Another year again drove after work, drove to Clearwater Lake, took the motorized portage into Pipestone, got completely lost (first time on lake), camped near entrance to Schistose Lake. As my dad was my companion, and he was legally blind, I drove both trips all the way. Another trip during the 70's when gas stations were closing early due to lack of gas, we filled up enough tanks to refill the vehicles on the way, were able to have enough to get to IF as the stations there were opening. In Oct, 1966, got caught in a snow storm at night, stuck in a gas station pulling my boat. Luckily ran out of the snow, camped for a week out on the lake Today, I get tired just thinking about it.

I love to pack the night before, leave at 4 or 5 and try to be in Cloquet by noon. Wife lollygags, gets up at ten and hits the road by noon if it is a fast day. Different styles. As long as everyone is safe it's all great."
2424697,2746,2014-02-06 10:55:00,3206,"Reading the thread on sharing trip costs started bring back memories of our trips over the past 50+ years. When we were all younger with lots of energy but less money and vacation time we would leave for Canada after work on Friday night, drive all night and eat breakfast in Dryden. We would arrive at camp and be fishing by mid morning and end the day with a big fish fry followed by cards until well after midnight. Trip home was also an all night drive arriving home early in the morning. I'm not sure when we finally reached the magic age but at some point we all had more money and vacation time than energy and the ""all nighters"" disappeared. Anyone still doing the all night thing?"
2424753,JAY221,2014-02-06 11:15:00,877,"Larrym, I am in the same boat as you are in that I thought those olden days were gone when we would drive all night. This year the daughter/son-in-law are coming along so we can't leave until Friday after they get off work. It won't be bad as 3 of us are comfortable driving @ night. You can see a lot of critters driving up at night! Later, Jay"
2424761,Guest,2014-02-06 11:15:00,0,"At some point it dawned on us how large and dark a moose is. The thought of sharing the drivers seat with one convinced us along with advancing years to drive the daylight hours whenever possible. On our last trip down, a cow moose almost came out in front of us. She turned away at the last moment but we would have been able to react because we saw her coming."
2424769,revitup,2014-02-06 11:15:00,140,"We still do the all night trip. Leave from Cedar Rapids, Iowa mid afternoon Friday. Usually pick up my brother from Idaho at Minneapolis airport. Dinner at a steakhouse close to the airport. On to the casino in Hinckley, MN for a few hours, then arrange to get to border around 5:00 am. Cross and have breakfast in Fort Francis. Up to Dryden to get groceries that can't be brought across border and liquor and beer as we've decided to only bring across what is allowed without duty. Then to camp and first fishing. Fish until close to sunset and have that first fish fry. Fish hard all week and never really catch up on sleep. Relaxing, but not what I would call restful. Wouldn't change it for the world. It's the one vacation that is set in stone. My wife understands we are married for 51 weeks of the year."
2424785,Bigstorm,2014-02-06 11:18:00,799,"We leave at 1PM, timing is just right to cross at I-Falls around 9AM and the beer store opens at 9:30. At camp and out fishing by 2PM. This works really well, we used to leave at 6AM but it would be 7PM or 8PM by the time we reached camp. Since we're paying for the cabin that night, we might as well get up there earlier to fish that day too.The fall trip, we leave at 9PM and get to I-Falls by 6AM. We stay on the US side there but that we we have an extra full day of fishing"
2424873,stjoeguy,2014-02-06 11:54:00,979,"We never drove all night, but used to drive all the way and arrive at the motel near the landing around midnight. We didn't have any moose encounters at night (probably just never saw them in the bush), but did have a bear cross in front of us and later had to dodge a dead bear in the middle of the road. Bears aren't as large as moose but are just as dark. Now we drive to Sioux Lookout, have dinner and spend the night there. In the morning we go the last couple of hours, launch the boats and are fishing before lunch. It's much more relaxed this way. I hit a deer in broad daylight on one trip up and wouldn't want to encounter a moose at night."
2424889,tv4fish,2014-02-06 12:09:00,2694,"Amen --- We USED to drive at night - no more. On one trip back from Sioux Lookout, at about 1 a.m. we had just crested a hill on highway 502 and there trotting down the middle of the highway was a cow moose and her calf. I will never forget seeing the cow's front shoulder being right at the level of my driver's side window. I slammed on the brakes and started to jack-knife the rig. I knew that was bad news, so straightened her out and got lucky to get by both of them. Like ""they"" say - once is enough."
2424897,port1042,2014-02-06 12:21:00,509,"We stop in Nestor Falls for the night before heading on the Perrault Falls on Saturday. We leave Friday morning and get into Nestor Falls about 4:00pm. We have a good dinner and catch/release some perch, smallies, and an occupational walleye from shore at the dam before going to bed. In the morning it's a nice 4 hour drive to camp. Heading home, we're off at 8:00am and home about 9:00pm or so. It's not that bad to drive the whole trip in day light. But since check-in at the lodge is 2:00pm, we don't want to leave at mid-night. We want to be on the lake by 2:30 or so!"
2424921,Lovetofish,2014-02-06 12:24:00,458,Used leave at 10PM Friday night to get to camp about 1PM Saturday. But that was years ago although we pulled an all-nighter a couple falls ago and needless to say it was a long drive. But at least when we crossed the border the sun was coming up.
2424929,Mike Kansas,2014-02-06 12:28:00,1463,"We use to drive all night until we came up on a moose/car accident at 3 am half way between Int Falls and Dryden. Luckily the car behind us had a docter in it and one of the guys in the wreck needed a Dr bad. The poor guy had a compound fracture left arm and a gash on his head that was bleeding like a stuck hog. Trust me half way between Int Falls and Dryden is no place to have a wreck, let alone hit a Moose in the middle of the night. Mike Kansas"
