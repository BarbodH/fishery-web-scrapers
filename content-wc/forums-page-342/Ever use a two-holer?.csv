2459977,Bill Krejca,2014-02-17 13:00:00,6107,"Re: Digging new holes - In a number of places in the Precambrian Shield, the dirt just doesn't go down very far before running into solid rock, which makes it difficult to dig a real deep hole. Also, perhaps the digging equipment may just consist of an ""Armstrong Digging Tool"" which is a shovel; digging a deep hole with one is not easy. Bill"
2460057,wallydave,2014-02-17 13:29:00,2151,"Last August at Black Bear Lodge, the mens privy sported 4 holes! They did have a nice view of the trees, large semi-private spaces for each hole. With 20 guys in camp that week, I never had to ""share"" my ""reading time"" with anyone! We did leave a day early, I was getting worried, the ""aroma"" wasn't bothering me anymore! A good sign its time to go home!"
2460097,LOW1,2014-02-17 13:33:00,2828,"http://www.tbdhu.com/NR/rdonlyres/0A...0/PitPrivy.pdfHere's your how-to manual to build a privy in NW Ontario. I had a fun discusion about these with the health inspector we were working with to install a new septic system. Outhouses remain fairly common on Lake of the Woods, especially if you do not have regular electricity. Regulations require the septic tank to be about 50M or so from the lake, which usually means pumping sewage uphill if your cabin is near the shore. That's not hard to do if you have electricitity, but otherwise it's somewhat complicated.Two Hole specs are on page 8!"
2460361,SinOrSwim,2014-02-17 15:25:00,1528,"that is quite the trip through all those little creek areas. Was a neat ride in and out, that is for sure.We were there in September. Lodge owner said early spring and then in the fall. I don't think it was late enough fall at the time though."
2460673,Gipper,2014-02-17 16:27:00,76,"We had a two-holer in a camp in ND back when. We were camped a hundred yds or so from the ""facility"".One morning I watched my good friend go off to take care of business. I gave him a few minutes to get ""settled in"" so-to-speak. I then crept up and pulled on the locked door with a sense of urgency.A stern voice from within responded loudly ""OCCUPIED"". You can hear it, can't you?Using my best 9 year old voice I cried out, ""please sir, I have a big problem, please sir, let me in""!The silence was deafening. He then came back with a disgusted, ""Alright"" and opened the door at the same time.What happened after he saw me standing there shall remain between us and the NSA."
2460753,Gipper,2014-02-17 16:49:00,76,"Sorry but I meant to add this story: Ole told Sven he had accidentally dropped 50 cents into the crapper and then promptly threw his wallet and watch down there as well. Sven asked,""Why the **** did you do that Ole?"" Ole responded, ""Do you tink I'm going down there for yust 50 cents?"""
2460777,Pikeslayer8,2014-02-17 16:59:00,1460,"Precisely, we got 2 crappers and maybe 4-6 holes meaning each hole dug is only a year or two removed from being fresh(I use that term lightly). I just can't imagine the ""treasure"" one would find in digging up a year old hole and where in he11 would ya put it. Carnhzkr, i THINK YOUR THREAD HAS INFECTED US ALL with WINTER CABIN FEVER."
2463209,MrSimon,2014-02-18 09:56:00,922,I absolutely LOVE the fact that we all use outhouses on our trips and have no problem with it. Its all part of the adventure. I know its terrible of me .... but I kind of think less of the guys who pitch a fit about needing indoor plumbing on their fishing trips.
2463465,Pooch,2014-02-18 11:09:00,4619,"Just barely had indoor plumbing when I was little. Dad also kept the outhouse for years and it never was a big deal back then or now for me. Never had to worry about the stool plugging up!When we were kids we used the outhouse to get rid of junk like broken toys, bottles, etc.. Probably would be interesting to dig up the old pit, but our deck now pretty much covers it. Not sure wife would tolerate that.Pooch"
2467049,worthsr,2014-02-19 13:33:00,52,"Ron answered the original question correctly. When I was younger, the old timers insisted on cooking everything in lard. Lots and lots of lard. After a couple shore lunches you might only have two or three minutes to decide where you were going. It was always a last resort, but the second seat has been used. As Ron suggested, if you were the first occupant, leave immediately. Scott"
2457209,HeHooksHimself,2014-02-16 14:50:00,725,"Ann and Herb have a two-holer at Wine Lake. At first, I would never use it because I thought the deluxe crapper must be reserved for the camp owners. After a while, I realized it was just a novelty. They have a large checkerboard between the holes and suggest that you and your ""friend"" could pass the time, among other things."
2457249,tooski,2014-02-16 15:12:00,393,LOLOL- somedays it might be chess.
2457345,Guest,2014-02-16 15:34:00,0,"First off, be thankful for outhouses as opposed to small intimate cabins with indoor toilets. I you've ever fished with buddies that ""Oh my god, what died inside of you"" you know what I mean. Secondly, having done basic training at Fort Knox, Ky. in the sixties where we sat in a semi-circle of twelve, nothing shocks me. Lastly, a two holer exists for those occasions when you really have to go, I mean really!!! and the out house already has one occupant. (Side note, If your the first occupant, leave immediately!)"
2457601,2746,2014-02-16 17:38:00,3206,Grew up with one and it wasn't all that unusual for a couple young kids to go in together. Ours also came equipped with the common sears catalog.....used to read and whatever else might be necessary. (Replacement toilet paper didn't always make it out there)The one room rural school house that I attended until eighth grade was also equipped with two two holers.....one for boys and one for girls. We would often see two girls go in together.....
2457649,mrwalleye5,2014-02-16 17:49:00,1922,"The other hole is there so your brother accidently sets his mitts there, they fall through the hole and your older brother holds him by the ankles and lowers him down to pick them up. Did I mention that my brother still had the habit of chewing on the end of my mitt even after that episode! lol,lol true story. Thanks, ( I think) of reminding me of that happing fifty years or so ago at a old country school. Probably not too many people on here will remember those schools. Good Times!"
2457681,port1042,2014-02-16 17:55:00,509,"We had a two holer at the cottage on Lake Superior for years. It often got used in pairs, more so by the women (and kids) than the men. I think it made them feel safe since they seemed to think there was a bear behind every tree. But it's a fact -- it was used in pairs. Probably 30 years ago it was replaced with a propane toilet (probably couldn't afford to use that today), but that burned up on day (another great story). When we re-built, it was with new two-holer! That lasted until last summer when a whole new outhouse, with real holding tank, was installed. Still no running water and just a single stool."
2457961,Carnhzkr,2014-02-16 19:12:00,964,"I only fished on Sunlight in the evenings, after dinner, and only caught small ones there. We fished on the big lake every day. There is a 30 foot hole between the one island in the lake and a nearby point. I trolled through it a couple times but got blanked. When we got back to the main lodge, the owner pointed out several spots that I'll need to try someday. Apparently, the guests from the week prior fished Sunlight exclusively and did quite well. It's pretty hard for me to fish Sunlight and Broad with Lac Seul calling my name."
2458193,Pikeslayer8,2014-02-16 20:36:00,1460,"Interesting topic. On Wabakimi, we have 2 separate and distinct ""Chowder Banks"" spaced about 30'-40' apart. The thing I don't understand is that every year when we return, the crapper's are moved. You just know someone has to dig ""the new hole"" which used to be ""the old hole"" Deep holes and high piles everyone."
2459649,Mike Kansas,2014-02-17 10:50:00,1463,Sunlight has always been great the first three weeks of the season because the spawners are still there. After that it can be good but not like the first three weeks.
2459969,JAY221,2014-02-17 12:54:00,877,"This brings back a lot of memories that I am glad I can not be prosecuted for anymore. I also grew up with a two holer at least until I was 12 years old. They were still around after that & I have dug my share of them. I also have moved a few back a few feet on Halloween night!!! The memories!! Later, Jay"
2456729,Carnhzkr,2014-02-16 11:24:00,964,"Last year was the first time I took my 15 year old on a trip with just the two of us. When researching where to go, he only had one requirement - the cabin must have an indoor toilet and shower. We decided on a boat-in outpost cabin on Sunlight Lake. When we got to the cabin, the guy that led us in showed us around the place and pointed out the back to where the outhouse was. My son had a pretty concerned look on his face. I think the owner had told me, or maybe it was on their website, that there was an ""indoor washroom with hot & cold running water"", and I assumed washroom meant toilet. Anyway, the point of this post is the outhouse was a two-holer. For the life of me, I've never understood why you would make an outhouse with two holes. I mean, my wife and I are close, but there's a limit to our intimacy. Maybe there are two holes in case the pile gets so high you have to move over to the second hole. Maybe it's just a Canadian thing so I don't get it."
2456753,SinOrSwim,2014-02-16 11:32:00,1528,I with you. There is not a single person in my life I would **** next to. Had a friend in college that was in ROTC. Went on his first weekend function. When he came back I asked how it went and he just chuckled. He then proceeded to tell me it was awesome until you had to take a crap. Opened the door and there were a bunch of toilets all in a line with NOTHING in between each one. LOL He said it wasn't bad teh first day but the second day he sat next to someone who stood up to wipe!!!!!! hahahahahHow was the fishing in Sunlight. We ventured into there one day a year or two ago. Didn't have much luck. Lots of small ones but nothing of size. Our lodge owner said tehre was a big hole by one of the islands. Never did find it.
2456785,Golden Eagle,2014-02-16 11:37:00,2642,Bring back the draft.
2456825,tooski,2014-02-16 11:48:00,393,I hear you Eagle. ROTC disturbed by open crapper. No wonder we haven't won a war in 60 years....... Or did you mean there is a draft with a 2-holer?
2456881,grizzley,2014-02-16 12:06:00,2518,Just because there's accommodations for two doesn't mean you have to share! It could be worse; I saw a two-holer up in Jackman Maine where one was stacked on top of the other and labeled liberal and conservative. Had to do a double take the first time I saw that one!
2456937,Shellback,2014-02-16 12:31:00,8083,LOL! Oh how well I remember those service days. Lotta laughs back then.
2456961,KurtG,2014-02-16 13:05:00,259,"Grew up with a 2 holer. Rarely were both side used at same time and we did have a partition between the sides. As my father said, I beats the woods. And the winter our septic system froze, it was a blessing. Out of the wind and freezing cold, well maybe not the cold, but it was out of the wind,"
2456993,Bill Krejca,2014-02-16 13:19:00,6107,"Well, here in Ioway, years ago, my uncle had one with 4 holes. With 7 in the family, including various sizes of kids, they were assured they would find one that fit (and not fall in). Multi-holed outhouses were not all that unusual at the time. Bill"
2457025,CI_Guy,2014-02-16 13:37:00,2118,"Tailgating before a football game many years ago, there were only a few portable outhouse in the parking lot. The lines were long and as I entered the outhouse a woman rushed in behind me before I could close the door and said ""I can't wait any longer, I hope you don't mind if I sit while you stand"""
2457041,SinOrSwim,2014-02-16 13:45:00,1528,"In one of the cabins we used to fly into for years, the indoor bathroom was right next to the kitchen. Had one guy up there with us who finally started using the outhouse because we would be in there cooking or sitting at the table after dinner and he was in there popping corn. Pop...pop...pop... LOL It was awful. Felt bad for him. experience pays too. On the other side of that bathroom was a bedroom. One bed back in the corner your head was literally right on the other side of the wall from the toilet. Not like those fly in cabins have thick insulated walls. Someone would go pee at night and it was like they were peeing right next to your ear.................cuz they were!!! LOL"
