2458466,jimmie,2014-02-17 01:19:00,123,"I can feel it too! St Croix is a good rod. I had one and gave it to my son years ago. I also has a Tedwilliams III which was one of the most sensitive rods I've ever used. Unfortunately the sun over 40 years got to it and a smallish Musky did it in. Since have many Uglystix of various lenghts and find the medium action 6'10"" can handle most any fich that I'll catch. Like to musky fish but have 5'6"" stiffer rod for that. Just does not cast that far. Any rod can be a great one if its in the water and there is a little or big fishy on the other end!!"
2460121,davenathe,2014-02-17 13:41:00,113,My favorite for rigging. Yet to have someone out fish me when using.
2461153,Fisherman Ted,2014-02-17 18:35:00,461,All of my guides' rods as well as loaner rods to guests (@ 30) are St. Croix.
2470817,walleyeduran,2014-02-20 19:19:00,286,"St. Croix's, 6' Med. fast tip and 61/2' Med. fast tip. When I want to have some fun I use my 7' ML fast tip, makes a 18"" walleye feel like it is 24""."
2474665,wallydave,2014-02-21 20:58:00,2151,Has anyone used Bass Pro walleye rods?
2475185,gordy28,2014-02-22 06:37:00,437,I had one of the walleye series rods. Great feel but after two years (and out of warranty) had the tip snap when pulling a jig through some weeds. Personally I won't buy one again I have a shimano compre 6 8 med heavy that I use for trolling bouncers and stick baits that I love
2475217,bassnblast,2014-02-22 06:41:00,56,"I've gone to Temple Fork Outfitters rods. Great price (most are $99), great feel, lifetime warranty and designed in conjunction with Gary Loomis. Bass Pro and Cabelas down here in Texas are carrying them..."

2449842,Knoxabilly,2014-02-13 22:04:00,225,"Bought two new rods the other day to help break up this cabin fever. My favorite walleye jigging rod broke 2 years ago in Canada after 8 years of use. It was a 5'6"" Triumph St. Croix. I ended up buying a regular, made in America, St. Croix to replace it. I handled a lot of different rods before buying, I figured might as well just get nicer version of the same thing! I also bought a Scheels casting rod for my baitcaster, for 29.99 and lifetime guarantee ya can't go wrong! Can't wait to get that first tap tap on the new rod!!! What brand and size rod do you guys prefer up North?"
2449874,Gregking,2014-02-13 22:33:00,2658,I run a lot of croix's

2452801,NARDA 1,2014-02-14 19:52:00,636,St Croix Legend Elite SJR63MHXF have had it for several years now and love it jigging for walleye.
2453130,The Donger,2014-02-15 04:42:00,48,"Daiwa Samurai rod & reel combo, 5'6"". light action, two-piece for easy transport on fly-ins, to use for walleye jigging. $24.99 at Dick's Sporting Goods. I win!"
2453138,NY Walleye,2014-02-15 05:10:00,78,I have three st Croix rods. Triumph for my son. Two legends. Best rods I have every had. The feel is unbelievable.
2457217,roscoe33,2014-02-16 14:52:00,653,"I have a couple St Croix, but rarely use them for jigging.Yes the feel is great, BUTâ€¦ I have found that if I can feel the fish, they have already felt me on the other end. Add that the older I get, the slower my reflexes.I prefer a lite action limber rod for jigging.A 6' Ugly Stik Lite Pro, in lite action, but hard to find.They make some really nice UL versions as well, in 6'6"" and 7' lengths, which I use when using 1/16 ounce or lighter jigs. These are sometimes advertised as trout rods. It has about 15"" of noodle strength at the tip, before it gets to the backbone of the rod. Quite a thrill to catch a 4 pound walleye, or 25"" northern on one of these.http://www.amazon.com/Shakespeare-Tw.../dp/B003D649X2"
2457777,btyreprich,2014-02-16 18:15:00,1067,To be sure St. Croix makes a great rod - I have two of them.I do have several Fish Eagle rods from Cabela's and these are also fine rods at a lower cost than the ST Croix rods.
2457849,55walleyes,2014-02-16 18:33:00,131,Considering Fenwick Elite Tech walleye rod from Cabelas. Anybody use this rod?
2458225,J. Merics,2014-02-16 20:40:00,32,I use Tooth Tamer walleye and muskie rods.
