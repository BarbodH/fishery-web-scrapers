2494282,Citybuck07,2014-02-26 20:49:00,2,I have stayed at Sportsmen last few years. Owners do a good job. And they make sure catch fish. It is in good location. Nice/clean cabins and boats. And you can venture out to the portage lakes which is awesome.
2480641,jds22,2014-02-23 17:56:00,9,"Hi all, Looking to book a lodge at eagle lake this summer and right now its between Birch Dale lodge and Sportsmen's Lodge. We have a dog and a young son So we've narrowed it between these 2 as they both look to have a beach for our son to play on and they allow dogs. Pros and cons of both? both are priced right (bringing our own boat) or if anyone else can suggest a kid/dog friendly one. much appreciated!"
2480793,dutchboy,2014-02-23 18:18:00,5717,I stayed at sportsman several years ago. Enjoyed my time there. Only thing was the railroad track runs right past the place. Only bothered me the first night after that I never heard anything. Lol
2480945,tackleman,2014-02-23 18:46:00,444,"get in touch with vermilion bay lodge, it has good facilities and the owners are friendly and will tell you where to fish, (at least he showed me) . and yes I fish eagle 2 or 4 times a year and I don't work for the lodge."
2481057,jkretch,2014-02-23 19:17:00,80,"I've stayed at Sportsmen's the last three years. It's clean, well run, equipment/cabins are well kept and nice owners. Good dock space and some open space for your son and dog to enjoy. I really like the location as it's in a nice protected area of the lake. I would recommend it. When are you thinking of going?"
2481121,jds22,2014-02-23 19:24:00,9,We're thinking mid to end of july.

2482017,jds22,2014-02-24 06:37:00,9,I did look at your lodge Gord but the dog policy was the reason for that. Leaning towards birch dale because of the restaurant.
2482097,bushead11,2014-02-24 07:07:00,151,"In 2012 we decided to stop somewhere on Friday night instead of make the whole drive in one shot. Instead of Motels I called lodges to see who would be willing to board our group of 6 for one night...? Cheryl at Birch Dale was awesome. We got one of their larger cabins with great view of the lake. She charged us next to nothing for the cabin because I ensured her we would do plenty damage at the steakhouse after a 10 hour drive. Which we did... Food was awesome! We did catch some fish off the dock in the morning before we left but can't speak to the rest of the lake. The grounds were clean, service and conversation were great! If we ever decide to change lodges and stay a little more south. Cheryl at birch dale will be one of the first calls i make."
2484649,Danbear,2014-02-24 17:43:00,72,"I have been to Birch Dale 6 times and the last 5 years in a row, plan on making it 6 years in a row as soon I can confirm my schedule for August with my job. Every year brings more memories that you can not put a price on. Marcel and the gang at Birch Dale will take great care of you and if you take the diner plan be prepared to let a notch out of your belt.From Birch Dale you are only a short boat ride from some great fishing areas."
2484905,jds22,2014-02-24 18:49:00,9,We're going to book it for mid to late july at Birch Dale. Trying to get the wife to go with the dinner plan but she wants to cook out there (fine by me) i've only fished at South Shore Lodge before so I know the south end of eagle lake really well. Don't know a thing about the north end. If anyone has any spots they don't mind sharing i'd be grateful for it!
