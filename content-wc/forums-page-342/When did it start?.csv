2440794,Sportdog,2014-02-11 12:22:00,6735,"My first trip north to Michigans UP, camping and fishing, annual vacation trip, was while I was in my mothers womb. I went every year until I joined the military at 18 years old. My honeymoon consisted of a trip for my new bride and myself......and a week later camping and fishing with my family sleeping in a tent. I still remember catching good numbers of large perch and my grandmothers skill and cooking them in a giant cast iron pan. I have vivid memories of trolling for pike with my dad and anchoring for perch with grandpa and grandma. Back then, the heads of large pike got nailed to a tree in the campground. Yeah I know. Not cool but that's what they did back then. My dads boat was a 12 wood V-bottom with a Johnson 3HP, that my youngest brother still has as a decoration for his apartment. Three years ago by a strange set of circumstances I was introduced to NW Ontario. I wish that I had been going there for many years before that. I'll be taking my oldest grandson this summer and can't wait to add this to his outdoor experiences. The north country, with the bear watching, the loons on the water and their cry at sundown, and watching whitetail deer drinking at the lake in the morning fog, a smallmouth bass smashing a black Jitterbug on a lake as smooth as glass, lakes with no cottages, runs deep in my soul and always will."
2440818,Guest,2014-02-11 12:26:00,0,"I was the only one in my family that liked to fish. When got m first car, a 1962 chevy corvair, brand new, myself and a buddy headed north to Calabogie Lake in Southern Ontario after learning about the fishing there from a family friend. It was a long ride from Philadelphia back then on rt 17. No interstates to speed the trip. The lodge was all inclusive, run by a U.S. couple and the help were cute young Canadien girls. Fishing out of 16 ft cedar strip boats with 10 horse motors we caught nice largemouth bass and pike to 24 inches. The lodge had boats on numerous side lakes and I had an air-cooled Eska 3 horse that you could hear a mile away. On one of those side lakes (Virgin Lake) one evening my buddy and I caught our first two decent walleyes trolling rapalas, a lure that was just coming into the U.S. To make a long story short and believe me, I can remember a whole lot about that trip, just as if it was yesterday. I was captured by the fishing, the beauty of the area, and the hospitality of our hosts. Been going back to Canada ever since. I've never regretted one trip."
2441026,The Donger,2014-02-11 13:35:00,48,"Grew up in Wisconsin and my fondest childhood memories are fishing with my Dad before he passed (I was eight). Remember digging crawlers out of the flower beds every night with a flashlight and fishing the Wisconsin river banks during the day. Trips up to the Eagle River chain when my Mom could afford it. Trips to the Boundary Waters on the Gun Flint Trail when I got older. Taking the kids up to the Clearwater, Pipestone lakes for a week of walleye, northerns and lake trout. Flying out of Nakina on a week long canoe trip down the Opichuan and into the Albany River. Boy those brook trout tasted good around a campfire in the evening. Now I am an old geezer and we fly out of Red Lake to the northern outposts. Still more walleye, northern and lake trout and they still taste great. Seems like the best times and best memories involve a spinning rod in my hand and a cold Labatt's at the end of the day. Hope those good times continue for another decade or so."

Got convinced by Tony Small from the Red Pine Lodge in Sioux Lookout that we should try his place. We did. We will be going there again this year (different owners now, of course). I think what ""hooked"" us is the beauty of the different terrain in Canada (in addition to the great fishing). The rock formations, especially, are so different. The Northern Lights, the wildlife, the serenity, the comaradarie of good friends - all make the 3 of us look forward to that special week every year."
2442050,drlee,2014-02-11 18:46:00,409,"From the mid 50's thru the early 60's, my grandparents took me to Ottertail Lake in Minnesota for a two week stay annually. At first I was limited to smaller lakes around the area that were loaded with crappie, bass, small walleye, northerns. Later on, I got to fish walleyes on the Big Lake (Ottertail) and I loved every minute of the time I spent there. Full limits of walleyes in the 3-5 pound range were the norm. I got busy with school, girls, then raising kids and chasing better jobs so my fishing was limited to trout fishing in northeast Iowa...which came to be an absolute obsession for me! Then, I took my son to Ontario (Eagle Lake) in 1987. Except for a couple of years over time, when I was changing jobs (school administrator in Wisconsin), I returned to beautiful northern ontario and now as a retiree spend a month up there every summer. I have fished 25 different lakes up there but have now narrowed it down to two, with two weeks spent at each lake. I will do this until I am pushing up daisies."

My mind gets flooded with so many great memories....First trip was with my Grampa, my Dad, and my older brother. Went to Caliper Lake and stayed at Larson's. This was probably about 1969 / 1970. I was 11 or 12. We already were fisherman, but we hadn't fished much for Northerns or Walleyes.We spent the week soaking large minnows under large red and whites.Surprisingly, we caught a lot of big Northerns, and some decent walleye, and bass. Flash forward --------We spent about 15 years camping on LOW, up in Alfred's inlet. We found a great island that was suited for tents, and a cooking station. You don't find that too often on LOW.Great times, and fishing. Every year different in a fun, challenging way.Eventually, a lock was installed between Turtle lake, and Alfred's. We decided to look elsewhere.We tried a few things; did a fly-in to a Lake Trout lake, which was GREAT,and wound up at Ross' camp, on Clearwater.For another 15 - 20 years, we stayed at their outpost cabins on both Jackfish lake, and Ottertail.I wouldn't trade my memories for a trunk full of jewels.I'm not allowed to talk about the fish we caught ....... Being able to spend QUALITY time with your Dad, brothers, uncles, and friends ------------- priceless!"

I remember almost vividly my first 2 fish I caught on my first trip to Wapikimanski when I was 9, fishing 3 in a boat with my dad and brother. My first was a walleye probably 16"" or so maybe smaller but my second fish was a big pike. We were fishing below a falls in fast moving snaggy water. At first contact, I'm screaming ""I got a fish, I got a fish"", but my Dad says that he thinks I got the bottom and to begin whipping my rod to pop it free. About that time my Dad takes my pole and does his dangest to free my snag when, you guessed it, my snag starts moving. Well, my Dad gave me back the pole and I landed a very respectable pike. Back then we didn't measure anything, we used those crappy Zebco scales but I would guess it to be anywhere from 35""-40"". That night, the rest of the fellas were really talking it up and I was hooked for life."

I was 16 the last time I was there. Trolling for crappies or bluegills from the the middle seat. Chasing grasshoppers and frogs for bait. Spending every other minute on the dock, catching lots and lots of bass and pike. The only permanent structure on the lake was a bar/ bait shop, whose dock I fished from. It was small, dark and freezing cold during those July summer days. You had to hesitate in the doorway for a few seconds to wait for your eyes to adjust to the light. The 12 oz bottles of Coke were the best. I was fascinated by the Hamm's beer sign with the bear standing next to the shimmering "" sky blue waters"", wondering how that sign worked. For whatever reasons, fishing and I parted ways for a long while. In 1997, my father in law invited us to northern WI for a weekend. The spark was rekindled and we now have a place in NW WI and get up there once a month during the summer months. Ah, but then in 2008 I get a call from Pooch(Remember Pooch? He started this thread.) Pooch invited me to Savant Lake in Ontario. I spent the first day on the lake gawking at the sheer beauty of Mother Nature. Since I was the Newbie, I fished with Pooch the first few days. He caught the first fish, of course, a nice golden 20"" walleye. As Pooch is unhooking it, I wonder where the stringer is. He releases the fish and I am sitting there with my mouth hanging open. What are you doing, I ask. Too big to eat, Pooch says. We still laugh about the look on my face when he turned that beauty loose. This July will be my 8th trip to Savant. Rick PS: I had the Batwing lures in black, white, and yellow. Never caught a fish with one."

I wouldn't change a thing!!!! That adventure literally changed my life forever. That's me in the green hat. My grandfather is 86 and won't be with us much longer.

2445217,IaDave,2014-02-12 15:21:00,476,I was a little late to the party- My first trip was in 1997 at the age of 42 and it was a fly-in out of Pickle Lake- Albany River Outfitters. I was hooked the minute we headed up 502. It was the remoteness and the fresh air that did it- the rest was just icing on the cake. The first 3 years did a fly-in every year but after driving thru Sioux Lookout on the way up and back I figured there was no sense going the extra 3 hrs to Pickle Lake so I bought my first boat and since then I have made at least 2 trips a year and sometimes 3 mostly to the Sioux Lookout area but also took it all the way to Pickle Lake. It is hard to explain to people that don't go what is so great about it but it normally only takes one trip and they are hooked also.
2445249,REG,2014-02-12 15:25:00,445,"My parents vacationed in N. Wisconsin for a number of years before they had kids - usually in the Boulder Junction - Sayner area and must have loved it because they never missed a year. So about 8 months after I came along, I got packed in the car with everything else and I headed North too. My brother and I went to N. Wisconsin every year until my dad passed away when I was 18. I have loved the north woods and lakes for as long as I can remember. I've always felt like I'm at home up north, even though it's only for a week out of the year.I didn't get up north as much as I'd wanted during college and during my early working years, but was able to make a few trips with cousins to MN which were fun. Then a friend needed another guy for a Canadian houseboat trip to Lac Seul in the fall of 1986 - perfect! The drive was so much longer, but the fishing was incredible.We've been going to NW Ontario every year since - at first, just the guys, then later, with our kids and families. I look forward to my trip north all year and am happy that all my kids look forward to going just as much as I do. The fishing and scenery are always great.But I still get back to N Wisconsin every fall for 4 days of Musky fishing with my brother - and another ""adopted"" musky nut - to fish Boulder Junction lakes and enjoy the fall colors. The fishing isn't nearly as good as Canada, but it's always like going home."

That's the one that injects the Northland direct into your veins.The piece de resistance for me trip to Eagle Lake to a remote island camp. Conditions were much different in 1952 as you might think. We were to arrive at a specified time at a pier and the camp owner picked us up in a boat and took us to camp. No phones or electricity.After a day of catching walleyes, my dad decided to help a young lady in the next cabin who was having trouble lighting her coleman lantern. He was having trouble as well so he opened the tank to check the gas, whereupon he was sprayed with fuel which ignited. Fortunately he had the presence of mind to stop/drop/roll. I think he invented that technique that night actually. I remember him rolling down the hill and seeing a puff of flame with every roll. Well, the owner got him buttered up and we spent the night at the hospital in Fort Francis. Undaunted, but in pain, he fished the next day and through the week, bandaged but with the use of one arm.I clearly remember this after 62 yearsLater in my years I wondered why he helped the lady with a chore he knew little about and I concluded.....wait.....nevermind.Two years later we started a tradition of annual trips to Lac Des Mille Lacs that lasted until I entered the USAF. Too many good mermories to mention. Same 2 am depart, same restaurants, same gas stops, same alternator failures.Fast forward to today. After many years of work in the USAF and elsewhere, a group of old USAF buds from around the country meet in Ontario each year to scratch the itch and tell jokes and relive life. We are all in our 70s so at some point we'll know when to stop. Until then...see you on the water."

Their family took a 2- to 3-week trip every summer someplace and it almost always involved camping and fishing. When we were around 10, they took a trip to Ontario. Hearing their stories lit a fire in me that was finally tamed when my dad relented in 1984 and took me to Ten Mile Camp near Ignace. The day we were supposed to leave I was running a high fever and Mom thought it would be best if we postponed. Dad was able to convince Mom that I could handle it and we made the all-night trip. I think I woke up at the border in the midst of a spectacular lightning storm. A few hours later, my fever had broke, and we in the midst of God's country. I was hooked from the moment I saw the vastness of the area. I remember that trip vividly...mosquitoes, shore lunches, my first walleye, my first pike...it was all spectacular even though the fishing was average by today's standards. Since that year (I was 14), I've been to Canada almost every year--the past 15 to northern Manitoba. Thanks for the thread."

A few of the ads are for baits that still exist, e.g., Arbogast, Heddon, Silver Minnow, etc, but many are for baits which probably most present day anglers never heard of. Names such as Mercury Minnow, Bug-A-Boo, True Temper Speed Shad, Tweedler, etc. I get a kick out of reading these old ads; some of the claims are quite humorous. As are some of the present ads. Bill"

The trip used to be my Dad, Uncle and bro every year but now I'm the only one who has kept the tradition. I can't imagine not going up every year.

2444697,lassh,2014-02-12 13:24:00,553,"1972, just prior to sophomore year in college- Went up with 3 friends, none of them who really fished. My fishing had been limited to bullheads and crappies in Sabula, Iowa. I had been fascinated in earlier days by Field and Stream magazine (and later by Fishing Facts). We borrowed an old 6 horse motor and headed north to Ontario to a mystical ""Black Lake"" one of the guys had heard of from someone he worked with. We all piled into Mike's old green Chrysler with a car top carrier and headed north. The headlights started dimming off then on somewhere in the night fog in Minnesota on the way up. Fortunately we followed the tail lights of a car in front of us. Got searched at the border. There weren't many gas stations open at night on way up so the Holiday Station was like an oasis. We never found Black Lake but settled on what I think is Andy Lake and camped on an island in my dad's tent. We rented a boat from the bait shop there. On the second day there, we got one of those 4"" rains and had rivers flowing right through the tent. Then there was the wild animal attack- water must have driven all the mice on the island to our tent. They chewed holes through the tent at the bottom. We were picking them off with cans of beans. Some of us were apprehensive about drinking the lake water so we filled a 5 gallon can from a faucet outside the back wall of the bait shop. While chugging the now depleted can of water by flashlight, I observed a layer of what appeared to be minnow poop in the water- faucet must have been the drain from a minnow tank. We disinfected our systems with warm Carling Black Label and Canadian Ale. We caught pike, bass and perch. I don't remember any walleyes that trip. I'd go out early by myself as the others slept and heard a very large animal crunch through the brush and piss like the proverbial race horse just yards from me. I never saw the animal, I'm guessing a moose. I caught a nice pike that I saw in the water. I casted the red and white hellbender past him and cranked it down and he struck like a rattler! Sorry for the long windedness, theres so much to this and other adventures. I won $5 by catching a fish on a ""Vibra-bat, the sonic lure."" Anyway, what I thought was wonderland, a couple of the other guys thought was ****. Each to his own. But I was hooked. In 1978, as soon as I was through with schooling, finding myself, and had a real job- I went on a fly-in to Gammon Lake in what is now the Woodland Caribou Provincial Park with one of the guys from the original trip... and I've been doing at least one Canada trip every year since."

It was always my dad’s trip, and the rest of us were along for the ride. My Mom’s job was to cook and ours (us kids) was to stay out of the way and try not to get snagged. I have three older siblings, and as each of them entered their mid-teens they began staying home, but for me there haven’t been too many years since those early days in the 60s, that I didn't make at least one trip north. Still, these were my dad’s trips, and I was along for the ride.About eight or nine years ago, I began taking my own family on “our” trips. That’s when this Canadian walleye fishing thing went from being something I enjoyed doing, to an outright obsession. I've found that the entire experience is much more rewarding when it’s “our” trip. I still take my parents up each September, and even though my list of duties has changed substantially over the years (my dad is now 84), when I go with them it still feels like it’s “his” trip and I’m along for the ride."

Her sister and brother in law bought a resort in Northern MN and that became our annual vacation. That resort and those times were magical- and my grandmother was a terrific teacher of patience and love for the water. Once I hit high school, we stopped going and fishing sort of fell out of my life. The funny thing is, everyone has reoccurring dreams and mine was of the MN resort all my adult life. I finally worked up the gumption to return, taking my two sons and nephew (6 and 7 year olds) back to the old resort in 2004. It wasn't the resort of my childhood memory, but the love for fishing came rushing back and the desire to return to the Northwoods became a passion. Northern WI became our family destination, and then I took my sons on our first Canada trip in 2010- and we now count the days until we go back each year. Someday I'd love for my wife to come along.

When I got back my wife asked how it was and I told I will be going with them every year from now on. Most of the original group no longer goes just 4 of us now. They did go with us 2 years ago but I dont think they liked the changes we made. We stay out all day now and eat on the water and no more coming in at 4 and eating then playing cards and drinking till the wee hours. The original group back trolled all day everyday it was their only presentation. Now we have expanded our presentations greatly.

Fishing in the northwoods (so to speak) over the years has blessed me with many, many fine memories with my family and good friends....as it is often said, it ain't all about the ""fishing"".....while everyone wants to catch a trophy or pull fish all day long, there's so much more to heading north and experiencing the beauty of Ontario, the lakes, wildlife and making great memories along the way.Faith, Family, Friends......and fishing,Rich B"

We learned the hard way that first week that fishing lakes in the Canadian Shield is markedly different than fishing on lakes near our home. We didn't catch as many fish as I expected to. We found a secluded bay on the last afternoon of our vacation. The weather was perfect: a few puffy white clouds passing by, gentle breeze, mid-70s for temperature and low humidity. We were entertained catching a bunch of slab perch. We both realized that we found a very special place and knew that we were coming back.

Especially the last page where a guy named Jason Lucus (?) had a story every month.Many of those on this board were born north of me so it was a natural for you, but not us flatlanders here in Central Illinois where creek suckers, bullheads, carp were the norm.Just a morning thought.Pooch"
2436130,Bill Krejca,2014-02-10 06:54:00,6107,"Jason was my childhood hero. ""The thin man with the pipe"". He claimed he fished every day for one year, which was quite an accomplishment in those days. Being the Fishing Editor, he had a question and answer column in Sports Afield, along with an article each month on some aspect of fishing, small mouth being his favorite fish. One particular question which I'll always remember - ""What day of the week is the week is the best fishing day?"" ""That would be Friday, because that day is farthest from the last weekend when the fish are more heavily pressured"", or words to that effect. His was the first explanation of why he considered the color black the best color for night fishing (black is the easiest to see from the depths when looking up to a relatively lighter sky. Job Johnson was another favorite. He was the camping editor. his answer to the question "" What constitutes the best cook on a camping trip?""(Maybe any meal antwhere.) ""The ability to have all food done and served still warm at the same time"". Yeah, I kind of remember these times! As to the when the love for the north woods began for me - Although my first trip to LOW began when I was a baby in 1938, It was probably several years after, those were war years, when tires and gas were rationed, and traveling restricted.

2436282,HeHooksHimself,2014-02-10 07:28:00,725,"I remember when I lived in Colorado in the 70's a friend had gone on a Canadian fishing adventure and showed us this frozen huge pike that he was going to get mounted. His stories lit a fire in my BIL (and best fishing buddy) and me and we made a pact that we were going in ""May of 1980"" no matter what. Well, life happened and we never did that trip. In the late 90's when we had both moved east we finally got away for a trip to northern Minnesota and had our first experience fishing for toothy critters. We caught what we thought were pretty good pike, but they were only in the high 20's. We used live shiners on a treble hook and large bobber per some guys we met who told us how to fish. We were in the proximity of a particularly loud guy who had a 40-something incher and kept yelling to his partner ""get the bucking net,"" only he wasn't saying bucking. As you can imagine, now every time we need the net we yell to the other, ""Get the buck net!"" Only we know what it means. Anyway, the resort owner at the time of Ash River Trail (I think that is it) had a new boat we upgraded to and he charged us for ""scratches"" on the boat, so we determined we would never go back there and began to look for places in Canada as we remembered the huge frozen pike and had experienced a little of that ourselves. We found this place (Wine Lake) and have been fishing there pretty regularly since 2000. Now we are in our 60's and have determined that we are going at least once or twice a year until we can't do it anymore. We generally go to Wine Lake Camp in the spring (fishing unmatched IMO) and try something new in the fall. As I tell newbies when they go with us, ""once you do this it gets in your blood."""
2436362,wallydave,2014-02-10 07:48:00,2151,"This crazy addiction began during a family vacation in Minnesota one summer in the early 90's. Late summer July or August trying to fish out of crappy boats, with worse engines on a lake that the locals called the ""Dead Sea""! One of my in-laws went to Ontario the next year, a couple years later, I finally said yes to""You want to go?"" The week was to start Memorial Day weekend, working for Pepsi at the time, days off around the holidays were next to impossible to get, so I got a late start, plus I sprained my ankle that last day of work! Here I am driving North solo, a case of water holding up my swollen ankle, using the cruise control and braking with my left foot!When I got to camp, the guys were out fishing, so I lost a couple of lures off the dock.We headed out that afternoon, my first fish was a hammer handle just a few yards from camp! The next day we headed to the Wenasaga rapids and hammered the walleyes! I was hooked! That group has fallen apart, now its has been the Share a Seat thread that has kept the addiction going, for how long well time will tell!"
2436458,Lovetofish,2014-02-10 08:07:00,458,It was love at first sight for me and my wife. As a boy I didn't have much for fishing other than for bullhead and northern. But we still fished and hunted. Lucky to be invited at age 25 to Canada. Got married the next year and started our family so we didn't go back for a couple years. But haven't missed a year since and we still fish with mostly the same group. The last few years I've made two trips and that's the plan again this season.
2436690,BreezyPoint,2014-02-10 09:37:00,1581,"It started for me in 1965. I grew up in Chicago and in 1965 my dad took me to Canada with a group of friends. I was 'hooked' from that day forward and have been inching further north ever since. I worked a few years in Chicago, but then moved north to Minneapolis to get closer to the north woods and I finally bought my retirement home in north central Minnesota.I have been to Canada every year except two since 1965 and some years I have made as many as four trips. I figure that I have lived more than two years of my life in Canada.I started taking my kids to Canada when they were two and four years old and we took a family trip there every year.I really love the lake country of Ontario, not just for the fishing, but for the overall experience."
2436754,Mike Kansas,2014-02-10 09:52:00,1463,When I was 10 years old in 1955 my dad took me to LOW and it was the beginning of my affair with Canada. Every since that first trip I have done whatever I can to get back to Canada. I'm very fortunate that I have been able to get back to Canada with family and friends many times. I plan on continuing to get back as often as I can. Those of us who love fishing Canada are truly blessed by the bounty that mother nature has given us. Mike Kansas
2436850,ftfarms,2014-02-10 10:20:00,444,Mine was when Virgil Ward was GONE FISHING. What a great guy and fishing show. Didn't get up to Canada fishing untill 1990 but have gone several times since.
2436954,tackleman,2014-02-10 10:51:00,444,"In 1970 I was working in Southern Ontario and one day the boss came in and asked if anyone would like to transfer to either Kenora, Dryden, or Fort Frances. Never having heard of any of these places or where they were, I pulled out a map to find their locations. Imagine my surprise to find out they were still in Ontario but quite a distance away (1300 miles). After consultation with people who had been to that area, I chose Kenora.It was February and -40 when I arrived in Kenora and much to my surprise, I didn't feel the cold the way I did back home in Brantford. Then when I started work the first week, I started meeting the people of the area. while the area was beautiful , the people I met were amazing and the lifestyle they had was soooooo attractive to me.it took me 3 days and I knew I would never go back to the populated city life. It's been 40 years and I consider myself blessed to be given the life I have achieved in the north and the friends I have made make life worth living, and oh yes, the fishing up here doesn't hurt either."
