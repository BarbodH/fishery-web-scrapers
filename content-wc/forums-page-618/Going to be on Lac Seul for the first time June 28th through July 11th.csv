572988,Hump,2008-04-20 16:59:00,578,"I normally at Evergreen that week, but changed to the last week in July so my son can go. We are spinner fisherman. last year we found the fish at windy side of island. Steamboat was pretty good. for eaters we relied on the Wenesaga and caught nice walleyes at the mouth. You will enjoy Evergreen. if you would like more info email [email protected]"
573012,Guest,2008-04-21 09:51:00,0,I will be up at Evergreen lodge at that time also. 1/4 to 3/8 jigs in any bright color plus pink. They usually have a good selection of jigs and spinners at the resort. They are real good about letting everyone know what is working and what isn't at that time. Usually someone will point you in the right direction. I'm counting the days already.

573029,Guest,2008-04-21 14:49:00,0,"My favorite topic, Lac Suel in late June/early July. wow kickback, 2 weeks. I only get 1 about that same time. We fish the east side of the lake so this is not directly related to west/central side but I let you know what we see. This time of year the crawler bite (we use 1/2 of the crawler)really starts to pick up. We almost exclusively jig. so jig with minnow, crawler, or plastic is used. Jigs in the 3/16, 1/4 ounce rule for us but can use 3/8 if need be. Spinners definitly are a favorite of some but we are used to jigging. Colors that rule for us are chartruese (especially with crawlers), chart/orange, hot pink, bubble gum (tricolored chart/orange/pink), orange. We find our fish in 15-25 FOW, but others here will tell you shallower. wind swept points, rock reefs that have wave action, mid lake rock piles are our main targets. We tend to get bigger fish if there is real deep water nearby. (they tend to hang on the edge). Have a great time, I know we always do. another good thing about that time of year is the weather starts to stablize more. we usually get between 35-80 fish a day per person."
