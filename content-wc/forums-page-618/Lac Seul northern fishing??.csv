Bigger fish tended (for us) to be on deep edges of reefs and bars, breaks from 20-30', 26-28 seemed to especially lucky, but maybe just coincidence. We always kept a bigger outfit rigged, every once in a while just work it for a couple casts. Super Shad Raps, big Spinnerbaits were best for us. A good thing for us was also big Hot N Tots, trolled or cast. Great bait for fast trolling to another spot, banging off bottom, casts great, catches everything in the lake, but pike just chomp them. The big gold with pink bottom was always a good one for us. Good Luck"
572817,bpetersen,2008-04-13 19:49:00,251,Going to northwest Lac Seul second week of June 08. I will be fishing mainly for walleye but will fish northerns from time to time. Can anyone suggest some spots to try to fish and what lures??? Pete
572854,Guest,2008-04-14 15:48:00,0,We fish Lac Seul in June and July and catch about 1 northern to 10 walleye. I have found that fishing rock walls with deep drop offs are a good place for northerns and catch few walleye. There are many spots where you can be 10 yards from shore and it may be 20 feet deep or more. Try fishing for northerns there. Say hi to Rob and Cheryl.

572867,Guest,2008-04-15 04:34:00,0,"Brent, Look for weedbeds(cabbage) usually on the south and east sides of islands. Northerns hang around this type of cover. The better spots are down the lake>Scout Lake area, Hungry Narrows, Manatoba Point, Stony Point all are good spots for larger fish. Northern fishing hasn't been stellar for about 6 years>probally why a slot was implemented?"
572878,Guest,2008-04-15 09:58:00,0,"Been fishing Lac Seul for about 15 years and love to chase Pike. Cabbage patchs are always good producers but fish run smaller in the beds. I like to fish the drops and flats near cabbage beds or timber areas. Also look for island points and current areas caused by the wind. Favorite baits the last few years are 4"" to 8"" swim baits and 1oz spinner baits-double blade Colors-Chartreuse, Red, White, Black, Orange. look for these colors in combo. 7'/ 7 1/2' med hvy Rod, Good baitcaster, minumum 15lb line mono Have Fun"

572907,Mike Kansas,2008-04-16 08:07:00,1463,"Our group has been fishing Lac Seul for 20+ years. When we first started going we did a lot of pike fishing and believe it or not a two man boat would have many days that they would catch 300++ fish. We beat cabbage beds and weedlines to death with spinnerbaits and looked for shallow bays with heavy wood or rock structure and bottom elevation changes. We don't do very much pike fishing now because our group has changed some in personnell and we now focus on Walleye and Smallmouth. When we do pike fish we find it difficult to catch any good numbers. it seems that there are less pike or we just don't want to spend the time to look for them. However the last three years we have caught the biggest pike we have ever caught on Lac Seul. 45""/25lbs..43""/43"" ..these bigger fish have come on walleye jigs with a minnow while eye fishing. We have also caught many 10/15lb pike with the same technique. So the pike has become a bonus fish while eye fishing. If I was going to pike fish now I would use our old pattern and spend time casting points, wood and bays from deep to shallow front to back. Focusing on windy areas. Big spinner baits(lots of flash), musky type baits, swim baits and large skirted jigs with big plastic or live chubs on it. Mike Kansas"

I just feel that the forage base has changed, might be due to an increased smelt population. I see alot more big pike while, fishing walleye than I ever used to. Fish the cabbage for mid to smaller pike, and current and deep water for the bigger. Spinnerbaits are probably my best pike producer."

572949,Guest,2008-04-18 13:52:00,0,Try the backwaters in Shanty Narrows. Just go slow & watchout for submerged stumps.
