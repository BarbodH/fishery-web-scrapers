In late June, I would start looking to the reefs for your eyes, however they may still be pretty shallow. Similar bite to Lac Seul. Same waterway. We went last week of May/1st week of June last year. Caught them at all depths, from 2 to 60. Enjoy. We were die hard Lac Seul people. Buddy talked me into this place. I am going to go here for the rest of my life. Crowds were very minimal when we were there. A lot of the ""remoteness"" comes from how big your boat is, i.e., how far you can travel. Even with that, it is easy to find your own spot. PM if you want more details..."

A couple of spots that always hold eye's are the Chutes, English and Rice Rivers. Try ripping shad raps in the fast water below the falls at the english river. Last year caught so many my arm hurt. The record was 23 in a row."

They hauled gas cans to the docks and you filled your own boat. Every gas can we had leaked. Bear in camp every night as garbage cans were emptied midday. Waited 4 hours to get checked out (left day early). Better camps and better fishing elsewhere in my opinion. No assigned dock space, so musical chairs every night with tiedowns, etc."

I don't need 5 star accomodations so it was fine by me. Nice lake, not a remote lake quality, but I have caught some of my best walleye and pike on minnitaki. Easy place to fish and with a bigger boat you can easily head to red pine bay which is as good of a consistent walleye spot as I have ever fished. The best single day of fishing I have ever had in my life was on this lake, but trophy's are not as common as Lac Suel."
572903,DanL,2008-04-15 23:00:00,262,We have stayed at Donnelly's for about 7 years now. We really like it. Docking is a protected area and is now assigned. The fishing for walleyes and pike is very good. It is also an easy lake to navigate as far as Canada is concerned. Also they were pouring the concrete slab for a new fish house when we were there last August. I think it will include a vacum sealer in the fish house. The cabins are also nice with 2 or 3 new ones in the last couple of years. I have gotten to know the owners and they are very easy to get along with. On the down side you they still bring gas down to the docks from the pump above. They could also use a few more electrcal outlets at the docks when they are booked. Otherwise great lake and great resort.

They are always on the grounds to make sure your needs are taken care of. Always take a few sunflower seeds, a case of beer and leave your line a inch out of the water!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
