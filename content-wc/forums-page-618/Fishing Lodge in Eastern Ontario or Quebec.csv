I am not looking for anything to fancy in terms of accomodations, however I would like to find a place that offers an american plan, guide service and quality fishing. My preference would be a remote lodge, but I am not against going to a drive in place. Thanks in advance for your help."
572619,pike50plus,2008-04-03 17:42:00,584,bushlandadventures.com Many great camp and lodge options and I can highly recommend them! If you want i can email pictures from our 2006 trip.
572620,phishfearme,2008-04-03 17:54:00,1242,"you may want to consider ray's camps out of biscotasing. they have a ""full plan"" where they provide the food but you have to cook. the camp is on ramsey lake and you drive to bisco then take a barge to a portage up to ramsey lake and i believe ray's is still the only camp on this hugh lake. walleye and pike and an excellent lodge - get one of the upstairs rooms. phish"

573057,beagle22b07,2008-04-23 06:29:00,34,"PM Two places I would recommend depending on how far you want to drive. The first place is Club Trout Lake about 25 mile out of Belleterre, QC. It's about a 15 hr drive from the Pittsburgh area. You can drive to the main lodge and stay there or travel by boat to one of their outpost camps. They have a very elaborate tram system to transport gear from lake to lake. So if you like the comfort of electricity you can stay at or near the main lodge. If you want an outpost, you can boat into one without the fly-in expense. I would rate their facilities as the finest I've ever stayed in, but we chose a cabin near the main lodge with electricity. The second place is Domaine Poutrincourt about 20 hrs drive out of Pittsburgh. Andre and Eric are excellent hosts and like Trout Lake, they also have cabins near the main lodge or boat-in outposts. Once again, very fine accomodations along with the best walleye fishing I've experienced. The first time we went in 2006, our group of four caught over 450 walleye. Very easy to find fish, just look for structure near a drop-off and it will produce. If you would like to chat further, drop me an e-mail at [email protected]. Larry"

You can fly in from North Bay ONT or travel 60 miles of dirt logging roads to an amazing spot with great service. We've always stayed at the outposts, but they have cabins at the main lodge too.www.ogascanan.com Cheers, Kevin"
