573030,nicko,2008-04-21 15:29:00,508,"Ok....So with that said, we are headed in on Sunday morning and out Saturday morning. Both around 8-9am.....Bad indifferent or what? If I have to drive 2 hours or more to go through Baudette then I might as well stay in line at I-Falls and save the gas and wear and tear on the truck. Thanks...Nick"
573044,Mohleye,2008-04-22 07:35:00,368,"It looks like the Baudette route is only about 20 miles further, if you're travelling from Grand Rapids, MN to Nestor Falls. Maybe a toss-up on the way up, but Baudette would be a no-brainer on the way home."
573048,rpieske,2008-04-22 11:05:00,1276,"Mohleye is absolutely right. Go up Hi 46 to Northome, then West to Hi. 72 North to Baudette. With your crossing times this is the best way to go. The time you save on border crossing will more than make up the additional 20 miles driven."
573049,Guest,2008-04-22 12:14:00,0,"We have come home on Sundays around that time of year nicko and the line to go into Canada in the mornings on Sunday are not long as long as you get there no later then 8:00am. Now coming home on a Saturday, if you can not get there early (before 7:00am) or later (after 2:00pm) I would go to Baudette on the way home. So if you are staying close on the Sunday going in you have no excuse. Get up and go.. usually not a problem for us as I can never sleep the night before. good luck"
573050,Sutsgold,2008-04-22 12:26:00,219,"Most lodges run from sat - sat. That being said, saturdays are terrible unless you get there early. I would be concerned with the trip back more than the trip up. Best of luck"
573052,Guest,2008-04-22 16:27:00,0,"nicko, i left you a message last night on your cell phone. call me. sunday am should be no probs.this is rick from west chicago.my cell number is on your voice mail."
573055,nicko,2008-04-22 23:52:00,508,Will do...I am in Texas right now...back Friday....
573064,Grappler,2008-04-23 11:11:00,47,"If you are coming from Grand Rapids MN, we have traveled the route that Bob mentioned above for the last 5 years. Grand Rapids is actually one of our gas stops. The route from there to Baudette is pretty easy. Relaxing, not as much traffic as 53. I would recommend going to Baudette and over. We go about an hour North of Nestor Falls. Last year all 3 trucks were 18 mpg pulling the boats due to no traffic. Good Luck on your decision. Grappler"
573070,nicko,2008-04-23 13:59:00,508,"I think the decision is made. Sounds like the way to go. If you don't mind me asking, which camp are you going to? Thanks...Nick"
572954,nicko,2008-04-18 17:43:00,508,We are headed up June 21'st. I expect to get over the border on the 22nd. We are staying in Minnesota the night of the 21st about 2 hours from International Falls. What's the crossing like Sunday morning? 9am or so? Should I consider going to baudette? How about the return the following Saturday? probably the same time 9am or so? Any suggestions? Thanks...Nick
572957,rpieske,2008-04-18 19:46:00,1276,"It can be awful in I. Falls on the weekend. Sometime 3 or more hours either way. However, bookings are really down this year according to the camp owners I have talked with. I would suggest that you not stop 2 hours South of I. Falls but drive on and cross at night. Stay on the Canadian side. Or...get up at 0 dark 30 and cross before 6 am. If you can easily come up through central Minnesota and cross at Baudette there should be far less of a wait at the times you say you will cross. Here is a link to wait times at the border:http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/general/times/menu-e.html That should help if you have access to the internet while traveling."
572961,Guest,2008-04-19 06:25:00,0,A Sunday morning crossing would be fine going either way. I think 9 on Sat. is too late?? Expect to wait a hour or 2. The one time last year I was in a line it did move pretty quick! Dennis
572965,phishfearme,2008-04-19 12:14:00,1242,you can check current wait times at:http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/general/times/menu-e.html maybe check your estimated crossing times a week or two prior to your date to get an idea. phish

The >one time last year I was in a line it did move pretty quick! >Dennis The weekend Nicko mentioned is Muskie opener. It is probably the busiest weekend other than the two surrounding the 4th of July. I cross the border at I. Falls regularly all summer long. I will not cross on a weekend because of the wait times. Rainy River/Baudette is much better. Crossing I. Falls at off times helps; i.e. prior to 7 am or after 8 pm. on weekends.
572980,Guest,2008-04-20 07:31:00,0,"Bob- how far & how long to Baudette? We take 53S so have to come all the way back. It would be nice if the cell worked so could check the wait time, but doesn't work until we're approx. 5 miles W of the falls! Normally we don't cross un Saturdays. Dennis"
572992,mountaineer,2008-04-20 18:39:00,2,"Will be flying into Duluth on 6/7 and will be crossing at Beaudette. Will be taking a western then northern route to the border. Wondering what to expect as far as road type (2-4 lane), condition of road, and approximate travel time to border. Thanks for your input."

Dennis It's about 70 miles over to Baudette. How much time you will lose depends on which way you go after crossing into Ft. Frances. If you head toward Nestor Falls and Kenora, it will add an addition 78 miles to your trip. If you are coming up 53 from South of Superior and Duluth I can give you an alternate route to Baudette and back to the turnoff North on 71 to Nestor Falls/Kenora. That will only take you 55 mile more and you avoid Duluth. You take US 2 West from 53 all the way to Hi. 46. Go North to Northome on 46. Turn left on Hi 1 to Hi 72 North to Baudette. Cross over the bridge to Canada, turn right on Hi 11 to Hi 71 North to Nestor Falls."
573004,rpieske,2008-04-20 20:29:00,1276,See my answer to Dennis on the route to Baudette on Hi 2. The roads are for the most part two lane and times are pretty good. I travel them frequently towing a boat and have no complaints. It's a little over 200 miles and three and a half hours depending on how fast you drive and if there are any detours.
573027,nicko,2008-04-21 14:00:00,508,"Thanks all. Since we can't change the trip at this point and yes, it is Muskie Opener. If we hit I-Falls prior to 8am I am assuming it's better. Does that also apply to our return trip the following Saturday from the Canadian side? We will be coming up from Grand Rapids, Mn. We are heading to White Pines just North of Nestor Falls. How far out of the way is Baudette? Thanks...."
