572970,walleye_wal,2008-04-19 19:44:00,12,"I booked first week of december. My group of 8 is going the second week of june. I was in contact with approx 10 resorts on different lakes, about 3 of them could accomadate us (boats included) in the month of june. Luck would have it that we found one for the second week. A big problem was not enough rental boats, a couple camp had only one or two boats left, but they had cabins still. wal"
572971,Guest,2008-04-19 20:48:00,0,To get the best time for the resort I go to we booked April 1st 2007 for June of 2008. They open up times starting April 1st for the next year. Scott
572777,Glenman12,2008-04-12 10:36:00,762,We've been going to the same lodge now for 22 years..the owner now takes it for granted that we are coming up again the following year in the same week..
572780,IMWalleye,2008-04-12 10:42:00,35,My reservation (1st week of June) just rolls from year to year. Pay the deposit in December.

572835,Guest,2008-04-14 08:20:00,0,"We usually commit when we check out the previous year. We have a group that varies between 6 and 8 and its never the same group. In full we are a group of about 10, but for some reason or another we have never been 1 full group. We have been to this resort 4 years and they have always been pretty liberal about when they get the deposit"
572848,Guest,2008-04-14 14:29:00,0,"We usually get our time slot for the next year about 10 minutes after we get signed in for the current year. We've got the last week of May / 1st week of June spoken for and don't want to loose it. It's usually a group of around 10 so we want to make sure we get the big cabin and don't get slpit up. So far, so good. No problems with the cabin or filling spots. Keep'er on the bottom! JohnB.O.A.T."
572865,Guest,2008-04-14 22:56:00,0,"Our group books for the next year before we leave camp, that way we get the same week and cabin every year. The camp owner will not book anyone until the customers he has for this year are not booking for next year. The repeat business is a high percentage of the overall business."
572868,Catman59,2008-04-15 04:43:00,345,"We usually pencil in our week for the next year when we pay for the stay . As most of the customers are repeat , we are given preference on cabins and schedule over new customers."
572872,Guest,2008-04-15 08:11:00,0,The best lakes/river sites book up very early. A year in advance is not too soon. My outfitter says she is already getting inquires for the '09 season.
572882,Guest,2008-04-15 10:43:00,0,"For years I would book the following year the same day we checked in, .....biggest problem became we never knew which cabin we would be ""placed"" in the following year. The owners are more focused on ""selling"" the most number of beds, instead of providing the overall experience of a trip to Canada and a making their guest feel welcome. hmmmm guess that is why the majority of the regulars have moved on to better places to stay."
572928,Old Critter,2008-04-17 09:59:00,14,"I book as late as possible. Almost impossible anymore to ""guarantee"" to an outfitter a full group nine to twelve months in advance. Something always happens that causes one or more folks to drop out. Sometimes the whole group has to cancel. Because I'm not married to any one camp, I can always find a slot at a good camp as late as April or May for something in in June or early July. Times are different now. Just to have a stable of good camps to choose from and then start making the calls. For most September fishing you can find a slot on one to two weeks notice. This approach works best with just two or maybe three people. I'm done with the herds anyway."
572748,Rose_Cliff Lake,2008-04-11 16:42:00,116,"I'm curious for those of you that go to new places, when do you typically book your trip? What month? Thank you in advance."
572750,skindzier,2008-04-11 16:57:00,137,"Many years I've booked in the spring - I've got a bunch of people in my group that have a hard time making a decision - not everybody goes every year. Makes it kind of a pain - if I didn't like 'em so much I'd find a new batch of friends. :) This year I booked a bit earlier, since the place we stay on Lac Seul has some big cabins, so I could commit when I got four, but still could add up to six people if necessary. It helps that we usually go around July 4th, so that isn't prime time. Hope all is going well for you, Rose! I'm kinda living my dream through you a bit. We almost bought a place in 2005. You gotta be getting pretty excited - the season's getting close!"
572751,pike50plus,2008-04-11 17:24:00,584,I usually like to book before december of the prior year unless I don't have enough commited people for the camp size guarantee. This year for Campbell lake outpost at Dunlops in manitoba we booked in Nov.
572752,stevensinks,2008-04-11 17:32:00,330,We booked last week. but most years we book earler .
572753,prov1900,2008-04-11 18:54:00,544,"Somewhere around Christmas or into the first week of the new year. Like to get it in early to start planning the excitement. Of course, like was said before, it is all about getting the other guys to get off their duffs and make a decision."
572754,Guest,2008-04-11 19:08:00,0,"We typically book around the end of the year or a little earlier. We start getting the word out to anyone who might be interested in going around late summer or early fall. By the time December rolls around, it's time to get serious and ask for money. This is when you find out who really wants to go. We try to book somewhat early since the camp fills up quick. We put together a group of about 10 and work with the camp. They cut us a little break on the price since we have a good size group and are returning customers. They are pretty easy going and try to accomidate their customers. Things usually work out pretty well since both sides are willing to give a little if needed. It also helps that they run a great camp with excellent service, nice accomidations and top notch equipment. And the fishing is fantastic. Wingmann"
572756,tly,2008-04-11 19:50:00,1900,"We are pretty boring. We generally book when we leave, confirm around the 1st of the year & deposit. But also, we are a pretty consistent group and have been doing this for many many years. This year we are at risk but have folks waiting to join so we still can make commitment, which is good cuz we are deep in heart attacks, stents, replacements etc. We have also reduced the # of trips. Will miss Lac Seul. TLY"
572758,bpetersen,2008-04-11 20:14:00,251,"Hi Rose, I try to book 1 year in advance... Pete"
572764,Guest,2008-04-12 06:39:00,0,We commit before we leave camp for the next year and send full payment right after Christmas to take advantage of a nice prepay discount.This is for our spring trip.....Our Fall excursion usually moves around and we book that one this time of year.There are usually plenty of late September openings. We also take full advantage of any prepay discount offers
572765,Rose_Cliff Lake,2008-04-12 07:38:00,116,"Skindzier I'm curious as to what stopped you from buying? Would you send me an e-mail, [email protected], I was wondering what camp and lake you looked at."
