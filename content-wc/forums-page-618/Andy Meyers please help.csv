Eagle is a clearer water fishery in my experience with a good Muskie population and some giant northern if you luck into one. I have not fished Eagle in the early season for walleye in some years but understand the walleye have recovered significantly since the slots were implemented. It is a great lodge, Steve Herbeck is the kind of guy who genuinely enjoys giving you info on the lake and catching fish on Eagle. I have not done his flyouts but there is some discussion of them on his web site. We are headed up to Andy Myers in Sept. for a week of fall Muskie fishing. Good luck."
