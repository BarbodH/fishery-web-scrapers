I had out over 300 yards of line and it took me 4 hours to land this pig. I took him back to the dock and had pictures taken and then drove him 1500 miles to my house and threw him in the swimming pool. I go out and swim with him every night. He is easier to get along with than my wife."
571250,Hawgeye,2008-02-07 11:52:00,1355,"Caught a 12lb 14oz greenback in Pine Falls at the mouth of lake Winnepeg. It was 31.5"" and was just as pretty as can be. Had that pantented deep emerald green that the water is famous for. I have caught a few others in that 12lb range from there and had a 12lb 10oz at Selkirk on the Red. Another ""greenback"". My most memorable fish is the 31"" Minnesota walleye that I caught. I never weighed it and I am sure it was not as heavy as the one at Pine Falls but it likely was in the 11lb range. I do have some awesome pictures though! It has been way too long now since I have peaked the 10lb mark...probably over 7 years. It is fun to read the ""big fish"" comments."
