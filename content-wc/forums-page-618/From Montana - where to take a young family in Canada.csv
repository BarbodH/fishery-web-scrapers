I grew up there and have spent countless hours fishing it. In fact, I plan on spending two weeks in June fishing there myself. G&S Marina's is top notch from what I understand. I was going to recommned them myself, but the fishing can be really tough on Last Mountain at times, and it can get a little hairy weather wise too. On the upside, G&S offers a guide service for a reasonable rate, and the potential to catch some real trophies, easily 10lbs+ is always there, along with some huge pike. The marina is right next door to a really nice provincial park too, nice treed campsites, really nice sand beach, and lots of other amenities. Search for Rowan's Ravine Provincial park for more info. Regina, a city of about 200,000 is only about 40mins away on good pavement in case you want to get away for an evening or do some shopping for a day. Location and ammenities wise, I would highly reccomend it, the only wildcard is the fishing, when it's good, it's REALLY GOOD, but it can be really bad too. I guess that's true of most lakes though. Let me know if you decide on going this way, I'll see what I can do to help you out. Waxy"
572265,Guest,2008-03-18 20:34:00,0,"More great responses- thanks to all for the advice. Growing up in the midwest, we always had access to a friends fly in cabin NW of Red Lake. Didnt appreciate that at the time like I do now. The weeks up there each summer meant the world to me, and did a lot to influence careers and lifestyle choices later in life- including where we currently live and are raising our family- as opposed to the bigger cities and higher wage options. At this point, we're most interested in a simple, clean place with steady action for walleyes and pike- regardless of size (as long as they are at least bigger than the bait we're using). I live in Helena, and we have Canyon Ferry nearby to chase big fish, but with the kids at this age, its more about sheer numbers and easy success than big fish at this point. Its always fun to have a chance at a big pike sneaking in and surprising us though! Due north of Montana, I've found a few places around LaRonge that look promising, but prices are pretty high, and I seem to get a better feel for the NW Ontario area at this point. The thought of trailering a boat that sort of distance is not very appealing however, but any trip east can always be combined with a visit to the in-laws in Wisconsin. Looks like more research on southern Sask should be in order. Again-thanks for all the help thus far---"
572270,Waxy,2008-03-19 08:30:00,2938,"The only lakes you're going to find in western southern Canada (AB,SK,MB) that will offer the kind of fishing you're after are the reservoirs of southern AB. Take it from me, steady action is not going to be very likely at Last Mountain, Diefenbaker, Buffalo Pound, etc... The best bet would be the lakes around Fort Qu'Appelle, but even they can be a real test at times. Southern AB lakes such as Traver's, Forty Mile Coulee, Milk River Ridge, Crawling Valley, etc... along with Pigeon Lake, are your best bet for steady fishing action, but the kind of accomodations you're looking for will be a lot tougher to find. A little Google work on these lakes may turn up what you're after. I guess if you're willing to drive all the way to La Ronge, you're pretty serious. If I were you and willing to go that distance, look into the Hanson Lake Road (runs NE toward the MB border), and Deschambault Lake, the fishing is far better that way than north of La Ronge unless you're flying in. There are lots of fly in camps that are a very short flight out of La Ronge, but you better start booking right now and be prepared to pay some pretty big $$$. Waxy"

There are countless lakes on that road. There are cabins for rent at most of the larger lakes. Deschambeault is awesome and you are only 6hrs from Regina. For another 45 min, Jan Lake has more cabins."
572288,Guest,2008-03-19 19:45:00,0,"What about Deschambault & Jan Lake? Have found a couple places up there which look decent, and of course the fishing is always described as ""fantastic"" -- but I've also heard from some people that the lakes are commercially netted. Any knowledge about that, or the fishing on those lakes in general?"

Any >knowledge about that, or the fishing on those lakes in >general? They are netted to some extent. The fishing's not what it used to be from what I've heard, but still really good, especially in June. Deschambault and Jan are BIG lakes, so there's lots of water to cover, that can be good or bad. You may want to look into some of the smaller lakes along the road that have accomodations. I haven't been up there in years, so I can't really say what's going on these days. Waxy"

Any >knowledge about that, or the fishing on those lakes in >general? I go up to Jan Lake every summer and it has been great. June and early july is the best time. It gets good again towards fall. We were up at Deschambeault last July 1 and got 20 walleye among 6 people in about 4 hrs in the middle of the day. Both lakes are fished commercially, but not to the point where it affects the fishing. They are both huge lakes, and there are lots of places to try. As I mentioned before, the accomodations are better at Jan Lake and I would say there is less chance of weather keeping you from fishing. Even when the wind is up, there is plenty islands so you are still able to get out fishing. Descham. has more open water and tends to get rougher."
572677,Guest,2008-04-08 11:40:00,0,My daughter lives in Big Sky country now. She married a local from out there. I took her and the in-laws to Evergreen on Lac Seul a couple of years back. They thought it was the best trip they have ever been on in their life. I have been going there for 18 years. It can spoil you for fishing back home. I can't wait to get back there every year.
572836,Guest,2008-04-14 08:23:00,0,"Hi from Colorado to Uncle Al. We just missed you last year. Looking forward to seeing you and your family this year at Evergreen. We always enjoy Evergreen and everyone who keeps coming back. Feels like our second home. Always get to see old friends and make new friends there. I'm sure fishing will be great, as always. Maybe we can wet a hook together this season."
573051,zzlaw,2008-04-22 16:08:00,34,If you are comimg from Montana it makes the most sense to travel north as opposed to northeast or northwest - my email is [email protected] - I am a fishing writer from Saskatchewan - drop me an email and details and I'll be glad to help - before I am busted by everyone I am not saying for a moment that the suggestions haven't been great it is just that there are many opportunities due north of where you are that may make more travel sense by distance - you should also know that we have travelled to Montana to fish too - love Fort Peck Reservoir - zzlaw
573092,Guest,2008-04-24 19:35:00,0,Take highway 4 north from the border all the way into the Meadow Lake Provincial Park. There are more than 1 dozen lakes to fish within 30 - 60 miles of each other. I'm a fan of Keeley lake. If I had no job I'd fish there every day from the May long weekend to the middle of July. Tons of 20 -26 inch walleye and big pike. Good luck
572658,Guest,2008-04-07 08:19:00,0,"Don't know whether you've found a place yet.... But, check out Evergreen Lodge on Lacseul near Ear Falls, Ontario. They have nice cabins, best boats on the lake, very reasonably priced and owners are great. They usually have a family plan in July and August. Lac Seul has very good walleye and pike fishing in July. We've been going now for the last 8 years and wouldn't go any place else, so check them out."
572674,meese,2008-04-08 09:27:00,6,"I agree with fishlip. I went out towards Ear Falls last year and had a great time. I think sometime later in the season they have a pretty good music festival. There's a lot of decent resorts out that way, plus a ton of bald eagles (which the kids might like)."
572075,Guest,2008-03-12 00:24:00,0,"Been blessed with two young kids (8 & 12) who are nuts for fishing, but as with many other young families, we don't have a huge budget for a trip into Canada for two adults and two kids. Coming from Montana, I'd like to find a housekeeping arrangement, probably to a drive or boat in location for 4-6 days of fishing for pike, walleye, bass-- pretty much whatever will cooperate. We have our own 17' boat if needed to cut on expenses, and are most interested in finding good numbers of average sized fish, hopefully with a few larger thrown in to keep it interesting. Alberta, Sask, Manitoba, even NW Ontario if its our best option. Anyone have any good suggestions for a family? Thanks in advance"

572117,Guest,2008-03-13 15:25:00,0,"I would pick anywhere in ontario. a good first question to ask the resort is this, can we eat the fish, is it safe to eat everyday for a week especially for pregnant woman? we went to saschawan last year and the fish or questionable about that. even out here in nevada where mining and other things are going on the fish are not safe to eat more than once a month. there are web sites from the government about this."
572163,Guest,2008-03-15 22:36:00,0,Thanks for the suggestions- am looking into them all.
572232,Waxy,2008-03-17 15:38:00,2938,"There are many lakes (reservoirs really) in southern Alberta that have excellent walleye and pike fishing. Perfect for kids - the fish aren't huge, but the action is generally really steady. I'm not sure on accomodations though. Google Alberta Parks or camping in Alberta, I'm sure there's tons of info available. I wouldn't bother with the time and expense of travelling all the way to Ontario, or anywhere beyond AB for that matter, when there's prime fishing less than a day's drive from you. Spend your time and money fishing, not travelling. Waxy"
572238,Guest,2008-03-17 17:40:00,0,I was trying to find something close by to us and would love to hear of places in alberta. the only thing they seem to have were fly fishing places.
572242,JohnAB,2008-03-17 18:42:00,49,"Southern Saskatchewan be a good place. Close to home in terms of travel and probably better limits than anything we have in Alberta if you want to have a shorelunch so to speak. Buffalo Pound is just outside of Moose Jaw, Lake Diefenbaker, the Quepelle (sp) lakes etc all offer good fishing and camping. Boundary by Estevan has largemouth bass. Meadow Lake Provincial Park is a great place for families. Nice beaches, lots to do and a very good variety of fish species to be pursued on the numerous lakes found in the park. In Alberta it would be the southern areas like Forty Mile and Travers for walleyes, Ghost and Lake Minnettanka(sp) in Banff National park I believe for lakers. For pure numbers of walleyes and decent size Pigeon lake is hard to beat but it is strictly catch and release for non-residents for walleyes. I have fished NW Ontario ( Lac Seul, Minitaki, Kawaweogama, Deception lake and Sen bay to name a few) and pigeon will fish with those lakes anyday. Just do not have the variety found around Sioux Lookout for fish though. Lesser Slave Lake is also a good walleye fishery and is a big lake as well with modest limits. Sturgeon Lake by Valleyview allows you to keep 2 walleyes over 43 cm and has decent walleye and pike fishing and a very nice provincial park (Youngs Point). North Wabasca Lake also allows 2 over 50 for walleyes and has good walleye fishing although not much of a family place. Rock Lake north of Hinton is one of the most beautiful lakes you can fish as it is set right in the mountains. Lake trout and pike are the main fare but the streams there offer up some good stream fishing for rainbows etc. Has a nice park as well. Road in though is not the best as it is gravel for the last 30 or 40 km's or so. This is all off the top of my head so do not quote me specifically on anything but I have fished most all of them and camped at most."
