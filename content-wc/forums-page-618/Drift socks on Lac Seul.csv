572834,Guest,2008-04-14 08:18:00,0,Going to Lac Seul for the first time second week of June. From what I hear walleye can be shallow - 2-10 feet. Does anyone use drift socks to slow your troll/drift and for boat control when the wind comes up? Or does it spook the fish that shallow? Thanks for any advise.
572838,Guest,2008-04-14 09:02:00,0,I've seem them used plenty on Lac Seul. Never wanted to use one myself as I find in solving some problems they just create other problems. NWO Fishing Bum

572846,Guest,2008-04-14 12:11:00,0,A drift sock should be in every trunk coming to fish up here. They can turn a bad day of fishing into a good if you know how to use one. Boat noise will spook fish when you are shallow before a sock will. just my 2 cents
572847,Guest,2008-04-14 12:56:00,0,"I've brought a drift sock with me to Lac Seul 5 times and have yet to use it. For me, conditions never warrant it (but I'll bring it again this year.) Most of our boat control is close to structure so we use the electric trolling motors for trolling, hovering or controlling drift. Even when drifting, the TM is ready to maneuver us out of trouble. We don't do enough open water drifting to use the sock. Keep in mind the term open water in Lac Seul includes big rocks and reefs popping up anywhere. If your boat won't have an electric trolling motor, backtrolling might be easier than the using a drift sock. We mostly slow troll spinner rigs and switch to jigs when we find em."
572860,Guest,2008-04-14 19:28:00,0,"we have been fishing Lac Leul for the last 15 years and I have only used the drift sock once and that was when my trolling motor batteries went dead. we are there the end of July/first part of Aug.butI would say get a couple of good anchors and alot of jigs. Fish the side of the islands the wind is coming into and work the rocks and humps that open to the main part of the lake.We work till we find the fish then anchor and while anchored we nail the larger fish. We find clear line and the lightest jig you can work has been the best bet. Use minnows but when the bite is on gulp will catch just as many. If you insist on using the drift sock be very careful on the rocky wind blown side of the islands you might get yourself in trouble but don't worry about the shadow, we fish right under the boat. Just my ten cents worth. Know you fishing an excellent walleye lake and if what you try dosen't work keep trying you will find them."
572870,Guest,2008-04-15 07:40:00,0,"Thanks for all the advise. Have been going for 20 years to another resort, this is first time to Lac Seul and very excited about it. Much bigger water than we are used to so just want to be ready for anything - I troll with the trolling motor so it sounds like it will not be much of a problem ""not"" to have a sock. Two things I worry about are the rocks and finding fish in June. Thanks agian."
572873,Guest,2008-04-15 08:58:00,0,"In June, everything depends on the spring and the weather. I would read through the fishing reports that several of the LS lodges have posted on their websites. Several give you a few years worth of weekly reports and those are quite beneficial. I have been fishing LS for 10 years now in either the first, second or third week of June and I can tell you that while there are some general patterns, it does vary considerable by the year. My thoughts (and I am no pro) are to start out shallow and fish the windy side of points . By shallow, it could mean 2', but generally I start about 7"" and work my way out until about 15' That usually puts us on fish. However, if the spring is early and the weather warm, I might not find fish until 20'. LS is a tremendous fishery and you will hear discussion about fishing the sand ""reefs"" that are present in the lake, but from my experience, those don't seem to turn on until late June and July. Depending on the spring and where you are in the lake, their is a good weedbite as well that is often overlooked in the lake. Weedbeds are not common where we fish, but once they get going, they will be the home to a resident populaton of walleye. Finally, on a really warm day with little sun, don't overlook the really shallow bite. I don't understand why, but LS walleyes will surge into very shallow walleye on a warm, calm day in mid-June. We will pitch light jigs into water as skinning as 2' on rock/sand shores and do very well, including some very big hogs. While a walleye is no bass, they will surprise you in skinny water by how hard they fight. Now the last thing to remember is LS is very big and what I have experienced in the central part of the lake may or may not be the same as what others find in the eastern or western end. I have never fished the ends of the lake so I am not sure if their structure is similair to the central part. Enjoy. Every lake in Canada is special but LS ranks right up at the top of the list.

572877,Guest,2008-04-15 09:46:00,0,Thanks IA - This helps a lot. We are staying on the West end near Ear Falls but plan to travel somewhat. The only real way to find fish is to get out there and start looking - it's nice however to get some advise from those that know a bit about the lake. Hope you have a great trip!
572902,Guest,2008-04-15 22:53:00,0,"Thanks again IA Walleye - Your experience on the water is greatly appreciated by me and many others I'm sure. We will be up the second week of June, let you know how our first trip truns out. Take care."
572916,bpetersen,2008-04-16 19:12:00,251,"jrako, You sound just like me. I have been going to Canada for about 25 years and this will be my first time at LS in the Northwest section by Ear Falls. This sight has been priceless for info. I have made some good e-mail contacts. I figure they are the experts. I am going to use some gps readings people have sent me, some fish gps and some hazard gps readings. Good luck, Pete"
572935,Guest,2008-04-18 09:28:00,0,bpetersen - When are you going up? We will arrive in camp June 7. Looking forward to it! Anyway would you be willing to contact me so I could take a look at those gps areas? It's a bit nerve racking going to a new lake and not having a clue where to start. Anyway thaks for the post...you will have to let me know how your trip was. Take care.
572952,bpetersen,2008-04-18 16:39:00,251,We check in on the same day as you. Send me an e-mail. [email protected]
573019,Guest,2008-04-21 11:46:00,0,"bpetersen, Tried to e-mail you a few days - did it go through?"
573036,bpetersen,2008-04-21 21:07:00,251,Gone over the weekend. Will be sending some information. I have been helped by many people from this forum. Pete
572890,Guest,2008-04-15 16:22:00,0,"JRAKO No problem. I am sure you will hear all sorts of advice on lures, but here is a bit a more Jigs - Not sure color really matters all that much, but I fish 95% of the time with pink heads and white twister tails. My jigs are usually 1/8 oz. That handles just about every water condition we fish so I don't have to spend time retying every time we hit different depths. I might go 1/4 oz when I know the water will be a bit deeper or if I am fishing current. The twister tails are 3"" single tails. I have used charturse as well. Not sure if the colors matters or if I just feel more confident with pink/white, but I always catch fish with that combo Spinner rigs - When we backtroll rigs, I tend to use hammered brass with chartruse beads. However, my father likes black and white with silver backing. I would say our catch rates are pretty even. I have also done well with orange/gold rigs as well. We used to use in-line weights but we have switched over to bottom bouncers for ease of use and reduce hang-ups. Cranks - I always end up pitching cranks during the day simply becuase I get a bit bored jig fishing all day. Plus, when the fish are hammering, they will hit a crank as well and this helps me target the large rish (or so I think). I have fallen for the Rap-X especially when I am throwing right to the shoreline. It allows me to fish a nice range of depth without hanging up. Plus, it the right places you can catch northers, walleyes, and bass back to back. If the water is a bit deeper, I will go to a Shad Rap or a Husky Jerk. Color for me is anything as long as silver with an orange belly. Again, not sure if color matters too much, but I know what I have confidence in which makes me pay more attention and fish harder. All but one of our biggest walleyes (over 28"") have come on jigs. Last year (fishing around June 15), our biggest walleye (30.5"" came out of 10' and the two next biggest came from about 18'. While I have never fish LS at night, I have found that due to the water color, fishing is just as good at noon as it is a 8:00 AM or 8 PM. Finally, LS is a big piece of water than can start to roll nicely with the wind. Depending on your boat, you need to keep an eye on it and if bad, don't hesitate to go to shore to sit out a blow. We fish out of 18"" Lunds and even with those there have been a couple of times in 10 years where we went to shore and sat for an hour rather than take the pounding and the chance. Have a great trip and send an update when your home. IA Walleye"
