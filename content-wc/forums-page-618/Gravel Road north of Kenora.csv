572410,Guest,2008-03-24 18:09:00,0,The Redditt road has great fishing near it. I worked in the area when it was only accessible by plane or train. Some of the best fishing I have ever experienced.
572430,Guest,2008-03-25 19:36:00,0,"Right on Canster, have fished up Redditt Road since '77, my two favorite walleye lakes are located here. Road is paved til Town of Redditt."
572523,Guest,2008-03-29 11:36:00,0,"I've driven up this road (English River Road) several times to the English River. It goes north of Redditt at the end of 658, it's a gravel road mostly for logging trucks I believe. I've been going to Black Sturgeon Camp north of Kenora for about 40 years. It's an interesting drive up the English River Road. I believe the only camp accessible from this road is Separation Lake Lodge. You access it by driving to the English River bridge, parking there, and boating to the lodge. I think the lodge is about 7 miles from the bridge. Some day I'll trailer my boat up to the bridge and check it out while I'm at Black Sturgeon Camp! Anyone know what the daily launching fee is at the English River bridge ramp?"
572850,Guest,2008-04-14 15:03:00,0,It was $5 when I was there two years ago. Work prevented me from going last year. My wife and I stay at the camp ground at the bridge each year for a week and one night while we are there we go to the lodge for supper. Go to the Seperation Lake Lodge web site for a great picture from the air.

On the way there we passed a couple of Drive in Lodges whiched looked nice. Looking for Drive in in this area with Smallies as well as Walleye and Pike. Anyone know what name of resorts might be? Or any others close. And not LOTW or Rainey. Nothing against them, awesome fisheries but want smaller water. Thanks Joe"
572173,woods,2008-03-16 10:20:00,646,Big Sand Lake at Minaki is about 40 miles north of Kenora. I wonder if you passed near it? There are alot of posts about drive ins at Minaki.
572175,joeman79,2008-03-16 10:45:00,417,THis was a Huge gravel road with a lot of logging trucks on it. Might have been part of english river system but there were no towns on this road. Been over 15 years ago so my memory has faded. Thanks
572185,Guest,2008-03-16 22:50:00,0,"Joe, I think you were probably on gravel road 804. It goes left off of 105 a couple miles south of Ear Falls and passes several drive in resorts. There is one at Camping Lake that used to be called EJs. However, it resently sold and now has a new name that escapes me. Manatou Falls on the English R. is another camp off 804 along with Pakuni Lodge on the south end of Pakwash Lake. I have been going to Pakuni for several years with fair success for the types of fish you asked about. After you pass these lodges the road continues to Long-Legged Lake. Not sure if this is the road you were asking about, but I hope this helps. Brad"
572190,Guest,2008-03-17 05:58:00,0,Caribou Falls maybe?

572385,Guest,2008-03-23 22:32:00,0,Separation Lake?
572407,Guest,2008-03-24 16:51:00,0,I looked at Satelite Map and Looked for a winding road and it goes by seperation Lake I believe and several others. Road went straight north off 105 I believe and other response was road coming from east heading west. Was a beautiful drive.
572408,joeman79,2008-03-24 17:06:00,417,I think by the looks opf the map it might have been road 658. BUt I am not sure. Is Seperation Lake off that road? It don't matter I was just curious.
572409,dewyg,2008-03-24 17:13:00,1006,"It is called the english river road, it takes you up to seperation lake/umperville etc.. It is a long winding dirt road, you can do the sand lake loop and go over to Whitedog dam and the Minaki area. This is past Redditt."
