572955,Guest,2008-04-18 18:33:00,0,"Hi Rose, Glad to see you have implemented a lot of fantastic ideas from the board. If you continue to listen to your customers, I have no doubt your camp will be a great success. Best of luck to you and I hope you have a great year. Wingmann17"
573005,Rose_Cliff Lake,2008-04-20 20:40:00,116,"Thank you again for the ""good luck"". I have listened to all of you out there because you KNOW what you want and expect. I could not have had better feedback than all of you!! I like to believe that we were born with 2 ears and 1 mouth for a reason. I am listening."
573022,Obabikon,2008-04-21 12:35:00,2370,You rock Rose! Haha... sorry I've been MIA for a couple of weeks. The little one has been a bit of a distraction! I think I'll take her on the sportshow tour next year!
573023,Guest,2008-04-21 13:12:00,0,"One more thing that I thought of... I'm sure you are waiting w/ baited breath I don't know that I've been to a resort that makes it easy to recycle usually just one trash can in the cabin makes it hard to separated the cans and plastic. I'm not a green type, but it does make me feel guilty throwing that stuff away, plus w/ scrap metal pricing going through the roof it could be lucrative. Hey maybe take the $$$ from the aluminum cans and put it towards the meeting area/fire pit With the economy the way it is, I'm sure it's going to be a challenging year or two but a quality product never goes out of style!"
573024,Rose_Cliff Lake,2008-04-21 13:52:00,116,"Jared, Glad your back, I was worried."

We would pay extra to rent a DVD player and a 20"" TV... I would think you'd be able to buy on of those all in one units pretty cheap and have it paid off in no time"
572749,Rose_Cliff Lake,2008-04-11 16:53:00,116,"Since December I have asked for your help with questions I had. American plan vs. housekeeping Does your camp do a lunch Do you take the camp owner fishing What would you change at your camp Does your camp allow dogs...ETC I am grateful to all of you that gave me feedback. Each time you brought up something I hadn't thought about. Different points of view. This was exactly what I was looking for, so.... THANK YOU AND I HOPE YOU HAVE A GREAT TRIP THIS YEAR!!!"
572759,bpetersen,2008-04-11 20:16:00,251,"Rose, Please do a post to let us know how things are going. Pete"

572793,jerry bark,2008-04-12 16:02:00,822,"if you do all that before you open this year you should have a really good season. I guess your planning to institute the mosquito free week that i suggested next year? good luck, jerry"
572794,Rose_Cliff Lake,2008-04-12 16:27:00,116,"Jerry Bark LOL. I wasn't sure how to address that because we don't have a mosquito issue on Cliff Lake. Really, I didn't put that down because nobody would believe me. Sooo, every week is a no mosquito week, ha ha. From the list of improvments, it will be ongoing. Hope to complete it by mid August."
572807,jerry bark,2008-04-13 09:10:00,822,"Rose, I looked up your website and i think you have a camp very similar to where i go in terms of size and features. I also think your pricing is very reasonable. Mosquito free every week??? I would be there if it weren't 20+ hours of driving. good luck this year, jerry"
572831,jokerjim,2008-04-14 07:40:00,473,"Rose , you may want to rethink the""sweat rolls"". It looks like you have a great camp. Keep up the hard work and good luck this coming season."
572844,Rose_Cliff Lake,2008-04-14 12:00:00,116,"Thank you!!! The ""sweat rolls"" have been removed from the menu. LOL"
