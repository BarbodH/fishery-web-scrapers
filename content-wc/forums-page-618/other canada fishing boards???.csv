572851,Guest,2008-04-14 15:13:00,0,"Sure, there are plenty. Here are a couple that I frequent: Thunder Bay Fishing is a site devoted predominantly to the area 300km radius around Thunder Bay (i.e., much of north-central and northwestern Ontario). The site has a fairly large, yet tight, group of regulars who also meet in-person regularly throughout Thunder Bay for both fishing-related and social (i.e., drinkning) activities. Check out the message board at: www.thunderbayfishing.com The Ontario Fishing Network (OFN) has a heavily-used board which has now been around for close to a decade. Though it's called the 'Ontario' fishing network, it's really focused on Southern Ontario in particular. I like to go on this site to remind S. Ontatio anglers that any ""true fishermen"" would never live in such an area of high density human population! Check it out at: http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/ Fish hawk has a fairly knowledgable and growing community. There has been some good chats on there recently. Check it out at: http://www.fish-hawk.net/ I too have been on Walleye Central since '02, and this 'Canada' board tends to focus heavily on northwestern Ontario (NWO), though many of the other posters are American who frequently (or more often once annually) visit Canada. You'll tend to find more Canadians, and thus more discussion on pure fishing and less on fishing vacations, than is commonly the case here on WC. Now you'll need more time daily to 'check the boards.' NWO Fishing Bum"
