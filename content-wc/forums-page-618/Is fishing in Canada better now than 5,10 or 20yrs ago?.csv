572962,Flip Silverlake,2008-04-19 09:15:00,645,Fishing LOTW since 1962 and the fishing for Walleye's now is as good as it's ever been. It slowed in the late 80's and early 90's but has really picked up over the last couple of years. Will be back there the second week in June until the end of August. MMMMMMM that remindes me I need to pick up somemore jigs!
572987,Guest,2008-04-20 16:45:00,0,"I think it really depends on what lake and what species. As far as LOTW's goes, I think it's gotten better. Fewer fish being harvested (commercially and by anglers) and better slot sizes. There's also a great increase in releasing the ""big"" ones. Infact, all of last summer, I didn't have a single guest ask to mount a fish. That wasn't because there weren't fish caught big enough to mount, but anglers get more pleasure out of releasing the big ones now. Muskies are the species that have benefitted the most by fisherman education (how to handle) and conservation. I see more 45-50 inch fish than I can ever remember."
572989,2746,2008-04-20 18:22:00,3206,"Have been fishing Eagle, Lac Suel. Gullrock, Red Lake and Nungesser over the past 35 years. Although at my age my memory plays tricks on me when I try to think back 20 years:-) I believe fishing is better today than it was 20 years ago and probably on par with where it was 35 years ago. I'm no expert but believe it has to do with the slots and limits (Just look at Gullrock over the last years) and I remember how I felt when they were first introduced. Thought if I couldn't bring home a freezer full of fish for a neighborhood fish fry why go. Now I love watching those big ones swim away after a good fight. Don't know that it will ever happen but wondering what could be accomplished by going to artificials over live bait. Have read (don't know that it's true) that as many walleye die from the deep hooks one gets with live bait as are taken for eating. I expect there is some truth to it. I'll be trying gulp and soft plastics a lot harder this year."

I fish primarily for walleyes. Sometimes for smallies. NEVER for muskies -- been there, done that, I hate it, never again. LOW has definitely gotten better for walleyes. 20 years ago, they were STOCKING walleyes in LOW!!! One of the world's greatest naturally producing walleye fisheries had been burned out by netting and overfishing. Now, with better management of the resource, the lake is back and flourishing."
572803,Guest,2008-04-13 07:11:00,0,"I know the equipment/techniques are much better and along with maps,GPS, and the internet. Part of my question is now we all have this knowledge available to us so has it forced us to fish differently? Example, we have only been going to LOTW for 4yrs and the 1st week in June will be our 5th trip(Sabaskong Bay) but we are still learning and find ourselves not really taking advantage of the latest techniques. For example,we are not walleye fishermen and catch our fish to bring home and that's it and we catch them every year simply fishing a jig/minnow or by accident casting for other species. How about everyone else?"
572808,Pooch,2008-04-13 09:26:00,4619,"I don't know if fishing has gotten better or that most guys that are serious about fishing are getting better at finding and getting fish to bite. Some years I'd swear that the fish are getting more plentiful and bigger then other years the weather pattern and available forage makes it a tough bite and it seems just the opposite. One lake we fish seemed to be slowing down the last few years then on last years trip my wife and I really caught a ton of smaller (15-21"") walleye. Appears to be a good year class moving through the system and fish size should really pick up in a couple of years. I've noticed and others seem to have also noted that last year was a little slower than past years because of the Canadian weather and lake levels. If fishing were the same every year it would be boring. No challenge. It's fun when the fish at times seem to be jumping in the boat, but it's more satisfying when you use your head and experience to keep your rod bent when the catching gets tough. My long gone fishing hero used to tell me when I was a kid ""fishin' and catchn' ain't the same thing"". Pooch"
572816,onemorecast,2008-04-13 19:32:00,23,"I initially thought no way is the fishing better today than 20 yrs ago. Then I did the math (1988). The pressure and management in 1988 was not nearly as good as today. No slot, catch and release was not practiced as much and on the trophy end no fiberglass replicas. I would say it accross the board on most species it is better>"
572820,rpieske,2008-04-13 21:24:00,1276,"Pooch: I think you hit it on the head. Were we the same fishermen 25 years ago? Of course not. Each year I've become a little smarter than I was the year before. In the 60's and 70's the numbers of fish were there. Today, the numbers may not be as great, but the size is better. I'll take size over numbers any day."
572829,Guest,2008-04-14 06:24:00,0,"Rpieske, Question(s) for you. We too visit Nestor Falls(1st week in June) and I was wondering if you ever fished Caliper Lake? My father/I heard that they have pretty good crappie fishing in that lake and I would like to give it a try? Any thoughts on Caliper or other lakes in the area we could trailer our boat to catch some nice crappies? Max"
572857,rpieske,2008-04-14 16:16:00,1276,"Max: Caliper can be good at times. So can Obabikon Lake, but you can't go by road, only boat. I hear that they catch some decent crappies on the lake Arrowhead Resort is on. I don't fish for them but even LOTW can be real good if you know what you are doing at certain times of the year."

572915,lassh,2008-04-16 18:31:00,553,"On fly-in lakes walleye fishing is much better than it was 20 years ago due primarily to the slot limits and you really don't need to mount a trophy to be a great white hunter anymore. Average size is noticably larger and numbers are at least as good probably better. It seems that the pike fishing has diminished a bit. I'm not sure why that is. Do you remember long ago when guys would hold pike by the eyes to ""keep them still?"" I also remember a quote from a guy- ""We're sportsmen. We only keep walleyes above 5 pounds."" The change paradigms has really positively impacted the walleye fishing. Lake trout fishing is about the same."
572936,pike50plus,2008-04-18 09:59:00,584,"I think it is relative to how remote a place you go too and how far north. Most od the far north places i havegone over the last 20 years are all C&R, and have been that way longer tyan most. Thosw places seem to be as good. The lower area's like Chapleau where I use to go before that were not keeping up year to year. IMHO."

572773,Jimmy Jig,2008-04-12 09:34:00,1905,For the most part fishing was better 20 years ago....
572776,IMWalleye,2008-04-12 10:32:00,35,"20-25 yrs ago at Lac Seul, the fishing was crazy outstanding - numbers and size. Now it is just outstanding - but better than 10 yrs ago. My opinion - the management (limits/slots) has made a huge difference since the mid 90's."
572781,Guest,2008-04-12 12:12:00,0,All depends on where and what species. NWO Fishing Bum
572784,AllenW,2008-04-12 13:17:00,11482,"Might also depend on who you ask, I've hit Red lake for over 25+ years and it seems we do better on the average each time we go, but we also know the lake better. I'd guess for the first timers it wouldn't supprise me that 25 years ago fishing was better. Not for certain though, as the slots weren't installed because of low fish numbers, but to keep the numbers that were there constant. I'd like to go back in time and fish Red with what I know now 25-30 years ago, be interesting I bet.. :) Al"
572791,rpieske,2008-04-12 14:27:00,1276,"On LOTW, the fishing was better 25 years ago...especially for muskies. The numbers were greater and skill level wasn't as critical. Now there are more large muskies, but not the numbers of fish. The rusty crawfish has made changes in the lake."
572796,Guest,2008-04-12 17:10:00,0,"Been fishing LOTW since the early 1980's. Fished for walleye, northern, smallmouth, crappie and perch. Not a muskie fisherman. From my experience, it seems that the fishing is better now. Had some netting, liberal limits and not much catch and release back then. Now little netting, smaller limits, conservation licenses included in resort packages, and a great emphasis placed on catch and release seems to really have made a difference. In the 80's, our goal was for everyone to bring home a full limit of fish. Now some of the group bring a few fish home while others don't bring any at all. Wingmann17"
572798,Guest,2008-04-12 18:22:00,0,"My family has been at Lake of the Woods out of Morson for 34 years and in the early years if someone brought in a 5 or 6 pound walleye it was a big deal and everyone would come down to the dock to look. Now large walleyes are so common it's no big deal - there are more big walleyes caught now than there were thirty years ago and now they are almost all released. The biggest reported in 2007 was 12 pounds. In the 70's everyone wanted to come fishing in June and pull one oz. sinkers and spinners around the lake - now because of improved maps and depth finders and GPS I believe fishing is better in July and into August because you can effectively jig on the thousands of reefs of Lake of the Woods. The maps we used in the 70's had ""X's"" all over but there were no reefs under them - very inaccurate. Also the crayfish thing on the lake may have something to do with the walleyes - I believe those big walleyes are feeding on crayfish on the reefs."
572800,Guest,2008-04-13 04:48:00,0,I've gotten wiser. The fishing's gotten better.
572801,MoWalleyeguy,2008-04-13 06:07:00,409,"I believe that fishing is MUCH better. I have noticed a marked improvement in size and quantity in the past 10 year especially. I am talking about ""MY"" experiences fishing LOTW's in the same area. Can't wait to see what this year brings!"
