572642,Guest,2008-04-04 19:43:00,0,Fished with white river air 4 times. Fly ins. Pretty good fishing for numbers and would always get a 27 inch eye or two and a 38-40 inch northern. good outfitter with decent service and equipment. would go back again but go to a private camp now. eric
572647,Rich B,2008-04-05 22:25:00,1081,"Have gone up to Happy Day Lodge the last few years (about 2 hours east of Wawa). www.happydaylodge.com Is a ""drive-in"" and is the only camp on this lake - will be going back (wasn't able to do so this year). Good fishing and very clean camp with good owners....very nice lake and can get off by yourself. It's worth checking out, though do so soon, as they always have a very high rebooking rate and it's often hard to get a cabin by this time of the year. Good luck with your search....feel free to email me if you have any questions. Rich B"

572661,Guest,2008-04-07 08:33:00,0,We fly out of Wawa to Pine Portage lodge on kabinakagami lake. This year will be the 7th time. Great place and good to excellent fishing. plent of walleye between 14-22 with bigger ones now and then. We always catch a few pike in the high 30's to low 40's.
572823,Guest,2008-04-13 22:25:00,0,Thanks for input guys May try a second trip in the fall this year and seeing how this is much closer It may make it all that more easy to do
572895,Guest,2008-04-15 19:35:00,0,"RG, Last July we went up for a week and fished the Whitefish/Manitowik lake system. It is 20 minutes east of Wawa. The fishing was tough the first few days as it is a lot of water to cover. Once we found the spots the fishing was quite good."
