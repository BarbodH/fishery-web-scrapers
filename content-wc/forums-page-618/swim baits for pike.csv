Have never used them personally but read article that was written by someone who fished a Way North Manitoba or Sask. Lake. And had great sucess but there were lots of weeds, and I don't suppose there will be much cabbage in early June. Any other tips would be great also."

Used them in August Last year and we were fishing to shallow and never got a touch. But got lots of Husky Jerks and other big stick baits and Buzzbaits. Hope they will hit a Buzzbait that early. 41 days and we are on our way. Gettin anxious.
