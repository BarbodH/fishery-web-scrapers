511437,Guest,2001-03-12 14:07:00,0,I'm looking to go on a northern ontario fly-in. I'm looking to catch bass walleye and pike. Why is it that most fly ins don't have a lot of bass and only advertise their pike and walleye fishing?
511438,Keith,2001-03-12 16:03:00,48,"I read several years ago that smallmouth bass were stocked in lakes along the railroad going west of Thunder Bay. I have personally fished on fly-in trips out of Wawa, White River and Armstrong and were no smallmouth in those areas as per the outfitters. You will find smallmouth north of Minn. but not very far north of the railroad."
511439,chrism,2001-03-12 16:26:00,429,"Most fly ins are north of the smallmouths territory. If money is no object, then there is no other fly in for big pike that comes close to Knee lake lodge in Manitoba. I believe over 40% of all the master angler northerns (greater than 41"") came from that lodge in 1999. hey do have a website.As for walleyes, there are lots to choose from."

511441,chrism,2001-03-13 19:43:00,429,"Yep - been there done that! I think Eaglenest is my fav place to fish for smallies, wallies and pike - Not to mention the scenery. Unfortunately I didn`t get there as much as I wanted to last year as I was exploring other areas north of Winnipeg."
