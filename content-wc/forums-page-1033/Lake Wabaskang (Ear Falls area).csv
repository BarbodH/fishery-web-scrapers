This will be my second year and so far we haven't caught anything of any size.--- nothing over 21"". Is there anything bigger in there??"
511119,Guest,2001-02-17 14:16:00,0,"I haven't found any maps other than those available at the numerous lodges on the lake. We've been fishing this lake for 15+ years. Probably covered every square foot of walleye water at least once. We generally fish it in early to mid June, so fish have usually been somewhere between post spawn and pre-summer peak. Average size has definitely declined over the years, since this body of water gets hit pretty hard. Numbers though can be still make the trip worthwhile. Big fish are not plentiful, but they're in there. Still don't have a 10#, but we've had numerous 7's and 8's. All the narrows always draw alot of attention, but they yield mostly skillet stinkers. Work the main-lake points. The 25"" and up fish have almost always come from structure near 25' to 60' of water. There are 100's of such spots, and the ""honey holes"" seem to change from year to year. Minnows on rigs are usually best. Troll slow and keep your lines wet. Good luck."
