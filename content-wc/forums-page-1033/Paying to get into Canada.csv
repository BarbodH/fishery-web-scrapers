511381,Guest,2001-03-07 15:12:00,0,"A friend of mine, whom I fish with alot in Canada, told me yesterday there is a $10 fee when crossing the border. New in 2001. For this you get a coupon book which entitles you to stuff and additional border crossings. For the life of me I can't figure out what he is talking about. Help!!! Going up in May.Thanks in advance....eyesnatcher"
511382,Dan,2001-03-08 06:22:00,325,"What he is talking about is the head tax on Americans. And the rate he quoted was wrong its $100.00 and the ""coupon book"" is for a free tour of the 'Revenue Canada Department Building' in Ottawa which is where all the head tax revenue goes. Hope this helps."
511383,Guest,2001-03-08 06:45:00,0,"What is a head tax??? Never heard of it, it is new this year. We go to Canada alot as we only live 150 miles South of the Canadian border.ThanksSharon[email protected]<:))))><"
511384,Guest,2001-03-08 07:43:00,0,The only head tax I heard about is the tax on your beer..that is the head on the beer. Someone is pulling your leg.
511387,wiggle,2001-03-08 10:09:00,400,I just went thru the border on March 2nd and there was no tax! They didn't ask any out of the ordinary questions either.
511388,KnottyBuoy,2001-03-08 13:41:00,110,He may be confusing the $10 toll they are now charging on the US side for crossing at Intl Falls........our resort mentioned it in their yearly news letter.......No charge if you cross at Baudette......or Pigeon River......
511389,dlhomes,2001-03-08 19:15:00,62,Has the toll gone up?? It was approx. $7 for truck and trailer and cheaper if you buy a coupon book. The $7 did'nt seem to matter if it was Canadian or U.S. so gues what I use!If it has gone up blame the paper co. it's thier bridge!
511385,gofish,2001-03-11 20:22:00,24,Where do some of you people get these crazy ideas?? There has never been a head tax on American guests coming into our beautiful country. That would be insane. Do some real studying about CANADA before firing off stupid remarks!
511386,River_eye,2001-03-12 13:33:00,1486,"I think he was just making a joke, not meaning to deter people from coming up here.River eye"
511390,Karl,2001-03-13 20:47:00,63,"Wrong on the ""blame"". It's the fault of the local and regional politicians. They didn't want to have to ""raise taxes"" in an election year, so they more or less forced the paper company to put up the cash for a new bridge. The paper company relunctantly agreed, but said they'd have to raise the toll. Read all about it in the local newspapers - they're all on the web."
