My group and I fished Wenesaga three years ago.While we were there we caught alot of walleyes a few northerns and some misquito bites. The only bad part of the trip was the walleyes are small. We would catch thirty to fifty fish a day each but most of them were only cigars.We also hiked up river to bluffy while we were there, the fishing was slower but the fish were bigger, just remember you have to carry everything! We were treated very well and stayed in a good cabin with good boats motors and a nice cleaning house. We have evolved some and we now fish Lac Suel. Wenesaga is nice place if you arn't fussy about the size of fish you want to catch. We would rather catch a few less fish but you will catch alot of big walleyes on Lac Suel."
