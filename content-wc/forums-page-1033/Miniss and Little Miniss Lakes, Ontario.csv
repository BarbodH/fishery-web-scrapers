511404,Guest,2001-03-08 08:35:00,0,My father and myself are going to be fishing on Little Miniss Lake and were wondering if anyone could tell us what baits work best. We will be fishing in mid-July.

We fly in with Hawk Air out of Hawk Junction-they're a real good outfit.We take night crawlers and use crawler harnesses on bottom bouncers, three ways or weight added to the line. Many times we were able to cast rapalas and the like. Some of the guys trolled with perch colored rapalas with good luck. I didn't have too much luck with jigs-maybe because most of the lake is less than 10-12 feet deep and not much stucture. Trolling to find the walleyes and then casting lures to them worked best. I've never tried minnows or leaches because the crawlers work so well and are easier for me to take care of.E-mail me if you have other questions about Little Miss.Good Luck"
