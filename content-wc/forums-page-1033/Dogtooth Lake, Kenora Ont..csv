510847,Guest,2001-03-11 17:56:00,0,Me and my son and brother are making our first trip to Dogtooth the first week in June. When are you going? If you are there that same time look me up so we can share fishing reports.
510848,hoghunter,2001-03-12 10:23:00,159,Hey Dale. We are going up on June 10th-14th. How bout you?
510836,hoghunter,2001-01-31 15:20:00,159,Anyone fish it or has any stories about it? Thanks for your reply.
510837,gofish,2001-01-31 19:53:00,24,"Haven't fished Dogtooth for a number of years. We used to camp there but I found the campground getting a little too crowded for my liking. There is also a lodge on the lake if you want all the conveniences. Dogtooth is a big, beautiful lake....deep & clear with lots of bays to explore. This is one of those monster Walleye lakes where the fish are big......not a numbers game though. Go to LOTW if you want eaters. The lake also has a respectable number of smallmouth, northerns & splake (lake trout / brook trout cross). But, be prepared to spend some time doing your homework. Get a decent map, talk to the lodge owners and spend lots of time on the water. I myself have only fished it during the summer and found the best walleye bite was during the evening as the sun began setting....fairly typical of oligotrophic lakes."

The fishing was ok, we did not pick up any of the wall hangers that lake is known for. But I Would go back someday. the people that run the resort there are pretty nice people. I was not happy where they had me and my girl friend staying (way up on the hill -- not good at all!!!!!) so they moved us, even had their kids help move are belongings. Have fun Red"
510839,hoghunter,2001-02-01 02:54:00,159,Thanks for your responses. I am looking forward to a trip up there in June.

My wife and I enjoy the Lake and stay at the Lodge on the Lake. Last year my wife caught a 31"" walleye. Photos and released. Some nice sized smallmouth and in the fall trip a few years ago we caught a 20# northern. The chance of the big walleye keep us coming back. Always been able to catch enough eaters also. Fantastic people at the Lodge."
510842,hoghunter,2001-02-27 11:31:00,159,What parts of the lake do you fish in June. What's your presentations? Thanks for the info.
510843,roscoe,2001-02-28 18:12:00,38,hoghunter-I will get my map and give you a shout in a couple of days. I will give you the areas we like to fish and have been successful and also the presentations.
510844,hoghunter,2001-02-28 18:16:00,159,Thanks a ton. Will be looking forward to it.
510845,Guest,2001-03-04 10:26:00,0,"Is this the Dogtooth just south of Lobstick Bay- LOTW? I thought I heard the portage was only way in and there were no lodges on it. I'm hoping to take the portage and try it some time. I have a place on Lobstick Bay. I've only made 2 trips up so far but the avg. # of eyes per day is approx. 15-20 and avg. length approx. 19""!!
