511458,Guest,2001-03-15 09:11:00,0,Thanks for the input! Every comment helps me relax a little more about going somewhere we haven't been!Was wondering if one really needs to hire a guide? How is it boating around the lake? Are there a lot of hazards around that area? and are hazards marked on any of the maps? I'm guessing it would be a good idea to have an extra prop along just in case of mishaps? Thanks!

There is a lodge on a point and a narrows right out from boat ramp. Only been there once , last year. Any help appreciatedThanks in advanceJim Ellis"
511462,Guest,2001-03-15 09:59:00,0,"Yes Jim: I'm not sure about the falls. I got the map and the only place I remember the falls is where it goes into Pelican Lake. I know you can't go to the city of Souix Lookout by water. If you come to Mpls I can give you my maps and show you where we caught walleyes. The boat launch is about 1/4 mile this side of Hudson, and it's easy to pass up. Lost Island Lodge is only about 2mi from the launch. Just go north and look to the left, you can't miss it, big signs. I'm not sure about the name of the Lodge you see from the boat launch, but they have cars. I belive you go past Hudson and take a new road and high bridge to get to that one. Lost Island is a boat in only. Jim, good to hear from you. I too am getting ready for the fishing season. We have the Sport Show this weekend, so I'm getting my juices flowing. Regards Dick"
511459,Kaz,2001-03-15 10:10:00,643,"Jiggin: We had a guide the first day for free. Don't know if Jim Hayes still does that anymore. It's a good idea to get one the first day so you get to know the lake. After that you don't need one. It's a very easy area to get to know. I would suggest Marine radios though, it's nice to talk back and forth between the boats, and they monitor one in the resort too, can't remember the channel though. I needed my office to be able to get a hold of me when I was up there and Jim's wife will call you if need be. PS She is a good cook and the kitchen staff serves a good meal if you don't want to cook every night. We did't mess up any props, but you have to be fairly cautious. Good luck...Kaz"
511460,Karl,2001-03-16 05:58:00,63,"You don't need a guide, but I highly recommend one for one day. Use the guide to locate places further away from camp, places you wouldn't go by yourself. Otherwise every point, rock, reef, basically everywhere, holds walleye as long as the wind is blowing towards it."
511448,Guest,2001-03-13 13:08:00,0,"Planning to fish lac seul first week in June and looking at staying at Lost Island Lodge. Wondering if anyone has stayed there before, opinions on the place and where the best spots for walleye are around that area. Also.... should I be concerned about any ice this year at that time? and are there certain areas you can't fish because of spawning? This is my first trip to Lac Seul so any info would help. Thanks"
511449,Karl,2001-03-13 20:38:00,63,"Check other posts on this board for recommendations on the lodge. Babe Winkleman stays there, so it's either real good or free (for him).There won't be any ice and there are no ""spawning sanctuaries"" on Lac Seul. There was heavy snow right after ice-up this winter so the ice didn't get as thick as usual and has been ""mushy"" for a couple weeks already, and the walleyes are done spawning well before you get there. Pelican Falls in great for walleyes during the time period you'll be there. No one fishes there because it's ""too close"" to lodges and boat landings. Everyone figures they need a two hour boat ride to get good fishing on Lac Seul. Fish the current with diving crankbaits (shad rap variety) and the eddies with jigs."
511453,Hawgman,2001-03-14 06:31:00,18,"Spent a week at Lost Island three years ago. The accomodations are well above average for a Canadian fishing trip. You'll like it.We were there in August, so my fishing experiences may not be all that helpful for a June trip. Just about any shelf or hump near deeper water held walleyes that time of year. The bigger fish were caught trolling larger flats. I do remember that east of camp there was a place call ""Whale's Back"" or something like that. It was a hump in the middle of a decent-sized bay. We always caught a mix of nice walleyes and smallies, plus a few big northerns, there. I do agree with the other poster who said you don't have to run long distances to find fish in that part of LacSuel. Everyone else in the group I was with brought their own boat and often made long runs. I rented a boat from the camp and stayed closer to home, but seemed to do as well or better than the other guys."
511455,Guest,2001-03-14 07:49:00,0,Anybody know how close Lost Island Lodge is to Lac seul Lodge? We are also taking our first trip to Lac Seul about the same week.
511450,Guest,2001-03-14 09:32:00,0,Thanks so much for the info!! Where abouts is Pelican falls from the resort? & Do you know where I can get a good map of the lake?
511456,Guest,2001-03-14 09:36:00,0,"I believe that Lac Seul Lodge is on the west side of the lake and lost island lodge is on the southeast side, near Hudson and Souix lookout."
511454,Guest,2001-03-14 09:38:00,0,Thanks so much for the great info. Would you happen to know when their Smally season starts up there?
511451,Karl,2001-03-14 19:59:00,63,"Lost Island Lodge is halfway between the boat landing in Hudson and Pelican Falls. It's a 15-20 boatride from the landing to the falls, so I'd guess you'll be less than 10 minutes away.I've caught some nice sized (18 in.) smallmouth there while fishing the eddies right below the falls on the south shoreline. Never fished the other shoreline.Smallmouth season is open when you'll be there, but is catch-and-release for any over 14 inches."
511452,Karl,2001-03-14 20:02:00,63,"Forgot - you can purchase good maps of Lac Seul at ""Fred and Dee's"" gas station just before you get there. At the intersection when you turn off highway 72. You go right past it. Otherwise the lodge should have good maps."
511457,Kaz,2001-03-15 06:42:00,643,"I too have stayed there. Much above the cut of other resorts in Canada. Jim is a very good host, and is always on sight to help if needed. All of the guides are seasoned and know where to tell you to fish. Lots of good water and the smallies are fantantic. I haven' been there for two years, but if I was fishing that lake, I wouldn't stay anywhere else. They have a great ""Happy hour"" on the deck every evening. Good place to swap stories with the others there. You won't be disapointed. Have a Great time. Kaz"
