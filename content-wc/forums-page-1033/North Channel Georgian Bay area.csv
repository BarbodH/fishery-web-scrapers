511191,Tyee,2001-02-25 18:16:00,60,"Rog,I went up to a good lodge up in the north channel accouple yearsago (Birch Island) for a father-son trip....great area, and hada nice week the first week of June. Unfortunately, we had (3) days of thunderstorms come through the area on late Sat, Sunday & Monday....then we fished the backside...not good.What I was told that if you're looking for walleye, go up in theSpring or early June at the latest, as the walleye pull outfor deeper water. If you go later than early June, you'll needa guide for any walleye. They have huge Pike up that way, andthat's what we targeted, with some limited success...and got into some fairly decent smallmouth bass fishing.The Birch Island Lodge was clean, good food and had nicecamp boats (although we took up our own).Good luck....best advice I could give is to book early spring,if you're looking for walleye.Tyee"
