Walleye fishing is pretty good and in July the small mouth are the most active. There's an area called Grassy Bay on the NE end of the lake that has as plenty of small mouth that will hit top water plugs. Cabins are good, boats and motors are fine. I still get a guide for the first day to help find where the fish are (why waste time looking for them ?) and for a shore lunch. Don't miss the chance to go to the outpost musky lake-there are plenty of fish in it."
