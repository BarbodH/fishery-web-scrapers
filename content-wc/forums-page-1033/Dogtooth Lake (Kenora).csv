511443,Guest,2001-03-13 11:07:00,0,I am planning my first trip up to Dogtooth lake near Kenora this next June/July. What can you tell me about the lake? I am looking for a lake map of Dogtooth. Any fishing tips would be appreciated as well as any general info. Thanks

Dogtooth is a Trophy walleye lake and we have found that you do not get numbers of fish like you do in some other lakes, but you do get quality fish. Last year my wife got a 31 inch walleye. The end of June and first part of July should be a great time to fish the lake. Dogtooth Lake Resort has a good map of the lake. I have been trying to find mine which I have marked different holes, but must have mislaid it. If I can find it, can scan it to you. Easy lake to get around on. Also has some terrific smallmouth fishing. Five years ago in September we even caught a 20 lb northern. Lot of structure, rocks and points to fish. We throughly enjoy the lake and now go every summer. The two ways we have found to fish the lake are to jig and to lindy with a split shot and minnow or leech. Some big fish are caught that time of the year you are planning on going."

Barbless hooks and a bit of a different slot limit apply. Fish the windward side and pay close attention to the offshore humps. Leeches on a spinner rig have worked well for us. Last year or 2 we have experimented with the ""Weapon"" from Lake Erie and it has paid off for us. Be sure to check with Wayne at Dogtooth Lake Resort when you get there, he has maps and is a great guy. If you're there early in June maybe we'll run into you. Good luck."
