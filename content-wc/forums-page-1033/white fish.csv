Need to know such things as which bait to use, the depth of the lures. We will be fishing the Sturgeon Lake area. Can you help me out?"

511501,Guest,2001-03-17 09:10:00,0,I have fished Lake Sturgeon each June the last four years. One year we caught a lot of Whites while trolling shallow for trout. Another year we caught none. They definetely school together and if you get one you can usually get a lot in the same spot. We caught them on thundersticks in about 14 feet of water between mountain island and west shore of the lake just north of Sac Bay lodge.
