But the one I was at I'd recomend for anyone and that was Wolverine Lodge. It's NW of Lynn Lake Mann. It's not real fancey but it's comfortable, good food and exealent fishing. As far as Reindeer I'd recomend one of the better known lodges on the N. half of the lake GGG could tell ya more."
511243,ggg,2001-03-10 13:51:00,115,"Just a few web sites for you to check out that I know arefantastic for big pike are:Lawrence Bay Lodge, Raindeer Lake www.lawrencebay.comNorth of 60 Camps,Obre Lake www.northofsixty.comHatchet lake Lodge Tele. 1-800-661-9183Plummer's Lodges on Great Bear and Great Slave 1-800-665-0240The options are endless.

511232,Guest,2001-02-26 18:57:00,0,Looking for fly-in trip where we could catch large northern pike. A lake with a few walleyes wouldn't hurt for shore lunch but our main objective is pike. Thanks.
511233,Pikeman,2001-02-26 19:38:00,93,"Sportsmans Lodge north of LaRonge , Saskatchewan is a great place to catch 40""+ pike. Nice cabins, little pricey.....though. Also as an alternative take a look at Confederation Lake in NW Ontario..think it is South Bay Lodge it's a boat-in location but big pike are what they are known for. Good luck!"
511235,duffy,2001-02-27 05:28:00,49,"Ronn,Look into way north camp which is a fly-in 130 miles north of the last roads in red lake ontario. I have been there five times and we always catch northerns over 40"". The walleye fishing is great but the pike fishing is what they are know for. There are five lakes to fish from the main camp and they are all catch and release since they opened them 7 or 8 years ago. Go back on this board and look for the postings on way north for more info. If I can help any more e-mail me. Good luck.duffy"
511236,Guest,2001-02-27 07:21:00,0,"I can help you find a great place for monster northerns in Saskatchewan, if you like. I live here. Many trophy lodges at great prices. E-mail me.[email protected]"
511234,River_eye,2001-02-27 13:12:00,1486,"Hey Pikeman, how come Southbay lodge is your favorite resort in one discussion, but in this discussion you aren't quite sure of the name? Have you ever been there? Or is it just your favourite place to advertise for.Sounds a bit fishyRiver eye"
511237,Guest,2001-02-28 19:39:00,0,I agree with River Eye. I've fished South Bay and there are better drive-to lodges. Do you advertise on commision or what?
511238,Guest,2001-03-04 18:07:00,0,Try SPORTSMANS LODGE on little vermilion lake.I do not work for them just fish there.
511239,ggg,2001-03-06 20:44:00,115,"The further north you go, the bigger the pike get and the more expensive the trip gets. There are many lakes in way northernOntario, Manitoba or Sas.that have huge pike. I like RaindeerLake on the border of Man. & Sas. Stayed at Lawerence Bay Lodgeand was completely spoiled. Fished with 20 guys for 3 days andcaught and released 68 fish over 40"" with the biggest weighedat 32 lbs. Not cheap but they really take good care of you !"
511240,Guest,2001-03-09 11:14:00,0,"Have to agree with GGG farther N. the better I've been to Reindeer good fishing but a little on the big side, it's humungus! Also went to Wolverine Lodge Last year and had a great trip, out of 30 people they caught over 30 Master Anglers, It's not a fly in but it's only 30 mi. from the end of the road which stops at Reindeer."
511241,Guest,2001-03-09 17:23:00,0,"ggg and Jim N,What camps did you have in mind ? If this years trip doesn't turn out to be fantastic, I'm willing to venture farther north.Steve"
