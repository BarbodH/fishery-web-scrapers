1930090,2746,2013-07-08 10:27:00,3206,"Thanks! I'll pick some up and give the kids a full demonstration. Btw, they aren't nearly as impressed with grandpa's good old days as I am."
1931753,Lazy Fisherman,2013-07-08 17:47:00,276,Just saw large burlap bags at Farm & Fleet for $1.99 per.
1926538,tuiflies,2013-07-06 21:29:00,158,Not everywhere. Some lakes in the Sioux Lookout area are the only ones I know of where there is no posession of live fish allowed. It's to prevent people from dragging fish around on a stringer all day then releasing it when they get a larger one.
1926586,Eyes_R_Us,2013-07-06 21:39:00,66,I remember the burlap bag days. As Gord said that actually worked pretty well. Bags might be hard to find but you can still buy burlap by the yard at Wallmart.
1926618,Troy Mansfield,2013-07-06 21:57:00,22,"I still have some of those burlap bags hanging in the shed, never used them."
1926874,SinOrSwim,2013-07-07 06:40:00,1528,"I was not aware of the stringer thing? Interesting. As a person who doesn't do a ton of fishing but do go to Canada every year, I'd be happy to get tips from camp owners. you could hang up a sign in the fish house???however, the fish cleaning part would be tough. But, if you happen to be in the fish house and see them cleaning, saying you have a tip for someone they probably wouldn't take offense.My group would not be happy if we had bones that is for sure. Were they Northerns? I'm not sure how anyone leaves a bone in a walleye?"
1927114,Golden Eagle,2013-07-07 08:11:00,2642,Get mine from: Lehmans.com I bleed my walleyes in the bag and then they go on ice.
1927162,3M TA3,2013-07-07 08:30:00,2846,"As a camp operator I'm kind of surprised that CampChick hasn't figured this out already so I'm guessing she's really new to this profession. Much of this line of work is all about communication with your clients and so a friendly presentation style should be second nature and will win them over no matter what the subject matter. Definitely, a thin skin won't get you far and there will always be some that think they know more than you, and some probably do. Anyway, those things that bother CampChick should be listed on her ""Educate the Dummies"" to do list and she should find ways to do just that. Coming here to WC for ideas is surely a great start."
1927346,smallcal,2013-07-07 09:31:00,119,"Many of us novices would invite the correction if handled while we were working on some fish the next night you stopped over and mentioned that you might have a better way to fillet them. Wouldn't mention bones in fish they gave you, just helpful suggestions.On the same topic, we had one camp helper show part of our group a different method for filleting fish a few years ago. The new guy last year showed us a different way, which was exactly what the first guy told us not to do. Now we're just confused with everyone doing them their own way Education would be helpful!"
1928186,campchick,2013-07-07 16:27:00,96,Thanks for the suggestions everyone. I was asked to demonstrate how to remove y bones from a northern today and casually pulled a few walleye fillets out of their bowl to show how to remove all the bones. Different group but they were pleased to be shown.
1929530,SinOrSwim,2013-07-08 08:18:00,1528,Are those the small bones in the middle that can be removed like a zipper?
1929866,Spin,2013-07-08 09:32:00,42,"I see you're in Iowa, Theisens sells burlap sacks for a couple of dollars."
1926042,2746,2013-07-06 16:05:00,3206,"Always tickles me when I see guests bring some of their fish to the camp owners/managers. I know they mean well but...... Tough call on this one as you could hurt feelings. On the other hand, if your part of our group you had better be pretty thick skinned because the guy that cleaned the fish for the night would get ribbed unmercifully if he left bones in the fillets."
1926058,Pooch,2013-07-06 16:12:00,4619,"When I see guys pull a stringer out of the water and the walleyes eyes are pure white, entire walleye has lost it's color and they are stiff (rigor mortice?) Probably been on the stringer all day in the heat.Cooler with jugs of ice is still the best. Fish drug around all day on a stringer doesn't cut it.I'm amazed at how quickly a walleye will lose it's color when dead. Why is that? You'd think the fish scales would hold color. Does the sun bleach them that quick?Pooch"
1926082,2746,2013-07-06 16:29:00,3206,Years and years ago when we used camp boats and did not have live wells nor access to ice we would lay fish in the back of the boat and cover with wet burlap.....splashing lake water on the burlap occasionally. Worked better than stringers. (Although we didn't know camp chicks fastening secret then)
1926122,v-bay gord,2013-07-06 16:50:00,3168,"Larry, I'm so retro I still use the burlap sack method (until the temps call for the cooler). Works 100 x better than a stringer. The miracle of evaporation and it's cooling affects. By the way it's getting harder to find burlap sacks. I welcome any contributions !"
1926298,2746,2013-07-06 19:14:00,3206,"Know what you mean! In addition to ""cooling fish"" we used burlap sacks, along with an ax, to crush big blocks of ice that was then used to freeze home made ice cream in a hand cranked freezer. I still have the freezer and like to get it out occasionally just to let the grand kids know how we did it in the ""old days"". The only thing missing in my demonstration for them is the burlap sack. I can't find them either!"
1926370,Glenman12,2013-07-06 20:05:00,762,don't even remember who told us to go thru both lips but have been doing it that way for umpteen years..
1926378,Glenman12,2013-07-06 20:08:00,762,"I would say something like "" thanks for the fish last night..but there were some bones in them..exactly what method do you use to fillet them?"" and then educate them on the proper way..."
1926394,Gary from Iowa,2013-07-06 20:25:00,74,A few years ago I stayed at a resort that provided burlap bags and cleaned the fish too. We just carried our catch to the fish cleaning station in a bag. I did some asking around but haven't found any locally. I found a link on the internet where you can buy some bags. http://www.onlinefabricstore.net/burlap/burlap-bags/17-27-burlap-bag-.htm?cvsfa=2700&cvsfe=2&cvsfhu=33363830&utm_source =google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Google+-+%28Product+Listing+Ads%29&utm_term=pla&utm_conten t=LrazKUMqd{device}|pcrid|24174650893|pkw|pla|pmt| e|
1926474,bus33,2013-07-06 21:07:00,289,Isn't it illegal to have a live fish that you intend to keep (in Canada)?
1926514,2746,2013-07-06 21:19:00,3206,Only on a few lakes like Lac Seul. Most will allow fish to be kept alive in a live well.
1925642,campchick,2013-07-06 12:15:00,96,"As a camp operator I have noticed that ""bush skills"" are going by the wayside. How would fishermen feel if they were gently reminded from time to time on things they might have known but have forgotten. For example: 95% of fishermen use stingers incorrectly and fish are allowed to die. Fish are strung by one lip or the stringer is fed through the mouth and out the gill. These fish will die, but if a stringer is fed through BOTH LIPS the fish will remain alive and the fisherman will have a very fresh fillet. I would not eat most of the fish I see cleaned as they have been dragged around for a long time and actually smell bad when they are filleted. What are your thoughts? To educate or not?"
1925706,camp chef,2013-07-06 12:54:00,915,Educate.Please.
1925722,lassh,2013-07-06 13:28:00,553,Educate! That's why most of come to this site. The more you wnat to share the better. Thanks.
1925746,eyeboom,2013-07-06 13:43:00,940,"Unfortunately, what we used to consider common sense is so uncommon that the term rarely applies anymore. I would highly recommend that you offer such advise in a ""politically correct"" manor as to not offend customers but actually provide a value added benefit to your camp. You might consider making up something like the attached pic. In my business, we are constantly educating our customers in a non-offensive way. It's what sets your business apart from the rest.Phil"
1925754,davis,2013-07-06 13:46:00,18,"If you suggest the fish will taste better by proper stringer method and keeping fish fresh and alive until cleaning, that should be all it takes."
1925810,chevtow,2013-07-06 14:07:00,691,"Educated me. I've never used a stringer, but if I ever have the need, I now know how to do it. Thanks ! Any other tidbits?"
1925882,Fishoil,2013-07-06 14:31:00,1277,"I say educate. You just educated me, I didn't know about hooking them through both lips. But then again I use a livewell or a cooler full of ice and not a stringer."
1925898,drlee,2013-07-06 14:37:00,409,"99% of fishermen will take your advice the right way! If you provide them with some new knowledge, they will be grateful; those who already know about what you tell them will take it as a compliment. Many will share your advice with others. For the 1%...who cares."
1925922,v-bay gord,2013-07-06 14:44:00,3168,"I would not advocate the use of a stringer. Better to suggest the use of a cooler and some frozen water bottles. The fish stay fresh, and there is no option of releasing fish off a stringer to keep a slightly bigger one. Your boat stays cleaner too (a big deal when the ankle biting flies are around)."
1925962,campchick,2013-07-06 15:10:00,96,Thank you for the replies so far. Here is another one for you to ponder. A fisherman in camp just brought over a little deep fried fish for us to taste. We thanked him and off he went. The fish fillet had been cut in such a manner that each piece still had bones. It would have been a simple thing to educate him on how to totally remove all the bones. How not to offend him?
