1871105,boelter21,2013-06-16 18:07:00,10,We were in camp the same time as Alex and it was the first week of June.
1871217,tight line,2013-06-16 18:37:00,37,Boelter21 how was the fishing for you and how was the water level.We fly in next saturday.
1871401,pikeandtina,2013-06-16 19:59:00,145,"Hey Rob, I got dinner planned for Nakina...don't forget the beverages!"
1871617,boelter21,2013-06-16 21:11:00,10,"Water level was very high. Fishing was incredible although this was my first time to Canada so only have fishing in Wisconsin to compare it too. Out boat targeted pike exclusively and did very well with both size and numbers and enough walleyes mixed in to bring our 4 fish home every night,except the day our stringer broke. Some of the others in camp targeted walleye a couple days and were getting well over 100 fish days I was told, Alex can maybe give you more info on that."
1872266,Mike Borger,2013-06-17 07:41:00,1554,"Outstanding, very nice fish! And yes, Eddie's is a special place."

1873122,pikeandtina,2013-06-17 10:33:00,145,Sounds like a plan my friend! J.
1886945,Alex,2013-06-21 15:19:00,8,"Hi Jon and Rob - sorry I didn't reply soonerJon: I was there the first week of JuneRob: The walleyes were attracted to the bait like bees to honey...I had the best luck with a purple chartreuse pearl 7cm flicker shad and jigs with white plasticsFor the northern I caught, I was using a red and white spoon with a white plastic and a 5 inch swim bait"
1938513,Alex,2013-07-10 15:02:00,8,So to all of those on this thread that were going to Eddie North's how did y'all do???
1863793,Alex,2013-06-13 13:12:00,8,"If there is only one fly-in that you could ever go to, in my opinion you would make the best choice by going to Eddie North's. Words cannot describe the amazing time that my friends and I had at Eddie North's camp on Beteau Lake. The place is truly special and had amazing fishing. My friend caught a walleye over 26 and many 40 plus northern pike were hooked; the largest was almost 48. In addition to the great fishing and atmosphere, the camaraderie between us and the other fisherman was outstanding. There also was the added perk of electricity and a shower. I do not see how anyone could go to any of Eddie North's camps and not have an absolutely AMAZING time and experience and make memories that make life worth living!!!"
