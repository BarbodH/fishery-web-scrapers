1862617,zeebee,2013-06-13 07:51:00,1144,Great eating fish if you like the taste of fish...if you don't stick to walleye as its pretty mild (flavourless). The video below outlines how to butterfly filet a laker. Definitely worth doing..http://www.brooktrout.ca/clean-butterfly-bake-trout.htm
1863521,resq91,2013-06-13 12:06:00,6,"We were just up in Ontario and had a couple days of laker fishing. Fish were definitely biting wellI believe my favorite way to cook them is grilled, skin down (NEVER take off skin.....all the flavor is there) baste with mixture of butter, lemon, Lawreys seasoning salt and a little pepper.If your Canadian lake trout are fishy tasting, you messed up with not cleaning/rinsing them.They are better than walleye any day."
1864225,DMella,2013-06-13 15:15:00,32,"In a foil enlelope place boneess skinless trout fillets with old bay seasoning, lemon slices, olive oil, s and p, and one shot of rum. Let stand 1 hour while u burn a small fire to coals. Spead coals and place envelope - closed - on top and place more coals on envelope. Depending on coals it will be med rare... what trout should be, in 15 mins. Go campers!"
1867801,Gunner_Fletch,2013-06-15 06:43:00,74,"Here's the deal.....if you don't like the ""fishy"" taste of trout, this will solve the issue: Clean and filet the laker as per norm. Cut into pieces ( cubed works well) In ziplock bag add your favourite batter mix (Cajun definitely will mostly eliminate the fishy taste). Add wet pieces of fish and shake well. Put into deep fryer until done...enjoy!"
1867953,orchard frank,2013-06-15 07:41:00,1900,"On a trip to the Northwest Territories years back, our Cree guide selected a few ""just right size"" (3-4#) for shore lunch. Let the fire burn down to coals, put a few slices of onions on the bottom of some foil, layed the filets skin-down on the onions, put a few more onions, and some salt, pepper, and a little ketchup on the top side, closed up the foil and layed it on the coals. Not long later produced a crazy-good lunch. Easily the best lake trout ever, but shore lunch on a trip like that is always hard to beat."
1929474,troutwater,2013-07-08 07:56:00,299,"We caught a lake trout and made poor man's lobster with one filet, and for the other filet we did what Bill suggested...not too bad at all!"
1929946,AllenW,2013-07-08 09:54:00,11482,"I've had it grilled with Italian seasoning on it and it wasn't to bad, grilling lets a lot of the oils drip off. I usually fillet and cut into smaller 2x3"" or so pieces and use a fryin magic and flour mixture in a pound baggie, mix milk and eggs and put in a bowl, drop fillets in egg and then in dry mixture. Mix flour and fryin magic in ratio you like, FM is a bit salty for us, so we go about 1/4 flour 3/4 FM or so. Cook in deep fryer with hot oil till done. Al"
1930026,briand,2013-07-08 10:14:00,48,"Not a fan of frying lakers, thats what walleyes are for. Any of the whole gutted fish in foil with your fav spice is always good, and easy for a shore lunch.As well we have been steaking them for the bbq, currently thats our fav way. The big key for lakers is not to over cook"
1860081,elkman99,2013-06-12 13:09:00,180,"Can some of you guys share any of your favorited ways to cook Lake Trout? We are heading up to the Manitou in 2 weeks to musky fish, but are going to try to catch a few trout for dinner. thanks"
1860121,wallydave,2013-06-12 13:26:00,2151,"This is a pretty easy and tasty way to go. Take your skinless fillets, a dry cast iron skillet, use plenty of black pepper and blackening spices, apply liberally to each side of the fillet. Cook on hot skillet 5-10 min on first side, flip over to the other side, cook until the fillet starts to flake, serve with your favorite sides and Canadian beer as needed to address the ""heat""! Happy fishing, cooking and eating!!"
1860153,camp chef,2013-06-12 13:35:00,915,soak whole gutted fish in milk for several hours.Remove from milk and stuff the fish with fresh fennel fronds and lemon slices. Salt and pepper inside and out and wrap in aluminum foil. Cook on grill or in oven until tender.
1860489,JayM5209,2013-06-12 15:13:00,1050,"x2 . . . . except I skip the milk bath and add onion slices and pats of butter along with the lemon slices. 35-40 minutes in a 350 or 360 degree oven and it's ready. The top skin will lift right off the meat. When the top meat is gone, the entire skeleton will lift off easily in one piece to make the bottom fillet accessible.Option #2 - fillet the trout, remove rib cage and skin, then cut the fillets into large serving pieces. In a mixing bowl stir together about 1 cup of orange juice (plus some grated orange rind, a Tbsp. or 2), 2 finely diced cloves of garlic, 2 or 3 Tbsp. of honey, a half cup of soy sauce. Put the trout pieces in a one gallon ziplock bag and add the marinade. Put in the refrigerator to marinade while you get the roasted potatoes about done in the oven - 30 - 45 minutes. Remove the fish from the marinade and place on a low sided cookie sheet or baking pan. Pull the potatoes from the oven and insert the fish, uncovered. Watch closely so you don't over cook the trout. It's ready as soon as the flesh flakes easily with a fork. You can also do it under the broiler, but watch it even more closely so it doesn't over cook.Enjoy!!"

1861177,Bill Krejca,2013-06-12 19:41:00,6107,"I grill the fillets on a flat piece of Pam sprayed aluminum foil. I season the fillets on the foil after also spraying, with a mixture of Hy-Vee mixed seasoning, which has sugar, salt, paprika, pepper, etc. Very good, and simple to prepare. Bill"
1862073,elkman99,2013-06-13 06:05:00,180,"Now that right there is funny. Thanks for the replies, guys, keep them coming!"
1862113,troutaholic,2013-06-13 06:19:00,827,"Walleyedave, Were the lake trout you have had from Lake Michigan? If so, you have experienced the ""greaser"" or butterball"" lake trout strain versus the canadian lake trout strain. The canadian lake trout strain is leaner than a walleye."
1862361,wallydave,2013-06-13 07:11:00,2151,"No Great Lakes trout here thank you!! Good old Ontario lake trout for me!! Thats for the tip, when I want fresh lakers I'll keep going farther North!"
