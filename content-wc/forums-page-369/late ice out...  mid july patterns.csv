Seems by then the fish are always in summer pattern on points and mid lake humps. My question is with the late ice out this year and my trip being sooner (mid july) i'm fearful my usual spots and patterns won't be as effective. What do you think."

By the time we left everything had warmed up significantly and the cabbage and was popping up like crazy. My guess is that your group won't notice any difference.Good luck!"
1901074,zeebee,2013-06-26 21:33:00,1144,Forecasts are calling for above average temps in the region for July/August so I expect patterns will be the same.

Not sure why so many big eyes still that shallow I assume because late spring? Could not hardly catch anything under 18 for lunch. 3 in the boat it was the best walleye fishing I have had in 30 years. 50 + fish over 25"" biggest was 30, they all were released. Enjoy it ,it should be good . That's some really special piece of water."
