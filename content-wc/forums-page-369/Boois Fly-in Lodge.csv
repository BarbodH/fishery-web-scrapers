1924770,NickDalasio,2013-07-06 02:03:00,34,I'm thinking of planning a trip to Booi's with my son next year. Can anyone provide me with an honest reference? Mostly interested in hearing about how the fishing was. Thanks for your help!!!
1924930,Guest,2013-07-06 07:03:00,0,Great lodge and great fishing. Owners are great. Big lake and every day a guide takes some boats out to new part of the lake which is great for first timers. Just mark your gps as you go and you are set. They prepare shore lunch as well. I love to walleye fish and that met all my expectations. Caught some lakers too which is a lot of fun.

Accommodation is of a class not typical of a flyin. The A style chalet cabins have 2nd floor decks all facing the water, leather furniture, three bedrooms and three bathrooms, dishwashers and some even have pool tables. Jim Booi is quite the character and a bit of a local legend. I can highly recommend. Bring a portable depth finder, portable downrigger (if after end of June), a GPS and the regular paraphernalia and you will have the fishing time of your life."

We have been to Trout Lake twice now and if you are a walleye fisherman you will not need a guide. We had trouble catching good eating size walleye, most were 20plus, our largest was 26, three 25s with many in the 23-24 range. I hate jigging Lake Trout in 50' plus and have not had any luck doing so, I would hire a guide for this as some guys with guides were pulling up 18-50 in a afternoon."
1927602,zeebee,2013-07-07 11:33:00,1144,"No need for a guide when chasing the lakers. We take up a portable downrigger and troll Len Thompson 5"" firetiger spoons. Ave. a laker every 10-15 min. with just one line. We simply take turns reeling the fish. The fish generally are larger when trolling a spoon compared to jigging but no question the latter technique works. Lakers are a nice break from the constant walleye action and are active all day it seems. You will be pleasantly surprised by the size of the lakers ...average was around 8 lbs. Was tough to catch eaters but we did. Both times I was up I was surprised that no one else brought a downrigger...coulda made a small fortune had I rented for cash but beer is the currency of choice amongst vacationing fishermen right?"
