1929274,dane56,2013-07-08 06:20:00,18,"I am taking my boat across the border for the first time. Is there anything one should know to make this process easier? Don't want to spend hours at the crossing getting searched. Also what are the requirements for equipment? Lastly, is the border crossing open 24/7 so one can cross very early in the morning?Thanks in advance for any help."
1929314,Pezman38,2013-07-08 06:36:00,3196,"For boating regulations you need to tell us the length of your boat and what province you are going into. In Ontario with a boat 20+ft you need flares, don't bring a pistol flare gun either.Yes, the border is open 24/7 so shouldn't be an issue."
1930386,dogrodder,2013-07-08 11:40:00,400,"Last time I checked with Border Services I was told that your boat equipment is governed by the state that it is registered in. In plain words, whatever your home state requires is what you will need when you take your boat to Canada. Be a good guest and have your rig spotless with live wells and bilge area dry when you cross the border."
1930521,packpro,2013-07-08 12:16:00,695,"Just a reminder that you are not allowed to trailer with the plug in in Minnesota. Part of their regulation governing the transportation of evasive species. Took mine across two week ago for the first time. Answer the questions, no fooling around, and declare your booze. You'll be good to go."
1931577,Woollybob,2013-07-08 16:58:00,158,I like to pull the cover off the boat before crossing. Let them see whats under there rather than wonder what might be hiding. Put it back on at the beer store in St Frances. Not sure if that theory holds water but have never been searched in 15 trips.
1931793,rnnonmt,2013-07-08 18:00:00,992,"I too crossed the border for the first time with my own boat. All the research I had done was enough to find out that I was still confused. I had with me just incase they asked was: insurance and registration for the boat & trailer. If you were to be stopped ""On the water"" you need to follow the regs for the state the boat is registered in."
1931817,1shooter,2013-07-08 18:07:00,1493,"2x times a year and I've been asked for nothing. I carry proof of insurance and registration. Also, appropriate life preservers and fire extinguisher ."
1932217,dane56,2013-07-08 19:19:00,18,"Thanks to all for your help. Have a 16' boat, going into Ontario."
