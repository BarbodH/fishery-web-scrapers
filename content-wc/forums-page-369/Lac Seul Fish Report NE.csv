1920066,tsquared,2013-07-03 13:52:00,57,"add Back from Lac Seul chamberlain narrows area fished June 15th-22nd. 7 people, 6 fisherman (hard to explain). Weather was pretty stable, some north winds, some showers, but nothing to truly change patterns. Our third year to Lac Seul, but first in June. We enjoy the multi species of Lac Seul so we fish everything (or try...)Walleye - overall pretty solid, fish were feeding. Caught fish in all areas, current, rocky shorelines, main lake areas,...pretty much everywhere. Best depth 12-13ft. Lots of fish over 20"". 4 of 6 fisherman got personal bests (2-25"" and 2-26""). Big fish hit more aggressive presentation, swimbaits, 5"" fork tail minnows, but we also fished jigs, crankbaits, some weedline on spinners.Pike - struggled to find the consistent bite, especially on size. My son did get a group best 43"" (Deep Rogue) and we caught multiple 30""+. Pike were definitely mixed in with Walleye, we occasionally targeted while jigging, etc. Small pike in cabbage, end of week located larger pike in shallow bays with downed timber. Cabbage was not at water surface and not as productive or consistent as we were used to in August.Smallmouth - they were scattered. We would target an area and maybe catch 2-3. Boulders with sand or on secondary points/cuts were best. Walleye fishing was too good to make chasing 2-3 smallmouth/per hour worth it. Did catch a 21.5"" (no photo). V-Spinners, Rapala DT-7's, Rogue, topwater - nothing stood out over the others.Musky - Caught a 48"" on a Booyah V-Spinner that managed to not break off the spinner/ring. Realized I didn't have the big net and had to hand land. We caught another 4 or so small ones. While we ""fish"" for Musky, we don't truly target for extended periods. But 2 of last 3 trips have brought in a 40"" or better.Have used Walleye Central for tips and gotten great info and PM's, so thanks again to all. 350 days to go....I have a couple photos attached. Will try and add some walleye photo's, but getting some size issues...."
1920698,rnnonmt,2013-07-03 18:08:00,992,Nice report Tim. Glad you enjoyed the NE section! IMO it is difficult to find thecabbage in June vs August because it is not on the surface in June. Side imaging will help you find it before you troll over the top of it and potentially spook the fish. Again.... Glad you had a good time! You think you are going to stay at the same place again?

Besides the 52 in musky that ""little Mike"" got they also tore up a lower end of one of the 30hp Mercs just inside of Wapesi. According to Ken the owner it was the 7th lower end so far for the season. Lol. Here is a link to little Mikes musky. He is the 3rd pic down from the top in a red t-shirt. http://www.lacseuloutposts.com/muskie2012-1.htm"
