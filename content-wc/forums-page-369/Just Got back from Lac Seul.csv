Fishing was a little slow because of hot temps and mayflys but we still had a great week with great friends. Met a new family from Minnesota and they fished with us everyday and it made the trip that much more fun. Lost Island and our guide Basil did a great job of making our stay enjoyable and we are booked up again for next year. Biggest Eye was 28 1/2"" Mike Kansas"

1932465,Mike Kansas,2013-07-08 20:22:00,1463,Most of our Walleye came off main lake humps in 15 to 20 feet. We also had some success fishing rocky points around islands in 10 to 15 feet but had to do a lot of moving to locate fish. With the mayflys gone I think all should be back to normal and spots that normally produce should do so again. Good luck and be safe . Mike Kansas
1932505,Guest,2013-07-08 20:37:00,0,"Got back from LS on Sat and fished the NW section. Fishing was slow due to the lack of wind and the mayfly hatch. Best days were Thurs/Friday when the wind finally picked up. Fished Steamboat/Mckenzie Bay, Ghost narrows and Manitoba/Stoney/Windigo point areas. Best walleye fishing was in Mckenzie bay in 6-8' of water. Did catch walleye anywhere fron 5-18' during the week. Caught most fish on spinner rigs or casting crank baits. Biggest walleye 25.5"" Biggest northern 39"" Caught a lot of slot and over and eaters were sometimes difficult to locate. Many quality northerns while pulling spinner rigs. Water temps were in the upper 60's 6/28 and when I left on Friday the temps were around 74 degrees."
