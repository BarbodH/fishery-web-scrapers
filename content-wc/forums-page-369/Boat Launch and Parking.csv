1929298,Dog,2013-07-08 06:31:00,210,I will be fishing LOTW near kenora and staying at a private cottage on an island about 10 miles out of Kenora. I am looking for any advice someone might have about where to put the boat in and leave the truck and trailer for a week that has secure parking. Thanks! Fred

1931361,aggie kolisnik,2013-07-08 15:25:00,39,The last post was my best place. I agree that northern harbour marina is the best choice. It's a pretty straight shot down to Moore bay from there.
1934105,Dog,2013-07-09 10:09:00,210,Does any one have any more suggestions? Thanks! Fred
1938441,deadhead1,2013-07-10 14:38:00,193,You are welcome to leave your truck and trailer at my place as I am close to there but I don't have a launch. Also you could try Smith Camps.
1939161,Dog,2013-07-10 18:44:00,210,"Deadhead1 Would you know if Smith Camps would let someone launch for a fee of course without staying there? What have you heard about Bare Point Marina, I noticed that a couple resorts in the area use them for there customers launching and parking. Thanks for the offer to park at your place. Thanks Again!
