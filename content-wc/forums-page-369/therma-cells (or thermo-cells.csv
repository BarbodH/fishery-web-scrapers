1935065,troutwater,2013-07-09 14:11:00,299,"I used one last week when I was on the Manitou. The thermacell worked well for mosquitoes, but its useless against black flies. I would be cleaning fish(outside) at dusk or right after and the mosquitoes left me alone. You just have to remember to let it warm up for 5-10 minutes because that's when it really gets going. For flies I got some bronco horse spray and that worked OK. Hope that helps."
1935249,jiggster,2013-07-09 15:06:00,183,I use thermacell for hunting and last week in Ontario. Works GREAT!!!!!
1935257,stevensinks,2013-07-09 15:12:00,330,"I first used one in Alaska. It worked great. I take one to Red Lake every year. It seldom happens but if the skeeters get bad I fire it up. It will cover everyone in the boat, I use coils at the cabin."

One evening while in the cabin we watched skeeters fly through the mist above the unit and they actually fell to the table dead as they hit the ""smoke"". Cleared out our cabin on many occasions as well. Had piles of dead skeeters when we came back to cabin. Do not sleep with it on though, I believe it can be toxic. Highly recommended!!!"
1935897,NY Walleye,2013-07-09 18:27:00,78,I used mine turkey hunting and fishing. Works great. As stated earlier let it warm up and go to work. I buy he replacement cartridges for sping and summer.
1936961,rsiminski,2013-07-10 07:30:00,53,I use them all of the time and they work awesome on mosquitos but they really dont seem to work on the black flies.
1937217,Jack77,2013-07-10 08:54:00,168,I have the them and they work great for mosquitoes. Not sure about blackflies but you could try this-https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...ght=coppertone
