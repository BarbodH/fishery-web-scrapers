1854138,Obabikon,2013-06-10 16:58:00,2370,"Ricorth, I prefer a 1/4 oz jig for the light feel. Also, I like smaller minnows in the range of 2"". Some people say big minnow, big fish... but I'm not sold. I've caught some MONSTER fish on nothing but a minnow head."
1854570,ricorth07,2013-06-10 19:45:00,1143,"Thank you, Obabikon...i'll give it a try...i am guilty of a larger minnow...i generally use a chartreuse or orange head, but I've read guys using just the lead color or blue or pink... any favorite color there?Sent from my SCH-R720 using Tapatalk 2"
1855225,Obabikon,2013-06-11 04:57:00,2370,"Yeah, my favorite color is pink. It's supposed to be a blood color in the water. I'm not convinced it makes a huge difference, but that's the color I jig with 95% of the time."

1872346,Shorelunch,2013-06-17 07:57:00,554,"Fished out of Morson Friday and Saturday. It was windy, but found some opportunities and timeframes for really excellent fishing. We started off on a traditional Spring spot with rip rap and sand shore and a nice point. Nobody home. So we journeyed into the islands in between Gooseneck, Harbor Island and Dawson channel. Did really well. Trolled bottom bouncers with spinners with minnows or plastics (no difference) and found active walleyes in 10 - 18 feet. Marked a bunch in deeper water (26 feet) but couldn't get them to go. Caught one 26"" and two 24"" plus a few mid-30 inch northerns and a couple of supposedly even bigger fish escaping the net. At one island near the Harbor Island area, we were catching nice sized walleyes with fresh teeth marks - including the 26 incher. Must have been big northerns or muskies in the area. Back up next weekend."

1892745,Shorelunch,2013-06-24 07:41:00,554,"Fished Saturday and Sunday out of Morson. Had fairly strong winds out of the East, but the fishing was good once again. Caught a lot of nice eater size walleyes and a few mid-20 inchers on Sunset channel points in 10 - 15 feet. Was all the further we needed to go. Trolled spinners with minnows, crawlers - and the largest eye came in on an Impulse plastic crawler. Walleyes wanted minnows when we jigged - didn't want plastics from us. Heard other good reports from those fishing humps, islands, points and reefs out towards the bigger water, too. In the afternoon, we fished for smallies with a few ""bonus"" northerns caught too. Smallies cooperated fairly well, which my two boys love. Back up over the 4th of July week."
1914594,Obabikon,2013-07-02 05:31:00,2370,"Fishing has been VERY good this June. The only species we haven't caught regularly is the big musky. I believe they're a little sluggish due to the cooler water temps. Temps on the big lake are running around 70-74 degrees. Obabikon Lake is 74-76 Walleyes have been on humps all over the place. The mayflies are starting to hatch, but I doubt we have a huge boom of them this year (due to the cold spring). But, I could be wrong. When we had storms last week, the fishing slowed for a day or so, and now it's right back to normal. We had been catching crappies off the dock non stop. The thunderstorms spooked them out, but hopefully this stable weather pattern will bring them back in. Northern and smallmouth are both hitting along the shorelines... LIFE is good... big thanks to Scott for coming up to stay, and for starting this great website!"
1930042,Shorelunch,2013-07-08 10:16:00,554,"Went up to Morson Wed - Sunday. Weather was very windy and a ""mix of sun and cloud"" with more clouds than sun for the most part. Also received some rain, too. In general we fished walleyes in the morning and small mouth in the afternoon. We tried to stay somewhat out of the brunt of the wind and found walleyes on humps and reefs about every where we stopped. However, usually the next day, they moved from the spots we fished the previous day, so we moved to find them. We had best luck trolling spinners with minnows, with most fish caught in 10 - 17 feet. They didn't seem to want crawlers as much as minnows. Larger walleyes were gorging on mayflies and crayfish, but it really didn't slow down the bite. Am also gradually learning to fish smallies. We caught them on rip rap shorelines with boulders using a variety of lures."
1793786,Obabikon,2013-05-21 10:28:00,2370,"Well, as most people know the ice is gone, and Lake of the Woods is humming right along. 3 days of fishing... (or for many people 1 day). Saturday supposedly had a decent bite. Lots of action around Rabbit Island. I think the walleyes are starting to move up to spawn, but many people were still fishing deep. The past two days have had winds from 20-30 MPH out of the NE. Not fun at all. Horrible weather, but it feels good to be back on the island! More reports to come, when there's more to report! Weather sounds like it's breaking up tomorrow."
1808754,Obabikon,2013-05-26 10:01:00,2370,"My first day guiding was yesterday. We did well. No monsters, but we limited out on 16-18"" walleyes. All of them were caught in 2-6 feet of water tossing a jig and minnow towards the bank. We then went Northern fishing, and between the 6 of us must've caught and realeased close to 100 in the afternoon. Other guests and guides caught bigger walleyes in 20+ feet of water. Half a dozen over 25's were caught out of the camp yesterday... just none in my boats"
1811586,1shooter,2013-05-27 16:41:00,1493,How's Willie doing. See you in 3 weeks.
1812714,Obabikon,2013-05-28 04:33:00,2370,"He's doing great! Pumped to be on the island! A couple 29.5"" Walleyes were caught yesterday! One of the guys who caught one, then followed that up by his brother puting a hook in the side of his head. But, Dr. Jared got it out!"
1838473,Obabikon,2013-06-05 05:39:00,2370,"Fishing has been absolutely awesome the past few days! Catching beautiful eyes in 8-22 feet of water. A lot of shore line fishing. Of course just a jig and a minnow. Most guests are coming back with big smiles on their faces, saying they couldn't count how many 16-18"" fish they caught. There have not been a TON of 26"" + fish caught, but 20-23 everyone seems to be catching at least one a day right now. Must be just one of those weeks to be fishing! On a side note, I was blessed with an emergency appendectomy last week. I'm pretty much fully recovered, and can highly recommend Bemiji, MN medical team! Had me in and out of the hospital in just a few hours. Everyone be safe, and keep your lines tight!"
1839081,Shorelunch,2013-06-05 08:15:00,554,Thanks for the report. Glad you had success here in BJI! Looking forward to fishing success in Morson this weekend. Thinking about trying Sandy Bay for the first time on Friday.
1850897,Obabikon,2013-06-09 16:42:00,2370,"Been a crazy week! Fishing has been just flat out awesome the past few days. Lots of big eyes. They're starting to move to humps, but still on shore lines too. Probably the best stretch of weather I've seen in several years. Eight straight days of 70 degrees, very little wind, and no rain. Water temp is coming up, and the crappies have moved into the dock (meaning they'll be spawning relatively soon)."
1852482,F250,2013-06-10 07:52:00,75,Obabikon - I wish you a speedy recovery. Don't be lifting any outboard motors for a few weeks !!
1853522,Shorelunch,2013-06-10 12:46:00,554,"Had an excellent weekend of walleye and smallie fishing out of Morson. Caught our walleyes along rip rap and points in 10-17 feet depending on wind. We trolled spinners or jigged. Nothing huge, but tons of nice eaters and some low 20 inchers."
1853898,ricorth07,2013-06-10 15:14:00,1143,"when you guys are jig and minnow fishing, what is roughly the size of the minnow and weight and color of the jighead? thank you in advance! I fish in a rocky River, so it is tough.. and when I use a three way with a floating jig, I'm getting a lot of catfishSent from my SCH-R720 using Tapatalk 2"
