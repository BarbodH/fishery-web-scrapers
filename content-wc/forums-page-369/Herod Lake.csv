Walleye numbers and average size were solid but not many over 22"". Had one of those days you (almost) get tired of catching fish at the portage lake. We did not pursue Northern's and picked up very few jig fishing.Cabin had a serious mouse problem, but I see it has since been replaced. Portage boats were rough(even for portage boats) and no motors. If I remember correctly flight to lake is 2+ hours. A long time on a float plane.We also fished Kay Lake with this outfitter. Overall I would put them in about the middle of the pack of outfitters we have used in NW Ontario."

1934945,KSjim,2013-07-09 13:27:00,88,"Mike,Yes, I am in the KC Metro area. I had the pleasure of talking to you on the phone a couple of years back after purchasing some of your excellent fishing lures. Wish I could sneak up to Canada as often as you do.Also, the Walleye song is a must play beginning about the first of May each year. For some reason by early June the people in my office seem very happy to see me heading north.Jim"
