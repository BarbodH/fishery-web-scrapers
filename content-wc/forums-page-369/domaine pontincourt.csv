Some of the best walleye fishing I have had anywhere. These are Canadian Shield walleyes - lots of 15"" - 20 "" fish. Good boats, motors, clean cabins, and exclusive fishing rights on the water. Our wives love this place !"

Natives will have camps set up about half way in shortly, for blueberry harvesting. You can buy some there or stop and pick your own along the way. Worm harness with bottom bouncers, and 1/4 oz. jigs with 3"" twister tails (yellow, pink, or orange tails with brown body), work well. The camp owners harvest ice in the winter which is stored in the ice house. You can take what you need all week. Andre is the owner, but son Eric runs the place. 24 days 'til we leave ..."

There was a group of 10 there that had been going for 20 years. They just anchored and jigged their spots all week and did well, mostly early and late. One cloudy. showery day all 5 of their boats caught dozens of fish each as they were out feeding and they knew all the spots. We dragged spinner rigs and night crawlers all over the 12-20 ft. range. Morning and evening and during cloudy times all day long were good and we and caught about 250 walleye or so for the 2 of us. One storm front we were out in and caught them up to 27"" one after the other. It was crazy. It was also good in the evening at the island in front of the camp, we probably averaged about 30 walleye each evening we tried it, in 12 -14 ft. of water. It was relaxing, few snags, and we got some about 25"" in there, but mostly 13""-18"" were the norm. Not too many pike in there for us, maybe caught around ten? Didn't find any weeds to fish in but I did get one at 43"" on the spinner rig. There's a lot of narrow channels and bays to the right of the camp as you go out with structure that is easy to find with trolling and narrow spots with current. Makes it easy to keep fishing the productive spots, while the other guys in camp fished mostly out in the middle of the lake on spots we never really were able to produce on. That kept us out of each others hair for the week and we shared spots without fear of them being poached the next day we went out to try them. We actually spent a fair amount of time prospecting for new spots on bright sunny days, especially once we had picked up the pattern and producing spots. It's tough if you don't know the lake and weather is too nice. Then you have to be out there real early and in the evening, and you still can do fairly well."
