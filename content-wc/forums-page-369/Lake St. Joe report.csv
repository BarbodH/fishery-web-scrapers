We had 2 1/2 days of strong winds and had to use the cabin generator 3 times because of cloudy/rainy days. But the fishing was great as always! We didn't get any big fish this year, but the numbers were good. Largest were 26"" walleye and 37"" northern. Our daily contest had a 35"" minimum for northerns with 36"" & 37"" winners. Our walleye minimum was 22"" with daily winners of 22.25, 23.25, 23.5, 24, 24.5 and 26"". On the tough fishing windy days we caught 25-30 fish each, with 55-65 each on the better days. 6 of us got 1 sucker, 3 whitefish, maybe 150 northern and 1400 walleyes. Thanks to some other Walleye Central St. Joe fisherman, we tried some new spots this year. Both Beer Can Island and Nebraska Reef were new to us this year and fishing was very good in both spots. We used all plastic, no live bait, and fished mainly 3/8 jigs everywhere from 4'-24'. Color didn't matter, they bit everything. If you didn't get anything in 10 minutes it was time to move. Then we'd move to a spot where we were getting fish on every cast or dropping the line directly below the boat and getting fish before the jig hit the bottom. I'll be sharing some new spots with the W/C guys I talked with before the trip. If anyone else is heading to St. Joe, send me a PM and we'll talk fishing spots. We saw deer, bears, moose, pelicans, loons, and eagles on this trip. One evening, while sitting on the deck, we watched a moose directly across from us, swim from one island to another. All in all it was a great trip. I only hesitate slightly because my boat broke down on the first day, but that's another story. Even with that it was a great trip. Only 51 weeks until next year's trip!"
