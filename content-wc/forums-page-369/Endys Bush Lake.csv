1920242,bluefin85,2013-07-03 15:10:00,31,Anyone ever fish Endys Bush Lake or Paint Lake by the town of Beardmore. Sounds like it's a good area to fish. Thanks
1920282,eyemike,2013-07-03 15:30:00,233,"Spent over 20 years fishing out of Endys. I do not know the present owners or how they run their operation. I heard that they do not have boats on Onaman Lake anymore, which in my opinion is a must go to lake, full of big walleye and pike, so that alone would make me choose a different outfitter. I do not know that for a fact though. The area is fabulous for walleye, and pike, lakers and brook trout. I have posted about this area in the past. Look under my posts. Lots of smaller lakes. It is an area that you will drive from lake to lake. Endys does have access to a river system on Paint Lake but after about July it is difficult to access about half of it because of low water. Very good fishing in June though or when the water is up. Some outfitters in the area have boats on Ohaman, those are the places that I would be looking to stay. They also have caches of boats on the surrounding lakes for use which makes it real handy."

1921594,revitup,2013-07-04 06:54:00,140,We went there several years as well. Lake system that Bush is on is mainly pike. Beatty is a beautiful lake with Lakers also. Onaman was the highlight for us. We would go there 2 days during the week. Paint had some walleye. We eventually would do mainly day trips. Got old putting boats in and out of water each day. Can't beat Onaman.
1922162,bluefin85,2013-07-04 11:57:00,31,How far away is Onaman Lake from Bush Lake. Can you get to Betty from Bush Lake. Thanks
1922794,revitup,2013-07-04 21:18:00,140,"Seemed like onaman was 1-1&1/2 hr drive, then 1-1&1/2 mi walk. Go light with gear. All you need is jigs tipped with minnows. Pole,life jacket, gas for boats, and rain gear. We would take one extra rod and reel for whole group. Drinks and sandwiches. Yes, Beatty can be reached from bush. Its been a long time, but I think its bush, then Ida, then fox ear, and then Beatty. Cannot usually get anything bigger than camp boat thru those creeks that connect them. Especially bush to Ida. We did it for the adventure. Could pick up pike in all. We never fished for the lakers"

Onaman lake is amazing!! I caught an absurd amount of walleye while staying at Pasha Lake 2 weeks ago. Avg size walleye on Onaman for us was a fat 21"". We fished Onaman twice the week that we stayed. It's a 45 min drive and a 25 min walk though the woods on a trail."
