Berkley power grubs in pumpkin seed. Trigger x in the brown paddle tail 4 inch. We fished anywhere from 6-20 feet of water, based on wind and sunlight / overcast conditions. My dad got a 26 and 27 inch walleye as well. We found crappie in miles bay as well. Lots of smallmouth and big northern too. Lost a nice musky on horse shoe island on the reefs on a figure 8 with a crankbait, fish hit it, then did an arial jump level with my head and threw the crankbait into my hat. It was awesome. Once again it was very nice staying at J-rods island , the accomadations were great and the weather cooperated as well."
