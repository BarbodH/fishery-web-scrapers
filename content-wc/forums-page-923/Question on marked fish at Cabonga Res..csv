We marked these large schools at various places at between 30 and 40 feet. When I asked the outfitter what they were (we tried everything in our tackle box to catch some with no success) he said they were probably perch. I marked perch before but these were much larger arcs than perch. Someone else said they might be whitefish although no one present had ever caught any. Does anybody know?
524218,Guest,2002-09-12 14:52:00,0,"Very probably were whitefish. If perch, they would have hit some of your walleye stuff. And the walleye have been hitting pretty well recently so you should have caught some of them even if they were slow to bite. I've marked large schools in that range before and nothing will bite. I, too, was told that they were probably whitefish."

Also they will hit like a walleye except they have a very small mouth which means they can't get a hold of a large crankbait. But if you used small spinners, jigs tipped with crawlers or minnows you should get some hits as they are agressive, we catch them occasionally on walleye spinners and small minnows in the spring before they go down. If you were not seeing perch then perhaps suckers or some other species that aren't interested. I had a similar experiance a few years back. I dropped a jig down 40 ft. and pulled it backup slowly, the arcs followed it up. Finally at the top I could see a whole pool of perch, they followed but never hit the jig."
