524248,Pooch,2002-09-12 20:14:00,4619,I just finished waiting almost an hour for an email to down load which really chaps me. Then it turns out to be from Way North Lodge. The email is photos of fish from thier camp. THIS IS BS TO HAVE SOME CHUMP USE MY EMAIL FROM THIS SITE TO SEND ME THIER CRAP. Wise up dummies. This site is not for you so leave and quit mining for emails here.Pooch
524249,sdyer,2002-09-13 06:33:00,34,"pooch,I sent you the e-mail because you and I have been exchanging e-mails in the past about way north and the places you have been to and thought you might like to see the pictures. You asked me not to send any more pictures again so I won't. I did not get your e-mail address from this web site, I got it from you. I would never do that because I feel unless you pay for advertising on this site you should not advertise on it unless some one asks for information. I can see how you thought it was spam since I have recently changed my e-mail address from [email protected] to an address that includes waynorth in the e-mail address. As I said in my e-mail to you I was sorry for any convienance and that I would not send you anything else. Take good care. Sean"
