524143,Guest,2002-09-10 04:13:00,0,"Both Pine Falls and Selkirk have their pros & cons. You can catch quality fish in both locations. Pine Falls is by far easier on the eye with scenic suroundings and a chance to get away from the crowd. The traffic at PF has increased sicnificatly over the past few years but you can just keep going North as long as your nerves allow you to go out to big, big water. The downside to PF is if the wind blows from the North or NW you're out of luck.On the Red you can fish in any weather and run in to town for a lunch break. The Red gets extremly crowded and sometime you feel like your fishing in downtown Selkirk. My solution? Fish PF when the wind is down and the Red when she blows it's about a hour drive between them.Good Luck"

One of the reports claimed that when the bait fish population is high the fishing is great....I hope they are correct. If this is true both places should be Hog Heaven this year. I also heard that BARNEY is fishing the Red this year. Since BARNEY is the ""ILLINOIS WALLEYE GOD"" guys should probably go to Pine Falls cause BARNEY will have the Walleye on the Red all cornered."
524145,Guest,2002-09-10 19:22:00,0,"I agree with done both, the distance is not that far between the two and both offer that 10++ opportunity. Play your options with the weather and try to do both while you are up there."
524146,ptdiver,2002-09-10 19:35:00,9,"Pine Falls has way more structure depending on what style of fishing you like best... If they are not hitting on crank baits in Selkirk be prepared to sit on a anchor all day. Mud bottom/very stained leave your live bait at home shinners are the only thing that worked for me. As for Pine Falls live bait and shinners work, lots of structure, water is much more clear. If they are hitting on crank baits hold on you never know when its the big one. yeee haaaAs for fish size there are big fish in both places, your chances of catching fish 8+ are very good."
524147,Guest,2002-09-11 19:36:00,0,"thanks for your input, I appreciate it. Our largest at Red River in Selkirk last year was 10.8 pounds pulling cranks. Did lots of verticle jigging the first day and switch to cranks the next two days and did much better. We have rooms reserved for the Red on Oct 2,3,4. Everyone said things were very slow on the average compared to years past. We had only two quality fish and then lots of small saugers and walleye."
