We caught many many in the mid to upper 30"" range and 3 of us only fished for one afternoon! Had one in the mid to high 20# range inhale my spoon right at the boat and yanked it right out of her mouth! We just tossed big Johnson silver minnows. Silver and Firetiger colors worked best. Any weedless spoon will work in those colors. No hang ups and you can throw right into the slop. We had many fish come right out of 2-3' of water and chase to the boat. haven't had my heart pumping like that for a long time. Had to actually sit down for a minute once just to gain my composure......Hope you hammer em' Sure wish I was you!"
