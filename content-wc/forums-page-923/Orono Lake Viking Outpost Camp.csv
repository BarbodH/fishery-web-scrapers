524168,Guest,2002-09-10 08:33:00,0,I have a group of eight looking for a place for next year and have been looking at Orono Lake. Orono is one of Viking Outposts lakes. Just wondering if anyone out there has been there and how the fishing was.

Fishing was slow for the first few days, but then picked up through the rest of the week. Fished mainly for walleye. Did not fish any of the portage lakes, although we did check them out. All were equiped with a good boat and motor. Nice large cabin, good appliances, good boats and motors. Checked on us every other day and brought us ice. For more info email me at [email protected]"
