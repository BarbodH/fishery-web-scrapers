The cabins are nice, the VIP cabins are real nice, particularly given the remoteness of the location. Walleye fishing and Pike fishing is very good as is the Muskie fishing. It's a good ride in, about an hour or so depending on your boat but once there you are in some good water. See the above post on Chamberlin Narrows for some current fishing tips. You do have the chance of a real big Pike or Muskie in this area as some real trophy fish have been caught out of this camp in the past.Paul"
