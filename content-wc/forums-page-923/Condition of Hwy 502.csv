Other areas are rough, all the way to fresh asphalt in spots. They seem to work on streaches about 20 miles long at a time. I did see people working on Sunday, they must be trying to finish that part of the road before winter."

Yes,I was guilty,but hadn't had a ticket in 30 yrs, was agreeable and kept my tounge. Yes he was very ..... well down south we call it ""Redneck"". By the time he got done telling me what a dumb *ss american I was and the $100 ticket I decided that road isn't worth it."

I got pulled over in Fort Frances 2 years ago for apparently running a red light (it was yellow, turning red). He pulled me over, said I ran the light, which I kinda did. Asked me where I was going, I said Eagle Lake, he looked around and said ""Good luck, drive carefully."" Also, don't forget to turn off and remove those radar detectors. My brother learned that one the hard way."
