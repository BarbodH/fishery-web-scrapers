524067,Trailerguy,2002-09-09 06:41:00,1407,"Gold Arrow camp at Perrault Falls, Ont. is topnotch. Boats on 12 smaller lakes you can drive to from camp, it's never too windy to go out. Great fishing and spotless cabins, freindly people with current hotspots and dependable equipment. I went there for over 25 years before I bought my own cottage. www.fishandhuntontario.com they book up early, due to a high rate of return customers."
524068,AL,2002-09-09 07:03:00,89,I have been to several lodges in Canda...and the best I've found by far is Mattice Lake Outfitters. www.walleye.on.ca. I rate every catagory an A+. My party immediately rebooked when we returned to the base camp this year.

524056,Guest,2002-09-05 07:53:00,0,"Went to Rainbow Point Lodge at Perrault Lake in July. Four dads took 6 teenage boys. Everyone at the logde was very helpful and treated the boys great, equipment was good, and the cabins nice and clean. It was really hot when we were there so the fishing during the day was slow but early morning and evening were good. Hope to go back next year."
524057,Guest,2002-09-05 09:53:00,0,"Been going to Anderson's Lodge in Sioux Lookout for many years. Always go to one of their outpost. Topnotch!! They have camp managers who check on the outpost every other day and will bring in supplies as needed. Minnows, groceries, etc. Would highly recommend them. However, I've never fished out of the lodge itself. Can't imagine it being any different.For camping; I go every year for opener to Abrams Lake Park just south of Frog Rapids. RV rates are reasonable and they are great folks. Alan and Paula seem to care about their customers. Will be going back to both places come May 2003, Lord willing. It's tough spending two straight weeks amongst all that good fishing.Eyesnatcher"
524058,Guest,2002-09-05 12:56:00,0,Nestor Falls outposts been great everytime!! The best part is its only an hour drive from fort frances we used to drive to pickle lake man what a difference!!
524059,Guest,2002-09-05 18:03:00,0,I have been fishing Gullrock lake near red lake for four years now. If you want quality walleye fishing with the opportunity to catch bigger fish check out www.fivelakeslodge.com the owner is Bud Murray. A great host and a quality camp. It is a housekeeping plan and our group of 10 every year do it for a very reasonable price. Our total cost per guy including everything is between $550-$600 depending on how much beer we drink. That is from saturday to saturday. Jeff Jasinski
524060,Guest,2002-09-05 19:55:00,0,"Checked out Red Indian Lodge this August. Walleye fishing just happend to be on fire, which was good, but really liked the lodge.The cabins are nice, as they are remodeling the cabins, also adding air conditioning to all cabins next year. Food was decent. But what I feel really sets this place apart is what a great place to bring kids for a family vacation. Minigolf, tennis, basketball, bikes, beaches w/ paddleboats and canoes, and an indoor rec center with pool, darts and foosball. My kid had a ball up there. If you bring your own boat, the prices are actually pretty reasonable. I liked the up front cost for the gas/bait/docking package for your boat. You can use all the gas and bait you like. Everything was straight up, no surprise costs to deal with at the end of the trip except for the bartab. My wife liked not having to cook all week and the daily maid service.Upon the helpful advice of a few others, I did check out some of the other places. If I were to go housekeeping, Tomahawk looked like the place to be. Really nice looking cabins, probably some of the best looking cabins I seen. Totem looked nice also, as it should for the big bucks they charge. Motlongs seemed like a pretty friendly place while I was there.But, all in all, for the total package, I was happy with the value of Red Indian Lodge. Take the family there, and your wife and kids will love it."
