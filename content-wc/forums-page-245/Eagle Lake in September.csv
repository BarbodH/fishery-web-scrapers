4488370,Doorcountyguy,2016-01-26 15:19:00,2,Taking my son on his first Canada trip this September to eagle lake. It's my first time fishing eagle and was hoping I could get some help. We're staying at cedar point lodge with it being a half walleye half muskie trip. Any advice on spots and patterns would be greatly appreciated.

I had one grab my 17"" walleye and drug it to the surface before it let go. One of the guests went out to try and catch it and said it was a 50+. To me it was just a big Muskie not to interested in catching Found walleye around boat island on south side, portage bay, diamond island and by Viking reef. Muskie portage bay around the islands and the back channel of boat island It's a big lake and easy to get lost get a hotspot map"

Here's two good ones I would recommend. www.eagleeyeguiding.com and www.calritchie.com Not to say you can't do it on your own but a bit of help on the water is a good investment. September fishing can be excellent.
