We will be there beginning August 6th for a week and not sure what to expect. From what I've read they have a good camp. I wanted to try Lac Seul but they didn't want to go that far but maybe next year. We also usually go in June or July when we go north but it was last minute plans and it's reasonably priced, I have other trips planned for the summer atleast wanted to go up to atleast once. Maybe June for next year, love top water smallmouth. Anyways does anyone have any advice on maps, locations, baits etc. Thanks"
4499178,ftfarms,2016-01-30 08:30:00,444,Well you missed us by a week. We will be there the following week. This has become one of my favorite places to fish. I like walleye fishing in little traverse bay but there's good fishing in milesbay also. I got two maps. Can't think of the name of one but the other one is fishing hot spots map. It very helpful. I also have a chip in my hds9 of the lake that's the best way to go. As far as smallmouths as always in canada white spinner bait single chrome spinner. Bandit crank baits. I like blue chartreuse or purple chartreuse leech on a jig torpedos on calmer days work well. Try around the inlet of the bay to thompson creek but be careful there's a few rock piles around there but you know that's what your looking for. Around horseshoe island can be awsome for smallies. Walleyes I like pulling spinners. On LOW the colors are pink or gold. I like pink the best. On sunny days it's hard to beat gold. My third color would be rainbow. Hope this helps. Matt and Jenn are good people. Go to camp fish fry that's always good.

It shows most of the unmarked reefs, etc. I also have the Hotspots map, which is interesting, with some spot features marked. When I have traveled in this area, however, 6214 is my Bible, the one I use. A number of map retailers follows: https://www.google.com/webhp?tab=ww&...c+service+6214 Have fun, it is a good area to fish, the potential number of different species available for catching is high. Bill"
4503481,ftfarms,2016-01-31 19:44:00,444,That is the other map we use. 6214 and 6215 government map. Great for navigating the lake.

That would save you a lot of time in finding spots to fish plus getting back to camp without getting lost. I fished mainly for walleyes and if you do, don't overlook shallow rock humps and sunken islands. I know people think walleyes go a lot deeper in summer but you would be surprised on very good walleye fishing on those humps and good quality fish. A simple jig and crawler or leech was good for us at that time of the year."
