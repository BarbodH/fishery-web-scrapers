4465009,fsz,2016-01-18 19:01:00,144,There seems to be impending mining in the area of Marshall lake. Would the MNR really approve this so close to several nice lakes? If allowed I would think it would pollute the water. Anyone have any info as to if this project is actually moving forward?
4465233,adempsey,2016-01-18 20:03:00,963,"You have any links?The only thing I found was for a company called White Tiger Mining, and they've only explored the area. There website has not had any news since 2013. Looks like they changed the company name to Copper Lake Resources. I think these mining companies come and go all the time."
4465369,123chadder,2016-01-18 20:55:00,429,from what i hear mining laws are quite strict
4465745,fsz,2016-01-19 05:39:00,144,"Don't have any links other than the ""White Tiger"" one you prolly saw. I did recall seeing the company was authorizing $1,000,000 for R and D. In my mind, after spending that kind of money if the minerals are there it will be mined. I would expect the mining laws to be strict, but the target location for this project is right next to the lake. As such, I would expect the project wouldn't be able to go forward if the laws were indeed ""strict"". Hope this company does come and go like the others!"
4465985,adempsey,2016-01-19 07:42:00,963,"It's not strict at all and the government has been pathetic at making sure the environment is protected.http://www.ontarionature.org/discove...ntario-web.pdfThe only reason our province hasn't been destroyed is because of the cost involved. There are endless claims to many different resources across the province, but I don't think most are worth trying to acquire yet. Thankfully, because profit and greed will always trump social responsibility. The two recent tailing pond disasters (one in BC and the other in Brazil) are perfect examples of it.We all should be concerned. I hope they fail to move forward."
4466162,Bill Krejca,2016-01-19 08:16:00,6107,"Not familiar with Marshall Lake, however, it seems that industry gets first choice when competing with wilderness integrity. Each slice taken out of the wild further reduces a relatively non replaceable resource. One not need look very far for pollution excesses - mercury, clearcutting to lake shore, air and water pollution from factories, etc, are common in the north country. A counter to the above, of course, is added employment in a country vastly needing jobs for it's people. Too bad better compromises couldn't be made to respond to both important issues. Bill"
4466914,oleJoe,2016-01-19 11:24:00,114,It looks like they are going to open a gold mine at Geraldton. There is a old one there but the new one is going to be an open pit one. Which will take some housing and the golf course. Its called progress.... I guess. Enjoy while you can.
4471474,fsz,2016-01-20 18:26:00,144,"Very scarry link on Ontario mining. It says only 1 in-10,000 claims ever get mined. So maybe there is hope. I'm aware of some hypersensative positions of the MNR, including development near snake habitat and land turtles. Can't believe something as detrimental as mining adjacent to waterways is allowed by the MNR. Hope they exercise the same degree of vigalance on the mining companies as they do on outdoorsman. Actually, a higher degree of vigalance would seem to be in order due to the environmental impacts."
4480858,youngknight,2016-01-24 06:05:00,228,"I have a bit of experience with this. There are a ton of rules and regulations when it comes to forestry in Ontario. Mining has almost free reign. It isn't mnrf, but rather the power given to mining companies in existing legislation. I know of cases where mnrf tried to stop or control mining development but law was in mining company's favor."
