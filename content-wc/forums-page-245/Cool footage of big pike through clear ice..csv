Really wanted to get his kid into some fish, but the fish God's were not with us today. The leave your brake engaged on your skidoo and nearly set it on fire god's were smiling on us today thoughAnyway, I had plenty of whitefish and a good number of trout come screaming up only not to take the bait, tried loads of different presentations but could get none to commit, none except a nice fat Pike that took a 5"" live dace minnow set at 20'FOW in 38'FOW.Was really cool to watch it coming up through the clear ice inside the hutâ€¦..released it and she swam away to fight another day.VIDEOhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIEkkGeBlbc"
