4497186,Slab Seeker,2016-01-29 10:55:00,14,Was wondering if anyone had any experience at Kay Lake and the Derby Lake portage thru Nestor Falls Fly In. A long time ago my dad and I went but don't think we had the correct technique for the smallmouths. Trying to plan my son's first trip and thought it would be nice to go to someplace his grandpa had gone. I am pretty confident the accommodations will be good as I think Dave and Michelle run a good operation. What species are present in Derby? Probably going in June but some flexibility.

Should be a great trip at that time of year you are looking at going. As for myself I like going in August to Kay and do a walleye trip in the spring with my friends to Herod this year. Dave and his son Jon are really good at helping you maximise your trip and the rest of the staff are just top notch, I was just at the ice show in St. Paul and saw Jon and there chief pilot and can wait to go!!"
