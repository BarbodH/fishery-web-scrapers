4499722,stjoeguy,2016-01-30 12:46:00,979,"The instruction used to ask for original receipts. The original receipt was then returned with the refund. The GST 115 instructions now just ask for copies and point out that receipts submitted with the refund application will not be returned. It looks like I must have submitted the original last year because all I have in the file is a copy. Oh, well. The letter accompanying the 2013 refund specifically mentions returning original documentation, but that sentence isn't on the 2014 & 2015 letters."
4501257,oleJoe,2016-01-31 07:24:00,114,I received my rebate check only. I just checked on the rebate form (gst115e (14) ) and it says you must remit copies and they will not be returned. Thats on page 2 under general information. It also says to keep copies for your records.
