Drive past the bus company and the first stop sign will be Cormier Rd. Continue north to the next one which is Hazelwood Drive and turn right. Head straight east, pass under the freeway and Cabela's will be the first building on your right. Just drive up to the stoplight and turn right, piece of cake."

4477242,BornToFish,2016-01-22 13:02:00,1224,"I attended the All Canada Show in Green Bay last night. I thought the show last year was very good. This year's show was even better. It was readily apparent that the show had positive energy flowing! The people that are behind the show know what they are doing and are committed to the show's success. About all I can say is ""job well done""!"
4483314,WalleyeMatt,2016-01-24 19:01:00,93,We went on Saturday and enjoyed it very much. Spent a little more money than we planned to and it wasn't on drinking and gambling. I will plan to go next year if they have it. Matt
4457553,WalleyeMatt,2016-01-16 15:24:00,93,"I'm planning to go to this, first time, anyone have any comments on it. What to expect and or what to see. Thank You, Matt"
4459041,BornToFish,2016-01-17 06:29:00,1224,"I attended the Green Bay All Canada Show for about fifteen years. I noticed about five years ago the attendance at the show was becoming sparse, both for the exhibitors and the public attending the show. It sort of seemed as though the show was shriveling up. I'm hot sure what the cause was, but the show just lacked energy and was in a death spiral. There were fewer exhibitors, which meant there were fewer people attending the show the next year, which meant there were fewer exhibitors the following year. The show was out of business two years ago. Some new people bought the show a year ago and injected a LOT of positive energy into the show. The new venue helped quite a bit. The number of exhibitors seemed to be up by a fair bit. Free parking was a definite plus for the public attending the show. I thought the show was very good in 2015. I will be there to check it out later this week."
4459273,Obabikon,2016-01-17 07:35:00,2370,"My only comment would be... don't trust the casino, they'll take your money away! LOL The show will have 3-4 isles of exhibitors (65 or so). Plus they'll have an expensive bar and some Thorne Bros. tackle is usually set up to look at. There are worse ways to spend your money, but don't forget, you can buy them from the website cheaply! (I think it's $6 instead of $10.http://www.allcanada.com/ticket-purchase/"
4459745,WalleyeMatt,2016-01-17 09:09:00,93,"Thanks for the advice, I don't drink and I don't gamble so I should be safe. Boy I must be a real boring person. Anyway I would rather spend my money and free time fishing. Looking forward to it and just getting away for the weekend it's -10 degrees now and don't want to leave the house. Any other advise would be welcome. Matt"
4459761,Stringbean,2016-01-17 09:14:00,279,I managed to take in the show last year at their new venue. I was about to buy a ticket across the counter when the clerk asked if I qualify as a senior citizen. I reminded him that I rode the ark with Noah. Enough said.
4459953,Fishoil,2016-01-17 10:27:00,1277,"I attended last years show for the first time in 15-20 years. It wasn't near as big as the last one I was at when the show was held at the arena, but I still enjoyed it immensely and am planning on attending this year again. I spent a lot of time talking with various camps and sharing stories, wasn't really looking for a new place to go. This year will be a little different for me as I'm looking for a camp to try out for an additional trip. It'll probably be for next year since I have two planned for this year already. My wife and I do have a week off of work in July with no concrete plans yet, so who knows...??"

4461577,michigan walleye guy,2016-01-17 20:09:00,95,What are the dates for the show? Is it close to the new Cabela's store in Green Bay?
4461585,BornToFish,2016-01-17 20:13:00,1224,The dates are this week Thursday through Sunday. The show is at the casino across the road from the airport. It's a few miles south of Cabela's.
