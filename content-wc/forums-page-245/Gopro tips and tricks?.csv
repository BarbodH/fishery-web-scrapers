I thought I had it on in the boat last summer and ended up getting one stupid still shot of my big fish in the net but you can barely see it. The whole time I thought I was rolling I wasn't. I think I tried to turn the camera on but it was already on so it changed it from video to still shot. So, when I hit the front button to video it just snapped a pic."
4466129,Pezman38,2016-01-19 08:07:00,3196,The easiest way is to turn the volume on and when in video mode it will beep 4-5 times letting you know it is recording. When a picture is taken it beeps once so you know immediately what mode you are in.
4467034,Limeyangler,2016-01-19 11:49:00,563,"get the Smart Remote and strap it to your wrist like a watch, when the camera is rolling the red light on the remote will be flashing and you can also see on the display what mode your in, and you can operate the camera from your wrist instead of fumbling around above your head searching for buttons."
4467098,MrSimon,2016-01-19 11:58:00,922,"On a recent vacation I used my GoPro a ton. I used a battery eliminator cable and attached it to an inexpensive battery pack .... that gives almost unlimited recording time. I also used the iPhone app and LOVE IT! You can control every aspect of the camera right from your phone, and the menus are better on the app than on the phone. I also like that the phone gives you a view finder, although there is a delay. Using the wifi on the camera uses a lot of battery life, but with the external battery it doesn't matter. To use the battery eliminator cord, I had to use a skeleton case .... which means it's no longer waterproof, but you get MUCH better sound quality. For fishing, this setup is great. I clamp the camera to the front of the boat, hook it up to the external battery, and let it run in loop mode all day long. I can control everything from my phone and don't fill up the memory card."

It's human nature to look where the action is, so by utilizing a head strap, when you turn your head to follow the action, the camera will also follow. Good luck!"
2913273,wesman40,2014-06-19 05:20:00,45,Heading to lac suel tomorrow for a week and picked up the hero 3+ black to take some videos. I also picked up a chest strap and multiple battery packs. I would appreciate any tips from others that have a go pro to make fishing vids. Seeing the videos by limeyangler inspired me to pick this up.
2913289,new hips,2014-06-19 05:34:00,498,"If your using a net, I like the bicycle clamp, mount the camera just behind the net. I'm buying a telescoping aluminum pole for underwater release shots.......and also putting the pole in a rod holder on the front of the boat for entire back of the boat action."
2913353,Mike Borger,2014-06-19 06:03:00,1554,"I also use the clamp a lot, it's really handy. Clamped on the side of the boat or on a net as mentioned or even the handle of your fishing rod.. Being such a wide angle camera it captures a lot of the action."
2913385,wesman40,2014-06-19 06:14:00,45,I got the bicycle clamp. I planned to attach it to a 4 ft flag pole that fits in the socket for running lights. Ill try the net mount too. I also have a telescoping boat hook that i can use for underwater release shots perhaps the release shots would also work on the net mount if position correctly. Great ideas. I am hoping to use the go pro as a way to get my 12 year old more interested in fishing. He wont be on this trip but he is stoked about the go pro purchase.
2913537,MrSimon,2014-06-19 07:28:00,922,"It might be personal preference, but I can't stand videos shot from head or chest mounts. They are so jumpy and twitchy. I MUCH prefer videos where the camera is mounted to something solid with a good view of everything going on in the boat. I like to mount a long pole to the transom and attach the camera to the top. Or, just have someone else hold the camera .... but tell them to move smoothly and slowly."
2913545,Pezman38,2014-06-19 07:35:00,3196,Lots being talked about on this other thread guys.https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...=356265&page=2
2913825,PRO-V1,2014-06-19 08:43:00,142,"I have to agree with MrSimon on a couple of points, strapping it to your head or chest makes it makes it hard to watch. I would also mount it on a pole on the bow, the camera seems to have a wide field of view so you would catch every thing that happens in your boat. Some of my favorite You Tube videos are from the Consummate Sportsman on steelhead, they have three cameras on the boat. Mike"
2913905,srk-low,2014-06-19 09:11:00,78,I attach the gopro to the four foot navigation light and put it in the bow socket It has worked well for me
2918169,Limeyangler,2014-06-20 07:50:00,563,"I like the head strap, talking to myself doing the commentary is weird enough without actually having the camera watching me do it....lol. (but i have to admit it is hard not to feel a little silly with a camera strapped to your head too)A couple of tips i would add is get the LCD back pack, the Battery back pack and the remote control, if you don't already have them. The LCD back pack allows you to quickly get a view of what is in shot, I then remove it and put on the battery back pack which really increases the battery length and the remote allows you to conserve battery power by being able to activate the camera from anywhere in the boat right when you need to film.I also made one of these by attaching a flat Gopro base plate to a $5 ratchet clamp, you can quickly clamp it to almost anywhere"
