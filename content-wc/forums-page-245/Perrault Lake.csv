Some ""locals"" prefer that because it's easier.......and hey, nothing wrong with that. Some lakes are complex, and depending on where you are on the lake, the patterns change, and are often changing hourly, weekly, seasonally... So if you have a technique based on fishing lakes with simple patterns....ie. shallow, stained water lakes.......and you move to an area like the West Arm (basically lake trout waters) those techniques will likely not produce. That doesn't mean the fish aren't there......you just don't have the knowledge / experience to have success. Not everyone wants a challenge.....simple is good too.....but often the most challenging waters can produce the best results. So while I will acknowledge that Eagle Lake can be challenging at times, that is not always a bad thing. Also a reason to do your homework, brush up on various techniques, pump the lodge owner for advice, and consider hiring a guide to shorten the learning curve."

4487834,Kmanster,2016-01-26 12:02:00,26,My group has fished this lake several times over the years and do love the variety and numbers (July). The resort owners and staff always put us on fish (Rainbow Pt Lodge). The cool thing about this lake is one of the hotter walleye spots is almost casting distance from the dock. We stopped going only because of the long drive. Now we mix in MN lakes with the occasional Canadian Fly-In. Tight lines
4405305,lama231,2015-12-27 20:53:00,29,Comparing this lake to the West arm of Eagle and also the Indian Lake Chain. Any help would be appreciated. The trip will be in mid July Thanks for the help
4406305,BornToFish,2015-12-28 11:43:00,1224,"Greetings, Lama, I sent a PM to you. I've fished on Perrault Lake for about fifty weeks over the last fifteen years. I think it's a great, multi-species lake. I haven't fished on either of the other bodies of water that you mentioned, so can't make a comparison for you. Don't hesitate to contact me via PM should you have specific questions. Regards......"
4406337,Bstar,2015-12-28 11:53:00,564,Fished the west arm for a week several years ago. Had to do a one day fly in to catch some walleye. Haven't been back since. Enough said. Don't know about the Indian Lake Chain. I would go to Perrault or Cedar lake. If you don't mind big water try Lac Seul.
4439393,team walleye,2016-01-09 21:18:00,336,I love Perrault. Have had great luck on it. I have been hung every other spring since 2003. Both Rocky Shore Lodge and Rainbow Point are great places to stay.
4441625,prov1800,2016-01-10 17:37:00,5010,Well if i had some guests that gave me those three choices and i had pick one i would be be taking them the the west arm for sure.Fishing is awesome there in july as the walleyes will be starting to hit all the humps in that secion.
4442785,Guest,2016-01-11 06:23:00,0,"Of course you would, your a guide on eagle, Perrault and Indian lake chain are all excellent fisheries and both lakes have excellent camps to stay at."
4443649,prov1800,2016-01-11 11:03:00,5010,Yes i am a guide.i do guide on eagle as well as many lakes in this area.thats how i conduct my guide service.i can give my guests options on what i feel which lake will produce the best fishing for a specific species.the question involved three lakes and from my experience fishing them and i do eagle by far exceeds the fishing with perrault and indian put together.not saying you dont catch fish on them just not as many.i fish cedar lake a lot and perrault lake doesnt produce like cedar does either.all the lakes have excellent accomadations and am sure a great week will be had no matter where you spend your holiday.
4443809,Walleye will,2016-01-11 11:43:00,218,What part off eagle do you guide on?
4443921,Guest,2016-01-11 12:39:00,0,"The locals don't fish Eagle, we fish the smaller local lakes, and they are da*n good fishing. We save Eagle for the americans and all the camps."
4444217,bigwillies,2016-01-11 14:29:00,515,"you would be surprised how many ""locals"" fish eagle. sure u can go into the smaller lakes and catch numbers but the chances of a 30""plus walleye are slim to zero. eagle is a great body of water. plus there is a good chance eagle has a world record musky in it too."
