Once, as we were drifting a large weed bed minnows would erupt at the lake surface and even breach it into the air. The second was watching trios of whitefish skirt along the surface with their pectoral fins breaking the water surface like a school of sharks. They were eating mayfly nymphs or emergers. Was quite a site and frustrating at the same time as they were just not that interested in anything you threw at them."
4472666,Mike Borger,2016-01-21 07:38:00,1554,"By that point in time I pretty much was only fishing for sustenance. Hard to fathom, but when you're in the bush for that long it becomes a survival game more than anything else.I used to love targeting whitefish in June when the mayflies were hatching. The first time I succeeded catching them on dry flies was a revelation. They were totally keying on the surface flies, not the emerging nymphs. I was throwing a small high floating stimulator pattern which is really just an attractor pattern. Kept getting these insane explosive hits and missed like 10 fish in a row. Then I figured out that when I was seeing them rise they weren't actually eating the fly. They were nudging it underwater, sometimes even with their tail then sucking the mayfly in once it was submerged. Not surprising considering the under slung mouth.I forced myself to count to three after the strike then lift the rod gently and began hooking fish.That was incredibly cool."

4482178,515,2016-01-24 13:23:00,254,Spent a lot of time fishing Hurst while staying on Felsia a few years back. Incredible fishery in both size and numbers.
4203442,ablack86,2015-09-15 07:24:00,17,Anyone fish Hurst Lake via Mattice? I've heard rave reviews about Mattice as an outfitter and we were looking to give them a go next year. Our group has narrowed things down to Guerin and Hurst Lakes. Anyone have any experience here?
4206962,ole timer,2015-09-16 14:35:00,34,"Fished both these lakes back in the 90's when Nakina Air owned the camps. I would go with Hurst. Bigger water, more options."
4207466,beer slayer,2015-09-16 18:58:00,33,"Just got back from Guerin 3 weeks ago, outfitter was fantastic! I have yet to post a trip report, but I will soon. My question is, how big is your group? My trip was just myself & my wife, 2 people was nice. Four people would probably be OK. I also am thinking of Hurst for next year, really not sure. Maybe you can go, and give me a report! hahahaha. Again fantastic outfitter!!! Great cabin!!! Good fishing! Feel free to PM me beer slayer (Kenny)"
4207842,Ogoki,2015-09-17 03:56:00,291,"I have fished Hurst once. Caught several 23-24 inch walleye. Didn't catch any decent pike. Leuenbergers have a cabin on Felsia, which connects to Hurst at the south, so you won't possibly be alone , if that matters to you. I fished Attwood twice which is much like Hurst. In that area I have also fished Bellsmith and Auger. Hard to beat Mattice Lake Outfitters. My deposit is paid for next June."
4209010,ablack86,2015-09-17 12:49:00,17,We have booked Hurst for next July. 8 of us total. We have gone on 5-6 fly ins together so close quarters is no big deal for us.Did you fish any of the portages at Guerin?
4212386,beer slayer,2015-09-18 20:02:00,33,"ablack86 - see my PM, Eight people would have been way to many at Guerin! I am not talking about the cabin size, although that would be tight. Portage lakes were good, bit of a hike. Good luck at Hurst, you will not be dissapointed!"
4214442,Ogoki,2015-09-20 05:53:00,291,"One place we did very well on Hurst for walleye was a little hard to locate each day . When you leave the cabin head south. You will see on the map the Attwood river turns and goes east and the south into Guerin . At that point Felsia comes in from the west. At that point there is an under water structure or sunken island. The top is not very wide but when I was there is was only 3 or 4 ft deep and went down to about 60 ft , if my mind serves me correctly. The walleye really related to that structure and we caught or bigger walleye there. In fact the only walleye I ever had mounted , came from that spot. Use a Gps to relocate this sopt. Another place we did well was the north side of the island , directly in front of camp. For small eater size walleye , we would fish the current where the Attwood river goes towards Guerin. Where the lake necks down heading southeast. Have fun !"

4472010,adempsey,2016-01-20 20:57:00,963,Locations of water chemistry tests performed by the MNR. You'll often see them marked by a partially filled in circle or a circle with a cross in it.
4472274,Mike Borger,2016-01-21 04:41:00,1554,"Kind of related. Years back I paddled through there on one of my solo trips and camped one night on a rocky point right where the river from Felsia dumps into Hurst.It's one of my most vivid memories. It was mid July and that night the lake was glass calm without a cloud in the sky and an almost full moon shining in the sky.Around midnight the lake erupted as fish began feeding on something right in front of me. In the moonlight I could see large walleye and pike ripping across the surface and sometimes jumping right out of the water chasing bait, it was like a saltwater feeding frenzy. It lasted for a good hour before things finally settled down.Never seen anything like that before or since in freshwater."
