I know it is pretty hard, but I am curious if you have any experience at this. I am looking at this Rotary Hammer Drill:http://www.dewalt.com/tools/hammerdr...s-d25501k.aspx These Bits:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00...=ATVPDKIKX0DER Do you think this is sufficient or not? Keep in mind we are only going about 5-6"" down with a 5/8"" carbide bit and we only need like 8 holes."

4483714,Fisherman1792,2016-01-25 05:02:00,927,I use a Bosch hammer drill underground for installing plugs and such with carbide bits and have no problem drilling. Just have a few bits with you and you should be OK. Most of the rock I drill into is very hard and drilling is no problem. 1/2 inch is the largest that I drill. Fisherman 1792
4483802,birddogger,2016-01-25 06:03:00,43,"I have an old bosch hammer drill about the same size as that dewalt and masonary bits. I drill up to 5/8 inch in the granite on lotw all of the time.Works great. I'm guessing that it takes about 2 -3 minutes to drill 6 inches deep, 1/2 inch diameter. The HAMMER action is the key. Good luck.."
4492322,fisherman 1,2016-01-27 16:11:00,39,"It will work fine, just let the drill do the work don't stand on it you will quickly burn up bits. Also lift the bit out of the hole to remove debris and cool the bit frequently."
