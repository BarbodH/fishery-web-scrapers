Wondered if anyone heres fished it, and if so how they did. Doesn't matter what lake were at.. I just know that I've already packed and repacked by tackle box at least 3 times..."

The lake is shallow and large patches of weeds.We caught most of our fish just a half mile north of the cabin along the eastern shore in 8-10 feet of water. We simply just used crawlers and vertical jigged over the side of the boat. You will get a lot of perch bites over the side that will frustrate you, but when the walleye hit you will know it.The lake has a healthy amount of Pike so hope you enjoy that. You can chase them in the same spots as the walleyes but use wire leaders and keep the bait above the weeds with your retrieve. Also don't forget to figure 8 at the boat.If the wind blows out of the Northwest, try some slip bobbers right off the cabin shore. I caught plenty of walleye just sitting on the North Shore of the island that the cabin is on. Didn't have to get in a boat!!!Don't forget some Lake Trout lures. Spoons mostly that you can just jig up and down in the depth you find them. The lake trout are in the portage lake.As for Mosambik lures, jigs, slip bobbers, spoons, buz bait or your favorite pike lure. The only out of the ordinary lure I liked was some weedless jig heads. They have some stiff metal wires protecting the hook from weeds. I could cast out the weedless and do a slow retrieve to change things up. The weedless jigs worked good.Anyway...The cabin is the nicest in the fleet and like I said, you can catch walleyes right of shore when the wind is right.PM me if you want anything else.Enjoy"

4495058,Tylumps,2016-01-28 15:30:00,73,"I have heard Little Miss is a great lake, but have never been myself. Mosambik is different than any other shield lake I have ever been to. Its more like a flood plain with the Magpie running through. Weeds in June take up the bottom 2-3 feet of almost the entire lake and as you know it does'nt get any deeper than 10-12 feet.Tons of fish and a great cabin.Curious, where do you stay Friday nite in Wawa? Ive stayed at High Falls and Wawa Inn mostly."
4496602,gonefishing13,2016-01-29 07:47:00,46,"Yea, Little Miss was amazing. So much water though, almost more of a river like lake.. Fished Easey as well and did pretty good there as well. A lot deeper of water. We actually stay at the Northern Lights Motel about 5 miles north of town. Since we have a big group we rent a Chalet, basically a small house that sleeps 8 for like 195 a night. http://nlmotel.com/"
