POW's were brought here, treated fairly and allowed to work in the communities near the camps Algona was the base camp for nearly 3 dozen other Midwestern camps. The northern most camp in the system was near Bena, MN. Check it out online. If any of you ever visit Algona, pm me and I'll show you around. We also have a 1/2 life sized Nativity scene that was built for our community by 4 prisoners as a thank for the humane treatment of the prisoners."
4501561,tly,2016-01-31 09:44:00,1900,"Stalag Wisconsin by Betty Cowley. Read this a couple years ago. It is pretty good. Lodi converted the fairgrounds to a P.O.W. camp and the prisoners mainly went to work on area farms. Lots of intermingling with locals since so many were maybe only a generation or less removed from Europe. Some prisoners came back after repatriation, along with families. We rented rooms to guard, a young soldier, his wife & child. Very nice folks."

I wonder how well the POW's taken by the Soviets made out? WWII was a terrible time in history, unbelievable cruelty! Something all nations should be ashamed of."
4493634,Mike Borger,2016-01-28 08:00:00,1554,"Very interesting Bill, thanks! I've since been trying to unearth a related story I heard about years back about a German pilot who escaped from another pow camp around Marathon I believe. Story goes he made his way from the north shore of Superior ultimately all the way back to Germany by stowing away on a ship. He was immediately pressed back into service where he was then shot down and killed.There's some really incredible stories floating around if you do a bit of digging."
4493754,btyreprich,2016-01-28 08:35:00,1067,"German POWs in Russia were treated harshly - almost always sent to prison camps in Siberia for many years. I saw a show on the fall of Stalingrad and it was mentioned that over 90% of those prisoners never returned home to Germany. I've been to Siberia twice to adopt children - that was tough enough. I cannot begin to imagine just how hard it was for the POWs given the conditions they worked and lived under. No wonder that near the end of the war, German military and civilians were desperate to surrender to the Americans & British."
4493778,Bill Krejca,2016-01-28 08:39:00,6107,"Our family was friends for many years with a local guide named Oscar Brusven. He managed the small resort at Turtle Portage. He told stories of the prisoners paddling around the lake in/on their canoes. He said the prisoners never caused any problems in the area, however, they did have boundaries for their paddling. They were told that if they paddled south of the portage, they would be shot. To have gotten past the portage, one would have had to carry a short distance, about 100 feet, or possibly float through the narrow passage if the water level permitted. As far as he knew, no one was ever shot. If you think about it, this maybe wouldn't have been that bad of a situation, much better than being bombed or shot at on the war front on a daily basis. The bay in which we found the canoe was directly east, about a mile, from the prisoner camp. Bill"

When is the last time anyone referred to Germans as the ""enemy?""When I was a kid my parents took me to the fairgounds in Eldora, Iowa and showed me the supposed bunkhouses, now livestock barns, which held German POWs. Apparently Algona, Iowa was a POW center and had branch camps throughout the area. No offense to Algona or Eldora, but I'd prefer LOTW."

4490858,Bill Krejca,2016-01-27 08:52:00,6107,"I remember well the remains of the prisoner camp at Alfred Inlet, due to our family for years spending several weeks a year fishing at Turtle Portage, which had a small resort at the time. Some time between 1946 and 1950, we found a prisoner's dugout canoe buried in the sand beach near Last Point. I have several pictures of me paddling the canoe around near the portage. The canoe was just that - a large log hollowed out and axed into a canoe. It actually paddled fairly well, but quite tippy - the maker must have been on the slim side, as a person with any extra width would not have fit. For years after, we used to go to the site to pick berries as the site was clear of trees and brush for a long time. Eventually brush and poison ivy grew over the area, and little was/is now evident to indicate the history which was made there. Cabin materials were used by locals after the war to supplement construction for local cabins in the general area. Additional information on the prisoner camps is available on further Goggle searches, a fascinating part of the many stories connected to the war effort and influences. Bill"

But, Bill did not go into the in-depth detail of what was presented in the enclosed writing. I wonder if there is much evidence of the various camp sites? Bill talks about a camp located in the extreme South portion of Whitefish Bay just North of the ""Turtle Portage"". It was my understanding that the camp was just NW of ""Last Pt. & Squaw Is."" on the Aulneau Peninsula. Thanks Pikeslayer8 for the article!! CRJohn"
