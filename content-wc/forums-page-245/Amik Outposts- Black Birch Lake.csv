4474138,wmd,2016-01-21 13:12:00,388,considering a trip in late May to Black Birch Lake with this outfitter. Please give feedback on both the outfitter and the lake if you have been there. How was the outfitter to work with etc and of course the fishing. Thanks wmd

John flies his own Otter and is one of those lucky guys who really loves his job. Cabin was more than adequate. Boats and motors were in good condition. I believe Blackbirch is in the same general area as Cobham so the fishing should be excellent. We caught both quantity and quality of walleye on Cobham and sometimes had a hard time catching eaters for lunch because 20""-21"" seemed like the average walleye all week. 27"" was the largest of the week with several in the mid 20's. You won't be disappointed if you go with Amik."
