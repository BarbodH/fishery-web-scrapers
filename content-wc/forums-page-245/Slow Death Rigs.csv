4489138,ftfarms,2016-01-26 18:42:00,444,I guess we're all different. When I need to troll slow I like them with a float on them. Helps keep the hook out of the rocks and gives it more wobble action. Works great.

4453985,Dave Si,2016-01-15 09:33:00,27,You have to make subtle changes to traditional trolling techniques if you want to stay competitive on the Walleye Trail. Like going from an aluminum hull to a GL. Can't wait to see your new ride.
4460657,Rush57702,2016-01-17 13:33:00,16,Anybody tried a leach on the slow death rig. If so how did you rig the leach on the hook?
4460689,BornToFish,2016-01-17 13:49:00,1224,"An earlier post on this thread suggested using two swivels on the snells for slow death rigs. I understood this comment to mean that one swivel may not be enough to prevent line twist originating with the rotating hook. Where should the two swivels be placed on the spinner harness to minimize line twist? For example, I could locate them just in front of the slow death hook, at the end of the snell away from the hook, in the middle of the snell or on the end of the main fishing line.I will soon be tying a bunch of slow death rigs for use this summer. I would appreciate hearing your suggestions. Many thanks...."
4461121,Dave Si,2016-01-17 17:36:00,27,Using high quality swivels is key; tie one on the end of your leader and the other would be a snap-swivel on the main line. I make my walleye tackle so it is a natural to spend the extra $0.25 on a bit that is never included on store-bought harnesses. Sorry about the confusion.
4469514,BornToFish,2016-01-20 08:25:00,1224,"Dave Si, What brands/sizes of swivels and snap swivels have you found to work well for you for your Slow Death rigs? I am following up on your suggestion as best I can - one swivel at the end of the snell and a snap/swivel on the end of the main line. I noticed that some area fishing tackle stores have ""economy"" priced terminal tackle. I assume that you do NOT use these brands. The premium priced brands were Sampo and Spro. Any suggestions? Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4469746,Dave Si,2016-01-20 09:28:00,27,"Lately I have been buying my components from www.luremaking.com. Very good prices and the more you spend, the deeper the discounts. I am waiting for an order to arrive in the mail; I expect it today or tomorrow. Smiley blades are purchased at the retail stores because I use so few. But not to blindly lead you onto a particular path, choose any ball bearing swivel at your tackle shop over a plain wire/brass component for the peace-of-mind of knowing that your leader will not twist up and ruin the presentation as you drift over a particularly promising point. Plus you rarely lose them. The only thing I do not recycle (re-use) are hooks if I get any of it back after a snag or toothy critter attack."
4470202,BornToFish,2016-01-20 12:18:00,1224,"Dave, Thanks for the timely and helpful response. I think that I am now ready to start tying the spinner rigs. Good fishing and tight lines!!"

4486346,polaris-pete,2016-01-25 19:42:00,343,"As is most cases, you get what you pay for. Why chance loosing a nice fish, rigs and twisted lines to save a few bucks. Quality terminal tackle is NOT the place to cut corners. Sampo and Spro are all we use on our boats."
4375209,BornToFish,2015-12-13 11:40:00,1224,"Greetings, Most of our fishing in NW Ontario is during August and September. We do extremely well for walleyes by vertical jigging in fairly deep water alongside structure. Until now, spinner rigs haven't been a significant part of our walleye game. However, last year my wife and I fished an additional week during early July. We did quite well back-trolling with spinner rigs along wind-blown shoreline. The spinner rigs mostly featured #2 hooks, some beads, a quick change clevis and a blade (#3, #4 or #5). These rigs were simple to make and very effective. I was thinking of tying some spinner rigs this winter with a slow death style hooks. Do you have any suggestions on effective ways to tie rigs with slow death hooks? Do you use spinner blades, or is the turning hook sufficient? What baits do you use with slow death rigs? Many thanks and Merry Christmas to you and your family!!"
4375537,3 Z's,2015-12-13 14:24:00,133,"I've used them quite a bit on LOTW and your local Winnebago. I have an assortment tied up. Some with just a plane hook, others with beads, and more with beads and spinners. I like using smile blades with them too."
4376385,ftfarms,2015-12-13 20:56:00,444,I use them with toms tackle spinners. Thay come with a hook to big so I cut it off and put on a slow death hook. In the summer there's nothing on lotws better than a spinner and worm or leach with a slow death hook. Lots of flash and movement of the bait. Pink- white. Pink-gold pink-black pink-flash. Did I mention PINK!!!
4399497,Warrior56215,2015-12-24 13:40:00,46,"I use a bottom bouncer with about an 18"" mono leader and a slow death hook with half a crawler on Lac Seul. It was better than jig and minnow this past July."
4399697,Downrigger,2015-12-24 14:41:00,60,"For many reasons, hesitate to even ask, but what is a slow death hook?"

4445785,canyon,2016-01-12 04:07:00,37,First year using these last season when the fishing was slow during jigging or trolling cranks. We hooked them up to bottom bouncers with no beads or blades just the hook with a leach and we cleaned up!
4452513,reidcb,2016-01-14 13:35:00,24,I am going to try these.
4452529,Dave Si,2016-01-14 13:50:00,27,Try trolling a slightly longer leader (1m+) and a Mack's Smiley spinner behind a sliding bottom bouncer. Be prepared to feed out a little line while the walleye makes his way up the worm. And two ball bearing swivels. Works for me out west.
