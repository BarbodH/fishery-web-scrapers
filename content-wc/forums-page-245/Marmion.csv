4503145,Walleye will,2016-01-31 17:19:00,218,I've just herd of this lake and looked at lodges in the area. Has anyone fished it or has info? Feel free to pm me.
4503441,adempsey,2016-01-31 19:07:00,963,All I know about that lake is that it is divided into an Upper and Lower section with dams as part of the Seine River Diversion in the 1940's. All had to do with hydroelectric generating stations and mining.
4503809,big popi,2016-02-01 05:23:00,635,"That is correct the lake is divided into two sections upper & lower. You can access the upper section through a sluiceway (unless the water is too high or too low). The lower is mostly noted for SM bass, although the the upper section has decent SM bass also. The walleye can be pretty decent, they just tend to move around a bit. The closest place to stay is Finlayson Resort, about 10 minutes or so from the the lower Marmion launch. As a note the Atikokan Bass Classic is held on Marmion the second week in August, so from about two weeks before it gets pretty busy. My family has been going to this area since 1968, we enjoy it very much."
4503841,Walleye will,2016-02-01 05:49:00,218,Where do you stay. Also how meny walleye do you see a day?
4504281,big popi,2016-02-01 08:51:00,635,"We stay at Finlayson resort, we usually go in mid-July. As far as walleyes, we see maybe 30-40 a piece on a good day. Always seem to get the eaters we need. FYI, the daily limit on Sportsman lisc in 2/day 4/total in this area."
