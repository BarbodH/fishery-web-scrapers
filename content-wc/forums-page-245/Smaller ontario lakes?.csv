Stayed at Clarks Northern Lights. Some of our best walleye fishing was within sight of the camp. Reasonable prices, nice accommodations and free minnows is a bonus. Would definitely recommend them. Probably around 3 hours from Ft. Frances. -Chris"

4480306,ftfarms,2016-01-23 17:56:00,444,I like cedar lake also but that's a longer drive than you suggested. I like cedar point resort the best location on the lake. I was thinking it's not a small lake but you could go with Youngs camp in Stevens bay on lake of the woods. You can get into some great fishing in that bay for walleye and smallmouth. Its really sheltered so you can make it like a small lake or expand out and leave the bay make it a bigger lake?

It's on Perrault lake and the fishing was outstanding, very nice camp, top notch equipment and the best part, it's owned by Americans, who didn't give our group the bum's rush (can't wait to get you out of camp) so we can close up! Fired the last 2 Canadian camps we stayed at, when you're a LOW maintaince group and spending a lot of money, I don't need a attitude to go with my stay.Manotak Lodge were real pros and rebooked for 2016, and they were AMERICANS without the ""tude"".."
