1312373,Jack77,2011-05-29 08:49:00,168,I hope he had a good reason! and it had better be an unexpected reason. Depending on the circumstances but that could really put someone on my sh@t list.

Normally the guy that bounced out and left the others hanging is shuffled to the bottom of the deck for a while at least.When one guy decides not to go it really does effect the others vacations. We miss not having that guy with us or we would not have included him in the first place. Most of the time when one of our guys bails out it is for a good reason and there are never any ill feelings.Pooch
