1311970,Guest,2011-05-27 14:28:00,0,How is road from Fort Frances to Dryden? We go to Gull Rock and years ago stopped going that way because of the poor road. Now go west and thru Nestor Falls. Probably shorter thru Dryden. Any comments?

My recollection from a couple trips last year was the first 20 click out of FF was good, the next 20 click was the worst, and everything else was smooth sailing. It seems like they were working their way south over the last couple years. Any recent word on the 2nd 20 clicks north from FF?"
