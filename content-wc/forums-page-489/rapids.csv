I have fished the west end of LS in late May and early June for years, the later in the season the deeper are the walleyes. We used to fish the Rapids when the open date was June 1st, my boat/cabin buddies birthday! The walleyes will be there, just in differnt spots! Good Luck! Next saturday, we hit the Lac!"
