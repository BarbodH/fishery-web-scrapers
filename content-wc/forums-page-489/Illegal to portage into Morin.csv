1312744,lenray,2011-05-30 16:37:00,467,"It is in what they call a QFZ Quality Fishing Zone. And is connected by a river to a lake that is a fly-in-lake. It is a lake that takes a couple of portages and the road getting to the first lake is a closed road with a locking gate. Sometimes the gate is open--maybe more often than not--, but there is signage saying the area is a QFZ. tHE MNR office in Chapleau said the fine would be 1000.00"
1312818,phishfearme,2011-05-30 19:29:00,1242,"len - i'm confused - in ontario (unlike quebec) a ""fly-in lake"" does not have exclusive rights to the lake. if you can get there - legally - then you can camp and fish there (with camping permits and fishing license). is the fine for using the road illegally or camping/fishing at a ""fly-in lake"". numerous lakes i've flown into which are on a major river have canoe tripper going thru regularly - the outfitter with the fly-in LUP cannot stop them - they can in quebec though. thanks, phish"
1312891,adempsey,2011-05-30 23:07:00,963,"Interesting. I am not familiar with a QFZ. Will have to do some investigating. Thanks for the info.Phishfearme - The fly-in lake is actually Anjigaming and Morin is connected to this lake by a river. So it's Morin that is protected or whatnot according to what Lenray posted.edit: Can't find much on the subject, but it seems to me it only refers to use of the road for angling purposes. Not fishing the lake. Have to look some more."
