1265720,fishforbrains,2011-01-28 12:43:00,12,Hello fishing world.I am heading up to Morson LOW this july and will be staying close to hansen bay using only small camp boats and would like any info on some of the better places to catch smallies.thanks.
1265822,1700SS,2011-01-28 18:15:00,104,I do well in early July just fishing shorelines. Using small crankbaits. Sometimes it will be broken rock and sometimes softball size rock shorelines. After a day or 2 you should be able to pick up a pattern. I also use a thin diameter steel leader for the occasional muskie or pike. Good luck.
1265829,muskyman73,2011-01-28 19:06:00,402,"we do the same, target chunck rock and throw crawdad pattern rattletraps / crankbaits. We get alot of walleye that way too. Jerkbaits work good too, and topwater will probably be on as well."
1265896,Bill Krejca,2011-01-29 08:06:00,6107,"I believe smallmouth are among the easiest fish to catch during this period. As stated, a shore having football size rocks will usually yield good results. Don't be afraid to lay your baits right on the shoreline, and, holding the rod tip high (for a sinking bait), swim it back, slowing down the retrieve to follow the bottom. You should also target any small inlets along the shoreline - sometimes just a several ft cut into the shoreline - a ""mini-bay"" will hold a lunker. A floating bait should be allowed to sit a bit before retrieve - this means the boat should be barely moving. My best results have always been to work the bait slowly, quite opposite of what is seen on most TV ""marathon casting speed retrieve"" shows. My larger fish have been taken with a slow retrieve, smaller fish seem to usually prefer the ""burn it to the boat"" approach. Don't be afraid to occasionally stop your retrieve for a second or so, as a wounded minnow would do to rest. A small wire leader, as previously stated, should enable you to land some potential nice pike/musky. Water clarity in this portion of the lake is not high, so the leader should not impede your bait's attractiveness. You should get a little bit of everything while fishing bass, the area has much to offer; please give us a report when you return. Bill Krejca"

1267164,fishforbrains,2011-02-01 17:14:00,12,Hello everyone thank you for your responce to my earlier post. I just got back from Florida to return to the snowstorm of the decade in Chicago.Without asking you to give away your personal hotspots I wonder if you could put me in the right direction on which reefs or islands have produced for you near the hanson bay area.I have fished the woods for over ten years but never south of rabbit island and since I have only a small camp boat I dont think I can reach my normal spots up in Miles bay. thanks

1312397,rpieske,2011-05-29 10:03:00,1276,"I fish that whole area and have for 58 years. Bill Krejca's advice is excellent. I likie to use a 4"" fluke or jig spinners. There is no need to ask for specific locations, smallies are everywhere. Just look for the type of cover described in the above posts. Get a good map #6214 and look it over for the saddles, reefs, rocky shorelines, etc. that you want to fish. Most of the camp boats these days are 16' or better and have 40-50 HP motors. This will get you out to Miles Bay without much problem. You really are not that far from there. But you will be passing lots of great smallmouth on the way up there. It's really not necessary to make that trip. If you want, give me a shout right before you come up and I'll let you know what's going on. Good Luck!!"
