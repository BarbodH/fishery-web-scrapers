1050650,Seanik,2008-08-21 09:22:00,218,"Thanks Uncle P for the information, It looks like the best route for us would be to North Bay and then East. We have been going to the Gouin for past 3 years but we are ready for a change. The availability of Lake and speckled trout makes MTL an interesting alternative."
1050655,Guest,2008-08-21 09:53:00,0,No problem Seanik - we actually took our first trip in May to the Gouin - thanks to the recommedations of McQ - we went to Nemio - we had a great trip and booked right away for next year...I would imagine that would be a long drive from PA...it was a long drive from Ottawa... Good luck on your trip - please post a report.. Uncle P
1051274,McQ,2008-08-25 05:10:00,615,"It's been at least 20 years since I last flew into Moose Territory. The roads then were very questionable and the Beaver was the best way to access. I have a few fond memories of the time on Lake Marion, Lakers up to 12 lbs and Northerns of the hammerhandle variety but a ton of them. Never did fish any of the surrounding lakes so can't provide any further info. I'm sure much has changed with the passage of time. Just returned from the Gouin yesterday - another great week but the road in this trip was a challenge, heavy rain on the way in but the weather settled and even with the waning moon accompanied by cold front conditions the bigger fish were on. I would suggest you check out Club Trout Lake which is above the Kipawa accessed through Ville Marie & Belleterre - only 25 miles of gravel and the options are many. My fishing buddy Tomcat arranged this trip and we elected to portage into Bay Lake which is accessed by RR portage. The lodge staff looked after the bullwork and the six of us enjoyed a very interesting week of big fish compettition. This remote location provided us with the seclusion we all seek and the variety of water to explore kept us on the go all week.http://www.clubtroutlake.com/ Unc P the school went very well and your spring group antics did make it into the dining room conversations a few times LOL"
1267825,Guest,2011-02-03 13:56:00,0,We are heading up there this June for our first time. We will fish Bapiti Lake and look for some walleye that we hope are co-operative. we have 3 or 4 years in a row of low catches in 3 other lodges. Does anyone have any recent updates on the fishing at Moose Territory and what about Bapiti lake in particular? Anything would help.
1267833,Mike Borger,2011-02-03 14:26:00,1554,I fished Trapp and Clement lakes many many years ago for brook trout and did extremely well. Can't speak about any of their other lakes. I actually called them last fall looking to go back for a 3 day trip but it didn't work out. The camp is under new ownership now and it seems as though they're making improvements.
1270051,bob23,2011-02-10 17:44:00,2,Well i had great experiences with blue walleye fishing on lake kipawa. 2009/2010 i stayed at a lodge in the north section of the lake. Cedar Valley Lodge is under new management and they offer amazing service and have great fishing and hunting deals. Well that would be my suggestion. Hope this helps anyone!Here you can find them online: http://www.cedarvalleylodge.caBob

1047933,Seanik,2008-08-07 12:15:00,218,"We didn't go fishing in Canada this year and we miss it. Our group of 4 old timers went to Plymouth, Mass. on a party boat for Haddock and Cod and it basically sucked. Winching up 3-5 lb fish from 200 feet 27 miles out on the ocean ain't our cup of tea. This deep sea trip was prompted by the price of gas, our cheap dollar and the sometimes hassle at the border. Now that we got that out of our sluggish systems we are getting passports and planning the 2009 Canada fishing trip. Since we are getting long of tooth the 16-18 hour drives are a bit much so we are looking closer to Erie Pa our home town. After searching the net I found a lodge that might be what we are looking for. Moose Territory Lodge located at Rapides des Joachims, Quebec is 250 miles northeast of Toronto plus 62 miles of bush road with exclusive rights. I believe they have about 10 lakes with Lake Trout, Aurora Trout?, Blue Walleye, Yellow Walleye and Northern Pike. If anyone has been there or knows about this lodge we sure would appreciate your comments. I searched this forum and others and came up with zero. We would like to get a deposit in early and then concentrate on the Whitetail deer hear in Pa."
1048012,GBS,2008-08-07 18:26:00,2271,"Do a web search - their site makes them sound a bit sketchy - they are really pushing that they are for sale. Kinda cool that they have their own sawmill to make everything, even their own boats! Wonder what they mean when they say the are a camp, not a lodge??? Might this be a tad more primative than you want? Or not?"
1048134,Seanik,2008-08-08 11:31:00,218,"GBS I did an extensive search on the net for Moose territory Lodge before I posted here and came up with nothing. I recently received their brochure and got a little more information. They have owned and developed this lodge for over 45 years, I''ll bet age is the reason they have it up for sale, the timeline has to put the owners in their 70's. I 'm not to concerned about the quality of fishing since they have 45 lakes in their 65 square miles of exclusive territory, my main concern is the 62 miles of bush road to the camp. The brochure says a truck or 4x4 is needed to travel on this road, probably a clearance issue, and about 3 hours time. We travel in a full sized Ford van, not 4x4, I'm wondering if this vehicle is up to the task? The lodges address is via Rolphton, Ontario, which can't be to far from North Bay? This is all new to us and we are looking for information on this place."
1048146,phishfearme,2008-08-08 12:28:00,1242,"hey seanik, hope all is well with you! although i'm not familiar with moose territory, i spent some time on their site and i think this place looks pretty nice (although the lakes seem abit small) - and a much shorter drive for those of us from western PA. i noted that there's two different driving routes - one thru pembroke in addition to the one you mentioned - possibly longer but maybe easier?? also, i couldn't find their rates anywhere on the site - what's the damage for a week there? went chasing your lake erie walleye yesterday with northstar charters out of walnut creek - 4 of us limited out with 22-24 inchers (largest = 28) at noon. like your trip to the ocean, i don't really care for this type of fishing - troll, troll, troll and you don't know who catches what not to mention tangled lines and dragging large fish around for a long time without knowing one's on. anyway, lots of good meat though. phish"
1048179,Seanik,2008-08-08 15:14:00,218,"Hi Phish, I know what you mean about trolling for Walleye on Lake Erie. I live 3 miles away from Presque Isle Bay and have a 30' Searay but only Perch fish. The 2008 price for a week fishing package (4 persons minimum) at MTL is 750.00 US per person, that includes cabin, boat, motor and gas, Sat. noon in-Sat.morning out. Less than 4 persons add another 50.00. Modified American plan (breakfeast and dinner) is an additional 300.00 for 7 days. This information is in their brochure. They claim the fishing is as good as it was 45 years ago when they opened the camp, the speckled trout where stocked on some lakes by the owners. The shorter drive along with 45 lakes and exclusive rights puts this lodge at the top of the short list for the 2009 trip. regards, Jerry"
1049962,Seanik,2008-08-18 08:12:00,218,"I am looking for first hand information on the bush road into the camp. They have been in business for 45 years there must be somebody who knows about this lodge! Thank you,"
1050194,Guest,2008-08-19 07:50:00,0,Hey Guys I have been to Ten Mile Lodge about 4x - which I believe you must drive right by to get to the Moose Territory - the road into Ten Mile is in fairly good shape if you hit it at good time (not after heavy rain) - my buddy drove his Hyundai Santa Fe in there with no problems....it is more of a clearance issue - there are no bad sections that you will need 4x4 - it is about 3 hrs from Rolphton...with a few beer stops.. Check out Ten Mile - it is really a nice place..the fishing is pretty good - although Lake Dumoine is a big body of water.http://www.tenmilelodge.com/ Let me know if you need more info. Uncle P

1050385,Guest,2008-08-20 06:55:00,0,Hi Seanik I would suggest that you drive up hwy 81 - right to the end at the Canadian border - then you take hwy 401 east towards Ottawa/Montreal - follow this about 35 miles - then take hwy 416 north towards Kemptville/Ottawa - follow this for about 45 miles - then take hwy 417 west towards Pembroke/Kanata...you are on this hwy for 120 miles till you reach your turn at Rolphton - that is the most direct route which takes you around most of the major cities such as Toronto. I actually live in Canada - near Ottawa - so a trip to that area is only about 4 hrs drive for us. Let me know if you need anything else. thanks Uncle P
1050389,Guest,2008-08-20 07:10:00,0,Sorry - I just noticed your in Erie...I guess the best route would be thru Toronto - and then up to North Bay - it would be faster. Uncle P
