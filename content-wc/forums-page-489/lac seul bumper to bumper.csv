1312012,gravelrash30,2011-05-27 18:10:00,14,Just returned and it was a zoo didn't matter where you went there was boats everywhere. If you are catching fish plan on half a dozen boats pulling up and. Fishing on top of you caught a lot of nice fish. Had a cold front come in and slow the bit down but overall good fishing. A lot of boat went home with bent props or minus the lower unit. Water is down more than last year by a foot. We fished super shallow by a tiny island

1312077,rather-be-fishin,2011-05-27 22:43:00,429,Mark R.... LOL Loved your comment!!! I too fished that same spot!
1312083,wallydave,2011-05-28 02:40:00,2151,"Sounds like the island near Goose Bay? May be? Any other news? How iare the water temps, how shallow is shallow? Which colors eh?"
1312200,Jabs,2011-05-28 12:13:00,24,Birch Narrows was like a circus. It was fun looking a parked house boat for a week. We ended up catching a lot of bigger fish in less known spots
1312499,davenathe,2011-05-29 17:03:00,113,"wow fish out of Hudson area and maybe see two boats a day, and one is our boat. lol"
1312625,wallydave,2011-05-30 08:12:00,2151,"My group is less then a week away now, let the rest of the walleye wranglers feed off of your reports!! Water temps, levels, colors, lets hear about all of it!! Have great fishing trips for all!"
1312825,BenBeattie,2011-05-30 19:46:00,232,"low 50's to low 60's for water temps. Colors....... it doesn't matter!! haha, although I do favor, white, chart and glow. In the last 3 days I've caught walleye in 2' of water pitching to shore and walleye in 20' off prominent points, and everywhere in between. I've burned at a spot, then come back 2 hrs later to find it loaded with fish. I've been spot checking some areas that I usually fish later on and finding fish at most of them. Not a lot but they're there and avg. size is nice. Finding stomach contents packed with may-fly nymphs. On warm afternoons they emerge from soft-bottomed shallow bays. The walleye will be there too!"
1313010,tv4fish,2011-05-31 11:17:00,2694,Yeah - Anytime we see a BOB (Bikini on Board) the fish ALWAYS seem to be biting close by.
