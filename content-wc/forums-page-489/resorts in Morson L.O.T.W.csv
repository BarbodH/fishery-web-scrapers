1272441,Obabikon,2011-02-18 08:48:00,2370,"A lot of it depends on what type of trip you're looking for. I'd be happy to make suggestions. Tamarak is more remote than the other two... also has some HUGE water near by that can be tough if the wind picks up. Red Wing is a good place too. It's on the mainland, and if you're looking for that it's the only three that you mentioned that is strictly a drive to. Mylies place is right around the corner, and Justin runs a heck of a place over there. So, I'd suggest looking into both of those. Sabaskong Bay is another solid choice. The owners have put a lot of work into it, and it's probably going to be in better shape than Tamarak. A little closer to the marina, and no big water... But, all in all... www.obabikon.com is tough to beat! hahaha"
1272524,Bill Krejca,2011-02-18 12:32:00,6107,"If you want to stay out on the water, Obabikon is located in an ideal spot, with easy access to Obabikon Lake and Miles Bay. Jared runs a comfortable and picturesque camp, with good fishing close to camp. Bill"
1272965,Guest,2011-02-19 19:44:00,0,"I went to Obabikon Camp when I was 16 years old with my dad and it was great back then. That would have been 40 years ago. I have gone back to Obabikon at least 15 times with groups of friends and relatives and I don't think you can find a nicer camp. The location is ideal and the cabins and staff were always good and friendly. Showers are a bit tight as I am 6'2"" and 195 pounds and the fleet of boats are good. I have not been there since Jared has taken over. I am sure he is doing a good job. The food is good even though Larry(the cook) uses too dang many onions! Just my opinion Larry! Hope to see you guys up there this next year."

1312488,Obabikon,2011-05-29 16:23:00,2370,Fish... send me a PM with exactly what kind of trip you're looking for. I'll respond with my honest opinion of what would make the best trip. Housekeeping? Bring your own boat? Want remote? What type of fish is your #1 target? How big's your group? Give me some facts and I'll give you a list of pros and cons for each resort in our area.
1267462,fishforbrains,2011-02-02 14:23:00,12,"I am looking into some resorts in the Morson area. Sabiskong bay camp,Tamerack lodge,and Red wing lodge.Has anyone ever stayed at these places and how was your stay?"
1267494,Tom502,2011-02-02 16:05:00,118,"Have never stayed at the places you mentioned, but have stayed at New Moon Lodge which is on an island about 10-12 miles out of Morson. Very nice place - the family that owns and runs the place have been in the business for 30+ years. Very good people to work with. Mostly American Plan but they do have a couple of cabins that you can cook in. Very good fishing and great guides. Web site is: http://newmoonlodge.ca/ Tight Lines, Tom502"
1267643,PJM,2011-02-02 22:14:00,3516,Fishforbrains I sent you a PM
1268247,champ8,2011-02-05 08:35:00,40,"i've stayed at Tamarack a couple of times. Great location. The cabins were nothing special but were very adequate and a good value for the $. I wish they would upgrade the camp boats though, those 25 horse motors don't move you very fast in the water and the trolling motors were tired. While you can catch plenty of fish within 15 minutes of the camp. I'm still one of those guys that likes to go farther off and explore other areas. I have been trying other resorts the past couple of years and would like to here of what others think about Sabaskong Bay Lodge and the basil outpost of Red Wing Lodge."
1268493,Mark R,2011-02-06 07:45:00,1538,Mylies Place is a nice fish camp in Morson. Family owned and operated.
1268602,wolverine fan,2011-02-06 14:35:00,71,"Stayed at Youngs wilderness camp last year, it was a great experience. Fishing was good and the food and service from dock hands to food servers were great. Cabins were ok but overall we really enjoyed it. Big plus for us were the bow mounted trolling motors which is how i like to fish. Good luck."
1269242,Bill Krejca,2011-02-08 12:09:00,6107,"Stayed at Red Wing once. Nothing fancy, but was well run, some 11 years ago. Liked the assigned docking for private boats. Left vehicles at Mylies several times when I camped out on the lake. Seemed to be another good camp. Go to Youngs yearly, very clean, well staffed and organized. Bill"
1269707,johnboat,2011-02-09 18:15:00,2014,"Mylie's Place for sure. Clean as a whistle, great updated cabins, new boat ramp. Easy to get to and the folks there are as good as it gets. John B.O.A.T."
1270085,1shooter,2011-02-10 19:10:00,1493,Grassy Narrows is a great place to stay. We have gone there for years and love it. Kind of hard to beat Betty and Jerry. Obabikon is good too.
1272385,Chad711,2011-02-18 06:04:00,11,"Highly recommend Mylies resort, awesome place and some amazing fishing right where the cabins are."
