1311122,wallydave,2011-05-25 10:09:00,2151,"Knoxabilly, our week starts June 4th, we usually are a week earlier, but my boat and cabin buddy is a school teacher now! Plus his boys are old enough to make the trip, so June 4th it is! We have been to the Lac at least 8 times, we like to start at the Rapids, and move on to other spots! Your right June first has usually been the date that they open the Sanctuary, the same day as my buddies b-day! What a way to celebrate! Fresh walleye and Kokanee!"
1311133,Knoxabilly,2011-05-25 10:53:00,225,"I will be there 5/28, 2 days till we start driving! This will be my 15th year fish Lac Seul, used to fish the rapids and Sanctuary but since they pushed the opening date back, i haven't been in there in years. We used to get a lot of numbers in there but not much size for some reason. Sounds like your buddy is getting the ultimate b-day present! I'll keep ya updated on the fishing when I get there"
1311760,bpetersen,2011-05-26 21:16:00,251,I thought the sanctuary near Earfalls opens around the 15th of June. Pete
1311789,wallydave,2011-05-27 03:29:00,2151,"They may have changed the date, it has been a couple of years since we made the trip North. I'll know more when we get there! We leave in a week!"
1311875,lrpetp,2011-05-27 09:41:00,37,I thought this thread was about Lac Seul water levels!
1311890,wallydave,2011-05-27 10:18:00,2151,"Your right, the water level must have drifted us off course!"
1311936,Steve Ediger,2011-05-27 13:02:00,97,"Mike,We will be back at LSL 6-11 through 6-25. While there last week we rode out to the Black Bay Outpost with Dan to deliver ice, gas, & minnows along with a couple of guests. Seems a beaver decided to turn the dock @ Black Bay into his house. Dan & Lew dismantled it on Tuesday only to find it rebuilt the next Saturday when we got there. It wasn't funny - yea it was! How is the smallmouth & walleye fishing up Aldous Bay? Looks interesting on a map."
1312926,wallydave,2011-05-31 07:23:00,2151,Any updates on the water levels on Lac Seul? The west end is where my group will be heading in just a few more days!
1312932,Mike Kansas,2011-05-31 07:40:00,1463,"Guess we will have Beaver on the BBQ one night. Aldous bay has some great Walleye and Smallie fishing. As you go up into Aldous the bays on your left have been holding more and more Smallies evcery year. Aldous itself has some great Walleye structure. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1312935,jswinter40,2011-05-31 07:46:00,127,"Hey Mike, what lures/bait/colors/depth do like to target smallies up on LS? end of June/early July? gonna try target them some this trip. thanks"
1310376,Mike Kansas,2011-05-23 14:27:00,1463,"Any reports on Lac Seul water levels? Thanks, Mike Kansas"
1310391,KTroller,2011-05-23 14:57:00,237,They look pretty close to last year based on lwcb website.http://www.lwcb.ca/pdf/2-YEARGRAPHS2011.05.20.pdf
1310619,Mike Kansas,2011-05-24 06:54:00,1463,Thanks KTroller....Hope you have a great season and a safe one. Mike Kansas
1310708,wallydave,2011-05-24 10:18:00,2151,"I like to stop on the 105 near Perrault Falls to check the water levels. The roar of the water, and the mist in the air, are just what the doctor ordered to help with the anticipation...its just an hour or two to Goose Bay from there!"
1310749,Steve Ediger,2011-05-24 12:11:00,97,"Mike, I was on Lac Seul May 20 - 22. The water level was about normal for this time of year but was 4-5 feet below what I am used to seeing in the middle of June. This was my first opener. I was fishing out of Lac Seul Lodge and the water was too low to use the short cut - if you know where I'm talking about."
1310754,jswinter40,2011-05-24 12:22:00,127,"Steve, Buddy, come on, help us out here. you are killing us! How did the fishing go?"
1310768,Steve Ediger,2011-05-24 12:43:00,97,"OK, we did well on pike on Friday. Weather turned a bit for the Saturday opener on walleye but we caught a few. Sunday was a bust for us. Like I said, this was our first opener and we really didn't know what we were doing. I think we should have gone deeper up the bays and fished shallower, warmer water. I will be back up there in three weeks and have a much better idea of how to fish that time of year. Can't wait!"
1310789,Mike Kansas,2011-05-24 13:43:00,1463,"Steve, Thanks for the info. I know exactly where the shortcut is we use it every year. I see you are going back in a couple of weeks. We are going to be at Lac Seul Lodge the week of 6/11-6/17. We will be at Black Bay Outpost. Good Luck, Mike"
1311069,wallydave,2011-05-25 08:22:00,2151,"Any reports on the levels near Ear Falls? How are the Rapids looking? Last time, 3 years ago, the water was higher than I can remember, the Rapids were just about invisible! Thanks and good trips to all!"
1311105,Knoxabilly,2011-05-25 09:25:00,225,Are you talking about in the Sanctuary cause that is closed for awhile. You can't get into what now? June?
