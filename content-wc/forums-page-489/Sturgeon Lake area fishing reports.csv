1311458,JJJ4,2011-05-26 07:58:00,16,Any fishing reports from opening week in the Sturgeon Lake area (north of Ignace)? We will be leaving Wisconsin tomorrow morning for Sturgeon. Can't wait!
1312010,JJJMN,2011-05-27 17:54:00,153,"Just got back from Sturgeon Lake. Fishing was fantanstic. We had 4 of the best walleye fishing day's weve ever had out of 5 day's on the water. Northerns were big and everywhere. I had 18.5lb, 16, 11 and several around 10. Walleye were in the 16 to 23in range with a few larger. We only take a few for shore lunch. Exchange Rate: If your buying gas, bait or anything in Canada. Stop and get a fair exchange before passing into Canada. Verns' Bait**&&@@##$$ in Ignase. There in new location, maybe new owner? Buy your Leaches elsewhere. We ended up paying $50 US for a lb of leaches. Exchange rate 1.15 us to 1.00 Canadian then 7% fee for using US. Lucky or camp has plenty of minnow's. 11 hour drive back to Twin Cities. I'll post more later."

Move around a little to find big females they werent to far away from the males. I agree with you about Verns service was slow and exchange was a rip off. We stopped at Silver Dollar on the way home next year we are getting our minnows and beer from him. The store in Ignace had a very slim selection of beer. Great trip cant wait till next year."

My bank charges a 1% fee to get cash from an ATM. Another option is to check with your credit card companies. Some charge additional fees for using your credit card others don't. (....had a few businesses ""try"" to charge additional fees for using a US credit card, I just pay in CAN funds or move on to the next business if it seems a little excessive.) Happy Fishin' Walley"
1312615,stillangling,2011-05-30 08:01:00,149,"Sorry about the experience with the exchange...seems strange that people would not be anxious to please in the current economic environment. I don't believe that your experience with the new owners of Verns will be typical of what you can expect this summer. Jon Rousseau recently sold Vern's Bait so do not be surprised if the experience will be different. Personally I have nothing but good things to say about Jon. Jon now operates Rousseau's Landing (fishing and hunting lodge just north of Ignace). Have not been there personally but I have no doubt that it will be a well run operation with access to some of the best fishing in NW Ontario.For those of you travelling to Sturgeon Lake and do not want to drive for hours with bait, I would suggest trying Steve Bauzin at Moose Creek Camp on highway 599 at the south end of Sturgeon Lake. Steve runs a commercial bait operation as well as the camp. Steve is located about a mile north of Silver Dollar."
