Another poster mentioned they have changed the ""opening day"" for the Sanctuary to June 15th. Any confirmation on the date? We are leaving in one week from today, so we would miss the June 1st date any way, with the trip this close you might say the juices are flowing! Thanks! Have a great season!"
1311847,Guest,2011-05-27 08:28:00,0,I'm fairly conficent the Sanctuary doesn't open until June 15th. We have fished this area of Lac Suel for many years during the 1st week of June and the Sanctuary has been closed. We moved our trip back a week this year for other reasons and will be staying at Gold Pines during the week of June 11-18. Good luck!

1311891,chock,2011-05-27 10:18:00,19,the last 4 years we have been going the same time in June around the second full week. The sanctuary has always opened while we were there. So I think the 15th sounds right.

1311939,wallydave,2011-05-27 13:07:00,2151,"KT, that makes it official! No Rapids this trip! Our last trip was in mid-June, so we were able to hit the Rapids. That year it was an early ice-out/spawn, plus the water level was the highest we had ever seen. Honestly we did not have much luck at the Rapids that year anyway. Sawmill and any windy point produced well for us! Part of the attraction to the Rapids was the sound of the rushing water, plus we always had good luck there! On to others spots!"
1311945,KTroller,2011-05-27 13:13:00,237,"We're going a week earlier this year so no Sanctuary for us either. Hasn't been nearly as good the last few years, so no big deal to us. It is a pretty place to fish though. I snapped a picture a couple of years ago in there with two bald eagles atop two trees under a double rainbow."
1311956,wallydave,2011-05-27 13:39:00,2151,"Great memories of fishing there! Loons swimming by, diving down for minnows, watching a guy from our group, bring in a 36in pike that clamped down on a small walleye. A kid from another group catch a 30in pike on a Gummy worm! Bears watching from the shore line. New spots will make new memories!"
