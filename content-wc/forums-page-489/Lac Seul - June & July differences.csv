1310616,Mike Kansas,2011-05-24 06:50:00,1463,"By Mid July the majority of the Eyes should be in deeper water. According to some other recent posts the spawn is over which would be a early completion for the spawn. The eyes normal pattern is to move out of the spawning areas after spawn and start spending time on mid lake humps and deeper structure. This doesnt mean that there are not plenty of fish in 6' to 12' water so hit those areas too. Look for long rocky points with up to 20' water and if you can find some sunken islands or mid lake humps fish them slow and methodical. Jig/Minnow is still a great bait and make sure you fish with just enough weight to allow you to get to the bottom. Crawlers on a jig can be deadly and crawlers on a bottom bouncer can allow you to cover a lot of deeper water and can be the go to presentation. When bottom bouncing we like to cover the edges of the sunken structure and work to the shallow water. When you hit some fish with the BB we like to stop and jig. When fishing the sunken structure pay attention to wind direction. The fish have a tendency to hold on the upwind part of the structure but can be anywhere on it. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"

1311487,Mike Kansas,2011-05-26 09:28:00,1463,"My experience on Lac Seul has been that 1oz or 1 1/2oz are adequate. In June shallow fishing we have even used 1/2 oz as we move to water up to 20+ in July the 1 or 1 1/2 become prevalant. Have had good luck with BB and a stick bait 4' to 6' back. Also like to put a crawler on the front hook with this presentation. Big fish love this one. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1311610,fishman10,2011-05-26 14:44:00,226,"i usually use a 2 ounce bb as we are usually fishing 3 to the boat and when backtrolling, my line is straight down and we dont have any tangles."
