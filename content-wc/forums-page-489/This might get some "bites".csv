My vote is for Lac Seul, Ear Falls area. Been there plenty of times, late May to mid June, low and high water. plenty of walleye, of all sizes.30 in, two 29.5's back to back!"
1311203,Guest,2011-05-25 14:34:00,0,Lake St. Joe around pickle lake. Many nice walleyes
1311211,Pikeslayer8,2011-05-25 15:17:00,1460,"I'm going back to WABAKIMI 2 weeks, can't touch WallyDave's numbers though."
1311216,Walleye_Wrangler,2011-05-25 15:28:00,138,"Wallydave, You got the right lake just the wrong end."
1311239,wallydave,2011-05-25 16:30:00,2151,"Well I guess this lake is big enough for the both of us! I will ""release"" any comments about wrong ends! Still stirin it up!"
1311244,WalleyeWally28,2011-05-25 16:42:00,298,Lac Seul!! My Wife and I have fished the NW and SW sections 17 weeks in the last 14 years. Many 100 walleye days and always plenty of 25 - 28 inchers. Never fished the SE or NE sections but have heard it's at least as good.
1311328,eyemike,2011-05-25 20:23:00,233,"Lake Onaman, near Jelico Ontario. Lots of walleyes and the average size is big. The northern are also plentiful and big!"
1311397,Guest,2011-05-26 05:35:00,0,"My vote would be Eagle Lake, have allways caught plenty of nice ""EYES"" largest I've seen caught is 15 lbs. There is also a real nice ""Wilderness"" lake that produces big numbers of nice ones."
1311492,Mike Kansas,2011-05-26 09:33:00,1463,"During the last 25 years we have fished all four corners of Lac Seul and the center of the lake. I would say that the lake has great fishing all over and really don't think that one area has any great advantage. The most important thing might well be the Lodge you choose. The fishing is all good so find a place that meets your expectations and you can enjoy your time off the water at. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
