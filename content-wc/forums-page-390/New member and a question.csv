1544116,MrSimon,2013-02-27 12:42:00,922,"You seem to know a lot about Ontario laws and land rights .... I won't question you there and I appreciate and respect your input. If the lodge owner was giving us bad information, then shame on him .... and shame on us for not doing our own research .... although at the time (20 years ago), the internet didn't exist and I was only 16 years old. The lodge owner was essentially the only authority we had available to us. If you want to pull in your friends from the MNR to debate the legality of what I did as a 16 year old kid, at the instruction of a lodge owner, two decades ago, we can certainly take that discussion into PMs. Although I think we all have better things to do with our time. If you still want to label me as a law breaking poor representative of American fishermen, then at least get to know me first. As is usually the case with similar internet bantering, both parties are viewing each other through filters of assumption and misinformation. Lets spend a day fishing together and see how we feel then .... I imagine we would both be pleasantly surprised with the outcome"
1544121,MrSimon,2013-02-27 12:54:00,922,"Can you please be specific as to what you mean by ""this type of disrespect for Canadian crown land""? To avoid any future assumptions, name calling, generalizations, and accusations, let me be perfectly clear about how we used the two vehicles posted above.We legally towed the vehicles from Ohio to Ontario and parked the RV legally at a lodge.The lodge owner gave us a map of the lakes he had permission to fish.He marked a few lakes on the map that were particularly good, but that he didn't have boats on.He gave us a chainsaw and said to cut up any trees that had fallen across the logging and access roads during the winter.We drove down the logging roads and had to cut up two trees that had fallen across the road.We turned off the logging road on to a rough two track path and followed it to the end.We then drug our boat through the woods for about 300 yards to reach the shore.We fished all day releasing everything we caught.We did everything in reverse to get back to the lodge. Now, if that is considered abusing and disrespecting Crown Land ... and casting a shadow over the tourist industry .... then I sincerely apologize."
1544143,Skywagon,2013-02-27 13:25:00,1106,"Glad to hear that was ancient history, times are changing, what was once accepted is no longer. The fact that things have changed is a good thing. Ontario has brought it's limits down to a more sustainable level, slot sizes as well as the fact that people are becoming aware of not keeping the big fish are all helping out the cause. Glad we got that one figured out, I did not want people to have the impression that they could come in and cut into lakes at will, there are good reasons for this. There are plenty of lakes that can be accessed without need for chainsaws. Happy fishing this summer."
1544162,Blue Lk,2013-02-27 14:07:00,269,"Mr Simon,Imho,this is different than your ""anything is possible"" post."
1544165,MrSimon,2013-02-27 14:24:00,922,"Which is exactly why people should get some clarification before jumping to conclusions. I recognize that a statement like ""anything is possible"" can be taken to mean many different things. I suppose a better statement would have been, ""while staying within the regulations outlined in Ontario laws, there are many possible ways to access remote waters, potentially including the lake in question."" But its the internet .... nobody talks that way .... and we end up with what we have here .... failure to communicate. As I stated before, its always good practice to fill in the blanks before throwing out some nasty accusations. Sorry for the derailment ....."
1544175,Fishoil,2013-02-27 14:47:00,1277,"If you're looking for Wabishkok Lake near Flin Flon, MB try searching for it online. It appears that it is accessable and has even produced some master angler award fish as recently as 2010 from the little bit of searching that I did."
1544246,JBwvu,2013-02-27 17:11:00,18,I guess I didn't see that in any of these posts. Seems to me somebody is making a mountain out of a molehill.
1544289,kjames,2013-02-27 19:03:00,40,"Wow....well I will say this I never intend to go sawing down trees or trashing the place. I want to be able to come back. I am just looking for confirmation It's possible even with lots of effort to get a boat back there. these guys used to do it but stopped going because the road was tore out. My view of where there is a will there is a way, there normally is but then there is the impossible, 2009 was the last year they went and that was when the road was there and am told it was tough to get down then. So on the flip side that means there shouldn't be huge truck ruts and such. I am just looking for insight from someone who has been down it in the last year or so that can tell me a quad is capable. No huge ravines that would make it impossible. Sent from my HTC Sensation 4G using Tapatalk 2"
1543059,kjames,2013-02-25 13:11:00,40,So I am a minnow! I love these forms and belong to too many to keep up with. You guys have allot of knowledge which is how I stumbled across this site looking to learn a thing or two. I have never been to Canada but some guys at work used to fish wabishkok for 16 years in a row. They have not been in the last three because the road is out. Seeing their pictures and hearing their stories I want to go horribly bad. I find myself thinking about the trip and adventure to often to admit. They tell me If I can find a way to get us back to the water they will go. So I am looking for advice from someone that has been there since they tore out the logging road. They don't seem to entertain they idea of going to a different lake and they camp on what they call Arkansas island. Does any one have any insight. Also I was told to try to get a hold of Mitch and tell him It's the dam Americans? Lol Sent from my HTC Sensation 4G using Tapatalk 2
1543125,MrSimon,2013-02-25 14:44:00,922,"You could most likely get in with four wheelers, but that's a big hassle and maybe not even legal. They seriously won't consider a different place? That's weird. Since planning the trip is a big part of the fun, you should take it on your self to research and plan a nice trip .... I'm sure they would go with you. Figure out their criteria and post it here .... you'll get tons of suggestions."
1543827,phishfearme,2013-02-26 19:36:00,1242,"assuming this lake is in Ontario, is on crown land and used to be accessible via road - you may be able to get a nearby licensed Ontario outfitter to place boats/motors/tents on the lake for you then take you in via 4 wheel or airplane. but if the boats are there for more than a certain amount of time the outfitter would need a Land Use Permit LUP from the ministry. similarly with a cabin, the outfitter would need an LUP for it. you'd probably have to pay for hauling the gear both in and out. or you probably could do it yourself, even as a US citizen, by paying the daily crown land use fee for non-residents. that means you'd have to get everything in and out yourselves. not a pleasant option. you may want to check around as there may already be a cabin or boat cache LUP there. then your options are clear. tell your buds that there's TONS of better and easier options. phish"
1543876,kjames,2013-02-26 21:21:00,40,"Well that is just it they do it for the adventure. So if it is tuff that's what its about but they used to be able to take a truck eight miles down that road now I. just need to know if its possible to make it with quads pulling boat, I.e. how bad are the ravines and swamp areas.

1543943,MrSimon,2013-02-27 06:43:00,922,"Anything is possible. Two good quads, a light weight boat and motor, and some creative thinking will get you just about anywhere in Ontario. A good 4x4 truck and a chainsaw can also be really really effective. We've used both of these set-ups to get REALLY far back into the bush in Ontario. We pulled them behind an RV to get up to a lodge we used as a base camp, then used the 4x4s to head back logging roads, two tracks, and even straight bushwhacking. You want adventure?! Give this a try!!!!"
1543994,kjames,2013-02-27 08:16:00,40,"That's what I'm talking about! I thought of a makeshift ladder rack on a quad boat bolted to rack, rack bolted to frame but could be to top heavy lol, I like your ambition, like you I think where there is a will there is a waySent from my HTC Sensation 4G using Tapatalk 2"
1544011,Skywagon,2013-02-27 08:59:00,1106,"MrSimon, I am sure the MNR would love to see Americans using chain saws/cutting trees on Crown land in Ontario. It is a privilge to be a guest in Canada, what you are suggesting (blazing trails/or cutting trees for that matter) is not part of that privilge or legal. I wonder how the US National Park System (or Americans) would feel if some Canadians came down and did the same thing there? This type of activity by a few people, tends to paint all Americans with a broad brush (which is not fair), the little money you as a law breaker spends in Canada, does do not give you carte blanche to do as you choose. And yes, you did hit a nerve."
1544022,MrSimon,2013-02-27 09:12:00,922,"Whoah there cowboy. What we did was not on crown land. It was on land under use by a specific lodge who gave us permission to work our way back into lakes that they were granted access to. Its the same thing as lodge owners bushwhacking into lakes to build outposts or stash boats .... its all legal, and a heck of a lot of fun. Please don't make accusations based on assumptions and a tiny bit of information. Before labeling someone as a law breaker and a poor representative of Americans, please take the time to confirm the facts. Its better for everyone. The original poster asked for suggestions on how to have an adventure in Canada. I gave him some suggestions. Its completely up to him to research and identify what would or wouldn't be legal in the area he intends to visit. Sorry for the seriousness of this post .... but I don't like being called a law breaker or a bad American. YOU hit a nerve."
1544088,Skywagon,2013-02-27 11:44:00,1106,"MrSimon, If you were in Ontario and not on privately owned ground, then it is Crown owned land, period. The camp owner may have been granted a designated hunting area, but it is Crown land. If the camp owner gave you permission to blaze trails, then he was in the wrong. If you question this, give me the name of the camp and the lakes you blazed your way into. I know people at the MNR and will be happy to talk to them, then I will let you know what I find out."
1544111,Blue Lk,2013-02-27 12:23:00,269,"Well said Skywagon,it is this type of disrespect for Canadian crown land by a very small minority that casts a shadow over the tourist industry.I would hope local residents would report this abuse in a heartbeat,I know I would."
