I've read the website and emailed the owner, but there is nothing like getting a first hand review from an actual customer. Shoot me a PM if you want. Thanks."

I can answer questions about Lac Remigny and parts of Lac Des Quince, where we had great fishing, primarily for pike plus some walleye and smallies, but don't know much about the Rock Lake outpost. I think Glen was finishing up construction of a hot shower building at RL when he died there closing the camp in fall of '06. You definitely take a gravel road out of Remigny to get there. I don't know who owns the camp since Glen's sister sold it around '08. I plan to return to Lac Remigny some day, staying at Ronoda or the other camp that's a few miles further from Ronoda that looks nice."

The new owners do a great job lots of improvments and renovations. If you ever get up there try some of the other lakes there is about 17 different lakes in same area straching from 5 to 75 miles in lenght. We like the area since threre is so much water and not many people fishing hardly any pressuere. The new owners do ice fishing trips we did it twice and it was a blast some of the remote lakes we have not seean any one the stay at some of this lakes. You are allowed 5 tip ups per person we did not have time to run between them. Planing our next trip up there for 2013 spring. If you need more info let us know.
