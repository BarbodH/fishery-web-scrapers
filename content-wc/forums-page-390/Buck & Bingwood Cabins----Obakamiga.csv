I'm planning a trip for July/August and will be taking a first-timer (our retiring minister) to Canada. Usually head up Nakina way but may not have the time this year for the extra drive. Each year upon our return he asks for details of our (My adult son & me) trip which we gladly share. We fish hard and our normal week usually yields 600-700 walleyes for the two of us. Some days 50, some days 150. Does anyone know if these kinds of numbers are possible on this lake or do I bite the bullet and make the Nakina trek. Also would be interested in size. Thanks very much for any info. MRoyle"

1545156,mroyle,2013-03-01 12:57:00,74,Thanks Walley Wrangler....what kind of numbers did you typically get?
1545184,adempsey,2013-03-01 13:14:00,963,"My experiences at every remote lodge I've been to in July/August are nothing like 100 fish per day. Sure, there are days you can get that, but that's not every day or even every trip.If 100 fish per day is that important then I'd just stick to your previous outfitter.Although, I seriously doubt your guest will complain about spending a week on Buck Lake. Heading up there myself for the first time in July."
1545246,mroyle,2013-03-01 14:24:00,74,"adempsey-- Yeah, 100 fish days per person have been few and far between. Thye 600-700 fish per week I mentioned was for the two of us, so an average of about 50 each/day. Have a good trip, enjoy!"
1545356,Walleye_Wrangler,2013-03-01 19:59:00,138,"I would say in 25 to 30 is more realistic. One nice thing is the perch! We would spend a day perch fishing and catch all the 13"" perch you want. It was nice for bringing fish home. 2 or 3 bays down from camp was weedy and full of walleye, perch and pike. It was a lot of fun."
1545409,adempsey,2013-03-01 23:40:00,963,Those are the numbers I've experienced on most lodge lakes. The perch fishing was definitely an attractive bonus for us and part of why we decided to try it out. Did you stay at Buck or Bingwood?
1545432,Skywagon,2013-03-02 05:23:00,1106,You are going to ruin the illusion. I thought we locals were the only ones that did not catch 100 fish every day.
1545696,Walleye_Wrangler,2013-03-02 17:24:00,138,We always stayed @ Buck
