1542658,rdunk,2013-02-24 15:19:00,20,Looking to take our own boat either to the Lake of the Woods or in Ontario someplace. Any help on a good place to go. First time with our own boat.We are basically looking for lodging with access for our boat. We've always went the housekeeping route so a place to stay and we do the cooking.

There are so many options on Lake of the Woods for you to bring your own boat to. What area of the Lake would you like to fish out of, what style of fishing do you prefer.... I've been going to the same place for several years, and last year took my own boat for the first time. We stay at an ""Outpost"" - 5 star all inclusive American Plan resort about an hour boat ride from Sioux Narrows and we really enjoy the great walleye fishing, good smallies, and decent pike. The muskie fishing is also very good. Give us more details and I'm sure we can all pitch in with advice on places and options. Lake of the Woods is a great place!"
1542680,MarkMark,2013-02-24 16:05:00,7,Just came back from ice fishing Sunset Lodge on Lake of the Woods. They have reopened and completely remodeled. Very nice and the fishing was great. I suggest checking them out. nice thing about their place for me is that its surrounded by islands...takes the wind out of the picture on such a big lake and gives you lots of structure to fish. I thought they were very reasonable and the food was good as well.

1543138,Obabikon,2013-02-25 15:13:00,2370,Tamarak is an island camp on LOTW that would fit Mylie's Place and BuenaViesta are mainland camps. All out of Morson... Awesome fishing.
1543884,Tamarack,2013-02-26 21:52:00,16,"Obabikon does some housekeeping as well, don't toot your own horn J. You could also try Toltens and my good friends at Grassy Narrows Lodge. Can't beat Morson! One thing obout us is we have electricity down at the dock and keep our generator on 24 hour a day."
1543965,Shorelunch,2013-02-27 07:18:00,554,"Out of Morson, I think these are the best bets (have had experiences with all three). Being about a 15 minute boat ride out of Morson, Obabikon offers the ""whole package"" with great scenery and location. Mylies and BV are on land."
1543998,1700SS,2013-02-27 08:25:00,104,Red Wing Lodge for housekeeping also. Located on mainland Morson.
1544077,Danbear,2013-02-27 11:03:00,72,"Check out Birch Dale Lodge on Eagle lake, I take my own boat every year, they have there own boat ramp, they have gas and bait at the dock and give you a break on the price if you bring your own boat, they have house keeping and american plans. My fishing crew love the place and the owner Marcel will take good care of you. They also have a steak house and bar at the resort and a camp fish fry one night during the week for all the guests. This will be our 6th year going to Birch Dale and we have been extremely happy there, to us it's like going to our 2nd home."
1544129,Lazy Fisherman,2013-02-27 13:03:00,276,"Sioux Narrows on Lake of the Woods has several drive to camps that you could take your boat to. Also, that area has some good fishing."
