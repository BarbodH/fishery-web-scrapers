1542359,Davis Viehbeck,2013-02-23 18:40:00,48,How many of you generally hire a guide while in Canada?
1542388,Glenman12,2013-02-23 19:58:00,762,"not sure what area you are talking about...but, Ive been going to the same lake for over 30 yrs so no, I dont need a guide...if I was going to a lake I never fished before and it wasnt too big I still woulndt use a guide..but. if I was going to Lac Suel, Eagle Lake etc I definitely would use a guide at least for the first day..with the money we spend on trips to Canada nowadays dont want to be burning days trying to learn where the fish are.."
1542506,Bigstorm,2013-02-24 08:08:00,799,"If I was going to a new lake and there was no topo map available, I would probably hire a guide for 1 day. I have been going to the same place for almost 10 years, and my 1st year there was with others that new the lakes so there was no need. I am trying a new place for my 2nd trip this year, going to Rainy Lake but there are maps and chips available so we dont plan on hiring a guide"

You not only learn the lake but get some excellent education about baits, presentations, equipment etc. If you have experience then likley the lodge you stay at can put you on fish. I've only used one once because he came with the package. Found it wasn't my thing as I like to controll my own boat and do my own shore lunches. Others would feel differently."
1542720,muskyman73,2013-02-24 17:47:00,402,"Been going to LOTW for years now. Never hired a guide. Heck we dont even use livebait, ever. I think you can pattern fish quite easily by watching water temperature and weed growth."
1542907,MrSimon,2013-02-25 08:25:00,922,"It depends on the guide. Some guides are worth their weight in gold .... they actually TEACH you things so you can go out on your own and repeat the process. They share good information with you about patterns, fish movement, and the little idiosyncrasies of that particular lake. Other guides just drive you out to a spot and tell you to drop a jig over the side. They don't tell you WHY that particular spot is any good. Some guides won't let you bait your own hook or land your own fish ... I don't care how many fish I catch, that wouldn't suit me. It seems that younger guides are better than older guides (not always though). The younger ones seem to have more passion and care more about doing a good job and making clients happy. The older ones often seem cranky and only care about getting paid. I could be wrong, but those are my observations."
