1544548,tooski,2013-02-28 10:30:00,393,O'Sullivan is about 40 miles northwest of Longlac.
1540707,Fishoil,2013-02-20 09:19:00,1277,"No, but you can get there by boat from Long Lake. It's north of town. Did you know that the river there can flow north OR south? It depends on whether the dam is open or closed."
1541597,MrSimon,2013-02-22 08:07:00,922,Anyone ever stay at http://www.northernwoodslodge.com/ Its at the south end of Long Lake and looks like a really nice place. I like that they have brook trout fishing too.
1543395,andreej,2013-02-26 06:48:00,248,"No, but I have driven by it (at least the turnoff for it) numerous times while heading home from Longlac on the logging road to Terrace Bay. Incredibly beautiful area! I've always thought it might be fun to try it sometime. Seems far enough from any town that you wouldn't get much fishing pressure from the locals. Looks nice on the website - was hoping to see a few more big northern pictures though."
1543436,Hillbiehle,2013-02-26 07:46:00,66,"It's funny to see this. My stepfather for years (now 80) told stories (many times the same stories over and over) about fishing on Longlac and O'Sullivan and a few lakes in between. His stories were rather vivid in detail as he never forgot too much (he now has early stages of dimentia); unfortuantley he can't remember the names of the rest of the lakes they fished. Last night I opended up a map that was from his tackle box that he gave me years ago that is from the 50's or 60's. For some reason, I never noticed until now that the map had various lakes with small ""stars"" on different points on different lakes. At the bottom was hand written the names of lakes and various species of fish. I called him last night and asked if he rememebered the name of the camp that he stayed at. Unfortunatley he didn't remember but he said for years they camped on O'Sullivan. One year on their way to O'Sullivan they had car trouble and pulled over and stayed off the highway in/on Longlac. They liked the people there so much that they ended up going there from that time forward (it had cottages and a bait shop and located next to the road by the bridge). They became very good freinds and the owners would stay in Ohio with them every couple of years. He said the son who helped run the place was a few years younger than him at the time and has since moved to Florida. That's all that I know about the camp. But he tells stories of boating to the dam and fishing as close to the dam as they could (it was marked off with buoys) and catching walleye, northern and perch. If there was a way, I'd love to take him back there fishing just one more time. If anyone has additional information I'd appreciate hearing."
1543519,andreej,2013-02-26 09:41:00,248,"Hillbiehle - thanks for sharing your story! My grandfather started going to the Longlac area some 50 years ago and he's the one responsible for getting me and my brother (and our kids) hooked on the area now! I believe that this is probably where your stepfather would have stayed http://www.longlaclodge.ca/Home.aspx It is indeed right off the highway and right by the bridge. I don't think they sell bait anymore but they certainly used to. I have no idea if the current owners have any ties to the people he would have known but it certainly would be neat if you could get him up there one more time! Even if he can't make it, you should try and make a trip some year - after all you've got a map full of fishing hotspots!!"
1543573,MrSimon,2013-02-26 11:02:00,922,"Awesome stuff. My grandfather started taking us to Klotz lake almost 25 years ago, which is just a bit East of Longlac. We used to drive into Longlac for supplies. He is 85 now and I'm taking him this year back up to Canada .... final trip most likely. If you can get your grandfather back up there .... do it!!"
1543846,nwont,2013-02-26 20:09:00,16,"You might be talking about the Skinner Family. A couple of them live in the states now, but Tim Skinner is still running the bait shop in the summer, I believe he lives in Florida in the winter. There are cabins across the road that I believe they used to own, sold them a few years ago. They are about a block south of the highway along the lake."
1544021,Hillbiehle,2013-02-27 09:12:00,66,"Thank you for sending me the link to the resort! I forwarded on to my stepfather and he confirmed that it is the same resort. After he got over the realization of progress and how quickly time passes; based on the pictures, he began tell a few more stories and pointed out the things that have changed since the 50's and 60's. He was able to remember the name of the person that moved to Florida; it was Glenn Ball or Glenn Bahl (or has he pronounces (GA-len Ball). He mentioned that if he would ever be able to go back, that he'd prefer to go O'Sullivan or some of the remote lakes (which he wishes he could remember), as the resort appears to be a bit busier than back in the day. One in particular that he has fond memeriors of (north of Long lac), was taking the boat off the camper and putting it in a creek alongside the road which eventually opened up to a lake where they did very well fishing. I imagine that there are several dozen lakes like this but it's neat to wonder which lake he remembers. Looking at his map it's hard to distinguish which lakes that he actually fished or were simply marked up by the resort owner in case they ever fished. Thanks again for helping me trigger some memories. I do appreciate."
1544041,Fishoil,2013-02-27 09:52:00,1277,Burrows Lake maybe??
1544529,andreej,2013-02-28 09:52:00,248,Where is O'Sullivan lake??
1532278,andreej,2013-02-01 23:19:00,248,"Found a few posts but they are all at least 3 years old. Just curious if anyone on here fishes this area at all. My grandfather started going to McKay 50 years ago - eventually brought us grandkids, and now my brother and I and families get up there at least once a year. With it being 10 below outside I thought it would be fun to find others who fish the area and exchange stories and hotspots!!"
1532336,Fishoil,2013-02-02 08:03:00,1277,"You probably found some of my posts on the Longlac area from way back. I haven't been back there since '97 but I intend to change that within the next few years. I've never fished McKay and had to look at a map to figure out where it is. I always stayed at Lukinto Lake which is north of 17, about where you turn south to head to McKay. Does the camp you go to have a website? The only thing I could find was Foggy Mountain and it looked outdated??"
1532384,lenray,2013-02-02 10:09:00,467,I have fished McKay-----There isn't a camp there. I have seen ads where a fella claims he has a camp on McKay. There is a camp way up one of the rivers that runs into McKay or out of McKay. It is a stretch to say there is a camp there. It is close to home for me--580 miles one way so we use it for short weekend trips.
1532420,andreej,2013-02-02 11:37:00,248,"Ya, no camp on McKay - we camp on one of the islands in the south channel. The landing is on the far west side of the lake - take the logging road south out of town and the turn off is about 15 miles or so. I've driven by Lukinto quite a bit, a good friend of ours that lives up there has a ""camp"" on Chipman Lake. How is (was) Lukinto? What other lakes in the area do you fish. Chipman is a great walleye lake but pretty exposed to north winds! in the spring the fish pile up in the river on the southwest part of the lake. summer can be a bit more challenging but having a local for a guide we usually find them. He likes to fish pretty deep in summer, at least deeper than most people I know fish walleye."
1532423,Fishoil,2013-02-02 11:46:00,1277,"We never fished Lukinto much although we did catch some splake and a few big walleyes there. Chipman is one of my favorites. It can be fantastic where the Kenogomi comes in and where it exits out of Little Chipman into Ogahalla. Jobrin is just north of Chipman and is a good time. Fernow, which is east of Chipman a ways is one of my favorites. It has great fishing for walleyes, northerns, and trout. I know what you mean about fishing deep, we sometimes did really well in 50+ feet for walleyes in May already."
1532450,3M TA3,2013-02-02 13:53:00,2846,"Place I used to fish up till about 5 or 6 years ago was about 35 miles east of Longlac, just south of Klotz Lake. The lake that I have had great fun on was called Kissigamini and it had tons of Walleye and nice Perch, And I mean tons. Don't remember the name of the cabins but they were on the south side of Klotz Lake on the south side of Highway 11. Mike and Tina were the names of the owners. Anyway, Klotz was alright but Kissigamini was a blast."
1539444,andreej,2013-02-17 22:14:00,248,"Cool, I will have to check out Kissigamini on one of these trips! there's sooo many lakes, it's hard to choose one without some inside knowledge!! Anyone ever fish McLeod just south of McKay??"
1540375,luv2fishwalleye,2013-02-19 17:59:00,4,"i've fished Chipman, Fernow, Burrows, both Jorbins, the log dump and a couple others around longlac. Every lake had abundant walleye and pike and some real bigs one from time to time. Love the area, just wish it was a little closer, but then i'm sure it wouldn't be as good if it was"
1540537,andreej,2013-02-19 23:18:00,248,"is the ""log dump"" Long Lake??!!!"
1540543,Da' Walleye Assassun,2013-02-20 00:04:00,358,"is the ""log dump"" Long Lake??!!! The outhouse is the REAL log dump."
