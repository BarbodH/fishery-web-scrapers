1498578,cziggs,2012-10-25 18:23:00,7,I have been considering a change from our traditional Canadian lodge that we normally go to. What lake in the Flin Flon area would you recommend for trophy walleyes. Love the pictures!
1498663,Bill Krejca,2012-10-26 06:03:00,6107,"I have fished Tramping Lake near Snow Lake a number of times. There are some huge walleyes in there, 5 out of 8 of our group got Master angler size(28"" or over) on one trip. It has not been a numbers lake for us, but there are some dandies in there. 22"" or over have to be released. Bill Krejca"
1498831,mrwalleye5,2012-10-26 14:11:00,1922,"I have a couple of friends that have gone up to Tramping lake since the mid 90""s and the fishing for big walleye just seems to get better and better. Here is a peek at some of the Master Angler Awards they have submitted but have not done everyone.http://www.travelmanitoba.com/master...earch&angler=1http://www.travelmanitoba.com/master...earch&angler=1"
1544044,kjames,2013-02-27 09:58:00,40,"Hey Bigfishhunter, I have posted a few inquires on here about access to Wabishkok. I thought I pm you but evidently didn't hit send or something. How bad is the old logging road? Would it be to tough to pull a boat and trailer with a quad? I am also supposed to ask about access to Lake Amy. Any advice is well appreciated and respected. I myself have never been to Canada and I am trying to get these experienced guys to go they say if I can find a way to the lake the will. They are wanting Wabishkok as their first option and then maybe a near by lake if it is not possible to get in. They fished that lake for 16 yrs in a row and dont really want to stray. Thank You for any info you can give"
1471665,Bigfishhunter,2012-08-07 09:12:00,803,"Just thought I would update this. I've been fishing lot's and doing pretty well. I have some nice bass pics too, but thought I would share these from last week. We had a day that was pretty special. We put 4 in the boat that were over 40"" and a bunch that went from 35-38, as well as many, many in the 30-34"" range."
1472188,Campcountry,2012-08-08 09:02:00,164,"Beauties! It has been a long time since I was up at Athapap. What a great area! Time was when you would look at the list of Master Angler Awards and they would be completely and totally dominated for pike, walleye, lake trout - all from Athapapuskow. Glad to see it heading back in that direction."
1472215,Bigfishhunter,2012-08-08 09:52:00,803,"Here are some bass from a lake called Rocky lake by the Pas. There is also decent walleye fishing and pike fishing in that lake, but I can't get away from the rock piles where these guys live when I go there."
1472277,KEEBOY,2012-08-08 12:20:00,61,We have been going to Lake Kississing since 1990 and always have a great trip. It is a long haul from Iowa but well worth every mile. The fishing just seems to be getting better and better every year. The walleye and northern sizes seems to be getting bigger and the lake trout are just big to begin with. We always seem to catch a few Master Anglers and never any shortage of fish catching. We always comment on how nice it would be to have that kind of fishing right in your back yard. Thanks for posting. I am always interested in posts about N. Manitoba.
1472302,Bigfishhunter,2012-08-08 12:55:00,803,"My best friend manages Kississing Lake Lodge, and likes to head out in the evening right behind the lodge for some trout. He got this 40"" the other night."
1472323,KEEBOY,2012-08-08 13:33:00,61,Nice fish. There are some real pigs in there. We go up the first week of June and do really well. I have heard that it can be really good in late summer in that area. I would love to go up there and fish them when they are more schooled up in that area of the lake.
1472326,Bigfishhunter,2012-08-08 13:46:00,803,"everybody is he!! bent on coming in june because they think that the fishing is better. And while it probably is better for numbers of fish, the best time to hook up with pigs (both northern and trout) is without a doubt from the middle of July onward. Actually the lodge keeps records and the majority of their big fish come after August 10. And actually the biggest fish of the year seem to come at that time as well. I find this to be true with all of our lakes around here. Everyone fishes in June and slows their fishing down in the mid summer months, where I find the fishing just gets better. You just have to change things up a bit."
1472337,KEEBOY,2012-08-08 14:17:00,61,Thats interesting to know. We do catch good numbers of fish and we do catch some big fish also. Some years the big lakers are cooperating and other years northern. The walleye seem to be good every year. We may not get good numbers of lake trout in early June but the ones we do catch are usually good ones.
1498471,Bearing Man,2012-10-25 13:07:00,30,"I fished 2 years ago with Kitchi Island Outposts, Longish Lakes Outpost. We were supposed to go to the main lake, Kitchi but lost a couple of guys so we went with only 2 of us and Duncan switched us to the smaller lake/cabin.The fishing was very mediocre. Shallow lake, very narrow and small. We did not have live bait and caught only walleyes with rubber, etc. We knew going in that northerns were not prominent in that lake - not big enough I don't think.Service was good, cabin was fine. But too far, too expensive for the quality of the fishing in my opinion. Not picking on the outfitter and I certainly don't want to impact his business - it could have been us.I would like to ask if any one has gone with Lawrence Bay Lodge out of Southend/Reindeer Lake? I met Randy at a show several years ago and liked him but never have tried him yet. His lakes (pics) looked good for bigger northerns."
1498490,Mike Kansas,2012-10-25 14:03:00,1463,"Fished Manitoba on many different trips. Always loved it and always caught a lot of nice fish. Lac La Ronge, Tobin, Pine Bluff, Pigeon River, LBZ and the Red River. All of these great for Walleye and Pike. Also have fished the Red River for Catfish. I was raised fishing Catfish in Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin but I had never seen anything like the 50++ fish days of catching 15 to 25 lb Catfish on the Red River. Hats off to Manitoba fishing. Mike Kansas"
1459016,Bigfishhunter,2012-07-08 07:52:00,803,"I know a lot of you fish Ontario, but for those of you who have been to Northern Manitoba, or are thinking of coming, I just thought I would share how my summer is going so far. I live in Flin Flon, and I absolutely love the quality of the lakes that we have that have pavement right to the launch. Once you get off the road the fishing gets even better, but I like fishing out of a quality boat, and ease of access fishing. The lakes that I fish primarily are Athapapuskow (lake trout, northern, and trophy walleyes) and Amisk/Beaver Lake (Trophy pike and walleye). Here are some fish so far from this year, between me and the people in my boat."
1459019,5 of Diamonds,2012-07-08 07:59:00,151,Those are some brutes. One of these days I'll take a fish trip to Manitoba. I've got to get out of my comfort zone (Quebec)! Scenery looks great too. Thanks for the great pic's.
1459021,jiggster,2012-07-08 08:03:00,183,"I agree the fishing is fantastic in your area. I fished Kississing back in the 70s. I would love to take my son up there again. I know the area has change, any ideas for suggestions. My son has never fished Manitoba."
1459038,Bigfishhunter,2012-07-08 08:42:00,803,"I don't know what you mean by the area has changed? Do you mean fish wise, or population wise? There is probably less pressure and less people here now than in the 70's. I guided on Kississing for 10 years 1999 - 2009. The owner of Kississing Lake lodge took over in the 80's and he says that according to creel reports the fishing is better now than it has ever been. There are some excellent regulations in place that have protected our fishery. No walleyes over 20"" allowed - Limit of 4 total on a license No Pike over 30"" allowed - limit of 4 total on a license No Trout over 26"" allowed - limit of 4 total on a license."
1459106,4JawChuck,2012-07-08 10:43:00,277,Niiiice!
1459114,Larry Mac,2012-07-08 11:04:00,530,"Hi Bigfishhunter, great report and great pics. I agree the Flin Flon/The Pas areas are truly special. I need to get back up there. Thank you very much. Have a great yearThank you,Larry Mac"
1459251,jWN,2012-07-08 17:45:00,62,manitoba has always been better to me been to both many times. almost always pick manitoba. there seems to be alot less presure in manitoba which equals better fishing usally. i have had good and tough trips for both but i have sevral trips to manitoba that most pepole would not even beleave if i posted the numbers and size of fish.
1459337,jiggster,2012-07-08 21:26:00,183,"When I was talking about changes, I was referring to logging roads that furnished lake access and lake access in general."
1459342,1shooter,2012-07-08 21:46:00,1493,Nice!
1459345,Bigfishhunter,2012-07-08 21:52:00,803,"Then yes, you would be correct it is different. When logging companies pull out of an area they blast up the road and block it with metal gates. Then the only way in is with quads. lakes like Kisseynew, and Wabishkok are prime examples of this. Now guys leave boats cached and quad in to go fishing. Actually the majority of people do that, so a lot of the road access lakes receive less pressure than the ""remote"" ones."
