1544074,MOfish,2013-02-27 11:01:00,39,"Anybody else going to be at Onaway Lodge from June 14th to the 21st? My father-inlaw got a Canada fishing trip as a birthday present from my mother-inlaw. He said he wanted to take all of his sons, grandsons, and son-inlaw with him. I said OK! Anyway, all of us are really looking forward to it and are counting down the days. I haven't been to Onaway since 2008 and I love the camp and it's owners. My biggest concern is finding fish. This will be my 4th time to Lac Seul so I have some limited experience. I'll probably be considered the 'guide' for this trip and I want to make sure everyone has a good time. We'll be ready to fish for pike, walleye, and SMB. Any suggestions on which to target first?"
1544523,SinOrSwim,2013-02-28 09:47:00,1528,We don't go in June but have been the last 2 years in the fall. I'm pretty sure you will find all new cabins since the last time you were there in 08? That has to be about the time he started knocking the old ones down are rebuilding.

1544936,Steve of Madison,2013-03-01 06:56:00,230,"I had to cancel my annual trip to Onaway for 2013 due to business, but I know by July I will be regretting my decision. Since 2008 Blair and Kathy will have completed 5 or 6 new cabins. They have been on a program of taking down cabins and rebuilding new ones in their place. And they are the best around.As far as finding fish, I usually don't go up until early/mid July so my spots may not be turned on by then. But I have a couple of spots that I would try that I can tell you about. Send me a PM and I will help as much as possible."
1544964,wallydave,2013-03-01 07:57:00,2151,"My wife and I will be a bit farther North of Onaway in mid-June, Goose Bay near Ear Falls. I have been interested in a stay at Onaway for a mid-to late summer trip. Maybe one of these days! Where do you cross the Border? We will be crossing Friday night and have a pizza at Boston Pizza in Fort Frances. We are just 105 days from the magical trip North! Have a good trip!"
1546451,MOfish,2013-03-04 10:59:00,39,"Steve-I'll be in touch, Thanks for helping out Dave-We'll cross at International Falls on Friday and will probably want to get to Onaway so we'll be spending as little time as possible getting there. I'd recommend Onaway. Very nice people and accomodations."
1547956,DWingert,2013-03-07 09:03:00,21,"MOfish - we'll be going up to Onaway the first week in June. I'd be happy to relay anything we find for fishing spots.If I read everything correctly for their Lodge - they run accomodations from Friday to Friday instead of the typical Saturday to Saturday scenario. We're going up Thursday, May 31st and spending the night at International Falls - usually go to Border Pizza as a tradition."
