1541918,BornToFish,2013-02-22 18:16:00,1224,"I was fishing in North West Ontario a few years ago with my brother. I used a jaw spreader early in that trip to open the mouth of a northern pike that inhaled my Daredevle. The fish squirmed and launched my only jaw spreader into the lake. It sank like a rock. We drove to Vermillion Bay a day or two later and I bought a new jaw spreader at Bobby's. This new jaw spreader fell prey to another northern pike and was on the bottom of the lake later that same day. It too sank like a rock. We made yet another trip to Vermillion Bay just before the end of the trip. I bought another jaw spreader and this time I saw the light so I also bought a float on a key chain - like that you would use to keep your boat keys floating. Needless to say, this jaw spreader got launched into the lake on the last evening of fishing. In contrast to the two preceding jaw spreaders, this one sssssllllllloooooowwwwlllllyyyyy sank to the bottom of the bottom of the lake, just out of my reach. Now, I just tie one end of a cord to the jaw spreaders and the other end of the cord to the boat. I haven't lost one since. My boat keys now sport two floats."

We hit the first spot and all I hear from my brother was ""you lost it?"" to my dad. I turned to look and dad is looking at his line. He had put the buck tail on his lighter outfit and when he tried to slow down the throw it snapped his 8 lb line.

1527201,[email protected],2013-01-22 13:20:00,21,"This goes back to my younger years, but it was an important item I lost! Plus, another story! I used to do a lot of canoe trips mostly in Algonquin in earlier years, and later many trips in the Temagami area. Many great memories of scenery, wildlife, and solitude. LOSS...One trip, a 100 mile loop in Algonquin there were four of us in two canoes. Bugs were really bad this year, and as always they were the worst at the ends of the portages. About halfway through our trip we came off a portage and paddled quickly out onto the lake to leave the black flies behind us. I was swatting at them to get them away from my head and hit 2 month NEW prescription eye glasses, knocking them off. Unable to save them, I watched them sink in the lake! The name of the lake was ""Luckless Lake"". Lesson learned, to this day when I am in a boat I always wear a strap on them! The OTHER Story... Here's a short version...Having made many wilderness trips even in areas with unmarked and little used portages I once didn't double check my map and compass, thinking I was at the portage. Early in a 110 mile trip, we were packed fairly heavy, a lot of rain two of us with one canoe headed across the portage. I had a pack and the canoe, but I was in the lead. We came to a tree across in front of me, not being able to see far enough ahead to see where to go around, I set the canoe down. There was NO trail, as we were standing in the middle of the woods, in the rain, and no clue. It took us a grueling 4-1/2 hours to find water again. Exhausted, beat up shins, a bruised ego, and the wettest canoe trip I ever had (It rained every day and every night), we still had a great trip. It taught me to NEVER assume you know where you are at! That night, exhausted, we set camp up and discover that somewhere in the middle of this ordeal our aluminum poles for our free standing tent slid out of the pack and they were lost! We got real good putting the tent up with ropes! I never used an outfitter, always taking my own 40lb Kevlar Canoe, my own gear and food packs. A laugh did eventually come of this! The following year, I called the Ministry District office to discuss a canoe route I was looking at. I had spoke to this individual several times over the years and he was always a lot of help. I said I have a story to tell you, and gave him the full version. He laughed before we got to the end of the story because two guys out of their office did the same thing at exactly the same place. I like remote areas without signs so I did not imply one should mark the portages, but I did suggest maybe a sign should go up here that says This Is NOT The Portage! My old body just isn't up to these trips anymore so I now go in on fly in outpost camp fishing trips and enjoy them. However, I still dream of the places I have been, and the places I still wanted to get to.[email protected]"

1527273,[email protected],2013-01-22 15:07:00,21,"A few years back three of us went to a fly in outpost camp. Taking turns with each other in two different boats. We never used rod holders, but for what ever the reason, the three of us purchased the same cheap rod holders. Less than an hour in the boat the first day I placed my rod in it and was messing around in my tackle box. The other guy in the boat says ""get your rod"", and I turn to look as it is leaving the rod holder. I couldn't get it. A sinking feeling! I don't swim well so I wasn't about to go in after it. The guy with me pulled in his line and jumped in after it, but didn't come up with it. I am now sick about it. It was a brand new rod and reel! After about 15 minutes of feeling sorry for myself I though we better use the walkie talkie and call the lone guy in the second boat to tell him not to use the rod holder. He answers, I tell him, and he says ""I wish you would have called me about five minutes ago""! He lost a rod an reel that he had favored for years. Still sick about it, three days later on a very windy afternoon we are trolling. I hook a line, and as I am pulling it in I see a lure and it's my lure! I get a hold of the line pulling it in by hand...there's my rod! I am running the tiller while doing this. The wind turns the boat, the line goes under and gets cut. I got my lure, but still lost my rod and reel! Tried trolling for the other guys rod but never got it. So if we learn anything from this, at the very least DON'T use a cheap rod holder![email protected]"

LOLOLOLOL All on video and I am not sure I've ever laughed so hard. He was screaming but didn't want to let the bird go. I have lost a rod/reel. WE have lost at least one net if not more.

My brother took it home cleaned up the reel and now his son is using it. Works perfect so thank you to whoever lost that one.Have also lost some walkie talkies but not technically lost.

Got 27 incher in boat, looked back to see 2 inches of the handle above water. Its now in 20 fow. Baught new net last wk. that's now filled w great stuff spray foam. With enough casts I know I can get it back. Slushfish"

1455086,Smallmouth Hunter,2012-06-27 18:40:00,84,"Sunglasses. A very nice two way radio that was hanging on my buddies side on a clip. He went to cast and flipped it right off. We all just kinda stood there. I looked at him and said "" glad that was you and not me"". His dad just bought them and that was the first day they were ever used. Every year when we fish by that spot we still talk about it. A pair of fish grippers. Not sure that's the correct name. Like Bocca grips. Didn't put the strap on and just dropped them."
1454775,boyks,2012-06-27 08:42:00,5,"On my now annual fly-in trip - my digital camera, 3 years ago, with a pic of a 27.5 inch walleye that was the big fish that year (and since actually). Got tired of being badgered that this was a good fish story, SO brought an underwater camera this year and managed to find and hook the camera and rescue it. The SD card still worked after being removed and dried out and I was vindicated. BTW the camera didn' fare as well, I suggested it being used as the ""Big Fish"" trophy from now on."
1454776,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-27 08:44:00,235,Almost forgot...a stringer with three or four walleyes on it. Have often wondered if those boys and girls found a way to make their life together work. They were alive and well when we last saw them.
1454777,Obabikon,2012-06-27 08:47:00,2370,"My wedding ring's down there. Felt it slip off my finger when I was releasing a fish. (I almost always take it off when I go, but forgot). My wife took it well though. I did make a lunge for it at the last second, but to no avail."
1454780,Bitinlight,2012-06-27 08:55:00,95,"A number of years ago, I really got on to a school of walleyes. Instead of backtrolling and drifting through like I usually do, I decide to anchor and vertical jig. When it was time to leave, I could not get the anchor up-must have wedged in some rocks or boulders somehow. Tried everything I could to pull it up, but nothing worked. Finally, just cut the rope and that was the end of that."
1454796,Jig A Lowe,2012-06-27 09:27:00,87,"Man, you have a ton of company! I'd bet that lost anchors is the ""number one answer"". I once lost a fish basket with about 30 perch in it. It was the kind that clipped onto the back of the boat and when I tilted it forward to add another perch it came loose and slipped to the bottom of the lake. My mother was furious. We tried to hook that thing for about an hour to no avail."

1454830,Richard B,2012-06-27 10:28:00,735,"It's not me but in 2008, my youngest brother forgot to tie his rods down on the front deck of his 620. 4 St. Croix rods with Adrent reels and 2 3600 tackle boxes full of stick baits overboard at 55mph. He was not very happy."
1454837,@Lunker,2012-06-27 10:41:00,835,Launched a perfect cast and a baitcaster rod and reel followed it right into the water. Also a jaw spreader that I forgot to take out of the Northern's mouth before I released it.
1454843,outdoorsron,2012-06-27 10:47:00,843,"Hello: I'm storing a Seiko wristwatch on Lac De Millac, It had a gold band that somehow became unsnapped and fell off while netting a fish, we tried to snag it for a long time but no luck, pulled out a fishing rod on Lac De Millac that had been there a while, cleaned it up and was catching walleyes with it an hour later, pliers on Lake Wenesaga, a Columbia shirt on Red Lake, cheap sunglasses all over. On Gull Rock I almost lost a custom made fishing rod and reel $375.00 that went overboard while I was netting a 30"" Walleye for my buddy. After I netted the fish and photos taken (It was released) I turned around and my rod was gone, I thought my buddies were messing with me. Luckily I ended up snagging my line and retrieving it. It was a good thing I caught it because if my buddies caught it I might have had to buy it back or at least cough up a couple cases of beer. I also caught a new ski rope on Devils Lake, nothing on either end. Saw a big bobber on Lac De Millac moving through the water, netted a 41"" Northern on it, (released live and well), caught various rod and reel outfits nothing very expensive . Caught a pair of vise grips that must have been in the lake 50 years they were junk and I released it back. Was fishing on Leech Lake one time, the bite was on and we ran out of minnows.We were going to head back and get more but as we were leaving our spot we came across one of those flow through yellow minnow buckets guys throw over the side of their boat, it was full of minnows. It didn't have a rope on it , their knot must have came loose. Good for us bad for them. fished out a couple of anchors after catching the ropes. Good Luck O - R"

1454637,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-26 21:39:00,235,"Name something you've dropped in the lake that you will never see again. Aside from a few hundred dollars worth of lures, not much comes to mind for me save a pair of pliers."

1454674,Skywagon,2012-06-27 05:24:00,1106,"I donated a nice rod/reel to the lake Gods on Eagle, opening day this year. In the reverse, we found a nice boat cushion that floated up on our shore a couple of weeks ago."

We spent a long time with an underwater camera looking for them but never found 'em (we did see, however, a nice smallie!). Fortunately, he didn't need them for driving!"
