Last year at this time, they donated a 7 day trip to our club (FM Walleyes Unlimited) to be used for fundraising. Great people to work with.Scotty BNPAA #665"
1546254,wallydave,2013-03-03 20:47:00,2151,Just wait for Pooch to reply! If you watch the video on the website you will see how he feels aboout Savant!! Yea my bucket list just keeps getting longer!
1546713,bobo4030,2013-03-04 20:19:00,235,"wmd, I've been there six times, I think. Four times with Pooch. 10 or 15 days in camp each trip. Cost is a good value. Equipment clean and reliable. The accommodations are a mix of old and new, but all wel maintained. A solar power system keeps the generator from running much. The fishing is very good. The lake is beautiful. Two other very small camps on the lake. Walleye, lake trout, and northerns. A few whitefish. No smallmouth. Matt and Kim run a nice camp. Is that different enough for you? Rick"

1547646,Pooch,2013-03-06 18:16:00,4619,"Lake Savant is a relatively large body of water. Take a look at it on google earth. There are three fairly small camps on the lake. ""Wildewood"" on the southern part of the lake and ""Cliff & Roma's"" along with ""Cat Track"" located more in the central basin. All are good camps with really great people running them. I'd stay at any of the three anytime. That said Wildewood is a little nicer camp overall. I think prices are comparable between all three. You access Wildewood via a closed to the public trail using the camps tracked vehicle. Last I knew the other two camps were accessed by two float float operators. It would be about a fifteen minute flight.Lake Savant is roughly twenty miles long and the fishing is pretty consistent everywhere. There are many large bays and more islands or groups of islands to fish than you can count. The lake is not terribly hard to get around on, but can be intimidating initially. Having and being familier with a gps unit would be wise. I've fished this lake a lot since the early nineties and I still carry and use a gps. Severl times we've used it to navigate our way back to camp when were were caught a long ways from camp in the dark or by a storm. Since Savant lays sort of SW to NE any thunderstorm has potential to spank you when the summer months roll around. When it gets black in the SW you better get closer to camp. 'nuff said.Fishing is above average for this far north. The average walleye on this lake is several inches larger than any other lake we fish or used to fish. Most of the time it is not a ""numbers"" lake, but can be if you try.The owners of Wildewood, Matt and Kim seem to focus on lake trout. I'm a little concerned as there are some really nice lakers being harvested that probably should not be removed from the lake. Problem is that fishing that deep for them the risk of killing a nice fish increase. Lake trout should be able to survive coming from depth, but so not always. I believe it's almost a sin to needlessly harvest a large fish (all species) this far north. Some of these fish are older than the people catching them. (Sorry for the preach, just my values)If I can answer any specific questions contact me via WC and we can exchange email addresses.Good luck. Looking for a new camp can be a little uneasy. My wife and I have hit a couple camps that were not quite what was advertised. Should have done more homework and learned a lesson long remembered.This is a good camp. Just don't tell anyone else!The pictures in my photo album on this site speak better than I can.Pooch"
1547750,elway12,2013-03-06 21:25:00,335,Pooch knows what he's talking about. I have been to Wildewood 3 or 4 times. Always a solid camp experience. Everything the previous posters have stated is true. Have to know where and how to fish if you get any type of cold fronts etc. or it can be slow. Some big fish in that lake for the three main species. I hope to get back there sometime... Like Pooch said Shhhhh....
