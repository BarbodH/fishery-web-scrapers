That was on a lake accesscible by foot only, about 1.5mi. walkingI found a online resume of the show:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ4nE...layer_embedded#!"
1544408,MrSimon,2013-02-28 06:23:00,922,"Those fishing shows sure do make places look like heaven! I love watching them!!! I'm sure its a good lake to fish, but its usually impossible to re-create the results shown on these kinds of shows."
1544635,revitup,2013-02-28 13:35:00,140,"It is my guess they are talking about Onaman Lake. Yes, 1 1/2 mile walk in, carrying your poles,bait,gas,food and drink. And most likely you will carry out your limit of nice walleye and have a fun, fun day. I stayed in a resort next to pasha lake cabins for about 15 years. In fact bought our bait at Pasha many times. Good memories and the walk isn't that bad. But don't carry more than a box of jigs for bait and some minnows, crawlers. Great memories of that lake."

I think these lodge owners give the shows a free ride or even pay them to come and advertise how great the fishing is even if it sucks. They are a paid commercial for the lodge. I,ve been to a couple that were on TV and the fishing was terrible but on TV they were jumping in the boat. I know maybe I sucked at fishing which could be true. They are almost like a Joan Rivers infomercial."
1545325,polaris-pete,2013-03-01 18:37:00,343,I will tell you from our experiences up at Pasha that yes the fishing is just like you saw on TV.We created fishing at times more than the TV Show showed.Would love to get back there but 20 hours driving 1 way was cruel on the body!
1545604,revitup,2013-03-02 12:50:00,140,I agree with Pete. Onaman Lake is a fantastic fishery. That is not an exaggeration. Although I would not say that 6# were normal when I last fished it about 10 years ago.
1545722,polaris-pete,2013-03-02 18:23:00,343,"I agree with you that no, 6# fish are not normal.We did catch a few 6-8 lbs ( about 6 for the week) but the norms for us were in the 3-5 lbs class. Outstanding fisheries up there. Maybe next year!! Onaman is a hugh lake and never saw more than 2 boats on it the week we were there. Better be self-sufficent if a problem occurs as there sure isn't anyone around to help you out in an Emergency."
1545732,eyemike,2013-03-02 19:06:00,233,Fished the area for quite a few years and There are a few lakes in the area that produce good numbers. Onaman is a gem that produces both numbers and size. To average 6 I don't think so. 3 topping out at 6 with a few bigger is more like it. Revitup was it Marv Cue's place that you stayed? I spent 20 years going there.
1545764,revitup,2013-03-02 20:09:00,140,Eyemike--yes we did stay at marv's.went up there with brothers and nephews and my son for many years. And in 1989 took my bride up there for our honeymoon! Had many 100 walleye/ boat days. Also netted a couple 8# on paint lake near the falls over the years. Enjoyed trips to Wilkerson ad northwind. Had a good northern day on altitude with marv and Bert on our honeymoon. Now choose to go where we can just hop in the boat rather than trailering each day. But nothing beats onaman.
