1543566,crazyfisher,2013-02-26 10:49:00,25,"Ok...understood, but if you want to keep those camps, lodges and outposts open year after year so you can enjoy them, they need new clients. Help them out, they helped you."

1461526,deputy dog,2012-07-14 18:44:00,305,Mattice lake outfitters has good fishing and comfortable cabins....walleye.ca Worth a look
1461549,Ogoki,2012-07-14 20:31:00,291,"Deputy Dog , I got an email awhile back from Don Elliot -Mattice Lake Outfitters telling me he bought out Armstrong Outposts . I looked at his web site today and he has those lakes listed also .I have been to all those except Luella. Have been to those lakes several times . Don has a SUPER selection of lakes . I am booked to go to Whiteclay later this summer . Next June , Lord willing , we are planning to do two lakes back to back , on the Ogoki River system ."
1462997,vsogard,2012-07-18 08:57:00,3,"since you will be crossing in I-Falls I would recomend Northern Wilderness Outfitters, they are based in Fort Frances. they offer top quality trips and have been doing so for almost 40 years. in my opinion they are by far the best in the business and offer the best bang for the buck, short drive time to the main base and they fly just as far North as other outfitters that have their main base farther north (4-6 hrs from the border) for about the same price, actually TOTAL Cost is probably less since you dont have to gas up in canada ($6.00 gal USD) your time etc. ""less driving time = more time for fishing"" I suggest giving them a call"
1463195,Bitinlight,2012-07-18 15:51:00,95,"Can't go wrong with Hidden Bay Outpost Fly-ins out of Sioux Lookout. Great lakes, fishing, food, and great service. They take care of you."
1472833,fisherman.jay,2012-08-09 14:43:00,1,"I would second the vote on KaBeeLo Lodge, been up there for many years and no doubt the service and fishing is great, www.kabeelo.com highly recommend"

1542180,crazyfisher,2013-02-23 11:50:00,25,"If you want absolute ""stupid"" walleye, bass, pike and muskie go to Halley's Camps near Minaki Ontario. best fresh water fishing I have ever seen!!"
1542429,RolandDeschain,2013-02-23 22:24:00,30,"As other have said, all walleye outposts are not the same. And after 20 years of Canadian fly in trips, I know of several absolutely fabulous ones. But there is no way I am going to share them on a message board because it took us 20 years to find them! They are out there - hope you and your boys have as much fun in the journey as we have!"
1542711,zeebee,2013-02-24 17:27:00,1144,Agree and Ive been on dozens of fly-ins. Booi's is the best in my books. Laker fishing is superb as well.

1452992,SinOrSwim,2012-06-23 08:11:00,1528,"I'm guessing one good walleye outpost is as good as another up there? No, that is NOT true. There can be a big difference. Fishing aside. There can be big differences from the equipment at the cabins, boats etc. Some cabins have indoor showers and toilets. Others have outhouses. You can crap indoors or you can crap in a mosquito and bug filled smelly box. Some places have you drag the boats onto the sandy shore and some have docks/slips to tie them up. Some have wooden walkways all the way to the cabin and some just have paths in the dirt/sand. Those things make a huge difference in how dirty your boat gets from sand on your boots to how dirty the cabin gets. Some outfitters have very strict weight limits while others will work with you and fly in extra stuff on a check flight later that day or the next without charging you huge fees per pound over your limit. ANd, believe me you will go over your limit. Some cabins we have been to have had so many mice you could put a trap down on the floor at night and sit at the kitchen table and watch one walk in and get snapped. All those mice are crapping on everything you have while you are sleeping and are out. Other places pay attention to pest control. Slate Falls and Red Pine definitely do. Would see a mouse once in awhile but not very often. Some have big propane cookers and some have crappy little gas grills. Point being they are not all alike. You CAN go wrong. Take the advice of people who have been to these places as you can get a lot of good advice on this board.Good luck and enjoy. Oh, and keep your fingers crossed it's not really windy when you fly. Aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. LOL We have had some white knuckle flights before."
1453118,Dogbreath,2012-06-23 15:21:00,494,"Having done a few fly-ins with them, both for hunting and fishing, I would recommend Knobby's out of Sour Outlook. Kesik Lake is about an hour north in a Beaver and the lake is full of walleye. Never boated any records, buts lots and lots of eaters.Camps have propane so there is hot water and stoves. Lots of bald eagles for the kids to watch also, you can bring them in close when you put the days fish stuff on an island. This is recommended to keep the critters, away from the camps.Also pulled moose out of there, sunset is a good time to troll the shores looking for them.ask for Lars he is the GMhttp://www.knobbys.on.ca/good luck whereever you go"

1454098,TroyMansfield,2012-06-25 21:20:00,92,"id say check out winoga lodge, I can personally say its has some of the nicest fly in outpost camps in northwest ontario, also check out the camp on lake st joe, its a boat in option so it is actually cheaper then flying in, and there is no weight restrictions either, I may even be the guy that hauls you in with the 27ft 450hp landing craft. pm if you have any questions"
1461247,Guest,2012-07-13 19:04:00,0,"Easy! The ""Meat Hole"" on Blackstone Lake, if you are looking for stupid easy fishing. Each guy was catching 90+ per day without breaking a sweat. In fact, the kids were catching the walleyes on Gummy Bears when we were start to run low on minnows during the last day Great accommodations! You just can beat Blackstone! Jim"
1461250,Guest,2012-07-13 19:13:00,0,"Opps! I has getting so excited thinking about time up at Blackstone there, I forgot some details. Blackstone lake is north of Sioux Lookout. about a half hour flight in the turbine seaplane. We stayed at Hidden Bay Lodges cabin on the lake. top notch outfit. They were highly recommended to our group and we were not disappointed. Good Luck! Jim"
1461274,buckeyedan,2012-07-13 20:34:00,44,I'm going to mention the lake that I have been going to since I was a kid - Nagagami Lake. 4.5 hours north of Sault Ste. Marie. Fly out of Hornepayne. Kids are half price in July and August. Stupid easy walleye fishing and above average Pike fishing. First class operation. www.kayveelodge.com
1452427,Guest,2012-06-21 19:51:00,0,"Pal and I are looking at taking our boys for our first-ever Canadian fly-in trip during July of 2013. Will be crossing at International Falls. I know there are a lot of knowledgeable guys on here so I'm looking for some tips where to go. Here's what we're after: *Stupid-easy walleye and/or bass fishing *Opportunity for decent musky and/or pike fishing I'll be sharing my boat with my 10 year old son. Him with his two sons, 12 and 16. Two questions: 1. Lodge(s)?--- 2. Early-Mid-Late July best? I thank you in advance!"
1452441,Rich B,2012-06-21 20:10:00,1081,"Cowboy,You've asked the right crowd, and I also fish north of Int'l Falls (my friends and I used to fish Lake Vermilion in MN - much, much better fishing north of the Falls a few hours). For my Ohio buddies and I to drive up, it's 24 hours one way, so you know it's great fishing !!You'll receive plenty of suggestions for camps and resorts.....you're going to make great ""Father-son"" memories for your son and your friend with his boys, and I couldn't think of a better place to do that than Northwestern Ontario.Good luck with your decision, take plenty of photos and be safe.Rich B"
1452453,NARDA 1,2012-06-21 20:38:00,636,Take a look at Wilderness Air at www.great-fishing.com Bob and Kelsey run a great operation.
1452477,packpro,2012-06-21 21:17:00,695,"Here's a second vote for Wilderness Air. Some lakes will be better than others based on your species requests. Check with Bob. I would also look into Big Canon Lake Lodge. It is a fly-in serviced by Wilderness. Little pricey, but we see many father and sons there. I think Sam (camp owner) will work with you based on your group. PM for me for more details, and if you book it let me know...I have 12 years worth of very good spots for the variety of water and species you will be looking for."
1452497,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-21 22:31:00,235,"My group has been using Kabeelo Airways near Ear Falls. We too cross at International Falls. Been going up for 9 of the last 12 years and have always been pleased with the both the fishing and the service. Kabeelo flies you to ""do it yourself"" outpost camps, so if you want a so called 'American plan' trip where people cook for you, make your bed and possibly guide you, this is not the camp for you. The fishing is walleye and pike oriented, too far north for bass. Very easy walleye fishing on their lakes. I wouldn't worry too much about what part of July you will be there, regardless of where you decide to go. I have done trips from the second week of July through first week of August and not noticed mich difference...the summer pattern is in full swing. There are always fish biting somewhere on these fly in lakes. Call and ask Harald for a recommendation of a good lake for your situation. Www.kabeelo.com"

Tuesday night chowder night for the whole camp, casting contests, prizes. Bar none - best fly in experience I've ever had. Can't stress the service aspect enough, for experts of newbies..."
1452588,SinOrSwim,2012-06-22 08:26:00,1528,"http://www.slatefallsoutposts.com/http://www.fishredpine.com/Slate Falls sold half their cabins to Red Pine. Basically, Verne with Slate Falls had Red Pine Lodge in Sioux Lookout as his drive to camp and where he lived. There is a cabin they both use to house guests before an early flight the next morning as well called the bunkhouse. Very nice, pool table etc. He sold half the outposts to Jon along with the main lodge. Verne operates the other half of the outposts as Slate Falls and Jon operates the main lodge and outposts as Red Pine. Both use Slate Falls Airways in Sioux Lookout. We had been using one or the other for the last 12 or so years and going to North or South Gull. Those are both Red Pine cabins/lakes now. The numbers of walleyes and size are fantastic. The last 3 or 4 years we went we never left without the largest being 27 to 30"". Plus, GREAT numbers. We always went in September though. Cabins are top notch for a fly-in. Floating slips for boats, motors that always run great, indoor plumbing for shower and toilet, propane appliances like frig/freezer, solar lights etc. Not fancy but clean and comfortable.Been a long time since we were at Minnis but remember it was okay for fishing. Granted, we were fairly new and learned a lot over the years so taht could be why as well. Gull is absolutely fantastic. I like the North Cabin a little better but both are nice. Verne is by far the best outfitter we have ever had. Very funny and his organization runs like a top. Jon, not as people oriented it didn't seem like but nice enough and runs his operation just like Verne as he worked for Verne for a long time before buying half the operation. We didn't fish for Pike but I can't imagine the walleye fishing better anywhere else. Have fun!"
1452876,Guest,2012-06-22 20:25:00,0,Wow...thanks for all the great information....how do I ever wade through all this? I'm guessing one good walleye outpost is as good as another up there? Twin Lakes out of Nakina looks good too. Hmmm....
1452885,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-22 20:39:00,235,"No doubt there are hundreds if not thousands of excellent walleye outposts out there. I'm sure wherever you go the fishing will be excellent. And you won't regret July either...weather is generally stable and the fish continue to bite. There's never any of the ""you shoulda been here a week ago"" nonsense that you put up with elsewhere. I might suggest that you pick a lake where your cabin is the only outpost. You may want to pick a numbers lake over a trophy if taking the kids."
