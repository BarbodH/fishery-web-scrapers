1543632,Guest,2013-02-26 12:38:00,0,"Does anyone have any info about Gawley's Little Beaver Lodge possibly being sold? I talked to Doug a couple months ago about possible dates for this summer. I haven't been in touch since. Now their website is redirected to ""Northern Lights Outposts"" which seems to be owned by Clark's Resorts and Outposts. The old Gawley's number is also redirected. I have called all the numbers available-no answer. I left voicemails and they haven't been returned yet...it's only been an hour or so since I left them. Any info would be appreciated. I really enjoyed my first stay at the main Lac Seul camp last year. Doug and Gail were great hosts..."
1543856,bigtimeelectric,2013-02-26 20:23:00,174,I am wondering myself. I know they have been talking about selling the outposts for years. I am sure they will still be operating the main lodge. This will be our 9th year going there and we all love that place. I am sure we will find out from somebody in the know on here.
1544753,Guest,2013-02-28 17:31:00,0,I still haven't received a call back. Anyone have any word on this?

1544797,Guest,2013-02-28 19:19:00,0,yep just got a call back from the new owner. He seemed like a really nice guy and gave me a phone number for Gawley's. He took over all the outposts. I talked to Gail and they are still running the main Lac Seul camp. I confirmed my July dates. 807-222-3333 is Gawley's number now.
