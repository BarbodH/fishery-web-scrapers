1544025,MrSimon,2013-02-27 09:17:00,922,That's some awesome fishing right there! It seems days like that are becoming more and more prevalent. Have you noticed a general increase or decrease in the number of big bass (17+) you catch? Do you or anyone you know actually fill out and send in Ontario Angler Award certificates?
1544033,Mike Willems,2013-02-27 09:36:00,4,"The following article was published in a 2006 edition of In-Fisherman magazine:Changing Fisheries on a Global Scale, Gord Pyzer wrote the following.The past decade has been the warmest in recorded history. All but one of the hottest years on record  19 of the top 20  have occurred in the last twenty years. The earth is one degree warmer today than it was a century ago, making it hotter now than at any time in the past 10,000 years, according to the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies Global warming might seem inviting to anglers on a cold spring morning, and temperature increases of only a degree or two might seem insignificant. But, politics aside, our warming climate is having a profound effect upon the water where we fish. While they may look unchanged on the surface, fish communities are being altered. The dominant sport species are shifting and food chains are being transformed in ways that require us to modify our seasonal fishing patterns if not change them altogether.There are going to be winners and losers, says Peter Colby, Walleye Research Unit Leader. It depends on your value system. Percids (walleye, perch, and sauger) and Centrarchids (bass, crappie, and bluegill) are likely to come out ahead. But it is sayonara for trout, salmon, and coregonids like whitefish and ciscoes.And what of the victors in the warming-water walleye scenario? They're likely to be the biggest lakes like Leech, Mille Lacs, Lake of the woods, Rainy, Lac Seul, Nipigon, and Winnipeg, which are better able to buffer and absorb some of the impact.Acknowledging already dramatic increases in the number and size of smallmouth bass across North America, Dr John Casselman, professor at Queen's University says, If Lake Ontario waters warm an additional 1 degree Celsius, the abundance of smallmouth bass will increase 2.5 times. If the temp. warms 2 degrees, the population will increase 6 fold.Indeed, Casselman finds it miraculous that the fish he's studied for decades are more responsive to changes in water temperature than the most highly sophisticated scientific technology. They are, in fact, like canaries in the coalmines. The smallmouth bass in the Bay of Quinte told me more about what's occurring in Eastern Lake Ontario than I could measure with a thermometer, Says Casselman, who's now currently studying how lakes carry heat units over into subsequent years. They were better thermal indicators than I could measure with my instruments.It's apparent, he says, that global warming will significantly alter year-class production and fish community structure and dynamics, substantially decreasing recruitment of coldwater and coolwater species and increasing recruitment of warmwater species.Time will tell the degree to which hot fishing takes on a whole new meaning.As the owner and operator of Silver Water Wheel Lodge on Lac Seul, I require all 13 of my full time guides to record their boat catches of walleyes over 18 in, pike of 30 in., and smallmouth bass over 15 in. on a daily basis. Our data collection represents full seasons of operation since the year 2000. During that time frame catch rates for bass have steadily increased to more than 7 times the number of bass we caught and released during the first 5 years of data collection. During that same time frame walleye catch rates showed more variation between years, but overall remained relatively constant. Pike catch rates have increased gradually over time, but the guide crew has also spent more time focusing on pike over the past few years.I also guide every day and I can tell you with certainty that the smallmouth bass population in the south central basins of Lac Seul is not only increasing, but is also expanding in terms of locations.My background is in fisheries biology and I agree with some of the earlier comments that indicate that competion between walleyes and smallmouth bass is likely to only occur at a significant level when food sources are limited. I have no data to cite, but anecdotal observations lead me to believe that the forage base on Lac Seul is abundant and diverse. I personally am not concerned about competition between walleyes and smallmouth bass at this time.Mike WillemsSilver Water Wheel Lodge"
1544101,Mike Kansas,2013-02-27 12:03:00,1463,"The last 10 years we have seen a significant increase in the amount of Smallies and now we see a lot of 17"" fish with some every year 20""+++. Biggest has been 22 1/2"". Best baits have been vspinners and small cranks and flipping plastics. Mike Kansas"
1544170,MrSimon,2013-02-27 14:37:00,922,"Mike Willems - awesome info!! Thanks. While I don't agree that global warming is having any impact on smallies (or even exists for that matter - but that's another story) its clearly obvious that they are thriving and increasing in numbers. This article has a great little map that indicates smallies are not native to the vast majority of Ontario waters ... especially the norther areas.http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/stdprodcons...rod_095205.pdf They were introduced through stocking programs in the early to mid 1900's as well as by accident or illegal transfer. Either way, it was humans that began putting smallies in Ontario waters starting in the early 1900s. Its my belief that it takes a newly introduced species quite a bit of time to get established and really starting reproducing in numbers ..... but when they do, the reproduction can be exponential in nature until they reach the natural limit the lake can handle. My guess is that the last ten to fifteen years has been part of that exponential growth. Factoring in the very low harvest rates on smallies and the size limits in place .... I think we'll continue to see rapid growth until they hit their natural limit. If I had to guess, I'd say it levels off in the next five years, but that's just a guess."
1544269,Aaron-IN,2013-02-27 18:13:00,500,I dunno if i'm buying it. Ive been targeting smallies for close to 30 years in NW Ontario and from my experience there were just as many around 30 years ago as there are today.
1544290,Pooch,2013-02-27 19:04:00,4619,"Well written and informative. At first I thought it might just be me, but you folks have noticed it too. We always think about what is happening on all the lakes our group fishes. Some for many years. Even in my short tenure fishing LS if I have noticed something that noticeably that quick then it's not coincidental.I believe in data and yours speaks with credibility.Again, thanks.Pooch"
1544453,Bill Krejca,2013-02-28 07:58:00,6107,"Going back to some of my earlier experiences on LOW in the late 1940's and early 50's, I remember how excited my dad would get when he hooked an occasional smallmouth, occasional being several times a day. The familiar ""bass"" exclamation was many times followed by the jumping fish throwing the plug back towards the boat. Any color bait worked as long as it was yellow. It seemed at that time that loosing a high percentage was just standard catch experience. There were some very large smallmouth at the time, but nowhere near as populated as nowadays. As I mentioned in an earlier post, Dad would sometimes bring in a bass or two to eat, as he didn't mind them at all. He also loved to eat the gigantic bullheads he would catch at night. Bill Krejca"
1544461,nitrodude,2013-02-28 08:12:00,60,"Two years ago my then 10 yr. old son CPR'ed the fourth largest smallmouth in the Master Angler Award category for 2011. It was 21""+ and right at 6 lbs. on the Boga Grip. The MNR sent a nice congratulatory letter and copy of the glossy newsletter, plus our lodge made a certificate and had the certified entry framed for him with photos of the catch. The patch was immediately added to his fishing jacket when we got home and he's laid out where the next patches will go as he attempts to accumulate more. We prominently hung the awards in the den and his eyes still light up and conversation turns to our next trip to the Lac Seul area whenever he catches a glimpse of his accomplishment. Since 1963, males in my in-laws family become eligible to go on the annual trek to Sioux Lookout and the Lac Seul area for an annual fishing trip after their tenth birthday. It is and always has been a ""man trip"" and the women of the families seem quite pleased with it. Lol. (The age was determined by my FIL as appropriate to have severed the ""apron strings"" and start the ""man training"".) After joining the entourage in 1995 by marrying into it, I'd have to say it is my most enjoyed fishing trip of the year! (And I fish a LOT!) Originally I was told that smallmouth were few and infrequent as we were ""too far north"". I found out rather quick that was not the case. Through the years the population has significantly increased as well as the average size, much to the pleasure of a few of the Southern members of the group reared on bass fishing. Years ago we extended it to a 10 day excursion and we all count down the other 355 days just to have those 10 up there. Especially my 10 yr. old that landed his Master Angler smallmouth his first trip up!"
1544475,2746,2013-02-28 08:28:00,3206,"Speaking of the ""Southern"" members of your group. We had (he's gone now) a gentleman from Arkansas that made our yearly trip to Canada with us. He LOVED to bass fish and never really got very excited about the jigging or trolling aspect of Walleye. In fact we finally barred him from taking his turn at the electic tolling motor because he would slowly leave the ""walley hole"" and edge over to the shore line where he could cast plugs toward the rocks for bass or pike. We had lots of fun kidding him about that but when he tied into one of those smallmouths you could hear him all over the lake.....got to admit they are fun catch."
1543620,MrSimon,2013-02-26 12:18:00,922,"x2 on that! Smallies taste as good as walleye, they fight harder, they are more aggressive, they are easier to catch ...... yet they still are considered a trash fish by many die hard walleye guys. There is just something magical about the walleye that can't really be put into words I suppose."
1543645,Pooch,2013-02-26 13:22:00,4619,"Could the ""explosion"" of small mouth eventually hurt the walleye population on Lac Seul and other lakes that host small mouth?I've only been fishing Lac Seul for six years and it seems we are catching a lot more smallies while fishing for walleye than we did since I've started fishing there. Last fall every time you turned around someone had a small mouth on. Whether fishing jigs or trolling.Just a thought.Pooch"
1543673,MrSimon,2013-02-26 14:12:00,922,"I dug up the following two excerpts from two different science journals. In a nut shell, they conclude that walleye and smallmouth bass will coexist just fine, as long as their is enough food to go around. If prey is limited, the aggressive nature of smallies give them the upper hand and they will dominate walleye.Quote: The range of smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) is expanding northward, creating new interactions with native predators, including walleye (Sander vitreus). We used a series of experiments to investigate competition between walleye (WAE) and smallmouth bass (SMB) at different life stages and light conditions, identified behaviors that allowed one fish to outcompete another, and evaluated whether prey switching mitigated competitive interactions. Juvenile and adult SMB appeared to outcompete WAE when fed during the daytime; neither species dominated when fed near dusk. Attack rates and capture efficiencies of both species were similar with an intra- or interspecific competitor, but SMB often exploited prey before the competitor had a chance to feed (exploitative competition) or displayed agonistic behaviors toward a potential competitor (interference competition). Prey selectivity of WAE or SMB did not differ when by themselves or with a potential competitor. These results indicate that SMB could outcompete WAE under limiting prey conditions due to the aggressive nature of SMB, but resources may be partitioned at least along a temporal scale. Quote: Overall, between the field work on Lake Sharpe and the experiments at SDSU, we've learned much about competition between walleye and smallmouth bass. It appears that subjected to limited prey resources that smallmouth bass can best walleye through their aggressive nature. However, we did have to limit prey to very low abundances to actually observe competition. In the natural world, these types of conditions don't often exist. Instead, abundant and diverse types of prey may be available, and predators can alter diets to adapt to these conditions. For example, crayfish are plentiful in some natural lakes in eastern South Dakota, and smallmouth bass take advantage of this while walleye might stick to a diet of yellow perch. There is still much to be learned about how walleye and smallmouth bass interact with each other, and how other factors such as light level or prey diversity may affect competition. More experiments are planned for this summer, and thanks to the Jesse West endowment, we can continue to learn more about competition and feeding habits of these and other fishes."
1543732,2746,2013-02-26 16:13:00,3206,"It appears MrSimon has some science that would suggest they can get along fine however, I remember a lodge owner on Gullrock that felt strongly that Smallmouth were bad for walleye fishing long term. No science behind his thinking but he had been in the resort business for years and claimed he had seen the damage they could do."
1543738,zeebee,2013-02-26 16:19:00,1144,"I would take ""lodgelore"" with a grain of salt. Ive fished more than a few lakes that had both great walleye and SMB. As long as the lakes are healthy with a solid ecosystem theres no reason they cant coexist in abundance. Dont know your particular buddy and Ive met some owners with a very indepth knowledge of freshwater biology but Ive also had one tell me the slower summer walleye bite was due to them losing and growing new teeth. Told him I'd never seen a walleye with no teeth. He thought for a second or two, gave me that ""youre a dum *** look""and said ""'course you havent...they aint biting when they gots no teeth"".Dunno, he must of been fed a bad batch of maple syrup or somethin when he was a kid."
1543739,bluegussler,2013-02-26 16:20:00,124,Next comes the Largemouth
1543748,Bill Krejca,2013-02-26 16:42:00,6107,"Yeah, I've experienced their taste many times, just a matter of opinion, I guess. I just never pointed out the grubs when I was cooking to the others when we fished portage waters devoid of other eating fish (other than muskie). Bill"
1543786,Pooch,2013-02-26 17:38:00,4619,"Interesting post Mrsimon. Thanks. Sure hope it holds up to the test of time.Walleye losing their teeth? I thought that went away about twenty or thirty years ago. WC continues to keep us old guys entertained!Hey Bill K, don't you know that grubs are packed with protein!? I'll give you a hollor in a few weeks about meeting up again.Pooch"
1543940,MrSimon,2013-02-27 06:37:00,922,"Most of the studies I read indicate that Largemouth and Walleye do not play well together. The studies were so conclusive that most states won't stock walleye in a lake with a good population of largemouth bass. I know there are plenty of lakes that have both fish, but its usually only VERY large and healthy lakes that can support full populations of both."
1544019,Mike Kansas,2013-02-27 09:09:00,1463,We fish Lac Seul in early June and if you focus on Smallies 70 to 100 fish days are common. Mike Kansas
1543446,MrSimon,2013-02-26 07:57:00,922,"It seems to me that there are a LOT more smallies in Ontario than 20 years ago. I'm not complaining, because I love catching them. I just find it interesting. Using Lake Windermere as an example (picked it because I was there last year), I looked up all the data on Ontario Angling Awards issued for that lake over the past 8 years. You can see the chart below, but it looks like the amount of awards issued for big walleye and pike has stayed relatively constant, but the smallie awards have gone through the roof. Why is this? Are more people fishing for them? Are the size limits on this particular lake working THAT well? Is there something going on with the baitfish population? Is it weather related? I'm also really curious if this is happening on other lakes as well. If I have time, I'll do a similar analysis for some of the big boys like LOTW or Seul."
1543459,MrSimon,2013-02-26 08:21:00,922,"So I ran the numbers for Lac Seul. There were over 4,000 entries so its a pretty good sample. There has been a significant decline in angler awards issued for Pike, Walleye, and Smallies caught over the past 8 years. This was really surprising to me. I've never fished this lake. Maybe you guys who do can add some perspective."
1543503,10point,2013-02-26 09:19:00,102,We go to Ontario and mainly fish for smallies. They are abundant and a lot of people in Ontario consider them trash fish. We don't go to the high dollar places that have tons of walleyes so we fish for what we can catch and that is usually smallies. They put up a fight and taste great.
1543504,HeHooksHimself,2013-02-26 09:20:00,725,"Simon, it is interesting that the decline on Lac Seul is so severe. It is my guess that it does not reflect the fishery as much as it reflects the number of lodges and/or individuals that report their catches to the Ontario Angler Awards organization. What might others think?"
1543531,MrSimon,2013-02-26 10:00:00,922,"I thought of that too, and it could definitely be the case. Although I don't know why lodges would slow down because its a great marketing tool. I know for a fact that Happy Day Lodge (Lake Windermere) pushes really hard for their clients to fill out award submissions for every fish that qualifies. They go so far as to print the forms out right there for you to sign and they send them in. I'll check a few other lakes and see what those look like for comparison."
1543547,MrSimon,2013-02-26 10:21:00,922,"Lake of the Woods only had about 1,100 entries. The results are more consistent than either of the two other lakes .... and there seems to be a steady increase in walleye awards, with the past two years being outstanding. 2008 stands out as a particularly good year across all species on LOTW, but it was one of the worst years for Lac Seul. One thing is for sure, year over year fishing success is a LOT different from lake to lake."
1543552,Skywagon,2013-02-26 10:27:00,1106,"I have noticed the same thing on smallmouth numbers the last few years in different lakes, there must be something driving their increase. I really don't consider it a good thing, as I would guess they are competing with walleye. I am glad some people like to fish for them, hope everyone keeps their limit."
1543589,zeebee,2013-02-26 11:32:00,1144,"...its OK by me. I enjoy fishing for many species and smallies have to rank near the top for fight and tablefare. Wonder if the proliferation,if true, is tied to general warming trends."
1543595,Bill Krejca,2013-02-26 11:42:00,6107,"My guess as to increasing data - most folks who catch them let them go. Walleyes and even pike get kept at a higher rate because they are the food of choice for most of us. Smallmouth in many waters have grubs under the skin, sometimes a bunch.Take a good look, next time one is cleaned. That said, now there will probably be more of them available for release. Bill"
1543601,10point,2013-02-26 11:47:00,102,The smallies we eat from the Canadian shield lakes are delicious.
