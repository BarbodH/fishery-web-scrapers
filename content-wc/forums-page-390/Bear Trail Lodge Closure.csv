1544555,2746,2013-02-28 10:48:00,3206,"don't know a thing about this camp but do know about business investments. (spent 40 years as a banker lending on business purchases and, unfortunately, taking a few back.) Goldon is right......if the business is not shouting to you that it's a money maker and instead your being drawn to it by your heart........ run! We all think we can do something to ""turn a business around"" but that's extremely difficult and better left to the proffessionals. On the other hand, if you have the cash and just want something to keep you busy with no profit motives in mind then maybe the camp would be a good hobby."
1544578,MrSimon,2013-02-28 11:41:00,922,"You are probably right. But, how many people lay on their death bed and say ""I wish I would have made more money in life"" Money isn't everything. Yes, its important and you have to provide for your family .... but its not always wrong to follow your heart instead of your bank account."
1544592,SinOrSwim,2013-02-28 12:15:00,1528,"Always different options to look at. But, say the place needed updating with the cabins. Probably a pretty good time to do it rather than buying cabins that have everything in them but need a complete remodel. Sounds like many of these have been stripped bare? Now, buying and then getting rid of all the old appliances and fixtures is done. You can build it out how you want. All depends on the price you are paying for it. Just make sure you ahve a good business plan and know all the costs etc. Everyone keeps talking about how nobody is making any money, down economy etc. SOMEONE must be making money or they wouldn't be in business? I don't know many businesses that can operate for years losing money? I could never do something like that because I'm not handy enough. Those camp owners are mechanics, plumbers, carpenters, you name it. Jack of all trades."
1544613,DD73,2013-02-28 12:51:00,131,"Of course, taking on a canadian resort unless you're 100% prepared for it just means you're going to lay on your death bed a whole lot sooner.No way would I ever think about it. If you've got 3 kids relying on you, you need to do what's best for them. Period. When they're out of the picture, and you want to work like a slave for no money, then you can consider it."
1544648,Fisherman Ted,2013-02-28 14:13:00,461,"There was a good thread on here maybe 8-10 months ago about the same subject. Excellent thoughts by many regarding jumping into the business, including me a recent owner. I would be happy to talk to you regarding my experiences as I just went though this process and its pretty fresh. Whatever you do don't jump into it blind. Do your homework. Fisherman Ted"
1544668,MrSimon,2013-02-28 15:05:00,922,"Don't listen to this!!!! Buy the camp .... work your butt off and go into big time debt to make it awesome .... open it up in 2014 at ridiculously low prices ..... and give everyone on WalleyeCentral a 25% off coupon. If you do that, I'll totally bring you a case of beer when I come to go fishing. All kidding aside .... we all have different priorities and life goals. Only you can know if something like this is right for you and your family."
1544403,Skywagon,2013-02-28 06:14:00,1106,"You might want to go back and re-read teddi's post. There are plenty of Camps on the market that still have some clients and not the skull and crossbones attached to Bear Trail, (re-naming it ""Fish Galore"" will not help out that situation). Buying a current turnkey operation would be a lot cheaper in the end, then starting from scratch. Just because the initial cost is less than other camps on the market, I will wager that by the time you would get Bear Trail back to snuff and similarly equipped, the other camps will look like a bargain, plus they have clients without the stigma attached.If you would not be relying on the place as a source of income, it would be a nice location for a residence (but that is true of about anywhere up here). Eagle is a great fishing lake and there are lots of deer in that area, the moose are about gone, but the wolves are doing fine. We have friends on Eagle that have a place near Bear Paw, my wife walked through the camp with her friend late last summer and said the place was a mess. Sorry, no pictures."
1544433,1PlaneNut,2013-02-28 07:19:00,2,HI Guys. I just got some pics from the land owner in the US. Not to be confused with the previous scandelous resort operator. The cabins look nice from the outside and the main reception building looks very functional. I guess I'm a sucker for work! Anyhow for some reason I find myself oddly attracted to this place. Maybe my optimistic vision needs a solid reality check when I see the huge amount of work and money needed to make things functional again. I'm wondering if I should have had more kids at this point who could have helped me out... LOL. My three boys would have their work cut out...
1544445,NARDA 1,2013-02-28 07:36:00,636,"1PlaneNut, you can also check out an aerial view of the area on Google Earth."
1544450,LOW1,2013-02-28 07:48:00,2828,"Perhaps you could consider a two or three year lease with an option to buy. That way you you can see what it is like without being overly committed. Or, if after a very rigorous investigation into the finances, condition, etc of the property, you still want to buy, consider buying it through a corporation or through some other mechanism in which you would not be personally liable for the balance of the purchase price if things don't work out. And it may be in your best interest to limit your downpayment as much as possible. You should first consult with an experienced commercial/real estate lawyer regarding this deal and your options. Also, first sit down with a banker (which should not be the banker which has the current loans on the property) and an accountant. Make sure you take off your rose-colored glasses before the meeting and objectively listen to what they say."
1544468,SinOrSwim,2013-02-28 08:19:00,1528,"If you can buy it right, why not that place? Give your customer base a great deal on a trip to let them test the waters again. It will not generate a ton of revenue but will generate interest and get people back in the doors. I'm guessing if most of the people that used to go there had the option of going again for 50% of what it normally cost them, they would take the plunge. Use the first year to generate interest and secure a customer base. Just be up front they are introductory rates etc.It does sound like you are looking at this property and haven't actually been there? Might be time to make a trip. Figure out what they want and cut it in half. Either way, good luck"
1544481,Mike Kansas,2013-02-28 08:43:00,1463,"I would think that if you buy it right and make the proper repairs and updates you will do fine. I also believe that your ""Marketing Plan"" would be the key to your success. Get all the information you can out to past customers, offer past customer discounts, provide top notch service and let your customers know you appreciate them not only as customers but as friends. PROMOTE 12 MONTHS A YEAR. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1544486,MrSimon,2013-02-28 08:47:00,922,"Even though the old place has gotten a lot of bad press .... its still press. People sure know the name and story. Its possible you could use that to your advantage. Don't try and hide the past, use it. Like was said above, people are very forgiving when looking at low prices Everybody knows that running a fishing lodge in Canada is darn risky, incredibly hard work, tough on the family, and a break even at best financial endeavor. But money isn't why people do it! I love your idea of a campground. Lots of guys would love that as a low-cost way of spending a week in Canada. But there are good campgrounds and there are crappy ones. You have to have a good one."
1544506,Golden Eagle,2013-02-28 09:31:00,2642,Anytime we need to make excuses for a potential purchase we need to run away from the deal. Run very fast!
1544527,Hawkfan,2013-02-28 09:52:00,237,"If you can get it for the right price and can afford it, do what makes you happy. Do your research to be sure it's feasible and go for it. Like others have said, if you can get people in that first year at a rock bottom price, it's up to you to get them to come back. You don't hear people on here saying their outfitter is a jerk, but they have been going back for twenty years because the cabin has a nice mattress. They go back because they make a bond with a good owner who treats them right. Any business venture has risk, you just have to decide if the potential benefits outweigh it. The problem is the downturn in the industry. But for all we know you just hit the ""MOTHERLOAD"" mining for gold! Just remember you have the three boys whose future you also have to consider."
1544543,teddi,2013-02-28 10:23:00,349,"If yohr are looking for a camp look at Golden fawn on lac seul, South bay lodge on confederation lake or maybe Timber point on aerbous lake. T he first two are going very cheap. The third one is a very good deal, maybe the best of the lot."
1527685,2746,2013-01-23 11:46:00,3206,gotta gice it to you Magoo.......your persistent!
1527717,magoo79,2013-01-23 12:40:00,25,"I do it because of principle. I made them an offer. Pay back my money ( which they agreed) and I'll go away. They then decided to not get back to me, and made me have to chase them. So they chose option b. I'm single, with no kids. I have more disposable income than most that have a family. I want the 1600 they owe the parties involved in the fishing trip. I also want them to pay back those that saved and put money away to treat themselves to a nice trip to canada. I have plenty of spare time, and I take enjoyment in keeping pressure on them to pay me back. It just upsets me that OK is so far away from ILMike."
1527783,johnboat,2013-01-23 14:47:00,2014,"Get your Postmaster General involved. I paid a guy in Maryland 1295.00 for a lower unit he had not delivered after 2 months. Got the Postmaster involved and he e-mailed me the photo copies of the money orders the dirtball had signed and cashed, within 3 days. Then a week later I recieved a check in the mail thfrom e dirtball. Hope you get you money back. These situations really burn me up."

1529136,troutwater,2013-01-26 11:19:00,299,Keep at them...I applaud your commitment to right the wrong they did to many others. Can't imagine the feeling of driving all the way up there and see the lodge closed with no warning.
1543437,Guest,2013-02-26 07:49:00,0,"Hi All, I am seriously considering taking over the old property. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I would like to do my best to get back all old and lost customers and would bend over backwards to make that happen. I'm a single father of three young boys. We love the outdoors and camping / boating. Family time by dropping a line in the water and flying model planes makes our world go around. I think we would make great hosts and look forward to entertaining and providing you with the best trip possible. After-all, your free time is the most valuable time you have and as such should use it wisely. If you feel like you would be interested in coming back I welcome you to drop me a line at: [email protected]"
1543911,Skywagon,2013-02-27 04:57:00,1106,"1PlaneNut, just some thoughts, since nobody else wants to touch it. I think most people have dreamed of how great it would be to run a Camp, on the lake, fishing all the time...It is probably not quite like the dream in reality, but would at least have had a better chance of being financially viable 20 years ago. Today camps are struggling to fill, less people are coming to fish (for all of the reasons that have been discussed many times before). It is probably not going to get any better. To make matters worse, your dream is to take over a Camp that did the unthinkable to the customer base that they had left. Those customers that did end up coming up last year found other Camps to stay at (probably places they now like better). How many of the old customers would really want to come back to Bear Paw after what they went through? was your question. I would guess few to none. It should be a clue, when the Real Estate company did not even list it by name (I wonder why). My thought would be, if you can afford to buy it and it would not be financialy devestating to your family when it fails, go for it, get it out of your system. If you cannot afford the hit and a failure would negatively impact your family, then don't even think about it. Instead, an option might be to consider buying a place on a lake near the town of Red Lake and get a high paying job at the gold mine. The benefits of living on the lake, without the frustrations. Sorry to be tough, but that is really how it is."
1543938,teddi,2013-02-27 06:33:00,349,I agree. There are a lot of other camps up for sale at 50 cents on the dollar right now. Why buy a head ache?
1543961,v-bay gord,2013-02-27 07:14:00,3168,"I wouldn't touch it until the power was reconnected (and hence inspected), and until I knew what damage has occurred (ie frozen lines, pumps etc). I would then get an opinion from an accountant on viability based on the cash you would need to put in to get started (and there will be a lot) and the realistic amount you might be able to generate from the business. I would then sit back and consider your present lifestyle and how far you are prepared to sacrifice to try and get this thing off the ground. Once you pull the pin, you are in it for the long haul......or like previous owners, till you run out of money. Not trying to discourage you, but it's not all fishing and happy guests handing you money."
1544364,1PlaneNut,2013-02-27 22:20:00,2,Hi Guys. The advice is certainly well received. Still not sure which way to go and need a full inspection of the property before signing anything. Tons of snow here still hindering those efforts. I think building it up from scratch and starting out with a new name would be one option to consider given the horrible history. From what I know the access and property itself is beautiful and the lake has great fishing and hunting around it. Thats a great starting point. I think we would need to take it very slowly in the beginning and probably not open in the first year of ownership until everything was in good working order. As I understand most things have been stolen/removed/sold including the pipes /pumps and appliances! It would be starting from scratch and barely four standing walls. The other option would be to make it into a campground and keep only the more favorable cabins and level the rest. This would result in a property that would be less of a full service experience and hence somewhat less work easing into this type of business. Does anyone have pictures or know somebody that has been to the resort that has pictures of the grounds they would share?
1491899,5richards,2012-10-01 15:42:00,131,Let's continue this thread --- or shift over to World Peace----

1508439,magoo79,2012-11-29 15:29:00,25,"I have an update to the ongoing saga. I have yet to hear anything regarding them paying me the money owed. The only responses I have heard is that they treated me well and blah blah blah. All I have stated is what has happened to me and what I have been told by people in the waldhof area. I have filed a complaint with the Oklahoma State's attorney. I encourage anyone else that has had issues to do the same. After filing with the State's attorney, they reply has been nothing but lies. They told the states attorney that I damaged a lower unit and since I had no bank account they had to garnish my wages. I provided proof of a bank account where I send certified checks for my trips. I also gave permission for the states's attorney to verify info with my company about any wage garnishment that don't exist. They also stated that they don't provide any guide services, however on their own site Casey brags about catches he made while guiding. It doesn't seem at this point that they even know what the truth is anymore. However, I am going to persue getting my money back, even though it may seem it will be unlikely that it will happen. I am doing it on principle. I will not give up until I am made whole, and I encourage others to do the same. Mike."
1508472,Skywagon,2012-11-29 16:59:00,1106,"I may have missed it, but who is carrying the paper on that place? Are there procedings in Canada?"
1508487,magoo79,2012-11-29 17:32:00,25,"When we contacted the Ministry, they said that technically they opened and harder to persue. I will definitely push the issue if they try to reopen. I figured the best course of action for me was to have the case handled in OK. That is where the payments were accepted, and where they were cashed and deposited. I went filled out the complaint online at http://www.oag.state.ok.us/consumer/...complaint.htmlIf the result of this does not make me financially whole, I will also persue further charges with the post office for mail fraud. Mike."
1524021,magoo79,2013-01-15 09:12:00,25,"I know this is an old post, but was just checking to see if anyone has received any of their money back from the lodge? I wasn't able to attend the all canada show this year due to flu. Has anyone seen them, or heard of them trying to reopen? Thanks,Mike"
1524025,v-bay gord,2013-01-15 09:17:00,3168,"Mike....I've heard through the grape vine that the ""owner"" ie. the person that was carrying the loan, was up this past fall and had to pay off three years of back taxes to hang onto it. p.m. me if you wish."

1482885,teddi,2012-09-04 15:59:00,349,if fin and feather and birch dale took all their guests they must have had a lot of empty cabins this summer. i wonder why?
1482906,NARDA 1,2012-09-04 16:39:00,636,"I don't know what you are trying to imply with that statement but there are things you might want to consider.1. How many customers did Bear Trail actually turn over to these lodges? My guess would be not very many.2. I know from talking with the owners at Birch Dale, they had to make arrangements to rent cabins off site because Birch Dale was full.3. There were also Bear Trail customers that didn't come up to Canada because of the situation.4. Several of the Bear Trail customers that stayed at Birch Dale booked for next year before leaving.So if you are implying that there is something wrong with these lodges you are wrong."
1482925,v-bay gord,2012-09-04 17:33:00,3168,"As Casey himself once posted .....""end the madness, and go fishing"" or something like that. Man, it's time to put this to bed. Now, it's a reflection on other lodges who took some of their guests? News flash....there are NO lodges that are full all the time. For the people out there looking to nail Casey to the cross, I think they are likely suffering enough from the fallout of losing a business. Maybe small business folk can relate to having financial stress. Perhaps enough to see why a person who had many loyal customers (couldn't have been too bad a person or family) went off the deep end and ended up doing ""stuff"" none of us will defend. It was bad and I'm sure some price will be paid. Was it premeditated...not likely.....just a case of running scared. I'm not defending their actions, but consider being in their shoes.....it's not pretty."
1482946,2746,2012-09-04 18:36:00,3206,"X2! Like Forest Gump says ""stuff happens"". Time to file it away as a life experience and move on."
1483542,del-yakker,2012-09-05 20:02:00,6,"we were one of those that were accomodated by the generosity of others, hats off to Birch Dale - they took care of us."
1483561,Guest,2012-09-05 20:38:00,0,Thanks Gord for the voice of reason. It is easy for people to judge others but human nature makes it difficult to realistically consider what they would do in the other man's shoes. I think we are all doing our best in what are definitely trying times!
1491360,tootie,2012-09-29 13:46:00,1,"We prepaid 1500.00 Feb. 2012. We were some of their loyal customers. Our dates were Last week in May and first week in June. We were called and told it was just a temporary closure but when we called them, talked on face book to them. We were told we were the most rude and impatient friends/guests they had ever had. We truly thought they were our friends. They have been to our house stayed with us, dined with us, etc. We lost alot of money, but by far the worst was the loss of friends, and we loved the boys very much."
1491494,vailhusker,2012-09-30 10:07:00,4,"I agree it is time to put this to bed, and hopefully the judicial process will do it. You say you are not defending them, but you are. What Casey did was premeditated and he deserves whatever he gets. He continued to solicit business and money from people knowing full well he was not going to provide the service that was promised. I'm sure there are a lot of lodges that have had financial struggles but did not resort to swindling money from people that were considered loyal customers. Adversity doesn't build character, it reveals it."
1491631,115 optimax,2012-09-30 21:58:00,650,Yup! This Casey guy sounds like a real .Shouldn't be put to rest until everybody gets their money back!!And if everyone gets their money back it should go on after that too.
1491774,tv4fish,2012-10-01 11:12:00,2694,"WOW -- If they treated you like that - I don't think I would consider loosing them as friends, much of a loss at all."
1476167,Mike Borger,2012-08-18 06:01:00,1554,"Such a sad situation, here's hoping everyone affected is compensated somehow.What gets me was the aggressive mouthy response from the owner in the previous thread. The guy must be just utterly brazen, can't believe his attitude.People like that usually get what's coming to them."
1476519,vailhusker,2012-08-19 11:29:00,4,"Ten Horse, It was pretty surreal. First off, you've just finished a 16 hour drive (although I had first driven to Denver from Vail, flown to KC and then drove to Canada - so about 24 hours at that point) so you are just in disbelief.. these things happen, but usually to other people. Then you get so pissed you can't even see straight. My brother actually had been the point person, talking with Bear Trail. Two weeks prior to our trip, he was still responding to emails about how the fishing was going this summer - so he was even more livid because he was being flat out lied to. Fin and Feather definitely came to the rescue. They had no idea we were coming, but they got us into cabins right away, had boats ready to go and got us on the water. We were a little put off to be fishing a completely new area of Eagle Lake (since we had been fishing the west arm for more than 20 years), but once you start fishing, it kind of washes away the bad taste in your mouth."
1476522,wallydave,2012-08-19 11:46:00,2151,For this operator to respond to emails about the fishing knowing the gates were closed is fraud plain and simple!! Fin and Feather sure shows the kind of class operator that deserves our business! Its good to know there are good people in the world!
1476612,vailhusker,2012-08-19 16:25:00,4,amen to that. Kim and Bruce run a great lodge.. I'm sure we'll make another trip to the West Arm in the future and I'll keep the Vermillion Bay Lodge on the list!
1476625,troutwater,2012-08-19 16:43:00,299,"Wow just a sad situation. Its quite easy for people to sit and say now that it was a scam they were running, but hindsight is always 20/20. I'm not sure how long bear trail has been open, but it would be hard for me not to jump on a deal like that at a sport show. My friend and I are looking for a place to go next year for his first Canada trip. I will for sure be checking out Fin and Feather just because of the stories people have shared here."
1476725,wallydave,2012-08-19 20:10:00,2151,The best way to reward good behavior is to recognize it and support it!! I checked the Fin and Feather website. Things look great and it sounds like the folks that run the camp know how to look out for people that like fishing Ontario!
1476822,tv4fish,2012-08-20 07:52:00,2694,THAT is the same hope that I have - I hope he/they get nailed big time.
1479498,wishow,2012-08-26 06:09:00,19,I started the other thread. He told me that I would be taken care of no matter what. We did not hear anything despite repeated efforts of contacting them until the day before we were to leave. By that time I had sent him a email several days prior requesting the refund of my $300 deposit due to the lack of communication on his part. I handed this over to the credit card company 2 months ago with no resolution thus far. My last talk with him was after the other thread was started and he yelled at me for spreading false information! I simply asked a question about rumors I had heard since he wouldn't answer my calls.http://www.facebook.com/chandaandcasey.dameron In case anyone that was cheated would like to leave them a message.
1482812,Sidge61,2012-09-04 12:37:00,59,I see now they have taken down their Facebook page. I hope all anglers get their refunds and that the owners of Bear Trail Lode get whats coming to them!!!

1474381,vailhusker,2012-08-13 14:41:00,4,"just returned from vermillion bay. bear trail was supposed to be our lodge, but after 16 hours on the road, we were informed by a sign posted on the gate that they would not be able to fulfill our reservation. in fact, they never even openned up the camp this year. they did go up and sold off their inventory earlier this summer. fin and feather was able to accommodate us, and even honoured our deposit at bear trail. so if you've been shafted by bear trail, fin and feather is a great alternative."

1474557,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-08-13 22:39:00,235,"More than likely it is a business with poor cash flow and/or struggling just to keep the lights on. It is a red flag to be sure, though."
1474573,bellbuoy,2012-08-14 04:24:00,490,Hats off to Fin & Feather!
1475735,kcguy68,2012-08-16 20:46:00,51,"I too was scammed by Bear Trail Lodge. I have filed a fraudulent case with Visa. They are going to work to try and recover my $600 deposit. I have also contacted a local television station in Oklahoma to see if they would be interested in doing an investigative report. It appears the owners live in the Tulsa area. If I hear back from the television station, I will reach out to find others that were impacted by Bear Trail. My party ended up staying at Fin & Feather on the Eagle River. Great experience, great people. We will not let this experience prevent us from trekking back up to Eagle Lake again in the future. It is one of my favorite spots in the world."
1475742,NARDA 1,2012-08-16 21:14:00,636,Best of luck in the recovery of your deposit. Most of all I'm glad to hear that your negative experience was turned into a positive. Eagle Lake is a GREAT place.
1476077,NWwalleye,2012-08-17 18:51:00,223,"I hope that it all works out for you .. He scammed a few people,..I am sure if you ask, you will get multiple people responding...."
1471703,ablewis007,2012-08-07 10:13:00,14,"Mike,This is a huge bummer. I do hope you are able to get your refund. Don't however let this get in the way of a great trip to Eagle Lake. Life is too short. I am coming up this weekend and staying at Vermilion Bay Lodge. Gord and Susanne Bastabel are as trustworthy as they come and they provide great accommodations at a reasonable price. Check them out at:http://www.vermilionbaylodge.com/Andy"
1471746,NWwalleye,2012-08-07 11:20:00,223,"Agreed .....Still come up to Eagle Lk. There are many great places to stay.. If you try someone might have an opening, that can accommodate your group ."
1472140,Wyn,2012-08-08 07:31:00,112,"Of course the trouble is.....what do they have to go after? Likely they just cut and their assets are non-existent. I'm sure all they have is debt. Lawyers aren't cheap and I could see it easily being hard to gain anything, even if it is there, after lawyer expense. If I was going to go down this route I would assume from the beginning that it was just out of principle and may in fact cost me more."
1472445,magoo79,2012-08-08 18:27:00,25,"Well, I did just receive an email saying that they are closed. They suggested that everyone go to south shore lodge. They said that they will pay everyone back, however there was no timeline given. We will see what happens. I'm trying to be patient. This was the money I had set aside for canada this year and I don't have time to make other arrangements as my vacation week starts next week. I have had another bear trail lodge customer contact me, they have been speaking with Canadian authorities and are going to look into it. Not sure what they can do, but we'll see. Mike."
1472467,IA JOE,2012-08-08 19:03:00,35,If you have the cash I would be on the phone looking for another lodge/camp. One short phone call is all it could take and you'd be set for a great week on the water! I find the pay in advance discount a little odd as I have not seen it offered on any of the web sites and I have been to a few. Maybe the advance payment discount offer should be a warning sign.
1472594,Shellback,2012-08-09 05:33:00,8083,"I wonder if you sent a check through the mail, it would be considered mail fraud? That's a criminal offense in the US, not sure about Canada."
1472623,tv4fish,2012-08-09 07:00:00,2694,"Magoo: If I were you, I would NOT ""try to be patient"". I would be pressing them to get your money back to you immediately. I'm afraid the longer that you are ""patient"" --the less chance you will have of getting your money back. Good luck."
1472627,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-08-09 07:08:00,235,"I bet if you explained your predicament to other lodges, they might offer a competitive price...some might anyhow. Lots of options on Eagle...God bless the free market."
1472629,Guest,2012-08-09 07:09:00,0,Sounds like you have one more stop to make when you are in Canada. Go to whereever that email was sent from and collect your money.
1472641,SinOrSwim,2012-08-09 07:37:00,1528,"Magoo, are you out the whole cost or just your deposit? I saw your post about the prepay option."
1470886,magoo79,2012-08-05 14:58:00,25,"Hello everyone, I found this site while trying to find info about bear trail lodge closing down. Here is the link I found. https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...d.php?t=198065Well, It appears they were responding to people then. I have now been trying to get in touch with them and they refuse to call me back, or respond to my email. I was set to go up there next week, and I was making a final confirmation to make sure everything went smooth. For the last month I could not get in touch with them. I called Bobby's Corner in Vermilion bay, and a local guide I have used for years. They confirmed they are closed and have been selling equipment as early as last fall. If anyone has any contact info, or knows more info how to possibly get some of their money back it would be appreciated. I am in the process of filing mail fraud charges with the postal inspector and the police. Thanks,Mike"
1470945,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-08-05 17:29:00,235,"Good luck. I expect they will shut this thread down...kind of a sensitive topic. As someone with no stake in the matter, I observed a lot of people who posted about not knowing what the heck was going on with Bear Trail. Bear Trail posted nothing on their website nor did they put any notice on their answering machine greeting. Threads would get heated with people worrying about their reservations, questioning the operation, then the owner would come on to post that they were handling everything as best they could (apparently they were out of electricity for a long while). The Bear Trail owner assured WC that those with reservations would be transferred to nearby lodges and that deposits would not be lost.I don't know the particulars, but I do know that Bear Trail did a poor job of communication throughout this deal. By their radio silence, they allowed Internet rumors to control the message.I hope you are accomodated with your trip and don't lose money. Good luck!"
1470962,Bobbajig,2012-08-05 18:20:00,24,"Magoo,I hope that you can find accomidations for your trip. I know from reading about this that Bear Trail Lodge had been in contact with Birchdale Lodge to accept their clients due to their closure. If not I truly hope that you will receive a full refund from Bear Trail Lodge."
1470964,NARDA 1,2012-08-05 18:21:00,636,Magoo79 I sent you a PM.
1471086,magoo79,2012-08-05 22:00:00,25,"I contacted birchdale lodge, as I read about bear trail sending clients to them from another thread. When i did contact them I discussed with them about my vacation issue. Birchdale said that they were getting reservations from beartrail but they haven't been able to contact them like they fell off the face of the earth. The last reservation that birchdale had from beartrail ran into some issues. Beartrail never sent the payment for the trip, and the client that went to birchdale had to pay out of pocket to them for the trip. Their only recourse is to get the money back from beartrail to reimburse them for the extra money they had to pay out. I have found 4 possible addresses where they have lived. I'm sure 3 are old addresses, one has to be the current address if a person that was swindled by the owners want them. They just have to PM me and I will provide it. Thanks,Mike."
1471093,v-bay gord,2012-08-05 22:58:00,3168,"Apparently people are arriving at the closed gate, still unaware......."
1471146,magoo79,2012-08-06 07:34:00,25,"It is a shame how this was handled. Gas is not cheap, when I calculated the gas for my trip it was 600.00 to get there and back from the Chicago area. THey had everyone's email address, I know for a fact they had mine for sure. How hard would it have been to send out a mass email letting people know ahead of time so they can make alternate plans or to setup some kind of payment plan to get some of their money back. It's bad for those that put a 150.00 deposit down, It's even worse for those that took their prepay special for the free guided day by prepaying for the trip in January, when Casey and Chanda knew they were going to be closing and were already selling their assets off at the resort. Mike"
1471147,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-08-06 07:37:00,235,"If what you say is true, the only possible reason that they wouldn't proactively reach out to everyone and let them know is that they have no intention of paying."
1471153,magoo79,2012-08-06 07:55:00,25,That is exactly what it looks like is happening here. They seem to have taken everyone's money and ran....... for now.
1471693,NWwalleye,2012-08-07 09:58:00,223,"They was a lengthy thread about this several weeks ago ..It was locked and cleaned up (I agree it was getting to long).Definitely wrong on how things were handle. It seemed kind of shady the way some guests were accommodate earlier and other have no idea on what is going on. Or can not get in contact with the owners.If, I were a registered guest and had been ripped off... I would be finding legal advice and go after them (If, I could !!)....Good luck ... I hope all works out for you .."
