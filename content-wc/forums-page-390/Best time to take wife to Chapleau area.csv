1545105,QuietTimes,2013-03-01 11:43:00,6,"Hey thanks for the reply. Well in this case I'm the wife... and I grew up in the Timmins area so I know all about black flies. And here in south western Ontario we live in the woods. Mosquitoes are a constant companion and not just at sunset. All day long. So hubby may be the one complaining about the black flies. We will pack pic, bug spray etc. When I was still at home I had a young sister who was about 4 or 5 at the time. My mom slathered her with a combination of olive oil and citronella. Then out she would go to play. When she came in she was covered in black flies - stuck to her. But no bites... LOL"
1545226,Slushfish,2013-03-01 13:56:00,263,"We have a cabin South of Chapleau and spend lots of time there. My favorite times are; Memorial week, can be the best fishing, weather pending. Last year mosquitoes were quite bad. Have had snow. August is very nice and consistent. Can be hot. September is beautiful weather, good fishing, no bugs. One thing is for sure there... nothing is 100% Good Luck , Slushfish"
1545230,QuietTimes,2013-03-01 14:03:00,6,"Goes back to the old saying... ""A bad day fishing is better than a good day at work!"" Almost four months to wait....."

1546025,Golden Eagle,2013-03-03 12:48:00,2642,"In 1961, I took my wife to the Chapleau area for 7 weeks of camping and fishing. It was her first fishing/camping experience. Our vehicle was a 1960 Austin Healey, bugeye, Sprite. We hauled all our camping gear, fishing gear, small stove, lantern, clothing, and a 7 1/2 HP Evinrude OB. Our tent consisted of two army surplus shelter halves. No floor - not good.We've returned for many fishing trips since and will be celebrating our 55th wedding anniversary in June. We found lots of skeeters, followed by flys as the weather warmed up."

1546037,Paul H,2013-03-03 13:17:00,1232,"As one who had a 69 MGB and worked at a dealership for a few; I have to ask ""How in the heck did you have room for all the spare parts ? Plus wasn't it all most all dirt roads then?"
1546158,Golden Eagle,2013-03-03 17:36:00,2642,"I bought a small roof rack, suction cups, braces and rigged up a carrier behind the seats, attached to the bumper on bottom. Placed a folded 8 x 10 tent (that I forgot to mention) on the rack, stacked the OB and other items on rack and folded the tent over before tying down. Spare tire was tied on top of the stack. When we bought groceries my wife had to carry them on her lap.Going up the Chapleau Road we got stuck in heavy, fresh gravel. Road workers came to our rescue and pushed us until we found thinner gravel. Dirt roads weren't a huge problem, except for huge rocks which had my wife out of the car and guiding me over them without hitting bottom. Pretty sure we had 6 1/2"" from bottom of Sprite to road. Short and narrow wheelbase helped. Bought Sprite in April 1961 and the other couple bought a Sprite the next day and joined us on the trip. Cherry red for us and BRG for them. In December 1961 I traded for a 1961 TR3. Wish I still had that one.Paid around 32.9 cents per gallon for fuel and got close to 40 mpg on highway. We paid $2 a day for boat rental and anywhere from zero to $2 a day for a campsite. The other couple headed for home after about 3 1/2 weeks. Wife and I stuck it out mainly because we had subrented our $50 a month house. We had no place to go.We had no idea there could be so many mosquitoes in such a small province as Ontario.We corresponded with family members by receiving our mail locally through general delivery. We still enjoy reading the mail and cards that we sent back home.We had more of an experience than a vacation fishing trip. A huge plus was that we established several long lasting friendships."
1546162,Golden Eagle,2013-03-03 17:41:00,2642,"In 1974 I found a 1960 bugeye in Nashville for $500. It was in very good condition and included a hard top. There was no starter and I couldn't get it running. I had a driver and $500 in my pocket, but didn't pull the trigger. That was a huge mistake. Sprites were great rides. Weight distribution of 51/49 made for great handling. Pretty sure I could still get myself into a Sprite, but have no idea how I'd get back out without a couple of strong, grown men."

1160976,jaggersr,2010-01-17 16:45:00,44,"Wanted to get some others opinions. I have been going hunting and fishing in the Chapleau area either the 3rd week of May or middle of August for about 20 years now. This year I have bought a truck camper and my wife is going to go. We will be taking our 14' v and camper and fishing from Aubrey Lake to Chapleau, probably go to Wakami lake and spend 4 or 5 days as well. All and all I we are planning on 10 days in the bush. targeting mostly walleye and pike. My question is if you could go anytime from Memorial day until mid July when would you go? From what I remember from my Spring trips the flies will be out heavy. They are not to bad in mid August. What about July? Thanks in advance for your opinions."
1161052,lobo1,2010-01-18 02:17:00,734,From what I understand it depends on the year - but one of our trips to Chapleau was mid June about ten years ago and the flies were the worst I have ever experienced. The owner of the outposts/cabins also said it was the worst he had seen in 30 years. I would be leaning to the end of the summer - early fall if it were me. Flies dont ever seem nearly as bad NW of Thunder Bay where we go now. Good work - getting the wife to go - now hopefully you can get a low bug week!!
1172885,justatrollin,2010-02-28 09:43:00,32,"I have gone to Wakami a few times over the past couple years, spring and fall. We go around the middle to the end of May, last year the got a few inches of snow the day before we got there. But the walleye fishing was great. We also go around the middle of September, the whitefish are really biting there around that time. It may get a little cold at night, but there usually are no bugs in sight. Oh yeah if you like northern, there are plenty of them in there too. I did hear that it is no good in the summer but I have never tried. If you want some pictures let me know."
1172900,celticbass1,2010-02-28 10:17:00,67,"I would go sometime near early or mid July. The Black flies are gone by then, the weather is warm, and the fishing is consistent. Just my two cents worth."
1173369,justatrollin,2010-03-01 15:43:00,32,"The group I went with has been going annually 2 to 3 times a year for over 20 years. When I asked them about going in the middle of summer, they told me it was not worth it. The reason for this is that they knew a trip that far north for me, had to be worth it. Meaning catch lots of fish, eat lots of fish, and bring a limit home. Like I said, I have gone at the end of May, it is still cool at nights and mild during the days. There were some mosquitos, but didn't see a black fly anywhere. And the fishing was hot. But if you want hot weather, mediocre fishing, and are more interested in camping and relaxing, then July it is. We stayed in Birch Hill its the first group of campsites, there is one site right on the water with a nice log where you can tie your boat up, if you don't want to pay the dock fee. Also it is on the path to the fish cleaning station. Oh yeah don't be jealous about the size of the northern pike, its HUGE."
1173376,celticbass1,2010-03-01 16:12:00,67,"Been going for 18 years and I'm telling you July is very consistent. Last two years had trips in early to mid July and last year had two 100 plus smallmouth days the year before that two 100 plus walleye days with several days of 30-40 fish. I guess we can all have different experiences but I've been in May,June, July and August and July is the month for me. I will admit I've been to some lakes in July and had very bad luck but I think it was the lake more than the time of year."
1173377,wolverine fan,2010-03-01 16:14:00,71,"My answer to this starts with a question, ""do you want her to go?"" if you want her to go each year then go when the flies are not out and if you dont want her to go..........Ha have fun!"
1173607,Knot Tellin,2010-03-02 08:55:00,386,We have always went mid August. To keep from getting ate alive.
1543996,QuietTimes,2013-02-27 08:21:00,6,"We went to Wakami the end of July and again in August 2012. We got reports from other campers that the fishing was not bad until this huge thunderstorm came through the night we arrived. After that only the pike were biting. We were there for seven days and managed only one walleye. When we went back in August things were not much better - caught only two in four days of fishing. Pike were still biting. I could chalk that up to maybe we are not good fisherman, but in talking to others found out they were only catching pike. We got the only pickerel. This year we are going the last week in June. I can deal with the flies as long as the fish are biting. But if you don't care about the fishing and just want sun, peace and quiet August was great. Mosquitos at sunset but the rest of the time beautiful. BTW in July there were these shiny green bugs - about a quarter inch long - that were everywhere. Didn't bite but were inside the camper crawling on everything."
1545079,Pymbet,2013-03-01 10:55:00,42,"We fish just northwest of Chapleau every year and my wife grew up in the UP of Michigan and lived with balck flies and mosquitos. That said, I never take her up before July 10. Our window is usually July 20 to August 20. Best balance of weather, bugs and fishing in that area. We do spend as much time going after northerns as walleye.If its just the guys, and walleye are the main target, then mid-June on a year with an early spring is optimal. But that is too early most years torisk on a happy wife."
