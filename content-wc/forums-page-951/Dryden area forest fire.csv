An emergency area order gives the MNR the legal authority to close roads or evacuate members of the public if their safety is at risk, reported West Fire Region fire information officer Deb MacLean.As there are various roads leading into Dryden Fire Number 10 from the surrounding townships, the MNR decided to include all eight townships in the emergency area order, so if needed, the road closures in the general area of the fire could be expanded.Excellent progress was made on fighting the fire Monday, said MacLean. ""Thanks to cool temperatures and light winds, the ranger crews were able to complete the first pass around the entire fire, using a combination of hose lines, hand tool lines and bulldozer lines,"" she said.""Crews will continue to consolidate their lines and suppress the numerous hot spots along the perimeter.""The MNR is enforcing the emergency area order in the immediate area of the fire to ensure the safety of the public and the safety of fire fighters. As a result, property owners located at the Amesdale and Good Lake subdivisions are encouraged to remain away from the area due to the unpredictable nature of the weather and because of the fire suppression activities (including helicopters, vehicles and large numbers of fire suppression staff) who are working out of the Little Amesdale Lake area. Fire managers will re-assess the situation every evening, so residents are encouraged to call the Dryden district fire management headquarters for an update.The Richan Road is closed to all through traffic between the Henderson Loop Road and the junction of Little Amesdale Lake and the old CNR Roadbed. People who own property along the road, between these two points are being allowed to access their properties.MNR conservation officers are located at the barricades on either end of this stretch of road. Residents must stop and sign in and report when they are leaving the area. All through traffic, including those people wishing to travel to the Good and Amesdale Lake subdivisions is being rerouted to use the Camp 1 Road. All industry and recreation traffic is also being diverted to the Camp 1 Road.There are barricades on the Lorne Lake Road, and all traffic is restricted along this road north of Rugby Creek. As well, there is a barricade at the junction of the Camp 1 Road and the Williams Lake Road (aka 20 mile creek road) and traffic is restricted along the Williams Lake Road south into the Good Lake area.An information board was set up between the two entrances at the fairgrounds Monday. The public is encouraged to check out the latest information on Dryden 10 or phone 937-7330 for an update.Elsewhere in the West Fire Region, Monday was a quieter day in comparison to the weekend where several new fires were reported each day. A new fire was reported in the Kenora District at the Trus Joist construction site where a large pile of pallets started on fire.The Kenora fire department called the MNR fire headquarters in Kenora to alert them that the fire was sending up a smoke column. A helicopter and fire ranger crew were dispatched but no problems were reported. In two other Dryden fires, Dryden 11 was re-mapped by fire crews on the ground Monday and is now listed as 13.5 hectares. It is classified as under control and no problems are anticipated.Dryden 13 was declared out Monday."
