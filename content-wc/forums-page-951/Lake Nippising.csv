Can anyone give me some info on the camp, fishing, and any other tips that might be helpful. We are planning on focusing on walleye, perch, and smallmouth. Also, is it legal to bring flats of nightcrawlers across the border?"

It was my first trip to Canada,back in '98.We hit Smallies,Walleye's and 3 nice Musky were taken too.This is in the southern arm,and in the island's the fish were hungry.We went in Sept. though,but I think this lake is a gem.From what I remember,the honey hole was a weed bed,just off a ""Gull island"",as they refer to them. The gull's have their favorite spot's,as we all do but some frequent certain one's.Look for some weed's,as I think they're as scarce as snow in June,but in some shallow's the weeds choke out the sun.Look for a better mix.Look for that subtle group of weeds,near some rock.I wish I was goin'.Good luck,and do not!!! go without leeches!!!!!Minnow's,yeah thet're good,but a leech,work's wonder's."
