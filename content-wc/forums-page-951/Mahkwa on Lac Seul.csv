520260,Guest,2002-06-04 15:36:00,0,"Hey trigger! please tell me somebody has landed a laker in Bray.That's the one thing I've missed up there. We were in Bray one day last year, a very windy day, and fish were stacked up big-time on the bottom, 60-80 feet deep. As we drifted thru jigging for lakers we pulled up a 4 pound whitefish and about a 5 pound slimy from the deeps. That really depressed me. We plan to try for lakers again this year so any baiting tips would also help.We do spend some time up in the Bishop's rock area for'eyes' working the small islands and bays up there. The dead fish rule does stink. The ""Big"" Berkley reps were up last year and were busted for swimmers in the well. That's the only part enjoyable about the rule we know so far.Leeches and large phelpps floaters do seem to be one of our favorites.I plan on going all artificial this year with jigs and powerbaits.Good luck.Guide#7"
520261,Guest,2002-06-05 06:42:00,0,Sorry Tigger (Trigger spelling on message 10) bad 'eyes' on the screen. Still like fishin' though7 out
520269,Guest,2002-06-05 12:51:00,0,"Zugbug,I'll be up there on the 29th. First time at Lac Seul and Mahkwa. I'll be with 3 others staying in one of the houskeeping cabins. Stop by for a cold one and a chat. We have a 16 ft backtroller with a 25 merc. and a bass boat (kid calls it a musky boat) with a 200 on it.Regards,Dave"
520270,zugbug,2002-06-05 19:55:00,67,"Dave,We will be pulling in around noon on the 30th, I will be in the Warrior 1890 with 175 Merc. Can't Miss me (Large Dude) I am looking forward to a great trip. Their is 12 in our group and we have fished lac Seul for the last 6 years and always have a blast. Incredible Walleye fishing and Good Pals, not always in that order. I look forward to meeting you, Just ask the gang where Spike is. We'll get you on some fish if you need.Zugbug"

520272,Guest,2002-06-07 13:59:00,0,"Back from Lac Seul last nite around 8 pm and a great trip it was. Personal highs for eye's were 27 1/2, 27 5/8, 28, and 29 1/4. Our group of 5 caught all our 25+"" fish but one on cranks in 4-8' of water. We fished plenty of jigs and floaters, but the big girls wanted some wood. Water is up about 2 feet. water temp on the main lake was a nipply 43.8 degrees on 6/1. By 6/5, the main lake was in the low to mid 50s. Bays started in the high 50s and by the end the highest I saw was 62. My dad parked my boat on the west side of camp temporarily and didnt get it up on the sand real good and had to go wading to get it. My stomach is still sore from laughing at the story (I was still out fishing when it happened). Apparently, 50 degree water is a mite cold. Weather was good, one rainy period one evening. I heard a guy on the phone telling his wife that he reached over to grab a 18"" walleye and a gator grabbed the walleye at the same time. He said he is ##### lucky to have all his digits. #502 is under construction, expect to get stopped a half dozen times or more. They are blasting rock out of the ditches. Only saw 1 moose the entire trip, but just about wore it on the Ford. Leeches did not seem to work that well, most wallys were on minnows or cranks. It really seemed like a temperature game as dark bottomed bays produced the best. Only a couple smallies."
520257,Guest,2002-05-15 11:27:00,0,Does anybody fish out of Mahkwa in the middle part of Lac Seul. I would be anxious to share some spots. I will be fishing up there June 1-5.
520258,Guest,2002-05-15 22:17:00,0,"we have a 6/26/02 reservation and have been there many times.nice area of the lake. not many other lodges near there to bug ya.how far do you venture from the camp? we go 1/2 hour or so in any direction to hit some of our spots. north and east and south to vaughan are some nice spots. can you give some landmark specifics to try? the ""wall"" is always good in the evenings we have learned.use the raps in the sand shallows late evening and have some fun."
520259,Guest,2002-05-17 14:21:00,0,"This will be our 16th year up there. We always fish the first week in June. I would say we generally stay within a 45 minute drive. The fish are in the bays a lot of the time for us, thus we concentrate on shallow areas near spawning grounds as well as the traditional spots. We seldom fish Vaughn anymore. Too many people down there. By the ""wall"", I am assuming you mean the big sand bank across from camp? Funny, we havent actually fished walleyes there, we have tagged some really nice pike there. Windigo, if the water is warm can produce some great fishing. If it is cold, it will be barren. Two Points can be good, but the last few years it has cooled down and produced only small 'eyes. Have you been to Bray? It is different than the rest of the lake, clear and deep. Big pike and lakers (although I have personally failed on the lakers) are fairly common there. There is a point, I believe it is the second point north of the landing, that can be absolutely terrific ('eyes). We have really stacked them up a few times. Have you fished the eagles nest near Windigo? That can be dynamite. The bay just to the east of the entrance to Vaughn (Vaughn Bay maybe on the maps), has a channel and some 14' water back in it. That has produced many a memory. Adios bay to the NW has produced well from time to time. What have you found works the best? For eyes, I fish jigs and cranks quite a bit, some of our guys (there are 5 of us, Dad-son-son, and Dad-son) fish rigs and do quite well. My boat fishes pike/walleyes about 50/50, the other boat 30% Pike/70% Walters. For pike, muskie spinnerbaits seem to be the best tickets with a close second to big minnow style cranks. How have you done size-wise? It seems hard to break that 20lb pike barrier and that 10lb wally barrier, but we do pretty well getting close. fishing was getting better every year until last year when it was down a little (probably weather)."
520262,zugbug,2002-05-19 16:35:00,67,"Try the bay by twin points I believe its called, long bay with 2-3 Islands in the middle of it. The bay is quite narrow and the front end seems guarded by a partially submerged forest. try around the last island, and the point on the right at the entrance of the bay. This bay is also great for early season snot rockets. Check out tractor flats also, This is the shoreline just north of eagle island. Can't miss the rusting out Cat half way up the bank.I'll be up there starting 6/30/02. Let me know how you do.Zugbug e"
520263,Guest,2002-05-21 06:43:00,0,"Zugbug-I have fished two points just about every trip. Our motor took a crap on us when we were way back in there one year and we had to use the electric to get to the mouth. Do you know where the old lady is buried on the left as you go in? We parked there and waited for help. Funny part was, we just hammered the boots ('eyes fight like you hooked a boot) off the back of our dead boat as it was parked. Right in front of the old docks. That used to be an old commercial fishing operation I guess. Some fascinating history up there isnt there? Lately 2 points has slowed down for us, we will give it a shot again this year. I have fished the old Cat a few times with little success. WHY was that guy driving that thing there??? Have you had much success in either Adios or Warship? Both have been good for us in different years, especially Adios. Big area, lotsa boots and snot rockets. How long have you been going there? We have been amazed at the total disregard for rocks that we have seen lately. Most people just fly around like there isn't a rock in the lake. The other thing is, we really hate the dead fish rule. We don't sort (who would ever need to??) but having dead fish in your live well just sucks."
520264,zugbug,2002-05-22 19:33:00,67,"Tigger, Last year we really hammered the boots back in the bay by 2 points, Quite a few Smallies too. This will be my 4th or 5th trip to Mahkwa and my 6th or 7th trip to lac seul. One year we had a lot of fish off the old Cat mostly smaller under slot fish (eaters) We fish Vaughn often as our first trip there was an out of the world fishig experience, Draggin Shad Raps and Wally Divers We could barely move with out bringing in a walleye. Hundreds and Hundreds of Boots it was a thing to see. We brought a Lac Seul First Timer and probably ruined him for life on walleye fishing. It was someting I don't think a person can expect again. In 4 days we had well over a thousand boots and God knows how many Slimers. We try Vaughn every trip now, but have never had the same action, but always catch fish. We have not ever fished Bray Lake but have talked about it from time to time. Adios bay also we have not tried nor warship. I am now in Cleveland and my maps are back home in Minnesota so I'm not sure where they are, but I will check it first chance I get. This year we are going for a week and are looking for a few more spots to try. As for the Rocks, it takes my butt cheeks a week or so to stop cramping up (repeated clenchings) after the trip. So far, so good, but feel it's a matter of time.Spike(zugbug)"
520265,Guest,2002-05-23 07:08:00,0,"Zugbug-Email me at [email protected] and I can point out some good spots as well as some rocks. We try new places every year, half of the fun is going somewhere new and figuring out the fish. We wont fish Vaughn once this year (it wont be open). Usually we fish it very little. There is no doubt you catch fish there though, it lives up to its reputation. Lotsa people though."
520266,Guest,2002-05-23 07:09:00,0,"Zugbug, after today, i wont be back at my computer until Tues."
520267,Guest,2002-06-03 15:23:00,0,"Any new reports from anyone? Leaving Friday, can't wait.Thanks"
520268,zugbug,2002-06-03 20:12:00,67,"Eyedude, Look on Thursday for a post from Tigger, He comes back I believe on Wednesday the 5th. Hopefully he will be back before you leave. If not good luck and let us know how you did on your return. I leave on the 28th of June.Zugbug"
