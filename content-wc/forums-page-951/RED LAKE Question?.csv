520958,SWeed,2002-06-02 19:26:00,66,Nobody fishes Red Lake?
520959,NateW,2002-06-02 20:48:00,96,We caught a couple lakers on the west end while staying at Bow Narrows Camps. Most guy in camp were taking them out of Pipestone Bay. Haven't been there in four years so I could tell you much more than that.
520960,redlaker,2002-06-03 10:23:00,0,Trout fishing on Red lake been pretty tough for a long while the fish population is down our MNR has asked that all lake trout be released due to lack of fish.
520961,SWeed,2002-06-05 00:00:00,66,"Thanks for the info... Wasn't interested in keeping any, just enjoy fishing for them. adds a little vaiety to the fishing, and love the tug they give a trolling rod.... Thanks again..."
520962,Major Mondo,2002-06-06 20:03:00,1,"Sweed,I've fished Red Lake for many years. Here's a couple of suggestions for you to help in your pursuit of those Lakers (and YES, they're still hungry and willing to bite!) Matter of fact, my niece on her first trip to Canada caught a 36"" Laker on her initial outing. We took a picture and released it. Maybe its beginner luck, but what the heck!The big boys are up in Pipestone bay towards the NW section - depending upon time of year, but in July, keep your electronics searching for fish in 46-59' of water. I'd suggest a #44 hammer plated spoon with 2-3oz bottom bouncers. Also, one of the best guides for Lakers on Red Lake can be contacted at Sunset Lodge. His name is Ean and he put us on fish. This guy definitely knows the lake and has a reputation of finding them. Good luck.Major Mondo"
