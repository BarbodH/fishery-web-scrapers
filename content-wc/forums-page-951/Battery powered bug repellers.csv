They are powered by a AA battery and claim to repel mosquitoes. Do they also work on black flies? Deer flies?

521197,Guest,2002-06-09 06:25:00,0,I bought one for myself and one for my Dad. I stayed at my trailer in northern Michigan on my way to Canada and tried it that evening . It didn't work. Then on to a fly-in trip in northwestern Ontario. It did'nt work. On the Canada trip we only had bugs bad one evening out of 8 days and that is when I tried it. When I returned home I asked my Dad how his worked and he said the same. I sent both of them back to where I purchased them for a full refund. They didn't have any problem taking them back. Wish they did work for me.
