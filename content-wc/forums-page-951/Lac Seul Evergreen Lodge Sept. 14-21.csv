520861,Tom,2002-05-29 19:17:00,1063,Staying at Evergreen sept 14-21 what are the best techniques to cath northern during this time and do you know any good spots?This will be our first to Lac Seul.
520862,Guest,2002-05-31 06:25:00,0,Fall will be crank bait time off the rockbars etc. Pike will be feeding on ciscos and other large baitfish; use large chubs etc if you like to use live bait. We get lots of walleye stollen that time of year. Watch my reports on www.justfishontario.com for a running update.

For anyone else you can see what's happening in northwestern Ontario by logging in to http://www.justfishontario.com/reports.htm Plus they got a lot of other good stuff, I liked their walleye and muskie forums. Those boys, well you can tell they spent a lot of time fishing in Canada. Phil used to write for Midwest Outdoors, I remember his articles. I think he was the pro at some camp on the Lake of the Woods."
