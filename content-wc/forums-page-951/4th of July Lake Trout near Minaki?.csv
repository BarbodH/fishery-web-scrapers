521161,Guest,2002-06-07 07:25:00,0,"Indy,You didn't say which lake you were fishing but there are no lake trout in the Winnipeg River System in that area (Pistol, Gunn, Roughrock, Little Sand or Big Sand lakes). Some of the surrounding lakes do have trout in them though."
521162,Guest,2002-06-07 07:56:00,0,"Thanks Aaron,We typically fish Gun and South of the Throat and Myrtle Rapids. There are a few points that get as deep as 120 feet that I thought I might try but The last thing I want to do is waste prime Canadian fishing time on a fish that is not there. We really don't care what we catch as long as the bite is good! Other than a few eyes for shore lunch we are strictly catch and release. Do you have a lot of experience on that part of the Winnipeg? Any tips you might have on smallies, pike, and muskie would be greatly appreciated. We normally don't have a problem catching some quantities but are always looking for ways to improve the quality! Thanks for the info on the Lakers (that are not) there.IPS"
521163,Illini Bob,2002-06-07 08:12:00,16,Looks like the old man will be able to spend more time beating the banks for 'toothy devils' after all.I.B.
521164,Guest,2002-06-07 08:39:00,0,"Yeah I.B.I'll have to find some other way to irritate the old man.Took Nikki to the pits again last night for a few hours to jerk some bluegills. She reeled in about a dozen. Just to let everyone know, the bluegills are hitting on half inch pieces of worm suspended two feet from the bottom but don't tell everyone! She was complaining about being too cold but forgot about it when she started catching fish. A true fisherman.IPS"
521165,Guest,2002-06-07 09:44:00,0,"Indy.......are you from Indianapolis? If so, so am I. My dad and I own a couple cabins on Big Sand. Been fishing that system for 25 years. I'll be up there from 6/20-6/26. I've done pretty good fishing for walleyes using a 1/4 once jig spinner (copper or gold blade)yellow head with a black twisty tail. This is a good bait to use casting the banks for smallmouth on those overcast days as the bass and Walleye both seem to enjoy it. Also for walleye, you can't go wrong with black jig and minnow or crawler. Also, you might go north of Minaki up towards the Big Sand during your stay, the crank bite might be on. Just look for dwarf cisco feeding on the surface over deep water, then troll around with a #9 shad rap (let about 150 yds out). This produces some really good eyes.I've always had better luck with the smallies up on little Sand and Big sand lakes. Have had really good luck with Senkos, jig spinners and tubes. Also try throwing some mini-torpedos (top water) and some large gold jointed Rapalas. If you hit it right, the smallie fishing can be great.I have caught some huge musky and pike on that system with the lures mentioned above, but never really intentionaly fished for them. Send me your E-mail and I'll give you a full report when I get back. [email protected]"
521166,Guest,2002-06-08 00:16:00,0,"Good Call on the lake trout in the system. I personaly could never understand why these fish were not there. Lakers are in LOW so couldn't figure out why not in river/lake section. Big Sand is 207 at it's deepest part (so far that I have found) I have heard rumours that Lakers have been caught in RoughRock..........somehow I doubt it, but have these stories do persist. Shall we finally hook up this year ? I'll be out at the lake while you are at the same time ? Last year we missed each other. Let's pick a time & place to meet.......Good FishenRob"
521151,Guest,2002-06-06 08:31:00,0,"I've been going to the Winnipeg River south of Minaki for the past 7 years and have always had good luck catching pike, smallies, and walleye but have never caught a laker. This year I'll be there the first week of July. I realize it is not the prime time to catch them, but does anyone have some advice on what I might try. I don't really want to go to a lot of expense buying downriggers, etc...Also, If anyone has any suggestions on making our trip more productive for big pike and any muskie I would appreciate it. We normally beat the wed edges with spinnerbaits in the bays and channels south of the Minaki and get a lot of hammer handles and the occasional 36"" to 38"" Pike. Three more weeks....Oh, Canada!!!Thx,IndyPikeSlinger"
521152,Illini Bob,2002-06-06 09:49:00,16,Forget about it.You know The Old man(Dad)would rather beat the weeds for hammer handles.Three weeks from heaven(Canada).
521153,Guest,2002-06-06 09:57:00,0,Does your boss know that you're posting instead of working?I.P.S.
521154,Guest,2002-06-06 10:36:00,0,"I have fished for Lake Trout in July without downriggers and had some really good results but it is not easy. First I would recommend a 6 -7 ft heavy rod (flippin stick will work)with 17-20 lb test mono. Get some heavy duty 3 way swivels and some 5-7 oz bell or banana type sinkers (Cabelas)(lots of weight). Rig up your 3 way with a 12-18in dropper(10lb test) and a 6 ft leader (17-20lb). I used floating Rapala type baits (Blue or vampire seemed to work best) with a snap loc for easy changing. Here is the problem with this rig. It is very tiring pulling that weight around and boat speed is critical. The mono will want to rise off the bottom as you go so you have to troll slowely and keep as vertical as you can. Tried using spoons with this but with going slow the spoon would sometimes hit bottom and snag.I used this technique in water up to 100ft deep and it works, but like I said your forearms will be very tired unless you have rod holders. I fished on Rowan Lake with this technique (in July and August) and outfished the guides with downriggers. By the end of the stay they were asking us where we were catching them.Good Luck,Dave"
521155,Guest,2002-06-06 10:49:00,0,"Thanks for the advice Dave, I'll give it a try. How fast were you trolling? I have an electric trolling motor, do you think that would be too slow? Also, What colors where you using? I've heard that chrome works well.Thanks,I.P.S."
521156,Dave,2002-06-06 10:58:00,258,"IPS,We were using a 15HP as slow as it would go. I think a trolling motor would probably work well. We used Rapala's in the silver/blue and the Vampire which is chrome colored (sz 11 and 13). The big Lakers really pound the bait but with all the weight and heavy gear you don't get a lot of fight until they get near the boat. We caught them up to 18lbs and man was it fun. The smaller ones are very good table fare as well.regards,Dave"
521157,Guest,2002-06-06 11:07:00,0,"Thanks Dave,I'll let you know the results in four weeks!!I.P.S."
521158,Guest,2002-06-06 11:09:00,0,"If you have a stiff rod, go and buy a dipsey diver and put a spoon or a crank behind. Fish them early morning and evening."
521159,bbakes,2002-06-06 11:17:00,121,"Catch a lot of lake trout with my walleye rod.Buy some jigging spoons, swedish pimples, rattlesnakes, etc and fish the trout vertically. If you are marking trout on the bottom, keep the moter running and drop right on top of them. If they move of your locater go find them. If they are suspended drop down below them and reel straight up. It is like veritical casting/trolling, the trout inhale this offering. The key obviously is being able to mark fish. Once you find them, a jigging spoon catches them. Another technique that works very well is anchoring on a hump and casting out ciscoes or smelt and letting them sit on the bottom. Leave your bail open and let the fish run with it. Both of these techniques require no special gear, and after June I catch 99% of my lake trout using one of these techniques. Can't bring myself to put downriggers on my boat, besides I love to catch lakers on my walleye rods. Good luck!"
