Ask the office to give you a message that I was at Abrams Lake Park.However, on Friday of your last day, I seen you at the chutes. I had noticed you fishing, but didn't recognize the boat until you turned to leave and it had ""Detente"" on the back. I told my partner, ""hey that's the guy I been trying to get with"". I think you probably left on Saturday from Anderson's. Hopefully, you had a super week. I know we did, even with the rain and snow. I believe the chutes were our best spot, however, we caught fish about everywhere we went.Maybe we can see each other up there next year. If you get this message, email me at [email protected] and let me know how you did.Eye_snatcher"
