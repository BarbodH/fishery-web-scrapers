Took my son, Brother-in-law and nephew and we caught too many walleyes to count. Even the pike were cooperating. 90% of the Walleyes were 14"" to 21"" and the pike were 18"" to 29"". We really did not fish very hard but still did very well. The new walleye slot makes for some small filets to keep, but it is what is best for the sport. The Watsons and Pine Portage Lodge are first class, what a great time. Can't wait til next year."
