520998,Guest,2002-06-05 19:25:00,0,There are other sources for bait. Most camps have minnows as well as Smitties->gas station and a couple of private individuals also sell minnows. The camp I go to gives you handfuls>darn near 1 for 2. buy a doz get 1 doz free
520999,Dave S,2002-06-06 11:35:00,314,MP3553 Curious what camp you stayed at during your last visit? Are the private individuals that sell minnows in Ear Falls? You can e-mail me at [email protected]
520993,Guest,2002-06-02 18:49:00,0,"Just returned from 2 weeks of fishing LS @ Ear Falls area. Week 1Ice was totaly gone by 5/22->snowed 5/23! First week was not the greatest due to the cold conditions. Main lake temp 37 degrees -> Sawmill bay 46 degrees. Snow dropped water temps about 5 degrees. Jigs and slip bobbers were the most productive methods w/minnows.Fishing was tougher than normal! Many males caught that were still milking>even into late week 2!Week 2Weather much better! Warm compared to previous week. Even made it up into the 80's a couple of days. Main 47 degrees and found 65-68 degree water @ Broad lake. Jigs, floating jigs and spinner rigs were the choice methods. Started pulling spinners by 5/25 in the warmer bays and jigs out in the main lake. Best area for quanity/quality >hands down....broad lake! What a blast!Made 5 trips to Broad due to the consistency of fish>well worth the trip. The Winnasaga river, Sawmill, Turkey Creek, Iron creek all produced fish and some decent size ones. My guess is this week and next week should be VERY good fishing. Good Luck"
520994,Riceburner,2002-06-02 20:35:00,436,Thanks for the update---some friends are going up June 8th--will be happy to share the results too....Was the water level up or down from normal for now?? Wondering on bait of choice?? Were the local minnows small due to cold spring? Road conditions from Baudette or Int Falls??? THX!!!
521000,NateW,2002-06-02 20:42:00,96,And by all means tell us how that new rig worked for you! By the way....your wife let you buy the new boat...have you agreed to your end of the bargain yet???
521001,Big Tim,2002-06-03 04:33:00,63,"Fished 4/25 -4/31 out of LacSeul Lodge, near Ear falls. Also made 5 trips to broad lake. Water level was down 2 to 3 feet from last year & temps are down 2-3 weeks behind last year. Be carefull , especially in Altimiter creek. lots of moving sandbars, Large rocks & logs that can't be seen due to low water clarity. Also did well in Farwell bay area. If the weather holds spring fishing should peak in the next few weeks. 1/4 & 3/8 oz, chartreuse jigs most productive for our group. Leech or minnow about equal with the larger fish on minnows. We worked the jigs along the bottom v e r y s l o w l y . Watched other boats around us using bobbers with less luck than we had. Largest of the week was a spawned out female at 31-1/2""---8 lbs, 8 oz. Would have gone 10-1/2 to 11 lbs later in the season. Got a few on spinner rigs & Rattlin' Raps but water still too cold for consistent action. Most of our fish were caught in 8 to 12 feet of water. I envy you guys going in the next few weeks! Pike were very agressive & provided a lot of fast action near shallow water with moving water nearby. They will hit almost anything that moves, Rattlin lures with some flash or chartreuse worked best for us. Respect the big lake, got caught out at broad, 20 plus miles from home on fri. when a stiff wind kicked up 3' waves all the way home made for tough ride in a 18' Lund. :-)"
521002,lunker99,2002-06-03 06:54:00,236,What's the best way to get into Broad Lake? Going up friday and have never fished Broad. Is it in the steamboat narrows area?
521003,Guest,2002-06-04 19:33:00,0,Broad lake is further down the lake. Steamboat>Shanty narrows>Poplar narrows> due east of Manatoba point. If your map shows Manitoba point>locate Altimeter(due east of the point or north of Windago point) Creek and follow it up to Broad Lake. My Guess is by next week that most of the fish will have moved into Sunlight lake of down the creek out in to the main lake. Could be wrong>just a hunch. Expecially if you see many boats @ the main island/point that is at the entrance to the creek mouth.
520995,Guest,2002-06-04 19:39:00,0,"My best guess is the water is down about 1-2' from last June/July.Be careful in Shanty East... both red/green bouys are missing. The green bouy really ate many props and lower units the 2 weeks I was up.Road conditions... came up I-29, entered @ Pembina, ND.Hwy 105 road work is done all the way to Ear Falls. Man is that nice and smooth! About time!"
520996,Guest,2002-06-04 19:54:00,0,"Forgot...Bait of choice as usual was minnows. Others in camp tried leaches and worms and found that the minnows were producing the best the last 2 weeks. Minnow size really didn't make a flippin bit of difference. Overall the minnows @ camp were running a little smaller, but then it was also early in the year.The numb-nuts @ 4 Seasons tackle shop claimed that leaches were the ticket to awesome success... funny everyone in camp was giving away their leaches both weeks. Go figure!!!! Must know most camps don't mess around with leaches. Way to make a sale. Guess you can tell I don't really care for the guy... unfortunatly they have the best bait shop in town, If there was another place>you'd find me taking my business there! Funny everytime I go in there he slams the gear/method/bait/location and then tries to sell you something you really don't need! Just didn't get out of the boat yeaterday! Wish he would go out and rake gravel and let his wife tend to the store!They did have a nice selection of minnows from small to chubs sizes...my guess is they spent more time sorting out the minnows than the camp."
521004,Guest,2002-06-04 20:02:00,0,"NateAll I can say is it is really a dream to fish out of that boat. Couldn't ask for anything more out of a boat. So far, it is the driest boat I've ever fished out of...not once in 2 weeks did I get wet from waves/spray comming over the front or sides. It's a joy to cruise down the lake. Just wish the darn thing would catch fish!The other part of the deal....still waitin! Guess it ain't that cold in ##### yet or pigs haven't learned to fly in Nebraska either! Got my baby!"
520997,Dave S,2002-06-04 22:13:00,314,Curious if they carefully count out the minnows or sell them to you by the scoup. I need to give them a call and find out how much their minnows are. Sounds like the only bait shop around Ear Falls to find live minnows.
