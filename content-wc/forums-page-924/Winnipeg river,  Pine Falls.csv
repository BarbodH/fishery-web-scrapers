If you have is there a deep channel out there or only shallow flats?I've seen boats go that way, but I've never ventured out there. Thanks for any info you have about Elk or sturgeon island.Mike Mortenson#545"

524080,ptdiver,2002-09-07 06:41:00,9,If it blows up and you are out there you better be in a big boat .... it gets nasty out there.I phone environment Canada for the Lake Winnipeg south basin weather report. They are fairly accurate and they always update there report.1-204-983-2050 Select 3 then 9 to skip options.As for the eastern part of the lake towards Stergeon Pt. It is full of rocks and can get very shallow quickly. Keep your eyes on your locator and watch for breaks in the water. I was out there this summer taking a peak absolutaly paradise out there.
