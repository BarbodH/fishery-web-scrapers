We'll be staying on the Canadaian side up the lake near the Rat River Opening. We are not too far from the Kettle Falls area. Any place special that we should concentrate on? What has been working the best: Jig/Minnow...crankbaits....crawlers...Thanks in advance,TroutaholicJust Rip Lips And Keep A Tight Line!!!"
