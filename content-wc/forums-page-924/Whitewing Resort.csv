524003,Ode,2002-09-08 11:58:00,34,"Thanks for all the responses, I have a friend who is able to book one of the big boats next year right after the 4th of July. I was wondering if 7 days aboard a houseboat is too much? I went on one before for 4 days and that got to be long......of course the women were with, sorry girls. One more question, are we able to buy most of our supplies nearby?Thanks, Ode"
524004,BD,2002-09-08 21:36:00,739,"More than one woman in a house, a houseboat, or a cabin for more than an hour is dangerous. Take it from someone who knows. Now when we (the guys) go on a fishing trip we are able to work out any little problem and have a good time."
523993,Ode,2002-09-03 18:59:00,34,"I would like some information on Whitewing's houseboats whether it be good or bad. A bunch of us guys are contemplating renting one of the houseboats for a week. Anybody out there rented one of these?? We would like to fish Lac Seul and would be doing this in July of next year. Any info would be appreciated.Thanks, Ode"
523994,Guest,2002-09-03 20:18:00,0,We tried the Houseboat week on a different Lake and the main drawback was the owner did not want us to move the boat around the Lake. He wanted to set us up at one site and comeback and bring us in at the end of the week. This defeated the purpose for us because we wanted the mobility to move to other fishing areas. We also only got one boat with the houseboat and he wanted to charge us for additonal boats. We had to have extra boats for fishing so the cost seemed out of line. We had some bad wheather and that was a big negative.
523995,Riceburner,2002-09-03 21:16:00,436,"We just came off the new WW houseboat on LS, Aug 17th....it was a week in HEAVEN. We have both of their boats rented for the same week next year. The problem is availability--there are no other options unless you want to pound many miles of water and burn gas to fish the areas around MacKenzie Bay, that I'm aware of...and last I heard, the houseboats are booked for 2003. The advantages are mainly the gas and pounding--the dis is that you play their game-1-pay to have the pilot run the boat out and back (tho it eliminates the hull insurance other places require), -2-leave the Hboat sit in one spot--(easier to run in the fishing boats and save the $4/gallon HB gas anyway), -3- HB has to come in on Friday afternoon (tho the fishing boats can stay out and fish)......the boats that tried to fish from camp complained of small fish---not the case out on the lake at all-like I said we're going back. Cost was about $100 per man extra over staying at the WW cabins. FYI--we rented from Dougherty's on Rainy Lake in August several years ago--less money and also good fishing--move all you want, ROCKS BIGTIME--(pay for the insurance), have heard the fishing slot has really helped the fish quality--but not like LS..."
523996,BD,2002-09-03 21:26:00,739,"I have a friend that houseboats on Lac Seul. I will forward this thread to him to get his feedback on the subject. I never heard of the resort owner or a resort employee going out with the houseboat for more than a one hour get familar ride unless the people renting the houseboat need a little more guidance. The first time we went houseboating one of the resort employees went along with us for about an hour to make sure we had no problems. After that we were on our own. We have been houseboating for 15 years now and have always been free to move around. We use Lake of the Woods Houseboats out of Reed Narrows (3 miles north or Sioux Narrows). Only one 16' fishing boat is supplied with the houseboat rental. We take our own fishing boats along so the one that comes with the houseboat is used infrequently. If you do decide to houseboat on LOTW, I can recomend www.lowhouseboats.com There are other houseboats on LOTW. Floating Lodges in the Sioux Narrows area is one of the others that has also received good recomendations here on WC."
523997,woman,2002-09-05 03:44:00,2,There are rules and regulations for every lake. Whitewing is allowed to park its houseboat in one spot making it somewhat like an outpost camp. Wonderful people and great fishng take place at this government appointed location. Give the resort owners a break. If someone is looking for LOTW fishing let them ask.
523998,BD,2002-09-05 06:44:00,739,"Kevin in his reply was unhappy with his being unable to move from one spot. In the first paragraph of my reply I stated that the practice of the owner operating the boat and not allowing the boat to be moved during the week was unfamilar to me, and that I was going to contact a friend that had experience houseboating on Lac Seul to find out about this practice. In the second paragraph I gave him a comparison and a recomendation for a place where he would not be tied down to one spot.Riceburner stated that the pilot was paid to run the houseboat and that there are other places that allow you to run the boat (see Riceburners reason #1). If you run the boat you don't pay the pilot you pay the extra insurance. I find it hard to believe that if there are, let's say, only fifty spots to tie up on Lac Seul and that there are fifty houseboats in operation so no one can move from spot to spot. Also if other operators don't use pilots, how can they make sure their houseboats tie up in the proper locations? Doesn't sound Kosher to me."
523999,BD,2002-09-05 15:16:00,739,"I just checked out the webpage for Lac Seul Floating Lodges. According to what I read you can be your own captain and cruise from place to place if you wish. You can also hire a pilot to take you to a certain spot. Sounds to me like ""Womans"" one spot for the houseboat statement isn't correct unless the houseboat owner wants to operate that way. As far as I could find out on the net there is no special rule on Lac Seul for houseboat tie up locations (ie: a houseboat being limited to one spot)."
524000,Guest,2002-09-05 15:29:00,0,Due to thier late entry into the houseboat market at about the time the Lac Seul Management Plan was coming onboard; White Wing was restricted to only one parking spot or to use the boats for resident use only.The older operations are without restrictions.
524001,Guest,2002-09-05 15:45:00,0,"""Houseboat guides are mandatory to take you to your MNR designated parking area, and set you up for the week. The total fee is $200 ($100 to guide out, and $100 to guide in)."" Straight from the Whitewing web site. Cut and pasted."
524002,BD,2002-09-05 15:51:00,739,Guy Who Knows; Thanks for clearing things up about the other operators being grandfathered etc.
