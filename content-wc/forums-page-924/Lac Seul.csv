What are you doing watching the posts at this time of year? I thought you were a ""hard-core, spring-time, light-tackle, jig man."" You wouldn't like this bottom-bouncing stuff, it's not your style.Eyewitness,Give me your e-mail address and I'll let you know about that public landing.Jay"
524014,Jigger1,2002-09-10 06:54:00,234,"Jay  It's possible, but I'm not entirely sure you've been compromised as of yet. If this is the right Jay, this will seal the deal. Do you remember taking my daughter and I out the first evening we came to Lac Seul three years ago? You proceeded to smoke us that evening and then I proceeded to deliver payback over the next four days as I pounded one monster after another in front of your boat? If this is the right Jay  click above and shoot me an email. Jigger1"
524005,Guest,2002-09-04 08:31:00,0,We are going to Lac Seul last week in September. Staying near Ear Falls. It will be our first time fishing walleye and northerns on Lac Seul. Does anyone have information on where the walleye will be and what types of bait to use?ThanksBillfish
524006,Guest,2002-09-06 11:32:00,0,"Billfish,I guide walleye fisherman further south on Lac Seul than where you are headed, but I can offer some insight.By September on Lac Seul, and certainly by late-September, winter is on its way, and cooler temperatures and stronger winds are common traits to the ever-changing weather. For the most part, walleyes will be found in deeper water (i.e., 20'+). Some walleyes may cruise shallower flats, but the majority of fish will be deeper, sometimes down as far as 50-55'. Walleye location is largely determined by the availability and size of baitfish. This year, walleyes were consistently coughing up large smelt and ciscoe by early-August, meaning a strong baitfish population. That said, if you can find the baitfish, you will inevitably find walleyes. Target spots that feature quick drop-offs from 20'-40', especially if much deeper is close-by. Main lake islands, archipelagos, reefs, and long points containing these features are sure to hold walleyes. As well, make sure you spend time on 'mega-sand structure.' The surficial geology of the Lac Seul area, combined with the recent geomorphological processes since the dam was erected in the early-30's, has created large sand flats throughout the main lake. The edges of these flats are magnets for walleyes.Lac Seul is a big lake, and thus you need to be able to cover water as fast as possible, to eliminate unproductive areas and key on the more productive spots. Bottom bouncers are probably the best way to accomplish this need. At these depths, you will need 2 oz.-3 oz. bouncers, with an in-line spinner rig containing a minnow or crawler.If the fish get finnicky, or they are hitting soft, you will need to slow down your troll, and possibly even jig with heavy jigs (3/4 oz.-1 oz.). The corners of large structures and the end of points are good places to try some vertical jigging. Well that should give you some ideas. Lac Seul is undoubtedly the best walleye fishery that I have ever fished, particularly for producing high volumes of trophy fish.I hope your experience is a positive one,Jay"
524007,Guest,2002-09-06 21:12:00,0,JayThanks for the advice on September Walleye on Lac Seul. That will save us time. Good Luck on the water!Billfish
524008,Guest,2002-09-07 12:50:00,0,"Jay, saw your post on the walleye forum. Just a question. You said you fis south of Ear Falls. We have spent many years fishing the Lost Lake area and were wondering where you fish."
524009,Guest,2002-09-09 06:47:00,0,"Jimmy,I predominantly fish the southwest-central portion of Lac Seul; everything from Vaughn Lake to Manitoba Point.Jay"
524010,Guest,2002-09-09 07:41:00,0,"Jay, Is there a public landing in that section of lake? I know Macqwa has there own landing site, but not sure where a guy can put in up there. I have a couple friends that are pretty familiar with that portion of the lake and we'd like to come up and stay on the mainland close by and day trip in. Just not sure where we can put in at. Any advice would be helpful. Thanks in advance!"
524011,Guest,2002-09-09 11:52:00,0,"To whomever it may concern,There is a public landing at the south end of Williams Bay. To get there, follow Hwy 601 (I think) north from Dryden (turn off Hwy 17 onto 601 at Dryden GM). After about 5 miles, the highway heads east and south again back to Dryden. At this point, go straight onto the dirt road. It is about 35 miles from there. It is confusing to explain. Your best bet is to probably ask somebody in Dryden once you get there. If you are definately interested in heading up there, let me know and I will give you the specific directions.Jay"
524012,Jigger1,2002-09-09 12:22:00,234,"Is this by chance the same blond haired wild man by the name of Jay that guided my brother-in-law this year to not one, but three master angler walleyes in 4.5 days of fishing?"
524015,eyewitness,2002-09-09 15:06:00,680,"Thanks Jay! Do you have an email addy that we can converse on? Email me with the directions if you would....also, with what you charge for a day trip..thanks!"
524016,Guest,2002-09-09 19:57:00,0,"Just returned from LS-was up 8/30-9/7. Lake level is up approx 3' from ""normal"" pool level. Water temps ranged from 64-72 degrees which is warmer than normal for this time of year. Usually by the start of the second week the birch trees have started to change color-this year that hasn't happened. Normally most of the eyes are found in 6-15' of water-last week it was 17-30' range. Used minnows and a spinner rig to catch all the fish the entire week. Tons of 12-17"" fish with numerous bigger fish. The quanity of hogs didn't happen this trip-maybe the other post was right about the fish even being deeper.Best bet is to ask @ camp where, what and how when you get there cause a lot can change by the time you get there!Good luck...Set the hook....you got a bite!!!!"
