523949,Guest,2002-08-31 20:46:00,0,Anybody used the boat launches in the Traverse Bay/Albert Beach areas then driven across to fish the mouth of the Wpg River and or those islands on the north-east shore. I am wondering if its faster to drive across the bay rather than launching the boat at PF then running up to the mouth to fish. Working assumption here is that the winds are reasonable to make the trek.How far would it be from the north-west shore over to the mouth of the Wpg River.Please share your thoughts if you have experience here. Thanks
