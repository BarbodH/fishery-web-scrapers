523933,Guest,2002-09-05 12:52:00,0,Remember guys lead kills loons! Whats a safe cheap alternative? I dont think there is one yet!
523934,BD,2002-09-05 14:15:00,739,Tin can be used. The jigs will be a lighter weight for the same size but will still work. Salt water fishermen have been using tin squids for years. Pouring tin isn't much different than pouring lead so if you have used lead in the past the change should not be to much of a problem.
523935,lunker99,2002-09-09 08:09:00,236,"I prefer the powder paint and fishinnut's method for two-tone jigs. While the jig is hot go from one color to the next. It sticks fine and you save a lot of time by bypassing the cooling and reheating. Also, the oven bake afterwards really makes a difference on the deurability of the finish. Never used to do it and the paint would chip off pretty quickly when bouncing jigs off the rocks. Started baking and the finish lasted a lot longer. Just make sure you have the jig eyes cleaned before baking. Forgot to do that once and it took a hammer and nail to open them up."
523936,Guest,2002-09-09 23:51:00,0,"One way to prevent the eyes from getting painted over is to use 1/16"" shrink tube over them. The kind you boy at the local hardware store. I cut these into approximately 1/8"" to 3/16"" lengths (18 to 20 short peices out of a 6"" stick), and slide them over the eye before heating the first time. Shrinks down tight with the heat and won't fall off into the powder. Then remove before putting in the oven with a slight twisting motion with a pair of needle-nose. Definately use a heat gun especially for 1/32 thru 1/4 oz. Another thing that might help is to be sure and keep the powder as fluffy as possible. I do this by pouring a little powder into a plastic margarine cup and stirring with a short screwdriver, sometimes between every jig. Kind of a hassle but I think you'll be pleased with the results. Also try and schwish the jig from side to side instead of pushing it into the powder. Seems to work better for me. Hope all this longwindedness helps out. I probably have painted over 5,000 jigs with this stuff and can honestly say I wouldn't bother painting my own without itAbove all, KEEP YOUR POWDER DRY!!"
523923,AL,2002-08-31 09:09:00,89,"I am getting into making my own jigs and would like some advise on what paint do any of you use. I will be trying the powder first, this is the only type I can find locally. Will a spray paint from a local hardware store work? Also, how many types should I be making to take to Canada next year? I have purchased two seperate molds, both round ball type.AL"
523924,Guest,2002-08-31 15:52:00,0,"Powder paint works good but you can over coat the jig until you get it down pat... With time powder paint you will find works the best.No you can't paint the jig with spary paint from the hardware store. You might be able to get away with white primer buts thats about it.For proper jig painting you will need to use vinyl paint, if you can find that your good to go......... If you use vinyl paint make sure you get lots of thinner as the paint will thicken very fast exposed to the air for painting."
523925,Atlanta Dave,2002-09-01 08:51:00,323,"Al Get the powder paint it is fool proof just make sure you dont over heat the jigs Over a flame it takes about 6 or 7 secs for a 1/2 ounce jig dip in the powder knock off excewss and if nessessary wave back through the flame a couple of times. For Canada I would get chartruese , orange and Pink.Atlanta DAve"
523926,Walleye Wacker,2002-09-01 19:16:00,6,"I have made and painted jigs for years. Years back I used to apply several coats of spray lacquer but it came off to easy. Although you could look with pride at your jigs as they chipped off from Walleye attacks. I now use only powder and it is great. I only make three weights 1/4,3/8,3/4. Those weights seem to cover all jig needs. I make round heads and swimming jigs. The colors I like are Char,Orange,Pink,Yellow and White. I will also make two colored jigs by dipping painted jigs in lacquer colors halfway. Dont really know if duo colored catch fish any better but they sure make the jig box look pretty. All my fishing buddys use my jigs but its probably because they are two cheap to buy their own.....Have fun and enjoy."
523927,fishinnut,2002-09-04 10:33:00,642,"Walleye Wacker; Why dump those jigs into lacquer for a two-tone? Immediately after dipping in powder, and paint has glossed up nice, dip partially in another color. Only way to go!!!!!!!!!!!"
523928,Guest,2002-09-04 12:42:00,0,fishinnut....i will give it a try...thanks
523929,Atlanta Dave,2002-09-04 13:35:00,323,Fishinnut Are you saying dip the hot jig in one color and then dip the tip of it in another color while it still has some warmth? Will have to give it a tryAtlanta Dave
523930,AL,2002-09-04 17:45:00,89,"Thanks for the advice...I've painted my first 12 dozen. It took about 50 or so to get the hang of it, but once I worked it out they looked great. This stuff is fun and I'm hooked.AL"
523931,Guest,2002-09-05 11:41:00,0,"Hi AlYou may want to check out this website - www.tacklemaking.comI started out making my own bucktail jigs - now I am making my own crankbaits and actually purchased an airbrush - the jigs I made with the powder paint was just a stepping stone - good luck with your new hobby....I live in Canada and I would say the best colours are white, chartuese, orange and maybe pink....I am sure you have made lots of these colours already - try blending the colours - I found white and pink are really hot for Walleye in my area......"
523932,Guest,2002-09-05 11:51:00,0,"I paint a bunch of jigs every year before I go to Canada. I agree with most people on here that the powder is the way to go. It's clean and easy and the powder can be used year after year. There are a couple of tips that have worked well for me:1. I prefer to use a hot air paint stripper over a lighter. If you paint a jig 2 colors a flame can be a problem. When reheating after the first color, a flame can sometimes make the paint bubble or start to burn. You don't want this. The hot air gun gives you an even heat. At the fishing shows most of the guys in the booths use the hot air gun. I wouldn't buy one just for this, but if you have one, use it. Get a pair of needle-nose pliers and prop the gun up so it stands on its own.2. Have a cup of cold water next to you. Heat the jig, dip it into the powder and then into the cold water and set it aside. Then you don't have to sit and hold the jig while it cools.3. When you are done painting a jig the finish will be pretty good. To make it even more durable, hang the jigs on the rack in your oven and bake them. The containers of powder I have will tell you the temperature and how long to do it for. If done right the finish will be stronger than any jig you buy in a store.4. Buy a container of white powder. Some of the colors, especially the neon colors don't come out that bright. Heat the jig, dip it into the white and let cool. Then reheat the jig and dip it into the main color. It will look much better. Do this same thing if you want a 2-color jig. Dip into one color 1st, let it cool, reheat, and dip just the tip of the head into the second color.Hope this helpsAdam"
