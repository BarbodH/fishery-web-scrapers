523910,Walleye Wacker,2002-09-03 05:59:00,6,"Jig""N""John, I know that 10,000 Walleye in a week is hard to believe but it is true. I actually got tired of catching fish and fished less populated areas because it was like shooting fish in a barrell. You could hardly get your jig to the bottom in the honey holes without catching a Walleye. We would make bets that you couldnt throw your jig out in the honey holes and let it go to the bottom without catching a fish....it was tough to do. The outfitter estimated that the main lake and the five adjoining lakes had lost at least 50% of their water. We found a few spots in the main Lake that had 20 ft of water but most of it was 6 to 12 feet deep. When you consider it was at least 10 feet low it wasnt hard to imagine why the fish were stacked up like cordwood and striking any movement. Every night when we would come in from the lake we would all say the same thing...""they will never believe this back at the office"""
523909,Ohio fisherman,2002-09-03 10:13:00,989,"Hey Tracker: Thanks for posting that photo! This year I did not get to go to Canada, so I appreciated your photo more than ever. Last year while bringing in about a 12 inch walleye a pike hit. He made a few good runs and held tight even close to the boat. I almost landed the pike but when he saw the net he lost his appetite and spit out the walleye. They pike was approximately 42-46 inches long! The walleye was extremely dead and looked like it had been massaged by a weedeater. Take care, Ohio fisherman"
523914,Guest,2002-09-03 22:23:00,0,I have seen this quite often we had it happen 8-10 times in a weeks time it is pretty cool you think you have a small walleye and all of the sudden you think it is bigger than you thought and then you realize what has happened when you see the fish. We have been able to get a few in the net over the years.
523911,Guest,2002-09-04 10:46:00,0,"Using the math above, everyone in your party would have to boat 1 fish every 2 minutes (30 fish per hour) for 8 straight hours non-stop, seven straight days. Don't think so."
523912,Walleye Wacker,2002-09-04 12:40:00,6,Our group fishes closer to twelve hours a day. I know it is hard to believe ...but it happened. It was Walleyefantastic. We went back the next year and the water was normal and the fishing was good but not Walleyefantastic.
523915,Guest,2002-09-06 09:30:00,0,"Who's seen this? While casting spoons for pike several years ago I had a two footer follow the spoon to the boat. I slowed the retrieve and when the pike saw the boat, it turned 180 degrees quickly and hooked its tail on the treble hook. Had to reel the fish in and remove the hook. Only time I've caught a fish by the tail!"
523916,greg,2002-09-07 16:46:00,107,"Had a fun one in Minitaki 2 years ago. About a 30 in. northern latched onto a small walleye and let go at the boat. A few minutes later I caught a 12 in. small mouth. As I released it, it did a few jumps out of the water like a flying fish. Then a northern( I assume the same one) grabbed it just above water level. Have never seen a northern take a fish above water before."
523913,lobo1,2002-09-07 21:43:00,734,"WW,I believe your story because we have had days just like yours. Fish on every cast with the jig rarely hitting bottom. I must say that we never stayed in these spots to catch 200 hundred fish because they were almost all small fish 15-20"" with most on the small end. We too fish 12+ hours a day and I don't see any problem at all landing 200 per person a day if we would have stayed all day.We fished one such hole on a lake north of Pickle Lk and had a giant pike take one of our eyes. I had been using a medium action rod but all the fish were so small that I switched to my ultra light - wouldn't you know it - a few casts later and a 40+ inch northern took my fish and the drag began to sing. Had him to the boat twice before he let go of the poor shredded 16"" eye.I knew nobody would believe our story - not even the guys in our group - so I had my partner video tape fish after fish after fish on consecutive casts, even have footage of the big pike.it does happen and is very possible. I have been there and have proof.lobo1"
523899,Guest,2002-08-29 14:17:00,0,I just thought it would be a good time to share a fish story. We fished lake Minnitki in early July. We found a small shelf/reef right off an island that was loaded with 10-18 inch walleyes. We fished that spot a few times in the evening and we alway seem to than pull a 25 inch plus pike from that same area along with the numerous walleye. Finally I realize the pattern that the pike were coming up at dusk to feed on the walleye. My dad hooked what looked like a 30+ inch pike and we were both excited. I got the net ready in the water waiting for him to bring it closer to the boat. As he got close I made my move and felt him briefly on the side of the net and then he was gone-- as I brought the net in my dad's line had an 11-inch walleye on the jig! The Pike had sunk his teeth into the sides of the walleye and held on until he felt the net! I was sooooo close to getting that Pike and the walleye and I missed it! We let the walleye go as it seemed he would make it but be scared for life.Has anyone else seen a lot of this-- Pike hitting walleye as they are hooked?
523900,phishfearme,2002-08-29 14:27:00,1242,"this event is frequently a major highlight of the trip!! this past june this ""pike attack hooked walleye"" happened to our group a good dozen times - and it's frequently the biggest pike around that does the attacking. isn't it a blast though? it's also a good biology and fishing lesson - a struggling (or injured or sick) fish in the wild has little chance when pike are present. we'd do well to imitate this in out offerings.phish"
523901,IaDave,2002-08-29 14:35:00,476,"The same thing happened to us last fall on Minnitaki. We were fishing for walleye in 30' of water. My fishing buddy hooked a fish and he said it was a small one. About half way up his drag just started to sing so right away we knew something was up. I grabbed the net and as he got toward the surface we knew what was going on. He had hooked an 18"" walleye and all you saw was its head and tail. The pike that had a hold of him had to have been 4' long at the least. I'm still not sure that it might not have been a musky. As I eased the net toward him he looked at it and opened his mouth and swam away. At least we still kept the walleye. I beleive this probably happens quite often."
523902,Guest,2002-08-29 19:54:00,0,"HEHE......Love the story........ But I can top both of them....Was fishing Lac Soul just slaying the Walleye when I caught what seemed a small Walleye..... I was just doing the regular reel the Walleye in then suddenly......WHAM...... I Gots A Bigger Fish...lmao, I fought what I thought was a gator or Musky..... then when I got that sucker next to the boat I seen the best Walleye of my life... Down goes the net and up come's a 13.8Lb Walleye!!! As soon as I get the mamoth in the net it spits out about a 2lb Walleye thats attached to my hook..............Yeeee Haaaaaw!!I let the little guy go and Needless to say..... that big Walleye is now decorating my living room wall......... :pThats the first and only Walleye I have ever caught on a Walleye... :)Outdoorzman"
523904,Dave S,2002-08-29 21:33:00,314,"We had Pike attack hooked walleye nearly every day when fishing on Lac Seul this summer. The larger pike evidently eat allot of walleye and the sight of a struggling walleye is to much to resist. Much to our ammazement, many times one could fight the pike all the way to the boat and if careful you could net them. Pike are really predators!I also noticed some of the smaller pike had teeth marks on their body so they must eat each other also."
523903,Guest,2002-08-30 06:03:00,0,I wonder if a walleye in another walleye's mouth counts against your limit? Does this count as one or two fish? Maybe you can stuff the little one down the big one and count it as one.
523905,Guest,2002-08-30 06:24:00,0,"A similar sitution occurred with my buddy and I in June this year on LOTW near Nestor Falls. We had three 17"" walleyes on a stringer dangling beside the boat, fishing a reef in about 25' of water. All of a sudden i heard a big splash beside the boat. I look over only to see a large reddish fin of a giant muskie. The thing was well over 45"" and just tore one of the walleyes clean off the stringer and was going for another when i put the net in the water. It swam away and we were left with one healthy walleye and one half-eaten walleye. I guess the muskie wanted shore lunch more than we did. Also, a guy who was ice fishing beside me last winter on LOTW had a very large muskie hit the transducer of his vexilar fishing in 35' of water and would not let go for about 2 minutes. What a sight!"
523906,Walleye Wacker,2002-08-30 06:48:00,6,"Several years ago we did a fly in and while the plane was landing you could see the main lake was down at least 12 ft. There were 5 lakes adjacent to the main lake and with the low water a lot of the fish had moved into the main lake. This low water grouped up the Walleyes to the point that you would literally catch a fish every cast at the prime structure areas on the lake. The outfitter told us that the normal Pike pattern was poor fishing because the toothy critters would stage themselves just off of the Walleye spots and then slip in for a Walleye banquet several times a day. This resulted in literally hundreds of pike grabbing our hooked Walleyes on the way to the boat that week. We landed very few of them because they would let go of the Walleye when they got near the surface. We did get some 40"" Pike in the net and it is some thrill to have a two pound Walleye coming in and have a 40"" Pike smash it. I had this happen before but only rarely. But that week on that lake it was happening hour after hour. The fishing for Walleye was so hot that week that 6 of us caught and released over 10,000 Walleye and saw more big Pike than a man should be allowed in a lifetime. HONEST"
523907,Guest,2002-08-30 15:36:00,0,"Come on now. Over 10,000 walleyes in a weeks time with six guys? Let's do a little mathematics here: 10,000 (not assuming more than) divided by 7 days (assuming 7 days, since you said a weeks time, giving you the benefit of doubt) equals 1,428 (not rounded off) per day. 1,428 divided by six equals 238 walleyes per person per day. Now every fisherman has his right to exaggeration, but I find this a little hard to believe. Honest!I have resorted to having a manual counter aboard my boat, so that I can keep an accurate count of exactly how many walleyes are boated during a trip. This has a tendency to eliminate the exaggeration factor.Jig'N'John"
