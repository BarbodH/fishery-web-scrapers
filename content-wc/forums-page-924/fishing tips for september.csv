What I mean is, anchor your boat on the hump and cast right down into the deep and bring your jig up..... I want you to realise that your going to get many snags and cut lines but I guarentee it is well worth the weight of lead..... now listen up........ here is the BIG secret......... FISH AT NIGHT........ Thats right, night time holds the true large ""eye's""...... Troll from dusk till 1am if you want a true trophy. Find where structure meets a nice flat beach type of area and troll body baits. Vary your trolling pattern to zig-zag these areas and your going to find the bigger Walleye.Nothing beats fall Walleye fishing, most anglers have put there gear away and you have really only begun.... Fish-on!!........ get the net she's a keeper!!"
524032,Guest,2002-09-07 11:59:00,0,"I concur with most of the posts....FISH DEEP...try bottom bouncers in the 2 oz. to 3 oz. range with spinners tipped with minnow or worm,i prefer minnows but have had sucess with worms.The rule of thumb is 1 oz. for every 10' of water. Where are you going?I am from northern ontario and most of the lakes a preety shallow, 30' being a preety deep lake for this area,(Timmins).I have had good success also fihing at the bottom of rapids if they are dumping into a lake.The walleye are at the bottom of the rapidsor falls waiting for forage to get washed down the river,they also winter there if the water is deep enough. Hope this helps...GOOD FISHING. Al"
524021,JohnL,2002-09-04 14:11:00,5,Im heading for my first late summer fall trip to ontario. Previously I have fished mainly in June. Im very excited to try something new. I am trying to decide how to fish walleye and pike in September. In the spring I always have good luck finding and fishing current. will that be true this time of year? Are fish typically deeper? Any advice for Ontario in September would really be appreciated.
524022,lenray,2002-09-05 07:29:00,467,I fish up there in the last 2 weeks of September go to a trout lake and the pike will be there also.
524023,Guest,2002-09-05 09:43:00,0,"I was there last year in september and did very well using typical presentations like; jig/minnow, crawlers on harness, and leeches with harness or jig. If you use minnows and jigs, be sure and thread the minnow on the hook. In the mouth, out the gill, turn the hook and stick into the dorsel fin area. Do the same with leeches, thru the sucker, twist the hook and into the body. This will eliminate alot of short strikes. Otherwise they will just bite off the bait and never tough the hook. Stingers work good also. The main difference in Sept. is they are deeper--20-30', maybe even 40', instead of shallow. I didn't start fishing until I was in 15' of water but usually went deeper. Don't overlook the shallow bays and flats in the evening. I think they will come shallow if there is food there. Fishing for them just on occasion tends to make it hard to figure them out. Look for the drop offs and points adjacent to deep water. Be real careful bringing them up out of deep water. If you bring them up to fast they can blow their stomach and will probably die.I'm pretty much a live bait fisherman, but I do pull cranks on occasion. Last year was my first time up in the fall and I really wanted to get into some big walleyes, but caught hundreds of small one. I need to figure out how to get the big ones. Everything I read indicates the fall is the time to catch big walleye. I just don't know how.Hope this helps...Eyesnatcher"
524024,Wenty,2002-09-05 14:21:00,15,Fishing sucks in September. Don't come up here. Stay home and watch football.
524025,tracker,2002-09-05 19:08:00,91,"Wenty, why would you bother taking the time out of your so busy schedule to make a pis* poor comment like that? Sit around the house watching football!!!Get a life. To all the posters that do have a life and like to get out and fish, I prefer fishing in September, no bugs, warm days usually, cool nights for sleeping and yes, fish deep. Nothing like a fresh feed of walleye and grouse for dinner."

524027,Wenty,2002-09-06 06:20:00,15,"To tracker and lcw,Sorry that my misguided humor was taken the wrong way by you guys. Fact is I love fishing in September, and one of the best parts of Fall fishing is having the lake to ones' self. As for personal worth lcw, don't go there. I own all the toys that anybody could ask for. Didn't mean to offend anyone."
524028,tracker,2002-09-06 14:46:00,91,Thanks for clearing that up wenty. There has been a lot of concern about negative responses to posts and I take offense everytime I read one. I also like fishing in September because after Labor day weekend a majority of boats are put away. I quess I should fess up on the issue of watching sports on TV. I do like to watch NASCAR every now and than.
524029,Guest,2002-09-06 15:08:00,0,"I got your humor the first time around Wenty, but I can see how it could be misconstrued. I, too, am a big fan of fall fishing in Ontario. Always go up for 10 days in early Oct. Fall colors, migrating waterfowl, crisp nights, and great fishing. Also, no one on the lake, which I take it Wenty appreciates too."
524030,Guest,2002-09-06 16:09:00,0,"ok wenty, now i gotcha. fish on my friend."
