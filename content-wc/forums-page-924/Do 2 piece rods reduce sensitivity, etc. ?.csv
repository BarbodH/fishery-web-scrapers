523947,Guest,2002-09-04 13:29:00,0,"Bob, good question and good observancy. I hope I can write this so it makes sense. In many cases a one pc. rod will physically weight more than a one pc. rod. Why, I really don't have a good answer. In many cases the two were not designed side by side, or maybe two people designed them. However, if you pick up the two in many cases the one pc. will seem lighter because of the weight placement. One pc. rods don't have that extra weight halfway down the blank at the ferrule. Most of the weight in a one pc. is down closer to your hand. Take a penny and tape it in the middle of your rod and pick it up. Then take that penny and tape it to the end and pick it up again. You'll notice a big difference, and the weight is the same. This same theory applies to a two pc. rod in many cases. The moment = force x distance. However, you are correct in that the one pc. might weight more than the two pc.. So back to the sensitivity thing. The energy being transmitted up to your hand will hit that mass of weight at the ferrule and some will be lost there. Hope that helps. Thanks for the question, and sorry for the confusion.Jason B."

Not wanting one and buy it anyhow. Fenwick offers the 7ft HMXS70M-2 which is also reasonably priced with performance. In my mind 2pc cast better and are still pretty sensitive. There is a loss of sensitivity. As for casting sensitivity may be less of an issue anyhow. CD rods out of New Zealand affiliated with Cortland still makes rods with the female ferrule in the handle half, this speeds any rod up and with power also. Got any of or info about them in Canada? Here in America they just offer this with flyrods anymore.Family, Freedom and FishingRuss"
523937,Guest,2002-08-31 10:16:00,0,Shopping for a new walleye spinning rod primarily for rigging. Will a 2 piece rod do any significant harm to sensitivity and feel?
523938,Guest,2002-08-31 10:59:00,0,"Back when rods had metal ferrules, most definitely. However, with today's materials, IMHO, the difference is negligible. Of course, you will get opinions stating otherwise, and that is OK, because everyone should use what they have the most confidence in. But, here is a good way to decide for yourself.Have both a one piece and two piece rod of the same make/model available. Close your eyes, and have a friend randomly select one of the rods and hand it to you. Grip the rod, then have your friend put the tip of the rod to his throat and with a normal voice, say ""99"". Then, try the other rod, again eyes closed. Next, he should randomly select out the rod again and again, doing the same thing. It is OK if he gives you the same rod twice in a row to mix it up. Your friend will need to keep track of your responses to assess accuracy.After enough trials, your friend's score keeping should be able to tell the tale."
523939,Guest,2002-08-31 15:44:00,0,"If you want the ultimate Walleye rod you should go with the 1 piece.A one piece outperforms a 2 piece rod hands down when it comes to the light ""mouthing"" that Walleye are famous for.I have to dis-agree with the above post on putting it to your throat and saying ""99""..... ""69"" , ""29"" , ""2"", Whatever...... that fact of the mater is Walleye don't talk to you when they are down below the boat and even if they could they wouldn't be touching the rod tip to do so.A good Walleye rod requires you to use good quality line to go with it. There is no sense in buying the best money can buy and chimp out of the ""daily"" sport store special line..... this doesn't work PERIOD!A one piece rod has nothing to nagate the sensitivity of even the slightest touch, but a 2 piece does. Look at it this way... A one piece is tapered from the butt to the tip... a 1 piece is tapered then you get a nice big buldge in the middle....... well this nice big buldge translates into trapped air and a dead zone..Go with a 1 piece if you have the means to move it safely without busting it in the trunk, but most go with a 2 piece because of the size limitations and ease of breaking it.I would suggest a G-LOOMIS if your looking for a real nice 1 piece rod."
523940,Stillwater,2002-09-01 11:47:00,87,"I was at St. Croix rods factory in Park Falls yesterday to order an 8 foot, 2 piece rod, it cost me $10 extra for the 2 piece. (It will be custom built) I wanted the 2 piece because of rod locker space.I have talked to St. Croix and G. Loomis about the sensitivity and they say it is negligable, they would really like to put out 2,3 and even 4 piece rods, but the general fishing public thinks that 1 piece are more sensitive, and maybe they are, but not enough that anyone can notice. (It would also cost about $10 more per joint, and most fisherman are not going to pay $10 more for a jointed rod).I own 4 St. Croix, 2 Fenwick, 2 G. Loomis, 2 Berkelys,... my fishing partner owns about the same. Some are 1 piece and some are 2. They go from 6'2"" to 8'6"". They are all good rods. Actually, one of my old St. Croix Premier rods (6'2"") is jointed, but I had to custom order an 8' to get it in 2 piece.Buy a quality rod, 1 or 2 piece...enjoy"
523941,Guest,2002-09-01 12:51:00,0,"guys, appreciate all your imput. i fear that with my gnarled old hands that it will not make a big difference. i find that at my age, i cannot feel things that i used to be able to. call it arthritis, nerve damage, carpal tunnel, radiated ulnar nerve or whatever. time has taken the toll on my sense of feel. the airlines are getting so picky about luggage size that i think i need to go with a 2 piece. thanks"

523943,Walleye Wacker,2002-09-01 15:26:00,6,90% of the time I fish with an open bail and my finger on the line. this method affords me more sensibility than depending on my hands to feel the rod tick or vibration. It also offers me the opportunity to release line easier if Im fishing with a crawler and the hangersare biting. The other 10% of the time Im dragging a crank bait and any rod with some backbone works for that.
523944,Guest,2002-09-03 15:01:00,0,"If you have no hard core reason to use a two pc., then stick with a one pc.. A one pc. will perform slightly better from an engineering standpoint. Two pc. rods are slightly heavier due to added materials we need to put in them at the ferrules. The one pc. have a little less mass, which will not absorb as much of the energy transmitted as a two pc. would. Again it is minimal, and not a big thing to worry about. My suggestion would be to stick with a one pc. unless you need to travel or store it in a tight spot.JasonSt. Croix Blank Designer"
523945,Guest,2002-09-03 15:23:00,0,"jason, thanks. i was born and raised in the midwest and now live on the east coast. makes for a long drive to northwest ontario. it was a long drive from the midwest. the airlines are really getting picky about luggage size. american airlines, for example can charge you $80 for a decent size rod tube. most are using a 62 inch rule (combined length, width and depth combined). southwest only charges $10. all have differing upcharges. sometimes they are enforced and sometimes not. based on the info i have gotten here, believe i have to opt for a 2 piecer. thanks again."
523946,Guest,2002-09-03 16:40:00,0,"Jason, while I agree with most of what you said, I noted that the blank weights for alot of the Avid series rods are heavier in the one piece. For instance, one of my favorites, the 3S70MLF blank weight is 1.79 oz and the 3S70MLF2 blank weight is noted to be 1.56 oz. This seems to hold true for the same model number 1 vs 2 piece rod in this line. Now I am not sure as I didn't check this, but is the butt diameter different between the one and two piece and does this account for the extra weight? Curious to your answer. Thanks."
