The road is kept wet--my Yarcraft turned brown, but there is a selfservice car wash in Dryden. It takes loonies only-you will probably need one for the vehicle and one for the boat. Also, the south bound lane north of the gravel is the worst I have seen it since before the road was paved. Be careful.Also, there were no leeches available in Fort Frances, Dryden or Sioux Lookout.And, Ojibway Baits in Sioux Lookout is closed. They have opened a store on the lake--I suppose at Chamberlain.But the bite is awesome as usual."
523774,Guest,2002-08-28 05:51:00,0,When did Ojibway baits closed in Sioux Lookout? I was just there Aug 21st.
523775,srj,2002-08-28 06:28:00,971,"Jabs, we stopped there on Friday the 23rd--the door was locked and the sign on the road mentioned the store on Lac Seul was now open. There was a moving van in front of the old gift shop. Everyone in town seemed surprised too. Ken moves fast."
523776,Guest,2002-08-28 17:02:00,0,"Wow, maybe I should get the old place and open a better and more affordable tackle place there?There prices were wayyyyyy out of line.....I looked at the price of a Mepps.... $7/Cdn when you can get them at wally world in Dryden for about $3.00.I'm seriously thinking of opening a more affordable place around Sioux Lookout for all Hunting/Fishing needs....What do you all think?Outdoorzman"
523777,srj,2002-08-29 06:25:00,971,I always thought Ojibway was a gold mine. Maybe not. But it would sure be nice to have a tackle store with decent parking in the area. Go for it!!
523778,IaDave,2002-09-05 14:48:00,476,Anybody been on Hwy 502 lately?
523779,2746,2002-09-06 07:08:00,3206,Came back that way last saturday. There is a stretch of gravel but didn't think it seemed 10 miles long. Was hard a smooth but expect messey if raining. About 60% or more of the road is finished and in great shape. The balance a little rough but I didn't think that bad. I drive a pickup and pull a 17' Lund.
