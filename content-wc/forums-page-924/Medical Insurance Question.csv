With the structure that Canada has on its medical system, were you able to use USA insurance companies for payment, or was it on a COD type basis. Thanks."
524034,Karl,2002-09-04 19:10:00,63,"Ask your health insurance company specifically about Canada coverage. Most do, some don't. Mine will pay 100% for any ""life threatening emergency"", but only 50% for something like removing a treble hook from a finger."
524035,Guest,2002-09-05 05:46:00,0,Funny you should ask! Last month while I was fishing in Canada my 7 year old daughter became sick and we had to take here to two hospitals. It was COD. my carrier is BCBS.

I simply asked for an itemized bill and paid on the spot. I could have submitted it to my carrier when I got back to the states. I didn't bother because it was so close to my deductible. You will be pleasantly surprised at the charges, about half what they were in the states."

He then submitted to his ins. company when he got back in states. You can buy short term health ins for foriegn travel but I've not done it and don't know the cost.
524039,larry c,2002-09-09 12:45:00,3,My insurance company provides a guaranteed payment sheet to take into Canada.Has the coverages and toll free numbers listed.Haven't had to use it.It is not BC/BS.They never paid for me stateside.
