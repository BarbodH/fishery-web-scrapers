523952,JohnL,2002-09-01 13:41:00,5,What is your favorite time of year to fish in Ontario? I hear june is the most popular time for walleye.
523953,AL,2002-09-01 17:26:00,89,"John, My favorite time is opening week or the week after. I'm not sure if it's the long winter and the anticipation of getting back on the water or catching the fish in spawning conditions....We had an outstanding trip this year, our best ever, on opening week.AL"
523954,LUCKWI,2002-09-01 18:30:00,13,"John, We have went on or about June 5th every year for last 15 or so years.The fishing is usually good to great although the weather can be a little fickle.ROY"
523955,Fuzz,2002-09-02 09:24:00,85,"Early June is my favorite too. Summer is just getting under way. The walleyes are in shallow bays and if the weather is stable great snag-free fishing is available. Weather is iffy though this time of year.July is good also........there's a better chance of getting warm stable weather I think and fishing can be fantastic on the reefs and rock piles.........although you'll get more snags.I've been in Ontario also in late August for the past 3 years and haven't got nice weather yet, so I'm abandoning that plan in favor of June and July.Bottom line..........a good trip can be had any time if the weather is right. Fuzz"
523956,Mookie,2002-09-02 11:15:00,5,"For Walleye, it has to be the first couple of weeks after the opener.For greatest weather, it has to be September."
523957,phishfearme,2002-09-02 13:05:00,1242,"for years we went up around memorial day and frequently fought snow and wind and just lousy weather - but did catch many fish. but, for the last 10 years or so our trip has been over the 4th of july or canada day (july 1). the weather is so much more stable and comfortable and you may not catch fish at the same rate as early june but you can stay out much longer, much more comfortably - and - as a reslut catch just as many fish. typically the prices are abit less after july 1, but in the past few years i've noticed that this is no longer the case. it also used to be that a cabin that required a 6 man minimum until july 1 is now 6 men until late july."
523958,eyedoktr,2002-09-04 06:11:00,2426,"I rarely fish Ontario (Bay of Quinte) before the end of October, and then try to make a few more trips for the hard water season. I think in the last 10 years, I have only fished twice between the opening of the season and the end of October. I can't wait for the ice fishing season."
523959,Thumper,2002-09-04 17:20:00,133,Anytime you can get on the water is my favourite time. September with all of its foibles is my favourite though. Walleye and Grouse are thick this time of the year. We also do not have much company on the water.
523960,Guest,2002-09-06 10:01:00,0,"I've been fishing in Ontario from the opener to mid-October, and my favorite times are mid-Sept. to mid-October. The fall colors are beautiful, waterfowl are migrating, deer and moose are rutting, and the fishing for walleye, crappie and muskie can be fantastic. It's also nice to have a fire in the cabin and maybe an early snowfall. There's hardly any boat traffic, the summer cabins are boarded up, and there aren't any flies to fight. You can hit some rough weather, but on average the highs are in the 50s and the lows in the low 30s. You also can get some nice Indian summer days with highs in the 70s. I agree that anytime of the year is right for an Ontario fishing trip, but I'm looking forward to early Oct. when I leave for a 10 day trip to Ontario in the fall."
