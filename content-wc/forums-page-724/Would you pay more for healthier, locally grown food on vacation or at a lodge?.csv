That is why corn is mainly in the midwest. taters in the more northernly areas, etc. There is even the ""spot on the spot"" where really good this or that grow. (As in melons, etc. Soil types and climate pretty well dictate where the best plants are grown. We have a decent sized garden and some vegi's that just do poorly for us do great twenty miles south of here. Soil ph and a list of other agronomic factors dictate what we grow and what we buy. Just my 5 cents worth. Pooch"

We're also setting up some organic vegetable production in the area. This district also has a very low rate of pesticides or fertilizers used. Here's a link on the grass fed beef http://www.backtonaturebeef.com/"

553401,River_eye,2005-12-20 16:45:00,1486,"Most wouldn't, but more and more men are watching what they eat these days. If nobody would, then that's good to know as well."
