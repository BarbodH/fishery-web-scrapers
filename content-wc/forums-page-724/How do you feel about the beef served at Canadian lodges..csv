Generally, our locally produced beef tends to be healthier than most due to the cows consuming more grass (forage mixtures) than grains. But most lodge owners buy their beef wherever they can get the cheapest price. I want to find out whether you guys concerned about the food you're eating at American plan lodges. I have been a guide for 8 years, and part of me says that most guys even if they watch their diet, will eat anything at a lodge. Another part of me says that the typical customer is of the age that healthy eating is becoming much more of a priority. So please add your comments as well."
