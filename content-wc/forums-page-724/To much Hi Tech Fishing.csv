553164,Guest,2005-11-24 17:52:00,0,"How do you know that the electronics would say they are ""nonproducutive waters"" if your fish finder is off! ha just joking. I need them for depth but after that you have to out think the fish or at least be on par with them. Depth is huge and you cant tell how deep if you dont have a depth finder."
553183,Guest,2005-11-28 14:56:00,0,"I guess it's the capitalistic, consumer driven era that we live in that is to blame for all the gadgets. Some people are always looking to invent something new that will ""supposedly"" make our lives easier. Makes one wonder about what our kids will be using to catch fish in another 10, 20, 30 years. I have both a GPS and a Fishfinder in my boat. The GPS was a gift and hardly ever gets used. The sonar on the other hand is great for determining the depth and wouldn't be without it. The fuuny thing is that it seems to me that the majority of fish I catch just seem to hit out of the blue. I never noticed any hooks showing up before the fish hit."
553185,Bx2(IL),2005-11-28 19:56:00,62,"I use the GPS to find my way home after I've been meandering around all day in unfamiliar waters. I use the sonar to find depth and structure, not fish. I have caught fish in places where the sonar does not show them. If I lived on a lake where I would be able to fish it consistantly and learn the water, I probably would not need either sonar or GPS."
553194,Guest,2005-11-29 15:32:00,0,"Those cameras make fishing too easy. It reminds me of Goose hunting with no blindfold, which is too easy, as well. :):):):)"
553217,phern,2005-12-03 02:33:00,151,"For me, fishing is not just catching fish. I guess the hype for high tech equipment started with the pros fishing tournaments. Unlike most of us, they often fish in unknown waters. They can't spend years learning these waters. The faster they can find and record on a gps suitable structure and/or fish, the better. The pros are not out fishing just for the enjoyment.....they have to catch fish. Their high powered boats enable them to get as far and as fast as possible from other fishermen and to get to their predetermined spots first and then to race to the next spot as fast as possible. When ordinary fishermen saw the pros with their nice fish and what equipment they were using, of course these things became desireable. It's all a form of propaganda called ""publicity"". The manufacturers know this and are willing to pay for this because they know that the end result will be more profit. How many have actually caught more fish on their favourite lake or river since they have bought hi tech equipment and faster boats? Why do people almost always fish at the far end of the lake first. Don't they notice that people from the far end of the lake race to the other end too? My best spot for walleye is about 20 feet from where people launch their boats. I can leave the doors open on my van and listen to the radio when I fish. I cast my jigs towards shore about 10 feet from my canoe because the drop off is very steep and the bottom is full of logs....I have to fish as vertical as possible. The walleye bite in an area about the size of a kitchen table. When it gets warm, I can wade out and catch walleye just a rod's length away. Casts anywhere outside of this small area result in very few bites. When it gets dark and the fishermen return, I can see their catch on their fish chains as they haul their boats out. They ask if the fishing was good. Of course I say that the fishing was poor but I can see for myself that my catch is superior to theirs. Somehow, these guys never catch on to the fact that I am always fishing the same spot at dusk."
553220,Guest,2005-12-03 11:58:00,0,Well said Phern.
553498,Guest,2005-12-27 12:56:00,0,"Just because you know the fish are there doesn't mean you can catch them! If you only fish in good weather and lakes you know, then a GPS is a big waste of time. If you've been out on big water in bad weather, then that GPS can save your boat and just maybe your life. For some of us it's just a must have item. It was the only thing that kept us out serious trouble on Lake Erie one time. When you get old & maybe you just can't remember all those landmarks to those key walleye structures anymore on that particular lake. Those way points can make the difference between a busted boat or a live well full of legal walleyes. All a GPS does is help make the experience a good one instead of a bad one. My 2 cents. Thanks,"
553069,Guest,2005-11-14 19:01:00,0,"I agree, I'm 62 and I still have trouble adjusting to the new gadgets. I do have a GPS but get confused on how to use it at times. Last year ice fishing in my house, a friend was using an fl-18 and had a #### of a time pulling up his fish and keeping the transducer from getting tangled with his line. By the end of our trip we each caught about the same amount of fish. For me, it's more enjoyable not knowing when the fish is going to bite. Ron"

553070,Guest,2005-11-14 19:38:00,0,"It seems as though the hi-tech stuff reduces the challenge and gives the angler a distinct advantage over the fish. Now what rewards can one get -knowing that they had an upper hand? Maybe I am all wrong but it seems to me that more surprize and feeling of accomplishment would come from using less hi-tech stuff. However this is based on the premise that catching fish is essential to having a good fishing experience. Myself, just going is great-catching fish is an added bonus. There is a certain amount of self healing and meditation which can be obtained just being out on the water and having time to reflect on life. Paul"

553081,Guest,2005-11-14 21:22:00,0,"I'll tell you what- Fishing's alot more interesting when nothing is biting, if you have all these electronics to entertain yourself. No joke."
553094,Wisconeye,2005-11-15 21:19:00,79,"This is an interesting discussion and one that was quite popular a few years ago among bow-hunters. Some enjoyed the advantage of compounds while other prefered the more primitive long bows. I use a lot of hi-tech and don't think it increases my success much, if at all, but the time I spend learning I think is valuable. But I also remember the days of bluegills and cane poles and those were some of the most memorable. The beauty of this is that we have the choice, and the opportunity to pursue our sport in any manner we choose."
553096,Guest,2005-11-16 14:46:00,0,This kind of reminds me of the discussion my son and I had regarding instant replay in baseball.
553097,Guest,2005-11-16 15:49:00,0,Dont have much of that Hi Tech stuff. But my wife thought she had to have a hand held GPS so of course she has one even though the lake we fish on we have been on for 20 years and I know it better than I know her. The biggest advantage to the GPS is it keeps her busy and I get less questions from her. This makes the GPS a great value too me.
553118,Guest,2005-11-17 19:15:00,0,"The only one I have a problem with is Aqua View. Pretty close to cheating, or at least to bath tub fishing."
553159,Thunderstick,2005-11-24 06:01:00,35,"This used to frustrate me as well until I came to realize that no one was putting a gun to my head and making me buy or use the high-tech stuff. Often times I'll even turn off the ""fish finder"" and send my lure to places the electronics say are ""non-productive"" waters. Guess what? I caught fish. The simple thrill of fishing for me is the unknown factor. Technology often is a distraction. Success comes with experience and knowledge and, although technology can accelerate the process, it can delay it, as well. My suggestion is to utilize the level of technology you are comfortable with and enjoy the day."
553063,Guest,2005-11-14 14:50:00,0,"I know that Im an old fisherman but I just dont understand why we need all this GPS, Aqua View, Fish Finder equipment to enjoy fishing. For years we just used our knowledge and our know how which didnt require batteries to locate and catch fish. This fishing is getting more like a computer game my grandsons play instead of fishing. it took me years before I bought an Aluminum boat with a bigger engine than 10HP and I still have an old Flasher unit to help me find the depth. Wouldnt have that except my Son gave it to me for Xmas and my wife makes me use it. Dont get me wrong I dont fault anyone with all the bells and whistles...I just think the old way is more rewarding."

553067,Guest,2005-11-14 18:33:00,0,I see your point but I will say that a GPS has possibly saved my life a few times getting back in bad weather. Once upon a time an outboard was considered high tech.

For me, I work a lot of hours to enjoy my hobby so when I do get time off to go fishing it is very valuable to me. If the modern products get me on fish faster then I have more time to enjoy everything going on around me in nature. If i'm not catching fish, then thats okay to, but at least I know I gave it my best shot and I still get to enjoy nature."
