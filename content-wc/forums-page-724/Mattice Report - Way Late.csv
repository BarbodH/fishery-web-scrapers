This was my first trip with them, and went to their Weese Lake Outpost. We picked (not so great of a time as far as conditions/seasons)being the first week in August 2005. Yea, I know why the wait to report? Just had not got around to it. Anyway, I will say this.""You will not find a better Outfitter than Don and Annette Elliot! Period. They 'Walk the Talk' There accomodations in my humble opinion were unmatched, and I can't say enough about the way they take care of their guests. For the money, I do not think they can be beat - Just my opinion. If you have a better outfitter please respond, as I always would like to know about other options. Now, for the fishing. We struggled for the first day and 1/2.Catching only a very few eyes and hammer handle Northerns. Weather=Hot 90-95 degrees, and bright blistering Sunshine! However we did get them figured out, and did redeem ourselves to some degree. We caught approximately 450 Eyes for the week, averaging 2 1/2 -3 1/2lbs. The 4 's were few and far between, but we did get a few. My personal biggest was a 26"" Walleye for the week. Largest Pike was 8lbs. We would have liked more Pike action, but we were not there at the right time for it. We went totally plastic at first, but we changed in a hurry when we found the Eyes wanted crawlers. Rest of the week was jigs and crawlers for the eyes with chartreuse and brown/orange combos working the best for us. Fish were found shallow but only in the early mornings and evenings. You just quit after about 11AM, napped, ate lunch or whatever, cause they were done until about 3PM. Once evening came around, the bite was back on. Several evenings it was literally a fish on every cast! That was truly incredible especially with the hot conditions. I found Weese a bit shallow for my preference overall, and we did a lot of our fishing around the large Island directly in front of the cabin. The fish were there. We did navigate thru the 'narrows' to the back part of the lake on several occasions, but did not get the opportunity to really hit the area as hard as i would have liked due to high wind- I believe that area has true potential too, and I took my 26"" back there with several other good fish! But oh Nellie watch out for the rocks! I am in hopes of going back to Mattice, but would like to see a better time as far as ""bigger' fish overall and more, larger Pike. Any of you guys that have been in September, please tell me where you went, and how it was with Mattice's Lakes at that time. We are actually looking at Whitewater this coming year, but I just do not know about the overall pressure it receives? My overall trip was really good with Mattice. No complaints about the operation, or the accomodations or the excellent service. I would like to find more and a bit better quality fish, and maybe a different time would have produced that for us on Don and Annettes outposts. Any comments, or your personal experience with Mattice would be welcome as I would like to plan another trip this September. Mike"
553406,515,2005-12-20 21:39:00,254,Great report. I think we all got hit by the heat this year while on the annual trip. Makes for long days on the water and in the camps but still sounds like you had a great time. Mike
553409,jigman 2003,2005-12-21 07:19:00,981,"Hey Mike-I did respond to your email (I think it was yours?), but I'll post here too. I don't have experience with Weese, but have fished Vick and Pringle for a number of years. Last year we went to Ogoki. I believe that for as long as I use MLO, I will go back to Ogoki. It is large, but not that difficult to figure out. I did get some help from a WC guy before I went. He sent me some maps, I'd be happy to share them with you if you go. The fish tended to be a little larger than on the single cabin lakes and there were plenty of them. You are right on the accomodations and service. Don, Annette, Jason and Yolanda run a great operation. Friendly, personable, and professional. I am sure that better fishing exists somewhere, but for the money I don't think MLO can be beat."
553417,Stauff,2005-12-21 13:59:00,110,"Only been there once - went to the Ogoki Reservoir with Mattice. We were there the first week of July which seemed to be pretty good timing for having an enjoyable trip. Mornings and afternoons could tend to be spotty with walleye, but hold on in the evenings. Our largest pike was a 45"" taken by trolling a chrome Big O crankbait across a point one evening. Most walleye came with jig & chartruse twister tail or floating head tipped with crawler slightly off bottom. We did get our fair share of 25"" and 26"" eyes. We never ran out of new places to explore in the week that we were there, and I'd go back in a heartbeat. Highly recommended. Stauff"
553424,Mike1973,2005-12-21 20:12:00,7,"Yes, Jigman, that was my e-mail, and thank you for your input! It is certainly good to get others opinions, and especially if they have been elsewhere with even better results. Might just go to Ogoki this time. Mike"
553425,jigman 2003,2005-12-22 07:28:00,981,"Yeah, that is one of the draws for me to go back to Ogoki. There is so much water that you can always find new places to fish. There are enough islands, points, narrows, etc. to insure that the waves don't get to the point that it is dangerous or unfishable. Always somewhere to fish out of the wind if you want. When the wind blows aroud 10 mph just find a wind swept point and you'll have all the action you need. During the day we trolled some of the islands with BIG cranks for pike. We ended up catching more 'eyes than pike."
