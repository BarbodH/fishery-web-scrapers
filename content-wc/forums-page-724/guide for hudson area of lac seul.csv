Guys like me with a 25hp motor, stay around the Websters Bay, Italian Bay and Kewatin Bay areas. Everything listed above has a bit of water between them, but, the fish are pretty much all over. Find wind blown points, deep holes, follow the gulls....you'll find them. But, if you're hiring a guide, shouldn't they know 'the spots'? lol"

[email protected] heck if you are up there the third week, i can show you where we are getting them."
