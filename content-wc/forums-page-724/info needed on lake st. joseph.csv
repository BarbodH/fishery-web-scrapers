553174,scar,2005-11-27 09:08:00,196,looking for a day trip to this lake. i understand that tags are needed to fish it.are tags available for 1 or 2 days with out staying at a camp on the lake? anyone have any idea who to contact or how much a tag would be. stay in sioux lookout area and fish minitakki and lac seul. how does lake st. joe compare to lac seul-would it be a waist of time/money? scar
553176,Fred_G,2005-11-27 10:00:00,908,"Lake St. Joseph tags are provided by the camp operators on the lake. You have to stay at one of the camps to fish the lake. The camps are usually booked full for the season, so I doubt any of the owners would sell a tag. Having never fished Lac Seul I can't compare the fishing on St Joe to that of Lac Seul. I have fished St Joe for a number of years and believe that the fishing is awesome. A couple of guys in our group went to Lac Seul several years ago and comment that fishing on St Joe is comparable. We do very well, and sometimes have a hard time finding fish small enough to keep. If you decide to go to St Joe for a week, I would highly recommend a guide for the first couple of days. There a lots of hazards and it's always best to have an idea where to find the fish."
553180,Guest,2005-11-28 08:56:00,0,"I have fished both lakes. Lac Seul is a much shorter trip for our group. I feel the fishing is very similar with one exception. Walleyes get bigger in Lac Seul and you have a chance for a 28-30 incher. We could not get a walleye over 25 inches at St Joe and we caught hundreds. St Joe has more underwater dangers(rocks) but if you are careful and go slow at the right places you will be OK. Lac Seul is more crowded but this is relative, we usually see a few boats each day, on St Joe we didn't see any other boats once we left the landing. The Old Post is where we stayed and it was very nice. It also has a very nice bar so after fishing all day you can sample some Labatts. You can't go wrong at either place."

553182,Guest,2005-11-28 13:05:00,0,"We have fished Lac Seul out of Scout Lake, Mahkwa, and Silver Water Wheel and found fishing to be the same. That is, great everwhere. I am sure the Hudson area would be similar but I have not fished there."

553195,Fred_G,2005-11-29 19:54:00,908,"Here is an excerpt from The Old Post & Village website which helps to explain the tag system: Lake St. Joseph supports a very high quality sport fisheries along with very limited commercial fish harvested to the local native community. In 1989, a unique regulation established an accord between the Ministry of Natural Resources and tourist operators on the lake. Lake St. Joseph is now under the mandate of this Lake St. Joseph Accord. In order to assist the MNR with fisheries management, an advisory committee consisting of local native band members, tourism representatives and Lake St. Joseph camp operators were established. A tag system was put into effect in order to control the number of guests that may be accommodated on the lake. Through its allotment, this tag system allows 1786 fishermen annually. The Old Post and Village own a quota of 756 tags. It is a strong marketing tool where exclusivity and a controlled environment can be promoted. This along with the fact that there is no opportunity for further development on the lake or utilization by day trippers or campers ensures that high quality fisheries is sustained indefinitely. I have been fishing the lake since 1997 and have seen the improvement in the fishery first hand. It's a great lake to fish, and I highly recommend that you make a trip up there for a few days. I'm sure you would enjoy it."

553449,Guest,2005-12-23 14:49:00,0,"Fished St Joe several years ago. Stayed at Old Post Village, very nice. Lake poorly mapped, lots of hazards, need a guide or to follow one. Had to run an hour and a half each way to get to mega walleyes. Caught all fish on a quad tail(white) with a 1/2 ounce jig, just thumping it up and down right near the black rock shorelines in 20',this was late summer. Some reason black rock, you won't know about it until you see it, produces better. Early season, walleyes in the bays. Have to know what you are doing. Tags are right, have to stay with an outfitter. Found it no better than northeatern Lac Seul and actually no better than the Woods was five years ago. It is the land of the lawless natives so you have to be careful about leaving your vehicle. We parked our cars at a local business who locked them in chain fenced area and had dogs patrolling at night otherwise they would be stripped if you left them at the landing. Would not ever take my own boat although I did and cracked a rock. I was careful, water is stained, map terrible. Doesn't show the hazards. All in all good fishery but truthfully you don't have to go to that extreme. Nice northerns on St. Joe. Lots in 40"" class."
