553496,Guest,2005-12-27 10:49:00,0,2006 will only be our 3rd trip to LOTW and the last 2 yrs we went the 3rd(19-26)week of June & we are changing this year to June 3-10 as our resort owner said year in/out fishing is typically better earlier. We are basically smb fishermen. It always hinges on mother nature. good luck.
