553259,Guest,2005-12-11 17:06:00,0,"www.womanriver.com Great place, very remote, dark tea stained water, you'll seldom see another boat, (unless there are Minnesotans in camp), access to tons of fishing and wild life. The access to the camp is from a gravel road, about 40 km or so. If you have your own boat, you may consider a rental. Sometimes the road gets beat up with the logging trucks, not to mention dust, if they don't put calcium down on the road. Fishing at the falls is breath taking (and loud.) Once a moose walked right past me while I was fishing at the falls, I didn't even see it, or hear it. I saw it's tracks on the trail when I left........"
