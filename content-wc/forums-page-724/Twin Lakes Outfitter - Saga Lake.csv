We did very well, though we only fish for walleye. The largest caught was 26 and a half inches with many in the 18-22 inch range. The cabin was ok, but had no running water or solar shower as many fly-ins now have. Boat and motors were fine, aircraft ok--though I'm not sure Twin Lakes has their own service now. For most of those 20 years we went with Leuenbergers out of Nakina, still would if the costs for myself and 2 grandsons were less. If I were to take a fly-in again, I wouldn't hestitate to use Twin Lakes and go to Saga again."

553402,Guest,2005-12-20 17:14:00,0,"Hey guys, just wondering if anyone has any experience with this outfitter in Nakina, and Saga Lake in particular. Thinking of a mid June trip and am mainly interested in the quality of fishing at Saga and on secondary note what the cabin is like. ANY thoughts/input greatly appreciated!"
553407,515,2005-12-20 21:40:00,254,I have never traveled with them but have been to a few lakes in the area and the fishing has been great. I would imagine all the lakes are quite similar so you should have a great time. Mike
553413,Guest,2005-12-21 11:07:00,0,"For the last 2 years I have gone with them - easy to work with. Was not to Saga, but had great fishing"
553416,Guest,2005-12-21 13:45:00,0,"Thanks for both of your responses. I've actually flown out of Nakina several times before and always had good fishing, but first hand experiences are always helpful. Paul, I'd love to know which lakes you actually did fish with Twin Lakes. A lot of their lakes are perhaps a bit smaller than the norm up there, wouldn't mind knowing if they're all decent producers. One things for sure, their rates are pretty hard to beat."

553427,Guest,2005-12-22 10:31:00,0,"Sorry, new to site...2 trips with twin lakes. Saga last year, Dusey year before. I believe twin lakes does not go to Dusey anymore. I have flown with a couple outfitters over the years. A couple things we look for are $ and only cabin on the lake. Saga fulfilled those requirements. From the research I've done on flyins, I've come to the conclusion, you get what you pay for. The cabin is functional, but...if you're in the midst of mosquito season, be prepared the have company in the cabin. The lake is small and shallow, although plenty of spots to find some fish. It has a deep river system that runs in. We caught many dink walleyes there. Maybe earlier in the season the bigger ones can be had, too. We had our best luck fishing the ""cut through"" straight out and to the right of the cabin. A channel runs through there that is a litter deeper. Had a couple big northerns glom on to your walleyes while you were reeling them in, but did not catch any big northerns. We had beautiful blue bird days, so fishing was tough. The guys who got up early did good. What's good? To me 100 a day/person. To some 20. We were in the 20 range, excluding the dinks. So all in all, worth the money. The hosts are good, the pilots are good, boats and motors good, the cabin disappointing, the lake in general was disappointing, but hey it's a flyin, the price is right, cold beer, plenty of fried and grilled walleye, a week away from work, so worth a shot. PS They do go to a lake that is much larger, fishing I'm told is better, but there are 3 cabins on the lake. If you don't mind other people around, it sounds like a better fishing lake. Hope this helps."
