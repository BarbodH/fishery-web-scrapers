Know of any good resorts to stay at, or resorts to stay away from. Just me my wife and the dog. I've always wondered about Rainy Lake everytime we drive over it going farther north. Any info would be appreciated."

If you want to catch fish, have a chance at a trophy fish, enjoy the beauty of Voyaguers (sp) Park and have some good shops for the wife to browse in, than do not cross that bridge!! You can call the chamber of commerce at 1-800-FALLS MN and they will send out a packet. Enjoy."

553345,Guest,2005-12-16 22:02:00,0,It would be nice not to drive further-how far do you travel to spots on Rainy and is it allot of open water motoring and fishing in bigeer parts of lake? thanks
553359,Guest,2005-12-17 23:14:00,0,"We have the best walleye and smallie fishing on the Canadian side of Rainy, but we typically stay on the US side. It requires us to get a Remote Crossing Permit ahead of time. Also, you cannot take live bait across, except for maybe crawlers in dirt, but we don't take live bait anymore for walleye. Having to cross back and forth from the US and Canadian side requires you to travel open water. We've been there in early summer, late summer and fall and have encountered days where the wind was quite heavy. Crossing to/from the Canadian side can be tough at times since many parts of Rainy are pretty big and open. You'll want to watch the weather and wind, and plan accordingly. We've fished the US side for walleye, and that also usually involves traveling open water and fair distances to get to the better reefs, bars, etc. And the best fishing seems to be on those wind-blown days with a good walleye chop on the water.
