553246,Whopper,2005-12-08 14:31:00,340,Looking for any info and or comments on Lake Holinshead that is located north of Thunder Bay and southwest of Armstrong. Looking at going there next July. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in Advance!
553303,Guest,2005-12-14 16:40:00,0,I've fished the lake for many years. It is a great producer. I've done well early and late in the season. I find the boats at the resort small for a full day on the water. Other than that I look forward to fishing it again in the Spring.

It took us a couple of days to figure that out - all of our other trips to Canada were fly-ins where we used nothing but artificials. A lot of locals and Minnesotans go there to fill up the freezer. The owner and his family are great. accommodations wre nice. Email me at [email protected] for more info."
553370,Whopper,2005-12-18 19:38:00,340,Thanks for the info. Not looking to fill the freezer but a nice place for my son and I to catch some walleyes and pike and generally any place we go we take in nightcrawlers with us.

Structure, baits, depths, number of walleye/northern, size of lake, and anything else we may need to know. We usually take our own boats...any problem with that? Also, the price is somewhat higher than other drive in lakes...is there a good reason for that? The $ is not a stopper, but I am curious. Have made many trips to Ontario and do a lot of walleye fishing, so details are fine if you have the time. Thanks in advance!"
553420,Guest,2005-12-21 17:32:00,0,I've never seen other boats at the resort. I don't know the reason. Best check with the outfitter.
553430,Guest,2005-12-22 11:50:00,0,"Just curious, would you happen to be the same Dr. Lee from Indiana that our group met this past season at Caribou Lake Lodge? Also, I have fished a fly in lake near Hollinshead (Gillard Lake). That was several years ago, but I recall the road that led to Hollinshead off the highway was in really bad shape. It may have been improved since then, as that was back around 1990."
