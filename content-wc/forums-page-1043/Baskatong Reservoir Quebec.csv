510434,Seaway Mike,2001-01-01 09:54:00,1,I have been fishing La Verendrye Park in Quebec for the past 25 years. The Baskatong Reservoir is just south of La Verendrye Park and according to sources is a commercial Walleye fishery that is maintained with a stocking program. Since there are a few lodges on the lake I was wondering horw the fishing has been. Apparently the fishery has made a strong comeback! Last year I was a seasonal camper in the park and had variable success. I would be happy to share my knowledge.

Recently due to increased fishing pressure and the netting, there hasn't been the size or quantity of Walleyes that there used to be. I fished the Baskatong 3 years ago without much success although it was more of a camping trip than a fishing trip (no minnows). I haven't heard about them stocking Walleyes in the area and I really don't think it would be necessary. It always used to be a good producer of Walleyes and Pike (big Pike-10# +). I'll be going up again this Fall and will be going out of Pointe David. Keep your line wet!"
