I realize that temperature, weather, water level, etc. all play factors into how deep the trout will be. I would appreciate any suggestions as to baits and techniques to try.Thanks"

I use a 1 1/2 oz jig with a Gary Yamamoto 6"" split tail grub although any deep fished jig should work. Buzz bombs, Heddon sonars, Fuzzy Duzits worl well. Drop em done to bottom and reel in like a mad man. They will catch fish.The best spots will be adjacent to some deep off shore structure and a map will accelerate the finding process. Whitefish Bay is a fine area to fish for the grey beasts.good LuckJeff"
