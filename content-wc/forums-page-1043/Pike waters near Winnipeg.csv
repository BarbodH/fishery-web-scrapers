510443,Guest,2001-01-02 13:35:00,0,I'm looking to do some ice fishing for pike. What lakes relatively close to Winnipeg are best for Northerns? I appreciate any help out there.

I don't do a whole lot of ice fishing, but I know there is really good pike action on the winnipeg river at pointe du bois. You will need a snowmobile to get there. Also, Whitemouth lake is not bad, plus there is usually a road on the ice to drive your vehicle out there.I'm also interested in what other lakes there are near winnipeg.River eye"
510445,gofish,2001-01-03 09:53:00,24,Try Big Whiteshell Lake as well as Bird Lake. I know some people even try Netley Creek at the end of Main. I've tried it there before with limited success.
