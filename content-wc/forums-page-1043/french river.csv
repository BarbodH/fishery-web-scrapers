510370,Guest,2000-12-26 13:27:00,0,I would suggest that you stay as close to lake nippising as possible. We fished the French a few years ago and found that the indians were netting most of the fish on the lower french river . Hope this helps you some. [email protected]

510373,Guest,2001-01-06 09:22:00,0,Bobby:Take a look at the message posted by Jesse-WI on 2 Jan aboutOntario fishing regulations being available on the net. The URL he posted works and map C is the one you are interested in. You need Acrobat to read but its available on the site if you don't already have it. I scrolled down to see Division 27 (Lake Nipissing and French River) and then printed out the page. Much of the information you wanted is there. Jay
510374,Guest,2001-01-06 09:34:00,0,Bobby:Had to look up web site address before I could respond to your question about lodges. You'll find help at the following web site: http://www.linksnorth.comGood luck finding something to satisfy your needs. Jay
