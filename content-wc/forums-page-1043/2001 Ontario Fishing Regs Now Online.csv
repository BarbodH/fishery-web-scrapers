510413,rodbuster,2001-01-01 16:52:00,164,Thanks for the info.GOING NORTH NEXT SPRING.(FROM OHIO)Do you know if I fish for 3 days can I bring back a 1 day limit or 3 1 day limits? Or dose it depend on where and what your fishing for?Thanks if you know.
510414,Frank from TBay,2001-01-01 18:21:00,312,"There are a lot of questions here. Depends what area of the province and where you are staying. Ontario is a huge place.You may be able to take one days limit home, thats the max in the province or you may only be able to take a conservation limit if you are camping on crown land. If you are in the boundary waters area it is different again.Take the time to know the regs. Our CO's have a zero tollerance for infractions and you will be charged if you are in violation of the laws. Read the regs for the area where you will be fishing. Frank"
510415,rodbuster,2001-01-01 19:19:00,164,Frank plan on salmon fishing Owen Sound.Do I call someone in Owen Sound? The regs that were posted have some what ifs in them.Your right I don't want to get it wrong.
510416,Frank from TBay,2001-01-02 16:49:00,312,"The CO's are there to help you. If you have any particular questions on the regs they will be more than willing to help you. There is a list of offices with numbers, call the office nearest where you are going and express your concern. You might also want to ask the CO how everyone is doing and whats hot. They are a valuable source of good info. Hope this helps: Frank"
