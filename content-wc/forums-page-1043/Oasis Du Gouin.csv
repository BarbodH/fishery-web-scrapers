510425,duffy,2000-12-31 18:13:00,49,I have not been to this place however I have met the owner at sport show in NJ. I was not immpressed with what he was telling me regarding the fishing. That is big water and too tough to fish for my skills. I also have not had success in Quebec with hospitalitly. Follow tylers advice and go to North western Ontario or Manitoba. Take care.Duffy
