I have done the best in the Scaler lake area and up at Aneminus.I don't think any resorts are open and I have only seen a few other people on the lake fishing, while on the Suel. We usually camp on the ice and some times stay in Souix Lookout at a hotel and travel up the Vermillion River road and access lake Suel that way.It can be frightingly cold up there. Portable fish shacks are a must!Jeff"
