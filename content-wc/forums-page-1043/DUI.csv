510406,chadk66,2001-01-01 20:18:00,1650,I have entered canada at least 100 times all across north dakota border crossings. I have never been asked that question. I would say the odds of that happening if your buddy wasn't driving are extremely low. I really don't think I'd worry about it.
510407,Backwater Eddy,2001-01-02 02:38:00,3871,"They run your plate's Chad, they do a random ID on all occupants of the vehicles an the FBI computer has all your info right on there screen. The US and Canada share the same FBI link data base of offenders.All are scanned as of this year, 1 in 4 are document checked but expect it to get tighter yet due to illegal immigration problems from the north into the US is a hot issue.I have seen many guy's turned back for DUI's or outstanding traffic warrents.BE........><,,>"
510408,chadk66,2001-01-02 20:42:00,1650,"thats kind of a crapper eddie. I didn't realize they were getting that strict. I can understand coming into here as far as imigration goes. I really can't understand the big problem with a person going into canada if they had a dui if they aren't driving. It's not like they don't drink in canada, huh huh. I've always said there's only one other group of people that can party with the guys from wisconsin and thats the canadians. But I haven't met one I didn't like though. Played a lot of baseball tournament in southern saskatchewan and have some good friends up there. Great people."
510409,Backwater Eddy,2001-01-03 05:15:00,3871,"I think they worry our drunks are going to take there drunks home with them? :)The list of things has grown considerably to what they can deny you entrance to Canada. Some are there idea and others are at the request of the US authorities. So far I have not had any problems but who knows what's next?BE.....><,,>"

510397,Guest,2000-12-26 16:08:00,0,"Not just Ontario. Same deal to go into Sask.The Can. Customs people ask if you have had a ""DUI"" and if you answer affirmative...you will not get in, at least very easliy.Happened to more than one friend of mine.You see, they don't want Americans teaching them any bad habits!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~:D~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~:D~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"
510398,Frank from TBay,2000-12-26 16:26:00,312,Impaired driving as it is called in Canada is a serious federal offence. When you enter the country you must pass through a federal check point. If you are visiting Canada and have a record check with Immigration Canada and they will send you a Discretionary Entry Permit. Their website is on the net. They will look at the conviction and decide if we want you in our fair country. Hope this helps: Frank
510401,Jesse-WI,2000-12-26 20:21:00,534,"In 9 yrs and some 30 crossings, that questions has never been asked crossing at Int'l Falls. Since most questions are directed at the driver, just do not use their vechicle or let that person drive."
