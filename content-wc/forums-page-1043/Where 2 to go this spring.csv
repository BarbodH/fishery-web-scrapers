510330,Guest,2000-12-12 10:42:00,0,Okay I live south of Green Bay Wi.. I am looking to plan a 7 day fishing trip for spring walleye's. We can travel just about anywhere but would like to keep it to 10-15 hour drive. We have 15 foot boats. Would like some advice on finding a good place to fish walleye's. Would like to catch lots of eaters with a chance at a big one.. But catching alot over size is more important. We are pretty new to walleye fishing..thanks for the info on the earlier post. I hope this will give u better info to help us find a good place..thanks alot againnew2fishing
510331,Guest,2000-12-14 13:27:00,0,"I have had very good success at Anderson's Lodge just south of Sioux Lookout ONT. They have great cabins and there is alot of water there; Abrams Lake, Minnitaki, Pelican and even up into Lac Suel. They have a website: [email protected]Dick and the staff are great folks!Keep the bobber bobbing and bait on the hook!"
510332,Frank from TBay,2000-12-14 18:16:00,312,"Check out Holinshead Lake Resort, they are off HWY 527 the highway going to Armstrong. Maybe a little farther than you want to go but worth it. They offer flyins as well, but you won't need to. I fish the area adjacent to it and buddies go there. World class fishing and good people. They have a web site www.holinshead.com. Good luck: Frank"
510333,River_eye,2000-12-15 02:38:00,1486,"Hate to put a plug in for the resort that I work at, but it seems like it might be right up your alley.The place is called Eagle Nest Landing/Lodge both on the winnipeg river. The landing is a private resort that is accessible by hard topped roads. There is a small campground, boat launch, docks, boat rental and really nice cabins available. It's more of a do it your self place. It's about a 1 3/4 hour drive north east of Winnipeg. The lodge part is a 30 mile boat ride from the landing up the river, right near the ontario border. The fishing is awesome, cause it's more remote, it's also an american plan lodge, with meals, guides, boats all included in one price.Both are owned and operated by the same family, the lodge being more expensive for obvious reasons.www.eaglenest.mb.caRiver eye"
510334,Guest,2000-12-15 14:55:00,0,"I live close to Wausau. We go to Ear Falls and fish Lac Seul. We stay at Goldpines, but there are about 6 camps on the west end. We go the first full week of June. Lots of eaters. The slot size is 18-21 inches. Every year we catch many limits over the slot. We already have the ""wall hangers"" so we are trying to beat our personal bests.This is approximately 12-13 hour trip and that is not pushing it."
510335,Rob,2000-12-28 22:53:00,103,Check out Happylanding.org I've been up there three times and every trip has been better than the last. Hope to see you up there.
