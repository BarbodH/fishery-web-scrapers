573655,Guest,2008-05-07 22:14:00,0,"Thanks Bill, I took Harvey R. and Wayne Hampson down to Cliff Last year and they want to go back.I don't think we will be doing much walleye fish here in Red Lake for the opener sill alot of ice out there. The last week of May and the first 2 weeks of June should be awesome for big eyes."
573659,Glenman12,2008-05-08 05:40:00,762,Tackleman When you were passing Cliff Lake did you by chance take a look over at Cedar Lake?
573665,Guest,2008-05-08 08:19:00,0,"Glenman, I just had an email from Jerry & Ellie's regarding the ice....Ellie says there is still some snow in the woods and that the ice is now out a quite a few yards from shore and looking very gray. She figures most of it should go in the next few days."
573724,Guest,2008-05-09 07:33:00,0,When we went down on Wednesday it was open about 50 feet around where the creek comes in under the highway. On the way home yesterday it the bay the creek flows into was totally open and the ice was looking blacker.
