573162,Guest,2008-04-27 20:40:00,0,I see nothing wrong with my attitude. I said I intend to comply with the law and keep 1 fish over the slot. Whats wrong with that? If the Lac Seul outfitter complains to me that I have 1 fish over the slot it would seem to me he has a bad attitude. He is the one that will lose a friend and a future cliant. Last year the camp we went to had about 3 or 4 empty cabins. This was a camp near Ear falls. If the outfitter dont want us back im sure another camp will be happy for our business. The outfitter should be glad to have cliants that comply with the fishing regulations and not harrass them for complying with the law.
573167,Guest,2008-04-28 04:18:00,0,"The law does not require you to keep 1 fish over slot, it allows you to keep 1 over slot and we all know the intent was to provide a means for the purpose of mounting a trophy. Most camps that I know of follow that principal even though they are conservation minded and are trying to maintain the brood stock for future generations. However, it is difficult to convince ""meat"" fishermen to understand the concept who are only interested in ""me - today"". I'd like to suggest to the MNR to change the regulations to 4 fish under 18"" OR 1 fish over slot."
573168,Guest,2008-04-28 04:22:00,0,Well Vbay since when as a customer do I need to make friends with the owner. It would be great if you were friends but I stay at the Holiday Inn on the way up and I don't ask to meet the manager and take him to dinner. If you comply with the rules and you pay your bill you have done your part.
573169,Guest,2008-04-28 05:16:00,0,"Based on the posts it would seem LEGAL to have one over the slot, but what about my question on transporting fish/fillets back home? If you fillet the fish it would seem a ""judgement call"" on whether the fish was 17.75"" or 18.5"" long. I certainly don't want any trouble, so I want to know if the LAW reads to leave the head on(gut & gills out) for transport home. Thanks for the help !!"
573171,Guest,2008-04-28 05:45:00,0,"I have seen some guys fillet a 17 inch walleye and end up with a minnow sized fillet. I have seen some guys get every piece of meet possible off a fillet. I am in between. They do not judge the size of the fish as you are crossing the border. You need to leave a one inch patch of skin, and pack each fish in a separate bag so they can see there is only one fish in there. I have never made friends with a hotel clerk myself, but then again I have never asked as much from a hotel clerk as one does on a trip to Canada."
573172,Guest,2008-04-28 06:45:00,0,Just leave 1 inch of scales on the fillet. The wardens use a caliper to measure the distance between the scales if they suspect you have any slot fish. I heard they can tell within 1/8 inch how long the fish was before it was fillet.
573179,Guest,2008-04-28 12:23:00,0,"The camp I go to has instituted (and I hate to use the word rule)let's call it a strong suggestion, that if you want to keep a fish over the slot you may, BUT you are not allowed to fillet it, you wrap it and freeze it and it is your trophy fish for mounting purposes. Along with that, the camp uses $10 of your payment as entry into the pool of the fish over 30"". You bring in the over 30"" fish you win the pool, but if you decide earlier in the week that you or anyone else in your group want's to keep a 29"", everyone in your group is now eliminated from winning the pot. If someone in my group decides to keep a 29"" and the next day I catch a 30"", that person better start walking home. Last I heard the pot was worth over $3000. Besides, why kill a fish over the slot when having a VERY realistic replica made costs less, lasts longer and looks better. I have plans for a stringer mount of all of the largest walleyes caught from all of my trips...and all of those fish are still swimming and breeding, at least they were when I released them."
573181,Guest,2008-04-28 12:52:00,0,OH PLEASE
573182,Guest,2008-04-28 12:55:00,0,Only way I could top that story is to tell you about the time I caught a Great White in the bay of islands.
573196,Guest,2008-04-28 19:08:00,0,In Canada Once a year I'm taking 4 fish home. One will be over the slot. I eat 16 inchers the whole time I'm there. I let a whole lot of fish go and had fun. (Most were over slot) I spend alot of money in Canada. Life goes on.
573020,Guest,2008-04-21 12:18:00,0,"First time to LS this year. Staying on the west side, second week of June. Does anyone have a link to the regs for this water? Also looking at the map there is a Wenasaga Fish Sancturary - can anyone advise the specifics on this area and is it marked on the water somehow? Thanks for the info."
573035,bpetersen,2008-04-21 21:03:00,251,"jrako, I will be sending you a bunch of information. I will try to take care of that tomorrow. Pet"
573037,Guest,2008-04-21 22:17:00,0,You canot have a live fish in your boat. If you are going to keep it you must kill it. I also believe you cannot have water in your live well if that is where you will keep your fish. We use a club stick about 1 foot long and club them on the head.
573039,Guest,2008-04-21 22:42:00,0,"The Ontario regs have been overhauled, and to make a long story short, Lac Seul is now part of Zone 4. Most of the same regs apply. Note sanctuaries, such as Vaughn Lake remain closed until JUNE 14! NWO Fishing Bum"

573045,Guest,2008-04-22 07:39:00,0,Thanks everyone for the help.
573155,Guest,2008-04-27 18:51:00,0,"What was the consensus for the Lac Seul lodge owners concerning NO FISH over 18""(walleyes) to be taken? I thought I remember a post saying the owners wanted only ""eaters"" to be harvested if at all possible? And as long as we're on the subject do you have to leave the head on the walleyes you take home, in case of a ""MNR check""? Or are fillets with the skin on OK?"
573156,Guest,2008-04-27 19:08:00,0,"You will find that most lodges on Lac Seul stress that they do not want you to take over slot fish. These lodges do fill up year in and year out with waiting lists, so they do have the power to refuse you the next year if they see you taking over slot fish. I am not sure if it has ever happened where someone got kicked out of a resort, but the lodges I have stayed at sounded pretty strict about over slot fish."
573160,Guest,2008-04-27 19:46:00,0,Yes there was a post on this forum that the Lac seul Camps were discussing that they wanted to feel out thier guests about not keeping over slot fish and also using barbless hooks. I emailed my outfitter and told them I intend to comply with the law and the regulations state I am allowed to keep 1 fish over the slot. I told him I intend to keep 1 over the slot and if he should complain to me about it he should complain to the MNR. If a camp owner dont want us to keep overslot fish they should say so in thier brochers and not collect a deposit from you and then tell you after you get to camp. The camps dont make or enforce the fishing laws. The MNR does.
