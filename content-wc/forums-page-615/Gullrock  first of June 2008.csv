572999,Tonyo,2008-04-20 19:39:00,212,"Bud, Am I hearing you right, the spawn going to be a little later this year or is it the shiners? I know it changes by the year and when you guys are ice free. How is the ice situation right now? Tony"
573006,walleye_wal,2008-04-20 20:45:00,12,"Bud, I take it most of the walleye spawning is up in ranger. Looking at the map that makes a lot of sense. How packed with boats does it get up on the north end? Is it better off exploring and looking for smaller post spawning areas with less fishing pressure? How is the river between Keg and Red lakes??? How about the shallow area by gullrock(looking at the map now). So many spots to ponder for weeks. IS IT JUNE YET!!!!!!!! :banghead: Wal"
573013,Guest,2008-04-21 09:56:00,0,"Hello Larry, we did spent some time in FLA., but have been back up here for awhile. Right now We're getting the suites ready for the upcoming season. If the weather stays the same it will be a later ice out, that will keep the eyes up in Ranger a little longer. You guys know the lake good enough you won't have any problem catching fish. And for the northern fisherman it wiil keep them in the shallower bays longer. Tell the guys we said hello, we might see you out on the lake."
573014,Guest,2008-04-21 10:04:00,0,There be up to 100 boats in that area. It sounds like you got a good knowledge of spring walleye fishing you'll catch fish on Gullrock. The weather will dictate the pattern. Good luck!
573016,Guest,2008-04-21 10:12:00,0,"Tony, Come on up. He's got it coming. Right? That'll teach him to dash down to the Islands for a week or to and leave you to run things. Plus I could use someone to tend to the yard work while I'm at softball/baseball games Monday thru Friday.:banghead: John"
573197,walleye_wal,2008-04-28 19:31:00,12,"Hello again. If we have a late spring and ice thaw on the lake. How about lake trout does anyone try to target them in the first couple weeks of June, or is it too late to find them shallow (20ft deep or less). What is the limit? I have one guy in the group that likes to go for them, is it worth the effort for a morning to target them. What do you use to fish for them? The only time I fished them was the end of sept. when they were pre spawning. We threw 1/4oz jigs and twister tails over rocky shorelines. We caught 10:1 ratio northerns to lakers. I think I caught five lakers the whole week. Any help would be appreciated. Does anyone have a weather update??? We had snow in wisconsin today, so there probably a lot of ice on pond up there. Think Spring wal"
573201,Mohleye,2008-04-29 07:27:00,368,"It would probably be too late to find them 20 ft or less, unless it's a really late spring. Actually, I don't know if they're ever 20 ft or less in the spring, but we've caught them that time of year in 20-25' if it was a late spring. Years ago when I fished Gullrock I was told there are lakers caught in the spring, as the season progresses they move up the chain to the deeper water in Red Lake. Would it be worth targeting them? My opinion would be no, but maybe others will think differently. There was a thread on techniques a month or two ago that had some excellent tips, try doing a search."

573844,walleye_wal,2008-05-12 19:24:00,12,"25 days and counting. Went walleye fishing today to get some ""practice"" in. Only 3, but that is not bad for a couple of hours. Biggest only 24 inches, but enough action to make me want to leave now!!! Gullrock here we come!!:driver: wal"
572908,walleye_wal,2008-04-16 08:43:00,12,"John, My group of six are going up to gullrock the 2nd week of June, for the first time. Let us know how you do. Wal"
572913,Guest,2008-04-16 15:06:00,0,"Wal, Will do. This will be our 6th year in a row and haven't had a bad year yet. You can expect to have a good week. We stay at Five Lakes Lodge. What camp are you staying at?"
572969,walleye_wal,2008-04-19 19:31:00,12,"John, My group is going up the second week in June, also at five lakes lodge. We are driving from NE. Wisconsin. Where are you coming from? If you (or anyone else reading this thread) have any suggestions for a first time gullrock fisherman let me know. My group is looking forward to some great fishing. If anyone has any suggestions on fly fishing northern, let me know (please). My goal (along with catching/releasing a boat load of walleye) is to catch a couple northern on the fly. Best of luck to every one on the lake!! Wal"
572975,Tonyo,2008-04-20 06:37:00,212,"Wal, I am a part of the group that goes with John the first week of may. Most of them come out of Waterloo Ia. Myselft and my brother live at The Lake of the Ozarks in MO. I am sure you will have a fantastic time on Gullrock. We have been several years in a row without disappointment. We have fished several areas of the lake, Starrett Straight, The Boot, Fisherman's point, Ranger Bay and on and on. When you get to Five Lakes, Evertt will update you on the past weeks spots and that will give you a starting point for your week. It is a fairly easy body of water to fish. So you shouldn't have any trouble finding and catching a bunch of eye's while on the water. As for the Northern fly fishing, I don't know much about that. If you are looking for slimers you can try the river channel to Ranger lake, Ranger bay, Stone Bay. John may have some ideas too. Hope you have a great trip. I know I am getting ready to go with only 5 weeks until we will enjoy another great week at Gullrock. Tony"
572984,Guest,2008-04-20 08:58:00,0,Tell the owner of FLL that you want to fish Zimmering and Faulkenham portage lakes for Northerns at twice when you are there the lakes are loaded with northerns. This year you will have to fish as close to Ranger bay for the non stop action with the walleyes. But be prepared to play bumper boats.
572985,walleye_wal,2008-04-20 09:46:00,12,"Thanks for the advice. Sadly Ranger bay, and lake will still be closed while we are up there. It opens on the saturday we go home. I will look in to those portage lakes, may be worth a trip. How are the bays on the south end of the lake for pike??? Some of them look promising from the map with a couple feeder creeks. Will the bigger pike still be shallow for the most point??? Thank you again for the responses. Wal"
572990,2746,2008-04-20 18:31:00,3206,"Hi Bud, glad to see you didn't freeze up over the winter.... Or did you spend it in Florida? With the late winter and early opener I'm afraid your advice might be right. I don't like ""bumper boats"" so will be looking elsewhere but am expecting a challenge this year. We might just have to play golf but it'll probably be to cold for that as well! :-)"
572994,Guest,2008-04-20 18:46:00,0,"Wal, Bud is right about Zimmering. You'll catch as many Northern as you can stand, and then some. I have taken a day trip there every year I have gone. First to keep the 10 year old interested, then we decided to keep going just because its a blast, and take a break mid-week. You'll have the lake to yourself, its a beautiful drive back in no man's land,and the chance of spotting a moose or 2 are pretty darn good. There is not a lot of size to what you'll be catching there but you'll catch your fill. I have heard however there are larger fish (over 40"")in there, you just have to fight the smaller ones off. As far as the walleyes on Gullrock, Everett will be able to help you out. If this year is like the others, I doubt this will be your last trip to Gullrock. Plus Five Lakes Lodge is a great place to stay. Shoot me an e-mail and I drop you a line when we get back. Keep'er on the bottom! JohnB.O.A.T."
572995,Guest,2008-04-20 18:55:00,0,"Tony, First week Of May?! Settle down. Easy boy. Like me, I know you are chomping at the bit, but I wasn't planning on you guys driving up here and drinking me out of beer until the END of may. See you the 29th. :cheers: John"
572998,Tonyo,2008-04-20 19:35:00,212,"John, ok, its the first full week of June but who's counting. If you are offering up a free months stay and beer and mama doesn't care than I'll pull the boat and leave my brother home to tend to the bus. while I play a little. Tony"
572060,Guest,2008-03-11 08:26:00,0,"Our group of 11 will be at Gullrock at Five Lakes Lodge between May 31st - June 7th. It will be our 6th trip there. Just wondering if anybody here will be up there either at 5 Lakes or another camp on the lake, at the same time. It would be nice to put a face with a name, and would be a shame not to meet each other. Who knows, we might even be able to trade a few tactical tips. Lord knows we could use 'em. We ain't real smart. But we are smart enough to know we are not very smart. I'm fairly new to WC and am looking forward to maybe meeting some of you. Keep'er on the bottom. JohnB.O.A.T."
572065,2746,2008-03-11 13:16:00,3206,"John, our group of 6 also goes to Fives Lakes Lodge but we are there for opening week (may 17th this year) and again in late August. Been going about 8 years and last year started substituting Lac Seul for our fall trip. I also get up with my wife to Gullrock most years in Late July. (multilpe trips are due to retirement!) I think I noted from an earlier post, picking on the Cyclones, that you might be from Iowa so sorry we won't be able to meet you....we are from the Des Moines area. By the way, we have started playing some golf in Red Lake (May 17th may be a little early) and really enjoy the course. Fish in the morning, golf in the afternoon and fish again in the evening......tough to beat that schedule!:-)"
572183,Guest,2008-03-16 20:42:00,0,"Keep an eye out for my blue/tan alumacraft with a 150 merc on it. I usually fish alone and am on the lake almost every day. weather and the wife permitting. I could also be in my skiff, it is easy to spot as it has gullrock tackle across the sides of it."

It's just a sideline so I can do something with my time on those cold winter nights we have. Oh yes, it does make me a decent write off on my taxes too."

A lot of folks up here have been going to Gull Rock for about 30 yrs. Boy do they have stories to tell!!!! This will be my 4th year. I know several other guys from Waterloo that go up in Sept. Call me sometime. I'd like to hear where you guys fish, and what's been working for you. 987-3068........Steve"
