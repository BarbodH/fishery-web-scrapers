573748,Guest,2008-05-09 16:52:00,0,Any more updates about Little Vermillion/Fireside Lodge concerning ice-out? Thanks for the help !!
573570,Guest,2008-05-06 18:01:00,0,"Hi folks, anybody know if the ice is off Big/Little Lake Vermillion? We're supposed to leave on May 16th for the opener, but with the late spring, we want to know if we should start making other plans. Thanks for the ""heads up"" !!"
573578,Goldeneagle,2008-05-07 05:07:00,78,Are you talking about Little Vermilion near Red Lake?
573629,Guest,2008-05-07 13:21:00,0,The lake near Sioux Lookout.

573633,Guest,2008-05-07 14:13:00,0,The Little V' North of Red; South part of the lake is open. Middle Narrows to the Top is ice'd in. Rivers are flowing in and both are open. Perhaps this weekend we'll have ice out.
573635,Whopper,2008-05-07 14:31:00,340,fish4Pike Thanks for that update! I will be there on the 16th and it's game on!
573657,Goldeneagle,2008-05-08 03:40:00,78,"fish4pike, might you be Terry O.? Did you fly over LV Wednesday?"
573668,Guest,2008-05-08 08:35:00,0,"My name is Eriq, not terry. Brett, the owner of sportsman lodge, let us know yesterday on what the verdict was; I think terry was the one whom gave the report. We are heading up on sunday (*crosses fingers*), hoping for some monster post ice pike. Perhaps a walleye or two on the opener later on in the week."
573708,Goldeneagle,2008-05-08 16:28:00,78,"Eriq, thanks for getting back to me. Was thinking Terry's work might have him flying over LV. My party arrives May 16 (Friday) We'll be in cabin #2. Will probably see you there. Good luck."
