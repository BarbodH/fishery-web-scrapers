573815,v-bay gord,2008-05-11 20:18:00,3168,In the Vermilion Bay section of Eagle Lake the ice should be out in the next couple of days (predictions of high winds and some rain). The east end of the lake generally is a few days behind that......my prediction is for ice out by the 17th.
573822,Sutsgold,2008-05-12 04:51:00,219,"We leave in 10 days so I am optimistic it will be open in a few days. With the ice moving out a little later than normal, how does this effect the spawn? Does it effect the spawn or because the shallow bays will be open and warmer they are spawning now?"
573824,v-bay gord,2008-05-12 06:12:00,3168,"Most of the spawning streams have been open for a while now, however the water temps are pretty cold so spawning may have been delayed a while. The suckers are just now starting to show up in the creeks (they spawn after the walleye) and will likely still be there for opening, which is pretty late. Walleye that spawn on shorelines on the main lake will definately be delayed......like it was 7 (?) years ago during a cold spring. I caught a 30 inch walleye that year during opening week so maybe it isn't a bad situation. Should be great lake trout fishing coming up! Hope the ice is out wherever you are planning on going."
573832,Sutsgold,2008-05-12 08:59:00,219,"Gord, I do not know much about lake trout. We will be on the Eastern Basin of Eagle. Are there lake trout near the walleye rock area? What would be the best technique for a beginner to put one in the boat?"
573835,v-bay gord,2008-05-12 11:36:00,3168,"Lake trout will migrate as far east as that but in probably fewer numbers. I remember one being caught in Mukluk Bay and one off of Partridge Pt......this was many years ago. On the other hand not too many people are trying to catch them. If you had the time and wanted to experiment I would suggest long line trolling something like a Rapala Husky Jerk (blue/silver) or a silver Doctor Spoon. Rocky shorelines, points, narrows etc. Low light conditions and water temps less than 52 degrees are an advantage for finding them shallow. You might pick up the odd walleye or northern doing that as well. Let me know if you have any success."
573843,v-bay gord,2008-05-12 19:10:00,3168,Ice out tonight in the Vermilion Bay section of Eagle Lake. Might be cutting it close on the east end but the camps on that section would be there to advise on conditions.
573847,shakey,2008-05-12 20:42:00,5,"Thanks Gord for the info,i hope all of the lodges get the week in because we are talking alot of money here.Good Fishing."
