573501,Guest,2008-05-05 10:29:00,0,"Jig fishing for walleye is one of the most interesting parts of fishing that I have experienced. Small changes in techniques can make a trip. One big advantage to experimenting with jigs in Canada is that results are immediate. If it is a bad change, you know shortly that it is not what the fish want. I'm use to MN fishing. The action isn't always as fast. Just on the funny side, I think I could do the pop a chew in my mouth in MN to get the timing right on the bite, but in Canada I'm afraid I would end up with so much chew in my mouth I would probably puke. Just a thought.LOL"

573825,AllenW,2008-05-12 06:54:00,11482,"Depends on what time of the year your there, we go late Sept and fish in 30-45 foot of water, even 3/8ths oz jigs don't work well then usually, so we use 1/2 and 5/8th oz round head jigs tipped with a minnow. Most of these I make, so I can use a longer shanked hook, this lets me hook the minnow though the mouth, out the gill and then though the back, puts the hook further back and helps bite off. I agree with the drop till ya hit bottom and then raise your jigs up a few inches, jig in what ever action you prefer and every 15-20 seconds or so drop the jig to check for bottom. You drag them jigs like you do in many lakes south of the border, all your gonna do is spend to much time trying to unsnag your jig. Use whatever weight it takes to be able to control your jig in what ever depth or weather condition your fishing in. imho I'd use no greater than 8# test line also, we bounce back and forth between 6 and 8. Also don't be afraid to try different depths, maybe find a point and zig zag your way from deep to shallow till you start hitting them. Have fun and good luck. Al....who thinks there's a reason they call it fishing and not catching :)"

In order to make sure that you can tell the difference between a 5/16 and a 3/8 do you have to weigh your minnows so the 5/16 total weight with minnow is not to high?
573404,Guest,2008-05-02 12:09:00,0,I use half a night crawler. I now it's fun to give us a hardtime. But you would be surprised the difference. Each year at sometime almost everybody in our group asks for some of my 5/16 jigs.
573407,OlGetcher,2008-05-02 12:47:00,1,"While fishing LacSeul a few years back we were focusing our efforts on a wind blown shoreline throwing BFish-n-Tackle ring worms to shallow sand. The three of us were using the standard lift and drop technique as we retrieved our jigs. Our catch rate was good but for LacSeul standards on a windy shoreline we thought it should have been better. That morning after making another cast to shore before beginning my retrieve I was talking to a buddy in the boat for a minute or two. When I decided to start my retrieve there was a fish already on. Sometimes little things such as what had just happened go unnoticed. But this time I did take notice. All three of us began to make our cast and after our jig had reached the bottom we would begin to slowly crawl our ringworms along the bottom. (Slowly!!) We began to stick fish on almost every cast for the better part of the day using this technique. This technique has worked for me on many Wisconsin lakes as well. I certainly am not saying that a lift and drop does not have its place, it surely does. But every so often a little thing such as what we learned that day on LacSeul can pay big dividends. Just thought I would pass this along and hope it benefits a fellow fisherman. Good luck"

Good luck I have experienced the exact same thing while vertical jigging drop my line down set down my rod to light a cigar pick the rod back up and low and behold a fish! It really varies the jigging speed if they are aggressive more lively jigging my be needed, but if it's a slow bite a slow presentation is needed. One year they were biting so light that I had to almost let the jig swim away before setting the hook -AVS"
573413,back357,2008-05-02 14:11:00,106,"I'm with you guys as well as I have landed a 27"" fish when I threw out a line and let it sit while I popped in a chew. I love using this technique, but the problem I face is that a lot of times when I try it, I end up getting snagged on the rocky bottom of some of the Canadian lakes."

Good luck GREAT POINT....You have explained one of the many variations of walleye jigging. My dad always said the most important thing about catching fish is ""You got to have bait in the water"". I have seen two guys fish side by side and doing the same jigging technique and the one with the white jig catchs fish and the one with the green jig eats bolony & bread for supper. It's fishing, get in the water and enjoy it.....there are few things better. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
573437,Guest,2008-05-03 07:27:00,0,"I have fished with Mike Kansas many times in Canada and I will tell you that he is the best I have ever seen with a jigging rod in his hand. Sorry Mike, I just had top say it. Thanks for all the great trips. Jim"
573439,Guest,2008-05-03 08:45:00,0,"Experiment. If they're not hitting slow, try fast. If they're not hitting big, try small. If they're not hitting white, try black....and so forth. Oddly, when using crawlers, we seem to do better with half a worm. Another trick is to use an oversized twister tail on a smaller jig. We cut off half the body to fit the shaft. This slows down the speed of the drop and keeps the jig in the strike zone and instant longer. Every once in a while, try trolling the jig while jerking your rod foreward then dropping it back. Eventually, you'll get the hang of when to set the hook and how to retrieve the jig. There is a rhythm to it. There is (almost) nothing in the world that feels better than having a big ol' hog walleye inhale your jig. Also, if you are fishing early in the year, keep in mind that big walleye are often lone predators that will lurk in the weeds similar to pike. Tossing a jig into the stick ups, especially during low light hours, will sometimes deliver a trophy-sized surprise. Finally, when the bite is on, nearly all techniques will work but when they are finicky, it's time to finesse 'em. Wash the gas off your hands, use fresh meat and always imagine that a fish is eyeballing your lure at all times."

573330,Guest,2008-05-01 07:53:00,0,"This year will be my first Walleye fishing trip to Canada (Red Lake) and I would love to hear from the experts on their jigging secrets. Thanks, Bill"
573335,back357,2008-05-01 09:40:00,106,"Bill, You're probably going to get all sorts of info on this one as there are many techniques that guys use. I'll give you a few of my own favorites. 1. Whistler Jig with minnow, leech, worm, or gulp - I use either a 1/8 or 1/4 ounce whistler jig and long cast toward points or weed lines and work the bait back to the boat using a crank crank pop settle retrieve. You'll find that the eyes hit on the settle quite a bit. Pike nail it when it hits the water. Usually aiming for 8-12 feet of water. 2. Rattle Gum Ball jig with treble trailer - I use this for crawling along the bottom of flats and usually go with a very slow retrieve with a pop every now and then. I like large worms with this one. 3. Gum ball jig tied drop shot - I like this for vertical jigging over a hot area. Tie the gum ball jig on the end of your line and tip it with a leech. Then, tie a dead hook on about two - three feet up the line and put a gulp minnow grub on it. This is good for getting those fish that are suspended above the bottom. Hope this helps."
573339,Mike Kansas,2008-05-01 10:19:00,1463,"No expert here but I will be happy to tell you what works for me. First of all the time of year that you go to Canada is important. The Walleye start their year with the spawn and it takes place in shallow water and as the summer progress's they move out to main lake structure. They can be caught at any time but are more accesible early in the year because it is easier to find shallow structure than the deeper structure that will hold them in mid to late summer. During the early season I like to fish area's that have wind blowing into them and have some drops or bottom elevation changes. The wind moves the plancten in to the area and the baitfish will follow and the Walleye won't be far behind. Later in the summer as the Walleye move towards the main lake we try to locate humps or sunken islands or large flats that have sharp drops on them. Fishing the edges of the drops and the contour of the humps or islands can be very effective. I believe that there are several important things that one needs to do while jigging. First of all don't be in an hurry. Fish slow and cover as much of the structure as you can. It is important that you keep your jig near or at the bottom. Try to keep your line as vertical as you can and ""feel"" the bottom. Once you reach the bottom lift your jig up and back to the bottom with some frequency. During this process I believe it is important to keep the line tight. A lot of your bites will come on the jigs fall and all you may feel is a tick or a thump and a tight line will give you better feel. Sometimes when you are lifting the jig you will feel pressure or what I call a heavy rod tip, if you feel this set the hook. A Walleye will simply grab the jig and HANG on which causes that heavy rod tip. I will always set the hook when I feel anything different that I think is not the bottom. Summary: Fish Slow Bounce the bottom Tight Line Set hook when it feels different The wind is your friend Cover the structure and contours Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
573341,back357,2008-05-01 10:27:00,106,"Mike brings up a very good point. My post about my techniques are for mid June. The fish are post spawn and moving out of the very shallow water. It really depends on when you're going and also if you are planning to fish early morning and late evening. I fish primarily from morning to late afternoon. The fish are going to be more shallow in the early morning and evening. Also, yes, the wind is your friend. Look for places where the wind is blowing in. It blows all the food up there for the bait fish. Sometimes you can see bait fish ""running"" on the surface as they are chased by bigger fish."
573388,Guest,2008-05-02 08:17:00,0,Many people here will say 1/8 to ¼ oz jigs. The most important thing regarding the jigging process is to make sure you ARE ON THE BOTTOM don't let pride get in the way and feel like you have to go w/ a lighter jig Use 3/8 and take the worry out of it! Mike in Kansas nails it Summary: Fish Slow Bounce the bottom Tight Line Set hook when it feels different The wind is your friend Cover the structure and contours Follow those tips and you'll be fine -AVS

She never believes anything I say. I didn't address jig size in my post and I should have. In shallower water (10' or less) I like to use 1/4 oz with a 3/0 hook. Sometimes wind and boat movement require going to a 3/8. The lighter jig makes it easier to feel bites however I think it is more important to have enough weight to be vertical and maintain a tight line during the jigging process and BE IN TOUCH with the bottom. I would say that the majority of my jigging is done with a 3/8 oz jig. Probably because in the spring we might start in 15' water and move up the structure to shallow water which to me makes the versatility of the 3/8 oz more practical for BEING IN TOUCH. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"

573395,Guest,2008-05-02 09:15:00,0,There is a small baitshop here in Huntsville Alabama that has 5/16 ounce jigs.(the only place I have ever seen with that size)I seem to end up using them fairly often. 1/4 doesn't get to the bottom and 3/8 is too heavy.
573397,Mike Kansas,2008-05-02 09:41:00,1463,"AVS, Hope you have a great week at Evergreen and catch a bunch of Eyes. Awesome fishing camp and great owners. Do me a favor and say Hi to Patty and Gary for me. Stayed their a few years ago and my wife caught a 31 1/2"" Walleye in a small bay by the refuge. Caught it trolling a ShadSki Crankbait.
