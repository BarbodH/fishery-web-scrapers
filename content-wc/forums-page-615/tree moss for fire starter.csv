The stuff looks a little like spanish moss on a much smaller scale. Anyhow - I wondering what it is called. Is it a moss or lichen or what? anyone know what I am talking about?? thanks, lobo1"

573797,sanmatt,2008-05-11 12:25:00,11,An easy fire starter that's easy to carry and safer than gas is to dip cotton balls in Vaseline pertoleum jelly. You can put about a half a dozen in a plastic medicine bottle and keep in your tackle box. They work great.
