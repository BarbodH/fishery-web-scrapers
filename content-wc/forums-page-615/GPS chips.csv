573536,Guest,2008-05-05 21:09:00,0,"I have used the Navionics Canada chip (2006 version) for Lac Seul and Lake of the Woods and have found them to be very helpful and quite accurate. I believe the newer versions are even better, more lakes and better detail. I wouldn't go out on these two bodies of water without it."

573547,Guest,2008-05-06 10:59:00,0,Garmin/Mapsources's TOPO chip for Ontario is accurate. My experience is limited to one week at a fly-in outpost last Sept.
