573759,walleyeduran,2008-05-10 08:38:00,286,Welcome to what WI has been going through for years. I remember back in the 80's MN people laffing at the spearing rights.
573764,Flip Silverlake,2008-05-10 12:54:00,645,Yup fishing only for their needs. Right!! Looks like it was before the spawn its really a crime. Oh well our left wing give them everything goverment keeps this going. Sportsman have to worry about slot limits and seasons. These guys just go out and clean the lake out. This is getting really OLD!
