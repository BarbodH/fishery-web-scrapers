We are going to fish the opening week on LOTW and the second week on Lac Seul and finish up on Red Lake including a four day fly out. This is the first time I have ever gone to Canada for that length of time. I will have three of the guys I grew up with along. Two of them retired last year and two of us retired this year and this is our retirement gift from our wives. Crown Royal, Loomis, Jigs, Crown Royal, Shimano, Stren, Crown Royal, landing net, life jacket, Crown Royal.....just packing up the last few items!!!!"

You know you have a great marriage when she doesn't care what you do, as long as she doesn't have to go along. My wife lets me spend 4 months in Canada each summer. What a gal! Congratulations on your retirement....your great taste in women....and your trip to Northwest Ontario."
