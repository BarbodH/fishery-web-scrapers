573747,deputy dog,2008-05-09 16:00:00,305,"as a person in law enforcement, i asked the border patrol agent one time what it would take for me to be able to carry in canada and he said ""short of a letter from the queen, it's not gonna happen"". i just leave mine at home, as much as that irks me! i would imagine that the penalties would be pretty stiff if you are caught carrying in the north."
573613,jigman 2003,2008-05-07 10:04:00,981,You are correct sir
573619,Goldeneagle,2008-05-07 10:49:00,78,"States of Illinois, Wisconsin & Minnesota have pretty stiff carry laws. I know people who bury their gun along the road in Northern Minnesota. Works better if they return during daylight hours. Bad guys love gun free zones."

573644,rpieske,2008-05-07 18:56:00,1276,I have a friend who is a year round 5th wheeler. He always drops his pistol off at the I. Falls Police Station. They check it in and return it when comes back through. He has been doing this for many years. No problem.

573652,Hawker,2008-05-07 20:45:00,3967,"I.Falls P.D. just may be the way to go then. I'll get the number for them tomorrow and call to see. Thanks for the suggestion(s), I do appreciate them, even the Miss Kitty one (haha)! Regards!"
573663,Guest,2008-05-08 08:01:00,0,This is an interesting topic. No so much about where to stash the heater but the idea that one is needed at all. I have been to Canada many times and carry enough cash to get there and back and never felt the need to carry a roscoe. Maybe it's the other 5 guys that I have along is enough deterent. Northern Minnesota just doesn't strike me as a dangerous place. Anyway Good Luck and keep your powder dry.

I do my utmost to stay within the boundaries of the laws wherever I go, and bringing or attempting to bring a handgun across into Canada is against ""Their"" law, ergo my attempts to find a solution for the entire trip, not just a part or portion of it!!"
573715,Goldeneagle,2008-05-08 18:39:00,78,"Yep, if a bad guy confronts me I will be able to even the odds. Don't want people to say I didn't have a chance. Won't volunteer to be a victim."
573559,Hawker,2008-05-06 13:46:00,3967,"For those that would condemn and demean those of us who choose to pack & carry, this question isn't for you. I know I am surely not the only one who normally travels with a handgun for personal protection. Yes, I have a conceal carry permit and I always travel packing except when I make my annual trips to Canada. I've wondered if there is anyplace, at International Falls for example, that a traveler can ""check"" and store a handgun and munitions before crossing the border and pick it back up after crossing back into the states?? I don't use credit cards so I sometimes carry larger than normal amounts of cash on trips plus a sizable amount of tackle & fishing gear as well. I just feel very uncomfortable each year as I make the trip until I have crossed the border and arrived safely, and have often wondered if there is or are places or facilities at or near border crossings that address this?"
573561,jigman 2003,2008-05-06 13:51:00,981,"I've never heard of such a place, but given the number of states that have concealed carry it sounds like a good business opportunity."
573564,Guest,2008-05-06 14:06:00,0,Maybe miss Kitty will keep it for you behind the bar at the the Long Branch
573573,Jimmy Jig,2008-05-06 19:48:00,1905,Check it at the Canadian border???
573584,Hawker,2008-05-07 07:03:00,3967,"Thats funny, I don't care who ya are!! Mind giving me directions to the Long Branch??"
573586,Hawker,2008-05-07 07:05:00,3967,I've got a good OK State Trooper buddy of mine that thought he'd do that a few years back. He still has not gotten his 9mm back!! Any more suggestions?

573592,Guest,2008-05-07 07:42:00,0,Why can't you take it into Canada if you declare it?
573593,Guest,2008-05-07 07:52:00,0,I am pretty sure no handguns allowed at all.
