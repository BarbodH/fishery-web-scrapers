If by chance Sturgeon has ice still I'm sure most of the surronding lakes will be clear. I sure you can get a solid report from one of the resorts on sturgeon or, give Vern's in Ignace a call he may be able to help. No fear the ice will be gone. good luck GF"

Looks like the ice on the main lake won't go out until later in the week. Trout s/b up on top."
