508409,jimbo,2000-06-11 19:14:00,223,I just returned from a week of fishing Lac Suel. I just wanted to say that if any one is looking for a nice place to stay-try Deer Path Lodge at Hudson. It is not fancy just good honest people running a small operation (7 cabins plus camping) some with outside toilets and some with inside. The owner (Rick) told us where to fish Lake Trout on another lake and we did well. He also set us up with places for walleyes. We also met nice fishermen and women at the camp who were helpful.Just thought some of you may want to hear some positive notes for a change.Jimbo
