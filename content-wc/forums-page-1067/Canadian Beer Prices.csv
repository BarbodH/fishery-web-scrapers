508412,Guest,2000-06-12 08:36:00,0,How much is a case of LaBatt's or Molson from the Canadian State stores(Not the Duty-Free rate)? I'll be in Northern Ontario soon and just want to figure how much cash to bring.
508413,Guest,2000-06-12 12:14:00,0,Around $31-$32 Canadian a case for bottles and slightly higher for cans. 22 bottles in a case. Good fishing: Frank
508414,Guest,2000-06-12 12:22:00,0,Thanks for your reply. Good Fishing is kinda redundant isn't it? I've never known time spent fishing to be bad.
508415,Guest,2000-06-12 20:26:00,0,Can you bring Canadian beer back across the border?
508416,Jim,2000-06-14 13:37:00,238,Couple years ago I was asked by the US border guard about beer. There were two of us and I thought I was OK with about a case of Canadian beer. I was told we could bring back 1 liter of alcohol which amounts to about 2 cans of beer. I had to pay $5.00 plus duty before I could bring the beer into the states.
