We are planning on driving straight through but sometimes the eyelids disagree.Thanks!"
508422,Guest,2000-06-13 04:29:00,0,"Fred, 502 is shorter. Instead of taking a right at the end into Dryden, we take a left and head down a few miles before turning right on a dirt road that hits 17 in Oxdrift, it shaves off about 10 miles. Check a map as I don't have the name of the road.All of that said, the Nestor Falls route is very scenic and has areas for a pull off. If it's the middle of the night, I guess it doesn't matter. After the first 25 miles on 502, pull offs are non-existent for the next 50 miles. Watch for Moose"
