What's the best way to find and catch walleye at this time of year? we are taking minnows and worms and jigging stuff. what else should I take ?? any help would be GREATLY appreciated. We will also be pike fishing. I've done that many times before but usually earlier in the season, any hints on this as well? thanks for any help!!!!"

I always start deeper 25 ft and work shallower until I get bites. Depending on the lake depth determines where the fish are.Jigging is a great method tipped with a minnow or leach. Colors include white, charteuce, orange, black or even pink. I usally will drift while I jig. Take a marker buoy with you when you catch fish throw it out.Another great method is spinners with a bottom bouncer. I like to back troll because you can go slower in reverse.What I like to do is if a catch a fish with spinners, I will then try jigging them."
