There are also several other suggestions there that might help ya out.Good Luck...You can EMAIL me at [email protected] if ya have any questions..."
508225,Dave,2000-06-12 08:40:00,258,"I've been traveling to NW Ontario for the last six years four of which were at Big North Lodge. My father, two brothers and I have had an excelent time. Big North is on the Winnipeg River between Kenora and Minaki. The fishing has been great every year with quality walleye, small mouth, pike, and muskie! There web site is www.bignorthlodge.com.Good luck!Dave"
508226,kingsway,2000-06-12 08:58:00,27,"Anyone wanting a great fishing experience at a very reasonable cost. Try ""The Idyllwild Resort"" on Kashabowie Lake, Ontario. Located just 65 mi W/NW of Thunder Bay, Ontario (off Hy.11). The lake is 14 mi. long has many islands, bay, and channels. The fishing there is great for Walleye, Lake Trout, Small mouth Bass, and Northern Pike. Rates for a (fully modern) 3-bedroom cabin for up to 6 persons are $450.00 per week Canadian dollars (which translates to about $320.00 American dollars total). Not per person as many places charge and then they charge American Dollars beside. For a rustic, 1 bedroom cabin that sleeps 4, the weekly rate is only $250.00 (about $180.00 American Dollars). You can bring your own boat or rent theirs. Call and talk to Sue at 1-807-926-2413 or e-mail Sue at [email protected] . I have done fly-in fishing, fished Red Lake, Ear Falls, Parroult falls, Vermillion Bay, and I would say that this place provides more bang for the American Dollar than any of the others I have tried so far. I do not have any financial interest in this lodge or any other benefit from telling about this place. I just wanted to share an excellent Canadian fishing trip that the average American can afford, with fellow fishermen Hope you enjoy your stay as well as me and my wife will June 17-23.Rich"
508227,Fred_G,2000-06-12 09:44:00,908,"I would highly recommend The Old Post & Village on Lake St. Joseph. John & Wendy Grace are excellent hosts. There is a definite woman's touch to all accomadations and the fishing is excellent for Walleye and Pike. John's brother Phillip is one of the guides, and knows the lake better than almost anyone. Check out their website at www.oldpost.com. LOL Fred"
508228,Guest,2000-06-12 13:38:00,0,"Ron, I too have been fishing the Winnipeg River like Dave and have stayed at Big North lodge and Birch Island Resort, both near Minaki. If you want an American plan with meals prepared, Birch Island is definitely a cut above Big North, but it does cost more. We had a good trip out of Big North lodge, but with my and my buddy's wives now occasionally going, Birch Island Resort is our only choice on the Winnipeg River. A group of 16 including some wives will be going in 12 days to Birch Island. Another lodge that I have patronized for years and has an outstanding facility is Chaudiere Lodge on the French River. It is north of Toronto 4 1/2 hours and has gourmet type food for around $750 US per week. The fishing is not as good as the Winnipeg River, but my wife did enjoy the lodge immensely. Good luck in your choice, Don Correll MD"
