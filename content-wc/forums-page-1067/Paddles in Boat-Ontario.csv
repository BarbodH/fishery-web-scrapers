If I am legal in Wisconsin, am I legal in Ontario as far as boat regulations go. In other words, do I need paddles in my boat, a towing rope, flares, etc. If anyone has the Ontarion regs I would appreciate your help. Thanks."
508204,Karl,2000-06-08 15:45:00,63,"According to the reply to topic ""Ont. Req. for Buoyant heave line"" on the next page in this message board, if the boat is legal in your state, it's legal in Ontario."
508205,Guest,2000-06-08 17:00:00,0,"Ontario also requires that you have a waterproof flashlight,anchor with rope,a cushion with rope attached and the same things you need for Wisconsin.I was stopped on the water last year by the O.P.P and they told me about these new laws and that they were going to start enforcing the laws starting last Labor Day.Canada is a great place to go and excellant fishing.Abide by the laws and enjoy yourself. GOOD LUCK FISHING!!!!!"

508207,acp,2000-06-09 04:12:00,156,"The following is taken directly from the Canadian Coast Guard Web site: If you are operating a boat that is licensed, registered, or titled in a country outside Canada, you must comply with safety equipment requirements of the country in which the boat is registered or licenced. Foreign visitors operating a Canadian licensed or registered vessel must comply with Canadian regulations.You can find all this information on the Canadian Coast Guard Web site:#####://www.ccg-gcc.gc.ca/obs-bsn/sbg-gsn/legal_e.htmNot to say that some of the safety equipment required for Canadian registered boats is not a good idea. All you are legally required to have is what's required where your boat is registered in the US.Later....Al"
508208,Guest,2000-06-09 06:25:00,0,"The safety rules are a really good idea and are the minimum set out by our government. In NW Ontario I have towed on numerous occasions boaters back to the landing in lakes that are infrequently fished because of running out of fuel and broken down equipment. Safety is a common sense issue and if you are entering into an area you are not familiar with, bring a good map and leave a departure and travel schedule with someone. Another good idea is to bring a spare or kicker motor if you can fit it in if you are going as one boat.It is amazing the number of people who realize they can't listen to their radio in NW Ontario.

508210,Guest,2000-06-11 16:32:00,0,It is a figure of speach meaning it is a wilderness area and if you are not prepared you could be in a world of hurt. Good fishing: Frank
