508418,Dan,2000-06-12 10:04:00,325,Does anyone know the regulations or where to find the regs. regarding transporting minnows and/or leachs into Canada for fishing. I know the regs. on crawlers but not other baits. Thanks!
508419,Jesse-WI,2000-06-12 10:09:00,534,It is illegal to transport live leeches or minnows into Canada.
