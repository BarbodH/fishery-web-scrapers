508446,Iowa Eye,2000-06-13 12:12:00,104,Just got back from Labell's on the NW Arm of Rainy Lake. Nice Clean and cheap. They have nice rental boats with 30 hp Lunds pedistal seats also a pool table and a place to watch TV in the lodge if kids get board. It is about 45 minutes from Ft. Francis. #####://www.duenorth.net/labelles/
