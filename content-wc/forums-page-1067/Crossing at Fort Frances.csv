You will want to get to ""The Fort"" before 10am if you plan to cross on Fri or Sat. The last two weekends have had mile long lines by that point both days. If you can't get accross before noon, plan on being in a 2-4 mile line. There have been little to no lines at any time Sun - Thurs. I would guess this will hald true for the summer.RB"

Same thing for going back across on Saturday. Last trip up (June) we waited two hours to cross back to Int'l Falls. What really bugs me is the wait going back isn't for customs, it's that .25Â¢ toll booth that only has one lane that jams everybody up. If I figured right, this year we'll be crossing t 4:00 a.m. we've never crossed that early. Be interesting to see how many people are travlling across the border at that time."
508231,Guest,2000-06-12 18:44:00,0,We have been to ontario over 30 times. We usually come across anywhere from 2-4 am there is never a line and we have never been checked at that time of the morning either.Thats the only time to cross as far as I'm concerned.
