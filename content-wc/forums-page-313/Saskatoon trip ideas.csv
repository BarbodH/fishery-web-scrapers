3021234,Zola,2014-07-22 16:49:00,14,I have a business trip that may take me to Saskatoon. I would like to take in a 3 or 4 day guided American plan fishing trip/lodge with my wife while I am in Canada. Great experience and great fishing at a reasonable price. Looking for ideas????
3027033,38bill,2014-07-24 11:38:00,331,"Saskatoon isn't really where you go when you think of Canadian fishing. Its flat prairie land. Pretty country though, you can see a thunderstorm coming miles and miles away. The province of Saskatchewan has plenty of world class fishing but I think most of it would be way north of Saskatoon. Google Saskatchewan fishing and you should be able to get some idea of what's offered."
3031945,deadhead1,2014-07-26 06:42:00,193,You can't go wrong with Tobin Lake near Nipawin. Some of the biggest walleye and pike you will find at a drive to lake. I'm not sure what there is for American plan outfitters but try the Nipawin web site. You can either stay in town and fish the river or stay at Tobin Lake town site and fish the lake. It is close enough that even if you stay in town you can still easily spend one day on the lake by boat. I know there are lots of fishing guides available for hire in the area and if you call around I'm sure someone will be able to accomidate your needs. I would talk to Twin Marine 306-862-2628 or Vanity Ventures at 306-862-3959

Big walleye lurk the waters there...While there are good guides available and a good place to fish but not a place I would take the wife for a resort type vacation.
