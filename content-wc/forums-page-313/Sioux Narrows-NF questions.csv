Will be crossing the border around 10 or 11 am on a Monday. From Ft. Frances to Kenora area Questions: 1. Beer. Best to grab some beer in Ft. Frances or are there places in SN/NF area? History tells me they don't have the greatest hours. 2. Lunch. Thinking of stopping in Sioux Narrows for lunch before we make the last short leg of the trip. Aren't planning on getting to the lodge until after 2pm but we are traveling a little early to stop and see some things with my son. Good places in either SN or NF? Preferably in SN since it is closer to our ultimate destination 3. Bait. Would like to grab some fairly large minnows to take with us. I see a bait shop in NF. Wasn't sure if there was one in SN or not? Didn't see one on their community website but I have to imagine there is. Thanks!"

Personally I would get beer in Fort Francis at the BEER Store, it's easy to get to and will have a better selection of everything.2) Not sure about lunch, I never eat in either place3) There is a bait shop right next to Delsags, I would give them a call and tell them what you want to pick up on your way through."
3038257,LOW1,2014-07-28 12:07:00,2828,At the time that you are crossing there should be little delay at the border. It's 90 minutes to SN. There's an LCBO in Sioux Narrows near the south side of the bridge on the east side. If you are going north and cross the bridge you have gone too far. Dalseg's grocery store in NF is also a LCBO outlet-it may be open longer hours. If you are going up on August 4 it's the famous Civic Holiday in Ontario which marks nothing of any importance other than Canadians decided to take that day off. LCBO may be closed. Dalseg's should be open. Big John's in SN would be a good lunch spot. Order the club sandwich and a piece of blueberry pie with ice cream. Big John's is so close to the south side of the bridge that you could spit on it from there. Good bait shops in NF and in SN. The Trading Post grocery store in SN has a decent selection also and has somewhat longer hours.

Bought all of them at Nestor Falls Bait and Tackle. Dalsegs has beer and not sure when they open but, they close at 6:30. Moniques Log Cabin has great food. Right across from Dalsegs."
