3028433,Hawkfan,2014-07-24 20:45:00,237,Wow. Quite the list. Looks like a lot of good memories.
3033121,515,2014-07-26 17:13:00,254,"I think that's the toughest question I've ever been asked as all of them were great for one reason or another. I'm going to say best trip as it was the start of it all was the first one. As for best lake, Muskrat Lake had to be my favorite as it had a ton of water fish and we seemed to catch them just about everywhere we tried and it also both size and numbers to keep us entertained. I will definity fish this one again someday. Now that being said I've enjoyed every trip and every lake I've fished for one reason or another. I've only ever crossed paths with 2 outfitters I didn't like and they are both out of business now so maybe that just wasn't me not liking them and one bad experience with a pilot in all that time."
