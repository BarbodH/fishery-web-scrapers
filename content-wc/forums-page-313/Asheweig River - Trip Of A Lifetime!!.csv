3036073,yoopertrout,2014-07-27 18:35:00,1172,"p.s. Is there a way to learn more about the camp? I went to the website, and it doesn't work."
3036081,Mike Borger,2014-07-27 18:40:00,1554,"The camp was closed solely because of mismanagement, it just fell to the wayside. I have an enormous amount of respect for the natives of that region, but they're not really business savvy. I do believe they could be though, they certainly have it in them. Perhaps not business savvy is a bad choice of words - it's more they have different priorities.As far as knowing it's never been netted out, it's remote even for them. Getting there from Kasabonika is a major ordeal and very few do it. Many of the youths in town who I spoke with have never even seen a brook trout and didn't even know they existed in the river.They net walleye and whitefish out of Shibogama Lake, but strictly for sustenance.No, it's impossible to know for sure that the river has never been been netted, it's simply a very educated guess on my part.Interesting that you mention the Fawn. I paddled that river as well and it was crazy good for brook trout, very much like the Asheweig.What's got me excited is, I had a long meeting with the general manager of community development for Kasabonika and made some recommendations which I believe they will implement starting next year. Main one being there's another small cabin on the Asheweig way downstream from Howling Falls and just above Sourdough rapids. This is the heart of the very best trout water on the entire river and its never really been touched. The river is much more intimate down there with one mild rapid after another and no where near any large warm lake widenings. If they have a freighter cached on the other side of the trail I suggested they clean this cabin up and offer it as a side trip to their guests as it's navigable all the way down (although a long trip!) This I know would be mind blowing and as I said I believe it will be done."
3036089,Mike Borger,2014-07-27 18:42:00,1554,"Read my report. Right at the very end is the contact info you need (name, telephone, email) in bolded text.The website needs to be updated as none of the contact info on it is functioning. I was told it would be."
3038129,yoopertrout,2014-07-28 11:44:00,1172,Sounds pretty cool. I hope it happens.
3040641,Mike Borger,2014-07-29 05:13:00,1554,"Well, I spoke with Mitch Diabo yesterday and he said they're going to open up that water downstream.I'm going back for sure!"
3040665,Whopper,2014-07-29 05:21:00,340,"Well done Solo, you and Mr Bill put together another epic trip. Thanks for taking the time to share"
3041313,Larry S,2014-07-29 08:17:00,665,"Great Report Mike. As I mentioned to you, in 2003 Mr Jack Rezny from Moccasin Trails who represented the native tribes booking trips to their outpost camps was heavily suggesting that myself and two other guys I was fishing with at the time go to Asheweig for a weeks fishing trip. I wanted to go,but these friends were not interested because they couldn't bring their very ample( 3 to 4 cases of beer each)supply of beer on the trip! We went to another great lake( Dearden) that the native tribes had once had that was now managed by an outfit out of Armstrong and had a wonderful trip. In the years after this I always have wondered how the fishing was at Asheweig and now due to your report I Know!! Later Larry S"
3041513,vteye,2014-07-29 09:14:00,812,Another great report - thanks for sharing
3034033,Mike Borger,2014-07-27 05:49:00,1554,"Sweet, you'd be perfect!Your dual role is beer guardian and coffee brewmaster. They go hand in hand and I already know your coffee rocks."
3035193,yoopertrout,2014-07-27 14:00:00,1172,"Thanks for posting this. I was invited on a trip to the Ashweig a number of years ago. I couldn't make it, which turned out to be a good thing. The group that went got one brook trout, and listened to the guides talk about how many they had eaten. Not sure if it was this camp (If so, it could explain why it closed), or a different part of the river. As the camps in Labrador and Manitoba know, brook trout are super easy to over-exploit, even far in the wilderness. Glad to see the river is doing well. I hope it stays good."
3035441,Mike Borger,2014-07-27 15:01:00,1554,"This river has never been overfished, and yes it had to be the same camp.The trout have always been there bud. If only one was caught then there's only one explanation."
3035457,forgop,2014-07-27 15:14:00,880,Looks like a fun fish. I don't hear much about them eating wise though. How are they?
3035489,Mike Borger,2014-07-27 15:22:00,1554,I couldn't bring myself to kill any trout. The walleye were pretty yummy though.
3035521,Jerryv,2014-07-27 15:27:00,1222,"Great pictures and the first part of the story. I wish I could read the rest, but when it turned to black text on a brown background, I couldn't see it. Maybe it is just my computer. Anyone else have this problem?Jerry"
3035657,Mike Borger,2014-07-27 16:16:00,1554,"That should absolutely not be happening Jerry, very weird!! I have dark lettering on a taupe colored background. Thanks for the heads up though."
3035729,yoopertrout,2014-07-27 16:50:00,1172,"Of course they've always been there - they evolved there. There are lots of explanations for their relative abundance in any given year,or ability to be caught though. As I noted, the brook trout camps in many places have learned how easy it is to over-exploit them though (through subsistence use or sport use) Seemingly endless supplies of big brookies have been hammered down since the European tourists did it to the L. Superior coasters in the mid-nineteenth century. For some reason, Ontario camps have been slower to realize the need for C&R than those in other places. I understand that the bad experience of one group of fisherman (really good trout fishermen by the way) could have been explained by something as simple as insect or baitfish activity. My friends weren't put so off by the poor fishing (they know bad weeks happen.) They were put off by the guides telling them of how many fish they eat. And then, for reasons I don't know, the camp stopped operating."
3035833,Mike Borger,2014-07-27 17:13:00,1554,"I've spent pretty much my entire adult life travelling all over the north in pursuit of brook trout and know first hand what you're talking about as far over exploiting them goes.FWIW I paddled the entire length of the Asheweig solo a number of years back and had such phenomenal trout fishing that was the primary reason I inquired about this camp - I wanted to go back.The population of trout has never diminished on the Asheweig, that I can guarantee you.Don't want to offend anyone by saying something stupid so I'll just stop right here."
3036017,yoopertrout,2014-07-27 18:14:00,1172,"I'm not trying to offend you either. I've looked for trophy brookie fishing that is nearer and more affordable than the Sutton. I (and three other groups) went to a camp that said they had it. I even went twice. No one did well. The camp's website has the same old pictures of big dead brookies from the first years they opened, many of which are being held by members of the owner's family. I won't name the camp, as I'm not out to wreck their business, and can't prove they over fished it. I've also heard (as, apparently have you), tales of wilderness brookie fisheries getting beat up. A few years ago, it was rumored that the Fawn was netted (I don't know if it's true, but it came from a pretty credible source.) I'm glad to know that the Asheweig is okay. I just don't get how you can know that it didn't get beaten down for a while unless you've been there every few years. The guys I know are credible, and they say the guides bragged of lots of fish getting eaten. Do you know why the camp closed?"
3032417,castnblast,2014-07-26 10:17:00,111,Awesome BT's!
3032721,Mike Borger,2014-07-26 13:24:00,1554,Glad you enjoyed it guys!
3032857,pitbull,2014-07-26 14:53:00,45,"Mike, thanks for sharing such a incredible Fishing Experience, I felt like I was with you!!Pittbull"
3033049,kzoofisher,2014-07-26 16:39:00,5144,Every great camp story needs the guy who can't do anything right but still manages to have a good time. I can soooo be that guy for you.
3033129,515,2014-07-26 17:15:00,254,Another adventure of a lifetime in the books for you. Thanks for posting it.
3033377,Mike Borger,2014-07-26 18:54:00,1554,"Sounds good, let's talk. Speaking of good camp stories here's one for you guys.First some background. Back in my paddling days I spent a lot of time in the same region as the Asheweig travelling solo. Almost 25 years ago while travelling past the native community of Fort Hope on the Albany River I ran into several natives in a boat and we stopped to talk. They told me a pretty wild tale about a bigfoot (they had a different name for it) who lived nearby. I inwardly rolled my eyes but the story stuck with me and I filed it away. 3 years ago fishing the Dusey River in this same area the outfitter jokingly told me that local natives will not travel downstream on the Dusey past Dusey Lake because a large hairy man-like creature (bigfoot) lives there. Again I joked about it and filed the story away. Last week on the Asheweig while chatting with our guide Leon one night he tentatively starts to tell us some stories. Tentative at first as he was gauging what our reaction would be. The man had no agenda, he embellished nothing. He simply told his stories in the same quiet matter of fact way most natives have. Story after story of these creatures who live in the region. He once saw one standing on the shore of a lake and thought it was a bear on its hind legs at first, but the color was wrong and it was too tall. ""Did you take a shot Leon?"" I asked. He looked at me like I was crazy and said no. ""The elders tell us to leave them alone so we do. I turned the boat around and left"". Other stories like the time he was calling moose in the fall drawing this particularly large bull in. Suddenly he heard a bizarre shriek...definitely not moose or anything else expected. He froze when he heard splashing in the swamp like a person walking through shallow water. Finally he glimpsed the creature from about 100 yards away as it stopped to stare at him in his blind. He packed up quickly and left not disturbing it. Many other stories like the girl in the control tower at Kas who saw something that scared her to death. The next morning upon searching they found large tracks everywhere. The tracks are apparently quite commonly seen, although never in the winter. Leon seems to think they hibernate like a bear. When I asked have you ever taken a picture of the tracks he just shrugged. ""Don't own a camera, and I don't need a picture, I know what they look like"" There were more stories, many more, and after hearing them, and especially considering what I'd heard in the past, it's VERY hard not to believe."
3033617,poultryman,2014-07-26 20:36:00,183,Im getting sick and tired of reading these trip reports that I havent gone along on... Man. Thats just sweet stuff.
3033841,Hawkfan,2014-07-26 21:50:00,237,"Wow. Just wow. And if you are telling a tale there, you are VERY good at it."
3033881,forgop,2014-07-26 23:02:00,880,"I don't know Mike, I'm much too sloppy of a drunk and spend all my time passed out in the rack in between keg stands to spend any time fishing or cooking to leave any for you guys. That said, I'd be game for a walleyecentral gruop sometime. If you plan it, they will come Mike."
3034025,Mike Borger,2014-07-27 05:46:00,1554,"Just the facts, you guys can decide on your own what you think."
3031313,Mike Borger,2014-07-25 20:35:00,1554,"My photographer buddy Bill Marzana and I recently spent a week at the Asheweig River in far northern Ontario. The Asheweig is a massive coldwater tributary of the Winisk and is loaded with trophy brook trout as well as walleye and pike.The camp is owned by the Oji-Cree of Kasabonika Lake First Nations. They built it in 2002, ran a handful of groups through it and it's been sitting vacant since 2006.Words cannot describe how awesome it was! I've written a detailed trip report with photos and video clips, if you're interested have a look!Cheers, Mikehttp://www.canadafishingguide.net/br...sheweig-river/"
3031345,unclepaully,2014-07-25 20:49:00,112,"Every time I read a Mike Borger trip report, I think to myself, ""it can't get any better than this"" and yet somehow it does. Thanks for the nice report Mike."
3031409,Pikeslayer8,2014-07-25 21:14:00,1460,"Ah yes, the much anticipated Asheweig River write-up is in. Great report, it was like I was almost there with you guys. I absolutely love Ontario for the endless opportunities for backwoods adventure and fellas, you found the backwoods and most certainly, the adventure. Off the charts! Could of had more details on some of your culinary delights or lack thereof. If ya ever need a camp cook...."
3031417,Rich B,2014-07-25 21:16:00,1081,World class fishing followed with another excellent report and photography.Thanks for sharing a special week up north that many of us can only experience (sort of - ha) via your photos and comments.Rich B
3032065,Mike Borger,2014-07-26 07:49:00,1554,"Thanks fellas, glad you enjoyed the story!Thanks Bill, and having you along would be an upgrade for sure.I only get fancy cooking when I'm with my family. When it's me and the guys it's not worth talking about LOL!You might be onto something here though.I'm thinking of maybe assembling a crack team of walleye central members. Kind of like the A-Team except we'd go fishing instead.You'd be the chef, forgop would be the official brewmaster and guardian of the beer.I need to think a bit on the others."
3032081,eyemike,2014-07-26 08:01:00,233,Just love reading your trip reports Mike!
3032113,retire55,2014-07-26 08:15:00,1029,"Mike, waiting for your report on fishing the Asheweig was worth the wait in spades. I thoroughly enjoyed the pictures and videos of you and Bill catching all those beautiful specks. Thanks for sharing your outstanding adventure. Jay"
3032217,Catman59,2014-07-26 08:48:00,345,Excellent Mike ...... the trip and the story are awesome. Thanks for sharing.
