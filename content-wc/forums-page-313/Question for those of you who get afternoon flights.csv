Last year we got on the road midnightish and felt pretty miserable adjusting. I work nights as it is, but I'll be off work as of Wednesday morning and I'm not flip flopping for 1 night again. Originally had a room at the mystic Isle that I canceled last night. I just like the idea of calling it early Friday and having a shorter drive in the morning. Since we're getting picked up.around 2pm, we'll have all our stuff ready to go except a pole and a small box for tackle the morning of pick up and get a few last hours out in the morning. Then a quick clean out of the boat around noon and ready to go."
3027601,forgop,2014-07-24 15:03:00,880,"Flying out of Wawa at 1:30. Kinda stinks because nobody wants to wait THAT long to get out. Prior plan was to avoid crossing in Sault Ste Marie until after 7pm as I don't want to wait in a long line. (My research says 4-7pm is the worst and we're headed up on a Friday). Once we crossed, we'd have about 3 hours until we reached the hotel to call it a night. Now that we have all morning with just a 3 hour drive, I'm more inclined to call it an earlier night and stay in Sault Ste Marie. Any cheap hotels you recommend in Sault Ste Marie?"
3027697,Aspencreek,2014-07-24 15:32:00,2911,"Super 8, check in get a good meal, sit in the hot tub, have a beverage or 2, hit the hay early, enjoy the last 3 hrs of drive time, and have a great fly in."
3027737,SinOrSwim,2014-07-24 15:51:00,1528,"I fall on the side of crossing and getting there as soon as you can. Even if you have to wait the next day it's better than having some unforseen delay making you miss your flight. Flat tire etc. Crossing early gives you the extra time to deal with anything unplanned.THEN, you can enjoy those beverages before you get on the plane. Have a nice relaxing plane ride."

3028001,Tylumps,2014-07-24 17:10:00,73,I came back from Wawa last week. On the way we crossed at Noon on Friday with little wait to get into Canada. I know you said 5pm for you but here is the warning. We left Saturday back to the states and crossed back around 11am and the line going into Canada was a monster. Also check out this site. Gives you the current wait times. http://www.ezbordercrossing.com/list.../#.U9GRpPldXng
3028209,Fish_Heads,2014-07-24 19:16:00,154,"We always stay at the Holiday in Express at exit 394, next to Lake Superior University. You can see the US customs & the Duty free from the parking lot. Not the cheapest out there, but clean rooms, a nice pool & hot tub area, & a respectable hot breakfast bar.I get hotel points on my Visa card, so many of our trips are comp rooms. We've stayed there a couple nights a summer (we take 2 trips per year) for the past 8 years.Fish"

3033913,forgop,2014-07-26 23:42:00,880,Scored the Comfort Inn and Suites in Sault Ste Marie for $73. Not bad for a decent room to feed us breakfast on top of it.
3034081,Mike Borger,2014-07-27 05:57:00,1554,"Meh, if it was me and I had a 1:30 flight I'd do one of two things. First call Martin and ask if I could fly out of Chapleau instead with Canadian Airventures in the hopes I could get flown in earlier. Second if things stayed status quo I'd leave at 1 in the morning and get there just in time to fly in (downside is that'd allow me an extra day of work )"
3034097,Mike Borger,2014-07-27 05:59:00,1554,"Forgot to mention, if you're overnighting in Wawa the Mystic Isle Motel off 17 just south of town is far and away the nicest motel in town. Not even close."
