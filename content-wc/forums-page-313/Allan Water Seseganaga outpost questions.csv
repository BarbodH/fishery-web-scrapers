You won't be catching any trout unless you head downstream on the rivers outlet past the first few sets of rapids. That would be next to impossible to accomplish as getting back up would be hard. I did catch lots of trout in that river especially the last leg just upstream from Wabakimi Lake.I've heard good things about the camp though, lots of walleye and pike."
