Charlotte produces some very nice fish ,being its mostly catch and release, you can eat all you want while there, cabin is only two yrs old,built for 4,Roads into Clova were not bad this yr. Good Luck"

That sets the bar pretty high for other trips. Lt said it was his best trip yet.Air Tamarac's Camps on all three Lakes are producing very well, the bite will be on well into august. Temps still remain below normal, not looking like its going to warm up, Makes for some early fall fishing. My group is 47 weeks out from returning to Lac Hebert June 21 2015 Good luck up there"
