3023417,IaDave,2014-07-23 11:29:00,476,It's been about 10 yrs since we did a shore lunch and looking to do one this year. I don't remember the spot we went to but it was set up pretty good for one- Is it Jim's Windy Beach which is towards the SE Bay? Any suggestions?

With the water higher than I've ever seen it, I was hard pressed to find ANY sandy spot to beach. In most cases, the shoreline was inside the treeline. Water is up generally about 4' vertical, and it's led to record high water throughout the English river system, and all the way down to Rainy, Kab, Namakan and LOTW. Also, LOTS of floating deadheads. Keep a sharp eye out."
