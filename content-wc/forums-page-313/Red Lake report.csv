We had a very good trip. The first 2 days the Black Fly's were very bad but I had taken some fly spray for horses to spray the boat and our socks down with and it took care of them. After 2 days they were no longer a problem. The weather was wonderful as was the fishing. We landed more fish than we have on any of our other trips. It was a great trip and our deposit is down for next year.
