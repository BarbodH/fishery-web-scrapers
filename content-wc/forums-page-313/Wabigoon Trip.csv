Have been reading info from web sites of resort owners on Wabigoon Lake. Wondering how much is accurate - sounds very good - big northern, muskie, smallmouth, etc. and if it was worth a day trip. Only about 35 to 40 mile run to public launch. Interested in exploring new water, and would appreciate info from any who have fished the lake, good or bad. Thanks in advance."

3035681,rich1775,2014-07-27 16:30:00,4,where are you thinking of putting in? if its the public launch in dryden fish the western arm near the float plane base and all the way in the back. also larson bay again in the back near the houses. if after muskie the north tip of anderson island has some giants. be careful the water is very cloudy cause all the clay shorelines hard to see hazards the people at indian point camp hank and cindy are great people

That said, it will be very different water than the Sioux Lookout lakes. As mentioned, the Goon is very colored. Visibility in the big lakes is usually a few inches. Trust your electronics. However, the fish do fine and get fat. Lots of fish spend lots of time very shallow. The cabbage line is way shallow and usually very narrow, but the fish like it. Walleyes, pike and muskies can be in 3' most anytime. They can also be very shallow on the reefs...down the sides too. As said earlier, don't expect to see the rocks unless they are almost breaking the surface. Fishing the Dryden Walleye Masters tourney a good ways back, we caught most all our bigger fish at the bottom of humps. Others fished the tops. Jigs and leech or half crawler worked for us. Spinners shine in that water too. Agree about Indian Point camp. That's where we stayed, but Bill and Phyliss Sidney were the owners then. Nice place. Sids baits was owned by their son. Give it a try, you should have fun."
