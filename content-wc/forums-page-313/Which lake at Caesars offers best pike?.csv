3034577,csmith,2014-07-27 09:11:00,6,Looking at a four man trip to Caesars next July and was wondering if anyone had experience there for good pike fishing? Mostly looking at the smaller lakes like Simard or Impossible. Pike would be the priority! Thanks

I have also been to Little Benny with no luck of landing large trophy pike. However, we did manage to land a lot of walleye's at both lakes. I guess if you have in mind to catch alot of trophy pike I would look somewhere else. If you are okay with catching alot of walleye with the bonus of catching a trophy pike you will be quite happy with pretty much any lake Caesars have."
