3033057,Wawang,2014-07-26 16:42:00,2,"Trish here, Manager of Wawang Lake Resort We have just passed our half way mark for the season and so far the fishing has held steady. We have recorded just over 550 trophy fish for the OFAH rating system and 201 are already up and most with pictures to view We appreciate the work our guests do to not only catch and release these fish, but to fill out their trophy forms and submit the pictures with them The season has been mixed with various weather patterns but we have been having winds predominantly from the west. The migration from our small lake (spawning area) to our big lake went ahead of schedule and presented high numbers of 9-11"", 13-15"", 16-18"" and 20-23"" brood classes with the 15"" running the hottest for the longest period of time.At the moment, the walleye are easiest found in our rocky shores, island points and drop offs and are averaging 22'-28' during the high pressure days in the clearest/deepest portion of our lake. The inked areas to the east are showing more favorable fishing in the 6-10' range.During our pressure lows, the walleye have been coming up to the 12-16' range in the big lake and staying stable at the 6' in the smaller portion of our lake.The season began with water levels 2' above average and have tapered back to average depths. The mayfly hatch has just come to an end and lasted 11 days of noticeable flies. Our trophy numbers remained solid with 27 over 25"" being landed and released as well as our stringers as the fishermen were advised of tactics associated with this time of year. As of today, we have recorded 56 walleye over 28"" this season and 7 of those being over 30"".To view up to the minute action and see which tactics are working best on our lake at any time, join us on fb And as for the road, it is still gravel it is being regularly maintained and graded on an average of 3 times per week, making the travel a lot easier than previous years.If anybody has any additional questions, please feel free to PM me"
