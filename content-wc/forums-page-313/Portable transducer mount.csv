3018970,Wawajake,2014-07-22 05:41:00,413,"I use the same type of Aluminum transducer mount as MorganMan except I got mine at BassPro. Much more piece of mind than the old suction cup method I previously used, and easy to tilt to side if beaching the boat on shore and don't want the transducer to be rubbing on the rocks in waves."

3036313,halfmoon007,2014-07-27 19:44:00,121,Hard to beat a 1x3 and C-clamp. fought the suction cup for years and the cup won. but the stupid thing is i still take the suction cup every year in my boat box. what the heck kind of thinking is that!!!! And Im a research and Development Technician my job for the last 30 years in high pressure water blasting equipment is to prove what works and what fails!!!!! O i forgot I'm a Fisherman got to have a back up for the backup. YUK YUK Halfmoon
3037745,fishron,2014-07-28 10:09:00,317,"As I've mentioned before, I use a substance called vacuum grease. It shouldn't be thought of as a grease because there is nothing slippery about it. It's as tacky a substance can be and if you smear it on a rubber suction cup and press it into place, it's not going to move until you pry it off with force."
2920777,Bitinlight,2014-06-21 06:52:00,95,"So on the 1x3 board, does 1 c-clamp on the transom do the trick?"
2921145,packpro,2014-06-21 08:46:00,695,"5th year for my suction cup. This is a personal preference, not a judgment on the other designs. For convenience of packing and using the locator on portage lakes, I prefer the suction cup. 5 years ago you could not have convinced me of the reliability. I did have one issue with a painted bottom boat and severe scum. Gave the area a good scrub with just a rag and no issue. Just last week the only problem we had was that it stuck too good. Some times it was hard to get off. Fashioned the bracket from a stainless steel spatula that I bought for $5.99. I still tie the excess cord in a half hitch around a rear cleat in case the cup gives ways, but so far on issues. I bought the cup off of the Garmin web site. Not sure if it is different than the others, but great results for me so far. When not it use I keep it stores in a cool, dry, dark area with my fishing line."
2921329,bushead11,2014-06-21 09:44:00,151,"Ok guys. Here is what I do. I take the 1x3 and predrill the holes for the transducer mount and then set it aside. I pack all the other items in the plastic 16"" craftsman tool box (screen, ducer, power cord, mount, c-clamp, zip ties, screwdriver, bag of mounting screws) it also holds all my bottom bouncers... The previous lodge we went to did not have electric motors so I also fit a tractor battery in there. Had enough juice for all week. New lodge has electric motors so I no longer take a battery. I would recommend a 3"" clamp. The one that I have is 2.5"" and it was pretty tight. The one clamp will hold no problem. Having a week to get used to my new Lowrance elite 7 hdi on canadian lakes was great. The picture is just a quick example but i would normally mount it closer to the center and there would be extra wood sticking past the top of the transom so I just slide the c-clap to the side so its on an angle holding the wood to the transom... Total cost: $ 3.49 for clamp at menards and scrap 1x3. Any other questions please let me know."
2922041,Obabikon,2014-06-21 16:05:00,2370,"Yes. The plastic c-clamps are junk, but one good c will do the trick."

3017026,Bitinlight,2014-07-21 12:05:00,95,"Just returned yesterday from 5 days fishing at Lac Seul. Fished for 5 full days averaging close to 10 hrs. per day. Also, fished Lac Seul the first week of June for 4 days averaging about the same amount of hrs. per day, therefore fished 90 some hrs. on the same 8 D cell batteries. When I was done fishing, the unit still read 9.6 volts available. The suction cup transducer never came off once. The Lowrance X-4 Portable is a very reliable unit."
3017578,fishron,2014-07-21 14:41:00,317,I agree with Bitenlight. I picked up the Lowrance-4 just before our fly-in trip. I put a little vacuum grease on the suction cup and had to pry it off at the end of the trip. The unit performed well and there was plenty of power left in the eight d batteries after seven days of use. I took an extra set of batteries and the next time I might save a couple pounds and go with 8 fresh d's.
3017658,octanehi5,2014-07-21 15:02:00,1104,"I have been useing the suction cups for my 10 + yrs of fishing Hebert. this yr I stuck it on the boat, 9 days later had to pry it off. A good depth finder is priceless on this type of trip. Some clamp on types send up quite roostertail behind the boat.I use a small 12 volt 4lb acid battery,charge it in the fish house off the solar panels. cuda 300 home made portable."
3017706,Mike Borger,2014-07-21 15:23:00,1554,A piece of wood and a C clamp works great for me too.
3018138,MorganMan,2014-07-21 18:38:00,341,"I have lost 2 tranducers over the 20 years up north due to suction cup issues and my failures to keep my eye on them. Those transducers were not as expensive as the unit I used was an entry level model. I now have made a nice humminbird unit into a portable and to replace that transducer would be $80-100. Not worth risking so I purchased a transducer mount from Cabelas. Ya, it's $45 but it telescopes up or down and really does travel easy. And there is little chance I will screw it up. Piece of mind. http://www.cabelas.com/product/Porta...ket/699847.uts"
2894649,curt1321,2014-06-13 12:03:00,16,"Hey guys,Many of us are traveling up north for fly ins and have tried to find a good way to mount a fish finder in a rental boat. I finally found something I am pleased with for my trip. The company I am using is www.fishfindermounts.com. I was able to talk to the owner and he helped me build a custom mount to use my Marcum LX7 and LX9 in open water conditions. No holes to drill or crappy suction cups to mess with. Just a powerful magnet system and a very good battery box clamp system. They have a mounting system for about any type of fish finder. You can checkout their videos on youtube. They also can be found under www.floattubefanatics.com/. Give them a call and ask for Wade (the owner), you won't find a more easier guy to work with in my opinion.Curtis"
2894697,Bitinlight,2014-06-13 12:23:00,95,"Good to hear that there is another option out there. Just for anyone's information, I just purchased the Lowrance X-4 Portable for trips to Canada, as my Eagle Fish Easy finally quit working after 12 good years of service. The X-4 is run by 8 D batteries and comes with a suction cup transducer mount. Before leaving, I tested it with my 40 Mercury on a 16 foot Alumacraft going wide open, and the suction cup worked perfectly. In Canada, I fished with a 16 foot Lund Rebel and a 30 Mercury 4 stroke. No problems with suction cup with the 30 running wide open either. Also, fished four full days, averaging between 9 and 10 hours per day. The battery indicator read 11.7 volts when I started, and after the four days, it only dropped to 10.6 volts. I have another 5 day trip in July and am planning on using the same batteries for this trip. This is a pretty efficient unit. Also comes with temperature gauge and various manual settings."
2895673,lassh,2014-06-13 19:36:00,553,"if you take a scotchbrite or similar (sand and sponge) to the transom where you mount the suction cup, you will get a more secure attachment. However, be sure to tie off the safety string to the boat in a way that if the cup does come off, the xducer and cord stay out of the prop but remain attached to the boat."
2897353,bushead11,2014-06-14 14:03:00,151,Just got back May 31. All I took was a 2 foot section of 1x3 that was predrilled with the mount holes and a c-clamp. I've done this for the last 3 trips and it the mount against the camp boat all week. I can try to find some pics if anyone is interested...
2897593,jveri,2014-06-14 16:53:00,70,Im interested
2897873,Guest,2014-06-14 19:18:00,0,"Glad to hear that the battery life on the lowrance X-4 held up so well, I'll be using one on our fly-in. I have always used suction cup transducer mounts. Eventually the rubber starts to deteriorate and the holding power is diminished. I use a substance called vacuum grease. Once applied to the cup, you have to pry it off at the end of the trip."
2914953,jveri,2014-06-19 12:31:00,70,any pics bushead?
2916769,adempsey,2014-06-19 18:50:00,963,"I also used a 2' section of 1X3 to attach my portable transducers for my upcoming trip.edit: This worked great with a 3"" metal c-clamp. Had zero issues all week. I did bring a small thin piece of plywood as well that I placed between the clamp and the transom so I wouldn't do damage to the boat while keeping the clamp tight."
2920337,Bad Santa,2014-06-20 20:40:00,100,"Like bushead11 & adempsey, I've used that type of set up for a long time. i've used hose clamps and factory transducer mts to connect to the board with various mfgs 'ducers. Never have had an issue with loose 'ducer. With the 2' length, the board will fit most any standard transom height. Make sure that you get a large enough C-clamp."
2920681,Obabikon,2014-06-21 06:22:00,2370,"My uncle uses an old rear mount trolling motor shaft/brace. He took the head and foot off, and attached his transducer. Works like a charm (if you have one of those lying around)."
