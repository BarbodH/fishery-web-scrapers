I was told years ago by a old fisherman close to Kenora that there were many islands with rock paintings on them, anyone have more info on this if true. Thanks"
3033225,Obabikon,2014-07-26 17:51:00,2370,"There's one just North of Wisakode Island on the peninsula. That's out of Morson though. Not sure about Kenora, but I know that there are many scattered throughout the lake."
3033345,Further North,2014-07-26 18:43:00,2008,I have pictures of one in Whitefish Bay. I can PM you the coordinates.
3033681,balsl6,2014-07-26 20:58:00,426,Now here comes the tough part. There are a few spots all over that have different markings from the early travelers. This would be a bad year for them as the water is high and they are not as easy to see as you would think. There are some near Blueberry inlet area and painted rock area along with others. I had to have someone show me them and they would be very hard to pick out without knowing exactly where they are. I would have to look on a map and point out where they are. Sorry I couldn't be more help. I could point you in a direction to a guide that could point them out or bring you to them if going to the NW Angle area. PM if interested.

It has coordinates, etc. The link is to Elizabeth Campbell's Kenora bookstore who frequently has them in stock, as may the Kenora Lake of the Woods Museum. A now-deceased Kenora archeologist named C.S. ""Paddy"" Reid was probably the expert on this. The Ontario Ministry of Culture published some of his work. His book ""Environment, Man, and Maymaygwayshi: The Dimensions of Past Human Cultural Impact in the Lake of the Woods Area"" includes photos and locations. It is out of print (I think) but I have found it from used book sources like Via Lib for not very much money. There is another book called something like Indian Art of the Great Lakes. Elizabeth Campbell may have that as well. What is even more cool than rock paintings are rock carvings."
