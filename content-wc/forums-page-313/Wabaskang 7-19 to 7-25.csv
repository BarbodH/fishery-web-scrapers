3037489,Big Mike,2014-07-28 08:52:00,35,"Just returned from a family trip. We are primarily targeting big pike as that is what my teenage sons prefer to catch. They did not disappoint as we ended up with a 43, 41, 40, 40, and at least 10 others over 36. 90% were caugh casting jerkbaits and suspending glidebaits into the deep cabbage and windblown shallow weed flats. One thing that stood out was due to lower than usual summer water temps we noticed alot more big pike were still using the shallow weeds and have not left for deep cooler water reefs as of yet. That explains why we were able to connect so well with casting and not trolling. With that being said, the only time these big pike became aggressive enough to hit was during cloudy periods, which were Sat, Sun, and not again until Friday. Walleye fishing was not as good for us, we caught 2 or 3 walleye every day that were over 24 inches but those were on the pike lures while casting weeds. A large mayfly hatch occured this week on the big lake and really slowed down the bite. We mostly fished rocks in the big lake with jig/minnow or jig/platic and were able to catch enough fish for limits and also fish frys but it wasn't fantastic. We found a large pod of fish up in the last lake on the humps before you get to the falls in 17 feet of water and caught 50 or more for a couple days. I did alot of deep water trolling in the big lake but did not mark very many fish or bait balls on or near the reefs I trolled. I'm pretty sure most of the walleyes are still shallow weed fish as the minows are stacked in the weeds. I see things getting really good the next few weeks as the mayfly hatch ends and the fish start to vacate the shallow weeds and set up on the reefs. I will be up again early Aug and give a report after that. Good luck to all..."
