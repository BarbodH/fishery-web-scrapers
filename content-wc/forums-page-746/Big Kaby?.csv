549131,Guest,2005-06-13 09:24:00,0,Any reports from Kabinakagami yet this year? Headed up in two weeks.
549134,Ketchenanny,2005-06-13 10:02:00,38,"Was at Pine Portage the week of May 23rd. The number of fish compared to last year was down. I think, due to the warm weather (70 & 80 in the afternoon all week) the walleyes had already spawned and were not in the normal places that I would normally find them at that time of the year. One of the guides told me that the ice melted off the lake in mid April and by the end of April the spawn was over. None of the fish we caught had milk or egg's in them. Still had a good time. Largest walleye was 22 inches and the largest pike was 38 1/2 inches."

549148,Guest,2005-06-13 12:45:00,0,Ketchenanny Going with a group of 18 in late July. Any tips on good spots to fish? Have been there twice in the past so I have maps. Just looking for some new areas to hit. Heard one report that the water was down quite a bit. They haven't had much rain since ice out. Are Joel and Dave still guiding? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks

549402,Ketchenanny,2005-06-17 05:54:00,38,"Water level is down just a little bit. Did most of our fishing in Beaver and Melanie's bay with good success in both bays in the number of fish and the larger fish. Pike was caught in Beaver bay with a jig and minnow in shallow water. Also caught alot of fish in Alligator alley off of the point, drifting or trolling along the bottles that are in the water marking the large submerged rocks. Dave is back this year in fact he was the one telling me about the early spawn."
