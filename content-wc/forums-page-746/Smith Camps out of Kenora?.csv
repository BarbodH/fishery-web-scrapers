549901,Reels,2005-06-29 13:50:00,2876,Has anyone ever been here? Just curious what people that stayed there thought? <{{}}><
549906,Guest,2005-06-29 14:35:00,0,I was there for a short trip 7-8 years ago. Clean place. We did our own cooking. The fishing was good. We had to work for them but managed. Got a belly full of Blue in the lodge one night and the people were very nice.

549999,Guest,2005-07-01 15:27:00,0,We also caught some very nice smallies. The walleye were deep but would come up later in the day. We fished around the islands not far from camp and this was in early September. Don't know what the prices are today but then I thought they were very reasonable.
