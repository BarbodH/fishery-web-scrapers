549853,Guest,2005-06-28 12:23:00,0,could someone please tell me what the exchange rate is from US to CANADIAN per dollar going into Ontario Canada & where the best place to purchase Canadian money would be.We have been exchanging our money at the currency exchange store on Wolfe Island at the 1000 Islands Bridge but I thought someone else may have found a better place to exchange money. We live in Saratoga Springs NY. Thanks Jack Holton
549858,MoWalleyeguy,2005-06-28 13:55:00,409,current rate is I believe .812 to every U.S. Dollar. We never exchange for canadian money... most all places will do the conversion for you. (of course they always give you change back in canadian) I just take a calculator to make sure I am getting the right amount back.
549860,WIPP,2005-06-28 15:04:00,75,"I exchange it at my local bank (mine is Wells Fargo in Minnesota). Today, the exchange rate was about 1 US Dollar to 1.23 Canadian. In my experience you get a better exchange rate at a bank than at Canadian businesses, sometimes much better. Reminds me I need to do this soon - we leave in less than 2 weeks."
549861,Guest,2005-06-28 15:09:00,0,Go to-- xe.com -- to get the latest exchange rate. If you use your credit card you will get that days exchange rate. It has been my observation that you will be several percentage points difference in what you get at the local store. No offense as they have to protect themselves in case of fluctuations also. I just find it easier to put it all on a credit card and handle it when I get home.

549888,retire55,2005-06-29 10:08:00,1029,"Jack: The biggest bank in Canada is the Royal Bank. Their web site provides current exchange rates - see http://www.rbcroyalbank.com/RBC:QsLD...cashrates.html Presently, Royal Bank would buy US $ from you at a rate of 1.2092 Cdn. I'm providing this reference just for comparison purposes."
549900,haybaylarry,2005-06-29 13:50:00,55,Just go to the first bank you come to. If you are heading west then you could stop in gananoque. It's a small town with banks. Heading east you could stop in Brockville again a small town with a number of banks. You won't have a problem exchanging money at any Canadian bank and you will get a good rate...larry
