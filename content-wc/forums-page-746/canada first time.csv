549971,Guest,2005-07-01 07:31:00,0,Just got back and I believe gas was 95 cents per liter at the gas station and there are 3.8 liters to a gallon. Didn't buy leeches. Beer is about $30.00/case US funds and $36.00 Canadian. Depends upon the brand you drink also. It isn't cheap but if you split the costs with a group it's not to bad I wouldn't cancel next years trip cause of it. We bring beer from home and after the duty it's about 20 to 22 dollars a case.
549977,515,2005-07-01 07:54:00,254,"Hope you don't think there doing this specifically to you with the prices. Cause we live with it year round over here. Those prices are all pretty much accurate. You have to remember though our gallon of gas is bigger the your gallon so the prices area almost equal when figured out. So there not aiming this at americans, cause we need the vistors more then ever up here. Times are tougher for you because your dollar is way down, and you can blame your leader for that. I few years back you were getting almost 50 cents on the dollar and no one complained, now your only getting 20 cents and it makes it look higher priced up here. So take the pricing for what it is and enjoy the fishing as you won't find it any better anywhere else in North America. Mike"
549984,Guest,2005-07-01 09:31:00,0,"Prices were accurate. We drink blue light. I don't think the prices were geared towards me at all, just very high. The exchange rate is an open market and not dictated by our leader, unless you think the way I do and think of Greenspan as the true leader. No doubt the exchange rate makes a difference, but I just about did a backflip when I heard how much leeches have gone up, as well as beer. The 15% mentioned is accurate, although you can get a small amount back if you happen to travel back when the duty free is open, and have the patience to wait. We must have hit the resturant at the wrong time, Habs. First a group of locals thought that our sweet outside table should be theirs, which we did not think about giving up, and in line for the bathroom I heard the tender and our waitress talking about ""more idiots from the states"". Granted, we are not that bright, but certainly treat waitstaff with respect and enjoy having a good time. We had a designated driver, right there with us, and after dropping $250 in dinner and drinks, we were told that was it, and to move along. It was explained that there were specific rules about how much could be served to a single patron and that there fines were very stiff. I had no reason to doubt that, and do not feel we were singled out, it was however frusterating. I'm sure that the locals are used to the rules and probably pay pretty much the same prices for basic goods like ice and gas, and I mean no disrepect. Personally, I don't enjoy the feeling of being gouged in the wallet or treated like just another idiot because I reside in the states. For those that choose to go, I wish you the best of luck. Definately beautiful and good fishing."
549989,Canucker,2005-07-01 10:35:00,9,"Well, I feel like I am getting raped everytime I go to a sporting event, theater, state fair, trip to DisneyWorld or whatever. Bottom line is if you want to play, your pretty much going to have to pay. Anybody that reads this board is pretty educated on what the cost of going to Canada is. Personally it is going to have to get a he11 of a lot more expensive to keep me from going back."
549990,bigfish1965,2005-07-01 11:05:00,3210,Any place that has to make their entire years profit in five months will be expensive. Try finding a room in Key WEst in winter for under 150 bucks. I can't believe people still use leeches as bait in the north. Save your money and buy worms. People who ask how long the border wait is are not asking realistic questions. You have no idea untill you get there. You wanted more border security...now you have it. Your national debt is what is dragging down your dollar.
549993,515,2005-07-01 12:37:00,254,Done also. Being treated like that is unacceptable in any country. I hope you don't judge us all by the few bad ones you might encounter along the way. Just like everywhere else we have our bad ones that make us all look bad. Best thing to do is remember next time to avoid the place and spread the word to other travellers to avoid it also and there business won't last if there like that for long. Mike
550004,Guest,2005-07-01 17:04:00,0,"Smokey, sorry if it came across that local stores had U.S. prices & Canadian resident prices(except for licenses of course). I just don't understand how a lb. of leeches could cost $15.00 in Ely,MN and be 3 times that where the ""done also"" poster vacationed. Or even the approximate $25.00 per lb. another person paid for in Ear Falls. If your economy is hurting, how do the locals deal with these seemingly high prices? I think I'd be drinking water a lot more if 4 cases of beer costs $150.00(curtails over-indulgence, I'll bet). I've been to your country many times and enjoyed the scenery & fishing immensely, however, if prices this high are ""the norm"" I have other options to explore for my vacation dollars. As one other person said I want to feel like I'm getting a ""bang"" for my buck, and I know that I could put my money to better use(although it wouldn't be as much fun). I guess it just depends on your priorities. Tight lines to all !! Mickey"
549680,Guest,2005-06-23 20:59:00,0,i put a post on here about going to canada for the first time. was very disapointed. however i can not pull up your guys answers to my post. think i had BS on canada and getting back. sorry guys can catch more and better guality fish here pedad
549682,Guest,2005-06-23 22:14:00,0,Stay in Mo ....please
549707,Guest,2005-06-24 11:32:00,0,It's ok with me if you stay home. When I meet people who like to go to Las Vegas for vacations I am always glad. That means there is definitely one less person who could have ended up on the Canadian lakes I like to fish.
549758,Guest,2005-06-26 16:40:00,0,"The fishing is great there, so I hear....."
549793,Guest,2005-06-27 11:46:00,0,You have got to kidding about fishing in MO vs Canada. I catch more fish in a half a day in Canada than I do all year in MO....besides the roads are much better up north. Not sure where you went or where you fish in Mo but something is really out of wack!
549928,Stu,2005-06-30 07:55:00,472,"You know, I read alot of posts from people who went to Canada and were dissapointed that fish didn't jump in the boat. I went one year and experienced a severe cold spell. Caught maybe 6 fish all week. Fortunatley, this was not my first trip. I knew how good it could be and still had a great time. I fish in MO too and there is no place around here that can match the remoteness and beauty of Canada. If you based your experience on the number of fish you caught, you should have probably hired a guide (maybe you did?) but you're still missing the big picture. A week fishing with good buddies and no hassles from work. Hmmmmm are numbers really that important?"
549933,Guest,2005-06-30 09:21:00,0,Have spent a lot of years fishing in both Missouri and Canada. have had bad days in both locations but overall Canada is #1 hands down. It is my guess that you didnt spend enough time researching your choice of Canada Resorts. Or perhaps you went to a Resort that met your pocket book limitations. Canada is full of great well priced Resorts that are truly intereseted in their clients fishing success. It is hard to beat the beauty of Canada and the opportunity Canada provides to catch fish.... but to each his own....hope you catch a lot of fish in Mo....just leaves more for us who believe that Canada is the place to be.
549951,Guest,2005-06-30 14:38:00,0,"Canada is beautiful. Been going to the Kenora area for 10 years and just got back from most recent trip. Fishing was decent with 15 fish over 25"" with the top being a 30"", 4 guys fishing. I however, will not be returning. $95 for a very short 2# of leeches, $150 for 4 cases of beer, over $3 for a gallon of gas, $3 for a 5# bag of ice, gst, docking fees, being treated like the anti-christ at the local resturant for being from the states, the over 1 hour wait at the border, etc... The smaller limits don't bother me, the gauging does. MN has many lakes where fishing can be very comparable, I will be heading there for my week in the future."
549954,IaCraig,2005-06-30 16:42:00,434,"Sorry you feel that way. I agree that Canada may not be the bargain that it once was, but I get enough bang for my buck that I plan to keep going as long as I feel welcome. On all my trips to Ontario the locals have always been very friendly, and I don't believe it was just because they are wanting me to spend money either. IaCraig"
549962,Guest,2005-06-30 19:25:00,0,"Are these prices accurate? Almost $50.00 a lb. for leeches? Almost $40.00 for a case of beer? $3.00 a gallon for gas?(although in WI we are over $2.25 a gallon for regular unleaded) Is this the going rate for these items all over Canada? While looking at different resorts & talking to owners the tax ON TOP of renting a cabin or a boat was an extra 15% which seems excessive. Maybe it's just me but I work too hard for my money and am trying to put 2 kids thru college to not question how much a trip to Canada is worth. That seems like price gouging to me if those prices are accurate and I agree that although the fishing in Canada is great, trying to justify those costs will make me look harder at top-notch U.S. resorts. Just my 2 cents. Mickey"
