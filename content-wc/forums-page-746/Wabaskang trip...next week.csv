I've heard nothing but good reports all through June. Trailerguy...surely you've been up lately! Are the weeds coming in well even with the high water levels?"
549734,Trailerguy,2005-06-25 20:22:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b] Going up Thursday night.The wife's work is taking a 2 week shutdown due to slow sales, so we'll take advantage of it. It sounds like fishing has warmed up with the weather from the reports I've heard. 6 days until I'll be fish'in on Wabby"
549744,Guest,2005-06-26 09:52:00,0,"We're leaving Thurs night also...I'll make it a point to swing by your cabin one of the first few days and meet again. I'm in a different boat this year, Crestliner 202 w/tourney wrap. I'll keep my eyes open for you."
549745,Trailerguy,2005-06-26 10:38:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]It looks like a cold front and rain hitting up there Thursday, I hope it doesn't stick around too long. 6 days until I'll be fish'in on Wabby"
549747,rudy,2005-06-26 10:57:00,36,"just got back from a week at tall pines on the 1st lake.tough week for most.the fish were almost know where to be found in the usual places.one group hammered them up in grawley's bay fishing the mud on the east end.we caught some fish in the weeds where the wimd was blowing in and washhed out a mud line.a huge strom blew in and turned gralwy's to mud so i don't know what will happen up there but steve,at tall pines was expecting the fish to move to the reefs soon as the water went from 64 degrees to 72 last week!we fished hard searching out all hte usual haunts and they just weren't there.the weed pattern was good 3 days but it didn't get going until late in the afternoon.we opted to jerk perch which was pretty good and spent 2 morning and an evening topwater fishing smallies in the 1st and north lakes.smallie fishing was great and pretty much saved the trip.the ontario fish and game had a check station set up just past dutchie's store and were tearing everybody down so make sure to have your fish done right as we were told they had been doing it all over every saturday."
549749,Guest,2005-06-26 11:46:00,0,"Rudy, thanks for the update. I know with all the high water it can really spread out the areas the walleyes will be using. In previous years of high water we fished alot of shallow areas leading into the main lake areas (narrows and points leading into large areas) and did really well. Did anyone fish Keynote at all? Have the northerns been chasing and hitting large lures yet? Thanks again, Mike"
549832,Trailerguy,2005-06-28 07:25:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Big Mike, Did you hear about the storm with the flatline winds? It sounds like a lot of trees went down in the area last week. How did your brothers camp weather it? 4 days until I'll be fish'in on Wabby"
549848,Guest,2005-06-28 11:50:00,0,"Trailerguy, Jim said it was amazing to see. He said it looked like a huge rain storm coming across the lake, but without the rain! He lost alot of trees on his road and was out of power for a day, but luckily had the generator to keep water working for the cabins. He said he's never seen anything like it. Also said guys were hammering walleyes in 6' prior to the storm and the next day same area fish were moved out into 15'. Hopefully the lake has had time to settle down by this weekend. See you up there, were taking off Thurs evening around 7:00 pm. Mike"
