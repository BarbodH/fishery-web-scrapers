Biggest walleye of the week was 25.5 inches, biggest northern were 38.5 and 36.75....northern were really hot this year, seems you'd get them on about every 5th cast. One of our boats lost an anchor and two nets, my prop fell off on the last day about 5 miles from the launch, so the tow in was a bit interesting....thankfully we had two other boats in our party. Weather was colder than what the weather websites stated, about 65 each day, mostly overcast with a little rain on Tues/Wed and when we left on Thurs. Saw a moose on the way out on HWY 664, no accidents, all traveled safe. There were a ton of wood barriers on the sides of the roads that were hammered, so if you're going up, keep your eyes open, and get lots of sleep the night before, so you don't crash. Fished mainly 10 FOW or less. We were pulling in northern/walleye in 3 FOW at times. If anyone is looking for a good northern spot, check out Lili Lake, which connects at the very back end of Italian Bay - watch out for stumps. We nailed the northern there on anything from jigs to Mepps spinners, to Bass buzz baits....walleye too...they were hitting everything. We mainly jigged worms and leaches. Good luck all. 360 days to go!"
