549931,MN_Moose,2005-06-30 08:17:00,965,On Sunday I would think you wouldn't have any wait at all.
549987,Guest,2005-07-01 10:24:00,0,"Orange Crush Guy; Saturday is ""change over day"" at 80% of the lodges; that's the price you pay for not staying in Canada longer to feed the walleye. I'll meet you next year, same time, same place. It was good to see you and meet more Americans,(you guys sure get a lot of snags!). Next year we will fly out for a day, AND you WILL put gravy on your French Fries!! Your Canadian resident application and Canadian Flag are in the mail."
549838,Guest,2005-06-28 09:42:00,0,Going across at Fort Francis on a Saturday. How long is the wait to get across?
549839,Guest,2005-06-28 09:48:00,0,We crossed on Saturday June 11th about 10:00 AM and it took one hour.
549842,MN_Moose,2005-06-28 10:29:00,965,At 8:00 a.m. Sat June 25 from U.S. to Canada there was no line. It looked like if you were 15 minutes later the line was increasing. From Canada to U.S. there was no line.
549867,WIPP,2005-06-28 16:16:00,75,Went in at noon on a Sat. a few years ago and the wait was 2+ hours. I try to avoid that time now.
