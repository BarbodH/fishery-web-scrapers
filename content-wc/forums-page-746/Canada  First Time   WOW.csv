549934,Guest,2005-06-30 09:35:00,0,I just got back from Lac Seul lodge. I took my two Grandsons (15 and 16) and we all had a blast. We caught all the fish you could possibly want to catch and my Grandsons had next years trip planned before we got out of camp and headed home. Both of the boys gave me many a thrill has their eyes just kept getting bigger every time they caught a nice fish. The trip was super for them and gave me exactly want I wanted..A great week of excitment and memories of my Grandsons spending time with me.

He spent most of his life fishing for catfish and trying to make enough money to raise 6 kids. My Brothers and Sisters dont fish but they all chipped in at Xmas to pay for Dad's trip so he could experience Canada and its bounty of nature. Dad caught a 42"" pike and we caught a good amount of Walleye and some nice Smallmouth (biggest 23""). Dad really had a great time and he wants to go back next year. We have already made our reservation for next year and as long as Dad can go we will be there. It was a great thrill for me to see my Father have so much fun. It is a great feeling for me to think that I was able to do something special for the man who made all our lives so special."
549981,Frankm,2005-07-01 08:33:00,154,I started going when I was 10 with my dad and grandpa. I am 35 now and still going with my dad and my friend Tom. My grandpa went with up until 2 years ago. He is 91 now. He is still in great health he just has a bum knee that stopped him. Like others posted you'll have fishing partners for life. When I started going I was just along for the ride. Now I am the guy who organizes everything and my dad just goes along for the ride. He has definately earned it. Great to hear your group had a great time.

550002,Guest,2005-07-01 16:16:00,0,"Great post, the best part is that all of you have great memories of the trip and are looking forward to doing it again. I get more out of seeing & hearing the excitement out of my own son & his best friend whenever we vacationed than I get catching fish myself. Something tells me the anticipation level has been raised for the next trip and with all the planning & such will bring you even closer to your grandsons. Stronger family ties is a great thing, everybody wins!! Way to go Grandpa !!:D"
