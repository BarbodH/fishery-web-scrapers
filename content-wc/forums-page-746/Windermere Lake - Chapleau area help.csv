Our trip begins around July 1st. Has anyone fished here thus far this year or in the past and what kind of info can you share? I hear it's been hit and miss this year so any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance, Taz"
549731,Guest,2005-06-25 15:04:00,0,"Have fished it in the past. Nice area we stay at Como Lake lodge down the road. Caught eyes, pike, and bass. Fished eyes in the narrows not far from the lodge, out front of the waterfall down Grazing inlet, and out front of the houses in Nicholson. Fished for pike up Windemere river, but might be tougher (shallow) this time of year. Caught bass in the bay just before the narrows. Nice cabins, though the train coming through every night is a bit loud."
549748,Taz,2005-06-26 11:05:00,10,"Thanks North Bay. What techniques did you use around the narrows, mostly jigging? How deep would they be this time of year, I'm guessing in the 20' to 30' range? Thanks again, Taz"
549750,Guest,2005-06-26 12:01:00,0,"We used Linde rigs and some guys were using floats. Minnows were bait of choice then but now we use leeches hardier and easier to keep alive in summer heat. They used to sell minnows at Windemere. 20"" sounds about right as I remember. I would like to go back and chase the smallies in there not many of those in Como."
549812,Taz,2005-06-27 17:40:00,10,"Thanks again Northbay. Anyone else fish that lake or that area (Prairie Bee Lake, the Shoals PP, etc.)? Any help would be great. Taz"
549834,jerry bark,2005-06-28 07:37:00,822,"taz, jig and minnow this time of year will get the eaters crawler harnesses as well, trolling stick baits if you want larger fish. i would try the opposite side of the ""channel"" along the railroad tracks at musk. it has some great structure and should produce well. the map i marked for you will get you on some good fish. take the kiddos to the weed bed in the late evening it should be a good bet. for smallies try the entrance to lost lake, its marked on that map, we fished that spot earlier this year and did good. had a big ole moose come down for a drink there about 40 feet from the boat. the fishing was tough in may due to the water temps being unusually high for the time of year. if we located some fish they would eat. good size fish but not the big numbers of eaters we usually catch in late june. have fun jerry"

549922,Reelmn,2005-06-29 19:59:00,328,"I fish Prairie Bee during the later part of July and always do well with Northland Tackle Whistler jigs/ large leeches. 1/8 and 1/16 ounce Whistlers in any color work great. I work these through the slab rocks that form the islands and use good 4# test line although 6 might be a better choice for beginners. There is a large reef app. 1 mile out from the cabins at Camp Prairie Bee that has been a real magnet for late afternoon/evening walleye action. Two years ago, my partner and I drifted around out there and caught and released 25 walleye in 45 minutes all on the Whistler jigs/leeches. Hope this helps. Have a safe and memorable trip, Reelmn"
