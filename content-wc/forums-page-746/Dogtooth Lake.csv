548684,Guest,2005-06-01 12:37:00,0,Anyone have any reports? We're heading up on the 18th and are wondering if this year has started out better than it was last year. There were very poor reports all last year.
549438,Guest,2005-06-18 11:01:00,0,"We were at Dogtooth from June 4 - 11. The fishing was about the same as last year - slow. We noticed a lack of fish in the 16-20 inch range which was very alarming. We caught zero fish between 17.5 - 20.5"" range and only 3 in the 16.5 - 21"" range. The other numbers of fish were still there. Many in the 12 - 15"" range. We fished 6 guys very hard all week and have gotten to know the lake very well over the 7 years we have gone so it is not like we are rookies to the lake. There has clearly been a decline over the last two years in this lake's ability to produce quantities of fish. The slot has changed which now allows one fish over 18.1"" to be kept. Wayne Jones is asking that no one cut up anything bigger than 22"". So, if you are looking for a shore lunch, look to keep those 13-15"" fish I guess. We are not 100% certain we will be going back next year unless we start hearing some better reports. I'm getting tired of the excuses and the increased pressure this lake has received the last few years. I believe it is starting to take it's toll. I'll be interested to hear your report upon your return. The Sheriff"
