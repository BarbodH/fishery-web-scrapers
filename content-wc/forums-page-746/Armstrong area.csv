Am lookin for opinions from the people who have fished the lakes and areas from say Sioux Lookout west and east toward Pickle Lake and Armstrong. I have the last four seasons fished the Lakes (fly-in) west and am thinking about heading to the Armstong area and north. 1. Is there a difference in terrain and or lake structure? (From what Iv gathered so far the lake in this region seem to have more sandy bottoms) 2. Fishing? Qualaty and quantity. Average size? 3. Outfitters? Im sure theres good and bad all over. Recomendations please. 4. Also lake that cosistantly produce. Any comments on the Ogoki river system, Wabakimi region. Cat and Albany river systems? Thanks for your help guys......Kevin"

By the end of the 5 days my arms were sore from catching so many walleye I could hardly hold my rod and set the hook. Our largest was 25 inches with a 22 1/2 as well and many that were 18-20. Our bigger fish came trolling flats and wind blow rock islands, smaller fish came jigging but with a greater quantity, lots of 15-18 inchers. There is a bit more sand up there but a ton of rock as well with a few shallow bays. There is a few good current areas that were hotspots as well. Although we did not fish much for pike there were 4 or 5 40"" plus pike caught while we were in camp. 1/8 ounce jigs with Gulp minnow grubs or whole crawlers were the best producers for us. We did troll some deep down Husky Jerks and got the 25"" on that, Firetiger was the tops there. Wilderness North runs a camp on the South West and North East sides of the lake which have the American plan. The food was great as well as the service, but I would not recomend the guides they offer. They knew the lake but not much on fishing it. Good luck! Bill"

Fishing for walleye and big pike is simply fantastic regardless of weather conditions. Their website is www.northernoutposts.com. Hope this helps!"
549918,Guest,2005-06-29 19:05:00,0,A group of guys thatI have went with have been going since 1991 and have been using Armstrong Outfitters. They fly to six different lakes. Kelly and Maureen Massaro are great host and I believe are third generation in the business. I myself have only went once and we are getting ready to go the second week of August and I can't wait. I can't imagin the fishing being too much better any place else. They can be reached at flyin@armstrongoutpost.
