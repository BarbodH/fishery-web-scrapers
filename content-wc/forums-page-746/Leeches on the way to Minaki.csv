549840,doc,2005-06-28 09:49:00,143,Where is the best place to get quality leeches on the way to Minaki/Kenora? I will be crossing at Fort Francis. Do the have Large and Jumbos of the same quality as the US? Thanks

It is on the far north end of town on the east side of the road (kind of in a strip mall) His run was excellent and my advice is to only get larges because the jumbos were HUGE this year! Larges are $34/lb and Jumbos were $42/lb. Hope that helps! Eric"

I used to always get leaches at the Pinacle before it burned down, the last few years I've been getting thim from Erick Bennett @ the Maple Leaf Motel on the east side. His sizes have always been good and prices about average. I'm sure there are better bargains around, but I have no complaints. Erick usually is up on the fishing action around Minaki too, so I enjoy getting his report when I pass through. His web site is http://www.mapleleafvacations.com/ . IaCraig"
549937,Guest,2005-06-30 10:44:00,0,Hi Guys: The Maple Leaf Motel and the bait shop that you are talking about is no longer open. My understanding is that the Bank now has control of it and when I was there the first week of June talking to some of the local's they said that nothing will be done with the Maple Leaf for quite awhile until the legal part of the foreclousure is taken care of.
