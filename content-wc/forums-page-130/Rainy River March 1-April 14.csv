6305636,pan-man,2019-03-29 18:58:00,299,"I am wondering if anyone knows for sure what the walleye regs are concerning about keeping walleye while fishing Ontario side of Rainy River in the time period of March1- April 14? I know that the MN side is all catch and release starting this year. I have read the Ontario regs for 2019 and it basically says you can keep 2 under 18""'s. Yes, I am aware of no live bait (other than worms in bedding) and also possessing an Ontario fishing license. Thanks for any input."
6307212,stumcfar,2019-04-03 07:50:00,451,Live bait is fine if you purchase in Ontario and have a slip with. You can keep your two fish as long as you docked on the Canadian side. Even with the Canadian license you can't dock in the US and fish the Canadian side and keep two fish.
6307224,Shortline,2019-04-03 08:14:00,234,"I do not believe this is correct. If docking on the US side and fishing Canada, you should be able to keep your two - and return DIRECTLY to the landing and leave. You can NOT, however, stop and fish on US waters with any fish in possession. Travelling with legally kept fish should be ok."
6307234,Shortline,2019-04-03 08:59:00,234,"*edit* in looking at the regs - I appear to be way off base. It looks like The MN DNR is only allowing possession of out-of-state fish from INLAND waters of Ontario... So to keep Rainy River walleyes in Ontario, you would have to launch from the Ontario side and return to the U.S. via a customs station."
