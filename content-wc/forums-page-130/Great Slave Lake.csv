6260094,growingoldoffensively,2018-11-13 18:33:00,250,"Buddy and I are planning a 2020 trip to Great Slave Lake. This is a bucket list trip for the both of us. Looking for trophy pike. Going to search the net but thought I'd get some ideas from WC first. Planning on visiting some of the All Canada shows this spring. Some questions: 1. How long ahead of time do you need to make reservations? Thinking about a year. 2. When's best time to go? Thinking June or July. 3. How much and what type of equipment? Thinking a couple of heavier duty type rods and reels. Have a Legend Glass for tossing spinnerbaits and cranks and a Legend Extreme I use for tossing larger swim jigs for pike. Both are 7'11"". That length a problem for transport on a plane? 4. Extra line? 5. Lures? Planning on taking spinnerbaits, cranks, and swim jigs. Any suggestions and advice would be appreciated."

6260110,bthomas3333,2018-11-13 20:24:00,465,"Hello, I planned a 2 week trip to GSL that I took in Mid to Late June of 2018. I fished Frontier Fishing Lodge and Trout Rock. Both are excellent and distinctly different experiences. I wrote trip reviews on the site here. Frontier Trip Report:https://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...light=Frontier Trout Rock Trip Report:https://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...light=Frontier I believe you could get into Frontier right now for 2019 as I have spoken with them about a quick 4 day trip in 2019 and it seems like they could squeeze me in, but planning more than year in advance would give you best choice of dates. I am hoping to go back to TR in late June 2019. Holding a 3 day slot. I spoke with them in Sept and they are basically book in 2019 and 2020 had like 2 weeks left. Don't read too/too much into availability. TR only fishes like 8 weeks total. It is 100% pike. But I will say it is AMAZING pike water. Read online reviews. If you want 100% big pike. Trout Rock is probably the place to go. I say probably because Taltson Big Pike is rumored to be as good or better. I am booked to fishing Taltson Big Pike Lodge in August 19. This is the other REALLY great pike spot on GSL. Check out the reviews for them too. A lot rougher lodge/lodging than TR but fantastic big pike numbers come out every year. I am very excited to give it a shot next Summer. I will post a report when I get back. If you are looking at GSL the other option is Plummers / Aurora Nights. Which I don't have info on. If you want 100% pike June is good but big fish are caught all season at Taltson. TR as I mentioned shuts down bc they get weed bound by very shallow water and the owner shuts it down. Which I respect vs taking money to fish limited spots. TR fishes approximately June 1 July 20 and are 100% word of mouth. Really no advertising needed. If you want to go there book asap. They basically fill up 2 years in advance. I also will mentioned I thought I wanted mostly Pike fishing but REALLY enjoyed the change of pace catching tons of big Lakers and Grayling at Frontier. VERY profession operation. As the other poster mentioned Midnight Sun in Alaska is also a great trophy site, albeit it with water level and clarity problems that come with fishing a river, and obviously not GSL. I know guys would have lost a whole trip to terrible water conditions on the Annoko / Yukon. Questions. 1. Book ASAP if you want TR. Otherwise Sept/Oct should be fine for 2020. 2. For Pike I like June at FFL or TR. I believe Taltson does well all season. They fish through Sept but June books first there too. 3. I took a large boat bag. A backpack tackle bag. A rod case. A second carry-on backpack. 4. Longer rods are good. I prefer 7+ for big pike but they can be a hassle to carry on / airplane issues.. I also prefer 2 piece rods for travel remote. You might have airplane issues if you need to take a commuter jet into YellowKnife. I think United Air Canada commutes say like 74 in max but check that. I have had very good luck with Westjet and I know they fly 737s into YK. 5. I spooled up with 65lb 832 and used Muskie Floro and Titanium Leaders depending lure. 6. Depending on where you are fishing the gear changes. Overall Doctor / Williams and Rapala weedless spoons where great. Jointed soft swimbaits were very good. In general everything works. The fishing is really that good. Got into one bay where the pike were smaller and after messing around with 5-6 I took the hook off a surface duck lure and just enjoyed watching the surface strikes 4 and 5 times on a retrieve. It is just that good. Please feel free to Private Message me if I can help more. Brett"
6306410,Guest,2019-04-01 07:37:00,0,Any unguided option available? Fine with being guided for a day to learn waters and hazards and general tactics but prefer to go unguided and figuring things out myself.
6306430,bthomas3333,2019-04-01 08:21:00,465,"Hello,Taltson Big Pike Lodge (Bay camp) offers unguided trips. As Mike mentioned the fishing is in a relatively small area. One other nice thing about TBP is they fish at night. You can literally fish the river to midnight if you so desire.Brett"
6260162,Mike Borger,2018-11-14 06:14:00,1554,"Some great advice from Brett.As far as when to book, it really depends on the camp, but a year in advance would be smart imo.Honestly timing varies depending on the camp. There's good fishing in every month of the open water season.What equipment to bring is pretty easy. Personally I'd bring 4 dedicated pike rods. Two med/hvy spinning rods with 4000 series reels spooled with 30lb braid. Two baitcasters, one standard med/hvy stick with an appropriate reel spooled with 40lb braid, and a light ""downsizer"" musky rod and appropriate reel spooled with 60lb braid. As far as lures go, that's a question that would take a little more time to answer. I always bring extra line!As far as options for pike on Great Slave go, there aren't a ton and they are all very different.1. Frontier Lodge on the east arm. I have fished it and did quite well. The pike are in Stark lake which is easily accessible from the lodge. Bonus of Frontier is world class trophy lake trout as well, and grayling in the Stark river next to the lodge. Timing wise, I'd say the first couple weeks of July if pike are super important.http://www.frontierfishinglodge.com/Here's the story on my trip to Frontier: https://www.canadafishingguide.net/t...das-far-north/2. Trout Rock Lodge on the north arm. Incredible trophy pike fishing, but it's very seasonal with the month of June being by far the best time. No real access to any other type of fish, but the pike fishing makes up for it. Season is short so owner Ragnar Westrom books mostly shorter trips. Longer trips are possible but you're paying a premium.http://enodah.com/3. Taltson Bay Big Pike camp on the south shore. Again, incredible trophy pike fishing, but no access to lake trout. Many people say it's the best pike fishing in the world and it DOES churn out big numbers every year. Pretty much any month of the open water season is good, but August is favored by many. The cabbage is fully grown and the pike are aggressive. Lots of walleye here too which is somewhat unusual for Great Slave. ONLY downside imo, the prime area at the Taltson river mouth is not real big. If the lodge is full you'll be in close contact with other anglers especially trolling the river channel in the evening.https://www.taltsonbay.com/4. Aurora Nights Lodge upstream on the Taltson River itself. More of a rustic camp, but the trophy pike fishing is otherworldly. Many of the fish are river bred. Much thicker and darker than the sleeker more silvery fish in Great Slave. The last two weeks of September is a great time for this camp. Schools of whitefish run the river from Great Slave and hordes of pike follow them. The number of pike in the system doubles at this time of year.http://www.auroranights.ca/5. Brabant Lodge on the outlet of the Mckenzie River. This lodge may in fact not even be operating anymore, hopefully I'm wrong. If it is, it's a great option. The Mckenzie is unreal for big pike and this area has really flown under peoples radar for years now. The river is very large here, mostly quite shallow and loaded with cabbage and big pike. Anytime in July or August would be good.http://www.brabantlodge.com/index.html"
6260180,jambi,2018-11-14 07:22:00,504,one of these days...I keep saying that... I WILL GO
6260284,dhottle,2018-11-14 14:50:00,163,"I have fished Great Slave twice out of Plummer's Lodge at the Taltheilei Narrows & the Taltson river out of the now defunct Arthur Beck's camp. All trips were the 1st or 2nd week of their season opener in June. Plummers offered both lake trout & pike. The Taltson was strictly pike with occasional walleye mixed in with the pike. Both are great fisheries. I also spent about 12 years going to Lakers Unlimited on Lake Athabasca fishing for pike & lake trout. Another outstanding fishery. I caught my PB pike on the first day of a weeks trip where we had to break through ice to get where we wanted to fish. Even though you might be bait casting tackle only Mikes suggestion to take a spinning rod & reel is good advice to rest your body by using different muscles/approaches if you get tennis elbow or a sore wrist from slinging big baits. Definitely plan your trip a year or longer in advance to get the week that you want. We always found the opener gave us a better shot at a true trophy pike than latter in the season. Glide baits, spoons, inline spinner baits, soft swim baits & jerk baits will cover all the bases for both aggressive & neutral fish. When the bite slows on big baits switch to small baits & vice versa it seems to get them fired up & more aggressive. Multi-piece travel rods work great if you don't want the hassle of oversized rod tubes. I personally would limit my rod selection to 7.5' max. Braid from 20-30 lb for spinning & 40-65 for bait casting works great especially around weeds/cabbage. I preferred titanium leaders for stealth or 80-120 lb flouro for bigger baits. Pack a couple spools of extra line, pliers & jaw spreaders. Bogas work great for landing fish/weighing/unhooking if you don't use a net or cradle. Saves your hands too. Good luck with your trip. https://www.bassresource.com/bass-fi...959a-1024x768/"
6260322,Boondock,2018-11-14 20:15:00,1056,Booking marking this thread! Great info guys
6260396,Knutson21,2018-11-15 07:43:00,348,"I have not fished Great Slave, but I have fished Lac La Martre just west of Great Slave, by far the best fishing I have ever experienced. Both Pike and Lake Trout. I would give that a look when you go to book. We booked our trip there, two All Canada Shows before we went, and was there the 4th of July week."
6261736,dhottle,2018-11-20 09:49:00,163,I have fished Lac La Marte and agree it is another great fishery. I caught a 20lb silver pike there on a bunny jig which got the native guides more excited than a big regular pike. https://www.bassresource.com/bass-fi...hern1-800x600/
