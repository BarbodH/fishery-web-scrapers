6295048,tv4fish,2019-03-04 05:14:00,2694,"I'm going to add my $0.02 about the ""hazards"" to be aware of on Lac Seul.As said - the low water does expose usually hidden rocks, etc.The high water also can cause additional timber to be in the water that you need to be wary of - especially when the water is high and you're boating through high wind and waves - you need somebody in the bow to watch out for ""floaters"". Last I checked - there is NO point in pointing in a waypoint for them....................."
6295084,Pooch,2019-03-04 07:10:00,4618,Spending the night stranded on an island with a buddy would have a very different ride home if the same thing happened with your wife.Was it about five or six years ago when the water on LS was so high? Lake was full of floated off timber and every time the wind changed it moved back and forth around the lake. Had quite a few soft thumps that year. Had to go slow all of the time.Pooch
6295100,prov1800,2019-03-04 07:29:00,5010,"Doesn't reaĺly matter where you stay.the whole lake is awesome from one end to the other.the earfalls end is pretty open so with windy days your limited and will have to find calmer spots.the scout bay area gives you some options to get out of the wind.walleye fishing good everywhere anytime.pike fishing for larger fish is usually also very good but it's best in colder warmer.you can catch pike all day anytime but casting the banks ,rock piles and weed beds will mainly produce smaller fish.the bigger predators will be deep and harder to catch.probably I'd say the earlier the better.even June 15 will have water temps higher already and August will be up to 70 f or higher.best time is ice out unfortunately.while walleye fishing you will pick up some decent pike jigging or trolling.find the rock piles with deeper water dropoffs and just work them."
6296694,Quiters,2019-03-07 11:11:00,4,"Thanks for the great tips and ideas. We will make sure to have a current navionics chip and use caution. We will be seeking out some deep water haunts for big pike. We will be trying big swim baits, bondy baits, blade baits, rippin raps, and jiggin raps. Looking forward to a trip in the future."

I know with the Active Captain app this data can be shared, but when I looked last fall there was none yet. I don't mean to hijack the thread, but this data would be definitive in avoiding Lac Seul's hazards for new or experienced fishermen"

6304970,Aspencreek,2019-03-27 20:06:00,2911,"After looking at those maps, I see at least 5 spots I could/should spend some time getting to know."
6292216,Quiters,2019-02-22 05:38:00,4,"We want to fish Lac Seul in the summer of 2020 for the first time. We will bring our own 20 ft boat and would like to fish for both Big Pike and Walleyes. We are limited to going between June15-Aug15 due to work (school teacher). We are trying to decide if we should focus on the Ear Falls area or Scout Bay area Lodges to be close to good fishing, and what week(s) would give us the best chance at a trophy Pike. We have lots of fishing experience, just not on NW Ontario lakes. We will be traveling from southern Michigan. Thanks for any input and suggestions."
6292282,wooglin,2019-02-22 08:49:00,371,"Go to the NE section of the lake and get after walleye, big pike and musky...."
6292548,mswope13,2019-02-23 08:59:00,73,"NW Ear Falls area can be really good in early to mid June. Starting the end of June into July when the water starts to heat up, head south to Steamboat area. McKenzie Bay will also hold lots of big walleye."
6293238,MikeinMN,2019-02-25 20:15:00,190,"I have fished Lac Seul from near Ear Falls for several years now. We ventured as far as Manitoba Point one year, mostly just to see what we had heard others talk about. For the last few years, we fish Steamboat Bay quite a bit, and McKenzie Bay is a s far as we will travel. I've never been in Scout Bay, but on the map it looks close to the same distance from McKenzie bay as we travel from Gawley's Little Beaver on Goose Bay. Since McKenzie Bay is as far as we ever go now, there wouldn't be alot of difference in fishing from either Ear Falls or Scout Bay for me. Our group does stay at Gawley's, but I think all the resorts on the Ear Falls end, including the Scout Bay resorts, are pretty good places to stay. Find the one that fits your groups needs and book it, these places all have different amenities, and all seem to book up pretty fast. As far as the pike fishing, we have caught some really nice pike (40""+) but they were all incidental while we were walleye fishing. I do not know an area to target pike specifically, but to be fair, we don't usually fish the shoreline, and we don't usually see any weeds, but maybe that's not how you target pike anyway. It's a great lake to fish, and I don't think you will regret a trip there, with or without numbers of pike."
6293526,Quiters,2019-02-26 18:04:00,4,"Thank you for those that have replied. Just wondering how long it takes to get to Steamboat Bay from the cabins in Goose Bay. Also, has July been a successful month for both big Pike and Walleye?"
6293556,Pooch,2019-02-26 20:08:00,4618,"It's been several years since I stayed at Goose Bay, but I'm thinking it's about a fifteen to twenty minute ride to the narrows opening into Steamboat. There are some shallow reefs that you need to watch for between the camp and the narrows. Have someone show you when you get there.Pooch"
6293582,MikeinMN,2019-02-27 00:03:00,190,"Pooch is right about some shallow spots between Goose Bay and Steamboat Bay. He's also right about the 15 minute travel time. Any resort you stay at will be able to give you a safe travel route to Steamboat Bay from Goose Bay. Once in Steamboat, the Bay is pretty hazard free except for close to shore and some exposed rocks along the west side. I think July is as good a time as any for fishing and usually some really nice weather too."
6293732,BreezyPoint,2019-02-27 12:55:00,1581,"All of the hazards cited are pretty clearly marked on my paper map. You still need to be careful as a couple of them sneak up pretty fast.We have had really good fishing in Steamboat Bay, but don't overlook spots closer. We have caught walleye up to 27 right in Goose Bay. Some nice northerns as well. They were all caught trolling crank baits in August.Frank"
6293806,Pooch,2019-02-27 18:39:00,4618,"Hopefully the OP has a Navionics chip or good maps. I would hate to fish LS without a chip and GPS unit. I have many, many hazards marked as red X waypoints on LS that are not on any map I've ever seen. With the lake being down last year I added quite a few more that need to be given respect when traveling.Love the lake, but it is the most hazardous lake we fish. You have to always keep your head on a swivel and one eye on the depth finder. The guy in the front of the boat has to be constantly scanning the water ahead, too.It's not hard to wander off the ""known safe"" routes when traveling.I don't think I've ever gone to LS and not seen someone during the week limping back to camp on the TM or Kicker. Sooner or later that will probably be each of us.Pooch"
6295022,Aspencreek,2019-03-03 21:37:00,2911,"X2, I have ""nicked"" many a prop but thank goodness not bad enough to limp back, except for the time when I was following my brother and looked down at the map and depth finder at about 5mph and he stopped. That cost me $1000!!! Yess, I may have been following to close! But I have also had the unfortunate instance to tow in a guy who thought it was OK to go between 2 islands that have a rock shelf between them that was about 10"" under the water and hit it at about 40mph. Took his lower unit right off and launched him airborn. Towed him from Shanty back to Scout Lake camp. And got a couple back to camp after spending the night on an island who were lost and ran out of light the night before, MAN..... was she Mad! Must not have been very romantic out there! But Pooch is right, sooner or later............."
