Once in awhile we will run into a small group who boat in down river and setup camp on 1 of the islands. I believe you are obligated to buy a Ministry Camp-Fish permit and must boat in and boat out. My son who always goes with our flyin group is looking to do a boat in and camp and fish. Any info from anyone who has done this would help. I believe parking is a ways up the river that flows into Aba, hence youre boat down river. Any info on $ of the permit etc thanks"

We will be doing our annual flyin in June so its not an issue. Mys on was thinking a july or august trip in and abit more hardcore. Either way, its a nasty trip from tht road-river access into the lake....we did it 1 yr many ago with Howard...UUUGGGHHH. The big question is, the trip back up river to your vehicles....and hoping there are still there"
