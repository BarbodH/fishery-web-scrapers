6306682,x4flatfish,2019-04-01 19:07:00,319,"They will work. Go to their website and you will see that the letter/number designation is how they designate size. I prefer x4's. I think they are 2.5"". The f4 and f5 are smaller. I have used as big as a u20. (maybe 3.5"") They pull really hard and are too big imo. As a side note these will tend to dig/dive. So if you troll too fast, they tend to snag more than spinners. Have used this method for over 50 years in various places, with much success...give it a try"
6306902,JBaranek,2019-04-02 10:21:00,35,i've had success using white or black mister twisters on my bottom bouncer spinner harness.
6307038,Palancar,2019-04-02 15:16:00,52,"For fun, try an 8' flyrod with 6' leader, 1/4oz egg sinker and 4' more leader. Tie on F4 flatfish. Use a floating fly line and fish over weeds. Flyline keeps flatfish just ticking the weeds. Walleye, pike, perch and bass love it and you get a flyrod fight."
6305952,ILScott,2019-03-30 18:38:00,139,I usually like to troll with a bottom bouncer and spinner rig when targeting walleye. I usually tip my spinner rig with a small piece of nightcrawler. My question is what artificial bait would be effective with this technique. I would like to try artificial instead of always using live bait. Thanks Scott
6305970,chris.brock,2019-03-30 19:26:00,112,"my 1st choice would be a ripplin redfin, stupid looking thing but it's deadly and proven, it floats but it's not super buoyant"
6305978,Remi,2019-03-30 19:34:00,41,"We run a 3 hook spinner with a full crawler. One year we tried a plastic crawler, natural and the other was purple. And the purple color plastic crawler caught walleyes. Don't think the natural color caught anything."
6306014,x4flatfish,2019-03-30 21:42:00,319,"Have used gulp worms and leeches. Reasonable success. Also have used Uncle Josh pork crawlers before but not sure you can get them anymore. These worked well also. Sometimes these work as well as live bait, but I still prefer live crawlers.PS...always wondered if the 3 hook spinners were legal? Seems I have read regs. (maybe Canadian) that only allowed 2 hooks..."
6306120,retire55,2019-03-31 09:42:00,1029,"In Ontario, a fishing line must not have more than 4 hooks attached."
6306132,x4flatfish,2019-03-31 10:02:00,319,Thanks
6306192,Palancar,2019-03-31 14:18:00,52,"Try an F4 flatfish behind the bottom bouncer. About 4' back should do it. I fished with nothing but F4s for several years for walleyes. You get pike and some really big perch also, but mostly walleyes. They're fun, work, and don't cost anything to use. If you don't like it you can always go back to crawlers. Just make sure it's a F 4."
6306202,adempsey2.0,2019-03-31 15:02:00,611,"Slow death hook with an artificial plastic, such as a Gulp 3"" Fry Worm, Pinched Crawler, Nightcrawler or Leech. A lot of artificial options, but those are what I have used."
6306212,kona77,2019-03-31 15:57:00,236,"We tried plastics like Gulp crawlers/Uncle Josh pork etc for a couple of years but had very limited success. Did try some floating Rapala's last year and did catch some fish..3'-4' leader and various sizes of Rap from C-3 to C-7's. Did use Power Pro on these leaders to keep from losing Rap's to pike..I am also going to try some minnow plastics this year (like a 3"" Gulp minnow) behind a B/B.."
6306224,x4flatfish,2019-03-31 17:10:00,319,"This is funny/ironic...see my screen name. I thought the OP was looking for options on his spinner, but you bring up a good alternative. We started using flatfish in the 60's. Used to buy them by the case. Orange with black dots. Then orange with a black bill and a black stripe down the back. Now they come in a multitude of colors. We removed the front hooks and tipped the rear treble with a crawler. I think we catch bigger fish with this method but maybe not as many. We used a 3 way swivel in the old days and the flatfish were actually made of wood then. Still use them today just not as often. By the way, nothing but X4 size...."
