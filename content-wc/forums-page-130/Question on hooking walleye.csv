Are painted hooks not as sharp as non-painted hooks? That's debatable. I switched out all of my hooks to non-painted Gamakatsu octopus hooks and it made a significant difference. As others mentioned, you need really sharp hooks. When jigging, it's always best to keep your line straight up and down. You also want to set the hook with a straight up motion rather than with a sweeping motion. Sometimes if the fish have the jig completely in their mouths, it is possible that as you set the hook you are popping their mouths open with the jig head and the hook just follows and never has a chance to penetrate."

6307334,Iceshack05,2019-04-03 13:05:00,31,"How sharp is your hook? bring a file. Check it regularly especially when fishing around rocks. Also, the length of a shank on the jig will be important. Stingers hooks will also help! (I prefer not to use, but can be good for kids or beginners)"
6306318,Herkyhawk00,2019-03-31 21:06:00,33,"Hi, All. I apologize for the elementary question, but despite loving to fish, I cannot get out as much as I desire. I am rather new to walleye fishing and was hoping you could provide me with some info to improve my catch rate. It seems that when setting the hook with a walleye, many times they get off. Knowing a bit more about how they approach their bait, am I better off just reeling in when feeling a good bite allowing the walleye to hook itself and avoiding ""setting the hook"" by jerking my pole back? I thought I watched a video of a guy who even suggested dropping the pole back a little to allow the walleye to better take the bait?"
6306324,sagecreek,2019-03-31 21:18:00,24,"set the hook you'll catch more than you miss. but walleye are sneaky little things, sometimes they just hold on the bait and other times they slam it. the more you fish them the better you will get in recognizing their bite."
6306326,GBS,2019-03-31 21:43:00,2271,"Common advice is to give them a bit of time - wait for the bobber (if using) to go well under. With spinners, lindy rigs leave the bail open and your finger holding the line, and when you feel the ""tap"" let go of the line and give them a bit to fully take it without feeling any resistance. BUT, with normal hooks, you increase the chances of gut hooking, which is very bad if you plan on releasing. For that reason, I've switched to almost exclusively circle hooks. Much lower chance of hooking them deep. And, you never have to set the hook, just reel. With jigs, I pinch the barb down to make the removal easier/less damaging. As long as I don't let the line go slack while fighting, I've never found that I lose more with barbless."
6306344,kettyspanky,2019-04-01 04:40:00,271,"Are you casting? Bottom bouncing? What is your fishing method? If you are bouncing off bottom, they do have trailer hooks. It helps a lot in the rivers."
6306400,BornToFish,2019-04-01 07:17:00,1224,"Greetings, I've observed over many years of walleye fishing that walleyes are most often ""deliberate"" fish. They often are not in a hurry. They will hold the bait before deciding what to do with it - eat it or spit it out. Thus, giving them slack line for a few seconds often improves the odds of them swallowing the bait. Ketty offered a great comment. Hooking walleyes will depend on the technique used to present the bait. Hooking isn't too much of a concern when trolling or casting. Either the fish hooks itself or it's gone. Jigging or rigging are different than casting/trolling. Anglers targeting walleyes with jigs or rigs often give walleyes slack line for several seconds when they first detect a bite, in order to improve the odds of a walleye getting hooked. I'm wondering if the original poster might benefit from using larger hooks to increase the gap available to hook the fish. Most of my jig fishing is with size #1/0 or #2/0 hooks. I also use premium hooks that are SHARP. I keep a hook file readily available to touch up hooks when needed. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6306452,stumcfar,2019-04-01 09:03:00,451,"I use mono line and I am a firm believer in a good hard hook set. I have had people with me that wonder why I set the hook so hard. The top of the mouth is hard and you never know when it will be a really big walleye. I don't think you can go wrong with lifting the rod tip and if the line starts to tighten or you feel the fish with the rod tip, give a good strong hook set!"
6306472,Herkyhawk00,2019-04-01 09:51:00,33,"Thanks for the replies. To be more specific, it appears that it happens mostly when jigging either while backtrolling or drifting. Just seems like I would get a big pull, jerk the pole back in an attempt to hook it and that as a result, the fish would let go. Just didn't know if I need to be more patient and less aggressive when trying to hook them."
6306476,Limeyangler,2019-04-01 10:03:00,563,"I rarely have the bail arm of the reel on when jigging or trolling with spinners, i hold the line using my index finger, not only does this allow me line control it enables ne to detect bites better too and give slack if needed when a fish bites. Jigging with bigger baits I usually always allow a bit of time before setting the hook, but sometimes the fish are in an aggressive mood and instant hook sets are needed."
6306528,BornToFish,2019-04-01 12:12:00,1224,"Greetings,The vast majority of my walleye fishing is spent vertical jigging. I will offer some comments on how I go about this, recognizing that the comments should apply equally well to drift jigging.As Limey pointed out, I also drape the line over my trigger finger to increase sensitivity - to better feel the bite. When jigging, I leave the bail on the spinning reel closed. I just reach down and pick up the line to drape it over my trigger finger. When rigging, I do the same as when jigging, but with the bail on the reel open. The reason that the bail is open is that the boat is usually moving along pretty well when I am rigging. I just can't drop my rod tip enough to make sure there is slack in the line until I am ready to set the hook.I have caught many walleyes while jigging. It seems as though I can quickly recognize when the bite is aggressive versus passive. I just set the hook when I feel an aggressive bite.Things get a bit more complicated when I sense that the bite is passive. Indicators of a passive bite might include torn skin/scales near the tail of the minnow, the tail end of a crawler missing, getting the head of a minnow back or the leech is missing. These indicators might be what the original poster experienced - a hard tug on the fishing line, but nobody was home!I normally address a passive bite by immediately dropping my fishing rod, to give the fish some slack line. I give the walleye slack line for several seconds - say three to five seconds. I then lift the rod to pick up the slack line - all the while I am feeling for any signals from the fish. I might feel nothing when the slack is picked up, which tells me the fish dropped the lure. Or, I might feel a tap-tap-tap, which tells me the fishing is still chewing on the bait, such that I need to drop my rod again to give the fish more time. Or, I might feel weight on my line. In this latter case, I just continue lifting the rod to load up the rod as I let the fishing line slip off my trigger finger. I want to feel the weight of the fish in my rod. I keep my fishing rod loaded at all times once I set the hook.I have had many fishing companions remark how subtle my hook set is. There is no ""swoosh"" sound from my fishing rod, like a Samurai sword slicing through the air. The technique that I use for detecting the bite and setting the hook has worked very well for me for a long time.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6306534,Herkyhawk00,2019-04-01 12:29:00,33,Thanks a lot. Really makes sense. I think my issue has been setting the hook too quickly and being overly anxious and not allowing the walleye to take the bait.
