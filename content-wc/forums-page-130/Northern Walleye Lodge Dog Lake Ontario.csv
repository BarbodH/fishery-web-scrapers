3204090,jfaisten,2014-09-26 09:06:00,1060,Looking for a lodge with both walleye and smallmouth -- planning a trip in the spring Any experience with Northern Walleye Lodge? They have a good web site any other suggestions (walleye and smalls) thanks
3204242,Tylumps,2014-09-26 10:05:00,73,"Hello, If you are going to Dog Lake I would recommend Northern Wilderness Cottages if you are going to do the Housekeeping Cottages. Price is better and the family that runs the outfitter are great people. Cabin 3 and Cabin 1 are the best, Cabin 3 has the beach and Cabin 1 is on its own island. The lake can be tough. Big body of water so you can spend a bunch on gas. If you go I can send you a map of were I had my best luck. The fishing was great in the Am and Late evening but not much during the day for walleyes. Other lakes to check out that are better for quantity of fish would be Murray Lake and Prairie Bee Lake. They are closer to WAWA and have a better rep for quantity. Murray Lake has better facilities, Prairie Bee has much older cabins. On a side note, Lake Saint Clair is the best Smallie lake I know of."
3204250,ftfarms,2014-09-26 10:08:00,444,I've fished a lot of lakes in Ontario since 1990 and here's my favorites. Lotws out of the morson area. Cedar lake at perrualt falls and English river around separation lake. That's for walleye and smallmouth. Cedar and lotws big kicker is the crappie fishing can be awesome at the same time.
3204370,jfaisten,2014-09-26 10:41:00,1060,Tylumps and ftfarms -- super info. thanks Lake Saint Clair is fantastic smallmouth fishing. Sometimes I think I'm crazy for going all the way to Ontario --
3205186,Tylumps,2014-09-26 19:33:00,73,"I see that some people are responding with NW Ontario suggestions. I did the drive to LOTW and it was a very nice lake with every species imaginable, but it is a good 16 hours from the D (Detroit). It's a haul."
3206122,kzoofisher,2014-09-27 13:13:00,5144,"Dog is a popular early season walleye lake, don't know if the smallmouth fishing is all that. I've been mid-summer and we caught smallies when we targeted them though they were small. Dog has multiple camps on it so you it can get crowded. I assume that getting away is one of your criteria or you would stay on St. Clair, if something non-Canada would be acceptable consider the Bays de Noc. Great fishing for both species, a couple hours closer to home and the season will probably be opening earlier next year if the DNR can figure out when it can start to make new rules again."
3207057,dosxx,2014-09-28 07:23:00,60,"Happy Day Lodge has plenty of smallmouth action and walleye to boot-- it is about a 9 to 10 hour drive from southwest Michigan, with at least 45 minutes of that on a slow going dirt road to camp. The price is reasonable and with one camp on the lake I don't find it to be crowded. It is a big lake with a couple of other outpost lakes available. Bringing your own boat is a great option, with the only downside, in my opinion, being that if you do any amount of running around, you will burn through some gas. I figure on a 6 gallon tank a day minimum using my 30 hp 2 stroke-- my buddy brought an 18 foot boat with a 115 and went through double the gas I did, even being judicious on the throttle. There are a few threads on this site about it.Feel free to PM for additional regarding amenities and such."

Clean, well maintained, and the price is right. If bringing your own boat bring dock bumperssince the lake can get rough and dent you up otherwise."
