6306606,walleyecheek,2019-04-01 14:48:00,2231,Somtimes they check what ? If you got nailed 15 years ago for a OWI they have to let you enter !!!
6306654,rangerfisherman432,2019-04-01 17:45:00,36,Show me where it says that. There are tons of reports of people being turned away From my understanding it's a coin toss
6306744,kettyspanky,2019-04-02 04:41:00,271,"I guess if you wanted the boat, you should have taken care of this first. 15 year old owi is a no brainer. Cross the boarder and get the boat and come back. Either that or pay my way and I'll get it for you."
6306758,Shellback,2019-04-02 05:34:00,8083,"So if you didn't have the border issue with the DUI, is it just a simple procedure to fill out paperwork and pay just the govt fees and no broker fees?"
6306760,Hot Runr Guy,2019-04-02 05:41:00,16061,"I guess I don't understand this. Where in Canada is the boat, how far to the border? It seems like with the broker rates you've been quoted, which don't yet include transporting the rig from the seller to across the border, taking the 8 hour drive and 1 night in a hotel is a no-brainer. Remember, you have to deal with Customs on the US side, so all you need to tell Canadian Customs is enough of a story to get you across, like you're going to Cheetah's in Windsor,,,,, HRG"
6307066,Skywagon,2019-04-02 17:11:00,1106,"Here is a company I am currently using (today actually) to import into Canada (they also do export). Mark Busa (CCS)| Intermediate RaterAssiniboine/LEI Customs Broker | 115 Paramount Rd. Winnipeg, Manitoba | R2X 2W6Phone: 204-774-8376 | Fax: 204-774-3018 | Email: [email protected]I have also used these people in the past https://northernborderexport.com/ I have never paid over a $100 for the paper work, you must be including freight in that $1500 figure."
6306040,Shellback,2019-03-31 06:05:00,8083,"So is the problem taking the boat from Canada, or bringing it into the US? I've hauled my buddy's Canadian registered boat back to the US each fall for storage, and was never asked about it. Seems to me if it's about bringing the boat into the US, just have a friend pick it up and meet him at US customs to get it documented."
6306058,Fisherman Ted,2019-03-31 07:22:00,461,"The laws just changed regarding border crossing and a criminal record, including DUI convictions. Old DUI offences have been grandfathered up to December 18th, 2018.https://www.cicnews.com/2018/09/feds...0912#gs.3rjtaz"
6306106,rangerfisherman432,2019-03-31 09:13:00,36,"Canadian boats don't have a title. To title it in the us, you need the paper work from customs. So when you bring it over you need to declare it. Since I can't cross, I can't declare it. And apparently only the buyer or a broker can do this - not the seller"
6306110,That Minnesota guy,2019-03-31 09:21:00,8293,Hope you got a heck of a deal. Sounds like alot of hassle and expense to only save a few bucks. Those DUI's just keep on giving. I'm sure you will have many great trips once you get everything taken care of.
6306128,kettyspanky,2019-03-31 09:56:00,271,I had a DUI 15 years ago. I have been crossing the border at pigeon river for 6 years with no issues. My truck and my boat.
6306146,walleyecheek,2019-03-31 11:17:00,2231,There must be more to the story. If you had a dui 15 years ago you should be able to cross the border no problem ?
6306166,Fisherman Ted,2019-03-31 12:34:00,461,I have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. The old DUI should be a non-issue based on the new law. So cross the border and take care of it.
6306172,fishin10,2019-03-31 12:48:00,2315,"Why not take a quick road trip, get to the border and check things out. If you get across, contact the seller and get your boat."
6306178,walleyecheek,2019-03-31 12:55:00,2231,Like I said ! There must be more to the story why this gentleman can't cross the Border ?????
6306602,rangerfisherman432,2019-04-01 14:43:00,36,"Not more to the story. I called and spoke to a border crossing agent. She said most of the time they allow you in, but its up to them. Sometimes they check, sometimes they don't. Not going to flip a coin on a 8 hour one way drive. It'd be nice if they were more up front with people."
6305588,rangerfisherman432,2019-03-29 16:09:00,36,"Due to a dui 15 years ago I can't cross into the **** country to pick up a boat I bought. Hoping someone has bought a bought from Canada and either used a transportation company or a customs broker to get it into the US. The first company wanted 1,399 just for 3 forms - what a joke. Anyhelp would be greatly appreciated Boat would be coming through Detroit or Port Huron"
6305610,That Minnesota guy,2019-03-29 18:12:00,8293,Flip the seller a few bucks to bring it across and you meet him on this side.
6305618,rangerfisherman432,2019-03-29 18:30:00,36,That's the issue. You apparently can bring a boat from there into the us to sell. I have to get it at the Canadian border and bring it across
6305630,That Minnesota guy,2019-03-29 18:41:00,8293,Is this a private party sale or you buying from a dealer? A dealer should know somebody or how to do it.
6305638,rangerfisherman432,2019-03-29 18:58:00,36,Private
6305770,CI_Guy,2019-03-30 09:42:00,2118,"I called a guy that bought a 1969 Javelin in Alberta 5 years ago and had it shipped to NW Wisconsin. The seller delivered it somewhere close to the US border then a customs broker recommended by the person that inspected the car for him took it across the border and delivered it to an affiliated trucking co. in Havre MT. that then delivered it to him. He would like to know who quoted you $1399. for the border crossing, he paid $1500. for just the border crossing 5 years ago."
6305812,rangerfisherman432,2019-03-30 12:04:00,36,"1,400 is just for the paper work. They won't physcially touch the boat There are numerous companies that do it."
6305908,walleyecheek,2019-03-30 16:18:00,2231,15 years ? How far do they go back for dui convictions ?
6305918,Shellback,2019-03-30 16:53:00,8083,I thought there was a fee you could pay that allowed entry?
6305930,rangerfisherman432,2019-03-30 17:29:00,36,It's 200. But it normally takes 3-6 months. At the border it's up to the crossing agents. Not gonna risk a long drive to be turned around
