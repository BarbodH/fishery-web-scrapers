I celebrated my 25 a couple of years ago so I know it is a big deal.You mention Tetu so the budget must be fairly high/open. If the budget is open and it must be a fly-out from Winnipeg with American plan the two best (and pricey options) are Ganglers Main Lodge and Wolleston Lake Lodge.If you are traveling to Winnipeg to start with would you be open to traveling to Saskatoon or YellowKnife? I think you could open up a few more choices for less overall cost without sacrificing quality.Have a great trip!Brett"

6305856,KSjim,2019-03-30 13:44:00,88,"I have fished Aikens, Ganglers, and Maynard. I would highly recommend Maynard not so much the other two. You might want to look at Plummers Great Slave Lake Lodge. The Taltheilei Narrows is a very special place."

I would suggest you look at gunisao lake lodge, they fly out of Winnipeg area and it is supposed to be a 5 star operation. I would go but my wife says it cost too much and since I usually fish in the red lake area, I wouldn't be fishing for a different species than I already do."
