I had a dui over 30 years ago and have never had an issue, but with laws changing and such and the fact that they have no solid rule I’m just wondering what it is that needs to be done if anything. I Don’t want a surprise at the border."
6307356,Wickguy1,2019-04-03 13:29:00,14,I am right with you. My dad and I are going back in June. His DUI was over 30 years ago and hasn't had a problem since. We have had no issues in the past crossing but all these articles have me a little spooked too. I would hate to get turned around up there since we are riding up together. There seems to be no real assurance anywhere online if the rehabilitated status still exists.
