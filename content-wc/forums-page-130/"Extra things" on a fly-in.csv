6305140,Rondogpike,2019-03-28 10:15:00,24,If it is posted I missed it. Bring an oil thermometer. Burning your oil the first day or two is the worst.
6305150,middle son,2019-03-28 10:28:00,15,A couple of the battery powered bug zappers for in the cabin....makes short work of skeeters. You can get them at Fleet Farm etc for under five bucks - shaped like a small tennis racket - press the button to energize & zap. A lot easier than trying to kill by hand - works on flies too.
6306028,fishpoop,2019-03-31 03:28:00,630,"To that first aid kit I'd be sure to add Imodium, Gas-X, and some Pepcid. Garlic, hot sauce, beer, grease, chip type snacks, onions, jerky, beans, etc, seem to be standard fare at many fish camp meals and a couple of days of that type of diet will turn even the strongest system to jello. As for me, my system is jello already on the best of days. So.... Don't leave home without it. Nothing ruins a fishing trip faster than sitting on the toilet all day.Also, Ibuprofen or similar, for minor headache and pain relief. Claratin, or similar, for allergies."
6306134,KSjim,2019-03-31 10:03:00,88,Another item for the first aid kit. A tube of Orajel for tooth pain. Weighs nothing and can be a real game changer.
6306162,Jeler,2019-03-31 12:13:00,92,"My wife brought this along once and we never go fishing without it now!Gets rid of the ""fishy"" smell on our hands for good at the end of the day!https://www.doterra.com/US/en/p/dote...ming-hand-washGreat ideas BTW on the upscale First Aid Kits! Thanks for the info!"
6302250,WallyWarrior,2019-03-21 00:03:00,2488,Maybe the best tip on the board right there. Will it also help with black flies biting your ankles?Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
6302738,tweedrules,2019-03-22 04:16:00,107,Rope for a clothes line. It always rains and you need some place to dry your stuff. Speaker and old school ipod. No wifi conection where we are. Travel mug for boat for tea/coffee. First Aid kit. Including bacatracon (spelling?) Duct Tape. Always use it every year. Lighter for the boat.
6303972,MrSimon,2019-03-25 07:09:00,922,"I'll re-emphasize the first-aid kit. But, not just a store bought one with a red plus sign on the front. Those are just a million bandaids and some bee sting wipes. Take the time to build out your own. Put some thought into it. Think through what could happen in the bush and prepare for it."
6303998,kona77,2019-03-25 07:55:00,236,"This has been a good thread and we have added many of the items on this list over the years.. We love to sit on the dock at night with a portable Bose speaker/Ipod and have a some adult beverages (just a few).. Nothing better than catching walleyes while enjoying our favorite tunes and the beauty of a Canadian shield lake. Also agree with the comment about the medical kit and customizing to assure you have a number of potential problems addressed. We always have one per boat and include items like super glue (help close any deep cuts), Neosporin, hydrochlorid/anti-itch cream, gauze wrap et.."
6304024,camp chef,2019-03-25 08:45:00,915,grill tools...I bring what I like to use and them leave them in camp. I also can't emphasize the first aid kit enough. We have lidocaine and syringes in case we need to do hook removal and we have a suture kit to stitch up cuts if necessary.( never had to use them but would never travel into the bush without them).
6304030,Shortline,2019-03-25 09:00:00,234,"And..... if you rinse it out real well, it makes a fine mug for your mixed drinks during the day.....I kid, I kid... ."
6304040,bushead11,2019-03-25 09:45:00,151,"A big bottle of pump hand lotion. After 3 days, everyone in our group was complaining about dry hands and then they crack are more prone to getting cut and infected. The sun and constant wet/dry does a number on your hands. About 3 years ago we started bringing the lotion and its always gone towards the end of our trip."
6304574,Golden Eagle,2019-03-26 14:35:00,2642,"Brain, watch, calendar or whatever to keep track of day to leave. Not my group, but the party that replaced us at Cobham River Outpost, thought it was Saturday when Pete Cay arrived early Sunday morning to drop off a new group and fly out other guys. Guys were down river and out on big water when Pete landed and told them he'd send another plane because he had a full schedule that day. Guys with wrong day in their minds payed extra for a round trip flight from Red Lake to Cobham River Outpost. About 290 float plane miles for 6 passengers."
6304794,Jpat,2019-03-27 08:22:00,10,Iâ€™ll always bring an extra pair of polarized sunglasses. A few years ago i lost my only pair in the lake on day one. I was lucky that it was rainy and cloudy most of the rest of the week. I find it uncomfortable to be in a lake on a sunny day without sunglasses.
6304860,Ogoki,2019-03-27 13:22:00,291,"I agree 100% with Me Simon. Put together a first class first aid kit. I can remove hooks ,which I have . I can sew up cuts ( not pretty but held wounds together) i carry sutures and numbing agent . Pain meds , tums etc. I am a worry wart and like to have my bases covered in an emergency. I carry a 5x5 piece of orange tarp material, in the boat ,if we need to flag a plane down. My buddy used it and saved a potential issue. Think for the worse and hope you never need it . I carry fire starters etc. Think outside the box ."

6297218,Aspencreek,2019-03-08 12:54:00,2911,"This tells me you have no idea at all. 1) Your behind is dry before you can get your junk situated and your pants up. 2) if its good enough for your kids behind it's more than good enough for yours. 3) They are also good for cleaning your nasty hands and face before you dig into that sandwich. 4) They can be used for starting fires. 5) They can be used instead of the Clorox mixture. 6) They come in their own handy container. 7) What do you do when your TP gets wet? With these not a problem (I hear it rains once in a while up there) 8) The swamp ### you are referring too is you sweating ""down there"" 9) They do a way more effective job at getting the dirty work done. Try it you'll like it."
6297286,MikeinMN,2019-03-08 15:11:00,190,I like to take along a pair of jaw spreaders to make taking the hook out of them slimy old northern pike a little easier.
6297344,andreindy,2019-03-08 17:42:00,308,"If you wear/need ""cheater"" glasses like I need to see properly when tying knots, etc, BRING A BACK-UP pair. A back up pair is $5. I don't know if a ""back-up"" locator is considered an ""extra"" thing, but on my last fly-in, the transducer for the HB Piranhamax 197c failed. Subsequently, one of the boats had no locator for 4 days and that was a significant blow. I will never be without a back-up locator again. Even if I never, ever need it."
6297504,bthomas3333,2019-03-09 08:53:00,465,Ok. Maybe because I am an older guy but I was resistant to using neck graiter. I started about 3-4 years ago wearing these things and they are awesome.I can put on sunscreen in the am and wear the Graiter all day without having to reapply sunscreen constantly. They also work to cutdown on wind while you are underpower. When it is cold it cuts down on windburn / windchill.I never thought I would wear these things but they are really pretty great and there are plenty of options in color / patterns so you can get a look that works for you.B-
