6304784,SimonHockey04,2019-03-27 07:21:00,25,What size spoon do you prefer for catching numbers of Pike? We have a good recipe for Pike on the grill!
6304828,frozen fish,2019-03-27 10:27:00,92,"I've been fishing Red Lake, Keg Lake since the late 90's. These lakes like every other lake fish better on the windy side of the lake. Check the weather for several days before you arrive for wind direction and see which islands/shorelines have had the wind blowing on them before you arrive. The Weather Network and Windfinder are the best sources. I've had some surprises using this method, had a postage stamp island on the north side of Red Lake produce very well when a South wind had been predominant for several days. Wind moves bait fish, predators follow bait fish."
6304832,stevensinks,2019-03-27 10:36:00,330,"Most of the Mepps we use are No. 5s. We used to use much larger and we will put a larger one on if we aren't having any luck with the smaller ones. But for the most part We catch more on the smaller ones. We use orange, gold, red & white, pink, char, black. We also use 4 - 10 inch twister tails. rubber frogs and spoons of all sizes. One day I took 8 pike from a small cove with a 2 inch white spoon. I cant really say I have ever got another fish on that spoon but it sure worked that one day As far as jigs go 80% of the time we use 1/8 oz for every thing. If we are really after perch we my us a 1/16 or a 1/32. Im not sure I know Post Narrows and I cant find my big map that shows all of the lake. All of our fishing is from Wolf Narrows to the west end of West Arm."
6305106,SimonHockey04,2019-03-28 08:38:00,25,Thanks for your tips. So for example a northern wind choose the south side of an island? And for example a western wind choose the eastern end of lake?
6305124,frozen fish,2019-03-28 09:32:00,92,"If the wind is blowing from the North, choose the north facing side of the island or shoreline. The wind will blow the baitfish onto the side facing the wind."
6305128,SimonHockey04,2019-03-28 09:52:00,25,Thanks for the clarification. What part of the lake do you fish?
6305168,frozen fish,2019-03-28 11:15:00,92,"We fish where the fish are. The lodge owner of Sunset Lodge tells us where his guests have been successful. We have fished all of Red Lake, and every year we find some new spots."
6305172,SimonHockey04,2019-03-28 11:22:00,25,Have you tried fishing king island? We caught a ton of walleye there in 20 to 30 ft of water.
6306174,frozen fish,2019-03-31 12:51:00,92,"Yes, I've caught fish around King Island. In some years there have been no fish at King Island. Fish move, it changes every year. Fishing memories sometimes produces nothing. I have dozens of waypoints saved from the west end to the east end and everywhere in between."
6301370,SimonHockey04,2019-03-18 11:00:00,25,"I'm already getting excited for our annual fishing trip to Canada! (8/3-8/10) Last year we had a tough first couple of days until we switched to using minnows rather than nightcrawlers. We caught mostly Walleyes, a few Perch and two 30+ Pike. My family members are mostly casual fisherman, we all just want to have a good time. I've heard that there is Perch in Red Lake but we have only really caught Walleye. Does anyone have good spots for Perch or Pike? (Preferably within 5 miles of Howey Bay) If you have any tips on what spoons for Pike that would be great as well. (Picture of my 21"" PB caught right off the dock of Howey Bay Resort)"
6301470,King Canada,2019-03-18 17:05:00,27,I like running down to Keg and fishing around the easternmost Islands and also the current areas going out of Keg.
6301974,SimonHockey04,2019-03-20 10:11:00,25,"We have struggled fishing in Keg Lake. Which eastern islands are you talking about? We have tried fishing Raven Island with minimal success. (51.000558569, -93.700470375)"
6302320,King Canada,2019-03-21 06:20:00,27,When you come out of the river just turn left and work your way to the east end of the lake.
6302590,King Canada,2019-03-21 16:03:00,27,I like to slip rig there with a heavy egg sinker so I can keep pretty vertical and move slow. If the fish are aggressive spinners and bottom bouncers. Crawlers if using spinners and minnows if not.
6302622,SimonHockey04,2019-03-21 18:01:00,25,Which islands are you talking about? (Coordinates would be helpful) I see about a half dozen different islands. Is there a certain depth you target in August? Did you happen to catch any pike or perch in these areas? We just use bubblegum and yellow colored jigs with a nightcrawler or minnow for walleye. I made some homemade Lindy Rigs for walleye but we ended up catching more pike on them.
6304092,stevensinks,2019-03-25 12:16:00,330,My wife and I have been fishing red Lake the last week of July or the first week of Aug the past 10 years. But we fish the very north end so I don't know if any of this will help. We use more Mepps spinners than spoons to catch pike. We catch lots of perch fishing for Walleye but the are all small. Last year was our best year and we were bottom bouncing with crawlers. We also do a lot of jigging with crawlers. As far as depth we were catching fish in 25-30 feet and we were catching fish in 4-5 feet. It was just a matter of looking until we found them.
6304124,bthomas3333,2019-03-25 13:36:00,465,My experience with the far East end on RL has been Orange jigs/tails and blades are best followed by Chart. I have always done much better with live bait. Within the choices at live bait minnows out fish leaches and worms 2 or 3 to 1.For pike spinners have also been best for us followed by swimbaits.That being said Red Lake is huge and we are normally fishing earlier in the year.Brett

6304780,SimonHockey04,2019-03-27 07:18:00,25,"We fish the northern end of Red Lake as well. I bought a Mepps Musky Killer because I heard they work great for Pike. Do you think the color of the spinner matters? (Do I need a few different colored ones?). What size jigs did you use when you caught those perch? We caught some walleyes by Post Narrows (51.131149821, -93.783715414) we jigged with minnows by the rocks early in the morning and later in the day moved deeper in depth. Thanks for your help"
