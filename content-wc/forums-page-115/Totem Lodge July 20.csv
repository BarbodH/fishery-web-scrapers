6345426,78dave,2019-07-30 05:34:00,53,"Wife and I just got back from Totem. Had a great trip. My thoughts follow what was suggested here before we left - Go west. Yellow Girl was not too productive but Red Cliff was very good. Fish were not on humps for us, but guides said they were. Struggled to find fish in lots f places, but when we did find them it was good. Minnows and leeches were best but crawlers caught them too. Spent about $300 in boat gas as Totem only sells premium at over $2 a liter. Remember they charge USD for EVERYTHING. I did go around to Sioux Narrows and bought some gas for CAD. Not a lot of people out of Totem. They all go out after eating and filling themselves with food. We headed out at 5:00 am and generally never saw anyone until 9. Overall a good trip"
6345572,mjames,2019-07-30 11:58:00,18,"Just curious, did you try around shore island or just stay in Red Cliff Bay?"
6345800,78dave,2019-07-31 06:09:00,53,"No, hit Chisolm, and our west to Moskahossi. We were very close though - just east."
6308560,martinbns,2019-04-07 07:49:00,1520,"I lost tow lower units in my first two years on LOTW. 1. It's a maze of islands and channels, very easy to get turned around 2. shoals everywhere lurking just under the surface, I mean rock surrounded by more than 100' of water on all sides. You are crazy to try and fish the lake without a GPS enabled unit."
6308596,Wall-i-Lama,2019-04-07 09:58:00,1524,"Wouldn't even try it without plotter. Don't worry about the coordinates of the buoys, just understand what side to drive on."
6308598,BreezyPoint,2019-04-07 10:10:00,1581,I agree with this post. While the 6213 and 6214 (Sabaskong Bay) are fairly good maps there are still a few unmarked hazards on them. I have the Lakemaster chip in my Helix 7 and this chip has all of the unmarked hazards I have found on 6214. This is not available for the Garmin units.At least every other year I see a boat that had substantial lower unit damage on Sabaskong Bay. I have seen a couple cases where the lower unit was entirely sheared off.Frank
6308646,Redline,2019-04-07 13:09:00,73,"I've made the ride without GPS many times. No reason to anymore. What I will say though, is don't 100% rely on your GPS. The maps are not 100% correct. There are a few areas on LOW that show you on land when you're clearly not. Always keep your eyes out."
6308740,brian1785,2019-04-07 18:57:00,1534,Totally agree with Ruddinger! I fish Witch Bay and see the EXACT SAME THING from Totem/Wiley guide boats.
6308808,78dave,2019-04-08 04:21:00,53,"You've convinced me. I will get a unit with a map card. I am really glad we decided to pull my 2050 Crestliner Sportfish up to LOW. 900 miles, but have the comfort of my own boat. Not sure why everyone is in such a big hurry - lower units don't get sheared off at low speeds. I hit a wing dike once, but at idle. I do know think when this happens it is a violent scary event. Wife is not a speed demon. I really doubt we will get too far out. Like to at oleats see Wiley Point, so that might be the longest trip. So Navionics + is the way to go? Not LakeMaster?"
6309220,Ruddiger,2019-04-09 08:59:00,649,"Howdy, Yes, the Navionics + is the only one that has the region you will likely be fishing. Lakemaster never got the rights to do the whole of LOTW so their coverage only goes over about 70% of the lake. You should go to their websites to see the difference. Take care, Ruddiger"
6309944,78dave,2019-04-11 05:14:00,53,"Ok, I have been eying a new HELIX 5 CHIRP DI GPS G2 NAV+This unit from Humminbird has the US and Canada lakes installed:Includes Navionics+ (U.S. and Canada) SD card for out-of-the-box map coverage of over 21,000 lakes and waterbodies.I also have the Stryker 7sv unit too, so between them I would good I think. Any thoughts on the Helix 5 offered here with the chip? $399 + $13 to ship it."
6310848,1100 Remington Man,2019-04-13 13:17:00,73,"Call me old fashion but I use to fly people to Kenora for 15 years and just took a old Lawrence flasher and rented a boat and purchased the lake maps for LOTW and just fished within 10 miles of Kenora and caught lots of fish in a tiller handle 25hp with a 16-18 ft boat. Every night I would study the maps and have a plan where I thought I would find fish and went and fished them and If I did not catch a fish in 20 minutes I went to another spot, and I would catch my fish by days end. I always had my compass and map and used it. Buy the Maps in advance study them and have a plan of where to try and have fun. My biggest walleye 27inches catch and released. Fish where others have suggested and you will do well. It's not rocket science. Just FYI I never damaged a motor or prop. I also know a lodge ran over a guest one year hoped him off the front pedestal seat and had another boat run into a island. So Guides are not always safe ! I have also fished the south end from Sportsman's on Guided trips for work and took the guided boat trips with them a couple times. Here is a tip there is a Public Boat ramp right by the lodges just launch your boat there and wait till 8am and follow the Parade of boats out and when they get to where they are fishing mark the spots on your GPS and just keep going you can see the lodge boats from a long ways away just continue to drive through marking spots on your GPS the first day. The next day you can be to those spots at sunrise and be limited out by 8am. If you think this is cheating, I use to fly the Missouri River in South Dakota in the spring to see where people where fishing and remember to try those spots next time I went out. Have a Nice Trip and there are plenty of Fish for Everone."
6310966,78dave,2019-04-14 06:38:00,53,"You are wise. I love maps. I too like to hoover over them and know the way as best as possible. I get the parade idea too and I will mark a route out to Yellow Girl that I can follow out and back. But I know the buoys are there for a reason so I need to know them, GPS coordinates, and just reconnoiter the area and know where I am. The details of the maps gives me some comfort, knowing where I am on the map helps me too. I used to teach map reading and how to find your self out or to places with a map and compass."
6304822,Wall-i-Lama,2019-03-27 10:23:00,1524,"One big note of caution. Over the years I have assisted three boats that smacked the reefs in whitefish narrows. All were folks new to the lake and didn't understand how the channel markers are set up. Look at your map and understand in advance how the markers are arranged. The markers are set up as they are in a river system, but can make navigation of this big lake confusing depending on your orientation. Daily, you will run out long bay and the red markers will be on your left and the green on right. (Red/Left, Green/Right) This will be the case as you head west and northwest. Return at the end of the day, reverse that and life is good. The problem comes when you go out long bay and turn left or south thru whitefish narrows. The markers will now be red on right and green on left. (Red/Right, Green/Left) The error made by many is that they don't realize the change of ""downriver"" navigation. The three I assisted kept red left going down thru whitefish narrows (same as just minutes ago in long bay) and the reefs thru there, outside the markers, are non forgiving. This navigation error happens often there and accounts for many of the stories I hear from others. The net is that many view going down thru whitefish narrows from long bay as a left turn, when it is effectively a complete change in channel direction. This change applies to everything south of that point in whitefish and Regina bay areas. The second biggest navigation problem is that others see guides and more experienced anglers take shortcuts and try to follow. I had a friend that would always cut thru a gap that he had used for years. One day, just got to close to island and smacked the rocks. I still see boats shoot that gap, and cringe when I see it. I would recommend to stay in the channel markers in all your daily runs and returns. Apologize if you are already well versed on this, but I hate to see someone new to this area have problems. Again, good luck and have a safe trip!"
6305404,78dave,2019-03-29 06:16:00,53,"I am far form well versed on this. I looked at the map an the red and green were indeed confusing. Red being port and green being starboard, but that reverses as the channel changes flow direction. I think the idea of just taking my time is a good one. Funny the GPS comes up as I just went crappie fishing Wednesday and the Garmin just quit. Great. No GPS either. Have a RMA under warranty and will send it back today. Did catch a couple limits of crappie though so spring is here. To all I really do appreciate this input. I have learned a ton and will make a call to ask about the map. I got the Hotspots map, but perhaps there are other maps I need? My sonar does not have a chip for a lake map. We fished the French river last year and sure enough we got lost. Lucky for us someone came by and re-directed us. Take care all"
6305408,That Minnesota guy,2019-03-29 06:27:00,8293,"Once you check in spend some time picking the brain of the resort owner. Voice your concerns, he will help you get around. It's in his best interest that you have a safe enjoyable trip."
6307552,78dave,2019-04-04 06:51:00,53,I have the maps and found the navionics map online and it looks like the first several miles is straight line from buoy to buoy. As it tightens up I see the route is more critical. Tking my time out the first time I can waypoint the buoys and run between I would guess until I get further west. Thinking about getting another sonar with a SD lake chip.
6307578,Bill Krejca,2019-04-04 07:15:00,6107,"In waters of which I am unfamiliar(and on some of which I am), I always take a long hard look at my map before starting to a new location. Generally, most maps will show a safe route through buoys, whether the route is ""upstream"" or ""downstream"". Perhaps not looking can be compared with not wanting to ask directions when lost on the road. It only takes a minute to check out the map, regardless of the up or down rule. Bill"
6307612,Redline,2019-04-04 08:02:00,73,"I've made the drive from Sioux Narrows out to the Cliff Island area for over 20 years on our yearly trips. If you say on course, its pretty easy. The trouble comes when you try new spots in areas you aren't familiar with."
6307946,78dave,2019-04-05 04:44:00,53,So Redline how long does that run take? Do you run full throttle?
6307952,DeBo,2019-04-05 05:30:00,211,We ran from crystal harbor to red Cliff last August one day. I have a tiller with a 90hp and cruise around 25-30mph. Fairly certain it took around 45 minutes.I have an old navionics chip with a navigational trail. Had no issues. I will say you should spend time getting familiar with the bouy system as it would be easy to mess up but also easy to follow. I thought they switched out at whitefish narrows so search that.Water stayed blue out to the smiley face and then turned tanin. Nice water out there but we sure didn’t find many Muskies.
6308530,78dave,2019-04-07 05:14:00,53,"I ordered the LOW Whitefish Bay 6213 chart map to go with the Fishing Hot Spots maps I got earlier. I am still really thinking about getting a chart plotter GPS. I just bought a new Garmin Stryker 7 that does not have an SD card slot thinking I would never need it. Well I should have spent more, but limited Cabelas points to use. I am looking online for one and then get a card so I have the lake mapped. The comment about getting in trouble off course makes a lot of sense but at idle that might ding a prop, but not tear off a lower end. What I want to find as well are the buoy GPS coordinates. I assume those are fixed and don't move too far?"
6308548,Ruddiger,2019-04-07 07:09:00,649,"Howdy, Respectfully speaking, I would HIGHLY recommend getting a GPS capable sonar unit and using the Navionics+ mapping software for that area, particularly since Lakemaster is limited in its LOTW courage. I fish out of Witch Bay but have been as far as Totem on long runs and frequently see their boats, overloaded for comfortable fishing as they cram as many people into them as possible (at least the ones I have seen). Having said that, I think (again respectfully) you would be crazy to drive on LOTW without a GPS and navigation software. The lake is big, rocky, and dangerous if you don't know where you are all the time. For your safety and the happiness your vacation is supposed to bring I highly advise spending the money. Take care, Ruddiger"
6303844,Wall-i-Lama,2019-03-24 19:30:00,1524,"Is that American plan or room only? Is that the price for a room, or per person?"
6303888,78dave,2019-03-25 04:45:00,53,I saw that $150 a night was available but I think per person. I did not think they had one bedroom accommodations. In 2020 that is a possibility. I need my son in law to experience the quality. Might fly in too. Just want to explore LOW and see how we do. Got a cover for the boat to trailer up 1000 miles. Wife is getting excited. A friend that fishes witch bat camp and gave me some gold hammered head jigs. He returns in June so I will have him bring some back. Otherwise I have not found them on the internet Starting to chase walleye in Missouri as the dams open up. A three fish day is a good day - Not Canada
6304080,Figure-8,2019-03-25 11:50:00,111,"I've stayed at Wiley and in Sioux Narrows and prefer Wiley for the location as others have said. From Sioux you will run 45 minutes in summer to get to the better humps. I would also use Manitou's suggestion, I have fished with Dave and he's a great guide with a lot of knowledge of LOTW. Have fun, regardless of where you stay or what you do you will have a great time!"
6304348,78dave,2019-03-26 04:42:00,53,"I fished a couple days out of Ballards in 2018 and that has also been a driver for me to bring my wife up north. My thoughts after that experience was so many fish that were easy to catch. Six people in the boat limiting out in 1/2 day with old rods, dull hooks and crawlers. When we went out is was a parade of boats so pressure was intense for fish. Just have to think plenty of fish exist between totem and 45 minutes out. I fully understand the western excursion will take you out to less pressured areas, but still seems like that takes you right past fish that can be caught all along Long Bay. I also wonder if you cant head west through the slot and around to whitefish bay and catch fish or through the narrows. For me I am wondering jusy how good fishing is in Late July"
6304416,Figure-8,2019-03-26 07:31:00,111,"I have caught nice walleyes in sight of the resort so yes you can catch fish anywhere with some time and effort. Regardless of what your opinion is, and in the end it doesn't matter because its the law, one reason people make the run is because the fishing is so much better.....You can argue the reason and while fishing pressure may be less in the more remote areas I've also never seen nets that far out. Nets seem to show up closer to civilization. I think that is a factor regardless of how you feel. There's a reason I see the totem guides way out there (Golden Triangle - Chisholm island to Rope Island to Shammis island) , they could save a lot of fuel fishing closer to Totem and Yellow Girl but they make the run."
6304532,That Minnesota guy,2019-03-26 13:05:00,8293,I stayed at Tomahawk in Whitefish Bay a couple of years ago. All the Walleye guys ran to Yellow Girl. I didn't but I wasn't looking for Walleyes either.
6304718,Ver88,2019-03-26 20:22:00,114,"The reason the walleye fishing is good to the north and west of Sioux narrows is because the lake is much different. Whitefish bay is clear, cold, and deep. Long bay is less clear, less cold, and less deep. Sunset channel and north is stained and not as deep. That equals good walleye fishing in that part of the lake. That does not mean you can't catch a lot of walleyes in whitefish bay or long bay. I have had 100 fish days per boat in long bay and many 30 to 50 fish days in whitefish bay. Size is also much better in whitefish bay and fishing pressure for walleyes is almost non existent. Put in your time and you can catch walleyes all over the lake."
6304756,78dave,2019-03-27 04:39:00,53,"Guys, thanks a ton for your input. The run makes perfect sense to me. I would guess at day break it is a parade of boats heading that way west on Long Bay and west through Sioux Narrows all heading either to Yellow Girl or Whitefish. From what the maps show me the channel is deep through Long Bay and starts to tighten up around Whitefish Narrows. The channel is marked with buoys I see. Does that mean you can run pretty hard for most of the run west. If you follow the buoys you should be safe? That was my only concern. Otherwise slow down and learn the bottom and routes? Thank you all again"
6304758,That Minnesota guy,2019-03-27 05:47:00,8293,Things seemed marked pretty well to me but I always took it easy anyway. Last thing I wanted to do was lose the trip to a broken lower unit. Pretty fun to watch the locals run through stuff you would swear is only a couple of feet deep and all rock. Go & have fun.
6304764,Figure-8,2019-03-27 06:27:00,111,"While caution should always be exercised there are a lot of rental house boats so yes things are well marked. A good thing to remember is ""beware of yellow water"" and stay on the marked channel following your GPS. I also recommend you get very good maps, GPS is great until it quits. Depending on how you feel navigating on a system as large as LOTW I would recommend you hire a guide the first day, be upfront that you want to use your boat and have him show you some spots along with recording a trail you save. Ask him to please stay on the buoy routes, as mentioned the guys that know the lake take come crazy shortcuts because they know the lake. You can use this trail the rest of the week and venture a little further each day as you become more comfortable. I was at Tomahawk last year, in a week there were 2 lower units lost (not mine) by guests staying there so take your time."
6299282,78dave,2019-03-13 05:16:00,53,"Heading up to fish this area July 20 and bringing my 20' walleye boat. Just thought I would ask about tips like ""head west"" ""Yellow Bird Bay"" ""Deep"" ""Weeds"" anything to help my wife and I. Also would consider a local guide that is not a Totem guide. Finally, anyone want to PM me with advice and conversation? Many Thanks"
6299300,Golden Eagle,2019-03-13 07:26:00,2642,"Great Lodge. Great service. Great food. Be prepared for a long boat ride, every day. Walleyes will be on humps. Find a good one and be first the next morning. Get up early if you want to be first. Equip your boat with a strong electric motor and splash guards so you can hold your spot when there's good wave action. That's when fish will be eating."
6299348,eyeman_1,2019-03-13 10:00:00,690,"We will be staying at Totem's Wiley Point 6/29 - 7/7 and have been going there since 2000. Give me a PM if you want more info. If you want the better fishing, I'd say stay at Wiley Point. There is no long boat ride to fish. Either way you will really enjoy the service, the food and they will go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable."
6299586,78dave,2019-03-14 03:25:00,53,I am seeing that most have to head west out of long bay to Yellow bird. I also note that the guides out of totem don't go out until 8. So early I agree. I am thinking about bringing my 21' walleye boat from Missouri as it has all I need with a 150 outboard. Long trip at 900 miles. What ten miles out of the bay? I fish South Dakota and run 10 - 12 miles no problem. Not sure if speed limits exist though. Boat rental at Totem lists it at $415 for a full day. Not sure whats up with that
6299696,Wall-i-Lama,2019-03-14 10:01:00,1524,Sent a PM with some thoughts.
6300562,martinbns,2019-03-16 07:19:00,1520,"Totem's business model is guided. Wylie Point Lodge us smack in the middle of great walleye fishing, it's on the west side of the are south of the Barrier Islands, about a 10-12 mile ride from Sioux Narrows, but a beautiful ride. I run about the same distance virtually every weekend from Kenora and think nothing of it. Food is great at all the Totem lodges, accommodations are very nice. They also have a do it yourself island camp called french narrows I think that is somewhere near Wylie point. Personally I would call them, make a bring your own boat deal maybe with a guide for the first two days included."
6300930,Manitou,2019-03-17 08:50:00,125,"I know a guide.Haven't fished with him, bought his old boat.http://www.davebennettoutdoors.com/https://www.facebook.com/DaveBennettOutdoors/"
6302740,78dave,2019-03-22 04:51:00,53,"I really appreciate all your help. My wife and I only needed a one bedroom cabin and found Totem had three and we booked through VRBO. Part of our trip purpose is planning a family vacation for 2020 and I have a 4 year old grand daughter so a playground and beach are important. I get the idea that further west is better fishing, but it also isolates my wife and daughter from going to town, parks or other day trip if they don't fish. Totem offered us a deal on a 17.5 boat but made no sense to pay that much and leave my boat 1000 mile south. Two days rental and I cover all my gas and then some and have a good boat. So the price was right for a first trip and from there I grow."
6302754,martinbns,2019-03-22 05:49:00,1520,"You will have a great time, one of the things they offer at Wylie just so you know is a water taxi into Kenora. From Sioux Narrows it's about an hour drive, from Wylie about a 30 minute boat ride."
6303584,Redline,2019-03-24 11:44:00,73,You can stay at any of the Totem resorts for $150 a night and bring your own boat.
