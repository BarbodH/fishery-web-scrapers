I had a problem once when I crossed with my 15 year old son and my 75 year old father. Just wondering if there is less traffic at Ogdensburg.Walteye"
6343886,fishron,2019-07-25 05:01:00,317,There's less traffic at Ogdensburg because it's not the direct feed from interstate 81. The number of gates is less. Ogdensburg gives you a direct route to Ottawa and therefore Quebec. If your not fishing those areas it's out of the way. A crossing can be made from Cape Vincent where Lake Ontario begins. It involves two ferry rides and brings you into Kingston. The crossing station is small but doesn't get a lot of traffic. Good Luck

We almost always go over the 1000 Island bridge One in a great many years we crossed at the Lewiston bridge but then you have to contend with Toronto traffic The wait is normally not too bad.
