6344374,oldlund,2019-07-26 12:36:00,209,Next year I may do a week in June on an off grid island in mid lake of the Woods. Looks great but main issue might be gas. Does anyone know if lodges on LOTW will let non guests purchase gas? There seem to be a lot of island cabins. Looks like Witch Bay in reasonable range to the place we might stay. I know I could call around but curious if others have done this or recommend a system of hauling in 50 gallons beyond 10 5 gallon tanks? Probably dumb questions!Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk Pro

In case we were running low, we found the camp we left the vehicles at would sell us gas, sometimes we rented a boat from them, and found others on the lake we could purchase from. You might just contact several lodges who are out on the water where you will be and ask. It is to their interest to offer supplies, as at a later time, they may get some of your cabin, etc business, at least that was what developed for us. Also,we managed to camp fairly close to where we fished, so we usually didn't burn up a whole bunch of gas. Camp owners, in most cases, reportedly don't make a ton of money off of gas, so again it probably is to their benefit to be friendly. On another related issue, not the subject in question, if one were truly almost out of enough gas to get back to the mainland, it would be considered unheard of to not sell enough to get back with.

6344566,MN_Moose,2019-07-27 08:19:00,964,I do know that Smith Camps on Bigstone bay and Northern Harbour on Portage Bay sell gas to islanders.
6344648,Obabikon,2019-07-27 11:53:00,2370,"I think you'll find that most camps do, but be prepared to pay. Remote gas is expensive. We sell gas when we can. The only people I don't gas up is boats from the KBI tournament. I don't want guys running 70 mph around our resort."
6344656,DeBo,2019-07-27 12:26:00,211,Amazing that people boat from Kenora to Morson for the KBI! Thatâ€™s a boat ride and a half
6344662,oldlund,2019-07-27 12:56:00,209,Thanks everyone. Very helpful. I don't mind paying whatever charged. They gotta haul it too. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk Pro
6344804,MikeMcC,2019-07-28 07:17:00,72,I'd check with Pipestone Point Resort. It might be closer than running all the way to Witch Bay. They were selling gas to a non resort boat when I was there a few weeks ago.
