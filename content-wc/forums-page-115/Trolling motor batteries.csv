6342762,eyecatcher1,2019-07-21 08:43:00,323,After replacing my deep cycle batteries every two years or so a friend told me to give Interstate batteries a try. Maybe between the batteries and having them on a charger whenever the boat isn't in use is why I get 8 or 9 years out of my batteries now.
6342784,x4flatfish,2019-07-21 10:37:00,319,Wondering what any of this has to do with Canada?
6342792,The tank,2019-07-21 11:48:00,340,He had to buy a battery in canada.
6342812,johnboat,2019-07-21 13:06:00,2014,"Me too. My on board charger said they were fully charged. After two days it was clear they were shot.We're you lucky enough to get in on the Canadian ""buy 2 for the price of 3"" battery sale as I was!?"
6342824,bigcreekdad,2019-07-21 14:22:00,74,"I left both batteries on my on board charger for 36 hours. The one battery is now charged, but not the other. Odd thing is....that is the newer of the two batteries (one year old). I'm now wondering if it is the onboard charger. It is a Cabelas Dual Pro 2, and likely 15+ years old. When I had the charger running, the indicator lights on the charger have two windows....only one was lit up. Wish I had the darn manual and can't find one online. Not going to be using the trolling motor for several weeks so I've got the time to pursue pretty much all possible causes. I'll report back."
6343536,h8go4s,2019-07-23 21:46:00,1673,Get a digital multimeter and check charge before and after charging. You should read over 13 volts after charging and after unplugging the charger should gradually settle at around 12.7 volts. Check water levels monthly.
6343540,Ltrain,2019-07-23 23:56:00,4145,"Best bet is to get a load tester, a battery can fully charge but still fail once a load is placed on them. Now i look at my batteries under load, much better indication of their health."
6343586,law57,2019-07-24 06:44:00,1147,"I would put a regular charger on the 'weak' battery to see if it will take a charge. If it does (take a charge), then the battery is good and the OB charger (or connection) is questionable. If it doesn't, then the battery is probably bad.It gives you a place to start."
6342620,bigcreekdad,2019-07-20 12:33:00,74,"Every year it seems i'm replacing one of the two batteries. Was just un Canada, and got less than half a days use (far from constant) on my last day. Just put a tester on the, and one is very low and the other about 2% charged. Should they drain equally?"
6342626,CI_Guy,2019-07-20 13:16:00,2118,"Your problem could be that you are replacing one battery instead of the pair. Everything that I have read about 2 batteries connected either parallel or in series is they should be replaced as a pair. The same age, size and specs."
6342628,andersaki,2019-07-20 13:29:00,1426,"Could be, but I've added a battery in year 2 in a set to change to 36 volt with no ill effects. Other causes to consider, are the batteries run down below 50% and are they sized properly for their intended use? Are they charged soon after discharge or sometime after? Is the proper water level maintained. Is the charger working properly and does it have a maintenance mode? The answer probably lies somewhere within these questions. Good luck. andersaki"
6342632,GBS,2019-07-20 13:55:00,2271,"I'd wager they are being run down too low. Rule of thumb is to never discharge below 50%. There are a lot of factors that go into using a meter to decide how much juice they have left, meaning that the readings may not be very accurate at all - so the one at 2% is very likely completely discharged - which can ruin a battery even if only done just once. How many days did you run them before that last day that you only got 1/2 day out of? How long on previous days were they on a charger? Are you routinely running them down to low/very low levels before charging?"
6342654,bigcreekdad,2019-07-20 16:11:00,74,"I don't think I'm running them too low. I plug the onboard charger in every night after use, but I never check how much ""juice"" they have. Only did it this time was to see what each one showed."
6342656,oldlund,2019-07-20 16:17:00,209,"My batteries went bad in Canada last year. Made a combination of dumb mistakes. New boat, plugged in every time I hit the dock. Dumb mistake #1- the i-Pilot remote kept saying full charge, till they died. I was looking at charge of remote battery, not the big batteries, which just flashes for a second. Second dumb mistake- the outlet I was plugging into had the safety switch tripped so I was getting no juice the entire time. Completely ruined my last day. The batteries were so low the onboard wouldn't charge them. Got a charger at home and revived them, but to the others points, batteries have sucked ever since. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk Pro"
6342660,Hot Runr Guy,2019-07-20 16:28:00,16061,"What are you using to check them with, that shows a 2% charge?HRG"
6342706,law57,2019-07-20 20:34:00,1147,Years ago we were told that deep cycle batteries were made to be fully discharged without harm. Did that change over time?
6342732,tv4fish,2019-07-21 05:33:00,2694,Here is one view on our deep cycle batteries:https://www.discountmarinebatteries....cycle-battery/
6342734,The tank,2019-07-21 05:34:00,340,I run mine down to almost nothing all the time. I'll go 2 days without charging them to run them down. I just replaced mine at 7 years old and they was fine but I wasnt trusting them no longer. I would check out your charger something doesn't seem right.
