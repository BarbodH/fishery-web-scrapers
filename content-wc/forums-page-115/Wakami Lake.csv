Just using one of their rental boats, no trolling motor or fishfinder so I'm a little worried about keeping her engaged and wanting to stay on the water all week. I've picked up some good general tips from other threads, just hoping that some of you may have specific info for this lake in particular. Cheers"

The kids love to look at the finder and see fish- keeps them motivated. It also helps them learn and of course helps you. I'm sorry I don't know the lake, but the key is getting advice at camp to hit the most likely hot spots. Once you've caught a few, have fun taking turns in selecting the next fishing spot. My experience in bringing the kids is it's best when we can engage them in the whole process. I hope you have a great trip."
