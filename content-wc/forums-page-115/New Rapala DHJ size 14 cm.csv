However, none of the stores here in Madison, WI are carrying them as far as I know. The Rapala website says available ""August 2019,"" although one of the bait stores here said that they were planning to get them in either the last week of July or the first week of August. I'm wondering if anybody can recommend some good bait and tackle stores along the way to International Falls if they're not in stock yet here in Madison by the time we leave. Thanks in advance for any suggestions! ""Jackpot"" John Schroeder"
6342514,kettyspanky,2019-07-20 03:27:00,271,Just wondering if you could order them on-line. Sounds like a good bait to try. I know there are a few bait shops in Duluth and superior.

I ended up finding a seller on Ebay, who is shipping me 3 of the purpledescent, and they should be here within a week, so I'll have them on time. In terms of the deep tail dancer, I was aware of the TDD-9, which dives to 20, and the TDD-11, which dives to 30, but I had not heard of any other size. If they have one that dives to 40, that might be a good lake trout bait (I wouldn't want to use it for walleyes though, because it might lead to barotrauma to pull walleyes up from that depth - 30 feet is the deepest I ever run when trolling for walleyes).
