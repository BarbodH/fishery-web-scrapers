My oldest is about 5 and I'm going to wait one more year before he goes. That said, I'll do an early June trip with the fella's and a mid/late Sept with the six year old and some family. I know the leaves, bugs, etc... But I'm curious on the actual fishing? Fishing alone. I'd assume all species start to move towards the shallows again similar to spring when most species are in the shallows. Which time of year do you prefer?"
6342890,bigcreekdad,2019-07-21 19:21:00,74,"Just my opinion, but I would be leery of taking a 6 year old on a late September trip. Late September's weather can include some nasty cold (and maybe wet) periods. This can put a damper on a young lad pretty quickly. Also, while I love Ontario in September, I have found the fishing numbers to be less, but average size better. An earlier trip may have bugs, but you can protect yourself from them. I also find numbers of fish much better. Finally, bored kids can always go swimming....not so for the most part in late September. Just my 2 cents."
6342910,Obabikon,2019-07-21 20:21:00,2370,"Personally.... a 6 year old should be a summer trip (July). Early June can rain the entire time, and September can be cold. But... early might be best."
6342916,BornToFish,2019-07-21 20:28:00,1224,"Greetings, My favorite time of the season to fish in NW Ontario is mid-September. The fish are stacked on the rock humps. The biggest predators have the feed-bag on. Nearly all of my personal bests were caught in September. The weather can be the best of the best, or the worst of the worse, and you can have both in the same day. Personally, I would take a youngster earlier in the season. There is always a bite going on somewhere that involves action - perch, bass or small northern pike. It should be somewhat easier to keep a child engaged when there is action and something is biting. The walleye game in September is vertical. I suspect most youngsters would quickly be bored. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6342938,LoDo,2019-07-21 21:42:00,721,"Great responses! You're right with the youngster and going in early June, July. He's currently five and not going this year. We'll see where we are next season. I'm headed up the last week of Aug and early Sept. I've certainly had success with both seasons. I enjoy early June for the bite and numbers, but also because its a great trip to get your summer started. I've also had great success with late summer too. If you find a hole they're stacked and they'll sit there all day. My six year old wont want to sit in the rain and catch fish, but for me, thats been some of the best fishing. We'll have some family up there, that'll prefer to sit in the cabin while some of the hardcore guys fish."
6342962,Hook_settr,2019-07-22 04:28:00,127,"In my experience, I would highly recommend early June for the youngster. I have been early June multiple times and the weather and fishing was great each time. Like Obabikon said- there is always a bite going on be it walleye, pike, smallmouth, perch, etc. We went last week of September last year for the first time. Now granted, it was only one instance of late September but we earned our man cards that week. Highs in the 40’s-50’s, 15+ mph winds and wet everyday. Even snowed on us the last day. We caught plenty of Walleye and had a good time but not a good time to take a beginner in my opinion.Not sure what to expect but due to scheduling conflicts we are going up the last week of August this year. Best of luck with whatever you decide!"
