6343846,valley366,2019-07-24 20:17:00,193,You may find your requirements challenging. The bulk of resorts will only do full weeks in June.That said I would check out Clark's Resorts. Their drive to resorts have the other amenities you are looking for.Good luck.

6344068,prov1900,2019-07-25 11:44:00,544,"We did it with decent sized boats. 1st time it was about 40 minutes because navigation was tricky (for me), but after that and after marking a permanent trail, it was more like 30. I wasn't ever at WOT. Worth the trip but oddly enough, the water clarity didn't seem that much different than WFB. We did however catch a limit of nice walleyes rather quickly, then resumed shore casting for smallies.Yellow Girl is really cool, as far as scenery, fishing, and the whole adventure of it all, etc but watch yourself there. There are some reefs that aren't marked that had a lot of silver on them. Stay on the ""safe nav"" line and creep into the shore for your fishing."
6344096,The tank,2019-07-25 12:59:00,340,Thanks. We stay in milesbay but I've said for the last 2 years I was going up in yellow girl. Maybe I can stay a little closer and get there.
