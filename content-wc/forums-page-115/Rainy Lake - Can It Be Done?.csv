5685362,DaBirdman,2017-07-26 12:51:00,164,"Each year we vacation to LaBelle's Birch Point Camp in Northwest Bay of Rainy Lake. And each year my wife picks a spot far from camp to where she wants a boat ride. This year we went to the east end of McDonald Inlet. Next time, she wants to boat to Fort Francis. Most specifically, she wants to boat all the way to where you can see the Harbourage Restaurant. So I'm wondering if this can be done? Looking at the map chip on my hand held GPS, it is possible to get there. However, the best route appears to cross back and forth over the US/Canada border line. Especially in the area of Rainier where it bottlenecks between points. What sort of difficulties may we run into weaving across the border? Would we need special paperwork or is having our passports, fishing licenses and outdoors cards sufficient? Would be fun to make this kind of trip, but if it's too much trouble to go that far, then we'd stop short of having to cross the line. Thanks!"

5687274,Blackmacs,2017-07-27 11:39:00,2121,It can be done. It's about 30 miles or so. There's a dock at Rainy Lake Sports which is next door if you want to stop for dinner too. As long as you're in the navigation channel you'll be fine crossing the border. You may want to be on the Canadian side across Sand Bay though.
5687330,law57,2017-07-27 12:10:00,1147,That sounds like a gas! I think my boat may be a little small for that kind of trip But it does sound like an adventure. When you went into McDonald Inlet - did you go far enough to cross under Hwy 502? I have thought of trying to get into NorthEast Bay from 502. There has to be good fishing around the three islands at the west end of NorthEast Bay. Have a safe trip!
5687826,DaBirdman,2017-07-27 16:33:00,164,"Blackmacs -Ya Sand Bay we would definitely stay on the Canada side, but when you get to the two pinch points at the end of Main Street in Rainer and the next one just west of that, it appears we'd have to cross the border line to get through those areas. I'll make a call to the customs/border crossing office to see what they say as well. Thanks for the feedback though! And yes, it's about 30 miles each way. Law57 -We went as far east as we could in McDonald inlet until we reached what I believe is a portage that takes you into Black Sturgeon Bay. We couldn't go any further with our boat I don't think, but I didn't investigate it thoroughly. We came back out and fished some deep reefs in Northeast Bay and it was real good fishing. Just idled around one reef and didn't see much on my locator. Motored over to another 2 adjacent deep reefs, idled around and saw fish all over them. Caught lots of eyes and didn't have to search elsewhere. But there are tons of other spots that I'm certain hold lots of fish as well! Oh, and in my 18.5ft boat with 150 Yam 4-stroke, we burned around 12-15 gallons round trip (50 miles +/-)."

5689394,Blackmacs,2017-07-28 12:05:00,2121,"There are spots in the Brule Narrows and in the American channel to Kettle Falls where you have to cross the border also. Like I said, as long as you're in the navigation channel you are fine."
5690594,Baseline,2017-07-29 06:15:00,3207,My understanding is when boating on border waters if you don't step on land you can navigate in US or Canadian waters. If you have a question call the Canadian border station at Fort Francis.
6344888,DaBirdman,2019-07-28 14:02:00,164,"So when traveling south towards Fort Frances by boat you first have to go under Highway 11, then further south you cross under the railroad. These are a few ""dumb"" questions, but I've never been through there and I need to ask. So first question... is there only one spot to cross under Highway 11? And secondly....when crossing under the railroad, do you cross on the east or west side of the island? Plus, when crossing under the railroad, you don't have to wait for any bridge to lift do you?"
