6343228,Mike Borger,2019-07-22 17:18:00,1554,"Yes, my trip to Kistigan Lake with Elk Island Lodge in Manitoba last month was pretty incredible!To be precise, my son Brendan and I boated 47 pike 40"" or bigger and the other two members of my group who mostly fished walleye caught six.The largest pike was a hair over 44 and we caught 3 that size. Most of the big pike were in that 40-42 inch range, no real ""super tankers"" but we weren't complaining. We also caught at least 80 pike in the 35-39"" class and a virtual army of hundreds and hundreds of smaller ones.Walleye fishing when we targeted them was spectacular. Large numbers of above average sized fish in the 22-25 inch range with a bunch even larger.We didn't have a drop of rain the entire week which frankly was amazing. Water temps were 65-68 and the fish were hyper aggressive chasing hardware like crazy. The vast majority of our pike were caught casting two spoons. The Doctor spoon and the Mepps Syclops.Overall it was amazing and was easily the best fishing I've ever experienced for big pike despite the lack of true giants.Now the bad.The cabin was a little rough. The screen porch had no door which sucked as the mosquitos were brutal in the evening. The cabin has one common room with bunks on each side for sleeping, no separate bedrooms. Perfectly fine for us, but if anyone snored loudly it would be tough.We knew prior to the trip from previous guests that there were large cracks inside the cabin where both the bathroom and bedroom were separating from the main cabin allowing bugs to enter. I brought 3 cans of spray foam and sealed them so problem solved.We lost a half day right off the bat tying to solve the issue of motors that weren't running properly. Mine actually sputtered and died and couldn't be started period. Eventually we traced the issue to a bad barrel of gas which had clogged the fuel lines and fuel filters. It took a while but we eventually found spare gas lines and got the motors running again with (this time) better gas.Later in the week my son and I made a long run from camp early in the morning and ended up stranded when the flywheel on the motor broke. I couldn't get the nuts off the motor head to get at the fly wheel for an emergency start with a piece of rope so we were stuck. I messaged our host Greg Dick on my inReach device hoping he'd fly in and save us (he was slated to fly extra gas in anyway) but I was informed that the plane wasn't going to be available and that we'd have to paddle back to camp.No problem, except there was only one small paddle in the boat. I ended up making one with a tree branch with an empty Plano tray lashed to the end, and my boy and I paddled from 9:30 am until 10:30pm - just under 13 kilometers in total. We made it back to camp but I'm not going to lie, it was tough! Can tell you flat out my 12 year old son is a trooper. He paddled his heart out the entire time and never complained.There's much more to the story and if you'd care to read you can see it here:https://www.canadafishingguide.net/t...kistigan-lake/Suffice it to say, despite the motor issues and somewhat rough camp it was a truly incredible trip and I would go back in a heartbeat!! I think any hardcore angler who doesn't need 5 star accommodations would love this place. It's a very, very special lake!Cheers,Mike"
6343246,kona77,2019-07-22 18:53:00,236,"Mike- That was a catchy title to your latest report (53 gators over 40"").. Who wouldn't want to read your report.. Looks like an incredible adventure.. I did enjoy the modified paddle!! Twice we had motors die on fly-in's in Manitoba when we were on the other end of the lake. Makes for a long day and like you, we only had one paddle on one trip.. Also appreciated the equipment tips.. We started using lithium batteries this year..They do re-charge a lot faster and hold a charge longer than the regular lead batteries..Really like the PVC extension for the motor.. Great idea.. Thanks"
6343286,Mike Borger,2019-07-23 03:25:00,1554,"Glad you liked my paddle, clearly you can relate! The lithium batteries are amazing for sure. I was concerned about flying commercially with them, but thankfully it wasn't an issue. The tiller extension was a god send too. I first did that at the Edmund outpost a couple of years ago, but that time I scrounged around the old lodge and founda chunkof PVC pipe under one of the cabins. This time I brought my own along."
6343410,wmd,2019-07-23 12:08:00,388,Great video and article. I googled the transducer mount and it is Fishfindermounts. com. Thinh I will have to purchase one of those. wmd

6343714,bigcreekdad,2019-07-24 11:47:00,74,"Mike...as usual, great report! Sounds like an awesome fishery, but I must admit i would be a bit leary of going there given your mechanical/gas issues with the boats. I am very surprised that an upscale outfit like Elk Island Lodge did not have top shelf equipment at an outpost camp. Not to mention them telling you that you and your son needed to paddle 12 hours back to camp....and only one paddle at that. I'm likely not the only one who could never have done that. Thank God you guys made it safely. I was wondering if you tried a fly rod on the big pike."
6343742,Hoosier_25,2019-07-24 13:04:00,9,"Agreed on this. What if the customer wasn't in shape to paddle 12 hours? I consider myself in pretty good shape and ****, I'd have a very difficult time paddling for that length of time (especially with one MacGyver paddle. Or, God forbid, what a if a big storm hit. Great report though, some absolute beast of fish."
6343776,Mike Borger,2019-07-24 15:51:00,1554,"You're right, it is fishfindermounts.com! My bad. Pretty awesome regardless Quote: Originally Posted by martinbnsLove your stories Mike, your kid is really lucky. Thanks! Yeah he's lucky, but I am too. I'm really fortunate he's developed this passion for fishing, not every kid does. Quote: Originally Posted by bigcreekdadMike...as usual, great report!

Thank God you guys made it safely. I was wondering if you tried a fly rod on the big pike.That's why I talked openly about what happened to be honest. I realize it would have been difficult for many people. Heck it just about killed me LOL! But the fishery is really incredible and that overshadowed everything negative. I'm hopeful the deficiencies are rectified going forward.Quote: Originally Posted by Hoosier_25Agreed on this. What if the customer wasn't in shape to paddle 12 hours?

6343960,vteye3,2019-07-25 07:33:00,496,"Mike - I think you gave a lot of us a heads up on the additional equipment to bring on a remote outpost trip. Our group tends to minimize gear we would have on our own boats at home. A reminder to bring the extra wrenches an always be prepared to spend a night in the bush is valuable. Thank you PS Bad fuel, cabin with holes an dated motors, you are kind."
6344722,5 of Diamonds,2019-07-27 17:53:00,151,Nice review Mike! Very much enjoy reading/viewing your trip experiences. I'm also a subscriber to your site and would encourage anyone who hears the 'Calling' of bush fishing to subscribe. It's well worth it.
