Other provinces have many more stores and some have only government run shops. All have a government run online store though.Sent from my SM-A530W using Tapatalk

Recreational dope in Ontario becomes criminal possession dope in Minnesota. Tell the border guard at Pigeon River ""High"" when entering the US. Rydens carries munchies for the ""trip"" back home."

I am not joking, there you will be able to purchase not only marijuana, but several different types of hash, honey oil, vape pens of all kinds,as well as edibles.You will be blown away on your first visit, I guarantee you that."

6341926,acplumber,2019-07-18 05:20:00,80,Check any of the Indian reservations. I know in south western Ontario in Oneida there seems to be more pot shops then smoke shops
6341958,Obabikon,2019-07-18 07:47:00,2370,No sir... I wasn't even aware there was one in Kenora. Someone had said to me the closest was Winnipeg.
6342150,The tank,2019-07-18 17:40:00,340,I checked on line and in Ontario it looks like they're all on the eastern side. Closest it showed was north east of Detroit. Maybe that's considered south west?
6342200,martinbns,2019-07-18 19:24:00,1520,"Marijuana? Ontario has only Online sales at the moment, 9 stores in Winnipeg I think."
6342208,Guest,2019-07-18 19:45:00,0,"Thanks for the replies, Kinda shocks me that Fort Fran, or Kenora doesn't have a dispensary Soon I'm sure, stay tuned! Thanks again"
6342226,martinbns,2019-07-18 20:23:00,1520,"Previous Govt of Ontario wanted it sold in Government stores and they only had a plan for 40 for 14 million people. They were morons who got punted from office, then the new Conservative Govt not lead by the smartest guy in the world let municipalities decide if they wanted a store or not. This basically caused the province to miss the Oct legal date. I suspect it will be a while before either of those spots get a store."
6342278,northerneyes,2019-07-19 05:52:00,72,Guess I am out of touch with today. I thought the poster was looking for first aid stations. That's what happens when you get old.
6342336,adempsey2.0,2019-07-19 08:40:00,611,"If you go to the Ontario OCS website or the Manitoba LGCA website, it shows you where the legal stores are. Closest would be Sudbury, ON and Winnipeg MB.Sent from my SM-A530W using Tapatalk"
6342352,Carnhzkr,2019-07-19 08:55:00,964,That really surprises me. Go to Colorado and there's a dispensary on every corner. Sounds like a business opportunity. FF would be a ideal location being right on the border.
