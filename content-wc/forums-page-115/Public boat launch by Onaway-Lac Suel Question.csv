6342430,Aspencreek,2019-07-19 13:52:00,2911,Never been there but I think it is just past Fishermans Cove which is just past Onaway on the way to Ear Falls. It was some time ago but I heard that there was some vandalism and a vehicle or 2 broken into. If you are looking to launch you may be better off calling Onaway or Fishermans Cove and ask if you can launch there.

6342564,MOfish,2019-07-20 08:48:00,39,Thanks for the comments. I'll lock the doors and pray there's a parking spot!

There is one concrete ramp for backing a boat in, it is in good condition. There is no dock, but the shoreline is not rocky so you can beach the boat after unloading.There is not a lot of parking area, but have always found there to be enough. I have no fear in leaving a vehicle there, being vandalized is about as likely as being boarded by pirates out on the lake."
