6329854,NVM,2019-06-10 20:01:00,107,"My family and I (me, wife, and 2 young daughters) are heading up to the lotw for summer vacation this year in early July. We have a cabin booked for a few days on the lake but are going to be tent camping with the boat at caliper lake park for a few days as well. Does anybody know how the fishing is on caliper lake? Would like to try it in the morning or evening around doing other family vacation activities. Not picky on species - just mostly looking for something for the girls to catch. Read somewhere about it being a decent crappie lake so maybe catching some of them in the evening would be an option. Also is there a public ramp on lotw at Nestor falls - if so might try that as well. Also if anybody has any recommendations for any family activities to do in that area we would be grateful - we will do some hiking, swimming, and general sight seeing but if anybody knew of anything specific we would appreciate it. Also any restaurant recommendations would be appreciated. Thanks in advance for any info. My family and I are just a little excited! NVM"

The lake used to, and perhaps still does, have a reputation as being a very good crappie lake. Whether it has been netted ,or not, may be a factor in catching. The area is beautiful and you should enjoy your visit. Take some bug coils. Bill"
6330176,Baseline,2019-06-11 17:11:00,3207,"Caliper Lake is still a good crappie lake, but the bite is best in early June and then again in Sept. There are some walleyes, but you would get more action if you concentrated on northern pike. The Provincial Park is a very nice place to camp. I guess I don't have to tell you to bring your bug spray and screen tent. If it were me I would bypass Caliper and camp at Boreal Resort on Crow Lake. Crow is a beautiful lake full of smallmouth, pike, muskie and catchable lake trout."
6330230,NVM,2019-06-11 20:10:00,107,Thanks for the info Bill and Baseline. I will check out Crow - I have heard about it but figured the trout would be deep by July. Will be as prepared as we can be for the bugs. If anybody else has any thoughts we appreciate it.

Yes, the Red Pine campground at Caliper Lake is a great campground but Crow Lake is a much prettier lake. See Kevin at Boreal Bay for camping. Your daughters can catch smallmouth and rock bass (even off the docks). Yes the trout will be deep in July but the girls won't want to fish for lake trout as it will be boring to them. Boreal has a sand beach. Once you've been on Kakagi (Crow) you will want to go back. Rated as one of the most beautiful lakes in Canada. Crystal clear water, rock bluffs, majestic red pines, loons, eagles."
6330808,NVM,2019-06-13 11:13:00,107,Sounds like Crow is a place to check out. Thanks for the information.
6334286,NVM,2019-06-24 20:47:00,107,Thanks for the information on Crow Lake - I have a couple nights of camping reserved at Boreal Bay Lodge - sounds like a neat place. I hope to get the kids into some of those rock bass and smallmouth.
6334370,Baseline,2019-06-25 06:48:00,3207,Boreal is also a member of the Crow Lake Association. They have a private access to Stevens Bay on Lake of the woods. It is very short drive from camp. Good ramp and parking.
6344770,USDA1,2019-07-27 22:46:00,1,How did the trip go...? We are heading up 8/2 to Caliper. We used to run into some big crappies but have struggled there in the last few years.. We will also try Crow for a day for musky...
