6344838,Bill Krejca,2019-07-28 10:13:00,6107,"Yeah, back before the canal was plugged, the wind was the big factor. Interestingly enough, the direction the wind was blowing on the big part of the lake determined flow direction, not necessarily wind direction right near the Turtle Lake entrance. As at Obabikon, the flow would move in one direction, then as the wind slowed, the flow would stop for a bit, then the flow would go in the opposite direction, to level out, not unusual to have a flow hours after the wind stopped. At Turtle, theoretically, the flow would go north, but the wind was the determining factor. Bill"

If interested in voicing your opinion please read the following..The Future of the Turtle Portage Marine Railway System Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry Kenora District The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF), Kenora District, contacted stakeholders in September 2018 via mail-out, a newspaper ad and a sign posted at the Turtle Portage Marine Railway System located on the Aulneau Peninsula. These notices communicated to the public and Indigenous Communities the Ministry's intent to decommission the railway system. A numberof comments and concerns were expressed regarding the proposed decommissioning. In order to allow further public and stakeholder involvement, the MNRF has postponed the decision and is seeking additional input and potential options from the public, businesses and Indigenous Communities. MNRF is inviting you to attend our open house public information sessions that will include a presentation on the history of operations at Turtle Portage and the challenges associated with the maintenance and operation of this system. These are scheduled for the following dates:Morson Community Hall July 15, 2019 2:30-4:30 Immediately following the Lake of the Woods District Stewardship Association's Summer MeetingSioux Narrows Community Centre August 14, 2019 4:00-6:00 pm If you are unable to attend these sessions or require additional time to share your concerns, please contact us to arrange a meeting or send your written comments to: James Williams Integrated Resource Management Technical Specialist Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry Kenora District Office 808 Robertson Street P.O.

6342280,Bill Krejca,2019-07-19 06:06:00,6107,Should be interesting to see where this goes. Bill
6343654,FishinFreaks,2019-07-24 09:56:00,386,"If their proposal was to return Turtle Portage to its original state, which was a navigable area, it would be fine, actually better. The people who wanted this dam and rail system were the Whitefish Bay people who worried that the greener Sabaskong water would flow upstream into Whitefish Bay (AGAINST THE CURRENT) and ruin the clear water of Whitefish Bay. So if their proposal would be to turn it into the original navigable channel, I'm all for the de-comissioning."
6343724,1700SS,2019-07-24 12:23:00,104,Isn't the current south to north on LOTW?
6343838,martinbns,2019-07-24 20:09:00,1520,"Yes it is, same body of water flows from Rainy lake all the way into Lake Winnipeg"
6343842,FishinFreaks,2019-07-24 20:16:00,386,But not at Turtle Portage. It's flowing from Whitefish TO Sabaksong. Not sure if it would be considered an east to west flow or what.
6343968,Bill Krejca,2019-07-25 07:47:00,6107,"The original flow was dependent on which way the wind was blowing, it ran both ways. The reason for shutting off the flow was concern that the silt from Sabaskong would damage(by partially covering) the lake trout eggs after spawning. This was a stated concern before the canal was built in the early 1950's. Before the canal was built, there was a small stream at the original portage in the bay to the east (by the houses, formally Turtle Portage Camp). Normally, the flow was not enough to have a huge impact on trout spawning, 1950 being exception, when the current was mighty strong, due to a heavy rainy season. Bill"
6344002,FishinFreaks,2019-07-25 08:48:00,386,"Very interesting. That's different than I had been told, but you've got a lot more detail to what you're saying. I had only been told there was actual current there flowing north to south. So I may not have my story correct."
6344036,Bill Krejca,2019-07-25 10:31:00,6107,"My stay at Turtle Portage ran from 1939 (I was a year old) through around 1970, the camp was sold and it reverted to a private retreat, with the cabins being torn down and new construction was created. I have pictures of the canal being built, the spot was chosen due to there being a sort of frog pond in between the two bodies of water, which lessened the digging somewhat. Heavy machinery was brought in by barge and the canal was formed. There was some great fishing back then, the current produced by the wind made for very good walleye fishing. Whitefish did get more stained, it was super clear prior to the canal, so there appears to be some justification for the opposition. The camps on the road and up the lake favored the canal being built, as most serious walleye fishing was in the water south of the portage. Lots of stories.... Bill"
