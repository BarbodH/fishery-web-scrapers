As strange as it may sound we have done pretty well on walleye in much shallower water than we expected. We focused on deep water structure for the first few years with very little results. Then we figured out the shallow water thing and we have had some good numbers days, but tending to be on the smaller side. Smallmouth action can border on ridiculous! We are headed up August 9th and I’m looking forward to some good times."

Generally find active fish in the 14'-22' range depending on temp. You can't beat finding current for steady action. Not all lakes are created equal. Are you looking at one specifically? There's a lot of water between Wawa and Chapleau."
