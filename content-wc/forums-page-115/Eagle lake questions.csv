I did feel a bit out of place since we didn't have any body piercings or tattoos that were visible. You didn't destroy any of those Bad A$$ Baits by taking the slow death hooks off the spinners rigs and adding them to your ear jewelry collection....did ya ? Thanks for the jalape√±o beef sticks. It was a bit touch and go on the plane ride home after having a few to eat, but we made it without a huge bio incident . PjShorthorn"
6344766,dxgluuq5,2019-07-27 21:41:00,25,"Looking to head to Eagle Lake in October.Stayed at Andy Meyers 2 years ago and while it is a clean, nice place, you had to boat around 40 minutes minimum to get on decent eyes. Would like a lodge/cabin closer to decent eye fishing and or some of those monster smallies. I dont need 5 star accomadations, just simple and clean. Any thoughts? Appreciate it. Also, considering shortening the trip and fishing Vermillion but have never been."
6344768,The tank,2019-07-27 22:39:00,340,Shorten the trip and fish LOW out of Morson or Rainy lake on the west side.
6344772,dxgluuq5,2019-07-27 23:23:00,25,Thanks. Ill look into it.
6344780,prov1800,2019-07-28 04:29:00,5010,Check out North shore Lodge on the east end.Good fishing within sight of lodge if you like.Best end of the lake.Thats why AML travells there.
6345216,mixedbag,2019-07-29 11:02:00,76,"Ive stayed at several lodges on Eagle over the years and have settled on Temple Bay. I too will be there in late October, mainly Musky. Temple runs a fleet of Kingfisher boats, arguably best aluminums. Located in east Basin area, close to best walleye/musky waters."
6345224,Ricky Spanish,2019-07-29 11:26:00,1298,"Temple Bay for me, too."
6345226,pjshorthorn,2019-07-29 11:30:00,5654,"They will let anyone in. Heck, I was able to waltz right in looking for some dude that was big, burly and hairy looking. PjShorthorn"
6345246,Ricky Spanish,2019-07-29 12:42:00,1298,"Canadians are way too nice to refuse service to riff raff that really shouldn't be allowed indoors. Oh, and it was nice to meet you guys in person."
6345298,v-bay gord,2019-07-29 15:54:00,3168,"Actually you don't need to drive 40 minutes, but I love the fact that they do! On the other hand Temple Bay and North Shore would both be fine spots to consider..."
6345338,jkrawchu,2019-07-29 18:38:00,26,"I've never fished Eagle, but my family is staying at Blue Lake in Vermillion Bay and I'm thinking of taking my boat to fish for some Wallies. Eagle is nice and close, but I wouldn't have a clue where to begin when launching out of Vermillion Bay. I'm not looking for your spots, just some tips on where to start. Thanks in advance."
