567978,Mohleye,2007-08-01 09:09:00,368,"Gullyeye, Make sure you are comparing the rates apples to apples. The first rates listed on Wright's websites are for the upgraded boat package. Usually all the camps on Gullrock have similar rates. Wrights could be a bit higher due to everything the other posters have stated, but not a lot. Depending on when you're looking to book, availabilty may limit your choice of camps. Gullrock is a popular lake."
568002,Guest,2007-08-01 16:49:00,0,"There are no jet ski's, water ski's or tubing at Wrights camp. Maybe a little swimming off the docks if it is hot. Call Lee and he will tell you exactly that. I have been there every year since he took over the camp other than the first year he was there. His rates are very similar to everyone else on the lake."
568018,Guest,2007-08-01 22:37:00,0,I was there the first couple of years Wrights had the camp and decided to move on as I didn't like where the camp seemed to be heading as I visited camp many times when Mike had the camp. There were a couple of instances that either Lee or his wife took people around the camp pulling tubes and or skiers. That and a couple of other reasons is why we have moved on down the lake.
568162,Guest,2007-08-07 16:38:00,0,man you guys from Indiana are really bitter that lee asked YOU to move on because you were a bunch of a-holes
568170,Guest,2007-08-07 21:23:00,0,"I talked with Lee last year and he was super helpful. We stay at South Bay and we were looking for a place for our daughter and son-in-law. Sounds to me like he is in tune with the needs and wants of Gull Rock and will not do anything ""stupid"" to jeopardize his standing with other resort owners. Seems to me that you can't go wrong with any of the places on Gull Rock. Poplar Point may be a bit too far and ""rustic"" for most tastes, however."
568234,Guest,2007-08-09 23:19:00,0,"I would rather have to boat a little farther and stay in a ""rustic"" fishing resort than have boats pulling skiers and tubers around the camp."
568299,Guest,2007-08-12 19:55:00,0,"just got back from poplar point and it is by no means rustic. i wouldn't call clean, spacious cabins with bathrooms and showers 'rustic'. it seems to be the furthest from the main lake but it really isn't all that bad. the lake is not huge. they also have plenty of rental boat upgrades(40hp, locators, etc). its also probably the least expensive of all the camps and grant and bev are wonderful hosts."
568310,jwells185,2007-08-13 11:31:00,3,"My family and i have been going to wrights for around 10 years. before it was wrights it was weavers, Mike and Gerri made it a great place to grow up. i am now 22 years old, because of them i will continue to go there and take my kids along. over all it is a very nice camp, the best i have seen. very nice boats with brand new motors, nice comfy cabins. everyone there is very social and always willing to give a few pointers on where the fish are and what there bitting on. if your willing to spend a little more money wrights is the place to go. If you decide to go to wrights let me know when you plan on going maybe i'll see ya there. we normally go the last week in july and the first week in august for two weeks. this year the fishing was great, but then again it always great."
568311,jwells185,2007-08-13 11:35:00,3,no they are not adding jet ski's that is not what you go to canada for. if anyone were to add them to that lake it would ruin a great place
567958,Guest,2007-07-31 17:22:00,0,"Looking to book a camp on gullrock. have seen wrights, golden hook and five lakes. The most expensive by far is wrights camp, is there any reason for that like better equipment or location on the lake? Any help on these three camps would be great. Basically where would you go or have been and why?"
567962,Guest,2007-07-31 19:06:00,0,"We always stay at South Bay at Gull Rock. We have a camper and Mary has great sites up off the water (less bugs) and nice facilities. She does have 3 cabins but most are booked into perpetuity. You should call her, however, because she does get cancellations.http://www.southbaygullrock.com/ 807-727-2830 We have seen all the other resorts at Gull Rock but this is our pick."
567964,2746,2007-07-31 20:46:00,3206,We go to Five Lakes and like it. We take our own boats so can't speak to the equipment but the bigger boats with 40's look awfully nice. The cabins are clean furnished with bunk beds and kitchens well equipped. Good clean fish cleaning house and only a half mile off the road.....easy 10 minute trip into Red Lake for dinner etc. Everett works hard at making your stay enjoyable. We've not been to Wrights but have driven back there. Further off the road but new owners seem to be doing some extensive work on the camp. They have lots of repeat clients just like Five Lakes does.
567967,Guest,2007-07-31 22:52:00,0,"Wrights may cost a bit more, but I must say they are much more family friendly as they offer to pull you around on ski's or tubes and have heard they are going to add jetski's to their inventory. They also offer blueberry hunting if that is what you're looking for. They bring the Minnesota atmosphere up to Canada."
567968,Skylane,2007-08-01 05:08:00,101,"I thought most people go to Canada to miss that ""Minnesota atmosphere"". Jet ski's on a nice fishing lake just doesn't seem right. I suppose it is a matter of survival for that camp, but I bet the rest of the people on the lake cringe over that activity."
567970,Guest,2007-08-01 05:38:00,0,"there is also Poplar point camp,Anglers Paradise and golden hook camp on the gullrock system. I'm sure if you google their names you could get their web sites and contact information. All the camps on gullrock have good equipment and are clean and well maintained. Whichever camp you choose, you will have a great time on this lake."
567972,Guest,2007-08-01 06:54:00,0,You can't go wrong with any camp on Gullrock. Pick a camp close to where you want to fish and have fun.
567975,Guest,2007-08-01 08:03:00,0,Have been to wrights many times and when it was weavers. I know lee has even posted on here and he does not and will not have jet ski's at his place....period. If you have been there give him a call and see if he will hook you up for sept. I know if it a small group he may have a special for ya--he is good like that.
567976,Guest,2007-08-01 08:20:00,0,"The jet ski ""rumor' is just that........ask Lee. No jet ski's at Wrights......this is a fishing lake."
567977,Pezman38,2007-08-01 08:53:00,3196,"I will be leaving Tomorrow for Wrights camp. My family has been staying there for the last 20 years, when I first went with my dad it was Weavers. Lee does a great job catering to your needs, if you have a camper you can bring it and use his facilities. He has great camp boats although we bring our own, you can rent boats with 40hp now and I think he has two or three of those. Cabins are great, very clean and spacious, even with 6 guys. One cabin holds 12+ I think. The most important reason to stay at Wrights, Gull Rock is huge and can get rough, really rough. Doesn't matter at Wrights, you can stay on the river channel and hit Keg when the conditions are to bad. Often we experience the same or better fishing on Keg. One great benefit than staying at camps on Gull Rock."
