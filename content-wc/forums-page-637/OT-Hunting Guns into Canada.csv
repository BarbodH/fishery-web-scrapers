We are headed back to Sask. the middle of October, but we went late Oct. last year. Was wondering if the forms are still good since it will be less than a year since we were up there (won't have to refill forms and pay the money again?) Any info is appreciated."

A quick call should confirm. I remember Canadian customs specifically telling me to keep my paper work as it was good for a year and could be used reapeatedly during that time frame. good luck GF"
568393,Guest,2007-08-15 19:58:00,0,Pretty sure they changed it to 60 days and dropped to approx. $30. They want to keep us on our toes!! Good luck-Dennis
568398,Guest,2007-08-15 22:55:00,0,Just took a shotgun across this summer and permit was only good for 60 days. $25-30 was cost of permit.
568401,Guest,2007-08-16 07:04:00,0,Thanks for the info. Looks like we'll have to fill out the paperwork again and pay our money...oh well...well worth it for the experience!
568422,balsl6,2007-08-16 14:19:00,426,They are correct they are only good for 60 days now.
