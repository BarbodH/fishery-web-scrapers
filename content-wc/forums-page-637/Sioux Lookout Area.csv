568265,Guest,2007-08-10 22:23:00,0,"I am heading to Deception Bay in a week and a half with my 8th grade nephew and would appreciate any reports between now and then... specifically, the Deception Bay area, Manitou, and Sen Bay. When we were up there three weeks ago, Sen was slow... as was Chamberlain and Three Sisters areas. We put on a lot of miles and may have learned our lesson (at $5/gallon) that you can catch as many fish staying close to the landing as you can driving for an hour an a half to the ""prime spots"". Thanks, in advance, for any help."
