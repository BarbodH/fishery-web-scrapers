568278,cochzhd,2007-08-11 14:37:00,3,Heading to the east end of Cedar Lake next week. Any hotspots anywhere? Resort owner said walleye were a little slow because of the hot weather. Thanks
568300,Guest,2007-08-12 19:55:00,0,if youre staying on the east side of Cedar Lake you must be staying at Keystone Lodge...We go to Cedar Lake Lodge on the big island in June..not sure of the patterns this late in the season..but the people at Keystone are good and will point you in the right direction to get your walleyes..call or email them a few days before you head up there
