568298,Fish_on,2007-08-12 17:30:00,1856,"The little jars they come in do not seal well and you get oil all over your boat carpet from the drips and the leaky containers. You can't just throw them in a tackle box like you can a package of gulp, you have to keep them upright. It is just a lot of extra work iut seems to me, if a minnow drips water in your boat when you take it out of a container it is no big deal. These thing are slippery, oily and when you get it in your boat it attracts dirt like crazy. Plus you have to keep dipping them as the oil washes off fairly quickly. Maybe there's a better way but I just don't see people being willing to put up with the mess and hassle."
568302,Slimeball,2007-08-12 23:06:00,56,Thanks for the feedback. Maybe i'll try transfering to a better container.
568314,davenathe,2007-08-13 12:51:00,113,"Good feedback guys, I am going to stick with the gulp (non-alive) for now. Mike, reports still not available on-line, each time I click on reports it simply refreshes your home page and changes the visits counter by one. thanks"

568176,Guest,2007-08-08 08:46:00,0,Has anyone had success with the new Gulp Alive! ? How did it compare to the original Gulp? Is it worth the extra money?
568178,Guest,2007-08-08 10:41:00,0,"I was a gulp skeptic and actually preferred the original power bait products for most applications. I experimented with the new gulp Alive 4"" minnow this year and was surprised to be impressed. On a tough tough bite, live bait will beat it, but on most days it held it's own with live bait. We use them on jigs and on minnow harnesses with bottom bouncers. I still don't like the shape or action of the Alive grubs, but the minnow is a good product. Is it worth the price? I think guys will have to make that decision based on their own circumstances. If I was going to an outpost or to a lodge with limited or no access to live bait, I would absolutely buy some.

568184,freespoolin,2007-08-08 12:15:00,472,"I never had any success with the original Gulp. I've tried the new Gulp Alive in minnow style, I caught fish on it. It was equal to crawlers (same bottom bouncer weight, same rig). I didn't have live minnows or leeches to do a comparison."
568193,Guest,2007-08-08 15:48:00,0,"Up at the Old Post, it was without question phenomenal. We caught over 200 walleye in AN AFTERNOON, yes an afternoon. Used just one bag between 2 guys. I love. Also used it on Lake Erie during the jig bite. Good Stuff! Good Fishing!"
568213,davenathe,2007-08-09 07:20:00,113,"Mike, how come no fishing reports on your website, what is happening on Lac Seul. Love the two articles you have written on the lake!"
568237,ap2049,2007-08-10 05:07:00,65,I put my containers in a plastic sack sack because I heard they leak. Well I very carefull and they still leaked all over. I finally threw two container overboard. I think I do not use large enough hooks to get a good hook up with the gulp minnows or grubs. The night crawler was beating the gulp.

568270,Fish_on,2007-08-11 09:04:00,1856,It works but it is extremenly messy and a lot of extra work to deal with. It's even more work than keeping minnows alive IMHO. I don't see it being a factor for very long. Berkeley is big into gimmicks these days and this is one that won't last.
