568348,Guest,2007-08-14 10:38:00,0,Thanks. I have anextra prop just in case.

568350,Guest,2007-08-14 10:40:00,0,Been going to Canada for the last 16 years. We are going to a new camp and we can take our boats now.
568359,Guest,2007-08-14 13:00:00,0,"I have never had them look at the trailer. The only time anyone at the border looked in the boat was when a US agent checked it for alcohol when coming back into the states, of which we didn't have any."
568362,Guest,2007-08-14 14:56:00,0,"I've been taking my boat in for years and have never been asked for anything at all. In or out. unless I'm fishing a lake I know very well, I always carry a spare prop."
568367,ScottL,2007-08-14 18:43:00,733,">Not much to worry about. The law requires a piece of rubber >(inner tube) to go across your ""S"" hook. Can someone explain this a little better to me. We are heading into Ontario next week and I've never heard of this before. Regards, Scott Lee Since there is six times as much water as dry land on earth, any fool can plainly see the good Lord meant for man to fish six times as much as he works."
568317,Guest,2007-08-13 14:39:00,0,What rules apply to taking your boat over the border? I had heard that you have to have different hoook-ups for your safety chains. What paperwork do you have to show the Border guards? Thanks.
568319,Rat,2007-08-13 14:48:00,102,"Not much to worry about. The law requires a piece of rubber (inner tube) to go across your ""S"" hook. I would bring the whatever registration papers you have from your home state. The chances of needing either are slim. If this is your first trip get ready for a really good time."
568322,Guest,2007-08-13 16:00:00,0,I've pulled my boat accross for 10 years and never been questioned as far as paperwork. The safety chain holders are a good idea so I don't squawk about that. I purchased two of the hooks with the springloaded keeper and like that better than the piece of rubber.
568324,dave10,2007-08-13 16:44:00,342,"It's important to get the special proof of insurance cards (small yellow forms) from your insurance agent. Shouldn't cost you anything, and you will apparently need them if you're in an accident north of the border. Dave"
568328,Guest,2007-08-13 17:45:00,0,took my boat for a number of years and no one ever got out of their gate house to look to see what i had. My hooks are under tension anyway. have fun and watch out for the rocks. i put a pirahna synthetic prop on mine just it case and when i hit the rock I knew why I did it too. LOL
568332,FISH STICK,2007-08-13 18:18:00,135,Last week they didn't even look at my boat or trailer. Same advice as far as being careful. A guy in our camp lost the bottom half of a 200 opti last Sunday. Look for markers and follow your GPS and you won't have any trouble.
568334,rather-be-fishin,2007-08-13 18:38:00,429,"I've gone to Canada pulling my boat for 4 years....no problem at all with my boat. Just bring the gas your boat holds no extra gas. I always get the Canada insurance card to bring with. Coming back I have had to drive through the xray building on the US side. PS don't bring any driftwood back...it's illegal, didn't know that, but do now....just got a warning...get a good map of the lake your going to and have GPS and a chip of the lake your going to helps a lot too..and listen to the resort owners/guides on where to go and not go...have a great trip!!! My son's quote 1st time he went and he caught 2 walleye's 27 1/2 and 27 3/4"" within 15 minutes of wetting his line: ""the fish really are bigger in Canada""!! :) Rather-be-fishin :cheers:"
568345,Guest,2007-08-14 10:36:00,0,Thanks for the response. I thought that is all that was needed.
