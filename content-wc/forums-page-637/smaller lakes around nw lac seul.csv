But looking for more adventure I have heard that there are some lakes off of some logging trails that you can drop a small boat in lakes which the fish have never seen man or even lures. Are there such lakes and if so would they be close to Ear Falls area?
568099,Guest,2007-08-05 12:07:00,0,You could trailer over to Wenesaga and fish that for a day. Then you could trailer down to Hwy 804 and go west to below Manitou Rapids and fish Barnston Lake. There is a branch off that road going over to Camping Lake. I would check with local people about the condition of some of these ramps. I've been to some that you have to work to get the boat in the water.

There is a city boat dock in Ear falls and it is a short trip to the Dam from there. Fish the rocky area on the North side of the Dam and up as close as you can get to the bouys. BIG FISH are there."

However there are plenty of small lakes that you could put a canoe or small boat in that you will be the only boat on the lake. Others that haven't had any traffic for a number years exist as well. But finding your way into them will require savy and effort. Even finding your way into a lake, dosen't assure that the fish will jump into the boat. I've returned to a likely remote lake several times after having no luck, before locating a honey hole. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
