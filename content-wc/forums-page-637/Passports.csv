568222,NAV165,2007-08-09 13:00:00,412,You can still go through the renewal process when you return. As long as your passport is less than 5 years expired you may send it in for renewal. It will be less expensive and hopefully quicker.http://travel.state.gov/passport/get...renew_833.html
568225,Guest,2007-08-09 14:24:00,0,"You know I was already online at that page and when I called our local postal mistress, she said that if it was expired then we had to start from scratch. She had no answer when I brought up the fact that Passports are only given for 10 yrs (I think??) and they said I could renew if the current passport had been issued in the past 15 yrs. What do you believe? Any ""postal"" people out there in the know?? Just trying to save some time and bucks!!!"
568226,Guest,2007-08-09 14:47:00,0,"In a related question, what exactly is it with the true lack of common sense with the Canadian Custom agents? True questions asked: ""Are you importing this boat?"" ""What is your purpose in Canada?"" ""Will you be using this boat in Canadian Waters?"" ""Does your son have permission to be with you today?"" (was told that I would need notozied permisson from my wife to bring my son into Canada. I thought that was only for my girlfriend;)) This was at the crossing near Thunder Bay/MN border. Oh well....I still love fishing up there!"
568231,Nimstug,2007-08-09 20:42:00,2605,"While the purpose of the trip is obvious to me, and while the border guard may have a good idea why I am there, he has his job to do. I could be delivering my boat to a party I sold it to in Canada. I could be on my way to Alaska. While these scenarios may not be probable, they are possible. Because they generally look like us, dress like us, and most Canadians talk like us (except for those eh? and ""oot"" things :) ) sometimes I think we forget they are a whole separate country with their own laws, history and customs. So I don't mind a few minutes at the border answering questions with ""obvious"" questions in trade for a week of good fishing. Besides, I can't think of many other countries in the world I would want to share a 3000+ mile border with. I'll be there in about a month. Nimstug"
568238,Guest,2007-08-10 05:28:00,0,"Thats almost as funny as the questions I was asked a week ago when going into the United States... 1) Where do you THINK you would LIKE to go today? 2) What is the intention of crossing over to the place you think you would LIKE to go too today? 3) For what reason's should I allow you into the United States? Yes it did happen! and as I was driving away from the booth,, all I was thinking was you jerk-off.. Its 105* out, maybe you should take those black leather gloves off and stick them up......."
568243,Dacotah Eye,2007-08-10 07:45:00,2722,:exactly: When buying beer at the local grocery store I have to show them a photo ID and I was born in 1943. A few questions while crossing the border would be nothing unusual.lol
568316,Guest,2007-08-13 14:19:00,0,"Hey Billfish; Interesting about the passports. My question is this. What are the canadien rules about bringing in a fishing boat? Do we have to have special hook-ups for our trailer safety chains? What about registration papers? Do they check them? Thanks, Bob Shomaker[email protected]"
568199,Guest,2007-08-08 18:40:00,0,Going to cross in sept. Do we need passports? Thanks.
568201,Jimmy Jig,2007-08-08 19:06:00,1905,"No, not if your driving."
568203,Guest,2007-08-08 19:28:00,0,"So, if I am understanding this correctly......we can drive into and out of Canada without a passport as long as we have a picture ID and a birth certificate??? Could someone please confirm this? Our passports will expire while we are in Canada (Aug 24-Sept 15) and rather than go thru the process from the beginning we want to send in our renewal so therefore we will be without passports. Can also take the documentation that we re-applied, as well."
568205,Guest,2007-08-08 19:41:00,0,As for this Sept if your driving across the borders. You do not need a passport. Have a safe journey.
568206,Guest,2007-08-08 20:27:00,0,Thanks for the reply....I appreciate it! mike
568214,Guest,2007-08-09 07:55:00,0,They would be needed if there was an emergency and you had to fly out. I do think that they did help to expidite coming back in though. They just looked at our passports and asked very few questions.
568215,stevensinks,2007-08-09 08:19:00,330,"For the first time, this year we had passports with us. Also for the first time this year we got checked at the border, in fact we got checked going both ways. We have never had passports before and never been checked before. Now I really dont think that getting checked had any thing to do with the passports. What I think it was is that this year I had a topper on my pickup. The topper has dark windows that they could not see into. I think that next year when I go up, when I pull into line I will open the windows so they can see in. On the other hand maybe I just look like a bad guy."
568217,lund115,2007-08-09 08:24:00,698,"I've gone onto the U.S government websites, and all specifically state, that if you are going by land to Canada or Mexico, you do NOT need a passport this year. You only need one if you are flying. 100% sure."
568219,Guest,2007-08-09 10:18:00,0,"Trapper...... Excellent point about an emergency fly out, which would of course suck, but then things happen. Will keep Passports and start from scratch when back.....thanks to everyone for helping me and checking government websites. Better to be safe than sorry. Mike"
568221,Mohleye,2007-08-09 12:45:00,368,"You also do not currently need one to fly, because they are so backed up. All you need is proof that you've applied for a passport."
