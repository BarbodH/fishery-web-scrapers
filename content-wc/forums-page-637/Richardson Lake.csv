568321,stevensinks,2007-08-13 15:53:00,330,I was with joeman. There were only 6 of us so there was more room to play with than there would have been had we had a larger group. They just put all of our stuff on the plane and took off. We were not charged any extra for the extra weight. They were very nice about it.
568327,joeman79,2007-08-13 17:28:00,417,"Ditto to what mb and Charlie said we had WAY to much stuff and they did not charge us extra. That plane was awesome and I had 150 lbs at least. If you read in their brouchure it says that if you have between 105-120 they will get it to you at no charge and I think as long as you don't go crazy they will get it on the plane with you. It is 105 degrees here I am ready to go back!!!! And this time I know I do not need 1/2 the crap I took before, was a good learning expierence. Phish did you see pics I posted of the ""Blue Walleye"" I put in photos? Pretty cool I think. You need to tell me and Stevens a lake to go to where we can catch a bunch of Northerns and walleyes in early August. That is really the only complaint I had about Richardson. Kids said next year I have to take them somewhere- (Alaska) okay by me but the next year I will be booking a trip somewhere in Ontario. Joe"
568341,phishfearme,2007-08-14 09:44:00,1242,"joe - yah, i saw your posted photos - pretty cool. were these 2 fish in the one photo dead for some time? you can really see the distinction in that photo - not as clear with the live fish. we've pretty much only seen the ""steeler's fan"" coloration - black and gold!! a thought on pike fishing in the dead of summer - you usually need to go deep - usually the deepest parts of the lakes - only snakes along shore lines - at least that's been our experience. at one lake we went to, the sounder kept showing indications in a 35ft hole - we thought they may be lakers or brooks - but finally caught one on a minnow and it was a deep green pike that felt like it just came out of the fridge. i don't think most pike fisherman will spend much time chasing pike in the summer and deep fishing is not nearly as much fun as casting the shallows - which i think is much more of a springtime approach. that said, it may be best to chase summer pike in a lake-with-river system. we fished springpole lake which is downstream from birch lake on the cromarty/birch river system in july and the only significant pike we got were in the river - the lake only produced hammer-handles. a deadfall or other cover in the river system almost always produced pike. just a thought. phish"
568344,joeman79,2007-08-14 10:18:00,417,"Yeah the pic of the 2 on the cleaning table had been dead and were kinda dry, but really showed difference. The one Dave is holding in my pictures you can really see the Blue color on my computer, but I should have had him hold the other color walleye side by side also. Either way they are neat lookin fish, the Blue ones. And I think your right on the pike, next time I want to go to a lake with some running water and try that approach for Pike in july and august. Joe"
568230,joeman79,2007-08-09 18:15:00,417,"Just got back from 5 days fishing on Richardson Lake with Northern Wilderness Outfitters. Being our first time going in August we did not know what to expect, except from all the advice and tips from all of you here on WC. Fishing for Walleye was good to excellent. And catching a ""Blue Walleye"" every other fish was really neat. They say they are extinct and maybe so. But there is definetely 2 color phases of fish in that lake. I am guessing our group of 6 caught well over 1000 walleye the biggest being 2- 25 1/2""s. But lots of 18-20's and guessing 20 over 22"". We had decent weather with 3 fronts moving through and having Northwest- winds-southeast- and south west all in same days. Rained a couple times for an hour or 2 and the skeeters were thick arund sundown. Caught nearly all fish on jig and crawler fishing 15-25 ft on mid lake humps and points off shore. Did backtroll some blades but was more fun on the jig. Tried Gulp Leeches and minnows and worked but nothing like crawlers. Northern Pike fishing oh how can I describe it? IT STUNK! and I suppose maybe if we knew what we were doing we would have done better. But we only caught like 4 fishing for walleye and a couple dozen fishing for them. Nothing over 30"" Flying in and out on that D/H Otter was awesome what a ship!!! 6 guys tons of gear. (way to much) Want to go again next year but not there. Want suggestions of what other lakes that NWO you all have fished or other outfitters that might have good northern fishing and walleye fishing. Would have preferred a little bigger boat and motor and 14ft Old Nadens and 6 hp yamaha. Kinda cramped. to narrow for me. thinking about Wabakimi-Granite- Lil Shab- or maybe Birch. Thing I did like was only having to drive as far as Ft Frances. Vs Red lake or Ear Falls. But if you want to catch a Blue Walleye this is a destination you should try. Joe"
568249,Guest,2007-08-10 11:13:00,0,"I would be interested in gaining more information about your experience on Richardson. Next year, I'd like to take my dad (80) and brother to that lake...what was the cabin like. Generally, we'd be more interested in walleye than northern...any particular spots you could map for me. The group I fish with include neighbor and his son and my two sons. We've fished Holly (twice), Carillon (twice)and, two days ago, got back from Lil Shab. The lake is beautiful, large, easy to navigate. Shab was fun, cabin very nice. We are trying to get back in about the same time, though fills up very quick."

568251,joeman79,2007-08-10 15:52:00,417,MB Would be more than glad to mark the map for you. Lake is small and easy to figure out. Not to many mid lake humps in main lake (West Arm) But found 6 great spots where we caught 90% of the fish. Cabin is decent 2 bedrooms sleeps 6 max comfortably. There are 3-14 ft boats and had another flipped upside down probably for in the event something happened to other boats. Lots of places to get out of wind and a couple incredible evening bite spots near cabin. Is a good walleye lake. I am very interested in going to Lil Shab and what kind of action and size fish did you guys catch etc? Email me at [email protected] with address and I will mail you copy of map. I am sure they could bring a cot in for your seventh person and you could fish 3 in one boat. Joe

568266,joeman79,2007-08-10 23:00:00,417,I just loaded 2 pics of the Blue Walleye we caught. Don't know how to get photo here but is in my photos on WC. If anyone cares to see. My buddy Dave is holding a great shot of the beautiful Blue colors. Joe
568271,Guest,2007-08-11 09:13:00,0,"i did try and email you this morning; computers are acting funny, so let me know if it went through."
568280,joeman79,2007-08-11 14:58:00,417,i got it and replied
568303,phishfearme,2007-08-13 05:57:00,1242,"joeman - thanks for the detailed report! flying from fort francis is VERY attrative and we've looked into a trip with NWO but was always concerned abit about their published overweight policy - 80lbs - which we would never make - sounds like you didn't make the weight either - what did they do for you? those otters can carry lots of weight. thanks, phish"
568309,Guest,2007-08-13 11:29:00,0,we have been to various lakes with NWO over the past couple of years. We have never been all that close to the 80lbs person. They do weigh everything before putting on the plane. I think we've been closer to the 130lbs. per person and not been charged extra...at least so far. They are very reasonable to work and fly with.
