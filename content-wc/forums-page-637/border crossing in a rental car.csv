568361,Guest,2007-08-14 14:28:00,0,Anybody ever cross into canada in a rental car? Any issues I should know about going in or coming back to U.S.?
568375,Guest,2007-08-14 21:24:00,0,we did it once when we had to leave our car up there for repairs. no problem just have the papers. although you might get a 3rd degree if they understand rental cars. we were from chicago and had a rental car that was from california. they could not understand it. oh they finally gave up and we went on.
568379,MoWalleyeguy,2007-08-15 07:26:00,409,I did it 2 different times and was not even a question. Its a fairly common thing and like the post before just have your paper work just in case.

568397,Guest,2007-08-15 22:17:00,0,"Thanks guys, I appreciate the feedback, for some reason I felt like a rental car would just raise a red flag, its funny that even though your doing nothing wrong, dealing with the border patrol will make you nervous!"
