568374,Guest,2007-08-14 21:20:00,0,"You asked for my top 3 reasons for going to Canada every year, well here they are: 1. When the phone rings....I know it's not for me! 2. It's the only time of the year when I can be alone with my brother, son, good friends etc. without worrying about getting home on time. 3. It's the only vacation I can take where my wife doesn't want to come along. Each of us have our own list of priorities. If catching fish were on the top, I would stay home and catch all the panfish I could here in Madison, but I can't beat the smell, sounds, sights, silence, scenery and fellowship this trip affords me. My batteries are recharged and count the days when I get to go back."
568444,2746,2007-08-17 09:24:00,3206,Gullrock on opening week was excellent with lots of numbers and size. Weather was crappy but fishing good. Back again first week in August and fishing was good for numbers but the larger fish more difficult to find and scattered on the flats (not unusual for August). Going to Lac Seul the first week in Sept. and are hoping to find good fishing. This will be our first time on Lac Seul so there will be a learning curve that we expect will slow us a bit on the first day or two. Hope to find the kind of fishing Lac Seul is known for but some of your experiences make it sound like it could be slower. Will be at Lac Seul Lodge with Dan McDonald and are looking forward to meeting him.

568188,Guest,2007-08-08 13:34:00,0,"On LOTW... at least on my side (north of Morson), the early year walleye have been bigger. I've seen more 28 inchers this year than I can remember. The quantity has been there too... I've seen a BUNCH of muskies too, and I really do think the slot limit on Northerns has helped a bunch. Lots in that 27.5-35 inch range. All in all... walleye, muskie, northern pike fishing is up Small Mouth bass fishing is about the same (lots of fun in June for catch and releasers) Crappie is drastically down due to the cold spring and cool/rainy june."
568190,wooglin,2007-08-08 13:51:00,371,"We fished the NW section of Lac Seul, as compared to the Hudson/Sioux Lookout side for the past 4 years. For us, it was better size, better numbers and the lake was down. PS, that is for walleye. Pike seemed to hit a lot less for us in that area, especially big ones..."
568202,Jimmy Jig,2007-08-08 19:09:00,1905,Fished out of Sioux Lookout on LS. Fishing was probably one of our best for size and numbers of walleyes. June26 - July 6. Water was high.
568218,cspierings,2007-08-09 08:26:00,230,"For us fishing in late May and Early June on the Ear Falls end (extremely low water) fishing was poor compared to years past. Size was OK numbers for walleye were low. We didn't chase pike they just showed up and the biggest was about 33"". The trip in mid July made us realize that as bad as we thought things were in May-June they were much worse. Pike was better but it should have since we actually fished for them. Never a real trophy fish but a few pushing 40 and quite a few between 33-38. Walleye was pathetic. Fish seemed scattered and very inconsistent with regard to size. The only fish we could get in decent numbers were 10-12""."
568283,Guest,2007-08-11 18:16:00,0,"Just got back from our yearly trip to the same place. We went two weeks earlier than normal due to our kids playing high school football and practice starts next week and they can't miss any. The walleye fishing was about normal for this lake, we caught fish each day trolling and jigging. We also caught a lot of bass and pike. The one thing that we struggled with was perch. We usually can get a bunch of them each day for meals and to bring a nice pack of fillets home. The weeds were different than other years, could be that we were on the lake earlier."
568343,Guest,2007-08-14 09:47:00,0,"Thanks for the responses, I am leaving Aug 24 for my annual trip."
568357,Guest,2007-08-14 12:18:00,0,"On my 2 trips this year to Lac Seul, I found the fishing to be well below my normal standards as far as size and numbers. The lake level was normal to a bit higher, but the wind was either blowing hard with big waves or glass calm. Fish seemed to be scattered or in smaller schools and hard to locate. We would catch a few here and there and then shut down to nothing. After 8 years of fishing the same waters I have plenty of different spots that have produced in the past but not this year. I really believe changing tactics, baits, techniques put me to the test this year and the fish came out the winner. But that is why it is called ""Fishing"" not ""catching"". I have had years when all you had to do was get the bait in the water and you would be successful, this year was definately different. But would I consider not going back? NO WAY, catching fish is 4th on the priority list for my trip to Canada and Lac Seul."
568365,Guest,2007-08-14 18:01:00,0,"I agree with Steve, while we caught fish on LS, we had to work for them. Other years we pretty much dropped a jig near a island/reef and the walleyes were biting even at noon(sometimes better than dawn or dusk). BTW Steve, what are your top 3 reasons for going to Canada? I don't think I'd travel 750 miles 1 way to play cards/visit with friends and the scenery seems like and endless wilderness of rock, swamp, and trees IMHO. I actually think northern WI/MN/MI have better scenery although the fishing on LS can't be beat. Again, just my opinion."
568373,Guest,2007-08-14 19:49:00,0,"if you read the silver water wheel fishing reports, you will see that this has been a horrible year. looks like the drought broke with the opener and they had nonstop rain and bad weather, then about 3 weeks of horrible heat. looks like it's finally moderating. weather is really the most meaningful factor in determining what kind of week you'll have on lac seul."
