568305,freespoolin,2007-08-13 08:23:00,472,I haven't seen it first hand but I've been told that Manitoba Hydro is spilling water at Pine Falls and plans to continue to spill water through the Fall. The Winnipeg River System has lots of water flowing through all the dams. Current flow= better fishing. There was no current last Fall and the fishing was poor.
568308,Guest,2007-08-13 11:17:00,0,It is way too early but that doesnt stop the rest of us from dreaming about greenbacks all summer long. This website gives the flows from different dams and rivers in the area. http://www.gov.mb.ca/waterstewardshi...007-07-26.html
