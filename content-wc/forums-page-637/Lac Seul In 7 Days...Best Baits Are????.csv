We are heading to Lost Island Lodge on August 17th and had a few questions we need help with. I have been to Canada before (Pipestone Chain) but never had a chance to fish a storied lake like Lac Seul. Can you guys tell me what type of baits to bring and what depths are hot right now there??? We are going to BAss Pro on the way up and was told to stock up on the GULP products...make sense or should I buy live bait at the camp? Looks like a 1st class place so we should have fun, but thought I would rely on you guys for some help. Thank you in advance for the info my son and I appreciate it greatly!!!"

Personally I hate Gulp alive and threw 60 dollars worth of gulp alive that was leaking all over into the lake.

568276,FISH STICK,2007-08-11 13:24:00,135,We just got back yesterday from a week long trip to Lac Seul. As I put in the other post we fished the South end for 2 days before going up to Ear Falls. Most of our fishing was around the Lost Island portion. We didn't get in until about 2:00 on Saturday and fished for about 5 hours landing probably about 30-35 fish. Sunday morning we also fished for about 5 hours landing about the same amount of fish. Biggest was probably 21-22 inches there. All fish came on spinners and crawlers. That was my first time on that end of the lake and it is great area. Enjoy the water and don't believe a word either Shane or Sam tell you!!!:)
