567902,rather-be-fishin,2007-07-29 14:48:00,429,Crossed the border at Fort Frances on Sat. 7/21 at 10:30 AM waited about 1/2 hour... longer wait than normal for us but usally cross around 12-1pm Coming back to US at Fort Frances/Intl Falls on Sat. 7/28 got there about 10:30 to 11:00 AM 30 minute wait..... not bad didn't feel it was worth the extra time to drive to Rainy River crossing....heard if you get to the border Fort Frances to US around 1PM there has been a 2 hour wait last few weeks....
567943,Bearcat,2007-07-31 07:07:00,209,Thanks for the info. Just kinda curious what it will be like at noon on Sunday of Labor day weekend. Hopefully Monday will be the big travel day.
568239,Guest,2007-08-10 07:20:00,0,"I crossed the border on 08-03 at 1100 in the morning at Fort Frances. 2nd car in line. When we went in to pay duty on over beer, we were told to get our passports back out and were told to go thru the Immigration side of things. We waited over 45 minutes just for them to start us. We asked what was up and why the wait for us when other cars were flying through. We were told just to sit down. I again asked and was told that it was a random check and they are backed up so it will take a while. I was trying to be nice but was annoyed. THey had one girl working on the Immigration side and if they were backed up ( and the waiting area was full), why would they pull us in to sit all morning. We were hungry and were told we could order in pizza's. People were standing around doing nothing and the one girl at the computer was swamped. We asked why the people standing and doing nothing could not help, and they advised they were not allowed to. One guy got in a fight in college 12 years ago and was arrested and it was thrown out of court. They admitted that their computers showed no conviction. He got pulled in and kept in a small room and grilled about it for 10 minutes. We left after 1 hour 35 minutes of bullsh**. I would have hated to see what it would have been like if we were not all cops!!!!!!!! This brought the trip from being excited in crossing the border to a bunch of pissed off guys. 2 swear they will not go back. It was not just the wait, but the attitude. I agree that they need to check things but how about staffing your facility"

568307,Guest,2007-08-13 09:05:00,0,With you being a cop I would think you see that attitude alot. I work as a paramedic and I see it alot when cops are questioning people.
568315,Guest,2007-08-13 13:12:00,0,"My point is that the border was completely understaffed for what they were doing. When we finally left, the waiting room was still full of people. They thought we were joking when we told them how long it took us. One guy had a float plane to catch and was saying he would get charged extra for making the plane wait. Check me, strip search me, tear apart my car. I could care less and have nothing to hide, but do it in a timely fashion. If they are understaffed then bring in less people at a time. Passports also have barcodes that you can scan. I do not know why they were not using this simple technology. It would speed things up."
568323,Guest,2007-08-13 16:13:00,0,"Gee where have we seen that type of attitude in the US. I have heard of cops doing the same thing to people once in a while. Making them wait, giving them the run-around, not explaining the reason for the delay and such. Looks like an eye for a eye!!"
567694,Guest,2007-07-23 07:02:00,0,"To anyone who crossed into the US Saturday at Fort Frances, how long was the wait? We decided to cross at Rainy River, there was no line at all. Just trying to determine whether the extra drive time was worth it. Thanks."
567703,dave10,2007-07-23 09:40:00,342,"We crossed at about 8:30 am, and it was about a 30 minute back-up, snaking back a couple of blocks. Dave"
567709,Guest,2007-07-23 12:39:00,0,Anyone cross closer to noon?
567720,Guest,2007-07-23 18:32:00,0,Dont know if this will help but we crossed on a Saturday in the middle of June at about 10:30..the line was backed up to Tim Hortons and it took us two hours to get to the customs booth..one of our guys went back up this week with his wife and is going thru Rainy River to see if its faster for us next year
567731,Guest,2007-07-24 07:03:00,0,"Thanks. It was 49 miles further going that way vs coming up through Ft Frances/Dryden, but as I said, not one car in line at customs. One problem was the Duty Free store in Rainy River is closed Saturdays, so we couldn't get our GST refund. I thought it was fun just to try something different, and as I reported last year, we hit a Saturday at Ft Frances when they must have been having problems, as we waited in line 3 hours. I was ready to give it a try, and we probably will go home that way again."
567734,Seanik,2007-07-24 09:10:00,218,Just returned from a week at the Gouin Reservoir in Quebec. We stopped at the 1000 Islands duty free for the refund and was told the government quit giving the refund as of 3/31/07. This could be a provincial decision but is probably a Canadian Gov. ruling.
567739,Guest,2007-07-24 11:27:00,0,Crossed 7/21/07 at 11:50 AM. Drove right onto the bridge. Had about a 10 car back-up and a train tying things up a bit. Seemed like only a 10 minute wait. Best Staurday noon crossing we've had in over 20 trips.
567740,Bearcat,2007-07-24 11:39:00,209,Is there a website to check on crossing times at Fort Frances coming back into US? I found times going into Canada but not coming back to US via Fort Frances/INternational Falls. We are coming back to US on Sunday Sept 2 (labor day weekend) around noon.
567747,trapper_john,2007-07-24 13:22:00,83,Try this one...... http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/general/times/menu-e.html
567773,Bearcat,2007-07-25 12:16:00,209,Thanks Trapper John
