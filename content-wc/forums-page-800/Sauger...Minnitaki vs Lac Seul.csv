541680,Guest,2004-07-14 10:10:00,0,"On a recent trip to Minnitaki lake, my son caught a 16"" sauger. Just curious as to how often sauger are caught in the Minnitaki/Lac Seul area. Its the first one I've seen in 3 trips. Anyone that fishes both Lac Seul and Minnitaki have an opinion on how the lakes compare for numbers and size of fish (walleyes)? thanks"
541686,Guest,2004-07-14 12:17:00,0,We usually get one or two sauger every year in either lake. Got one this year in Minnitaki. My guess is that LacSeul has the most walleyes.
541688,Guest,2004-07-14 13:05:00,0,"How was fishing on minntaki? weather, water level, water temp all the scoop as I will be heading up there the 24th. THanks Terry IA"
541691,Toast,2004-07-14 14:25:00,25,Last time I was on Minitaki we cought a smaller sauger. How was the fishing? The last time I was on Minitaki we caught a bunch of nice fish
541698,Guest,2004-07-14 16:07:00,0,"Minnitaki has some sauger. Lac Seul has plenty of sauger. You could catch hundreds of them in a day in September fishing in 40-50', off main lake sand structures. Very irritating when you are looking for big 'eyes."
541700,Guest,2004-07-14 16:54:00,0,we usually catch 4-5 on lac seul in july. probably about 1-2%. i never fish deep like nwo bum though.
541716,Guest,2004-07-15 08:50:00,0,"Terry - I have a few tips for you when you head to Minnitaki lake on the 24th. Fishing was pretty good for us, but the fish were in transition so we caught more numbers this year versus size. The water level is up a few feet, but I can't tell you how it compares to ""normal"" as I've only been there in low water years. The fish were just starting to move to the main lake humps. I don't have GPS coordinates (if you have GPS - I may have a few coordinates) - I can describe the general area and be more specific when I'm at home tonight. As you go through the ""cut"" next to Burnt Island heading into the main lake from the pickerel arm, there is a serious of humps as you turn right and head towards the islands in the lake. There should be people fishing these (vertical jigging) - there are several of them in a line as you head towards the first island out into the main lake. I would also recommend the enlish river area - the water level is high and water is flowing heavy over the rapids in the english river. Just as you enter the english river, before the 'grass island' on your right, most people were vertical jigging the 14' break line on the left side. You need to find where the water goes from 5' to 14' or so and anchor there. Post your email address and I'll send you some more info."
541727,Guest,2004-07-15 18:32:00,0,Reference info on Minnitaki we fish the reef pretty hard out from the cut and have done very well over the years also the two bays lyons and the other ??. any info would be great also where did you stay? Thanks Terry
541748,Guest,2004-07-16 19:40:00,0,Terry = We stayed at Donnelly's in the pickerel arm. Send me an email at [email protected] and I can send you a few more details on places to try.
541777,Guest,2004-07-18 14:26:00,0,"We fished Minnitaki for three weeks, one week each in 02, 03 and 04, and caught our first sauger this year in May. Concerning Terry's post about doing well in Lyon's Bay, we go thru there on our way from our camp on Butterfly Lake to the main basin of Minnitaki. We have not done much in Lyons Bay, I think we have three walleyes there in three years. Did not catch a single walleye there this May. It would be useful to have some spots in Lyon's Bay for days when the main basin of Minnitaki is rough. I would be happy to share info about it, either here or individually at [email protected]. Yes Terry I also live in Iowa. Regards, RSH"
