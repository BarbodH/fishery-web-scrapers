541774,McQ,2004-07-18 10:34:00,615,"Had a wet trip, rained all three days up on the 49th parallel but the fishing was steady and my partner Paul ""Coot"" Williams from Oshkosh WI was a treat. This boy knows his walleye fishing. The lake bite was off but we managed some decent walleye in the rivers and a few bonus Northerns. Water was 63 degrees on the lake and 67 degrees in the river and every fish hooked put on a rod jerking display. The only effective rigging that consistently produced was to anchor and drop shot a #4 hook tipped with a leech or half a crawler in 6 -10 foot depths. Any area that had a feeder creek was full of fish. We managed only a couple of fish on trolled harnesses and couldn't stir up any on cranks - a really weird bite. Water levels were 5' above norm and we watched the beach in front of the cabin disaappear by the day. When we left on Friday morning the water was lapping on the bottom step of the porch. I'm already committed to go back in next year, this place has a mess of great structure and I want to experience the lake bite.http://www.wetetnagami.com Paul has all the pictures on his camera and will send me the file after he fishes the PWT out of Cleveland next week. I'll post some of them in my gallery then. There is a great story to tell about this trip with much fishing information that will help most of us with the finesse presentation Paul introduced me to. Stay tuned - it will be posted over the next few days. Met up with fellow WC member Atlanta Dave on Saturday here in Gatineau and his group is in at the Gouin. He promises a full report on his return."
