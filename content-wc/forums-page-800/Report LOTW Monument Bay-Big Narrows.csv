Fish recently moved out of weeds and on to the humps so those closest to weedy shoreline areas were best.Blue jigs with minnow or 4 inch ring worm plastics out performed any other color or leeches. Some walleye could still be found on shorelines with cabbage weeds. Best depth was 12-14 ft. Smallmouth were relating to wood/lay downs cloe to shore on inside weed line. 3 inch texas rigged Yum purple/brown Woolly Hawgs out produced all others. Look to shady side of islands and bays. Musky were active with several smaller fish found in small pocket bays, shallow rocks with pencil grass and rice. Bucktails and small jerk baits worked."
