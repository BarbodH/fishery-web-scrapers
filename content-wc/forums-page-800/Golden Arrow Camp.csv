541721,Guest,2004-07-15 12:32:00,0,Has any one ever fished out of this resort? If so what lake was the most productive for August walleyes? How about the walk in lakes are they worth while or should a guy concentrate on the main lakes? Thanks for the help
541722,Trailerguy,2004-07-15 13:30:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I fished out of Gold Arrow for 20+ years before I bought a cottage just up the road. They fish many diferent lakes, from right out the cabin door to very remote portages. Pickeral, Caribou, Fleet, Ord, and Girard are a few of the larger ones. Don is very good about passing on information on current hotspots, you won't be disapointed with the fishing."
541742,Guest,2004-07-16 11:42:00,0,"Trailerguy, I talked with Dons wife and she had said that because it is our first year with them that we would probably have to fish the lakes that the repeat guest didn't want to fish, which is fine, I didn't exspect to take anyone fishing spot. Could you tell me what lakes would be good for Walleye fishing that the other guys may not go too. On their walk in lakes or portages do you have to carry the motors in and if so how far is the walk,Don told me that these lakes only get fished 2-3 times a year. It doesnt bother me if we have to do extra work for some good fishing. Any information would be great. I been checking this resort out for 2 years but finally got the go ahead from the boss. I'm very exceited we leave in about three weeks. Thanks Jed"
541743,Trailerguy,2004-07-16 13:33:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]There are so many to choose from, even the lakes that are fished regularly have a number of spots. Typically you want to fish the side of the lake the waves are hitting shore on. The wind direction can change day to day. I always looked at the wind direction 1st thing in the morning, then the big map Don has on the counter, that shows you what lakes are likely to produce that day. You'll probably be looking for cabbage and mid lake humps in August, Fleet has a nice sunken island right in front of the launch site, it's usually a good spot to start. The eye's are likely to be on the downwind side of the island, they move a little deeper on bright days. If you're up to it, there's a nice portage to Smith Lake, you carry a motor about 100 yds., after going through Fingers and Flapjack lakes. Or motor into Caribou and take a 50 yd portage to Square lake. Don uses mostly 9.9 merc's, but he's got some 4 hp's that are alot lighter, he used to have a 2hp too. Some of the lakes are little used just because of the dificulty of getting to them down the old logging roads, a 4x4 helps there. I wouldn't worry about getting someone else's spot, There are plenty to go around, and it's helpful to know someone caught them there last week, and what they used."
541756,Guest,2004-07-17 08:36:00,0,"Trailerguy, thanks for all the information,puts a guy at ease to hear about the fishing, what do you think is the number one out of the way walleye lake? I would just as soon find a lake, work to get into it, fish find the good spots and then keep fishing it all week not having to worry that some other group will want to fish it. Half the reason that I picked this resort is I don't want to have to worry that some other boat is on the lake fighting for a fishing spot with me(I can stay home and see that all the time). If a guy would go to these out of the way lakes that you need a four wheel drive how beat up would the truck get? Not that I'm concerned but we still nees to drive home in that vehicle. All the insight that you gave me is great. Thanks Jed"
541759,Trailerguy,2004-07-17 13:48:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I don't think you need to worry about other boats. Don has 1 or 2 boats cached on a number of lakes, he'll help you pick which lake you want to go to that day and he writes it in a book, so he keeps track of who's where. He gives you a map of the roads and the lake, marked with spots to check for fish. Some of the roads have bushes growing in close so they touch the sides of the truck, and sometimes there's a washout or a rock to dodge, he normally wouldn't send a new guest to these. If you use your head the vehicle will be OK. Using Fleet as an example, the road is mostly 25-30 mph, its about 10 miles out and the last 150 feet to the boats you walk down a hill. He had 2 boats I think and another camp had 2 boats. I don't ever remember seeing another one in use unless we brought two partys. I'm guessing on average 1 boat gets used 3 days a week there. I really think you'd enjoy working a number of lakes rather than the sameone every day. It's hard to decide wether to fish were you caught fish yesterday or a new lake and new experiences for the day."
