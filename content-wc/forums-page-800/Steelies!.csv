When I come around Pelee Point and turn up towards Erieau there are usually a couple dozen boats fishing in the 55-60 ft range. If they are steelhead fishing I would stop and fish their as this would save me 35 miles to Erieau. Any help/info or if you could e-mail me [email protected] would be appreciated. Ron"

541713,Homer,2004-07-15 08:16:00,1127,"Downriverbob is correct, that is Wheatley. Late last July and early August, they had the hottest steelie fishing I had ever seen anywhere. It sounds like they haven't turned on yet this year, but it shouldn't be long now. The best message boards that contain Wheatley updates are the coldwater forum at http://www.michigan-sportsman.com and the fishing forum at http://www.basshavencanada.com You'll see a lot of reports at both places once the action heats up. Paul at Last Chance Tackle in Wheatley gives an honest and accurate report. His phone number is (519) 825-7560"

541717,Homer,2004-07-15 09:00:00,1127,"Been busy with work, but will take time off once the steelies show up at Wheatley. Will definitely be there Monday, Walleye Central's own ebijack will be presenting. See you there."
541718,downriverbob,2004-07-15 09:07:00,880,"I'll let you know if I will be going and save a couple of chairs, form what I seen on the Erieau Marina website they are getting steelie, walleye, and even kings in pretty close !!!!!!"
