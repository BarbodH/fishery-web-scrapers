541659,Pooch,2004-07-13 20:48:00,4619,Predicatable and stable as long as the weather is. Pooch
541669,Guest,2004-07-14 04:14:00,0,I have been going to lac seul in mid August for 8 years. Never had a bad fishing trip. The fishing is very predictable and the fish are just where you would think they would be. One big benefit...Fewer bugs and less rain.
541683,chester,2004-07-14 11:12:00,9,MikeinMo I will be heading up first week in Aug for first time. What depth and type of area do you look for.
541693,Guest,2004-07-14 14:44:00,0,We always do good fishing humps where ever you can find them. We also fish 30-50 deep to avoid smaller ones and take your time bring them up so that they get adjusted. After dinner we usaully troll crank baits 20-30 feet deep always get lots of 24in plus fish doing this.
541695,Guest,2004-07-14 15:01:00,0,"jrt, do you downrig to get your cranks down to that depth?"
541714,Guest,2004-07-15 08:28:00,0,Chester Last year 2 of us caught over 300 walleye. We trolled bottom bouncers with minnows. We try to stay in 12 to 20 ft of water around the islands and shoreline. At that time of year color doesn't seem to make any difference.
541725,chester,2004-07-15 14:34:00,9,WOW!! Thanks for the reply. I just cant wait to see the area and see what the fishing is like. We are familiar with spinner rigging so hopefully that gets us started.
541744,Guest,2004-07-16 14:38:00,0,No don't have downrigger just use alot of weight maybe some day I'll get downrigger.
