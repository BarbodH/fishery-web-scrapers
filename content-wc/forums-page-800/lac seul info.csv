541783,Guest,2004-07-18 17:43:00,0,"looking for some info on the area of the lake north of dryden, never fished this lake before. the area north of dryden looks to be in the central part of the lake.from reading previous posts spinners or lindy's and minnows or crawler is very productive. only fishing 3 days and am willing to travel many miles whatever it takes. a buddy of mine metioned sunrise bay,but said its on the east side of the lake. not looking for your hot spots just eliminating dead water. as the lake is huge. thanks"
