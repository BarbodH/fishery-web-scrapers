541685,Guest,2004-07-14 12:03:00,0,"I'm no crappie expert but since nobody else is responding....the best times for crappie on that area of LOTW are spring and in the fall. Hay Island, Thompson Creek area in Miles Bay and the elbow in Obabikon Lake are the best fall areas. They're generally pretty hard to find in quantities in August unless you know where the crappie cribs are that have been planted by locals, and the locations of those cribs are usually a well guarded secret. Maybe someone else can give you better help, but I'd stick with walleye, bass and muskie in August."
