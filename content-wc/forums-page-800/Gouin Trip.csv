Part of the charm is the french canadian people. These bush outfitters work hard to make the trip perfect, and to make you come back again. Having McQ help you out is just icing on the cake. He is a real asset to have on your side. Wish I was in your shoes right about now."

I've had one foot in the boat all week long, practically worthless at work, going over lists and details in my mind so we have everything we need. Ours is a Father and Sons trip....4 adults, 4 teenage boys. We are pumped! I'll chime in with a report as well on our return. Good luck!"
