541689,Guest,2004-07-14 14:06:00,0,Several of us are interested in fishing Lac Seul and we are considering the Silver Water Wheel lodge. Can anybody tell me how they liked it. Do they have good Guides?
541692,Guest,2004-07-14 14:41:00,0,"Excellent resort, guides, service, fishing knowledge. Food is wonderful as is the guide-prepared shore lunch. It is on the pricey side but they provide the fishing and service to back it up. If there are big fish to be had, SWWL will put you on them."
541709,Guest,2004-07-15 06:51:00,0,Thanks for the help. Our group will probably give them a shot. We are also looking at Lac Seul Outposts.
541729,Guest,2004-07-15 19:17:00,0,"I've been going to SWWL twice per year for 4-5 years. Out of all of those trips I've caught at a 29"" eye or larger except once. The owner of the resort guides on the water every day. I've never seen a resort owner so wild about walleyes, not just walleyes but big walleyes. Most resorts i've been to have small 1"" - 2"" minnows, he has them in a variety of 2""-5"" sizes. I really think that helps get bigger fish. Also no extra charges when its time to head home. This year we had a group of six from July 2- July 6th. We had twenty two 26"" eyes, seventeen 27"" eyes, four 28"" eyes, and seven 29"" to 29.75"". Its hard having fishing like that then coming home to so. MN trying to catch a 15""er. But we will be back in the fall. Give Mike a call Its a great resort."
