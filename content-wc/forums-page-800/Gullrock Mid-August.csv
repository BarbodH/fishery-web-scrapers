Staying at Five Lakes Lodge. Thanks, Craig ""I'm not a golfer, but I golf...I'm a fisherman, I don't fish"""
541755,Guest,2004-07-17 07:15:00,0,Bud the camp owner will give you a map with the last weeks hot spots and help with advice on what there hitting on. Gullrock is a very easy lake to fish. I've been going to 5 lakes for 10 years I think you'll like it.

If your there then we would be happy to tell you what we know and, of course, Bud will also be very helpful. Bringing your golf clubs? We usually do in August as the camp is only 10 min away from a very nice course in Red Lake the Bud's membership lets you play free....cart extra of course. Fishing in the morning, golf in the afternoon and fishing again in the evening is pretty hard to beat! Only problem is I'm getting to old to do that more than a couple days. You'll enjoy your trip!"
541762,Guest,2004-07-17 18:17:00,0,"Appreciate the words of support about the choice to go to Five Lakes and Gullrock...any recommendations on minnows vs crawlers vs leeches? How about depths? Need to use ""1+"" ounce bottom bouncers or are Lindy rigs the way to go? Just want to be as prepared as possible (old Boy Scout). Thanks, Craig"
541765,2746,2004-07-17 19:58:00,3206,"That time of year we use all three...minnows, leeches and nightcrawlers. I like the crawlers the best as I can use the 2 hook harness and can hook the fish better....some of our guys swear by leeches. We've had trouble some years finding them (bait shops are out) but usually can pick them up at Ear Falls. Fish will be from 15'- 20' deep on points and humps to 30'-35' deep in some cases. We use Lindy weights almost entirely (occasionally jigs) and 1 oz bottom bouncers only when we go deep. There will be others that use b bouncers totaly so guess it depends on your preference. Spinners in almost any color but the last two years we have had the best luck with 4 -6' snell and colored hook (no spinner) or a single colored bead. there are always a few slip bobber experts there in August that do very well once a school has been found....but that's not something I've experimented with much. A relatively easy lake to fish without a lot of required traveling."
541778,Guest,2004-07-18 15:18:00,0,Thanks for the info LarryM and for the questions Cough. I'm heading up for the first time 8/21 with my dad and had the same question regarding minnow vs. leeches vs. crawlers. Also wondering if there are any plastic guys and what color/presentations they suggest.
