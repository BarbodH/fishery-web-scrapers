During the week we'd like to head into town for a couple of meals. Does anyone have any recommendations for a restaurant and/or bar with good food? Would it be open in the evening? How are the grocery stores for last minute things? I see there is an IGA and at least one other store. I know there is at least one bait shop in Red Lake. If considering leeches or nightcrawlers, would that be a good source or are we better off picking those up further south at Ear Falls/Dryden/Vermillion Bay/Ft. Frances?"
541678,Guest,2004-07-14 09:23:00,0,Was there last week waiting for service to my buddies evi 225 HO which left us 17 miles out on Lac Seul. We were referred to 1 of 3 places to eat. It was supposedly the best? If I were you I would do all the cooking myself. That IGA did look big so you should be good for Groceries. I would pick up bait in Ear Falls as I again was not impressed with the shops in Red Lake. Just my 02 cents.
541679,Guest,2004-07-14 09:47:00,0,"I personally think that the IGA ia ok. We just buy eggs, milk, etc there, as we bring most from home. We never eat in town, but from what I understand the motel in Balmertown has excellent food. that is only a few miles away. I have had nothing but good luck with bail at the sporting good store, but again, I bring my own crawlers and normall yjust buy minnows the first day there. Be prepared it is expensive. I usually pass on the leeches."

541738,Pooch,2004-07-16 08:06:00,4619,"Downtown Red Lake has several places to eat. The ones we use several times a year are: ""The Lakefront"" just reopened this year. I heard that it is a B&B and I assume they still have the resturant. It is located next to the bay near Green's Flyout base. Right on the main street is the ""Lakeveiw Inn"". Always good. Sometimes pretty busy, especially on Friday nights. Then there is the ""Howey Bay"" motel just south of the marinas on the main highway into town. They have a bar and a resturant. I've only had breakfast there and it was good. There is also a Chinese place next to the Howey Bay motel. We haven't eaten there. Across the road from that is a Pizza Hut and KFC combination. These are the places that I'm familiar with. All are within a half mile walk from each other. We are not familiar with Balmertown and it's facilities. Pooch"
541740,Minnow Man,2004-07-16 08:21:00,85,"Several good restaurants in the area. I eat at the Lake View Restaurant it's none smoking and good food, enjoy the Sunday Breakfast brunch 7am-2pm. Howey Bay Motel & Red Lake Inn & Red Dog Inn all have restaurants with good food, but smoking is allowed so i don't go. New restaurant opened in Red Lake, The Northwoods Inn ( former Water Front Restaurant) The new owner must have spent over a million dollars on renovations, looks nice, have heard good thing about it but have not tried it. The Balmer Hotel has real good food , but we walked out of it last time there, couldn't see to the end of the restaurant because of the cigarette smoke. If you are a smoker you'll enjoy this place all the extra smoke is free. IGA in Red Lake can look after your grocery needs, also large grocery store in Balmertown, Edwards Foods might be bigger than IGA. Northern Sporting in Red lake is the only sporting goods store, George is always good to talk with and he'll give some tips on fishing hot spots. Enjoy your trip to Gullrock Lake. Fishing in Aug always produces lots of great fishing."
541779,Guest,2004-07-18 15:23:00,0,Thanks Pooch and MinnowMan. Glad to know there are a few places we can give a try for a meal or two. Sounds like there are more places than I originally expected.
