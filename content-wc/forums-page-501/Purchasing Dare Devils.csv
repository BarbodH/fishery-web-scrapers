1282203,camp chef,2011-03-14 11:40:00,915,How much can you possibly save? Find a local sport shop that takes care of their customers and buy some daredevils.The independant bait shops that are open long hours for your convenience need to make a profit too. I try do do my business so that my money stays local when I can.

Plus no ""mom and pop"" shops here in the Phoenix, AZ area or none that don't have all bass fishing stuff. The Eppinger site is very good and I might try to buy some in bulk but need more of my group to go in with me. Have tried Ebay but most times they are the off brand DD."
