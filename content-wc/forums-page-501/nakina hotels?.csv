1283067,corvette1,2011-03-16 13:14:00,243,i stayed at pennocks 5 times its ok for the middle of no where
1283201,515,2011-03-16 19:29:00,254,"Always stay at The Shore, nothing fancy but always clean and a good sleep. Big bonus is mostly fly in crews will be there so lots of chat outside over beers before calling it a night."
1259549,deputy dog,2011-01-04 12:48:00,305,"any info on lodging in nakina? need a hotel and not sure how many there are, how booked they get, any ones to stay away from, ect....thanks!"
1259703,Gavorlake,2011-01-04 20:31:00,33,"Stay in Geralton,hotels and resturants better,only 50 mins to nakina"
1259717,fishforlife,2011-01-04 21:39:00,77,"Deputy,Which air service are you using?"
1259747,deputy dog,2011-01-05 06:12:00,305,not sure who the carrier is but using eddienorth for the outfitter
1259751,onetimedave,2011-01-05 06:44:00,502,Look at randdapartments.ca.
1260241,Jack77,2011-01-07 15:26:00,168,The Shores Motel is somewhere to lay your head and only 5-10 minutes from Cordley Lake. It isn't going to win any awards but can take a shower and wake up only a few minutes from your airbase. I have flown out of Nakina 3 times and stayed there twice.
1260306,fishforlife,2011-01-08 00:26:00,77,"Deputy,You might want to check with Greg at Nakina Air sevice, as he has some cabins behind the Nakina Air Office if you are flying with him. Also, as mentioned above, Pennocks Shores Motel I have stayed at a few times."
1260358,SteveJ715,2011-01-08 09:57:00,59,"Deputy,We also have always stayed in Geraldton. There are two hotels in town that are bigger than the Shores in Nakina. However, I can't compare the quality since we've never stayed in Nakina. The last 10+ years we stayed at the Golden Nugget, which is further north than the Silver Nugget (both in Geraldton and both right on the main drag). The phone number that Google gives me for the Golden Nugget is: 807-854-0740. I can't remember what the rates were. We'd drive up to Nakina for breakfast. There's a pretty good little restaurant there that's open early, if you've got an early flight. I can't remember why we originally started staying in Geraldton vs. going all the way to Nakina (we drive up from Wisconsin). Might have just been because it was late and we were sick of driving. But after that first year or two, though, it became ""this is where we stay the night before we fly out"".-Steve"
1281503,pike hunter,2011-03-12 13:18:00,12,"we stayed in r and d apartments last year. they are 2 bedroom apartments with kitchen. lots of room for doing any last minute sorting and packing. freezer to keep the meat frozen. there were 3 of us, one slept on the couch. very comfortable. definately staying there again this year. i think it was around $100 for the night. just minutes from the airbase"
1282102,schandm,2011-03-14 07:21:00,18,Last year stayed at Shores in Nakina and they put us in one of their houses for the night. Very nice with kitchen and cable TV and PLENTY of room. We also went to Eddie North.
