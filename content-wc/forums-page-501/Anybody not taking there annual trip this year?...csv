1283494,AllenW,2011-03-17 14:53:00,11482,"Thanks a bunch, but I enjoy the fall trip and on Red, you know how us old folk are..Really appreciate the offer though.Like some have mentioned, the youngin's just don't see a week in the wilderness as fun, or seems they have to much to do to take the time to go.Go by myself?Naw, the camaraderie is a major part of why I go.I'll get out again, even if I have to take the wife...Al"
1283496,Guest,2011-03-17 14:57:00,0,we lost two guys off our trip due to DUI issues and getting across the border.
1283596,tly,2011-03-17 19:26:00,1900,"We have not been back to Canada since '08. Probably not this year unless get a big sales job at Mpls show (ie Dan Laquer at Nestor Falls). Way too many rules. Other trips are also marginal. Oahe- water still down but improving, Devils Lake, water way up (this has generally been a shore fishing trip cuz we have pulled boats and never been able to launch, now there are limited placed to fish from shore). Where do we go within 500 miles US? The good news is that son & grandson love to fish. It may be coming full cycle. Someday the kid can bait my hook for me. Have organized this stuff for years. All of a sudden I feel like a general without an army. Things are so bad we have discussed going to Lake Michigan salmon fishing!!"
1283774,wallydave,2011-03-18 08:00:00,2151,"Several years ago, we had a trip planned, deposit paid, when the rest of the group, switched to an ealrier week, due to a pregnancy. I was facing a week off and no one to go fishing with. I took my son, we tent camped, fished and talked. Even though hehas never gone fishing again, at least he had the experiance. Now my boat/cabin buddy, that switched weeks for the baby, is taking his wife and sons along! I have tried a couple of different boat/cabin partners, and taking a new up this year to Goose Bay. Without the fellowship, jokes, and sharing a boat a trip would lose an important feature! Good Luck Al!"
1282739,walleye4life,2011-03-15 15:38:00,54,One of the reasons fishing and hunting numbers are going down over time is because the party leader dies or gets to old and then people quit going... anyone know why?
1282743,Bill Krejca,2011-03-15 15:42:00,6107,I agree. Try to get a mix of old geezers and some young folks. It is amazing the things different generations can teach each other! Bill Krejca
1282750,515,2011-03-15 16:17:00,254,"Alot of the younger gerneration has no interest in the outdoors, I guess there's too many video games and TV's available for them now. Really too bad but the future look bleak for the camps and outfitters without the numbers to support them in the future."
1282753,Glenman12,2011-03-15 16:30:00,762,"good point..20some years ago me and my fishing partner started bringing the kids and they were too young to drive..now they organize the trip, do all the shopping and all we have to do is fish.."
1282770,plumberjoe,2011-03-15 17:11:00,54,One of my favorite trips had my 70 yr old dad and 13 yr old son in the boat with me for he week. Not sure who had more fun son or dad. One of the things my dad likes best about the trip is he has to do no planning or prep just get in truck and go.
1283076,captaincanada56,2011-03-16 13:47:00,17,"your one hundred percent right smokey. im only 25, and alot of guys i went to school with played sports with etc, who i still talk to have next to nothing for interest in anything outdoors. wether it be fishing, camping, boating or just enjoying a day on a lake, i have a **** of a time trying to get anyone new to come fishing with us. whats even more of a tragedy, is the younger generation thatn myself, are even worse. i have 2 nephews, 12 amd 10, and i planned on brining them with me this year to Georgian Bay for a few days, and neither of them want to go. the two of them didnt even bat an eye when i asked them to come, they kept playing their xbox game. i couldnt believe it!!!! at that age, i would love someone to take me fishing. im must doing something right tho, cuz my 3 year old little girl LOVES to get out and fish and camp. Hopefully that never changes!!!"
1283078,wolverine fan,2011-03-16 14:05:00,71,"Breaking my 12 year string this year due to the economy and new competition in our area. Have to say i didn't realize how much i'd miss it now that the weather is turning and those darn sat and sun morning fishing shows!!!!!UGH... Oh well, we'll just work harder and the trips i can make in the fututre will be that much more cherished. Good luck to all those that do make it!"
1283200,515,2011-03-16 19:27:00,254,Not sure what the solution will be but for the future of the sport I sure hope it gains interest.
1283416,ohiojmj,2011-03-17 11:06:00,1262,"I dream about fishing trips to Canada, sitting in my boat for a week, enjoying the outdoors, fishing, and company. I had a party of 4 going for years, but one of two sons doesn't go anymore. I've brought a brotherinlaw or one of a couple nephews to fill the boat here and there, but I'm down to just my youngest son for the past 3 yrs. We would prefer a bigger party, but will continue to go for the foreseeable future. If it comes down to just me, I'll actively seek new attendees or perhaps rent a cottage on Lake Erie near home for better turn-out. I've contemplated going by myself as a last resort.No, I don't care how much gas is, it doesn't affect my decision to go to Canada and fish."
1283493,scotttheguide,2011-03-17 14:53:00,73,"Plumberjoe, you are right on brother. Everyday I spend on the water this season I will be thinking of my father. I have a small tribute to him on the bottom of my web site that I will leave there forever. The cost of a trip is worth the memories. I am fortunate enough that I get to help other people create these memories during the season. When I see a youngster reel in a fish its hard to say who smiles more, dad or his kids.The picture is worth a thousand words, SmittysCanadianFishing.com"
1281723,Moosebunk,2011-03-13 03:05:00,211,"Two week long trips planned so far, may add a third or fourth once the summer arrives. Fishing is the only drug that cures work related living. If it was cocaine for me instead, it'd be cheaper. Ahh well."
1282055,muskyman73,2011-03-13 22:07:00,402,Our group would never miss a trip ; being stuck on an island for a week is a dream come true ! 4 months till Obabikon at LOTW
1282478,JinxCanada,2011-03-15 05:20:00,1306,"I have never understood why you guys don't come to the Windsor area and fish both Colchester and Wheatley!!!??? Lake Erie Western basin is just about the best fresh water fishing in the world!!! Smallmouth, Muskie (Lake St. Clair), Walleye, Steelhead, Perch etc etc. I love to go away as much as the next guy, but geeze for fishing you would have a hard time doing better and I'm sure it would be much cheaper here"
1282489,rebs,2011-03-15 06:07:00,7587,"eastern basin as well = Smallmouth, Walleye, Steelhead, Perch. Muskie = Niagara River etc etc."
1282522,JinxCanada,2011-03-15 07:24:00,1306,"Yup. I guess the main reason, and for me as well, would be just to get away from the city etc. I love going to a cottage, but man it's $$$ here in Canada! I'm giving serious thought to buying a cottage in Michigan on an inland lake. I can get a steal over there and it's no further than driving to Toronto."
1282528,Walley Guide,2011-03-15 07:36:00,67,"I have been making the trip since the mid-70's, my folks started going in the 50's. We have made a lot of friends over the years; including watching generation after generation of eagles raise their little ones in the nest. I have experienced some awesome days fishing up north. From watching my daughter catch her 27 inch walleye and spending countless moments with friends and family in Canada. Plus, the two wonderful weeks of the last weeks of my dad's life fishing for walleye in Canada. No matter what the price of gas, what the exchange rate may or may not be, when you experience something in life that is priceless. Miss a trip...nope and the only way it will be my last trip is when they sneak me across in the ash tray of my truck and scatter my ashes out on an island overlooking an awesome Canadian sunset. You all be careful heading up and back, I'll try not to get in your way, but I have to take in a few sights along the way.....always building memories. Happy Fishin' Walley"
1282547,515,2011-03-15 08:13:00,254,"Been there done that as I grew up on Lake Erie and still make many trips down to fish the big lake. We go away as with many others to get away from it all, nothing better then the feeling as the plane leaves and knowing your the only people on the lake for the week."
1282622,AllenW,2011-03-15 11:35:00,11482,"Not last year, not this year and who knows about next year.Sadly a 35+ year annual event to Red Lake is coming to a end.We started with four, made it up to 10 to 12 of us and then death, cost of living, different interests, family obligations and a few other things slowly narrowed it down to 1..me.Hopefully next year will turn out better.Al"
1282688,Golden Eagle,2011-03-15 13:23:00,2642,"AllenW, you need to start running with a younger crowd. I've made it up there alone, several times. It works."
1282696,wallydave,2011-03-15 13:44:00,2151,"Al, we might be able to get a cot into our cabin at Goose Bay near Ear Falls in June for you!"
1281360,515,2011-03-12 07:15:00,254,My group is skipping the annual trip this year. With two of the guys bringing there kids along now and the price of the average trip thru the roof it looks like we may have to put off the annual to a semi annual now. It takes time in the the tough econmy to save up enough money to make the trip happen for the group. We are also having a hard time coming to why the trips cost so much anymore. With 6 of us making the trip at a total cost of around $6000 for a plane trip in and a camp the guys are wondering why so much. So other plans may be in the future for something different.
1281405,OutfitterJoe,2011-03-12 08:47:00,27,"wish I could find all of you die-hards, and have you come to my place. need about another 100 or so fisher people to come into the lodge to make my year!! HELP!"
1281407,OutfitterJoe,2011-03-12 08:49:00,27,"Smokey, where are you heading? the cost for running a lodge in Canada are going though the roof..maybe find a drive-in camp that offers great fishing!! it will lower your cost.."
1281410,REG,2011-03-12 08:53:00,445,"I salute you, sir. You only get so many summers in your life. Someday I may not be physically/mentally able to go but until then, I'll find the money somewhere to get ""up north""."
1281413,rebs,2011-03-12 08:59:00,7587,where is your lodge and what does it have to offer ?
1281419,OutfitterJoe,2011-03-12 09:03:00,27,only 9.5 hrs north of Niagara
1281428,walleye4life,2011-03-12 09:29:00,54,Smokey -In the year 2001 the Usd/Cad was worth 1.60... gas was a buck a gallon. Now the outfitters have to make up for the lost exchange rate and 5$ a gallon gas..... that's why prices are going up.
1281476,scotttheguide,2011-03-12 11:31:00,73,"Cool, sounds like a lot of guys are still going to visit Canada this season. You really can't replace the experience. This might be a good time to think about a second trip. Some lodge owners will offer you a deal on a return trip in appreciation of your business. Sioux Narrows is only 90min north of International Falls and offers a lot of drive to resorts on LOTW and the fishing is outstanding.PM me if you want more info. Happy Fishing!"
1281487,515,2011-03-12 12:16:00,254,"I don't understand what there is to make up, here in Canada $1 has always equaled $1. The people losing are the Americans coming up as there dollar is only worth half what it used to be. So it's costing the fisherperson more in the end. So sure gas, land leases, insurance rates (thanks to 911) and wages have gone up over the years but the exchange rate has nothing to do with it."
1281491,walleye4life,2011-03-12 12:32:00,54,"Smokey -Yes $1 CDN has always equalled $1 CDN. It costs roughly 25-40% more to do business in Canada than in the U.S that is why the exchange has really put the crimp on the operators because operators NEEDED the xchange to make up for the increased cost of doing business in Canada. Most fly-in operators have lost 30-50% of their business since 2007 and 30% on the exchange... you do the math... there's not alot left.Also, insurance in the last 3-4 years for aircraft and camps is @ pre 9/11 rates by 20-25%. When the dollar was stronger crude was cheaper. Also, the exchange rates was an INCENTIVE for Americans to come to Canada. It made their trip WAY cheaper because of gas, groceries, meals, lodging etc...The Canadian Fishing industry is centered around Americans as they make up 95% + of the Tourism business as far as fishing in Canada."
1281176,scotttheguide,2011-03-11 17:41:00,73,"Just wondering how many people are not taking there annual trip to Canada this year and why, besides the obvious, the economy."
1281192,CSH Kucinski,2011-03-11 18:04:00,1340,"My trip to Cochrane, Ontario in June has been booked since this time last year. Can't wait!"
1281211,Moondog,2011-03-11 18:55:00,362,Someone would have to be dead or very very very ill for us not to make our annual trip.
1281242,NARDA 1,2011-03-11 19:59:00,636,"What he said!!!!In August of '09 I was told I needed open heart surgery to replace my Aortic Valve. I told the surgeon I was planning a trip to Canada in September (the wife was in the office) and he replied ""No problem we'll do it when you get back"" I could have kissed him!!!!! Came back and did the surgery a month later, no problems, everthing went great."
1281253,Rich B,2011-03-11 20:19:00,1081,"About a week before my fall trip in Sept '10 I ruptured my left quad....was sitting in the surgeon's office having this same conversation with my wife and then my doctor....I lost that argument and stayed back.....had surgery that next week.....doc told my wife I tore the quad muscle off the knee and then it split up the thigh....maybe it was better I didn't drive 2 days north and fish, but I don't know which hurt the worst....my leg or not being up north with my brother and good friends ? 78 days until my Spring trip back up north, and then a mid-July trip back up north with my bride...counting down the days ! Rich"
1281270,Walleye10pm,2011-03-11 21:10:00,71,I will be going this year. Will pay the extra $100-150 in gas to have great fishing and time with family.
1281274,Larry S,2011-03-11 21:16:00,666,Couldnot go last year due to my better half needing surgery. Going on 2 trips this year
1281305,fishforlife,2011-03-12 01:40:00,77,"I lost my job, unemployment gone, wife leaving next week, trip to Brace Lake at the end of August with my best friends is on. Priceless !!!!!!!!!!! What a country we live in. Couldn't do this anywhere else in the world. You just have your priorities in order. Truly blessed."
1281337,Fishin Fun,2011-03-12 06:06:00,218,There's no way I'm missing this trip. We start planning it a year in advance. The last time we missed it was because of the death of my father and since we started going again it's been a yearly priority. I just wish I had more time off from work that I could go more often. Plus this year I'm taking my oldest son so now I am more determined than ever to go. Can't wait! Of course the 30mp winds and light snow coming down now kind of puts me back in my place.
1281346,Golden Eagle,2011-03-12 06:31:00,2642,"Sitting out a year would be like preparing to die early. May 14-28 on Little Vermilion Lake, north of Red Lake, for me. Next is a week on LOTW in late July. August and October aren't set yet, but I'll be there. I usually don't plan an October trip - I just do it - except for 2010 due to shoulder surgery September 14. The night I return home from a fishing trip I wash my clothes and pack them for the next trip. Next day I spruce up all my equipment and pack it for the next trip. Doesn't take long to get on the road for the next one."
