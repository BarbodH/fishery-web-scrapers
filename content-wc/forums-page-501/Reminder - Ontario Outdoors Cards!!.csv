1280850,J-Man,2011-03-10 20:36:00,191,"Hey All - We include this reminder for our guests in our newsletter and on our web board, but thought it might be valuable for a few other boards with a lot of Ontario anglers. Please use this reminder to check for your Ontario Outdoors Cards, which you need to have to purchase an Ontario fishing license. For those of you who received them after they initially became available in 2009, you will have another year left on your cards. If you first received one as a result of a license purchase in 2010, they'll be good for 2 more years. If you've lost or not received your card by now for any reason, please call the outdoor card centre and have them replace it for you. This is done free of charge as a replacement, but can take up to a month to receive. Take care of it now to ensure you'll have it for your trip. If you arrive without your card, the only option is to purchase another one. We can't sell a fishing license without an existing card or a new temporary card application number; both of which you must carry at all times on the water. The phone number for card related questions is 1-800-387-7011."
1280922,Bill Krejca,2011-03-11 06:02:00,6107,"J, Thanks for the reminder. So.. next year, we will have to line up again for a new card, huh? Not to be a whiner, but I'm really not sure how having a card added much to getting a license (for the licence holder, that is). Bill Krejca"
1280926,Shellback,2011-03-11 06:25:00,8083,"Okay, my card is still good through this year. Will they send me a renewal for 2012? Or do I have to remember to renew myself? What if I forget, can I just pay for it when I buy my 2012 license? Thanks!"
1280929,Golden Eagle,2011-03-11 06:36:00,2642,"Yesterday I bought my 2011 license, an Outdoors Card for my wife and 2011 license for my wife. All by phone. I had less than one minute wait time. The guy on the other end was friendly and efficient.Delivery time is set at less than four weeks."
1280955,scgibby11,2011-03-11 07:45:00,109,I received my temporary card and license from a phone order yesterday. How long will it be before I receive the permanent card?Scott
1281175,Glenman12,2011-03-11 17:41:00,762,"I dont think they will send out a reminder..Im sure you can pay for it when you purchase your 2012 license..also, while the MNR website still isnt set up for non-Ontario residents to purchase their licenses, I believe you can renew your outdoor card on the website.."
1281659,J-Man,2011-03-12 19:02:00,191,"Good comments so far. The phone/website was part of the reason for the outdoors cards so if you take advantage of that, it could be helpful to you in terms of wait time or hassle if you go somewhere remote and have to buy one on the way.If you don't renew or get bet phone/web, you just buy another temp card with your 2012 license.The actual benefits to the angler would be minimal unless you use the phone/web renewal. You may find yourself waiting in line for a shorter amount of time in a big group if everyone remembers their cards as it takes much less time to right out a few things on the license tag, than to take all infor again for new card and tag.If they bring out the swiping machines and have print on demand at the issue point, then perhaps this whole thing will be worth it in terms of efficiency and paper savings.The time it takes to sell them, keep them sorted for record keeping and then submitting two copies of them each month and filling out the tax return like submission form is really a huge amount of time spent on something that gives very little return. A machine that keeps track of all this for the issuer by the day, week, month, etc would be heavenly..assuming the thing would work properly all the time and not take a dump during the many times the power blinks on and off in the woods!"
1282337,Pikehunters,2011-03-14 18:14:00,100,"What is the purpose of the card other than making a trip more expensive & less hassel free. I have never had a problem giving my info to the outfiitter while I unpack, gather my equipment & prep for a week of fishing. While finalizing the payment for a week & get my info ( drivers license ) back they hand me my fishing permit. I now have a card to renew ( Confused You have My Info) every two years ???????"
1282399,J-Man,2011-03-14 20:12:00,191,"I can't speak for the MNR's purrpose of the card and I won't open up that can of worms.Yes, it works out to $3 or so more per year for a license with the 3 years the card is good for.You will not find it easier to get a license when you don't have a card, but should find it quicker and easier when you do have the card in years 2 and 3. You should also not find it any more of a hassle as the same information is required, except maybe the phone number being additional over the old forms. You don't have to renew your card. EVER. You can simply get a new one when it's no good anymore and start over. Canadian residents have been doing the ""card"" thing for a great number of years and I have NEVER ""renewed"" my own card. I just get a new temp card when the old one expires and they send a new one in the mail.Hope this helps some. Again, the main point of the original post was to remind people to keep track of their cards, or call if they have not received it or lost it. Save some money, save some paper, save some aggravation...nothing bad about any of that."
