1266737,elway12,2011-01-31 14:00:00,335,We are looking for a clean place to stay for one night on our way to Canada this summer 2011. We have stayed at the Radisson Harborview but their rates are crazy this year. Any suggestions greatly appreciated. P.S. We would like to stay in Duluth rather than Superior since we are coming from Minneapolis.
1266808,fishanytime,2011-01-31 17:46:00,63,"I drive a little further and stay at the Super 8 in Rice Lake for 39.99. There is a sign just before you get to Rice Lake that says tell us about the special rate and they will give you the rate on the sign which for the last two years has been 39.99. The hotel is ok, has cable and good beds."
1266813,Skywagon,2011-01-31 18:04:00,1106,"I stayed in the Best Western at Duluth again in October, it is priced right and clean."
1267053,Tbum,2011-02-01 11:45:00,12,"Several years back, we left Perrault Falls Friday at lunch to get a jump on the drive. Found it hard to find lodging for the night due to all the fishermen heading north. The only place that had vacancy was the Black Bear Casino in Carlton. Wow! were we surprised...cost isn't much more than a Super 8 ($65-70)and the amenities are top notch...buffett too! It's become our yearly tradition. Spend a week in the woods than a night in the casino before heading to Minneapolis to fly home. We already have our room booked for June.http://www.blackbearcasinoresort.com/hotel.html"

1275020,NARDA 1,2011-02-25 08:56:00,636,"My group of 6 stayed here last year on our way up to Canada it was nice, rooms are about $50 per person and includes continental breakfast. Large parking lot, we had no problems with our gear in the trucks. There is a very nice bar & grille right next door www.gronksgrill.com that has great food, owners name is Barb (super people). There is also a Holiday gas station on the other side of the Super 8 for gas, ice etc. Worked out perfect for us. Already have our reservations for this year. Have a great trip."
1275039,camp chef,2011-02-25 09:46:00,915,ditto on the super 8...There is also a nice steakhouse...The Hammond.. right down the street.
1283250,elway12,2011-03-16 21:58:00,335,Thanks for all of the suggestions. I just got a good deal at the Country Inn & suites in Proctor. Now all we need is to purchase the plane tickets!
1074296,Hammerhead Herb,2009-01-17 12:46:00,259,"Returning from our Canadian fishing trip (Ear Falls), we (group of 8) will be staying in the Duluth/Superior area on our way back to N. Central Illinois. In the past we have stayed at some of the pricier motels on US 53 in Duluth. Can anyone recommend an inexpensive motel in the area in order that we, in these difficult economic times, can keep our costs down? The criteria would be: 1. Within a block of US 53. 2. Reasonable prices (about $25 to $30 per person for 8 guys). 3. Safe parking. Some of our gear will be in a 'hitch hauler' and a car topper cargo carrier. 4. and of course clean. Thanx in advance."
1074307,Nimstug,2009-01-17 14:27:00,2605,"I'm not sure about the rates for 25 to 35 per head, but my wife and I stayed at the Holiday Inn Express in Superior on our trip to Voyagers National Park the last week of August past. Meets your criteria for a short distance from 53 and clean. There's a Perkins (?) right across 53 for a meal. No need to move the vehicles.We had no problems with someone messing with the boat but I will never say any parking area is 100% safe. The owner of the H.I.X. also owns the motel next door and and we were offered the choice to park in that lot if we wanted. I found a nice pull through space right under a lot light so I parked there, but there were good spots in the H.I.X. lot too.H.I. was more than we wanted to spend, but as we tried to make reservations in either state, we found almost everything booked that weekend. A lot of people stay in the Duluth motels on weekends to shop at the nearby mall and we think it may have been the first week back for the college, we think there may have been a lot of but we never did figure it out.Try doing a Google search for Duluth Motels or Superior Motels. You'll see a map with their locations in relation to 53 and reviews. Hope you have a great safe trip.NimstugYou are not an adult until you know the meaning of escrow.........and colonoscopy."
1074358,rather-be-fishin,2009-01-17 19:39:00,429,"Here's a couple to check out: Days Inn, 909 Cottonwood Ave, Duluth 218-727-3110 Just off Hwy 53 by Mall area....reasonable, clean, continental breakfast in AM. Or Econo Lodge Hwy 53 & Haines Road 218-722-5522 just before the mall in Duluth. Or Country Inn & Suites Duluth North, Left on Haines Road off Hwy 53 1 block, right next to Outback Steak House and Gander Mountain....probably a little most spendy than the other 2. In general that area in Duluth is pretty safe area.... Where in Ear Falls do you fish? Lac Seul? What resort do you stay at? I'm headed up that way end of July....7 months and counting down to the trip! Happy travels! Rather-be-fishin"
1074371,Pooch,2009-01-18 04:12:00,4619,"We have stayed in some economy motels that were really ""dives"" along 53 on the Superior side trying to save a buck. Not worth it.Now we always stay at the Days Inn across from the mall. Clean, handy, several resturants within walking distance and it is about a mile from a fairly new and large Gander Mt. Clean is worth a few extra bucks to our guys! Play the ""geezer card"" and save a few bucks also. There seems to always be a discount available for active or retired fire, police or GI's.Have a good trip Hammerhead!Pooch"
1074373,bellbuoy,2009-01-18 05:12:00,490,"I started staying at the Super 8 in Eveleth, MN. Seemed to me all of the motels in the Duluth/Superior area were either over-priced or an absolute dive."
1074380,rpieske,2009-01-18 06:59:00,1276,"I agree with the EconoLodge at Haines Road. Nothing fancy, but includes a buffet breakfast and pretty good parking if you have a boat trailer. Been staying there for decades and never had a problem."
1074396,elmo,2009-01-18 08:06:00,43,"Duluth is a little rich. I tried the motel 6 like a dummy off I-35. Stay away from it not worth the dollars. I have also spent the night in Eveleth nice place to stay, not sure of the name now but the motel had place to eat inside with good food and a large indoor pool area to sit and have a beer. It was about 1/4 mile south of the hockey hall of fame. But I myself always looking for a new place to stay ."
1074441,Skywagon,2009-01-18 11:10:00,1106,"I go back and forth from central Illinois to Ontario all the time and if I don't drive straight through, I will normally stop in the Duluth area. The last time we stayed at the Super 8 in Superior, it was dirty. Seems typical of most, but no all of the motels beeing bought up by the East Indians. The Holiday Inn next door is fine. Was just at the Country Inn in Duluth in November and it was very nice, though more expensive. Tried the Best Western on 2nd Street in downtown Duluth this last summer and it was inexpensive and clean, they are not on 53, but for what you are looking for, it might be worth going 10 minutes out of your way, their # is 218-727-6851. Call all of them, ask for their best price and make your decision. Make sure you book plenty in advance, as you probably know, rooms can be hard to come by in the summer."
1074495,lobo1,2009-01-18 17:09:00,734,Country Inn and Suites has a waterslide in the pool area - if you ever want a stop for the kids to have a blast!
1074573,Obabikon,2009-01-19 07:25:00,2370,"I always drive a little farther south and stay in Spooner, WI. The holiday inn there has a 24 hour hot tub and sauna... Exactly what we need after a long day of driving."
