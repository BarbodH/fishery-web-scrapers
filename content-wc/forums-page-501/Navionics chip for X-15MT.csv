1283222,stillangling,2011-03-16 20:31:00,149,"Folks,I just purchased a new boat with a X-15MT and I am trying to find a chip for this thing that will cover Lake of the Woods. Winnipeg River would be a bonus but not a must. From what I can gather (calls to tech weenies at Navionics and Lowrance) these chips are no longer being made. Folks at Lowrance didn't seem to anxious to help. I believe that I need a ""Classic"" chip for Region 10 or 14. Any suggestions? Anyone want to sell one? I am in Kenora."
1283945,Larry Carr,2011-03-18 16:45:00,347,I have two different charts that will work. One is a Lakemaster Lake of the Woods Pro Map Series. It is part number SD/MMC LOWSWC08-07. The other is a Navionics Lake of the Woods NE/CA245L vs 01.19 $75 for either one and it will be free psotage via US Mail. Buy both and it I'll sell the for $135 plus free shipping via US Mail. You can IM me here too. LC
