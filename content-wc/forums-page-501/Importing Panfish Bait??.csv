Ontario MNR fishing regs are clear on banning import of baitfish, leeches, and other live bait, with the exception of properly packaged night crawlers. But, after some searching on the MNR web site, I can't find anything concerning the importation (for personal use) of live wax worms or meal worms to use as panfish bait. Is this allowable?"

Unfortunately, I don't recall exactly where I read it, probably in the multiple-paged booklet on fishing regulations. At one time, I was interested in bringing in wax worms, et al, to use for whitefish. Bill"
