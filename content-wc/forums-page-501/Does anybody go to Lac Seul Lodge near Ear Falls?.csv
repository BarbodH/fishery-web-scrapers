It's centrally located on the lake so you have access to many good fishing areas without long boat rides. If you want to know more, e-mail me @[email protected]."

Depending on the time of year and the weather, the fishing can be very good to excellent! LS Lodge, is just a few miles from Goose Bay, the camp I fish out of, plenty of good spots for walleye and pike near by, plus some folk make the trip to Mackenzie Bay for big walleye and pike. Staying near Ear Falls has put 30 in and back to back 29.5 in walleyes on the end of my line! Some of the posts on WC say we may have high water this spring, we just have to wait for the ice out!"
