Have gotten some excellent advice from Tackleman but now looking for leader preference (flouro or mono and what brand) and hook size. OR.........do people prefer to buy them already made up??? I like the concept of using spinners to cover more water when searching for fish but then dropping a jig on their heads once found. Only 62 more days.......gotta get going on this!!!"

I tie two hook harness. for using a bottom bouncer or fishing in weeds or other snags I use #2 eagle claw octopus hooks. red hook in the front, bronze in the back.for open water trolling i like to use a #6 treble for the back hook."
1284339,tackleman,2011-03-19 19:33:00,444,"when I tie my spinners I use a 2/0 hook. this gives a big enough gap that I can put it in the mouth, out the gills then through the side or up from the belly and out the back.I don't like the #4 hooks as they are so small when the fish takes the bait, it gets swallowed and when you pull the fish in it rips the liver and the fish dies after it is released.the hooks i have been using are a mustad #32608 npn ( i think this is the code for the nickle plating)they are the ultra point hook and are extremely sharp.I use 20# trilene xl for the leader and to measure the length, I grab the end , extend my arm and cut the leader at the shoulder length. This gives me about a 3 foot leader after the hook is tied on."
1284347,Moondog,2011-03-19 20:18:00,362,Amen on the #4 hooks........I have taken more of those out of fish I caught than any other. I can only imagine how many they kill.
