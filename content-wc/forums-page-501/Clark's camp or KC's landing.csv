Good walleye fishing but not great size. Great muskie fishing. No northerns to be had. We switched to a resort on Lac Seul for 2 reasons; bigger walleyes and the ability to catch northern pike. That does come with a price; resorts on Lac Seul do cost more. All that being said, i would highly recommend Clarks' Camp as a resort facility."
1281310,81Saluki,2011-03-12 03:52:00,97,We have a cabin on the chain -- it's for sale :-( -- and there are northern in there now. Story goes that a neighboring lake overflowed during a really rainy period several years ago which brought the northern into the chain. Don't know how big they are now ... I've caught several sub-30 inchers in recent years. Doesn't seem to have affected the musky fishing ... still awesome.
1281402,wishinfishinmn,2011-03-12 08:42:00,52,We are signed up for early August. My family loves it up there. Good walleye/muskie fishing and a nice beach for the kids to swim at. Karla and Wayne are great hosts as well.We are wanting to do more adventures/fishing up towards Forest Lake area. We are looking for larger walleyes on reefs in August. Any suggestions/thoughts/intel?wishinfishin
1281467,81Saluki,2011-03-12 10:50:00,97,"Hey there Wishin:Do try to get up to the Forest Lake area in the summer/fall. Fishing is always good there ... eater-sized walleye are plentiful and trophy muskie can be found around the islands and our point (our cabin is the northern-most cabin before going through the channel to the dam further north).By the way ... If you've been to Forest Lake recently, you probably saw the ""for sale"" sign in our yard. Not trying to sell you the place, but ... IF the sign is still there when you come up AND the deck lights are on, feel free to stop by and say 'hi' ... we always like meeting new people who enjoy the area as much as we do! :-)81Saluki"
1282025,wishinfishinmn,2011-03-13 20:23:00,52,Sounds great. My dad and his 7 and 9 year old grandkids will be trying for walleyes and trolling for some muskies. kids are too young to cast in the forest lake area. let me know if possible where some deeper water off of islands to work or some points of interest. would love to have one of them tangle with a muskie.
1282097,81Saluki,2011-03-14 06:45:00,97,"Wishin:Y'all should be fine fishing together in Forest Lake. There are many places where the kids can jig for walleye while the men cast for muskies.For example: Around the point at our cabin, eater-sized walleye can be found … PLUS there's a 40-ish inch muskie usually lurking around our floating dock or along shore on the west side. We've never caught him ourselves but have raised him a few times. (click here for underwater video). Also, the ""big island"" northwest of our cabin is another good spot for catching both walleye and muskie. My nephew (5 years old at the time) caught his first walleye there … an 18-incher ... he told Grandpa that he caught a rock and then got REALLY excited when the rock started moving. :-) It's also where a buddy of mine caught a 40-inch muskie (click here for video).For your reference, I've edited a depth chart map (click here for pic) so you can get a visual feel for where those places are.DEPTH CHART MAPS: FYI … Indian Lake Lodge has depth charts of the entire chain on their web site. Go here to download them.Have a GREAT trip!81Saluki"
