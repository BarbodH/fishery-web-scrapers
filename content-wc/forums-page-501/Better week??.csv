1283597,jkretch,2011-03-17 19:26:00,80,I fish Eagle every year one of first two weeks of August with my sons (18 and 13). This will be trip #9 with my oldest and we have always had good results - with some years better than others. The walleyes relate to the reefs and have provided very consistent action for us. Pike are caught in the same areas as the walleyes (some lake sections seem to be better) as well as the weeds. Trout are concentrated in the holes and muskies are typically in the classic spots. I think August is a great time to go for consistency on a variety of species. While we have caught a few SM - we really haven't fished for them - maybe this year. Good luck and have fun.

Great place for a family.We typically go the last week of July... normally walleyes on the reefs at this time of year. We fish a lot in the back channel and entry to the big lake which always produces nice fish.I agree with other posters, there is always a calm spot to be found on Eagle. Beautiful scenery."
1281836,JIGSTER,2011-03-13 10:36:00,30,"Hello, I a new to the site, very impressed by the amount of knowledge shared on the site! I've been to canada many times on ""guy"" trips. Looking to take my wife and 13 yr. old son for the first time. Was looking at Eagle Lake for the multi-species oppurtunities, I have no experience on the Lake. I have to choose between the last week in July or the second week in August? Any advatages or disadvantages of either week?Any opinions appreciated. Thanks in advance!!"
1281844,jiggster,2011-03-13 10:53:00,183,I would consider driving to Ear Falls to Andersons Manitou Falls Camp. The camp is located on the English river with 7 lakes off the system. No matter what the weather is like you don't have to fight the huge waves that you can have on Eagle. Great multi species fishing and great of the dock. This would not be an American Plan. Great price. I am not affiliated with the lodge . Send pm if you would like more information. I don't feel it would make any difference between the two weeks. If you decide to go to the Andersons Manitou Falls let me know. I will be their the 2 weeks prior and could put you on the fish right away.
1281913,Crede,2011-03-13 14:45:00,134,"My advice for taking wife and son for the first time : Go to a lake you have already been to. You will have plenty to do trying to put them on fish without learning a new lake. If that is not possible (and I realize there are about a million reasons why it may not be), try to go during a month where you have had success in the past/to a lake of similar size. The pattern/method should at least be similar. If you can't do that, strongly consider getting a guide for the first day or two. To answer your question : I think that the pattterns/success of the last week of July thru the 2nd week of August are very similar on most Ontario lakes. Either week should be fine."
1281988,v-bay gord,2011-03-13 19:06:00,3168,"Jigster.......I am partial to Eagle Lake and think this would be a fine choice, especially with your family. I think the notion that Eagle Lake has bigger waves than other area lakes is interesting but not accurate over the whole lake. Eagle is over 70 miles long with large sections and smaller sections.....basically a string of lakes varying from deep clear water in the west (lake trout) to shallow stained water in the south-east. Pick a location that suites your needs and the species you would like to fish for. As far as your date choices, my only comment is that as you progress further into August the walleye will relate to deeper and deeper water. Evening hours are shorter as well, but generally some of the most stable weather is to be found in August. Either time period should be fun for your family. You can pm me if you have specific questions about the lake."
1281995,Danbear,2011-03-13 19:24:00,72,"I am partial to Eagle Lake too, our 1st trip there we stayed on the east side and that side has bigger water it was a very cold and windy week and waves were big enough to make you wish you weren't there. Last trips have been to Birchdale Lodge on the west arm and have had no problems always an island or bay to fish in when the weather kicks up or you can always catch SMB and pike off the piers."
1282256,fishinnut 3446,2011-03-14 14:17:00,638,"My vote will also be for Eagle lake,I have been there 5-6 times now and have not been in any weather thats been to bad not to fish in other than rain for 1-3 straight!but thats what rain suits are for.I would check out Birchdale lodge GREAT family prices or check with V-GORD Place, there's some great fishing 2-3 min.boat ride to the sand bar behind Strawberry Island from either place and I'm not giving any more honey hole's til I get back.Eagle here I come 7/2-7/9 can't wait!"
1282262,jsmyers,2011-03-14 14:27:00,198,"The original question was mostly about the time of the year.I used to Fish Wabaskang in the 2nd, 3rd, or later in August. I never fished in NW Ontario in July.I don't think there is a reason to pick one week over the other. If the water starts cooling off early, you might get better fishing in August, but that is not likely. The days are longer in July (by a bit), which is good.If I were you, I'd probably go in July just because I wouldn't be sitting at home thinking I could be up there now, instead of in 3 weeks."
1282401,JIGSTER,2011-03-14 20:14:00,30,"Thanks for the replies guys! I'm definetely interested in any info that affects my decision for the family. I'm sure walleyes and northerns are to be had that time of year, are the perch and smallies worth targeting then? Thanks, Rick"
1282511,jsmyers,2011-03-15 07:01:00,198,"In my experience, perch and smallmouth may be more reliable in the heat of the summer than pike and walleye."
1282950,Babamel2,2011-03-16 07:37:00,414,"I took my wife the first time 4 yrs ago. I made sure it was a good experrience for her. Now she is hooked and I have a great fishing partner. yes we still have our disagreements on the water, but she is as hooked on fishing as I am.If you are looking to have them be involved on future trips, focus your attention on them even if it means you get less fishing done. Let them get the big one, make them as pleased as possible and they will please you in years to come."
