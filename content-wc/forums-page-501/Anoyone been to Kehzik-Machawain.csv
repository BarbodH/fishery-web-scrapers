543956,fishstalker,2004-10-27 11:36:00,54,I am doing my first fly-in to Machawain this coming June. A friend who organized the trip says he does well and has seen pike in the mid 40's and lots of nice eyes. Anyone hear of this place? Its 100 miles north of Armstrong. Thanks!

544021,Guest,2004-11-01 16:24:00,0,"Hey Tim, I believe it was you who answered a similar question for me about Keehzik. I'm really curious to know how good the brook trout fishing really is? How hard was it to access the rapids downstream where you caught them? Also wouldn't mind knowing what lures you found effective. Finally, it seems as though it may be possible to access Opikeigen Lake if you travel far enough down. Just wondering if you went that far. Thanks in advance for any reply."
