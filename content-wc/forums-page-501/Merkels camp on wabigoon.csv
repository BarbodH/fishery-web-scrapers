1223204,HighTech,2010-07-28 17:08:00,75,"Ranger Ranger Ranger,,, What is it about Wabigoon you don't like. Come on up and go to Lac Seul, Lake St Joseph or what ever lake you like. I'll go out on the entire Wabigoon chain and outfish you on a given day, or I'll buy you a case of Canadian Beer! Yes the lakes you mention are excellent fisheries and do produce, but basing your comment on the information provided is a bit simplistic. Mr gksharrow did miss 80% of the fishing area. I wish I could have run into him on the lake I would have loved to show him around. Ranger, When you fished Wabigoon did you stay near camp or cover the entire chain from Dryden to Rock lake and Turtlepond? When were you here and how exactly did you do? Again NO im not a guide or camp owner. I am intersted in the tourism economy in the entire area from Pickle Lake to Dryden. I do live in Wabigoon so I guess I'm a bit sensitive, althought I don't really know why! The beer challenge is open till Sept 2011.."
1223365,2746,2010-07-29 08:37:00,3206,"It does not cost any more to fish on a great lake, with good consistant fishing, than a mediocre one. You have probably read about the many fish of slot or above, caught in numbers, on some of the other lakes. That is true, not a bad problem to have. Lac Seul area lakes, Eagle lake, Red lake, Lake St Joseph, many good choices.[/quote]Exactly! One of the first rules of fishing....""go where the fish are""."
1223761,srj,2010-07-30 10:30:00,971,"I have to disagree with Ranger on the fish factory comment--the Goon and chain have lots of fish. Lots. I only fish it mid-summer and usually on Wabigoon, so I can't comment on other time periods. It's the most diverse lake as far as fish locations I've ever fished. Eyes deep on a reef, sure (bouncers or jigs). A school on top in 2 - 4 feet on the same reef, sure (shallow cranks or whistlers/plastic). Lots of eyes in the cabbage, sure. THe weedline is usually quite narrow and shallow. Not uncommon to find them on the inside edge. Roaming schools along the islands and sand flats, sure. We've also caught fish trolling the basin with deep runners, not lots, but bigger. Personally, I get a big kick out of the really shallow stuff because you just don't know what the next bite will be: eye, pike, smallie or one of the very large muskies that hang in the same areas. The clay stained water can be a bit intimidating. Sure doesn't affect the fish--they are all quite fat. If we see fish deep on the rocks, we expect to catch a bunch. If we don't see any, we still jig for a bit and often catch a bunch. We catch fish on far more humps than not. Leech or half crawler. Orange whistler and orange twister tossed shallow is a blast. Try fat body crankbaits with a rattle-we generally do better with a noisy crank than a quite one, like a shadrap. Bouncer/spinner/crawler along the islands and sand flats produce lots too. Slip bobbers with a leech works well too. Rigs work too, but lots of the reefs are real snaggy. For what it's worth, I fish Lac Suel more than Wabigoon and find LS easier to fish and the water is ""prettier"". That being said, the Goon and chain is a great walleye destination with very large pike and huge muskies. Lots of nice accomodations too, including the mentioned resorts. It's a fun lake)s). Good luck"
1223890,ranger22,2010-07-30 19:11:00,124,"I used both the hotmaps and garmin gps map as well. I didn't touch a single rock the whole time I fished there. So between them you should be okay. Ya I guide for the first day is a great idea Dryden has some good fishermen. As for no fish , I caught nice size eaters all the way from contact bay to rock lake. I also caught a good fighters biggest 7 pounds lot's of 5 and 4 as well."
1284949,Robert Cardenas,2011-03-21 13:28:00,138,"I have stayed at Merkel's and enjoyed my stay, very nice guy but was only able to tent camp, cabin space is limited. What is nice about Wabigoon is you can fish for every species (walleye, northern, muskie, perch, smallies,and now crappie. I highly recommend Wabigoon for fishing. The walleye fishery is crazy, there are tons of walleye, our group has had 40-50+ fish days just in the morning. I now stay at Bonny Bay Resort, which is a much bigger resort and very clean, with super nice rental boats if you need them, they all have 50 horse 4 stroke motors, and a lot of cabins including a huge lodge in case it is raining and you dont want to go fishing. They will also take you out and show you spots that are producing fish. There is a reason I have been going to the goon for 10 years. My experience with some of the lakes in Canada is they are fish specific and you only catch one species, boring. I am a huge walleye guy but like to catch multiple species. Also there are many lakes attached to the goon that you can get to by boat, these lakes tend to be very clear and produce a lot of fish also. Highly recommend trying it again, and if your up the first week of June, I would be glad to take you out or show you many spots to fish. I am not a guide, resort owner, I live in the Twin Cities, I have fished Gull Rock, Red, Lac Seul all great fisheries but keep coming back to Wabigoon for a reason, lots of fish and multiple species."
1220515,gksharrow,2010-07-19 06:32:00,9,Ranger- Thanks for the reply. I would be interested in doing a day trip to another lake (at least to see something different) how would I go about doing that?
1220520,HighTech,2010-07-19 06:46:00,75,"Ranger is not completly wrong, however he is not correct in that Wabigoon can and does produce a lot of fish. he is correct in that on certain days they are hard to find, that is true on any lake. I live here, Im not a camp owner or a guide. have you been to the south end of Dinorwic Lake where the creek starts to go into Rock Lake? have you tried the mouth of the River (Long lake river) in Dinorwic? Without knowing for sure, I think your missing most of the lake. As far as a day trip that would be fun, it's simple to pull you unit up to Sioux lookout, (1 hour) launch at any of the public launches (ask the tourist center on the left) and take a run up to English River Falls. If you don't get dozens there I would be surprised. Good luck"
1220722,gksharrow,2010-07-19 16:46:00,9,"First to both HighTech and ranger NB thanks for all the information, it helps and is greatly appreciated. I went out this morning (up until about noon) and got my limit. I also caught a nice perch (without any worms) and a 1/2 dozen or smaller non-keeper walleyes.I caught one keeper and a small one on the weed edge near camp and the rest around devil's island (the only two places I tried today). There were a half dozen other boats around devil's island and every one seemed to have caught at least one.I have not tried Dinorwic at all but it sounds like a worthwhile trip. I am also going to see if I can do a day trip to a different lake, since I like trying out new bodies of water.Thanks againGreg"
1220833,Ranger NB,2010-07-20 05:55:00,15,"Eagle lake is the closest to you (just a few miles west of Dryden). As was mentioned, you can't go wrong, going to Lac Seul or it's adjoining lakes, lots of great options that are a short drive from where you are now. Do a seach on the internet and start calling lodges, or guide services, on what ever lake fits your fancy. Getting a guide to take you out on the lake, or any lake would probably be the best bet. If you do this leg work now, the next time you come, you will be sitting on a more consistant fishery, with a better chance at numbers and larger average size. So many lakes, so little time. Good luck."
1220909,dogrodder,2010-07-20 09:49:00,400,"Thanks HighTech and Ranger for the pointers. Mighty generous to share real fishing information. My group is fairly new to Wabagoon and should try Dinorwic this year. The plan is to be in Dryden the first week in August. How accurate, or perhaps I should ask is how comprehensive are the lake hazard maps for Wabagoon with the Garmin GPS? The rocks make the lake a fantastic fishing lake."
1221006,fisherman 1,2010-07-20 15:46:00,39,"I just had another great day on the goon as usual. 25"" walleye released, 21"" smallie released and a limit of nice eaters. Caught on 1/8 oz jig and a large leach, on the windward side of some of the mid lake islands! I didn't fish beside another boat all day!fish on!"
1221021,HighTech,2010-07-20 16:32:00,75,"Ranger seems to want you off of wabigoon. (maybe he's protecting his spots!!) While I agree that lac seul is an excellent fishery so is Wabigoon. Look at the PWT a couple year ago lots of big fish in the 5 to 9 lb range. If you do plan to venture to Eagle,, DO NOT attempt to go out on your own, I would bet you will hit a rock before your out of any bay, get a guide as suggested. Glad you guys are seeing fish, Wabigoon can be a challenge but it's worth it. As far as the GPS maps for Wabigoon I have the Navionics Hot maps and it is reasonably good but you MUST augment it by downloading the database from the Dryden Yacht Club (search google). That will keep you reasonably safe. The south shore of Wabigoon is particurally challenging, tons of rocks and reefs. It's still a good idea to get a guide on your first day to get aquainted with the lake. There is no reason you can't get dozens of walleye on any given day on the goon, and the nice thing is there are a lot of nice size ones. Also don't limit yourself to a section of Wabigoon, check Buttler, Olsen, Larson. Paulson, Dinorwic, Rock, Turtlepond,, etc etc.. It will take days to cover it all. It matters not to me where you fish, I just want you to enjoy the region and spend money anywhere!!!!"
1221229,Ranger NB,2010-07-21 10:42:00,15,"gksharrow: when you return home, give us a report of your week fishing on Wabigoon, numbers, size, general experience and if you did make it to another lake. Good luck the rest of the week."
1222980,gksharrow,2010-07-27 20:33:00,9,"I am back home and here is my update.General thoughtsI wil divide the people at the camp I stayed into two groups, those who had their own boats and those that did not. Most of the people who had their own boats had also been on the lake before (in some cases multiple times). In general the people who had their own boats did much better than those that did not. I was at the lower end of sucess the people with boats, but probably better than most that used camp boats.I caught lots of smallish eaters (12-16in) but nothing large (except the 30in northern I caught jigging for walleye). There were extended periods (multiple hours) where I did not catch anything (or have a bite). I also never experienced a period where the fishing was extremely hot (catch fish after fish). Overall, I probably averaged 1 to 1.5 fish per fishing hour.I went to Dinorwic as my day trip (going to another lake just didn't work out). I would say the fishing there was slightly better than Wabigoon."
1223026,Ranger NB,2010-07-28 07:22:00,15,"gksharrow: thanks for the update, sorry for the rainy weather, it is still continuing. I think you proved my point about Wabigoon, no Dinorwic is not the answer either. Sorry you did not get a chance to do a day trip, but with limited time, it is understandable. I still say, find one of the many good lakes in that area to the north and research the lake yourself. Find a lake that gets a lot of good press and not just that of camp owners and guides that post on the internet (is there a camp out there that doesn't say they have excellent fishing?) How did other people do when fishing on Lac Seul (as an example) the same week you were on Wabigoon? What were their numbers, sizes? It does not cost any more to fish on a great lake, with good consistant fishing, than a mediocre one. You have probably read about the many fish of slot or above, caught in numbers, on some of the other lakes. That is true, not a bad problem to have. Lac Seul area lakes, Eagle lake, Red lake, Lake St Joseph, many good choices."
1216711,troutwater,2010-07-07 07:48:00,299,"For a trip next year I've been seriously considering going to Wabigoon. Every year at the All-Canada shows I talk to Terry from Merkel's. He seems like a nice guy and that the camp would be a fun one. Usually I hear about everyone going and fishing Indian Point Camp, but never too much about Merkel's. Has anyone fished out of this camp before? I'd mainly be after muskies, but would also be doing some walleye fishing. Thanks.Nathan"
1219753,troutwater,2010-07-16 11:41:00,299,No takers? Wabigoon must not be a popular place to go.
1219843,2746,2010-07-16 15:00:00,3206,"I'll take a hit here from Wabigoon fishermen but your observation that it's ""not very popular"" is probably accurate. Once you get to Dryden one is so close to outstanding fishing lakes like Eagle, Lac Seul. Gullrock etc. that Wabigoon probably doesn't draw as it did 20 years ago. Like I said, I'm going to take a hit here!"
1219852,brn2fsh,2010-07-16 15:44:00,49,"Wabigoon is an interesting lake to fish. You almost can't fish shallow enough, yet its clay base limits water clatity.......You're in 2-3 fow jigging and there are big rocks all around THAT YOU CAN""T SEE. Also, the big rocks aren't just shallow. Lots of fish though. We liked Trap and Mile lakes better but I'd sure get a guide the first day I went out on the ""Goon"""
1219854,ranger22,2010-07-16 15:54:00,124,"Yep It is interesting to fish for sure. Big rocks everywhere, lot's of fish. I fished there for the first time this year. I got a garmin gps and downloaded the wabigoon hazard map from the dryden yaught club for free then you don't have to worry about the big rocks no more. You just have to worry about lot's of fish."
1219880,fisherman 1,2010-07-16 17:39:00,39,"Nathan,I was just on Muskies First and here is a link to a current musky report on Wabigoon.http://muskie.outdoorsfirst.com/boar...osts=4&start=1I'm with Ranger 22. Yes there are lots of rocks, also known as structure. A lot of them are great walleye spots at this time of the year, also most of the hazards in the east end of the lake have jugs marking them so they double as fishing markers as well.Fish on!"
1220344,gksharrow,2010-07-18 15:49:00,9,"I am on wabigoon this week (through Friday 7/23 ) went out today and did not have any luck, tried bulter same bad luck there. I have seen others catch some, so I must be doing something wrong.I tried jigging with minnows and leeches, trolling with spinners, and crankbaits. I tried in 3-4 fow up to 25 mostly along islands or rocky points.Does anyone have any tips?"
1220416,HighTech,2010-07-18 19:19:00,75,"I was out Saturday, and today Sunday limit both days. Today walleye on weed edges, (not too far into weeds,, big northerns there) also two off Larson Island about 15 feet. Simple jig and minnow (no leader) moving slow. Ask your camp for best weed edges.."
1220459,gksharrow,2010-07-18 21:42:00,9,high tech - thanks I'll give it a shot tomorrow
1220503,Ranger NB,2010-07-19 06:00:00,15,"gksharrow: The Wabigoon chain of lakes are not known to be a fish factory and can be very inconsistant. Even the locals find it can be challeging. Not a place where catching large numbers of fish is the norm. You are within close range of some really good lakes, Eagle, Wabby, Red Lake, Gull Rock, Lac Seul and all the lakes associated with it, ect. Do a day trip to one of them, catch some fish and regroup for next year, or at least visit them on one of these rainy days. It doesn't cost any more to stay on a good lake and catch fish, as opposed driving that far for mediocre.You have to realize that camp owners are usually really nice people that will paint the rosy picture of the great fishing on their lake, to get your business. Also realize that some of the people that post on this board, (with out identifing who they are) about Wabigoon, are camp owners and guides with their own agenda. You will catch fish on Wabigoon, just don't expect to catch a lot, or that it will be easy. Good luck."
