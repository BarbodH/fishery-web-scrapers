1283703,hranson,2011-03-18 05:27:00,4,"Go to www.gawleysparkviewcamp.com for info on drive to camp. It is in northwestern Ontario and the owners are very good to their patrons. It is on Wabaskang Lake. They have gas there and docking is free. I have no idea what tackleman means by private boats not being allowed in northwestern Ontario. Actually, I think he is saying he has never been to a camp in northwestern Ontario that doesn't allow private boats. I think I read his comment incorrectly."
1283736,J Arendt,2011-03-18 07:03:00,45,Check out the camps on the Red Lake--Gullrock systems. All are very good with great camp owners.
1283803,rjg,2011-03-18 09:46:00,13,"A nice peaceful place on winnipeg river system is PARADISECOVEMINAKI.COM There is no charge for boat slip, free electricity for charging trolling batteries, safe to leave equipment in boat, lots of big walleyes, muskies, northerns and bass. Only 42.50 per person or 297.50 per week. Lots of people to put you on good fishing. Bait shop, marina, resturant and lounge. Cabins have cable tv also."
1283933,rsako,2011-03-18 16:20:00,159,looks awesome. That would need to be a 7-10 dayer for us coming from Alberta...to make it worthwhile. NW Ontario seems to have tonnes of these type of resorts or outposts. And darm nice ones too. I need to find stuff a little closer to home for this year (bought a new boat)...need to keep thing affordable. But I sure like the looks of many of the eastern lodges..Lake of the Woods area rocks for sure. keep'em coming...so we can all dream :-)
1284389,Robert Cardenas,2011-03-20 00:05:00,138,"Bonny Bay Resort, www.bonnybay.com I have been going there for 10 years, they cater to the boat owners and even give you gas and bait per day. Great owners, super clean nice cabins and great dock area, not to mention the awesome fishery. The PWT went here two years in row if that says something. Check out there website."

1282433,tackleman,2011-03-14 21:25:00,444,"google sunset country, they will have a ton of drive to locations and check out those places, if they are a drive too camp, the availability of having your own boat with you and getting docking and gas and bait is almost 100%.I haven't been to a drive in camp in over 30 years living in northwestern ontario that doesn't allow private boats."
1282466,adempsey,2011-03-15 02:32:00,963,Northern Ontario Tourist Outfitters Association website is a good place to start. Try out the trip wizard.
1282506,mrwalleye5,2011-03-15 06:51:00,1922,I'm taking my boat into a boat in resort this summer. Camp Narrows on the north arm of Rainy Lake. Boat in about 7 miles. Cabins on the water with your own dock.
1282566,micropterus,2011-03-15 09:20:00,450,I have taken my boat to both Red Pine and Garden Island.
1282580,camp chef,2011-03-15 09:51:00,915,We have taken our boat to Indian Lake (north of Ignace) and Big North lodge on the Winnipeg River. Both great fishing .Agimac river outfitters on Indian
1282633,adempsey,2011-03-15 11:51:00,963,"Out of curiosity, how much did it cost to get the boat up passed the ****?"
1282702,rsako,2011-03-15 14:00:00,159,Out west anyone? Boat-in or Drive-in with your boat?
1282730,captaincanada56,2011-03-15 15:20:00,17,"its a pretty safe bet that 95 percent of the camps that you can drive too will also allow your own boat and slip. Try googleing Lake Nippissing, theres PLENTY of camps there< and a lot of water to fish as well"
1282855,Highplainsfisher,2011-03-15 20:41:00,5,"Good number of them in SK, Jacobsen Bay on Anglin Lake. There is a couple of boat in lodges that were still open the last time I went through Hunter's Bay on Lac La Ronge, although I'll admit that was a few years ago. Jan Lake lodge is another lodge that you can drive to. That's off the top of my head, you can also check with sasktourism.com to find a list of lodges."
