1255615,Moosebunk,2010-12-15 11:34:00,211,"I have a pre-existing trip I take annually to North-West Ontario in which I tow my own boat up there (16' Rebel, 60HP) during the late summer. Onaman's seems to have some rave reviews online here. I was hoping some folks with past experiences there could answer some questions.1. How friendly is the road up from 11 to Onaman's Resort for towing the boat? How are the launch and docking facilities? Is gas available nearby?2. How is the river for boating hazards?3. In Humboldt, how would you rate the speckle, laker and pike fishing... and during what season is this? Also, how have you found lake conditions to be generally, ie; is it often big wave water? Are there always places to fish out of bad lake conditions? 4. How is the access and how much time does it generally take to get into Onaman Lake from the resort?5. In Onaman, how would you rate the walleye and pike fishing... and during what season? What are big fish generally for the lake?6. At the resort, how are the accommodations?7. Describe an average fishing day on either the river, Lake Nip and/or Onamans?8. What is it about Onaman's that you enjoy most?9. Anything about Onaman's to be warned about? 10. During what time of year do you generally go?Thanks guys in advance for any consideration and reply. Appreciated, and will help."
1255619,Mike Borger,2010-12-15 11:52:00,1554,"That's a lot of questions Drew LOL!My friends relatives own that resort, we should talk."
1255620,Wade B AKA: Ruger2506,2010-12-15 11:53:00,5533,"1. How friendly is the road up from 11 to Onaman's Resort for towing the boat? How are the launch and docking facilities? Is gas available nearby?No there is not gas nearby. Pasha Lake Cabins has gas, not sure if Chad will sell to non-renters. Get gas in Beardmore. That's that last gas you'll see for sometime. In fact you should probably top everything off in Thunder Bay. Nipigon may or may not have gas. The road IS NOT FRIENDLY. It's a long, hazardous, bumpy ride from 11 to Onaman. They are logging roads that are maintained by the logging companies. If you are lucky, they will have graded recently. The aggregate they use up there is huge (3"" - 4"" + rocks). Between large rocks and pot holes, it makes for a long trip. 25 MPH tops, if you are lucky. I would highly recommend bringing 2 extra tires for the boat, extra bearing buddies/caps, bearings and supplies, #2 shovel, etc. I lost a bearing buddy and a tire on that road. Saw another guy rattle his fender right off his trailer. The TowTector doesn't work at all up their either. Dad's boat has a ton of rock dings in his boat. Perhaps a TowTector reinforced with heavy rubber mats. We went past Onaman because our boats were to big to land there. I would talk to the resort and verify you can get in. We landed on NorthWind and drove all the way up to Ombabika River to access Ombabika Bay on Nipigon. If I remember correctly, it was about 52 mils and it took us 1.75 hours. 2. How is the river for boating hazards?Everything up there including big lakes has many rock hazards. I would think Onaman is the same. 3. In Humboldt, how would you rate the speckle, laker and pike fishing... and during what season is this? Also, how have you found lake conditions to be generally, ie; is it often big wave water? Are there always places to fish out of bad lake conditions? Don't Know4. How is the access and how much time does it generally take to get into Onaman Lake from the resort?Don't Know5. In Onaman, how would you rate the walleye and pike fishing... and during what season? What are big fish generally for the lake?Guys who were staying next to us were on Onaman most days. More walleye than they could shake a stick at. 400 fish for the week. Many of them were nice fish also (20""+). 6. At the resort, how are the accommodations?Don't Know 7. Describe an average fishing day on either the river, Lake Nip and/or Onamans?What species? Walleye on all the lakes we hit, unreal. Lakers on Nipigon? Challenging (when we were there). 8. What is it about Onaman's that you enjoy most?It's an outdoor heaven! 9. Anything about Onaman's to be warned about? Since you are bringing your own gear, BE PREPARED. It's a rough and ugly county up there with NO close service stations or parts stores. 10. During what time of year do you generally go?August. Lakers peak time is different than Walleye and Pike. Depends what you are looking for. Check out my post from our trip this year.http://www.forum.minnesotawaterfowle...ighlight=pashahttps://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...ght=Pasha+Lake"
1255662,polaris-pete,2010-12-15 15:20:00,343,"The previous posts answers are 100% correct. I will verify everything he said.I spent a week at Chad's place ( Pasha lake) in mid June.I would never haul my won boat there ( even though I had thought of it).We were lucky as they had just graded the roads while we were there. While in Camp some of his boats and trailers came back very broken, broken springs, bent axles, in fact none of Chad's trailers have any lights on them any more.The rocks are large and uncoming traffic can be quite fast and some of them have no respect for anyone coming the other way. This is vast and wild country and nothing or no one to help out in an emergency but yourself and your partners. Onaman is a large rocky lake and shoals come up out of nowheres! There are no marinas or any cabins on it except one outfitter has a couple cabins you have to fly into and it costs some large $$$. The fishing was great the entire week.As for the Onaman River Lodge, just as in other forums some loved it and some hated it. Its not a 4 Star resort but the owners are trying to do a good job. Thats alot considering how far they are away from everything. We took whatever we thought we needed and then some and used just about all of it. Chad is a great guy and does guiding on the Jackfish River and on Onaman itself.If you need alittle more info PM me and I will give you a couple contacts who went also and have been going for some time. Pete"
1255668,Wade B AKA: Ruger2506,2010-12-15 16:12:00,5533,I personally wouldn't hesitate to bring my boat back. Of course we are planning on spending a lot of time on Nipigon looking for those big Lakers. Just know that your rig won't be the same when you get home. Take your electronics out of the boat and keep them in the truck under protection from the pounding roads.
1255679,deputy dog,2010-12-15 16:51:00,305,"not being a smarta** but is the fishing that good to put your equipment, and kidneys through all that. i'm not familiar with that lake so that's why i ask"
1255695,polaris-pete,2010-12-15 18:01:00,343,"Myself, no I would not subject my equipment to that abuse but many are different. We had great euipment and fishing using Chad's 60 bots and motors on many different lakes. he has 97 different lakes to put his people on.But YES the fishing was EXCEPTIONAL- thats why we are going back. Didn't really see the need for 18-20 ft bots on any of the lakes we fished. The exception would be Nipigon but if we needed to fish it, Chad had a big boat of his own. To many other smaller lakes that held large amounts of walleyes.We fished different lakes all week and caught as many as you wanted but always dreaded the long and rough road back to the Cabins.I talked to 1 fella at camp who had his own 18; Mirrocraft. By the end of the week he had a cracked windshield, a broken transducer, a busted prop from a large rock and the boat was so filthy from road dust that after the first day trailering it covered, said why bother! So he hauled it each day uncovered and said he would never bring his back either. But as I said, many would, just not I."
1255880,northernbite,2010-12-16 13:46:00,1186,Moose; You have a PMPaul
1255917,Moosebunk,2010-12-16 17:03:00,211,"WOW!!! Again guys, thanks for your time. Definitely better to have asked than to find out the hard way. Being that I already travel to the area and do quite well fishing there, it doesn't sound like beating on my new Lund to catch more of what I'm already getting is in my best interest. It would be great to check out that end of the lake and the surrounding lakes too, to add a few days onto my trip there... but maybe it's best I do it sometime using their available gear.Replies appreciated.Bunk"
1256093,PIKEMAN330,2010-12-17 13:01:00,101,"Moose,I think you are asking about Onaman river resort.I have been there on my last two trips to Ontario and my next trip will be right back there.The road in was not that bad when we were there as far as ORR .It gets worse past there.The trip to Nipigon lake is about 8 miles.The Pike fishing at the mouth of the river is very good in the spring.The back lakes are very good with very little pressure,almost none.Robert will give you a boat to fish these back lakes.The launch area is very good,I have seen some large boats launch there.Robert sells gas at the camp.He has boats on Onaman Lake for $65 a day.I think the cabins are fine and Robert and his dad are always fixing things up.In the fall walleye fishing was very good right at the boat docks as well as the back lakes.I can't speak for the Trout fishing as I am not a Trout fisherman.Robert has a charter boat he takes out for Trout.As for the wind ,can't think of any of the Thirty some lakes I have fished in Canada that were not windy at times.I found Robert and his dad to be very nice,likeable and honest people.They are working hard to make this a fine camp.I am planning to go up in May of 2011.PM me for my phone number if you would like to talk."
1256458,eyemike,2010-12-19 13:53:00,233,"Your right about the beyond words part, husband and wife are very unfriendly to say the least."
1260025,Moosebunk,2011-01-06 14:11:00,211,Thanks Pikeman for the different perspective. Maybe I should have been more clear with what I was asking... and what I was asking about was Onaman RR. Helps that you've been there.And Solo... Mike. I'll give ya a buzz if entertaining this more down the road. Feeling out summer options still.Thanks again all.
1284677,West Newton River Rat,2011-03-20 18:44:00,128,"I spent last June at Onaman River resort. I took it slow driving in and did not have any problems but the road is tough. I believe it is 28 miles of gravel road once you turn off of the black top (average speed was 10-20 mph). The Lake trout fishing was great with the biggest being 32.8 lbs. I will be going back this spring too. One thing Robert did not tell us until we got there is that it is a barbless hook only lake, so what we did was removed all the treble hooks and used a single hook with a long shank with the barb smashed down then filed smooth (if necessary). Robert did say to make sure you hook is completely smooth or the fish cops will write you a ticket if they can catch the barb at all on a thumb nail. We did not have any trouble at all losing fish with it being barbless."
1255697,Wade B AKA: Ruger2506,2010-12-15 18:03:00,5533,"YES, the fishing is that good. Not to mention, that's why I bought my equipment. If I wanted to use resort equip all the time. I would have saved myself the 10's of thousands of dollars and spent that money on resort fishing trips. Besides, I can't imagine fishing those bodies of water without my Humminbirds. Which isn't a bad idea if I didn't want to fish tourneys and for leisure around home.Dad and I have discussed it and both our boats will be back there on our return trip. I bought it to use it. Like Pete said above. Mainly for Nipigon."
1255730,eyemike,2010-12-15 20:59:00,233,"You can't take your personal boat into Onaman. It is either portage in or fly in. I have many trips into Onaman and it has to rate as one of the best lakes for walleye that I have ever fished. The road going to Onaman is the Camp 40 road and as said before it can be quite rough at times. I have seen $100,000 motor homes in the parking area though so they weren't too worried about dings. Most of the local resorts have a few boats on the lake. They are restricted to the number that they can have per resort. Bauers Onaman Lake Resort has the fly-in on Picnic Island for about $900.00 per person. Time of the year don't seem to matter, just find them. I have fished the lake June, July, August, and Sept. and always caught big numbers. Pike are big in Onaman but the walleye fishing is so good it is hard to not target them. My biggest pike on Onaman caught and released about 18lb. biggest Walleye caught and released about 7.5 lbs. Average walleye are pretty stout running 19 inches or better. Lots of rocks, lots of islands, lots of weeds, lots of eyes.Mike... My Dad and I hauled an old flat bottom boat with a 8hp. motor for years fished waters others only dreamed about. I still have the old boat and motor. My first trip to that area was in 1983 with that boat. Also there is gas in Jelicoe."
1255800,Wade B AKA: Ruger2506,2010-12-16 08:56:00,5533,"Yes, Jellicoe has gas. I didn't figure he wanted to go past Camp Road 4. Not to mention, that is a ""mom and pop"" shop there. It's............beyond words."
