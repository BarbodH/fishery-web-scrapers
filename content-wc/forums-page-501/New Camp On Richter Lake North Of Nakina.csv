1267927,Fergie,2011-02-03 19:20:00,4,Hey everyone I'm inches away from booking a trip to this camp with Eddie North in Nakina.I called him to book his Attawapiskat camp but it's filled for 2011. He's telling me he aquired a lease to put a new camp on Richter lake even further north and will be erecting a new cabin in the spring.He says there used to be a camp on it 20 years ago but it hasn't been fished since.Have any of you guys ever heard of this lake or better yet fished it years ago?Just fishing for info as I can't make up my mind
1267975,TIGHTLINER,2011-02-04 04:17:00,223,We are booked with eddie north for this year. I was booked for 2010 season but due to several money related reasons our group had to cancel. I have talked with eddie several times and emailed him many more. I just want to say what ever this man tells you he can back it up 100%. I have never talked with a outfitter that has been more honest with his business than him. I am looking forward to meeting him and fishing from his camp. Do a search for his camp and name on wc there have been a lot of posts. He also told me of the new camp he is going to open on richter lake and it sounds great. Maybe someone else can fill you in on this lake but just remember what he has told you you can take it to the bank.

It's actually a bit of a gamble imo, but the unknown makes it even more fun for me. I actually had NO idea there was a camp on Richter years ago? If anyone does have any old experiences to share about the lake that'd be great!"
1268138,walleye4life,2011-02-04 16:47:00,54,Northern Outposts out of Armstrong has several outposts in the Attawapiskat River area all the way up to Webequie... all of those lakes are PHENOMENAL fisheries ... (especially northern). With that being said you aren't going to go wrong fishing anywhere up there.... have fun... you're getting into pretty wild country!
1270625,tooski,2011-02-12 09:48:00,393,"Booked Richter for July 9th thru 16th. Hard to imagine you can get on that river system (flows into the Attawapiskat) for $1,000.00. And that's tax included. Solo has asked me to scout the lake for his fall trip there but we haven't discussed wages yet. Can't wait."
1270635,Mike Borger,2011-02-12 10:31:00,1554,I'll be anxiously awaiting your feedback!
1271335,GOBIG,2011-02-15 03:38:00,126,"We are booked with eddie for this aug 27th. We have never fished late season, so this will be an adventure. Only 4 of us are going out of 6 but if we do well we will either book his new lake for 2012 or his original camp. There are some great videos on youtube.com of eddienorths camp. Also, as the days get closer to aug, i hope to hear about the hot spots for the big pike.."
1272326,Fergie,2011-02-17 20:45:00,4,"Thanks for the feedback guys, I think I'm going to take the plunge and book it."
1284146,Walleye Wanderer,2011-03-19 09:37:00,101,"GOBIG, Are you going to Richter Aug27th? I would definitely like to hear how that trip goes. We are going into Attawapiskat the week before so we may meet up at the base."
1284256,GOBIG,2011-03-19 16:15:00,126,WE ARE FISHING THE RIVER SYSTEM JUST LIKE YOU. THE WAY IT SOUNDS YOU WILL BE COMING OUT AND WE WILL BE GOING IN. SAVE SOME FISH. WE WILL TALK AS IT GETS CLOSER..
