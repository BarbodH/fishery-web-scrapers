My question is will I scratch up my 2001 Lund or have you used your own boat and been ok with the sand method.Thanks"
523746,Guest,2002-08-26 07:27:00,0,We were there in June. The sand method shouldn't hurt your boat any. They have added a dock for the camps boats and opened up the original dock for customers. It will dock approximately 6-8 boats.Good luck and write back and tell us how fishing was this time of the year.
