523282,Guest,2002-08-06 07:20:00,0,We are thinking of a late September fishing trip to Northern Lights. It is located a little south and west of Thunder Bay. Anyone have any info on that lake?
523283,Thumper,2002-08-07 19:13:00,133,Good fishing for Lake Trout and Walleye. Not a lot of people on the water at that time of the year.....should do real well. Good Grouse hunting up there as well....
523284,Guest,2002-08-08 09:19:00,0,Thanks for the info. Any size to the lake trout?
523285,Thumper,2002-08-08 14:22:00,133,Winter time to 25Lbs....Thats when most of the people fish for them. Its a pretty big inland lake....be carefull out there
523286,Guest,2002-08-09 07:00:00,0,"Thumper, You have me concerned. What should I be careful of?"
523287,Thumper,2002-08-09 09:21:00,133,"Its a typical larger shield lake, lots of rocks, you are also fishing at a time when very few people are on the water. It is also a lake very easy to get lost on. If you are well organized and equipped leave a route and times when you are fishing and when you are expected back to camp you can fish very safely. Have a good trip."
523289,bellbuoy,2002-08-10 06:05:00,490,It's a great place to fish!Watch out for the logging trucks on the road that leads back to Northern Light! The elder Mr. Miller of Miller's Northern Light Resort was killed when he was hit head on by one! The last 25-30 miles it is a gravel road.Bellbuoy
523290,Guest,2002-08-10 07:25:00,0,"Don't let the size of the lake worry you (or the road). I fish there a couple times a year. I fished in Sept last year and did not have to go far from the resort. The walleye were all down deep, and we could catch them all day. We looked for drop offs in 35-55 ft of water and fished large minnows and leeches and had good success. We fished there once this summer (so far) and caught a few nice fish 26""- 28"" range. Also a few nice Bass.Have fun in Sept..T.Bay Fisher"
523288,Guest,2002-08-10 14:58:00,0,Is this the Northern Lights Lake north of Sag?How is the grouse hunting up there? We are looking for a new place to combine grouse hunting & fall lake trout fishing.Any suggestions on a place to stay?
523291,Guest,2002-09-03 03:59:00,0,Was wondering if there was a good map of Northern Lights. Was up there a couple of years ago and have misplaced mine although not a good map. Has anyone been up the first week in Aug? What to expect etc. Thanks in advance.
