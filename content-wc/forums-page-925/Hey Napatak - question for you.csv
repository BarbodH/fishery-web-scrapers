Going on a fly-in to a private lake in mid-Sept. that only has Northerns and perch. Want to know if there are any walleye lakes nearby.Any help would be appreciated. If you like, you can respond to me by email ([email protected]), or via the board.Thanks.derrek.PS: I'll also post my question on your site if I can find it, in case you look there more often than here.""I'll teach these eyes to see,beyond these walls in front of me""- Bruce Springsteen, ""Trapped"""
523846,Guest,2002-08-28 15:07:00,0,Which Fly-In Lake are you going to?
523847,Peanut,2002-08-29 07:58:00,929,"Called Hill Lake - next to Jewett (sp?), I believe. It's not an outfitter - a buddy of mine got a permit and built his own cabin up there.derrek.""I'll teach these eyes to see,beyond these walls in front of me""- Bruce Springsteen, ""Trapped"""
523848,Guest,2002-08-29 11:11:00,0,I'm not familiar with either of those lakes. How far north of Missinipe is Hill Lake? Is it a small lake (ie. 1 mile x 1 mile)?
523849,Guest,2002-08-29 11:29:00,0,"Forget my last question. I know where the lake is now.Jewett Lake doesn't have walleye, either? I would be surprised if it didn't, but then again, a lot of the smaller lakes in that area won't have walleye unless the feeder creeks and outlet rivers connect to a sustaining walleye lake and/or river.There's Johnstone and Maribelli sp? Lakes surrounding Hill. Maybe those will have some walleye.Sorry, I guess I don't really know.I'll send you a map of the area tonight."
523850,Peanut,2002-08-29 13:07:00,929,"Yeah, Maribelli (however it's spelled) is right beside, I think. Apparently Jewett has lakers, but no walleye. Like you, I was skeptical, but I guess not everything is connected to the Churchill, even though it looks like it should be.Thanks for the offer for the map. If it won't go through my hotmail address, let me know and I'll give you my work email.We're leaving Sept. 12. I'll let you know how we make out.derrek.""I'll teach these eyes to see,beyond these walls in front of me""- Bruce Springsteen, ""Trapped"""
523851,Guest,2002-08-30 08:23:00,0,"I don't think any of the Lakes I mentioned drain into the Churchill system. I may be wrong, but it may be draining to the Geikie system north of those lakes.Regardless, I will send you a map by Tuesday night."
