523810,Guest,2002-08-27 17:20:00,0,Never stayed at the lodge you mentioned but the area is awesome for fishing..... You won't be dissipointed.....If you hunt or ever wanted to hunt moose... thats a great place as well.

We have always gone the second or 3rd week of their season (1st or 2nd week in June). Walleyes galore with an average size around 18-19"". Early season they are shallow 4-8' on just about every wind blown point or rocky shoreline. 50-100 eyes a day was common per man in our group. I will never forget my first day there. Richard took us to Bear Paw. After about an hour we each had close to 12 fish, and he apologized for the slow morning, but ensured us it would pick up. By 1pm the 3 of us had caught and released over 260 walleyes. I was so tired of them I asked if we could fish for notherns! We easily caught another 40 eyes casting big cranks. My boat partner and handled over 700 fish that first week.Great camp too, and the boats and motors are top notch. He runs all new motors every other year.Tracy"
