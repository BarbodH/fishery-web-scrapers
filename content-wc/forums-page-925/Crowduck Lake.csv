523786,Basser,2002-08-26 19:52:00,31,Haven't seen any posts on Crowduck Lk in Manitoba. We have a trip booked there next Aug. Have heard a few reports fishing has not been as good as in years past. Anyone been to Crowduck this summer??

523788,Guest,2002-08-28 14:01:00,0,According to Clancey who is one of the Crow Duck Great Gurus the fishing has been outstanding. Check out this URL. If you can't get there from here then search for the Cats on the Red site and then go to the Fishing Manitoba Chat Board and scroll down until you find a thread on Crow Duck.Cheers!!http://members3.boardhost.com/fishmanitoba/

Asked around, heard it was $180 for the day to Crowduck, that was good for a trip in from Big Whiteshell, and a boat, for you and 2 buddies. $60 each - not bad. I was there with my fiance, she said we wouldn't bother, that I should come back with my buddies. A later date... Anyhow, heard the fishing was excellent in there, over 100 fish a day was easily possible. Have heard, though, that the number of trophies have declined. Everything is cyclical I suppose."

The numbers of fish are incredible, if you hit them right, there will be very little time where nobody in the boat has a fish on.Average size has declined, I guided in there last wednesday and friday. Caught a lot of fish but the average size was 22"" with the biggest being 24.5"" out of about 120 fish per day. Biggest I've seen with my own eyes in there was a 31"" back in late June."
