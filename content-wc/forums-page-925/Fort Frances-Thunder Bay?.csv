Falls/Fort Frances, but wonder if Thunder Bay would be faster/easier? Any advice? Last year was a mess because we crossed just after 9/11.Also, I've noticed several posts about having beer in the boat being illegal in Ontario. Is this a new law, or have I just been ignorant about it over the last 10 years that I've been going? Not a real big deal, but I have been known to have a cold beer or two during a long day of fishing."
523878,tracker,2002-08-29 09:56:00,91,I won't call you ignorant but yes it has been a law for quite a while.
523879,tracker,2002-08-29 17:49:00,91,As for which is shorter it all depends on where in Minnesota you leaving from.

523881,srj,2002-08-30 11:56:00,971,We crossed at I-Falls last Wednesday on the way to Lac Suel. The normal questions and a look at our drivers licenses and we were on the way. It took longer at the beer store than customs. Have fun.
