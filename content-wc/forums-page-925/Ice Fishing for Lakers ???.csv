523922,SD Fisher,2002-08-30 22:16:00,90,"Excuse me for jumping the gun but I'm looking for info on ice fishing for lake trout, possibly somewhere in the Sioux Narrows area. There are 3 or 4 of us that would like to try it through the ice but don't know of any resorts that offer anything. If anybody knows of any resorts that offer any kind of lodging / ice house packages, I would appreciate suggestions. Thanx in advance."
