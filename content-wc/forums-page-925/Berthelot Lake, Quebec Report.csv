523799,Seanik,2002-08-27 07:53:00,218,"Returned from Berthelot Sat. Aug. 24th, 16 hrs on the road in a plush van made the trip easy. The border crossing at the 1000 islands was 5 mins. each way and no problems.The road from Senneterre to the lodge was 70 miles of fairly smooth dirt but 35-40 mph seemed safe.The cabins at Berthelot Lodge were new with 3 small bedrooms, large kitchen and all the necessary equipment. The boats were newer 14 and 16 ft Lunds with 15 hp mercs. We had the meal plan and the food was absolutely 5 star, French style cooking at its best. Fresh baked breads,cakes and pies every day, I would go back to this lodge just for the cooking and the great staff that took care of us.The fishing was good, with so much area available we only fished about 1/4 of it. Pike, one 37, one 32, 2 30's and several 26's and below. The Walleyes were plentiful but small. It was not unusual to c/r 50-60 every day per boat. The big Walleye for the week was 22 inches.This was a great fishing trip at a reasonable cost (680.00 Ca)"
523800,GR8WTHUNTER,2002-08-27 21:13:00,618,Great to hear you made it! Sounds like you had a good trip. What parts of the lake were hot for you guys? Rich
523801,Seanik,2002-08-28 07:57:00,218,"The rapids on the Megiscane river above where the whitegoose river joins was an absolute fish factory, there were times when a 1/4 oz jig produced a walleye on every cast. Rock faces near 20-25 ft depths were good for the bigger Pike and Walleyes and trolling seemed to be the better method. Never got to Maricourt Lake, some of the other guests reported good numbers from there.We had a great time and will book again with a 2 day fly-in to a big Pike Lake."
523802,GR8WTHUNTER,2002-08-28 22:07:00,618,Did you try pike in the whitegoose. I too found it was well worth the run up the river when I was there. Glad to hear you are feeling better. Rich

523806,Guest,2002-09-04 16:32:00,0,"Seanik- sounds like a great place.Hard to find lakes with rivers running into them, great especially in early season. Sounds like you really liked it there. Are you going back? Can you bring your own boat and is there dockage and what do they charge you? About how far did you have to run each day to the rivers and in between the 2 lakes to fish? Thanks in advance for any info. Checked their website and looks god. How were the boats and motors, aluminum 14-16 fters? Well, thanks again. Pete/NY PS- we went to Lake Ogascacane this Spring and caught not a lot but had a good time. Nice place but no rivers in or out to really concentrate the fish.Long runs with 15 ft. glass boats and 15 hp motors. but we still had a good time.Always looking for a new place to try."
523807,Seanik,2002-09-05 05:28:00,218,"PeteYes, I will go back to Berthelot lodge, one of the best all around lakes and outfitters I have been to in 30+ years of Canada fishing trips. You can take your boats to the lodge and the docks are excellent. I would do some pre trip protection to the trailer and boat since there is 70 miles of gravel, mostly to protect from the small stones which eat license plates. The 16 ft Lund rental with a 15 Merc did 14 mph with 3 aboard with gear as checked by gps.I have pictures and more info, Please contact me by e-mail at [email protected]"
