You can go back to the dock and weigh in 2 over 22"" and then release them and go back with two more over 22"". Hence having 4 fish over 22"" (and of course only one over 28"" per angler)"
523897,Guest,2002-09-04 07:14:00,0,Yes you are right my wording is confusing......
523898,gms,2002-09-04 18:48:00,91,Just wanted to make sure you don't come up short if your fishing the tourney!
523886,cnem,2002-08-29 13:37:00,50,"Does anyone have any idea how the fishing is to be on the Winnipeg River this fall. We have been up there 4 out of the last 5 years and we haven't had the best of luck. We kind of decided after last falls trip we were going to go elsewhere this year, but we're not sure we can have the fun elsewhere that we do on the Winnipeg. I remember last fall there were some postings on this site regarding the harvest by both commercial and indian nets, that maybe there were to many large fishing be taken out. Not trying to stir anything up just looking for a good reason to go back to the Winnipeg. Thanks for any replys."
523887,ptdiver,2002-08-29 15:44:00,9,Last year was an off year but it did turn on and off.... Large fish were definatly being caught. Talked to a local last week who has been out and said greenbacks were already in Travers bay north of Pine Falls. Hope its a year like 2 years ago when it was early and and absolutaly unreal for large fish and crazy numbers. I will never take Pine Falls off the schedule it is the most productive lake and river I get to fish.
523888,Todd_NE,2002-08-30 06:14:00,1330,"shhhhh.... there are no walleyes at Pine Falls.... you are getting sleepy.. don't fish there.... there are no greenbacks... you are getting sleepier... think to yourself that a ""big"" walleye is ten pounds..."
523889,Hawgeye,2002-08-30 07:54:00,1355,"Fishing is done there. It has gone down hill starting about 7 years ago til now where it is terrible. You can't catch walleyes there anymore! Oh, yeah, well, by the way, my hotel reservation is up for bid. Starting bid is $200 per night American :) Okay, maybe the fishing isn't so bad!I can't wait for my trips again this year. My first scheduled times are Sept. 26th - 29th and Oct 3rd - 6th. Then, depending on weather and events, I will go again in late October/early November for possibly a couple more trips. We'll see!"
523890,Guest,2002-08-30 23:19:00,0,"you are getting sleepy.... you wanna go instead to fish the Red River........ the ballet is better in Selkirk....the fish are bigger in Selkirk....... the bait to use is red & white daredevils.... don't listen to them canadian guys, they're all beer hounds..... make sure you purchase the ballet dancers C.D rom..... it contains the secret spots that ALL the Sumo's can be caught at........you'll only find out the secret spot if you play the C.D rom backwards..... & beware of Polaroid cameras, they'll steal the soul of Hawgs........HeheheheheGood Fishen'"
523891,Guest,2002-08-31 10:25:00,0,"I agree with all of that but the red & white part, everyone knows it's the five of diamonds"
523894,gms,2002-09-02 15:18:00,91,"Yes we can only hope that it is like two years ago, last year was hit and miss. It was just yesterday I was reviewing the Pine Falls tourney results and how poor the weights were in both the Voyageur and Kim Wilson's tourney. Best days I had were not till late October/November.We still need a good dose of cool evenings to get them moving to the mouth, 31C on this weekend surely won't help.My first try will be September 14th/15th, will report back on progress.Hoping for our American friends things are little more productive, talked to many disheartened visitors last year."
523892,wallidiver,2002-09-02 19:44:00,50,what dates are you heading up this year Todd? I'm also from Omaha and would like chatting with you sometime before you head up.
523893,Todd_NE,2002-09-03 06:10:00,1330,"Oct 18-23, email me at [email protected] - I will be gone most of this week though."
523895,Guest,2002-09-03 14:04:00,0,"Overall wieghts were down but....Don't forget that there are slot limits on the 4 fish per day2 under 22""2 over 22"" and only one over 28"" per person ( for the weekend)There were lots of huge fish caught last year"
