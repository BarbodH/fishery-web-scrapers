524017,Guest,2002-09-04 11:33:00,0,Heading up to Verm. Bay on Friday. We want to avoid the bad roads on 502 so we are going up 71. My question is whether you go all the way into Kenora or is there a short cut from Sioux Narrows to Verm Bay. Thanks. good fishing! PS Web are crossing the boarder at International Falls

524019,Guest,2002-09-05 12:29:00,0,Was wondering how long ago you made the trip and how much of 502 was new road and how much was gravel and under construction. I am going in a week and don't want to shake the truck apart on 502.Reefer Hawg

One small section still gravel but hard and smooth and not more than a mile or two. 60% or more of the road is new now and whats left is not bad....even the gravel piece is pretty good, although probably a mess if raining. I wouldn't be afraid of it."
