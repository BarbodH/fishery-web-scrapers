Last year, the guide was a part-timer hired through the camp.This year, I tried finding a guide on my own. Found a name & good reference on this site, and contacted the man via phone about 1 month before the trip. He said he was available, and interested in doing the trip; ""Call back a few days before you arrive & we'll finalize the details"", he said. So I did, and details were finalized. He even called the camp the day before we were to go, and the camp owner told him I was there and expecting him. I had made arrangements, at the guide's request, to provide breakfast for him the morning of our trip.On the day of the trip, he calls the camp again and says he'll be arriving late due to fog. That's the last we heard from him. I left his phone number in my car 20 miles away at the boat launch, my mistake; so I could not reach him. Even tried the phone co. operator and the phone books there, no luck. This man is a part-time guide also. Afterward, the camp owner told me he has always had problems finding quality guides. He gets resumes from wanna-be-guides, but very few turn out to be good or reliable. The 2 guides he has at the camp were booked solid for the week I was there.So I say; Buyer beware when hiring fishing guides in Canada !! Chuck"

Maybe next time you will find a fulltime guide that has a family to feed and bills to pay. You can also try and book your trip earlyer and get one of the lodges fulltime guides.Keep releasing them allRichard Collinhttp://www.trophymuskiecharters.com"
