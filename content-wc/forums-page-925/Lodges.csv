523979,Guest,2002-09-04 20:15:00,0,"I too am in agreement that this place would be a great place to inform other fishermen of good and not so good lodges and outfitters.I have been fishing Ontario and Quebec for 34 years and have to say that 90% of the places we go or have gone were what was advertised-the other 10%, well sure wish this message board was around then for those places that were not so good! I think I would be more towards listening to some fellow fishermen who have been to a place than I would from a lodge owner at a sports show. They are all there to make a buck and if some of their customers are not happy then let others know about it.Maybe then they would change their act somewhat or loose business.As for the references, 3 years ago, a place sent me a few references and after talking to another fisherman who knew the lodge said the references were their relatives living in the states!!! I have a few good lodges and outfitters we go back to every year or so and some that we would never return to if THEY paid our way!"
523980,WillieB,2002-09-04 20:40:00,292,"Great idea on listing Lodges/Outfitters used during the year, and briefly grading them or list the pros and cons. Definitely a worthwhile project!"
523981,Guest,2002-09-04 20:42:00,0,"I am an outfitter. I read walleye central bacause my guests turned me on to it. Listening to your complaints tells me what we should or should not be doing. I don't generally respond because I like the fact that THIS site at least seems honest. You don't have outfitters going on about how great their camp is.I know of a lot of bad camps and I wish there were people out there to tell the poor sucker who has saved all his life for a fishing trip to Canada that he has picked a dump. You have the experience. What is the problem with sharing it? If it is a personal beef, admit it and don't bad mouth the camp. A really bad camp - that's different. Let people knowDo it."
523969,Guest,2002-09-03 05:48:00,0,"I have been going to Canada for over twenty years and have visited ten lodges, we like to move around. And with the exception of one place where the fishing was good but not what we were looking for, I would go back to everyone of them. I think the idea of lodge police sucks and the guy who is suggesting that there be a way of reporting lodges on the net better never have the stupidity to announce his plans at the Canadian boothes at the sport shows. He must be retired, his wife should give him something to do. Ontario camps are great."
523970,Guest,2002-09-03 14:33:00,0,"Carl, I agree with you . We have been to many camps and only got stung once with the accomadations ....but we still caught plenty of fish . Ontario and all of Canadas lakes that hold Walleye are the greatest place on the earth to have a great time with your buddys."
523971,Reels,2002-09-03 16:46:00,2876,"I dissargee. I know people that stay in broken down shacks with people less than nice, just because they dont know any better. I was one of them! Sometimes we need our eyes opened as to what to expect and what else is out there.<{{}}><"
523972,Walleye Wacker,2002-09-03 18:39:00,6,"Reels, Try doing some investigation before you go to a Lodge. Get a list of people from the Lodge who used the facilitys the week before you want to book and the week after for years prior. This way you get your list of references instead of the Lodge Owners. Call all these people until you feel comfortable with the information. We have done this many times and it works. You can not only find out about accomadations but gather some nice data on fishing."
523974,Rick,2002-09-04 05:58:00,226,"Carl is so touchy about this, you have to think that he is owner of one of these inferior camps. Or maybe he just likes leaky roofs on mice infested cabins with torn screens so the mosquitoes can have a smorgaboard while you sleep. And overflowing outhouses so full that you have to use the woods. Lets not forget the rotten docks and leaky boats with motors that only run part of the time, if at all. And if you think I'm making this up, I'm not. There are 5 other guys that will attest to these fine accommodations. Maybe Carl thinks this is par for the course but our group has slightly higher standards. That was our first and nearly our last trip, but since then, 15 years ago, we discovered that most other outfitters also have higher standards.90-95% of the camps and outfitters up north are hard working, honest businessmen trying their best. But for the ones that are there only to rip off unsuspecting fishermen, there should be a way of getting the word out. And the internet is is the perfect medium.If the owners of these dumps knew that they were being rated on a website, maybe some of them would clean up their act or face business extinction, like the dinosaurs that they are. By the same token, the good ones would be rewarded with more business. What's wrong with this?"
523975,Guest,2002-09-04 12:42:00,0,"Hey Rick, here's the answer. You already got a site to name the bad outfitters. Right here buddy. You can mash any lodge you want right here. They do it all the time, so why do you need another. This is a great place to do it cause it has a lot of readers. So go to it."
523977,Guest,2002-09-04 12:45:00,0,"Rate them right here. You have got the perfect place. What more do you need. Nobody would care, so go for it. Do it on walleye central, it's perfect. Just what you are looking for and right under your nose."
523976,Rick,2002-09-04 14:22:00,226,"I don't think the objective of rating lodges is simply to ""mash"" the bad ones, even if some get ""mashed"" in the process. Let's face it, some deserve it. At the end of this fishing season, this might be a good place to start a poll of the outfitters and lodges that were visited over the summer. I don't personally have the expertise or time to develop a separate site dedicated to lodge rating, but viewers here should have enough experience to share the names of lodges, both good and bad. I think we'll find most are good, but for the few that are nothing more than borderline crooks, eventually the spotlight may cause them to retreat back to the holes they crawled out of. After our first trip, we've since had good experiences with three different outfitters and have heard of many more good ones. I'll gladly share info on the four that I've used."
523978,oneforseed,2002-09-04 16:47:00,65,"i agree,do it right here.it would sure save me and i'm sure alot of others alot of time/trouble checking all of these places out.we are trying to plan a trip for next june/julyand we sometimes wonder what is true and what isn't.i always ask the lodge owners if it's okay to ask about them on walleye central,so far all have said sure/ok.this only after checking them out somewhat before asking for their brochures. ""one for seed' jim/co"
523973,Reels,2002-09-04 17:36:00,2876,"I agree doing your homework pays off. I have learned the hard way and have found many wonderfull lodges. The problem with personal refferences is that if someone has been staying at the same place for fifteen years, you dont really know any better. It is kinda like when I use to live in Chicago. I drove to work 10 miles a day, took an hour sometimes an hour and a half. I was ok with it, because thats all I knew... well now I no longer live there, I wonder all the hours I could have been fishing instead of sitting in traffic....Just a though.:-)<{{}}><"
