Our weather was the usual Canada mixture of rainy days, sunny days, some strong wind and the occasional dead calm. Fortunately, the windy days were midweek so our boat rides in and out on the Saturdays were good. None of us had ever fished the Chamberlain Narrows area before, so the owner, Ken, sat down with us several times to mark fishing spots on our maps. We headed north from Chamberlain Narrows every day. Our best results were in Wapesi Bay, Pecker Point and In-a-bit Out-a-bit past Birch Narrows. We used minnows and jigs all week. Fishing was good but not great with many of the fish being small. The walleyes were not very aggressive. Sometimes you would get a solid hit, but most of the time you would have to wait through several taps before maybe connecting. Biggest walleye was 26"", but there were a lot of small saugers. My boat's best day was 55. I move around a fair amount and like to check out the lake. The best days catches were by the two oldest guys in the group who sat on Pecker Point all day for two days and got 64 one day and 72 the next. Admittedly, we were jigging for walleyes, but I was surprised how few northerns we got. There were three days when nobody got a northern. One great northern on the first day was 40"" but the next biggest was 29.5"" Fish were caught anywhere between 10-30'. We got most of ours from 20-25' but the Pecker Point boys fished mainly 16-20'. While fishing Pecker Point we saw a huge muskie at the surface 3 times but it wasn't interested in anything we had to offer. Other highlights of the trip were a great northern lights display, watching an otter swim around the dock one night, and ""the bear"". There had been a bear coming around camp and it was on our deck one night. The camp tried ""banging"" it away several days but it wouldn't give up. Five guys in our group stayed in one cabin and three of us stayed in an attached smaller cabin. The next night we woke at 3 AM hearing a guy from our group next door banging pots and yelling ""Get the *&@# out of here!"". The bear had come up onto the deck and broken a window trying to get in the cabin. The next morning everyone surveyed the overturned grills and garbage cans around camp. That was the last straw and the bear was shot the following night. The camp facilities were good, although the mattresses in our cabin could be replaced. Ken was very helpful putting us on fishing spots. His assistants, Sam, Betty & Kirk, took good care of us. Kirk would let us know he was going off duty for the night but to knock on his door if we needed anything. Several cold, rainy days Betty made fires in our stoves so the cabins were warm when we returned. So, now the September trip is in the books and it's time to start thinking about next June."

5131577,jimirjr,2016-09-28 13:15:00,1149,"Sounds real close to My previous report... LOTS of 23"" - 24""+ Eyes... REAL FATTIES ! Not so many Esox.... These fish were VERY FEISTY and fought real well.. Camp exceeded what We had all imagined... Weather was for the most part, stable... One really Sunny day, but a bit windy..."
5131938,stjoeguy,2016-09-28 18:26:00,979,"milfish, have a good time! Water temp, as I recall, was low 60's."
5132105,Rich B,2016-09-28 20:45:00,1081,"StJoeguy, Thanks for the detailed report...sounds like a fun week with enough fish action to keep everyone's attention....no doubt that bear got everyone's attention as well (bad news for the bear - ha). Rich B"
5133010,milfish,2016-09-29 09:50:00,249,"Thanks StJoe Guy, This is about our 25th trip up to Chamberlain. The fishing and the camp are as good as I've ever seen. We usually pick up a few Northerns and a musky or two with 2 boats for a week. Hoping for water temps in the mid or even low 50's but it is what it is. Seems like in the past when we've had water temps in the low 50's the bigger fish seem to put on the feed bag. We haven't been down to Wapisi in a few years but maybe this year. We always spend a bit of time in Birch Narrows, Pine island and once in a while down to Bear narrows for a change of scenery. Last year we were checked by the Ministry three times. Prior to last year, maybe 3 times in 20+ years. They are always polite and check for licenses, dead fish in the boat and nothing in the slot. Oh and of course no alcohol. Sure do miss a cold Blue at shore lunch. Makes you want to travel back to camp for lunch for a cold one with your fish fry. I will post a report upon our return. Fish On!"

We never saw a CO on the lake all the years we went and I still haven't been checked on the water in 30 years of fishing in Canada,but I bet I would be if I make it back to Chamberlain Narrows.
