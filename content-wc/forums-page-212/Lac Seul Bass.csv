Went out to lac Seul last week with bass on my mind, they school up on top of a reef i know and provide non stop action slip bobbers and jigs as usual, worms and minnows, all around 10' to 18' FOW.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2LQT9ANr6I"

5130018,packpro,2016-09-27 18:04:00,695,love that boat. Is it new this year? Great fishing set up. I hear the road to Lac Seul can be nasty. Looks to be the right size to make the trip. Very nice fishing set up. Keep them coming.
