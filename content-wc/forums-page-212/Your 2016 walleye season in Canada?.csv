5130841,BornToFish,2016-09-28 08:31:00,1224,"Greetings, I just returned home from my last trip to Ontario for 2016. While driving home, I reflected on my entire season of fishing in Ontario. I rate my walleye fishing in Ontario during 2016 as being very good, both in terms of numbers and size. The only thing that kept me from rating the season as being excellent was a slow start for my fishing trips at the beginning of the season and the finish of the season. The middle of my walleye season was phenomenal. My season started out a bit slower than normal. The walleyes left their traditional places near the spawning grounds in the early weeks of the season. It took me a few days to locate the fish, but I sure made up for lost time when I found them. I fished traditional depths at the start of my most recent trip in autumn. It took me a couple of days to realize that the walleyes were unusually shallow for this time of the year. Again, I quickly made up for lost time when I focused on intermediate depths of water near traditional structure. How do you rate your walleye fishing in Ontario during 2016? Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5130881,johnboat,2016-09-28 08:46:00,2014,"Quick question. What time frame are you meaning as the ""middle"" of your season?"
5130905,tv4fish,2016-09-28 08:54:00,2694,"I would rate our trip this year (4th week of June) as very good - not excellent. We have had better years, but still not about to complain..........."
5130921,BornToFish,2016-09-28 08:59:00,1224,"Greetings, I made four trips to Ontario this season. My first trip was in May, which I refer to as being the beginning of my walleye season. I made two additional trips during the ""middle"" of the open water season - in July and again in August. My last trip of the 2016 season was in September. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5131009,stjoeguy,2016-09-28 09:34:00,979,"June trip to Lake St. Joseph was good. We battled a mayfly hatch for the first time. Numbers were down but the size was good. The September trip to Lac Seul was good, but not as good as the June St. Joe trip. It was a new lake to us. We caught less fish and the size was smaller. Both were fun trips with good crews, however."
5131097,johnboat,2016-09-28 09:53:00,2014,"Trip #1, 1st week in June was possibly the top trip in 16 straight years. Caught my personal best, along with 3 over 27"", 5 over 26"", and more overs than unders for the entire week. And caught numbers to boot. Was unreal!Trip #2, Sept 12 - 16, fished 4 days with the wife. Different lake, Algae bloom, fishing was poor/fair. Mama did catch a 26.5 walleye. I caught more Smallies than Wallys. Not many Walleyes over 16 but the Smallies were mostly 18"", with 2 over 19"". Did eat fish every night but wasn't close to why I go to Canada. (But will.still go again yet year. Lol)"
5131305,Ricky Spanish,2016-09-28 11:24:00,1298,"First trip was 5/25 - 5/30. I had never gone so early, so I had no idea what to expect. I was not disappointed. Pretty easy fishing, finds weeds = catch lots of fish. 2nd trip was 6/16 - 6/25. This is our usual time but I found fish were not in their usual spots. Also, not where we had left them just a couple weeks before. Fish seemed to be in between the shallow weeds and the deeper humps we normally target. Catch a few and move when it slowed was the ticket for us. I probably would have been disappointed if I was not familiar with the middle part of Eagle Lake. We had a ""free"" guide for a day, and I only contribute the higher numbers that day to the extra person fishing, and the fact that I didn't have to do anything but fish."
5131593,packpro,2016-09-28 13:58:00,695,"Excellent trip for our group. Walleye- Numbers were up. Size was up. Not as many 22""-24"". Few More 25""+Pike. Same as always. Everyone caught their 4 take home slot fish fishing for walleye. 1-39"" and 2- 37"" . Quite a few just over the slot. When located and targeted. It was not stop action. Smallies- Size and numbers up. Found them in quite a few new locations. Musky- not in season for us, but had a few (beautiful coloration) hit our smallie lures on rock reefs. That was new for our group this year Happened 4-5 times. All in the 24""-26"" Hoping they grow into monsters for the Musky guys.Lake Trout. Always plentiful. Mostly cookie cutter 22""-24"" Great table fare when prepared fresh. Found them high in the water column upon arrival then deep later in the week. Limits for everyone after 1-2 evening sessionsPerch- Catch them all week while fishing for walleyes. Then we target them for 3 hours later in the week. Everyone takes home approx. 20-25. We say it every year. ""Hard to beat this"", but every year it gets better."
5131761,kzoofisher,2016-09-28 15:55:00,5144,"Late August trip, numbers of fish was average and size was above average. Did some exploring and found a number of new spots with one of those having a local on it the next time we passed by. Encouraging. More big smallmouth (17""-19"") than in past years. Kid got lake trout working a deep break and has now caught at least one of each of the game species in the lake. Great northern lights, a wolf on the drive out and great company. No trees fell on my car while I was fishing. Yaaaayyyy!"
5132145,Rich B,2016-09-28 20:59:00,1081,"Two trips up north....1st for the Spring Opener week to the Cedar Lake chain (Vermilion Bay) was the best fishing week that I have experienced. Every day hit nice walleyes up to the low 20s, and 2nd day had a 29 1/2"" take a big swimbait beside the boat. Hooked into large Musky, and nice pike as well as quality fish everyday...and they were very shallow, which made it a great experience (I like to cast the shoreline). My fishing buddy hooked into 2 large Musky (both over 50"") though neither saw the net...I brought one in about mid-30's which was fun but nothing like the ones my friend had on. Late on the last day I had a huge Musky on that I could not bring up or turn, and fought the fish for 10+ minutes (followed it with the trolling motor)...would have enjoyed at least seeing that fish (had it on a heavier spinning rod with braid). My 2nd trip was to Tunnel Lake (NE of the Soo) the 1st week of August with my wife. Hot, Hot and Hotter all week...while we enjoyed the week and being on the lake as we had it to ourselves (until late morning then too hot), the fishing was slow. We did catch enough walleyes for 5 fish fry's, though nothing like we have experienced in other years. SM Bass fishing was fun on top water baits (fish over 4 lbs) and caught one nice heavy 30"" pike. So I'd give my first week a 10 and the 2nd week a 4 (for fishing), so overall I would rate my Canadian ""fishing"" year a 7.....though both weeks were a 10 for the experiences. Faith, Family, Friends......and fishing. Rich B"
