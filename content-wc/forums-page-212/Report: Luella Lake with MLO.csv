Don and Sandy could not have been more accommodating and really know what motivates guys like us. Ryan, our pilot was awesome and really loves his job. Austin gave us some good tips about how to fish the lake. The cabin was adequate and served us well. The crew made sure our water tower and gas tank remained full for the week. We had our choice of three boats/motors and probably selected the slowest and the motor was cold blooded, but we were never left stranded although one time when the gas line came unattached Doc rowed us about 10 feet on the 5-8 minutes it took me to figure out what the problem was. The fishing was adequate, but the walleye bite never provided a true ""honey hole"" experience. The 22"" walleye was pretty standard, but we managed to eat walleye most days since we caught the occasional <18"". The biggest for each of us was 25"" We found traditional jigs and lindy rigs were less favored than ""Stackers"" which became our go-to rig. Stackers have a jig on the bottom and an additional hook that holds you 10 inches or so off the bottom. Fortunately we bought half a flat of crawlers and used most of them. The portage lake was nice and we caught nine there. However the weather turned that day and we left when we couldn't feel our ears. The trail was well marked but due to the consistent rain I had my shoe stuck in the mud and off my feet twice. One nice feature of Luella Lake is the concentrated lake trout in the ""Trench."" The only experience I had with them was to net two in the 29-30"" that Doc got to bite on his giant Daredevle spoon with white twisters on the hooks. It was a lot of work jigging for them and we had to choose calm days to pursue them as they were still deep. The pike were mostly on the northeast corner of the lake. We casted and trolled for them but couldn't scare up anything bigger than a 31 1/2"" One other unique feature of the lake is supposed to be the availability of brook trout in the outflowing Atwood River. The brush was very thick and timber was all over the ground which really prevented us old geezers from finding a place to fish from. After about an hour and one bite and one pike, we gave up on the brookies. As I said it wasn't a great lake for numbers, but we liked the variety. We recorded 106 fish It is an east/west lake so there were times it was like a wind tunnel and hard to fish at all, but we still had a great time. We were supposed to fly out Sat. morning about 8 a.m., but we could hardly see the trees through the fog. We finally got out Sunday afternoon about 2, putting us way behind schedule and making our arrival back home early Monday. At least we got an extra day in the woods! We would go back to Luella, but with all of the different experiences available In Canada, I doubt we will. However, we will always have the memories we made. Fish On! Hooks"
