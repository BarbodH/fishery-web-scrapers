5123714,Baseline,2016-09-22 20:39:00,3207,"Walleyes wil be on reefs down to 30 FOW and points with deep drop offs. I'd start knocking holes in the water on likely habitat and you will run into the walleyes. Nice thing about LOW in Oct is that the crappie fishing is in full stride. The area around Hay Island and into Stevens Bay are excellent crappie areas. It's a nice way to add to a good trip. Weather can be down right beautiful to cold, windy and miserable, so go prepared. I was going next week, but I'm on the IR list now with a back issue. Hope it clears up before the season gets too late."
5130674,steve.a,2016-09-28 07:07:00,274,Plan change. Going up to Nestor Falls this Friday. Are the Walleyes still on the mudflats? Any reports on the crappie?
