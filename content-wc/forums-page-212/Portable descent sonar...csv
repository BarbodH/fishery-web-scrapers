A looked back a couple of years ago to see my transducer flopping in the wake and it had pulled enough slack in the cord to be able to tangle in prop, fortunately it didn't. I also now use a clamp mount when running as a portable. Very good advice for those who have not yet donated, or come close to donating a transducer to the cold depths of a Canadian lake!"

Very good advice for those who have not yet donated, or come close to donating a transducer to the cold depths of a Canadian lake!Perhaps you Guys DID not clean the scum from the transom well enough? I have used the ""suction cup"" type mount with a string attached to the grab on the back of the transom at least 20 times and have NEVER had a problem... I know if you mount it on a ""dirty"" transom... it will bring problems... ALSO.... ALWAYS attach the safety cord so You wont lose it if it comes loose..."

The outfit provides 12v batteries... obviously I can't drill into their boats to attach transducer etc..would like one with dual freq,maybe depth images and one I can setup in an hour or less on camps boat. Any recommendation? Would like to keep it around couple hundred cost wise..."
5116329,eyemike,2016-09-18 08:14:00,233,"I use a Lowrance Elite 3 color portable and a Sully transducer bracket.It comes with a suction cup for transducer, I like the Sully better. All said and done about $225. Takes 5 minutes to hook up, gives you surface temp. My first trip with this set up was this year and I couldn't be happier. Before This graph I used a Eagle Magna portable for years that served me quite well, I just modernized a bit."
5116513,1K1MOA,2016-09-18 10:32:00,90,"Garmin Strker4DV about $170, love it! Has GPS and Chirp, used in Canada last year and it performed great in many different lakes with depths to 170+' Small and portable but easy to view. Swivel base could easily be clamped which allows unit to pivot front/back, up/down (standing or sitting)."

New model, just came out in 2016.http://www.humminbird.com/Freshwater.../PiranhaMAX-4/http://www.humminbird.com/Products/PIRANHAMAX-4-PT/You might be able to get a good deal on it's predecessor, the Humminbird Piranhamax 197c.You might be able to get a Humminbird Helix 5 Sonar within your budget. You'd have to ""make"" it portable though. Which is easy to do.http://www.humminbird.com/Products/HELIX-5-SONAR/I really like the Raymarine Dragonfly series as well. The Dragonfly 4DVS should fit your budget, and maybe even the 4PRO.http://www.raymarine.com/view/?id=11...=155&col=11251"
5116969,rzep,2016-09-18 18:03:00,1196,Thanks for the info....sometimes too many options can give you headache.....I am just glad I have entire winter to figure it out....in terms off pecking order - are certain brands better than others? In terms of product quality?
5117041,Bstar,2016-09-18 19:34:00,564,"I know this is above your price range but Cabela's has a great deal on a Humminbird Helix 5 DI GPS with navionics+ for $349. I just ordered mine yesterday. You can easily make it portable. The Sully portable transducer mount also works great just be careful not to extend it too far into the water. Do a search on YouTube for ""how to make a portable fishfinder"". The kayak fisherman have a lot of great solutions for their portables.http://www.cabelas.com/product/fishi...Tz_stype%3DGNUhttp://www.cabelas.com/product/Porta...nt%26CQ_st%3Db"
5117353,h8go4s,2016-09-19 06:39:00,1673,"Any sonar can be made portable. You don't need to buy a kit. All you need is a plywood box to mount it on and a battery. In your case, you won't need the battery. Screw the transducer to a piece of 1x4 and C-clamp it to the transom. Add a screw eye to the 1x4 so you can tie a safety cord between the board and the boat in case the C-clamp comes loose."
5117553,grizzley,2016-09-19 07:53:00,2518,"Another ""portable"" unit. This one has the ice ducer on it, but I could put the regular transducer back on it with a transducer bracket and use it on any boat I own."
5117833,rzep,2016-09-19 09:42:00,1196,"Looks like I will have project for winter and copy h8go4s design ... even though I do not need battery for the fly out, I will likely get one for a test run in the spring on local lake, just to get feeling for the unit .. whichever one it is ...Likely I will get Sully for transducer as the price seem reasonable ..."
5119722,Bill Krejca,2016-09-20 11:16:00,6107,"My first/last transducer which was attached by suction cup is at the entrance to Obabikon Lake. After that, I purchased a portable clamp-on bracket from Cabela's. The feller using it maybe didn't tie it with the cord provided, I'm not sure if the cord would have secured it anyway. The feller is now older and wiser. It wasn't me, I'm just older. Bill"
