5120202,SinOrSwim,2016-09-20 14:58:00,1528,Very good. they all are. Fishing much slower than usual but we were getting used to a new lake and the weather was all over the board. cold rainy etc. I did take a day trip to Cliff with ProV and caught my first ever lake trout. That was fun. We boated 3 of them and then casted for musky for a bit. Got a couple follows and he had one hit but no fish.
