5112849,Lmbkiller,2016-09-15 12:42:00,639,"Ok let's come at from the ""adult"" side like gord said, only I'm goin to use a different species than muskies. I think walleyes should be protected from 0-28in. After all, they're a really fun fish to catch. And how do I put that again, ""u adults need to learn u can't have whatever u want all the time"", the resource needs to be conserved"
5113097,prov1800,2016-09-15 15:24:00,5010,"Hey cmon man what am i going to eat.29-30"".yuk.lets protect all walleyes over 18"".ill go along with that."
5113113,kzoofisher,2016-09-15 15:35:00,5144,I sure hope that your work in stocking and netting fish doesn't mean you are a biologist because you appear to have very little understanding of the roles that walleye and musky play in the environment. And if the was an attempt to seem less ridiculous you should try again. Both species are managed to optimize their benefits to society while maintaining their biological health. Because they are radically different species the management styles are radically different.
5113337,Lmbkiller,2016-09-15 20:00:00,639,"Hard to explain to people that don't get it like your self. How many people in the angling population do u think fish for musky? Or walleye? Trout? Or panfish? Basically no one keeps muskies or fishes for them, many more fish for walleye and harvest them. Panfish are at the top for angling and harvest and it's not even close. Give me a good reason why there should be so much emphasis on, and protection of, muskies. I have a biology degree and have been in fisheries 11yrs. U sound like u eat up ""company lines"" from fish biologists that u have either talked too, or read their publications. Tell me why muskies are so worthy of protecting that they are basically a catch and release fishery. Tell me why walleyes can't be the same. Just because it's been engrained in society over a hundred yrs that walleyes are for harvesting and muskies are for trophies means nothing to me. Like I said, in the grand scheme of fishing, hardly anyone fishes for them anyways. Walleyes need lots more help than muskies do. Perhaps someday people might realize it. Besides, do u honestly think that all fish biologists think the same? Or don't put their interests in certain species, ahead of others? Or have the same opinions regarding management of a certain species? Unless u have worked in fisheries for quite sometime u and others would have no idea about it. Almost every biologist has a certain specie they really focus their work on, and all of them think they and only they, know it all. U can't learn everything from a phone call or reading, sometimes u have to be rite in the middle of it"
5113417,yoopertrout,2016-09-15 20:45:00,1172,"If you must post arrogant nonsense, please don't identify yourself as a fisheries employee. The DNR/MNR in most states get bashed enough without your help. There are so many flaws in you facts and logic, it's really hard to know where to begin, but here goes: 1. You say ""basically no one keeps muskies or fishes for them."" You either don't know what you are talking about, or you don't know how to avoid undercutting your own argument by over exaggerating. Many people fish for muskies. 2. You say ""sometimes you have to be rite (sic) in the middle of it."" You may think that your B.S. in biology gives you the sole right to have an opinion, but you are wrong. 3. You don't seem to see something that is incredibly basic in the fisheries world - that fishing regulations and voluntary catch and release are informed not only by biology, but also by the needs and wants of citizens. Fishing regulations involve social issues. Muskie fishermen figured out that muskies grow very slowly, don't exist in very high numbers, and provide great sport. They decided to let them go, so they could enjoy their chosen sport more. Trout fishermen in many places made the same decision. These guys realized that they couldn't always have their fish and eat it too. They realized that they spend thousands of dollars on fishing not to fill the freezer (the grocery store would be cheaper) but because they love to fish. Your implied argument that because few people eat muskies, few people love them is backward and self-defeating. Few people eat muskies precisely because they love them. 4. If your goal is to argue that there should be more catch and release for walleyes (something I don't dispute), you sure picked a helluva way to get your point across - by peeing into the tents of all of the musky fishermen. On the other hand, if you are just trolling, head for a lake. They aren't frozen yet."
5113481,Lmbkiller,2016-09-15 21:37:00,639,"I don't care for muskies and I'm not trying to keep it a secret. I will continue to pee on their tents as I always have. Besides, like I've said before, isn't this site called WALLEYE central? I don't know any musky forums because I don't care for those fish. No trolling here, just giving a different view point. I'm done with hot weather and ready for the ice. At least we agree on the most important thing, more catch and release of walleyes. Have a good rest of your evening and keep on keepin on"
5113545,kzoofisher,2016-09-16 04:13:00,5144,"No need to repeat what yoopertrout said very well. I will add that I agree with both of you; walleye in some areas are overfished and limits need to be lowered. In other areas they are just fine. More and more people are limiting their catch but the change comes slowly, just as it did with muskie and bass and trout and stripers and marlin and tarpon and....... Muskellunge are a native fish and an important part of our angling history in the North. Are they the most numerous fish? Hardly. Their rarity is part of their appeal. They are increasing though and a big part of that is catch & release. Not that many years ago they were not released and they were over fished, just like walleye are in some areas now. Why you object to releasing muskie but promote it for walleye is a mystery to me. Judging fish value primarily on popularity is a bad idea. Walleye are stocked in many lakes where the habitat is not suitable for reproduction and they are not native. Should this practice be stopped because bass are far, far more popular than walleye? No, it shouldn't. So long as the introduction of non-natives is not overly detrimental to the natives there is no reason to discontinue the practice. Bass are far and away the most popular gamefish in the country when you look at hours and money spent on them. They are also common in all of the lower 48 states. They have many, many more forums and tv shows dedicated to them than our northern cool water species (though Muskie Central is in the menu at the top of this page). And almost no one keeps them to eat. Using the metric of consumption to judge a fish is ignoring the elephant in the room when it comes to popularity."
5126666,yoopertrout,2016-09-25 15:53:00,1172,Thank you. There are room for all the species of fish that we have.
5126674,yoopertrout,2016-09-25 15:55:00,1172,Beautiful fish!
5116657,youngknight,2016-09-18 12:45:00,228,"Not sure if lmbkiller is just an internet troll or actually believes what he is saying. No need to challenge further on his biology knowledge . However, he isn't the first to get his undies in a twist because someone dares talk about a species different than walleye because this is a walleye site. Perhaps he can look on walleye central and right beneath the ""Canada eh?"" Subject heading you find what? Let's look...ahhh...a Muskie section. Now let's read a number of Canada eh reports and note how many ppl talk about non-walleye species....many of which make for an overall great trip in addition to the great tasting, plentiful yet poor fighting walleye. Certainly someone with a degree in biology has the ability to read a title that says ""fly fishing Muskies "" and be able to deduce that this discussion is not about walleye but instead Muskies, then show reasoning to determine that if they don't want to read an article on Muskies that they can....wait for it....simply not cluck on that story and choose not to read it. My 7 year old niece is able to figure out that if she doesn't want to watch golf on tv, she can determine if a show is on golf...then she simply does not land on that channel. Perhaps lmbkiller needs a lesson by her how to avoid things that do not interest him. Sheesh!"
5118793,castnblast,2016-09-19 18:00:00,111,"Thinking this thread is about fly fishing for musky... If i am wrong, mods, please feel free to move the reply. I am actually surprised that more walleye anglers do not fly fish for pike and musky. Im not a ""musky guy"" but always have a fly rod in the boat when fishing walleye. In june the fish are shallow, super agressive and are reckless toward the fly. It is a great way to break up a day jigging or god forbid trolling all day for wallys. You dont need to cast far, or with any precision. All you need is a 9 weight single hand rod, some big flys to strip in and a shallow warmer water bay. It really is a no brainer and makes for great fun watching these big fish rocket up and slash at the fly. Seriously, these campfire stories beat the heck out of "" i lost a 12 lb eye at the boat bla bla blaa""This is a photo if a thunder bay angler named josh, who is a 21 year avid angler. He guides out of andersons on lac s and he is a **** of an outdoorsman. He very well may have taken out some of you folks on the wv board. His uncle is a fishing buddy of mine and is a well known BC steelhead fly fishing guide who has been a huge influence on this young and talented fisherman.Anyway, here he is with a fly caught lunge in the 50"" class. So ya, fly fishing for musky (and pike) is a blast and adds a new dimension to your day on the water. I highly recommend giving it a go."
5124202,NP4ME,2016-09-23 09:48:00,378,"yooper, Our views are often opposite, but you hit the nail on the head here. Very well put, sir. As I said before, lmb, your statements are far beyond ridiculous. I'm a bit surprised, but maybe I shouldn't be, that you would post such drivel."
5102713,mms3rd,2016-09-08 09:34:00,148,"This month's Minnesota Conservation Volunteer Magazine had an article on fly fishing for muskies. One of the flies looks like a dead rat. Thought this might be interesting to some. This made me think about if I'm doing damage to fish when i use light tackle and have to ""play"" the fish to boat it. At the same time when I see muskie fisherman land a big fish in a few minutes, it doesn't look like that much fun."
5103265,yoopertrout,2016-09-08 16:42:00,1172,"Good points about quick release and tackle. The first musky that I ever caught on purpose was on a fly. I quickly decided fly fishing for them was way too much work (for me - to each their own.) I switched to conventional tackle, and bought a rod heavy enough to fish a pounder bulldawg. I quickly decided I don't like fishing lures as heavy as firewood, and the rod was taking the fight out of the fish. I ended up with a little bit lighter conventional rod and I'm happy with it. I know bulldawgs and spinners with garbage can lids for blades take big fish, but the aches in my middle aged arms took the fun out of it."
5103345,Lmbkiller,2016-09-08 17:37:00,639,"Sorry, u lost me at muskies.....they are for guys who 1: don't like to eat fish 2: don't like to clean fish 3: don't like to catch fish. Easily the most overrated fish that swims. In the grand scheme of angling no one fish for them, yet there is so much emphasis put on them. Isn't this site called walleye central? The slogan should be ""the only good muskie is a dead muskie"""
5103393,yoopertrout,2016-09-08 17:51:00,1172,"I used to feel the same way about muskies, but the follow, the strike and the short but hard fight are a thrill. To each their own. I used to fish almost nothing but trout. I liked to wade streams, trout are beautiful, figuring out what fly is a challenge etc. etc. Now I realized that: 1. Finding walleyes, perfecting the method and finessing the bite is a fun challenge. 2. Smallies on a fly are a great fight, and time off from small tippets and lots of fly changes. 3. Bluegills are just plain fun. 4. Crappies, see 3 above. 5. Steelhead are a challenge, beautiful and a great battle. 6. Muskies - see first sentence. It's all fun, one way or another. It is true though, that if you enjoy a fish fry, or faster action, muskies aren't the best way to go. You just have to do what you like best."
5103473,Lmbkiller,2016-09-08 19:10:00,639,"I handle 1000s of muskies so I admit I'm a bit jaded toward them. The one thing that really irks me is that they are becoming a catch and release fish only. I see absolutely 0 reason for that. Nothing makes them that special. Say a kid catches a 38"" fish. It's the biggest fish he's ever caught, and wants to keep it. Sorry son, not in wi, size limit is 40""."
5103609,v-bay gord,2016-09-08 20:00:00,3168,The kid needs to learn he can't have whatever he wants......just like a lot of adults. Stocked musky aren't that special......real ones are in my opinion. If you fished for real ones you would not be handling 1000's of them.
5103769,Lmbkiller,2016-09-08 22:18:00,639,"Surveys and stocking gord, that's why it's 1000s. Fyke net caught adult muskies are not fun to handle. Stocking extended growth muskies, not fun to handle. Muskies in general, not fun to handle"
5105057,yoopertrout,2016-09-09 17:46:00,1172,I agree. No tragedy in a child learning to conserve the resource. More tragedy in a child learning that he gets whatever he wants. Or not learning anything due to having mercury in his system.
5105169,That Minnesota guy,2016-09-09 19:07:00,8293,"If we wanna talk about species we can. Everyone knows you can't tell the difference in taste between a properly prepared Pike & a Walleye. Therefore I suspect people started fishing Walleyes because they were easier to fillet. Pike will also give you a much better fight. Muskie are a great game fish, one that takes your breath away with those slow follows and menacing eyes."
5112745,NP4ME,2016-09-15 10:51:00,378,"If that's not the truth. lmbkiller, Your statements are ridiculous (nice way to put it) at best."
