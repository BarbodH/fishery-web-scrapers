5130937,NWwalleye,2016-09-28 09:05:00,223,"I have guided for them, for the past 25 years. Just not full time anymore. I am on call and usually only guide days that as I am requested. There are 2 other full time guides in camp as well.. Jeff who is a very good guide and Stan who is also a great guide . Both have many years experience in this line of work .Book a date and request me and I will be there .. If my schedule allows.."

5131865,NWwalleye,2016-09-28 17:50:00,223,"AS for guides.. If there is 4 of you it will be and Jeff .. 6 people and Stan will be involved .. Expectation .. there will be plenty of Walleye action most fish will be in the 16 - 18 inch range with a few bigger ones in the mix to make it interesting .. .Muskies are few and far between, you had talked about Pike .. There is a very good population of those with several fish in the 24 - 30 inch range, again there will be a few in 35 - 40 inch range ( I usually target the bigger Pike using my Musky equipment and lures ), I have put a few bigger ones in the boat every year with the biggest being 45 inches this year.. So, you might want to bring some big gear if you are interested in those. As for Lk. Trout .. Big Canon has a very good population of them, most are 2 - 5 lbs, but there are some trophies in there. I have boated a few in the 20 lb range and have seen them bigger. It also has a very good Smallmouth Bass population and we can target those as well .. There is also a big Walleyes in Big Canon, patience is needed, but the chance for a 30 inch plus is there. Fishing is fishing and as lomg as we are on the water, there is a chance to have a fishing day or week of a lifetime ..I'm positive you will have a great time and I will do my best to make it truly memorable !!! Looking forward to meeting and fishing with all of you .."
5127737,packpro,2016-09-26 10:56:00,695,"x2. This one checks off all of your boxes. Great variety of water. You can catch 26+"" walleye and 37+"" pike. Not every fish, but a few each day. Having the right guide will be key. We have never fished with Kenny, but he is always in camp with another group, and that group is always the happiest. Great guide and a great personality. When we see him on the water he is netting fish. That is important when you are going to be in a boat all day. He has a great rig for that body of water. Been going to this camp 19 years. The fishing, size and numbers gets better every year. This year we noticed a big increase in size and numbers of smallmouth. Quite a few 19"" fish caught while fishing for walleyes. Can't imagine what we would have done if we were targeting them. There are a few trophy walleye spots. They are hotter in early spring and fall, but we catch quite a few 24+"" just fishing the numbers spots. We have seen more muskies lately, but we go when they are out of season so I can't help you there. Camp boats are good 18' Lund outfitters with 25HP Motors. That rig will get you to all the spots in 20 minutes or less. 35 min tops, if you go exploring. You will get two boats, One on the lake and one on the river. Both the same. I have only seen one trophy lake trout caught in the many years of going there. The numbers for lake trout are good, and you can catch them jigging with your walleye gear when they are deep. Or, you can catch them trolling cranks when they are shallow. Even our rookies catch (and love to catch) LT. They are a nice bonus fish and we typically target them in front of the camp in the evening. Cookie cutter size 22""-25"". Great eating. The food is restaurant quality. The portions are huge. They have one housekeeping camp if you decide to bring your own. You will be passing up some great smoked meats and homemade desserts. Price seems to be in your ballpark."

5128185,johnboat,2016-09-26 15:05:00,2014,I can't imagine spending 2 grand a piece for 5 days of fishing Canada. We all want weeks like you are looking for. Trophy this or trophy that. But it doesn't work like that. Yes I know you can hedge your bet somewhat but sometimes it just doesn't happen. I've put a 16 year streak together going to Canada and have had some weeks like you are looking for. None have been bad but some are better than others. And I have never spent more than 800ish and that includes food booze and souvenirs.
5128489,1700SS,2016-09-26 18:21:00,104,Exactly what Johnboat said!
5126090,Skywagon,2016-09-25 05:15:00,1106,"Crackback: what ""the tank"" was trying to tell you is that csuram stated in his post that he had been to Lac Seul, but was looking to fish a different lake, so that takes Silver Water Wheel (a great camp) out of the picture. It sounded to me like he was looking to get the highest quality experience he could for $2000 per person or less and is asking for suggestions as to what camps might come close to fitting their needs."
5126122,The tank,2016-09-25 06:27:00,340,I've fished that area many times. My only thought is why are they so stinking high?? I always wanted to stay there just to see what makes them that much higher or better then the other camps around but just can't see spending that kinda of money on a week of fishing that's not a fly in. Not judging anyone on what they spend or where they stay; so nobody get all bent out of shape. That's alot of money to fish lac suel.
5126154,The tank,2016-09-25 07:09:00,340,I would suggest Hawk lake lodge but it's the same as silver water wheel for cost wise. More then 2 grand for a week. Ive Never been there just talked too those that have and sounds great.
5126314,NWwalleye,2016-09-25 09:43:00,223,Big Canon Lake Lodge ..http://www.bigcanon.com/If you book .. make sure you ask for Ken as one of your guides ...
5127033,Crackback,2016-09-25 23:41:00,257,"I agree with you 110%......but them again P.T Barnum supposedly said, ""There is a sucker born every minute."" If you have any fishing skills at all, Lac Seul is very super easy to fish without a guide. Everybody must also realize that flying into any lake doesn't mean the fishing is good or catching many trophy fish is guaranteed. Believe it or not, Lac Seul is still being flown into remote cabins on the north shore. $2000 per man is not going to get what these posters want. Any fly-In American plan Lodge with guided fishing every day costs more than $2000 per man. Heck, Any fly-in Lodge in Northwest Ontario will charge at least $200 per day just for the guides of even questionable ability ! For 6 days that will run $1200 just for the guide for 2 fisherman. Throw in the flight time, meals and lodging, fancy boats ...... and you are looking at least the low $3000 mark if the lake has even mediocre fishing quality. Now they demand trophy 20 plus pound Pike, 10 pound walleyes and 20 pound Lakers and unlimited smallmouths with arm bending fish fights from sun up to sun down .......$2000 per man just isn't enough money! If they do get hoodwinked into somebody's $2000 guided trip and they fail to overload the boat in trophy class fish....Guess what? ....they will be right back here looking for more cut rate trips......I hate to be blunt, but fishing demands at that price point don't exist....if they do somebody is going to be disappointed and it is always the fishermen. I would add, a short 4 day trip is not realistic because you know there will be rain days. Even a good fly-In housekeeping modern cabin on a good trophy quality lake with 14-16 foot boats with 25 hp motors will start at $1500 for a week. Everything in today world costs money and this includes trophy quality fishing trips with all the ""trimmings""..."
5127113,rzep,2016-09-26 05:16:00,1196,"Maybe there is sucker born every minute but websites such as this help you make educated decision and hence increase odds for successful trip. Whatever ""success"" is for particular person. If I read multiple reports over multiple years of place where fishing is OK and you are treated right, I will be more likely to explore them further. It is fishjing, there is no guarantees."
5127409,The tank,2016-09-26 07:30:00,340,Crackback I'm starting to agree with you. I haven't looked at fly in trips or American plan trips in years. It's going to be hard to find quality fishing with guided America plan for $2000. Goodluck csuram i hope you and everyone finds what they're looking for.
5127625,csuram,2016-09-26 09:10:00,18,guys thank you so much for your responses PLEASE keep them coming...i should have siad the 2000 per guy was for a five day fishing trip not one week. on the fish side the walleye don't need to be trophy but would like 22-24 but catch tons of them...we would like the pike fishing to be 37inch on up with all of us having a shot at a 40inch or more...the rest of the species would be a bonus...but we do like catching lake trout on our walleye poles...thanks again we really appreciate don't stop giving us ideas...csuram

If you find that perfect place please .. Oh please !!! Post where it is .. Cause I want to fish there as well ... In my 50 years of living and guiding in this area, I've yet to come a perfect spot/lake/Lodge that will do what you have mention as requirements.. I though, have fished lakes that will produce the walleyes you are after, but not the pike requirements and vice versa .. As for Lake trout ...

5123418,Bowtech84,2016-09-22 15:59:00,572,"My uncle and his family have been going here for ten years. I recently joined the group/trip two years ago. The fishing is amazing. The lake is considered a trophy lake so you can't keep any walleye over 22 inches but you catch a lot (ten a day per boat is not uncommon) of 25""-30"" fish. Not sure on pike regs but I think it's 33"" and under are keepable. That might be a deal breaker for ya but just thought it was worth a mention. Trailer the boat about 5 miles to the river and you will catch all the eaters you want. Bait/no bait, literally you get sick of catching them. http://www.moaklodge.ca/Site/Welcome.htmlSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"

I know some fishing neophytes who couldn't catch a cold and they caught 27 inch and bigger walleyes and many over 37 inch pike. You get what you pay for. Of course you could go to some northern Saskatchewan fly-in Lodge and pay $5000 a week and have it all right? The poster wants trophy EVERYTHING but his budget requirements are set way too low.....
