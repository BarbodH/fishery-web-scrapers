Hidden Bay was generous enoubh to offer this trip for a Church auction fund raiser! Tom Elam was the highest bidder, he took, his father, Denny, brother zchris, and his 10 year old son Hunter on this adventure! Vonnie, Shaggy, and Wilma, took care of all of our needs, Denny has an above the knee amputation, so mobility was a concern, Tom and Shaggy worked to pick the camp with the fewest steps, Armit Lake it is! Shaggy has a ramp at the base camp so geting into the plane was pretty easy. Great customer service as always! An easy , but long drive to Fort Frances, easy border crossing and a nice meal at the Copper River Inn, the old Adventureinn, getting a facelift! Hidden Bay has cabins for the pre-flight nights rest, very comfortable and a great view of the dock, some pike and smallmouth caught off the dock was a good way to get warmed up! All our gear, and the food for the meal plan loaded up quickly with everyone pitching in, a 40 min flight and we were ""home"" for 4 days of fishing! Wilma marked a map for us, the couple flying out, left a map marked up too! Weather was not a real factor, some windy day, some some, some rain mostly at nights, didn't slow down our fishing, or Hunters cabin schooling homework! The walleyes in this river system, a very dark, black and blue coloring, still very tasty, and they are very strong and certainly fun to catch! They are a handful!!! Salted minnows worked best on cloudy day, live minnows were the ticket on sunny days! Good to have a backup plan! Windy points worked best, there were serveral places we missed on the map, just not enough time for exploring! The cabin and docks were fine for our group, boats and motors not an issue! The biggest pike was 30 inches, Denny caught that off the dock in his wheel chair! Yours trully had the first and biggest walleye-24 in. The last day of a trip is kind of bittersweet, knowing you had a great week of fishing, never seeing another boat crowding your spot is always a perk! Great food, Tom did most of the cooking, an introduction to walleye cheeks, and good fun around the dinner table make for some good memories! Shaggy flew us out, a sunny day, after clearing the water, he said lets find some moose for Hunter! Sure enough, just a few moments into the fligh, he banks the Cessna Carvan over to fly by a bull moose and a couple of cows! I can't say enough about the customer service Hidden Bay offers, great people with a good operation, Thanks again to the HBL crew! I hope to fish with them again!"
5116641,BreezyPoint,2016-09-18 12:40:00,1581,"Sounds like agreat trip, Dave, and yes Hidden Bay is a great outfit, and I would recommend them too!Frank"
5120338,Skywagon,2016-09-20 16:44:00,1106,"I took a quick peek in the Armit cabin a couple of weeks ago, very nice! I also want to chime in to say what a great crew they are at Hidden Bay Lodge. They bent over backwards to help me out in a bind recently, when it would have been easier not too. I would highly recommend to anyone, to give their outposts a try."
5120642,DaBirdman,2016-09-20 19:23:00,164,"We'll be going thru them in 2018. Long, long time to wait. I've had lots of email conversations with Shaggy. What a great guy! Hope he is our pilot when we go."
5120730,wallydave,2016-09-20 20:15:00,2151,"Which lake are you going to? Yeah that's a long wait, you will get some good info here, Shaggy is a cool guy!"
5121250,DaBirdman,2016-09-21 08:57:00,164,"I wish I knew! Since their current year customers get first dibs on the following year's reservations, we have no idea yet and won't know until December 2017. But here is our order of preference: 1. Miniss 2. Blackstone 3A. Armit 3B. Gage Half of us going love walleye fishing, the other half pike. Which is why Miniss & Blackstone are atop our list."
5122162,wallydave,2016-09-21 20:13:00,2151,"I'm thinking Miniss if you get the chance! Lots of hot spots close to the cabin, wild blueberries in front of the cabin, nice cabin, the cathedral ceiling gives the impression of greater space. Armit was nice to, cabin was fine, plenty of room, less steps if that's an issue. Probably can't go wrong with any of them. Shags will take good care of you! Good luck!"
5122410,DaBirdman,2016-09-22 00:39:00,164,"I would love for it to be Miniss! Or Blackstone too. Both are nice size lakes & IMO probably put out better size fish. Armit is a decent size lake as well and Gage looks long, narrow and easy to navigate. I'm no expert or even novice on any of the lakes since we haven't been to any of them, but the bigger the eyes & pike, the better. How were the numbers for your group on Armit? Catch lots of fish? Do you get a view of the sunsets from the cabin?"
5122466,wallydave,2016-09-22 04:16:00,2151,"Armit and Miniss both have 3 bedrooms, the bedrooms are bigger at Miniss. We had 3 guys on Miniss, 5 at Armit. Numbers wise , Miniss was better, but we had a couple of more days to explore the spots there than Armit, we had more wind and sun at Armit, both were the week of Labor Day.. Sunsets, Miniss might be better, Armit had some good sunsets too! Shaggy told us the docks were going to be replaced this year, no more foam floats, black plastic floats instead. I have had just two trips with HBL, so no expert by any means, Shags will help you with the planning, have a good day."
