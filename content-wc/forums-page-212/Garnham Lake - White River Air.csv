5133106,Crackback,2016-09-29 10:07:00,257,Wrong...what you don't know is the Canadian government doesn't check. It is a Fact that Gourlay is easily accessible as is many other lakes. Logging roads are now going to many fly-in lakes. The last time I went to Gourlay was in 1987 and we towed in a boat with dead motor to some guy's tent camp site and they flat out told us that they drove 4X4 pickups to access this and many other WRA Fly-in in Lakes all over the area. Satellite imagery now shows you the roads they are using. When you fly-in you can see the access roads. The Lumber industry is taking its toll on what used to be lakes that were only accessible by float plane. WRA knows that! This should be no great surprise to anyone.
5133162,adempsey2.0,2016-09-29 10:33:00,612,"The remote tourism lake designation is relatively new and the reasons you state are exactly why it was put into law. Logging roads going into these areas are to be decommissioned as well, with some exceptions. Regardless, people can be charged if they access the lake with a motorized vehicle. Enforcement of the laws, well that's another thing entirely. I have no idea about the ""Trophy"" status, or even the current fishery status, of these lakes but these new designations should only help to improve the fishery.I won't argue that NW Ontario, and even our other provinces and territories, offer spectacular fishing opportunities that can outshine those in the more densely populated areas of Ontario. However, the difference between a 10 and 20 hour drive (or more) is often hard to overcome. Not to mention the additional overall costs, both from travel expenses and the outfitters. Especially considering you can have an amazing trip without doing so."
5133226,Mike Borger,2016-09-29 10:49:00,1554,"I don't mean to be contrary, and frankly I don't really care one way or another, but Adam is 100% correct.Yes, many fly in lakes especially in NE Ontario have rough bush road access (almost never right to the lakes shore though). These roads are heavily signed and patrolled by the MNR. You cannot use them to access the outfitter lakes. Perhaps more people did use them a number of years ago? I don't know. Few if any do now I can say that for sure. The risk of getting caught is high and the fines are huge. Don't you think if an outfitter saw someone on one of his camp lakes who accessed it illegally he wouldn't report it? Very few people take the chance.The winter is another story altogether as tons of locals use snow machines to get into the lakes traveling through the bush to ice fish them. It's pretty much a free for all in the winter.Regardless the quality of the fishing is very good in the fly in lakes I've fished in NE Ontario and there have been a bunch.Just for fun here's a trip report from a good buddy of mine who took his family to Gourlay Lake a couple summers ago. Gourlay is a White River Air lake that's one of their most popular. No one's saying these lakes are as good as the bigger lakes in NW Ontario, but they're still pretty great especially considering the price. http://www.canadafishingguide.net/fo...ite-river-air/"

5133634,adempsey2.0,2016-09-29 15:15:00,612,"I am trying to figure out if that is still the case or not. The phase III revision (it's now in phase V) of the CLUAH project included this:Â• Selection and modification of final option (i.e., designated remote tourism lakes to receive year round protections instead of seasonal, restrictions on motorized access, reduction of size of Designated Remote Tourism Lakes Areas). Of course, it's a government document so not easy to decipher. So, that might just be in regard to forestry services machinery and not public access. I have no idea."
5122770,gordy28,2016-09-22 08:34:00,437,Hey there Looking for any info for those that have had the opportunity to fish Garnham Lake with White River Air I have done multiple searches and while I notice people have gone to Garnham I cant find any reports How's the fishing? Feel free to PM me if preferred Cheers Gordy
5123410,pikeandtina,2016-09-22 15:59:00,145,"Gordy, check w/Mike Borger."
5126002,123chadder,2016-09-24 22:26:00,429,you should try dayohessarah
5126050,Crackback,2016-09-25 02:48:00,257,"My former group went there once back in the 90s as I didn't like the lake and went to another, Lac Seul. ...Garnum had small fish and not very many of them. Of all the 1000s of lakes to fish in Ontario, Garnum would NOT be one of them, If I were you I would pick another lake and get out of that over fished Algoma area and drive to Northwest Ontario. But then again, that's just me and 40 years of fishing Ontario."
5126226,123chadder,2016-09-25 08:25:00,429,"white river area iscnw ontario,no?or do you mean further nw? dayohessarah is a great lake with some giant fish!we got a 27,24 and a 22 pounder last year...and hundreds of 2+ lb lakers...ask dan to do a split trip,half a week in dayo and half a week in Hambleton for pike and walleye,thats if Hambleton isnt booked that week actually,you should pm me...."
5127002,Crackback,2016-09-25 21:05:00,257,"Further West...Like 200 miles north of Fort Francis, or Rainey Lake and Lake of the Woods. White River is only 4 hours north of Ste Saint Marie, Ontario. on 17. Northwest Ontario starts west of Thunder Bay, Ontario."
5128377,gordy28,2016-09-26 16:44:00,437,"Thanks guysChadder. We are not trout fisherman so I think Day is out. To be honest if doing wra we want the indoor toilet that pickle, shekak and Garnham offer. Thanks for suggestions though!CrackbackI hear what you are saying. Did a different trip this summer north of Wababakimi with Wilderness North this summer and the fishing was greatInvestigating fly ins out of Nakina or Armstrong for our next trip but added drive time or flying to Thunder Bay doesn't work w everyone's schedule between work, kids and budgets but your input is appreciated Thanks Gordy"
5128481,Mike Borger,2016-09-26 18:01:00,1554,"Pretty sure you'd love Garnham! Brand new cabin last year and the regulars with WRA are all over it. (prime time booking could be difficult) There are some youtube videos of some VERY large pike caught in Garnham, I do believe its their best trophy lake. It's also probably very seasonal, being only really good early in the season.Walleye would be good all year.I would tend to agree the larger lakes in NW Ontario are on another level, but much like yourself I still fly into NE Ontario lakes for the very same reasons. It's still a fantastic experience, its closer to home so a shorter trip is feasible and the price is lower."
5132418,Crackback,2016-09-29 06:07:00,257,"Garham has been fished hard for the last 25- to 35 years back to the 70s and no fisherman in the world goes to a fly-in camp just because there is a nice new cabin. They go to catch fish and unlike you Mike, I remember when Garnham had just a side wall cabin with a tent roof over it back in the 70s. White River doesn't have a trophy lake because all their fly-in lakes have been fished hard FOREVER....as their best lakes are now accessible by logging roads and flying in isn't what it used to be. Go WEST and use your hard earned money to fly-in there. ""Regulars"" Mike? My group was ""regular"" since 1973 and they left in 1994 and I left in 1987 because the fishing was bad as finally WRA started replacing those worn out OSB shacks they had in McCoy, Gorlay and Shekak."
5132890,adempsey2.0,2016-09-29 09:16:00,612,"All lakes used by outfitters in the area are Designated Remote Tourism Lakes. Part of the definition includes no motorized vehicle access permitted to these lakes year round. You can still fish these lakes, but you have to walk 1 to 2 km (1/2 to 1 1/4 miles) to get access to the lake.http://www.ebr.gov.on.ca/ERS-WEB-Ext...tusId=MTkxMDg2"
