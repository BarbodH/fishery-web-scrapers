5120330,That Minnesota guy,2016-09-20 16:38:00,8293,Struggling big time to find Pike & Walleye. Any and all help appreciated. Only here a few more days.
5120474,martinbns,2016-09-20 17:50:00,1520,"In the north end of the lake, we had trouble finding much of anything until we moved into areas with current. We also switched from minnows and Leeches to worms and had way more luck."
5120962,BT Rig,2016-09-21 06:48:00,24,"Not sure where you have been fishing but my suggestions for Walleye fishing in that area of the lake would be to try Regina Bay and Long Bay west of Whitefish Narrows. If you can make longer runs, the areas west of Yellow Girl in the Sunset Channel area. There is decent Pike fishing in the very south end of Whitefish Bay. Hope that helps."

5121202,LOW1,2016-09-21 08:22:00,2828,Where have you been trying to catch them? Go to spots for us this summer for walleye were south side of Chisholm Island and to the west and the standard humps in Yellow Girl Bay.Caught some Pike down the west side of Smith and Twin Islands.Whitefish Narrows area might work.Good Luck.

5121258,srk-low,2016-09-21 08:58:00,78,Whitefish Bay is a large area. I just got back last week after my third time up this year. If you want to narrow down to a smaller area I suggest Cross Inlet for your larger pike. We always have consistent luck in Log Bay. Troll the edge of the weed lines for the walleye and cast into the large weed bed at the back of the bay for pike. If you are on the south portion of Whitefish you can't ho wrong around Bell Island for the pike. Good luck.
