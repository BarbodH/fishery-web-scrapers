We caught a LOT of large fish!Walleye were prolific and almost everywhere on the lake, although generally on the smaller side. We barely fished for them.My nine year old son Brendan was my boat partner on this trip and I know it's one he will never forget. Besides all the big fish he caught, something happened that I'll refer to here as simply ""the incident"". You'll have to read the story to find out what happened, but needless to say it involved a true test of endurance and good dose of true grit. For anyone who's interested you can see the full story here, as always with lots of photos and video clips!Cheers, Mike http://www.canadafishingguide.net/gi...he-lowlands-2/"

5104817,Mike Borger,2016-09-09 15:13:00,1554,"Thanks! And yeah, considering the time of year the numbers were good. I usually only catch numbers like that early in the season."
