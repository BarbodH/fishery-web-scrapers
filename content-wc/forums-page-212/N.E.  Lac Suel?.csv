5112593,milfish,2016-09-15 09:26:00,249,"Dave and Jim, I'm heading up the Lac Seul Outposts on the 30th for a week. Any reports that you can give me upon your return would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!! Milfish"

One of which was in 25 mph winds. It sounds like their trip has been going well so far. I haven't heard where they are picking up the most fish on the trip though. PjShorthorn"
5117889,illineye1,2016-09-19 10:13:00,5,"Just got back from the eastern side of L.S,( lost island camp) fished four days.. Had water temps between 66-64 for our stay. Caught most of the fish between 22-26 ftw. Found bigger eyes the last day... main lake reefs with deep water nearby. 25.5 incher, biggest from our group but there was a 30 caught in camp the same day. Good luck and thanks again PJ"
5117961,pjshorthorn,2016-09-19 10:39:00,5654,"Glad you had a successful trip. How did you like the lodge? I've heard really good things about the place,but never stopped in to check it out. PjShorthorn"
5117993,David Anderson,2016-09-19 10:45:00,2073,"Well, just got back on Saturday, fishing was OK for us but not the best we've had, although not complaining! Asked at camp if there was a guy from Colorado here and he said yep, cabin 3 so I introduced myself to a fellow Walleye Central guy, Jim, nice group. For our 3 days it was 2 in Wapesi and one day in Tuk. I am a big Tuk fan and we did had our best day there. I know it's easy to say you got over 100 fish but I put counters in my boat and we got 70 that day (100 is a lot of fish!). As the last poster stated, 20 feet next to deeper water seemed to be the best. Caught a lot on plastic twister tails as often the bite would be hot for an hour then die, Cabela's Action Tail grub, bubblegum/chartreuse was my best color. It rained the day we arrive then bluebird skies for 2 days then rain on Friday so the weather was not very stable. Still better than being home! Good luck and post your results."

The REPORT .... First, We found the CAMP, well run, clean, the STAFF was GREAT !! and KEN, a ""character"" to say the least ! LOL! They anticipated Our needs BEFORE we needed to ask! Thanks again, SAM, and KIRK ! Fish were on FIRE as soon as We figured the pattern out. Although the ""bite"" was VERY LIGHT, once We adjusted, it was 50 - 75 fish per boat per day. Probably 2/3 of those were in or OVER the slot and We got at least 2-3 Eyes over 24"" each day per the group. Biggest were a 26.5""; 2 - 26ers"" 5-6 at 25"" and numerous 24""+ Fish... They were mean and ugly ole farts too boot ... lol! We were just amazed at the GIRTH of these FAT PIGS !! Took a trip to WAPESI on Tuesday, which was VERY GOOD to Us... seemed like ANY point with wind blowing into it held numerous fish at 18' to 24' !! We got eaters all over the place; Quality fish were found between 19' and 23' on the windy side of points and islands... OR in between islands and in current areas... We even caught some NICE fish on the ""lee"" side of the points.... Got a few PIKE to boot, although We never targeted Them, We found them to be very hard to find.... Biggest was 28"".... nothing to brag about.... rather strange, in Our estimation... We usually get more large PIKE as a bonus while fishing for EYE'S.... All in all, it was a trip to be remembered by ALL of My Guys !!"
5118521,David Anderson,2016-09-19 15:34:00,2073,"Jim, We ended up in Wapesi both Wed and Friday. Here is the 40 incher I got up where the Wapesi River comes in the lake: You are correct, all of the fish were fat and plump. Maybe see you next year!"
