5119642,The tank,2016-09-20 10:42:00,340,"In mid august when we was up there we had some of our best days for over 20"" walleyes under the thick algae in 18ft of water in the mud flats. Had to use the net to sweep the green stuff away before you could see the fish to net it."
5123234,rockpt,2016-09-22 12:55:00,589,Flats near the neck down areas from about 8 to 16' are good in October. Mid lake humps and points aren't as productive as in the summer.
5123674,LyleK,2016-09-22 20:06:00,248,Thanks ! This is all very helpful.
5125202,Lotw1,2016-09-24 02:26:00,36,I got home last night from a 4 day trip and found walleyes on 28-30ft flats and a mix of nicer walleyes and small mouth in 12-14 ft along points adjacent to deep water.
5118865,LyleK,2016-09-19 18:52:00,248,"Anyone have any insight into Fall walleye patterns in the Morson, Ont area? Not looking for spots but some general patterns to look for when fishing walleyes in October. Thanks in advance"
5118866,mt hook,2016-09-19 19:14:00,65,"Hope to see more, im leaving on Fri. I herd there is a big elegy bloom right now.That makes fishing tough, always looking for clean water."
5118898,johnboat,2016-09-19 19:36:00,2014,"I was there last week. Algae was so bad in spots the wake coming off the boat was almost black. Fishing was tough. Wife did catch a 25.5 walleye. I had better luck with smallies........but was jigging for walleyes. There was a cold front that week but was supposed to be warming back up. We ate walleye every night, but it was still tough fishing. Was only there 4 days and was just me and Mama so we didn't hit it very hard. If the weather settles down youll be fine."
5118914,birddogger,2016-09-19 19:54:00,43,I have always heard and found true that current areas and points are good for fall fishing that area of LOTW. Sometimes off midlake humps produce but I don't try that pattern enough to judge. Depths can vary.
5118986,Lotw1,2016-09-19 21:22:00,36,I'm heading up in the morning for 4 days to see what's biting. Like others have said I always try current areas 1st this time of year. If nothing there I'll move to points or reefs
5119026,LyleK,2016-09-20 04:44:00,248,Thanks to all for the input. Appreciate it !
5119162,Bill Krejca,2016-09-20 06:59:00,6107,"Re: algae - That seems to be fairly common this time of year for the area. The water in that part of the lake is never as clear as Whitefish, for example. Not always a bad thing, perhaps a little better walleye bite during the day, as they don't seem to bite as much past dusk. Bill"
5119282,mt hook,2016-09-20 08:08:00,65,"Algae (spelled right). For me the Morson area algae bloom is the pits! I think it scatters the fish, you willpick up one or two here and there but no real numbers. best a guy can ask for is a good stiff east/so.eastwind to blow that **** out. Years ago the bloom was in late Aug. to mid Sept. now it seems to hang onfor ever.ILL start with the normal spots, 25 fow with a point. Hope for a wind blowing across the point, thatalways seems to help. If not, im off to find some clearer water."
5119322,Obabikon,2016-09-20 08:17:00,2370,Walleye right now have been relating to mud for the past 3 weeks. If you know of any mud flats that are from 18-30 feet deep... that's where you'll find them.
5119330,LyleK,2016-09-20 08:18:00,248,Thanks for the updates/info - it is appreciated.
