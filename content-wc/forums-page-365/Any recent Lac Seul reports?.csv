1972393,Guest,2013-07-22 17:46:00,0,"Headed up to the NW section tomorrow night. Wondering how the cold front has affected fishing the last few days? It felt like October in NE MN today. Every mid/late summer trip I have taken to Lac Seul in the past has been during tyical steady warm weather. Any advice for a wet cold front on Lac Seul? We're set up for all kinds of fishing and we'll obviously be up there figuring things out on our own via trial and error but any heads up would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance, happy fishing."

1987218,bus33,2013-07-28 08:17:00,289,We just got back from the Ear Falls area. Fishing was pretty darn good. We had to do quite a bit of sorting but ended up doing very well. Our best bite was in 16-20 fow around Goose Island jigging minnows and leeches. Best time for bite was mid morning then late afternoon/evening. Good luck!
