1974290,downriverbob,2013-07-23 08:47:00,880,I would highly recommend that you utilize a guide any time that you go to a new body of water. Take a map of the area along and mark it. The knowledge that you obtain can speed up the process for you. As some of the other posters have said it will also assist in you having a safe trip by pointing out danger areas that you might encounter. BOB
1974442,Lovetofish,2013-07-23 09:19:00,458,If it's not a real big lake you should find plenty of help here. And bring along good set of binoculars.
1974562,LOW1,2013-07-23 09:48:00,2828,"The only downside is the expense. If you can handle that why not hire one for the day?And don't be afraid to tell the guide what it is you want him/her to accomplish. If you want to become orientated to the lake, tell him/her that and they can show you around and instruct you on a number of locations and techniques. This may mean that you catch less fish with the guide, but you may learn more.And hire one who knows how to cook a good shore lunch, especially if you have kids with you. A guide-cooked shore lunch is just one of those things that you should have at least once in life."
1975490,Bakefish,2013-07-23 14:14:00,1077,"I've been going up to Canada for many years and until recently I've shied away from hiring a guide. No more. When I go to a new lake now, I hire a guide for the first full day. I make it clear that I'm more interested in fishing spots, danger areas and local techniques than I am in catching fish. I also let them know that we are to take my boat and I will mark the locations on my gps. None have disagreed so far, in fact they are happy to find out they are not using their own gas. Knowing that I'm interested in learning the lake from them and not piling up the fish also takes the pressure off of them. It's worked out very well for me and has saved me a lot of time learning the lake. I tip them as if we were using their boat and equipment. One guide wouldn't even take our tip because fishing was really bad that day. He even showed us his secret spots that ended up saving our week when the cold front that greeted us left it's affect for the entire week. Overall, it's well worth the money."
1975578,camp chef,2013-07-23 14:36:00,915,X2..... We made friends with a guide that we had used for our first time on the Winnepeg River and several years later he saw us sitting in a little canyon of backwater for several days in a row. As he was with customers each time he waved and kept on going.finally one evening after he was done with his client he came over to our cabin for a beer and to inquire why we sitting where we were as that was not a place that typically held fish. with the water level very high we told him we had spotted a strong Back eddy and stopped to fish it. Best Walleye fishing we had had ever up to that point.He laughed and promised to stay away until we left which was only a few days. Still good friends till this day.
1977273,1-shot,2013-07-24 08:15:00,35,Thanks for all of the feedback. I think I will try to hire a guide on the first day if available. I'll post a report after the trip.
1971713,1-shot,2013-07-22 14:38:00,35,I was just wondering how many people hire a guide on their Canadian trips. I will be fising on Lake Wabatongushi for the first time in August and this will be my first time on this lake. Was debating whether to hire a guide or just wing it myself and wondered what others take on this subject is.thanks 1-shot
1972009,Skywagon,2013-07-22 16:07:00,1106,"A good guide is money well spent, in my opinion. I would inquire as to who the good guides are in the area. He should share information on the lake, what structure to look for fish and where some of that structure may be located, as well as what baits seem to work best. Your fishing time is too short not to use all the tools available to maximize your productivity, the guide is just one of those."
1972073,NARDA 1,2013-07-22 16:21:00,636,What Skywagon said!!!!
1972105,Mike Borger,2013-07-22 16:28:00,1554,"I'm not totally against the concept of guides, but honestly walleye patterns are pretty predictable in the summer. That combined with a good depth map of the lake and some pointers on where to go from the lodge and I doubt you'd have any problems catching fish on Wabatong."
1972257,phishfearme,2013-07-22 17:01:00,1242,what solo said!
1972265,Jaskonie,2013-07-22 17:03:00,80,I would bet their guides will show you a spot or two you wont find on your own. Some of our guys got them as part of our package at Loch Island last year and it paid great dividends both last year and this year.
1973097,2746,2013-07-22 20:45:00,3206,"I assume you will be there most of a week. You can find your own spots but it will take 2 or 3 days of experimenting and talking to the lodge or other fishermen. If its worth a couple hundred dollars to you to save those two days then hire a guide. It would be to me.....others might disagree. Call your lodge ahead of time to arrange or, if no lodge, call the local bait shop for a name and number."
1973618,troutwater,2013-07-23 06:22:00,299,"I personally don't like to hire guides, but I understand why people do. Our group goes up for muskie mainly and we enjoy the challenge of finding spots and patterns on our own...makes it more rewarding for us when we do contact fish."
1973786,Stu,2013-07-23 07:15:00,472,"I completely agree with Skywagon. When I fish a new lake, I always try to hire the lodge owner (or sometimes even the dock boy) to take me out for a few hours the 1st day. Not only do I learn a few good spots, but they show me how to navigate the dangerous areas. One lodge owner refused to charge me because my 10 year old son and my wife were with me and it was their 1st trip to Canada. It's that kind of attitude that creates friendships and keeps me coming back. I made it up to him by inviting him and his wife to dinner and gave him a healthy tip when we left."
1974050,tv4fish,2013-07-23 07:53:00,2694,IMO - THAT might be the most important reason to do it if it IS your first time on an unfamiliar body of water.
