Water level is high but dropping while we were there, allowed us to use a cut area to quickly access some areas that would otherwise have taken a very long time to reach. A stump in the cut not visible the first day was showing ~8"" by the time we left.Fishing was hit or miss, the weather was spectacular for sunbathing, not so good for fishing. When it was on, it was great, when it wasn't it was one here and one there. Trolled worm harnesses all week until we ran out on Thursday night (issue with Cabelas on the number of worms as we normally have several hundred left over). Mostly chartruese, green/yellow Colorado blades working. First day did see a number of fish caught on a silver willow leaf, but we ran out of those quickly as well. Friday was terrible weather with wind and chop and great fishing. The morning saw 5 fish 20+ inches boated along with several 18-19 inchers on crankbaits. Color didn't seem to matter, the bite was on! Caretaker did better than us most of the week pulling in 2-24"" one night and one that he didn't give a length on but weighed 6 lbs (we did see the remains) the next. He fished on his own.Overall a great week in spite of a few obstacles. Cannot believe how good Canadian beer tastes on a hot day out of the reach of cell phones!Next time, more variety of blades, more worms, will definitely try leeches, and more beer!Now back to work, counting the 7300 days until I retire and can do this trip more often!"

1971817,vteye,2013-07-22 15:11:00,812,Beautiful resv - we have really enjoyed the beauty of that area on our trips. What outfitter did you go in with? Pike - any good ones? I took my kids and hit 39C - spent couple days swimming. Great memories - thanks for the update.
1974306,smallcal,2013-07-23 08:49:00,119,"It is a beautiful place. Love waking up to hearing the loons, unbelievable sunrises and sunsets, etc.We went with Baie du Nord only my second time, two of the guys in our group have been going with them for ~ 10 years - new ownership 2 years ago and they are not living up to what we had expected - there were some issues and we may be looking for a new outfitter this coming year.Four of the six flew in with Air Melancon, that is a first class operation.A few pike, nothing too huge. A 35"" on the last morning to go with all of the big walleye."
1974714,octanehi5,2013-07-23 10:17:00,1104,"As far as I'm concerned, when air melancon sold their baie du nord camps they got rid of there best lake for fishing.they have always had the best camps to stay at . If you are looking for an other outfitter on the gouin,may I suggest Air Tamarac, they have many camps on the west side of the gouin which are fly to only. In my experiance of 30 yrs+ of going t the canadian shield lakes once you can get to the spots by car your fishing experince declines. I have been flying in with air Tamarac for 10 yrs.Aways had a great trip.I will be with them at the harrisburg show in pa. the first weekend in feb 2014.stop by and say hi , I will hook you up with a great trip."
1975450,NYBowHunter,2013-07-23 14:01:00,35,Hi smallcal - sent you a PM.
1976234,ed08walleye,2013-07-23 19:19:00,27,"I agree on Air Melancon getting rid of their best spot. Other cabins / lakes are good, but not close to what they ran at the Gouin. They are a top notch, professional, and safe outfitter. I just spent 5 days at Baie du Nord starting on July 5th. Although we did not have any outfitter issues, the drive in is a little to much. Coming from Ohio it adds to much time. Hard on vehicles and added gas money. We are not sure if we will explore other options or choose to fly in to the Baie du Nord in the future."
