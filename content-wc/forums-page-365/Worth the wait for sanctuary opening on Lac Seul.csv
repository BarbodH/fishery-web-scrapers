Patty had mentioned that the sanctuaries dont open until the 14th. she didnt have anything available until the 21st but said there are plenty of good spots close to camp before the 14th. Would anyone suggest waiting until the 21st after the sanctuaries are opened up?"
1975722,wallydave,2013-07-23 15:40:00,2151,This year with the late iceout Sawmill Bay was a good spot early before the Wenesaga Sanctuary opened. The mouth of the Wenessga river is a popular spot too. Bear and Iron creek a couple other spring spots to try. They will try to put you on the fish! Be prepared for all kinds of weather! Good Luck!
1976082,rommel,2013-07-23 18:32:00,369,i'm heading up to onaway on friday. never been to lac seul. where is the sanctuary your talking about?
1976410,wallydave,2013-07-23 20:08:00,2151,"The Wenesaga River is near Ear Falls farther north on the 105 from Onaway. Several other lakes have sanctuaries were walleyes spawn in the spring. Post spawn walleyes feed like crazy, to protect the breeding stock those areas are offlimits until June 15. Good luck at Onaway, that's one place I would like to try."
1977313,Jwendt15,2013-07-24 08:38:00,72,"Thanks for the tip Dave. Would you go as far as delaying your trip a few weeks just to fish the sanctuaries? Evergreen doesnt have anything open the 14th so I couldnt get out there until the 21st. Im thinking the hottest week on those is probably the first week they open up, may not be worth it too wait that long."
1977481,wallydave,2013-07-24 09:27:00,2151,Its a crap shoot with the weather! You never know when the ice goes out or when the spawn starts. Take the week you have and be ready to adjust to the how things workout. Later in spring the fish move out into the lake.
1977841,btmbncr,2013-07-24 11:03:00,492,"I wouldn't worry or wait for the Sanctuary to open.I took my 83 yr old father to Evergreen lodge for my first trip to Lac Seul.It was a real late spring,fish were trickling out of the Wenasaga River(sanctuary area).The hot bite was shallow in front of a weed bed by Radar Island.The lake shiners were spawning.It concentrated the bite on this food source.It was insane the number of big fish we caught.We found them using bottombouncers with minnows then sat on top of them and used jigs. I'd look on a lake map,looking for where running water entered the lake and check those areas also. I always preferred later in the season,end of July and the first part of August for my walleye trips.Less bugs,more stable weather usually and the fish are more concentrated on deep structure.Bill"
1977897,Jwendt15,2013-07-24 11:27:00,72,Thank you for the advice! We'll probably stick with the week of the 7th and hope for the best with the weather. It will be a learning experience I am sure. I have no doubt that a guide will put us on fish for the week.
1978537,KTroller,2013-07-24 16:41:00,237,X2 on not worrying about the Sanctuary being open. It is a nice place for windy days but I've only had one year out of the last eight where it was actually our hot spot for the week. Lots of places to fish in the area both deep and shallow so you'll be just fine.Enjoy!KT
