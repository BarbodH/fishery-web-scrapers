1975242,LOW1,2013-07-23 12:27:00,2828,Big John's just south of the bridge in Sioux Narrows has the best view of the lake. If you are towing something park parallel with Highway 71. Good sandwiches and breakfasts.White Birch Lodge in SN has a neat dining room with good food. Slightly more inconvenient to get to than Big John's.Monica's in Nestor Falls (west side of Highway 71) is also very good and has good parking. There's a Tim Horton's in Ft Frances.
1975362,stjoeguy,2013-07-23 13:17:00,979,We always have lunch at La Place Rendez-Vous in Fort Frances. It's a nice restaurant with good food and a view.http://rendezvoushotel.com/lakeside_dining

1977113,Stu,2013-07-24 07:18:00,472,"We always ate at the Harbourage in Ft. Frances after crossing the border. It's a simple diner and they have a great breakfast. We ate at dinner at Green's about 15 years ago before flying out of Nestor Falls. I was grossly over-severed at the bar, so I don't remember much, but I seem to have had a great time."
1977473,hoosiercanadian,2013-07-24 09:26:00,104,"The chocalate moose , on the right as your coming into International Falls is a good place to eat, they serve a very good breakfast, and big portions."
1978225,ScottL,2013-07-24 14:20:00,733,"Chocolate Moose is a very good place to eat in IFalls. The other two mentioned that I've eaten at, The Harbourage and LaPlace-Rendez-vous are both very good also, but they are East on Hwy. 11 in Fort Frances so if you are west bound its out of your way."
1978249,wallydave,2013-07-24 14:34:00,2151,"We have been stopping at Tim Hortons for breakfast sandwiches, coffee to go and coffee for the cabin too!"
