We are gonna be targeting walleyes however we are very excited at the possibility of hooking a musky, big northern and some small mouth. Any recent reports or any hints would be appreciated. We plan on spending a lot of time in the Miles bay area. Jared thanks for all your posts from the obabikon area and yes we will be stoping in to buy some ice from you at some point."

1968193,muskyman73,2013-07-21 07:29:00,402,"We just got back from miles bay and we got most of our walleye on jig-n-spinners, 1/4 - 3/8 oz with gold blades, gotta be gold blades. We put 4 inch yamamoto grubs in watermelon green and or red flake. Crankbaits in red and black crawdad patterns as well as green crawdad too. We use the crankbaits to find the fish and then pick them apart slowly with the jig-n-spinner set ups. Anywhere from 6-20 feet deep, and at times, the back of bays, the weedy ones, always in the center and if it had blow downs, ya they are in there. If the sun is up, they are usually deeper, if its overcast, and some chop, they will be shallow and much more aggressive. The evening bite was so easy it was almost not fair. Shallow Shallow, on points and hitting the crankbaits hard. Why bother with the live bait, we have not used it in over 10 years. Oh, make sure you change all your set ups to fire line or braid or flourocarbon - ever since we did this, we stopped using live bait. You will be amazed at the things you are feeling, in addition to getting more of your tackle back and fish landed. Good luck dude."

Never tried jig-n-spinners...looks like I'll need to pick some up. Based on your username I'm assuming you chased muskies as well. How was the action on muskies? We've caught many 46"" inch+ in that area...biggest is 50. I'm assuming buck tails is the way to go right now."
1976594,muskyman73,2013-07-23 21:44:00,402,"I did not get any muskies while targeting them, only the one incidental. Ya, usually up there, black bucktails, gold blades, is my stand by. I also do good at times on jerk baits, manta's in smallmouth or walleye patterns, and big bomber long A's in gold & black with marked up orange bellies - custom but deadly for me."
