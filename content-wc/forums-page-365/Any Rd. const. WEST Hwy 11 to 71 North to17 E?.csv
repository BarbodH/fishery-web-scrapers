I don't know about Highway 17 east to VB.Sometimes if there is a really torrential rain Highway 71 can close in a few spots, but the odds of that happening this time of year are low.Have a good trip."
1980178,Fishin Fun,2013-07-25 08:27:00,218,I'm heading the same direction next Friday so I'd like to know too. Then heading north on 105 from Vermilion Bay. Can't wait!
1980290,rather-be-fishin,2013-07-25 08:55:00,429,Fishin Fun - Where are you heading? We are going North on 105 too to Lac Seul Lake staying at Fisherman's Cove Resort. RBF

I'm always more concerned about construction delays on I35 and Highway 33/53 than in Canada.It seems to me Canada has a different attitude towards construction traffic than does the US. We put up a few signs and hope people slow down. Few really do. Canada tries to actually do something about it. Two or three summers ago two bridges were replaced on Highway 71 south of Nestor Falls. There's not too much trafic there and, especially at night, there's no one around. Nevertheless, signal lights were placed at these construction sites and one was required to wait several minutes until the light turned before (legally) crossing the bridge. It was somewhat bizarre to sit and wait for the light to turn when there was no one else around for miles. But doing it that way was probably safer."

1982257,Fishin Fun,2013-07-25 20:46:00,218,"It looks like there will be construction again on I35 and 33/53. I drive thru the construction south of Owatonna every day and so far it hasn't been bad, but I don't drive it on the weekends. The Cities is always a mess. What I've been reading on this forum is that the 33/53 construction isn't too bad as long as you take your time. We will be driving up to Virginia Minnesota on Friday and the rest of the way on Saturday so we should be past most of the construction by Saturday."
