1986018,115 optimax,2013-07-27 12:01:00,650,By the way it's a CRAP day again!
1986050,octanehi5,2013-07-27 12:22:00,1104,"I eat their livers with a nice Chianti, Brunello de Montelcino 1997 of coarse,Montecristo cigars, And the Blue.They go very well with the under 100 walleye days also. Bad or good weather."
1986106,camp chef,2013-07-27 12:52:00,915,Beautiful today here in Wisconsin high of 56 F. Might be new record for July. Love it!!
1986154,115 optimax,2013-07-27 13:52:00,650,54 F with 19mph wind gusts from the North + rain right now.
1984738,115 optimax,2013-07-26 18:00:00,650,"My point is,it's July and I want to wear shorts and a t-shirt while I'm fishing not winter wear with a rain suit on top.We already had a late spring and its almost August already.You know how long the winters are here and how cold it gets.I guess if you pay all kinds of money to come up here,you want optimal fishing conditions.Also I love living here and I don't need any useless advice on where I should live and what site I'm on.Linders Angling Edge is about to start,gotta go......"
1984770,kzoofisher,2013-07-26 18:29:00,5144,"So long as the weather holds fairly steady I'm good with it, and that goes for a trout trip here in the States as much as a Canada trip. I will say that I've had many more trout trips blown up by the weather than walleye trips. That's mostly because, like this past Mother's Day when it snowed in Northern Michigan, if I'm walleye/smallmouth fishing I have a lot more options than when I'm fly fishing. We caught a lot of fish on unusually empty lakes that weekend, despite the temps dropping from 75 to 35 from Wednesday to Friday and because we were able to take what the weather offered. I also wouldn't mind if the temperature never hit 80 all year but that's just me"
1984874,115 optimax,2013-07-26 19:34:00,650,So most of you would rather fish in 48F to 59F with 18 mph winds from the North in the rain?I don't think my wife and kid would last too long in that crap!I would take the 75F all summer long.
1985546,octanehi5,2013-07-27 09:08:00,1104,"Watch the Linders,they will teach you how to catch Walleye's.even in hot and humid weather, After catching over 900 Walleye's in very bad weather in a week.Along with a good bottle of wine every day."
1985650,Pikeslayer8,2013-07-27 09:45:00,1460,This post is a low blow and shows no class whatsoever.
1985666,v-bay gord,2013-07-27 09:49:00,3168,"The weather is making everyone a little testy. On the bright side the forecast looks better and fishing has been great. On the down side, I need a haircut and the barber is always off fishing somewhere!"
1985778,joeman79,2013-07-27 10:44:00,417,Exactley What PikeSlayer posted. Wow Wow Wow
1985826,Pooch,2013-07-27 11:06:00,4619,"Many years ago I bought a barbers electric clippers and every few weeks just stand over the basement sink and buzz it off. Got tired of having to make an ""appointment"" at a salon to get my hair cut.Going bald anyway. Might as well get it over with.Pooch"
1985858,115 optimax,2013-07-27 11:11:00,650,I already know how to catch Walleye in hot calm weather that's the kind of weather I like.There's more to fishing than just stacking the boat full of fish.
1985938,v-bay gord,2013-07-27 11:33:00,3168,"In an effort to keep this thread civil, I will pose the question to Octanehi5...""What wine goes with a 900 walleye week?"" My guess.......an Australian Sauvignon Blanc (well chilled)"
1982201,115 optimax,2013-07-25 20:40:00,650,"This will be 2 weeks of pure crap fishing weather in a row!Cold during the day and cold at night,windy and rainy.Feels like hunting season already,what a rip off"
1982450,pikeandtina,2013-07-25 23:28:00,145,It's called global warming.
1982570,v-bay gord,2013-07-26 05:34:00,3168,Looks sunny and cold this morning. What beautiful Fall weather!
1982842,Skywagon,2013-07-26 07:10:00,1106,"I don't mind the temperature (better than hot), but the damp/wind does not help. No sun here this morning, 10c, some wind and misting rain, glad I don't have to be out in it."
1983170,Mike Borger,2013-07-26 08:10:00,1554,"Yeah well up until a week ago it was like fishing in a sauna (at least where I was). I'll take this weather any day of the week, love it!"
1983490,octanehi5,2013-07-26 10:11:00,1104,"most of the best walleye fishing weather,is in bad weather,Rain, walleye chop."
1983522,camp chef,2013-07-26 10:20:00,915,"I will take cold, rainy, overcast and windy any day for my fishing trips."
1983650,tv4fish,2013-07-26 11:12:00,2694,"Yeah It's that 95 degree, sunny and flat calm weather that REALLY sucks."
1983714,115 optimax,2013-07-26 11:46:00,650,You would change your tune if you lived here.
1984570,Skywagon,2013-07-26 16:27:00,1106,"I think the point is, that if you live here you can pick your days to fish, if you are only here for a week, you make the most of it. Hot, humid sucks, hands down. For most on this forum, your fishing weather is just luck of the draw."
