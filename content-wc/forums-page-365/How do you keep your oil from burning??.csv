1979626,LLewellin,2013-07-25 05:41:00,1790,One thing to do to keep batter/breading on the fillet and not fall off in the oil is dry the fillet and roll/dust in breading/flour and then to the egg wash and then to the final breading or batter.
1979786,tooski,2013-07-25 06:37:00,393,"Cast iron - we usually take one since the outfitters idea of ""cast iron"" and ours sometimes differ. Also I just throw a couple kernels of popcorn in the oil. When it pops the oil is the correct temp...."
1979818,Andyeye,2013-07-25 06:47:00,179,Keep the temp even like earlier stated around 350. I use a new minnow dip net after the oil has cooled to get all of the leftover coating out of the oil. That is were the burnt taste comes from. Remember the new part on the dip net they are cheap and the ones used for fishing make your cabin mates cringe.

1980114,octanehi5,2013-07-25 08:03:00,1104,"fry or deep fry in peanut oil,it takes the highest heat of all the oils, You could invite me on your trip,I will cook and guide never burn fish"
1980210,Fishin Fun,2013-07-25 08:32:00,218,For me peanut oil is a must and a thermometer. Heating the oil to 350-375 before adding the fish works great for us. I dip the fish in milk then in dry batter. Letting them sit for a few minutes before putting them in the fryer works pretty well.
1980378,Daniel Johnson,2013-07-25 09:31:00,121,"This is what works well for me. A fryer base with a 8-12 qt. cast Dutch oven, 1 gal. veg. oil, 375-400 deg. on the therm, fish breaded in a corn meal based breading, and frying a batch of sliced potatoes every 2 or 3 batch. I don't have any problems with cheap veg oil, peanut oil is just to expensive. Corn meal will not darken you oil as fast as flour based breadings. Potatoes will clean oil and go great with fish. Gotta have the cast iron so you temp doesn't dive when you add your fish. I like to roll the fish in vinegar before breading. Glues dry breading to the fillet. Now I'm hungry."
1982626,Bitinlight,2013-07-26 05:58:00,95,"The camp we stay at furnishes a standard outdoor fish cooker with each cabin. We dump a gallon of good quality oil in when we cook our first fish fry. It lasts for 4 fish dinners for 4 people without any problems. We make sure our fillets are dry and roll them in Fry Magic-nothing else. We also do thinly sliced potatoes prior to the fish. Never had a problem with burning oil. Oil stays right in the pot the whole time, and we just use it over again for each fry. Fish seem to taste even better as the oil seasons itself. I think the key is to have a test piece of fish. When the oil is ready, you will know by the test piece. You don't want to have the oil too hot."
1985185,lassh,2013-07-27 05:45:00,553,"Keep your oil from over heating and Throw in a few potato slices between batches and at the end to soak up the burnt stuff; this helps clean up the oil. We call these ""junk potatoes"" (not that they are not delicious). It really works."
1978033,troutwater,2013-07-24 12:15:00,299,"If we are using a dry batter we will dip them in egg(not always but about half the time), batter them, and then sit them on a large piece of tin foil for about 10-15 minutes. While we wait is usually when we get the oil warmed up to around 350 like someone else said earlier. Now if we use the Fish Crisp beer batter we put them immediately in the oil, but that's a little different."
1978401,SSH,2013-07-24 16:13:00,526,Do you use a thermometer? Key is to not let the oil get much past 350 degrees. If you let it get over 400 degrees the oil is too hot and will burn any batter in the pan. Purchase a thermometer for deep frying for about $10. If the oil gets too hot. just turn off the heat and wait for it to cool to 350. I use a strainer to remove as much of the batter in the oil right after the fish is removed.
1978681,2746,2013-07-24 17:19:00,3206,Exactly right! When one pan fries you expect to change the oil each time. Deep fat frying (in a kettle with a quart or two of oil) allows you to strain the oil after several days of use and reuse. The breading has a chance to settle to the bottom. We have pan fried but with an inch or more of oil and have been able to get 4 or 5 uses out of it.
1978953,Bill Krejca,2013-07-24 19:00:00,6107,"I pan fry with a thermometer. I very carefully watch until it reads 375, then quickly put in the fillets. It is interesting to watch the temperature drop, usually to about 340. After turning the fillets once, I wait until they look done, then remove and again carefully watch until 375 is achieved, and repeat the process. Because I only use a fairly small amount of oil in the cast iron frying pan, I just dispose of the oil when finished. This process requires constant attention to avoid overheating, all components are placed right next to the stove. The higher temperature seals the fillets quickly and I never get oil soaked fillets. Bill"
1979017,Golden Eagle,2013-07-24 19:15:00,2642,"I start with clean, but fairly dry fillets. Fillets go into whole buttermilk (not 2%), then onto a large plate to drain. Then into a BPS breading box for a thorough dusting of Seasoned Zatarain. Battered fillets go into the refrigerator for 30 minutes. I think the delay helps Zatarain stick to fillets. Later in our stay I'll add Cajun Seasoning to the Zatarain for a little extra zing.My peanut oil is heated to 360 F. - 375 F. I don't trust standing oil for giving an accurate reading. I stir my oil to get a good reading.I add too few rather than too many to my boiling oil and stir just a bit. I turn up the heat in case adding fillets causes a decrease in temperature. Flame needs to be turned down when fillets are removed so oil won't get too hot while no fillets are in cooking pan.Timing is important.Walleyes taste good when breaded with corn meal, but corn meal falls off and after cooking several batches your corn meal will be burned.After dinner when oil is down to about 100 degrees we strain the oil which will make it last at least a week when feeding 6 very hungry walleye lovers.Filters and filtering rack come from Acer.I've seen guys use a gallon of peanut oil only one time and out. Done properly a gallon can make it for two weeks. It doesn't hurt to do a couple of meals of French fries that have not been battered."
1979065,MassillonBuckeye,2013-07-24 19:41:00,661,"Great thread! I'm definitely going to be trying peanut oil. I've used for stir fry an stuff but never fish. Big difference? Also it seems I've been using too much oil for pan fry. I'll also caution against oil temp too low.. Last batch I kept waiting for it to brown took too long and i made rubber! The bigger pieces were ok. Electric range set in 2.5 wasn't enough. My thermometer is junk, anyone recommend a good cheap thermometer? And where do you get your peanut oil?"
1979137,jimirjr,2013-07-24 20:01:00,1149,"A lot of it depends on what kind of PAN You are using... those cheap aluminum ""fish fryer"" types are so thin You could burn water in them... cast iron fry pan is best, but limits You on the amount of servings You can prepare at one time... Most of You are cooking on fishing trips, somewhere, where weight / space becomes a factor...We started frying our Fillets in a pan ON the TOP of a gas grill.... saves clean-up time in the kitchen.If You are frying outdoors, take Your time, don't use to much coating, and watch the temp.... If Your Fillets are turning dark to quick... everything is gonna turn dark to quick and burn unless You turn the temp down...You should get 4-5 uses of oil, unless the ""bears, squirrels, mice, etc"" get into it...."
1979145,troutwater,2013-07-24 20:05:00,299,"Most large grocery stores will have peanut oil like Walmart, Target, Kroger, etc. I do prefer how peanut oil cooks over other oils, but its also about 3 times more expensive so I rarely get it."
1979281,Da' Walleye Assassun,2013-07-24 20:49:00,358,"When pan frying throw in a small piece of bread in the heated oil. If the bread sizzles the oil is the right temperature. Also, cold fillets fry up better."

1977441,MrSimon,2013-07-24 09:19:00,922,"When I fry fish I just use a big pot on an outdoor Coleman gas stove. It works great for the first batch of fish, but then the batter starts to burn in the bottom of the pan and turns the second batch a darker color and gives it a smokey taste. Forget about a third batch. So I've been dumping the oil and cleaning the pan after each batch. Its a pain. I see some fryers on Amazon that have specially placed heat sources and V bottom shaped pans that won't burn .... but they are big, bulky, and cost $300. I don't mind the price, but they are too big to take on trips. What do you guys do?"
1977601,camp chef,2013-07-24 10:01:00,915,Are you deep frying or pan frying?
1977609,Jaskonie,2013-07-24 10:02:00,80,"take a lil themometer and keep the oil as close to 350 as possible. It should last more than one day especially if using a wet batter, sometimes crumbs burn up and cause it too."
1977769,Pikeslayer8,2013-07-24 10:48:00,1460,"We used to have this problem too, till we switched to peanut oil. Problem solved!"
1977801,chevtow,2013-07-24 10:56:00,691,"x2. Also bread the fish and let it sit for 5-10 minutes to help the breading set. We use oil numerous times and we don't use any special oil, and we don't do a wet batter."
1977865,MrSimon,2013-07-24 11:09:00,922,"Kind of both I think. We dip the fish in egg, then in batter, then lay in a pan of hot Canola oil ... let sizzle, then flip. Its delicious for the first round, then things get dark and burnt once the batter droppings settle to the bottom and start to burn."
1977937,troutwater,2013-07-24 11:34:00,299,How long are you letting the fish sit after they've been battered? I used to have a problem similar to this until I started letting them sit on the tin foil to allow the batter to soak in. After that I never had a problem.
1977945,MrSimon,2013-07-24 11:37:00,922,"Interesting. We take them out of the batter and drop them straight in the oil. We are also using a dry batter. We dip into egg, then flop the fillet in the dry coating, then fry. How are you guys doing it?"
1977953,new hips,2013-07-24 11:39:00,498,"For deep frying, I always take a small strainer and get all the loose batter out of the oil. Wait until the oil hits 350 then put in another batch, never have a problem."
1977969,camp chef,2013-07-24 11:46:00,915,"If the oil is not deep enough to keep the fish off the bottom of the pan, you are pan frying.You only need to use a small amount of oil for this type of frying and the breading stuck to the pan will indeed burn if you reuse the oil.simply wipe out the residue and start over.This type of frying only requires about an 1/8th of an inch of oil in the pan."
