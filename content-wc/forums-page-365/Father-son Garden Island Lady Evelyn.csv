I am no fish finding expert. Would love tips from you seasoned ""Lady Evelen"" lovers out there on where/how to fish as my 12 yr old thinks it should be called catching, not fishing..."

I'd start at the saddle between the two small islands S of GI. Great spot for smallmouth and walleye. My first night there I caught a 26"", 27"" and 29"" Walleye all within 15 minutes casting an X-Rap along the shoreline of the north island. The next year I went we fished there midday and landed at least a dozen beefy smallmouth drifting between the two islands - it's full of rocks.I also like the sunken island SW of GI near the shoreline. Caught a lot of walleye there as well. The spot on that map is a bit off I think. It's closer to the outflow from the small inland lake. You'll see it on the GI depth map.Otherwise I am sure Joe and Brian (if he's still there?) will put you on an awesome evening bite. For us it was back in Cookies Bay, SE of GI.Good luck!! Lady Evelyn is one of my favorite lakes to fish."
