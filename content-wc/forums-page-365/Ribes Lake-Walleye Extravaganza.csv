1985818,Rich B,2013-07-27 11:04:00,1081,Rick - thanks for sharing your report - great photos/details on your trip (I'm jealous - ha)
1971377,Mike Borger,2013-07-22 13:34:00,1554,"Nice report Rick! As I said before catching a brook trout of that size in Ribes is crazy. You'd have better odds of getting struck by lightning and winning the lottery on the same day.As it turns out I'll be fishing Ribes myself for the second time next week, can't wait.The only downside to this location is the extreme small size of the cabin. Talking to Martin Wearn of Park's today he has plans to build a new log cabin on Ribes. Nothing extravagant, but head and shoulders above what's there now. I've fished a number of lakes in this immediate area and the blue coloration especially on the fins is VERY common. Only the lakes with really deep water in excess of 50' though. The shallower lakes only hold the more typical colored fish.They're definitely not a different strain. They're not true ""blue walleye"" but are nonetheless an interesting variant.Would be nice if a fisheries biologist could chime in and explain."

1971705,Mike Borger,2013-07-22 14:33:00,1554,"My guess is not really fast. From what I can gather they're only just now building up their business since acquiring it. That's probably why I was just able to book Ribes at virtually the last minute. Small cabin aside it's still a very good walleye lake.Let me know if you do indeed end up booking with Park's. I'd be more than happy to mark a map for you.Cheers, Mike"
1971793,wallydave,2013-07-22 14:57:00,2151,Thanks Mike!Thats one of the great things about WC! Folks are willing to share the good the bad and the ugly about fishing Ontario! I hope a trip comes together for next year!Dave
1972001,adempsey,2013-07-22 16:06:00,963,"Are you going in for a short trip? Love to know what a 3.5 to 4 day trip would cost, but I assume it's not that much cheaper considering the major cost is the flight. I am thinking I could work in a couple more trips this year if I did that"
1972033,Mike Borger,2013-07-22 16:11:00,1554,"3 nights. We're driving up Wed afternoon, flying in early Thursday, then out early on Sunday. It's a viable option for me with the drive being so short. Plus I know the lake and where to find the fish.Shoot me an email."
1972689,polaris-pete,2013-07-22 19:25:00,343,Must be nice to be rich EH Mike! Just kidding.Save a few fish for us next year please.Say Hi to Kelly for me.
1972809,Mike Borger,2013-07-22 19:55:00,1554,"Plenty of fish for you Pete LOL! And no, thankfully I won't be flying with Kelly."
1972833,polaris-pete,2013-07-22 20:00:00,343,Have a safe trip up Mike. let us know how you do when youre back.Will be in touch. PK

1898882,Guest,2013-06-26 08:37:00,0,"Nice fish! I have been to this lake 3 times, as recent as July 2012 and have had a great time catching big walleye and 35+ in. pike"
1900498,RickOnt,2013-06-26 19:19:00,217,Hey BrianAny relation to Tom?I talked to Him on the dock as He came in when we flew out.Rick
1900546,Bill Krejca,2013-06-26 19:37:00,6107,"Nice size fish and the lake looks absolutely beautiful! The walleyes are very nice - their shape, fins, and coloration seem to be a little different, could they be of a different strain? Looks like a great place to spend a week! Bill"
1903434,RickOnt,2013-06-27 17:26:00,217,Yes Bill It was a great spot for sureThe Fish are definitely 2 different colors. CheersRick
