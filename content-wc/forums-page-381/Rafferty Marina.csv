Possibility there may be ice to the west, don't know for sure. Wind was from northwest today, so would think it would have come towards the dam if any left. Water is rising, probably 6 inches a day, so it will be a guessing game how far in we put a dock. The big wooden dock needs a little work, so will be a few days before we get it in. Water will be very cold, for sure."
