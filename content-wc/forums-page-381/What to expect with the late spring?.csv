I've never been there this early and with the late spring I'm wondering what to expect. I assume eyes and pike will in or near warm bays and that the lakers will be relatively shallow. I'd welcome any and all suggestions especially from anglers experienced with earlier fishing conditions. I'm expecting to jig for the eyes with crawlers, leeches and salted minnows. Larger cranks for pike and spoons for lakers. Thanks in advance. Mike."

Soft plastics rigged more or less weightless fished in the back bays shine in early spring at times, especially under cold front conditions. 8"" Reapers, 7"" plastic jerkbaits, and swimbaits are all favorites of mine. Sometimes they just won't chase hardware..."
