1526615,EyeMagic,2013-01-21 12:57:00,10,"Considering Clark's Camps/KC/Forest Lake Lodge just north of Vermilion Bay on the Indian Chain. Anybody been up there in the past year or last several years and have any input on any of these camps and the lakes? Is one camps ammenities better than the others, is the fishery just average? I know Clarks and KC's Landing is same owner, but don't know much more than that. I checked out the past posts on this board and had very limited insight on how the fishing was. Looking at last week in May or 1st week or two in June possibly.. Is there a lot of pressure on this system? Any feedback greatly appreciated. Just for the record, over the last 20+ years I have fished Lac Des Milles Lacs, Eagle Lake,Lac Seul, Perrault, Wabaskang and Clay Lake. I am looking for new water on a smaller body of water than the likes of Lac Seul or Eagle. Renting camp boat with American or housekeeping plan."
1526816,wishinfishinmn,2013-01-21 18:56:00,52,Indian Lake Chain is a nice lake to fish.Nice views down in boulder and little boulder as well as Forest Lake.My family and I fished Eagle for about 10 years and Lac Seul both sides for about 6 years. Only 30 incher came out of Eagle Lake.Bigger fish in these 2 bodies of water for sure. Lac Seul is the way to go if you want to catch many many walleyes with size. That is a walleye factory that is tough to match.Indian chain will get you a very good amount of 15-17 inch walleyes. Good eating size. More difficult to get larger fish. We have gone here the last 4 years and are satisfied with the fishing. My parents like their cabin and my kids like the lake for the sandy beach and fun lake toys. We go in August. Catch a couple muskie each trip grabbing the walleyes. Mid to upper 30 inchers.Nice hosts and clean place.
1527224,dollure,2013-01-22 13:45:00,71,"Have stayed at Clarks/KC landing 3 times. Have not been in last 5 yrs due to my son buying a bar and going broke. They are nice people and will do what they can to meet your needs. Boats are great being 17 ft Lunds or Misty River. Both same floor plan. We stayed at ""Birch Cove"" which is actually a 3 bedroom cottage away from the camps. Owm dock washer, dryer. Adult son caught 3-4 small muskie off the dock. A larger one 40+ inches would follow but could not get him to bite. Someone on this site has a cabin on Forest Lake. Saluki I think is his id. Wayne use to supply his own minnows. Don't forget to take a few nightcrawlers& spinners. Did a day trip to Clay Lake and hired a guide for a day to lac seul. dollure"
1527916,Terwalleye,2013-01-23 18:46:00,166,"Eye MagicI have not been to the Indian Chain; but have stayed at Clarks ""other"" resort on Cedar Lake. Their service and equipment is top notch. One of the reasons we originally chose them was the fact they have 17 ft boats Lunds with 40 horse. I don;t want to spend 7 long days in a 16 ft Nader with a 10 or 15 on the back. If concisering any other smaller lake; I would highly reccomend Cedar. Their resort there is called Northern Lights.But since you asked about Indian, all I can say is how pleased we have always been with how they and their staff has always treated us."
1628282,bobbylfishermon,2013-04-02 13:57:00,241,"Indian Lake Lodge is the best camp on The ""chain"", beautiful cabins, spotlessly clean, the camp lay out is flat with everything you would need to enjoy your stay. Owners Derek and Cassy Becker are great people and will insure your trip will be one you will remember! The chain is a numbers fishery for walleyes with a chance for a big walleye(over 25in.), it's also a world class musky lake, big fish with LOTS of numbers. Same prices as Clark's etc. better acommadations as my wife and I stay there at least a month each summer for the last 14 years! Hope this helps."

1630610,Ia Walihntr,2013-04-03 06:31:00,320,"Eyemagic, Here are three resort websites that are located on the Indian Chain. Clark's www.clarksresorts.com/clarks/index.html Indian Lake Lodge www.indianlakelodge.com/ Therrien's Forest Lake Lodge www.therriensforestlakelodge.com/index.html Not sure if these are the only resorts on the system.

1639697,Kmanster,2013-04-05 12:11:00,26,"Went last year(Late Summer) for the first time and caught plenty of Walleye. My only complaint is too many boats and you have to travel from the lodge to get to the walleye. The travel involves alot of slow times through channels with submerged logs/tree's. I think we hit something in every channel on every trip out. Our group caught a ton of eaters and alot of musky (32"" average). The great thing about Clark's is the boats, they have a great set-up. Staff and camp were awesome but I've been and checking this one off my list. If/when we do another drive-in resort, we're going back to Perrault Lake. Just my 2 cents Also, here's a pic of the 8lb'r i caught the last day."
1759873,FishFry2012,2013-05-09 10:46:00,27,"Kmanster, which lake did you catch the 8 lber on?We stay at Therrians. I think it may save some of the drive time to the larger lakes. Therrians is family owned and they're great. I think it costs a bit less, but not quite as nice of rental boats. Def a better deal if you bring your own. We tend to catch quite a few eaters. We go memorial week, i'm guessing one of the biggest traffic weeks. There is some boat traffic, not too much, but spots def get fished a few times a day."
