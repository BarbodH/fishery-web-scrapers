1772969,Guest,2013-05-14 07:02:00,0,I am going there June 1-7th on a bear hunt fishing trip combination. I will report back after the trip. Hopefully they got some of these issues sorted out. They group I am going with have been in contact with the owners a lot. The owners have been really helpful so far.

It is the only lodge on a series of 3 lakes and they have 6 cabins for guests. The owner lives in Stow, Ohio, owned the lodge for 4 yrs. and after several phone conversations I'm getting ready to book and will do so while he's at the Hamburg, N.Y. sport show. I respect the opinions of posters on this board and I am asking for comments on this outfitter."

1081735,Seanik,2009-02-17 09:52:00,218,"Phish and Andre, Thanks for the reply, our groups fishing trips have been to Quebec the last 7 years. We have been to the Gouin reservoir, Lac Poutrincourt and Lac Berthelot. All of these trips produced great fishing but with different expierences as to outfitter personalities, cabins, equipment, scenery, getting there, ect. We like to try new lakes and part of the challenge is figuring out how to fish them. The owner of Lake Achepabanca lodge seems very sincere and accommadating after several phone conversations. He has housekeeping cabins only but will do a modified meal plan if we want it. We probably will book the 2nd or 3rd week of Aug. and have the entire lodge to ourselves. I will report on the trip upon our return. It's still a long way off but the planning begins with a deposit."
1081754,retire55,2009-02-17 11:39:00,1029,Hi Seanik: I have no information about the outfitter on Lac Achepabanca. I visited his web site and everything seemed great. Also took a look at Lac Achepabanca on Google Earth (N 48 degrees 40 minutes W 76 degrees 12 minutes). Its not very far from Lac Wetetnagami - just a little south east. Sure hope you post a report if you and your group decide to give this new lake a try.

1081770,deputy dog,2009-02-17 13:31:00,305,one other lodge in that are that i have been to is the lodge at parent lake. great walleye fishing decent pike. GREAT owners and facilities. worth a look: www.lodge-at-parent-lake.com. best walleye fishing is at the northern end of the lake where 2 or 3 rivers empty into parent lake. in laws have been going for at least 25 years. good luck!
1759785,npe100,2013-05-09 10:30:00,2,Did you ever go fish this lake achepanca? My group is considering Blue Walleye Outpost there for 2014 and was just curious. I think these are new owners after the 2009 sale but not sure. I would appreciate any information you have about your experience there. Thank you. Nate
1762569,Seanik,2013-05-10 07:44:00,218,"npe100, We did book and fish Lake Achepabanca approximately 4 yrs ago. I did not post a report because it would have been very negative. I did email a report to anyone who asked for one. We were there in August and the fishing was terrible, not enough for a fish fry during the entire week. I remember 5 small walleye, 4 small pike was the total for 5 guys. I fished three connecting lakes with 0 results. On the + side early June was the time to be there for better fishing as reported by the camp mgr, The cabins were ok, the docks were half sunken, boats just ok, the road in was rough and tough on our van. The other people in camp had some success at the last hr before dark fishing minnows near creek inlets. There are many better lakes near there for fishing. Seanik"
1763921,Jaskonie,2013-05-10 16:02:00,80,"thats why the camp was for sale at around 35,000. I talked to the former owner he lived about 5 miles from me here and said you have to learn the system."
