1778489,rjbuckeye,2013-05-15 21:04:00,9,Best time to cross and where to buy groceries and bait?
1779745,Walley Guide,2013-05-16 08:50:00,67,"Planning to cross sometime on either side of 2 am ...early on Fri. morning. Always works great getting across, staying at a motel in Fort Francis and then heading on up the road. No long lines to worry about.... Happy Fishin' Walley"
1763961,team walleye,2013-05-10 16:08:00,336,"I will be crossing the border Saturday June 15. This will be my first time at the border on a Saturday, usually go over on a Friday. Is the border a mess on Saturday.. Probably will be mid afternoon. Thanks"
1764977,dmb130,2013-05-11 05:06:00,21,"Depends on the PoE you arrive at. At a lower volume ports it may seem busier and you may be in line for 10 minutes, which could be a long wait time there, or you could arrive at one of the major highway PoE's and wait 1 hour, which on a Saturday is not a bad wait for that port. It all depends on that PoE's normal volume."

1765113,Tonyo,2013-05-11 05:53:00,212,We never cross on Saturday any more or if you have to our group members will travel the small amount of extra miles to cross at Baudette. We figure that moving along is better than sitting for an hour or more. Same goes for us on our way home. We now avoid International Fall/Ft. Frances and cross at Baudette. Even though there are a few more miles we are still moving and it turns out to be a shorter trip for us in the long run. TonyO
1765233,Bigstorm,2013-05-11 06:22:00,799,"Our group always crosses on a Saturday afternoon at Fort Frances, most of the time the wait is under 15min but a few times it has been close to an hour"
1765369,Aaron-IN,2013-05-11 07:10:00,500,You better get their early
1765385,team walleye,2013-05-11 07:36:00,336,Yeah we will be crossing at international falls/ ft Frances.
1765513,elway12,2013-05-11 08:33:00,335,Pigeon River is always a good crossing over point. Much less crowded than Ft. Francis even on a Saturday.
1765521,revitup,2013-05-11 08:34:00,140,"We plan on being at the border going into Canada on Saturday at Fort Frances, being there at 5:00am to avoid major waiting."
1765553,JayM5209,2013-05-11 08:44:00,1050,"We've been crossing at Intl. Falls on Saturday morning for years and years. Always hit it before 7 or 7:30 a.m. and I don't think we've ever had more than a 10 min. wait, often less. Coming south on a Saturday . . . . . now that a far different story. Plan to cross southbound before 8 or 9 a.m. After that, bring sandwiches for lunch while sitting in line!"
