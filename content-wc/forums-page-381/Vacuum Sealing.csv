1768961,drew59,2013-05-12 17:01:00,87,"A few questions for those you who vacuum seal your fish. First, do you seal right away or partially freeze the fish first? Second, how do you lay the fillets out, pressed together or side by side? Finally, does it create any potential problems with the MNR? We are thinking about taking ours so your help is appreciated."
1769025,hogridnfool,2013-05-12 17:30:00,349,Make sure you follow the MNR's regulations for transporting fish and you shouldn't have any problems.
1769121,Explorer,2013-05-12 18:23:00,873,Our last trip to MN we sealed our fish and then the resort wrapped them in freezer paper and put their stamp on it and they also wrote on the paper what was inside. species and number of fish. If you keep your fillets dry enough there is no need for prior freezing. You will know as soon as you start your machine. If you see fluid making its way to the opening of the bag then you should put them in the freezer for a while.
1769177,rather-be-fishin,2013-05-12 18:49:00,429,"We wash the fillets, lay them on paper towel & dry them then put one fish per package, fillets lay flat side by side & vacuum seal then freeze. They stack nice in the freezer & keep good for a long time. Easy to count limits & divide amongst our fishing party. Works awesome!"
1769193,JayM5209,2013-05-12 18:50:00,1050,"We've been vacuum sealing and freezing for years. Our procedure is to fillet and remove rib cages, rinse the fillets and lay on paper towels, pat dry with another paper towel, then bag. We leave the skin on so there's no question about species, but removing all but a 1"" patch would meet the requirements. Two fillets are placed together and flat in the bag, skin out on both sides. For 'eyes we'll do one big fish or two smaller ones per bag. The species and cabin number is written on the bag with a Sharpie and they go into the camp freezer, stacked so they freeze as flat as possible. If someone is taking their one over 18"" home (several of us don't keep a big one) their name goes on the bag. Several times when MNR officers checked freezers and fridges in camp we got compliments on our bagging/freezing techniques . . . it made it easy to identify and count fish. Twice we got the same positive feedback at the border when officers opened a cooler in the back of the truck.Just avoid jamming too many fish into each bag and leave a tag of skin to ID species. What kind and how many are the key questions. Everyone will be happier if you make it easy to determine both.Good fishing and happy travels."

1769297,Tonyo,2013-05-12 19:41:00,212,It definitely beats using the caps plastic bags and twist ties by a mile. Take the sealer. TonyO
