1744545,Jack77,2013-05-04 19:20:00,168,We have our beer flown in before hand and each guy buys a bottle of alcohol of his choice at the Duty Free. The rules for how much alcohol and tabacco are pretty much staight forward and easy to find.http://noto.ca/bordercrossing
1750625,Lazy Fisherman,2013-05-06 19:05:00,276,nemusky Thanks. Had not thought about the Duty Free.
1751609,port1042,2013-05-07 06:24:00,509,"Can I take a half liter of Brandy and a 12 pack of beer? I see the rules state ""or"", but is there room for both?"
1752809,JayM5209,2013-05-07 11:14:00,1050,"port, I always take a 12 pack of either Shiner boch or Pacifico plus a .75 liter bottle of Old Grandad (Kentucky's finest bourbon!) and have never had a problem and never had to pay duty. I declare exactly what I have and you can usually see the cogs turning in the officer's head, but no problem. Of course, I'm sure it always depends on who happens to be on duty when you pull up. When I meet the officer who thinks I owe a little duty, no problem. I spend a ton more on bait than I do on booze!"
1753761,Guest,2013-05-07 15:18:00,0,"If they were unopened, maybe you would get away with it. What would stop me from filling up old bottles with US liquer and bringing it back every year? see the problem."
1754057,Moondog,2013-05-07 17:15:00,362,EXACTLY MY THOTS......I bet the bottle that has been unopened will be duty free but the rest??? Nothing would stop someone from filling up the partially used bottles. nothing. LMAO
1766601,Woollybob,2013-05-11 17:26:00,158,You can bring all the beer and booze you want. You just have to pay duty on anything above the stats limit. Paying duty is still cheaper than buying at the beer store.
1767689,bigwalleye1,2013-05-12 07:40:00,2632,"Jay is on to my scheme. Glad he doesn't work for Canadian customs. I bring 2 750s or one 750 and a twelvie, declare it and watch the whells turn. While I suppose there's a first time for everything, I've never had anyone ask me to come in and pay duty on 1/3 of a bottle of booze or 7 cans of beer. I get the wave, offer a ""have a nice day"" and go on my way."
1737481,Moondog,2013-05-02 19:21:00,362,When we took our camper out of storage a few weeks back we discovered 3 bottles of liquor that we purchased in Canada last summer. One sealed and 2 open and about half gone. Question??? Do we have to declare these when crossing the border since they are obviously from the LCBO and we already paid a premium price or???? Anybody with any experience on this??? I really do not want to pay duty on these twice. Rather leave them home.
1737737,Brookieslayer,2013-05-02 20:18:00,123,"leave em at home, then there is no question. Most customs guys will let you each bring a bottle for personal consumption though... not all but most"
1738049,Walleye_Wrangler,2013-05-02 22:10:00,138,What??? In 30 years of going to Canada I never had a border guard bat an eye at A bottle of booze. The law states that you are allowed:You are allowed to import only one of the following amounts of alcohol free of duty and taxes:1.5 litres (53 imperial ounces) of wine;a total of 1.14 litres (40 ounces) of alcoholic beverages; orup to a maximum of 8.5 litres of beer or ale.
1738073,tackleman,2013-05-02 22:27:00,444,"leave them at home, you can get more up here and do you really want to risk a hassle at the border?"
1738089,Moondog,2013-05-02 22:39:00,362,Thanks just what I thought. We always get tossed at the border tho so wondered if this would make it extra special!!!!! really special. We wanna fish with you at the bug boat ramp. Plan on getting their the 15th. Watch for the Magic Bus and come over.
1739521,Hawkfan,2013-05-03 09:13:00,237,"There shouldn't be any issue. Worst case scenario is you don't technically get any duty free if you have extra. But you are allowed one liter of booze or case of beer duty free. Just tell them where you bought it and see. When we have brought alcohol back into the states that was purchased here we stated that and paid nothing. I know it's different, but you never know."
1739865,bobbylfishermon,2013-05-03 10:25:00,241,"Hawkfan is right, you are allowed one 750ml. OR ONE CASE OF BEER PER per person, period! That' what you're allowed to bring into Canada"
1740257,tv4fish,2013-05-03 11:42:00,2694,Bobby -- Your 750 ml is wrong (at least for Ontario). Quote: How much liquor can I bring into Canada? A. You are allowed to bring in 24-12 oz. cans or bottles of beer or 40 oz liquor or 1.5 litres of wine free of duties and taxes. You must be 19 years of age to import alcohol into Ontario. Any amount in excess of 45 liters will not be allowed entry.
1742729,Lazy Fisherman,2013-05-04 08:02:00,276,Does anyone know where you can buy 1.14L bottles of spirits?
1742793,nemusky,2013-05-04 08:19:00,60,The Duty Free Stores conveniently sell them at that size
