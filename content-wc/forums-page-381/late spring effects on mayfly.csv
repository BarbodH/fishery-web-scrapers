With the ice coming off the lakes in the area I fish today (Cedar Lake near Perrault Falls), I got to wondering how this will affect the mayfly hatch. I don't know all the factors related to the hatch. Certainly temperature of the water has a major effect, but does the amount of sunlight also affect the cycle? And I guess my ultimate question for those who have experience with the variables we are dealing with this year is--Will the mayfly hatches be late a few weeks or will the early season just compress and by the time June comes around still be on basically the same schedule?"
