1778497,KSlivin,2013-05-15 21:04:00,36,It's a first fly-in for a lot of guys in our group so we are looking forward to it. Hopefully we hit the weather right and everything funs smoothly.

1779265,KSlivin,2013-05-16 07:21:00,36,Nice PraireBoy! If you have a chance give us a fishing update when you get home. Have a great trip!
1528684,KSlivin,2013-01-25 09:08:00,36,"Hi guys, I'm new to the site and am enjoying the reads. We have just booked a fly-in trip(my first) to Chase Lake NW of Kenora with Halley's camps. Has anyone ever had any experience with this outfitter/ lake? Any suggestions on essential tackle besides the standard jigs/ minnows combos?Thanks for your time."
1528847,phishfearme,2013-01-25 15:01:00,1242,welcome to WC! my group did one week on chase - which includes midway and eagle lakes which you can boat straight into. there are two outpost cabins on chase - the one we used was kenora air who's cabin is right below where midway comes into chase. these are numbers lakes for walleye - small but numerous - as we caught nothing over 19inches. pike are all over but are mostly hammer handles. the lake does have a nice jumbo yellow perch population. kenora air provided us minnows and they were essential - the cabin had an ice house out back where you could keep an oxygen charged bag of minnows forever. keeping them in a minnow bucket at the dock was a good way to kill them. I think crawlers would also be a good bet. our usual twister jigging was not that effective. look for weed bed edges - one nice spot was to the west of our cabin about half way between the cabin and the end of the lake towards the north shore. weeds on top of a shallow hump and walleye and perch all around it. there's also a lake trout portage lake - we did one day there and caught the largest pike of the trip but still not all that large - no trout. best of luck and please report back. phish
1528853,SinOrSwim,2013-01-25 15:19:00,1528,"We stayed at Chase many many years ago. Through Walsten outposts our of Kenora. I truly don't remember the fishign very well but I know we didn't catch much with size. But, this was one of our first couple fly-ins ever so that could have been our experience level as much as anything. If the lake is truly that deep, there must be some decent size in there somewhere?1-I DO remember a couple things about that lake though. One is finding a 4-wheeler out behind an out building. We were young, just out of college and had been drinking. Got that thing started and had a BLAST. LOL A dangerous blast but it was fun. We only did it one time and after we realized how dangerous it was for us, we didn't start it up again. 2-a HUGE HUGE grease fire. This was before camps had propane cookers. We found a big steel grate by the door and made a campfire. We cooked our fish over the fire even at the cabin. Less mess. Well, we were standing around and the pan got really really hot. Instead of trying to move it, we stood back. oil boiled over and shot flames into the air higher than the cabin. We have some amazing pictures of that. 3-The ice houses. We always went in late August or early september. I was amazed there was still ice and quite honestly plenty of it. However, it is A LOT of work. THe first couple times we chunked up the ice with the axe and used it. But, then everything in the cooler has chunks of sawdust on it. Tops of beer cans etc. We then chunked it up and washed in buckets of water but man that was time consuiming. It was nice to have unlimited supply but it was a lot of work"
1528916,KSlivin,2013-01-25 18:28:00,36,Thanks for the input fellas. Hopefully we can find a few big ones.
1529009,Skywagon,2013-01-26 06:26:00,1106,"I have fished the adjoining-attached lake (litte Eagle) several times (been a few years) and have checked out the cabins on Chase. There are plenty of small walleye to keep you occupied, the biggest I have ever seen was 24 inches, with most being of good eater size, it is not a big fish lake. The cabins are typical run of the mill, they are fine. Minnows can be hard to keep, if you take care of night crawlers (keep them cool) they will last you the week, jigs and or bottom bouncers will be all you need. You will have a good time."
1529035,SinOrSwim,2013-01-26 07:35:00,1528,"The best thing we have ever done to keep minnows alive was to drop them to the bottom of the lake by the dock. I have a mesh minnow bucket or a collapsible minnow bucket. We put all extra minnows in there and put a rock in it to sink to the bottom of the lake. It is tied to the dock. But, the cold water and movement of the water keeps them all alive. We lift it up in the morning to fill our buckets for the day and sink it back down. Here is a link to similar bucket. It's the minnow motelhttp://www.romppais.com/DEEP_BAY_BAI...CCESSORIES.htm"
1529043,stillangling,2013-01-26 07:47:00,149,"I fished it about 10 or 12 years ago. I would agree with the previous posts in terms of fish size. Generally on the small side. That being said, the numbers were about as good as I have experienced anywhere."
1529055,pikeman14,2013-01-26 08:15:00,144,"We did find a few walleyes over 30 inches on Midway Lake. But you have to get through many smaller ones to find them. Fish seemed to be stacked up in certain areas. We caught walleye one after another on good days, once we found the spots. I did wasted alot of time my first day searching dead areas of the lake. I did see another outpost under water, and felt horrible for the guests in yellow rubber boots. I hope they werent charged full price."
1777585,KSlivin,2013-05-15 14:57:00,36,29 days to go until flying into Chase Lake for 5 days. Can't wait!
1777833,Rivratz,2013-05-15 16:35:00,105,Have done business with Halley's over the past few years. Stayed at their Caribou Falls camp a few times and did a couple of fly in's with them. Ralston and Long lake outposts. Good outfit. Halley's is a family operated business with good pilots and accommodations. Leeches and crawlers are best on fly in's. They could have them ready for you if you pre-order them. It may be cheaper to buy the bait at Jack's in Minaki. Jack's bait is only 5 minutes away from where you will fly out from.
