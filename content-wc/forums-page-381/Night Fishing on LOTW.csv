1770073,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2013-05-13 07:27:00,629,"Based on my personnel experiences & attempts with night fishing on LOTW, I would have to say that it is basically non-existant. I think mostly because of the stained water conditions. I do know that there are those who will night fish ""Whitefish Bay"" waters. But, that water is like the crystal clear waters of the Carribean. Just 1's opinion."
1771017,Fishin Fun,2013-05-13 13:08:00,218,I was told by some of the resorts in the Baudette area that they don't fish at night due to the stained water. This winter we were told to be off the lake by night fall because fishing after dark was non-existent. I don't have any night fishing experience on LOTW though to confirm.
