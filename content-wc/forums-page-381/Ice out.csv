1754905,Justin Syder,2013-05-08 00:57:00,6,"More Ice out pictures have been posted from high above. Still looks frozen.LOTW, Winnipeg and Fargo this time.I hope to see more Sioux Lookout / Lac Seul pics soon though.http://www.hiddenbay.com/photosvideos.htmlEnjoy or cringe! Depends if your trip starts opening weekend."
1754921,Mike Borger,2013-05-08 03:40:00,1554,"Well for what it's worth the ice at my camp in QC is on the way out, should be gone by the weekend imo. It's the same latitude as Kirkland Lake in Ontario."
1755177,deputy dog,2013-05-08 06:31:00,305,any updates on cordingley lake in nakina? our group has to decide by friday on whether to keep our may 18th date or switch to august.
1755193,onetimedave,2013-05-08 06:35:00,502,Nothing new except my outfitter says he has never lost a trip due to ice in the 22 years in business. Will try to contact him today and post.
1755257,jambi,2013-05-08 06:50:00,504,Nestor Falls Fly In put on their facebook page that ice was off Caliper Lake. (Caliper is just south of LOTW)
1755849,deputy dog,2013-05-08 08:28:00,305,"spoke with eddie and greg at cordingley lake, greg said ice out will be VERY close we may have to wait a day or so for it to be out enough to fly. beteau is clear with some chunks floating down stream. eddie needs at least 2-3 days in camp before us to open it up after the winter. greg said edges are opening but lows at night for the next 5-6 days are below freezing so that doesnt help. looks like we will be goin in august so we dont have to miss a day or two of fishing just hope the water levels stay up. eddie did say he bought a jet drive that only needs 4"" of water so even if water levels are down he can still get us around to the deeper holes. only having a week to fish and driving 18 hours i dont think the group will want to take the chance. havent broke the news to them yet tho.........really wanted to experience ice out fishing, and with a 73yr old uncle and 70 yr old dad trips are numbered. God willing we will give it another shot next year! good luck to the other groups scheduled for opener, hope it works out for you, but i would have a back up week just in case!!!"
1755969,onetimedave,2013-05-08 08:53:00,502,Just talked to Greg at Nakina Air and he felt ice would be off Cordingly by opening weekend. Cross our fingers.
1757785,5 of Diamonds,2013-05-08 18:15:00,151,Any word on ice conditions in Matagami Quebec area?

1739505,camp chef,2013-05-03 09:12:00,915,I take an extra layer of clothing.
1741913,Golden Eagle,2013-05-03 20:50:00,2642,I wouldn't be surprised to hear that you end up going in May 18 and staying two weeks.
1742425,onetimedave,2013-05-04 06:02:00,502,"As of 05-03-13 there was still 20"" of ice on above lake. Outfitter is positive as he has never lost a trip to frozen lakes in 22 years."
1742753,Crede,2013-05-04 08:04:00,134,"Hope you are right. We are also scheduled to fly with Nakina Air on May 25. From all of the reports on here and elsewhere I'm still concerned that the ice may not be gone. Our ""only a few weeks to go"" buzz is still there but all of our conversations are ""Will we be able to get there?"", not the usual ""We are going to set records when we get there!""."
1742913,zeebee,2013-05-04 08:43:00,1144,"By the 25th the ice will be out. The melt which will start this week in earnest will be relatively quick. Remember we are only a month or so from summer solstice and it wont be kind to the ice regardless of the weather the past month. I reside in Winnipeg and today it feels like spring for the first time...sun is quite intense. Also observed the woolly mammoths were starting to shed and the polar bears were drinking coke again....sure signs of the pending melt. Had the bears switched to pepsi, id be really worried."
1744865,rockrunner,2013-05-04 21:22:00,205,I live in Thunder Bay Northern Ontario and in my 40+ years of openers I have never been stuck on shore because of ice. I believe it was 1996 that we fished with ice on the lake but still was able to get out and score two limits of walleyes before the wind blew in and the ice chased us off the lake. Currently there is a lot of talk about ice out locally and it's going to be a close call. Personally my best educated guess would be that you can get on the lakes and fish but all of the ice won't be gone.
1745265,onetimedave,2013-05-05 06:37:00,502,NAS is holding an ice out contest. One person remains on ice till ice thins and he (she) falls through. Person with date and time closest to this happening is winner. Looking for person to sit on ice.
1749825,zeebee,2013-05-06 14:01:00,1144,"All right guys/gals. Just had the head of the Kenora MNR in my store...he's renovating his kitchen for the curious.

1750769,bigdaddyguns,2013-05-06 19:32:00,608,Here is the forecast from Accuweather for Ear Falls till opening day. A lot of 60s and 70s over the period should work on the ice. Mon 5/6/2013 70° 44° Tue 5/7/2013 72° 41° Wed 5/8/2013 56° 30° Thu 5/9/2013 57° 31° Fri 5/10/2013 61° 27° Sat 5/11/2013 45° 22° Sun 5/12/2013 57° 29° Mon 5/13/2013 71° 47° Tue 5/14/2013 70° 46° Wed 5/15/2013 70° 42° Thu 5/16/2013 61° 47° Fri 5/17/2013 54° 33° Sat 5/18/2013 63° 44°
1751393,Gunner_Fletch,2013-05-07 04:38:00,74,"Sorry to burst your bubble, but ref the ice out on LOTW....not a chance it's less than a week away. Don't assume just because someone holds a title like "" head of the MNR"" that they know what they're talking about. I live on the lake and there is up to 3 ft of blue ice on the majority of it. Sure there are open areas already but they are also open in mid winter. The consensus of most people that have lived here a long time is ice out ( which means being able to get to crow rock btw) , will be 21-26 May. I think maybe, if conditions are optimal, the earliest COULD BE 17-18 May...............but I wouldn't bet a whole lot of money on it!"
1730649,Justin Syder,2013-04-30 22:14:00,6,Looks like more Ice Out Watch pictures have been posted! I like that they are taken from way way up. Check it out!!I hope to see open water posted soon! http://www.hiddenbay.com/photosvideos.html
1731065,115 optimax,2013-05-01 06:18:00,650,Cold and snowing in Dryden right now.Low's -8c and high's of + 5c for the next few days.Thats not helping much.
1732361,1shooter,2013-05-01 12:53:00,1493,Its going to be close. Real close.
1732793,115 optimax,2013-05-01 14:55:00,650,The ice hasn't even lifted yet and there is 3 feet of it.17 more days until opener.With this Sh#$ weather i can't see it being gone.We're getting the right wind but not the right temps.We need it to be +20c and windy for the next 3 weeks.
1732937,jigman 2003,2013-05-01 15:38:00,981,Lakes with no inlet/outlet in west central MN are still frozen solid for the most part. Little bit of open water along the north shore on some. Long range forecast not looking like much thawing going on for the next week or so here. Northern MN is frozen solid. Guys will have a hard time finding open water for the MN fishing opener. Good luck to you early fishers in Canada
1738433,deputy dog,2013-05-03 06:22:00,305,"40, 53, 66, 72, 69, 53, 59, 54, 55.....those are high temps for next 9 days, just sayin"
1738857,rocko0305,2013-05-03 07:16:00,138,"FYI....Nakina Air Service is saying there is 2 feet of ice left on Cordingley Lake. I am going to put my prediction out there that ice out will be May 20, but I hope I'm wrong for a couple of your guys' sake."
1738865,Mike Borger,2013-05-03 07:16:00,1554,"Our trip to Windsor was changed from the 18th to the 25th yesterday, not too worried about things now."
1739209,vteye,2013-05-03 08:22:00,812,"Long term forecast looks positive for Cordingly being ice out forsecond week of the season but gents going in 5/17, 5/18 will be close."
1739225,FishFry2012,2013-05-03 08:27:00,27,"How do you guys change how you fish, when it is the week post ice, vs other yrs when the ice has been out for a month?"
1718257,deputy dog,2013-04-26 20:18:00,305,Temps in the mid to upper 50's for next ten days and lows above freezing......I'm feeling better:-)
1719785,Basskicker,2013-04-27 13:17:00,9,This is from 2.5-3 hours south of Nakina taken this morning. Still 40+ inches....give or take a few
1719889,deputy dog,2013-04-27 14:28:00,305,Your not helping my enthusiasm!!!!
1720457,Moosebunk,2013-04-27 19:53:00,211,LOL!Flying in with Solo on the 18th. Three weeks away. Happens or it doesn't I guess. Can't remember a break-up on the Attawapiskat later than mid May since 2000. May 14 I think was the latest. Upriver breaks sooner and pushes the ice flow.As for Cordingly............... Deputy says it best. lol. Hoping it all works out for everyone.
1727601,teddi,2013-04-30 08:35:00,349,Heavy rain today. Should make the ice move a little bit. Looking better for the opener.
1728689,vteye,2013-04-30 13:30:00,812,"I checked the 5 day in Nakina, warm rain today and 60-70's by the end of the week."
1728841,deputy dog,2013-04-30 13:53:00,305,How long of a stretch of warm weather like that will it take for that much ice to go out? We have never gone this early and are not familiar with how long it can take.....hope about week and a half though!!!
1729025,Mike Borger,2013-04-30 14:41:00,1554,"It'll go fast if the weather report is accurate.I have a camp in northwestern Quebec, closest large town would be Rouyn Noranda. A week ago it was still a winter wonderland and by Saturday all the snow was gone in the bush. Ice will likely break up there around May 10-12 at least according to my buddy who lives there."
1729305,deputy dog,2013-04-30 15:39:00,305,"Shall we pick a date.....I say cordingley lake will be clear may 6th, hopefully!!!!!"
1729601,Mike Borger,2013-04-30 16:58:00,1554,I'll say May 13.
1707065,onetimedave,2013-04-23 15:27:00,502,"Was advised today by an air service, that it will not be an early spring in the bush North of Nakina. No sign of ice melt. Mid may fishing groups might have to take their ice skates."
1708857,deputy dog,2013-04-24 06:27:00,305,"spoke with eddie of eddie north yesterday and he said same thing, lots of ice on cordingly lake. we are scheduled for may 18 opener and he is a little nervous about ice out. the 10 day forecast for nakina has temps in the 50's most days so hopefully that helps. we were able to get a backup week in late august should the ice not be gone. how long, with temps in the 50's regularly, will it take for 3' of ice to clear up?"
1709425,Mike Borger,2013-04-24 08:25:00,1554,Guess what? My group of 4 is scheduled for May 18th with Eddie as well. We're going to try and fly into Windsor lake...Our original date was May 11th at his main camp on Beteau. May 18th was OUR back up date LOL!Here's hoping we see each other on the 18th.
1709673,rocko0305,2013-04-24 08:53:00,138,"I sure hope you are able to get out, because we are coming in to Beteau on May 25."
1709929,tooski,2013-04-24 09:47:00,393,"Solo, Why would you fly into Windsor? It's larger, farther north and probably deeper. Wouldn't it be frozen longer than Beteau?"
1709961,rocko0305,2013-04-24 09:50:00,138,"Mike can answer since this question was meant for him, but the worry is not with Eddie's lakes being frozen still, but rather with Cordingley Lake in Nakina not being iced out so the planes can't take off to even get us to Eddie's lakes."
1710057,tooski,2013-04-24 10:14:00,393,"Thanks Rock, You are correct . Just hung up with Eddie as the wife and I are doing Windsor in mid-June and he explained that Cordingley was the problem (if there is one). Said Beteau and Windsor have great flow so ice out is not an issue. Good luck on Beteau..."
1710657,Mike Borger,2013-04-24 13:01:00,1554,"Exactly, perfect answer. The Attawapiskat is a river with a powerful current."
1711657,deputy dog,2013-04-24 18:17:00,305,"Solo, what are your feelings on ice being gone in nakina by the time we are supposed to fly out?"
1712049,Mike Borger,2013-04-24 19:32:00,1554,60% chance we'll fly on the 18th imo. Long range forecast looks great.
