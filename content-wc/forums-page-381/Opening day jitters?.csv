1719529,JayM5209,2013-04-27 10:02:00,1050,"Dave, I'm going anyway and I quit fretting about it! First week solo and then meet up with the annual crew of six for the 2nd week. Last evening I kicked in the contingency plan: 1) went through the stack of unread books and pulled out Goodwin's Lincoln book, Team of Rivals, and a 700 page tome on the life and work of Aldo Leopold, 2) added a 2nd can of coffee to the grocery list, 3) put two cameras and lenses in a day pack for exploring/hiking if the snow's not too deep but the lake is still frozen. I'm ready. A couple of quite days watching the ice melt will be a restorative tonic for the soul!"
1719569,wallydave,2013-04-27 10:33:00,2151,Jay sounds like you have a good plan B! I like the quiet aspect of getting away! Either way have a great trip!
1720825,HeHooksHimself,2013-04-28 04:45:00,725,"Dave, our only trip this year is opening week. Of course we are concerned that our typical agenda will be affected. Our operator told us we should have ""alternate"" plans for Friday night since we had made arrangements to go in a day early (a benefit for opening weekers). That's difficult because I do not want to pay for a hotel and then not use it and if we wait until we get there I am afraid there will be no openings anywhere near where we put in. I am excited about the warmer weather up there but was disheartened with the picture from Kenora showing a typical Februaty scene. At the end of the day, though, we are heading north on May 16 with every intention of getting into camp on Friday May 17 and attacking the lake trout, which should be flopping around in the shallows waiting for a look out our Perch colored X-raps. If we have to do something different it will be better than what i would be doing back here, no matter what! Fish On!"
1721545,wallydave,2013-04-28 09:03:00,2151,A bad day fishing beats a good day at work! Weather is always a challenge! Many of my favorite stories and memories are how the group comes together to face challenges! How people respond to the unknown is an interesting study. By the end of the trip sharing how the group rises to the challenges is just as important as stories of those lakers rising to chase your raps! Have a great trip!
1762561,wallydave,2013-05-10 07:43:00,2151,A week to go for all those opening day groups! Any news on your favorite opening day lakes?FYI Andrea thinks the NW section of LS will be open with some ice still in the lake.

1778121,fishguide1800,2013-05-15 19:02:00,84,Eagle lake is open in the vermilionbay area
1778257,HeHooksHimself,2013-05-15 19:54:00,725,"She said a good west wind has opened up Wine lake, no ice can be seen. However, the west wind blew it all to the opening to Cedar Lake, so no access to the portage. We are pretty sure we will be able to get in on Saturday morning."
