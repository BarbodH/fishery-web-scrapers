1737977,Fish_Heads,2013-05-02 21:17:00,154,"I picked up a vintage unopened box of Winchester ""Ranger"" 16 gauge shot shells at a flea market. They were probably made in the1950's or early '60's.The owner of our Lodge we go to in Canada has a field springer named ""Ranger"". The dog is the public relations ambassador of the camp & everyone knows him.This old box of shells (they would probably still fire, but how well I don't know) would look great above his bar on the shelf in the lodge. They have a neat picture of a springer on the box.Would there be any issues giving him the ammo as a gift to display in the lodge with bringing it in from the states ?See pic below as well as a picture of the real ""ranger"".Thanks for any help you can provide. I really don't want to discard the ammo, as it's a sealed box with a $1.19 price sticker from way back when & it would devalue it to open it.Thanks Fish"

1739881,F250,2013-05-03 10:25:00,75,"The rules for the importing of firearms and ammo from the US into Canada, have recently changed. I live in the US but have a Canadian Firearms Possession and Acquisition License (PAL). Yesterday I spent quite a lot of time at a Canadian Customs office when I was taking one of my shotguns to a Quebec gunsmith. I had done my homework with the RCMP and knew I had the correct answers. Long story short - I pointed out the law changes to the Customs Agents (politely) and advised them to reference : Operational Bulletin PRG - 2012 - 19 Changes to Import Requirements for Firearms."

UnquoteAs F250 pointed out - look at this.... there is a section on Importation of ammunition by non residents"" Paragraph 149.With this in mind, a phone call could probably remove all doubt"
