We have fished lac Seul for several years, but have been considering trying a trip and staying on one of the River camps. I have read other posts here and it is hard to compare. Some say the numbers are great fishing the river and others say it is nothing to get your limit each day. I don't want a limit a day, as I can do that on the American side of LOW. We have enjoyed Lac Seul because of the numbers, but just looking for something a little different. Any info would be appreciated. Thanks."

We fish separation lake north of kenoria when we fish the English river. I've had several over 100+walleye days on both. I love the smallmouth fishing on the English river.
