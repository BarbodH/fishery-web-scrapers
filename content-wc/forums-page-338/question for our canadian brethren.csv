2583361,Guest,2014-03-22 18:13:00,0,"This doesn't pertain to only fishing and hunting, although some of that is certainly a part of this observation. My wife and I just returned from a two week cruise in the Caribbean. Next to US citizens the ships second most numerous passengers to Americans were Canadians from both English speaking and French speaking areas. We had pleasant conversations with many. We share so much of the same lifestyle and values that I truly feel we are brothers and sisters. On the long drive up 95 to home in Pennsylvania, I saw many motorhomes and cars belonging to Canadian citizens. We share our two countries. May it always remain that way."
2583393,Jack77,2014-03-22 18:29:00,168,"We just got back from Riveria Maya and the resort we were at was about 50% Canadian. I talked with many Canadians and enjoyed them all. I am with you, I always feel a kinship with our brothers and sisters from the north."
2528978,SinOrSwim,2014-03-07 13:44:00,1528,"So, do you folks from up north try to talk with the accents or dialect like we all seem to do when we go north? Not sure why but everyone seems to try and talk like a Canadian when in Canada. Granted we way over do it. Adding an Eh behind everything."
2529258,Skywagon,2014-03-07 14:39:00,1106,and I have such a great answer to that.... but it's not PC.
2529874,Mike Borger,2014-03-07 17:10:00,1554,"October to April I fish Stateside a ton for steelhead. I fish NY, PA and OH a lot, but nothing compares to Michigan. Next to fishing the far north, fishing Michigan's rivers for steelhead is my favorite thing to do."
2529898,Mike Borger,2014-03-07 17:11:00,1554,What accent?
2530154,elkman99,2014-03-07 18:10:00,180,"Fred, if it was up to me, you'd be welcome anyday of the week! It's too bad that common sense doesn't come into play at the borders. If you ever get a chance to come to central IL, IL buy you a beer and sick you on some of these crappie down here. we can always use a good stick in my boat."
2530226,Andre (wallyandre),2014-03-07 18:19:00,2274,"I fish Lake Champlain NY & Vermont side 60 days at least for lakers, landlock & bassHave been denied entry for that? If not you won't be denied entry in the US for that but a US resident could be denied entry to Canada with this except if he fill a paper (don't remember the name of that piece of paper)"
2530538,Bill Krejca,2014-03-07 19:45:00,6107,"Prov - re:18"" crappie - You are talking in Ontario? Anywhere that you are willing to share? Thanks, Bill"
2530546,weston,2014-03-07 19:46:00,18,"I spend a lot of time in southern Florida fishing bass and specks(crappies in florida) and saltwater for redfish, tarpon and snook. Hunt gators and hogs."
2530978,Wolfwasp,2014-03-08 00:29:00,9,"I fish in Hawai'i when I go over. Usually one or two sometimes 3 times per winter. I can recommend Magic Charters out of Honolulu. They really try to catch fish. Can't beat it for a couple of hundred bucks. I have been out from before sun up and back after sun down on occasion. You get a full day. Never been skunked. I just looked for my pictures and they are on a laptop. Have had some impressive catches of Ahi Tuna, Sails, Mahi Mahi, biggest Marlin so far was 450. The Captain holds some records. Its worth taking a fishing day if you are there. You will sleep real good that night."
2531210,97roughneck,2014-03-08 06:28:00,899,Just curious if you ship that meat back home then?
2526954,elkman99,2014-03-07 06:38:00,180,"It's obvious from this website that lots of us Americans love the great natural resources that Canada has. Having said that, do any of our friends up north come to the states for fishing or hunting??? I figure lots come for the beaches and warm weather during the winter, but was just curious about our fish and game."
2527274,v-bay gord,2014-03-07 07:47:00,3168,I've hunted pheasants in S. Dakota and Kansas. A one time goose hunting experience while at a sport show in Green Bay. No fishing though...I'm pretty spoiled where I live.

Man do I love catching big ole bull bluegills and slab crappies. You guys are starting to get some nice crappie fishing up there too. But if you want the really bigguns, Kentucky Lake, Toledo Bend, and some of the resevoirs in Mississippi and Alabama will give you a shot at a 4 pounder. That would make a great trip for you guys in March/April before your season starts."
2527426,Algoma Guy,2014-03-07 08:07:00,48,I live right on the border of Michigan and Ontario and fish the St Mary's river a lot. I always purchase my Michigan license to be able to fish the entire river......although this year they have raised the price for non residents to over $70. Terrific multi species area to fish!
2527690,gordy28,2014-03-07 08:53:00,437,"Most of my US travelling has been for family vacations or businessThat being said I have fised quite a few times in Florida - primarily around New Pprt Richey/Dunedin area on the flats - love Sea Trout fishingHave also done some bass fishing around OrlandoOn my bucket list is a fins and skins trip as I love to golf - maybe Michigan, maybe Florida, maybe... well too many area's to choose from to list them all"

2528122,FrankLeigh,2014-03-07 10:01:00,80,"My wife has a number of relatives in Delaware, Maryland and the Philadelphia area, and I have fished with the ""outlaws"" in Delaware Bay, Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic in various places from Ocean City Md. down to Cape Hatteras. Also, I also try to get out wherever I am, from Myrtle Beach to Florida. Salt water fishing is much different from fresh water in that you usually have no idea what is going to be on the end of your line. I have not, as yet, tied into anything really big, but I will go every chance that I get!FrankLeigh"
2528714,adempsey,2014-03-07 12:33:00,963,"I know people that go hunting and fish the rivers. Mostly relatives of people who live in the USA though. I've never done it myself. There are so many places to fish here in Canada I don't know if I would bother unless I just happen to already be going there. Especially given the border hassles (at least potentially, obviously everyones experience is different - mine have not been that great) and the exchange rate.However, if you're talking Alaska count me in!! I'd probably go fishing in Hawaii too, lol. Of course, if I were into saltwater fishing I'd probably be going down south far more often."
2528770,Guest,2014-03-07 12:54:00,0,"I used too come to the states for the odd tourney But not since 9-11 , Because i had a charge for mischief (Drunk Bar fight) When i was young and stupid. And can't be bothered to get a waiver. Apparently common sense went out the window that day with your border and ours . P.S Us average middle age slightly over weight guys aren't your country's threat , Even though I'm pretty dangerous with a fishin rod...LOL"
