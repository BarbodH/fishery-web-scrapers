I remember the fishing being good, not great! I remember getting robbed a time or two there not catching the fish that the ""Canadian trip"" reputation has. I remember trolling Rapalas 30-40ft in Big Sand catching walleyes in 100 ft of water. I remember the northern lights being incredible! The boat ride home from Big Sand to Minaki took 20-30mins and the northern lights would get us home. I never see Minaki talked about on this thread. Do people still go? Is it anyones favorite town/resort? Do any of you fish Big Sand in the late evenings trolling shad raps, etc Fish on!!"
