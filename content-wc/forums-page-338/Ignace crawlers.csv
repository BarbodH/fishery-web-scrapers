We will be crossing border close to Thunder Bay, going west to Ignace and then north on hiway 599. We thought it would be easier and less hassle to get the crawlers once we crossed the border."

2602633,Fishoil,2014-03-27 14:03:00,1277,Good point!! Best to call ahead and not be disappointed.
2604946,northerneyes,2014-03-28 06:44:00,72,"Sounds like I can stop at Larry's in KF, then if they are out I can stop at Vern's in Ignace. Thanks to all for the info."
2605442,Skywagon,2014-03-28 08:21:00,1106,"I would agree with fishoil, call both ahead of time to make sure. If you did not call and bomb out at both places, your next closest bait shop is 80 miles down the road."
