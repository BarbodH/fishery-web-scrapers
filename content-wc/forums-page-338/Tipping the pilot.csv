He then got out of the plain and turned all the boats over and put the motors on for us. Best $100 we ever spent.Fast forward 1 year. Grumpy ol' R Lee Ermey drill seargant looking guy. Pointed to our boats and said ""they are over there. Don't scratch them when you flip them over."" Worst $40 we ever spent. He din't earn any of it IMHO."
2597009,Whopper,2014-03-26 08:55:00,340,"It amazes me sometimes what I see go on with tipping. Myself I give what I think is fair to what ever service I get. I do flyin's with two different groups of people, one group that has taken my under their wing I am the youngster at 58. They tip well, the dock help and cabin maid at camp get tips. The pilots that take us in get tips, heck we've even tipped the camp owner. Now the other group of fellas I go with are a different story, most are around my age and most think the cost of the trip is enough. I still tip the pilot. I don't think the pilot of any float plane I've been on flies any safer because of a tip or not. Guys I work with are terrible about tipping waitresses at lunch time, sometimes I'm embarrassed."
2597177,Golden Eagle,2014-03-26 09:38:00,2642,"Could it be that the older group you fish with has a proud ""R"" beside their names and the other guys go with a ""d""?"
2597337,Skywagon,2014-03-26 10:11:00,1106,"For the most part, bush pilots are not paid that well and even of those that are, a lot get layed off during the winter. Many times bush pilots are being paid starvation wages, as it is one of the few ways to build hours to qualify to get into the airlines, where wages are better. It is like being a waitress, the tips are part of the pay. If you think the price of fly-in's are too high and the outfitters are making a killing, they are not. Many of the planes you are flying in on, cost a million dollars plus, just a run of the mill 1950's Beaver with an old radial engine are in the $400,000 range. All of these planes burn 30 gallons or more of $7 fuel an hour. Insurance and upkeep are ridicules, all of that and the plane may sit, not generating income for many months out of the year. Another reason for pilot's low pay. Nobody is getting rich in the bush flying business."
2597433,SinOrSwim,2014-03-26 10:41:00,1528,"Imo we are not usually tipping based on him flying us alone. It has as much or more to do with the fact he is helping us load and unload our gear, doing general maintenance at the cabin, changing tanks, check solar, frigs and freezers, gas tanks etc. Some people are good tippers and some are not."

Hanging out with Goldeneagle in NWO I have come to understand what these camp operators and support people go through for us to enjoy our time with them. We want our outfitter to be profitable"

2599329,BornToFish,2014-03-26 19:22:00,1224,"I readily admit that I am old-school. I've always believe that people providing a service should earn their tip, and not be given it simply because they showed up to work and provided the bare minimum of service they are expected to deliver. A wait staff person that takes my order and brings me my meal, never to be seen at any other time during my stay at the restaurant, may not receive a tip. However, if the same person is pleasant, refills my water glass, offers guidance on pairing a wine with our meals, or checks on us during the meal to ensure everything is satisfactory, this person will do very well by me. I have been on many float planes throughout Canada for hunting and fishing trips. I have two situations to cite that I desire to mention. In one situation, my wife and I went with a group of folks on a day fly-in trip. My lodge owner forewarned me that some of the motors on the boats weren't working well, if at all. He said to ask the pilot to stay with us to ensure that the motors started. I asked the pilot when he dropped us off to stay a few minutes to ensure all motors started. His reply was that we should pull the choke out, pull the starter cord twice and then push in the choke. He was gone in a flash. Needless to say, one of the motors refused to start. One of the guys on the trip had a fish stringer in his tackle box that he used to tow the boat with the bad motor. We couldn't even find a good anchor line to use as a tow rope. The pilot didn't get much, if any, of a tip from anyone that day. On a different day fly-in trip, our group encouraged our pilot to pick us up a little bit later than our scheduled 4:00 p.m. pick up time. We said that we would make it worth his while to come around 5:00 p.m. or so. We left the door wide open for him to make a handsome tip. He was quite irritated with us when we weren't standing at the end of the dock with our gear packed up when he arrived just before 4:00 p.m.. We were fishing about 150 yards from the dock when he approached the lake on his flight in. We arrived at the dock about the same time that he arrived. I understand that bush pilots and guides have a limited season to earn their annual income. However, providing a bare minimum of service won't garner much of a tip from me. My tip is in proportion to the quality of service provided that is above and beyond the bare minimum which I hired them to provide in the first place. I have had pilots do well by me. On the other hand, some pilots didn't do so well. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
2592561,oldfart,2014-03-25 08:28:00,21,"Is there any ""rule of thumb"" for tipping the floatplane pilots??? We've usually tipped them $20 per person per flight(in-out), and assumed that they pass some on to the dock guys. Does this sound about right???? Never had a rude pilot"
2592665,Golden Eagle,2014-03-25 08:50:00,2642,Just sayin'. Bush pilots don't make the money we would expect them to bring in for the work they do. They deserve tip money.
2592905,bigwalleye1,2014-03-25 09:48:00,2632,"...and since they weren't rude and always found you again, I'd say you're doing good re: the tip."
2592929,octanehi5,2014-03-25 10:04:00,1104,"$20 each on the way in and $20 each on the way out is the norm, The pilots will also remember you as you come back for return trip."
2593633,Pikeslayer8,2014-03-25 13:20:00,1460,"We as a society tip our waitstaff when we go out to eat. We tip the valet a few bucks for getting your truck, tip the airport porter, we tip cab drivers and barbers and hotel maids.......... We as sportsmen on a fly-in have the most unique privilege to be able to tip the pilots and dock staff while on vacation to our favorite place on earth. Face it, the bush pilot and dock staff are responsible for our safety getting to and from our destination. They hold the keys to our kingdom. Best take good, no, great care of them. And don't assume the pilots will turn around and pass on some tip to the dockboy. I like to tip dockboy on the way out, as he is usually in charge of details, ice, bed liners etc... Tip them, it feels good."
2593817,Carnhzkr,2014-03-25 14:22:00,964,"I'm probably going to sound like a tight-azz heel, but I guess I'm not a very good tipper. I tip my waiters & waitresses well, usually around 20% (and with my bar bill, that can add up), but other than that, I hate tipping. I'll be doing a fly-in this summer, and if I hadn't read this thread, I probably wouldn't even have thought about tipping the pilot, after all, I don't tip the pilot or flight crew when I fly on United.After having read this, I'll be sure to throw a few bucks toward the pilot, but sheesh, $20 pp each way sounds pretty friendly to me. That'd be $80 just in pilot tips for my son and me. I've been on several cruises and my least favorite part of each is the last day when you have to shell out several hundred dollars in various tips. Jeez, I feel like a tight old curmudgeon."
2594129,polaris-pete,2014-03-25 15:30:00,343,"Flying United sure isn't like flying in a Bush Plane.On all the trips I have been on $20 in and out is what we pay.We give the Dock Guys money also but depends on how many are there. Our Pilots always make our trip enjoyable and do a lot of work to keep their Customers coming back each Year. Last Year we had a small problem with the cabins water supply pump and our Pilot spent 45 minutes getting it ready to go for us. When you spend a couple Grand on a fishing trip, the extra $4-60 makes no real difference to us."
2594177,forgop,2014-03-25 15:37:00,880,"I've only been on one trip and didn't even think to tip the pilot. That said, I've read several reviews where the group has attempted to tip the pilot and it was refused. I know that may vary from one pilot to the next as well as one outfitter to another."
2594601,octanehi5,2014-03-25 17:02:00,1104,"The pilot or dock hand may refuse a tip but if you offer it it is their choice to except it or not. In my past experiance of 25 yrs doing fly ins, the pilots you tip will remember you by name, as well as your crew. your pilot is your lifeline to the outside world, They get you in and out of some very rough country, You spent more than $1000 on most trips,its not worth the $20 both ways?? In Italian we call that Scoumbadi, (Cheap) They flew the wood in to build the cabin over your head, the boats you fish in the motors that propel the boats.The propane that runs the fridge,hot water,lights, Gas for boats and water pumps. the food your eating the fish you take home.If thats not enough to tip him you belong on a drive to location thats all fished out."
2594873,oleJoe,2014-03-25 18:05:00,114,He didn't fly those building materials in for free. When they start the engine some one is paying. With that said we always tip the pilot $50 in and the same out. The dock hands we do separate. Its usually the same pilot yr after yr but different dock hands. Saying that I can't wait to get there!
