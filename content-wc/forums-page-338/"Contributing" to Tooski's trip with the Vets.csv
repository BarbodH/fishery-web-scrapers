2598649,tooski,2014-03-26 16:53:00,393,"From ifish, (Jerry), Some things that I missed... Sunscreen, repellent, gloves, etc as you can see---Great donation..."
2599665,tooski,2014-03-26 20:48:00,393,"Not only can I not take a picture of the latest donation, I really don't know what to say. I guess I can only say what Mark Terwall (Terwalleye) said in his e-mail... "" I have commented for years that fishermen ""get it."" What I mean by that is it seems like fishermen seem to understand what is most important in life. Family, enjoying the outdoors, respecting each other,"" Pretty much sums it up. Mark has donated a Gander Mtn gift card in the amount of $100.00."
2600481,tooski,2014-03-27 07:32:00,393,"Another gift, this time from Scott Gruns aka Jambi from WC. Again, all quality lures."
2600601,dutchboy,2014-03-27 07:49:00,5717,My guess is the good folks of WC are going to bury you in stuff. Maybe a reminder of what you are doing and when you are doing it in this thread? I know I missed the first announcement.
2600937,tooski,2014-03-27 08:38:00,393,"Good guess on getting swamped. That is a good reflection on the board though. To re-cap...... I am taking two vets on a fly-in trip through Hidden Bay Outfitters. I have substantial donations from the local VFW and Amvets here in Sh Lake, OH. Enough money that the vets will have a great trip and pay for nothing. Some posters asked if they could send money but I really had enough from the local vet organizations. Phishfearme (Bob Kerr) had the idea that in lieu of money maybe lures, line, hardware etc could be donated. It has since taken off. On a side note I am trying to keep track of who donated what and will post on what the vets caught with various donators lures. Should be interesting although certainly not very scientific. Hope this helped. Joe T[email protected]"
2601681,RickOnt,2014-03-27 11:08:00,217,Hi Joe What fish are you targeting? Is there anything you have not received that you think you will need? Rick
2601785,tooski,2014-03-27 11:16:00,393,"Rick, We'll be targeting walleye but I'm thinking it will be interesting to see one of the vets tie into a nice size northren as neither has ever fished Canada before. Can you e-mail me in a week or so as I will have a better idea what, if anything. we are missing. Thanks,[email protected]"
2601985,RickOnt,2014-03-27 11:38:00,217,Ok Joe I was thinking of some Twister Tails and Grubs. Rick
2552266,phishfearme,2014-03-13 19:43:00,1242,"Many of you have read Joe ""Tooski""'s post about the trip he's coordinated with some wounded vets. Even though I was unable to qualify for the trip (either that or they didn't want someone to bring black and gold championship philosophy to brown and white whining!!!""), I - like many of you - would still like to contribute in some way to the success of this trip for the vets. Although Joe is uncomfortable with direct financial contributions, he is very receptive to contributions from us that take the form of lures, spoons, jigs, line or whatever most all of us have too many of in our tackle boxes. So, if you're interested, contact Joe via email at: Joe T <[email protected]> (his PM box is pretty full) and he will provide shipping info. He promised to post photos of the Vets with catches using the items we contribute. thanks, phish"

2554033,tooski,2014-03-14 10:45:00,393,Thanks Jambi for the pike lure offer. Our hope is that we get enough lures donated that I can have the vets pretty much use the donor lures exclusively. I will TRY to keep track of whose donated lures catch the most/largest fish for John and Wayne (the disabled vets). When I post the trip report I will include the list for best lures. Should turn out to be more interesting than the trip report.... One caveat- I wouldn't send me any sentimental favorites as I'm guessing these guys are gonna lose a ton of lures so don't expect any returns. I'm thinking any lures that survive I will put on a display board so they will have a memento of the trip....
2560017,tooski,2014-03-16 10:47:00,393,"I have a small favor to ask of those that are sending us lures. If you have time could you pinch off the barbs on the hooks? No biggie if you don't (or already mailed them) as I can do it as they arrive. Also if there is space on the lure, an identifying mark would be great. Again, thanks for the responses.....[email protected]"
2561425,BuckeyeBill,2014-03-16 17:58:00,76,"Tooski , just sent you an email."
2566049,JAY221,2014-03-18 07:24:00,877,"Tooski, Please let us know if you come up short on anything in particular as it gets closer to time to go to see if we can round up some help for you. Package sent. Later, Jay"
2594793,1shooter,2014-03-25 17:47:00,1493,Just sent you a email
2595777,Mike Kansas,2014-03-25 20:46:00,1463,"oops Joe, Didn't pinch barbs down and they are in the mail. Hope you have a pliers and a free hour. Mike Kansas"
2596385,tooski,2014-03-26 06:37:00,393,"I'll take care of it Mike. I use a dremel tool. Gives me something to do while watching ""Dancing with the Stars"" and ""American Idol""....."
2596889,Mike Kansas,2014-03-26 08:36:00,1463,"Sorry, I hate to bother you while you are watching such educational programs. Mike"
