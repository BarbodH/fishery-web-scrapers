2571017,Knoxabilly,2014-03-19 12:15:00,225,"Jig and Minnow or leech is my favorite set up. Usually using 1/8 leadhead and 3-4"" grub tipped with one of these. I've never used crawlers- I head up in May yearly. I always have a rod rigged with slip bobber- sometimes that can't be beat!"
2572129,michigan walleye guy,2014-03-19 18:05:00,95,"This is the year I am going to bring a flat of crawlers on each of my Canada trips. Cannot disregard the sage advice of many who swear by this bait. First trip is in May, and we always have brought over 100 dozen minnows, which is not only super expensive, but also eats into the weight allowance for the fly ins. I'm still bringing minnows, just not as many this year.Has anybody ordered a flat of crawlers from Cabela's? What is the quality of these crawlers compared to the I-Falls or Nestor Falls bait shops??"
2572673,btmbncr,2014-03-19 20:39:00,492,"Early spring,cold water minnows work best.In June to mid July crawlers after mid July Leeches have been best for me.Bill"
2578481,cuamb,2014-03-21 11:14:00,203,"X3 what Camp Chef said. I've been going since '83. Started with minnows, went to leeches and now all we use is crawlers with some preserved minnows as back up (although I don't know why)."
2588177,CMesserschmidt,2014-03-24 08:56:00,1006,For me it seems like it depends on the lake I have fished. I went with some friends a few years back to Minnitaki and I couldn't catching anything unless I used a lindy setup with a floating jig and minnow. On Lac Seul last year we hammered them on just a stand up jig and minnow. Seemed like color was key as well.My buddy had a poop yellow/brown jig which did very well and I had the firetiger color.
2595265,walleyeduran,2014-03-25 19:06:00,286,"Got to love the poop yellow/brown jig. This is the ugliest jig in the box that comes out when all the pretty colors have failed. (you can be nice and call it a dark mustard color jig), but poop baby sh_t yellow works also."
2606634,Rgate,2014-03-28 11:51:00,14,On lake of the Woods I use big jigs and a large minnow. Some think I'm crazy but I use a 3/4 oz. jig and have caught many big walleyes on shallow reefs in the summer and in deep current in the fall.
2570217,Cash,2014-03-19 09:12:00,73,"Which set up have you had more success with? Or maybe something entirely different? I've been a jig and minnow fisherman my whole life. Almost always had great luck with a 1/4 oz. jig, a chartreuse twister tail and a minnow. Rarely had to make any changes. But last June on Minnetaki the slip sinker fisherman owned us jig and minnow guys. I had to move over to the dark side mid-week. Lots cheaper too. Night crawlers cost a lot less than minnows. I'll be bringing crawlers this year for sure. Whats your go to bait for walleyes?"
2570225,octanehi5,2014-03-19 09:14:00,1104,bring both
2570257,Mike Kansas,2014-03-19 09:21:00,1463,We always bring Minnows and Crawlers and have had good luck with both on a bare jig. In fact the last few years we have done better with crawlers. This is in early June and the crawlers seem to work better when there is good cloud cover. Mike Kansas
2570441,Fishoil,2014-03-19 10:15:00,1277,"1/4 oz Chartruse green/orange jig with a 3"" white twister tail. If they're being really finicky I'll add a salted minnow. It doesn't get much easier or better."
2570481,IaDave,2014-03-19 10:26:00,476,I have fished Minnitaki many times I find a white jig with a large minnow(no plastic) works the best- a lot of smelt in that lake.
2570513,oldfart,2014-03-19 10:29:00,21,"White 1/4oz or 3/8oz Northland jig (depending on wind conditions) with 3"" white Mr Twister tail, tipped with a minnow. Our outfitter is getting cautious about flying live minnows into his lakes because of invasive species, so last year we took some crawlers in addition to the minnows, and did just as well tipping with a piece of crawler, so this year we're taking only crawlers and some salted minnows. Speaking of crawlers, has anyone tried the ""European"" crawlers from Speedy Worm?? At 2-3"" would avoid having to cut the crawler, plus they do better in warm weather."
2570537,Tylumps,2014-03-19 10:32:00,73,"Late May and Early June. Minnows work the best. My thought is that the food source is minnows where water warms in the spring and rivers dump in from spawning grounds. As June starts to end and July around the corner, the walleye transition to ""buggy"" meals like mayflys and leaches. The ""buggy"" food is found on wind blown shorelines. Into July and August, you can probably catch walleyes with anything as long as you put the bait at just above the thermocline on the humps and reefs. So i guess, if you go early you need to spend the bucks on minnow's, if you go later in the season, worms is all you need."
2570593,camp chef,2014-03-19 10:50:00,915,"The last thing I would do is tell someone else how to fish, but for what is worth,after 30 + years of fishing in Canada( our first trip is always the end of May) we fish exclusively with Crawlers. We do carry a bag of preserved minnows as a back up but haven't broken them out in years.If you find the fish, crawlers will work just fine with less cost and hassle.With that said, I would recommend using whatever gives you confidence and makes you feel good."
2570713,bigwalleye1,2014-03-19 11:19:00,2632,"Every dog has his day. I still bring crankbaits, Lindy stuff, slip bobbers, but in Canada, I fish jigs. A friend is trying to get me to bring bouncers. Maybe, but the JIGS STILL GO."
2570897,JayM5209,2014-03-19 11:50:00,1050,"x 2 on the chef's advice and opinion. Our 1st trip of the year is always the last week of May and we quit buying minnows 20+ years. I think I've used minnows three times since, that includes May, early June, late August and September trips. The crawlers work on jigs, Lindy rigs, with slip bobbers, and on spinner rigs behind bottom bouncers. It's not the cost issue for me, it's the hassle of transporting minnows and keeping them alive. Crawlers are just much, much easier to deal with.P.S. Last spring we got several flats of very, very nice crawlers at Dutchies on the 105, and the price was very reasonable - less than I could get them in the States."
