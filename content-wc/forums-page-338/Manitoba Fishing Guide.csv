2577665,h8go4s,2014-03-21 07:54:00,1673,The Northwest Sportshow opens in Minneapolis on Wednesday and I can almost guarantee the Manitoba Tourism booth will have it. I don't think the Manitoba website gets updated in a timely manner on some of these things. I've applied online once or twice for a fishing license using the previous year's form and it works. Request the fishing guide and I'm sure they'll send you the new one. It won't cost you anything.
