2576113,Sportdog,2014-03-20 17:14:00,6735,"What type of baitfish forage exists in the English River system, specifically the river type areas of stronger current flow and also the larger deeper lakes that hold lake trout. Or I guess that top color combinations would also answer my question as I want to ""match the hatch"" so to speak. Thanks gentlemen."

Perch are everywhere in the system. Trout perch and darters are common as well. The standard ""eating sized"" walleye will frequently have mayfly nymphs in their guts. Ciscoes will also be an important part of the forage for bigger walleye but will be the main diet item for trout in the deeper sections. Regardless, you are probably over thinking this. My go to trout lure is a Len Thompson 5 of diamonds (go big) and I can't recall ever seeing one in any of the trout that I have cleaned!"
2583737,Sportdog,2014-03-22 20:38:00,6735,I'm sure that I am overthinking it. But with the weather refusing to break all I can do is think. LOL!!!! Thanks for the response and tips. Much appreciated.
