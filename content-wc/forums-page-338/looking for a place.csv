2606834,jkonop,2014-03-28 12:28:00,544,I have some buddies that from here in WI that own a place on Red Lake. One of that just made contact with a realtor and and went from there. They told the realtor they were interested in the Ear Falls region and he found places w/n an hour so so of there. He just went and looked at a 1/2 dozen or so for sale. Just like buying a house around here. my 2 cents
