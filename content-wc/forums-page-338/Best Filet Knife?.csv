2580969,GWC,2014-03-22 04:22:00,1021,I use a Buck fillet knife. It's a Titanium Coated Steel blade. I clean a lot of fish each year. I use a Lansky sharping kit once or twice a year to maintain the blade. Bought mine at one of the outlet stores in Branson. Good investment & I have both of these:https://www.buckknives.com/index.cfm...productID=3568http://www.cabelas.com/product/Buck-...fe/1617880.uts

2560097,Larry Mac,2014-03-16 11:02:00,530,"Hi Bill, it is interesting that you say that. I have accumulated and used many fillet knives over the years and this black one my sister in law gave me many years ago is my favorite. This knife and has cleaned many, many fish. When I was reading this article I seen Cutco mentioned a few times so I looked it up on the internet and low and behold that is the my go to knife that was given to me LOL. I do have a Wusthof that I have not used yet (it is so nice but I keep using the Cutco LOL) I will break it out and try it this year but my black knife (cutco) will also be with me. Take CareThank youLarry Mac"

2560153,stillangling,2014-03-16 11:18:00,149,"I have a Leech Lake knife but would have never paid that much money myself. It was a gift and certainly is a beautiful thing to look at. I promptly ground the top of it to dull the thing (the top of the bade is sharpened for the first couple of inches). I could never understand that feature. i had a guy demonstrate his technique using the top of the blade but it had me scratching my head at the end. It certainly didn't impressive to me. The Leech Lake is good and flexible, like the Rapala and both have steel that is soft enough that you can put an edge back on them with a couple of strokes with the Lansky Quick Edge. I have read that Leech Lake knives are produced by Custom Cutlery. Assuming that is correct, they are a cheaper source of what is basically the same knife.http://www.customcutlery.com/fillet.html"
2560209,bigtimeelectric,2014-03-16 11:33:00,174,I bought a leech lake a few years ago nice knife. I always thought the blade at the top was for the first cut through the skin of the fish just so the regular blade lasts longer between sharpening.. I used it for a couple years till I realized I am just much better with a electric knife. I've had a mister twister for a long time which has been fine. However yesterday I went to Cabelas and bought a new Rapala 120 volt model. I like the design better with a smaller tip and teeth that go all the way to the end. I also did not want a cordless as every place I clean fish there is power and I know that every time I would go to clean fish with a battery knife it would be dead or dying just my luck!!!!! don't need the aggravation!!!!!
2562001,Obabikon,2014-03-16 21:48:00,2370,"I've got a relatively inexpensive fiskars knife that I love. I've used Rapala, and for the price, you can't beat it."
2562106,Kartman35,2014-03-17 00:20:00,245,"Mora of Sweden makes an inexpensive filet knife out of Sandvik 12C27....Which is a steel that should easily outperform the 420J used by Rapala in it's ability to take a sharper edge and hold it longer. Of course the type of steel alone doesn't guarantee a great performing blade, it has to be heat treated and tempered properly, but Mora does have a reputation for making high quality inexpensive knives. Zwilling and Wusthof's ""forged"" lines (they don't really forge them anymore)...are claimed to be hardened to 58 on the Rockwell scale....which should make them also hold a keener edge longer than the Rapalas (or the Cutcos which are made of a lower grade of steel called 440A) Another good compromise of price/performance is the Victorinox and Wusthof stamped knives which are made of the same steel steel but hardened to 56 or around the same as the Cutcos. indeed the back of the Leech lake knife (and Buck knives make a copy called 'Clearwater') is intended to make the first cut behind the fins so as not to dull the main cutting edge on the scales of the fish. As was written earlier the same knife can be had without the sharp back for less money from Custom Cutlery who makes the LL knife. Given the funds (around 400 CDN)this would be my choice...http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwZjTD5XZTM S35VN steel hardened to 61 HRC and a Maple burl handle handmade."
2562929,bigwalleye1,2014-03-17 09:10:00,2632,"+1 for the Chicago. I got one right after we got married, 27 years ago, and it's still going strong. Picked up a couple spares without the sheath at the Chicago Cutlery outlet store in Branson, but don't expect I'll ever have to open 'em. I can't wear this one out. Also, I have a folding Chicago Traveler that I like for the ribs. The standard knife would work fine also, but that little traveler is so nice and flexible."

2566585,Flip Silverlake,2014-03-18 09:40:00,645,"Got my dad's Imperial Cutlery knife when he passed away. Haven't found anything close to it. Blade has the perfect curve for cleaning fish. Don't need electricity to make it work. Must be close to 50 years old, wouldn't part with it for the world. Haven't seen on in a store for years. Reddens used to have them but they haven't had them on the shelf for at least 10 years. I don't think they are even made anymore."

2557122,bensen,2014-03-15 10:05:00,155,"Buy a Wustof & you'll never buy another knife unless you lose it. You need a blade that is forged, not stamped. Most cheap knife blades are stamped & not all Wustof's are forged. I have a Wustof Classic Ikon 7"" Fillet knife with a forged blade. Not cheap but your only buying 1."
2557466,camp chef,2014-03-15 11:45:00,915,"I, too have a Wustof.This knife will long outlast me."
2557482,michigan walleye guy,2014-03-15 11:54:00,95,"How do you guys think the Wustof compares to the Rapala? I'm no expert, but my Rapala gives me about 6-7 years of serious usage before I usually replace it. Granted, I don't filet as many fish as some guys but I am the designated filet guy and camp cook on our Canada trips and so I stay in practice."
2557554,camp chef,2014-03-15 12:09:00,915,Well I had several Rapalas and now I have a Wustof...last fillet knife I will ever need. I did get it as gift though.I am not sure I would have shelled out for it out of my own pocket.
2557586,Skywagon,2014-03-15 12:23:00,1106,"So which model Gustof fillet knife is the best, if price is not a concern? I am not familiar with them, always looking for something better."
2557610,camp chef,2014-03-15 12:32:00,915,I have the 7 inch classic flexible....Only one I have used. This would be my choice.
2557730,LLewellin,2014-03-15 14:16:00,1790,I use my American Angler electric 95% of the time. Much faster and waist is almost zero. If not electric I use my Leech Lake knife made by Don Canney from Iowa. Very good blade and it handles great besides it looks great too. http://www.reedssports.com/Product/p...etail&_ID=3973
2558657,kliph,2014-03-15 20:41:00,2337,"For me it's a knife that holds an edge the longest.That's why I like a Cutco knife. NOT cheap. Blade length 6"" - 9"" adjustable blade. Made in America http://www.cutco.com/products/produc...1#.UyUMic4jqq4"
2559089,ohiojmj,2014-03-16 05:58:00,1262,Ditto! I like the Cutco for the lasting sharp edge and cam lock adjustable blade.
2553617,michigan walleye guy,2014-03-14 08:43:00,95,"I've tried a number of knives over the years, but always come back to the old dependable, the 6"" Rapala knife. Easy to keep sharp, relatively inexpensive, too. I still have the first one in our family, from 1973, given to my Dad for Father's Day that year. I keep it on a shelf along with his old Abu Matic 280 and my first reel, an Abu Matic 170.I have a beautiful 9"" knife from Wolverine Knife Works made here in the yoop in Rapid River, and also a Cabelas model, among a few others. Probably have almost as many filet knives as flashlights, if that's possible.Is there a better knife than the Rapala for under $25?"
2553681,big popi,2014-03-14 09:01:00,635,"I love the Rapalas also. I have the standard and one Superflex. definitely agree these are great knives for the money. I also have a 8"" Mundial, which I gave about $13 for. This keeps an edge well, is a little longer (good for pike). I just bought a Kershaw ProGrade (blue handle) 7.5"", have yet to use it, gave $14 on Amazon. Will have to see how it holds an edge. Not a big fan of the Gerber Gator knife I have, cheap but doesn't hold an edge well. The Wolverine knives look real nice, does it hold an edge well?"
2553737,bushead11,2014-03-14 09:27:00,151,wondering if the bubba blade I see on TV is worth the $55 price tag? Seems to work pretty nice watching the videos of all kinds of fish on their website... Anyone have one?
2553745,btyreprich,2014-03-14 09:30:00,1067,"I too agree with previous posts that Rapala makes an excellent knife for the money. Perceived mine back in the early 80's and works great! So satisfied with it that I'll buy one for my 12 year old son this trip so he can learn how to fillet fish. I wanted a slightly longer blade so I went on eBay and purchased an Elk River brand. Looks just like the Uncle Henry brand fillet knife. This came out of the package razor sharp - blade is flexible, great balance, and easy to work with. Quite satisfied with this purchase."

Got the 9"" Flex and the 9"" Tapered Flex. Was getting harder and harder to find replacement blades for my American Angler elect knives and the Bubba's came highly recommended to me by some fellow guide friends! They come ""very"" sharp outta the box, will see how they hold up cleaning Stripers, Hybrid Stripers and big catfish!!"
