2562305,prov1800,2014-03-17 05:49:00,5010,"I would never trust any maps.just need to go easy if your not familiar with a area, better of spending a littleslower time on the water and learn what your going over."
2567217,CamoHunter,2014-03-18 12:34:00,363,"Careful of thinking these maps are way better than previous. They look nice, and appear to have more data. But by clicking SonarCharts on and off, you can tell if improvements were actually made (by people uploading sonar logs), or if they are just the same maps, with contour lines filling in the blanks. I can tell you the depth data is VERY INACCURATE for Lac Seul. There are extremely dangerous rock islands on many waters in Canada, where the depth map shows 20, or even 40 feet deep. Over time, maybe these maps will improve. But unless you know the water, tread cautiously since these maps are almost worthless for avoiding safety hazards. And by that token, pretty much useless for fishing depth information as well.There are some good maps for some of the lakes up there, but the majority of them are unsurveyed. So, until sonar logs are submitted, the maps aren't of much use except for using them to see where you're at on the lake. See my side by side comparison for a section on Lac Seul. SonarCharts off, SonarCharts on."

2551938,Andre (wallyandre),2014-03-13 18:13:00,2274,Great news for the guys that want to look at the water they are going to fish or if you want to compare from one to the other.Don't forget to zoom in to 500m (rule on the bottom right) then once at 500 click on the blue icon on the bottom left of the screen to get the sonar chart view.This is great!http://www.navionics.com/en/webapp
2552274,Rich B,2014-03-13 19:49:00,1081,Thanks for posting that link....I pulled up an Ontario lake I fish as well as LBDN....impressive....Now if this blasted Winter would just go away (ha)....Rich B
2552897,Skywagon,2014-03-14 05:32:00,1106,"Interesting. I could zoom in enough to see my dock in the location it was at 3 years ago, it has since been moved a couple hundred feet around the bay, it tells a little about the age of the view. That should have no baring on your use of this tool unless you are trying to locate my old dock."
2552921,Juls,2014-03-14 05:43:00,13414,"Looks like they haven't gotten around to the lake I'll be headed to this summer....(Meta Lake). Supposed to be 43 mile NW of Nakina, ON. Oh well...maybe it will be added in the future."
2553137,Shellback,2014-03-14 06:33:00,8083,"I wonder how that got done? Navionics used to say Canadian authorities wouldn't allow viewing the lakes. Maybe they changed the law? I'm surprised at all the sonar views, lots of folks must have been sending recordings in. Looks like I better do an update to my card before I leave home."
2553945,Andre (wallyandre),2014-03-14 10:21:00,2274,"For a HB user, it is very easy to get you're lake map,just log the lake on you're Navionics chip and upload the logs to Navionics"
2553977,Juls,2014-03-14 10:38:00,13414,"I use LakeMaster chips...I only have the Navioncis app on my phone, because LakeMaster doesn't have one."
2554017,Andre (wallyandre),2014-03-14 10:42:00,2274,Lakemaster is not very useful in Canada.
2554265,Juls,2014-03-14 11:41:00,13414,No worries....my friend has all the info we need for that lake.
2555617,Andre (wallyandre),2014-03-14 20:23:00,2274,Not worry for you for sure
