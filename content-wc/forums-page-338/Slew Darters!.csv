2604489,tuiflies,2014-03-27 22:00:00,158,"I think minnows are in such high demand, most stores are happy to get anything. I've seen it a couple times where all 4 bait shops in Sioux have been sold out of minnows, waiting for a delivery in the next day or so."
2604658,roscoe33,2014-03-28 03:02:00,653,"Last time I made a comment like that, I was promptly slapped by the internet police for possibly having beer in the boat. The next thing I knew, I was being accused of keeping under sized fish, AND returning to the States with more than my limit. Besides, there is no beer in my boat. But I did say ""swig"". Back to the minnows. I prefer emerald shiners. All those little scales make your teeth (tooth) look purrrty."
2582113,bigtimeelectric,2014-03-22 11:24:00,174,"Does anybody wish they had better minnow choices in Canada? I fish Lac Seul every year and love to jig fish with minnows however when I pay 6 bucks for a dozen minnows I don't want 6 of them to be sickle backs and the other 6 to be sick looking fatheads . HAha. We laugh about them every year, I just wonder why they don't let you have some other options like sucker minnows, chubs, shiners? Just figured I would start a conversation and see if we can twist it around to tarter sauce or drinking to much in Canada!!! I am laughing as I am writing by the way lets not get to serious on a Saturday boys and girls!!"
2582161,micropterus,2014-03-22 11:38:00,450,You don't need minnows or tartar sauce for walleye.
2586505,roscoe33,2014-03-23 18:14:00,653,"Tartar sauce makes the minnows stick in your throat. Better to wash them down with swig of water. Salted minnow are better with tartar sauce, as you actually have to chew them before swallowing."
2591737,btmbncr,2014-03-24 22:52:00,492,"When I stayed at Evergreen Lodge,Gary had Rainbow Dace minnows.They were the best minnows I've used on Lac Seul.Bill"
2591809,kzoofisher,2014-03-25 03:20:00,5144,"In the interest of generating conversation: real fisherman don't need bait. Bait is a crutch for those too lazy to work for the fish as a gentleman would and it is a symptom of the erosion of our society, from one of self reliance and independence, to one where shadowy overlord fisherman feel entitled to claim the benefits worked for by the oppressed minnows. Bait of the world unite! You control the means of production!"
2592993,srj,2014-03-25 10:29:00,971,"Roscoe, really bad advice. NEVER try to flush a throat stuck minnow down with water!! Beer only and brewed in Canada works best."
2593281,bigwalleye1,2014-03-25 11:42:00,2632,"Just what this world needs... A Minnow Union Organizer. Pretty soon we won't be able to fish before 7, after 5, or on Sundays, and premiums will be paid for bait intended to be on the water more than an 8 hour shift. I say bait should work itself to death for the benefit of it's masters! Sheesh. Next you'll want worm bedding provided in Braille for the benefit of the worms so they can stay current on world events!! Where's that dang ""stir the pot"" smiley????"
2594481,kzoofisher,2014-03-25 16:38:00,5144,"You're behind the times. The Federation of International Bait Syndicates has already been formed. Our market research shows that most fisherman are already familiar with F.I.B.S. and admit that catch rates would drop dramatically without them. The syndicates representing leeches and suckers have already signed on, the fatheads are having trouble deciding and the shiners are being hard to corner, as usual. The worms have chosen to side with management. We are receiving considerable opposition from the Pisces Enabling Research for Cleaned Hooks, a small but very annoying group."
2596345,bigwalleye1,2014-03-26 06:26:00,2632,"Ahhh. The FIBS. I have heard tell of them from my northern Wisconsin bretheren, where they apparently have a strong foothold. Rumors exist of a Chicago mafioso connection, and I have heard tell of several folks that have been volunteered to be used as worm food or swum with the fishes. Perhaps for a monthly ""donation"", I could be involved in the formation and leadership of a northern Minnesota group, subject to the bylaws of the FIBS. I'd propose a cross-border alliance, due to the large number of members being transported over state lines."
2596441,wallydave,2014-03-26 06:46:00,2151,This brings new meaning to sleeping with the fish!
