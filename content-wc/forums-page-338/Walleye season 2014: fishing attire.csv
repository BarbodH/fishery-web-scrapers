We are still working on settling the trust for the older friend who passed away over a year ago I took care of. You can't imagine the hassle involved in giving money away! She left a very substantial scholarship fund to the local high school and they are about to loss it because they continue to fail to get us the proper documentation that the trust specifically requires. This has been a time blackhole for me.Besides that, I can't keep up with you guys. Thanks anyway.Pooch"
2581521,Skywagon,2014-03-22 08:24:00,1106,"On Thursday I was fortunate enough to be invited along to the photo shoot for the spring debut of the 2014 walleye season fishing attire. This clothing will be sold in selected shops in north/west Ontario and available in the big three Sporting goods stores in the US. I knew most of you have already been stocking up with items for your trip north this summer, this clothing is certainly something you may want to add to your list. Included is a sneak peek preview of what many will be wearing this season in north/west Ontario.https://www.dropbox.com/s/p6qi0al472su3d6/IMG_3879.JPG"
2581569,WalleyeMatt,2014-03-22 08:46:00,93,I just showed this to my wife and she insisted that I place an order now. It will be the same way in Wisconsin. Not sure if this is a good thing. Either one.
2581585,speckmaster,2014-03-22 08:47:00,17,Good one!
2581697,octanehi5,2014-03-22 09:25:00,1104,"Perfect picture,Late ice out ya think?"
2582585,wallydave,2014-03-22 14:11:00,2151,"Very nice! Talk about all season wear. My only question is , due to the amount of hitec material, and the exchange rate, should I wait until I cross the border to buy!?"
2583305,Pooch,2014-03-22 17:55:00,4619,"Skywagon......You know you guys are ""not right"" don't you?So, is Enrique or Berry the bad influence on you? Most likely you were normal before you moved up there. Do we need an intervention this summer?Pooch"
2583633,Guest,2014-03-22 19:57:00,0,You failed to mention you had a few pieces from the women's clothing line also (hat & necklace) Ha
2583689,HeHooksHimself,2014-03-22 20:06:00,725,"I like it, but I am not sure it comes in my size. Also, you should have included a PFD."
2591049,Terwalleye,2014-03-24 19:23:00,166,I thought for sure it was gonna be one of these.....http://www.cafepress.com/mf/35524942...ctId=406986431
2595337,Skywagon,2014-03-25 19:19:00,1106,"We just got back from two days at an outpost cabin, windy both days, I'll guarantee you everyone had their shirt on this week. We had to break up a hard crust of snow, then dig down about a foot to frozen slush in order to have enough auger to barely get through. Pooch, I have a friend talking about coming up next week, he will be driving right through BMI... That would be a golden opportunity for you to get some experience hard water fishing, as from what I have read, this will apparently be the year of the endless winter, you will be ice fishing in July anyway, might as well get some pointers now."
