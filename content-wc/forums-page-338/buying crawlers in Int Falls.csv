2551185,Carnhzkr,2014-03-13 14:09:00,964,"I used to get my flats of crawlers at the tackle store that's right behind the Holiday gas station, but I've learned that it's actually cheaper to buy them in Ft Francis. I always assumed they'd cost more in Canada, but it's cheaper since they don't have to put them in bedding. I got mine at The Great Bear last year."
