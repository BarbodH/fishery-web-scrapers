2534969,labsrus,2014-03-09 10:55:00,557,"We were on a week long trip at a remote flyin lake during this week We expected a check flight on Wednesday that would bring in 2 more guys who only wnat to go for 1/2 week due to vacations schedules When the outfitter flew in a Tues early afternoon, we thougth it was strange since we did not expect him until Wednesday morning. My buddy and myself looked at eah other and said somethings up, hope all is fine with our friends and families back home. When the pilot got out and started telling us what happened, it was hard to understand. Ath that time ther were lots of rumors flying around, 20 or so planes missing. He told us he was grounded and coule only fly for special reasons, did not know if the other 2 in our party got across into Cananda or not. He had a couple cases of beer and some ice and asked if we wanted it. If he was still grounded at the end of the week, head to the end of the lake and take the rought logging raod out to the main road and he would flyin later to pick up our gear. After that we stuck close to the cabin on Wednesday and noticed the lack of planes flying over. He was able to fly in on Thursday with the 2 guys who brought along some further information and newspapers. Now at least we take in a Sat Phone for communication if needed."

The Chinese assault at Tiananmen Square and the death of Ayatollah Khomeini. It was Khomeini's death that I didn't learn of for about a year when some news mentioned the LATE Ayatollah Khomeini, and I went Huh, really?"
2595393,walleyeduran,2014-03-25 19:24:00,286,"OJ bronco chase for me. Came out of the boundary waters off the gun flint trail and turned the radio on, ""in my bronco"", and took about 10 min. to put the story together. Used to look up to the juice when I was a kid."
2510930,Carnhzkr,2014-03-03 10:10:00,964,"SinOrSwim - that's the scenario I was always curious about. I wondered how they got people back from fly-in outposts with all flights being grounded. It makes sense, the way you describe it. I also understand your point about not quite grasping the enormity of what had happened until seeing it for yourself. Like most people, I was at work. People talked about it during the day, but we had meetings and carried on as usual. It wasn't until I came home and turned on CNN that it really hit me."
2511194,Ralfeee,2014-03-03 12:02:00,33,We were coming back and couldn't figure out what the radio was talking about in Minneapolis and the bridge. It took a couple of hours to figure out the I-35W bridge had collapsed days earlier.
2511362,SinOrSwim,2014-03-03 12:40:00,1528,"Yes, and if memory serves we didn't find out the buildings collapsed or know they were jets that flew into them. We heard plane and figured something smaller. I also can't remember the exact details but I'm pretty sure he told us when he got off the plane and onto the dock he was there to pick us up and then told us it was under.......what law, section and reasoning. Then followed with why the plane was empty and we needed to load our gear quickly. I just remember it being very matter of fact and not the normal.........hey boys how was the fishing eh.........that usually happened."

2516698,northerneyes,2014-03-04 16:57:00,72,"We went on a fly-in moose hunt in 2001 after 9/11 had happened. Crossed the border at Pigeon River. Most thorough checking out we ever had on the trip in. The Canadian border guys said the US had been saying a lot of things about lax security at the border and claiming some of the terrorist came from Canada so they sort of took it out on US travelers. When we flew back to base camp after the hunt, the outfitter told us the US had gone to war with Afganistan."

2510098,Carnhzkr,2014-03-03 07:38:00,964,"I was camping at the Caribou Falls dam north of Minaki about 10 years ago. When we got back to our camper at the end of the day, there was a note taped to the door letting us know that my grandmother (my dad's mother), had died. It wasn't totally unexpected, but we were hoping not to get this news while we were in Canada. My brother called Halley's Lodge, which is about 2 miles up the road from where we were camped, and asked if they could relay the message to us. I always thought that was nice of Halley's to make the effort and go out of their way to let us know, especially since I'm sure they look down on people like us that camp for free, rather than giving them our business. We took off for home that night, cutting our trip short by a couple of days."

2510314,SinOrSwim,2014-03-03 08:16:00,1528,"We were on a fly-in when 9-11 happened. We have been up there when Princess Dianna died, we were on a fly-in when Katrina happened. Came back over the border and gas was up to like $3.40/gallon or something crazy when it was in the mid 2's before.But, we were also there when 9-11 happened. We had a sat phone with us. We had been drinking quite a bit on Tuesday afternoon/evening when we called my wife (girlfriend at the time). We called to find out what the score of the Vikings game was on Monday night. We got ahold of her but kept losing the signal before any words could be communicated. Finally heard her talk and all she kept saying was planes crashed into the twin towers. Then, we would lose the signal. It would take about 10 minutes before we could get another signal. She tried to tell us but to be perfectly honest we didn't understand. It's just not something that makes sense. I remember standing on the dock and people were asking what the score of the game was. I said I don't know? All she kept saying was planes crashed into the twin towers. We were all very confused.We had an Indian stop by the cabin on Wednesday and tell us about planes and buildings but again, we just couldn't comprehend what was going on. Told us all planes were grounded. We were like...........what???? Again, didn't understand what was going on? To be honest we really didn't think he was telling/giving us accurate information. Lost in translation so to speakScheduled to fly out Thursday morning. Plane showed up Thursday on time as usual and we thought.........see, it's fine. BUT, it WAS different. We always helped unload things for winter projects like wood for a dock, gas, mattresses or anything else they planned on doing in the fall.The pilot got out of the plane, told us to bring gear to dock but ONLY our gear. No trash etc. The plane was EMPTY. He didn't talk much at all. Just said he was here to pick us up, said something about it being a humanitarian issue and to get things loaded. It was very matter of fact. We loaded all our stuff. He told us about planes hitting the world trade centers, they collapsed, the United States is at war. We were basically standing there with our mouths open STILL not really understanding. He said he came in empty because he was here to pick us up and ONLY pick us up under some sort of Humanitarian policy clause and then gave some numbers of the policy/law. All planes bascially in the northern hemisphere had been grounded. Again, we didn't grasp this. Said they weren't sure if they could even come get us but there is a policy that they can't leave somebody in the bush for any reason. But, they could not haul supplies or make any other stops. Orders to fly to our lake, load us up and get back. So, there we were flying back to Sioux Lookout when he asks us how it feels to basically be the only non-military people flying in an airplane in North America. We got back to Sioux Lookout and our outfitter sort of told us what had happened. To be honest, we still didn't really grasp this.We got back to the border and there was a pretty long line. Trucks inspected with mirrors underneath etc. Was very very matter of fact. We got across the border and grabbed some newspapers and at that moment FINALLY saw some pictures of what was happening. Absolutely STUNNED. I got home late that night. My wife had the forethought the morning of 9-11 to put an empty tape in a couple VCR's and record NBC and CNN on that morning. Watching this footage was absolutely unbelievable.So, we were at Gull Lake when it happened on Tuesday. Didn't really know what happened until we got back on Thursday. Still sort of weird to think back and know that all air traffic was haulted but we were still able to be picked up. It is weird when people tell you exactly where they were and what they were doing when it happened. I say I was fishing and had no idea. They don't really believe you could NOT have known. But, we didn't. Even when we did we didn't realize they were JETS and not just some small plane."
2510714,jambi,2014-03-03 09:22:00,504,"My Dad and I were at Young's on LOTW during this week. We left out after breakfast like any other Tuesday morning. When we came into camp for lunch Carol was there on the dock to meet us instead of one of the dock hands. She was almost in tears as she told us the news. It was a little different how she described ""a tragedy happened in your country and your president in on the news"". Made me feel a little homesick and out of touch. We just sat in the boat stunned as so many thoughts went thru our heads. We went up to the lodge and watched the news for a couple hours. Carol had said my Mom had called to check in on us so we used the radio phone and called her. We decided to finish out the week fishing knowing the border may be a little congested. We crossed in on Saturday morning after waiting around an hour. Most thorough check we've endured in 14 trips across."

After driving back, I stopped at my favorite bar near the house and asked the guy sitting next to me what happened with the Pistons or Red Wings, can't remember which. When you go fishing ""Prime Time"" it is usually June and the playoffs for both sports. So in June you miss 2 or 3 games for either sport and I had not known what happened. ."

2508298,Carnhzkr,2014-03-02 16:04:00,964,"The lines getting back into the US were long, but we certainly expected them to be. When we were up there, I kept thinking how strange it would have been if we'd have been there on the actual day it happened - if we'd have come out of the bush completely unaware until we turned on the radio for some tunes, only to find out about the tragedy as we were heading toward the border. If I remember right, I think the border was closed for a day or two after it happened. I was hoping this thread might bring out a story or two about someone that was up there out or contact when it happened. There must be a lot of interesting tales from fisherman that were unaware until their drive home."

What is the biggest national news you missed while in the bush? Mine is, Michael Jackson dying, the Red Wings losing the Stanley Cup to the New Jersey Devils in 4 straight and Justin Verlander throwing a no hitter against the Brewers. Lets hear yours?"

We had been planning to leave on a trip sometime around the 12th or 13th, can't remember for sure. At first, I thought the trip was off, but we went anyway. It was an eerie feeling. We had limited radio reception, so couldn't really keep up on the news until the trip home. There were very few planes in the air, but when i'd see a jet contrail, I remember thinking ""I wonder if WW III is beginning""."
