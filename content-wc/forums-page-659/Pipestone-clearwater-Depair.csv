I was wondering how the fishing is in the smaller lakes in this chain...Despair, Footprint and Jackfish? Is the water clear or stained, and are there walleyes in these smaller lakes, or smally's? Looking for a shorter drive second trip in the beginning of August. Usually go to Lac Seul."

564669,Guest,2007-04-20 05:41:00,0,Walleyes and Smallmouth
564675,Guest,2007-04-20 12:05:00,0,"Those lakes have pretty decent walleye fishing and good smallmouth. The walleye fishing won't be what you are used to at Lac Seul, but then it is hard to come close to the best drive to walleye fishery in Ontario. As long as you don't expect the same walleye fishing you will be happy."
564687,Guest,2007-04-20 21:35:00,0,Where can I find more information and location about these lakes?
564689,Guest,2007-04-20 22:27:00,0,You can get info from a few different places on this chain.www.happylandingfishing.comwww.gnofishing.comwww.rosscamp.cawww.littlemooselodge.com Go to the websites and then call them for more info. Good luck

Many years ago, before conservation, a lot of big walleye were removed and made a tight bite for a few years. The lake holds good lakers, muskie, northern, smallies, and walleye. Very clean, clear, deep lake which makes all fish very good to eat. I just checked on ice out date yesterday and the locals say they expect it to be out this Sunday or Monday. I hope this is true because we are headed up for trout next Wednesday. Anybody know otherwise, I would like to hear about it. Guide7"
