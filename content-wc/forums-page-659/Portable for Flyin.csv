564750,Dacotah Eye,2007-04-26 12:22:00,2722,I have one on my 14 foot boat and I like it. From what I have read it is probably one of the best buys out there. :cheers:

564755,FuzzyIL,2007-04-26 15:06:00,906,see if you can find a Vexilar Boundary Waters - very nice unit - lite and compact - good marks and archs - runs on AA batts - check it out I've had all kinds and really like this one.
