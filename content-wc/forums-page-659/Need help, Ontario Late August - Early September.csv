We had a trip planned the second week of June to a lake (lakes, if you count the portage options) in the area just west of Lac Des Mille Lacs in Ontario. Events have conspired against us, and we are having to cancel that trip, but have an opportunity to rescedule later in the summer, either during the latter part of August or the early part of September. I am completely unfamiliar with fishing that time of year up north, and was wondering if anyone had any experiences/advice as to what to expect, which portion of that rough time block might be better (earlier versus later). We're willing to put up with less favorable weather if it means potentially better fishing. The lakes we'll be fishing are relatively small, shallow (~30-40 ft max) and stained, if that is a consideration, and we are mainly interested in walleye and pike. Thanks for any help, I've got to get the reservations redone in the next day or two."

The walleye bit well, and were in 10-20 feet of water, off points on rocky bottom, or suspended over deeper water. There were absolutely NO BUGS....the weather was such that it got warm during the day, but cool for the evening and morning fishing. Especially in the mornings, there was dense fog on the water till the sun burnt it off. Spectacular clear skys at night around the fire for star gazing...it just seemed clearer at that time than it ever is in the summer. Bring your woolies, it could get chilly. We found the fish to be aggresive and hungry on those weeks. Hope you have the same luck we did."

Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"

I find that the fishing is every bit as good as June except that the fish tend to run a little larger. Almost zero other fisherman on the lakes, and with the leaves just turning and crisp mornings it can be just wonderful. Go for September, you may find yourself making it a regular trip.. Fish will be deeper but will tend to be bunched up. Good luck GF"

No bugs, less crowded and good fishing. One year in the end of september winter come early(high of 36f and 30-40 mph wind for 3 days so now i go the first or second week and have found the weather to be optimal.. go for it MacDonald"
564712,Guest,2007-04-24 08:05:00,0,"I echo the other posts about Sept. fishing - ALL GOOD. We fly-in north of Red Lake after Labor Day and love it. Stout fish in various depths, 7' to 30'. The yellow leaves on the birch trees, cool mornings and no bugs make for an enjoyable week."
564715,Paul H,2007-04-24 13:23:00,1232,"I've almost always went med to late Aug. Various reasons, but I take the wife, can't stand black flys, and even then - it gets cold sometimes at night. Upside - I've NEVER hurt for fish, weedbeds are in good shape, fish weeds, points, and rocks. I'm sure it's not the best - but, for me, it's the best overall experience. I've been there early for the opener - still ice at waterfalls.... NE Ontario - near Timmins...."
564718,bharder,2007-04-24 14:42:00,5,"Same thing happened to our group last year, we went every year the 1st week of June last year our first childs due date was the last week of May so we went in Sept. instead. I would not go again in the fall, fishing just is not the same as in the spring. If I wanted to have to work for every fish I caught I would stay home, not pay $$$ to go north. just my two cents"
564728,Guest,2007-04-25 11:09:00,0,"Thanks guys, for all the responses. Wouldn't you know, life threw me another curve...and now we're back to the second week of June. I'm kinda glad it worked out that way because like September, I've never fished that early in the season up there, and was looking forward to it. But from now on I'll give serious consideration to taking a post-Labor Day trip sometime soon. Just being able to sit outside without getting mummified by the bugs would be great. Thanks again!"
