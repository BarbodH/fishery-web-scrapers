564678,Guest,2007-04-20 13:56:00,0,Chartreuse 1/4 ounce jig with chartreuse Gulp minnow-grub. Put 1/4 of a crawler on it for a little extra smell. Best bait ever!!!!! Go to Four Seasons and ask for their most popular spinners and buy a sheet or two of those.
564680,Mark R,2007-04-20 14:22:00,1538,Call Gary at Evergreen about a week before you go and he'll tell what they are biting on. Gary also sells spinners
564686,Guest,2007-04-20 21:30:00,0,What do you mean by Four Seasons. I am looking for a certain spinner. A Colorado blade that is hammered nickel and a slight chartreuse tint.
564691,Guest,2007-04-21 06:11:00,0,"Four Seasons Bait shop...right around the corner from Evergreen. The Chrartreuse / hammered nickle is their number 1 seller. Get it with the chartreuse and also just hammered nickle with no color. I know other people like to tie their own, but these run about $.90 each and they work great."
564694,Guest,2007-04-21 20:12:00,0,"You have been given the best advice by the previous messages. I believe late June, early July, the spinners will be the presentation preferred. The guide will also know exactly whats working. YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A BLAST! Get ready to catch fish Canadian style. You will be catching and releasing pigs and hogs everyday. You will also need sunscreen so you don't catch too many rays, and you will need the juice of your choice to catch the buzz. Just be easy on the juice if your on the water. Have a safe trip!"
564705,2 DOGS,2007-04-23 17:21:00,361,You've received the best advice and that is call Gary or Patty at Evergreen just before going up there. Evergreen normally has everything you'll need whether it's jigs or spinners. They also have all kinds of minnows and leeches. I'd check in with them before I went to a baitshop. p.s. I spend the entire summer up there (9) and jigs were the number 1 performer all last summer for my boat. In previous years spinners were the #1 item choice around the 1st of July. The preferred colors seem to change every year. I seem to collect those that were hot LAST year.
