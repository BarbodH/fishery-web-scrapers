564793,bay of quinte,2007-04-28 07:16:00,2,"thanks for the welcome folks and ya 10-12 lbers are very common up here,glad you had good trips,the last time i had the boat in was jan/12/o7 after that the ice fishing started which i love just as much,only missed 5 days last year and darn near cried over each one of the LMAO,our spring season starts on may 5/07 and ends on feb 28/08,theres still lots of walleye spawning in the rivers so it should be another great year. any-one planing a trip would be better off coming up the week after the opener,two reasons for this 1-a lot less boats,2-and the best one the walleye bite better(have recovered from the stress of spawning and now want to feed)don't get me wrong they bite well the first week to but boat launches/boat traffic is nuts. taker easy and may all your trips be safe ones.
