564665,Guest,2007-04-19 22:29:00,0,When do you expect ice out on Gull Rock? Also we always fish Gull Rock early on but have changed our dates to late August and early September. Can we expect to have the great fishing then that we experienced in the early season? I appreciate your candid answers............
