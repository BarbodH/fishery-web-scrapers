I was going to buy some last year that had a 15 mile range. I found out you had to purchase an FCC licsense and that it costs about $90.00, and if I read the paperwork correctly, you couldn't use them in Canada anyway. Anyone have any insight to this. Thanks, Joe"

I have been going up to Canada using these radios for the last 5 yrs and have never had a problem. Mine are 5 mile range which we use while hunting, fishing and driving. No one has ever bothered us.

Years ago in Canada you needed to buy a licence for a CB radio, but even that was impossible to enforce so I think our government just gave up tryingto enforce and unless you are transmitting on a regulated frequency ie: emergency freq or am or fm radio band, I don't suspect there is a problem."
564696,Springseeker,2007-04-22 09:18:00,96,You won't have any trouble. Any of the new two ways like Cobra or Sony etc. are perfectly legal. You don't require any license for these or even for VHF anymore. Come on up and have fun!
