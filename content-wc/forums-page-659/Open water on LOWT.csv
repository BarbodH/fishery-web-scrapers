A good rain and a good wind will take er all away. Hurray."
564693,Guest,2007-04-21 18:31:00,0,Hi. I look at the cabin camera everyday and i think you are having an optical dillusion. the ice is about 36 thick last week and only now are the temps above freezing. I would not think there is any water yet unless its on top of the ice. anyone know for sure?
564695,Ia Walihntr,2007-04-21 20:50:00,320,"alanexpup, Todays pictures on the Flagg Island webcam sure make it look like the ice is starting to get pretty dark. I realize that it was raining there today but you don't get that much water on top of the ice unless you have a downpour. Check again and let me know what you think. Marv"
564698,Guest,2007-04-22 10:40:00,0,Hi. yes I looked at the other webcams. I guess you are right. Its hard to believe that what it tooks months to buildup could be melted off in a couple of weeks. yes it looks like fishing is just down the calender.
