564594,MoWalleyeguy,2007-04-17 09:28:00,409,I agree that 2003 was a low water year on LOTW but last year wasnt far behind. Fishing BOTH years was outstanding though. Will be interesting to see what this year brings but right now I am preparing for something similar to 2006.
564596,Guest,2007-04-17 10:06:00,0,Another 2006 in 2007 would be Outstanding. 2006 was the best year I have had on Lac Seul in the last 20.
564620,Guest,2007-04-17 19:57:00,0,"Too costly to mark hazards that can damage lower units and possibly cost a life or too?? How much is that worth? I can say that in the last 10+ years my insurance company and myself have donated a SIZEABLE amount to Red Lake Marina not to mention the repair shop close to my home. Bet the insurance companies might consider a generious amount to mark said hazards if asked! Pretty sad when the ""main channel"" bouy's are missing and are not replaced. Shanty Narrows east ate many lower units a few years back when the green marker was gone. Know of 5 boats that had damage in just 2 weeks. I heard that if was more along the lines that nobody want to ""assume"" responsibility if something does happen. Go figure...."
564627,Guest,2007-04-18 10:04:00,0,I know everbody on here raves about this lake but is it necessary to travel 25-50 miles out to catch fish? I would think you would be able to catch fish within 5 or 10 miles of your camp. I would rethink my strategy if I had to travel that far everyday or I would change resorts and get closer to fishing. Scott
564628,Guest,2007-04-18 10:57:00,0,"Scott: At the resort I go to on LS, I catch 90% of my fish within 5 miles of the resort and many of those are within 2 miles. Some days we travel further (say 10 miles one way) but only because we desire a change of scenary. Can't speak for any other resort as this is the only one I have stayed at on LS, but the one we go to is on top of great fishing. IA Walleye"
564702,Guest,2007-04-23 10:08:00,0,"I agree with 2 dogs the channel markers need to be there more than ever this year do to the low water level. We as boaters need for the camp owners to keep the markers in place, for there boat safety and owers.Then when you leave the channel the responsability is yours."
564548,Guest,2007-04-16 10:47:00,0,I believe most of the knowledgable people are predicting low water levels. What differences can we expect both hazard wise and fishing. One person told me that hazard wise may be better because you can see what normally is just under the water. Just curious how it will affect the fishing also. Getting anxious to go.

564551,2 DOGS,2007-04-16 13:58:00,361,"Last low water time, I think 5 years ago, the fishing was very good. I saw some rock piles that I had been flying over, still kind of makes my heart stop. Just remember, even with low water there are still some rocks just below the surface. Be careful. I'd like to see the outfitters/resort owners go back to maintaining the channel markers. I know it's a lot of work and time consuming but so is replacing props/lower units on their camp boats. I, for one, didn't appreciate it until they stopped doing it. So thanks guys, if sucking up a little will help."

564553,NWO Fishing Bum,2007-04-16 15:09:00,23,"The last low water year was 2003, and before that was 1999 (interesting, 4-year cycle). Ice is still very thick! The last really late ice-out was 2002, when the ice left the main lake about May 20-22. There has not been a combined really low water and really late ice-out since at least prior to 1999 (and I can't personally speak to specific Lac Seul conditions before that time). Exact water levels and ice-out dates are as yet unconfirmed, but the consensus right now for opener is low water and late ice-out. The combination could prove very interesting for late-May (walleye opener) fishing. I intend to post something in that regard very soon. As far as hazards go, it's just as bad, if not worse for lake veterans. Yes, some reefs just under the surface with normal water level are exposed, but reefs that usually topped out at 7', that people don't pay much attention to, are now the reefs just under the surface! Besides, because LS is a reservoir, the water level fluctuates hugely every year. Guides and well-seasoned anglers know what to watch out for with low or high water. 2 Dogs, marking all the reefs is simply not feasible. You said ""channel markers"", but much of the lake is wide open. Your talking about thousands of reefs, some of which will take a lower unit off and two weeks later be 4' under water and no threat. Very high traffic areas, close to lodges, often do have markers, but what you are proposing is a monumental effort, the cost of which would far outweigh prop repairs or replacement. In fairness however, I'm a guide who knows things very well, and almost all guests are guided at the place I've been associated with, thus on-water experience is immensely increased, and the idiot factor is certainly decreased.

564554,Guest,2007-04-16 15:49:00,0,"2003 was the year that even the MNR lost 3 motors on the opener.Yes it was scarry of what we've boated over all these years, but it is even scarrier of what we will be boting over now. 2003 was one of our best fishing trips ever. Unfortunately it eliminated many of our favorite spots. We average about 50- 100 miles a day round trip on our boats, so I hope 3 props will be enough. What really is going to be interesting is the boat landings."

564562,2 DOGS,2007-04-16 21:52:00,361,"NWO - Sorry that you misunderstood my mention of the ""channel markers"", that's quite a stretch to assume that meant marking all of the reefs in the lake. I acknowledge that you're the professional guide but in the last 9 summers I've spent on the lake all I've ever heard them referred to is ""channel markers"", i.e. the route the ""Patricia"" followed many years ago. Marking a safe route for first-timers and those unfamiliar with the lake to navigate such places as Shanty Narrows, across McKenzie Bay, past Manitoba Point, just to name a few, without the benefit of a guide, is a big plus for the guy up there for a week fishing trip. IMHO it becomes even more important in low water years."
