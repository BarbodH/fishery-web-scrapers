Great looking lure, but nothing. Figured they'd be good for pike and smallies. I was kind of wondering if it was just me."
564802,Guest,2007-04-28 16:53:00,0,"We tore the smallies and pike up last year with chatterbaits. But instead of using the trailer that comes with it, we used 3 or 4"" yellow or chartruse twister tails. The pike would usually tear up a skirt in a couple hours, but if you had the twister tail on the back they still agressively hit. 1/4 and 3/8 oz were all we used. We'd fish the chatterbaits in the early morning and late afternoon by casting them to weed growth or shallow cover, and would work them back to the boat a little higher in the water column. In mid-day, we'd cast them to deeper structure and cover or along weed edges, and pump them (up and down in the water column), back to the boat with a little slower retreive. The nice thing about chatterbaits is you can retreive them about 3 or 4 different ways and they are not really affected by wind or current. So on wind blown shorelines, rockpiles and points when the topwater isn't working, try casting a chatterbait. Chuck"

Give a few hours on different days last year trying it and I find its not a good Largies Lure at the strutures I fished {Or maybe its me:duh: }. I have heard good thing about it for Smaliies though.:-)"
