It is still great fishing, but size has not been the same. I used to expect in 7 days on the water a 20-22 inch bass, a 27-29 inch walleye, and a 40+ pike. It seems like I will get one of those but not all anymore. Just wondering if anyone else is going through a ""down cycle"" or if my fishig ability has slipped. 6 weeks to go and I will be after it again. 2002 was the last year of great fishing and it looks like the conditions could be similar this year. Also, those of you who are lucky enough to fish Rainy more than me, how often do you catch a musky? 2 last year but not very big."

As to northern the lake has prime spawning area for northern huge 40 inch fish. Maybe you are not fishing the right areas or the right bait."
