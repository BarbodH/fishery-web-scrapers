I think the camp is down on Southeast tip of the lake, but am not sure...just deduced that from looking at the access roads. I don't think that the cabins have A/C so fans probably a must!!! I don't know how the lack of rain has affected them....mayabe a spare prop or two!!! From the lack of replies, I am wondering if many people go there!!!"
564708,Guest,2007-04-23 18:57:00,0,"If you are taking your own boat, I would suggest at least a 100' cord for power. If the water is low you must dock at the end of the piers. Best Fishes !"

We have never been to this camp or lake before and therefore any comments from those who have stayed there or fished there would be greatly appreciated. I.E. cabins, things to be sure and bring, where to fish, best bait, quality of fishing, Gripes! etc. Finally, if anyone knows where I can get a topographical map of the lake I would greatly appreciate that. Thanks again, hope to see you on the water!! Hartfish!!"
563900,guidedfishing,2007-03-14 18:02:00,531,"Its been many years since I have fished press, a search will bring back a lot of info on the lake, spent most of my time in the river above press, I still fish the surronding lakes within in 50 miles of press at least 3 times a year for up to a week at a time. Like any canadian lake it can eat a lower unit in a heart beat. You will find that press will give up all the eater size walleyes you care to catch 14 - 16 inches but lackes any substantial number in sizes larger than that. You will have a good time and catch plenty of fish. Press is well known and fished by many folks I sure you can get some current info. just don't expect much in the way of size. It can also be accessed from the North thru Hut lake, and where the old bridge has collapsed many years ago in addition to the one camp on press. good luck GF"
563904,Guest,2007-03-14 20:55:00,0,"I went to Press about 5 years ago. I thought the cabins were very nice, clean and well kept as well as the premiss. Fishing was excellent as far as numbers go. Most walleyes 14"" to 19"" with 1 for the week at 28 1/2"". Northerns small up to 28"". Did pick up some nice smallies at 5+ lbs. Mostly fished the main lake thru the narrows past the river. What I did like, was the lack of other fisherman as we were there in Sept. and most of the cabins had bear, moose and duck hunters. The owners were nice and if you forgot or ran out od anything, they would get it for you by the next day. Mostly fished minnows that you could buy on site. Don't talk to the lady when she is counting your minnows out or you might get 13 for your dozen and she don't like that. All in all, a very nice place to go for a reasonable price. Good luck! Best Fishes ! -ggg2"
563905,drlee,2007-03-14 21:01:00,409,"I have booked two weeks at Press at the end of July/early August. Although I have not fished Press, I did so on the advice of an acquaintance who was the walleye management specialist for the Ontario MNR until he retired. He said that it is one of the best lakes for numbers of walleyes in northern ontario. We did not talk about size in any detail. He is also very impressed with the quality of the camp and the owners...I trust his opinions completely...I know he was there last summer for a couple of days and caught a lot of walleyes and northerns. I will be taking my own boat, so I will be cautious until I learn more about the lake, but I really am not worried. I have fished many lakes in northern ontario and have learned to be careful. Of course, accidents can happen, but common sense prevails. I am aware that the camp owners are fisher-persons, so I am sure you will be able to get good advice on current patterns. The camp is a good hour, or more, from Ignace, which has all the services you will need, but is obviously a ways to drive. Just a few hours ago, I was in Milwaukee for the sports show and bought a map of Press Lake for $9.95 that is quite good. You can find it at www.canadamapsales.com or call 1-877-627-7226. Another version, which is probably just as good but not as ""pretty"" is available for $3.95 at [email protected] or call 807-221-5599 in Dryden, Ontario. Add $2.25 for shipping and handling. These are ""water resistent"" whereas the more expensive ones are not. So, I bought them both. Go figure. I trust you have looked at the Press Lake website? You can really get a good feel for the camp if you read the narrative written by the co-owner (Barb). She is quite a talented writer and really fun to read. Just to make you jealous, I am recently retired and will spend all of April on the White and Norfork rivers in Arkansas fishing trout; I will be on Pashkokogan near Pickle Lake in June for a week with my oldest son; next is a week on Lac Seul (NW section) in early July with three fishin' buddies; then, Press Lake as mentioned above. I will work a little harder when I spend several days pheasant hunting in South Dakota in October with friends and my best friend, Daisy, my Brittany. Good luck with your fishing trip to Press!"
563917,Guest,2007-03-15 12:06:00,0,"You darned right!! I am jealous as can be about getting to spend that much time doing those things. I do all the same things and pretty much in the same places, but for less amounts of time. Thanks for the info on Press...we are going up as dads and granddads with some kids...so the action is most important! Did make those contacts for maps...thanks again. Hartfish"
564186,Guest,2007-03-29 19:53:00,0,"You will love press lake . I was there 2 years ago and the fishing was great you can see our group on the pictures I think they are on the web site yet, Darwin has a 43 inch northern,bob mras has two northerns on one bait,Shane Seigel has a 25 inch walleye. The people who run the camp are tops in my book. They will help you all they can and the cabins are great. Can't say enough about the camp. Would like to go back some day.Plenty of walleyes and northerns in other lakes you can get to from camp with a little work and a boat ride.Most walleyes are caught trolling crank baits, but you can jig them also. We went in september and had a blast."
564197,Guest,2007-03-31 08:16:00,0,Thanks for the info....we are counting the days to June 9!!!
564199,Guest,2007-03-31 11:24:00,0,"Darwin, you said the cabins are great....were they relatively cool at night or should we bring some fans? Any other ""don't forgets"" would be helpfull. What about the lake, full of hazards or pretty straight forward? How far did you have to travel to get to the Honey holes??"
564232,BD,2007-04-02 10:44:00,739,"Hey Triple g! Been a long time. > I met ggg at Press 6 1/2 years ago, just days after 9-11. Talk about a not so fun border crossing. I had my wife along on that trip although I have fished Press several times with the guys. Using my 14' Lund was a little scary for her on a lake that size. We stayed closer to the camp than ggg most of the time. At the end of the bay where the camp is located we ""killed"" (figure of speech actually did CPR except for eaters) a couple of monster snot rockets along with a good number of smaller snakes and eyes up to 18"". The better walleye fishing at the time was along some islands north of the big island. That's where ggg picked up the 8 1/2 pounder. The day he picked that one up he was complaining he couldn't catch any eaters, they were all over 19 inches. > You will find the cabins clean and well kept. We never needed a fan as the weather wasn't hot enough to need one. In fact we built a fire several nights to keep warm. Take along drinking water, your grocery needs, decent toilet paper, and a bottle of the ""Doctor"" if that suits you. For fising gear you will need jigs and slip bobbers, some shallow and medium depth plugs (Mirrolures, Rapalas & Thundersticks), a large net and a good minnow bucket. Trolling worked the best in the bay by the resort and past the red rock to the west of the mouth of that bay. Orange was the best color for snakes and perch or trout for eyes. The Mirrolures and Thundersticks worked better for eyes and the Rapalas worked best for the snakes. The patterns change sometimes from week to week. Gerry will give you the up to the minute fishing info you will need."
564612,Guest,2007-04-17 14:51:00,0,"We are going to be at Press Lake in July, could someone tell me where on the lake the Resort is located. Also any must take items."
