564733,ratherbefishin,2007-04-25 17:49:00,11,"Guys, Thanks for all your input. My group got together this past weekend and decided on Camps Ronoda on Lake Remigny, Quebec. We will be going on the last week of August. I'll let you know how it turns out. Thanks again, RBF"
564735,Mondo_OH,2007-04-25 20:25:00,58,why were those 3 the only choices?
564544,ratherbefishin,2007-04-16 08:47:00,11,"Guys, I just got through with that year long all-inclusive trip in that garden spot called Iraq. Its good to be back in Cleveland. Now that I'm home and I've been served with the 'honey-do-list', I figured that I should get down to business. I have narrowed my choices down to 3 camps: Camps Ronoda (Lake Remigny), Taggart Bay Lodge (lake Kipawa), and The Walleye Point (south point Gouin Reservoir). Any info that you guys could provide would be helpful. And if you have information on other camps in Quebec let me know. I go fishing every year with a group of 8 & we are looking for an American plan camp( 2-3 meals a day, boat motor, gas, bait, etc.). It would have to cost between $800 and $1000. I know its late in the season to book but any info that you guys could provide would be helpful. And if you have information on other camps in Quebec let me know. Thanks Again, ratherbefishin'"
564600,Seanik,2007-04-17 10:36:00,218,"Welcome Back Ratherbefishin, I did a year deployment but mine was over 40 years ago and yet after reading your post a lot of the old memories came back. WELCOME HOME Our group has been to Walleye Point 3 out of the last 4 years, mid July to early August. We go at this time to escape the bugs. The camp is well run by Roger and Pauline, the cabins are large and comfortable, indoor comodes and a great central shower. We do a modified American plan with supper only. Walleyes are plentiful but on the small side, average 14"" to 18"" but 50 a day is common. The camp boats are 16' wooden flat bottom Vercheres(made in Montreal)stable and handle the reservoir well with 9.9hp motors.Walleye Point is somewhat isolated from the other outfitters on the Gouin Reservor not much boat traffic other than camp boats. Great Walleye fishing is usually less than 15 mins. away from camp, not necessary to travel long distances. Pike are caught while walleye fishing, not many but good size. The best bait for us has been leeches and crawlers. We buy leeches by the lb at a bait shop in Gateneau, it's on the way there. We leave Erie Pa on a Friday and overnight in Mt Laurier, Quebec and drive the 180 miles of gravel road to WP Saturday mprning. Part of our group is from Erie Pa and part from Zanesville, Ohio so we are practically neighbors. Good luck on the camp selection, if you need additional information e-mail me [email protected]"

564608,Guest,2007-04-17 13:20:00,0,"Welcome home! MY $0.02 for what it's worth is to head for the Gouin. I went there with my sons 2 years ago and am returning this summer. We have been to numerous places (though none of the ones you mention) and our experience is that the further north you go....the more remote....the harder to get to...the better. Yes, we have always had fun trips. But the fly-ins we did and the trip to the Gouin stand out. Great fishing, spectacular scenery, and isolation. That combo works for us....truely, we would rather not see or deal with another human being for our week in paradise...just the eagles and moose and an occasional bear to share space with. Have a great trip...you certainly have earned it....and thanks from all of us fishermen, we appreciate what you have done on our behalf."
564610,Guest,2007-04-17 14:14:00,0,"Hey ratherbefishin', Check out Happy Landing Lodge (www.happylandingfishing.com) They have special rates for Soldiers that have been over in Iraq. Good Luck"
564611,ratherbefishin,2007-04-17 14:21:00,11,"Guys, Thank you for your kind words and and your helpful information. I'm sure it will help me and the guys decide where to go. Baxter- what camps have you stayed at on Gouin Reservoir? I would like to check them out also. Thanks Again RBF"
564613,Guest,2007-04-17 15:15:00,0,"I appreciate the effort and sacrifice of all troops and I am glad you are home safe and sound with family. I live in the Philly suburbs and for the last 10+ years I have gone with a group of to Lake O'Sullivan and stayed at Lake O'Sullivan Lodge north of Maniwaki, St Remous and 77 miles down the Clova Road. The cost sounds right for you guys but we normally just eat breakfast at the Lodge and cook for ourselves. They rent boat and motors, 15 HPs. The cabins are neat, the Lodge is beautiful and the owner is Russell Gagnon. He runs the place with his son Stanley and they do a great job, are honest and sincerely want you to have fun and catch fish, and we always do. The fishing has improved every year. I caught a 34"" walleye in '03 and my buddy caught a fat 28"" but the Lodge has everyone observe a 17"" minimum and many guys limit every day. I'll be up with our group June 9 to 16 and walleye is really hot then, plus O'Sullivan has some big Pike and lakers as well. It's about 11 miles long and boasts plenty of shoreline and structure. We use the pink or pink and whilte jigs, and the usual suspects of stick baits and Rapalas. The brown, orange side and gold bottom 4"" Thunderstick, Rainbow Trout etc knock 'em dead. you can find the Lodge web site by Googling ""Lake O'Sullivan"" Quebec Good luck Andy"
564616,Guest,2007-04-17 17:12:00,0,This Nam Vet is happy you're back safe and wanna fish. Take a look at Domain Poutrincourt it is up in same part of Quebec. It has been a good spot for us Jersey guys when we went. Three times so far. As close to a fly in camp as you can get without flying in. Good walleye fishing. Whatever you decide make sure you take care of that honey-do list. ha ha.
564623,Guest,2007-04-18 06:09:00,0,We stayed at a remote camp many miles from the base camp....the outfitter is Pourvoirie Martin Outfitters. If you do a search on this site ( use Baxter for the search) you can read my fishing report from our Gouin trip as well as some others from other outfitters we have visited. Hope you have a ball on your trip.
