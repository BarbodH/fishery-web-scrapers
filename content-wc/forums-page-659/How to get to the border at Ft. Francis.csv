They deliver parties directly to the camps for a fee based on distance and the size of the van needed to carry the group. Fees are very fair considering a rental car may be parked for the length of your stay. Some rentals are base rates and some are based on miles driven. You have to check with each company. As a commercial vehicle, the van needing to get to the airport MAY have the ability to use the commercial lane to cross back into the US. Hope this helps as there ARE alternatives. Bob Hunger"

North West Airline appeares to be the only means to go from Minneapollis to International Falls. They have doubled the rates and have reduced the number of flights. How are the rest of you getting there? We are about to give up going to Canada Fishing. Thanks, Pathfinder"

How about flights into Hibbing, MN? Rent a car, 2 hour drive to the Falls. By the way, it's Rainy Lake :) Good luck and happy travels!"
564738,Skylane,2007-04-26 06:58:00,101,"This is a tough part of the world to get to for a descent fare. I would also look at the possibility of flying into Winnepeg and renting a car back to your destination. Probably no farther than driving from St. Paul. The fare from our area to Winnipeg is cheaper than to St.Paul even though the flying distance is greater. Northwest seems to work well. Let us know what you find out, as I am interested in more inexpensive alternatives to getting people to our place in the Dryden area."

564748,Guest,2007-04-26 10:14:00,0,"We are coming from Florida, Georgia, Ohio and Michigan."
564749,Guest,2007-04-26 11:29:00,0,"As a camp owner in NW Ontario, we are having a real problem with the airlines coming into I. Falls. Just got off the phone with a party of 12 coming to us. They have chosen to fly into Duluth, MN and are getting van service from there direct to our camp. They are saving about $400.00 each on this arrangement. Now that Air-Link is NW Airlines they have us all over a barrel. With other arrangerments available, why use I.Falls airport. Maybe I.Falls will wise up. Hope this helps!!"

564772,Guest,2007-04-27 07:56:00,0,"What exactly do you mean by ""Van Service""? Is it a taxi service that will take us accross the boarder or Van rental. Still trying to salvage our yearly trip to Rainy Lake. Thanks, Pathfinder"
