564493,Guest,2007-04-14 07:49:00,0,I'm flying out of Red Lake and will be there a extra day. Is there a guide service in town? I don't want to miss a day of fishing. My outfitter is taking a look into it. Thanks for any help.

564531,Tonyo,2007-04-15 21:27:00,212,"You may want to check with this guide too. He was a former lodge owner and knows the area well. His email is [email protected]. Bud is his name and a very nice guy, ran a great camp on gullrock. Tony"
564533,Guest,2007-04-15 22:01:00,0,"Tonyo, I heard Bud was going to start guiding this summer. Good for him he'll finally get to do some fishn."
564534,grt1,2007-04-15 22:02:00,259,"If you can't reach either Bud (i tried the page listed above and it doesn't work) or Ian, give me a call. 807-727-3971 I'll see what I can do for you. Bud used to own 5 lakes lodge and was a sometime visitor to this site under the name of budfll. Ian won the Red Lake fall Classic last year and has guided on Red Lake for many years. I used to fish Red Lake when I lived there but since I moved down to Gullrock, I only fish it during the Red Lake fall classic tournament. But the spots I usually fish, produce any time of the year."
