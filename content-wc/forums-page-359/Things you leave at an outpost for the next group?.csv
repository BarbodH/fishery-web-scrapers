2036018,Camoclad,2013-08-17 09:22:00,628,"We went in mid-June so there was quite a bit of stuff left in the cabin when we got there. Probably the most appreciated items were a nice stack of dry kindling and salted minnows in the freezer, we ended up having a tough week and the (formerly) live bait helped tremendously over the artificial. On the check flight the camp owner asked us to box up all the canned goods and such that had been left and bring back with us. Probably could have gotten by without bringing any groceries or supplies on our trip with the quantities of stuff that had accumulated over the season up to that point! We didn't ""inherit"" any fridge items except a few beers. I think most folks are probably genuine in thinking the unused items may be helpful if needed for groups after them and are not trying to avoid cleaning up or hauling them back. We left paper goods and a dry stack of kindling for the next group. We also cleaned up around the fish cleaning station and the dock before we left as it had been left looking like a war zone of empty minnow buckets, fuel cans, gut buckets and homemade boat anchors. This has been a fun thread to read, thanks to the op."
2036258,dollure,2013-08-17 11:19:00,71,"I know what should not be left behind and that is a messy cabin. We always swept it out and did the dishes. Finding a clean cabin on arrival is nice. Last time to Canada, a drive in, we left coffee frozen meat and pizza, sugar, plastic bags, ect. The camp workers were told take what you want. They appreciated that. Plus the tip. Roy"
2036466,Aaron-IN,2013-08-17 13:45:00,500,We left a 1/2 gallon of moonshine this year.
2036698,kzoofisher,2013-08-17 16:57:00,5144,I'm thinking that if the cabin isn't clean when I arrive then the camp workers don't deserve a tip. If the previos occupants were pigs I should never know. Access to the lake and a clean cabin that has everything in good working order are what I pay for. Tips are based on how well you do your basic job and they grow fast with me if you go above and beyond. If all the camp can tell me when I arrive is that they heard some people were getting them then the tip is going to be minimal. Tell me something specific and accurate and the tip will very nice. I will also be sure to pass on what worked for me so the canp can keep new arrivals up to date.
2036778,kona77,2013-08-17 17:27:00,236,"As several folks have said a clean cabin is our first priority. If a group is coming in right behind us and have had their beer flown in, then we always have a case put away in the fridge so it is nice and cold when they arrive.. I can tell you these two things are always appreciated by the next group !!!Paper products and unused oil are always left by our group..On most trips we get to spend time with the group coming in to go over our week of fishing and share information."
2040985,Guest,2013-08-19 15:45:00,0,Can you get an STD from a pee tube? Does using the same pee tube make you blood brothers of sort?
2041289,v-bay gord,2013-08-19 18:26:00,3168,Only if you use it to hold the tartar sauce for the fish fry.......
2042962,Pikeslayer8,2013-08-20 13:05:00,1460,"I used to be of the persuasion that on my fly-in trips that I will blissfully trust that the outfitter will have everything that we need or we will just make do. But when ya find a home away from home, yes, upgrades are required. The first thing I left in camp was one of those Tupperware marinators in the early 90's when my wife was a Tupperware dealer. It lasted in camp for about 10 years when it just wasn't there one trip, but I replaced it again for the next trip and it's been in camp for about 5 or 6 years. About 10 years ago, I left this awful gaudy fish apron with slippers that my wife gave me for Christmas. Sorry Honey, you'll never guess what I forgot to pack outta fishcamp. It wasn't there the following trip. This year I decided to lug in this giant plastic tub as last year we discovered that the green pasta bowl had a hole burned in the bottom so I didn't' want to chance it not being replaced for this year. Sure enough, it wasn't and the bowl was extremely handy in camp. Next year I plan on upgrading cookie sheets as the one in fish camp is a mess. All grooved, beat up and gross. I believe that you have to trust that the fellas that fish your lake and stay in your cabin are classy enough to respect the camp's inventory."
2046201,farmnfish,2013-08-21 12:29:00,130,One year my brother took his 7 year old daughter on a flyin with us. She had a great time and chronicled her trip with numerous crayon drawings. She taped the drawings on the wall as she made them. When we flew out she just left them on the wall. We went back to the same lake and cabin about four years later and the pictures she had drawn were still hanging there.
2049266,Jig Man,2013-08-22 11:33:00,95,Back in the late 90's before they had Indoor Plumbing it was always a full outhouse!
2034330,unclepaully,2013-08-16 14:38:00,112,"We usually leave paper, matches, marked maps, and any unopened can goods. Last year my dad insisted on leaving his ""pee jar"". An empty milk jug with the top cut off, so he doesn't have to go outside 5 times in one night. He really felt like if the next group had someone over 60 they would really appreciate it. He left a note with it expaining what it was and that he had washed it out for their use. I just rolled my eyes and walked away."
2034354,adempsey,2013-08-16 14:41:00,963,"Lol, not sure what to think about that. I'd probably laugh at the note and use it. Although, all those ""boat bailers"" are probably used for the same thing. My last few trips weren't outpost camps, but I always leave behind the maps I make marked with spots where we caught fish.Usually if there is any left over pop or beer we leave that as well. TP and Paper towels I'd leave as well.Worms I will give to the camp owner. I wouldn't leave those at an outpost unless I knew someone else was coming in the day we were leaving.Everything else goes, which usually isn't very much."
2034362,Freytown,2013-08-16 14:43:00,770,The one thing I always leave is a clean cabin. It don't take long to spruce up before you leave. I have been thanked by the camp owners more than once for this gesture....and it don't cost you a dime.
2034578,2746,2013-08-16 15:36:00,3206,Aren't dads great! You gotta love em.
2034650,SinOrSwim,2013-08-16 16:02:00,1528,"I lol'd at this!!!! The note is what really brought it home. LOLOLAnd, yes we use the boat bailers to pee in and dump overboard. I wonder how many people have pee'd in those things?? lol One year we had a milk jug but the lid leaked. LOL Had to go fast and dump. Way too windy to pee over the side. That is probably the thing people most appreciate is the boat bailers."
2034890,fourt2,2013-08-16 17:48:00,45,"Mosquito Coils. Always bring 3 boxes with (30 coils), and end up using maybe 8. Leave 'em for the next group, in case they forgot theirs.Why bring 3 boxes when we only need 1? Because we always bring 3 boxes, duh. That's probably a different thread...-42"
2034962,oleJoe,2013-08-16 18:17:00,114,We always come in early the last night of a fly in and clean and mop the cabin. We usually only leave paper products and soap and a deck of card and marked maps. We take everything we need for a week and use 99% of it the rest goes out with us. I really don't want to find anything in the fridge or food wise when I open the door. Like I say we bring enough for a week and don't want to clean up the place when we get there. I really do appreciate walking into a clean cabin and thank you who leave it that way.
2035122,mudpusher,2013-08-16 19:10:00,248,"We don't have a boat baler - we have a pee tube. a piece of 2"" PVC pipe about three feet long. Drill a hole in it about an inch down the pipe to tie a rope on. Make the rope long enough to hold it over the side of the boat while trolling, to wash it out. Doesn't matter how windy it is."
2035210,2746,2013-08-16 19:50:00,3206,"As well as dangerous. What's the old saying.....""90 percent of the bodies found on the bottom of the lake had their zipper down"""
2035914,pikeman14,2013-08-17 08:28:00,144,"Left over pee jar! LOL That's funny!This years trip had a cabinet full of salt and pepper, and other leftover staples which we added to or burned.I left a marked map for the next group. I hope one day someone will return the favor."
2032794,MrSimon,2013-08-16 06:33:00,922,"There have been lots of times we settle into a cabin and say, ""man, that was really nice of them to leave that for us."" Sometimes its little things like a roll of paper towels, some dish soap, or maybe some leftover food. Anyway .... what are some things you have either left for the next group, or things they have left for you? In a perfect world, outfitters would have on-line lists of what cabins have or don't have, and groups could update and revise the list as needed."
2032866,octanehi5,2013-08-16 06:58:00,1104,"I have found that most good outfitters, have a caretaker that cleans the cabins between ,customers. so no one gets someone elses food, that you do not know how old it is.When leaving a camp I always make up a box,of left over supplies ,food,ext. It works out as a little care package for the guy. Paper stays at camp.The things I leave in camp,Alot of less fish to catch."
2032874,MorganMan,2013-08-16 06:58:00,341,"Agreed, some things left behind can come in handy. We have also been greeted by things left in the refrigerator or freezer which we didn't use because we didn't need them. The pilot would walk through the cabin to check things out and let us know not to leave anything in the refrigerator/freezer. Though it can be seen as thoughtful gesture, it can also cause problems if the propane runs out or the unit quits working for some reason, creating a whole new set of problems for someone to clean up....sometimes a week or two later! Keep it non-perishable was our motto. How many times have you seen those little disposable sets (or 6) of salt and pepper? We have actually needed to use the dish soap left at the cabin."
2032890,new hips,2013-08-16 07:04:00,498,"One year, people left about 6 dozens frozen shinners, they worked really well.Also.......the cabin had a diary for fishing, so you had a lot of good info from prior weeks, locations, colors,best lures, tecniques also a marked map, really gets you off to a fast start. Usually we leave the cooking oil, toliet paper, paper towels.......usually not a lot left as my list is pretty complete."
2032906,nitrodude,2013-08-16 07:09:00,60,"We fly in and out, so we leave a good bit for the next group and have received similar on our arrival: All unopened canned goods - we don't even switch the labels around. All unopened drinks - soda, juice, beer. (Not so much of the last one.) Salt & Pepper and spices - garlic powder, Montreal steak seasoning, Texas Pete hot sauce, etc. Paper goods - paper towels, TP, wet naps, plates, cups, coffee filters, deck of cards (we start with a new deck each year) Potatoes & Onions in skins All unopened boxed goods - Shore Lunch, pancake mix, mac & cheese, oatmeal packs, tea, etc. Eggs in the shell and any unopened packaged meats (bacon, salami, etc.) Dish soap & pot scrubbers I honestly think the next group could supply their own walleye filets and make it a week on our leftover goods. We could probably cull some stuff, but I've always felt it's better to have and not need than to need and not have. Plus, we've benefitted from others grace as many of the items we leave have been forgotten by us at one time or another when we came only to have them left by our previous residents. It's our way of paying it forward."
2032954,dog2,2013-08-16 07:26:00,198,If it is opened @ the end of the week it's trash .Unopened items that we dont want to cart home are boxed are given to the operator to donate to a food bank or church charity.Everyone wins. paper stays at camp.
2033034,SinOrSwim,2013-08-16 07:50:00,1528,I would never eat something left in the frig. yuck. I was always amazed at how many porn magazines were left. LOL Are people sneaking to the outhouse to rub one out?
2033658,kzoofisher,2013-08-16 10:45:00,5144,"Generally salt, pepper and soap. Snack foods go with us to keep the kids from turning feral. Also usually leave thousands of fish that haven't been disturbed by any competent fisherman."
2033722,Pooch,2013-08-16 10:59:00,4619,"By leaving opened unused food in a fridge ""for the next Group"" you are only making them clean out your garbage. Few in their right mind would eat others opened jelly, lunch meat, etc.. Been on too many trips where we had to clean out other peoples ""left overs"" before we could put our fresh food in the fridge. Much of it was gross.Unopened and factory sealed food is another story. Paper stays and is appreciated. Especially on a fly in. Healthy left over bait is sometimes appreciated.Trust me... you're rarely doing anyone a favor by leaving food in the fridge when leaving camp. Giving left overs to the camp caretaker isn't really kind. Look in their cabin sometime. Usually they have shelves upon shelves of left over supplies.Pooch"
2034058,jambi,2013-08-16 13:01:00,504,"Group before us left a bag of salted minnows. I had never used before and now take them every year. Everything else, Exactly what Pooch said:"
