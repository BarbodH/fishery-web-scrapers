I haven't ever fished Lac Seul and was wondering if anyone had suggestions for a first timer? Has any GPS chip companies updated Lac Seul within the last couple years?"
2056378,Bitinlight,2013-08-25 11:53:00,95,"If you know anything about walleye fishing, you will be able to catch walleyes just by fishing obvious looking spots(points, islands, rocks, etc.) and playing the wind. If you are staying at Lac Seul Outposts right at Chamberlain Narrows, they will put you on good spots to get you started, and then you will find many others on your own. It is a great area to fish with lots of options."

I am not sure if there are any new chips, but if you do not have a chip with Lac Seul, it would be a good idea. It is a big lake, the topo info will be helpful and many of the rock hazards will be marked, but not all.Since it's your first time on the lake, I would recommend a ""good"" guide for the first day or two, it can be money well spent. The fish are definitely there, but a guide can help you find what habitat/depth/ to look for them at the time and what bait is working. You will have driven too far, not to maximize fishing success. If you are a well seasoned walleye fisherman on shield lakes, than that advice may not apply too you.If you are a jig fisherman, then lots of jigs, you will lose a bunch in the rocks and bite offs, the fish will probably be in deeper water when you are there, so make sure a lot of the jigs you buy are heavy enough (at least 3/8 ounce). Also, always wise to have an extra spool of line.Come prepared for any sort of weather. I have seen anything from a freeze the first of September, to 90 degree weather (today it is closer to 90). Bring a good rain suit, if will also serve as a wind breaker, if needed.You'll have a wonderful time on a fabulous lake."
