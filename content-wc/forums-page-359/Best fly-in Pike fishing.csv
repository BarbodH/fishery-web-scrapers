2047321,GatorGuy,2013-08-21 18:36:00,15,2009 WOW! Think musky.... I pretty much put on a Phantom and if that doesn't work I put on a different color Phantom
1109998,steve03,2009-06-01 20:58:00,22,"I think Nungesser has tremendous pike fishing. Lots of 40"" fish caught, chance at a 50"". Catch them off the dock at Nungesser Lake Lodge as well."
1110002,GNO,2009-06-01 21:00:00,153,What type of trip are you looking for and what is your budget per man? That would help to give you the best pike fishing in price range and type of trip you are wanting.

1110532,Guest,2009-06-03 07:48:00,0,Some of the best pike fishing is in those one day fly in lakes without any cabins or lodges on them.......sounds like you are looking for a lake with accomidations though.
1120764,5 of Diamonds,2009-07-13 21:53:00,151,"Overlooked is Lake Evans in Quebec. I had everyone covered when we arrived Sat 27 Jun. I caught 2 - 43"" and 1 - 40"" w/ in the first hour of fishing before I lost my new Pelican spoon. Five of Diamonds, the large Johnson Silver Minnow and the standard silver Williams Wabler is about all you'll need for trophy Pike. We had 3 - 45"" fish that week w/ one being a Silver Pike! Between the 4 of us, we caught 27 fish over 40"". Check out bushlandadventures.com. Shoot me a PM if you want any additional reference information. Best."
1121232,5richards,2009-07-15 17:12:00,131,Hey Golden Eagle I missed seeing you -- we had a great time at little Vermilion with Brett -- My group of four caught over 30 northerns larger than 40 inches -- I am not real handy at putting photo's on this site but would like to share our photo's with you and see your's Lassh -- If you want a reasonable place to go with a great owner give me a holler [email protected] and I'll give you the info --- I live in Pa and have no connection with the camp other than two great years of fishing -- probably shouldn't share but I have to because it is a well conserved resource and the owner deserves kudo's!!!!!!!!
1121274,Golden Eagle,2009-07-15 19:58:00,2642,"5Richards, too bad we missed seeing your group. I went in May 16 and out May 30. 10 of us the first week and 11 the second week. Fishing was very good. Fishing conditions were not so great. Lots of snow, frozen water lines and worst of all some big, changing winds. Of course we'll be there for the 2010 opener. I've been hitting the lake beginning in 1972 and make it 2, 3, 4 and even 5 weeks a year. It's hard to give Little Vermilion a better recommendation that that. First year I fished it the price was $99 per person for 7 days and 7 nights, but we had to fly in our own motor or rent one in camp for $42 a week. I believe pike fishing has improved over the years. A great deal for a modest price."

1122256,pike50plus,2009-07-19 20:25:00,584,"I sent you a pm 5 of D, 3 favorites have been Great Bear, ganglers Stevens-Nickin, and Engler off Athabasca. At GB we did it all, 23 lb Char on the Tree river, 35ld laker, no big deal others were getting 40's and 50's, and grayling in big numbers, including a 20"". St S-N we caught Pike, walleye, trout and grayling, good numbers and size for all 4, most fun was jigging for them in an 80' hole getting 40 in 4 hrs each. At Engler we caught many big pike and really nice walleye, easy lake to fish too, 2 hugh weed beds and a river flowing in right by camp. Jim is going back up to Evans with some fish and wildlife people this week, fyi."
1107894,lassh,2009-05-25 12:12:00,553,Some of my friends from Iowa are interested in a great fly-in pike fishing trip. Most of the places I have been have fair to good pike fishing but I was looking for recommendations for excellent trophy pike fishing. Could anyone recommend a consistent trophy pike lake?
1107905,Wall-i-Lama,2009-05-25 13:34:00,1524,Way North Lodge. Fly out from red lake. Very nice Northern!http://www.waynorthlodge.com/
1107912,Whopper,2009-05-25 14:15:00,340,Sportsmans Lodge out of Red Lake Affordable and good pike fishing
1107916,LeeMB,2009-05-25 14:35:00,83,"I would look in northern Manitoba or NE Sask. Some of the lodges and outposts there catch literally thousands of Pike over 40"" in a year."

If you want more info about APISKO lake send me a pm and I will get you in contact with the owners. It is a fly in outpost in central MB. They will fly you out in brand new amphib Cessna Caravans. You will be the only ones on the lake. A bit cheaper than the rest, but not ""blinged up"" like the rest."
