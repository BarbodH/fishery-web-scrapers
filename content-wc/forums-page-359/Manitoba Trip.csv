From the stories they have told me and the pictures I have seen, I really want to do this trip. They would drive as far as they could (within 100 yds) and then pack the boat and gear in. They are not completly **** bent on this lake but each year they fished that lake and well they really want to go back to it. I am trying to find out since the road has been tore out if you can get back there with quads and possibly pull a boat back there with the quad either on trailer or maybe dragging it with some type of skid? They would camp on a island and I think that is important in lake choice because we would be camping. We had coffee yesterday morning and by looking a google maps and talking they are looking to see if we can drive close enough to Amy lake and maybe fish it or slip into Wabishkok. I am looking for you guys to give me some advice and info. This sounds like a awesome adventure that I have to do and while these guys keep telling me stories I find it hard not to image the trip at all hours of the day."
1543671,zeebee,2013-02-26 14:10:00,1144,These guys offer a fly-in service ...they likely have a boat cache. Scroll down to the bottom of the following weblink where you will find reference to Wabishkok:http://www.mts.net/~jglad/Rates.htmPerhaps they will share some info as to access (if any) if you give em a call. In any event they will fly the 4 of you for about $150 each round trip plus whatever they will charge you for the boats.

Hard headed old men are just that so for now I need to figure out if its possible. I have not convinced them to another lake especially since iv never been thereSent from my HTC Sensation 4G using Tapatalk 2"
