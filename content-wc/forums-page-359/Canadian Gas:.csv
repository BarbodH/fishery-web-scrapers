2041025,houndog,2013-08-19 16:02:00,365,"Interesting thread! I agree that when across the border we should support our hosts and if the extra tax paying for our ability to get to where we are going is too much we should stay home.Gas and liquor are more expensive in Illinois than in Iowa for example. The income tax in Illinois is less than Iowa. I don't haul gas to Illinois and a drink is good in either state... Nuff said....I have personal experience in the ""border wars"" that have and continue to be instigated by both governments and states for that matter. Government embargoes and excise taxes are like kindergartners picking up their ball and going home. My philosophy is to never stoop to the low ignorant levels of government but to take the high road and support the local economy wherever it may be. I want the Canadians to welcome fishermen from the states. If we don't do our share the locals will have to assume a greater share. Their ability to sustain businesses and livelihoods would require them to pass the cost on to the consumer or we could lose the opportunity to fish that we value so much.houndog""A mans got to know his limitations."""
2041137,Gregking,2013-08-19 16:42:00,2658,"Let us take a moment and review what was just posted. I bring gas across the boarder because i stimulate my local business 2 miles away. I also buy my fuel at the same truck stop and drive all over South Dakota and fill right back up at my truck stop. So should I have bought fuel in whatever town I fished, hunted, raced or worked in? Something else I don't understand is if gas cans are so terrible why do they still make them? I have ran high octane gas cans around since 1989 and never have I ever had any type of an issue. FYI for all those ""boat owners"", the dock boys spill more gas in the lake by using the pump because it spits back at you than I ever have with a gas can. I wonder how many people on here actually own a boat or filled it all the way up. This reminds me of another read where everyone checks their frame of their trailer and by doing so the frame will never break no matter how ruff the road is. I guess I just don't understand why the high horse sometimes."
2041313,Shellback,2013-08-19 18:42:00,8083,"I don't bring cans of gas to Canada, but do fuel my boat up at the dock with gas bought in town. No need to spill gas with this gadget. My Canadian buddy turned me on to this. I keep it on my boat in a freezer bag.http://www.shammysolutions.com/site/...product/100-23"

2042258,2746,2013-08-20 08:35:00,3206,Canadian gas? Is that what I get after eating Canadian perogies with onions?
2042530,northernbite,2013-08-20 10:02:00,1186,"Well here is how I see it. Gas is high all over, one state is higher than another. When you go to Canada it will be higher. The farther north the higher it gets.Long story short, it's the cost of doing business, so pay and go fishing. Paul"
2048674,octanehi5,2013-08-22 08:37:00,1104,"Canadian gas is measured in liters, 4 liters is a bit more than a gallon. One liter is .264 of a gallon times 4 is 1.056 gal. I have also noticed that there price on gas is high its less likely to go up and down as quickly as here in the USA .25 to .30 cent swings at a time. I have noticed the last 5yrs going to the great north that gas is the same price.Hawling gas in another country is a dangerous game. we fill up at the last station in the states, then buy gas when we need it. buy enough to get back to the states then fill up here.Just imagine the cost of the gas you burn on a flyin trip once your in the boat."
2035082,fishincrazy,2013-08-16 18:55:00,1282,Wow just paid $5.12 for a gallon of gas in NE Ontario.( was $1.347 a liter) The guy at the gas station thought what we pay at home was great $3i74 a gallon. I have to agree.I am so glad gas is included in our camp cost. It would make me crazy to see that cost every day.FC
2035394,Gregking,2013-08-16 21:33:00,2658,I hauled in 10 extra gallons of fuel and 40 extra gas. Made it 9 days without filling up. I did add 5 gal of fuel to be on the safe side. Saved $140 over having to buy camp gas and that gave me an extra day of fishing
2036538,JAMOKIN,2013-08-17 14:27:00,48,When you come to Canada I sugest filling up before crossing border and bring as many jerry cans as possible.The price is crazy considering we are an oil exporting nation.Also price of smokes and liquor are also way more expensive up North.
2039217,Skywagon,2013-08-19 06:23:00,1106,"All my hobbies require engines, combine that with the driving distance to town, gas (at $1.29 a liter) is by far my highest yearly living expense, enough to choke a horse. When weighing out that high cost against what I get in return for those dollars spend, I only have to look out the window to know it is a small price to pay. I suspect in reality, most of you crossing the border feel the same way on your visit here."

2039321,Pooch,2013-08-19 07:06:00,4619,"If you and I are using Canadian roads to get where we want to go, why should we not support the efforts to maintain those highways by buying at least part of the fuel to maintain the same highways?Carrying a bunch of cans of flammable liquids in the boat or back of a vehicle makes no sense to me at all. After spending nearly forty years in the fire service and handling more burnt and or dead bodies than I care to remember, it just defies logic to expose yourself and others to a terrible fate should you be involved in an accident.Please fellows, just think about the risk/reward thing for a moment when carrying extra fuel rather than just ponying up more money for the trip.If I've stepped on anyone's toes I don't apologize for feeling so strongly. What you do is your business and no skin off my butt, unless it puts others in danger.Why do you think most camps don't allow fuel to be brought into camp?Sorry for the morning rant, but this is real life stuff for myself and others.Pooch"

2040321,v-bay gord,2013-08-19 12:30:00,3168,x 3 Pooch and Skywagon. I will also add the sight of someone filling their boat at the dock with a plastic can and spilling much of it into the lake leaves me questioning the value of this approach.
2040441,johnboat,2013-08-19 13:17:00,2014,"I was at LOTW last month, only 40 minutes over the border. Took 2 families with kids. Gas bill for the week was just a touch under $700.00 for the week. I have a 50 gallon portable tank with a crank that you could pump right into the boat, no spills. Sure worth considering. Would I fill 10 - 5 gallon cans and put them in the back of the truck?........No. To me, from a safety stand point, filling up the portable at the border is not much different than me filling up my 52 gallon tank that is in my boat. Whether I bring the portable or not next year?? Can't say I will but it is sure something to think about. I would think its not a big deal to the camp owners if you bring it in. (as long as you are smart about it) Seems to me that gas is more of a service and a pain in the rear than a money maker. But I've been wrong before."
