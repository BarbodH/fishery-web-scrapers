2058514,DavKin,2013-08-26 09:56:00,104,"Just curious if anyone has tried what Al & Jim Lindner call moping? On Saturday, Angling Edge show had them fishing 5 inch Trigger X minnow with a Moon eye jig 4-5 feet off the bottom in deep water , approx. 25'. No jigging, just holding it steady to catch big walleye. I will give it a try when I am at an outpost north of Red Lake in early Sept."

2058914,Fisherman Ted,2013-08-26 11:33:00,461,"We had Al up here at Hawk Lake last month. Man, does he have a lot of energy. I can only hope I am that active when I am his age. Him, Dan Sura and Jeremy Smith were all very friendly and super guys. I learned a lot from them and had many laughs along the way. In terms of numbers, whenever I watch a fishing show I assume that the host was fishing a lake for multiple days in order to pull together 22 minutes of footage. I look more for learning a new technique and or presentation than numbers of fish. But you are right. If would be good to know if it took 5 days to show the 5-6 fish you see coming into the boat.

2059650,Mike Kansas,2013-08-26 14:04:00,1463,"I use a rig like this often. Like it best in deep water and have had better luck jigging it aggressivly rather than just letting it be. Both styles work just depends on the day. Have had most success on transisitioned Eyes over humps or mid lake islands. Like to use gold jig head and paddletail colors black/white, blue/white,orange/green, char/white or pink tail. Always glue tail to jig. Have had best luck with minnow or crawler on it. Used these on recent trip to Black Bear Lodge and we caught the three biggest Walleye in the camp with these. Mike Kansas"
2059794,MrSimon,2013-08-26 14:57:00,922,I'd love to hear more about your experience with those guys. How many boats did they bring ... how many people ... big camera crew .... Its great to get inside information on what they guys are like!
2059986,Fisherman Ted,2013-08-26 15:57:00,461,"They showed up with 2 boats and one camera guy. Dan Sura who often times hosts the show had one boat (I spent a day with him) and all he did was scout the lake, looking for humps, reefs, good drop-offs etc. During that time Al worked his other boat and did the same thing. Sometime spending hours on different spots, returning to them and looking for trends.Of course I gave them detailed maps, showed them our best spots etc. They took that and went out and mapped everything with their GPS and got the lay of the land. You would have thought they were scientists. Incredible to watch. And their boats had more electronics than an aircraft carrier. HUGE screens, 2-3 per boat, 360 degree down imaging, anchor poles, enough rods to equip a lodge, and tackle galore. I also got to fish with Al a few times and had a blast. Guy can talk fishing and has so many stories. Also fun to watch him work structure.Once they got the lay of the land they (and I) then went fishing which was pretty cool (for me anyway). I fished with Dan and our boat fished with Al off and on for an afternoon. I actually caught a 31.5 when we were apart from Al and his camera guy. So we put it in the live-well and raced over to show Al thinking for sure that this fish was something that Al would love to have on camera. We got it on film and I'm thinking ""cool, that will work for the show and has to be a good fish for Al"". Al quietly said take a look at this as he proceeded to show me footage of what had to be a 35 inch walleye he had just caught. He had a small smile on his face and I would learn later it was one of the largest fish he has ever caught. So, that was kind of funny especially seeing him pretty stoked.We then fished the rest of the evening and between me, Al and Jeremy I think we netted nine 8 pound fish, 7 30 inches or larger, my 31.5 and his 35+. All in one afternoon and evening.At dinner Al and Dan were signing autographs with the guests, interviewing many on camera, and telling stories at the bar. Dan is a very gentle man. Jeremy witty and sharp. And I swear all Al wants to do is fish and make the best show he can. He talked fishing all night long, showed our fishermen different lures he likes and got a kick out of seeing old copies of In-Fisherman magazine we had him sign.All in all it was a great trip (just 2 days). We hope to see him again next year as he asked if he could come back with some buddies. I can only imagine seeing him fish for fun would be even more interesting.Fisherman Ted"
