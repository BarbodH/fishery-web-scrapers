Only caught 900 in a week this yr. (Personal best) Jig with Night crawler,salted minnow, Gulp alive, trigger X. Knowing your lake, and hot spots for the bite,no matter what the wind direction is helps greatly.There is no better way to catch large numbers of Walleye,Just have the beer batter ready with hot peanut oil."

1512024,grizzley,2012-12-10 19:25:00,2518,"I've read several posts on here about guys using salted minnows on the jigs. I never tried that; always used live minnows. Seems like a good idea, and can have them with at all times, without the hassle of keeping live bait.Are they just as productive?"
1512077,zeebee,2012-12-10 22:23:00,1144,"Use to take them on fly-ins as they were frozen, east to transport and kept well (ie in the freezer). By the end of the day you would be covered in saline and the inevitable cuts in your hands would sting. Other than that they work well but then again most anything will on a good fly-in. Some regions you cant take in live minnows for obvious reasons so heres an alternative. Oh yeah, bring along a good terry cloth towel to wipe your hands on and bring lots of the minnows as they are a bit mushy when they thaw and dont hold up well. Overall I prefer crawlers."
1512164,Golden Eagle,2012-12-11 08:31:00,2642,"Borax is a good preservative for salted minnows. I go with 1/3 borax, 2/3 salt and enough garlic powder to provide a little stink.I get my minnows from a wholesaler, usually 3 pounds at a time."
1512185,Lovetofish,2012-12-11 09:15:00,458,"That's the mix I use except the garlic part. After a day in the brine I dump them in the sink and give them a shake to get some of the brine/salt off. Also, I don't freeze them, just keep them cool. They will last a long time in the fridge and they won't be mushy."
1512189,Golden Eagle,2012-12-11 09:28:00,2642,"Lovetofish, I spread mine on a bath towel in the sun and let them completely dry before bagging about 5 dozen to each small Ziplock bag. Then they go into the freezer until I take them on an out of the U.S. experience."
1512191,johnboat,2012-12-11 09:30:00,2014,"Start with a 3/8ths till you get the feel of it. As far as sitting in one place for to long, I use the 20 minute rule. If there is no reason to stay longer, move to another spot."

2051826,Gregking,2013-08-23 08:31:00,2658,"I flip jigs with whatever is working, worms, leeches,minnow usually in the spring to shore. I use a st croix elite, the original green one. Vertical jigging went well this summer with my new croix rage. I like both my set ups"
2051890,Mike Kansas,2013-08-23 08:39:00,1463,"Jigging for me is the most effective way to catch Walleye and the most fun and challenging. I think your choice of equipment is key in jigging success. I have a Loomis 6-6 med rod with soft tip.The rod is the top end of the Loomis line. It is without a doubt the most sensitive rod I have ever used. I have several other top end brands but the GLX Loomis is my go to. I switched to 8lb fluro a few years back and the combo of the line and Loomis is very sensitive. On the days when the bite is light I really feel that I can do as well catching fish as the days when the bite is aggressive. In fact I love the soft bite days. When I feel that ""Tick"" that happens when the Eyes first mouth the jig I drop the rod tip and than lift slowly...if it's heavy take the tip of the rod to high noon and hit it hard. There are many types of successful jigging techniques. One that I like when back trolling is dragging a stand up jig as long as you are on sandy or smooth bottom. I will drag the jig for a few feet always keeping in touch with the bottom and me feeling in touch with the jig. Than stop and be vertical with a little lift or two or a shake. Than repeat Another is deep vertical jigging over humps or structure in 20' plus water with a 3"" plastic paddle tail minnow and either a minnow or crawler as bait. I like to be aggressive with this presentation and pop or jerk the jig vertically in order to create the illusion of a wounded baitfish. Sorry, I got to rambling a bit there but when you love to jig for Walleye as much as I do it's easy to get carried away. Mike Kansas"
1499621,Babamel2,2012-10-29 13:38:00,414,"According to Mike Kansas' post, it seems like the most popular presentation for fishing walleye is a Jig and Minnow. What methods do you use? jigging, slip bobber, trolling, or other, and what structure/depth do you find most effective for your method?"
1499652,1860Angler,2012-10-29 14:48:00,2642,"Usually vertical jigging, trolling or drifting it all depends on the lake and time of year. Depth also varies anywhere from 4 feet to 50 feet deep."

1499672,mrwalleye5,2012-10-29 15:58:00,1922,Aggressive jigging out on Lake Winnipeg this time of the year in 12-15 feet of water. Double hook a salted minnow and also stick a piece of rubber on the hook to keep the minnow on and raise the rod 4 to 5 feet and let it drop as fast as a 1/4 oz jig and minnow can. Keep doing this until you get hit. Sometimes will do this ten times in a row before getting hit.

1505624,wallydave,2012-11-19 14:56:00,2151,"For jig and minnow fishing I like fishing water with some current flowing, fishing where a river enters into a lake. The second best jig and minnow spot is points where the wind is hitting the shore, jigging the edge of the water thats getting muddied by the wave action."
1505764,MrSimon,2012-11-20 06:41:00,922,"Admittedly, I'm not much of a jig fisherman. When I try it, I get frustrated. If the water isn't calm, I have trouble ""feeling"" the jig. If its windy, I have a horrible time keeping the boat where it needs to be. I also have a hard time sitting in one spot fishing for a long time. If the action isn't hot and heavy, I start second guessing the spot and wondering what its like ""just over there"". When I switch to trolling cranks for casting spoons I usually say, ""Ahhhh, now this is more like it."" I recognize that jig fishing is a GREAT method for catching walleye ..... what advice would you all give me to get better at it?"
1505772,wallydave,2012-11-20 07:11:00,2151,"I guess the first question would be what rod are you using for jigging? What type of line and whats the weight of your jigs? I jig with an ultralite, a lite and a medium-lite fast tip rods. I'm switching to braid, a better feel, plus less chance of pike breaking your line. In current I like a 1/4 or 3/8 oz jig. Thats my take on jigging, maybe some others will have some other methods and ideas!"
