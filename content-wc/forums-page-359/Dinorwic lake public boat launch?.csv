2029314,Guest,2013-08-14 17:55:00,0,Hi there. Does anyone know if there is a public boat launch on Dinorwic Lake? Looking to go there but need a spot to get the boat in. Thanks
2034314,Guest,2013-08-16 14:36:00,0,So there is no public launch on this lake? I'm talking about Dinorwic lake just east of Dryden.

2036090,Guest,2013-08-17 10:14:00,0,Thanks for that. What would be the closest free/public launch on Wabigoon to Dinorwic lk? Thanks
2036282,115 optimax,2013-08-17 11:39:00,650,"Nugget Creek in the town of Wabigoon .Its on the right side of the Hwy about 15 seconds past the Wabigoon Tavern.Its a good launch,just follow the creek and go under the rail tracks then you are on Wabigoon lake.From there Dinorwic is about 15 min away.If you got Hot Maps Canada you are good to go.Stay in the middle of the lake,it's the safest way(no rocks to Hit)Be careful anyways!Good luck and have fun"

However he runs a Bavarian restaurant on the property that is real good food. If your going to eat anyway you may work out a deal. The Lodge is in the channel between Dinorwic and Wabigoon.
