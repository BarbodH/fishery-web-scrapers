I am trying to reverse engineer a fishing log for the Indian Lake Chain (north of Vermillion Bay, east of Dryden) for the last 5 years and match the weather data up with my foggy memory (oh had I just been diligent and kept a log !). I find some data on internet searches but it is fairly scant. Anyone have a good site?Thanks"

Got to main page - select your area then click station select for a preferred station in the area or click on the one already there (it's in a purple/bluish color), Then you have various ways to view - weekly,monthly, etc. I run a personal weather station and report to Wunderground. Although I have more data in my own database, I regularly use this to not only see my own data without going to the wx terminal. Also use it for other areas as you need."
