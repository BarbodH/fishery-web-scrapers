2047954,DWray,2013-08-21 22:13:00,1,"I'm trying to plan a fishing trip in Ontario next summer with my 11yr old son. I've been fortunate to do a few fly-in fishing trips, but this will be my son's first trip to Canada and I would like to keep the cost down for a 6 or 7-day fishing trip. Hopefully cabin, boat & motor for $600 or less. I plan to do a lot of pike fishing for the excitement and some walleye fishing for a few good meals. I haven't fished walleye much so this could be a learning experience for both of us. I've found a few lodges on Cedar Lake near Perrault Falls that appear to be reasonably priced with supposedly excellent walleye, pike, musky, sm bass, and perch. The lake layout appears to give you a lot of options should the weather/wind come up and it appears nice size...not too small and not too big. Anyone have opinion on Cedar Lake near Perrault Falls, ON? If you recommend it, do you have recommendation on which lodge? I'm leaning toward Keystone Lodge as it is the only one on 'east' Cedar Lake and it appears there are 5 on 'west' Cedar Lake with 1 in the middle. Is the fishing better on the 'west' vs. 'east'? Are there other lakes you would recommend over Cedar Lake? Thanks in advance for your advice."

Cedar is great for walleye, musky, smallies, and even crappie can be targeted. From my research, most lodges on Cedar have some sort of price break for children, but check to see how many adults have to be present to get that discount."

Memories will be made that will last a lifetime.Your post made me think about taking my 12 year old nephew with us for two vacations in Ontario. I learned a few lessons from these experiences. The first lesson was that some young adults do not have the attention span and patience that some older folks have. In other words, I had to keep mixing it up to keep him engaged. His patience was quickly exhausted by vertical jigging for walleyes. He seemed to prefer ""action"" fishing involving casting and motion. Casting for northerns or perch were good ways to mix things up. The boat rides to the next spot seemed to help him considerably.Another lesson is that my nephew did not seem to relish being uncomfortable. By this I mean getting up early several days in a row or fishing in the rain. Who can blame him for this? Yet another related lesson is the importance of taking time off from the boat. We enjoyed throwing the football or shooting a game of billiards during the mid-day.We stayed at Manotak Lodge on Perrault Lake, which is connected to Cedar Lake. The lodge is clearly oriented towards families and offers a father/son or daughter package. They have housekeeping and American plans. The lake has many of the attributes that you reported for Cedar Lake. Theyy are worth a look.A key thing in your report is that you are considering starting a tradition with your son/daughter. Lasting memories will be made. I hope the above is helpful."
2049154,fourt2,2013-08-22 11:17:00,45,"DW, I started the tradition with my son 4 years ago when he was 8. We went to Black Bear Lodge on Red Lake in Ontario. Could not be happier with the place! I have no affiliation with BBL, other than as an extremely satisfied customer, so I couldn't tell you what 2014 rates will be...but 2012 and 2013 were $590 for adults and $190 for my 11-year old. All meals included, boat, motor, gas/oil, etc. Basically, everything except license and bait are included. I can gush about how wonderful our experiences have been...for hours on end, if nobody stops me...so PM if you'd like some info, stories, etc. If you want to check them out, go to www.fishblackbear.com.I think it's fantastic that you're looking to introduce your son to Canada, and start a terrific tradition!-42"

Go to one or two All Canada or other travel shows over the winter. http://www.allcanadashow.com/ Get as much on-line and other information as possible.And (within reason) let him decide. He'll get to know what a budget means and how to critically analyze what an advertisement says or doesn't say.Here's a link to info re the Lake of the Woods area. But there are many other areas and many fine resorts.http://www.lakeofthewoods.com/Enjoy."
2049418,Blades-n-Beads,2013-08-22 12:10:00,484,"LOW1, could have not said it better. Hats off to ya. Parents, uncles , grandparents and even friends taking younger kids on there first fishing trip to a wonderful country should be encouraged to let them be involved in every aspect of planning the trip. That's how memories that will be engraved in there minds forever and they will in time do the same someday to the next generation while we all are choking on dirt with a smile!"
