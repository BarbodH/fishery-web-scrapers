Sold it this spring, as it was just too much of a trip for my elderly parents. And I'm tired of driving the Graham road. This spring we started going to lac des mille lodge, as it is only 8 miles off the highway, and the cabins are better for the 80 year olds. But I digress. I always found the Wawang fall walleyes to be scattered, and deep. Head out to the islands that are to the south, southwest of the lodge. Fish all around the islands in 15-35' of water. Some days you need to be right on the bottom, not 6 inches up, but right on the bottom with a 1/4 ounce jig and a minnow. A crawler on a harness will work also. For fall northern, eater size like 26""ers, locate the weedbeds adjacent to deeper water. The beds will generally be in from 10' or water, extending out to the 16' depths. You want to troll deep diving baits like walleye runners or reef runners, on the deep edge or the weeds, as deep as you can get, hopefully near the bottom. 14-22' down. For bigger northerns, cast or troll buck tails, large spinners, or spoons, near the weeds and around the big rocks. Its a decent lake, lots of fish, but we always did better in spring, or later in September. This spring was just crazy fishing, with the late ice-out and all. There was actually ice on the lake for the opener. Then the fish went wild for about a week. Then the quit biting as they went into spawn mode. Lots and lots of trophies caught that first week. They will tell you where to fish at the lodge. But it is still your job to catch them. And they have a new guide this year, I hear he is good. Good Luck. Any questions, just ask. Oh, and don't let Trish talk your ear off."
