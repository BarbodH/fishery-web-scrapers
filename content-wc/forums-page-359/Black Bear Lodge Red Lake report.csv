2037850,wallydave,2013-08-18 11:35:00,2151,"August 10-16th Mike Kansas fished Red Lake out of Black Bear Lodge. Mike and I had never met in person, I have ordered jigs and lures from his company Sirmanski Jigs in the past. I posted on Share a Seat to put this trip together. Joe Flip signed on early only to have to cancel to take of some personal business, Mike expressed an interest in this trip, so we talked and PMed and made our plans. We met at his sons house in Iowa. After a cup off coffee we loaded up his van and headed North. Mike has fished Canada for over 30 years plus with his lure business he knows more about fishing than any guy I know. Plus he has a million stories so the long drive was not an.issue, hey we are going fishing!! Red Lake was a new lake for both of us, after arriving at camp and the orientation we hit the water. We were fishing out of. 16ft Alumarine with a 15 horse Honda and plastic chairs, Mike brought a Hummingbird unit that marked the depth and ""plenty of fish deep "" a great help on a new lake! We headed for a marked mid-lake hump. Before too long Mike had a 26 in walleye in the boat! We ended up putting around 10 walleyes in the boat the first day. We found the weather to be a challenge sunny warm and little wind. The bite was early and late. By the end of the week we found a couple of spots that held some pretty good numbers of all sizes of walleyes! BBL is an American plan camp. The meals were just good home cooking. To help keep the cost down, $590. a week, everybody pitches in with KP and washing your plates, nothing different than pitching in at housekeeping plan! Checking the oil and hauling gas cans to be filled are ways to keep the price low and its good to know that your boat is safe and in good order, we are there to Fisk after all!! The Lodge is very nice, the cabins are rustic, the foam mattresses were very comfortable. A new lake, less than great walleye weather and we still got on the bite! Over all this trip was great trip! I would like to give this lake and the BBL crew of Jim, and Jillian a try again next year! Any takers?"
2037866,Rich B,2013-08-18 11:46:00,1081,"Dave, Appreciate the report on your week up at Red Lake....Mike is a good guy and I'm sure you both had lot's of laughs on your drive up and back from camp. Did you guys get into any other fish of size during the week (pike/musky/SM Bass) ? Were there many other camp boats in your area of Red Lake, or mainly just boats from BBL ? (I understand Red Lake is a good size body of water). Have any photos you or Mike can share with us of the camp or lake ? thanks, Rich B"
2037882,Larry Mac,2013-08-18 11:55:00,530,"Hi Dave, Welcome Back. It sounds like you guys had a great time. You must have as you are returning next year LOL. Your report on the camp is very helpful for us who are interested in BBL. Like Rich said if you have any pics to share it would be appreciated. Thank you again for sharing. Thank you,Larry Mac"
2038114,wallydave,2013-08-18 14:41:00,2151,"Rich, we saw some locals prefishing for a Walleye tournament other than those boats we only saw the other boats from BBL. There is only one other camp on the west end, we never saw any of their boats. We did catch a few pike while jigging, no muskie one rock bass. Jim told us if we caught any smallies to kill them. I posted some pics in my album. Thanks Dave"

2039929,Mike Kansas,2013-08-19 09:28:00,1463,"Got home late Sunday night from Black Bear with wallydave. Would have been home earlier but two of my great grandchildren had a birthday party at my son's house in Iowa on Sunday. Had a great time fishing with Dave and enjoyed our time together. Dave has fished Canada for about 20 years and was a great boat mate and we had a good time on the water despite the weather not being the best for walleye. The camp was just like I thought it would be. Rustic cabins, but comfortable. food was great and the central lodge was very nice and the owners were very well organized and run a nice operation. Boats and motors were adequate and operated well but they were old and well used. Hard to really tell what normal fishing would be on the lake. We had bluebird sky and flat water all days but one and we all know that is not the best walleye fishing. All of our fish were caught in 20' to 26' of water,which is what you would expect in august. While scouting the lake we found numerous spots that looked like great spring spots. Shallow bars, reefs and flats that were close to deep water and close to bays that you would expect to be spawning areas. I would imagine the post spawn fishing in spring could be very good with all the great structure. Our week of fishing produced about 170 walleye with 70 of those coming the last two days. We had one 27"" and two 26"" eyes and a fair amount in the 18"" to 22"" range with the balance being nice size eaters. We did hook up on two nice Pike while jigging but not as many as I would expect in the deep water with good walleye count. As expected with the weather the walleye bite was not very aggressive. Lots of the bites were just a tick and if you dropped your jig back a little and lifted you could feel a heavy rod and set the hook. While this type of bite and technique is common in Canada it seemed to the rule last week. Thanks to wallydave for the opportunity to join him last week and the great time we had together.

2048418,Mike Kansas,2013-08-22 07:19:00,1463,"wolf1931, I have never stayed at Andra's. We stay at Lac Seul Lodge the third week of the season and fish out of Black Bay and the first week of July at Lost Island Lodge on Lac Seul. We did fish Flat Lake one day but the blue skies and no breeze contributed to a no fish day. We never had one follow or saw any fish. The rest of our time was spent chaseing Walleye on Red Lake. Wallydave is trying to put a trip together for BBL next year, you might want to get with him. Only time I will probably be avaliable would be August or September. Good luck on your Sept trip. Mike Kansas"
