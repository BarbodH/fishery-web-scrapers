1874962,GNO,2013-06-17 17:36:00,153,You will get 1/2 the HST back(6.5%) of the total HST billed on your package price. I do not think you need to itemize the bill. We rebate it back directly for our customers on their bill if the package qualifies.
1878409,new hips,2013-06-18 17:42:00,498,This is what I used......and original invoice with a breakdown of tax paidgot half back in less then a month. Use 13 percent of total bill... that would be your HSTBusiness/individual name Business Number Mailing address City/town/village Province/state postal/zip Country Telephone number Original invoices or receipts showing the GST/HST paid Detailed descriptions of tour package including the number of nights accommodations An eligible tour package that is sold for an all-inclusive price and includes 1. Short term accommodation 2. At least one service (that would be air flight)

2041345,JayM5209,2013-08-19 19:09:00,1050,"Wow!! Me thinks someone at your bank is trying to screw you. My bank has always taken a rebate check as a deposit or cashed it, adjusting only for the exchange rate current that day. I've never had a check drawn on an account of the Government of Canada refused or charged any kind of special fee. Time for a different bank with whom to do your business??"
2041521,v-bay gord,2013-08-19 20:33:00,3168,I've heard of others charged a similar rip off fee. That surprises me since I cash a lot of U.S. checks in Vermilion Bay (credit union) with no issues or higher fees. It must work the same way in the U.S.....unless the bank just wants to rip you off. I would talk to the manager to resolve the issue..... They ultimately want you as a customer.
2041842,onetimedave,2013-08-20 06:17:00,502,Received mine within 6 weeks. It was a check in Canadian funds. US banks love that.
2042554,kzoofisher,2013-08-20 10:11:00,5144,That's what Windsor is for
2044633,JMKC,2013-08-21 05:28:00,238,"Finallly got it cashed, had to deposit it first, different bank also. thanks, JJ"
2055082,fishincrazy,2013-08-24 19:06:00,1282,We have never gotten the HST back. The new owner at the camp we go to just list's the paid week on his invoice but does not include any of the other services included in the cost. What would I have to do to fix this. He is willing to write up whatever I want. Any suggestions?FC
2055586,2746,2013-08-25 04:27:00,3206,"When you deposit a check it is cleared through the federal reserve system in the US and usually only takes a day or so. When a check from another country clears it can take ten to fourteen days. Because of that most banks will not give you immediate credit to your account but a $40 fee is ridiculous! I'd fire tat bank. (Btw, most would not advance cash until it clears unless your a very good customer with significant balances in your account. They don't want to get stuck if for some reason it does not clear)"
1869593,polaris-pete,2013-06-16 08:15:00,343,Just wondering if you can still get any of your HST you may have paid on your trip back from the Canadian Government when you get home.Used to get some of the PST taxes back but not sure now on their policy.Thanks.
1869721,GNO,2013-06-16 08:44:00,153,You can get 1/2 of the HST back if you had a package that qualifies.
1869777,v-bay gord,2013-06-16 08:54:00,3168,"This is the form you need. http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pbg/gf/gst115/gst115-13e.pdf The original invoice needs to indicate that it meets the requirement for the rebate......ie: ""For purposes of a Visitor Rebate this invoice contains eligible accommodations and at least one eligible service (fish cleaning and processing)"" This works for my invoices."
1869841,Muskie Bob,2013-06-16 09:03:00,45,Many of the resorts know how to fill out their receipts to help you qualify for 50% rebate of GST/HST paid.

1870161,new hips,2013-06-16 10:48:00,498,"Half back if you receive 3 services. Very easy, got mine back in a month."
1870265,polaris-pete,2013-06-16 11:43:00,343,Thanks for the help guys. Appreciated!
1873186,bassface44,2013-06-17 11:03:00,96,Is there info some where on what the eligible services are? Does it need to be 3 services?
1873282,v-bay gord,2013-06-17 11:25:00,3168,Just one eligible service. I use fish cleaning. Not sure where you would find a list of eligible services.
1873298,bassface44,2013-06-17 11:27:00,96,Thanks. I did some more searching and transportation seems to qualify and we are definitely transported to our resort.
1874050,bassface44,2013-06-17 14:21:00,96,"excuse the ignorance gentlemen. How should the receipt be filled out and what part of the HST should I expect back? We go for a week and our trip price is ""all inclusive"" for lodging, boats, motors, transport to the lodge, gas and ice. Does the receipt need to be itemized or is the lump sum adequate? Thanks for any help. Totally thought they had discontinued the rebate programs so I am having a little bit of a fire drill here with the outfitter trying to get the proper stuff out the door before the one year mark and before we leave for this years trip"
