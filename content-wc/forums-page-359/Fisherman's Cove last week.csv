We endured two major thunder storms - Sunday and Tuesday - both during the night. Sunday was a good day in McKenzie. My bride landed a fat 40"" pike on a jig and minnow. Monday and Wednesday were a little slow following the storms. Thursday afternoon we had a Lac Seul moment - 8 walleyes 24"" and up in about 3 hours. All in all, it was a great trip - one we look forward to every year. The Denzlers run a quality lodge and provide great service. 357 days and counting!!!!!"
