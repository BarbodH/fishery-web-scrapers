2060018,onetimedave,2013-08-26 16:13:00,502,We usually see moose on or near Melchett. Meta creek and both branches of the Kap river between Kap and Melchett Lake.
2024290,halfmoon007,2013-08-12 20:50:00,121,"Hey allGreat fishing at Melchett lake (AWO) for the 2nd time. Water level high was very welcome. Great walleye fishing as it was last year. party of 6 boating a lot of fish. had a 27, and lots of 26 25,24, etc with a very hard time catching 16-17 eaters. thats a walleye fisherman's dream....LOL. shure had a **** of a crop of skeeters for august but a man has to do what he needs to do. in my boat with my son we went thru 60 berkly ripple shads on 1/4 oz jigs in 3 days and you can get about 10 fish on each rubber shad. We dont count fish but I,m shure we smoked onetimedave and that old Tightliner by meeny meeny fish. also we dont write our numbers in the rafters of the screended in porch as not to embarass them. I was was Impressed by the entry on the blue outhouse door by Jerry B with a 12-3/4 dog log LOL. Hey another great year with FAT walleye,s and AWO thanks Remi and Chris. Also had a visit from the BIG yellow Bird (MNR) at camp and we were all legal as usual for the campbell party. one stray blue empty can in a boat at dock ....no problem . NO dought will have to go back up in 2014 from the great college football state of MICHIGAN and clean up melchett of all the walleyes them Buckeyes leave behind in May. ...............Halfmoon and the Campbell party __________________ Uncle Dougie says "" NEVER LET A WOMAN COOK YOUR FISH"" https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...ttons/edit.gif"
2024706,dog2,2013-08-13 05:57:00,198,Now that was a challenge? good report was wondering about the water levels. Did you fish the surrounding lakes.How was the wildlife any bears moose ect.
2024738,onetimedave,2013-08-13 06:13:00,502,We leave a lot of eyes behind because we only keep eaters and take nothing home.
2026290,vteye,2013-08-13 16:40:00,812,Sounds like you had a great trip - did you do any pike fishing? We fished next lake up Kayedon early this season.
2028202,hoppy63,2013-08-14 11:29:00,367,"How is kayedon.......numbers, size for walleye and pike?"
2031946,halfmoon007,2013-08-15 19:17:00,121,"we all fished up the river ( left and right ) and caught walleyes but never spent time in Kay-don. my son and i went to tester lake and that was a fun adventure. hooked a few walleyes but only had 2 hrs to spend there, lots of fun thought. as for pike we dont fish them but sure do catch a lot. 3 boats of 2 with 1 boat jigging 99% of time my son and I jig 80% with rest bottom bouncing rapalas. We actually spent about 8 hrs trying to catch perch with no luck. but i know there every ware. third boat bottom bounces spin and glo""s with night crawlers with results of a lot of big Quality fish. Back to pike were all on 8LB line with no leader so its like the under water scissors but we boat a lot of them just to save your lure. We are amassed at the quality of of the walleyes compared to the chaplau area lakes we fished for 18 years. You have insect based lakes for for-edge then you have minnow based lakes and that is the key to quality fish. so for us its an extra 4-5 hr drive at @ 80-90 km a hour . Its is worth it! Sure thought I could Rile up them Buckeyes with my Original post but i""m guessing they realize its going to be a blue year with a hint of green . Hey love this site and all the Canadian EH........Moon"
2032762,onetimedave,2013-08-16 06:25:00,502,Forget the Ohio State and Michigan war and lets talk Nakina fishing spots. What do you call quality fish? I have been to Melchett at least 15 times. This is one QUALITY FISHERY. The amount of water flowing into the lake along with much structure makes this a walleye honey hole. But as with other lakes you can be there at a time and not catch many fish. Also Remi and Christine at AWO really take care of you.
2053138,halfmoon007,2013-08-23 18:57:00,121,"Quality to me is the FAT walleyes at melchett. and their so **** lively to get a hand on to get unhooked, Hope to see you in Novi Dave in 2014 to select a 2nd lake for a 2nd trip to Nakina area. almost to retirement age a feeling the need for 2 AWO's a year.
