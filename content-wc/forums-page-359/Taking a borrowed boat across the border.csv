2043130,Bakefish,2013-08-20 14:08:00,1077,"I'm due to make my second Canada trip of the year at the end of September. A couple of days ago I decided to take my boat in for a check up. It's been acting up a little...hard starting, dying out when shifting from neutral and leaving a rainbow at the dock.Mechanic called me up and told me the first thing he does before he works on a motor is check compression. I have a 1995 90 hp Johnson. 3 cylinders were over 100. One was at 30. Very bad news. Could be a ring, could be head gasket, bad cylinder caused by no oil. I haven't gotten the full story yet, but in the event of the worst, I may have to borrow a boat from my son. Does anyone know what I'd have to do to ensure that I have no trouble getting that boat over the border. I'm from Illinois and he's from Wisconsin, so it'll be more than obvious that something is out of the ordinary, not that I'm trying to put one over on anyone, just trying to avoid problems. Thanks."

I have borrowed trucks before and never been asked so I doubt they would question a boat registration. I think if it was me though, I would probably have a note from your son saying its OK for you to have it. Never hurts to have too much documentation.Have a good trip!!!!"
2043250,LOW1,2013-08-20 14:47:00,2828,"I think SKAP is correct. So many boats cross the border that I doubt if it would even be noticed. Just in case, take the signed note suggested by SKAP. On the note, make reference to the registration number of the boat and include your son's telephone number. Having the note typed and notarized would not hurt and would make it look more professional. And take a copy of the boat's title with you so that your son's ownership could be verified.I don't think that you will have any issues."

2044889,Bakefish,2013-08-21 06:49:00,1077,"Sconnies have their own way about them. Good people, but sometimes strange Thanks for the tips guys. I may or may not need to borrow the boat. Mine has been diagnosed as a mess. One of the pistons had a part cracked off and scored the cylinder some. It's an 18 year old motor and I'm looking at a complete rebuild. My mechanic says he'll have it in about two weeks, which gives me plenty of time, but I'm covering all my bases.I did have a little fun with it though. I called up my fishing buddy and told him my block was cracked and we'd have to cancel the trip. I let him stew for a couple minutes and then I came clean.My ears are still burning. My buddy spends the night before the trip at my house, so I guess this would be a case of ""crossing the boarder""."
2046137,pike50plus,2013-08-21 12:16:00,584,I have done that before and in addition to the registration from the owner I would take a notorized document that you have permission to have the boat and are insured while operating it.
