2029970,Pat,2013-08-14 22:06:00,203,I've stayed at Sha Sha and it worked out well.http://www.shashaonrainylake.com/

If you haven't fished Rainy before, highly recommend reserving a guide in advance for best fishing results. I lived on Rainy Lake for a summer 40 years ago when I was young. BEST summer ever of my life!!!!!! Good luck! Part of the fun of a fishing trip is planning it! RBF"

2032490,rather-be-fishin,2013-08-15 22:27:00,429,Check out these websites:http://www.rainylake.org/resorts.html rainylakehouseboats.com northernairehouseboats.com Kettle Falls Hotel. (Boat in access) Not a lot of resorts on MN side of Rainy Lake. IMHO I feel the lake gets a good amount of fishing pressure & you have to know where & how to fish it. I don't feel it compares to fishing in Canada. Another thought would be MN side of Lake of the Woods. Have you fished there? Good Luck
