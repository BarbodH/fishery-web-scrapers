1460076,retire55,2012-07-10 17:48:00,1029,"St.-Cyr Royal has been on my ""bucket list"" for several years. I'd like to do that trip before I hang up my gear. Since St.-Cyr Royal is in Quebec, here is a web reference to an outfitter on connected waterways with St.-Cyr Royal:http://www.kapitachuan.com/ As well, here are web references for some Quebec outfitters in the Abitibi/TÃ©miscaming region (about 100 miles south west of St.-Cyr Royal):http://www.3seasonscamp.com/http://www.kipawalodge.com/index.htmlhttp://www.clubtroutlake.com/http://www.ogascanan.com/http://www.bushcountrycamp.com/bushc...p/Welcome.html"

They're there with you the whole time. They'll listen to your fishing stories, talk politics, talk about the lodge (they built it themselves), talk cooking, whatever. You feel at home with all of them. Here's your day...You wake up, go downstairs to eat a hot breakfast, grab your lunch bag (already prepared) and as many beers as you want (if that's your thing) and you head to your boat which has been cleaned out and all gassed up for you. You fish all day. Then you go back to the lodge to a crackling fire and a few smiling faces asking how the day was. You shower up, head downstairs for a ridiculous home-cooked meal, drink more beer (if that's your thing), play some pool, play some cards...tell your fish stories...and do it all again tomorrow.We went a few years ago with 8 guys...caught well over 1500 fish in a week. Some huge ones, tons of average ones. Never a dull moment.There's noplace else like it. It's definitely pricey, (run you about $4k for a week including tips and a day or two of a guide) but if you can afford to do it, it's worth every penny.I'm not them...I'm just a guy from NYC who loves this place. Happy to answer questions if you have 'em."

2042642,Walleye_Willy,2013-08-20 10:49:00,3,"You won't be disappointed...Never gone this time of year, but they'll know where to send you. This year I got a 40"" pike....oh...and 177 walleye/pike/a carp in our boat in one day with Jason guiding us in late June. You probably won't see those numbers in late August, but what do I know anyway. Enjoy yourself....and tell Jason you want to fish 'The Tip'. And ask for chicken wings too...mom makes awesome chicken wings if that's your thing. It's the best place on earth. No BS."

2043986,Terwalleye,2013-08-20 18:39:00,166,So the year 1/2 oldpost asked for other suggestions. Here is my bucket list trip.http://www.boois.com/Not just based on the website and pics; but cuz a few knowledgable folks on this site were very confident about it being the best fishing they had experienced in 30 plus trips to Canada.
2044322,Walleye_Willy,2013-08-20 20:31:00,3,"That's easily the nicest alternative I've seen....and good pricing. Really really far for me though. The cabins and level of service are not going to be comparable though. St Cyr is over the top luxury. They do everything for you, and the house is ridiculous. I don't mean to minimize anyplace else, it's just a different experience. It's not outpost or lakefront, it's full service the entire time you're there."
