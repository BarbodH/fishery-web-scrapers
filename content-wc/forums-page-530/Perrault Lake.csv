Most of the rocks, etc. will have a jug floating by them. When you are traveling through the narrows where there is an old burned out bridge, slow down and watch out for a couple of rocks, usually will have a jug. That's an area where we just idle through, especially when water level is a little low.You may also want to ask if there ever is much concern over wind conditions.I'll try to pm you......"
1210543,TBLoutdoors,2010-06-16 05:51:00,3,"I will be staying at Rocky Shore Lodge on Perrault Lake July 3rd to the 8th. I am looking for current fishing reports from the Lake or any fishing tips for this lake for this time of year. I am not overly experienced fishing for walleye so I am looking for any tips I can gather. Also wanting to catch some Northern, I know locals and regulars may not care for these but I am from Missouri and we do not have a chance to catch them down here."
1210901,WalleyeWally28,2010-06-17 05:39:00,298,"Hey guys, here's a new member looking for some help. Anyone out there that can give him some info on Perrault Lake?"
1210938,digjig,2010-06-17 07:43:00,146,"Hey TBL, I will be on Perrault at the same time (week of 7/3) across the way at Rainbow Point. We were on Perrault the 2nd week of June last year. At that time the walleye were still in the Ord river (north side of the lake). Several people in camp did very well on the Ord. There are some fingered shaped bays at the north end of the lake that are great for nice sized perch. Grassy Bay (3rd bay on the west side) is a very good Jackfish spot. The back of the bay is filled with reeds. Cast into the weedline and you are in the right neighborhood. I actually had a nice Pike on the first cast using a big topwater plug. That left a lasting impression : ) It seemed like bigger was better as far as Pike lures. Had luck with walleye off the first island coming from the south. It has a rock face that drops straight down 3 ft to ~20 feet. They like to hang on the edge where the current flows around the island. Good small mouth fishing in some of the protected bay areas too. Look for fallen timber in the bays and cast your favorite bass lure in. I did not get over to the east side of the lake too much. I'll have to try that this year. See you in Grassy Bay. I'll be in a Rainbow Point boat with the wife and two kids. Pull up and say ""Hi"" if you see us. -DJ"
1211497,go dart,2010-06-19 06:02:00,77,"Hey TBL just got back from Perrault and also stayed at Rocky Shore as well. I've been many times but always hire the lodges guide ( terry ). You could easily spend 3 days patterning fish when what you really want to do is catch fish. Hire him for the first day, he'll put you on fish. Tell Mike now if you use him so he can schedual. Theres alot of fishing up there for multi species. Smallmouth where theres rock and some really big ones too, Perch in the weeds back of bays, not sure where Northerns will be but head to Cedar for Musky hunting. Fish the bays and points on the Cedar side after the burnt bridge (run down a bit) Walleye should be in traditional summer spots like the flats off Haystack rock. Mike and Chris are great lodge owners. Get an upgrade boat and check friends of rocky shore lodge on facebook for the latest imfo from the lodge. Good luck."
1211578,Kevin R,2010-06-19 13:41:00,305,"Look for rocks that have commorants on them they eat fish lots of fish thats a good place to start fishing. You will see some areas that are bird free why because they don't hold fish don't waste your time fishing those areas. I watched a loon grab about a 24"" pike just a few feet from my boat last year I didn't think they ate fish that big before."
1211614,Graintrader,2010-06-19 17:31:00,1,"Just got back from Perrault friday. I have to say the fishing was pretty poor, especially for the walleye, even terry had a very hard time getting us enough fish for shore lunch the first day. Try cedar island, it's your best bet."
1211707,go dart,2010-06-20 07:49:00,77,"Hey Trader I'm from Shawnee too! Did you stay at RockyShore? I'll agree Terry's not the best guide but the fish are moving constantly. Cedar Island is a feeding station while they filter back into the lake. He gave us several other spots and we were able to stay on walleye all week. It was the best walleye fishing I've ever had on Perrault. I returned 5 big walleyes well over 18""."
1211716,Kevin R,2010-06-20 08:07:00,305,"Last Year I caught more Walleye while fishing small cuts in rocks just like the Smallmouth Bass can be found in. The big flats were empty the weeds did hold fish but were less action than rocks or ledges. Most days I did not show any fish on my screen they were buried in the rocks & boat postion was key to catching them. A few years ago the flats had huge schools of Walleye & the rocks were 10- Bass to 1-Walleye. I never marked a large School of Walleye last year. Was thinking they would school up this year, but sounds like they are hard to find again. I do not fish early Day break or evening or at night like most do on the lake for Walleye, I fish when the sun is out. The sand bar loads up with boats when I am heading in but last year I was told it was slow all year."
1212368,TBLoutdoors,2010-06-22 04:40:00,3,"Thanks for all the advice. I am taking my own boat, 50HP, and was wondering how far a ride it is to get into Cedar Lake from Rocky Shore Lodge. I may want to make a day of going over there. Are there any navigation concerns I need to be aware of?Thanks again"
1212513,go dart,2010-06-22 10:59:00,77,Everything's pretty well marked but always watch for the stray rockpile close to points or bank. (then fish em for smallmouth) With a 50 horse you'll make the 3rd bay in Cedar in 18 or 19 min. One tip I can give you is when the wind is blowing into the backside of lil haystack hit the corner with the reef. Stacks up bait and the fish follow. Good luk and post a report.
