Biggest laker in our group was 32 inches, walleye 28 inches, smally 18inches and pike was 36 inches. Camp got checked by the MNR on Thursday. 2 groups got fined because the shore lunch they ate put them over, so be careful about your limits. Saw a cow moose and 2 calves swimming across the lake and got within 20 yards of them in the boat and followed them across the lake. They then proceeded to stay in camp most of the week. The border crossing on the way out was a 1:30 wait. All in all another great fishing trip.Scott"
