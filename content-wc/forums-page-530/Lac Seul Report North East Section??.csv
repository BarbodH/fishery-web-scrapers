New to the site and I will be heading up to Andersons lodge the week of July 11th staying at the kakebeka camp this will be our 10th year going. We usually make runs to the scaler lake area and fish snowmobile point as well. Was wondering how the fishing has been recently? Water levels? also if anybody has any spots that they would be willing to share in that area it would be greatly appreciated! ( Also how has the northern and musky fishing been? )Thanks Everybody!Tight Lines

I'd go a bit deeper if you're looking for a hog. Any point, reef or quick drop off will probably hold fish somewhere around it. If you're not catching fish in 15 mins on a spot, MOVE! Keep looking, running and gunning is the best way to find an active bite. I guided in this area today and boated 100 walleye, easy. Good luck and have fun! Ben Beattie"
