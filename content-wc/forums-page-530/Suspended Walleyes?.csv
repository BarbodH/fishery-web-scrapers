I'd think that trolling crankbaits would be productive, like I read about in Saginaw Bay and other big water. But I've never heard about anybody fishing like that when I went up there, and I couldn't find anything in this forum about it."

Although we have never found this to be anywhere near as productive for numbers of fish, it is a good tactic for catching bigger fish. Try ""speed trolling"" Deep Tail Dancers at a ROCKET speed (for walleyes) about 3.5 mph. This will produce some ""reaction"" bites from suspended walleyes that might not otherwise go on anything else.That said, my general rule of thumb is if I am marking suspended fish I move on. Too many fish feeding at or near bottom to spend your valuable time chasing suspenders.Just my $.02 worth.Dave"
