Anything fishing related about Canada is much wanted! Thanks."

We had our best luck right across from Sturgeon River Lodge in very shallow water, foot or less. We were casting black whistler jigs tipped with a leech. We had 60-80 walleyes a day and had 16 over 24 inches on the week and our biggest was 28 inches. I can't wait to go again next year! The owners were great and the food was awesome!"
