1213576,Crede,2010-06-25 22:04:00,134,"Fished the rivers at the south end one day (especially the one labelled South River). Have had great success with walleyes there before (late May/early June). No eyes there at all. In fairness, when I asked the guide about it the day before he told me that he had tried it about 10 days earlier and that all of the walleye were gone. However, the boys wanted to spend a day looking for pike so we gave it a try. Caught good numbers of pike there but nothing over 33"". Tried Van Poele River for about an hour. One small walleye. Fished the river exiting the lake - to the Opichuan - had pretty good walleye fishing there. Most success for walleye was on northern shore of 3 sisters islands, at Old Cabin Point (across from lodge), and at Frying pan island (north and south of it). Caught most in 15-22 feet of water - on the bottom. Most of the walleye were 20-23 inches. Largest up to 27"". Few less than 17"". Not sure what improvements you were looking for. Things seemed to me to be the same as they have been for the last number of years. If you were looking for anything in particular, let me know and I will do my best to answer your question."

1211870,oleJoe,2010-06-20 17:36:00,114,We flew in to Melchett Lake on the 28th of May and out on the 4th of June. The fishing was great as usual with the water being a little low and about 69 temp. But that changed with the rain we got for about 4 days. Water came up about a foot and temp went down 6 degrees. Sure looked like summer with the leaves out and things turning green in the water. We flew in with Artic watershed Outfitters for the 15th yr and found everything as reliable as usual. No big fish but many 18 to 22 waleye. 24 being the largest. No big pike this year but they had left the shore and we really didn't look to hard. 6 guys and 1746 fish and the older we get the less pressure there is to catch fish. Already packing for next year.
1211999,MSUICEMAN,2010-06-21 08:39:00,458,"years and years ago, fished hebner. hundreds and hundreds of walleye... 17-22""... i think our biggest was about 24, maybe 25. quite a few pike, none huge landed, but I had a monster on that broke off."
1212345,fishforlife,2010-06-21 22:42:00,77,"Tightliner, My group of eight will be flying into Brace Lake 8-28 through 9-4 on Nakina Air. We have two in our group also will be Bear hunting. I got an e-mail from my outfitter today, and the water level in Brace is currently down 1-foot. Not too bad since ice out the level was 3-feet down. He reports good fishing as expected. I'll give a report when we get back."
1212969,Crede,2010-06-23 14:32:00,134,"Fished Kagianagami with Leuenbergers 6/12-6/19/2010. Weather warmer than usual (never used wood stove). Never got out the raingear. No bugs at all. Never used bug spray or headnet. Sat out on deck every night. 1 mosquito bite between the 8 of us for the week. Mayflies still haven't hatched there. Flight in, cabins, boats and motors, staff, etc. all great as usual. Very windy on Friday to the point where they took all of the boats out of the water around noon. Finally got out after dinner and had a great 2 hours of fishing to finish up the week. Fished primarily walleye. Expected to catch most in 8-12 feet of water but ended up getting most in 15-22 feet. Surface water temp about 61 degrees and stayed around there. Tried most of the lake (not up into Humble Bay). Best fishing in the northern half of the lake. Walleye seemed pretty scattered. Pull up to a point or reef, catch 3 or 4 per boat right away. Then nothing for 20-30 minutes. Move on to next spot and repeat. Seemed like more of a late July/early August pattern to me. All in all a good trip. My 82 year old father went on his 4th consecutive ""last time I'm going to Canada"" trip. Had a great time."
1213474,Zenbutcher,2010-06-25 13:19:00,1,"Just fished Whitefish Lake with Leuenberger's June 6-13. Fishing was excellent. Have been here 4 times in 1996, 1998, 2006, 2010. Always great fishing. Walleyes in abundance. Pike we did not seek out this year, but while trolling made some effort to go past points and boulders and picked up some nice ones. Biggest was 30"", I ate that one that evening.Eyes were mainly in the eating size 15-18 inches, we caught a few in the 20-22 range. Perfect. Weather was good. Sunny/partly cloudy for the first 3 days 60-65 degrees. Then it rained one day and was overcast the rest, but did not slow down the fishing. Hardly any bugs at all since there has been little rain this spring.Have been going with Leuenberger's for 16 years. Great outfitter, cabins are excellent. Propane fridge, stove, bunks, showers, running water. Cabins on lakes are either river or lake oriented features so pick what you prefer.I have been to Whitefish, Percy, Muskrat, Felsia/Hurst, Kapatowanga/Melchett, Elbow, and Kellow. All are awesome."
1213509,TIGHTLINER,2010-06-25 16:02:00,223,Crede.. Were the eyes still in the river or had they left ??? Where did you find the best fishing for the eyes?? Did you get down to the three rivers at the other end of the lake for the northern fishing?? Thinking of going back next year if the outfitter made some improvements.Thanks
1213555,515,2010-06-25 19:42:00,254,"Zen I sent you a PM as we are heading into Whitefish in a couple of weeks. Our 9th trip with Leuenbergers and can't wait, second time hitting Whitefish. Good to hear you had fun up there."
