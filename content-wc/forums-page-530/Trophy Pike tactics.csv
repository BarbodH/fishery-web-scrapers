1213087,Bigfishhunter,2010-06-23 21:00:00,803,"Don't ever listen to someone trying to tell you that you can only catch fish in spring and fall. My best time of year, every year, is in mid to late July. I pound the weedbeds hard and I expect to get at least 1 40"" everyday. Now I live on one of the best Pike lakes there is and I fish every day from July 1-August 30, so I am lucky. But if it were me booking a trip, I would not hesitate to take summer months. If the fishing is not good during those months, then you have picked a bad location.Like previously mentioned I like working suicks and I like em weighted. Sometimes I will even drill holes and add my own weight or additional weight, so they really hang in the zone and rise very slowly.Yes, you will want to use a leader. I use 50 lb braid, and then I make my own leaders with either Fluorcarbon or steel wire. I buy Berkely Vanish Fluorocarbob ""LEADER MATERIAL"" attach a 18"" section to my main line with a double uni, then I tie on a quality snap swivel."
1213099,Pooch,2010-06-23 21:55:00,4619,"Do you know the entrance to South-east bay? Just before the opening there is a side bay that should have a good weed bed going by the time you get there. It is a large weed bed area and froml time to time see nice northern come from that area.There are not a lot of weed beds in Savant as it has so much deep water. You might try the area on the North-west side of Pine island. There are scattered weeds in and around those small islands. Also the North-west side of Big Sandy has weeds and a sandy bottom. Be careful in that area as there are some hidden rocks sticking just under the surface even in what appears to be ""safe"" depths at normal pool. I've had a couple close calls in that area.If the wind has been blowing into ""The wall"" work that shore line, especially the pockets along that area. We've caught some decent Northern there trolling for walleye. Very deep water close by so you might try deeper and cooler water if you strike out in the weeds. While in that area try the north end of that land mass on into the bay. Try going straight west from that area another half mile and there is another bay back there that could have possibilitiesJust south of Cliff's, but before the narrows is a river that you can go into that should be a northern magnet. If you go into that area it appears that you are at the end, keep going as you are not! This might be the best place to start.Hope to see you on the water.Pooch"
1213138,Fish_on,2010-06-24 07:13:00,1856,"Pike will be in the deep cabbage in July, especially in the evenings. Leader? Definitely. Pike can slice through 30# Power Pro like it is warm butter. Find the cabbage weed growing in 6-8+ feet depending on water clarity and you will find the pike. They often hold off the edges of the weeds in deeper water during the day, or just lay on the bottom. In the evening they come out to play."
1213140,Bob_Loblaw,2010-06-24 07:17:00,109,"Thanks for all the ideas, folks. Gary - I remember Cliff mentioning a place called Twin Bays that's somewhere SSE of their camp. He said it has a really good weed bed, but we never got to try it out last year. I'm not sure where South-east bay is; I'll have to look on a map. We spent almost all our time last year fishing north of Cliff and Roma's, along Vertical Coast, Loretta's Bay and little points and islands around there. There are a couple of small bays separated by a little point just north of Vertical Coast - they're 5-8 feet deep and had pretty dense cabbage. We didn't spend a lot of time there since my cousin wanted to fish all walleyes, but we did pull a 38"" out of there. Since I'm planning on making this an annual trip, I want to do some exploring this year and try some new areas. I'll hopefully see you out there."
1212131,Bob_Loblaw,2010-06-21 13:46:00,109,"When I head up to Savant Lake in a couple weeks, I'd like to spend a little time chasing some big pike. Any ideas (especially from Pooch or others who have fished Savant) on how to locate areas that hold big northern pike and what lures/presentations are usually a good bet?"
1212590,Bigfishhunter,2010-06-22 13:48:00,803,"My best tactic when the weed beds are up nice and thick, but not quite on the surface is a suick worked nice and easy over the tops. They come at it like a freight train. Also, take a rapala super shad, cast it out over the bed, hold rod tip at 11:00 and slowly crank the reel, letting the lure wobble on top but don't let it dive. Killer topwater in the evening or calm days.I also like big 6-7"" hollow belly swim baits with a 3/4 oz head rigged in front and through like a grub and swam quickly over humps, alongside beds etc. Just chuck all day long in good locations, you will get em."
1212727,Brian884,2010-06-22 21:29:00,8,"I have never been to savant lake but on other lakes I use a lot of jerk baits. I usually drill a hole near the front of them and melt some lead to pour in them. This makes them dive deeper and has worked well. I make many of my own jerk baits and paint them all diferent colors, trying to throw something at them that they have never seen. Reef Hogs are another jerk bait I have had good luck with, put a red feather tail on them for an added touch. And fish the cabage weeds. Good luck fishing."
1212785,Golden Eagle,2010-06-23 06:45:00,2642,"Bigfishhunter, you're bang on with the almost do nothing method of fishing Suicks. It's my favorite and it doesn't wear out the fisherman, unless you count the effort need for bringing in lots of big fish."
1212800,Bob_Loblaw,2010-06-23 07:23:00,109,"I don't own a Suick, so I guess I have some shopping to do! Any particular color/size that has worked well for you?"
1212850,Golden Eagle,2010-06-23 09:19:00,2642,"I use 9"" Suicks, both weighted and non weighted. Match what the pike feed on in the water you fish. Perch and Walleye colors are easy, but also include something with a white belly to appear as a whitefish. Firetiger color is good. Orange is attractive to the buyer and fish seem to eat them. Gander Mountain stores carry Suicks and their prices are competitive. You'll go in expecting to purchase two and leave with five."
1212855,PIKEMAN330,2010-06-23 09:31:00,101,Mid july might be a little tough because of warming water temps. I always try to go spring or late fall.
1212991,keek,2010-06-23 15:40:00,1003,"I boated a 42"" pike last week in Canada on a bone colored Rattilin Zara Spook. Making as much noise as I could in 2 ft of water with this thing. They cast a mile which lets you work a ton of water without having to motor the boat in close to the weed beds. They come stock with Mustad Ultra Triple Grip hook which is key to keep the hook in their mouth as they shale and throw a surface plug. I also had a hit on a large saltwater pink Rapala Skitter Pop. This version is 6"" long and pretty beefy. Used 20lb fireline with no leader."
1213022,Beagle_Nut,2010-06-23 17:13:00,52,"I'm a once-a-year pike fisherman from St. Louis so I'm sure no expert, but the main thing I'd say is to always use a steel or real heavy flourocarbon leader unless you want to leave behind a good number of those lures you're going to buy for the trip. Good luck, northerns are the fish we target whenever we go up north, great fun to catch and great eating too as long as you know the basics of getting the y-bones out."
1213048,Bob_Loblaw,2010-06-23 18:11:00,109,Will I need a leader if I use my bass fishing rig that's spooled with 30# Power Pro braid?
