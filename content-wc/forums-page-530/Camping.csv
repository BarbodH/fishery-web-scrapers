There is nothing like relaxing in your tent after a day of walleye fishing with your son, and hearing a big motor home move in next ""door"" and start up the microwave popcorn, and yelling at the ballgame on TV?! For me I like to get away from all of the creature comforts, while in Canada. But to each his own! My new ""neighbors"" were nice people, like most walleye wranglers are. They had never been to the ""mightly Lac"", I gave them a few pointers, where the fish are, what types of lures for pike. Have a safe trip, and keep us up to date on where they are biting!!"

1213119,brn2fsh,2010-06-24 05:08:00,49,You lac seul guys ever have any problems with critters (Large or small) and tents? This could really increase my # of Canadian trips!!
1213146,wallydave,2010-06-24 07:37:00,2151,"At Goose Bay when my son and I tent camped, we saw a black bear along side the road, we stopped and took a picture. We also discussed no food in the tent. I have been going to Goose Bay for about 10 years, off and on, we have never had any problems other than otters raiding the minnow bucket. A former co-worker, used to tent camp in the Separation Lake area, they would have bears getting into thier cook tent on a regular basis. The more remote the area, the better chance of meeting with bears and other ""native Canadians"". One year my boat and cabin buddy were at Nunngesser outpost, they saw signs of bears, but didn't have any direct encounters. Be aware of the possability of bears and the like, plan for it and take all the precautions and you will have more than just fish stories to tell!"
1213178,Paxton,2010-06-24 09:41:00,10,Thanks for the info.
1213320,brn2fsh,2010-06-24 19:53:00,49,"Yea, we were also at Goose bay about 13 years ago. Lots of Walleyes , but we never saw anyone camping. We did use the shower house (Small cabin) and it was real nice. Also, thanks for the info!!"
