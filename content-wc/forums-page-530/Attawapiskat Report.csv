1212190,Mike Borger,2010-06-21 16:29:00,1554,"Just returned on Sunday from the most incredible trip of my life.My group of 6 flew north out of Nakina into Beteau lake on the Attawapiskat River June 12-19.Every member of the group caught multiple pike over 40"". Many in the 42-45"" range, largest was 473/4"" caught by yours truly.The overall numbers were staggering. We didn't really target walleye but we caught them in abundance as well. Many of the walleye were incidental catches hammering large pike sized bucktails and spinnerbaits. Largest 'eye for the week was 291/4"" also caught by yours truly.As per the camp policy all fish beyond the handful we ate for shore lunch were released to swim again.I'd be happy to post a more detailed report when I have time if you're interested.Until then a few pic's from paradise.http://i656.photobucket.com/albums/u...awapiskat7.jpghttp://i656.photobucket.com/albums/u...awapiskat4.jpghttp://i656.photobucket.com/albums/u...awapiskat3.jpghttp://i656.photobucket.com/albums/u...awapiskat1.jpghttp://i656.photobucket.com/albums/u...awapiskat5.jpghttp://i656.photobucket.com/albums/u...awapiskat6.jpg"
