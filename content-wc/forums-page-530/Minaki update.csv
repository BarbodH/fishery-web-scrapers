1210324,Reels,2010-06-15 12:13:00,2876,"We are staying at Barbers, but fish big sand 85% of the time. Thanks for the update from your dad. I love trolling up there in the evening. I'll be in a white and red ranger with Yamahas on the back and a fins and skins logo on the side. (Fish with a golf club)"
1210959,Danny61,2010-06-17 08:57:00,42,If you would like to see some recent great action at Minaki check out J.P.'s Minaki Walleye Classic website there's a great video on it with 3 overs!!!!
1212158,Insuranceeric,2010-06-21 14:54:00,5,"Got back 6/19 and had very good walleye fishing. We fished mostly in Big Sand around Sand Beach, Trapper's, Green Island and several reefs. We also had success in Harbour Bay and around Strawberry Island and the Rock Fence. We fished in 18-24 feet using spinners, jigs and Lindy rigs with leeches and crawlers. It seemed that brighter colored spinners worked the best, chartruese and orange blades, but every live bait rig caught fish. Many big walleyes, 2 - 29""+, probably a dozen 26-28"" and many in the 21-25"" range and 18-20"". We also caught alot of 12-14"" fish, the fewest size caught were the slot fish of 14-18"", but still managed to eat a few. Did drag some shad raps around and caught fish that way as well. Northerns and smallies were abundant as well, saw several big muskies follow, but only landed one and she was 43"". No real monstrous pike or smallies to report, but alot of real healthy looking fish. Good Luck to all! Eric"
1212728,RMKinWI,2010-06-22 21:34:00,3,"I am heading up to Paradise Cove, Minaki on Friday, it will be my first time in this area. As you can imagine I am a little nervous - there looks to be a lot of water and not knowing the area I hope I can find the fish. Fishing at home we mostly use crank baits, jigs and slip bobbers. I see alot of talk about Lindy rigs and Spinners - I have a idea of the lindy rig, but when you refer to spinners - that is like a lindy rig but with a spoon and beads correct? I just want to make sure I have what I need. Do you make your own lindy rigs or do you purchase them assembled - what should I not leave home without specifically?? Thanks Guys Matt"
1212764,steven paulson,2010-06-23 04:02:00,20,Nothland tackle makes alot of different colors. Also if your at Paradice Duane will set you up. Have a good time i'll be there the 28.

1213849,Reels,2010-06-27 09:27:00,2876,"Just got back last night. Fishing was very good with a lot of big fish. Bottom bouncers with a snell worked very good. (Thanks to JP and the Smoking dad video) Lots of fish in the upper 20's on big sand. Pulling spinners worked well too when trying to locate the fish. In Little Sand the hidden reefs near raspberry produced some hog walleyes. Two twenty nines, and several between 25-27"". Crawlers and leaches both worked. Didnt seem to matter much. Although I didn't fish it, heard good reports from Rough Rock Narrows. It was a good trip and seeing several year classes from small to large was encouraging to see. There was a heavy mayfly hatch when we fist arrived, and it may have slow things a bit on gun and little sand, I don't think it effected big sand much. Thanks to Dave for being the fish fry guru. Nothing like fresh walleyes!"
1207800,camp chef,2010-06-07 11:26:00,915,We got back Friday night late from a week in Minaki.We arrived in a Thunderstorm and for the first several days we had typical Canadian weather. It stormed on and off with some sun mixed in. Water levels are normal but there is virtully no current because the dams are shut down. Everything is a month early and we had a hard time finding Walleyes down south. The ones we did catch were nice though a couple of 26's and a 30 class fish spit the jig at the boat. We had great northern fishing with several in the low 40's Not many pictures of the fish this trip.Seems the ones worth pictures were all caught in the rain. Smallies were on the beds.Lots of water coming into the mcFarland river. Great day fishing bass and small pike back by the waterfall for a day. We had a mayfly hatch last Thursday.The noseeums also made an arrival the same day. The crawlers from the sporting goods shop right in Nestor Falls were terrible. We're going to get them in Souix Narrows again next year. Potatoes are legal to bring in.We had an old fox come to the cabin for scraps every evening.We named him ward. Good luck to all going up. Bryon
1207814,wolverine fan,2010-06-07 12:01:00,71,Thanks for the update and glad the fishing was good. I leave in one hour and cant wait. I almost hate it when its time to go because that means im gonna be home ina week! I'll update when i get back.
1207816,Aaron-IN,2010-06-07 12:06:00,500,"Camp Chef,What was the water temp? I'm surprised the bass are still on the beds. Has the burn ban been lifted? Heading up on the 17th for 10 days."
1207819,camp chef,2010-06-07 12:10:00,915,"We had 62 degrees the last day. Yes the burn ban is lifted...They have had lots of rain the last couple of weeks.As far as the Smallies are considered, all I can tell you is what we saw. We don't fish them much and don't know their habits up there like you guys do."
1207822,Reels,2010-06-07 12:16:00,2876,Thanks for the report. We leave the 17th for a week.
1210050,wolverine fan,2010-06-14 14:22:00,71,"Got back yesterday from Rough rock lodge- nice people. Fished tuesday thru sat afternoon. Never saw the sun once. Rained 80 percent of the time, the other 20percent it poured! Fishing was slower than before ""but"" we caught many bigger fish this year. One day i set my personal best of 40"" for a northern only to be broken by a 41"" the next day. My brother set his personal best of a 45"" musky while northern fishing. We caught 5 muskies all together and each was pretty lethargic compared to the bigger notherns, man did they fight! I ended with up with a 41"", 40"", 2 39"", a 36"" and 3 34 inchers. smaller fish werent biting unless in 1-2 feet of water, hard to find. The bass were the only fish in our regular early season patterns and they were aggressive. Biggest one was only 18"" though, lots of smaller fish. Never fished for walleyes but did catch a few casting with a 21"" the biggest. Hated to leave cause it was the first time we saw the sun, had to wear sunscreen for the boat ride home!! Ugh, hope you all have a good trip this year."
1210084,Aaron-IN,2010-06-14 15:56:00,500,"Wolverine......did you end up hitting the top secret spot? PM me. (sorry about the weather, that stinks)"
1210144,Reels,2010-06-14 19:34:00,2876,"Thanks for the report wolverine. Talked to a friend who got back Saturday too and reported the same thing. Wet wet wet. He was kind of bummed, but said he did catch fish, just hard to fish for them. Reported fish are starting on the summer pattern. Aaron, maybe well see you up there next week. We'll have a couple of shore lunches if you want to stop by."
1210161,wolverine fan,2010-06-14 20:01:00,71,"yea, overcast skies and a light rain spells fish in my book but last week was the hard driving rain that hurts! My dad and brother also found out why my rain suit cost triple what theirs did. Mine said goretex on the inside, their said water resisitant, yea right. They were soaked each day and were freezing most of the time. Camp time was spent arranging and rearranging wet clothing next to the heater to be ready for the next day. Brother fished with no socks on one day and that was a mistake, he froze early. make no mistake, we caught big fish but it wasn't as pleasant as years before, but hey i ""was"" fishing!!!!!p.s you know its a bad week when the word bilge is said more than ten times!!"
1210176,Reels,2010-06-14 21:02:00,2876,"That how it was for us last July. Rained every day and was under 40 one day. While I still loved it because I had my guidewear, the others were miserable. I would much rather have 70 and sunny. Weather looks ok for next week so far, but hey, I'm not counting on the weather man to be suddenly right! With all the rain, did the current improve up by rough rock?"
