1213492,Thor29,2010-06-25 14:46:00,36,"As of today they have now evacuated the bakers narrows campground. this goes along with other camping areas in the grassy narrows park. Cranberry is under a volunteer evacuation but could turn into a mandatory at any time. The road to sherridan is closed. pth 39 from could be closed at any time. there is also a fire on 106 coming into creighton by the weir river and is causing alot of smoke. this morning visibility was less than 1/2 mile in town. fishing out on athap you would not be able to see any shore, that if you could stand the smoke. Cranberry lakes would probly be out of the questions as the fire is all around them. the last i heard this afternoon was that the north end of athap is now threatened and the cottage owners were told to move things out(sourdought bay area) thompson lake, bryan lake. starting 4 weeks holidays and not the way wanting to start. will keep you posted on any up dates."
