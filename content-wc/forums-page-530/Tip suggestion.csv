1213357,celticbass1,2010-06-24 21:57:00,67,I'm headed to Wollaston Lake Lodge on Tuesday and I've heard two different suggestions for tips for the guides. I need some opinions. I have heard $100.00 per day per boat and I've heard $100.00 per person in the boat per day. I'll be fishing with a 10 year old nephew in the boat with me and this trip is being paid for by someone else. $400.00 is pretty pricey for me but $800.00 is a weeks salary for me what do I do?
1213374,Hawker,2010-06-25 05:29:00,3967,"Just my own personal opinion (from a guides perspective) I would consider a $100 tip per day as a very very nice tip! I've no idea what the guides in the area your going are charging per day, nor if they charge per person or how their guide rate is structured, but around my part of the country a good tip is somewhere around 10-15 percent of the total charter or guide fee. Personally, (if I were you) even though someone else is picking up the tab for the guide fees, I would base a tip on how well of a job the guide does for you each day, how hard he works to put YOU on fish, how helpful he is at baiting, netting, giving instructions, and all the ""little"" things he does to make each day of fishing for you and your nephew a good and memorable experience! A guide is providing a ""SERVICE"" for you, not unlike a waitress, a bellhop etc, and is already being paid to provide that service, so taking that into consideration, base your tip on how well the guide provides his service. 10-15 percent if he does a fair to good job, maybe 20 percent if he does an outstanding job the entire time!! Don't get me wrong, I personally would consider a $100 a day tip a very nice reward (and have gotten a few of those), but unless you can truly afford to do that sort of tipping, base your tip the same as you would for any other day to day service oriented service provided you!"
1213375,v-bay gord,2010-06-25 05:32:00,3168,I don't know what the expectation is but I would only go with what you are comfortable with.......$50 a day would seem plenty to me. $800 tip for 4 days is ridiculous.
1213527,celticbass1,2010-06-25 17:45:00,67,"It seemed a little steep to me as well but this is a lodge that charges $4,195.00 for a four day trip per person so not having ever spent that kind of money on a fishing trip, I have no idea."
1213543,alanexpup,2010-06-25 19:16:00,278,"I would agree to go with what you are comfortable with. use your own pay per day as an example. after all you are not paying him again for what he is getting paid for once already. the guide probably gets 200 bucks a day at the most, dont tell me you want to tip him more than what he is getting paid to begin with. if you fish with this guide for the 4 days a $100 tip would be more than enough for the 4 days total not 100 a day. . just my 2 cents."
1213602,Obabikon,2010-06-26 04:15:00,2370,More than $100/day would be WAY WAY WAY over the top. Guides make an excellent salary as it is. Just the $100/day as the top end (if he's a great guide)... but make him earn it and if he doesn't move it less.
1213683,alanexpup,2010-06-26 12:47:00,278,"Hi. Just curious, just how much does the average guide make per day? are there any benefits included along with the salary like health retirement, things like that? is it just a cash operation with the guide paying his own taxes or maybe not even paying taxes if its unreported cash. just curious. thanks. IN the US there is a big underground unreported cash for work in operation. Is it the same way in canada, people work and dont report the cash income?"
1213765,Obabikon,2010-06-26 19:45:00,2370,"There's a couple different things Alan. First, my full time guides are definately reported. I match their taxes paid and also have to do 1.5 times there social insurance paid. The average guide probably makes about $140/$150 per day plus ""extras"". Which is typically $10 per man over two. So, if an average guide is taking 6 peole out... he'd be making $180-$190 per day plus tips. If he's a regular at the camp, you can add another $20-$30 for what it costs the operator to imploy him that day... (due to matching taxes, unemployment insurance, and social insurance) The other side of the coin are the ""cash"" guys. There's a lot of them out there. A camp owner is allowed to ""contract out"" labor. So, a guide who works on his own, and guides out of a lot of camps can bill the owners and be paid that way. Cash or check it doesn't make a difference. But, it's the contracted guides' responsibility to report and pay his taxes."
1213766,Obabikon,2010-06-26 19:53:00,2370,"Also... While I don't mean to knock guides. As a camp owner, I would like to see people start tipping the rest of the staff as well as they tip a guide. The waitresses and dockhands work longer hours for less pay. They devote a lot of time and energy ""behind the scenes"" to help your trip be a great one. At an American Plan resort, the cook is often the first one up and the last one to go to bed. He/She has been working for 3 hours by the time the guide even wets a line, and will be working for 2-3 more hours by the time the guide is at home watching TV. The same is true waitresses and dockhands."
1213791,alanexpup,2010-06-26 23:19:00,278,thanks alot. thats all interesting to know and some things to keep in mind that i did not think about the other behind the scenes people. most times the customer only sees a couple of these people. should I give the total tip to the boss or try to spread it out myself? thanks
