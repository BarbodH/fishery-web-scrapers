1212802,tv4fish,2010-06-23 07:27:00,2694,I didn't know that you had gone with MY buddies before
1212803,WalleyeWally28,2010-06-23 07:28:00,298,"The last few years many of the NW Lac Seul resorts have not filled up, especially later in the season. Many of them have been renting cabins to construction workers to try and keep as full as possible. You may be surprised to find how anxious they may be just to get a body in a cabin."
1212827,Fish_on,2010-06-23 08:07:00,1856,"I haven't for quite a few years, but I used to go to Canada alone quite a bit. I went way back into a remote lake and camped on an island. Usually didn't see another person for the entire four days I was there. Great stress relief and a great time to regroup and think. Thinking about it makes me want to do it again. Problem is I have two teenage boys who would kill me if I went without them. Maybe someday I'll do that again."
1212910,cruiseforever,2010-06-23 12:17:00,177,Enjoy your time with them. Soon enough they will be involved with other things and you will once again find that alone time.
1213061,W.W.,2010-06-23 19:05:00,245,"There is no reason you can't do it by yourself if you have the desire to !I've wilderness camped and done the fishing resort/camps by myself; more work by yourself but definately doable.I'd second the LOTW idea out of Morson, I do the Miles Bay area every year for 2 weeks starting the Sat after July 4 ( I'll be going shortly).Try Obabikon, Miles Bay Camp or Grassy Narrows camp all in the general area out from Morson, or you can get a permit and camp out on Crown Land. You can boat out yourself or one of the camps will come to Morson and pick you up; some offer more services than others. I prefer the ""less services"" idea; guess I like to take care of myself.Send me a PM if you want .....W.W. in Iowa"
1213135,Fish_on,2010-06-24 07:08:00,1856,"Cruise forever, I know what you mean. Last year I took most my kids and their spouses up there for a few days. It was a great trip. My oldest son (28) and his wife are now buying a boat so they can go there together and I hope someday they will be taking kids there too. It's a great tradition. I have been going there since 1983! I second the idea of going to Nestor Falls. You can stay at Arrowhead camp where they have kitchenette motel rooms for only about $75/night. You can also fish a couple other lakes besides lake of the woods."
1213155,Bill Krejca,2010-06-24 08:05:00,6107,"I am familiar with Obabikon and Arrowhead, both good places to stay. I also have camped extensively in Sabaskong and Obabikon Lake. Email me if you want more info. Bill Krejca"
1213162,flntknp17,2010-06-24 08:23:00,151,"Thats crazy..........I went to Lac Seul every year at least once from when I was 5 until I was about 25. Now I have a family and I job and a house and it just doesn't happen anymore...........so I was STRONGLY contemplating taking a week after peak tourist season this year and going up there alone now that I ahve upgraded my boat to something that I am confident taking on Lac Seul. I was looking at September on the West end. Our family has stayed at Gold Pines since the 70's. I haven't fished that lake after mid August so if anyone knows anything that might be helpful. I am more of a pike guy than a wallye guy........not sure if the fall pike bite would be as good as the spring........I would guess so, but not certain.Matt"
1213198,phishfearme,2010-06-24 10:59:00,1242,cruise - have you considered joining another group? we've kept our group alive this way - there's lots of fellow fishermen with this unique interest that you'd probably enjoy fishing with as would they - just watch out for guys from cleveland! phish
1212418,cruiseforever,2010-06-22 07:08:00,177,It has been 4 years at least since I have been to Canada. Did not miss a year for 20 years before that. But due to babies and other things my group fell apart. I usually fish Lac Seul. I have now made up my mind if I will go back to Canada alone if I have to. Is there anyone that has done this? Just wondering a lake/resort that would be good for a solo angler? I am shy of going to Lac Seul alone.
1212431,Lenman,2010-06-22 07:28:00,19,"I have never went alone but I'd try a river system that wasn't to wide and they usually have lots of bays, coves and structure. The English River is a good fishery. I believe that there are a few resorts just out of Ear Falls, west of Red Lake Road. Have fun, be safe!"
1212442,81Saluki,2010-06-22 07:47:00,97,"My 1st question is â€¦ why are you reluctant to go back to Lac Seul? On the flip side, what are your preferences?Let us know and we'll probably narrow your choices down to a reasonable number of lakes/resorts to look into."
1212456,2746,2010-06-22 08:28:00,3206,"You might try Gullrock. It's just north a few minutes of NW Lac Seul, an excellent fishery, comparable to LS and a smaller lake that would be much more comfortable to a single fisherman. We stay at Five Lakes Lodge and they have a smaller cabin that accomadates 1 or 2 people. www.fivelakeslodge.comTheir are other good camps on the lake as well. I'm just not familiar with their accomodations."
1212515,Obabikon,2010-06-22 11:10:00,2370,"Lake of the Woods out of Morson is a great area. Close drive. We'd love to have you at Obabikon, and there isn't an extra charge for singles.www.obabikon.com"
1212555,tooski,2010-06-22 12:41:00,393,Cruise- check your PM's....
1212631,hogridnfool,2010-06-22 16:16:00,349,"I've been going alone (sometimes I take my dog along) for thirty years. Beginning of June and again at the end of September. Used to tent camp, but now I use a truck camper. I stay at Gummesons Camp on Mameigwess Lake and fish for Lake Trout and Northerns and take Ripple Creek over to Indian Lake to fish for Lake Trout, Northern, Walleye, Smallmouth and Perch. I love it, no schedules to follow, can sleep in when I want to and I don't have to put up with the snoring and f**ting from a group of guys."
1212641,jaggersr,2010-06-22 17:09:00,44,"I've done Canada solo several times. Although my wife goes with me now. There was a time I would load the truck camper and pull an ATV, canoe on top and spend a week or two in the Chapleau area. You stop when you are tired and move when you want a change of scenery. Some of my most relaxing trips have been alone. However these days my wife is my serious fishing partner and since the invent of the Thermocell I couldn't keep her from going. I say go for it solo if you have to, plan your trip well and don't take unneccesary chances."
1212760,Stu,2010-06-23 00:55:00,472,I sent you a pm
1212792,cruiseforever,2010-06-23 07:00:00,177,I was thinking the resorts there might not be so open to a lone angler as it is the hot place to be. I love the lake and the area. I should call and ask around or what until later in the year. I like to go up in July. As for prefrences: 1- nice fish 2-dry cabin and bed 3-decent resort owner 4- the ability to find out of the wind fishing. Thanks for the info that I have recieved.
