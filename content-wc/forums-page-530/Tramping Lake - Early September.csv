The past three years we have gone to the Flin Flon - Bakker's Narrow area the second week of June and the fishing has been great and most of our luck has been close to shore jigging and trolling. I am just wondering going that late if they would be moved deeper and tougher to locate. I noticed that the Master Angler list for this lake and many other's include entries mainly from June - July. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Sorry I posted this thread in another section, but thought I may have better luck in the Canada goup."

Lakers will still be deeper, mark fish before you start fishing for them. You really cant go wrong with the fishing in that Snow Lake area, there is always a bite of some sort all year long. Have fun. Phone the Lodge at Wekusko falls, they will have the skinny as well. Good reports of the new owners."
