Can anyone tell me what I can expect out of Cliff lake this time of year? Also any hot spots for Musky and Walleye. What kind and color of lure seems to be working this year? I have several bucktails and I make my own jerk baits. I can re-paint them if needed. Always a challange to try a new lake. I would appriciate any advice and help you could give me. Thank You."

1211577,Kevin R,2010-06-19 13:25:00,305,Cliff Lake is a small but nice clear deep lake with a good amount of Musky. Musky can be found anywhere in the lake from just off the bank to deep water they seam to eat what gets in there path. I think they have a lot of Musky 35-45 inches but other sizes are rare. Loaded with Bass & good amount of Walleye & Lake Trout. Pike were rare back in the 1970's & 1980's but over the last twenty years have been common catches. The clearwater can make for tough fishing many say its fished out but not true I always do good on Cliff.
1211603,Obabikon,2010-06-19 16:28:00,2370,I miss Rose and John... they are classy people and were a pleasure to know. The absolutely loved the lake.
1211640,Glenman12,2010-06-19 20:45:00,762,I feel sorry for Rose and John...they were so into making their lodge work...She was on here about 6 months ago..I hope things change for them and they get another chance...
1211701,Kevin R,2010-06-20 07:35:00,305,John Should be at the Camp working on the Cabins for the owner just as he did last summer but don't think Rose will be at Camp.
1212155,Silverwiskers,2010-06-21 14:49:00,5,"I am going to Cliff Lake the first week in Aug. The wife and I have been going there off and on sence the early 90's. This will be the forth owner of the lodge we have dealings with. Have not been there in 5 years, so we are looking foward to what changes have been made. Have always found the fishing better on the lower lakes ( Evening and Mystery). We catch Musky as a by catch while going after Walleye. The biggest was a 44"", with most around 34 - 36"". Will post again when we get back."
1213353,Brian884,2010-06-24 21:31:00,8,Thank You all for the information. I will be anxious to hear from you when you get back silverwiskers. We are all excited and ready to go. Does anyone know where I could get a detailed map of Cliff Lake. It's not on the navionics chip for the GPS unit and talking with Cabelas the new versions don't have it on them either. I would be fine with a detailed paper map but finding one has been difficult. Thanks again for the help.Brian
