1213348,badgerboy7,2010-06-24 21:04:00,187,Anyone have any info or experiences regarding Slate Lake of the Wenasaga Outposts. I'm heading up there in August with a group of six.
1213369,teddi,2010-06-25 04:40:00,349,in august you can expect poor fishing. slate is good early in the year but it drops off as the weather and water warm up.
