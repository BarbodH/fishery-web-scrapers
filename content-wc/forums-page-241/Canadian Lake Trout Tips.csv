4578433,Guest,2016-02-24 13:55:00,0,Going to Canada this early June and wondered if anyone has any tips for catching lake trout. We will mostly be fishing walleye and pike but since the lake has lakers we thought we'd give it a try. I've heard of jigging with large white twister tail grubs but that doesn't seem like a good search plan in a large lake. I thought about trolling three ways with spoons and wonder if there is a particular color these fish prefer. Any help would be appreciated along with any other suggested. Thank You

It doed help to know sme known spots that are goo every year rather than aimlessly go all over he lakes shoreline and get dissapointed. You will need to have some patience or you will be back to walleye and pike in a hurry.good luck.

You'll know how deep your lure/weights are when you hit bottom [yes, obvious I know!]. Why I mention that is it's a good way to figure out where your lure is running with the weight you put on [and distance our line is out]. Just drive over some areas at 40 to 60 FOW etc.. A line counter can help. I just use a clip on one since I don't troll for Lakers more than handful of times a year.My favorite Lure is a Lucky Strike Half Wave spoon in nickel, but there are a ton of spoons that will work - Williams Wabler, Daredvle, Len T Five of Diamonds, Sutton Spoon...... A Floating Rapala, regular or jointed, F11 or F13 is great too."

Lake trout will follow the baitfish (normally cisco in northern lakes). Fishfinder is a must. Spoon with silver and blue (Luhr Jensen Krocodile is my favorite) or crankbait with those same colors that can dive 15-20 ft should be good too. When bite is slow, try trolling with a large spoon (e.g Wobbler) followed 18 inch with a worm. Good luck."
4607129,UKBDM,2016-03-04 06:49:00,178,We have been using Dipsey's set for 40-45' in 65-75' of water. 40# braid to the Dipsey w/ snubber and 20# flouro 4-5' long to silver/blue or silver/green Krocodile or Flutter Laker Taker spoons. We are by no means experts but usually catch a couple every time we try for them. 4-6 over the course of a week.

Drop to the bottom and jerk up follow it back down, repeat. Then after 2 jerks and letting it fall the next jerk just reel up the line and start over. I have normally had the hits on the drop so be sure to have a tight line."
4608137,packpro,2016-03-04 11:54:00,695,"My group goes first full week of June. Sometimes the LT are high in the water column, but usually they find a hole a that is 45'-60' deep. That spot is about 20 minutes from camp. We hit that area right after dinner. They will turn on for about 30-45 minutes as the sun starts to set. Always take a buoy marker. Once you get a hit. throw the marker and work that depth. We generally find them in close proximity to each other, once the feed starts. This is not a subtle jig. We are moving the Jig 2-5 ft. Let it smack the bottom. That is a great attractant. Years ago we has luck with a silver Strata (hammertone) spoon. In the last 8 years a large white jig tipped with a 6"" twister tail plus two dead minnows, has been the hot ticket. Tried to freeze the LT and take them home, they never taste good that way. When we eat them fresh for shore lunch the next day they are fantastic."
