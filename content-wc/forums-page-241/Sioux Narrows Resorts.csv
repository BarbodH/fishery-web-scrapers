I was looking at Crawford's Resort for this area. It looks nice and reasonably priced. The Totem and Tomahawk Resorts look nice, but are too expensive for my taste, so I've crossed those out. I figure Sioux narrows is close enough that the wife can go to Kenora if/when she gets bored. I also looked at Mackenzie Lodge by Kenora, just because it is close to town for the wife, but not sure how the fishing is in that area of LOTW. I'm a musky guy, but I would want action for all species for the girls. Lots of Pike/smallies etc... Thanks for any help!"
4587105,camp chef,2016-02-27 07:33:00,915,"Take a look at Big North Lodge in Minaki. Everything you are looking for and a 30 minute drive to Kenora. I have been there 5 or 6 times. Affordable, great cabins. Really nice people great fishing with world class Muskies."
4587217,elkman99,2016-02-27 07:57:00,180,I have actually talked to those folks at an outdoors show before. I forgot all about it. It looks really nice and really nice folks. I'll add them to the list as possibilities for sure! I figure Kenora adds a lot more shopping opportunities than areas like Perrault Falls/Ear Falls/Dryden (areas I usually fish).
4587281,bellbuoy,2016-02-27 08:16:00,490,There is an RV Park/Houseboat rental just north of Sioux Narrows that has a couple of cabins. http://www.laughingwaterpark.com You might send them an email.
4587313,Downrigger,2016-02-27 08:22:00,60,"I 2nd Minaki, but recommend Paradise Cove Resorts. Extremely favorable rates and well kept facilities. Am going there this summer -1st. time there. Duane - owner - very accommodating. Web site under Paradise Cove Resorts. PM me if you would like additional Info. Phil"
4587705,camp chef,2016-02-27 11:19:00,915,Let me know if you want more info....This is one of my favorite places to fish.........Far enough out of Minaki to avoid the crowds.Pm me for more info. I will give my phone # if you like
4596745,downriverbob,2016-03-01 08:26:00,880,"Another consideration going a little more to the north you will not have to fish in Whitefish Bay, which is gin clear and probably the toughest area to fish in LOTW. You go farther north you will get into some stain waters. I do fish out of Sanctuary Resort in the middle of Whitefish Bay, very hard body of water to fish, low numbers, can have a lot of no fish days. BOB"
4598761,Jesse-WI,2016-03-01 18:36:00,534,We went here once many many years ago and never went back as our cabin had an old log cabin extension that needed chinking work. Think lots of blood sucking mosquitoes at night since the bugs could see light from outside. Perhaps the cabins have been upgraded. I could not find inside photos of the cottages on their web page. It was the year where during the July 4th week we had both 30 and 90 degree weather in the same week.
4599081,Rides,2016-03-01 20:17:00,3,Have a look at indianhead lodge in sioux narrows as well. Smaller family run camp located in snake bay. If you have any questions regarding the area feel free to send me a msg.
