4569577,yoopertrout,2016-02-21 20:23:00,1172,"My wife and I did our first fly-in just a little north of there with Kabeelo Outfitters, two years ago. We're going again this summer. They have over a dozen lakes to choose from The have the operation down pat. The lake that we fished - Dead Dog, was very good fishing. We got about 10 walleyes over 26"", and lots more just under that. Plenty of eaters under 18"", although the average was over that. They supply all food (except snacks, drinks and breakfast cereal (if you don't want hot breakfasts), which makes it very simple. Or you can choose a bring your own food plan. The lake we went on was small enough to learn quickly (about 1000 acres.) The have camps on bigger lakes too."
4570369,BornToFish,2016-02-22 08:16:00,1224,"Greetings, I have about fifty weeks on Perrault Lake. Obviously, I think it's a great lake. There are other boats, but it's a big enough lake to swallow them up. ""Pressure"" isn't a concern for me. I don't have a problem finding a good place to fish. There are four lodges named above, that all offer housekeeping plans. Manotak is the only lodge offering American Plan. Send me a PM if you opt to go with Perrault Lake, as I will make some information available to you about the lake. It's approaching the ""late"" time of the show/expo season to be booking a stay at your lake/lodge of choice. Don't take too long or you may not find a cabin available for your time of the season. Good fishing and tight lines!! Make some great memories."
4587681,Timber Edge,2016-02-27 11:10:00,8,"Huskerbuck, I know its not the area you were looking at but we just had a cancellation for June 18-25, were on Butterfly/Minitaki Lake 12 miles south of Sioux Lookout if you are interested check us out at timberedgecamps.com or you can call me 651-764-0677 and I truly wish the best trip to you and your son wherever you go!!"
4589433,shortmag,2016-02-28 04:44:00,70,"You would not be disappointed in Peffley's. Wabaskang is an easy lake to fish, no crowding, and lots of fish. We are average anglers and can catch fish at mid day it is that good. The staff is friendly, accommodating, and will put you on fish. They have nice boats and bait available."
4596201,bigcreekdad,2016-03-01 06:20:00,74,"You might also consider Fireside Lodge on Little Vermillion Lake. Excellent cabins, boats, and food. And...the fishing is very good. My dad took me to the French River in 1966 as my HS graduation gift. Since then, I've only missed one year not going to Ontario somewhere. 50 years later, I'm back on the French, and have 3 trips scheduled.My 2 sons usually join me on at least one trip. I started taking my oldest when he was 9....cannot beat the experience and the memories. Have fun!!"
4597537,billy weaver,2016-03-01 12:21:00,470,I have been going to Peffleys for many years. I have been to other camps and finally settled on Peffley's camp. I would recommend this camp and Wabaskang Lake. I go in early June and have been there in August. Go to his web-site and facebook pages for a overview. This year will be my 30th trip to this camp.
4608665,Guest,2016-03-04 16:15:00,0,"Look at Kesagami Lodge. WARNING price is up there. Fishing is outstanding. (like you haven't heard that before) But; consider this as to why. You MUST use barbless hooks. And only one single J hook on a lure -NO TREBLES. ALL pike go back into the water; why 4 of us all had pike over 40"". I was fortunate enough to go there as I promoted barbless hooks and ended up there with film crew filming for Outdoor Channel...and I am a nobody farmer. The walleye were great too. At first the all boats off the water before dark was a sacrilegious blow to me. But; well you do not need to fish till after sundown. I would not try to go there for 3 days over somewhere else for 5-7 days. Weather can torpedo the best laid plans."
4609121,HeHooksHimself,2016-03-04 19:05:00,725,"I thought long and hard if I should throw in my recommendation since I usually don't do much recommending, but your original post mentions water near my favorite place, Wine Lake Camp. You must pick up your boat just up from Dutchie's and take it across Wabaskang and portage it over Cedar Falls, motor up the Cedar River to Wine Lake Camp, the only camp on a system of five different lakes with day trips to another 4, including Anishinabi. I have been fishing this system regularly for 15 years. Our groups regularly catch large lakers up to 40"", pike over 40"", walleyes in the high 20's, smallies up to 20' and as many perch as you want. You might even catch a whitefish over 20"" or a burbot. No electricity but the cabins are borderline luxurious. Usually there are about 12 boats in camp, so you can always find a place to yourself. Occasionally boats from Wabaskang camps come over the falls, but generally the experience is similar to a fly in and the fishing is great. Some don't like having to use outhouses, but we like it. there is a shower house as well. But the best thing is the fishing. You will catch more fish by accident at WLC than you catch at many places working for them. Wherever you go, you will have a great time. The video of our 2012 trip is posted on the recipes page of the Wine Lake Camp website: http://winelakecamp.com/recipes_fishtips.html You should check out the website and see what you think!"
4609977,pete kraft,2016-03-05 07:41:00,28,"My son and I have been to Keeper River Outpost with Chimo Outfitters two times, two years apart. Peter has always been good about it just being the two of us. Keeper has an easily accessible portage lake that is also good fishing. They fly out of Red Lake, not much farther than the area that you are looking at. The lakes are small enough for a first timer, but large enough to explore for a week. They are the only camp on the lake."
4568345,Huskerbuck,2016-02-21 14:41:00,2,"The wife has given the OK to take my son on a Canadian fishing trip for his college graduation. Im wanting to take him to the Perrault Falls area as I have been there before. I have been looking at Rainbow Point Lodge and Peffleys Camp. Both of these have been recommended by friends who have been there. Was doing some research and was wonering what some of you more experienced guys think. Seems Perrault might get alot to pressure? Does anyone have any other sugestions or advice om maybe another place to look at. A few years ago I fished Cedar. I'm not going to say I didn't have a good time because I did. Its just that there was a group of ""high rollers"" in camp and I feel we go lost in the shuffle. Avid fisherman would not even brgin to describe my son so he is pretty excited that mom gave th go ahead. We are looking at mid to late June. Any advice or experience anyone would like to share on Rainbow Point, Peffleys, Perrault Lake, Wabaskang Lake or anywhere else in the area would be appriciated. Where would you take your son? Thanks"
4568369,adempsey,2016-02-21 14:50:00,963,"Have you considered a fly-in lodge or outpost camp? I think flying into a remote location in the middle of nowhere is an incredibly special experience. Of course, every fishing trip I've had with my father has always been special no matter the destination."
4568385,That Minnesota guy,2016-02-21 14:56:00,8293,A friend of mines daughter was given a fly in for high school graduation. She got to fish with her dad and grandfather and also experience her first flight in a bush plane. Those are memories that will be passed onto her kids. Wherever you go you will have the memories forever.
4568657,Carnhzkr,2016-02-21 16:08:00,964,"I'm sure you'll have a wonderful time and create lasting memories. Most years, I take three trips to Canada; one with my family of four, one with my youngest son, and one with my parents. I hope my wife doesn't read this, but by far my favorite of those three is the trip with just my youngest son and me. He's pretty much a clone of me and we both share the same passion. When I first read your post, I wasn't sure what you meant when you said, ""avid fisherman does not begin to describe your son"". You can take that two ways, but I assume you mean he loves to fish. If I said ""good looking doesn't begin to describe my wife"", I'm not sure if I'd get slapped or kissed. I've never fished Perrault or Cedar, so I can't give a first-hand recommendation on either of those. If you go about five miles further north, you'll drive past the turnoffs to Onaway and Fisherman's Cove, then Lac Seul Lodge after that. They're all on Lac Seul. Go another 10 miles to Ear Falls and there are a dozen or so lodges in that area of the big lake. Any of these would be my recommendation. I know that Rainbow Point is relatively inexpensive compared to most of the lodges on LS, so that may be a consideration. LS has the deserved reputation as the premiere walleye fishery in Ontario. I've fished all over Manitoba and most of Ontario and I can say it's the best lake I know for the combination of quality and quantity. That being the case, it's not necessarily my favorite lake to fish. That's because it is such a huge body of water and I tend to spend a lot of time motoring between fishing spots. Also, it's such a popular fishery some of the most popular spots can get fairly crowded, and when I go to Canada I at least like the allusion that I'm in the wilderness. One thing I can tell you is that the time frame you mentioned is considered prime season, so most of the lodges I mentioned on LS will surely be filled, but you never know. People do cancel, so you could get lucky. I wouldn't be surprised if you could find a vacancy at one of the lodges around the Ear Falls area, though. Several people have suggested a fly-in to an outpost, and I agree that's a wonderful experience. Be aware, though, that most fly-in outposts have a minimum party, especially in June. Some will fly in two people, but charge a premium. There are some that will fly in just two, but you have to search a little harder. My biggest recommendation is to get serious about your research soon and get something booked because spring is trying hard to get here. It's much easier to find openings in July or August."
4568777,ftfarms,2016-02-21 16:42:00,444,Here is my input. I've fished cedar Perreault and Wabaskang. Cedar in my mind is the better lake of the three. I do like gawleys parkview camp on Wabaskang. Brevin and Afton are my favorite of all camp owners that I've been too. I think peffleys is a little over priced but I've heard nothing bad about them or there camp. I've had some friend stay at rainbow and thay loved it. I've had some great smallmouth fishing on Perreault lake and decent walleye fishing. Walleye fishing on Lac suel is better than most but most camps on Lac suel are pricey. We started fishing lake of the woods out of morson ontario. way shorter drive and as good as fishing as any for smallmouth and walleye and crappie and musky and pike it's just a great multi specie lake. Good luck on your serch
4568881,port1042,2016-02-21 17:06:00,509,"I've only fished Perrault Lake. I liked it well enough that I'll make my 8th trip there in 4 years this spring. I have heard nothing but good things about all 4 of the lodges on Perrault (Perrault Lake Camp, Rainbow, Rocky Shores, and Manotak). Rocky Shores and Manotak are a little more centrally located but it doesn't make too much difference. The lake is large enough but not overwhelming. I've never felt there was too much fishing pressure. The walleye, northern, and smallmouth fishing is very good. Jumbo perch are the icing on the cake. I don't fish musky but I caught 2 last fall. Not big ones but the only 2 I've ever caught. Personally, I'm a fan of Manotak but it's the only place I've stayed. You'll want to get an ""upgrade boat"" no matter what lodge your at. You're going to spend a lot of time in it and you want to be as comfortable as possible. Manotak offers both an American Plan and a Housekeeping Plan. Personally I prefer the housekeeping plan because it allows me to be on my own schedule. However, the one time I did the American Plan the food was terrific. If you choose Perrault PM me and I'll share some details."
4569065,Walleye will,2016-02-21 18:11:00,218,I haven't found gawleys parkview online. Wondering if they have a website?
4569305,ftfarms,2016-02-21 19:14:00,444,Sorry I emailed them and there Web site is down. Here's there email. [email protected] and phone is 807 529 3147.
4569361,adempsey,2016-02-21 19:20:00,963,They have a Facebook page if you want to look at photos etc..https://www.facebook.com/Gawleys-Par...7771159299525/
4569521,JesterBreeze,2016-02-21 20:05:00,16,I have to agree with Carnhzkr - head on up to Lac Seul. We go to Fisherman's Cove and have always had a great time and have caught really nice fish every year.
