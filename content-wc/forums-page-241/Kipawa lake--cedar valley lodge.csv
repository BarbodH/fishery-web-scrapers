My son (12 at the time) aren't seasoned walleye fishermen but did okay...we were there in early August and fish were not predictable. Still, this is not a walleye haven...can be fair, might be good but seldom great from the research I did. I would suggest that 15 fish days would beery good for this lake. I was disappointed in the pike fishing but likely targeted too shallow of water at that time of year. Caught a few nice lake trout. Two things I would add other than prices were excellent, especially with kids. 1. This lake is a series of very long bays...kind of looks like a spider on a map. Islands and penninsulas are abundant...the place is downright beautiful, at least in the eastern portions we explored. Unlike most other areas I have been to. 2. You are welcome to bring your own boat which is recommended as a bigger boat than the rentals are needed to really explore...not necessary to access lots of fishing but to really see more of the lake. BUT...do not trailer your boat directly to the camp. They have parking on west side of lake...a map and gps will get you there. The road into the camp is BRUTAL for trailers get. Also it will save likely 2 hours of driving. Last tidbit, this part of Canada is known to produce some ""blue"" walleye. We caught one which was pretty cool. Sorry, no experience to compare with gullrock."

Spend my time around the bottom end of MacKenzie and over into Hunter. Some do real good there and others not so good. Check out the Kipawa forum, lots of Guys on there willing to answer questions."
