4587353,Fisherman Ted,2016-02-27 08:30:00,461,My work truck bought in Canada works in Canada and then for the 6 months in the States when I am off not a problem at all. GPS is GPS.

4588305,Skywagon,2016-02-27 16:36:00,1106,"Pooch,I consolidated my part of the fleet. I did buy a new F150 in August, sold my old V10-F250 and 2008 Ridgeline afterword's, the 2014 Honda Ridgeline is the better half's truck. The 2014 Honda GPS program works in Kenora and Winnipeg (nowhere else she travels). I called Honda International about getting the Canada chip (or whatever is necessary) and they said if want all of Canada I would need to buy a whole new screen-unit for Canada (so far my only complaint with the Honda's). When the 2017 Ridgeline comes out, we will solve that problem."
4588353,Blue Lk,2016-02-27 16:42:00,269,"If you you send me $100.00 US I will have V-Bay Gord email you the ""special"" Canadian password to unlock your GPS"
4589545,Skywagon,2016-02-28 05:58:00,1106,"Thanks Blue LK, but I think it would be more economic on my part to cut out the middle man. I have already memorized the salt laden trail (Trans Canada) from my tee pee to Dryden, it will just be a matter of pulling out the old paper map to figure out how to get from Dryden to V Bay. I hear Gord works cheap, so I am betting a bottle of newly aged wine from the LCBO will buy all the information needed at a fraction of the cost you proposed."
4593625,Frankm,2016-02-29 09:38:00,154,"Those little piles of rock are called ""Inukshuk"". https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuksuk"
4595401,fishpoop,2016-02-29 19:26:00,630,"Those piles of rocks are called, Inuksuk. The inuksuk may have been used for navigation, as a point of reference, a marker for travel routes, fishing places, camps, hunting grounds, places of veneration, drift fences used in hunting [4] or to mark a food cache. The word means, so I am told, ""In The Likeness Of Man."" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuksuk Think of it as early version of G.P.S."

4616009,SILVER MINNOW BAIT SHOP,2016-03-07 12:09:00,18,You should have no problem with your GPS up here in Canada. I live in Thunder Bay and frequent the states often with no issues using my gps in my 2015 F150. Josh
4579513,Ranger319,2016-02-24 19:20:00,166,Does a vehicle's built in navigation work up in Canada? Trying to decide if I need to buy a new portable gps or not. Still might get one just in case.
4579529,bigwalleye1,2016-02-24 19:25:00,2632,I don't know why it wouldn't. They sell such trucks to Canadians on a regular basis....
4579689,eyemike,2016-02-24 19:57:00,233,I have 2012 F150 with navigation and have no issues in Ontario.
4579745,Ndstallmann,2016-02-24 20:15:00,549,"Our 2013 Toyata doesn't have maps once we cross the border, one has to buy them extra."
4580193,Skywagon,2016-02-25 04:26:00,1106,"We bought a 2014 Honda Ridgeline truck new from the US, the navigation works from Kenora on west to Winnipeg, but does not work from, Kenora on east to (at least) Thunder Bay. So Ft Frances, Dryden, Red Lake, Sioux Lookout, Thunder Bay are all blank on the screen."
4580337,forgop,2016-02-25 06:12:00,880,My GMC Terrain worked fine in Ontario up to Wawa.
4580345,jfaisten,2016-02-25 06:17:00,1060,same here on the F150 -- 2015 model -- no issues in Canada
4580473,v-bay gord,2016-02-25 06:54:00,3168,.......just follow the piles of rock on the side of the road......
4586721,ftfarms,2016-02-27 04:33:00,444,So that's what those pike of rocks are. There a navigational beacon. I've wondered about those for years.
4587265,Pooch,2016-02-27 08:14:00,4619,"Thought you bought a new truck?That seems strange the the Honda coverage stops for several hundred miles. TB is such a large metropolitan area you'd think it would be there, too. I suppose you have to buy a different chip for it? Not unlike my Miller TIG that I had to order a chip to get a higher than 100 cps for more welding options on AC aluminum. It probably costs about a few penny's per unit to have that pre-programmed in. Instead they can charge $180 bucks for the ""update"". $$$$....Pooch"
