With a normal ice out we find them stacked up at the mouth of the river where it dumps into the lake system. This is easy, fast action fishing. But the ice often goes early and the walleyes spread out into the lake. I know where I go to find them, but I'm curious where the ol' pros would go to look for walleyes that had recently dispersed into a lake system. Where would you look first??? Thanks!"

Generally speaking, the walleyes follow shorelines away from the spawning areas (e.g. rivers). These fish seem to be on the move, following warming water and baitfish. The depth of water holding walleyes can be quite shallow. With this in mind, the walleyes often hang-up in localized areas that capture warm water, be it wind driven surface water or water warmed by the sun. These patterns seem to hold pretty solid, so long as the trend in water temperatures remains stable. I have seen situations where massive cold fronts cause the trend in water temperature to abruptly reverse. The water temperature dropped several degrees overnight. In such situations, I look much deeper for the walleyes, very near where they use to be before the cold front. I believe the walleyes were searching for stability in water temperature, even though it's colder water. I recall one situation where I caught walleyes shallow one afternoon, and found them in nearby 20+ fow of water the next morning. They return shallow when the water begins warming. As the water continues to warm, the walleyes typically move deeper along the shorelines, for example in search of emerging weeds. Eventually this shoreline water becomes too warm, and the walleyes move to nearby off-shore structure such as rock humps, reefs and the like. Typically, walleyes finish their spawn and return to the lake that I fish. I have seen early seasons where the water in the river stays fairly cool. I found that a good population of walleyes stay in the river's holes well into June. These fish were mostly ""eaters"", rather than ""trophy"" fish. I hope the above patterns are helpful. Good fishing and tight lines!!"

This would be after no success where I used to get them a little earlier in the season, like second week after opening, maybe. It really depends on what time of year it is, I think, they seem to spread out as the season progresses. Some probably hang close to spawning, most others move others move. Can't everyone eat at the same table. Bill"
4603937,Freytown,2016-03-03 07:28:00,770,"There is lots of research out there explaining how walleye disperse post spawn. IMO, the bigger issue is finding active fish as females need time to re-charge after spawning. And I agree with the first two replies. FT"
4604193,octanehi5,2016-03-03 08:29:00,1104,"I find that walleyes tend to be not far from were they are feeding and what they are feeding on. Wind direction, brightness, structure,all play a roll in how and were to find them.during the light of day they are deeper coming shallow as light starts to fade. Walleye spawn at or around 54* is an optimum temp, Females drop their eggs and move out of the spawning area to feed were the males tend to hang near the spawning areas longer to fertilize more eggs.You will find them just above the thermalcline suspended,Remember shallow bays warm up faster than the rest of the lake.A big wind with a good chop will tend to balance out the water temps.Cold fronts drive fish deep. Trolling around with bottom bouncers with worm harnesses at 24 to 18' of water is a good way to locate were they are,once you find them start drift jig fishing for them."

Those areas provide some of the warmest water. The problem was that eaters were not available which is frustrating when you want delicious walleye fillets. Trolling cranks in the bay directly out from the river mouth held post spawn males and were caught and released into the frying pan."
4605745,P&y only,2016-03-03 16:26:00,133,Thanks Guys! It's always interesting to get other peoples perspectives. I too tend to find them along shallow weed beds working out from the river.
