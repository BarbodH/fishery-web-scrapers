4616065,SILVER MINNOW BAIT SHOP,2016-03-07 12:25:00,18,Camping on Crown land in Ontario is fairly simple. If you have any questions on how to obtain permits or have any questions on some really good lakes to camp/fish at send me a PM or give me a call at 807-632-6572. Id be more then willing to help lead you in the right direction! Josh
4616361,prov1800,2016-03-07 13:55:00,5010,Some of the folks i have taljed to that were camping on crown land told me they had to be a 1/2 mile away from the shoreline and were not allowed to set up near shore.
4616841,515,2016-03-07 15:46:00,254,Not true you can pretty much camp anywhere you want. We do it every fall for a couple of weeks. Only rule is you can't stay on same site for over 21 days.
4617089,v-bay gord,2016-03-07 17:01:00,3168,There's a difference between non resident crown land camping and resident crown land camping.........the rule you mention applies to resident camping. Some lakes do not allow non resident camping on the shoreline.....mostly on lakes with commercial tourism business's.

4297426,Walleye will,2015-11-01 20:04:00,218,Looking for info on crown land camping. From a person who has done it before. Is it on the difficult side?
4298578,Aaron-IN,2015-11-02 14:21:00,500,"I use to do it all the time. Unless the rules have changed it's pretty simple, if you are a non-resident you have to buy a daily camping permit and make sure you aren't camping in an area that prohibits crown land camping. Again, unless something has changed recently if you were a non-resident but owned land in Ontario you didn't even need a permit."
4298666,Bill Krejca,2015-11-02 14:57:00,6107,"I've worn out equipment camping on crown land over the years. I haven't done it for a while, so don't know what has changed. Pretty sure you'll still need a day-by-day indicated permit for every person, and are required to get a conservation license, which about halves the keep limit. The ultimate for me always was opening the tent in the morning and getting to take in the quiet natural beauty, like having my own private world in paradise, and I was the king! Bill"
4299338,Beer King,2015-11-02 21:02:00,146,"My annual trip every year is tent camping. As others have stated, its pretty simple. Each person needs a camping permit for each night you stay (approx $12 per nite). They are not yet computerized so need to make sure you identify a bait/tackle shop that has them on hand - not everyone does. You may be able to purchase them in advance on-line, not sure about that. Also important to verify your location does not have restrictions on camping. I would call MNR and ask. Where we go there are no designated campgrounds, can set up a tent camp anywhere you like. Don't know if that is the case elsewhere - MNR would tell you. As long as they allow camping where you are going, and you get the permits, you are good to go. Dan"
4300042,Golden Eagle,2015-11-03 09:11:00,2642,"50-55 years ago we'd rent a boat for a dollar or two a day, put it on top of our car and camp just about anywhere there was fishable water. We didn't leave trash and never found any left by others.My favorite trips were when we'd head out on a new road. Construction workers beat us to the good spots, but we did okay with their leftovers.Round trip was about 1600 miles. Can't remember spending over $50 each for 7 - 10 days of fishing.Good old days were good old days. For me."
4304458,fsz,2015-11-05 17:17:00,144,"I believe if you rent camping equipment from an Ontario Business the camping fee is waived. Also, as the other posters mentioned there are certain areas you Can't camp including but not limited to ""green zones""."
4311898,Baseline,2015-11-09 19:33:00,3207,"I camp on Crown land every year and over the years have camped in many areas. I'm more familiar with areas of Ontario west of a straight line north of Thunder Bay. Camping is restricted in many areas. Just about every area south of south of Hwy 17 is restricted to US citizens. North of Hwy 17 there a many areas available for campers. Camping permits are sold at bait shops who sell fishing licenses and online are required for each night you camp. I've been checked twice once on a very remote island campsite and again at a game check area. They were $10 per night last summer. The Canadian MNR produces detailed maps of areas camping permitted and restricted areas. All ramps and lake fronts are restricted for camping. If you own property you do not need a permit and can camp anywhere on crown land. Your guest can camp with you, but need permits if they are US citizens. s"
4316570,northernbite,2015-11-12 07:03:00,1186,You now can get camp permits on line. They are eliminating the ability to buy from a bait or license location . Paul
4317642,Sportdog,2015-11-12 14:49:00,6735,"So how do you know what is, and what isn't crown land? Can you leave your car at boat landings and camp out on the islands or lakeshores? Interesting topic for sure."
4320114,Baseline,2015-11-13 17:23:00,3207,There are maps available from the Ontario MNR that outline all the regulated areas. There are also signs posted at landing and along some roadways about camping and other restrictions. You can also stop at the tourist center located most high volume border crossings where information can be obtained. There is one at Pigeon River and International Falls.
