4521841,Uticus,2016-02-06 13:16:00,4,"Perfect. I have a small inverter for my car that plugs into a cigarette plug,... I'll either pick up a female plug with clips on it, or just another small inverter to use. Thanks"
4586929,octanehi5,2016-02-27 06:39:00,1104,"With clips for jumpers you can power up almost anything,small inverter, Try to use acid batteries as they last longer, Bring spare batts to use while the others are charging,Good dry batteries work very well also, A gps is in order once you locate fish, you will not need the fish finder on. When drift fishing your not going to see the fish you are catching. Bring an extra 50'of rope for anchor,Drift sock to slow the boat Maintaining contact with bottom is key. Many times I have been drift fishing with boats around me ,there not catching them and i'm pulling them in whole sale.Fishron looking forward to having a few shore lunches with you guys, I did locate some cajun spiced beer batter.Fishing Hebert will make you a better walleye fisherman,They can be caught any time of day,and you do not need to be on the lake at the crack of dawn.In our camp we get up around 6am coffee is the first order of the day,along with a visit to the outhouse,with everyone mulling around getting ready to go out.we come back to camp about 10 to 11 am with a limit in hand,Make breakfast,head back out, We like to catch dinner early around 5-530 pm, You want to be out on the lake by 630 to 9pm Best bite of the day,you will double what you caught during the day.Its not uncommon to have two guys in a boat catch 100+ walleyes in the evening.On Hebert the question is not are you going to catch walleye its How Many."
4596209,MikeG1,2016-03-01 06:21:00,434,You guys sure know how to make a guy anxious. It's only March 1 and I've never been sooo prepared for a July 1 trip. Thanks for all the assistance and encouragement.
4599873,octanehi5,2016-03-02 07:32:00,1104,"I have been fishing this lake for more than 15 yrs. I do not know anyone one that has been to this lake that does not get charged up, including me. when we start talking about this lake. I know more that 20 guys that have caught their personal best walleyes & Pike in numbers and size. Elaine &Jean always put Money back into their operation,Making it one of the best if not the best in Quebec. I'm already compiling a my list of fishermen for 2017.Contact me if interested."
4606169,Matrix04,2016-03-03 19:02:00,13,"Will be my first time at Lake Hebert - 1st week of July. Just can't wait! My expectations are now over the roof with all the posts I read here about this place! In fact, the week will be split in two with 3 days at Plamondon-Gouin, followed by 4 days in Hebert. Any tips on fishing Plamondon area would be welcomed!"
4609665,octanehi5,2016-03-05 05:48:00,1104,the water levels change alot in a given yr. fish narrow neck down areas with water moving through.structure and wind direction is key
4610057,Guest,2016-03-05 08:08:00,0,"Hi Octane, I'm going to Hebert the 1st week in June this year. What areas would you recommend we concentrate on. This will be our first trip to this lake. I was thinking the large creek on the west side of the lake would be a good area to start. We are staying on the Island in camp 22. I know you predominately fish the norther section of the lake but being earlier in the year, I wasn't sure if the fish would be closer to the mouths of creeks and shore lines. Any ideas would certainly be appreciated! I will post a detailed report when we get back. Scott"
4611961,octanehi5,2016-03-06 06:23:00,1104,"If we look at the mild winter they had,It will be an early ice out,Meaning an early spawn most likely late april or early may. 90% of those fish will not be in the mouth of the river In June. The drop off right behind the island is good, with a south wind fish just south of the island, Ask daniel about Clorox Island aways good. With the early ice out the walleyes will be everywere on that lake. cold fronts put walleye deep,the Weather will be a big factor,Ideally you want a good chop on the water,every day,its a much better bite.than with bluebird sky.You will find the ruffer the weather the better the bite.good luck"
4511977,Andre (wallyandre),2016-02-03 14:46:00,2274,I'm going back to lake Hebert at the end of August!
4512657,NY Walleye,2016-02-03 17:46:00,78,Going back myself the last week of June first week of July. Love that place! You know it's that good when you dream about returning for 11 months 3 weeks.
4512705,Uticus,2016-02-03 17:52:00,4,"I'm making my first trip up there at the end of August, is there anything I should know lure or bait wise? One thing I meant to ask but forgot about on the phone with them is if there is any way to charge a portable fishfinder. I know everything is propane there, but are the boats electric start so you could parallel it with the boats battery?"
4514361,fishron,2016-02-04 08:07:00,317,"In late June we will make our third trip into Hebert. We stay at the main island camp where there is a fulltime caretaker. Air Tamarac has installed several solar panels that provide lighting for the fish cleaning stations. We have used the one near the caretakers cabin to charge our radios. I would think you could also charge a fishfinder battery. The one I use runs on D cells and lasts longer than a week. For walleye we fish almost exclusively quarter to half ounce jigs. We use nightcrawlers to tip them but salted minnows, leaches or even plastics would work. For pike I throw paddeltail plastics or other single hook large lures. The larger walleye will occasionally nail one of those also. There are hydrographic maps of the lake now available. I will be speaking with Air Tam on Monday at the Harrisburg Sports Show. I'm hoping that they will include the new maps with their package. Octanehi5 is a great source of info for Hebert and always willing to share. He may show up on this post and give further input. I'll be working on some special walleye recipes to share with his group in June. Have a great trip!!"
4515489,Uticus,2016-02-04 15:00:00,4,"Thanks for the info, I'm sure it will be a great trip, its my groups first fly in trip, and my first time catching a walleye (hopefully). Went to the french river a couple years ago, but didn't have any luck there. Bass ad Pike sure, but no walleye.I know I can rig up D-Cells, a couple 6V batteries in series, or just take a 12V emergency light battery as a second battery. I'm not sure how long the fishfinder will last on a single charge, so its something to figure out before we get up there. Right now I'm just considering options as I expect the battery will last 3 maybe 4 days of fishing."
4515513,Andre (wallyandre),2016-02-04 15:14:00,2274,The camp keeper got a little Honda generator but you need to bring you're charger because it takes too long with only the Honda. The other thing is to talk with Jean or Eliane and they will do wathever it takes to make you're trip a success.
4516025,MikeG1,2016-02-04 17:17:00,434,"I'll be visiting the first week of July. It will be my first fly-in and my first trip to Hebert. I've been to many drive in lakes but this is a bucket list trip for me. We are staying in cabin 26 on the north end. I've been in touch with NY Walleye and Octanehi5 and they have been extremely helpful. My biggest challenge will be making weight...or even just getting close, but we'll make it. Thanks to NY Walleye and Octanehi5, and all others on this board, for the information they provide. Good fishing."
4518057,octanehi5,2016-02-05 09:06:00,1104,"Mike I will meet you as we leave on the 7/3/16 on camp 26 dock. The lake should have an early ice out this yr. making the end of june and first weeks of july some of the best fishing you can have on the lake. Last yr I had a few newbe's with me On there first day out they posted the heavest fish for last yr. 31""11lb. That a big fish for this lake we also caught a few 8's 7's and on down. Last yr on the lake in general there were more big fish caught than any other yr. I suggest anyone fishing this lake to keep a camera in the boat, The slot limit on hebert of 14""-20"" of fish to eat has really made the population of big fish grow. I'll give you guys something to shoot for two yrs, ago my 6 guys caught 2250 walleyes in 7 days,My personal best in a week is 900, Most yrs its averages around 450 to 500 in over 12yrs. fishing this lake"

4520081,NY Walleye,2016-02-05 20:50:00,78,"Uticas, Last year I brought a small inverter that has alligator clips. I attached the clips to the batteries in the fish house and plugged direct into the inverter. I was able to charge just about anything. Also, brought a small solar panel with satellite phone."
