Early ice out doesn't treat me well where I go in May. So, I guess I'm asking if you got the normal thickness and is it still solidly in place or are things warming early up there too??? Thanks in advance!"
4595201,P&y only,2016-02-29 17:59:00,133,I see now that this has been asked already. Oops!

Tomorrow I'm headed to the Manitou north of I-Falls. Report from there was 24 inches of clear ice and snow covered. I'd say there is at least 3 to 4 weeks of ice season left, but of course that depends on the thermometer. If you need to get in some ice time I'd get up here ASAP."

4598369,Guest,2016-03-01 16:44:00,0,Thin! Very Thin! The ice thickness is about half of what is normally there. We might be out in the boat fishing the open water in April before the walleye season closes for spawning.

Very hard crust made for good riding.Stopped on one spot and stepped of my sled and had nothing but slush so wecwent to spot number 2.That was a good choice as it was hard as a rock.-31 this morning, and a nasty ssw wind that wasnt in the forecast.Drilled a bunch of holes and measured one at 15""been likecthatvall year, not gaining any and not loosing any either.going to have somecwarm weather voming this weekend so uam ecpecting some surface melt which will lead to a bunch slush.it is what it is, justplay the game.my favourite game.caught a few today but genarally kind of a slow day.but mostly the two of us sat inside side by side so we did pretty good for the area we fished."
4599393,Hidden Bay Lodge,2016-03-01 23:39:00,12,A few of our staff went out to check the conditions. We're fairly certain Opening Weekend will have no ice issues.
