4598913,wallijig,2016-03-01 19:19:00,426,Friend of mine is planning a trip there this spring. He has heard great things and asked me to ask What should he expect and any tips?
4599561,Shellback,2016-03-02 05:43:00,8083,"Here's a forum for Quinte. http://forum2.quintefishing.com/index.php It's my understanding they stack up there in the late fall to spawn. Once the spawn is over, the majority are outta there. I've been there in June a couple times and it was nothing to write home about. JMHO"
4599585,iBigmacius,2016-03-02 05:47:00,334,Spring fishing can be good but not usually Giants. Avg I'd say is around 2-5lb depending when they come. Our large fish are migratory and leave as soon as the spawn is done and go into Lake Ontario. It's looking an earlier spawn this year due to less ice and warmer temps so I expect most big fish will be back in the big lake by the opener. Feel free to pm me if you want

June fishing is tough also. There aren't many big fish caught after the opener, they're there and they are wary, that's why they're big. Once the water is over 50 degs F, the use of spinners and worms is the usual method. Lotsa Luck if you decide to venture to Quinte, The best info I can give is to get a guide for a day or two and see what & where you fish."
4603697,wallijig,2016-03-03 06:44:00,426,He now is in contact with baitshop up there. Now looking late fall trip after info saw on this and other sites I asked for info from. Thanks all for you input.

I've caught a few 30"" fish on these trips. I have always used Fish finder Charters (Dave Chatterton) he has an awesome package he puts together. You stay at his house and he provides all meals from breakfast to dinner.http://www.fishfindercharters.com/ The past few years has been really slow for my trips but the weather conditions were not in my favor."

4609065,bellbuoy,2016-03-04 18:39:00,490,There was a guy whose Screen name was superdad who posted on WC fishing conditions on quinte. Maybe he's just on the quinte fishing site now.
