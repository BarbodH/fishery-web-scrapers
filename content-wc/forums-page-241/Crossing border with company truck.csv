4605441,Coyoteman,2016-03-03 15:01:00,209,I only drive a company vehicle. Never been asked about it in the 20 plus times of crossing.
4605593,Hot Runr Guy,2016-03-03 15:48:00,16061,"Are there any salable items on the truck (company product, samples, etc.) If so, remove them before crossing. HRG"
4605793,pikeman14,2016-03-03 16:31:00,144,"We did the same with a company van on our last trip. I remember having a notorized letter from the owner stating that we were borrowing the van, and all his contact info. I don't know if it was something we did on our own or something we were told to do. We were never bothered at the border with any questions about it."
4605977,mudpusher,2016-03-03 18:10:00,248,"I've used mine the last three years. The name on the side is stickers not magnets, so can not be removed. Even has a 100 gal. fuel tank in the bed. No problems."
4606529,ftfarms,2016-03-03 21:11:00,444,Just make sure it has insurance on it that cover canada. We was going to take a friends company truck last year and it wasn't insured for canada and they wouldnt put it on so left it at home.
4606737,roscoe33,2016-03-03 22:46:00,653,"Is it your company that owns the truck? If so, is the company name and your name on the registration?"
4607065,UKBDM,2016-03-04 06:34:00,178,"Coming back into the US, the customs agent very often will ask me if the truck is mine ... I assume trying to trip me up. I always answer ""No, it belongs to the company I work for"". Nothing else is ever said."
4611545,hogridnfool,2016-03-05 21:11:00,349,Make sure that you have a Canada NON-RESIDENT Inter-Province Motor Vehicle Liability Insurance Card. You can get one from your companies auto insurance agent.
