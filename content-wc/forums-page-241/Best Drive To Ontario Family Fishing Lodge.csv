4596265,Bergy,2016-03-01 06:47:00,83,"Looking to bring my family of four and possibly another family of four on our first Canadian fishing experience. My wife and son both like to fish. My daughter could take it or leave it, unless she is catching fish pretty steady. I would like them to have a great first experience. Then we will go back! We live in Minnesota and would bring our own boat (Ranger 1850 Reata). Obviously the closer to home, the better. Things that I consider important: - Good (tar preferred) road to lodge. At least not much gravel road. - Protected Docks - Decent Cabins with full kitchen and running water - Great fishing for Walleye (size and quantity). Bonus to have good fishing for Perch and Crappie - Have gas and/or bait at lodge or close by - Fair rates Thanks for any suggestions"
