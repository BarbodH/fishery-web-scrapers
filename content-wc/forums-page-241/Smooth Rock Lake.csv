I deal with them on a regular basis for bait orders and can only say one thing about them ""Bunch of Beauties!!"" OH....And the fishing is phenomenal up there!!"
4150553,fish007,2015-08-22 11:59:00,120,"We just returned from our 2nd trip to Smooth Rock last night. As usual Debbie and her crew were great and the fishing was fantastic. We caught 2 big pike - a 48 and a 45 incher and hundreds of walleyes . The fish were hanging out in 16 to 24 feet for the most part. I knew the fishing was good when my wife had to take a break for an evening when her arm hurt too much to set the hook anymore. Even with out the excellent fishing the trip would have been great. All we used for bait was 3/8 oz jigs tipped with a leech , crawler or plain twister tail. We didn't bother with minnows. Now it's the long wait 'till next May"
4150793,pjshorthorn,2015-08-22 15:16:00,5654,Sounds like you had a great time. Those northern are beauts. Thanks for posting a report. PjShorthorn.
4151233,fish007,2015-08-22 19:22:00,120,they are fun to catch ! We should have done some serious pike fishing but we were catching enough by accident and it's easy to release them when caught on a jig. We had quite a few bite offs. Smooth Rock is known for trophy pike. It's a big sprawling lake with lots of large bays with quite a bit of trout water also.
4151273,jkaup,2015-08-22 19:31:00,56,Thanks for the report!
4152737,BrianE,2015-08-23 12:42:00,98,"Thanks for the report and glad you had a great time and got plenty of action. I had the opportunity to meet Debbie at the Greenbay show back in the spring, she was super nice and friendly. Fyi she also mentioned that she runs specials in the fall season. A few years ago i met 4 gentlemen from Ohio on either the McKenzie or the Mattice lake dock (i can't remember exactly but i think it was Frontiers dock? but is shared with several outfitters) while waiting to load up for one of Don Elliot's planes and had a short conversation, they said they have been going there for 30 years. I saw a report somewhere online recently where it said Smoothrock is a known trophy Pike lake, i was never aware of that."
4156297,Ogoki,2015-08-25 02:56:00,291,"I am on my way back from a bear hunt at Armstrong and was told David Dill , the owner of Thunderhook and Smoothrock , died on August 9 from cancer."
4156505,fish007,2015-08-25 06:19:00,120,David passed on August 8th from cancer and his son Drake is running the operation. He was our state representative in the district in northern Mn. where we live and he did a great job. The whole crew at Thunderhook/SmoothRock did a wonderful job of keeping the place running seamlessly at a tough time. David will be missed for sure.
4156801,castnblast,2015-08-25 08:48:00,111,"Fish 007, did you happen to meet ""Taylor"", the camp hand / dock boy while you were up there? He is 15 and lives in Thunder Bay, and I am a friend of his father's. He is a good kid, smart worker and a keen angler. I hear he had a great time up there this summer. When I was 15 / 16 I worked at a fish camp on Lac Des Mille Lacs. I learned alot about fish, cleaning fish, eating fish, outboards, lake navigation, boat repair, camp operations, learned to drive a 3 speed stick dump truck. Super fun job for a young outdoors type."
4156841,castnblast,2015-08-25 09:00:00,111,"Yes, Smoothrock is a great pike fishery. we had a blast with big northerns on the flyrod a few summers ago. Condolences to the Dill family"
4157161,fish007,2015-08-25 11:20:00,120,"We certainly did meet Taylor. My wife and I were both impressed with him, he's already doing some guiding and from what I heard he is doing a very good job. His partner in crime Decklin is also a very nice kid. Debbie ended up with a couple of great young men working for her this summer and I hope they're back again next year!"
