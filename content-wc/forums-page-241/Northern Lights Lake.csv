I've been going up every May for many a year and I've never heard anyone else mention this lake. It holds so many trophy fish. Walleye, Lakers, Pike and Smallies. Am I giving away a secret here?"

4507169,Richard B,2016-02-02 10:25:00,735,I went there in June almost 35 years ago. Fishing was decent. Weather was terrible. At the time they only had 14 foot boats with 6 horse motors. Took forever to get anywhere. Central bath house was closed for repairs the entire week. We had to take baths in the lake. No bathroom facilities in any of the cabins at the time. Lake Saganaga is on the north west corner if I remember correctly.
4507177,Walleye will,2016-02-02 10:28:00,218,I've seen there web site and th lake looks really shallow. Has anyone been there? If so what are the walleye numbers?
4507969,adempsey,2016-02-02 14:26:00,963,"It has a max depth of 130 feet. There are shallow areas like any lake, but it's definitely not a shallow lake.http://webapp.navionics.com/?ski=#@10&key=cpreH|klhP"
4509721,TheGlenn86,2016-02-02 21:33:00,11,"I also live near Chicago and the drive takes me about 13 hours. The fishing at Northern Light has always been great. I've never had an issue getting my limit and then some. I have had years where it's been hot and the slot size walleyes are a little harder to find but we always managed to track em down. The resort is also very nice. Most of the cabins have full bathrooms with hot showers and full kitchens. Always clean and the new owner, Kevin, is very friendly. The boats they have to rent are 16' Lunds with 20h tillers. There are some parts of the lake that are big open water and can get a little hairy in a small boat if the wind kicks up but open water can be avoided if you get caught in some weather. And some of the best spots for big fish are within a mile or two of camp. I haven't been up in the fall but I hear that's the best time for big Northerns. I got in May, after ice out, and always catch big northern, lake trout, and walleyes. Smallies can be caught along any shoreline and white fish are also abundant. Walleye season opens for the river on June first. We usually try to avoid the crowd but have fished the river that feeds the lake and we were pulling eater wallys out as fast as we could drop a line. All in all, I can't think of a better time on the water than a spring or fall trip to Northern Lights Lake."

You will have an amazing time if you choose to go there. There are also some really good spots up north of Thunder Bay towards Armstrong, Ontario. Check out Caribou Lake in Armstrong. Very good fishing in that lake with big fish! Just one of many up there but this lake is also a drive to lake such as Northern Lights where many places up near Armstrong are fly ins! I personally prefer the lakes up North but thats not to say Northern Lights isnt excellent also!"
