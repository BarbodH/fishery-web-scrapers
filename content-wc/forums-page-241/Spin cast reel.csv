4614489,Pooch,2016-03-07 05:42:00,4619,"Might be a great time to consider helping your partner learn to use a spinning reel. My wife was the same our first trip, but by noon the first day was doing great with an open faced spinning reel. If they want to fish much in the future you'll be doing them a favor in the long run by teaching them now. Save them buying another reel in the near future. Buy a good reel the first time and have the pleasure of using it for years rather than buying an inexpensive reel then replace it next season.That said, one of our older Canada group does nothing but jig and only uses an old Zebco spin-cast reel. Has for years and fishes more than most people I know. Not sure why he never got further than a Zebco, but he is a happy camper and catches as many fish (if not more!) as the rest of the group.I still have fond memories of my first ""real"" fishing reel. I'll never forget the moment my mom gave it to me for my birthday. I had graduated to being a real fisherman! A Shakespeare 1775 spincast that now sets in a place of honor on a shelf in my office. Took it to Canada many years ago, just to honor my folks who gave it to me and fulfill the dream I had the day I received it as a present. Would hate to have to now use it everyday though.....Pooch"

4592513,mr-fish,2016-02-28 21:00:00,58,"Look At The Zebco Omega Pro Line .... Pricey For A Spincast ... $60 ... $90 .... Debated About Spending This Much For A Spincast, But Well Worth It ... Very Solid Feel ... Smooth .... Can Even Get A Model Designed For Braid .... No Problems Or Complaints After Using It For A Week On Our Yearly Quebec Fly In ...."

4593609,Frankm,2016-02-29 09:32:00,154,The Zebcos that others mentioned are good. Also this style is a little easier for beginners. http://www.basspro.com/Zebco-33-Micr...ct/1507241237/ You can use them on a spinning rod which is nice.
4594489,ftfarms,2016-02-29 15:26:00,444,I would get him a little pflueger trion 25 and spinning rod and have him practice with it as much as he can before you go. He's going to get over it and get used to it. Who wasn't uncomfortable with a spinning outfit at first? I sure was. My grandson wasn't very good or comfortable with it at Christmas time when I got him a new outfit but he's pretty good already with just a little practice.
4602249,fsz,2016-03-02 18:02:00,144,"second zebco omega. Yes they run around $60, but worth it. I bought my sons these reels they held up to mid-teen pike and performed well for walleye. Smooth casting for a spin cast. Ebayed them when they graduated to spinning reels after a few years for 2/3 what I spent. second choice would be a zebco 33 platinum. not as smooth and lower resale, but a good second choice"

4613273,Bill Krejca,2016-03-06 15:20:00,6107,The only spin cast reel I would ever buy - it would have to be for a friend who absolutely could not use a spinning reel- would be one with an oscillating line pickup or oscillating spool. I believe Daiwa makes several. Reels which do not lay the line smoothly onto the spool eventually have a tendency to mess the line up. Bad. Bill
4614289,michigan walleye guy,2016-03-06 22:11:00,95,"If I were you, I would hop on Ebay and pick up an old school Abu Matic 170 or two. This was my very first fishing reel--got it for my 11th birthday back in 1972. Obviously not in production anymore, you can pick up a very good used reel for around $30 on Ebay. I have several of these reels at our cottage in Upper Michigan, for guests who don't fish much but want to pick up some early season walleye off the dock. These reels cast like a dream and are absolutely trouble free. Much, much better than anything you can buy at Cabela's or Bass Pro, IMO. On the May 15 opener, I always pay homage to my Dad and fish off the dock the whole day, with a pair of the old Abu Matics spooled with gold Stren. Listening to Bob Uecker and the Brewers as the sun goes down. Sweet memories......"
