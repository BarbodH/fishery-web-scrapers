The trip North is part of the trip too, go times on the road are a great way to start. Quick border crossing, too. A warm greeting, good cabin, with a deck, and a view of the water. Boat, seats and motor that work a must, time on the water, great fishing and taking time to have a beer, cup of coffee a cigar and watch the sunrise and sunsets! Stories around the campfire, heck let's have a Northern Light display too! A safe trip home, planning the next trip!"
4574481,fishron,2016-02-23 12:44:00,317,"Living in SE Pennsylvania I see a lot of Loons (the bird kind), when fishing the Jersey coast, heading North and South seasonally. It's the first thing I listen for when I fish Canada. When they're migrating off Jersey, they're silent. When I hear that first long wavering call, I know I have arrived."
4575553,Hogwild,2016-02-23 18:13:00,3,"Sights, sounds, and even the smell. If you've been you will never forget. It's the things dreams are made of. If you could bottle the ""Canadian experience"" you would be a millionaire.I just feel sorry for the people that have never been blessed with the experience."
4575593,Baseline,2016-02-23 18:17:00,3207,"Wintering is in the area, but you would need to go a little west to find me. Cutoff to gravel is about 2 miles out of Ignace off 599. One of last remaining places that a non resident can still camp. There's lots of good lakes in north of Ignace. Over the years I've fished a bunch of them."

4602377,Hunts1,2016-03-02 18:21:00,123,"Our group has been going to Ontario for 25 years and have always wanted an out-post setting with relatively low traffic without the airplane ride. (We have had some harrowing experiences on planes in Ontario.) We don't need much in the way of creature comforts. Nice cabin, running water, heat, showers, and bathrooms.We finally found the best place and love it! For years we did a fly-in with the 14 ft 9.9 hp motors with a variety of outfitters and loved the solitude of that kind of experience, but it came with much greater expense and tiny boats. We are getting older now and have, for the past 7 years, had a great experience at Lac Seul Outposts on the northeast area of Lac Seul. Fishing is incredible! The cabins are exactly what we want. Rustic but very comfortable. We have annually a group of 6-10 guys (aged 40-75) and the service is spectacular but we are left alone to our own devices....perfect. Grills on the deck, nice fish cleaning house, has on site, minniws too! All of our needs met plus! Great fishing and an outpost experience! You can bring your own boat or rent theirs. 30 mile, roughly, boat-in away from the crowds. There are some house boats, which we hate, but overalll our group is incredibly happy there. My two cents."

Camp on a pull off on the side of the road. ( nobody else will be coming by)Fish for 4 or 5 days in a big lake full of walleyes, pike and smallmouth. Might see one or two other boats who came north from the southern part of the lake. Do this trip 4 or 5 times August - October 50% of the time I do this trip by myself Usually have to deal with a camp bear at some point Always have a great trip."
4554097,youngknight,2016-02-16 22:49:00,228,"The best fishing I have had was one evening we boated from buck lake (flyin) to granite hill lake near hornpayne. Great numbers and decent size....but a poor experience. Too many boats avpbout us with one idiot back trolling around all us anchored boats like pylons...within 20 feet of us. Had a trip near cochrane...just my 13 yr old and me on a fly in. Fishing so-so and some bad weather but exploring creeks and rivers to get to other lakes, having a moose literally swim by our dock just feet away...that was a wonderful trip....rickety cabin and all. As others have said, you can stay home and catch fish...maybe not the numbers but the solitude and adventure draw me back to the nort country."
4555729,castnblast,2016-02-17 15:22:00,111,"pretty much every other weekend...May to October - 30 minutes to pack & hook the boat up to the truck wednesday night - go to work thursday morning early - leave work at noon, be home in 8 minutes - drive 2 hours to the lake - boat in the water by 3pm - pull up on a private island beach by 3:45 - set up camp, swim, drink beer, relax - head out for an evening fish - head back to camp for fish fry, BS stories, laughs and guitar jam around the fire till??? - fish friday, saturday - head back sunday at noon, home by 3, cut grass, nap on couch - work hard mon, tues, wed repeat yes we are spoiled!"

4558929,Shellback,2016-02-18 16:03:00,8083,"I have a unique situation with my wife having MS. Best case for us is a drive in camp where I can bring my own boat and slide in truck camper. This way I know I'm prepared as best as I can be. A camp I used last year, I explained the situation when renting a cabin and was told everything would be fine. Well, it wasn't. Steps and no handrail, a 2x10 plank laid from shore to the floating dock. not sure what they were thinking. Danged American camp owners! LOL. This year I'm considering a camp that has had a return wheel chair bound guest for quite a few years. I think we will be fine there."
4559241,btyreprich,2016-02-18 17:27:00,1067,In no particular order: 1. Good location on a productive lake - Ear Falls area on Lac Seul 2. Decent boats & motors 3. Comfortable cabins 4. Drive to location 5. Friendly owners We no longer own a boat and rent a small trailer to haul out fishing gear and food to Canada. I the cook of the group and I really appreciate a kitchen with a lot of room & counter space. This area of Lac Seul has been very productive for us over the past several years that we'd never consider trying a new lake.
4572913,Guest,2016-02-22 21:18:00,0,"This would be the perfect answer for me. The only exception being that I have my own 14 foot deep V boat with plenty of creature comforts in a small package. Usually the fishing is good enough that I don't need room for lots of tackle so the comfortable seating, trolling motor, rod holders, and some basic electronics gets it done for me. But a little bit bigger boat would be some better for sure."
4572969,michigan walleye guy,2016-02-22 22:44:00,95,"Sounds like the site of my first Canadian experience, at Wintering Lake, off 599, about 30 minutes north of Ignace. Your comments about the 40-year-old boat landing and the camping on a pull off mirror my experiences there long ago. Somebody posted (earlier this winter) that Wintering Lake has some new cabins. I sure would like to go back. Haven't been there in about 20 years. Sweet memories......"

4552361,Slab Seeker,2016-02-16 12:43:00,14,"Fly-in or boat in lake with one resort , Housekeeping plan with fairly rustic cabin with little or no chance of seeing other boats. But w/o the mouse activity. We plan well enough that if fishing is tough there is more than enough on the menu. As others have said, I go for the solitude and scenery."
4552697,kzoofisher,2016-02-16 14:33:00,5144,"1. Being ""off the grid"". I want quiet and solitude with some chosen friends. The last thing I want is to hear a ring tone of any sort. 2. Good fishing, preferably for a variety of species. 3. Water tight accommodations and boats. Sometimes we bring our own, sometimes we rent. 4. Remote Canada is always scenic so I don't worry about that."
4552721,green&orange,2016-02-16 14:37:00,28,"Take a 12' boat into lakes off of logging road sand two tracks. Boat in, drag in, whatever. 100% DIY. Set up camp and fish. The goals of every trip: - not see anyone else - catch fish - the only worry is where to fish next - cook fresh fish and venison over an open fire washed down with a few Kokanee's. That's a ""last supper"" kind of meal. There is something about just doing everything yourself. It makes the rewards that much sweeter in my opinion. We aren't about the numbers of fish but rather the ""experience""."

4553337,drlee,2016-02-16 17:23:00,409,"Have flown in, loved it. Have boated in, ok. Now drive in, take my own boat, good fishing, isolated almost like boat/fly in, nice cabins, good people in the camp, as well as the owners, know the lakes well...I am very happy."
4553473,lassh,2016-02-16 17:54:00,553,"I guess I agree with Golden Eagle. Being there is the most important... There are pros and cons for most of the Canadian experience options. Less solitude for boat-in options vs. fly-ins. Smaller lakes with less options on most flyins. Less flexiblity at full serve lodges. Smaller, slower, less rigged boats than where you bring your own. More time, towing costs, potential mechanical problems when you bring own boat. Weather delays and gear limits when flying. Bigger lake systems generally have more trophy potential. I don't like fishing in crowds of people. (Though I'll be making an exception in Detroit/Windsor in a few weeks.) This is one reason I do an annual fly-in. I like lakes with big fish potential. This bodes well for Lake of Woods trip and Manitoba trip. The fly-in lake also has large fish although there are a couple other cabins on the lake so I compromise on the only cabin on the lake ideal. I prefer not to have a strict schedule and be required to go out with a guide all the time but if I had the opportunity to do a far north trophy trip to Kasba, or Reindeer or Great Slave I would love it. I do want the equipment to function like motors, roofs, screens, and refrigeration, but don't care if there is TV or internet although the weather channel is handy sometimes. I like to have a roof over head and a place to dry off but should probably plan a Quetico trip before I get too old. Its just a great experience as long as you are with good people (or solo) who respect the resource. Trade offs on all options but its all good... andI appreciate it more each year."

I can go about anywhere and catch fish; my enjoyment in the northwoods environment supersedes mere accumulation of landed fish for the week. Bill"
4550849,MrSimon,2016-02-16 07:20:00,922,"Canada offers a lot!!!! From five star lodges with French chefs and dock boys, to rickety outpost cabins with leaky roofs and mice droppings everywhere.

4551169,That Minnesota guy,2016-02-16 08:23:00,8293,"I have driven in and done a fly in. My thing is I hate little boats. 14' boats with 15 hp motors are not comfortable to fish from for me. As far as a cabin, no mice, good screens and a solid non leaking roof are a must. I'm not baking in the sun all day and then listening to mice run all night. Or worse yet, listen to the plop,plop of rain drops hitting a catch pan in the cabin. No thanks. I want scenery when I go to Canada. The beauty and tranquility of the land is why I go. I can stay home and catch fish, it's the other stuff that draws me North."

4551209,stjoeguy,2016-02-16 08:33:00,979,"1. Good fishing. Otherwise, why go? Well, I take that back. I go on a Lake of the Woods trip that's an all meals included, order off the menu trip, but that's more of a guy's getaway, social type trip than a fishing trip. I prefer fishing trips. 2. Outpost cabin, but comfortable without the leaky roof and mouse droppings. I like the ""away from it all"" feeling. No phone, TV, etc. Our cabin got internet last year and I'm not sure how I feel about that. Rarely seeing any other boats on the lake is nice. I like the tranquility. 3. A boat-in trip. I'm sure I'd like a fly-in except for the cost. I'd rather do 2 trips per year than 1 fly-in. I also prefer using my own boat and electronics with gear stashed away in compartments."
