4611865,BornToFish,2016-03-06 05:57:00,1224,"About fifteen years ago, our daughter traveled with my wife to London for vacation. The people at the airport refused to let our daughter board the plane until my wife produced a letter of authorization written by me, giving my permission for our daughter to travel with my wife to London. What a fire drill! My wife and I have traveled with our nephew on two occasions to NW Ontario. We had a signed/notarized letter of authorization from my sister and brother in law giving us permission to take our nephew to Canada. It had all kinds of information (e.g. destination, dates of travel, insurance policy numbers, authorization for medical treatment, etc.). We weren't asked for this letter at the border. But, we were prepared and confident crossing the border. Having the signed and notarized letter is cheap insurance. Don't leave home without it!"
4611873,pjshorthorn,2016-03-06 05:59:00,5654,"Nah, I just have my wife write a permission slip allowing me to go fishing in Canada. I hand it to the border agent with my passport and politely answer all their questions. I do have to admit that the questioning does become a little personal when the agent starts asking me about whether I have my man card with me and that they will need to see it as well. As far as Gramps crossing the border, I'm trying to figure out how to prevent the delays we experienced last year when crossing at Baudette,Mn on the way home. Gramps insisted on sitting at the helm in Breezy's boat as we pulled up to the agent's booth at the crossing............like he was Santa Claus on the float in the Christmas parade. That was bad enough, but he was wearing a Green Bay Packers sweatshirt to boot. We were there a long time. Son and Grandson couldn't have been more proud on that day..... PjShorthorn"
4612721,pike50plus,2016-03-06 12:07:00,584,The letter must be notorized if one parent
4615241,SinOrSwim,2016-03-07 08:44:00,1528,"First year I took my 9 year old, I had a letter and was never asked for it. Last year I took him and I completely forgot about the letter. They had me roll the window down so they could talk to him and they asked him if his Mom knew he was here and if this was his Dad. He said, yes and we were on our way. I'm taking 2 of my kids this year so I need to remember to take the letter this year. There is a template on the website."
4615353,LOW1,2016-03-07 09:02:00,2828,"I take kids across the border about 4 times per year. I have been asked for a letter about 25% of the time. When I have been asked for a letter it's usually been a female border officer who has requested it.If wife and I are both going, we usually take two cars because of excessive junk, dogs, kids, kids' friends, etc. So we have conjured up a form which we both sign giving each other permission to take the kids.Notary is good - anything that appears professional and prepared is good. Date the form and state that it has no expiration date. Include contact and phone information for the other spouse. And include a sentence which says that a photocopy is as good as the original. Finally, identify the kids by SSN and/or dob so that the border officer can match the letter to birth certificate/passport information.(when taking your kids' friends you should get a similar letter from both friends' parents)"
4615473,Guest,2016-03-07 09:20:00,0,"This winter, when returning into MN at the I-Falls entry point, the agent told me that I needed an approved document for my 9yr old. I had a birth certificate and a notarized letter from my wife, but the agent said that was not sufficient. She recommended a Nexus card - since it was free under a certain age. She did NOT detain us, or give us any grief, so it was a pretty easy passing, but she did mention that an ""approved"" document was needed, and a BC was not considered ""approved"" In probably 2 dozen crossings, this was the first time anything was mentioned regarding his BC not being sufficient???"
4615585,Obabikon,2016-03-07 09:39:00,2370,"Shortline, I have a feeling that officer was incorrect. I've always been told by the border agents that a BC was all that was required. My girls are 6 and 8... I always have their certificates, and have been told many times that is all that is required. I guess there's a chance the laws changed."
4616297,bus33,2016-03-07 13:25:00,289,"No passport if under 16. When my son was under 16, I brought Birth Certificate, SS Card, and a signed form letter stating my wife (his mom) is ok with him crossing the border with me. The letter included dates of the trip and where we were going. I have that letter notorized also."
4616825,stumcfar,2016-03-07 15:42:00,451,"I travel into Manitoba 25 times a year to fish and Ontario at least once a year. My wife is often not with. We got my son a NEXXUS card which has made things very simple. I have been asked if there is a note from the mother, so we automatically have her write one up with her cell number each time we fish. I hand it to the agent with my passport. I have been thanked numerous times for having the letter. I think they realize you have done your homework if you have it with and it just makes the crossing much simpler."
4610321,buckeye1,2016-03-05 10:09:00,269,What to bring 12 year old this year. What documents are required?
4610425,Jatar,2016-03-05 11:00:00,169,"I am pretty sure the child needs a passport, also needed is a letter from your spouse if he/she is not with you, send me a pm with your e-mail address and I will send you the letter that we have been using"
4610449,v-bay gord,2016-03-05 11:12:00,3168,If under 16 they only need a proof of US citizenship (if arriving by land). More info at www.travel.state.gov
4610529,forgop,2016-03-05 11:48:00,880,FalseA minor crossing the border by land doesn't need a passport. A letter is NOT required but a darn good idea. Best to have signed and notarized.
4610537,3 Z's,2016-03-05 11:52:00,133,Under 16 and a birth certificate is accepted.
4610569,pjshorthorn,2016-03-05 12:09:00,5654,"I would double check on the need for a notarized letter giving you permission to bring the child into Canada. If you are the father, the spouse would have to give permission. I believe there is a boilerplate letter on the immigration website. PjShorthorn."
4610601,v-bay gord,2016-03-05 12:17:00,3168,Is that how Gramps gets you across the border?
4610673,adempsey,2016-03-05 13:19:00,963,"I would get a notarized letter from the parent(s). It's very unlikely they will ask for it with a child that age [they can just talk to the child directly], but why risk it? You don't need it to be notarized either, but it's recommended and would makes things a lot smoother if they ask for a permission letter. Parent/Guardian needs to be in the same vehicle as the child as well."
4610705,ftfarms,2016-03-05 13:31:00,444,I always had a letter signed by the childs mother (never notarized) but they never asked about it. They just talked to the child directly asked how they know me and if there mother new where they was and who there with. Never a problem.
4611209,kzoofisher,2016-03-05 17:56:00,5144,"This. Never been asked for it. Kids have their own passports just because we spend a lot of time on the border and a picture id seems like a good idea. The letter I carry for the week in CA has all details of dates, lodge and hotel where we stay Friday night, Mom's signature and notarized."
