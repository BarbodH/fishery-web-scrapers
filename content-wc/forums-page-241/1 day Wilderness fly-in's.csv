4005306,maddogg,2015-06-28 09:45:00,178,"PackproHow do you rig the gulp? On a jig lip hooked or threaded on, or like a drop shot rig?"
4005770,packpro,2015-06-28 14:27:00,695,"Threaded the point of the hook through the nose onto a jig. Better to have a slightly longer shank so the point of the hook exits top middle of the back. We vertical jig, and just flipped it out a short distance and hopped it back horizontally. We were fishing a rock reef so we were limited how far we could throw it out."
4597161,adempsey,2016-03-01 10:38:00,963,"I've been trying to find these lakes on a map and it's near impossible. There are so many lakes! Anyone know if they go by a different name? I know that local names are often still used instead of ""official"" names. Not too mention the shear number of unnamed lakes in the region. Oh, and even better, multiple lakes with the same name!"
4598433,v-bay gord,2016-03-01 17:11:00,3168,I just went to Google map and punched in Pincher lake and it took me to it.......perhaps the others you are interested could be found that way as well......
4598569,adempsey,2016-03-01 17:56:00,963,"Yes indeed. I have found some, but not most. Most of the lakes mentioned in this thread I could not find - Scumpy, No. 1, Brommie. I have a feeling they are local names or just names the Outfitter chose."
4598729,v-bay gord,2016-03-01 18:18:00,3168,You're likely right.......I could not find Brommie........been there several times. It's north-west of Vermilion Bay.....just a small lake. If you go into the Wilderness Air base they have a nice map with all the lakes they fly to. Too many lakes up here to have official names I guess.
4607761,packpro,2016-03-04 09:44:00,695,I picked up the Wilderness map years ago at the All-Canada. Just took some time to find it. If you have Google earth here are the coordinates: Scumpy Lat 50 20'37.07 N Long 94 5'10.71 W No. 1 Lat 50 30'1.84 N Long 93 30'1.84 W Brommie Lat 50 18'16.21 Long 93 42'15.39 W

4003282,fishinnut 3446,2015-06-27 10:48:00,638,"Maybe looking at a day fly-in if the Son and Brother tag out bear hunting early What lakes have you guys fished ? I have been to Brommie 2X and fishing was AWESOME ! Just don't remember how much it was so if someone has a price list please post, tried a search but couldn't find it."
4003306,Fonzie,2015-06-27 11:01:00,85,"You didn't mention where you'll be located, but a friend and I have used Wilderness Air with great results. Check out their website because it lists all the lakes you have to choose from. The walleye fishing on our one-day fly-in was so easy, I switched to a spinnerbait and still pounded the walleye . ."
4003402,v-bay gord,2015-06-27 11:54:00,3168,"Brommie, from the 2014 price list was $763.00 for 3 passengers, or less. Pincher, or Fisher are fun lakes if you like to catch smaller musky on light tackle....bass stuff, surface baits."
4003506,fishinnut 3446,2015-06-27 13:46:00,638,Thanks Gord.Will be staying in the Vermillion Bay area.

4004010,packpro,2015-06-27 19:13:00,695,"Our group fished No. 1. Three groups over three days. Very good time. The fish were 80%' between 22""-26"". None over, but plenty in that range. One right after the other. Wilderness had very good equipment on the lake, and the pilot made sure you were fishing before taking off. It is an artificial lure only lake. Two of us were using 5"" gulp and the guy in the middle was using 3"" gulp. At one time the score was 1-13-1. We started trimming the 5"" after that. Others groups had good luck with Chartrues twisters, and cranks, but black shad Gulp always won the day. Wilderness does a great job, and the pilots are as humorous as they are skilled."
4005098,fishinnut 3446,2015-06-28 08:47:00,638,"packpro, You are right about being skilled, The 1st time just the Son and I went and Wilderness called that morning and ask if we still wanted to go, That should have meant something it was windy as a mother and a white knuckle ride there and back but did not take us back to camp, He took us to Wilderness and before I knew it the pilot turned that plane sideways split the gap between some trees and landed in their bay, I just about CHIT myself!Humorous ? The 2nd time using them it was the Wife/Son/Daughter and me coming back the wife was taking pictures and the pilot asked if she wanted better pic. then reached over her and opened the window and proceeded to nose dive to get a little closer to the ground (WTF!?)"
4005138,v-bay gord,2015-06-28 08:59:00,3168,"I might have posted it last year, but for those wondering what Wilderness Air is all about, or what it's like to get up in a float plane.....here you go.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrTRn6aQJ1I"
4005154,jkretch,2015-06-28 09:03:00,80,Gord. Contemplating a trip into Pincher in mid August with my son. I realize every day is different and they are muskies. But what kind is size range and numbers might be reasonable expectations?? Thanks.
4005242,v-bay gord,2015-06-28 09:25:00,3168,"They are mostly in the 30 inch range, but still built like a musky and act like a musky. I've seen an upper 40 inch fish in there but it's not common. We've caught over 50 in a day, but I would think 20 fish would be pretty average, especially if you haven't fished the lake before. There are several really good spots that hold multiple fish....generally the bigger weed beds, but they are everywhere. We use bass baits mostly and top water.....bring lighter spinning gear. Leave the musky gear at home. One of the best baits we've found are the Mepps #4 or #5 tipped with a small white twister tail (this is the key ingredient). Make sure you figure 8 them at the boat.......seems like you catch many right at boat side. I would suggest flattening the barbs on your baits. Easier to release and less chance you'll spend the day there with a hook hanging off your face or ear."
