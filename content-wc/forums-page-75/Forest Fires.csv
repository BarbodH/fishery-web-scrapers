6566874,ILScott,2021-06-06 06:02:00,139,Just got word yesterday that a fire broke out by Wine Lake Camp on the Anishinabi River. Owner has a worker in camp and noticed the fire and called the MNR. They had to bring in water planes to put it out. Is it that dry in Ontario? I know this lake system is really low by pictures I have seen. Be safe up north.

6566936,BrianinVA,2021-06-06 09:04:00,160,"The Ontario MNR Forest Fire Info Map shows where all the current fires are and has a layer that shows the fire ""danger rating."" Currently, the further north you go the better the situation but a lot of the area is in the ""moderate"" to ""extreme"" range."
