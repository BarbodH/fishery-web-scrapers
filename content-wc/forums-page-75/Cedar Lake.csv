6564262,Da' Walleye Assassun,2021-05-27 22:03:00,358,Holding musky and northern pike vertically can kill them.
6564266,prov1800,2021-05-27 22:29:00,5010,Yes.I have told him that.**** get it right next time.it was released unharmed.First muskie.Not everyone is a expert.
6564276,Eckohlt,2021-05-28 02:37:00,3685,"Another day in paradise,looks like the Muskie is missing some meat on his side,did your son have alittle sushi?"
6564306,prov1800,2021-05-28 05:48:00,5010,Pretty sure those are spawning bruises.see that every year on pike and muskie females
6564442,Eckohlt,2021-05-28 13:01:00,3685,The guys are hard on those big gals
6564500,Bill Krejca,2021-05-28 18:45:00,6107,"Ya, thank goodness no more fish pictures. We folks in the states just hate to keep seein' them!!! Not! Bill"
6565790,prov1800,2021-06-02 19:12:00,5010,Here's a few from yesterday Bill.Beauty day on Cedar.Walleyes are biting like crazy.Shallow bite 2-3 ft of water.Yesterday in east end I could see them swimming and and I picked them off on a slip bobber.Had a foot and a half of line under the bobber.Threw it in and bobber would dissapear. Lots of smallmouth to.10 dozen free minnows gone.lol.Pretty fun day.Crappies not spawning yet.Thinking this weekend with our heat wave coming.regonize the shore lunch spot.
6565798,prov1800,2021-06-02 19:22:00,5010,Few more lake pics
6565898,Bill Krejca,2021-06-03 06:56:00,6107,"Thanks for the pictures, John! Looks like the water level went up a bit, eh? What's the water temp? I'm guessing high 50's - low 60's? Bill"
6565986,Eckohlt,2021-06-03 10:10:00,3685,"Bill wish I could dive in then I could tell you the temp,swimming is still on hold for awhile I guess"

6563702,prov1800,2021-05-26 06:56:00,5010,Snuck out yesterday morning over to Clarks grabbed some minnows and launched the boat in calm water there. headed out fishing on a decent forecast day but super windy with 40-50 km winds.Fished some spots out of the wind and again had great success in the shallows.Mostly all water sized fish but they came quickly on just about everytime I threw my jig in.Didnt go any further than around time Sqaure and in way back i pulled into Nelson Lake.Have to be carefull going in there as water is very low in there.Fishing in there was really good.No boats in my travells and only saw some loons and 2 swans.Water temps staying at 58-60.No crappies on beds yet will need some warmer weather to get them to come in.Suspect first week of June as usuall.Headed back out Thurs with my son and probe some deeper water and see if we can find some bigger fish.
6563810,Eckohlt,2021-05-26 14:20:00,3685,Not long after you grab those free minnows your grabbing for that fillet knife by the looks of it john
6563814,prov1800,2021-05-26 14:47:00,5010,You got that right Rod. This time of the year is almost to easy to catch fish.I went through 5-6+ dozen minnows yesterday in 4 hrs so that's a lot of fish for one guy and appreciate getting the run of the minnow shack at Clarks.i used to have minnow traps up the hwy not far from my house and my guests would love stopping at the creek and help me get our supply for the day. Plus id keep a cage in the creek behind my house full as i could.As a local guy iam only allowed 10 doz minnows on my fishing license.But rather go to Clarks now much easier and great selection.Taking my son with me tomorrow.Will look for some larger female walleyes hiding a little deeper tgan the males and see where the pre spawn crappies are in the east end.Cold front here and tomorrow morning is going to be be below zero.lol.

6563934,prov1800,2021-05-26 21:23:00,5010,All plants still in closed porch.Dont go in till June.
6564224,prov1800,2021-05-27 19:53:00,5010,You can have them all Rod.lol.
6564230,prov1800,2021-05-27 20:08:00,5010,Did get out with my son and Ryan and Denise.Excellent day.Fish steady in 2-3 ft.Cold ride this morning.Frosty for a while.0c but got up to 11c today nice and sunny.Ryan ended up with a good muskie and she swam away strong.I caught a bunch of fish to and a muskie but iam sure you guys are tired of seeing me with fish so I'll pass on the pics
6562130,prov1800,2021-05-20 06:03:00,5010,Yeah.it shoukd help as long as no new fires with lightning.Pretty noisy outside right now.But rain will be welcome.Rained over night some already.looking like 4 days of rain.

Good fishing for afternoon.All small males but do I care.NO.Tons of action.Lots of bass in shallow to and got a number of perch in one spot.2 muskies took 2 of my walleyes thats always fun.And pulled a good northern out to.Visited at Cedar Point Lodge and met Wade.We talked on dock and we saw a 45"" muskie swim by my boat and under the dock."
6561548,prov1800,2021-05-18 06:31:00,5010,Got out for a day with Al from Cedar Lake Lodge.Walleyes were actually tough to find.Found a few here and there and maybe because we had no live bait might have been the problem.But managed to get some on some twister tails.Pike liked the twisters as did a couple of bass and a red horse sucker.The sucker actually put up a good fight.Weather was hot out and no wind either.Fun day and nice to get out with Al.We ended up seeing a year-long moose in Nelson Lake so tgat was a bonus.Got a pic but doesn't show up to good but nice ĺake pic.
6561612,stumcfar,2021-05-18 09:02:00,451,"Thanks for sharing. I may be an exception, but I have had terrible luck using plastics on Lac Seul, never fished Cedar. We can be on a steady live bait bite and throw on different plastics just to see and virtually nothing. The funny thing is fishing the river below the dam and plastics work great. Plastics seem to be effective on the Rainy River here in MN, but once again I struggle with them on LOW. Maybe it is just me."
6561638,prov1800,2021-05-18 09:48:00,5010,It's like that for me on most lakes.Hit a hot spot with live stuff and get them at a fast rate then switch and slows way down.Nothing like live bait.bur in current areas they do perform better.Have noticed that.
6561646,Eckohlt,2021-05-18 10:12:00,3685,That red would look good on your wall haha
6561654,prov1800,2021-05-18 10:31:00,5010,Your right its a nice looking fish.Dont normally catch then on a jig.
6562080,prov1800,2021-05-19 20:10:00,5010,Today i unloaded at Clarks as they have moved back for the summer.Lots of planes flying but no guests.Got to go into a happy place.The minnow shack. Lol.Picked out some awesome minnows that did a terrific job.Fish where hungry and pretty shallow.About every time I pitched out a jig and minnow I caught a fish .water temps mid lake at 60 F.Nothing much deeper find some boulders you found fish.
