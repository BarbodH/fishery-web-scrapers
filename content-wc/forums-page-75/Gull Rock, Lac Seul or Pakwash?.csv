6565822,Tonyo,2021-06-02 20:36:00,212,"First off, I will say that any one of the 3 are probably or can be the best youWant them to be but I cannot provide an opinion on anything but Gullrock. I have been fortunate enough to fish Gullrock for the past several years with great success. Maybe that is because I travel with a great group of guys or that we stay at a great resort with great owners. Gullrock has provided me and my family and friends non stop memories whether the fishing was out of this world or just great. The lake and its access to the other 4 lakes, Red Lake, Keg lake, Two Islands, and Ranger provide you with all the options you can fish in a weeks time. I have been able to fish in June and late September/early October with unbelievable experiences for both times of year. Gullrock is easy to navigate and you do not have to travel long distances to productive fishing opportunities. I will continue to make this my fishing destination."
6565950,REG,2021-06-03 09:12:00,445,"Having fished Pakwash for many, many years, I can agree there are plenty of fish in all 3 of these incredible lake systems. So feel free to enjoy either Gull Rock or Lac Seul. You can't go wrong with either. I'll just hang out over here at Snake Falls Camp on Pakwash. Don't worry about me. I'll be OK. Honest."
6565978,stumcfar,2021-06-03 09:53:00,451,"I can only speak for Lac Seul, but it is our go to lake. We stay in the Ear Falls area and typically sometime between last week of May to mid-June. You certainly do not have to boat far, to catch alot of walleyes that time of year. I will say, that it has gotten much busier that last several years, compared to when we first started going."
6567322,Web,2021-06-07 16:06:00,7,"I have been to Pakwash for 43 years always in the spring.. I have fished several of the other surrounding lakes and while i know that those are great fisheries.. We really have never had a bad trip to Pakwash. Lots of big fish.. Lots of days of just unreal fishing.. Close spots, far away spots, chains of lakes and rivers you can access, spots to really be secluded and spots where there are plenty of other fisherman. Yes, it is big water. And you need to respect that.. but if you watch the weather and take it easy you can navigate this lake without a great deal of trouble. Lots of nice camps on the lake.. We always have liked Pakwash Lake Camp.. Great location and great hosts."
6564566,prov1800,2021-05-29 07:07:00,5010,Have never fished it but know people that have and they said its very good.
6564582,Bakefish,2021-05-29 08:24:00,1077,"I fished Pakwash for many years, all on the south end. In the spring the walleyes came easy. Fall was much tougher. Pike fishing is fantastic, with many very large pike available. My biggest weighed in at 26 lbs. The reason I don't fish there any more is because I've spent too many days sitting in the cabin waiting for the wind to change. Pakwash is 15 miles long and 5 miles wide with only a few islands to block the waves. When that wind is honking from the north or northeast it's impossible to get out on the lake. I'm guessing that when the wind is from the south you would experience the same on the north end."
6564762,Bergy,2021-05-30 07:24:00,83,"Bakefish. Where do you go now? I have Humminbird electronics. Is there a map chip for any of these lakes? Gull Rock, Lac Seul or Pakwash? Trying to compare the lakes for fishing in mid July because that is when it works for us to go."
6564844,fishman10,2021-05-30 12:43:00,226,"I have fished lac suel and gull rock Last year I worked in red lake and had my boat thete from July till October And been many times before.Numbers wise is great, lots of fish, not much for size. But always a great time&#x1f44d;Lived in Sioux lookout for 2 years Fished lac suel many times, stayed at lost island lodge on several occasions with my nephews.I brought my 14 footer with a 20, I fished minutes away, within several hundred meteres of the lodge, rock pile west, red buoy in front of the lodge.Fishing is in a different league in lac suel, thing that amazes me is the various sizes.Many 20-27 inches, lots of fish, my nephew from Australia counted one night, 96 in 2 hours!We also went 15 miles up the lake, did great but didn‚Äôt find it any better than close to the lodge I tell anyone, lac suel is THE best walleye fishery in the world. Hands down.If you ever get a chance, go there!"
6565708,Aspencreek,2021-06-02 15:00:00,2911,"I am in full agreement with ProV, On LS you can fish off the dock in most places....you do not need to boat all the way to McKenzie to catch fish. I have done 27 trips to LS since 2000 and not 1 time during all of those weeks have I even tried to go to McKenzie, although many of the other boats in camp fish there exclusively. But my question has always been, why? We have proven time and again there are other spots, tactics and methods that will produce quality fish. My goal with every trip has always been to find a new hot spot. LS is huge, and the spots that may be producing one day can be duplicated in a hundred other spots. And if the wind is wrong, you can find someplace else rather than fight it. Believe me, the fish are everywhere! Maybe it's a comfort level, maybe it's the fear of the unknown, maybe its the lack of knowledge to try something different, maybe it's the only safe travel route on the GPS. But for you guys who are doing the trip from Ear Falls all the way down to McKenzie, through some pretty treacherous water I might add, you are driving right past some really quality spots all along the way, just to line up with everyone else with the same idea. Not my idea of what fishing LS is."
6565718,prov1800,2021-06-02 15:15:00,5010,With all those fisherman going far to fish is good with me.When I guide at Onaway Lodge iam the last guy to leave the dock and then i have a lot if water to fish in without getting bothered .I do usually run up into broad Lake in early season when iam asked and I do see earfalls boats in there to.But as long as everyone is enjoying themselves Thats what counts
6565722,Aspencreek,2021-06-02 15:23:00,2911,"Good point, out of all of my spots I really enjoy South islet, Manitoba and Stoney. But the hidden secret is ..........well if I say it here, it won't be a secret anymore. I'll PM you."
6565740,Eckohlt,2021-06-02 16:22:00,3685,"I may have spotted you in broad lake from the float plane when I flew to upper wapesi,it sure looked like you,you were holding a red horse sucker"
6565752,rather-be-fishin,2021-06-02 16:54:00,429,You don't have to travel far to catch big fish on Lac Seul! Our fishing group have caught several 27¬î-28¬î Walleyes within eye sight of of Onaway Resort!!! üòé RBF
6565760,Aspencreek,2021-06-02 17:42:00,2911,"There is at least 1 that lives under the boathouse, BUT Don't even try and catch it, there will be **** to pay!"
6564036,Bergy,2021-05-27 10:16:00,83,"We are planning a trip for a future year in July. Which lake would you recommend for numbers and size of Walleyes? Gull Rock, Lac Seul near Ear Falls or Pakwash. One of the considerations is distance traveling by water once we get to camp. We want to fish and spend less time going for a boat ride. Thanks for the input."
6564084,johnboat,2021-05-27 13:53:00,2014,You know my vote! &#x1f600;
6564102,rather-be-fishin,2021-05-27 14:50:00,429,LAC SEUL is a Walleye factory!!! üëç‚ù§Ô∏èüé£ RBF
6564220,prov1800,2021-05-27 19:49:00,5010,Lac Suel hands down.Check out Onaway Lodge for what i think are the best accomadations
6564242,Fishin Fun,2021-05-27 20:35:00,218,I spent about 30 years going to Gullrock. Nice lake. Very few rock hazards and fishing spots are generally close to camp. There have been years that we've caught so many fish that it felt like a dream. Other years we've had to really work for fish. I started fishing Lac Seul about 6 years ago and I'd have to agree that it is a walleye factory. We typically stay in the Ear Falls area so it can be a long drive to get to some of the typical fishing spots. But it is worth it. There are a lot of rock hazards in Lac Seul too. One of the guys on our last trip hit a rock in an area that wasn't marked so you have to be careful. I honestly love both lakes for different reasons but I'll continue to go back to Lac Seul and may occasionally return to Gullrock for some more relaxing fishing.
6564248,Guest,2021-05-27 20:55:00,0,"Would recommend Lac Seul, Lost Island Lodge."
6564250,yoopertrout,2021-05-27 21:00:00,1172,"I've wanted to try Lac Seul. A fishing buddy stayed at Onaway and liked it, but he said they ended up traveling a long way to fish. Do you need to boat very far from Lost Island? Thanks."
6564268,prov1800,2021-05-27 22:43:00,5010,From what I've learned and seen is that if you coukd catch fish a half mile from your camp which basically you can do most places people will still travell to the far end of the lake and people from that end of the lake will travell to where your coming from.Just the way it works.I don't understand why people from earfalls travell so far.ive guided up there and fishing is great.But everyone wants to go to McKenzie bay.its really crazy.I guide for Onaway a lot and there's great fishing within a mile but no one wants to come to Canada to only go a mile so i take folks father.If you want to go to McKenzie bay why stay in earfalls thats a long ride.theres closer camps to go to.Ive fished from the lost bay area and yeah fishing fairly and if you only fish close to camp there your missing the boat.Nice days its fun to travell ugly days close is good.
6564316,Habitual Eyer,2021-05-28 06:17:00,144,Fished both. Trip from Ear Falls to productive waters sometimes difficult. Gullrock way easier. The more you fish it..the more you learn it...the better it gets. When you throw in Red Lake as well (very easy to add to the equation as not hard to get to from Gullrock) this system gets the nod hands down. Gull and Red seems like Canadian shield...Lac Seul not so much being created by dam and not glacier.
6564558,Bergy,2021-05-29 06:48:00,83,Any thoughts on Pakwash?
