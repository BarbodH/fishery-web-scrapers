6567782,stumcfar,2021-06-08 15:39:00,451,"LOW on the Minnesota side is nothing over 19.5"", but allow for 1 over 28"". I don't believe very many over 28"" are kept each year. There is no minimum size limit and not sure what to think on the small end. The lake seems to be full of 12'-13' saugers and every year it seems to be the same. We personally don't take fish that small, but the charter boats do. At times it is darned near impossible to find a 16""-18"" walleye. Everything is either too small or over 19.5"". Not sure if that means the keeper sized fish are getting fished out or is there so darned many small ones that the keepers have a hard time getting to your hook???"
6568624,Barley,2021-06-10 17:14:00,10,"Eating a 20 inch smallie is disgusting. What are these people thinking? I'm happy for any enforced regulations that are best for the fishery. I like fresh fish as much as the next guy but I like catching so much more. Unless we get serious now about conservation, our favorite pastime will be history."
6568646,Eckohlt,2021-06-10 18:17:00,3685,"I'm not sure how old you are,if you fished Ontario back in the 60's or early 70's there were limits but no size limits,you would have crapped your pants as to what got carved up,thank god they wised up and started slots or there would be zero big fishing,not sure what year they put a slot size in place maybe someone can chime in with that"
6568692,Barley,2021-06-10 20:03:00,10,"I was there in the 70s and felt the same way then. Why would anyone eat a trophy. It's worth so much more back in the water, regardless of the species."
6568724,Eckohlt,2021-06-11 04:34:00,3685,"Times have changed for the better,most now throw big fish back,but then there are still people who don't care and put the knife to big fish,you do your part and I'll do mine and feel good about it,that's all you can do"

6567172,Wallychowder,2021-06-07 07:30:00,1567,"I would have to agree with Gord on the 40. If a 70 can lay up to half a million eggs ! Whats a 69 lay 450,000 ?..lol."
6567190,Eckohlt,2021-06-07 08:30:00,3685,"That's a lot of eggs,thank god walleyes can't collect welfare"
6567202,troutwater,2021-06-07 08:57:00,299,"Don't we already kind of see this with pike in Ontario? All over 29"" are to be released? I like it. Living in MN I am appalled at what I see kept. Heck just last week my girlfriend's brother in law kept and ate a 20"" smallmouth from the Mississippi River. Now he's talking about getting a replica mount. I think that kind of defeats the purpose...."
6567218,stumcfar,2021-06-07 10:01:00,451,"Obviously I am know fisheries expert, but I would speculate that the walleyes between 21"" and 27"" are far more fertile than the old girls over 27"". I would think protecting all walleyes 20"" and up and allowing 1 over 27"" or 28"" would be a better strategy???"
6567242,Wallychowder,2021-06-07 11:21:00,1567,"Why would a person want a walleye 27"" or 28"" not to eat i hope ! Like the man said a replica is better than the real thing by far !"
6567262,Eckohlt,2021-06-07 12:21:00,3685,"I think in Mexico you can keep anything you want,you mentioned about booking a trip there,you can keep 100 pounders"
6567724,stumcfar,2021-06-08 12:32:00,451,"I think you missed my point. Taking one over 28"" would do less harm than taking a 22"" or 25"". People are going to take a 21"" or 22"" to eat. Most wouldn't take one over 27"" or 28"" anyway."
6567726,Wallychowder,2021-06-08 12:38:00,1567,"I say 16"" to 18"" everything else back in !"
