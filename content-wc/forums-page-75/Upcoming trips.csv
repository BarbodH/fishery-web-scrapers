6566452,prov1800,2021-06-04 10:23:00,5010,Sounds like good eating sized fish.And yes price per pound is expensive to catch fish here but dint think most folks come here for just that.What we have here is priceless in my book and its my back yard.
6566462,lassh,2021-06-04 10:45:00,553,"I think that netting has a much larger impact on the fish population on LOW than the sport fishing. For that reason, I don't order frozen walleye. That is just my personal decision and I am not judging anyone who supports the commercial walleye industry. The lack of ecological control is because of of non-expiring treaties signed years ago before conservation of the resource was considered. Its a reality and the restaurants would support the industry even if no individuals bought the commercial walleye. The sports fishing regulations are in place to try to protect the fish populations and are necessary and have had an impact. However; I think the commercial industry has a far greater impact not only on LOW, but many remote lakes where spawn time netting occurs. I don't think there will be much of a noticeable impact on fish populations on LOW due to the border restrictions. Just my 2 cents."
6564298,gmattbruin,2021-05-28 05:34:00,174,"I realize as of now our borders are still closed and thts restricting all of you american walleye guys. I feel your pain. So honestly not trying to rub salt in the wounds with this post but hoping to share and hear where some are 100% going and maybe for you guys what you have booked HOPING for a border reopen. Our annual group from southern ont are doing our annual fly in with twin Lakes into Abamasagi again in abt 2wks. Everything as of now is typical of all other yrs We also have a 2nd fly in with TLO in late Aug, probably, but not certain back to Aba. Im gonna see if our limited group for that 1 is willing to try a different lake. I think whats important is to recognize and feel happy for the outfitters that have hung on thru last season, returned to open this yr admist all the chaos. If we here in Ont can up our game in bookings, keep these guys going, we all know when the borders open all you US groups will more than make up for lost time, and revenue for all these outfitters.....which MANY are US owned. We all do our part, we can only hope the majority survive thru this Where are you going for sure?? Cheers"

After all, its been said that the walleye population on LOTW is dwindling down fast, so with a 3,4 year break that should help build up the population again !.....lol."

6566236,alanexpup,2021-06-03 21:04:00,278,Hi. I have never this before but I ordered 5 pounds of fillet of walleye and 11 pound of filleted northerns. I got them last week and they are nice big ones. Can't wait to see how they compare to what I remember them tasting like.
6566286,Eckohlt,2021-06-04 03:28:00,3685,So did you get one 5 pound walleye and one 11 pound northern?you said they were big.hahaha
6566304,prov1800,2021-06-04 05:39:00,5010,Was wondering same thing.yuk.
6566320,Wallychowder,2021-06-04 06:34:00,1567,you dont fish in the US ?
6566324,Wallychowder,2021-06-04 06:50:00,1567,"just curious, where would you order something like that ?"

6566436,alanexpup,2021-06-04 09:43:00,278,"Hi. I am thankful I did not get 1 5 pound walleye and 1 11 pound northern. In the walleye box were 10 fillets separately vacuumed sealed in plastic. I would guess they were each about 10 inches long that had the skin on and were scaled just the way we like them. The 11 pound of northern had about 15 or so fillets roughly the same size but were not individually packed. These had no skin and the y bones were removed too. While these were packaged together they were not frozen in a lump but I could easily take 1 fillet out at a time. It was very well packaged with 2nd day delivery with quite a bit of dry ice still in the box. We are here in Henderson nevada, we are next to Las Vegas so it is quite hot. Unfortunately there is no lakes or water aroind here that includes northerns and walleyes. Lake mead behind Hoover dam has strippers and bass. Spell check I hate. It was supposed to be stripers not strippers although there could be some of them in the lake too. I remember they said going to Canada to fish cost about $100.00 a pound so this was a deal. when we lived in chicago we went to Canada for 30 years and then retired out here in vegas land 18 years ago. It’s too bad they don’t put some of these in lake mead. It was a long way to Canada from chicago and from here it’s just too far. I don’t want to be accused of advertising for anyone but if you google walleye something a couple names come up. At $200.00 the shipping is free. That is all I will say."
