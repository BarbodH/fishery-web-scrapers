One evening a Barred Owl was calling across the lake. It called a good 10 minutes before being answered by one on my side of the lake. Before long it was a magical sing along with 4 Barred's and an occasional Horned Owl hooing. Eventually after a good 3/4 of an hour it stopped and the loons kicked in. I will never forget that evening."

The thing that was most unusual on one of those trips was one particular loon that would follow my lure right back to the boat on numerous casts. We were casting to a shoal in clear water for smallmouth and that particular loon was right behind the lure coming back in every time. I'm sure glad he didn't take the bait because I had no desire to try to unhook a loon or leave a lure in one's beak. We left that shoal after a number of those follows. Would have been a great fight."
