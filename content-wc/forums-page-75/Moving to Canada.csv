6553660,Eyecatcher23,2021-04-23 12:16:00,383,"I had a place up there for a number of years. Although it felt like home, the thought never crossed my mind."
6553668,Wallychowder,2021-04-23 12:21:00,1567,If you marry a Canadian gal you would automatically become a Canadian citizen.
6553682,stumcfar,2021-04-23 13:10:00,451,I would love to have a place for the summer on the river somewhere between Golden Eagle Camp and Gold Pines on the edge of Ear Falls! I wouldn't want to be there all year though. I am from northern MN and the winters get long enough here the older I get.
6553688,Snowball,2021-04-23 13:21:00,28,"According to Google:In both the U.S. and Canada, there is no automatic right to permanent residence or citizenship just because you are married. All benefits must be applied for. Many people do not realize this, and may simply start living in the other country."
6553706,Shellback,2021-04-23 13:46:00,8083,"Not me, winters are too cold and long."
6553714,Wawajake,2021-04-23 13:59:00,413,"I live in Canada, but I would chose to live in USA (Maine maybe) before I would ever chose to live in Toronto or Vancouver ! Toronto is the armpit of Canada in my eyes. Nope I will stay in small town Northern Ontario thanks."
6553718,Wallychowder,2021-04-23 14:04:00,1567,How's Winnipeg ?
6553720,7 Mag,2021-04-23 14:07:00,1887,"In the summer, yes, after Oct 1st I'd be heading South."
6553732,muskyed,2021-04-23 14:23:00,727,"Keep in mind the costs of living there, with a U.S. income. Also are you allowed to get SS if living out of country? And what about medical? From what I hear, their medical isn't all it's cracked up to be. Then the big one, taxes. Quite honestly, there are so many great places to fish and live in the US, you could never get me to even remotely consider a move to Canada. I had a place just north of Eagle River Wi. for 16 or so years, and lived full time in it for 11 years. I can't tell you how many people I met that vacationed there 1-2 weeks a year, and thought it would be heaven to retire and move to there. Almost always, within 1-2 years, their place would be up for sale when they realized that other than fishing, snowmobiling and sitting in the bars, there wasn't really much else to offer. I don't see the need to actually live in a city when retiring, but having one within a half hour or so drive is a real plus."
6553742,Eckohlt,2021-04-23 14:51:00,3685,"Living here in the good ole usa you never know from day to day if a bullet is going to take you out as you go about your own business,n.w Ontario not so much to wry about,so I'll take n.w Ontario to live in a heart beat,the older I get the more I like winter so that's a good place to be,that's why I'm hoping the border is open for a late fall October fishing trip,love pounding on the eyes in cold weather.But hope it opens up earlier also"
6553618,Bigtaproot,2021-04-23 11:00:00,900,"To everyone living in the United States, Would you move to Canada if you could? Although I like spending a week each year up there fishing it is to cold and isolated for me. Toronto and Vancouver seem like you could have a life but, outside of that, it is not the place for me."
6553624,Eckohlt,2021-04-23 11:11:00,3685,"If I could,in a heart beat,for my wife I don't think so"
6553626,v-bay gord,2021-04-23 11:12:00,3168,I know people who live in Dryden that think Vermilion Bay is too far away. You question is rather general. Obviously Toronto and Vancouver are the only places where we don't live in igloos year round.
6553628,pjshorthorn,2021-04-23 11:15:00,5654,"In a heartbeat. I wouldn't be married after making that decision, but I told the wife that after she was gone I'd take the kids to Canada and sell worms and minnows. Her response was.......over my dead body. My response was .....you would be dead....you wouldn't know. I could live in Canada without a problem......the further off the grid the better. PjShorthorn"
6553632,yoopertrout,2021-04-23 11:16:00,1172,I would certainly think about it. The fishing is that much better.
6553634,Eckohlt,2021-04-23 11:18:00,3685,"I'm with you PJ the deeper into the jungle,the farther away from the bullets flying around here in the states"
6553642,kswalleyer,2021-04-23 11:50:00,1651,"NO, Ill visit, leave lotsa money, but not live there."
6553644,kswalleyer,2021-04-23 11:51:00,1651,"NO, Ill happily visit, leave lotsa money, but not live there. On another note, every time I head north to go ice fishing, my wife reminds me ""You are going the wrong way ...the beach is that way"" she has a point..."
6553646,Shortline,2021-04-23 11:52:00,234,"If a guy could find a gal that would be on board with it, then yes. Absolutely. As a single guy, living remotely with only smaller towns around, I think it would get awful lonely after a short while."
6553650,MrSimon,2021-04-23 12:01:00,922,Nope. But I sure do love to visit!!
