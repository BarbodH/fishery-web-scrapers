6564688,Eckohlt,2021-05-29 17:55:00,3685,"Your leading a good lockdown ccr,hope your out of the ankle bracelet soon"
6564694,RichA$1970,2021-05-29 18:02:00,1159,Well I’m heading 3 miles south of the border off Gunflindt trail to camp and fish next weekend as what I continue to read makes 2022 more the reality. Sucks but can’t wait for moving goalposts.
6564696,Eckohlt,2021-05-29 18:06:00,3685,"Good luck rich,give the report when you return.Maybe the goalposts will move a few inches while your away"
6564708,RichA$1970,2021-05-29 18:57:00,1159,Thanks Eck and just be away paddling and a pup tent will be a great distraction. Hopefully we can meet in Red Lake in Sept or Ignace I. October.
6564650,Wallychowder,2021-05-29 14:38:00,1567,LOL. sorry i thought it was up off 502 somewhere......LOL.
6564662,stjoeguy,2021-05-29 15:21:00,979,"Not optimistic, but probably realistic."
6564664,Eckohlt,2021-05-29 15:33:00,3685,Wish I was eating a cold piece of broiled fish driving up the 502 now
6564666,Guest,2021-05-29 16:11:00,0,"From the link. "" All retail stores are closed. Aisles with non-grocery items in Wal-mart are roped off to prevent non-essential shopping. "" If I was a Ontario resident, I would be very worried. Not so much from the fear of getting sick but fear from the province or country being unable to function after being attacked with a less than 2% mortality biological weapon. May be their style of health care system is their Achilles heal."
6564668,Wallychowder,2021-05-29 16:22:00,1567,And you know this how ???? Can you show me that the Retail stores are closed ????
6564670,Eckohlt,2021-05-29 16:23:00,3685,"Mike they will be fine,they all have to wear ankle bracelets and are chained to a bed post and fed bread n water twice a day,for extra torture they are all required to watch 2 hrs of fishing videos a day"
6564674,Wallychowder,2021-05-29 16:24:00,1567,Greens is open !!!
6564676,prov1800,2021-05-29 16:28:00,5010,Great write up.About says ìt.Personally leaning toward Sept and get 4-6 weeks of guiding in.
6564678,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2021-05-29 17:00:00,240,"I just retired this year and was so looking forward to a fall fishing trip. If it does open in September, I will be going somewhere, for sure. I had my eye on a trip to Birch Bark Lodge, north of Pickle Lake. I know my own wants and desires to go fishing in Canada are small potatoes, though, when I read articles/lodge reports like the one forwarded by Jesse in Wisconsin. Personally, I have banking my Canada dollars since last year, and I am planning on 3-4 trips the first summer we can cross the border. The border is going to be crazy busy once the ball drops, and we can safely return."
6564680,Eckohlt,2021-05-29 17:05:00,3685,"I hope to fish from sun up to sundown for those 4 to 6 weeks straight,I'll probably lose my wife my job my home my bank account,but man it will be worth every bite of that fresh eye"
6564592,Bakefish,2021-05-29 08:36:00,1077,Part of the reason I come to the Canada board is to see the latest info on the border. Why does it seem like every single thread about this subject gets the axe? How about just deleting the offensive (offensive to who?) posts or banning the offending members? This place is becoming a wasteland of drivel.
6564598,MikeAnkeny,2021-05-29 09:05:00,67,Heard that Lac Seul Lodge is shutdown till July 31. Owners are US.
6564610,BrianinVA,2021-05-29 09:56:00,160,"+100 The threads aren't even offensive or political and they get deleted. Time and time and time again this forum demonstrates civil conversations can happen around the border and the unmentionable communicable disease, but yet mods seem hellbent on deleting everything. We get it, being a mod is a thankless job  but please realize that every time you delete thoughtful posts and innocuous threads you are slowly driving posters and lurkers away and killing this forum."
6564612,Bakefish,2021-05-29 09:56:00,1077,If it weren't for the unnamed disease I would be driving up 105 just about now.
6564632,Eckohlt,2021-05-29 11:45:00,3685,This fall you can drive up it
6564636,Bakefish,2021-05-29 12:49:00,1077,I already have reservations
6564638,Eckohlt,2021-05-29 13:01:00,3685,Where you headed broiledfish?
6564642,Wallychowder,2021-05-29 13:26:00,1567,where's broiledfish ?
6564644,Eckohlt,2021-05-29 13:42:00,3685,Broiledfish is in the restaurant
