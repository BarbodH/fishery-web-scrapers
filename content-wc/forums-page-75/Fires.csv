6561800,rather-be-fishin,2021-05-18 21:53:00,429,Thoughts & Prayers for Ted & all in danger from forest fires.
6561812,RichA$1970,2021-05-19 03:17:00,1159,Good luck and hope all stays safe. Sad thing is I wonder if any owners would prefer the insurance money to offset a lack of revenue as many have been backed in a financial nightmare corner.
6561820,Pooch,2021-05-19 04:00:00,4618,"I wish Ontario had some of this rain that we seem to have in abundance here in Central Illinois. I figure that one of these days it will stop and then not rain again until too late for crops. Right now we are looking at drowned out areas of new plantings.We've had over seven inches in the last couple weeks. That would go a long ways to reducing the fire hazards in Ontario and help raise water levels.I hope the above insurance money thoughts do not come to pass, though I had the same thought even before the 2021 fire season started.Seems nothing but dark news out of Ontario anymore. That will change for the better given time and effort. Good people those north of the border folks are.Pooch"

6562672,Fisherman Ted,2021-05-22 08:20:00,461,No idea. Probably a lightening strike.

6562740,Fisherman Ted,2021-05-22 13:18:00,461,I checked on the lodge this morning. But we still cant get back in yet
6564590,PA troutguy,2021-05-29 08:31:00,58,"Ted, here in PA the 17 year Cicadas are out and the woods are buzzing 24 seven. Tried using them for trout and they ignored them, not sure if anything consumes them other than Cicada killers which pray on the larva when they are in the ground."
