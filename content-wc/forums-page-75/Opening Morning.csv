This morning we are unable to give any reports on the fish bite or catches. *At 7 a.m. this morning, the most activity on the lake were two ducks swimming out in front of camp and I did see one fish break the surface in the middle of the bay, most likely whitefish or a smaller lake trout. *Hopefully everyone is in good spirits waiting for the day we all can be on the water again as it is coming as it is just a matter of time. *After our stay at home order is lifted, we are looking forward to doing a little fishing and providing an update and maybe a picture or two! In closing, we want to thank everyone for their kind words and support.* Without this encouragement, I honestly don't know if we would have the strength to move through these difficult times.* It is the hope, the phone calls, and the emails that gives us the drive and positive spirit to work forward during these times. THANK YOU! Happy Day Lodge / Prairie Bee Camps Bob"

6561158,Fishquest,2021-05-16 16:26:00,89,The odds are coming across the border they will have to do a 14 day stay at home order as part of being allowed into the country to run their business. So that would mean no fishing and while I believe it would be a safe thing to do it would just take one person to report them and cost them a lot of money with fines for ignoring stay at home order. I'm only guessing this is why so they can get over it and on with business.
