6565074,Canadian fisher,2021-05-31 13:07:00,97,Small world. I sent my parents there 27 years ago for their 25th anniversary. They loved your resort. I guarantee I could rattle off a 1/2 dozen names we would both know. NW Ontario is a pretty special place. The shield country in general is magical. Have a good one!
6565078,prov1800,2021-05-31 13:12:00,5010,We had a cottage first near south end then the resort.Great times there summer and winter.Diffentky know a lot of oeople in them days.
6565082,Eckohlt,2021-05-31 13:23:00,3685,"Invernessfalls resort looks like it's a 5 star place john,did you build all the structures there?"
6565086,prov1800,2021-05-31 13:37:00,5010,My dad and I diď a lot of building there.As well as a lot of private cabin jobs during the winters.Great memories of that area
6566238,alanexpup,2021-06-03 21:06:00,278,How about leaches then?
6566282,kzoofisher,2021-06-04 03:15:00,5144,"Manitoba is proposing a ban of aquatic live bait harvest and use effective April 1, 2027:  includes live bait fish and leeches  does not include night crawlers or frogs"
6564672,kzoofisher,2021-05-29 16:24:00,5144,Like just about everything is changing from fees to seasons to sizes to live bait ban.https://www.manitoba.ca/fish-wildlif...g_strategy.pdf
6564682,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2021-05-29 17:08:00,240,"Have been expecting/dreading the live bait ban for some time now. Still being able to use crawlers and salties will be welcome, but even those options are going to die a slow death in years to come. Just hoping there's some way to continue to use locally trapped minnows when in Canada, though."
6564690,prov1800,2021-05-29 17:57:00,5010,Manitoba has always had the no live minnows since I was a kid.You could trap them but had to be dead to use.Ontario you can use live bait.
6564692,Eckohlt,2021-05-29 17:57:00,3685,"Free minnows at Clarks,unlimited supply"
6564704,kzoofisher,2021-05-29 18:43:00,5144,"Those anglers in possession of purchased live bait fish must have a Live Bait Fish Transfer and Use Receipt issued by the dealer. Anglers may catch their own bait fish, but must kill them before transporting them away from the water where they were caught. Live minnows are not currently banned in some parts of the Province."
6564720,KC Walleye,2021-05-29 20:15:00,274,"Not sure that is completely accurate. We used live bait for years on Winnipeg before the recent changes. Now I believe can still use live bait, just can't transport it off the lake? Been a few years since I have been up there unfortunately, so a touch fuzzy."
6564896,Canadian fisher,2021-05-30 16:16:00,97,Its not accurate at all. Grew up fishing in MB with live bait. The last change is you have to dump it once leaving. Still legal to use.
6565044,prov1800,2021-05-31 10:21:00,5010,Did most of my fishing in the Whiteshell Provincial Park since in lived in the park.Absolutly no live minnow bait there.
6565062,Canadian fisher,2021-05-31 12:15:00,97,"Thats correct Prov1800. Always a few exceptions such as a provincial park like the whiteshell. However a lot of the major popular fishing areas like the Red river, Lake Winnipeg you can use live bait. They sell a ton. One of the complaints from those harvesters is that they will have to find new jobs if the new regs for 2023 go into law. You are a lucky man if you grew up in the Whiteshell. Gorgeous area!"
6565068,prov1800,2021-05-31 12:59:00,5010,Agreed We owned Inverness Falls on Brereton.Beautifull for sure but much nicer here in NWO.
