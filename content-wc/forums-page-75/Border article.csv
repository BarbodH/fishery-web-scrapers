6566150,BrianinVA,2021-06-03 17:07:00,160,This is a thread about the status of the border and not a place to discuss the merits of vaccination. Mods have been very patience with threads this week and the forum is beginning to once again show signs of life because of it. Let's please try to stay on subject so we can continue to discuss the evolving border situation. Thank you.

6565194,Wawajake,2021-05-31 18:31:00,413,"Well Obabikan I realize you have reasons to be passionate about these things.....but you're all over the map on the NHL aspect....the league came up with a plan that far exceeds health care protocols here and way more than what other USA sports teams are doing. And they are paying for it all ......and the millions of Canadians that watch hockey, and are locked in our bubbled life for now , are appreciative that this plan was made and is working well. Tonight in a Toronto stadium that normally seats over 20,000 ...there is just 550 fully vaccinated health care workers in the stands ( free tickets paid for by Toronto Maple leafs as appreciation for their hard work)... I think that is great and a first step towards normality you and I want. Now I would think that someone that otherwise spends as much time as you in Canada, you would see the need for the NHL in our lives and to lead the pack towards normalcy. Go Bruins Go !!!"
6565202,Canadian fisher,2021-05-31 18:38:00,97,"Well said Wawa! I believe the NHL is loosing over a billion dollars by having a season. There reasoning is its helps people cope in these dark times. Right now in MB and Ontario we can't see anybody and in MB you can't even meet outside at somebodies place. People are loosing their minds. The text threads have been great lately and it has been said more than once ""at least we have playoff hockey to watch""!! Just to note the players in Canada have not jumped the line for vaccinations. Other than practices and playing actual games they pretty much have been following the rules like everybody else."

CDN NHL playoffs will not need to have American teams cross border until mid June at best, because another best of 7 playoff series of just CDN teams still doesn't start till end of this week. .....So by the time that series is over all CDN teams applicable will be vaccinated. .....also all players are still to be tested EVERY DAY !!! .....and when they do finally meet an American team they are required to remain in hotel bubble . .....Now ideally it will be the Boston Bruins beating the CDN team 4 straight games at end of June.....and then it will be all remaining games in USA , with more than just a handful of fans in stands.

Just because they can afford it? So... the rich people should be allowed to move about, while those of us who work for a living shouldn't? Not ok. I don't give two CRAPS if they are tested 5 times a day, it is incredibly biased, and total BS. If the average ""non-essential"" business/person does not have the option... neither should the NHL."

6564992,kzoofisher,2021-05-31 07:23:00,5144,Very nice story. The Optic looks like the same idea as the live target glass minnows they sell today. And at a similar inflation adjusted price!

And I still have the old Johnson Century reels which were our 'starter reels' back in the early 70's. We bought our fishing tackle from Gamble's and the Holiday gas stations back in the day.... Also brings back memories of my first trip to Canada in 1983. Wintering Lake, on Highway 599 out of Ignace. Fisherman's Camp, if I remember. $125 for 7 days. Primitive rain gear, blue jeans, and old shirts. Just about froze to death on some of those days out in the boat. But we loved it. And, man, the midnight fish fries with ice cold Stroh's were heaven on earth. The aforementioned Abu Matics and cheap rods were a far cry from the high dollar Guidewear, St. Croix Rods, and Abu Garcia Revo reels now in use. But most of us remember those old days with very fond memories."

6565104,KC Walleye,2021-05-31 15:16:00,274,Comical for sure. They aren't all vaccinated guaranteed. They do get tested daily still I believe. If I get tested daily for a few weeks can I get in? It's all a joke. God forbid they can't have home ice advantage.......play at neutral sites in a bubble and avoid controversy....even tho that still creates some.
6564816,Fisherman Ted,2021-05-30 10:22:00,461,"Those are the very rare minority. Doesn't matter if you are a doctor, or lodge owner or Canadian or American. If you are lucky enough to be able to cross now there are very strict regulations both to cross and when you get here. And if you don't abide by those rules the penalties are stiff. Show up without a test, don't quarantine, test in a wrong country....$4,000 fine. On the spot. My chef who is Canadian flew out of her winter country in the Caribbean. She tested before she got on the plane. I picked her up at the airport in Minneapolis and we hit the border in I-Falls. Because she set foot in the U.S. her test (just 18 hours earlier) was invalid and she was fined 4k, even as a Canadian citizen. Show up without a negative test, fine. Fly in and don't go to the hotel (which costs 2k) 4k. Its crazy. But if your point is that there are so many people going back and forth at will without having to do any of these things that may be true for some small fraction of those lucky enough to cross. But when that border opens up for good with hundreds of thousands crossing if you think initially you can walk right in without any proof of a vaccination I would argue you are way off base. -FT"
6564818,elway12,2021-05-30 10:23:00,335,"I also see the vaccination rate going up about 1% per day which means by middle of June that would at-least meet that goal. My biggest worry is how a ""quicker"" border opening doesn't mesh with Ontario's reopening plan As far as the issue of proof of vaccination - I would think they would continue to use the ArriveCAN app/portal, It would seem to be an easy way the government verify and tell people to download their vaccination information."
6564894,Canadian fisher,2021-05-30 16:13:00,97,You guys need to read local Canadian news. The border is not opening in June. The interprovincial border with Ontario is closed in both directions to June 16TH. Its great to stay positive but need to be realistic at the same time.
6564902,wallypod,2021-05-30 16:36:00,21,Going to make for some interesting press in coming weeks. First Ministers control provincial borders but Prime Minister controls international borders.

6564936,elway12,2021-05-30 20:57:00,335,I agree. I don't know Canadian law/government as it would pertain to who has authority over who. I would assume a PM has more power than the provincial government. Hopefully they would work hand in hand at an agreeable solution.

6564786,MN_Moose,2021-05-30 09:26:00,964,The article states a threshold of 75% of Canadians vaccinated with at least one dose. I checked and it appears currently at 56%. Some reports of progress of 1% per day. I'm hopeful of maybe end of August / Sept 1.
6564788,Guest,2021-05-30 09:31:00,0,"}}There's a decent chance of ""proof of vaccination"" being enough to allow tourism.{{ As much as I wish for that hope to come true, I feel doubtful. Canadas actions so far seems to support the view that the rest of the world is full of Zombies. What system of ID will be needed/ accepted for proof of vaccination to satisfy the respective authorities? Last year in one of the many deleted threads on the subject, I mentioned that there is no National/ World data base for the vaccinated and that counterfeit IDs would become easily available, if required to live a normal life. The counterfeit IDs are all over the internet now and increased in numbers as soon as some authorities/locations started offering incentives to vaccinate to be able to participate in some public and outdoor venues. Easily predicted and really FUBAR . I hope I am wrong in my views and everyone gets to where they want to go."
6564792,That Minnesota guy,2021-05-30 09:32:00,8293,I haven't read anything from anybody that matters that says otherwise.
6564794,kzoofisher,2021-05-30 09:33:00,5144,At that rate they'll pass 75% first dose by 6/1 and be at 90% on 6/26. Wishing the best for all our CA friends.

6564806,Fisherman Ted,2021-05-30 09:50:00,461,"They don't do it now because 1. the border is closed and 2. those that have an exemption to cross have to show proof of a negative test beforehand, quarantine for 2 weeks in Canada and take 2 tests during that time (plus daily health checkins). Once that all goes away you can bet you will have to show proof of vaccination just like much of the world is starting to do."
6564812,That Minnesota guy,2021-05-30 09:56:00,8293,There are people crossing in and out of Canada everyday that don't do any of the above you mention. I'm going to leave it at that.

6564764,Obabikon,2021-05-30 07:29:00,2370,"Being that it was a meeting with Minister Bill Blair, who is in charge of the border.... it is more significant than one Mayor's opinion. It by no means is an indicator that it WILL open. However, these are the types of meetings that should have been going on months ago. I'm still not optimistic it will be open in the next 30 days. However, I am getting more optimistic that it will be opened in 60 days."
6564776,Obabikon,2021-05-30 09:01:00,2370,"I will also add that I believe that ""unvaccinated"" will be the last phase of the opening. There's a decent chance of ""proof of vaccination"" being enough to allow tourism. I'm trying to stay positive (but it has certainly been hard for the past year)."
