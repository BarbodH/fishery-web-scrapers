I'm located less than 3 hrs from Fort Francis so it is an easy trip for me and I usually cross in the middle of the week. I recently took a trip to Hawaii and was required to have a negative 3 day test to avoid a quarantine. Hawaii had a website registration that I had to post my test info to and I received an email copy of the test results. The test process was easy. I stopped by the local Covid testing center and only had to wait for about 5 mins. They preformed the test and I got my results the next afternoon about 36 hours later via email. When we arrived in Kona we exited the plane I showed them the test confirmation on my phone, they took my temp and I was on my way. One of the guys who regularly goes on our several annual trips says he will never take a test or get vaxed so I guess he's out till the border crossing has no Covid protocols."

I think the digital covid pass seems to make the most sense in terms of gaining access. This would certify that either someone had the vaccine or a negative test just prior to crossing. Keep in mind there is no standardized vaccine pass in the states. All states have something slightly different and there are many different locations doing the vaccines also, so something would have to be done to standardize that. Then the other thing that has to get worked out for Canada is the quarantine issue. Unlikely that most would be willing to do a 3-7 day quarantine for a 5-7 day trip. That is unless the front seat of my boat works as a location to do said quarantine. Despite all of these hurdles.. this is clearly the most reasonable and good news we have heard since about March of 2020 regarding the border situation. I think I can have my gear loaded in about 6 hours.. I wont need much in the way of sleeping quarters.. a good recliner with a roof over my head will do. Keep me posted.."

The Health Canada proposed land border framework also specifically calls for a PCR test for entry. Hopefully they will considering allowing antigen tests given the lower price and greater availability. Thank you for keeping threads alive.

To happen, they will have to accept the CDC Vaccination Record Card as proof of vaccination and a negative lab-based PCR test. I don't see how else they can accomplish this within the next few weeks. Without the test, a more complex system will need to be implemented to verify proof of vaccination. That won't happen in months, let alone weeks. Once enough of Canada is fully vaccinated, they will loosen the required negative test and eventually even the vaccination records. Assuming we avoid a fourth wave."

To be clear, I hope that I am wrong, however, this all just seems unlikely. Furthermore, while I can't speak for other states, Ohio is not just going to give me a free Covid test if I have no symptoms or reason to get one especially as I'm already vaccinated. So unless there's a change in the availability of testing and the insurance coverage of non-essential tests, any contingency related to a medical test for COVID-19 is going to be problematic. Take care, Ruddiger"
6567148,BrianinVA,2021-06-07 06:56:00,160,"Self-test kits are now available OTC and testing clinics are everywhere. It's not going to be free, but the self-test kits are very affordable and will get cheaper as more enter the marketplace. Plus the proposed framework suggested that tests should be available on arrival to the border so folks wouldn't necessarily need to do their own test ahead of time. It's important to note that all of this is a proposed framework at the moment and there is no guarantee that this is how things will eventually be implemented. As you mention, the public health situation in Canada will ultimately determine timing of things. It's also important to note that we don't know what the requirements to reenter the US via land border might look like. Below is the proposed recommendations for fully vaccinated non-exempt travellers to Canada:acceptable proof, as defined by the Government of Canada, of authorized vaccination and that sufficient time has passed after the final dose in the vaccine seriesno pre-departure test, quarantine requirement or day 7 testfor surveillance purposes, PCR test on arrival at the border testing station (for land border crossing, a home-sampling kit may be used)"

6566744,BrianinVA,2021-06-05 11:34:00,160,Canadians can currently fly to the US but Americans can't fly to Canada at the moment. So there is precedent for an unilateral opening.
6566746,elway12,2021-06-05 11:50:00,335,I too have been concerned on how the Provincial reopening plans/phases would affect the border reopening. I would assume the feds can overrule the provinces if push came to shove? or they would try to work out a compromise. As far as the US requiring a test to return. The CDC guidelines allow rapid tests & results as long as they are verified thru a provider. You can get them in the US and bring the test kit into Canada with you. See the CDC guidelines. I know it's still a looong shot(maybe 20%) but I am still holding out hope for the border to be safely reopened by July 8th.
6566750,Wallychowder,2021-06-05 12:09:00,1567,Canadians have been able to fly into the US for many months now.

I don’t want to discuss this, I am just sharing information that I am hearing. That is what it is going to take to be in the first wave of crossers. They probably will eventually open up to everyone, but that could be a few months down the road.Again all of this is rumors, but there is increasing pressure for a semi-opened border.

I have also read the rumors for fully and partially vaccinated people going to Canada My worry is what restrictions may be in place still on a provincial level. Doesn't Ontario still have restrictions on a campsite or cabin rental, only people from the same house hold may occupy it? I had read that somewhere. When are they lifted or relaxed? Hate to be a party pooper, but they are certainly considerations with the level of virus problems they still have in Ontario and Manitoba."
6566642,Eyesore,2021-06-05 02:51:00,455,"Am I reading this correctly that people who have been inoculated with the 'vaccine"" but test positive with the chicom flu will not be permitted to cross.

6566662,BrianinVA,2021-06-05 05:16:00,160,"Just remember that crossing into Canada is only half the battle as a negative test is also currently required to reenter the US. The easy part would be getting a test state-side. Administering tests to thousands of fishermen who all want to cross back into the US on the same day (or two) of the week is not something NW Ontario is equipped to handle at the moment. And even if the infrastructure can be put in place, the added costs and hoops that have to be jumped through would be a hurdle too high for many. Remember the fallout when passports started being required to cross the border? Not trying to be Debbie Downer here, just trying to highlight some of the challenges ahead. Hopefully NW Ontario can rise to the occasion."
6566676,Obabikon,2021-06-05 06:09:00,2370,"Several excellent questions and comments. Hereâ€&#x2122;&#xfe0f;s what I understandâ€¦Premier Ford is expected to put Ontario into stage one opening plan sometime before June 14. Cabin rentals will be allowed, and resorts will be opened provincewide in that stage.I understand false positives, and other concerns over testing. However COVID-19 is a specific strain, and you must test positive for COVID-19 to come up with a positive result.As a returning citizen, the United States cannot legally reject or deny re-entry. They might be requiring a Covid test for noncitizens to enter. I do not believe this is going to be an issue for returning. I will also add that a negative test alone is not going to get you into Canada. It will require full vaccination.One additional issue is children. At what age will they be allowed to cross without being vaccinated? That is not something I have heard anyone address.Letâ€&#x2122;&#xfe0f;s try to keep emotions and politics out of this thread. Great job so far!"

Also from the diehards that miss it so much. Then the groups that get turned around because of a positive test from one person in the vehicle, improper testing info, hours and hours of wait time to cross, etc.....all at no fault of the Border, will be the final straw for many never to return and decide to enjoy our many resources in the US with little to no hassles or inconvenience.I sure can't wait to get back up and am hoping for the best, but don't hop in line hungry with a full bladder. Double the waiting times would be lucky I'm guessing. I hope to find out shortly."

""The Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) requires all air passengers entering the United States (including U.S. citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents) to present a negative COVID-19 test, taken within three calendar days of departure or proof of recovery from the virus within the last 90 days.""
