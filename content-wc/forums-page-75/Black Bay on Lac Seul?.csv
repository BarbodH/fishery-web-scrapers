Lac Seul Lodge has an outpost cabin somewhere in Black Bay, but I don't know where. I've seen a cabin on the north side of Aldous that is an area that could be called a bay though did not motor up to it a few years ago. This cabin was closer to the main lake area. Could have been a locals cabin? Just curious as I've fished that area several times and not noticed an outpost type of cabin. Pooch"
