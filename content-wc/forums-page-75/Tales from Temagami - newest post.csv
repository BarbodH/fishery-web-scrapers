Was a real treat to chat with Mike and his experience doing fly ins from Temgami to Nakinahttps://www.northernjacks.com/post/tales-from-temagami Cheers Andrew"

I sure hope the politicians make the opening of the border to us from the US a reality. Thanks to Andrew for helping us dream until it happens. Love the Tales series! Hooks"

6569162,pjshorthorn,2021-06-12 09:03:00,5654,Rustle up a contract for review. One contingency that has to be in the contract is that I get to rename the lodge.... PjShorthorn
6569338,HeHooksHimself,2021-06-13 05:58:00,725,"How about ""Irish Flamingos in Yoga Pants"" ?"
6569400,pjshorthorn,2021-06-13 09:50:00,5654,"Hooks, I definitely think you put some very deep thought into a new lodge name, some of which may or may not be pertinent, but as written I would say that is a hard no. Now as far as Yoga Pants, Gord may donate some of his YPs whereby they could be flown from the top of the fish cleaning house so everyone knows what the wind direction is every morning before loading up their boat.
