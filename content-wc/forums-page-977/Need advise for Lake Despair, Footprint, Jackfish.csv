517716,Guest,2002-03-02 16:53:00,0,I am going to fish the Lake Despair chain of lakes in June for Smallies and pike. Any advise as far as location or lure selection or even any lakes in the area that are strong. Also How is the fishing in the Northwest side of Rainey? Thank you for your helpBow
517717,Guest,2002-03-05 19:49:00,0,"Fished lake Despair and that chain for several years. Never fished for smallies or norhern very much though. We always caught a few by accident. It seemed like footprint was ok for smallies just south of the entrance to the mile river. There was always alot of pike at Panorama but you had to work to get there. Loonhaunt was pretty good for smallies and pike , but that was another portage. Another place the guides always said ther were big smallies was behind the south portage. As far as tackle all anyone seemed to use ther were rigs. Found that Bob Baker and Jerry were the best guides we came across around there."
