517453,Walleye Guy,2002-02-21 09:33:00,49,Hi GuysLooking for a new line to switch too - I have heard fire is good but is it worth the exspense - what would you suggest for fishing walleye and pike also what test of line?Thanks
517454,Guest,2002-02-21 09:43:00,0,"Try power proIf you are using it for walleyes on a spinnign outfit, try 8/30 or even the 12lb. I have been using the 12 for a few years and have had no problems. I think it is 12/50. Anyway for northerns you could try 16/60. The stuff just doesnt break. Stay away from fireline. it sucks. If you want to try a mono, try excalibur. That is the strongest mono i have ever tried. It will stretch a little but not that much. I use it for jig fishing in the trees and so forth and have never had it break using 20lb. I have used it for northern too and was very impressed. I would also look at p-line xtra strong. I use the premium on spinning reels and love it. You can straighten out a jig hook with 8lb. I am going to try the xtra strong this year for jigging. I always have to try something new, even though the old works just as well. Hope this helps"

I have also used 14/6 for heavier jigs or for pike. The sensitivity is fantastic. You also won't lose as many lures when you snag up because you can straighten the hooks with this stuff. Just don't try to pull it lose with your hands because it will cut you. Use a 3/4"" dowel or broomstick handle and wrap the line around it a few times, then pull. Try the Flame Green. It si much easier to see and doesn't seem to bother the fish. Good Luck!Fred"
517456,Wawajake,2002-02-21 12:31:00,413,"I agree Fred , Fireline is great for jigging and trolling I have used it for 5 years now and only need to change or reverse line on reel every few years. Palomar knot is a must though on jigs and loose drag.Confidence in feel and reading bottom is best part jake"
517457,Walleye Guy,2002-02-21 12:49:00,49,I am kind of new to this fishing thing - what is the difference between mono and fire line - is it more sensitive?I need a course in line types please.
517458,RANGER,2002-02-21 13:06:00,4341,"Fireline, Spider line, Power Pro and other braided lines are totally different then mono is and are made of ""Space Age"" materials that happened into our sport. This thread is running on the ""General Discussion"" forum and may help you even more:https://www.walleyecentral.com/dcf/ge...ion/14842.html"
517459,Guest,2002-03-06 08:34:00,0,"I've been using 10 pound Fireline for two years now. I use it for pike walleye and smallmouth. Haven't needed anything heavier. I tried Spiderwire Fusion last year and lost three new cranks in fifteen minutes. This year I am trying 4 pound on my ultralight for smallmouth, trout and perch."
517460,Guest,2002-03-07 12:38:00,0,I have been using fire line for the past 4 years. I would not use anything different. I like how the flourecent yellow fades to white after time. I can see my line much better. When I feel the fish don't like my line I tie on a leader of mono. No problems...
517461,Guest,2002-03-07 22:01:00,0,"I've been using fireline for the last three years and am not ready to switch yet. When pulling rapalas you can feel the even vibration of the lure and know that you're not tugging extra weedage along.With the mono stuff this is not so easy to feel.One thing i've learned is to re-tie as needed when jigging in rocky areas as the line does show abrasion fray down near the lure.And yes, the palomar knot is the way to go. Fished a lodge in Canada last summer when a few boatloads of Berkley reps showed up. They had real bright looking equipment with all reels filled with the flourescent yellow fireline. 7 out"
