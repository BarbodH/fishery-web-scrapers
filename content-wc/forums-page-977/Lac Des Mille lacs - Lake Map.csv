517640,PJM,2002-02-27 16:03:00,3516,My map was ruined last year and I am looking for a new or more updated map. The one I had looked like it was from the 70tys.
517641,Guest,2002-02-27 16:19:00,0,There is a new OMNR sponsered updated depth map that will be available to the public in the next 6 months. It is a major improvement. I'll post when it becomes available and where to purchase it from.

517643,Guest,2002-03-07 17:23:00,0,I would be interested in a map for this lake also. I will be there the first week of July. I would love to have a decent depth map. Thanks for any help that comes my way.
