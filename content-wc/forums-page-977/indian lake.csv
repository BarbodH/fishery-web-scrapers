518002,Seanik,2002-03-08 18:28:00,218,"Fished Indian Lake in July of 2000 fly-in with Sudbury Aviation. Walleye bite early morning and before dark on rock faces with minnows. Walleyes small and not to plentiful, pike were scarce and small. There is a small Lake at the North end of Indian called Zack Lake. Larger Walleyes and Pike and they bit all day and worth the effort through the 200 yards of brushy creek entrance.If you need more info e-mail me at [email protected]"
