517823,Guest,2002-03-05 11:12:00,0,Anyone know any information about Canada highway 17 from Saulte Sainte Marie to Thunder Bay? Good road--bad road? Construction? Speed limit?
517824,Bucks Rogers,2002-03-05 13:29:00,43,"Hiway 17 is 2 - lane with lots of hills and curves. Pavement is good for most part. Can't speak for present construction, but typically most construction starts as soon snow stops and frost leaves ground. Very scenic trip, well worth the all the hills & curves. Speed limits range from 60 kph to 100 kph.Bucks"
517825,Wawajake,2002-03-05 13:42:00,413,"Yes I drive it a few times each year for business.It basically a 7 and a half or 8 hour drive from Sault to Thunderbay at slightly above speed limit.(Even with typical summer construction) Lots of big hills but a fair amount of passing lanes. View along Superior is fantastic.Half way point is roughly the town of Marathon , just short drive in for a few restaraunts other than typical ""on the highway"" ones . One note: very few gas stations between Sault and Wawa !Also highway in winter is closed numerous times when snow and wind off lake dictates (it closed this morning for 3 hours) jake"
517826,Guest,2002-03-05 14:47:00,0,I have driven the road countless times. Do yourself a favour and drive it in the daytime. The view is terrific and you get away from the night time critters and some of the big trucks.
517827,Guest,2002-03-06 00:20:00,0,Thanks for all the help--Is there any hotels along the way?
517828,Wawajake,2002-03-06 06:02:00,413,"Yes there is fair hotels in Wawa, Marathon, Terrace bay , Schrieber and Nipigon.jake"
517829,Guest,2002-03-06 08:17:00,0,Highway 17 - is the main road which spans Canada from Newfounland to Vancouver - it is an excellent road - if you are worried about trailering a boat - it will not be a problem - this is the trans Canada highway - the road is a bit twisty and hilly in that area but the road it self is paved and smooth - there are a lot of transports in this stretch - can be long if you get caught behind one of them - it is a two lane highway but there are plenty of passing lanes.
