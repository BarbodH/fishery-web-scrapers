517751,Steve,2002-03-05 00:01:00,259,"Were is the Cygnet lake you are talking about. I went to a Cygnet lake near Kenora back in the early 90s.Fishing was fair. Walleye (17-22 inches), northen (snake to 36""), few small smallies (less than 2 lbs). The road leading to the lake was long and gravel.Not very large body of water, easy to navigate.Basic reasonable lodging and everything worked.I think the folks that ran it were from Dubuque Iowa.Steve"
517752,Guest,2002-03-05 10:31:00,0,"I have been to Cygnet Lake many times. The people who were at the show just purchased the camp and this will be there first year running it. I have a great time every year up there and I hope it continues with the new owners. We catch lots of walleyes and the average size is 16"" to 18"" with a few bigger ones. It is a 3,347 acre lake and has several islands and many reefs that make finding fish fairly easy. If you want trophy fish it probably won't work for you. We have caught several 15lbs and larger northerns and have had some very good smallmouth fishing also. If you want any more info e-mail and I would be happy to help out."

517754,Guest,2002-03-05 14:03:00,0,"Steve, that is the lake that I was talking about. But it seems to me that their rates for a Motor home is more than double than the rates at other rv lots. so I think I'll look around a little more . thanks for the info. Mike S"
