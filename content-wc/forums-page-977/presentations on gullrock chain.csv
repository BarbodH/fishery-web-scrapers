The walleyes are usually in shallow river mouths or shallow bays, and in the process of moving into drop offs and structure. In the past i have used just a 1/4 jig head tipped with a minnow, and was wondering if any of you had any ideas or strategies that have worked for you. thanksps. cant wait to get on the lake with a cold labatts in hand.gracias por todoB.Nelson"
