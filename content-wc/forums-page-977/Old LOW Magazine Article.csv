517978,Guest,2002-03-07 11:53:00,0,"I am looking for a magazine article that was probably written about 1928-29 by Robert Page Lincoln. It may have been entitled A Fish On Every Cast. My father, who passed away last year at age 95, read this article and it started him going to Lake of the Woods to camp and fish in the late 1920's. The article included fishing Whitefish Bay, and perhaps Annie Island, Turtle Portage, and a guide named Oscar. I believe Lincoln wrote a number of stories on LOW: I have one on trout fishing, but have not been able to find the one in question. As a result of reading this story, Dad started a fishing tradition that has been handed on down to me and later to my son. Included in that tradition has been innumerable stories and pictures of the old days. Dad's last trip was at age 92, when we camped and fished there together.I have recently retired and am in the process of writing a book on Dad's early camping and fishing experiences and being able to read the article in question would really help tie up some loose ends. I have contacted Field & Stream, Sports Afield, and the Fishing Hall of Fame with no success. I am hoping that perhaps someone on WC is a collector of old magazines and would be willing to look in their collection and let me read the article.Sorry for the long post. Email me or post for additional information.Bill KrejcaCedar Rapids, Ia[email protected]"
