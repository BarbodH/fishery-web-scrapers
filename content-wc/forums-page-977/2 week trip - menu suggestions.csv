Make a big pot and have it a couple of days. The sauce can be stored indefinitely before you make the chowder so it can be a few meals at the end of the 2 weeks.1 large container of Prego spaghetti saucefish fillets cut into 1"" chunks- (6-8 walleye or pike fillets)couple slices of cheese (optional)other spices to tasteI would think that the weight of 2 weeks worth of food would be a problem on fly ins or just hauling all that extra food to your lodge. Here are a few things I've learned in shopping and planning over 30 trips to Canada. Try to minimize the weight by buying foods packaged in plastic rather than tin cans.Dried fruits are lightweight and won't spoil. Prepackaged soups that you just add water and serve are good. Use clean milk jugs with water frozen as your cooling agent and then drink the water at camp. Eat the foods that have a tendency to spoil first."
517956,Guest,2002-03-07 11:35:00,0,"We always take up a large half/whole ham(depending on the size of the group). This also helps to keep other foods cool during the trip up 'nort. It is usually thawed out after the first day. We throw it in the dutch oven and go fishing for several hours. There is nothing better than a Hillshire ham cooking in that Canadian air!! Anyways, the leftover ham always makes fantastic sandwiches for the boat....or ham and eggs in the morning...or au gratin potatoes and ham...or ham/cheese omelets.....or grilled cheese and ham sandwiches......dang, now it's time to go eat, I wonder what I'm going to have!?!?!?We even make an awesome bean soup with the bone!!!!"
517957,Guest,2002-03-08 20:45:00,0,"you can't beat the versatiltiy of a bag of a dozen frozen chicken breasts. You can use a half dozen and make a great jambalaya w/ them and substitute fresh fish for shrimp. Throw in the rice and peas or corn, a can of peeled tomatoes, garlic and cajun spices and you have a 1 pot meal. very healthy and easy. use the other half dozen to grill/ barbeque and you have 2 good meals. buy the frozen ones that are already skinned so all you have to do is thaw.another 1 pot meal is a 4-5 lb pre-cooked ham simmered in half a pot of water and throw in potatoes, carrots, cabbage, some peppercorns, a bay leaf or 2, and some ham seasoning you can buy in any grocery store. It's ready in an hour or 2. substitute turkey ham if you want to go a little healthier. you can even throw in some kielbassa and there you go. being both the camp cook and the one who spends the most time on the water, I've learned to do the 1 pot meals so I can spend as much time on the water and keep the troops happy."
517945,Paul H,2002-03-06 16:11:00,1232,Goin' North this year for two - weeks (with the wife) have done this for 15 years - but this is first time for two weeks. As usual will be eating a lot of fresh fish - though generally perch and release most walleye - but need some more variety.Will be 100 miles from a good grocery - small propane fridge and freezer - no problem for one week - but how do some of you guys vary the diet ? - eat way to much fried foods anyway - open to ideas and suggestions - Do the lunch meat sandwiches for lunch - always a big breakfast.Dinner varies from fish - smoked sausage - canned beef stew - steak maybe one or two times. On top of this - wedding anniversary is during this time. any ideas for something special ....
517946,Reels,2002-03-06 16:55:00,2876,"My wife premakes a big lasagna and feezes it. It helps keep the cooler cold, and its a no brainer for dinner, just toss it in the oven for an hour, and we make some of that pre made garlic bread with it.<{{}}><I wonder if she soaks it in milk or baking soda... ;-)"
517949,Guest,2002-03-06 17:02:00,0,for a change on the fish menue we have put alum foil on the grill put fish that has been soaked in lowarys marinaid poke fillets with fork for more flavor. simple but good. there are several flavors we like the one with dejon mustardenjoy
517951,Arkie eye jerker,2002-03-06 17:09:00,228,We spent a week on LOW a few years ago and used same guide everyday who would fix us a shore lunch. After the third day my wife asked Moon(the guide) if there was any other way he new to cook the fish. He smiled and said you bet. The next day he made a stir fry using the fish we had caught that morning. It was great.EnjoyEd Gray
517950,Paul H,2002-03-06 17:09:00,1232,Do similar - but use the broiler - most any walleye I keep get broiled - add some almonds and walleye almindine or however they spell it. - Luv Lasagana - but can't eat milk products -
517947,iamwalleye1,2002-03-06 17:13:00,1589,Wow reels we are looking for the same menu! 2 weeks! That sucks we have to stay for 2 weeks!

517952,Guest,2002-03-06 19:42:00,0,I miss fresh vegetables after a while when out in the bush so we bring them with us. They will last a while and then we get into the canned stuff. I prefer a chefs salad and items such as this over fryed this and that.It is a welcome break. Citrus fruits also last a great while in the cooler. Baked Potatoes in the fire are also great. I also grill over the fire rather than fry whenever possible. We generally have fish once a day and make a big bunch of it because it is great for snacking and putting on sandwiches for out in the boat.
517953,lobo1,2002-03-06 20:03:00,734,"Spaghetti/sauce, canned chicken whitemeat for pasta salad or casserole, take a smoked hock (keeps forever) or ham and make a pot of bean soup, bread and cake mixes, and supplies for a fish chowder.thats a start,lobo"
517954,Peanut,2002-03-07 08:37:00,929,"Menu suggestions, great question. We find that to add variety, some pre-cooking at home helps (like the lasagna). Here are a few more:1. ""Taco Salad"" - cook ground beef at home with taco spices (as if you were making tacos), and freeze it for lasting power. Bring along a head of lettuce, some whole tomatoes, a bag of your favorite Doritos, a bag of shredded cheese, kidney beans (optional), and Catalina salad dressing. When the time comes, smash up 1/2 the bag of tacos, cut up the veggies, and mix everything, dressing included. Serve cold - trust me - it's great.2. We cook a few pounds of farmer sausage in the oven at home to near completion, and bring along cold. Then, heat it(and finish cooking it) over the fire (like a wiener). Way better than hot dogs, and 'cuz it's mostly cooked, is fast, and less likely to burn than cooking from raw.3. Cook a bunch of chili at home, and bring frozen (just like the lasagna idea). Great for a meal with instant rice, or as sloppy joes, or, use the rest of your Doritos for dipping.4. If you look in the archives, there are ideas for making just about anything in a bush pie/hobo pie maker.5. Someone said bring some fruit - we find melons have pretty good lasting power. If they need to get eaten, we cut the fruit - the watermelon, honeydo, cantaloupe, grapes, etc. and make a fresh fruit salad. A nice light change of pace.6. If you're bringing fresh veggies anyway, bring along some cans of chicken stock and dry pasta - for some chicken noodle soup. We only make this if we have a cold, rainy day. (also, rather than stock, we take a whole cut up chicken or two, BBQ the pieces, and save the bones - not chewed - to make our own stock.)That's all I can think of for now. Good luck!derrek.CANADIAN WALLEYE OPEN UP AND SAY ""EH""!"
