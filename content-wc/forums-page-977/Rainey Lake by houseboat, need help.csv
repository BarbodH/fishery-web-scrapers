Are the bugs bad this early? We're mainly walleye, bass & Pike fisherman. Any other info. would be greatly appreciated. We've done several fly-ins in the past and thought this would be something different. Thanks for any help or comments you have."
517401,Guest,2002-02-19 14:27:00,0,Are you going to fishing the US or Canadian Side?
517403,Big Laker,2002-02-20 06:42:00,53,"I was up there last year in early June. The people who had the best luck were fishing mostly on the Canada side where there are more shallow spawning areas. On the US side Black Bay (a hugh shallow 8'-10' flat)is a good early season starting spot for both walleye and pike. We also had good luck in the narrows on the east end of the lake. It took us a while to find the fish so a guide might be a good investment, see Woody at www.fairlyreliable.com. We had very little luck with bass, again, the Canadian side is a little better early in the year. I'm sure Woody can put you on some bass.We didn't have a bug problem up there last June."
517402,whitey,2002-02-20 12:46:00,36,How far a boat ride is it from Inter Falls to good fishing grounds in Canada?? We have a week and want to catch fish. We'll go where the fish are. Thanks for the help!
517404,HLLGuide,2002-02-21 14:52:00,10,"I take it you are going with Rainy Lake Houseboats? I used to work there. They have good guides that work for them. I know them all; Ryan, Matt, Cody, Norm, Billy, etc. To your question about fishing Canada, if you are with a guide, he will inform you on the laws, if not make sure you read all their laws, there STRICT! My suggestion is take a guide. Rainy is to big to be wondering on! If you want some more info about Rainy, email me. [email protected]Guide"
517405,Guest,2002-03-02 11:21:00,0,There is a place called Dougherty Houseboat. He has been on the TV show Midwest Outdoors often. They have a very good website with fishing reports among other things. I don't know the address off the top of my head but I think you should be able to find them if you search Houseboats Rainy Lake. Good Luck.
517406,Guest,2002-03-06 07:32:00,0,Thanks for the help guys. We are going with Dougherty's Rainylake Houseboats. and we have scheduled a guide for at least one day. Sounds like early June should be good for all species of fish. Just hope the fish know this.
