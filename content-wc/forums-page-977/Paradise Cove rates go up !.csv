HOWEVER, the web site now says ""prices in US funds"". To me, thats a huge increase, in the range of 50 - 55 per cent. The way I figure it out it (assuming that the exchange rate is .50) I'll have to pay approx. 45 bucks a night. Then I pay BOTH taxes , another 14 per cent. the total is now $51.30 per night. (per person)This might not be a big deal to all you fellows from down south, but to me (us) canadians this is outrageous ! I cannot believe this has happened ! My salary has NEVER gone up this much. My taxes have tho...All that this will cause is that us canadians will look elsewhere to spend our bucks (for whatever it's worth). Dwayne is just lining his pockets / taking advantage of his US guests.PollMaster, please remove my vote from the Minaki poll !I'll never stay at Paradise Cove again !!! (and i'm sure that my Winnipeg friends will also follow....)WrD"

If a resort advertises in US funds, does that change something? Can us South of the Border guys still get refunds on the GST?? Not that I would use that as a determining factor, but just curious?IaCraig"
517992,Guest,2002-03-08 11:41:00,0,With the recent economy in the usa i would think it would be wise for these resort owners to not raise there rates at least for this year.
517993,iamwalleye1,2002-03-09 06:08:00,1589,All the resorts now only take $US dollars. They say that it is cheaper now than 10 years ago that is in canadian funds! Does anyone know the price of gas @ the marina ?
