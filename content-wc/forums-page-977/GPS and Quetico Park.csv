It may be out there...and we are just not aware of it. Not sure why you feel you need a GPS on these lakes...and I say that with 26 trips into the park, because of the style of fishing you would do. The standard Fisher or McKenzie maps are adequate for navigation...and a few of the larger lakes have contours on them. Just my thoughts....Russ WaryeSr. Research EditorFishing Hot Spots"

I think it's meant like this.Original statement, ""Also, any recommendations for whether a GPS in Quetico would be appreciated.""Translation ""Also, any recommendations for weather and a GPS in Quetico. It would be appreciated.""That's my translation but who knows. I could be wrong. My wife keeps reminding me of that every day!!Roger Mayer."
