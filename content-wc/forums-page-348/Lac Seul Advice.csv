2277129,115 optimax,2013-12-15 19:54:00,650,"Yah,X2,!!!You won't believe it until you go there.I haven't been on Lac Suel in 2 years.I bought a brand new rig and didn't want to get chips in the paint on the way there.Im going to start going up to Williams Bay again this summer.I know this might sound stupid,but I'm glad I took a break from going up there.We got spoiled and it wasn't a big deal to catch 2-6lb Walleye all day long with 7-10 pounders a couple times a summer.It truly is ""UNREAL"".Cant wait until this summer."
2277522,Skywagon,2013-12-16 05:42:00,1106,"Optimax, it's been two years, your memory is fading....it's still a goat trail. How about using the highway and boat in from the west? Not that much extra driving time, with a much more pleasant ride (save your boat/trailer). It would not take the 115 too long to get you to that same area to fish."
2279090,115 optimax,2013-12-16 17:04:00,650,"Yah I know,I got a bow buddy,a bow bra,custom built Rock Busters for the truck a boat cover and an engine cover now.Williams Bay is my old stomp'n waters and I'm pretty confident about driving around out there with out flying into a rock pile.When I go I'll just drive slow and stay out and camp for a couple of nights.I think we will be hauling chips out of there this summer,so the road will be getting graded during the week.I only need to go a couple of times before I get spoiled again then it will be back to Wabigoon to work for the big ones."
2292386,jpothof,2013-12-22 21:06:00,30,"We stayed at fisherman's cove last year the 2nd week of June. No complaints about the operation. Water was really cold secondary to the slow warm up last spring. We didn't have much luck in the main lake. We did pretty well up in Broad and Sunlight, and found a couple places in McKenzie that were not of this world. We had a ""no picture unless >25 inch rule"". There were a lot of 30+ inch fish caught.The runs in the morning are long to get to McKenzie or Broad. Some folks were doing it in camp boats. I brought my own boat and running 24-25mph to save gas it was a 40 minute boat ride to the best spots. The ride itself is really nice. Fisherman's and Onaway are probably closer (but not close) than most lodges to McKenzie and Broad.It was our first time and hired the camp guide the first day. It wasn't so much to find spots to fish, but record tracks on the Lowrance so I didn't drop my lower unit on the lake 15 miles from camp.I highly recommend. I can't wait to get back.Jeff"
2294378,Mrnovice,2013-12-23 17:50:00,75,"Good to know. Booked Fishermans Cove in early July for the first time. Never been to Mckenzie and not familiar with Broad. Thinking of hiring guide for a day like you said just to get a good trail. Any more advice would be great. Bringing our boat and renting one. 6 of us, my 2 kids and brother in law and his 2 kids"
2298050,cuamb,2013-12-26 09:32:00,203,I was in the same boat as your buddy 20 years ago this coming June. We had a trip booked for end of June to Pakwash but moved it to early June to be home to help after the baby was born. I called home every day but I knew that there was no way I would get back in time if my wife went early. I went home on Friday a day early and my daughter was born the following Tuesday. It was a very stressful trip and not one I would probably make again. I would have never forgiven myself if I had missed her birth. Your buddy should consider a fall trip.
2312610,davenathe,2014-01-01 14:07:00,113,"Great advice. Birth is a once in a lifetime, cannot image having missed."
2270498,PhilTickelson,2013-12-12 09:35:00,84,"Hey guys, I posted awhile back about going to Boois on Trout Lake and got some great help from some friendly folks here. Unexpectedly my buddy who kind of anchors the group together is going to be having a baby next June, so we are no longer able to do a fly-in(he wants to be able to drive home at a moments notice). We still want to do a trip and want to go to a place that gives us a chance at a trophy walleye or pike. My first thought was to try Lac Seul. We haven't fished Lac Seul before, but we are interested in it's ability to produce large walleyes and pike. I've read through probably 2 dozen threads on different resorts on Lac Seul and I think I've narrowed it down to the following three: Gold Pines Camp Fisherman's Cove Lac Seul Lodge I haven't contacted these resorts and I know there's a good chance they are already booked for next year, but what could you guys tell me about these resorts? I've read great comments about all three on this site, but maybe someone could chime in on the locations of them? Which would be located in the most favorable location for early summer fishing? I've read a lot about Mackenzie Bay, but we will be going late May / Early June, is that still 'the place' to be? What is fishing like on Lac Seul that early in the summer? Thanks for your help!"
2270617,BreezyPoint,2013-12-12 11:33:00,1581,You won't have to go to MacKenzie Bay that early. The best fishing will be close to Ear Falls. You might want to consider Goose Bay Camp. Very close to great early season fishing.
2271433,btyreprich,2013-12-12 17:55:00,1067,"For the past 8 or so years, we have fished the Ear Falls section of Lac Seul in late July to mid August. Usually just before the kids go back to school. GREAT fishing and the weather is more predictable than earlier in the season. Perhaps going several weeks after the baby is born will put your friend's mind at ease. We have stayed at Whitewing a Resort. Dave and Bobbie run a great camp. Check them out."
2271841,rather-be-fishin,2013-12-12 21:36:00,429,"Of these resorts, Gold Pines resort is located closest to Ear Falls end for the early fishing season. Need to check out when the sanctuary river area opens for walleye fishing though. There are many other areas to fish too. I had fished the Ear Falls end for 2 years then switched & now stay at Fisherman's Cove to get more centrally located on the lake. Fisherman's Cove is a great resort! We have been going to Fisherman's Cove for 10 years, but we normally have gone mid July to early August & fish McKenzie Bay, South Bay, South Inlet & South of Manitoba & Windigo Points. Fisherman's Cove is more centrally located on the lake. If staying there in May/June many people fish Far North East end if McKenzie Bay & Sunlight & Broad Lake that time of year. Lac Seul Lodge has a good reputation too. Where are you coming from? When is the baby due! Remember it is about a 5+ hour drive to Ear Falls from International Falls, MN so not a quick trip home. Lac Seul is a large lake & AWESOME Walleye Fishery & big Pike too! Fishing is good all Spring/Summer/Fall!!! Good luck in planning your trip! 7 months & counting down to our return trip to Lac Seul! :-) RBF"

2272274,poultryman,2013-12-13 08:27:00,183,"Whats more expensive, the private jet flight home or the divorce attorney's bill?"
2272618,PhilTickelson,2013-12-13 12:04:00,84,"We are driving from Minneapolis, so no, it won't be a quick trip at all. The baby is due like the last day in June I think. Quote: Originally Posted by zeebeeCmon...your buddy needs to take a year off...geez.. Whats the diff if ""you are a moments notice"" when the drive home is 12 hours. Comical.Hey I totally hear you! That was his decision not mine though! I am not forcing him on this trip, I thought the trip was off as soon as he told me they were expecting but he came to me and wanted to keep it going.

He might be locked down for the next couple months(rightfully so) after the baby is born. Thanks everyone for your replies, is the early summer fishing mainly going to be near the river inlets and the shallower spawning lakes then? It kind of looks like we should expect some long boat rides then huh?"
2274106,Guest,2013-12-14 09:44:00,0,"Our group is from Minneapolis area and we have fished Lac Seul the first week of June for the past 8 years or so. We stay at Gold Pines. The owners are great people and it is one of the cheapest places too stay up there. The cabin we stay in is pretty rustic, but they also have a couple newer cabins with all the bells and whistles. If you fish the Ear Falls area, you probably will fish a majority of the time in Sawmill Bay, which is about a 20 minute boat ride. This is a huge area and you will see a fair amount of boats. The fishing was spectacular last year and we caught a ton of low to mid 20 walleyes casting shallow divers. We catch fish casting, trolling cranks, jigging, slip bobber, and racing crawler harnesses. Our worst years are when there is an early spring and the water temp is warmer than usual for early June. A lot of people also fish the mouth of the Wenasaga River, which is a couple minute boat ride from Gold Pines. Too much of a community hole for us, but will hit it early or late in the day when there isn't as much traffic. We've made the trek to McKenzie Bay, which is about an hour boat ride. Never seem to hit the mother load down there and always wonder if its worth the effort. We know the Sawmill Bay Area much better and spend most of our time there. There is always a learning curve on new water, but I highly recommend fishing Lac Seul and staying at Gold Pines!"
2275170,btmbncr,2013-12-15 00:00:00,492,PhilAre you bringing your own boat? If so Gawley's Little Beaver Lodge(in the same bay as Goose Bay Lodge) is the best place I've found on Lac Seul.Check them out.Bill
