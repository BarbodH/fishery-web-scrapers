2332346,fishguide1800,2014-01-08 07:08:00,84,If its a toss up between cedar and wabigoon I would take cedar any day.the goon has real murky water and it can get real rough out there.cedar lakes lay out is perfect for any kind of weather.if your bringing your own boatall the camps would be good to stay at.if you will be using a camp boat then I would book into Clarke's northern lights.they run Lund outfitters with 50 yamies.and don't charge for the upgrade from the smaller camp boats.bait is free.they have the best bait on the lake as they run a bait business there also.if you need more info call me.1-807-227-2438
2333226,ftfarms,2014-01-08 12:28:00,444,I will also suggest to stay at cedar point resort Me and my wife fished there last July and did real well with walleye and small mouth. Over 400 walleye and 250 small mouth and that was a vaction not a all out fishing trip.
2319993,tiz,2014-01-04 11:52:00,18,"Let me start by saying, I hope everyone is staying somewhat warm. Following what you guys have been going through the last week is just unbelievable. We are expecting 9 degrees here in Atlanta, GA this coming Tuesday and they will probably cancel school as the bus stop is to cold for the kids. Enough about the weather and onto more important things like fishing. I am planning a Sept trip to celebrate my 50th and my retirement from policing after 25 years. Two bottles of Templeton Rye whiskey and a box of Padron cigars (also turning 50 this year) and Canada here I come. Have narrowed it down to Cedar Lake or Wabigoon. Looking for a constant walleye bite, some smallmouth action, perch and crappie to bring home, and a chance to catch a big muskie. This is an alone trip, looking for peace, quiet, and fish. Any help will be greatly appreciated and please be safe and I wish you all a wonderful and prosperous 2014."
2320161,skidood,2014-01-04 12:50:00,47,"Lac Seul for eyes and muskies NE part Three sisters area. The goon can be tough at times. Don't know about eyes on Cedar but has big muskies. Lac Seul also for true Canada feel, nice and peacefull. Maybe Skywagon will chime in He helped me on a trip to the goon."
2320681,Larry Mac,2014-01-04 17:41:00,530,"Hi Tiz, Congrats on your upcoming 50th and your retirement. Giving your two choices and stated requirements I would recommend Cedar Lake. I have personnally caught all the species you have mentioned on Cedar Lake less the Muskie (we did not target them but I have seen them caught by others). Cedar is an easy and comfortable lake to fish. You will have a great time where ever you end up. Congratulations again and have a great trip!!!!Thank you,Larry Mac"
2320761,JayM5209,2014-01-04 18:14:00,1050,"Congrats on the pending retirement!I vote with Larry Mac. The 'Goon will give you fish, as will Cedar, but since part of your requirements include ""peace and quiet"" it's a no brainer - Cedar Lake by a wide margin.September is a great time to be there. Enjoy the trip!P.S. For a bonus day, see if the camp you select on Cedar can dump a boat in Cliff Lake - just across the road - for a day of lake trout fishing . . . and a chance at a big, big walleye or a chance musky."

2321865,Skywagon,2014-01-05 06:58:00,1106,"After 25 years of serving the public in that capacity, you deserve a peaceful vacation. I live on the Wabigoon system, have never been on Cedar, but do know locals that fish Cedar and the portage lakes that are connected. Those people talk about how good the walleye and muskie fishing is (big muskie). My wife has been on Cedar, said it is beautiful and that there are Indian pictographs located on the lake.You mentioned in an earlier thread that you had already booked on Cedar, I think you made a good choice."
2323569,115 optimax,2014-01-05 16:20:00,650,"Ya,Wabigoon is an awesome lake from June into August but then it starts to slow down.If you go to Cedar lake you can take a day trip just down the highway to an awesome Crappie lake down Camp Robinson rd.Talk to the owners they will know what lake I'm talking about."
2324858,fishguide1800,2014-01-06 05:12:00,84,I spend a lot of time on cedar Muskie fishing.Sept you will hardly see a boat. Very peacefully and the walleye bite is always on.I usually recommend Clarke's northern lights.
2325546,Mike Kansas,2014-01-06 08:37:00,1463,If I was going in Sept by myself I would go to Lost Island Lodge on Lac Seul. There are a bunch of great fall spots close to camp and it is as pretty a place as there is on Lac Seul. Also great owners and service and great cabins. The fall fishing there is hard to beat.
