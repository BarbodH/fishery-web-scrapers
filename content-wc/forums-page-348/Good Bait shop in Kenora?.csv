2299666,btmbncr,2013-12-26 20:39:00,492,The last 2 times I've been to Lac Seul we have done well with leeches.I have preordered Leeches by the pound from the Four Seasons in Ear Falls.Last year they they ran out and we couldn't only get 1/2 our order.There were a lot of real small leeches in the 2 pounds we got. I thought there might be a better bait shop to order leeches from in Kenora.We stay in Kenora overnight on our way to Gawleys Little Beaver Lodge on Lac Seul. If anyone on here has a bait shop recomendation I'd appreciate it.Thank Bill

I have noticed leech's are commonly difficult to come by, beginning sometime in August, probably has to do with their life cycle, as I think most are trapped locally. Good luck on your search."
2300514,deadhead1,2013-12-27 09:17:00,193,Last summer there was a shortage of leechs everywhere around Kenora. They said the catch was very bad for some reason. Generally you can buy at Sunset baits or Figure 8 Baits. Both are good to deal with.
