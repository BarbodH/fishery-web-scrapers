2280025,elkman99,2013-12-17 06:56:00,180,I'm thinking about taking a day off of musky fishing next year and trying to get my buddies on some great walleye fishing. We will be in the Perrault Falls area for 10 days from 7/2/14 - 7/12/14 and would like to take them to Lac Seul for a day. Where would you guys suggest that I launch/fish at? thanks for any suggestions!
2280121,Skywagon,2013-12-17 07:32:00,1106,"Scout Bay is your closest option. You can research here on WC places to fish. If you have a GPS with a lake chip it can be useful, it is a big lake with lots of rock hazards, some are marked."
2282034,Guest,2013-12-17 20:44:00,0,the public boat ramp is not far away on scout bay. Located on HWY 105 between Lac Suel lodge and Fishermans Cove camps.
2282122,Limeyangler,2013-12-17 21:31:00,563,Scout Bay would be your closest. Easy access.
2282330,elkman99,2013-12-18 06:17:00,180,I stayed at Onaway lodge once back in the middle 80's with my neighbors. I remember taking a really cool trip to Broad and Sunlight lakes. How far of a boat ride is it from Scout and is the fishing any good there in July? thanks for the help!
2286498,Steve of Madison,2013-12-19 18:49:00,230,"The previous answers are correct as far as proximity. The drive to Broad or Sunlight is really dependent upon what your boats are. I stay at Onaway which is very close to the landing, and the trip is at least 45 min to an hour just to the mouth of Altimeter creek. Then you get to negotiate up that.I am up there about the same time of year as your trip and don't bother going up to Broad/Sunlight. The trip is scenic, but the trip up the river at that time of yr can be ""interesting"". Plus, the fishing is spotty at that time, there are fish but not the numbers as earlier in the year, they have migrated downriver to the main lake by then.And lastly, unless you have GPS and know the proper travel routes, plus the opportunity for ugly weather to show up, a simple day trip up there may be something to reconsider. If you would like, PM me, and I can get you several easy to find spots with travel routes close to the landing that are sure thing producers that time of year."
2287050,elkman99,2013-12-20 05:50:00,180,"thanks Steve. I do have a chip for NW Ontario, and i'm pretty sure LS is on it. when we went to Broad and Sunlight, it got ROUGH. We were in a 16ft tri-hull and had to beach it on one of the islands and wait for the wind to calm down. I remember bailing out water with a folgers coffee can lol. At 12 yrs old, me and their son thought it was fun! I look back on it now and think HOLY COW, not so fun! Is the landing by Onaway Lodge the one folks are talking about? If so, the year before I stayed at Onaway, I stayed at Skyline Lodge on Florence with the same neighbors (My neighbors father Herb owned it for several years). Anyways, we launched our boat there and went to Vaughn Bay for the day. that was around 1985 and it's still the best day of walleye fishing I've ever had. Boy, it was a looooong boat ride though, but worth it!"
2298266,houndog,2013-12-26 10:49:00,365,If you want to fly and you're not hung up on Lac Seul you can have a float plane pick you up on Wabaskang or you could drive to Ear Falls and fly to Wapisi Lake which is located a few minutes north west of Wapasi Bay on the northeast part of Lac Seul.It's been a couple of years since I last took the trip but the Walleye fishing was out of this world. I'm being totally honest when I tell you I've caught 6 walleyes in 2 minutes jigging without minnows. We fished it in mid to late July with fantastic results. Cost was the same for Wapisi as Lac Seul. We did it first because we didn't want to book the fly in and have the waves of Lac Seul can leave us high and dry.

Maybe I'm a little too cautious, but I watch the sky, plus zipping across the lake at 30mph and the rain hitting you in the face while trying to stay on top of the white caps is not exciting. It does get your heart rate up, but thats not something I need.Like I said, PM me if you are interested in a few spots close to the landing, I have spots from Manitoba pt, to Steamboat. Plus a spot that will make you feel like Broad or Sunlight without the adventurous ride."
