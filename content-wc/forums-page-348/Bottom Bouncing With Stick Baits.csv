2335346,bigdog8837,2014-01-09 07:55:00,30,How do you set your depth for those suspended fish with the wolf rig?
2335802,Mike Borger,2014-01-09 09:47:00,1554,"I'm using my electronics to see where my rig is, once it's at the right depth I start trolling.Just like pulling bouncers I'm trying to keep the angle to a minimum and as verticle as possible. That means using heavier weights if I'm trolling faster.Oftentimes I'll run 3-4oz bell sinkers on my dropper when trolling in 30+ feet of water."
2335818,Mike Borger,2014-01-09 09:50:00,1554,"FWIW this is also my favorite technique when I'm fishing for lake trout and brook trout in the summer, especially out of my canoe. It's easy to carry a few big sinkers along with you when you're portaging into a back lake..."
2330409,Mike Kansas,2014-01-07 12:52:00,1463,"Does anybody have any luck with BB and stick baits? I have had good luck with them on some nice Walleye and have caught some big Pike doing it. My wife caught a 29"" Walleye and two Pike over 40"" last year in the first half hour we did it. Our best luck has been in deeper water with 1 1/2 oz BB and 4"" stick baits with shallow diver bills. All colors seem to work but brighter two tone baits seem best. I try and maintain a 45 degree angle on the line and use braided line which enhances hook sets because of it's no stretch feature. Mike Kansas"
2330737,Yarhcaz,2014-01-07 14:40:00,1389,Been doing that for years....first time I remember doing it was back in the late 70's. We used floating rapala's behind BBs. Ac couple years ago I used Salmo Hornets behind a BB on did very well working deep water points on Oahe. It works well.
2331193,Mike Borger,2014-01-07 16:18:00,1554,"Yes, it's been one of my go-to techniques for many years especially in August and Sept when (at least on my lake) the larger fish seem to head into deeper water.No stretch line as mentioned is key. I'm also much more partial to a simple Wolf River rig than a bottom bouncer.The Wolf River rig simply utilizes a 3-way swivel with the dropper having an oversized bell sinker attached via varying lengths of mono.The nice thing about this rig it allows you to have much more separation between your heavy weight and lure.Sometimes especially in clearer water I'll run 4'-5' from swivel to bell sinker then 6-10' between swivel and stickbait.Very stealthy. Very effective.This kind of rigging also shines pulling worm harnesses in clear water when the fish are finicky.Keep the dropper line a lighter pound test and you'll never lose a lure, just a cheap sinker..."
2331841,BornToFish,2014-01-07 20:08:00,1224,"I am intrigued by the concept of bottom bouncers (wolf-river rigs) with stick baits. I primarily fish in NW Ontario during August and September. I have a question for anglers with experience pulling these rigs at this time of the year. What type of water do you target for walleyes? For example, are you drifting up, across and then down mid-lake rock reefs? Around points? Running depth contours? If so, what range in depth? Main lake basin? Many thanks for your suggestions!"
2332362,3M TA3,2014-01-08 07:22:00,2846,Well certainly the key is to put the bait in front of the fish and it sounds like you were able to do just that. And some of those 4 inch stick baits are not only my favorites but fish favorites too. Way to go.
2332450,MrSimon,2014-01-08 07:36:00,922,"I don't know whey this method doesn't get more press. It puts proven baits down where the fish are and allows you to cover a lot of water. Its an incredibly efficient and effective way to find and catch fish. Its also incredibly easy and fun to do. I also find that speed and depth makes a much bigger difference than what lure you use. When doing this, I use cheap floating stick baits instead of the expensive ones I use for casting. That way I don't worry about loosing baits to snags (although just circling back around can get just about any snag loose)."
2332610,Mike Kansas,2014-01-08 08:21:00,1463,Have only tried drifting these rigs in windy conditions. I'm normally back trooling contours into the wind around islands or dragging them over mid lake humps or long points. We work depths of any level but it seems to be effective on post spawn fish in depths around 20' and deeper. Great way to cover large sand flats which can be awesome producers on Lac Seul which is normally where I fish. I also like to remove the belly hook on the stick bait. It seems we have less snag ups doing this and I don't think it diminishs the hook up rate on the fish. Also helps to be familar with the lakes forage base and match stick bait to both color and size for that time of year. Mike Kansas
2334538,btmbncr,2014-01-08 20:45:00,492,"Mike KansasI have had good luck with Silver Black back Jointed Rapalas #9,Thunderstick Jr's and Bomber Long A's.I've have better luck with baits that have white or silver belly colors ie smelt. Cordell CC Shads worked good when we had a gizzard shad population explosion years ago on the Missopuri Reserviors here in the Dakota's. As Bill Dance would say""Come er you pullin' thing"" Bill"
2334930,Mike Borger,2014-01-09 05:41:00,1554,"The genesis for the this idea was adapted from the way we fish for giant suspended walleyes that chase baitfish at Quinte in the late fall.IMO there's an untapped population of bigger walleyes on smaller inland shield lakes that never get fished for by your average angler.I'm searching for clouds of baitfish first with my electronics then fishing just above them. In my lake the baitfish seem to be most concentrated suspended over deep 40-50' sand and/or clay flats.Many of the same Quinte type presentations work, trolling with leadcore, using downriggers, but I've settled on the wolf river rig for it's simplicity.It is possible to troll deep diving cranks at the correct depth, Luhr Jensen Power Dive Minnows immediately spring to mind. But it's all about matching the hatch so to speak and in my lake I run either a 4"" perch colored stick bait or one with a chrome finish. The fish are targetting either young of the year perch or shiners...The smaller stick baits seem to be exactly what these fish want.We never drift, always troll and because it's later in the summer you can troll at a surprisingly fast clip and cover a lot of water. The fishes metabolism is high and they're usually pretty aggressive."
2335098,DMella,2014-01-09 06:49:00,32,Great Topic! I have not done this since I was a young boy (early 70's)rowing a boat to troll on Lake Lucerne in WI in the first few hours after dark. It was our go to method on that very clear lake and we caught some larger walleyes. We always used the wolf river rigs - I don't think bbs were around yet - and black and silver floating rapalas about 6 feet behind the swivel. Of course this should work in CA in Aug and Sept why haven't I been giving this a try when they are on the mid lake humps and deep? Stuck in some ruts I guess. Thanks for the kick in the butt folks!
