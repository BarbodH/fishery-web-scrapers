2335306,jokerjim,2014-01-09 07:39:00,473,Pike is good if it is fresh. It does not taste the same after it is frozen. Of course if you had enough coatings you could probably make it taste like steak !!!!!

2314945,DMella,2014-01-02 11:59:00,32,"What about baked in foil vs. fried? I love them both but have been doing more baked lately. Less mess and an easer set up! I simply double foil a few filets, coat with olive oil, lemon & salt and pepper, seal the foil pouch, and rest it over some coals. In 5 minutes the pouch expands like a balloon and I remove it from the coals and it is ready to eat. Fantastic! It is even more fun on the ice cause you get to warm up by the fire too"
2315025,MrSimon,2014-01-02 12:37:00,922,Do the fillets get mushy that way though? I tried the tinfoil thing in the fire with some catfish and it got all mushy and gross.
2315449,DMella,2014-01-02 15:12:00,32,"No. In fact, that is where the pike really shine because they are a firmer fish they hold up very nicely. It is important to not overcook any fish with this method though. Seriously, when the foil envelope inflates they are done. Overcooked fish is like overcooked beef - a sin! You should give it a try this winter on the grill with some left over fish or some store bought fillets."

2316097,Blades-n-Beads,2014-01-02 18:56:00,484,"Favorite shore lunch mix. One small box of beer batter mix (shore lunch brand), one half packet of dry ranch dressing mix, tablespoon of lowrys seasoning salt, mix up a wet batter with one can of beer until its creamy, cut up your fillets so all about the same size and throw them all in the pool and mix, fry to golden brown!! Walleye, perch, northern, don't matter there all tasty."
2320313,Slushfish,2014-01-04 14:19:00,263,"We generally fish walleye, while doing so, pick up some pike and whitefish. Then greys and specs. have cooked them in all combinations over 30 years. Walleye are always first to go, but, we've ate em all."
2335050,DMella,2014-01-09 06:37:00,32,Boy that beer batter sounds good! Never tried it cause I hate to use the beer but I am going to give it a try on the ice here in a couple weeks. That is if we can get a few to bite. Just dreaming of one particular beach (Mouse Island) on LOW in July with fish cooking warms my bones. Enough with this cold!
2335202,Bill Krejca,2014-01-09 07:22:00,6107,"Yeah, re: Older - Memory is also diminished, along with most other functions, I just don't remember the differences between those fish. What were they again? Bill"
2306258,DMella,2013-12-29 19:21:00,32,All things being equal which is the finer shore lunch fare? I have conducted taste tests in the past with both walleye and pike both fried and foil baked and have had a consistant favorite emerge. How about you and your favorite shore lunch routines?
2306457,phishfearme,2013-12-29 20:23:00,1242,is this a trick question? on walleyecentral?
2306802,MrSimon,2013-12-30 05:55:00,922,While this is certainly a fun conversation .... it has been discussed at length many times over on this site. I'd recommend searching up some of the older threads and reading through all the comments .... feel free to add your comments to one of those older threads if you want.
2306890,Guest,2013-12-30 07:24:00,0,"Both are excellent. It comes down to personal choice. Pike are firmer, walleye are easier to clean, not slimy and don't make you smell like a pike. Some guys are turned off if they find a fish bone. I'm a pretty good pike fileter but occasionally miss one."
2306898,ohiojmj,2013-12-30 07:24:00,1262,"MrSimon may be requesting opinion of today's readers, not necessarily those from the past. I honestly prefer pike. If we all thought the same, it would be a boring world. I consider it like deciding between NY strip and porterhouse steak; both great, up to individual taste. Actually, I prefer perch, pike, then walleye, in that order, but very much enjoy them all. Maybe this site should be PerchPikeWalleyeCentral. Oh by the way, I also eat an occasional smallmouth too but bass doesn't make it to my top 3."
2306946,Skywagon,2013-12-30 07:46:00,1106,"Past readers are now older, so their sense of taste is diminished and may feel differently today?"
2307170,briand,2013-12-30 09:39:00,48,Over the years there always one person who claims they won't eat pike.Thats when it's fun to slip a few pike into the walleye fry.Generally not till they see that black vein in the pike fillet do they start to complain.
2307194,camp chef,2013-12-30 09:46:00,915,It is all good...Just don't forget to call me when it is ready.
2307258,btyreprich,2013-12-30 10:10:00,1067,"Walleye for sure followed by Perch if available. As you know, these two fish are closely related. Catch limits for Perch are also quite generous - 25 on a conservation license! All of talk on which fish tastes better makes me wish I had a few fillets left in the freezer! Happy New Year everyone!"
2307282,Golden Eagle,2013-12-30 10:14:00,2642,"I'll butcher a 26"" pike before walleye season opens, but beginning on the 3rd Saturday in May it's all walleye for me. May pike tastes better than August pike. Cold water helps."
