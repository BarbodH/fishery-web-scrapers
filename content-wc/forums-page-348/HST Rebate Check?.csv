That amount has never varied by so much as 1% from the exchange rate when I looked it up on line."" give thanks to your lucky stars that you have this situation. assuming your bank is profitable, just how do you think they make their money? handling foreign checks and exchange is NOT free. It wouldn't surprise me that they are charging other fees (like requiring maintenance of a large balance) to cover expenses associated with handling foreign checks and exchange - or you may have some special account that covers the cost of handling foreign check with other account ""fees"". all three of the banks I deal with make it clear that both fees apply. ""3rd, I sure don't understand the suggestions that the outfitter should just deduct the amount of HST due from our bill. What the hay . . . . . . . .???!! The outfitter/camp owner is simply collecting and forwarding the tax due. Where's the notion come from that he/they should take that amount out of their own pocket as a favor to us? Has anyone tried telling Walmart or Target to deduct the sales tax due from our tab at the register???"" actually, in my experience, I was taken back by the first outfitter who DIDN'T automatically deduct the rebate from the bill. (it used to be a PST rebate.) it's very simple - it's MUCH less costly to the government to NOT have to handle these rebate applications, receipts, verifications, etc. each outfitter who provided packages that qualified for the rebate simply charges the tax amount after rebate is taken out. no forms, no receipts, no government labor for anything. one outfitter told me that they are required to ask for a larger deposit in order to be able to do this but he couldn't see why EVERY outfitter providing qualified services wouldn't do this automatic reduction in tax. I don't think this has anything to do with ""grandfathering"". phish"
2303673,GNO,2013-12-28 18:40:00,153,"You are right Phish - the outfitters that chose to do the rebate automatically on your bill are not grandfathered in. I rebate it on directly off the customers bill for packages that qualify. This is my option as anoutfitter to do this. I was not grandfathered. This stops all the questions and waiting for the decision and refund. I have had other outfitters tell me that they do not offer the rebate directly for fear that Revenue Canada may deem they unrightfully gave the refund, and they will be responsible to pay the tax themselves."
2303817,port1042,2013-12-28 20:50:00,509,"The lodge I go to (Manotak) knows how to write an invoice that qualifies for the discount. I submit it and I get a check. No problem with that. It's sort of pain but it appears my bank is not taking too large a share based on other's reports. Between my fishing partner and I we get about $70.00 back for each trip. It goes into ""the pot"". We play cribbage about 3 times a week during the off season. $1.00 per game, nickle a peg, and double on a skunk. All losses go into ""the pot"". In other words, you never win, you always pay (assuming you lose at least one game or the cut for deal - another $1.00). By the end of the winter the pot pays for at least half of our spring trip and fall trips. I seem to pay more than my share, but what the hay, it's a lot more pleasant than ice fishing!"
2306770,Skyraptor,2013-12-30 04:25:00,291,They did not a few years ago and many of their guests got they rebate sent back because Manotak did not list the services. Glad they learned.
2317705,Mike Kansas,2014-01-03 12:43:00,1463,My bank didn't charge me anything for cashing my check. Probably because I own 25% of the bank. Well my wife does so that gives me 12.5% if she divorces me. Which wouldn't be a bad deal. Hope she is not reading this.

2318513,Fisherman Ted,2014-01-03 17:41:00,461,"Speaking as an operator it's a no-brainer to apply the rebate to next years deposit. It would let me lock up a reservation a year in advance, keep a happy customer and also give the customer the most bang for the buck (essentially a clean conversion) assuming they are paying and being charged in Canadian funds. And yes the conversion rates can be brutal, I have discussed this before in other threads when bringing/cashing Canadian funds into the US banking system. It can be several percentage points above the spot rate in general, sometimes even more. The best I have seen is @ 1% over spot rate. As a US resident with a Canadian lodge(accepting US cash) I have even more exposure than the typical operator. If I want to get paid back home and put food on the table I need to somehow get the funds into US dollars at the end of the day and try to bypass as many middlemen (i.e. banks) as possible to preserve the dollar's value. The absolute best way to do this is to have multiple accounts in Canada in separate currencies and write checks to yourself in US funds and then deposit into your US bank account. No fees, no conversion rake, no giving away your cash. Of course this assumes you are doing so well that you never need to convert all US money into Canadian to pay your bills or that you are accepting US cash in the first place. The IRS will also see this but that's a different issue. The HST checks guests receive back and see eroded by banks, spot rates and fees is compounded 100 times over for some operators if that makes you feel any better."

2318913,Fisherman Ted,2014-01-03 22:30:00,461,"[QUOTE=phishfearme;2318833]Several reasons. The most important one is that very few of my guests even qualify for the rebate. Secondly, in my case there IS a conversion issue and hence risk on my part (as I charge and accept in US funds). If that credit gets held up or even worse denied and in the mean time the US dollar has taken a dive that would be bad news (currency fluctuations are a big enough issue as it is). And third I do not ask for deposits until the fall. The number of guests that qualify for the rebate and actually care to send in the form can be counted on one hand. I will happily fill out the paperwork for them along with their bill so they can request the rebate for the few that want it. Don't get me wrong, I would love ALL of my guests to qualify for the rebate and have every one of them lay down a deposit 12-15 months in advance. If that were the case it would behoove me to do it for them. Just doesn't work out with my business model and set-up. I wish it would."

2293146,polaris-pete,2013-12-23 09:27:00,343,"An update to this- today I get a letter from The Ontario Tax rebate Center.I got the rebate check back in November, 5 months after our trip.This lettter says in short- We have received your HST Rebate documents for which you are applying a refund for.When we review these documents, we will make a decision and if approved, will forward a check to your address. Guess I had better cash it quick."
2293338,kzoofisher,2013-12-23 10:43:00,5144,If the Canadian dollar drops like some people are predicting it won't be worth cashing at a $25 fee. Hope more lodges will be willing to put it towards next years deposit or take it off the bill.
2296858,polaris-pete,2013-12-25 08:28:00,343,"Martin and Jennifer, Owners of Parks Outpost Camps with no problem said to send them our HST Rebate Check and they would apply it to our Outpost Camp's Deposit.

2298930,Mr Ranger,2013-12-26 16:12:00,272,"I sent ours in last month but they sent it back denied saying our invoice did not include enough detail and did not include any ""Service"" like a fly in or fishing guide. I know other that have received the rebate for the same package. We pay for the lodging, no meals and boat rental. Not sure if I should challenge it or not."
2299450,polaris-pete,2013-12-26 19:19:00,343,Try and contact your outfitter or lodge owner and see what they tell you. I would try and send it in again.
2299594,phishfearme,2013-12-26 20:19:00,1242,"strictly speaking, it doesn't sound like you qualify for the rebate. HOWEVER, in the past it all seems to get down to what the outfitter specifies (or is willing to specify) on the receipt and any additional service could qualify. look on this board and you'll see some have specified ""fillet services"" as an additional service so a group who only rents a cabin could qualify. HOWEVER, it may be the case that the Canadian government is seeing through these VERY debatable strategies which circumvent the intent of the law - I'm sure they've seen it all by now. if I were an outfitter, I would be very cautious about ""creatively specifying"" a service - they could get into a raft of trouble and for what? or - enough abuse may lead to withdrawal of the entire rebate for all of us. phish"
2299634,tooski,2013-12-26 20:31:00,393,"I think it is a confusing, asinine, subjective tax. In other words it sounds like it came from Washington. I am taking Phish's suggestion and only using outfitters that handle the tax internally."
2301097,JayM5209,2013-12-27 13:48:00,1050,"Go to the the web sites where you can print out the form and read the descr,iptions/regs that clearly and simply explain the program and its requirements.

Simple, straightforward, and in my experience a no hassle deal.2nd, I've never been charged a fee of any kind by my bank when I deposit a rebate check.

The logic of such a suggestion escapes me.But, then, unlike my wife's late grandfather, I won't drive a 14 mile roundtrip to save $0.015/gallon when I fill up the truck either."
2301169,tooski,2013-12-27 14:45:00,393,"Well Jay if it was so ""clearly and simply"" explained I would suggest we wouldn't have multiple postings complaining about the ambiguity of whether they get the rebate or not. I didn't say they should take the rebate out as a favor. It should be part of the service, not a ""favor"". And the next time I shop Walmart I will ask them if I can get half the tax back for some nonsensical reason. You wanna tax me, fine. Making more political red tape with rebate forms is silly. For the record in over 50 trips I have never applied for a rebate. Figured they could use the extra money to re-hab Toronto's mayor. There are dozens of outfitters offering basically the same services. I will continue to use the ones that are willing to do me a ""favor"". I am not insisting on anything from an outfitter, only making the choice that seems logical."

I remember a thread before saying how to cash this check without getting robbed in doing so.Is it better to deposit it in your account ( US) cash it in the US or wait until you go over to Ontario again to try and cash it? There were quite a few posts on it and would appreciate any info. Thanks in advance.

2290818,NP4ME,2013-12-21 19:28:00,378,I deposited into my bank here in the US. Had to pay a very small fee because of the difference in the exchange rate at the time.
2291058,bellbuoy,2013-12-22 05:20:00,490,"My credit union wanted about $25, over 25% of the rebate. I made a deal w/ my lodge to send it to them and they use it as a credit towards my account for the next year."
2291186,Fishoil,2013-12-22 06:37:00,1277,When I get my check for our group I show it to my wife and explain that it can only be cashed at the lodge in Canada where we originally paid the tax. Since there were several of our friends and relatives on the trip they are entitled to a share of it and if I don't go back to the lodge to cash it they won't get their money. We can't allow that to happen so it pretty much guarantees my return for more great fishing next year.

There was a $3.00 ""foreign check fee"" and $9.01 for the exchange rate adjustment. I don't mind the $3.00 fee since someone has to do some special handling, but they gave a really lousy exchange rate. (Associated Bank)."
2291746,phishfearme,2013-12-22 13:29:00,1242,"there's two ""fees"" associated with these checks in the US: - banks and credit unions vary but there's usually a fee associated with handling a check for foreign currency. consider your self EXTREMELY fortunate if this fee is less than $25 - EVERY financial institution charges some amount of currency conversion fee - 3% over the spot seems to be a typical number but it can vary a good bit. - if your bank charges minimal or no foreign check handling fee then it would be a good bet that the currency exchange fee is higher than others typically charge. to me the bottom line is that it's best financially to have someone in Canada deposit the check into a Canadian account and 1 - give you the cash or 2 - put it directly towards next year's trip as a deposit. this eliminates all the fees. HOWEVER - the BEST route is for the outfitter to deduct the rebate amount directly from the bill when you pay it. some outfitters have no problems with this and others for some reason won't do it. if we insisted on it, then outfitters would respond. phish"
