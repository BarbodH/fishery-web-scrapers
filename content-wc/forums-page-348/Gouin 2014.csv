This will be our 4th year staying at the Oasis and fifth on the resevoir. Francois at the Oasis runs a top notch service with arguably the best value on the resevoir. Boats and motors are all new (within the last 2-3 years) and the cabins are in great shape. Great fishing for walleye right out in front of the outfitter( at least early in the season) oh and some big pike if you know where to look . What about you?"

The location is beautiful, the boats and motors are excellent and the cabins are clean and well equipped. The last 50 km or so dirt road was pretty sketchy, I was amazed that he said someone showed up in a Honda fit. I'll be at Oasis from May 28-June 2... Can't wait."
