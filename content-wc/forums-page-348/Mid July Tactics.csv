Some crawler harnesses and bouncers. Planning on more casting this year and want to mix it up some. My question is, that time of year, what is your go to technique? Already looking for ways to pass winters time. Thanks everyone, Slushfish"

Will often tip the jig with a bit of crawler especially vertical jigging. If the fish are aggressive enough or the wind is up I will also throw crank baits to shallow fish. Shad and minnow bodies, floaters if I'm ticking bottom, suspending if I'm not. Always start with natural colors (white, silver, gold, perch, backs are blue, black or green) unless the water is riled then I go brighter and maybe some rattle. All this assumes you are over hard bottom. A method I don't think a lot of people use any more is in-line spinners. If there are fish in weeds and I can stay just above the weeds they work great. Copper, gold and silver sizes 3&4. Lots of vibration and flash to grab attention plus you can drop 'me down in a hole or at the edge. Everybody loves spinners on harnesses, why not cast 'em, too?"
2320961,ftfarms,2014-01-04 19:17:00,444,The only thing we use that time of year is jigs tipped with a worm or leech. I prefer whistler jigs and knuckle head jigs. We use no plastics no more.
