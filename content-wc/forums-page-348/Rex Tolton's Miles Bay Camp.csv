Rex Tolton's Miles Bay Camp seems to be in a good area for multi-species fishing plus it looks like there would be weather protection for my 18 foot lund. We like fishing for walleyes but also like exploring and casting for northerns or ?? Any recommendations, owner, accomodations, boat protection, etcRandy from Duluth"

Pretty protected from the wind unless you try to go to the other side of Miles bay. I'm not sure about Northern fishing up there, as we do all of ours in Obabikon Lake. (which is probably a 20 minute boat ride or so from MBC) Good luck!"
2308970,Tamarack,2013-12-30 23:33:00,16,"Nice sheltered location, we have caught plenty of walleyes right close to Matt's camp. Nice housekeeping camp with a reasonable price point. Other island camps you can check out are Jared at Obabikon Bay Camp, Wayne at Grassy Narrows, Paul at Spruce Island and you could check out us out too if you want. We all offer something a little different but all work our butts off to make sure our customers are happy. No matter which you choose it likely won't be your last visit to the Morson area.Good Luck, Tamarack Todd."
2327058,MikeMcC,2014-01-06 13:57:00,72,I enjoyed my one stay there. It accomodated my 18' Lund Tyee just fine. The resort is kind of a step back in time to the traditional fishing camps. Cabins are older but in good condition. No bathrooms in cabin but private outhouse and shower room were fine with us. It migth actually be better than having an old nasty bathroom in the cabin. Camp fish fry was good too. Plenty of areas to fish. Good value for the money. Get GPS chip for LOTW if you don't have one.
