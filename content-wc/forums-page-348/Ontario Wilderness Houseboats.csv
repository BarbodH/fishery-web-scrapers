During a typical year what sort of fishing should we expect for walleye, bass, pike, panfish? Any info on areas of the lake to consider would be appreciated. Has anyone rented from Ontario Wilderness Outfitters? What was your experience like? Thanks,"

We always found the owner and his son's pleasant to work with and we found them to be accommodating. We typically brought 3 boats and rented one. I think all our trips included 8 men and we rented one of their larger houseboats. It has been about 5 years since we have used them and we decided to use them again this year. Our trips were always in the middle of June. Depending on the year and most of the years were a little different, we found bass still in the shallows along the rocky shorelines of islands and near shallow reefs. Walleyes were found off points of islands. We used plastics for bass and either leeches or crawlers for walleyes. Most of us used jigs for the leeches and bottom bounces with the crawlers. I would guess since you are going a few weeks later that the walleyes will start setting up on reefs near the islands. In June we found the northerns in the shallow reeds. Spinner baits seemed to be the bait of choice for them. We usually moved the house boat 3 times during our trip. Without looking at my maps we spent one night near the New Moon Lodge, 4 nights in Sandy Bay and then another night near the New Moon Lodge on the way back to Morson. The number of nights at any one spot may have varied depending on the weather and the fishing. We have fished around Skiff Island and all the way out west to Poplar Island, not so much out of necessity just that we liked to explore different areas. I'm sure you will have a good trip. We always caught fish and like any fishing trip some years were better than others. Let me know if you have any other questions. Like2Fish"

Its been almost twenty years since I fished it in early July but as I recall at that time, the walleye were found at the 15' level and NP's were incidental catches. I troll lots and weighted crawler harnesses together with cranks that go to the 15' level work well. Did well on bass with lipless thrown off points. Stop by at a local tackle shop before you board the boat, spend a few bucks and you will get a wealth of info. Pay attention to maps and navigation, LOW is a user friendly lake but only if you pay it respect; saw a couple of houseboats mounted on reefs due to carelessness.Hope you will file a report upon your return."

The Muskies should be on fire by this time of the year, Walleyes will likely be transitioning from shallow water to the reefs. You will likely be able to get them at both type of spots.Smallies are a real blast this time of year too! Lots of them and some real nice ones as well, last year they were just crazy. Try casting your favorite crank bait over shallow water.Good luck with your trip and have a blast, and if you are out our way and need anything feel free to stop in."

Early on we would go right after the 4th but as time has gone on, just due to personal scheduling reasons, we go at the end of the month. I can't speak for the entire lake of course but in the northeast area of the the lake involving Andrew Bay, Witch Bay, Moore Bay, the French Narrows area and all way down to the Shore Island area, the fishing has been very good to us in July. If walleye is your main target they will be relating to the mid lake humps and deeper shoreline breaks in late June all the way thru the month of July. This area of LOW is full of mid lake structure and if you have a good hydro map or better yet a gps combo unit with a LOW chip you can find these humps and the fish very easily. It is just my opinion but bottom bouncing with a spinner rig and a crawler (or a chunk of crawler) is a very good way to fish these humps. Some humps top off at 20 feet, some top off at 10 feet but the graph will tell you what the fish are doing. We have caught them as shallow as 8 to 10 feet all the way down to 25 to 30 feet. The weather conditions will determine a lot of that. But just remember they will always be relating to that hump in some way. We don't fish smallies much but we have caught some nice ones throwing crank baits into the boulders fishing for walleye. There is a lot round boulder shorelines especially south of the Barrier Islands. If you are after eater northern then the weed beds will be the place to target. The bigger northerns do not like warm water and will move deeper in July. We have hooked a few 38 to 40 inchers throwing crank baits over a rock bar with deep water nearby. Hope this helps! Don't let July on LOW scare you off. We have had several 100 fish walleye days on LOW in July. Good Luck!"
