2331425,pjshorthorn,2014-01-07 17:35:00,5654,I'm thinking I'll bring my 7 jigs and borrow the rest of the tackle I may need from fellows on this year's trip. We need to help all tackle hoarders get over their addiction one fishing trip at a time. PjShorthorn
2339570,MrSimon,2014-01-10 12:06:00,922,"My resolution is to take better care of my tackle and equipment ... stay organized ... keep the boat clean ... and do more preventative maintenance. I feel like I spend too much time and money buying new stuff, when I should just take care of what I already have."

2311490,bigtimeelectric,2014-01-01 07:53:00,174,Nice list Bill!!! Maybe leave them bouncers at home in South Dakota to force you to catch fish by alternative means! I am trying to get the group to come up in mid August so I will be picking your brain on them new spots you found! Better be carefull on finding them new spots knowing you pretty soon you will start running into Mahkwa boats.... Haha I am just jealous and I need a new boat to run as far as you do I would need to pull a fuel tanker with me everyday to hang with you!!!! Happy new year!
2311674,Freytown,2014-01-01 08:42:00,770,Only one resolution for me: Head North when ice is gone...fish till it freezes up.
2311826,bigwalleye1,2014-01-01 09:18:00,2632,"Freytown for the win!!! Every year when I go to Canada, upon my return, I put away any and all excess funds in a special account for only that, planning for the summer I retire. I figure I should be abe to rent a cabin in the lodge for the summer, and friends that want to can come join me as they can."
2312074,HeHooksHimself,2014-01-01 10:30:00,725,Excess cash? Not sure what that is
2312466,tlars,2014-01-01 13:01:00,137,My wife loves to sit and watch a bobber. We need to do more of that in South Inlet.
2312922,btmbncr,2014-01-01 16:17:00,492,"BigtimeRelief is spelled ""Backtroller Avid"" with a 70 hp Suzuki.You don't have to pick my brain,I'll personally escort you to some spots down South that will make you a believer.One resolution I should have made was to not try and drink like my son in law.Bill"
2329617,NickDalasio,2014-01-07 08:39:00,34,"Catch a pike over 40"". I make this resolution every year, sooner or later...."
2329697,packpro,2014-01-07 09:04:00,695,"I resolve to drastically cut down on my tackle. I make this one every year......no success yet. I kept track one year. 7 jigs, one Williams spoon and one swim bait. That is all I used for a week. Caught a ton of fish. Nevertheless, full pack taken the next year. I always find my self thinking......What if this happens, what I decide to fish for ???????, What if this condition exists. Ahhhhhh too much thinking just take the whole thing. When my partner picks up the box and groans, it's embarrassing. I am really going to pair down this year... Wait, what if it is a trolling bite. I'm going to need spinners, Bottom bouncers, Line counters, inline weights, screw on rod holders, tail dancers, flouro leaders, etc. Back soon I'm off to one or all of the tackle stores in the area. Better add a few Plano boxes to the list."
2329873,stjoeguy,2014-01-07 10:07:00,979,"Oh, that hits close to home. Good resolution. Every year I use 2% of the tackle I haul up north. But maybe this is the year I'll need it all ..right."
