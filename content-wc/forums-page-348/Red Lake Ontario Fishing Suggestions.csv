He is a good angler and knows all the tricks. it would be in your best interest to get in touch with him"

2307234,pjshorthorn,2013-12-30 10:04:00,5654,"Howdy Folks: I just received some bathymetric maps of Red Lake and was wondering if anyone would have some suggestions on areas of the lake to concentrate on while there. I'll be going the first week of August for the first time and staying on the western end of the lake at Black Bear Lodge. I'm taking a guess that the fish will most likely be in at least 20+ FOW at that time of year. The maps I received have decent enough detail to pick out the obvious structure and the depths are nicely noted. Looking for suggestions on areas to fish anywhere from Trout Bay and Pipestone Bay at the western end all the way easterly to at least the Fisher Islands area. Any feedback on past successes in general areas would be appreciated. I'm sure the outfitter will provide plenty of suggestions when we arrive, but I would like to start putting together a game plan while the cold weather keeps us cooped up. Thanks in advance for any help you may be able to provide. PjShorthorn"
2307714,Jatar,2013-12-30 13:47:00,169,"Stayed at BBL the first week of August a couple of years ago, caught fish in 3', 6', 12', 20', 35' on the big reef, caught them on sand bottom, rock bottom, in the weeds, trolling, casting, jigging. Just look for structure and current."
2308761,Guest,2013-12-30 19:50:00,0,Never have fished in Red Lake but we have had numerous people in camp that come back with great stories of fishing the Pipestone area. It is also a favorite spot for a lot of groups fishing in the Red Lake Classic in the fall. From what I hear it's not difficult to get lost there so make sure you are using your GPS. Good Luck!
2308881,AllenW,2013-12-30 21:16:00,11482,"imho, the trick to lakes as large as Red are to pick a smaller section and work it. Late Sept the big fish are usually deeper and the smaller ones in closer to shore, 25-35 for deep and 4-12 foot for shallow, not sure about Aug. Where are you staying? I'll try and find my lake map, it has a lot of spots we have hit over the years and I'll try and find some close to where you'll be. Al"
2309050,pjshorthorn,2013-12-31 03:44:00,5654,Al:Will be staying at Black Bear Lodge on the western end of the lake. The bay that camp is located on dumps right into Hall Bay with Pipestone to the NW and Trout Bay due east.Thanks for the help.PjShorthorn
2310793,AllenW,2013-12-31 17:50:00,11482,"Not sure how much help I'll be, we stayed either close to the town of Red Lake or at the Chikunini (sp?)River Camp grounds just outside of Red and usually headed east. We did hit the rapids up the Chikuni though, that's where it comes into Red, it's a popular spot so get there early.As you get to the rapids you'll see a small pond like section, fish right along the current and into the pond a bit, run right up to the shoreline next to the rapids..if that makes any sense.It is deep there and walleyes or northerns sit on the break it seemsWe used 1/2 to 3/4 oz jigs with minnows or slip bobbers with live bait.You need to feel the bottom but stay a few inches off it with jigs, or bring a lot of jigs. I'd bounce the jig occasionally off the bottom to make sure I was close, this method works well all over the lake.Don't be afraid to go deeper, 30-35 fow was our best depths, you'll find sauger in 50' of water but they blow up like balloons bringing them up so if your not looking for lunch I'd stay in that 35 foot range or less.Forestry point can be good, windy days make it a challenge but we had good luck zig zaging shallow to deep till we found where they were.We usually spent no more than a hour there, seems like it can be spotty there.Don't miss McKenzie island, some really big fish have been caught there, I have a friend who has a home on the island and the fish he catches there are awesome.Try the center east side first maybe.Also on the way to pipestone/trout there's a bay that on the left side as your looking from the lake to the bay has a small opening where a creek comes out, we caught trout and northers in that opening by going upstream to the rapids and tossing spoons as we drifted back, there's a small pond just before it goes into the main lake that makes maneuvering easy.I'll see if I can figure out where it is, or maybe somebody else knows?Al"
2318417,cwb,2014-01-03 17:27:00,13,I have been to Blackbear the last week of July the past 3 years.We have caught most of our fish around the mouth of wolf bay in wolf bay and the mouth of golden arm.The cushion bouy can be good also.Depths can vary from year to year.Some years they were shallow 7-15 ft some years 20-30 plus.Talk to Jim when you get there he will point you in the right direction.Also take a trip to suffel?lake the fishing can be great there.
2322233,pjshorthorn,2014-01-05 09:24:00,5654,"CWB: Thanks for the info. Leaving the bay the camp is located in, which way did you turn to go to Wolf Bay and Golden Arm once reaching the main lake ? My map doesn't have those areas noted. I appreciate the feedback. PjShorthorn."
2322857,cwb,2014-01-05 12:07:00,13,"Golden arm is almost straigt out of the bay just stay to the right of potato island.Wolf bay is the next bay to the right, wolf narrows can be good too."
