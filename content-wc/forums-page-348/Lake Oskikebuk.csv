Have to use caution as there are narrows with strong current and open water areas when entering into the lake in the winter, as well as the lake you cross to get into the Buck (Deschambault) can be troublesome at times too with open water, ice heaves, etc. Has a good population of nice eating sized walleye. I know lots make the trek there towards the end of ice fishing season here and have good luck. You can also catch Northerns as well, but I think most that fish there tend to target eyes. I have no idea on depth but assume most fishing would be done in the 8-20' range. Are you going with a group this winter? What are some specific items you need? I'll ask my buddy, he's been there several times. I'll assume you are staying at a camp on Deschambault?"

What will the weather be like - I know you don't have a crystal ball but cool in daytime cold at night? Northern lures, leaders, walleye lures? Have you or they used preserved bait-minnows? Is that leaga legal? Is there good size and numbers? Again any info will be appreciated. Thank You in advance."
