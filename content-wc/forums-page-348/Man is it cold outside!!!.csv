2323881,Pooch,2014-01-05 17:29:00,4619,I'm a wussy. It is way too cold for this little farm boy. House is all but shakin' in this wind. Yard is full of snow blowing off the cornfields and filling in around our buildings.Hoping wind dies down tomorrow so I can start digging out. In the dark it looks like more than my PU and snow plow can handle. Just start chewing away and take my time. Doubt the skid steer will even start or stay running in these temps.House fire two nights ago just north of me. Not a hope in 'ell of the FD saving anything. Wind just pushed the fire through the house in minutes it was gone. Put it in the basement before FD could even do anything. Started by a space heater. Not sure how it went down though. Everyone got out.We are not using our fire place as I don't know how this kind of wind will mess up the draft. Can tell which way the wind is blowing by which rooms are cold. Glad the garage and office are on the north end of the house tonight!You guys be careful out there. Pooch

Be safe, find someone you love, and steal their blankets ..."
