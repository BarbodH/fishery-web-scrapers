No complaints at all about our hosts but we are basically renting a cabin from them. Just dont want to stiff them if they are expecting cash. Thanks, Slushfish"
2311946,btyreprich,2014-01-01 09:58:00,1067,"Our group has always tipped the employees of the camp we visit - not the owners.People we have tipped include the ""dock boy"" who fills up our gas tank every day and gets us the minnows we need.We also tip the staff members who bring us our bath towels and empties the kitchen trash can."
2312186,pjshorthorn,2014-01-01 11:09:00,5654,"I also tip the camp staff that do the heavy lifting and make sure we have what is needed each day. Wood, gas up boat, bait, loading/unloading gear, special requests for items that may have been forgotten and available in camp, etc. Depending on the how much the staff does for us during our trip, I personally will kick in $10-$20 per day. I view the staff as an important part of making my trips enjoyable and a tip is the smallest expense of the trip. I've come to find that most of the full time camp staff do rely upon tips as a sizable part of their income. When they go out of their way to do an exceptional job, I for one recognize those efforts with a tip. Keep in mind that a tip doesn't always have to be strictly monetary. If you find out a staff member is a musky fisherman and you are as well, find out what tackle they like and give them a lure before you leave. If you find out that a person who is working evenings will be having hotdogs for dinner and you are cooking ribs, invite them over for a nice meal. If you have a long standing visit with one camp, find some old pictures of camp from past trips years ago; have them reproduced and framed for the owners or staff member/ guide....they will truly understand how much you've enjoyed their hospitality and your time visiting. Years ago I noticed one young staff member wearing cold weather gloves that were flat worn out. I had brought multiple pairs of fleece lined water resistant gloves and didn't use them during the trip. I gave him two pairs and he was dumbfounded. He said that the gloves were too nice to use for work so they would be his ""driving"" gloves. The next year when he picked us up at the dock to make the hour boat trip to camp, he had his driving gloves on and they were still brand new looking... Take care and Tight Lines, PjShorthorn"
2315785,Slushfish,2014-01-02 17:04:00,263,"I agree completely. My issue is, we've grown to be quite close with the owners, who are the only staff there. The wife does bring us towels but, other than that, we basically serve ourself. I think it would make them feel awkward offering them money. I suppose the thing to do would be to try, and see if they accept. or maybe a nice gift would work well. Slushfish"
2316041,Blades-n-Beads,2014-01-02 18:29:00,484,"Slushfish, I think you hit the nail on the head, I think a gift of some sort is in order. I do think offering money is kinda out due to they are the owners."
2317273,ftfarms,2014-01-03 10:26:00,444,We do both. All three places we stay are run by the owners and no outside help. So we take some real thick and the best around 16-18oz ribeyes for the owners we give them to them when we first get there and when we leave we leave some cash on the table based on there performance usually $10-$20 a man that stayed there
2321617,revitup,2014-01-05 04:24:00,140,"We also went to a camp run only with family. We gave them $20/person and they were just as excited as if they were the paid deck hand. If you buy a steak, or a knife, or whatever, there's only one thing you can do with it. If you give them money you might be helping towards paying off something that is causing great stress and you are certainly helping their bottom line. That's just what we do."
