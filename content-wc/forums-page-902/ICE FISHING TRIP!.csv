526242,Arkie eye jerker,2003-01-26 13:13:00,228,Are you talking about trading Ice fishing or summer fishing trip?
526243,Rod Bender,2003-02-05 09:34:00,0,"Did you make your trip to Browns? If so how was the fishing? We are planning a trip up the middle of this month, never been there before"
526244,Fitch,2003-02-11 20:42:00,75,Sorry for the late reply. Been out of town and computer problems. Job took over the life and never made it up. It been so fridgely cold. I am not sure if they have shacks to rent or not at Browns but would be something to consider if you going to make a trip. Well have to clean off the desk. Good Luck with your trip.
526228,Fitch,2003-01-04 23:09:00,75,I was talking to a guy that was just up to Brown's Clearwater West Lodge by Atikokan and they had best fishing ever. They usually just fish trout but there is a new lake open just accross the road from the camp that they are caughting walleyes in also. Trout before lunch and walleyes after lunch. No use waiting till spring. I'am heading up next weekend if I can get a note from the wife!!! If you know what I mean.
526229,SD Fisher,2003-01-05 21:21:00,90,"Would you happen to have a phone # or website for Browns, sounds like a possible future fishing trip. Thanx in advance."
526230,Fitch,2003-01-05 22:27:00,75,Here is there website http://www.brownsclearwaterlodge.com/frameset.htm and phone # 800-900-4240. Have a good trip!
526231,tracker,2003-01-07 17:20:00,91,"I was up there last winter, but only fished Turtle Lake which is across the road. I pulled a pike, a bass, a whitefish, a lake trout and a walleye all out of the same hole all within a few hours."
526232,eyewitness,2003-01-10 12:03:00,680,"Fitch, appreciate your suggestion and comments. Looked at their web site and they don't say anything about having any accomodations for winter fishing. Is that more of an informal thing? I assume you've been there before. Could you drop me an email with a way I can contact you about this place. You responded to my other post. I would just like to hear about the place from someone other than the owner. My email is listed in my profile. Thanks!"
526233,Guest,2003-01-10 18:55:00,0,"I just checked it out and they do indeed show ice fishing. Have a look thru the take a tour or whatever they show and you will see.They show a 40lb laker as the world record though??... I'm almost sure its higher than that?Looks like a nice place, but the price is a little high for a canuck even with there canuck buck at par.......Is that the normal rate you southerners pay for a trip to Ontario or what?"
526234,Guest,2003-01-10 19:35:00,0,"That records been broken probably over a thousand or more timesThe real big fellas come out of Great Bear Lake in the North West Territories every summer,the year before it was 67 lbs, this year it was over 70."
526236,eyewitness,2003-01-11 03:28:00,680,"Yea, they show a couple of pics, but it doesn't say anything about winter rates or anything else....."
526237,Guest,2003-01-11 18:42:00,0,Good answer... mayby email them and see what the rates are....Where or what do you want to Ice Fish for in Ontario?I live just north of Barrie and around here I know where all species of fish are and I record good catches of each... if you want to come down this way your welcome to come out for a great day of fishing.Better yet..... does anyone want to trade a weekend of awesome fishing (at my end) for a weekend of Turkey Hunting(at your end) ?
526235,Guest,2003-01-20 11:33:00,0,"Regarding the 40 lbs Lake Trout at Browns' Clearwater West Lodge. It is the world record through the ice, it was caught on February 20, 1987 on Clearwater West Lake and still holds today at the National Fresh Water Fishing Hall & Fame. We got close in 2001 to beating it with a 37.3 lbs.So please check it out.Thank You"
