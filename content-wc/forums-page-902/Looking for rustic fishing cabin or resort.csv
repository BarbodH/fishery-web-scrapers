I'm specifically looking for rustic, bare bones type cabins in a drive-in or fly-in type situation with either canoes or boat rentals available. Can anybody toss out any suggestions?"

527537,Walli,2003-02-09 10:23:00,63,Hi-I have a three bedroom cabin on a Rainy Lake island that I rent out weekly-it would sleep around 7 people and has power and shower ect. [email protected]
527538,Dand,2003-02-09 12:17:00,2,"http://www.horseshoeislandcamp.com/Have a look at this place. This will be our 3rd summer going to them,haven't been disappointed yet. The cabins are clean,rental boats and the lake is allways safe to go out on. I don't think we will ever catch any monsters there but there are good numbers. This is the first time I have posted on this board,so please don,t think that I work for these people. I just had two good summer trips there and the price was good for what we got. Dand"

Their website is www.aircochrane.com, and they handle all the fly-ins to the Kesagami Outposts in the Eastern Ontario James Bay region. It's rustic, the equiptment was great (new 14 footers and new 8hp 4 strokes) and wouldn't hesitate to book with them again. Had an excellent trip there in 2001, and when you look at the price it's even better. Feel free to e-mail if you've any questions."

527541,Jimmy J,2003-02-10 12:20:00,2,I took a look at their web page. Looks first rate and those are the type of bare bone cabins I was referring to.Thanks for the response.
527542,Guest,2003-02-10 12:28:00,0,Go http://www.justfishontario.com and check out the Trip Finder section. They email your specs out to all the lodges on the site and then the lodges who have what you are looking for email you. I used it last year and found a great place. The guy even emailed me thanking me for using the Trip Finder. Thumbs up.
