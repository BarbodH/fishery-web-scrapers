527546,Guest,2003-02-09 13:10:00,0,This will be my 6th trip to Canada and we are going to LacSeul this year(the far North West end). For the first time I am tieing my own spinner rigs and was wonder if any of you have a disign that you find works better than another. I am tying mine 3 feet in length with a trebble hook and the end and a regular hook 1 1/2 inches up followed by five beads and then the blade clip. Hoping some more experienced tiers can let me know if this is a good design or if I might be better off by changing a thing or two. Thanks for any and all help.
