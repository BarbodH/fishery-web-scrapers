Cant get our cabin for mid June at GoldenHook so this year we are gonna go back to Packwash, anyone have any good info on how the fishing has been thru the past 5 years or so? It used to be great, but in the early-mid 90's it got progressively slower and harder to find big fish."

527422,Guest,2003-02-07 11:22:00,0,"I have been fishing Pakwash for years. Have never had any trouble getting all the fish I wanted. In my opinion the fishing on pakwash like in many lakes seems to have picked up considerably. Lots of days we pick up 40 to 50 walleye ranging from nice eaters to 24-28"". I would say 75 to 80% are in the 16 to 19 inch range.We usually go in mid June the walleye are thick off the sand beach in that big bay where the park is and a resort right close by. Good Fish'n"

527425,Guest,2003-02-08 12:58:00,0,We stay at pakwash lake camp. New owner last year and they are great.Have a feeling that it will soon become the camp of choice on pakwash.The camp is centrally located so regardless of time of year you are only minutes from the walleye. Makes a big difference at the end of the week when you get your gas bill. Faces west across the lake---love the sunsets.Seems to get enough breeze that the mosquitoes are not near as bad as the camps we have stayed at on rivers.
527424,Guest,2003-02-10 12:13:00,0,"I spent a week in early July on Pakwash the summer before last. We didn't have ""great"" walleye fishing, but it was plenty good enough to keep me interested and willing to go back. The weather was very changeable the week we were there, which didn't help. The wind blew often, so most days we stuck to the north end of the lake due to rough water. Stayed at Trout River Lodge, which is just off the highway.No doubt the pattern will be a little different in June, but we caught a few bigger fish (4 to 7 pounds) in 20 to 25 FOW just off islands. The best numbers came from 8 to 12 FOW off windy points with sand and/or smaller rocks -- mostly 16 to 19 inchers. The sand off the beach at the park was real good one evening, but we couldn't get 'em going there after that. We also pulled quite a few walleye from shallow weed edges in Bruce Lake."
