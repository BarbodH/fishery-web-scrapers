The last lodge we stayed at had an otter that came to the dock every night and tested all the minnow buckets. If the bucket was not wired shut, the otter had himself a fresh meal. The little guy was very good and a wire twisted only once did not stop him. HAVE A GOOD ONE"
527565,Guest,2003-02-11 13:15:00,0,We always bring a small minnow trap and catch our own....find a small feeder creek and put it in with some bread and we had it filled in about 2 hours.Or just keep your minnows in the lake in a large bucket tied to the dock...
527566,Thumper,2003-02-11 16:04:00,133,"Isn't using a minnow trap to just store the minnows likely to incur the wrath of the MNR - at least in Ontario? I recall reading in the fishing regs that non-residents aren't allowed to catch any minnows or leeches. Even if you purchased minnows from a bait daler and just kept them in a minnow trap, you might have a MNR officer cite you.I like the 5-gallon bucket idea. I've had otter & raccoon issues with minnow buckets as well, so you'd probably want to devise some way to strongly secure the bucket before heading in for the night.I've got some instructions on salting minnows - http://www.torgerud.com/fishing/SaltedMinnows.asp- Rick"
527567,Wawajake,2003-02-11 17:22:00,413,"Or you can stop in at Young's General Store on your way thru Wawa and pickup all your bait needs and pickles out of the wooden barrels. Then when your out of beer and are back in Wawa , drop in at Young's General Store for more bait and pickles.I should get paid for advertising for these folks but I just like the atmosphere they have when I am up at my camp near Wawa.Now if your flying from Wawa that's a different story :) jake"
527554,Ohio fisherman,2003-02-09 19:09:00,989,"Hi Guys: We are planning a trip near Wawa Ontario for the season opener on May 17. We will be staying at a remote cabin on a lake. What do you suggest for bait - minnows, crawlers, or leeches? My experience says minnows for the early season, but would like to hear from others. Also, what do you do to keep your minnows alive at a remote cabin. We will not have electricity for a pump, but could run a battery air pump. We have never fished this early when this was a concern, so I do not know, is it permitted to take minnows into Canada? All suggestions are appreciated! Thanks, Ohio fisherman"
527555,Trailerguy,2003-02-09 19:51:00,1407,"I can tell you for sure that you can't take minnows to Canada. Purchase what you need when you get there, or take salt preserved minnows, but delare them at the boarder. Crawlers can be taken without any soil, leeches you have to get there as well."
527556,Guest,2003-02-10 06:18:00,0,"I don't know if crawlers are good as early season bait. If you do take them be sure they are in commercial worm bedding and not soil. What I do is use the small foam boxes that have lid on two sides-each across from the other and held by two elastic bands. (They are often sold with a package of worm bedding) Follow directions for bedding preparation by using non clorinated water in the amount called for at least 24 hours in advance. After chilling the bedding put the worms in, 2 to 3 dozen. When fishing, I place the worm box in a small cooler along with a gel pack from the freezer which I put in the bottom of the cooler. Bring extra gel packs so you can have one chilling while you are out fishing. At night replace with a fresh gel pack or put the worm box in the refrigerator. The two side worm box is nice because the worms will go to the bottom and you can turn the box over and open the side the worms are nearest to."
527557,Mike KS,2003-02-10 07:38:00,18,We fish at a remote site and have a tough time keeping minnows alive. I always pick up a carton of Preserved minnows from Uncle Josh Baits. They work very well and all you have to do is type Uncle Josh Baits into your search engine and order from them . They will ship directly to you and the price is cheap for the number of baits. I usally get the jumbos and they produce fish....Good Luck
527558,Dave,2003-02-10 08:21:00,258,"Ohio Fisherman:If you can get leeches, I've found them very hearty. We keep them in a cooler, no air pump, and change the water every morning when we fill up the leech lockers.Dave"
527559,Karl,2003-02-11 07:54:00,63,"Couple years ago I had an opportunity to spend 24hrs on a flyin lake (I stay at a drive-to base camp.) Just as the plane was airborne, I realized we didn't take the minnows out of the baitshack.The short of it is - take along a couple packages of Berkeley Power Grubs. I used the white on an orange jig and most casts the jig never made it all the way to the bottom before a fat 18in walleye grabbed it.I have since tried them on occasions where jig/minnow wasn't working well, or when the walleye were short-biting (stealing) the minnow off the jig, and had much more success hooking them."
527560,Mahumba,2003-02-11 08:20:00,345,"Hi Ohio Fisherman,Went you get into Canada buy your minnow here to save hassles.To keep them alive for your remote trip get them packaged 2 dozen to a bag and fill with oxygen. This will keep them alive until you get to your cabin.To keep them alive while you are there purchase a minnow trap. Then crimp down the two openings so they can't get out. Place the minnows in and attach a rope, throw them in the lake and tie off to the dock. The water will be cold enough that time of year that they will be lively for a looooong time.It's a great way to keep lots of minnows alive for those long trips.You can also fashion a wire mesh box with a flip top lid but I find the minnow traps lighter and more portable when you are thinking of flying.Roger Mayer."
527561,BD,2003-02-11 09:03:00,739,"We use 5-gallon pails drilled full of holes like a minnow bucket liner would be. Cut half of the tabs off of the top of the bucket so it can be opened easier. When you get to the lake place your oxygen filled minnow bags into the water so the shock of the temp change doesn't kill them. After the minnows have acclimated to the new temp you can place a flat rock in the bucket, dump the minnows in, and sink the bucket near the shore. You can keep 20 dozen minnows for a week without problems."
527563,Stevie B,2003-02-11 09:21:00,157,"BD is right, the best way to keep minnows alive in to keep them in the lake. What I like to do is use a larger bucket like BD described and a smaller one for in the boat for the day. I find that a leach locker with a twist off lid works really well for holding enough bait for the day. However if you are heading in to a north manitoba lake be careful becasue live bait is not allowed north of the Bloodvein river in manitoba. And from experience frozen minnoews are all you are going to need.Happy Fishing!!"
527562,Mahumba,2003-02-11 09:42:00,345,"Hi Bd,The bucket is a great idea. Better than wrecking a minnow trap! Roger Mayer."
