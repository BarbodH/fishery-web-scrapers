527574,Mike KS,2003-02-10 16:04:00,18,Every time I sit down with the symptons of Cabin Fever accompanied by the visions of being on my favorite Walleye spot about 100 days from now I cant help but think about who taught me to fish and those old memorys. I dont know about the rest of you but my Dad and my Granddad are 100% responsible for this fishing addiction I have and about $3000 worth of Rods and reels and enough tackle boxes stuffed with what they were biting on yesterday to open my own Used Tackle Store. I still have some of their old tackle and they have both been fishing Lake Heaven for 35 years. Im trying like ##### to pass on the love for fishing to my grandkids now. My Son and both my Daughters are infected and taking my Grandson to Canada last year made him break out with a bad case of Fi****is. Im sure you all are aware that Fi****is is only curable on the water. Anyhow do you ever think about your teacher and those good old Bobber Days????

Other kids probably remember their first bikes ;). Anyways, I would go fish a dead minnow for pike at a bridge near my place, and learned a lot from a retired insomniac old drunk and a few other guys on welfare who would be there every day :). I still reel with the wrong hand, just like he did :)."
527576,River Rat,2003-02-10 18:07:00,43,My Dad and five of his friends were partners on a cabin in Minnesota. Three of the men had no kids that enjoyed fishing. They kind of adopted me. I went to the cabin any time someone was going up. They always took me on the hunting trips too. It was GREAT.

My fishing memories were mostly spent with a friend and his father on trout streams in N.E. Iowa. I chuckle when I think of those overnight camping trips and the fun we had catching 8-10 inch trout at various small streams and sleeping in a tent. We would start out using panther martin spinners and usually end up with a can of corn or a package of velvetta cheese. I remember one night my friends father hanging our tennis shoes over the fire to dry them out. We had to go home early the next day barefoot. Now I fish alot with my 12 year old son and in the few years he's been fishing we've become fishin buddies. Don't forget to take your kids fishing. It makes for lasting memories. Bigfish"
