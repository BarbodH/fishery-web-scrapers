527404,IaDave,2003-02-06 14:24:00,476,Cabin fever has set in. I've been spending my lunch hour at Gander Mountain. Thank God Cabelas is 1-1/2 hours away. But anyway while I was there today they had their bird calls going over their intercom system and one call reminded me of Canada. I just want to know the name of the bird. Its not the loon. It is a bird that is on shore but you can never see it. It has a very loud call almost like a Cardinal. Once you get it in your head it is hard to forget. Is it the Northern Jay.? Help me out so I can sleep tonite.

Robbins & others"

527407,Guest,2003-02-08 08:39:00,0,It might be the Kingfisher we have some around our camp.
527408,Michigander,2003-02-08 18:52:00,33,"From your description of the call, it sounds like it might be the Connecticut warbler. Get a tape and listen to that one, and see if it's the one you're thinking of. I know we hear them frequently on our trips to NW Ontario......they're always in the brushy stuff along the lakeshore (can't ever see them). Rob"

527410,Guest,2003-02-10 06:35:00,0,"I would bet that it is a Sand Piper ( small ""fist like"",long legs,Tannish color, high piched song"
527411,TeeDub,2003-02-10 16:08:00,48,"One of the birds I love to hear over the water is a black capped chickadee. Not the normal chick-a-dee-dee-dee call, but the other clear high-pitched two tone call that they use a lot. Maybe a mating call? The first part of the call is high pitched and the second a lower pitch and sometimes doubled. The bird books describe it as sounding like Feeeee-BeeeEeee. My wife says it sounds like they're saying Heeeyyyyyyy Baabyyyyyyy! I just know that it's a neat, relaxing sound that carries over water for what seems like miles. You'd think it would come from a much larger bird."
