527569,alan ex pup,2003-02-10 12:37:00,126,Hi. went to eagle lake 3 times. this was 20 years ago an did not find the fishing bad at all. My biggest problem it seemed was submerged rocks that I would occasionally run over but then they are all over canada. The brochures i would say make any place look good no matter how they really are. Even to this day the first time we go to a new place we get the worst cabin. after you are there and see the other cabins then the following year you have a better idea of the cabin you want.
527570,fishmaster,2003-02-10 18:03:00,209,Hey dutchboyBeen fishing Eagle for lot of years the last few up around Vermilion Bay. Vermilion Bay Lodge is a nice play to stay Equipment is up to date and the ower takes care of you well. Nice family run camp that does not have all the hype that some of the other camps have. You won't have to be on a schedule like some camps and you come and go as you want. Yea you will have to contend with the occasional big rock at or just below the surface but you will have that in most lakes in Canada.Check out the web site for www.vermilionbaylodge.comWhat you see will not be pictures from 15 or 20 years ago like you see from some places.Good luck on your venture to finding quality camp to visit this season.
