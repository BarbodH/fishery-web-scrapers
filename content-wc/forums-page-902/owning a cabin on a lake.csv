I have been looking and in about 5 years hope to buy something probably on LOTW since I hear land is not for sale around Lac saul. Just curious about your experiences and lessons learned or regrets. My email is [email protected] Thanks a lot Alan"
527413,srj,2003-02-07 15:10:00,971,I have a cabin on Whitefish Bay of Lake of the Woods. Quite a few properties are bought/sold each year. Suggest you check with the realtors from the regions you have an interest in.

527416,dlhomes,2003-02-09 07:34:00,62,Try http://www.kenoraontario.net/ and click on Real Estate Brokers. This will get you all area Realtors. We had no luck w/ Cabin Country Realtor. He wouldn't show us a proprty we wanted to see(drove by and pretended he couldn't find it)- it wasn't his listing so we ended up getting hold of the listing agent and buying it! We've had it 4 yrs and has approx. doubled in value so expect the same. Seems the Canucks have figured out us Yanks!

527417,dlhomes,2003-02-10 20:00:00,62,"Yeah I get spammed alot from Canadian sites, don't know why!! If you get there just write down some of the Realtors and do a search. I've looked up most of them but can't find what I'm looking for- a vacant lot on LOTW on Long Bay for under &75K !!!! Good Luck!"
