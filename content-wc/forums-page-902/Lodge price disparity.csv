526822,Guest,2003-02-01 00:30:00,0,We have been going to lac saul for the first 20 years and lotw last year. Any resort that advertises heavily charges a lot in us funds. At lotw last year we stayed at crawfords camp at sioux narrows. he does not advertise and does not do shows. he charges in canadian funds. one room cabin about 350 canadian for 2 people.the boat was another 350 canadian. If I had it to do over again I would look for resorts that charge in canadian. They dont have to pay the bank the high finance rates to buy the canadian resort. It was paid for a long time ago and only needmake their money. inthebrochuresthey hand out the shows check out the winter address. its somewhere in the states. These are owned by americans and they have big morgages to pay and they only have 3 months to make their money. I talked to the owner about the price disparity. Going to the all canadian show for 5 weeks cost a lot of money so does advertising. he survives with his established clients. LOTW also has lake trout. early june they are shallow. otherwise you need downriggers. Its a toss up LS less traffic less people willing to travel that far north good fishing. LOTW cottages on every island- something to think about buying someday. When I was a kid our folks only fished LOTW that was 45 years ago- I dont think there were paved roads to LS then. My .04 cents. Thanks Alan
526823,Trailerguy,2003-02-02 09:19:00,1407,"Alan, You bring up some good points, but here's some rebuttal. Your guy charged you $700 cnd or $466 USD for a 1 room bare, bones cabin. That's cool. Did you know the minestry through their tourism will pay the lodge owner to go to shows in the states? They also will subsidize advertising. Now why would they do that you ask? Because those USD are being taxed at about 15%. Now which is better for Canada your guy or the one down the road that plays the market, gives people the comfort level they expect, and is attentive to their guests. Not all these American lodge owners have a morgage, some payed it off 20 yrs ago. And anybody that has been around a camp knows the money may come in in 3 months but the work is 365 days a year. And certianly they are after a profit. What ever your work is, would you do it without a profit? I say again, ""you get what you pay for."""
526824,alan ex pup,2003-02-02 10:25:00,126,"OK. you make some good points. The 466 was for the cabin boat and motor freezer and the other normal stuff. You are right, this year I will pay a little more and hopefully have a nicer cabin and other amenities. Its hard telling from the brochure pictures how things realy are. The older I get the nicer I want things. This year I am taking my Lund tyee up there."
526827,NateW,2003-02-02 16:41:00,96,"Anybody who think $500 is too much for week's worth of World-Class fishing on Lac Seul should never become a whitetail hunter! If you ever want to pay to trophy whitetails you'll pay $5,000 for a five day hunt! And that doesn't include an shore lunche either!By the time we all pay our camp fees, share of food, gas, bait, licenses atc. It costs us about $700 per person for seven days of fishing on Lac Seul. Haven't had a trip yet that wasn't worth every penny!"
526825,Guest,2003-02-02 22:10:00,0,"I don't know where 'Trailer Trash"" gets his info but there is NO govn't payments for shows or anything else in Ontario!!! The only way we have a camp is through D### hard work, the investment of over a half million hard earned $US and the rates we charge are next to rediculusly cheap for what we provide. Next time you think we are raping you at $550 per person, go with the rest of the crazies to Disneyland with a family and see if they let you off for this rate while providing you with the best vacation value for your dollar you can get in a safe and clean environment; oh by the way see if they will let you kill Mickey and take him home to freezer burn till you throw him out."
526826,Trailerguy,2003-02-03 15:44:00,1407,"Camp owner, I get my info from a Lodge owner and good freind of over 25 years, who takes advantage of the system. With an attitude like yours it's a wonder you have any business at all!"
526828,Guest,2003-02-08 11:48:00,0,"From my experience, you get what you pay for. If you want to stay in the $400-$500/week places, don't expect much."
526829,alan ex pup,2003-02-09 11:08:00,126,"If you look through the brochures generally speaking the 500 a week is housekeeping where you do everything yourself. the 1000 a week is american plan where you are there and they do everything for you like cook and guide, bait your hook take the fish off the hook clean the fish, etc etc etc. its like if they did anymore there would be nothing for you to do."
526830,Vitreum,2003-02-09 12:24:00,221,"actually alan, you are talking more like 1500-2000 bucks per week with all that you mentioned. i.e. guides, chow, etc. i still see a big discrepancy in pricing. guess i'll never find out about those places since i am perfectly happy making do for myself. i do have an advantage since i stay in the ear falls area about 5 minutes from a restaurant, grocery, bait shop, etc. to each his own, i guess."
526831,alan ex pup,2003-02-10 10:58:00,126,we stayed at the timberlane lodge by ear falls for many years till they changed hands this last time. then we stayed at golden fawn the 4 years after that. Yes its all very nice and when its really windy the wife and i would catch fish right in that area and toward the dam. good around the rail bridge and when the water is up in that little water back behind evergreen past where the minnow guy parks his sea planes. On windy days though getting to the sactuary would be an accomplishment not to mention mckenzie bay or sawmill.
526812,Guest,2003-01-23 08:56:00,0,"LS camps cater to fishermen, not water skiers, jet skiers and the like. Lake of the Woods get alot of familys, kids, wifes, etc. that demand alot more services, pools, hot tubs, bars, etc., and the charge more. Yes, LS does have very good fishing. I stay on Abrams Lake and pay about $650. per week plus taxes. (Canadian Money) 2 people in a cabin, everything furnished for bedding and cooking. We don't get meals furnished, no tv in cabins but it nice."
526813,Guest,2003-01-23 09:16:00,0,"The difference between most Lac Seul and Lake of the Woods lodges is the quality of service on the Woods and the facilities themselves. The fishing is just as good or better on the Woods as it is on Seul and it has bigger walleyes on the top end, more and bigger smallmouth,plus the Woods is the greatest muskie fishery ever."
526814,Mike KS,2003-01-23 09:43:00,18,We fished Lake of The Woods several times and Lac Seul many times. My personal experience is that Lac Seul is a better fishing Lake for Walleye and Northren Pike but LOW is better for Smallmouth. I have no personal experience with Muskie so cant speak to that. We like Lac Seul the best because the area we fish has very little boat traffic and is not heavily fished. I also have never seen a water skier or a wave runner where we fish at. But I have seen many awesome Walleye days both in quanity and size. To each his own...I will enjoy LS you continue to enjoy LOW...they are both great fisherys...
526815,Vitreum,2003-01-23 18:12:00,221,"mike, i agree. believe i'll stick with the lac at ear falls. #####, i'm 5 minutes from a restaurant, liquor store, good bait shop, bank, grocery store, etc, etc. decent little town. even has a golf course; i don't play anymore. i am not near skiers or wave runners; i am near bald eagles and sea gulls. don't want anything to do with those wisconsin dells kinda joints."
526816,Guest,2003-01-24 08:39:00,0,"It costs too much for one and reason is because you folks from the States come over and pay what they are asking, plain and simple.I think your insane to pay $1000/US a week or more per person.It doesn't cost me (Or Any Ontario Resident) a dime to camp on crown land unless at a Provincial Park but they got you by the big one's on Lac Seul because Non Residents rightfully can't camp anywhere near the lake anymore.What can you do though, as long as the fishing stays top notch so will the prices."
526817,Guest,2003-01-24 12:54:00,0,"Regarding Post #11 that is the dumbest statement I've seen in a long time. There is no comparision between Lac Suel and Lake of the Woods. Lac Suel is simply great for Northern and Walleye, and the fishing is that way year round. Lasy year we stayed at Mahkwa Lodge on Lac Suel in late July and caught 3 Northern between 15 and 20 lbs. We also caught hundreds of Walleye incuding in the bay in back of our cottage.uffice it to say my trips to Lake of the Woods, albeit good, have never produced fish like Lac Suel."
526819,Guest,2003-01-26 22:01:00,0,"Lac Seul and LOW are both great fisheries guys - I live up here so I know - no use comparing the two they both rock! Basic issue re: price disparities is that some camp owners want to make a profit and others just want to pay the bills. You can't make ANY profit selling a cabin at $US500.00/week - the costs of running a resort are such that it is simply impossible at that rate. People who charge that are primarily concerned over losing existing customers to charge what is needed to pay operating costs plus make some kind of profit. You'll notice that most of the lower-priced resorts have older equipment, rougher cabins and do not regularly upgrade their facilities or build newer cabins. To make any money at the lower rates requires you to have a minimum of at least 20 cabins. So those who charge this rate are content with paying their bills and not making any money - that's okay I guess. Many fisherman are content with older equipment, cabins, etc. so what's the problem? You DO (in most cases) get what you pay for. Higher priced camps have better equipment, better cabins and better service. It all depends on what you are looking for. If price is a big issue then the $500.00 per week place is for you - if it's not that big a deal then spend more - you will notice a difference. The choice is yours.Camps in Canada are priced way too low compared to many camps in Northern Minnesota, Wisconsin and elsewhere in the U.S. where let's say the fishing is of ""lesser quality"". Look at some websites of these U.S. Camps and you'll see how good a deal many camps in Canada really are."
526820,fishy,2003-01-28 00:29:00,20,"Prices at resorts and outposts on LacSeul vary quite alot. Though I've never stayed where they charge $1000 or more, I can say a person spending $400-$500 on LacSeul whether it be an Outpost or resort will be happy to say its money well spent. Ive been to Ojibway Outfitters twice and the $500/person we paid we all considered it a steal.Look at it this way, for some this is a trip of a lifetime. If you want to pay $1000-$2000 then pay it. My money is on the guy who really roughed it and paid $500. Anybody who compares LOW to LacSeul in my estimation has not fished them both. LACSEUL HANDSDOWN!!!!"
526818,Guest,2003-01-28 11:58:00,0,"Kit,You are either very biased or simply naive. Lac Seul is an unbelieveably superior fishery to LOTW. I will grant you that yes, LOTW has more muskie. By more I mean a couple per day. Your comment about walleye is so wrong that I question whether you have ever been on Lac Seul. Lac Seul will far outproduce LOTW in terms of number of walleyes, and even further outproduce in terms of number of large walleyes. In addition, Lac Seul is far less congested, has virtually no pleasure craft, jet skis, etc. (at least the part I fish), has nicer, more natural scenery, and, for the most part, is cheaper. If you want to catch big walleyes and lots of them, go to Lac Seul. If you want a good time in a commercial tourism haven, with a slim chance of catching a big muskie, go to LOTW. My guess would be anyone who monitors this message board would prefer LAC SEUL.Jay"
526821,Guest,2003-01-29 20:23:00,0,"Really wish that all of you that fish and have fished LS would keep refering people to LOTW! Think about it...LOTW is superior to any drive to lake and recommend you keep going there and tell ALL your buddies how great it is!Prefer that all the masses go to LOTW... ensures the rest of us a cabin, solitude and ""sub-par"" fishing to ourselves!Food for thought..."
526802,Vitreum,2003-01-22 18:31:00,221,"i have never been the sharpest knife in the drawer, but i am having a hard time differentiating between the $400-500 lodge week and the $1000-1200 week. i also have seen a large difference between the lake of the woods lodges and the lac seul lodges. lac seul seems to be much cheaper for the most part. kinda strange since i believe lac seul is a better fishery. i know some lodges have slightly better equipment and offer chow, but is that worth double or even triple the price? i'm a $500 per week kinda guy. what am i missing here? some of you high rollers educate me please."
526803,Guest,2003-01-22 18:51:00,0,"Consider LS is about 2.5 hours away from LOTW/Kenora. To some the extra drive time is a factor. I'm with you on the price thing... in the cabin only to eat 2 meals, poop and sleep. Wish it were cheaper!"
526804,Trailerguy,2003-01-22 18:52:00,1407,"You usually get what you pay for, in most cases the experience is not the same at $500 that it is $1500. I've noticed that it usually is a Canadian who complains the lowest price is too much. Most US guys are looking for the best fishing,I guess, and know they have to pay to play. And no I don't own a lodge or profit in anyway from one."
526805,Guest,2003-01-22 20:02:00,0,I don't stay in Lodges but a lot of the yanks I meet complain about the crown land fee and the limits. I've never met a Canadian who has complained about the fee for camping on crown land or the limits. Us Canadians are too poor to stay at a lodge.
526806,daveaz,2003-01-22 20:12:00,16,"I dont think it's a canadian or american thing, its all what your looking for. If you want someone to cook,clean,and basically handle all the crap then you have to pay for it."
526807,Thumper,2003-01-22 21:27:00,133,"How much is this Crown Land Fee? In the US National Forest, I think the rates are aprox $8/night for a campsite. That usually means a parking spot, fire ring, picnic table, with a shared outhouse, dumpster and a water source. If you really want to go cheap, you can camp for free almost anywhere in the Nat'l Forest.I think Minnesota State Park campgrounds are in the $8 - 15 range, plus you need a vehicle sticker for $20 every year.- ThumperBTW - I usually stay at the $400 cabins when I head up to Red Lake, Ont. I bring my own food, towels and sleeping bag, and clean the cabin up before I leave. I wouldn't mind camping for a weekend, but wouldn't want to spend a week in a tent with all of the issues like ice, food, water, bugs, weather, etc. Well, maybe if the fishing was REALLY good! ;-)"
526810,Guest,2003-01-23 06:58:00,0,"Location, location, location. The fact you brought up hasn't been lost on me either. On a very limited basis, I would say the more expensive places have nicer cabins, grounds, and equipment, but I haven't stayed at enough places to say that is always true and wouldn't want to assert that assumption. Another factor could possibly be the amount paid in taxes via property assessment, cost of resort operations like amount of staff, cost of the resort, etc. Moreover, in given locales, resorts pay particular attention to what the going rate is at other resorts in their area. Alot of them may not want to be the cheapest in the area as that may portend an image of having the worst cabins, equipment, etc, but also need to be sensitive to being more expensive if they can't justify the increased price. Lastly, there is always how much profit the resort owner expects to make, but that can be a two edged sword for those who want to charge bigger bucks, but don't have the product package to back it up."
526808,Xplorer,2003-01-23 07:09:00,244,"Thumper, The last time we went camping up near Armstrong the crown land fee for non-residents was $10 per adult per day. And yes we spent the week in a tent (the inlaws had their pickup camper tho). Meals just have to be planned out well to accomodate for the lack of cold storage ie more canned stuff at end of week. I regularily boat-in camp for 4-5 days on the Voyageurs Park border lakes in july/august with no need for additional ice during the stay. Xplorer"
526811,Mike KS,2003-01-23 08:02:00,18,"Our group has stayed at lodges that have ranged in price from $500 to $2000 per week during the last 15 years. If the fishing was all equal the biggest difference is who cooks and washs dishs,who cleans and gases boat,who guides and cleans fish,who has a light in the indoor bathroom or a bucket of lime and a moon door, who runs the cabin broom,who sits in a whirlpool or is just happy to wash their face in warm water,who plays cards in electricity or propane lights,who has baseboard electric heating or a 55 gallon drum wood stove. I know there are many other differences but this is a start.....We perfer outposts because we like the idea of being the only group fishing in that area. If you look close there are lots of great outposts in the $500 to $1000 range."
526809,Xplorer,2003-01-23 08:55:00,244,PS: And the fishing was REAL GOOD:)
