527573,Fitch,2003-02-11 20:23:00,75,I believe the lodge is a few miles before Rusty Myers Flying. I haven't been there but hear it is an ok place to stay. If you want to fly out there are some real great out posts in the area. I know Richard Kungle has a great place. You can get info at www.wildewoodflyin.com or www.rustymyers.com about the area. Hope that helps.
