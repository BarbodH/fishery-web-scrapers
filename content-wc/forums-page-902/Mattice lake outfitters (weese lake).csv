It's one of the better fly-in lakes we've been to in NW Ontario, and we've been on 10 fly-ins. I believe the Attwood River flows in and out of Weese, and there's great walleye fishing near the inlet and outlet. Lots and lots of 16-19"" walleye, and some bigger. We also caught a few 35""+ northerns off of a small island at the north end of the lake. You'll have lots of fun. Bring lots of tripple-ripple grubs (BassPro) (brown is best color) and pink/red/orange jigs."

It's an excellent lake......lots of walleyes in the 16-19"" range, some bigger. We also caught several pike over 35"". The nice thing about Weese is I believe it still has just one outpost camp on the lake (unless it's changed since 99)....so you have the place to yourself, and there's a fair amount of water to fish. I believe the Attwood River flows through Weese, and the inlet and outlet are excellent spots to fish. We also found a small island up in the northern portion of the lake that was tremendous fishing, especially when the waves were beating into it. Bring lots of jigs/plastic, and you will catch all the fish you want. Rob"
