526705,BD,2003-02-08 14:32:00,739,We have used Lake of the Woods Houseboats for many years. You have the freedom to move around to the best fishing areas and not have the sometimes very long ride from the resort to where you want to fish each day. You have your cabin with you and you tow your fishing boat along behind until you get to where you want your personal resort (houseboat) to be. www.lowhouseboats.com

They have three lodges, and you can go to www.totemresorts.com. We will be going back at the end of May this year. Let me know if you need more info."
526697,Guest,2003-01-21 06:21:00,0,"Just an FYI in regards to Totem Lodge, had this sent to me from friends in Thunder Bay: UNDERCOVER OPERATION RESULTS IN $17,000 FINES AGAINST LODGE AND RESORT OWNER Posted Tuesday, May 28, 2002 KENORA Â— A Sioux Narrows tourist resort owner and lodge have been convicted, in two separate trials, of having a large number of walleye over the limit. Eric Brown, 49, of Sioux Narrows, and Totem Lodge of Sioux Narrows Limited have been fined $17,000. Brown and Totem Lodge were fined $1,000 May 15 for an over-possession of walleye, which happened at the lodge. The guide involved in the operation had already been convicted and sentenced. On May 16, Brown was fined $5,000 and Totem Lodge was fined $10,000 for having 49 walleye over the limit at the lodge and at Brown's residence. The convictions and sentencing end an undercover operation conducted by the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) on Lake of the Woods. Justice of the Peace Gordon Buterin took into account the amount of walleye, the commercial connection of the offence and the need for deterrence in arriving at the sentences. The public is asked to protect its natural resources by reporting violations to any MNR office or by calling Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477)."
