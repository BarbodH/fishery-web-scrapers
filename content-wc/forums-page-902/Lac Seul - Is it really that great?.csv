527371,Guest,2003-02-07 14:49:00,0,PLEASE ALL OF YOU GO SOMEPLSCE OTHER THAN LAC SEUL. LAC SEUL FISHING SUCKS..... IT IS THE WORST FISHERY IN CANADA...... DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR YOUR MONEY...GO TO MINAKI OR LOTW OR GULLROCK OR ANY PLACE OTHER THAN LAC SEUL.
527355,Winnie,2003-02-09 11:48:00,375,"Mike,I live in Olathe too. My father-in-law, brother-in-law, and I have hooked up with two other guys, father/son, in Grand Rapids, MN for the last three years and headed on up to Lac Seul. They were going on this trip for 3-4 years before I joined up. We stay near Ear Falls at Goose Bay Camp. We go up for Memorial Day weekend and the following week. I love it. Goose Bay is not a ""full service"" lodge, but that early in the season location is great. I am looking forward to our trip again this year. I don't keep close tabs on the #s we catch, but it's enough to keep us busy. Last year the spring was late and the fishing was off a little, but still very good. You can reach me at [email protected]."
527372,alan ex pup,2003-02-09 12:03:00,126,yes your are right . been going to lac seul for 20 years and its reaaly bad. super high prices and not friendly people.
527373,Guest,2003-02-10 08:24:00,0,"What can I say that has not been said ?? Big body of water, slot size, hard to find a place to stay in June, caught my BIGGEST walleye to date 9 LBS. andI know there are BIGGER ONES !!! Is it really that GREAT ?? If I were you I try any where but Lac Seul so I can have a better shot at that 10 pounder !!! NOTE : I will be back June 7, six years in a row . Is it really that Great ?????????????????"
527374,Guest,2003-02-11 18:13:00,0,I went up to Lac Seul for the first time 3 yrs ago and I consider myself a real rookie walleye fisherman compared to my fishing buddies.We stay at Blackbay outpost last week in July and I dont know if there is a bad month or week to fish for Big Eyes up there.I catch more fish in a week up there than I do in a year down here.So if you have good luck in Mn. so be it have fun but were heading for Lac Seul.Since this will be my 4th yr. there not calling me rookie any more.My partner and I found the mother load one morning and boy did we have some fun pulling in one after another.Dont forget catch and release let someone else have a chance to catch there dream BIG EYES.
527360,Guest,2003-02-05 21:16:00,0,"I agree with most of the nfo that has been passed on. However, the guy that said fising Mille Lacs is the same as LS is really ""out to lunch."" I am sure he catches fish in Mn. but I ave lost track of all the folks from Mn. that frequest the lodges at LS. They don't come up because of the scenery. They come up for the fish.LS is a great place to catch fish and the fellow that said 25-50 is reasonable is about right. Often you catch many more but that is no the rule. We have fished the area for 20 years and have a good feel for what is avalable. You can get pricing at just about any level as there are dozens and dozens of resorts as LS is HUGE with may drive in places.If your interested in discussing specifics let me know at[email protected]"
527364,Jigger1,2003-02-06 07:47:00,234,"2003 will be my fourth year of fishing Lac Seul. Last year we had a group of six and here is how our catch (over the 18"" slot) broke out during 4.5 days of fishing. 50 - slot 18"" walleyes47 - 19""36 - 20""44 - 21""41 - 22""34 - 23""46 - 24""48 - 25""27 - 26""15 - 27""13 - 28"" 4 - 29"" 1 - 30+This averages out to about 15 over the slot/person/day, 1.2 walleyes over 27""/person/day. We easily catch another 20-30 under 18""/person/day.Keep in mind we spend the majority of time hunting hogs.I've been on spots where almost as soon as the jig hits the water you have a hit, the only problem is the vast majority of these fish are less than 18 inches.Jigger1"
527365,Guest,2003-02-06 09:33:00,0,"I'm impressed. What is it that makes Lac Seul such a great eye lake? Is it the regs? What are the slot limits? Is it good forage? Or does it get less pressure than other lakes, like LOTW?"
527366,Jigger1,2003-02-06 10:10:00,234,"Read ""The Lac Seul Difference"" published by Mike Willems, owner of Silver Water Wheel Lodge, on his website at http://www.sww-lodge.com/articles.htm. This should give you a pretty good idea as to why Lac Seul is the special place it is. Additionally Mike takes the regs up a notch and enforces a strict conservation policy dictating no walleyes above the slot are allowed to be harvested. For all walleyes over 18"" it's a 100% catch and release lodge.We just keep the camera ready and take lots of pictures. It's sad to say, but I've stopped taking pictures of walleye's under 27 inches. How spoiled is that?Jigger1"
527361,Noel,2003-02-06 12:13:00,115,"Jimmy, you should be more informed before you call me ""out to lunch"" How many times have you fished Mille Lacs in the last three years? Yea, that's what I thought. Zippo. So check around a little before you make such silly statements. Mille Lacs is every bit as good as a trip to Lac Suel. Try it sometime. You'll change your opinion."
527362,Mike KS,2003-02-06 12:46:00,18,"Noel, I have fished Mille Lac many times since 1965 and have fished Lac Seul since 1984. I dont consider myself a expert on either Lake but I do believe that Lac Seul is a better Walleye fishery. There are times on Mille Lac that the fishing is great but day in and day out Lac seul will win the fishing contest for numbers and size. Dont get me wrong I love them both but I would Marry Lac Seul if she was a woman."
527367,red2,2003-02-06 21:45:00,16,Where else would you vetran Lac-Seul anglers suggest to stay no L.S.? I prefur to stay at a good clean house keeping camp. Any suggestions??? Thanks Tim
527368,Guest,2003-02-06 22:41:00,0,"If you want to go to the Ear Falls area I'll give you 4 G's: Golden Eagle (I stay there), Golden Fawn, Gold Pines, and Goose Bay. All are within 5-6 miles of Ear Falls. There are more but those will give you a start. You can go to www.ontariossunsetcountry.ca and you will find their phone numbers."
527363,Guest,2003-02-07 00:26:00,0,"Noel, don't want to get into a pissing contest hear. But just objectively read the posts on this site and on this question. Glad you do well at ML (and yes I have fished there) but there really isn't a comparison in numbers or size.If you want to insist that they are the same and no reason to go way up there then thats fine. But, honestly, you are not thinking straight on this one"
527369,Guest,2003-02-07 02:06:00,0,"I have been to both areas. LS is good & Minaki is that much more. I found that improving one's techniques thru experience etc that Minaki is much better. The numbers are always inflated by people who want to say that where they spend their cash is better. I assume that this is done so they can justify the expense. My honest opinion, BOTH areas are good to visit & sometimes you need to visit the ""other"" area to see how good it was where you were or to see what you have been missing. To say that the pike size in Minaki has been getting smaller...... thats not true for us. In fact our largest pike to date has come from Minaki, not LS. We have used a guide in Minaki (rtmg) however we never used a guide (yet) on LS. It's real tough to find a reliable guide on LS. Maybe it's time you went to LS ? just to find out & make your own judgement. Please keep us posted on what you find out ! Dave"
527349,Guest,2003-02-05 14:27:00,0,"I have been fishing around the Minaki area for the last 15 years with great success but always wondered what I was missing by going to the same lake each year. We usually catch tons of walleye but always between 16-18 inches. I also noticed that the northern pike size has continued to decrease, year after year. My questions are: Can you really catch 100 walleyes a day per person? Do they average 2-3lbs? Do you catch at least (1) 5-6 lb walleye during the week?"
527350,Guest,2003-02-05 14:57:00,0,"My experience with Lac Suel is that the fish always seem to biting. 100 fish days occur 25% of the time, but the % could be higher if you just wanted to sit in one place and pound on them. The average size fish we catch is 15 to 18 inches 75%. 19 to 22 inches 20 % 22 - 25 inches 4% over 25 inches 1%. If four guys are fishing for 5 days in early June or mid September 4 to 8 fish will be 28 to 30 inches. TGG"
527351,Mike KS,2003-02-05 15:06:00,18,"I was once a Iowa Farm Boy when I was a pup so you can believe me when I say Lac Seul is AWESOME. We have fished Lac Seul for the last 15 years and our group has made many other trips to other locations all over Ontario and Manitoba during the same period . I have personally been fishing in Canada since I was 10 yrs old (1955) thats 48 yrs counting the upcoming season. I would rather fish Lac Seul than any other location. While 100 fish days are not the rule they are common. The last several years 20"" to 25"" are common. In fact last year we caught 80% or more of our fish in that range. We also had at least 40 fish in the 26"" to 29"" range and two over 30"". While Walleye fishing we caught some great Pike (10 to 15Lb) and many nice Smallmouth 17"" to 21""( 5 fisherman / 7 days).Lac Seul is also a very affordable lake to fish and the outfitters are very helpful in putting you on fish. I know that every fisherman has his favorite lake and will swear that his lake is the BEST. Lac Seul has brought many hours of fishing thrills to me my friends and my kids and grandkids and it will continue to for years.If you go to Lac Seul make sure your outfitter has maps for you if not get maps and a GPS and a Depth Finder is essential. I have fished it in June,July and August and always have caught lots of fish. You need to be aware of yearly patterns and what presentations work best . Im sure that the gang on Walleye Central can give you lots of good advice. If I can be of any further assistance just ask a question.Good Luck, Catch & Release....Mike"
527352,Guest,2003-02-05 15:23:00,0,"Mike, Where do you live in KS? How long a drive is it for you to Lac Seul?"
527356,2 DOGS,2003-02-05 15:29:00,361,"I think 100 fish a day would be an exceptional day, even on Lac Seul. Don't count on doing that every day, the good fisherman will catch plenty, but I think 25-50 is a more realistic figure. There are some people who couldn't catch'em in a bathtub. Don't get me wrong, it is a great fishery, and to me what makes it so great is the potential to catch that ""big one"" is very good. In addition to that there seems to be an abundance of the 20-26"" fish. Which I attribute to the slot that's been in place for some years now and some of the camp owners emphasizing the release of the big ones will only make the fishing better in years to come. In my own personal experience, it seems the size of the Northern on Lac Seul has gone down the past few years also, but now with a slot on them, perhaps that trend will be reversed. Another thing that would help is if people wouldn't take the smaller ones, simply so they can have that limit to take home.IMHO - Yes, it is that great. For the person going up there expecting to have fish jumping in the boat and for each person catching 100 fish a day, then I think they may not find it so great!"
527353,Mike KS,2003-02-05 15:38:00,18,"rockpt, I live in Olathe, KS a suburb of Kansas City (Southwest part of KC). It is just over 1000 miles to Lac Seul from my house. It takes me 16 to 18 hours counting stopping in Minneapolis picking up part of our group. I leave KC around 3:00 pm on Friday and get on the Lake around 8 to 9:00 am on Saturday."
527354,Guest,2003-02-05 15:44:00,0,"Mike, We're practically neighbors. I'm in Brookside. Email me at [email protected] if you want to discuus further."
527357,Vitreum,2003-02-05 16:52:00,221,"the great guide is pretty close to the truth. check out this site. this guy keeps very accurate stats and you can do the math as to numbes of big fish and guided days, etc. it is a wonderful fishery. http://www.sww-lodge.com/fish.htm"
527358,Noel,2003-02-05 17:41:00,115,You don't need to go to Lac Suel to have tremendous big walley fishing. Go to Mille Lacs in Minnesota. I gave up going to Canada since I can get just as good fishing at Mille lacs in spring. It's cheaper and closer.
527359,Guest,2003-02-05 19:35:00,0,"Our experience has been that we have caught many more walleyes on Lac Seul than at Minaki, but we have caught our largest walleyes at Minaki."
