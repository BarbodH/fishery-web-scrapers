526775,Dave,2003-01-22 15:24:00,258,"Jeff,I have fished Chimo's Roderick in June, Hornby and Warwick (Bearberry) camps in Sept. Walleye fishing at Hornby and BB can be good to great. I believe Culverson is pretty close to Hornby? Cabins, boats & motors always reliable. Wish I could be of more help.Dave"
526776,Guest,2003-01-23 10:17:00,0,Thanks Dave. What did you think of the folks running the show? Did you think it was a good operation?
526777,Guest,2003-01-23 12:59:00,0,"while on the subject of chimo lodge, considering going to their ""My Lake"" outpost with my father in july. Can anyone tell me aything about it, fishing, cabin, etc."
526780,Dave,2003-01-24 06:52:00,258,"Jeff:Yes, I think Peter and his family run a good operation. Our group of 5-8 has made annual trips with Chimo since 1995 and are scheduled to return to Bearberry this September. Over the years we have learned to roll with a few bumps in the road and Peter has responded. What time of year are you looking at for Culverson?Dave"
526781,Guest,2003-01-27 13:44:00,0,Thanks Dave.We'll be at Chimo in late July. My first time with them. Previous years I've pulled a boat up to a drive in camp near Kenora - but since I moved from Iowa to Ohio it's just too long of a drive (2400 miles round trip last year pulling a 20ft deep V).I'm flying to Red Lake - only need to drive the 30 miles to the airport.
526782,Guest,2003-01-27 14:07:00,0,I went to chimo's camp at keeper lake last year and we had a ball. We caught walleyes until we were tired of it. It seemed like we caught fish everywhere we stopped. The cabin was nice. It was older but functional. It was an eight man cabin and we had nine so it was crowded. Next year we are going to Bearberry in september with ten guys. I hope the fishing is as good as keeper.Peter is a good guy and they have a good operation very accomodating.If you have any other questions sent a message.
526778,Michigander,2003-02-08 13:57:00,33,"We went to My Lake several years ago.....about 1997, as I recall. Fishing was very good, cabin was more than adequate. Peter has probably made some improvements since then. Not a tremendous amount of water to fish at this lake (we like to explore), but you'll certainly catch lots of walleyes in the 16-20"" range, some bigger. We were there in mid-June, and the walleyes were mostly shallow (less than 5' of water), apparently feeding on the mayflies that were hatching by the thousands (millions?). One evening, the hatch was so intense that the whole lake was alive with mayflies dancing above the surface of the water (and covering the ground everywhere!). I remember that we did very well with small jigs/Berkley power grubs (chartreuse/brown)....they must have looked like an emerging mayfly, because the 'eyes just killed them. I also remember catching several walleye over 20"" right off the dock there one evening! You'll enjoy it. Rob"
526779,Guest,2003-02-11 10:09:00,0,"Michigander, afew more questions if you don't mind. was there any northern fishing to speak of,is the lake mostly shallow or deep,alot of rock,any weeds,cabbage,grass etc.Did you try any of the portage lakes and how did you do on those. what do you mean by the cabin being adaqute could you be alittle more specific on the cabin. How were the boats and motors. anything else you tell me would be much appreciated, thanks"
