529432,Guest,2003-04-22 11:42:00,0,"Hi guys, What is or who is ? ?. I thought that was a symbol of unknown. Maybe that person is unsure of who he/she is. Oh well, that posting is unimportant. I see according to the weather network it is 52 degrees F. on Lac Seul today. I would imagine the ice is getting softer. Spring is on its way north and the countdown to the opener has started. Does anyone know the number of days to the opener? In Minnesota, it's May 10. What is the date of the opener in Ontario?"
529422,Guest,2003-04-14 20:31:00,0,"He probably wants you to break it in, make sure it works ok. Yes we will be there for opener, going up the 13th. Shoveling that snow? It doesn't take much effort to turn the key to start the snow blower. The nice thing about being retired is you can always recuperate later."
529423,Guest,2003-04-15 11:01:00,0,2 dogs: I understand you are quite the fisherman on LS. I saw a new lure on the market this winter that I think you would really enjoy. It was on a commercial comparing it to a Rapala. It worked real well up until it was time to get the fish away from it. There were a few snags at that point but I'm sure the experienced fisherman that you are with this type of animal you could figure it out. See ya soon.
529424,Guest,2003-04-16 06:48:00,0,"This guy with the rod and reel has to remember that there is a box of killer jigs with it too, as long as Mother didn't put them all on the Christmas tree. He also has to remember that I've got the lug wrench to a certain 5th-wheel."
529425,2 DOGS,2003-04-16 19:10:00,361,"I can't guarantee the infamous ""jig box"" is still full, you saw the tree. They hang better on the tree if you bend the hooks almost closed and those light wire hooks sometimes break when straightened. But that rod, what a convenient thing that is, ya know you can swat the cats from 6 feet away. Don't even have to sneak up on em. You may have to put some new round gold things on it, missed the cat a few times and hit the cement, but just a few times. Besides there are alot of people fishing with 5 foot rods.I'm thinking I'd better wait a few weeks so you fellas have a good head start, cause I've got all these secret fishing spots a fellow took me to last year and I can catch up real quick. While you have the trailer wheels off, would you be a buddy and grease the wheel bearings too."
529426,Guest,2003-04-19 07:05:00,0,"That fifth wheel might set a bit lopsided with no wheels, actually the weather is progressing well. Got your Easter message; did Mother pose for the picture? That's the big question around here!Hope to see you soon, easy on the cabin fever cure."
529427,Guest,2003-04-21 08:20:00,0,"Gary at Evergreen Lodge really knows his stuff. He is on the water a lot and is good at what he does. You can check with him, but don't know if he guides folks who are not staying at his place. You can view his web site at http://www.justfishontario.com/lac_seul.htm"
529428,Guest,2003-04-21 16:19:00,0,Nice post Gary
529429,Vitreum,2003-04-21 17:37:00,221,"?, actually i have found gary to be very meticulous in identifying himself when he posts. also, he's probably far too busy at his camp right now to be posting here in the middle of the day."
529430,Guest,2003-04-21 19:55:00,0,"Gary did not post, but thank you Willie whoever you are. I see that someone was upset and did not want to share who he was. Buck up"
529431,2 DOGS,2003-04-21 20:58:00,361,"I'm gonna jump in here also. For you ?, it just shows how little you know about the situation, or the extent of your petty jealousy. Gary certainly DOES NOT have to promote any guiding business. I know for a fact that he gets all the guiding he wants from his guests, sometimes far more than he can handle, he certainly isn't going to solicit anyone outside his camp. When you're running a successful camp, you really don't have alot of time to be guiding."
529412,Guest,2003-04-03 21:04:00,0,Hey is there any private guides that guide lac seul
529413,2 DOGS,2003-04-04 12:25:00,361,"Yes, but I don't think you could afford me. LOL I think you're going to the Ear Falls area so I'll give you a couple leads there. Doug Bannantine, you'd have to look up the phone #. Another guy who goes by the name of ""Fishy"", his first name is Mark and he runs a pontoon boat to guide big parties. You will see his flyers hung up in the business places around town. The resort you're staying at can probably hook you up with somebody also."
529414,Guest,2003-04-05 11:34:00,0,"IA Guy,Which part of Lac Seul???"
529415,Guest,2003-04-06 16:04:00,0,Ear falls area
529416,2 DOGS,2003-04-06 16:27:00,361,"One other person that is a must on your guide list is Paddy Anderson, an older gentleman that probably knows Lac Seul better than anyone. He lives in Ear Falls."
529417,Guest,2003-04-07 09:10:00,0,Do you know how i can contact him?
529418,2 DOGS,2003-04-07 10:30:00,361,"The resort you're staying at would probably know how to contact him, or you might try the 4 Seasons Tackle Shop in Ear Falls. When all else fails you might try information. I would love to have the knowledge of Lac Seul that he does."
529419,Guest,2003-04-12 21:11:00,0,"Just an opinion but fishng is so good on Lac Suel you don,t need a guide. Last year was my first trip to Lac Suel and we hired a guide for a day. He was helpful but not needed."
529420,Guest,2003-04-14 11:37:00,0,2 DOGSHow's that fever? You know the longer you put it off the worse it gets. It's time to start packing.
529421,2 DOGS,2003-04-14 15:24:00,361,"I've still got sore arms from shoveling all that snow, don't want to reinjure them pulling in all those big walleyes. Haven't figured out a way to collect some disability for either one! That's one of the few negatives of being retired. I suppose you'll be there for opener? I've been spiking a temp a little more frequently, but the fever is still under control. Somebody left a brand new baitcasting outfit at my house this winter, I figure the rental fee is going to more than cover the cost of a new one. Pretty darn nice of the guy, wouldn't you say?"
