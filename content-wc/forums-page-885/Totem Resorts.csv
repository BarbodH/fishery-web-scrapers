I have been going up to LOTW for many years now and I think that Totem and its Armada of unskilled guides are a detriment to the fishery. I have heard many stories from local guides of Totem scouts calling three or four guide boats onto another Resorts fishing spot, which is completely unethical. Yes, the resort has nice cabins and excellent amenities but I think the place is a cancer. But that's just me."

529765,FOOTDOC,2003-04-12 19:02:00,139,"My friends and I are thinking of coming up to fish around the 4th of July. We are debating over yellowbird, wiley or totem. If anyone has any experience with any of these lodges, please share your information with me. Thanks in advance."
529766,Guest,2003-04-12 21:36:00,0,"This will be our third year at Totem, and it is great. Yellowbird is a chalet type resort with 4 cabins. Totem is all excellent cabins. Wiley is in the wilderness and you need to travel by boat to get their. If you have at least 3 fisherman going, try to get the Wilmarth cabin at Totem!! We will be up their May 18. We usually go in July or August, you will have a great time. Byron in a great guide, if you can get him. Let me know if you need more info."

The guide involved in the operation had already been convicted and sentenced.On May 16, Brown was fined $5,000 and Totem Lodge was fined $10,000 for having 49 walleye over the limit at the lodge and at Brown's residence in June 1998. The convictions and sentencing end an undercover operation conducted by the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) on Lake of the Woods in 1998.Justice of the Peace Gordon Buterin took into account the amount of walleye, the commercial connection of the offence and the need for deterrence in arriving at the sentences.The public is asked to protect its natural resources by reporting violations to any MNR office or by calling Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477).www.ocoa.ca"
529769,River_eye,2003-04-19 13:20:00,1486,There is absolutely no need for nonsense like this from an operation that depends on the fishery.
529770,Guest,2003-04-19 13:35:00,0,"Agree 100%....he should have to forfeit his lodge and all property, have his fishing license revoked and face some serious jail time."
529771,Guest,2003-04-20 06:38:00,0,"Conroy,Thanks for the heads-up on these violators. How irresponsible!"
529772,alan ex pup,2003-04-20 06:46:00,126,Are these three places owned by the same people?
529773,Guest,2003-04-20 09:14:00,0,Yes they are. This is my third year going to Totem. I have never seen any illegal actions yet from the guides or the owner.
529774,Guest,2003-04-20 11:51:00,0,"You'd hope you wouldn't see any questionable activity the last 3 years, since this happened 5 years ago. Perhaps lesson learned."
529775,Guest,2003-04-21 08:12:00,0,"The lodge has probably learned their lesson and is towing the mark.At least I would hope so. It sets such a bad example for the young people who are joining the sport. You know here, it is not just the operator of the lodge and his employees but the guests who are really the ones participating the action. So many guilty parties went away unchecked. A lodge owner would not violate unless his guests pushed for it. Would he????? I am sure the MNR is watching these folks like hawks and probably has an undercover or two working for them. Totem is most guilty of willing to do anything for the almighty dollar."
