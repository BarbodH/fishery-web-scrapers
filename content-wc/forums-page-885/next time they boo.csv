529175,bigfish1965,2003-04-20 18:34:00,3210,It has happened before. Really we don't pay any attention to it. We just think they're not really booing but ordering a fine beer ( Labbatts) Blllluuuuueeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee. :)
529161,Guest,2003-04-01 02:39:00,0,I've heard that never really happen
529166,alan ex pup,2003-04-01 09:07:00,126,yes you are right canada here we come
529167,Guest,2003-04-01 12:49:00,0,"See I told you it wasn't going to happen, even cheered during God Bless America and it was 8-0 for the those dammn YANKEES. Now it will be interesting what happens at the New Jersey Devil game tonight when they play the Canadian National anthem."
529168,Guest,2003-04-01 14:00:00,0,"Well, the Islander fans booed the Canadian anthem when Montreal was in New York last spring.Besides Canada lies west of Montreal which is the capitol of New France.Don't be mad at the Canadians, they don't like Montreal any better than the Islander fans do."
529169,Guest,2003-04-02 11:04:00,0,"I've had it with the whiners. Talk about making mountains out of molehills. So they booed the anthem...who cares. It makes me laugh when Americans get upset over the same stuff that they do to Canadians all the time.As was said in previous posts...Canada's anthem gets booed regularly at American arenas and stadiums...Canada's flag gets hung upside down at a World Series game...The US women's hockey team stomps on the Canadian flag in their locker room etc... So why is it then that Canadians turn the other cheek and Americans get angry??I'll tell you why...because Canadians don't judge an entire nation based on the actions of a few idiots that boo at a hockey game or some uneducated military person who doesn't know the difference between rightside up and upside down or because a bunch of dykes on skates decide to stomp on Canada's flag. There are 25O million Americans and the actions of a few fools doesn't effect the way we feel about you guys...we like you...believe it or not. Remember my American cousins, just cause a few eggheads boo God Bless America, it doesn't mean that all 35 million of us feel the same way as a scant few do."
529170,Codydawg,2003-04-02 11:26:00,14,"Whoever said ""when they start to boo when I am catching a walleye, I will pay attention"" had it right. Or I guess if there is an overwhelming majority, which obviously there is not. If we boycotted everyone who ever offended us, we would never venture out of the house. To those Canadians who have shown their support for us-- Thank you."
529171,Guest,2003-04-02 13:18:00,0,"My point, exactly. I am in agreement!"
529172,alan ex pup,2003-04-03 09:56:00,126,nevermind
529173,Guest,2003-04-20 08:47:00,0,funny no one noticed the booing of the Canadian anthem last night in Philly . You are what's known as a hypocrite.Apology in order .
529174,Vitreum,2003-04-20 17:30:00,221,"if that in fact happened, you have my humble apology. don't watch hockey, but philly has some of the trashiest football fans in the states. anyone who boos another's national anthem is human debris, north or south of the border."
529155,alan ex pup,2003-03-31 12:59:00,126,We have been going to canada for the last 30 years once or twice a year. My wife is so pissed that the canadians bood at the last hocky game that if the they boo again at the toronto opener then thats it for canada. They better get their act straight. Any resort owners feeling the heat yet from this fall out? We would just have to loose our deposit but so be it.
529156,Guest,2003-03-31 13:20:00,0,Not going to happen; even singing God Bless America 7th inning stretch. Believe me not all Canadian's are like what you heard in Montreal.
529157,Guest,2003-03-31 13:22:00,0,Easy Alan....its just a Hockey Game.....Walleye Fishing is life. Now if they start Booing when you catch a Walleye....well thats different.
529158,Pike Man,2003-03-31 14:24:00,0,"If you watched the Washington/Leafs Game on Saturday, the fans cheered very wildly for the US Anthem. Don't let a couple of drunk yahoos in Montreal ruin your holidays.Tight LinesPike Man"
529159,Soolkyut,2003-03-31 14:34:00,60,"ofcourse,that kind of stuff never gets news play, how about when Americans boo the canadian anthem (which happens just as much). Or how about the time they raised the flag upside down at a baseball game. Anthems should be banned from sporting events period"
529160,Northern Manitoban,2003-03-31 14:46:00,195,Or how about at the olympics the American womens hockey team had the Canadian flag in the dressing room on the floor.Even though i'm a big Montreal Canadiens fan don't let a bunch of dumbass frenchmen booing the anthem bother you.I think theres more things in this world to worry about.Just shut up and fish!
529162,Guest,2003-03-31 14:52:00,0,I've been living in Canada for two years now and I still can't figure out who's the quarterback in one of those hockey games and where's the cheerleaders anyhow. Now curling there's a sport!
529164,dutchboy,2003-03-31 15:14:00,5717,Bad manners and stupidity have no boundries!I'm a proud American who has been embarrassed more than once by American behavior.Always in these matters consider the source before condeeming a broad section of people.:) dutchboy
529163,Guest,2003-03-31 20:29:00,0,Now here's a guy I can fish with. Can't wait to see that Ferbie guy do it again. It only takes a couple days in Manitoba or Ontario to realize what Canadians are really made of. O Canada we'll be back in June!!!
529165,North Of 55,2003-03-31 20:49:00,0,I think what it all comes down is that there are always those few that make a bad name for the many!My belief:PISS ON EM !
