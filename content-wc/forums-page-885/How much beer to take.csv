529229,Guest,2003-04-19 17:06:00,0,"Suggestion.. Why don,t most of you guys stay home and drink.It would be alot cheaper and you could drink even more."
529239,Reels,2003-04-19 19:55:00,2876,What to do with all those emptys though??<{{}}><
529238,Guest,2003-04-19 20:50:00,0,We sink the bottles so that next year we have new structure to fish
529230,Guest,2003-04-19 20:51:00,0,Why do you care what we do?
529231,Ivy,2003-04-21 11:41:00,556,"Dear Da, Da, ( If that's your real name! )Ummmm cause I would rather come to Canada and make a pest out of my-self.See ya soon.Ivy"
529232,Guest,2003-04-21 22:00:00,0,"Ok, I can live with that"
529240,Guest,2003-04-22 08:31:00,0,Bring whatever it takes to not feel any black-flys or mosqitoe bites!!!!!!
529241,bucktail,2003-04-22 12:40:00,3,Me and my group take 1 case per guy for the drinkers and 1/2 case for the social drinkers plus 2 large jacks daniels and 1 large baileys. Works out to 18 cases of beer for a group of 4.You do the math. drinkers3 beers before lunch.3 beer at lunch.1 beer just before the nap.6 beers on the lake before dinner.2 beer while cleaning fish or preparing dinner.4 beers with dinner.3 beers on the lake after dinner.2 beers around the campfire after evening fishing.social drinkers1/2 of above.
529242,Guest,2003-04-22 14:56:00,0,Sounds about right. We always throw in a gallon of wine as well. A glass of wine with a good dinner is perfect.
529223,Guest,2003-04-01 20:12:00,0,"24 beers in a case 24 hours n a day, wierd huh i would bring a case a day"
529225,Guest,2003-04-01 20:59:00,0,What about the case of beer for the camp owner so he puts you on the good!!fishing spot.PS remember guys I drink Kokanee
529226,Guest,2003-04-01 22:13:00,0,"A general idea:6 guys7 days(not counting the first night at the Alluett in The Pas)26 cases Blue and Blue light9 Gibson's 1.75The Creighton liquor store loved us.Oh, and that doesn't count the 4 cases and 2 bottles we brought accross the border.Best ##### trip in 8 years. And the fishing was great too."
529227,Guest,2003-04-02 08:09:00,0,I think that you can only bring across 1 case of beer or 1 bottle of booze. 1 carton of cigs... Probably best to just buy it in Canada. check out this Customs site to make sure. You don't want them taking away your supply!!! It's probably a good idea to check into this site anyway just to make sure we are up to snuff on the latest reg.'shttp://www.ccra-adrc.gc.ca/customs/i...isitors-e.htmlCan't wait to go fishing!
529228,Guest,2003-04-02 10:40:00,0,"The amount would depend on the age too...younger guys you need more.We have a group of 6 guys...5 between 33-40; 1 over 60. We takea case and a half to two cases per guy for a Sat-Wed....plus a coupleof us bring vodka for tonics when we come off the lake. Usually runs pretty close....and now that you can't have any in the boat...itactually is less.I figure 3 or 4 at lunch, 3 or 4 later....plus a couple of tonics."
529233,Ivy,2003-04-02 13:18:00,556,Drunk guy talking Scene 1 Act II:Firsht of all I wantsh shto know whatsh you people are doing my boat?Getsh the Heck outof thers. I'm trying to talk tooth the boysh on W.C..The rule of thumb is. You're gonna run out. Don't take any chances. Tis better to have it and need it than need it and not have it.And one other thing. You can't drink in the boat umless you buy a Beer in the boat badge. Ivy
529217,alan ex pup,2003-04-03 10:55:00,126,"been going up there amny years and many times have seen the DNRgoing from boat to boat and watched as liquid was being poured into the lake, this went on for over an hour. But the dummies with the beer never got the idea to leave before it was their turn. hahaha. Dont know if they also got a fine or not but up there drinking in a boat is the same as driving and drinking big big wampum. How lucky do you feel?"
529218,Ivy,2003-04-03 12:11:00,556,"I will feel heep big lucky. But I have a few tips for the rest of you guys who don't feel so lucky. So, if you are like Ivy and decide to enjoy a few beers out on the lake, please remember the following if you get "" pulled over ""1. Immediately get defensive. Say something like: "" Who the Heck are you? I didn't give you permission to board my boat! Cabin Boy, Mr. Christian bring this man to the brig""2. If the M.P. still does not get the hint that he should leave, say something like "" I'm gonna count to 5. And if you are not out of here.....""Or you could try the nice guy aproach: 3. Ahoy there Admiral. Can I get ya a cold one?4. Since I'm paying your salary, I'm officially giving you permission to join me for a brew. Or maybe some confusion5. Say.... you look exactly like the guy I used to beat up in Gym class back in Jr. High. 6. I'm willing to open a line of negotiation here. O.K. you go first. I'll counter. You counter back. Then you let me go.Or just be bold7. I know you guys don't make a lot of money, so let's pretend that Mr. Lincoln just happened to float into your boat. Nuff said???8. I got some American money here Patton. I betchya never see this kind of scratch way up here do ya?9. Tell ya what, if you forget about this whole Beer situation, I would be willing to do some undercover work. I know for a fact that the guys across the lake are WAY over their limit.Ivy"
529234,Guest,2003-04-04 16:32:00,0,TTT
529235,Guest,2003-04-05 10:08:00,0,To me this is a ridiculous question. Only you know how much you can drink in a week. If your name is Foster Brooks you might need 3 cases per day but if you are only a social drinker you might need only 1/2 a case per day. Only you know the answers to these questions. Good luck.
529212,Guest,2003-04-01 12:17:00,0,"None, if you can't enjoy the fishing in Canada without getting plastered then perhaps it is time to check out the AA meetings. This is the voice of experince talkig."
529213,Guest,2003-04-01 13:31:00,0,Who said anything about getting plastered?
529214,Vitreum,2003-04-01 14:18:00,221,"i actually drink less beer in canada than i would on a weekend day at home. after fishing 10 hours per day, it doesn't take many and i'm ready for nighty night."
529215,Guest,2003-04-01 16:03:00,0,"Rusty,Take as much as you can fit into your vehicle. I'd say about 20 cases should cover the week, but you should also make sure that you bring a few extra bottles of rye as well and maybe a couple of bottles of gin and don't forget a bottle or two of the vodka and rum. Have fun."
529219,Guest,2003-04-01 16:09:00,0,Depends on the weather. Beer moves quick in the summer. 12 per day is for light drinkers. A case per day for heavy drinkers. Split the difference. Throw in a 40 or two in non breakable bottles of hard stuff. Bring lots of ice.
529220,Guest,2003-04-01 19:38:00,0,"RUSTY...I changed my mind...just go to the local tavern and drink steadily. This will put in the ""FISHZONE"" you can tell fishing lies about Canada and drinking for a week at the bar will be cheaper than Canada."
529221,Guest,2003-04-01 19:45:00,0,"By your beer up here. Higher alcohol content, hence a concentrated formula, means less cans.Here I can't be wrong.....look at our Prime Minister, I'd swear he's drunk most of the time :)"
529216,Guest,2003-04-01 19:48:00,0,AA is for quitters and momma told me never to be a quitter!!
529222,Guest,2003-04-01 20:08:00,0,I would start off with 6 beers per day then 1/2 bottle of wiskey per day. Buy the canadian stuff its hard. You need to start off with the beer then the wiskey goes down with out troubles. Remeber not to wear too many layers on the bottom cuz peeing off the boat with waves is hard in 6 layers.
529224,CanEye,2003-04-01 20:12:00,11,Best to bring lots extra. You never know....you can always bring it back.
529202,Guest,2003-04-01 07:01:00,0,I am going to be fishing in Canada for the first time this year and would like to know how much beer I should take with me. We are at a place that makes it tough to drive back to town mid-week so running out is not adviseable. How much does one normally consume on a trip. I do understand that it is illeagle to posses beer in the boat so I do not need that issue covered. I am just trying to get all my ducks i a row before the trip
529203,Guest,2003-04-01 07:03:00,0,"I generally just take a case and drink all my buddies beer after the lable falls off in the cooler. So it depends on how much your group brings. The only bad part is in our group, they drink, Kokonee, Crystal, Labby, Blue light, OV and Molson, so I often have to weed out the bad stuff"
529204,Guest,2003-04-01 07:07:00,0,Dont waste your time taking beer....get a gallon of Royal Crown and a bottle of Excedrin....the fish will look BIGGER.
529205,Dave,2003-04-01 07:27:00,258,"Rusty:Depends on how early you open the cooler in the morning, warm weather, shore lunch and how late it stays light the time of year you are in Canada. 12 pack/day???"
529206,Guest,2003-04-01 07:38:00,0,"Well we will be there May 23-May 30. So the day should be long. I expect maybe start around lunch time, after a long night of eating fish, drinking beer and playing euchre,,, wont be getting up too early!I was thinking about 8-12 beers a day,,, does that seem excessive?"
529207,Guest,2003-04-01 08:10:00,0,"12 beers excessive?, thats just warming up! Not to go into too much detail but in our younger days we have averged 28 beers a day per man plus a few bottles of community wiskey, rum and vodka during the week. Yes we have had a few in the boats, just don't get too crasy. We only drink the Canadian beer. Seems to give you a better buzz."
529208,Guest,2003-04-01 08:38:00,0,"I go on a 5 day fly-in, I bring 3 cases and a bottle of whiskey seems to be just the right amount! If its freezing out the beer amount goes down and whiskey up if vice versa than vice versa. Good luck and be safe!!!!!!!"
529209,Jungle Jim,2003-04-01 09:45:00,50,The level of the lakes you are fishing must really rise with your group drinking so much beer. How do you find any time for fishing ?
529210,Guest,2003-04-01 10:55:00,0,"If there is one thing you can do and do well while fishing, its drinking! You can set that beer down and it will wait for you while you make a few casts. Then have another swig. Set it down, make a few casts have a few swigs, set it down make a few casts, finish the bottle, set the pole down, get a new beer then sit down to enjoy your beer while you take a break from fishing. Fishin is tough work!"
529211,Hammerhead Herb,2003-04-01 11:21:00,259,"You do the math.3 beers before lunch.1 beer at lunch.1 beer just before the nap.2 beers on the lake before dinner.1 beer while cleaning fish or preparing dinner.2 beers with dinner.3 beers on the lake after dinner.2 beers around the campfire after evening fishing.Assumptions:1. You don't start the beers until about 9:30 or 10:00 AM; if you start earlier, bring more beer.2. You take about a 1.5 hour nap; if you don't take a nap, bring more beer.3. You also have a little night cap of Jack Daniels and/or a shot of Bailey's in a cup of decaf coffee around the campfire. If you don't have the campfire nightcap, bring more beer."
