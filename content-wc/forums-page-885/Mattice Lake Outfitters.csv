529679,WillieB,2003-04-10 11:35:00,292,"Do a search using Mattice, go back 1 year and have it check the archived threads.Great folks Don and Annette, and a superb operation...same with the fishing.Don't hesitate booking with them."
529680,AL,2003-04-10 15:27:00,89,"Jigman,Wonderful outfiitter! What lake are you looking at and when? If you have specific questions you can email me at [email protected]. I'm going to Weese Lake opening week, fished the reservoir last year."
529681,Guest,2003-04-10 18:37:00,0,"I have been on 26 fly-in trips and the last 5 with Mattice Lake Outfitters. I cannot believe there could be a better outfitter to deal with than The Elliots. There planes are kept first rate, the cabins and boats and motors are first rate. In fact my wife and I believe Don lays awake at night trying to think of ways to make the cabins and facilities better. Ps. I didn't get paid to say this either."
529682,jigman 2003,2003-04-11 08:24:00,981,"I am fishing Pringle Lake the first week of July. It is the earliest I can break the ""rotation"" for a party of two. Any tips on colors, baits, etc.? Looking for info. on the type of walleye bite going by then, am thinking the crankbait bite might be the best bet?"
529683,Guest,2003-04-11 12:16:00,0,We will be at Ogoki Res. the first week of July and have for the past 3-4 years. Pearl white jigs and gold crank baits and plenty of ocilators and rifacators Ha HA {secrete bait}. We have done very well going that time of the year. Might try a single cabin lake next year just to do something different. Have fun and good luck!!!!
529684,Guest,2003-04-14 00:04:00,0,"We have been to Mojokit in July the last two years, and our group just keeps getting larger. We enjoy it so much that folks want to join us. Great lakes, fishing, cabins, planes, pilots, and service. We use a lot of chartreuse twister tails and lead heads for Walleyes, red DareDevls for their slimier cousins. We take along borax & salted minnows to tip the lead heads, they work great. I have always been surprised how few folks mention the Elliots in this forum, I figured that we were all trying to keep things quiet for ourselves. I'll see you on the dock on the 7th!"
529685,jigman 2003,2003-04-14 09:41:00,981,"IowaGuy, I would have liked to be able to meet you on the dock, but we are flying out on the 4th of July, and back in the 11th. Thanks to everyone for the info. Any other tips still appreciated!!!!!!!"
