529568,Guest,2003-04-18 08:45:00,0,"We camped at Separation campground and it is wonderful fishing, I believe John the Guide is running it now. We found the best Walleye fishing is: Take the left side of the rapids, when you leave the campground stay to your left down a little river and a small rapids, just in the current of these little rapids we caught one 31 incher after another, they were laying the the current. We had so much fun and caught so many fish there, we just kept going back and did not fish anyplace else. We could not get back up those small rapids for the rocks, we had to go around the main rapids and if you have never been thru there, have the camp owner or someone else that knows it show you for your first time. Lots of fish to be caught in that area of the English River, we did exceptionally well. Jim the owner of Separation Lake Lodge is in Illinois now. www.separationlake.com or call him at 217-357-3069. Oh, we just used a plain hook and a leech.Good Luckpikelady"
