529651,Guest,2003-04-24 08:52:00,0,"I have been to Canada--Ontario--some 150 times. The old days roads were a problem, even main highways. Thats pretty well changed. You only have to worry about the off highways roads to get into remote lakes. There you should have a 4 wheel drive. Sometimes its best to rent a boat the first time or in order to spare your own.Also, most of what you are told is true once in a while. You can catch lots of walleyes--after you been there and know the lake and if they are willing.And the resort owners talk about 4-5# walleyes. And lots of larger--forget it. You get smaller better eating walleyes and occasionally a large one. If you really like to fish pick out a good area and hire a guide to take you in. Someone who has been guiding some years. I like the Sturgeon Lake area; 40' north of Ignace. The lake is only really good for lakers. There are great other lakes you need a guide to find(ist time) and a 4 wheel drive and patience to get to. You spend a lot to get there, investment of the boat, lodge.\, tackle, license, the spend a little on a guide to make it all worth while for the whole party and get some fish."
529652,Guest,2003-04-24 09:16:00,0,NW Ontrio for sure. Lots of places to go up there. For the best weather I'd shoot for the last week in June to the first week in July.

529639,fish4food,2003-04-08 13:17:00,18,"I would like to pull my boat to Canada and fish! Where is a good place to go to get into awesome fishing? I would like to go in decent weather, when would that be? Is there anything that I should be aware of before i go to Canada?Thanks for pointing me in the right direction!Fish4Food"
529640,Guest,2003-04-08 13:22:00,0,"Give us a little more info, please. Canada is HUGE. Where are you located?What part of Canada are you close to?"
529641,fish4food,2003-04-08 13:40:00,18,Im coming from Indiana.
529642,Vitreum,2003-04-08 14:19:00,221,"i would suggest ear falls area of lac seul in northwest ontario. it's about 18 hours from central indiana. fishing is great. close to a little town with everything you need. lodges are reasonably priced. july and august usually have the most stable and predictable weather. i go with relatives from central illinois and we find it to be absolutely wonderful. i fish walleye and put up some serious numbers. if you want to fish pike, you can catch them almost constantly with no problem."
529645,PRD1,2003-04-08 14:51:00,458,"From Indiana you can head into NW Ontario for some fine fishing. Weather wise June through August are usually comfortable and sometimes downright hot. Late May and September are also very good and we have had great fishing in late May for all species. Muskie fishing opens mid June but I have had better luck later and through mid Ocotober when the weather gets a bit iffy. We had a bit of snow last October. There are so many good spots it is hard to point you to one spot. As the other post noted Lac Seul is a great fishery as is Lake of the Woods and the many waters in the English River system.There are lots of good web sites to help you decide:http://www.ontariossunsetcountry.ca/http://weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/http://www.canadamapsales.com/http://www.heartland.on.ca/http://www.justfishontario.com/http://toporama.ctis.nrcan.gc.ca/And of course Walleye Central.Good luck,Paul"
529643,JoeUpnorth,2003-04-09 07:20:00,17,"Fish4Food,I have a gift certificate to Little Canada Camp just outside of Ear Falls on the English River that I can't use. I would be willing to sell at a discount from it's face value of $300.00, ($270.00 if you are using your own boat). I got it through a local musky fishing club (Dave's Musky Club, Kaukauna WI). If you would like some more info, please feel free to e-mail me at [email protected]Here are some webssites to checkout for info on the lodge.http://www.justfishontario.com/disc65_toc.htmhttp://www.littlecanadacamp.com/Good luck finding a place.By the way, my family and I stay at Deer Trail Lodge on Eagle Lake every year and always have a great time catching walleye, pike, bass and musky. We go in July and the weather is usuallly very nice and the fishing is great. Richard and Ruth (the owners) are very friendly and will treat you well.[email protected]Joe"
529646,Guest,2003-04-09 08:44:00,0,Thanks for all the info everyone!This should help me get started.
529647,fishmaster,2003-04-09 16:58:00,209,"Looking for a nice place to go with the family try out Vermilion Bay lodge they are a very nice family run camp that will treat you well.You don't get all the hassles that you might get at some camps that have to many guest. Check out the web site at www.vermilionbaylodge.comI have been to other camps on Eagle Lake that are OK but he has all you need and all equipment is well kept.Good Luck.And a little note if you can live without taking your own boat give it some thought, the roads can be tough going into Canada."
529648,Karl,2003-04-10 20:13:00,63,Just an anecdote to the last post. I've been driving NW Ontario roads for over 10 years. There is no such thing as a modern paved road. The worst oldest least maintained road you where you live is twice as good as any highway you will drive on in NW Ontario. You learn to live with it.
