530200,Guest,2003-04-25 09:29:00,0,Going to Lake of the Woods July 11th. Never fished there in July before. Was always there in June. Has anyone had any experience fishing LOTW in July for walleyes. I normally target 10-12' reefs bordering deeper water and do well. Can I expect this to hold true in July with the warmer temps.

530202,Guest,2003-04-25 14:04:00,0,"MC- I think where you find the fish in July is going to depend on the weather pattern prior to your arrival. I was at LOTW (Little Traverse area) last July a couple weeks later than you're going, and there had been a 2 week period of stable warm weather with light winds. The walleyes were holding on rock reefs that topped out as shallow as 8'. Also, however we found nicer fish on deep reefs that topped out at 20' with 30' water surrounding. I think they will be where they are comfortable, and with light winds the water 8' down will be colder than you might think which will cause fish to locate there. If there's a lot of wind though, I think the warm surface water blows across those shallow reefs and warms the water at the reef above the walleye's comfort zone and they move deeper. I'd recommend paying attention to the weather prior to your arrival and while you're there and you'll find the fish. I will say that we've generally caught bigger fish in July on the deep reefs rather than the shallow reefs, and by pulling plugs rather than using live bait. Hope this helps.....good luck."
