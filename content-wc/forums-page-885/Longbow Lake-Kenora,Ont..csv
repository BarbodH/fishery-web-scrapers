529951,Stevie B,2003-04-21 05:34:00,157,I go there about 6-8 times per year. It's a really easy lake to fish. The walleye are like any other lake. The smallmouth fishing is great there too. Go early morning when the lake is glass and throw top water in the shallow bays. I find that Longbow is looked over in this area and seems to have less boat traffic. What weekend are you going to be there? Which camp are you going to be staying at?Fish ON!!
