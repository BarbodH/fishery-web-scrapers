530179,Guest,2003-04-24 06:41:00,0,Hi GuysWe are going to a lake near Kipawa - not sure of the name of it - two hours north east of Kipawa - I was wondering if the ice on the big lakes melt faster than the small lakes - or is it the other way around?Does it depend on how many tributaries there are leading into it?I have never been fishing in Canada - near seen frozen water...really looking forward to May.Thanks guysPaul
530180,PRD1,2003-04-24 08:25:00,458,Usually the smaller lakes go ice out earlier but the larger lakes which are part of a river system also preceed those large deep lakes with no major tributaries. I am in Minnesota and our ice is out up to the northern tier of counties (about the lower 2/3rds of the state is ice free). Probably the first week of May the way it looks for those on the border.Paul
