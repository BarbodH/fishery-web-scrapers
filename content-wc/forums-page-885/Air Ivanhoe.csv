529689,Guest,2003-04-11 21:14:00,0,Have been there about 7 years in a row and final taking a break. Very nice people and great value for the money. I have been to rice and rush. Both fly in lakes. Rice is more of a walleye lake now but you can still catch your share of pike. Rush is more pike with a few walleye. I have stayed at the main lodge and the house accross the street. Both nice places but the main lodge is really nice. Can't say enough about the folks that run it. You won't go wrong. Any other questions just ask. Always looked forward to going up there and getting away from the hustle and bustle.Good Luck!!Tim FRick

Fourarm is a small lake but tons of fun catching pike after pike. Great people (george and wife), and stayed in the cabins the night before we flew out. Good food as well if you are eating at the lodge. I would highly recomend it.Tight LinesPike Man"

The main lodge is also really nice though the fishing on Ivanhoe is so so compared to other lakes. I fished with them for the last 3 years - last week of June (major bug season)."
529692,Guest,2003-04-21 08:30:00,0,"Thanks for the posts,We went there in September 2001, the week of the attacks. George flew in on Tuesday to let us know about the terror attacks. He told us that he would be grounded until the end of the week. He did drop off a few cases of beer.We had a good time at Rush, we caught a lot of Pike, mostly in the 25 to 35 inch range. We were looking for real big pike.What other lodeges have you been to?We are planning on going back next year, but have not made up our mind on where to go. I would like a lake with good pike fishing with the chance for a 40 plus incher. We would also like to catch a few walleyes for shore lunch.ThanksJay"
