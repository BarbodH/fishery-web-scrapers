529934,Guest,2003-04-18 21:21:00,0,"I use alot of #5 or #6 mepps, all colors. The time of year your talking about, pike like weeds wether shallow or deep. But don't make the mistake of using weeds in bays go out to the main lake and look for weed bed beside islands or offshore. On shallow weeds, burn the mepps. On deeper weeds, let mepps hit bottom and slowly reel back to you."
529935,Guest,2003-04-21 10:49:00,0,"Have been fishing Rainy the last 4 years. Agree with Harvey on using Mepps. Last year we killed Smallies using Mepps (gold blade & rust brown buck tail). Also caught Pike up to 45"" on the Mepps. If you find tannic colored water try a gold w/black back stick bait, i.e. Rapala. One year, Fire Tiger stick bait killed Pike also. This year we will be back at the Fisheries (third year in a row). Great Northern, Walleye and Smallmouth fishing last year (water was really high). Good Fishing,Pathfinder"
