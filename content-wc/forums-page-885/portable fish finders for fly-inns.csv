530078,Steve,2003-04-26 09:45:00,259,"I took an old small tackle box and a $99.00 fishfinder gutted the box(one tray) and set the unit lid while using it. The 2 6 volt lantern barttries last all week. I run the transducer with a homemade clamp(C clamp) and rod to the C clamp plastic wire ties tie the transducer to the rod . When done I close the box and ready for the trip home, foam is also added to the box to keep everthing from bouncing around. This unit maybe weights 5 pounds. Don't leave home with out it."
530068,Newby,2003-04-23 10:50:00,148,Why dont you like the potrables with the suction cup? I have been using an eagle for a couple of years now and havent had any problems. I definatley wouldnt go without one now.They are great to have along. I dont have any experience with the ones you are talking about.take care.
530069,Guest,2003-04-23 11:28:00,0,"I would echo the comments about the portables with the suction cup. Mine works great on fly-in trips and lasts all week with the two 6 volt batteries through alot of use. The only thing I would add is that the lakes I have been on in NW Ontario have some sizeable rock outcroppings just under the surface, some are marked and some are not. You may end up hitting one and with the fish finder that projects down into the water it could be torn apart. May be something to think about."
530070,Guest,2003-04-23 11:36:00,0,"I use a hummingbird 200SX suction cup and love it. I like that it is easy to pack, you don't have something that is 3 feet long. Just have to remember to pull the transducer if you are going to shoot across Lac Seul so suction doesn't come loose and cost you $50 in a new transducer. I wouldn't be without it cause you read the drop offs on points and structure so much better, especially when you are just learning the lake. Good luck"
530071,Thumper,2003-04-23 11:40:00,133,"Hi, GregI had 3 of the Bottom Line Fishin' Buddies. They work OK, but...1.) My first 2 units had problems with them and had to be returned.2.) They're limited in placement.3.) You have to remove them from the water prior to moving over 3 mph4.) They're extremely low power - 35 watts, I believe5.) They frequently return false fish indicators6.) In deep, hard surfaces (50+ft) they'll return false bottoms and get ""confused""7.) the head angle is fixed at an angle where the screen is frequently obscured with glare8.) Sometimes, especially when the batteries are under half power, they just plain get ""confused""9.) you're limited to C-cell batteries, can't use 12-volts10.) because of their size, they can be a hassle to transport/carry11.) only has ""fish-icon"" mode, no ""curve"" displayOne thing I really did like about them is the side finder. It's helped me, a couple times, catch bass and northern while along shorelinesI picked up a Eagle FishEasy 2 Portable late last summer and I much prefer it. The cost was a little less, it's much higher powered, transports very easily, can be positioned much better, can be used at speed, uses D-cell or 12-volt power, and is a lot smarter/dumber - whichever you prefer.If you go with the Eagle portable, I'd opt for the hard case over the soft case, easier to adjust/position.Hope this helps!- Rick"
530072,Guest,2003-04-23 11:55:00,0,"Have used the same Eagle portable for about 10 years. Rather than the suction cup, you want to buy the clamp that fits on the back of any boat that uses an outboard. The transducer attaches to a bracket on the clamp and rides about level with the bottom of the boat. Impossible to hit a rock and rip off the transducer with taking out your entire lower unit. Best of all, it's more secure than a suction cup. I keep mine in the water when running at full speed. I think a company called Tight-Lok (or something like that) makes the clamp, and it works great with my Eagle model, and I think other makes too. I store the unit with the clamp. In fact, have not removed the transducer from the clamp in years."
530073,GregN,2003-04-23 16:21:00,2,"Guys, thanks for all the great feedback, this is exactly the kind of information I was looking for. Knowing all of the pros and cons will at least help me make an educated decision. At first, I was really leaning toward the fishin buddy as I liked the idea of not having to run wires to a transducer, which I thought would be nice feature for use on my canoe.But, I really don't like the idea of NOT being able to use the fishin buddy when your cruising along trying to locate structure.I plan on looking into the Eagle Fish Easy series.Thanks again,Greg"
530074,River_eye,2003-04-23 16:40:00,1486,"I own an Eagle portable, but I have experience with the fishin buddies as well. They are convenient, and a good fishfinder, but not being able to see the depth while travelling is a huge setback. You should not mind the extra minute that it takes to uncoil the transducer and stick it on the back of the boat with the regular kind. You won't have to touch it for the rest of the week, whereas you will have to be handling your fishin buddy every single time you move to a new spot."
530075,PRD1,2003-04-24 08:35:00,458,I have used a rig which worked well but is a bit heavier. I just use my normal boat depth finder with a marine box (one of those orange boxes for $10). Mounted a Johnny Ray mount on the top of the box for the depth finder and put a small wet cell (lawn tractor battery) in the box and a transducer mounted on one of the aluminum rod style brackets which clamps on the transom (suction type works also). Some of these batteries have a Reserve Capacity of 34A so will run a depth finder for 60 to 70 hours.Paul
530076,Guest,2003-04-24 09:10:00,0,I bought a Clearwater Classic portable unit for ice fishing. As it turns out for an extra $50.00 I got a fast moving transducer that makes it perfect for fly-ins also. For $10.00 you can get a transducer holder that clamps to the stern of your boat and it just tips up and down.
530077,Bobby,2003-04-24 13:03:00,211,"GregN,Check out the new Eagle Fishmark 320 at Cabelas. It comes in a small portable softside carry case with hard base and has a built in rechargeable battery. You get the case, the rechargeable battery, suction cup transducer with temperature readings, and a sonar with a 320 X 320 screen for a mere $249. This is a package put together by Cabelas and the case/base looks like it is really good quality. (Another bonus about this item is you can also transfer it to your bow of your own boat and plug it into your MinnKota Universal Sonar bowmount motor.)Here's a link to a picture, hope it works:http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/te...Fitem-link.jht"
530058,GregN,2003-04-22 16:21:00,2,"I'll be doing my first fly-inn this summer to Northwestern Ontario and I am considering purchasing the Bottomline Fishin Buddy portable fish finder. I like the idea of it being ""one unit"" with the transducer built in as opposed to other portable units that require running a wire to a suction cup mounted transducer. Does anyone have any experience with these units? How do they work?Thanks,Greg"
530059,Guest,2003-04-22 16:54:00,0,I have owned one for about 5 years now . I use it in my belly boat. they work great! If your using it in a boat remember to pull it out of the water before you take off at any great speed or you will loose your unit or damage it. If you're going for a long period of time take extra batteries.Try your unit out before you leave. The 1st one I bought was faulty and I did't find out till I was on the water! Other than that it has served me well. It's starting to warm up here finaly and the lakes are starting to clear.It has been a very dry spring . Hope you have a good time up here.
530060,Vitreum,2003-04-22 17:15:00,221,"i used one last year on lac seul and it served me well. have used it all this spring for crappie fishing. works fine. it does get confused about deep bottom weedbeds, thinks they are fish. i've had lots of fish finders in my day and i would rate this one ok. it should serve your needs. batteries last a long time. supposedly 40 hours if not using the lighted screen. i have the cheapie; 1200 i think."
530061,Guest,2003-04-22 19:42:00,0,Been using a cheap bottomline for my flyin for 4 years. Does a good job of finding the bottom and reading general fish schools. It is a great light weight inexpensive tool. I wouldn't say it compares to some of the $1000+ units but it works very well on flyins. I fish 12 hours or so a day and start with a fresh set of batteries and change mid week. By the end of the week I am ready to change again. Figure 25-35 hours per battery set.Bob
530062,Guest,2003-04-23 07:21:00,0,"A thought on batteries...I went to the Interstate Battery store and bought a rechargeable 12v battery for my finder before I flew out. This will last all week and then some on my Garmin 100, and it powers my GPS with a power splitter. Look at your finder instructions, most of the finders are designed to take either kind of battery, one big one or a lot of little ones."
530063,TEK,2003-04-23 08:17:00,23,I have an old Green Box that I got many years ago. Still works fine and got the job done. I also took a hand held GPS that worked out well.
530064,Guest,2003-04-23 09:09:00,0,"I flew in to a lodge 7 years ago with a bottom line fishin' buddy. The lodge we were at gave us a map but it didn't have lake depths. It only had the outline of the lake. The problem with the fishin' buddy was that you couldn't use it while moving, so I couldn't find many of the humps and breaks for walleye fishing. 2 years ago we went back to the same lodge. This time I had a portable fish finder with the suction cup transducer. I was able to use it while moving from spot to spot. We were able to fing a lot of nice spots I never would have located with the fishin' buddy.Don't get me wrong. I still have the bottom line and there are times where I prefer it, but for my fly-in the newer portable has been much better for me. I don't think cost is that much of an issue. You can get an Eagle FishEasy 2 for about the same price as the fishin' buddy I believe.Just my opinion. Hope this helpsAdam"
530065,Dave,2003-04-23 09:14:00,258,"Greg:We use Eagle portables that work fine. Sitting in a 14 -16' Naden with a 9.9 Yammie makes it easy to fish and read the Eagle. Plus you can position it so the guy in front can see it at a glance. One set of fresh batteries lasts all week, we average 12 hours/day on the water."
530066,Guest,2003-04-23 09:25:00,0,"Check into or look for a Vexilar ""boundry waters"" unit. I replacedmy old portable Hummingbird with this unit and love it. It has a verysmall footprint - very light and marks great. Best of all it is self contained and runs all week on 8 AA batteries - hence the smallfootprint. Great unit - highly recomend. Get a nice hand held GPS.They really help re-finding hot spots and structure."
530067,bigfish1965,2003-04-23 09:50:00,3210,"Also had an Eagle ( Lowrance) portable. Great unit. When I bought my boat, I attached the transducer to the front trolling motor and it became permanent. Works better than the bigger rear unit most days."
