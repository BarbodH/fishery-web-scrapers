I just killed 'em with jigging spoons, blade baits, and jigs with plastic (crawlers on the jigs, nothing on the metal). That was near Eagle's nest and down stream. Every drop-off seemed to hold many, many small fish , but as we got closer to Tobin Lake Lodge we started getting some larger females.That drop just out from Tobin Lake Lodge was great. But... we also caught nice (less numbers) out in the main lake at Elk Island."
530196,Guest,2003-04-25 16:01:00,0,Not to put a damper on your trip but when I lived in SaskatchewanI was told the fishing was not great in the river until end of june to the start of july depending on the current and clarity of the water. I personaly never tried it myself. The fish could be out in the lake downstream from the river. Hope I'm wrong. Good luck!
