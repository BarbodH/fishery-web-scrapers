529794,RCKC,2003-04-23 08:32:00,14,"Thanks ""i am walleye"" for the reponse. The only draw back is you have to wait a little longer to fish in August. I'm ready to go now. I've heard of the trolling in Big Sand. I heard their is all kinds of traffic when the moon is out. Can't wait."
529795,iamwalleye1,2003-04-24 11:58:00,1589,I am taking a trip to LOW in July so It is not to long of a wait.If you have a VHF it comes in handy for the night bite. Channel 68 there is always people on.
529788,iamwalleye1,2003-04-15 17:25:00,1589,Just one trip this year august !
529796,Guest,2003-04-16 06:32:00,0,I'll be there from June 26th- Jul 2nd.
529789,RCKC,2003-04-16 09:04:00,14,">Just one trip this year august ! iamwalleye, have you ever been up there in August before, and how does it compare to the first of June?"
529790,Reels,2003-04-16 18:02:00,2876,"It depends on what kind of fishing you enjoy. Better trolling in the summer, jigging in the spring. You can get pigs any time of year, but I personally think your chances for bigger fish are in June.Weather is more consistant in August.<{{}}><"

529782,Guest,2003-04-13 19:19:00,0,"rtmg (Rob) took me into ""Hidden Lake"" & ""Lost Lake"" from crappies. We had a blast & even caught lots of fish. Never fished them before, it was a learning experience. Will admit that they also taste GREAT ! WrD"

529785,dwrisch,2003-04-14 06:57:00,13,"I will be in Minaki May 31st to June 7th at Paridise Cove 2 in cabin 6. Stop in if you are in Minaki at the same time. Rob, this is for you too.Don"
529783,DonC,2003-04-14 07:05:00,93,"le pic,I fish in the shallows of large bays with 2 inch soft plastics on 1/16 ounce lead heads. I am not an expert on all the patterns up there for crappie by any means. It looks like it is warming up nicely in Minaki. I wonder when the ice will be out.Don"
529786,RCKC,2003-04-14 08:46:00,14,I'm heading up in August this year. We usually go in June. What can I expect in the first week of August. We will be staying at Paradise cove.
