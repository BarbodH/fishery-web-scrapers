1093194,REG,2009-04-01 14:30:00,445,That sounds really good (as do all of these) but we tend not to gently brown anything - unless it's in the deep fryer. Do you think this breading would stand up to the fry pappy? Thanks -
1093233,@Lunker,2009-04-01 15:52:00,835,"Don't see why not. Give it a try. Just take care not to overcook. And I understand exactly what you're saying about not ever ""gently browning"" anything."
1093267,drlee,2009-04-01 17:20:00,409,"My son cooks the walleyes. I do the side dishes: Fettucini Alfredo, Buffalo chili, scrambled eggs with ham n' cheese, mac n' cheese, mashed potatoes and gravy, rice teriyaki. The guys love it! NO, not all at once...stay tuned for my list of ""horse's ovaries"" or however you spell apetizers in French."

On Sinorswins video he had video of them making Walleye Chimi's. And that sounded great to me but have never atttempted to make them and wondered if anyone here has and would give me a recipe."
1092424,Lovetofish,2009-03-30 14:21:00,458,Hope you hear back on this one because I want it too.
1092503,Moondog,2009-03-30 17:34:00,362,And I know that this has been discussed many times but what the heck? What about recipes for favorite walleye batter or dry coating? I also want the chimi recipe....we leave May 23 for 5 weeks in Gull Rock........need lots of recipes!!!
1092713,alanb,2009-03-31 09:09:00,56,We cross the border at Ft. Frances and always stop by the welcome center. Every year they have a new recipe available. One year was a honey batter. We also take some jerk seasoning and make jerk walleye one night. Our group runs between 10 and 14 each year. I can either post some recipes from years past here (if I get several request for recipes) or PM me and I'll get them to you. Alan
1092802,@Lunker,2009-03-31 12:21:00,835,"1) Mix Shore Lunch breading half and half with corn meal. Roll the filets in it and fry.2) Roll the filets in beaten egg and then Panko breading and then brown gently in olive oil.3) Roll the filets in beaten egg and then a mixture of half and half Italian seasoned bread crumbs and grated Romano cheese (the kind in the shaker jar in the dairy section). Then brown gently in olive oil. This one'll knock your socks off. It elevates a fish fry (which is already heaven on earth to begin with) to an uptown meal.Oh......and when you have left overs (heaven forbid, but you might want to do this on purpose) a cold fish sandwich with a slice of raw onion and a bit of mayo, juiced with an ice cold beer is also heaven on earth for lunch.Edited to add....you can also use leftovers for fish tacos.....add some shredded cabbage, tomatoes, cheese, etc."
1092857,Moondog,2009-03-31 14:51:00,362,"We also used left over Walleye for a Walleye McMuffin breakfast........ Toasted english muffin with tartar sauce, piece of cheese and a chunk of walleye......micro for 40 seconds.....I can taste it now."
1092933,tly,2009-03-31 18:19:00,1900,Any recipes you come up with give em a try first. You can buy Pollak for <$2/lb and it is very similar to eye's. Before I would lug stuff in for a new treat I would try it first. Get the group together for a planning meeting & make up whatever for a vote.
1093012,lobo1,2009-04-01 02:06:00,734,steamed / stir fry little oil in a skillet over the camp fire - stir fry some onion/bell peppers/cannned shrooms...seasoned to taste - maybe a little jalapeno or extra black pepper get em just about done - add a little lemon juice or lemon slices and the juice from the canned mushrooms to the veges. lay seasoned (both sides) filletes on top of the veges cover tight with foil for about 5 minutes or until the fish flakes (depends how hot your fire is). We did ours right after frying the taters so the pan was good and hot. stir fried veges/steamed fish scooped on top of some home fries...........add an ice cold malted illegal beverage and ooh mama!! lobo1 EDIT - You can do the stirfry just about fat free if you wipe most of the pan out after cooking the taters but you may need a little more liquid than the juice from the canned mushrooms.

1093121,joeman79,2009-04-01 10:01:00,417,"I made fish Tacos 2 years ago and used coleslaw mix instead of lettuce and made a creamy cilantro sauce and fesh salsa. They were fantastic!! Lettuce would have been good to but cabbage gave it a nice crunch, and the cilantro and salsa a nice bite. Deep fried the walleye in cajun batter. Gettin hungry."
