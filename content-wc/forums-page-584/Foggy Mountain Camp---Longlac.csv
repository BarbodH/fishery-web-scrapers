1087311,lenray,2009-03-11 21:03:00,467,This camp appears to advertise its cabins on McKay lake. I have fished McKay and know these cabins are not overlooking McKay Lake. My guess is they are on another lake up river from McKay. The camps can be reached from Manitouwadge on up to Caramat and probably some further northwest--my guess. Anyone know for sure what lake the cabins are located on???????
