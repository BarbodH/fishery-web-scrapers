1090818,Guest,2009-03-25 09:55:00,0,A good fishing buddy of ours passed away last month. His family wants us to take his cremains (ashes) across the border to his favorite lake in Canada. Does anyone know what the reguations are of this - if it is even possible.
1090844,Obabikon,2009-03-25 10:49:00,2370,I've had several guests bring them up to scatter them. I've never even thought of the legality. I don't believe there would be anything wrong.

1090888,rockpt,2009-03-25 12:26:00,589,"Here's the short answer: Importation of Cremated Human Remains Into Canada 9. Cremated human remains, because they do not pose a quarantine risk, do not require a death certificate. However, it is recommended that when transporting the cremated remains that the importer should carry a copy of the death and cremation certificate and ensure that the remains are in a container that can easily be scanned (e.g., cardboard, wood or plastic)."

I've mentioned to them that that trip will be the ONLY one where they will beat me!"
