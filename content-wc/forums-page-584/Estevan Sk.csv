The 2008 fall precipitation varied from near normal to above normal providing for fair fall soil moisture conditions in much of the region. Winter precipitation for much of the region has been above normal with areas around Estevan at much above normal. An exception is in the Moose Jaw and Thunder Creek areas being at near normal winter precipitation. Moist fall conditions combined with above normal to normal winter precipitation has resulted in an above average runoff potential in most of the region. Boundary, Nickle Lake, and Moose Mountain Reservoirs are expected to fill this spring. The water levels of Rafferty and Alameda Reservoirs are expected to rise 3 metres and 4 metres respectively. Releases from both reservoirs are anticipated."
1087993,1800opti,2009-03-14 15:36:00,63,Anyone from around there know if the launch is accesable at Boundary Dam? I got the urge to put the boat in the water and fish before the end of march.
1088031,oldblue2008,2009-03-14 17:57:00,313,"Was just down this afternoon checking on it. somebody with a quad/blade pushed a path down to the water. Still some snow on top of it, so might be a little slick getting back up the hill. Would also be nice to make a controlled back up down the hill as well. My truck don't float so good!! Hoping we have good sun and some temp the next few days to melt it a little more. Water was up 8 inches in January. If you are thinking of heading this way check with me, maybe I will know more, or give me some notice and I can go check.[email protected] Barry"

1088186,oldblue2008,2009-03-15 14:02:00,313,"went down there an hour ago. Two boats out fishing, slope is bare to the cement the bottom 40 feet, still some snow/ice above that up the hill, but a truck drove down and backed up no problem. But, he also had 4 wheel drive. I don't. we did a little more shoveling to encourage melting. if we don't get any major snow this week, it should be good for next weekend, weather depending. Water was like glass today, air temp around 40 degrees barr"
1088715,Guest,2009-03-17 11:21:00,0,How is the bite any word? on shore or in a boat.
1088829,oldblue2008,2009-03-17 17:58:00,313,"don't know about the boats fishing, but heard shore fishing on the launch side was very slow. Don't know how they were doing at the hot water return. I was there 2 weeks ago, and not even a bite. Water is warming up and the slimey weeds are growing, so got that with every cast. Water came up about 8 inches in January."
1089611,oldblue2008,2009-03-20 18:40:00,313,"Was out today for about 5 hours, nice day, not too much wind, glass along the south shore across from the beach. about 6 boats out. Caught a 3 -3 1/2 lb walleye, and about 7-8 small one lb ers. Caught all the small ones in about 25 minutes, and then they quit. talked to one American and they said it was real slow for them. Another Canuck boat was catching a few smaller walleye just before dinner and they said the big pike were chasing them. Water temp is 50-53 degrees across from beach. Barry"
