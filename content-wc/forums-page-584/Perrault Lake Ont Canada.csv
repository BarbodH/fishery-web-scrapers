1089365,Raymond3588,2009-03-19 19:05:00,3,"Trying out a new lake this year. Trying to fish 'em all in Ontario and have a ways to go. Lookin' for shared info on Perrault Lake Ontario for last 10 days of June time period. I have been fishin' Eagle Lake Ont (36 miles south of Perrault Lake) mainly Vermillion Bay; West Arm; Portage and Back Channel for going on 20 years now. Would like to share info with anyone who might have some patterns established for Perrault or Ceder Lake. Basic walleye techniques not required for this angler. More interested in wind and forage movements during latter June time periods which may or may not include mayflies (no pun intended). Thanks for assistance. Go lose tackle.Perrault Lake has some fine 'eyes in it. Perrault Lake Camp (Mark and Amy) were very gracious host. Although our group kinda' keeps to ourselves Mark was always checking on us asking, ""what do you need"" and ""how can I help"" . Don't get no better than that. Fish information includes Perrault has larger than average 'eyes in it. We did our best with half crawler on a jig and gulp bait (3"" minnow/black/white). The bigger gulps did not do as well. We casted a lot away from boat 'cause fish waz' in sub 10 foot water from Sat to Tuesday. Did not catch any structure like fish till Wed then at 16' feet or shallower. Had a tough time finding anything under 20"" which is a fun problem. Loads of smallmouth around any shoreline. Pike are above average and we did see some larger ones under the boat. We also fished Cedar Lake and caught fish about everywhere we stopped. Backs of bays in 10' casting gulps and crawler 1/2 or a leech and you'd find 'em. One afternoon we fished 3 hours and likely caught/released 60 'eyes. All by ourself in the back of a big bay. We caught our eaters on Cedar Lake. Nice thing about Perrault is you can get out of the wind easily. You might get wet going across a big bay but plenty of protection. If bored, just pull up along any shoreline and start pitching jigs with front troller down; you'll catch smallies; 'eyes and pike all in the same stretch of shoreline. Would go back to this lake in a wink. Last evening of trip we boated 8 'eyes between 20.4 and 24.5 inches in about 2 hours. Very satisfied with trip; Perrault Lake Camp and weather."

Some years they are all bunched up in our favotite spots and some years they are all spread out. More often than not I think they prefer a west wind and they stack up in the bays with emerging weeds. Points and saddles are good spots when the wind blows and the narrows that streches between Peraullt and down through the west leg of Cedar are good when there is no wind. Burnt out bridge area is always fun if you like pitching jigs. Try the Ord river area also but get there early it always seems to fill up quick. Jackfish bay,whale rock area and spadina if you can get into it are others to try. Not sure if this helps but good luck and have fun."

1089744,Oldschool,2009-03-21 10:47:00,163,"Nitroman has a really good take on Perrault. I have fished it many times in the last 12 years, and it is as he says. Perrault is a really easy lake to fish as it is mostly a big bowl. It gets down to 80-85 feet on the south of Bob's island, and around 50 feet out in the middle of the basin. There are a few bays on the lake, and sometimes they can be good depending on the time of year. Usually the bays are best for walleye after spawn, but still a few on the rocky edges later in the year. Mid summer they can be found around the sandy edges of islands in deeper water. Try Spadina really early in the year. After that some can be found, but mostly northerns and such after spring. Good luck in this really safe lake. It is not what I consider hot fishing after spending some weeks on other Canadian lakes, but it is good as it is pretty, easy to navigate, not very big, and the fish can be found relatively easily, if not in big numbers. I have had probably my best luck with smallies, and that is a good thing. I have gone up into Cedar a couple of times, but without knowing where to go there, it was mostly sightseeing. I caught a few in the water between the lakes, and had some fun."

As for the fishing, I thought it was mediocre. After doing a number of fly-in trips with fantastic fishing, it just doesn't measure up. It's not like we didn't catch fish...it just wasn't up to my expectations at all. For a family vacation with great accommodations and meals it was perfect. For hardcore fishing I would say no."
1091108,scoutn,2009-03-25 21:44:00,21,Any recommendations on a great hardcore fishing drive-in lake? No need for great accomodations...just great fishing and a place to sleep...
1093446,MartyT,2009-04-02 09:44:00,23,"I stayed at Rocky Shore Lodge on Perrault Lake in 2007 in late June. First trip to Canada and first time fishing for walleye, and I was really surprised at how much more difficult it was to catch fish than I was expecting. We even went out with a guide one day and caught just enough for shore lunch plus a couple for the freezer. Maybe we were just idiots, or maybe Perrault Lake isn't that great of a walleye fishery.Our best results came from backtrolling a nightcrawler harness in the crescent-shaped bay on the southwest side of Duck Island. The winds were fierce during most of our stay, making it difficult to fish much of the lake, and a lot of our backtrolling was into waves of 2 ft or more, frequently splashing over the transom. But we caught a lot of fish in that bay, I think largely because the winds were out of the south all week, pushing bait into the bay."
1093455,teddi,2009-04-02 10:18:00,349,the locals call perrault lake the dead sea. fishing in late may and early june are okay and then it goes down hill fast. i would stay on eagle.
