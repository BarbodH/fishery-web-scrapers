Which brings up something I have noticed while trying to plan and decide what to do. What I have found is that the resorts on Lac Seul are mostly full for the first two weeks of the season, yet the resort I have looked into on LOTW have basically no booked reservations at their camps for the first two weeks of the season. Any ideas why the demand to fish in May is so low on LOTW? I assume the ice would be out on both at about the same time. Just something I noticed."
1091616,snaggletooth,2009-03-27 13:02:00,135,"Although I cant bear witness.......its generally known to regulars that mid to late july is peak fishing on LOTW. Due to work schedules, I'm there in late August. I'd love to see how good it is in July."
1092615,J-Man,2009-03-30 23:09:00,191,"I'm not sure how to explain the general lack of bookings for opener on LOTW. Historically, our opener is at about 50% before week 2 gets roaring at full blast. I think a lot of it is some of the not so good early season weather than can happen, especially when openers hit earlier depending on how the calendar falls. Have had many groups come through on opener and then change to June for various reasons and have just as good fishing so they figure they would gamble for slightly warmer weather than opening might otherwise provide on average.A few of our longest serving opening week groups have some of the best fishing of the year from the word go, but they have fought some weather over the years, especially some of the past few years. Walleyes have really been pretty steady the last 2-3 years on LOTW and don't think you can go wrong in any time period. Weather patterns can always make things more difficult, but dedicated anglers that is how it goes.If you want American Plan in the Morson area of LOTW, give Obabikon and New Moon Lodge a look. Both would be great choices if AP is the way you want to go. Both have great food and that is the most important thing, right? You know the fishery is world class!You'll have less traffic opening week on LOTW if that is at all attractive to you."

1090594,geareng,2009-03-24 12:14:00,335,"We have fished Lac Seul for the Walleye opener for many years with a houseboat from Lac Seul Floating Lodges. With the economy the way it is, we had to cancel because we could not get enough of our group to commit. I was thinking of trying LOTW with say four of us staying at a cabin with an american plan. I went to a sports show and talked to Whitefish Bay Camp and Duck Bay Lodge, both seem nice. A friend of mine recommended Buena Vista Resort, but he hasn't stayed there in a few years. So what I am looking for is maybe a little advice on LOTW resorts, particularily the above mentioned ones. We would be interested in one of the first three weeks of the season and we have our own boats."
1090625,rpieske,2009-03-24 13:44:00,1276,"I have a friend who stays at Duck Bay Camp each year and I pick him up there to fish for muskies. The camp is well run and well situated for fishing. I am sure you would be happy there. It is an island camp and you will need to run your boats to the camp. It is pretty easy to find your way from Stevens Bay, Morson or from Nestor Falls. If you have a GPS (and I strongly urge you to have one with the Hotmaps Premium North or the Lakemaster chip) I can furnish you the coordinates or you can get them from the owners. I don't think you will regret staying there."
1090632,tlars,2009-03-24 14:03:00,137,"If you've enjoyed Lac Seul in the past, why not try Silver Water Wheel for the opener?"
1090698,snaggletooth,2009-03-24 16:53:00,135,"I have been to Duck Bay Lodge several times in the past 6 years. Nice cabins and rental boats. Dave is fussy about the quality of his rental fleet. Good food and good fishing nearby. They have good guides there too. Or, Mr Pieske has lots of experience in that area. If the boat ""escalator"" at Turtle Potage is working, (maybe even odds on that) & you're in good shape, you can spend a day or more fishing Whitefish Bay. Huge difference in water clarity between the 2 portions. Whitefish Bay is like fishing in an aquarium."
1090743,SeulAreaWalleye,2009-03-25 06:18:00,100,"LAC SEUL ALTERNATE or LAC SEUL OPTIONS? There are many great opportunities for lac seul fishing here, including A/P, great docking for your boats, etc. If you would like some more options for drive to fishing Lac Seul East area, feel free to message me. I wish you great luck this opener, regardless...things are started to melt away up here......"
1090753,geareng,2009-03-25 06:41:00,335,"First, thanks for all of the advice..... Regarding Duck Bay Camp, I keep hearing the mention of Yellow Girl Point. Where is that from Duck Bay? Regarding options for Lac Seul. The problem is that the area I always prefered at Lac Seul is the NE section, say around Chamberlain. The only way I know to easily get there is either with a house boat or one of the outpost camps. But with the outpost camps, can you trailer there with a boat or do you have to use their camp boat? If there are camps that exist in that area that I could bring my own boat, I would be very interested. I don't really feel like motoring hours to get to that section of Lac Seul. When we went last year, because of ice conditions we couldn't get through and we were forced to stay in the southern section."
1090795,Guest,2009-03-25 08:53:00,0,Ojibway outfitters or Andersons you would park at Deception landing & bring your boat up to their outposts
1090816,tyeeguy,2009-03-25 09:53:00,111,I have been going to Whitefishbay Camp for 8 years on and off. I always seem to find my way back there again.This year I'm trying another resort on Lake of the Woods for one week and the next week I'm going to WBC. The price is right and Bob and Peg are as nice as you will find. The camp is close to the fishing spots and quiet due to being on an island (no car traffic at 1am to wake you up).I have never fished the early season but in Aug the big fish board always has fish from June on it.
1090952,IMWalleye,2009-03-25 15:27:00,35,I agree with Jabs suggestion of Lac Seul Outposts at Chamberlain Narrows.www.lacseuloutposts.com You can follow their camp passenger/freight boats from Deception up to the camp. My group has been going there for years. It is an outstanding experience year after year. Send me a note if you want to know more.[email protected]
1091149,Slayer,2009-03-26 06:15:00,41,"I've been fishing every spring out of Duck Bay Lodge for the last 10 years. It's like old home week. Many regulars who like to fish multi species. Your close to plenty of diffferent structure for Walleye and Northerns. The staff are well trained and very helpful and the food is very good. After as many years as I've been going there you can get biased, but I've never had a reason to change. The comments on the maps and GPS are good, however the lodge does come to the landing to guide you to the resort if needed."
