1058333,Guest,2008-10-01 14:22:00,0,"I will be going to a fly-in camp on Joint Lake in Manitoba, flying out of Bolton Lake next year at the end of June. Does anyone have any experience with this lake? I found only a few previous references to this lake but nothing pertaining to fishing it. There are no depth maps for this lake so any recommendations would be appreciated. How is the river fishing and how far would you travel? Also, being a life long Ontario fisherman and this being my first trip to Manitoba, how do people manage using barbless hooks? It must be OK because everyone has to do it. But it just feels like I'm ruining an expensive lure just for the chance to give it a few casts to see if it works. Once you bend them down, I'm sure they don't come back up. And hook replacement seems like a lot of effort. I'm thinking I'll just bend down barbs on a few of the ol standby's and jigs."

One issue that you should be aware of, though, is that it is extremely easy to switch lures as conditions change, and to forget to bend down the barbs on the new lure before using it. Manitoba rules state that all of your lures do not have to be barbless, but any hooks that are attached to any rod (whether it is being used or not) in the boat must be barbless. My friends and I have found it very easy to forget to bend them down. Something to keep in mind. Good luck, Bill Krejca"

They have a container of various sized and type of barbless hooks, split rings and a pair of split ring pliers for the Manitoba trip. Make releasing fish much easier too. Bait holding barbs on the shank do not have to be pinched."
1058463,Guest,2008-10-02 06:17:00,0,"Thanks for the reply and thoughts. I think I will keep a lure box (plano 3700) or something just for the barbless lures to help keep track of which ones have been bent down. If there is a split ring plier designed to help get hooks off of tho rings, I will look into that. I have tried to replace hooks before and have just given up trying."
1090589,Guest,2009-03-24 11:58:00,0,"My group has fished Joint Lake twice. Once in early July and the next time in mid August. It is a nice sized lake with trophy Walleye, Northern and Lake Trout availble. Trevor and Jodi are great and I'm sure Trevor will mark your maps well. That said, if you are planning on going for lakers the end of June they will probably be down or on there way down by then which is fine because the trout hole is very easy to find. As you head out of the river to the main lake, line yourself up with the river flowing out of lakes north end. When you notice the depth dropping to 55-60' that's where to start trolling. We used the large Dipsy Divers to get our 1oz and smaller spoons down to the 40-50' range. It is about a one mile trolling streach and a couple of hook-ups per pass was not uncommon. We had our best luck trout fishing there in the heat of the afternoon. Eater Walleyes were plentful in the river both north and south of the cabin. We caught some monsters trolling deep running rattling crankbaits in the above Lake Trout hole in the evenings until dark. We found big Northerns south of the cabin and in the river as it flows out the north end. There is also a large weedy bay on the west side of the main lake that has good Northerns. Good luck and say Hi to Trevor from Moose in Iowa."
1091886,Guest,2009-03-28 15:28:00,0,"Thanks for the information. I spoke with Trever at the All Canada show in Des Moines, and got similar information on the Trout hole. I have purchased a couple 6"" Williams Whitefish and some 2 and 3 oz jigs for trolling trout. Did you fish the small islands on the East end of the lake or some of the points on the south end? It's hard to tell from the aerial photos but they seem like potential walleye spots. In the river, how did you target the big northern? I have used dead bait over bobbers in deep holes before with success in rivers."
1092766,Guest,2009-03-31 11:35:00,0,"We did some drift jigging for trout with success but it depended on wind conditions. To much wind and you blew to fast to keep you jig near the bottom, to little and you had to run the motor to maintain a drift. If you run out of rubber tails, use some northen belly from shore lunch. We used some larger spoons but had better luck with the same daredevles we used for pike, using a size 001 Dipsy Diver to get the spoon down to as deep as 50ft. We did have luck on Walleyes around the east islands and trolling from that area toward the trout hole. As I remember it is a nice rocky bottom that gradually slopes into 60 ft. As you come out of the river to the lake we caught walleyes around the first point to the east. Very nice rocky reefs there and we would both jig and troll depending on the wind. While at Joint we trolled 1oz Dardevils, Gator Spoons and Len Thompsom #5's for the pike. Last year at Aswap we added Bulldawgs and Suicks to our arsenal with success. South of the cabin after you get though the narrows, (which always held walleye), you will see a finger in the river heading west which has a north and south finger toward the end. All these fingers were good for decent size nothern plus a great place to fish if the weather gets bad. Good luck."
1094613,Guest,2009-04-06 12:28:00,0,"Barbless, You have received the best Joint Lake advice available from the two-time Joint Lake angler, and Manitoba Master Angler, Moose from Iowa. Joint is a great lake to fish. You will have a great time. The monster walleye and trout on the main lake are among the most memorable fish I have caught (in 28 years of fishing with Moose). In fact, I caught 29 trout over 29 inches the trip we took the first week of July using the technique Moose described...except, I didn't pinch down the barbs on the 2 ounce daredevils I used for trout. The barbs on a hook this size are very difficult to pinch, so I exchanged the treble hooks with a single barbless hook of appropriate size. I bought the single barbless hooks at Cabelas, and with a pair of split ring pliers, changed a half dozen spoons in a couple minutes. Doing this before the trip, I ran no risk of forgetting to pinch the barbs. I agree with previous posts that fishing with barbless lures doesn't change the fishing that much, as long as you keep tension on the line. The benefits of easily and quickly releasing the fish, and not getting a barb stuck in the net or yourself... or your fishing buddy... far outweighs the alternative. I had great success with chartreuse five of diamonds and pink five of diamonds (2 ounce size) for the trout, one ounce chartreuse five of diamonds for pike, and 1/4 ounce jigs tipped with Berkley Power baits or platic tails for walleye in the river. Any deep diving rattling crankbaits worked well in the evening for the big walleye on the main lake in the trout hole or around the rocky island on the north east side of the main lake. You will know which Isalnd I am talking about...it has huge white boulders at the waterline that are easily seen when the sun shines off them. If I were going back to Joint Lake, I would purchse a few of the 6.5 inch 1 5/8 ounce Rattlin' Super Ciscos that are offered by a seller on e-bay named tacklebooty...especially the Fire-Tiger Color. I caught over 60 inches of Walleye (3 fish) in 10 minutes with this lure last year at Aswap. I am certain it would be a walleye slayer for the evening fishing on the main lake at Joint. You should be able to catch your fill of tasty eating sized walleye in the narrows, just past the beaver lodge, in the river south of the cabin. We called the narrows ""Hy-Vee"" because of the ease in which you can pick up dinner there. The river provides good protected fishing if the wind is strong, especially from the north. If the cabin gets hot, there is a very scenic, elevated point just a short stroll uphill behind the cabin that is high enough to catch a refreshing breeze. Don't forget your camera. I am certain you have seen beautiful places and wonderful things in Ontario, but you never know what you'll cross paths with in this area. If you remember, tell Trevor 'hi' from his pheasant hunting buddy in Omaha."
1094972,Guest,2009-04-07 13:36:00,0,You guys got me so fired up to go fishing I say let's just skip turkey season and mushroom hunting and go straight to Manitoba. Thank for the information. I am certain it will make my time at Joint Lake much more productive. I will post the results when I get back.
