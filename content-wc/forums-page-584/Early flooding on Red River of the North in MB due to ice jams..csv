So far the ice stopped short of major structural damage....we think, too early to know yet. There will be electrical, plumbing, and other concerns just as it was in 97.The real water will start to hit there this week and next so that will be a time of concern on if the ice moves or not. The expanded flood way system will take care of the water, the ice jams are another creature all together.We will keep the good vibes headed Stu's way and hope the damage is minimal for everyone concerned in the end.We are bracing for a second ""Crest"" here in Fargo?Moorhead now, they think it will be even higher. I'll be sandbagging my place this time for sure at the new projection as it was close last time. Many suspect it will not hit the new mark, but we are preparing as if it will.One sure thing, them cats are getting fatter by the day, they love high water."

Our good friend Stu McKay is dealing with significant flooding and dangerous ice at his lodge on the Red.Cats on the Red"" ice jam photo's slide show.""Lets all keep Stu and his whole family in our prayers tonight!"
1091486,joeman79,2009-03-26 23:59:00,417,"WOW!!! Hoping and praying it don't get any worse! Saw some coverage on Tv about it today, looks bad. Hope you come out of this OK Stu. Don't know you but enjoy your comments and posts! Joe"
1091644,Pooch,2009-03-27 14:51:00,4619,"Hey Backwater,Are these photos of your place?Pooch"
1091680,kastmaster,2009-03-27 17:57:00,6,"The photos are of Stu McKay's ""Cats on the Red"". We were just there this past weekend. It looks to me that the water is up about 15 feet or so. Every truck that was there last weekend would be under water. It is amazing how fast the water can come up. Our prayers go out to you Stu!!!!!! Kastmaster"
1091685,Backwater Eddy,2009-03-27 18:31:00,3871,"Yes that is Stu's place on the Canadian end, I'm in the flood in the Central Red here in Fargo/Moorhead.On Kastmasters comments on the trucks, more like 10' or so above the top of the trucks in the parking lot would be more like it. That river is high there...in the photo's you see it spilling over onto the scenic drive above ""Cats on the Red""..and that sir.... is high.The recent word I received is the jam is still holding but the river has not rose much more so they are hoping it lets loose before the serious water starts to arrive there from the South.Stu is too tough/stubborn to let a little thing like a record flood and massive ice jams slow him down, he much like the sumo catfish he pursues will adapt and persevere in the end."
1091699,Backwater Eddy,2009-03-27 19:12:00,3871,"Check out these AP photo's of the event..#1 Elsie...I know her...she ice fish's with me from time to time. #9..yu...that be Stu...he is a media hog...LOL! Lots of great pictures here, all too familiar but great pictures non the less.Red River Flood Fight AP Photo shoot. What you see in these photo's is Community, not looting, or fatalism, but community working to help each other. Even knee deep in a bad situation, it's still a beautiful thing to behold."
1094347,Guest,2009-04-05 17:12:00,0,"Eddy those are some stunning pictures. I hope everything calms down for you guys up on the Red. I have only made a couple trips up to ""Cats"" but I consider Stu a friend and I am extremely concerned about what I see in those pictures. Here in middle Iowa we deal with these floods almost every spring. It is somewhat inspiring to see the strength of the human bond when times get tough. It tends to flush out some of the bad that builds up inside all of us. Please keep us informed of the situation as there are alot of people that care and would like to know. I run with clients of Stu's from Sioux City,iowa and we were hoping to get back up to Cats this fall after a couple years of lack of funds. Chin up,stay safe and your never alone when you have friends."
1094438,Northern Manitoban,2009-04-05 21:06:00,195,"great photos Eddy I had them sent to me also from a good source I took these photos last week this is across from Stu's place, will be there again tuesday check things out, hope it all goes okay for him very scaryhttp://www.xtremesportfishing.com/fo...php?f=2&t=1200"
1094666,fishncamp,2009-04-06 14:58:00,49,The water is open and moving now in front of Stu's.....it actually went down a bit too. I just got back from there. Stu's is 5 minutes from my home.
1094711,fishncamp,2009-04-06 17:14:00,49,The ice in the Selkirk area and north is still rather solid so ice daming is still a real threat up here. Winnipeg also still has solid ice in some areas.
