It's a man made reservoir, so the Pike / walleye cover isn't the typical 4 - 12 foot weedy bays that you normally see. Decent bass but the walleye catches were always VERY tough. Pike was okay. Overall, we left because the fishing was declining and there is a lot of water to cover without a tremendous number of great hot spots.Did manager a lake trout or two but that's big water 90' or more and the wind is a bear on that open water like that. Bottom line: there are better Ontario spots."
