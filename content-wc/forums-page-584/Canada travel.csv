I have nothing else on my record. Has enough time gone by that I won't have any trouble? Do I still need to get some paperwork? I have a passport, we went to Portugal 2 summers ago. I am thinking about Canada this summer and would like to know if everything is fine. Is there a website anybody knows of that I might go to also get some answers to my questions? Thanks for any help you can give me. dmack"

Usually if enough time has passed they will deem you rehabilitated and let you enter, then again, some other agents may not. My brother got a OWI in 98 and he managed to enter canada last year to go fishing with us. This agent just checked our passports and asked where we were going and what we were bringing then just let us go in matter of minutes. The year before a different agent asked us a whole bunch of questions and asked if we had been fingerprinted and all that and even searched the whole truck and checked out our background. It's a toss up. Don't know if this was any help for you but that's what I experienced with the customs. Since 23 years has passed I would think you would be ok."

If you are sent to Canada Immigration for further investigation and it has been 10 years since your last day of probabtion or any other sentence you will be deemed to have been rehabilitated provided you have no other criminal convictions since then and it was a small offence such as a DWI/DUI/OWI etc. if not, you will be deemed criminally inadmissable and returned to the USA. I hope this helps.Please feel free to contact any CBSA office and you can get further information. There is also a 1 800 # you can call."
