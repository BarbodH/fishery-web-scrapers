Rafferty still has solid ice and snow pack on it. No or little signs of melting yet, and warmer weather is still a few days away. Here is the runoff forecast as of April 1st. If we get warm weather and it speeds up the melt, looks like we are in for some water, which we did need. oldblue2008 As of April 1, 2009 The Southeast region covers an area generally from the Canada/United States border, north to and including Regina; and from the Saskatchewan/ Manitoba border, west to Moose Jaw, including the Thunder Creek Watershed. The 2008 fall precipitation varied from near normal to above normal providing for fair fall soil moisture conditions in much of the region. Winter precipitation for much of the region has been above normal with areas around Estevan at much above normal. An exception is in the Moose Jaw and Thunder Creek areas being at near normal winter precipitation. Moist fall conditions combined with above normal to normal winter precipitation has resulted in an above average runoff potential in most of the region. Boundary, Nickle Lake, and Moose Mountain Reservoirs are expected to fill this spring. The water levels of Rafferty and Alameda Reservoirs are expected to rise 3 metres and 4 metres respectively. Releases from both reservoirs are anticipated."
