1093305,walleyestalker,2009-04-01 19:32:00,9,I have been asked numerous times what happens when I cross the border. Can a person be turned around at one border crossing and go another and possible get across? Or will the next crossing know you just tried... I have no idea anyone know...
1093323,balsl6,2009-04-01 20:27:00,426,I actually think if you are turned away at a border they tell you it a criminal offense to try and get in at any other. I am not 100% sure but I was told that from someone once before.

1093345,J-Man,2009-04-01 22:00:00,191,I've heard more than once that they will make you sign something stating you are aware that you are inadmissible and can/will be arrested if you try to gain entry again without the proper paperwork to clear up whatever it was that made you inadmissible.
1093970,JinxCanada,2009-04-04 06:18:00,1306,"maybe i can help here. it really depends on the reason you were refused by Immigration. If you were refused for a Criminal record then yes, you can be arrested for attempting to re-enter Canada without a TRP (Temporary Resident Permit) from the Canadian Consulate.If you were refused for another reason, for example, to show proof of residence, no proof of citizenship, proof of no criminal convictions and you have the police clearance record to show Immigration they you may be allowed to enter Canada.You may have a minor criminal conviction for say, impaired driving as an example, it is deemed that you are ""rehabilitated"" after 10 years from the completion of your sentencing (including probation) and you are now admissable. more serious offences require prior clearance (TRP) from the consulate prior to your attempting to enter Canada.ANY, and I repeat ANY conviction (even if you only paid a fine or got probation is still a conviction) means you are Criminally Inadmissable to Canada unless otherwise stated or you have obtained a TRP first. I hope this helps."
