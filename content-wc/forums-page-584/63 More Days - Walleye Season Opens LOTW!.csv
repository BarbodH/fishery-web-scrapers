It was the 4th of July and I had my first off day in 39 days so naturaly I decided t take my wife and son fishing. I had barely stopped the boat and he had his line in the water, I turned around to grab another rod out of the rod locker and heard him laughing. I turned back around and the rod was doubled over and he was pulling, I told him to hold on a minute, I thought he was snagged. I told him to keep the rod in the air a second, I reached over and slightly pulled up on the rod, oh boy, I felt a big old head shake. I loosened the drag a little and said hold on tight keep pressure on him and he's all yours. I grabbed the net and stood back and watched him laugh and fight that fish for what seemed like an hour but it was probaly 5 or 6 minutes. My wife was telling me to help him, he was like no Dad I got it, Awesome.If you get the chance this year make your kids your favorite fishing partner, you won't regret it.Bring them up to LOTW, I will take you fishing.Check out our ad above in the WC Classifieds, Canada Resorts, Ontario(Smitty's CFA). I am going to try and give some weekly reports from LOTW this season so keep checking the Walleye Central message board for both Walleye and Muskie reports."
1087627,Golden Eagle,2009-03-13 07:13:00,2642,I'll be on the water May 15 warming up on pike. It'll be a short flight north of Red Lake for me. Haven't missed the walleye opener in 25 years
1087634,Obabikon,2009-03-13 07:49:00,2370,Let's hope all the extra snow and ice melts sooner than it did last year. Down by Morson it went out on May 7... was it out on Red Lake by opener last year? I was told by some locals that it was the latest ice out they'd seen in our area in 40+ years.
1087640,Glenman12,2009-03-13 08:01:00,762,"For you guys up there, how is this winter playing out compared to last years?...would you guess, early, normal or late ice out?"
1087665,rpieske,2009-03-13 09:06:00,1276,"The trend till the end of the month is below normal temperatures. That's below freezing. Unless there is a significant warmup in April, the ice out will be later than normal on LOTW, which is around April 27th normally. Last year it was officially out on 5/12."
1087673,Golden Eagle,2009-03-13 09:35:00,2642,"Obabikon, we went in May 16 (Friday) and had to leave from the Chukuni River because Howey Bay was shore to shore ice. We had a 3 hour wait for our departure until a wind shift moved ice so we could land near camp, which for us was a short flight north of Red Lake. Our water lines were frozen during our first 4 days in camp. Nobody was upset with conditions. I had a good bunch in my party. Both weeks. All are coming along in 2009 with a lot of new guys who were impressed with our 2008 May trip.Fishing was great. My guys are hoping for the same conditions this spring. We were limited to fishing rivers the first few days and they were on fire. I stayed 15 days and left then to be home for our 50th wedding anniversary. Should I stay 22 days this year? Not as much pressure for #51. Guys, don't even think about staying at home if ice seems to be breaking up a little late. Make the drive and make the trip work. Remember that your outfitter might not be able to have the camp in top shape and adjust. Help out if need be. Don't let anybody whine.Obabikon, shoot me your email address by PM if you'd like a few ice photos from last May in the Red Lake area."
1087688,Whopper,2009-03-13 10:37:00,340,"I won't mind another 3 hour sit and wait again this year if the fishing is half as good as it was last year. As far as the frozen water lines, no big deal, we dealt with it, and to be honest with you I had forgotten about it, catching tons of walleyes has a way of doing that to me. I best be putting on a pot of sauce for the trip soon Cheers"

I'm over in Clarendon Hills. At least with all this rain it has provided several good (temporary) ponds to practice casting."
1092551,Lotw Fan,2009-03-30 19:28:00,1,"Scott, I don't want to advertise your employer, but I think we have met. I learned the lake from Conrad E. , Jack H, Bobby E, Ed Crawford et al. I enjoy your posts and look forward to seeing you this year. I will be up for trout May 13 or so. Email me or post a reply. Had to respond as I caught my 1st 10#er at 9 yrs. Best regards, Scott C."
