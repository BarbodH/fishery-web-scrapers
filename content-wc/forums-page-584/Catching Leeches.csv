1094699,Mohleye,2009-04-06 16:20:00,368,"In my opinion you are reading it correctly. Non-residents may not trap baitfish, but leeches are OK."

Its not one of those ""catch 100 walleye a day"" types of places, but its secluded and we are usually the only people on the lake. The first two trips to lake were in August. On my second trip there, I noticed a bunch of leeches attached to rocks along the shore. Now, I had been fishing with store-bought leeches the first couple days with good success, but when I hooked on one of these ""local"" leeches I started outfishing my buddies 2-1.That was in August and the leeches were easily found. Last year, when we went up at the end of May, these ""local"" leeches could not be found. I had read online about setting up a ""leech trap"" with old coffee cans, so I tried that. No luck. Anyway, I'm wondering if anyone on this site has had any luck catching leeches in any of the lakes you fish, in the month of may. Where do you place your trap? What type of meat/bait do you put in the can? Any info appreciated.Thanks!Jmor"
1093422,tackleman,2009-04-02 08:20:00,444,one of the guys I fish with catches leeches by putting raw chicken in a burlap bag overnight. but he said you have to pull the bag out before daylight since the leeches go back into the mud bottom when the daylight comes.
1093428,jmor1717,2009-04-02 08:39:00,11,"That's what I tried, but I don't think I was in the right spot. What type of area is he putting the bag, muddy bottom, rocky, weedy?Thanks"
1093505,tackleman,2009-04-02 13:56:00,444,I think he was in a creek with a mud bottom but he tells me that sometimes he goes to beaver ponds and puts the bag off the dam. I would assume that there must be some kind of water flow though. He also puts raw liver in some bags.
1093525,Moondog,2009-04-02 15:45:00,362,"While we always buy leeches on the way to camp and they seem to work well in May and June, I was told that native leeches are not evident as natural bait until mid July. When the bite is on all live bait works. So where do the vendors get them if they can't get them from the USA and they aren't in the lakes yet. Hmmm......a quandry."
1093896,phishfearme,2009-04-03 18:02:00,1242,"isn't it illegal for non-residents to ""trap"" leeches??"
1094009,J-Man,2009-04-04 09:27:00,191,"Yes, it's illegal for any Non-resident to attempt to capture bait of any kind.""Only resident anglers may capture baitfish, using the methods outlined below.""http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business...02_165361.html"
1094287,Woollybob,2009-04-05 12:51:00,158,"According to the chart in the link above, the non-resident restriction applies only to baitfish. There is no restriction stated for leeches, crayfish, or frogs."
1094533,jmor1717,2009-04-06 08:16:00,11,"I was under the impression that trapping leeches was ok for non-residents.Also, the cabin we go to is owned by my buddy (also a non-resident), so what would the regulations be for a ""land owner""?"
1094641,Obabikon,2009-04-06 13:33:00,2370,A land owner is a non-resident.
