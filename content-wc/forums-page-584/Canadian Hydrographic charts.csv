They have it somewhere in the system and have no idea when I might see it. joeman79...I'll bet your map is in the same place as mine..."
1092475,1shooter,2009-03-30 16:35:00,1493,Is there a good place to buy these online?

1092549,mdoehling,2009-03-30 19:22:00,81,"The maps at TRAKMAPS look great, I order one on 3/12. Still haven't seen it. Called Mon. last week, was told it had arrived at destination country (USA) but still not here....? If you are going to order one give them plenty of time to get it to ya, I guess thats what I'm try'n to say."
1092557,rockpt,2009-03-30 19:46:00,589,Try Thorne Bros.
1092582,Dipstick,2009-03-30 20:44:00,101,"www.canadamapsales.com This is Gov. of Manitoba site. They sell all Canadian Hydrographic Charts. Check out the ""Sabaskong"" question further down in this thread. It discusses Cndn charts. Tight Lines."
1092610,J-Man,2009-03-30 22:51:00,191,"Thorne Bros had them all the times I've been in the shop, but I didn't see them on the online store. It would be worth a call or email. You could probably pay about the same and get it faster.Canada Map Sales is where we purchase all the charts we sell in the office so you can't go wrong there either if you need to give them a call. We have always received very fast service from them, but it's not that far from Winnipeg to LOTW. Shipping to the US would add to the cost and time for delivery.The price should be around $20 each plus taxes, give or take some for exchange rates."
1092692,Tylumps,2009-03-31 08:31:00,73,A nice website is http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/englis...opo/index.html. It has some nice features for a free site.
1092705,alanb,2009-03-31 08:56:00,56,Just posted some details in the Sabaskong thread on ordering maps from Canada. Gotta call and give them a credit card but super fast delivery (less than a week). Alan
1092918,1shooter,2009-03-31 17:37:00,1493,Ended up going to the Thorne Brothers website and found them online. $19 plus freight.
1092927,joeman79,2009-03-31 17:51:00,417,I ordered some direct from Trak maps 3 weeks ago and still have not received them. They tracked them and they left Canada on the 21st and I stll have not received them. I hope they did not get lost.
