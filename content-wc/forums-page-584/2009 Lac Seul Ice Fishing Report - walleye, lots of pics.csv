1083416,BenBeattie,2009-02-24 18:04:00,232,"I'd have a lot more respect for your opinion if you didn't hide behind your keyboard and post under a fake name. Sure, there's some spots out there that have a beaten path to them and yes, they produce and produce well. Everyone around here seems to knows that. Sometimes there is no need to re-invent the wheel and we fish these high traffic areas that you referred to. Other times we try something different. It's a steep learning curve seeing as there is so much water and I haven't even had the chance to fish these areas in the summer and locate structure on my own. As was mentioned this is my first year here and I'm happy learning my way around and catching some fish. I'm just having fun and certainly didn't think I would provoke such a response. Sorry to ruffle your feathers. Since you seem to know who I am, please stop by if you see me and we can talk. I'm not trying to create any problems here. Everyone I've met on the ice so far has been very friendly and helpful. Besides, I never once mentioned a thing about guiding in the winter. I certainly don't claim to be an expert on ice fishing this area. I just thought I'd share some pictures with people here who normally don't get to fish Lac Seul through the ice. Regards, Ben Beattie"

Regardless, Ben is new to this side of Lac Seul, and being the awesome fishermen that he, and Graham are....give them a spot, and they will produce.For your information ""Mr. Guest"", I showed them this area that you speak about, so there was no need to follow the trail, to get there. Nobody owns any piece of any lake here, and if you don't want anybody to come to ""YOUR SPOT""....lol....stop marking the trail with small trees, and get yourself a helicopter for isolation! I will continue to put great guys like Ben on Great fishing spots, and for that matter anyone else that asks too....I know thousands of great spots up here....but none of them have my name etched in the water....next time own up to your writing, realize how ridiculous you sound, or mutter your comments to your wife, if she will even listen! Ice fishing is fun experience, and welcome to anyone that can endure the weather!Keep going there, and keep slamin the fish, BEN!""Colin Gosse""(my real name)"

1081403,515,2009-02-16 06:55:00,254,Yup I'm doing well just riding out the winter down here in the fishing season closed Kawartha Lakes. I did make it out once so far over to Simcoe and did well on perch but been a long season and looking forward to open season again all ready. There may be a fall trip up your way this year. I'm thinking of skipping the moose hunt and doing a 3 weeks trip up there and hitting all the lakes in a big swing that i've been wanting to do. Mostly a muskie trip but some side fishing for walleye and trout. I'll be in touch for sure if I do get something going.

1082020,tlars,2009-02-18 16:35:00,137,Greetings from Iowa Ben & Graham. Looks like there's a lot of snow on the ice. How thick is the ice?
1082166,BenBeattie,2009-02-19 10:32:00,232,"Tom? The ice is anywhere from 24-36"". Still very cold here and making more ice this week."

1082454,LoDo,2009-02-20 13:49:00,721,"Just booked a trip to Lac Seul 3rd week of June. Ive had great luck fishing LS in June in the past, however fished LS in late August last year and couldnt keep Walleyes off my hook.Stayed in Ear Falls several times, however I like Rat Bay, LS Lodge, much better as McKenzie is closer. Anyone stayed at Fishermans Cove? Booked our trip there this year!"
1082501,rather-be-fishin,2009-02-20 18:45:00,429,"I've stayed at Fisherman's Cove for 5 years....great resort, nice cabins, good service and good location.....you will like it! I'm going in July and counting down the months! It's what gets me through the LONG winters in Northern MN!"
1083158,Guest,2009-02-23 18:16:00,0,Nice pics Mr guide.. To bad you don't have the skill to find winter walleyes in your own . No guide needed to catch fish were you go .. Just find some ones trail in the snow like you did !! what a skilled guide ! lol
1083222,Whopper,2009-02-24 03:52:00,340,"Think maybe this comment was a little uncalled for. I don't think Ben would have any problem holding his own, he's had a very good winter in his new surroundings. Keep em coming Benny"

1079957,Guest,2009-02-10 13:28:00,0,"Hey Ben, Are you doing your own thing this summer, or are you going to return to the Wheel? Nice to see you on here....I've been on here for many years now. MW, Glen and I had a huge debate on the Lac Seul fishery, and specifically changes in the walleye population, back in 2003-2005. MW refused to accept the changes we were observing as being significant. He has since, though of course he would never admit it, been forced to the same conclusion. I see he finally got the 2008 #'s up on the site! Regardless, Lac Seul remains one of the best wallleye fisheries in the world. I'm glad to see you're experiencing it year-round. I've come across a few of your articles now, keep 'em coming. I've been publishing myself, but not on fish, rather forest fire mapping research in scientific journals. It's always nice to see your name in print, eh? Hope you're enjoying Sioux Lookout! NWO Fishing Bum"

1080114,Skywagon,2009-02-11 05:30:00,1106,"BenBeattie, Are you using a flasher for ice fishing and if so which one? Thanks Steve"
1080269,BenBeattie,2009-02-11 16:40:00,232,I have a humminbird ICE 45 flasher. So far it has been great. The dynamic display is great and it's big and bright. Zoom is excellent and it's dual beam too. Definitely recommend them but spring for the 45 or 55 as the 35 doesn't have the dynamic display. http://www.riversideoutdoors.ca/cata...ages/ice45.jpg
1080280,Skywagon,2009-02-11 17:15:00,1106,"Ben, I sent you a PM. Steve"
1080320,515,2009-02-11 18:46:00,254,Awesome fish Ben. Looks like a great way to spend the long winter up there. Thanks for the report and all the pics. Mike
