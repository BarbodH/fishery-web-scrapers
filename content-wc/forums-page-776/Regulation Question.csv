545401,Guest,2005-01-27 05:27:00,0,you really live up to your nickname don't you dumbo.
545404,Guest,2005-01-27 09:17:00,0,"dumbo, there is no room for interpretation here. the slot is the slot regardless of the condition of the fish. if gray areas were introduced and individual fishermen were allowed to make judgement calls, then there would effectively be no slot. i can easily envision sneaky types intentionally harming slot fish in order to keep them. its black and white and must remain so. you can support slots and other conservation methods or you can have fishing like in the states or like most of eastern ontario. take your pick."
545414,Guest,2005-01-28 07:37:00,0,"I firmly believe in conservation and believe that slot limits are a good thing. In my years of fishing I have seen many appalling and downright criminal actions by fellow outdoorsman. My cabin eats shorelunch maybe twice in the week, and only a few of us bring fish home. If I was in the same situation, I would do it again. I have a 20+ walleye that is for all purposes dead. There is more meat on this fish that there would be on two or even three 15 inchers. So if I just threw the 20 incher that was blind in both eyes to the turtles, I would then have to kill two other fish for our shore lunch. That would mean three dead ones. Instead i just ate the one that was already dead. I realize that the fish was in the slot, but eating a fish that was already dead is not the crime against nature where someone needs to hurl insults at me. When I initially started the post, I did not even think about someone mutilating a fish in the slot on purpose if there was an exception allowing you to keep dying fish. After reading the posts, I thought about it and I actually could see someone catching a slot fish, putting a hook through the eyes, or tearing out its guts and throwing it in the livewell."

Well keep on breaking the law and hopefully you get caught and loose your fishing privileges. 'Not a crime agianst nature' is quite laughable. Nice to see you feel you are important enough to decide which laws to follow and which ones to violate. I see no need to insult you, hopefully you already realise what you are."
545418,Guest,2005-01-28 09:14:00,0,"So I guess it would be wiser to kill two more fish, rather that eating the alreasy dead one. Makes sense."
545420,Guest,2005-01-28 10:12:00,0,"Dumbo, I know what you mean. We are basicly a catch and release camp. I have many guests that do not keep fish at all. Every year we see a few people bring in a fish that is to big for our slot. They are fish that are going to die or died while being caught. I know these guests ( because they have come for years), and they do not keep fish. They tell me that the fish was horribly hooked and was going to die. I believe them because of their no fish policy in years past. I still tell them they should have thrown back the fish. It is a hard call. But you still should throw it back. You should not be getting trashed on here, because you are basicly a conservationist and I understand about the one dead large fish compared to three small live ones. You are trying to do the right thing for conservation. If it wasn't for the ""poacher"" it wouldn't be a problem. Fish would be damaged by that dispicable small group of poachers. I do agree with pooch. You should remove most of the treble hooks. The front ones always damage eyes. A lindy rig with a single hook I think is the best. Remove the front treble and you probably won't run into that problem again. While were on the subject of releasing fish. When using these kinds of set ups, you shouldn't fish that deep with them. That is one of the biggest killers of fish. The fish may swim away but most of them die. We try to tell people to not fish more than 20' deep."
545428,Guest,2005-01-28 16:13:00,0,"dumbo, didn't mean to hurl any insults. having never faced your predicament, not positive what i'd do. think i't put it back though. i was merely pointing out the can of worms that would be opened if slots were up for interpretation based on the condition of the fish. another conservation tip that campowner didn't list is don't let the walleye run. i've seen guys on here talk about letting them run 30-45 seconds. guarantee you'll kill a lot of fish that way. i give them the tip of the rod and set the hook. might lose a few fish that way, but i don't spend all week trying to release gill and gut hooked fish."
545429,Guest,2005-01-28 17:18:00,0,"Whenever I have bottom bounced, unlike slip-bobber fishing, I have never had a problem with a walleye swallowing a bait because the movement of the bouncer naturally hooks the fish. This was the first time trying a rapala with a bouncer, and it snagged more (obviously) and it foul-hooked more. I have not tried it again since. Same reason I think trolling for Musky is wrong. Big hooks attach themselves everywhere but the inside of the mouth. Or if you hit the mouth, you get a top and bottom. I like to fish, not mutilate. I just wish there was some way that a dying fish could be kept, and the live ones remain in the lake."
545453,Guest,2005-01-31 06:20:00,0,"come on man, you know the rules if you poach and then brag about it on a fishing forum you will get what insults thrown at you. I have poached many times while hunting and fishing before but I am smart enough not to brag about it here, keep between your friends and nobody will be know, or follow the law."
545457,Guest,2005-01-31 07:30:00,0,"hey GBfisher remember when we went muskie poaching that weekend, your a fricking butcher man LOL. I still have the scare on my butt from your large Rod. Love ya."
545285,Guest,2005-01-22 07:05:00,0,"We were fishing with Rapala Stick Baits behind bottom bouncers with three trebles. We caught a walleye that was about 21 inches long, but the trebles foul-hooked it above the mouth and tore up his eyes. We were close to shorelunch time, so we filleted it and ate it. We were on Lac Seul so it was in the slot. There was no way this walleye would have lived. What would have happened if I had been stopped with that walleye in my boat? I am very strict about the rules (except beer in the boat...I violate that often) but I never have gone over limit. I just don't see throwing an obviously blind walleye back to slowly die. Does anyone know if there is anything written in the laws in Canada that allows you to keep a fish if it is obviously going to die, but it violates size regulations?"
545286,retire55,2005-01-22 08:22:00,1029,"Strictly following Ontario's fishing regulations, you would be charged for harvesting a slot fish. However, I suspect in many cases, the conservation officer might use his/her discretion not to charge you. These regulations that require us to release a fish (e.g. a slot fish) that we are sure will die may seem ridiculous. However, I suspect that the MNR argument for such regulations revolves about ease of enforcement."
545295,Guest,2005-01-22 15:17:00,0,You would have been ticketed for sure. I have caught walleyes with only one good eye before.
545299,Mahumba,2005-01-22 22:34:00,345,"Hi Dumbo, Fire the fish over the side and hope that it lives. I understand how you feel and I hate to waste fish also. But I wouldn't keep it. I live up here and I also understand how the law feels to. All it would take for people to keep slots or over fish is just land them and stick a hook in where it's fatal. They would just show the C.O. that it was going to die and they'd be on their way. The C.O.'s are enforcing this reg. more and more. The only way I could see an officer letting you go is if he seen you set the hook, reel it in and he saw the damage to the fish. But then again...... Roger Mayer."
545300,rebelrn2001,2005-01-22 23:38:00,1563,I have left go 35 inch Pike that are sure to die or are already dead. I almost cry. They just sink to the bottom. Not much you can do. Turtle food I guess.
545302,Guest,2005-01-23 06:19:00,0,This violation of the law would make you a Poacher.
545303,Pooch,2005-01-23 06:31:00,4619,I've pulled stickbaits behind bottom bouncers for many years and I always remove all but the trailing treble. Then also remove the bottom hook of that treble to eliminate some of the bottom snags. I really don't think I miss many fish as we are usually trolling faster than normal looking for active fish that will chase down bait. I'm thinking fish that do hit from the side are usually hooked in the side and rear of the mouth. Several sets of trebles are fish killers and really are not necessary. I also remove all barbs and it seldom costs me a fish. And if it does? So what? Every fish that gets hooked does not have to come over the side of the boat. (Unless it's my shorelunch fish!) Pooch
545342,Guest,2005-01-24 07:43:00,0,"This was the first time I tried the stick bait behind a bottom bouncer, and the last. We caught a few, and they kept foul hooking, and the one had both eyes torn out. I prefer one hook minnow spinners. They catch the fish in the top of the mouth and are easy to release. We are not poachers. Killing a dead fish would not be poaching. Releasing the thing blind in both eyes so it slowly suffers and dies would be inhuman. If we were not around the corner from shore lunch spot I would not have put it in the dead well...I would have killed it with the club and throw it back. No matter what I did, it was a dead fish."
545347,Guest,2005-01-24 12:27:00,0,"Pooch is right on with this issue....for those who would just shrug and say ""what can you do"" well try improving your catch & release. This means either switch to baits that don't damage your catch or modify them. On the issue of whether the CO's would turn a blind eye on this..forget it, you would be charged. Also the skinned-out walleye that you left after shore lunch would be plenty enough evidence to charge you with. I understand you intent on this but many others would not hesitate to use any excuse to circumvent the law. Release 'em alive..... Ben"
545350,Guest,2005-01-24 16:05:00,0,"Thought about that, and the skinned out walleye was thrown to the gulls immediately. i still think that there should be something in the law that allows for dying fish be kept."
