Both Bud & Malinda can put you in spots for the eaters as well as the trophy fish, However, all the camps on Gullrock prefer to see the big ones left in the lake to help sustain the resource. As a local this is a huge step for the camp owners to take, and we appreciate their efforts. The fishing gets better every year due to the camp owners efforts. this camp is definately worth the trip."

Most pike were in a range from 26 (just below the slot) to about 32 inches. A few pike above 32 and then the mahoot 41. If I do any more drive-ins, I would go back to Gull Rock again, though I guess the camp has changed owners since I was last there. Yes, it got windy one day I was there and boy, that was a rough ride back to shelter. Luckily, after about 5 minutes (seems like forever) we got behind a big 20+ footer cruiser that broke the waves for us and we got to shelter without loss of any important organs. :) - Rick"

545416,Guest,2005-01-28 08:03:00,0,"We're going to Gullrock for the first time this July. Can you suggest some pointers on location and baits to use. Also staying at five lakes lodge, maybe we'll see you there."
545426,18Fisher,2005-01-28 15:18:00,59,"Hey there, What week are you going up? We will be up there the third week in july. The best thing you could do is buy a map from Bud (camp owner) and he will give you the popular spots to try first. Just like anything is that the fish will collect on the windy side of an island and feed on the baitfish. Poplular tackle that we use is chartruesse? colored jigs in the 1/4 to 3/8 size. Also lindy rigs and bottom bouncers work great on the drop offs tipped with either a minnow or a crawler even leeches. That of course is mostly for walleyes and the northerns like he crank baits. Hope to see ya there. Where abouts you coming from?"
544798,Guest,2004-12-28 08:44:00,0,"Our group is thinking about booking a week at Five Lakes Lodge in September. Half our group prefers fishing for Walleye, the other half prefers Northern and Smallmouth fishing. Wondering if the Northern and Smallmouth fisherman will be disappointed. Having a meeting on Jan. 8th to make our decision. Any input will be appreciated."

544805,Guest,2004-12-28 15:38:00,0,You will not be dissapointed witht the northern fishing on this lake! It has several excellent spots to fish and remember you can always ask Bud (camp owner) how to get to those wonderful portage lakes of his to change it up. I have been going there for 5 years now and will be going the third week in july. Walleye fishing is great and if youve never been on the lake before buy a map as it will help tons. The camp facilities are great and you cant get much better than what they have. The only way to live more comfortably would be to stay home! Just remember to pack rain gear the rain seems to come from out of nowhere and right after is when the fish will bite! Good luck and have fun you wont be dissapointed 18Fisher

544806,Guest,2004-12-28 20:09:00,0,"Also fished last year out of Five Lakes and have to say, as someone who has been fishing ""up north"" for 33 years, the BEST quality/quantity walleye fishing I've experienced on a drive-to lake. Bud and Melinda do a great job of creating a comfortable environment for fisherman and families alike. We did not do much northern fishing, but I saw a couple of boats hammering the flats and boating a 37"" and 41"". No smallmouth on the main lake that I experienced, but they do have portage lakes nearby that have abundant smallies and muskies as well. My 17 year old had 6 follow-ups and never saw that young man get so excited without a long-legged blonde around. My only other recommendations for multi-species would be Wabaskang or Wabigoon. Wabaskang is a clear water lake, Wabigoon is very turbid...fish hang out very shallow on the 'Goon. Good luck with your decision, Craig"

544863,Guest,2004-12-30 07:25:00,0,"The last post touched on it, no smallmouth fishing on Gullrock. Apparently a couple of years ago, there were 5-6 smallmouths caught in survey nets and the resort oweners were not to happy. (questions on smallmouths being established and the walleye spawning success)."
544879,Guest,2004-12-31 09:02:00,0,I agree with what the other guys said Gullrock has great walleye fishing and trophy potential northerns. Bud can put you some northerns and smallmouth.But in Sept. the walleye fishing can be awesome.The camp is clean and comfortable.
544907,Guest,2005-01-03 13:29:00,0,I was wandering if this lake gets very rough from the wind if so does it happen very often. If so can you still go out or do you have to stay in. Thanks
544908,Guest,2005-01-03 15:47:00,0,"jed, Yes the big part of the lake does get rough if its real windy but usually if you really want to fish that bad you can stay close to camp and try the river. Or cast for northerns in the bays that are close. Maybe even go to a small portage lake that bud has and try that as these lakes are smaller and the wind doesnt affect themso much. Last but not least there is always golfing if you wanted a break from reeling in fish and wanted to cuss a little! Always something to do in town. go wath the bears at the dump."
