There wive's really do the work, but Pat and Wayne deal with the fishermen. ! I'd definitely do the upgrade boat though, up to the 40 HP four stroke's. You'll be able to go from their camp down to the main lake in a reasonable trip, rather than the hour or two otherwise. Their fish fry is great and they also offer day trips flying out to places like Twain Lake, Slim Lake and others, for extra cost though. Eagle can be a tough place for fish if you haven't been there before. You can hire Wayne for I think around $125 for one day and he'll put you on fish. Probably don't want to ask him to make shore lunch, because he really would rather show you the fishing. I haven't been back just because we are now doing fly-ins."
