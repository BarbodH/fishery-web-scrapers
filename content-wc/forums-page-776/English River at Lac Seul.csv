545390,Guest,2005-01-26 11:14:00,0,"We fished below the Dam in September two years ago. We caught a fair amount of fish and several nice ones 27""/28"". We stayed for a week at little canada camp and their accomadations are adequate."
545392,Guest,2005-01-26 12:31:00,0,Hi. we went to lac saul for many years and never tried below the dam till the last year. we caught a limit every day we ent below the dam. I could not say the same for above the dam.
545432,Guest,2005-01-29 13:17:00,0,"3 out of the last 4 years we spent at least part of the day shore fishing below the dam due to high winds on the lake. Caught a lot of fish, Walleye (enough to go back to the cabin & have a nice lunch), Northern, & a few huge carp. Plenty of boats on the river, most were busy pulling in fish."
545437,Guest,2005-01-30 10:25:00,0,Hi. that was our result too. Like I said I wish I knew about that area when we first started going to lac saul. i dont think they have a slot limit there either. someone explained that it was all the chopped up fish coming through the dam providing a lot of food that attraacts the fish.
545467,Guest,2005-02-01 06:05:00,0,"The fish are up below the dam for the bait fish, the bait fish are up there for the plankton which is being stirred up by the turbulent water. Itis for the same reason that you fish the windy side of a lake.I really don't believe that many fish get sucked through the turbines. It is also true that we don't have a slot limit but we do ask that the fish over 18 go back in. Little Canada Camp is a Trophy catch and release camp. We would appreciate anyone who fishes the river to do the same. Thanks Kevin Kasten Little Canada Camp"
545472,Guest,2005-02-01 08:42:00,0,Can you fish from shore?
545495,Guest,2005-02-02 00:08:00,0,while we were there in the boat there were a number of people fishing from the shore and they seemed to be doing pretty good too.
