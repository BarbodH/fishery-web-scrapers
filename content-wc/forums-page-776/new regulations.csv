The MNR, be they right or wrong, are trying to protect the fishery for the future of everyone, from any country that wishes to come and fish or hunt. I have seen on my lake, Gullrock, near Red Lake, the catchand release system help improve the fishing from ok to great, and any little bit of help only makes it improve, The regulations talk about possession limits, not catch limits. However in a study I read recently, the releasing of fish into warm water (ie:July water temps) does not improve anything as the fish have a mortality rate of 80%. I don't know how accurate this is, but the study was done in the USA and may have been in warmer water than we have in Northwestern Ontario in July. Most camp owners want you to have a GREAT time on your vacation and so do most of the locals you encounter. We make great friends every year on the lakes in the Province and we look forward to seeing you. Don't let the numberof fish you can possess limit your ablity to come and catch them and enjoy the outdoors away from home and worries"
