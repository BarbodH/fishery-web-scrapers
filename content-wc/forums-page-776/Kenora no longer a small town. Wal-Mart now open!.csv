545443,Guest,2005-01-30 13:35:00,0,How depressing. I loved Kenora because it was a small town. It helped to keep the undesirablesw away.
545446,Guest,2005-01-30 18:11:00,0,small town? kenora is the second largest town in northwest ontario. 17000 souls. dryden 10000. fort frances 9000. thunder bay is about half the population of nwo at about 120000. that leaves the rest of the area pretty sparce. i love it that way.
545451,Guest,2005-01-31 04:22:00,0,"Kenora is a nice town, but I think if you noticed there were already many undesirables stumbling down the streets before Walmart."
545463,Pooch,2005-01-31 18:24:00,4619,Wal-Mart eats up every small business in the area when they move in. There is nothing to celebrate when they come to town and clone the entire area. Every town looks the same. (Blue bags blowing against every fence) Pooch
545477,Guest,2005-02-01 11:47:00,0,Selkirk just open up a Walmart too.I believe that some other businesses benefit from having Walmart(except maybe those in direct competition).Many people from Selkirk and Kenora will drive to Winnipeg(or Dryden) to do their shopping and having a Walmart in town may keep them around.For a company that supposedly kills business they sure get businesses tripping over themselves to set up next to the Walmart.

Cough"
545483,Guest,2005-02-01 13:22:00,0,Now the Kenorans will have access to all the cheezy 3rd world pre-packaged hardware and plumbing fittings with cast diagonal lines that are supposed to resemble machined threads. Grrrr.
545484,Guest,2005-02-01 13:35:00,0,"Dude, apparently you need to 'lay some ore pipe' and get rid of some of that angst you have... >Now the Kenorans will have access to all the cheezy 3rd world >pre-packaged hardware and plumbing fittings with cast diagonal >lines that are supposed to resemble machined threads. >Grrrr. >"

When she quit she was making $13.85hr in custmer service. Now she is a RN. The reason people only make min $ there is because the only work for short time."
