Am looking for a place to take the family in July and thought this sounded pretty nice. Appears to be secluded yet just a short drive to Ear Falls. Am wondering about the cabins, size, cleanliness for a picky wife. Fishing on this trip I would be more concerned with numbers for Walleye and Perch. Thanks, Chris"

A co-worker goes with his son and a group of guys. Most of the group have been going for over 15 years. Sounds like the fish run a little small but good numbers (walleye). I've tried to get him to go to LOTW with our group but he likes Wenasaga. Guess it just depends on what you want from a trip. Marv"

The youngest, then 9 caught a walleye before he finished baiting the hook for the first time for another daughter. After landing the fish, he rebaited the hook for the youngest. She caught another fish before he got a chance to bait the hook for the other daughter. As I recall, the cabins are clean and are well stocked with utensils. The beds had a tendency to roll you to the middle-the ""come here dear"" springs. My sister-in-law doesn't fish, but enjoys the setting, the walks and reading on these trips. The oldest daughter on the trip, now married, is not a fisherperson but enjoyed kicking back and relaxing. Even though they caught fish and could have cleaned the fish for their meals, they didn't have too. They made friends with people in the neighboring cabins who gave them cleaned fillets (I think someone was concerned with being over the limit). Wenasaga River flows into the lake and there is an impressive set of falls where it enters the lake. I think the lake is big enough to be interesting but not so large as to get lost on."

The lake isn't large, has one resort and about a dozen private cabins owned/leased by residents mainly from Fort Dodge, Iowa. The resort owner doesn't care much for them and vice-versa. The private cabins are used heavily by hard-core fisherman who have a lot of hard-core fisherman friends. They keep a lot of pressure on the lake early in the season, but tends to wane as the year goes on. Have caught a lot of quality fish (17-21"") and have seen a lot of photo's of hogs in the spring...Wenasaga flows into Lac Seul...there are places to park your boat and fish below the falls from Wenasaga to Lac. Quality northerns are caught, not in huge numbers, but those who ""hunt"" them like muskies tend to be more successful. Haven't tried for perch there. If more interested in multi-species, I'd say Wabaskang, Cedar or Perrault...larger water to deal with though. Good Luck! Craig"
