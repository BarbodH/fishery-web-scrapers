545440,Guest,2005-01-30 12:06:00,0,"Hi to All! Has anyone used and or stayed with the folks at Loon Haunt Outfitters? They fly out of Red Lake, and have outposts on six different lakes - Goose,Whitelaw,Cherrington, Monroe,Unnamed, and Poireir. Have any of you fished these lakes, and what could I expect as far as fishing Walleyes and Northern for both Quality and quantity? Any and all help /input would be greatly appreciated regarding fishing and the accomodations and quality of gear at the outposts. Thank You!!! Mike - Indiana"

Since I'm at another lake that same time every year they gave my name to the owners and I get thier flyers every winter. I may try them someday just for a change of lakes. Loon Haunt on Goose flows into Mamakawash then into upper Goose (may be called lower Goose, I don't have the map near me) To get into Mamakawash I believe you have to portage a waterfall. But, they don't seem inclined to go to the hassel of a portage. (Guess that is an endorsment for the lake.) That is about all I can tell you about them. Did you look at thier website? Good luck.

One guy caught a 21 lb trout, this was in last week of May. Fished Dorothy Lake the next year, again got size and numbers of pike and walleyes,they no longer have this lake. The next year fished in Unnamed Lake ,again size and numbers. The cabins are all very nice Bill Coppen is a very good host and will take care of your needs. His lakes are all catch and release now I now go North of Armstrong to great fly-in lakes, but would have no problem going back to Loon Haunt again Larry S"
545465,Mike-Indiana,2005-01-31 20:21:00,4,"To both Larry S. and Pooch, Thank you both for your replies! I really appreciate the information. I am looking at Loon Haunt seriously as well as another outfitter called L&M. I have heard good things about these folks too. Again, thank you both! Mike - Indiana"
545466,Mike-Indiana,2005-01-31 20:43:00,4,"Hey Larry, Just got real curious...If it's not a secret, who do you fly in with out of Armstrong, and where do you go? Again, just trying to tilt the odds in my favor!:)))))))))) Thanks again, Mike - Indiana"
545468,Larry S,2005-02-01 07:24:00,666,"Hi Mike,The guys I use to go with got old and stopped going on fly-ins. After I transferred to Las Vegas in 1998 I hooked up with some new friends who go to Northern Outpostrs out of Armstrong The owners Kathy and Ryan Brady are part native and have access to many unfished lakes north of the Attawapiskat River System about 160 north of Armstrong They have 5 lakes,2 new ones this year. We are going to a brand new lake Black Birch on June 18th to 25th. Over the past years have had excellent fishing with size and numbers at the 3 other lakes. Two years ago I caught 4 pike myself over 40 inches. Last year due to colder weather fishing wasnt as good but still excellent as compared to many places .The cabins are all nice with showers,hot & cold water,fish cookers,barbacues,boats with seat backs. Plenty of water to fish and portage lakes with boats and motors If you are interested we still have room on the trip this June The web address is www.northernoutposts .com LarryS"
