545489,Guest,2005-02-01 18:01:00,0,From what I read in the Kenora paper it says that you can have 1 walleye over 27.5 inches. It seems that with such a small lower slot that people might be inclined to keep a big fish to eat. I sure hope that this is not the case. I would rather see being able to keep 1 fish say 20 to 22 inch and letting those bigger ones go back alive.

545514,Trailerguy,2005-02-02 13:52:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]A 20-22"" Walleye has a greater percentage of fertile eggs than a 27.5"" Walleye which is older an closer to the end of it's natural lifespan. The MNR sees the value in younger more viable fish to increase the populations."
545526,Guest,2005-02-03 09:34:00,0,I agree. I would always like to see someone eat a 28 incher and release 3- 22inchers instead!
