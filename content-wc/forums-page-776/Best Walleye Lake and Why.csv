545456,Guest,2005-01-31 07:15:00,0,I've been going to drive-in camps with my own boat to a different lakes all over Ontario each year for over 20 years. Lac Seul is by far the best walleye lake for an average joe fisherman with a family and a budget.
544924,Guest,2005-01-04 21:57:00,0,"Greer's Ferry Lake,Arkansas World record says about all you need to know"
544925,Guest,2005-01-04 23:00:00,0,didn't realize that arkansas was in canada
544931,Guest,2005-01-05 09:02:00,0,"asu72, Didnt I see that the record was a hoax and it was discredited. Seems the boy who caught it tried to tell a ""Whopper""."
544932,Guest,2005-01-05 10:01:00,0,"Where in Arkansas is that lake. Are there alot of walleye. Would this be an area to look at for retirement? If you would rather e-mail. [email protected]. I am looking for a retirement place in a warm climate, with walleyes!"
544943,Guest,2005-01-05 18:58:00,0,nope the one it replaced was the hoax. The greer's ferry 'eye was caught in the yearly tourney in feb. Walleyes are much overlooked around here.
544944,Guest,2005-01-05 19:03:00,0,the question was where was best lake-canada wasn't mentioned. of course i know that Greer's ferry isn't the best lake but is home to some whoppers and is way overlooked. Most days we only catch 15 or so and some days we don't get any bigger than 7-8 pounds. However 15-18 lbs do show up some times just not with me!!!
544997,Guest,2005-01-11 10:18:00,0,Rainy River walleye are big in the spring and fall. Just check www.walleyecup.com and see why....64.97lbs. for three day tournament at the GNWC in Baudette. These guys Sean and Dave fished Manitou for three days and come out with over 20lbs. per day from there. call me or email me for more info [email protected] or 807-482-1060
545001,Guest,2005-01-11 19:12:00,0,It would be pretty safe to say Lake Erie western basin (Colchester Harbour)for numbers and for the trophy's nothing can touch Bay of Quinte. Fish Hound...
545220,Guest,2005-01-19 19:52:00,0,Along with the excellent fisheries already mentioned I would like to add the Red River north of Lockport Manitoba in the late fall and early ice.
545222,Guest,2005-01-19 20:47:00,0,Arkansas Game and fish just shocked up one that would be new record and released her back into greer's ferry lake. Nobody around here walleye fishes. we aren't set up for it.(Even though it could come on a large minnow or a bass fisherman's crankbait.)I'd like to see what a walleye tourney full of good 'eye fishermen would turn up.
544550,Guest,2004-12-15 10:27:00,0,Maybe we will cross paths. If it's the same lake it's more like 3.5 hours.

544551,Troutbeck,2004-12-15 10:33:00,682,"Well, if it's three hours from the Sault, I want to know what it is...We're looking for a new lake this year. C'mon, spill the beans...please! Trout"

544683,Troutbeck,2004-12-19 05:23:00,682,Hey Jerry: Aren't you the guy from southwest Michigan? We've been going to Dog Lake by Wawa and HAVE to find another place. Good luck in May.
544696,jerry bark,2004-12-20 15:13:00,822,"yeah i live over by sturgis, if you want to go in may we might be able to fit you in if you'll bring a tent or camper. the cabins are all booked for may and june. lets meet up over at lunkers this week for dinner and i'll fill you in. cheers jerry[email protected]"
544714,Guest,2004-12-21 15:03:00,0,"Yep some good lakes up that way. But were're starting to see alot of Americans up that way. Won't be long before our lake is out. Until then, we'll enjoy the great fishing while it lasts. Lakes like this one won't hold up to tonnes of pressure. Espeacially the MONSTER pike. Some people come up and kill them to eat. I can't understand that being that you can catch all the 4-5lbers you want. I guess its and ego thing. They just move onto another lake. I haven't killed a pike over 40"" yet and there have been quite a few. Good thing for fish sanctuaries!!!"
544722,jerry bark,2004-12-21 19:32:00,822,"my first day on that lake i broke off a 40 inch class northern, would have left him there regardless, but then i had to buy a new bait..... I'm hoping the lock down on lodge construction on that lake saves the population for the future. cheers jerry"
544483,Guest,2004-12-10 10:17:00,0,Cmon experts give it up ...where and why.
544485,Guest,2004-12-10 10:56:00,0,Lac Seul. 100 walleyes a day. End of story.
544487,Guest,2004-12-10 12:02:00,0,"Lac Seul! That's an easy one. Proven trophy walleye fishing all the time. Bay of Quinte, sometimes for a short period in the spring, in early October, and especially just before the ice can be as good for big fish numbers, but you have too many people, city (lack of solitude), and more pollution. The all-around best walleye fishing experience (as determined by my criteria) is best possible on Lac Seul. Look at it this way . . . I play a lot of poker. If you're going to go somewhere with the basic goal of having the best walleye fishing experience possible, betting on Lac Seul is like having pocket Aces before the flop."
544492,bigfish1965,2004-12-10 19:44:00,3210,Lake Ontario...all that I'm going to say...okay..I'll also say 'One weekend 15 fish over ten pounds...two over 15 pounds..'
544514,Guest,2004-12-13 09:59:00,0,"For numbers, a northern ontario lake 200fish/day (14-18"") for size and number, Lake Erie hands down. Where else can you catch 20-50 fish/day and average 4-8lbs per fish?"
544515,Guest,2004-12-13 10:12:00,0,"We have been fishing Katachawaka for the last 5 years and each boat will catch 200++ walleye a day and we get more than our fair share of 8 to 10 lb walleye. It is a private lake owned by one of our vendors companys and we are their guests every year. They fly us in and they have great accomadations and food plus guides. We also fish Pike and have caught several 40"" ++ fish."
544519,Guest,2004-12-13 11:17:00,0,Sounds like my backyard!!!! I will go out on a limb and say that the best walleye fishing in the world is within 3 hours of my home. Not to metion some of the best pike fishing in the province!
