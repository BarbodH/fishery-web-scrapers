545450,Guest,2005-01-30 23:54:00,0,Hi. we have stayed at ear falls many years and always saw the sign for that place on the gravel road that the loggers use. One day when I had nothing to do I drove up that road a bit and holy mackeral what did i see coming up behind me real fast was one of those huge logging truck going 60 on a gravel road. the last thing i wanted was for him to pass me. I sped up and turned off at the first intersection. I would hate to think how many rocks I would have in my windshield if he had passed me!!!!!! I think woman lake is about 50 miles up that road. i dont think i could be lucky enough to not have a meeting with one of those both ways and my boat would be f##### and I would really be pissed. maybe by now they paved that road. good luck
