We plan on fishing a few day's on the canadian north arm for walleye and pike,then a couple days out of international falls for crappie.We were hoping someone could give a few pointers on where to find the walleye or northerns,what kind of structure they are using,and some tips on presentations. Any input would be greatly appreciated.Thanks"
