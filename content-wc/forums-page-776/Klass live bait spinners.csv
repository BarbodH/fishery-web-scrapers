545532,Guest,2005-02-03 14:33:00,0,I have purchased Klass Live Bait spinners in downtown Ear Falls the last few years and have had a lot of success. Anyone know if an online store sells them?
545540,Guest,2005-02-03 18:59:00,0,i think they are probably a little local supplier. you can make your own for about 1/2 what he charges.
