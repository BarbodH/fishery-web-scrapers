545337,jigman 2003,2005-01-24 06:15:00,981,"Wisconeye, we will be there the week after you. June 25 to July 2. Whay info. can you give me regarding fishing there? I have heard from Don and others that there is A LOT of wood. Is it that much different from fishing the flowages here in Wisconsin? ( I assume from your name you are located here too). Have you fished other lakes with MLO? How are does the fishing at Ogoki compare to their single cabin lakes? I assume that since you are going for a 4th year that the fishing must be good ;)"
545353,ONE TIME DAVE,2005-01-24 17:24:00,110,LOOK at Arctic Watershed Outposts out of Nakina. Have used them 10 time with GREAT success. Good fishing and low $$$$. Web is awonakina.com or call Christine for more info 807-329-5812. Have fished 4 different lakes and will do all I can to help you. Good fishing. Regards Dave Kean
545373,Guest,2005-01-25 14:27:00,0,Are you flying into Bellsmith? Didn't you fly in there last year?
545448,Wisconeye,2005-01-30 19:30:00,79,"Yep, there's a bit of wood ;) - Take a LOT of jigs. If you fish monofilament, you'll start believing in superline quickly up there. I spool up with FireLine for there just to save on the jigs lost. If you are flowage fisherman, you'll love Ogoki. There's some current, in fact a few minutes from the cabin are the falls- a place you'll fish a lot. I'll send you an email with more specific information. You'll be very pleased with your choice. I haven't fished their single cabin lakes so can't compare. I'll be in touch by email sometime this week."
545452,Guest,2005-01-31 06:09:00,0,Thanks for the input Wisconeye. Looking forward to your email!
545454,AL,2005-01-31 06:38:00,89,"Wisconsin Eye/ Jigman, Have either of you fished Auger Lake with Mattice Lake Outfitters? It is there most Northernly single cabin lake. I have fished Ogoki several times along with Weese Lake but am changing it up a little this year to something smaller. AL"
545458,Guest,2005-01-31 09:39:00,0,"No, I haven't fished Auger. I tried to get in there this year, but my week was booked. How did you do on Ogoki? Can you give me any ""hot"" tips? I have fished Pringle and Vick. I would imagine Auger is quite similar to those two. Good fishing on both, better pike on Vick, better walleye on Pringle."
545221,Guest,2005-01-19 20:35:00,0,"I have gone to drive to lakes in Canada, and I am looking for my first fly-in experience. I am looking for a walleye numbers lake. Any suggestions?"
545225,Guest,2005-01-19 22:55:00,0,"I have used L+M flyins 3 times and every time it was great. They have very nice cabins, good fishing, and fly their own planes, so we didn't have to wait around to fit into someone else's schedule."
545227,Guest,2005-01-20 05:51:00,0,"have been doing fly ins for 40 years.am presently flying out of armstrong and experiencing some of the best fishing ever on newly opened lakes.have prime week of june18-25 booked at new lake.have room for 4 persons on this trip.if of interest e-mail me at [email protected] and i will give you more info.thanks,tim"
545238,Guest,2005-01-20 11:54:00,0,ignace outposts - take a look at them - great service and nice folks
545253,Larry S,2005-01-20 19:01:00,666,"I second what Tim Jias said.I'm going with him this year to a brand new lake out of Armstrong. Fishing is great,have room for 4 more fishermen.Have gone the last two years to this outfitters lake.Anyone interested in a new adventure e-mail me at [email protected] or [email protected]"
545260,jigman 2003,2005-01-21 06:25:00,981,Mattice Lake Outfitters out of Armstrong. Excellent fishing and service. www.matticelake.com
545271,Guest,2005-01-21 11:13:00,0,"Jigman, have you or anyone else you know fished Bellsmith w/Mattice Lake Outfitters? I'm going this Summer and was looking for whatever info people might have. Thanks."
545273,jigman 2003,2005-01-21 12:22:00,981,"I haven't fished Bellsmith. Fished Pringle for 4 years and Vick one. Pringle is the better of the two, in my opinion. I am going to Ogoki Reservoir this June. Bellsmith is a catch and consume lake isn't it? I am too greedy to not take fish home, silly as that sounds. One day I hope to lose that attitude. Good luck at Bellsmith, let us know how you do."
545277,Guest,2005-01-21 20:03:00,0,"I've also used L&M for a number of years, they have excellent lakes, cabins, and equipment. Give them a cal and they'll give you what you want. They've always give us what we ask for. www.lmflyin.com Good luck"
545308,Wisconeye,2005-01-23 09:29:00,79,Jigman: What dates are you going to Ogoki? We'll be there June 18-25 for the fourth time.
