Fishing there was always very good. Its more of a numbers place, but there are some big ones too. Excellant fishing on the river close to camp. Fast moving water makes boat control tough. Bring alot of big jigs and hire little ED to guide for a day."

545387,Guest,2005-01-26 06:24:00,0,I've been to the Caribou Falls Landing at Haley's Camp above the dam and would highly recommend it if you can get in. We pass by the Caribou falls camp at Tetu lake on the way to our camp. A lot of numbers with quite a few fish between 25-29. Camp is pretty nice and they have two others on the lake. One boat in and one fly in. It's a large area. The boat in and fly-in might be your best bet as the drive to camp is usually booked.
