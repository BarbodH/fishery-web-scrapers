545334,Guest,2005-01-23 23:54:00,0,"Hi. It ooks like the only people beiing regulated are the american tourist/sportsmen. Yes keep our limits down so the commercial folks can catch all they want. i looked at the othere web site, boy was I mistaken its more like millions of pounds of fish a year. Hey have they taken away your guns yet? I heard they were working on that."
545335,Guest,2005-01-24 03:51:00,0,"Sadly, I can't argue with anything you said and yes they are still working on it, maybe once another 2 billion is spent on the ""gun registry"", they'll finally get it right."
545336,Guest,2005-01-24 06:05:00,0,"On thing about all of this is that the majority of the walleye are shipped to U.S. distributers, which end up in your stores and restaurants. Maybe you can help by deciding whether you want to come up and catch them while enjoying the outdoors or do you want to eat them out of a supermarket? Obviously the lakes can't handle both. If there were no demand, there would be no need to gill net. Our site lists True World Foods as having been spotted loading up walleye, how many of you have contacted them?"
545356,Guest,2005-01-24 19:27:00,0,"Concerned, You make some very valid points. The two can exist but the fact is there is a market for Commercial fish and people also buy illegally harvested fish. The large lakes are hard to regulate and gill netting probably does hurt the pike/musky population. The lakes I was speaking of had no musky population and a small pike population. The rough fish were suckers and whitefish. This is a difficult problem to address.."
545385,Guest,2005-01-25 23:43:00,0,Hi again. the have fish farms down here in the states cant they do the same thing in canada for their commercial customers? Just a thought.
545396,willywalleye35,2005-01-26 18:29:00,2,"you are the only ones being regulated?yes we purposely limit the number of fish you can keep so that commercial fishing operations can have the balance.what happened to the fish in your home state?overharvesting,pollution,habitat destruction ?i wont speculate because not knowing doesn't give me the authority to elaborate on something i know nothing about.yes we have some stupid gun laws that do nothing to protect the people it was meant to.but our problem is illegal handguns that come from the u.s.what do handguns have to do with the commercial harvest of fish?this section should be called canada bashing eh!"
545400,Guest,2005-01-27 05:10:00,0,"I do not understand why some of these guys seem to have the need to take fish home. They just don't seem to understand that would make some impact on the fishery. Yes it is to bad that the netting can not regulated. This problem seems to be similar to our welfare programs that seem to only increase the population of the users of it and not end the cycle. Most US people ackknowledge there is a problem but goverment does not have the guts to legislate reform. I as an American sportsman feel for your plight with gun control and hope for your sake it will eventually go away. As far as the handguns go, yes they probably do come from us and I still feel the solution to that problem is to let everyone have the right to carry, that might discourage some criminal activity. Finally, I feel you have a great country and feel privileged to be able to come to Canada and will abide by whatever rules Canada deems fit. Thanks for letting us visit. Steve Riggins"
545434,Guest,2005-01-30 06:02:00,0,"I sent an email to True World Foods in Chicago but did not receive a reply, anyone else contact them without receiving a reply, guess I will send another email and keep doing it in hopes of getting a reply. Maybe we should be talking to resturant owners who advertize Canadian walleye as well."
545471,Guest,2005-02-01 08:31:00,0,"Well to me it seems that the issue is really centered around the government and them deciding what the law will be for the people. Quite possibly they are representing a minority in this situation as happens many times in the States. Just because a court makes a ruling, does not mean it is right, courts in the states (the Supreme Court) are supposed to be subordinate to the two other divisions of government. But in the States, our Supreme Courts are out of control and actually effecting and making legislation. Could the same thing be happening in Canada. Courts don't care about tourism. All it takes is some people who have hardened hearts and judicial power to make the whole system go astray. And the LOTW was doing so well up until the netting hit."
545213,Guest,2005-01-19 18:59:00,0,"I thought the slot limits and possesion limits were working. Approx. 4 yrs ago on a trip we had hard time catching eyes under 18"". Ever since then size has seemed to go way down hill! I spend approx. 20 days or so fishing the Sioux Narrows area. The only problem I have is getting enough fish to feed my family as only allowed 2 a day and my 4yr old can't get a liscense yet! How about you Totem guides have you noticed an effect from netting? However our gang did manage 2-28.5""ers. Dennis"
545233,Guest,2005-01-20 10:31:00,0,"Hi. We have been going to LOTW for the last 5 years now and it seems the only place to find walleyes are out at yellow girl bay and further. we see a lot of totem boats out there too. thats about a 40 minute ride. a long way to go for 2 fish each in pocession. Its really hard for me to believe that netting has no impact. I think every fish taken has an impact. I think a read that netting takes out somithing like 50,000 pounds or more of walleye a years and to me that translates to a lot of fish. that means less chance of you catching any. I think it SUCKS. I know some people will say I dont have to come back and one of these days I wont along with a lot of others. its a hard habit to break."
545240,Guest,2005-01-20 12:40:00,0,You might want to consider staying further south on the lake in the nestor falls area. Sabaskong bay always kicks out walleyes. The water is consistently dingier that whitefish bay. As well some of the smaller bays in the sioux narrows area including lobstick bay produce walleyes. -Davis
545270,Guest,2005-01-21 11:11:00,0,We have lots of walleyes around Morson on the south end of Lake of the Woods but unfortunately netting also.
545275,Guest,2005-01-21 17:03:00,0,"Here's a great site with all the latest info on the increasing problem with netting in the area. Beware, the pictures are not for the faint of heart!http://members.shaw.ca/msfa"
545284,Guest,2005-01-22 06:46:00,0,"Great site concerned!! A few years back I ran into some ""locals"" who bragged to us about the fish they had gotten that day in their beat up old boat and of course we had nice new ones and could only keep 2 eyes. They admitted they were trapping them (big eyes!)illegally although they did have tags to trap some. I imagine as long as they are not bothered they trap all they can and if they are stopped and check them fish then become part of their eligible # under their tag! I find it amazing the way they want to restrict my limits which are good to a point and then they turn around and let the entire lake get rapped anyways! Kind of like that here in Wisconsin. Since spearing started our bag limits have dropped and some lakes actually close eye fishing altogether depending on the spearing #'s. Our govn't says that the spearing has no effect on the fishery!! Dennis"
545289,Guest,2005-01-22 10:31:00,0,"I hear you! I'm very aware of the ""issues"" in Wisconsin and elsewhere. What I don't want to happen here is that this problem becomes a dirty little secret like it has in so many other places. This is going to be out there so everyone can see the real reasons why reduced sport fishing limits are being put into place on the Winnipeg River. As well as document the reasons for the reduced quality of the Lake of the Woods fishery, as many suspect will no doubt become reality once the nets have strained every last fish from the water column! Just so no one thinks that we are targeting one ""user group"" we will be keeping an eye on all offenders. In particular a resort who allegedly likes to fish walleye in the CLOSED Shoal Lake portion of the Lake of the Woods system. This is another area where complaints complete with GPS co-ordinates of the offending boats were not investigated by the OMNR. Also ""pike"" fisherman targeting pre-season muskies, this is the year to stop doing it! We have volunteers from every sector of the lake who are keeping a close eye on things. We fully realize that the concervation officers are doing what they can with what they are given and fully support their efforts. Budget cuts and politics are where the problems lie in all of these situations. If we do not have enough officers to patrol the lake and officers being held back by higher ups, obviously a need exists for a ""grassroots"" approach to fully document, photograph and video tape everything and then report it. Maybe then we can put on enough heat to our politicians to make the NECESSARY changes to protect the resource for all."
545297,rtmg,2005-01-22 20:31:00,34,I couldn't honestly make a fair judgement. It was my first year fishing that part of LOW. I am however saddened by the pictures of them fish rotting in the net. Good Fishen Rob
545307,Guest,2005-01-23 09:12:00,0,"This seems to be a discussion over who can keep more fish the commercial fisherman or the non resident fisherman. When I reviewed the data posted about harvest amount it seems like more than 50% of the total harvest for LOTW is for Non resident anglers. One should be able to have a meal with 2 walleye per person. I'm not saying that netting is a good thing for LOTW but if managed properly commercial harvest can benifit a lake. I have seen remote lakes that have been commercially harvested for 20 - 30 years and have held good walleye populations, these lakes then became accessable to sport fishing (very good fishing) and within a few years you couldn't catch a walleye (this was all done from ice fishing pressure). In this case, when you think that two hundred anglers go out for the day and bring home their 6 walleye (that was the limit) average 2 lbs that could be a possible 1200 fish @ 2lbs. If this happens for 10 - 12 weeks that's a lot of walleye. Where as the commercial fisherman was netting and rough fish were caught along with walleye therefore the harvest was more non selective and more restictive (only allowed their quota). Which is better for the lake?? The trick is managing both groups and how do you account for illegal activity?? This is a difficult task with a lake of this size, crossing a border and having so many user groups..."
545310,Guest,2005-01-23 10:10:00,0,"I agree that both user groups could probably co-exist provided they were ""managed"". The problem I see right off the top is when persons report nets full of rotting fish, illegal fish sales to the OMNR and they are not investigated. Add to that, reports of resort boats poaching in Shoal Lake not being investigated, you can't tell me that anyone has a handle on what really is being harvested from the lake. I suspect everything in the harvest report is out of whack, from percentages for user groups to total pounds of fish. They don't even have enough in the budget to afford gas to patrol the whole lake! None of this looks good for the future! Also you mention ""rough"" fish, one fish that is completely off the harvest report is muskellunge. Why? Because muskellunge have a 54 inch limit which basically means all are supposed to be released. These fish are very fragile and as a result these limits were put in place to protect the LOTW trophy muskie population. Do you think the nets discriminate which species it kills? As a muskie angler the pictures are disturbing to say the least, it seems like there are more pike and muskie in the nets than walleye. I have reports of piles of dead muskie and pike left in the woods or trails of them thrown from the back of boats for the gulls and pelicans while the ""desirable"" species are taken. Just another issue that must be addressed!"
