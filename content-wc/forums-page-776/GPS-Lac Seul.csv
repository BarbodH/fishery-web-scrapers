545422,Guest,2005-01-28 12:46:00,0,"Hi- I was considering upgrading to a GPS with the map background capabilities (shows the lake you are on). I was wondering if there is this technology for Lac Seul? We fish the northeast section, and would be only interested in the new GPS if this was a possibility? I have seen these maps for the U.S. lakes, but can't say I have for Canada, and Lac Seul specifically?? Any information would be greatly appreciated! Thanks"
545424,Guest,2005-01-28 14:40:00,0,I have a lowrance X-15 and bought the map chip for Northern Ontario. It is great I have used Garmin products as well and they seem similar so either will work. There are only topo maps available no depth maps but the detail on the Lowrance is great. I fish Lac and would recommend it.
545431,Guest,2005-01-29 13:06:00,0,"fishing hot spots--The maps I use, an into legal problems with Canada's government as to using Canada's data on hot spot products. So as of now no product will be avalible for our units. Anybody know different--please post, as I'd love to get my hands on a good map of Lac Seul to use in my Lowrance. Other than that Any GPS would be a help on as big a lake as LS is."

545438,Guest,2005-01-30 10:57:00,0,"I have the Ontario freedom topo map. I works great for land travel it has great lake shoreline detail and shows island. One thing I leard the hard way the freedom map cards are about $145us for one card, now they have Canada CD for $79us and you can make up to 5 cards from. I used mine hunting in Ifinder then had to take out card and put in LMS330 color in truck when driving. Lowrance had big legal stuff to go through to get map info from canada, That is the same thing is going on with lake depth info too. Plus there isnt alot of good maps of canada lakes most just have depth numbers not contor lines. All in all map card works great. Brian[email protected]"
545461,Guest,2005-01-31 17:55:00,0,"I have also been looking for a gps that has detail of lac seul for sometime now. The other day I came across a gps and software sold by magellan that appears to offer quite a bit of detail, including a fairly detailed shoreline, small islands, and a ton of marked under water rock piles. You are able to view the software on the magellan website. The address to take you right to it is: http://www.magellangps.com/en/produc..._topo&load=yes Under location select ontario, then pick hydrography under search type, and then in the search string type in lac seul. Center in on where you are interested in and if you zoom all the way areas with under water hazards will be marked with a pirates flag symbol. Even if you are not interested in the gps it probably would not hurt to make note of some the hazards(there is a bunch of them in the northest section). The software is called mapsend topo canada. I don't think it has water depths though. Also, I don't believe magellan is in the depth finder business so the gps you would need to buy in order to use the software would be a handheld unit. They make a color unit for $325 and the software i found somewhere else (can't remember where) for $75. So $400 will get you a handheld color gps with a fairly detailed map of lac seul."

For example, I have a small cabin in Northern Manitoba, and it tells me the cabin is 1km out in the lake. Does not show the islands. There is little or no detail with creeks/rivers/bays on my lake. I made a call to customer service and they politely told me ""too bad for you"" Oh yes - it is their 2004 release. I have seen Garmins software, and it is very precise - but again no depths on my lake, but available to LOTW area. Shorelines match almost perfect judging by coordinates, and the bays are on there. Cant say for LS, but I am sure the Garmin will be close. You can see their maps online too. I do know that I will be going with them next time I buy a GPS chrism"
