Every time I open the Cabela's Catalog, or Bass Pro, I see all of these specialty jigs that cost ten times the price of a simple roundball jig being sold. Anyone feel they get more success from any specialty jig? What is the best out there that work and are not gimmicks to make us spend more money."

For all around use, the traditional roundhead is a good choice. About two years ago I changed over all of my roundheads to football heads and ""tip-up"" heads (like the Northland lipstick jig). In my opinion these two designs are the best out there for walleye fishing. You get much better ""feel"" with the football head due to a wider head, and they are far more snag resistant than a roundhead. The tip-up jig is unbelivably snag resistant, and fishes a little ""heavier"" than a roundhead. I go through 100's of livebait head jigs each year, this is a roundhead without the barb for holding a plastic tail. I also go through 100's of shortshank jigs. Flatheads are quite popular with guys fishing the Mississipi and Wisconsin rivers in high current areas. You can use a 1/4 oz. instead of 3/8 oz. with this type head because it cuts current so well. I charge the same amount for all the different head types I sell. The reason for the increased cost of these jigs at most major retailers is simple supply and demand. Everybody buys roundheads, lots of manufacturers make them, competition drives price down. Just the opposite with the others. Hope this helped a little."

I have had the best results with this head in boulder infested waters as far as not getting snagged/ getting unsnagged using this head style. Although the hook eye is positioned in the front of the head and works well for casting-retrieving, a little work with a drill press and bit can be done to add another hook position further back so the jig can be fished vertically and hang ""straight"". It goes through weeds better with the original position though. Good luck"
