1221408,jake6767,2010-07-21 22:32:00,42,Thanks for the info. Any specific areas we should try? Never been on the lake so dont have any idea as where to try.Jeremy

1221768,Jatar,2010-07-23 07:37:00,169,"We have done this trip several times, I have caught large northerns in Micrometer bay, walleyes and smallmouth around little rope island, humps can be very productive as well, also, I have had a lot of success using slip bobbers w/leeches and minnows in weedy bays this time of the year. Be sure to keep the houseboat on the main boating channels, it's not a lot of fun if you get grounded. A pair of binoculars is very useful for identifying the buoy number for navigation."
