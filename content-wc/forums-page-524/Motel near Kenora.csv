Any suggestions of cheap motels on that highway near Kenora?? Looking at Google maps its about the same distance for us coming from Kansas anyway. Any help would be great. Thanks, Joe"
1221080,WalleyeWally28,2010-07-20 19:39:00,298,We always stay at the Super 8 in Kenora on our way to Lac Seul. There is a restaurant and bar right across the parking lot and plenty of boat parking available.
1221088,Aaron-IN,2010-07-20 20:13:00,500,"There isn't anything right on the highway, you will need to go into Kenora."
1221118,Pat,2010-07-20 22:06:00,203,"A second on the Super 8 in Kenora, reasonable rates. The restuarant/bar is Caseys right across the parking lot. Take the by-pass that goes north of Kenora to the 658 (I think that's the highway number) stop light. Turn left at the light and go into Kenora and continue under the railroad bridge, then turn right and head out past the hospital and the Super 8 will be on your right."
1221476,aggie kolisnik,2010-07-22 09:12:00,39,Hi! I called around and it seems the only place that might accomodate anyone wil;l be on a weekday is the Travel lodge 468-3155(807) the super 8 (468-8016)has only suites lrft for next weekend. I hope this helps
1221561,Skyraptor,2010-07-22 14:24:00,291,What are the rates that you paid for Travel lodge?
1221562,aggie kolisnik,2010-07-22 14:28:00,39,"I don't rent there, I own my own tourist camp on Lake of the Woods. I was just asking about the availability as I live here in Kenora. I happen to know how busy all the hotels/motels get at this time of the year. A.K."
1221702,joeman79,2010-07-22 23:09:00,417,we decided to stay at Int'l Falls. Prices nearly half of what was available in Kenora. More Beer money that way. Will take our chances on 502. Thanks for all your help anyways. Joe
1221760,Bill Krejca,2010-07-23 07:26:00,6107,"Joe, Maybe the lady would rent you a spot at her camp overnight. I don't have any connection with her, but it just came to mind. Good luck, catch lots of fish! Bill Krejca"
1221870,aggie kolisnik,2010-07-23 14:35:00,39,"sorry,Bill, but that sounds like a good plan, but we are not close to what he wants. We are very reasonable, but we are at the other end of Lake of the Woods(towards morson area) I just live in Kenora and fly down or boat every sat morning to clean the place and do changover of the guests. If ever in the neighborhood, drop by. We are in saboshkoshing bay(across from the old McPherson camp that was owned by flag Island. take care"
