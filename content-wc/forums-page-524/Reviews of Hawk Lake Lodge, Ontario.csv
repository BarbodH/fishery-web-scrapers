1219847,Fish Colorado,2010-07-16 15:21:00,3,I'm wondering if anyone has been to Hawk Lake Lodge in Ontario? My Dad and I are thinking of taking a trip there. Thanks.

Just do a quick search for some intel on this lodge.As an aside I have been there many times and can't speak more highly of the lodge. Shoot me an email [email protected] and I would be happy to fill you in on anything you want to know.I am actually heading up there next weekend with the family. Can't wait.
