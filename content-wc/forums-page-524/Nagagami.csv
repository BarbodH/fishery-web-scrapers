Any good info welcome thanks again"

Most of these have been to the Longlac area but have, also, been to the Nakina area and Lac Seul. The last 2 years, we have gone to Expeditions North on Lake Nagagami. The number of quality fish on Nagagami is fantastic. This year my trip was cut short by a family emergency but in my 3 days of fishing I caught 3 walleye over 26 inches. On my last night of fishing I caught 17 walleye(15 of which were over 21 inches). For quality fish, you can't go wrong with Nagagami and for a quality camp, you can't go wrong with Expeditions North."
