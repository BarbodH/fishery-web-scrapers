1220555,Seanik,2010-07-19 08:18:00,218,"This our first trip to Lake Nagagami was one of the best in over 30 years of going North to Canada. The Walleye fishing was outstanding with 50+ fish each morning, 2 persons in a boat. The limit on Nagagami is 4 walleyes with 1 allowed over 18"", we had difficulty catching 17"" dinner walleyes, most were 20""-22"" and our biggest was 26 3/4"". I landed and released a 42"" Pike while walleye fishing and caught a few smaller ones during the week. The lodge and service was great, 16"" boats with electric start 15hp motors and new 20hp replacements were being flown in when we left. Clean comfortable cabins, our boats were bailed out each morning and dried off if it rained the previous night by 2 lodge workers who kept us gassed up and supplied with minnows. Everything in the tackle box caught fish with the most productive being a nightcrawler on a colorado bladed worm harness, green or pink. We have booked the same week for 2011. The only negative aspect of the entire trip was the Centre Inn Motel where we stayed the night before flying in. It was hot and their air conditioning was not working and didn't work all year as we later found out. This place is run down and has been on the verge of closing for a couple of years. We will overnight in White River next year about an hour away from the float plan base. I recommend Lake Nagagami. Seanik"

Wish I hadn't, but that's how it goes sometimes.Anyway, we stayed in White River at Continental Motel and Dining Lounge the night before we flew out. I'd recommend it. Was spacious, reasonably priced, clean and even had a full kitchen (maybe that's normal, but a first for me). There are only 2 motels in the town, but I never stayed at the other one - White River Lodge."

1220788,polaris-pete,2010-07-19 20:51:00,343,Seanick- I sent you a PM alittle while ago. Hows the perch fishing in Erie doing?
1220879,Seanik,2010-07-20 08:21:00,218,"Hi Phish, We were at Expeditions North, they have 6 cabins, there were about 20 people there 7/9-7/16. Lake Nagagami is big enough(27,000 acres) for everyone to spread out. We had our best fishing on a reef about 3 miles Northeast of the camp and at times there were 4 or 5 other boats in the area. This reef is in excess of a 1/2 mile in diameter so there is room for everyone. There are 3 lodges on Lake Nagagami, Pullens at the North end, Waltons Kay Vee at the Southwest end and Exped. North on the West central shore. The housekeeping plan cost is with-in 50.00 for all three lodges. I have only been to Expeditions North Lodge on Lake Nagagami and went there on the recommendations of Walleye Central posters and they were 100% right, it's the best run lodge I have ever been too, along with the fantastic fishing. Waltons Kay Vee Lodge looks ok and was recommended by a salesman at Cabales in Dundee, Mi on the way home. I didn't get up to Pullens and look over their camp, but their camp boats are 18' ceder strip boats and I heard from someone that they leak a bit. I hope the above information is of assistance Seanik"
1221059,Ruddiger,2010-07-20 18:02:00,649,"Howdy, I have been fishing this lake since 1995 and have had the pleasure of staying at all of the active lodges on the lake at one time or the other. Of the three, I can tell you that Expeditions-North is, by far, the best operation on the lake. This is by no means a slam on the other operators as they are all nice. More so, however, it's a case of Expeditions-North being so good that all of the other camps pale by comparison (not unlike comparing Sofia Loren to Sandra Locke and Katharine Ross…sure they’re hot but seriously….). Feel free to research my posts, as well as other posts on the lodge, to confirm what I just stated. Take care, Ruddiger"
1222290,Mich_Fisherman,2010-07-25 19:08:00,292,Seanik Glad it worked out for you...this is an amazing fishery and lodge for sure. I can't wait until next year..... 48 weeks and counting!!
