1222071,lenray,2010-07-24 15:33:00,467,Been doing drive ins for 25 plus years. Always very remote water where we use quads canoes and portage from lake to lake to river etc. Never see other fishermen and have very decent fishing. We are tent campers and are use to difficult camping situations and also enjoy that. One area I fish is north of the village of Pickle Lake--1200 mile one way trip. Not afraid to drive miles. Also fish remote water north of Terrace Bay where we use quads and canoes to work our way back into good water. So you see what kind of a fisherguy I am. I am also 65 and it takes a lot of preperation to do these trips. I go up 3-4 times per year. Thinking maybe a FLYIN would make a good trip for one of my trips. Just toss a few things in the MKZ and have a nice drive up into ONTARIO. Want a decent boat and motor. Only cabin on a lake. Don't need a huge lake maybe 1/2 mile wide 3-8 miles long with live water coming in in a few places. Not a fancy cabin. Doesn't matter how far I have to drive to get to plane. Looking for eyes and pike. What am I looking at as far as cost and where would be a few good places to go???? Thanks for any help. Also only 2 guys and maybe 3 at the most.

1222197,@Lunker,2010-07-25 10:31:00,835,You can check this out. I've used Mike in the past and thought very highly of his operation and the fishing opportunities.http://www.pfo.net/web.php
1222201,phishfearme,2010-07-25 10:54:00,1242,"WOW! this is really the end of an era! lenray is no longer doing his ultra-roughing it fishing trips. well, len, if you want to stay in and around the pickle lake area, you pretty much have pickle lake outposts (pete johnson) and north of 51 (dwight and karen monck) to pick from. i've used both and they're both excellent outfitters. DO NOT however expect the type of fishing you get on your roughing-it trips. even flyin lakes are impacted by the fishing pressure of a cabin or two on the lake. example; we were the first group for many years into north of 51's wetlauffer lake and the first 4-5 days of the trip were incredibly effortless to catch all you want (numerous 100 walleye per day per person) then as the week progressed it got progessively tougher. don't get me wrong - the fishing was still wonderful but not like the first few days. i think you know what i mean here since you've been to a truely untouched lake before. pete johnson also outfits tent camps/canoe trips on true untouched lakes - you may want to explore that option with him. also, get ready to shell out some bucks - these flyin trips have gotten very expensive - but compared to what you've been doing, they'll be luxurious. good luck phish"
