1218244,stardaddyed,2010-07-12 08:53:00,20,"Hey all,The first trip to Canada for fishing is just 3 weeks away! I am getting serious fishing fever! I am bringing the whole fam damily (wife and 3 15 year old boys) and they are getting about as excited as I am.As preparation to the questions I have to say that I am a novice fisherman. I am interested in volumes of fish not specific species or sizes. Just fun stuff.I am petrified about two things: Not bringing the right stuff with me. I have enough rods and reels (and the correct equipment as recommended). Not having been walleye/pike fishing I hope I know what to bring. I have an assortment of 1/4 jigs, mepps spinners, and medium rapala's. These are what has been recommended from the lodge we are going to. What else should I have? Spoons? Plastic worms? Also I have NO experience trolling.Expectations. Everyone tells me I will catch a ton of fish. To me a ton is more 10 or 15 per day. Everyone says that as long as I am not picky (i.e. only +50"" musky or only big walleye) I will catch way more than that. I want to set my expectations correctly. I would love to catch 1 musky (I don't care how small) just to say I caught one.Any help or recommendations would be helpful. Any specific web sites that anyone trusts for accurate info would also be appreciated.Thanks all.Ed"
1218257,Guest,2010-07-12 09:25:00,0,"Hi Relax and don't sweat the bait. We as fishermen make it a bigger deal than it really has to be. Below is what we use but also ask your camp owner and others in camp and I am sure they will help. Walleyes: Jig/minnow. Simple as that. We typically fish them in Weeds, either along the edges or pitching them in the holes. You will be surprised how close you can get. Bass,Northern & Muskies(as well as occasional walleyes) we use rattletrap type baits and year in/out crawdad type colors or perch type colors(Gold). We use them in 1/4-1/2 & 3/4 oz. Spinnerbaits in white or chartruese with hammered nickel blades fished around the weedbeds. We also use these in 1/4-1/2oz sizes and we use single blades but tandems will work too and we also attach a 3"" grub trailer in white/chartruese. Crankbaits like rapalas or Normans in perch or crawdad color We throw all of this on either spinning rods with 8lb mono or baitcasting with 10-12lb mono. Personally we do not use leaders and yes you will get bitten off a few times but I am just not comfortable using them. The main reason we use the baits above is they will catch all species and they are easy for kids to use. Use the spinnerbaits/rattletraps around weedbeds. We catch a few muskies each trip by accident using the above baits(up to 49""). If you stay around the weeds/broken rock you will catch fish. We have never had much luck on the large slab/bluff type banks. Once you catch a few try and find similar type cover."
1218316,jsmyers,2010-07-12 12:37:00,198,"Is this the Eagle Lake near Vermilion Bay?I used to fish Wabaskang north of there a ~100 km, and I'd have to agree with the advice given. Except that I feel that when using lures like spinners or rapalas, that a wire leader is necessary. The lures are too expensive to loose constantly when catching pike. You won't catch fewer pike, and they never seemed to effect other species much either. I'd go with black leaders, as they seems slightly less visible.A meps #4 is the most versatile lure you can have for numbers of fish. Put a bit of crawler on it and keep it near the bottom for perch and walleyes (especially in low light conditions for walleyes). Over the weeds for numbers of pike, try near wood cover for bass."
1218396,Guest,2010-07-12 17:37:00,0,"The Summer pattern for Walleyes is often the mid lake humps. Find those humps and watch your sonar for fish. Toss a marker in the water and fish around that spot until you begin catching fish. If you have no takers in 15 minutes, move to another location. Eagle Lake is huge, and it is also a tremendous walleye factory. Good luck."
1218417,tackleman,2010-07-12 18:40:00,444,"What part of Eagle Lake are you staying on, it is a huge lake.If you are up around the west arm, try the reefs, I've caught big walleye and big muskies on them. Have fun and enjoy the scenery, Eagle is a spectacular lakeAlso since this is your first trip get a guide for a day, they are alittle expensive down there but they can teach you the spots that should keep you in fish for your stay. Failing that, get the lodge owner to mark up a map for you of some good spots, they are usually more than willing to ensure your stay is great."
1218542,mms3rd,2010-07-13 07:26:00,148,"It is important to know where you might be staying/fishing....the Lake is huge if we are talking about the BIG Eagle sw of Dryden.I usually prefer smaller lakes so I can better cover the water, but my son and I went to Eagle 2 years ago and fished Osborne and Nevin Bays....we do lots of fishing....walleyes, northerns and bass...but my son caught a 45 inch muskie his 2nd day ever in Canada...we were fishing for smallmouth at the time with topwater.My son loves his crankbaits and big spinner baits. I have branched out over the years, but I still think a small red/orange/charteuse spinner with minnows or nightcrawlers and jigs tipped with same work well.....personally, I don't think you need to be too exotic....many on this board will have far more experience than I do.Mike"
1218607,Muskie Bob,2010-07-13 10:19:00,45,"If you are mainly after walleye and small mouth bass, you probably won't need a large net. However, if you think you might catch a large northern or muskie, you may want to consider buying a larger net. Not saying you can't land a large muskie using a small net, but I found out many years ago that a large net makes it a lot easier to land larger fish. Perhaps your resort will have a net you can borrow.The most important thing on fishing Eagle Lake is safety. Since you are from Kansas, you may look at a map and think it is safe to go anywhere on the lake as long as you stay a distance from shore.......oops, that may or may not be true. Be sure your lodge or resort provides you with a marked map showing routes to travel, as well as, dangerous locations like shallow reefs. If your see any jug or marker, please be concerned with the area. Always make sure you know where you are located. The islands and reefs on the map are sometimes confusing. If you get confused, shut it down.Good luck."
1218640,rather-be-fishin,2010-07-13 11:59:00,429,"I second the suggestion of getting a guide for one day. They will show you current fishing patterns and safe travel routes on the lake. Also, GPS is highly recommended with a lake map chip....will help ensure safe travels and marking fishing spots. Have a great trip that is a beautiful area to fish! 18 more days and counting down to our trip to awesome Lac Seul! rather-be-fishin"
1218680,Bob_Loblaw,2010-07-13 13:56:00,109,"I would HIGHLY recommend that you buy a rubber net. It saves you TONS of time and hassle untangling line, hooks, and fish from the net - which means more time actually fishing! And you don't have to worry about missing a big fish because of it - I've netted 40"" pike with mine without any trouble at all...you'll be amazed at how much they expand. Other than that, the above advice is solid. Jig+minnow and a few raps/spinners and you're good to go. Enjoy the trip!"
1218975,tv4fish,2010-07-14 08:40:00,2694,"Hi Ed: The number of fish you catch ""per day"" is going to depend on a few things-- how long is your ""day of fishing"" - 4 hours or 12? The weather WILL have an effect on how the fish are biting. Your catching ability will also. Bottom line -- don't set your sights too high. BUT- IF you put in a long day of fishing, weather conditions are good and the fish ARE biting - I see no reason why you can't catch 50 per day. My group has done that more than once (BTW - we DO keep track - I have ""lap counters"" on my boat for walleye count - 1 for ""under slot"", 1 for ""in slot"" and 1 for ""over slot""). Good luck and have a great time! OH --- Make sure you have plenty of bait !!!!"
1218988,Guest,2010-07-14 09:20:00,0,"I would also suggest a couple things that I am certain you already have thought of but in regards to the GPS I keep an extra set of batteries in the boat in case the unit is left on and I also manually write down the coordinates of the resort dock and put it on a plasticized card or in a ziplock bag. LOTW, where we go, we were told that once you get a mile from Camp that every island looks alike(or even fog)...its true. Don't be afraid to explore and trust your GPS but to tell you the truth we rarely had to go more than a few miles from camp to catch lots of fish. Expectations...million dollar question but for us we typically fish 3-5hrs in the morning and about the same in the evening and we are not considered hard-core fishermen and I would guess that we realistically average 15-20 in the morning and evening. We don't count/care and we just fish for what is biting. We have always kept it simple and used very similar baits we use at home so we don't break the bank and we always ended up throwing confidence baits anyway. My dad told me once that if you took the baits you actually used in Canada you could put them all in your hat but we carry these huge tackle boxes. Make sure you keep your camera with you at all times because over time we have some great shots of Eagles,bears,Moose and even a wolf. Walleye Central state law also requires you post a report upon your return."
1219099,Guest,2010-07-14 13:11:00,0,"I think thompmd has the right suggestion for you. Eagle Lake is HUGE and without a compass or good GPS you will find that everything looks the same. I was on Eagle Lake in June near Temple Bay , in early evening when my trusty GPS showed a low battery icon and the screen began getting dim. ( I did not have extra batteries) I was able to get my wife and myself back before nightfall by dead reckoning, but in the future I will always have extra batteries with me. Plus a good map and compass will always be with me as well."
1219155,Guest,2010-07-14 16:44:00,0,"Just got back from Eagle... the walleyes were moving more to the rocks, not so much in the weeds. Find some of the reefs or humps and use sonar to find the fish. We caught them anywhere from 12' on top of the reefs down to 32' on the edges. When they were on the tops, we would pitch a plain lead jig with minnow or leech. The deeper, they were, they liked lindy rig with about 2-6' fluoro leader-minnow or leech. You want to use the biggest minnow you can find (4-6"" if you can get em). Like was said before, if you are spotting them and they aren't biting, change something. If no luck after 20-30 min, move and find some active fish. Come back after a period of time and try em again. Look for a jug and back troll around it and try to mark fish, if you see em, fish em. You don't need to break the bank fishing walleyes there. its the simpliest fishing there is-rigging and jigging."
1221815,Cornbread,2010-07-23 10:33:00,2,"Ed- Good day my friend! Just returned myself from my 7th eagle lake trip. What a great trip (must be if I keep coming back). So here's a few things to remember from a guy who's done it a time or two. I stay at Temple Bay, and it sounds like you're up in the NW side. Here's a few tips- If you want to burn some gas, head down to viking reef ( ask at the lodge, they'll know what I'm talking about). Get there by about 7pm and you can fish till about 9). depending on what size motor you have, you'll need to see how long it will take to get down there. Also, make sure you have your GPS set to do a breadcrumb trail on your way back. There is kind of a tricky ""S"" curve you need to go through on the way down, and you'll need to follow it on the way back. Anyway, drag White or black/silver or blue silver Shad Raps (SR-9's) over about 60-100ft of water at about 3mph ( your GPS should give you MPH so you can tell). You'll see a bunch of boats trolling this same area. What happens is the ciscos are rising to the surface and the walleyes and northerns are following them up. You will be amazed when you catch your first walleye in 100ft of water trolling a lure that dives only 10-15 feet. You can even troll standard floating rapalas that only dive 5-10 feet. Sounds crazy but ask at the lodge, they'll confirm. Regarding day fishing, you'll want to stick with a 1/4 - 3/8 oz jig set up with a minnow or possibly gulp alive minnows. this time of year we generally fish the mid-lake humps in about 24-31 FT of water. use your depth finder to locate fish - they don't lie. when you find them, toss a marker so you can stay on the hump and have a reference point to keep you on the spot. If you want to lindy rig (hook and snell, wieght above the swivel) you can do this as well, but keep to the sand flats as the rocks will eat these up pretty fast and you'll be rigging more than fishing. What to expect: if you're guided, you can realistically expect to put 40-60 fish in your boat a day. We've put 100+ fish in a day, as well as 20, so you never know, but you're going at a good time of year. Lastly, water is warming up and the gators are starting to move. Don't be surprised to start reeling in a nice shore lunch walleye only to discover that you're in the fight of your life with a snot rocket the size of a canoe paddle. One of the guys raised 9 muskies the afternoon we left this week. Lastly, have fun but be safe. Eagle is a large body of water, so make sure your camp knows where you are headed before you venture out. Also, good idea to take a map with lat/long on it for use with your GPS as well as a compass, flashlight, raingear (EVEN IF NO CHANCE OF RAIN), flashlight, and a tarp with some cord in case your motor breaks and you need to spend the night on an island. lastly, WEAR YOUR LIFEJACKETS. Part of what makes Eagle such a beautiful and pristine place is that it is a glacial lake, but the glacier is also what put rocks just below the surface in the middle of what would seem to be wide open, safe water. Have fun, catch fish, and be safe! Cornbread"
1218935,stardaddyed,2010-07-14 07:01:00,20,"You guys are great. I am staying Deer Trail Lodge. It is up by Vermilion Bay. We met the owners at an All Canada show and got good recommendations from customers. They do provide nets and maps. They will also take us out when we first get there for a tour. Your right they are really working hard to make sure we have a great week.I do have a GPS but it is not capable of a lake chip. I do have an old fashion paper lake map (I know, how 80's) so that should help as well but I know those aren't always as accurate as we would like. I will be very cautious. I have no idea what I will do if a hook a 40+ inch muskie/northern! That is a lot of teeth on a really angry looking fish! I am usually a bass fisherman so to me a 40 inch fish is scary!Thanks for the advice on safety. I had heard the same thing. The maps should help. We talked to the owners this week and they said the fishing was really good. Let me ask about expectations. People I talk to say that I will catch at least 30 fish per day (on a slow day). I find that hard to believe. Everyone says that if the fishing is good (not really hot) I can boat 50+. This can't be true. What do you guys think? My expectations won't change the number of fish I catch but I don't want to have the wrong idea about the experience. My kids keep asking and I am not sure what to tell them."
