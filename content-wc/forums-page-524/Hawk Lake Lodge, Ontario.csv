1220172,adempsey,2010-07-17 22:34:00,963,"Never been, but a couple of years ago on a trip a group of guys from New Jersey wouldn't stop talking about how amazing Hawk Lake Lodge was. Especially the food and service. Not sure if there is more than one though, because I am pretty sure there are a few Hawk Lakes in Ontario.Cheers."

Based on that, we are going to give the place a try, I like the 17 portage lake concept and the catch and release."
1220806,adempsey,2010-07-19 22:54:00,963,"Yes, that is probably the same lodge the group was talking about. After you mentioned it was all catch and release, I do recall them mentioning that and I do remember they said the fishing was great too. These guys talked about it so much I looked it up as soon as I got home . It's probably not talked about much since it's one of the more expensive lodges.I am sure you'll have an amazing time. I'd love to go myself.Make sure to make a report!"

I have been there many times over the past 7 years and it is far and away at the top of my list. 17 private lakes to fish, a different one each day. Trophy sized fish. They hold the world record catch and release for Walleye (caught a 36 inch walleye last week I learned today).The smallmouth fishing is off the charts, big pike, lake trout etc. Beautiful cabins, delicious food, hot tub, poker room, etc etc. But its the fishing that just rocks.Your arms will ache after catching so many fish, but a stiff drink and dip in the hot tub after steak on the grill will ease your pain."
