1219704,tv4fish,2010-07-16 09:48:00,2694,Here's an interesting article on the 'skies.http://www.cabelas.com/story-123/spr...+Muskie+.shtml
1219923,dcraven,2010-07-16 20:57:00,47,"I believe the Cedar Lake fish are doing just fine and have coexisted with pike for eons - and successfully. See it - no we cannot always specifically identify the whys (see why...). Why Redgut has 'skies but Rainy proper has few. Why Cedar has them and the next lake has far fewer. The lakes I worry about are lakes where there have never been pike and they are now introduced (Indian Lake Chain, Corner, Langton - Canyon, etc...). As a child when my dad first took me there, there were no pike in those lakes. The resort owner at Blue Lake Store released some to ""make fishing better"" in Blue Lake - so the story goes. Then a heavy rain blew out the beaver dams between Blue and Corner -they spread and are spreading. We started catching tigers in Corner in the early '80's, maybe even 1978 or 79... We started catching a few pike in the ILC a few years later and then the odd tiger. No pike are spreading slowly and will continue, I'm sure. The muskies in those lakes spawn in the bays, right where the pike spawn. I worry about the long term situation there and how the 'skies will cohabitate - or not...But back to Perrault and others... Who knows why they are less successful... Maybe they will increase in your lifetime in those lakes or maybe they are on the way out in those lakes - who knows. Natural selection is sometimes a faster process or sometimes a slower process - usually slower. But as lakes age, it sometimes occurs much more quickly than one would think - especially in times of climate fluctuations.Always interesting..."
1219963,Kevin R,2010-07-17 05:35:00,305,"I agree with different types of Musky in lakes. The Musky in Perrault stay deep most of the time so are out of range for most fishing. The only steady catches are in the river area that have sharp drops to deep water close to shore. Cedar is not deep most of the lake is dark shallow water the pike are small compared with Perrault that has a great forage for Pike to grow fat. The musky for the most part are in the weeds looking for an easy meal & most anglers have a better shot at getting them interested in chasing a lure. Cliff lake has a very large amount of Musky they stay deep most of the time & come onto reefs from time to time to feed but it is easy to see schools of Musky feeding in open water over 60ft or more I have caught & seen these fish feeding many times. When you bring in a Musky many times another will follow the hooked fish to the boat the same thing holds true in perrault. When you catch one be prepared to get back in the water quick often you will catch one on the next few casts but when the bite goes cold they are done the school will just go back to suspend until the dinner bell rings again. These Musky are deep most of the time that is why often they will grab a hooked walleye, Bass or Trout & are caught by luck by many fishing for other fish. I don't waste my time casting all over these lakes for Musky I target active fish in open water that are very easy to catch."

1219031,jsmyers,2010-07-14 11:05:00,198,"I'm curious is anybody has any thoughts on the relationship between pike and musky on the Cedar River chain.As far as I know, musky are present on all the lakes, but in some lakes people can successfully target them, but in others, musky are only a rare incidental catch.The Cedar River chain is made up of the lakes north of Vermilion Bay that flow north to join the English River downstream of Ear Falls.Cliff -> Cedar -> Perrault -> WabaskangWith Wine, Anishinabi, and Aerobus, flowing into the chain as well. (I don't believe there are any muskies in these lakes though.)It seems to me that on the better pike lakes, musky are few and far between. Perhaps they can't compete with pike in their ideal habitat?Are the better musky lakes (Cedar and Perrault, I believe) good pike fisheries too?Is there a relationship to trout? It seems that the better a lake is for trout, the less chance you have for musky (too cold). Are there any in Cliff Lake? How are the lakers in Perrault?"
1219058,troutwater,2010-07-14 11:53:00,299,"I have not personally fished Cedar, but I know several people who have. They all say that they catch tons of pike while fishing for muskies. They usually get some in the 30's without even fishing for them."
1219120,JayM5209,2010-07-14 14:19:00,1050,"There are muskies in Cliff. The past three years I have caught a musky each year while trolling for lake trout on Cliff. All three were 40"" - 44"", and they were holding over deep water (40'-60') off points with steep drop-offs.Although I haven't been to them for six or seven years, it is not uncommon to catch a musky while walleye fishing in Mystery, Evening, and Twilight, the three lakes upstream from Cliff."
1219405,jsmyers,2010-07-15 12:25:00,198,"I thought the topic would be a bit more popular...So the only pattern I can find is that further downstream (Wabaskang) there are less musky than upstream (Cliff and Cedar).Am I right is saying that there are no musky in Wine, Aerobus, and Anishinabi?Is it correct to say that Cliff and Cedar are better musky fisheries than Perrault?"
1219509,dcraven,2010-07-15 17:15:00,47,"There are a number of lake/river systems all over N. America that this holds true... Take Rainy Lake, for instance; Redgut Bay and Seine Bay are known as the muskie hotspots - then the remainder of the lake is average to poor muskie angling at best. And this is within the same lake. Certain water produces and supports muskies better than others. I hunt a ranch in south dakota that supports whitetails in only two of its many draws. The other draws/coolies hold 95% or better mule deer for some unseen reason. Same principle.Back to muskies - some of these ""marginal"" muskie waters do, on the other hand, support truly large fish, though. Conflict between the northern pike spawn/fry in the timing with the muskie spawn/fry could be the primary conflict - or similar spawning areas between the two species. If they share spawning areas, more muskie fry are eaten by the larger pike fry. Whereas on the better muskie lakes the pike and 'skies may have different spawning/rearing grounds.Who knows, but those are some of the theories.DC"
1219643,jsmyers,2010-07-16 07:43:00,198,I didn't realize that some strains of musky spawned differently than others:http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fish/musk..._northern.html
1219667,tv4fish,2010-07-16 08:38:00,2694,"js: I guess I didn't see ""some strains of musky spawned differently than others"" in the MN/DNR article ??? ? I read that article as stating that northerns spawn first and will/may eat the later spawning muskies (2 different species) -- Did I miss something?"
1219684,Guest,2010-07-16 09:13:00,0,"There are at least two distinct strains of muskies - and no shortage of debate on whether there are more than two. Basically though the Leech Lake/Mississippi strain, which is native to the Miss. River drainage and is the native species in Minnesota has several behavioral adaptations that help them compete better with northern pike in the same environment. These adaptations are probably the result of this strain having evolved in systems with native pike populations. One of the key adaptations is spawning behavior. Leech Lake strain fish spawn in deeper water over a very specific substrate (marl/chara), and actually spawn twice each spring. Eggs develop comingled in the ovaries, but only half mature at once. Once the first set of eggs is released the immature eggs develop pretty rapidly, and a second spawn takes place a week to 10 days later. These spawning behaviors A.) get muskie fry away from shallow weedy backwaters where earlier-hatching pike fry are feeding and B.) create two sets of fry to increase survival from predation, weather conditions, etc. On the other hand, the strain of muskies found in Ontario, Wisconsin and elsewhere spawn in shallow weedy areas - and as dcraven said, if those areas happen to be shared with pike, muskies don't do too well. In cases where pike have been introduced into systems where muskies were the only esocids, muskies haven't fared too well. As dcraven also said, in lakes where pike and muskies use different areas to spawn, they co-exists pretty well (Lake of the Woods, Eagle...the list goes on.) But even within a single system different species can dominate in different areas. Rainy Lake is a very good example, but so is Lake of the Woods. There are muskies all over parts of the Ontario portions of the lake, but they're few and far between on the southern shore, Buffalo Bay, etc....but those areas have lots of pike. Interesting stuff..."
1219698,jsmyers,2010-07-16 09:41:00,198,"This is what I was focusing on:Quote: Where the two species have coexisted for thousands of years, as they have in the Mississippi River headwaters, the muskie seem to have adopted different spawning areas. In Leech Lake, for example, muskie spawn offshore in 3 to 6 feet of water. Northern pike, meanwhile, use the weedy shorelines of bays and presumably have less chance to prey on the muskie."
1219703,jsmyers,2010-07-16 09:48:00,198,"So the strain of musky that are in the Cedar River chain are not the ones that spawn in deeper water, correct?Also, what might make muskies and pike spawn in different bays in the same lake? I'd guess that it has something to do with when they warm and the rate they warm at. That is if a weedy back water warms late and then shoots right past the pike's preferred temperature range, then they probably are not likely to use it in any great numbers. But that same bay might remain in the musky's preferred range for a while a few weeks later.The funny thing is that I still don't see a lot of differences between the lakes on the chain that might explain it. To my eyes, they all pretty much look similar....But then I'm not a fish..."
