1222320,LoDo,2010-07-25 21:45:00,721,I've been fishing Canada for 15yrs and only a few times have I seen the Northern Lights. Has anyone seen them this year and when is the best time of the summer to see them? LoDo
1222354,phishfearme,2010-07-26 06:11:00,1242,"the northern lights are around most every night - sometimes MUCH better than other nights - but the fact is that during the summer, the nights are so short and there's always that little glow in the north known as the sun that you can't see them all that well. kinda like trying to see the stars in the daytime - they're there but just not visible. come back in august or later and you'll see them much better. phish"

1222522,Jigger1,2010-07-26 15:02:00,234,Interesting post and one I was thinking about as we're typically up in late June and there's that continual glow to the north at almost all hours. I have an opportunity to go back to SWWL on LacSeul in late August this year so was thinking the same thing and was looking into some forecasts and found this site which was interesting http://www.gedds.alaska.edu/auroraforecast/. Hope we'll catch a glimpse as it's been years since I've seen them.

1222601,REG,2010-07-26 18:21:00,445,"I've spent maybe a half dozen weeks (different years) in Canada the middle of Sept and I've seen them 3 times. We had many pitch dark nights when they just didn't show up (and we couldn't stay out all night watching) or it was cloudy. We now go up in June and we never see them. When you finally do see them and they're really going crazy, it's amazing.You may want to check when the moon rise and set is for your visit - along with the phase of the moon because I think it's better when the moon isn't helping light up the sky.Even if you don't see the northern lights, you'll see so many more stars, shooting stars, satellites, etc. Always worth a look.."
1222604,phishfearme,2010-07-26 18:32:00,1242,"the time of year has nothing to do with weather or not the borealis is visible - it is driven by the ""solar wind"" which doesn't care about the season on earth. some scientists say that there's an 11 year cycle and there's some evidence to show this but as long as the nights are clear and dark up in northern canada you have a real good chance of seeing them - sometimes they're boring and are only a faint glow that comes and goes - other times there's moving drapes of light in various colors sometimes blocking out the stars. phish"
1222706,Aaron-IN,2010-07-27 07:15:00,500,Been going to Canada for 30 years and can just tell you the lights are a lot more visible in May than any other month despite the solar winds. Fishing is better to
