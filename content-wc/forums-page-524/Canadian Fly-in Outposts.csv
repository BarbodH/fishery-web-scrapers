1220609,stumcfar,2010-07-19 10:27:00,451,We have been talking about doing a fly-in trip for a number of years now. Would anybody offer some info on someplace to try? We would prefer to fly out of Fort Francis or Nestor Falls? Any info or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks guys. This would be a trip for next summer.
1220673,octanehi5,2010-07-19 14:13:00,1104,need to know your location before can recommend a place?
1220694,stumcfar,2010-07-19 15:23:00,451,"I'm not sure what more you need. I mentioned that we would prefer to fly out of Nestor Falls or Fort Francis, both in Ontario. Never done this before, so what info should I provide?"
1220723,octanehi5,2010-07-19 16:50:00,1104,"I live in conn. we are closer to quebec than to ontario. I find it much closer to go to fly in locations in northern quebec, also find it less money to go to quebec fly in than to go to ontario. One of the top lacs in northern quebec is lac Hebert with air Tamarac, 7 days ends up beeing about $1200 you bring your food 100 lbs limit each person in the plane.flying out of there home sea plane base.you can fly in from farther away it will cost about $400 per to do it. a better place in quebec you will not find"
1220798,Lonefisherman,2010-07-19 22:32:00,13,"Try Nester Falls fly-in service with Dave and Michelle Buishane, Larus lake would be the lake I would try to get into. Awesome walleye fishing and if you like to fish Northern Pike it is very good also. Been there several times and I don't think it could get any better elseware for a fly-in."
1220838,Aaron-IN,2010-07-20 06:29:00,500,What species do you want to target?
1220842,@Lunker,2010-07-20 06:56:00,835,Take a look at this....http://www.pfo.net/web.phpI've used them twice and thought fishing and service were outstanding. Home base is just north of Emo.
1220857,stumcfar,2010-07-20 07:28:00,451,"I should have mentioned that we would like to target walleyes and northerns, a few smallmouth would be an added bonus. Thanks for the comments so far."
1221034,SinOrSwim,2010-07-20 17:18:00,1528,"We have been going to the same places for many years and have been extremely happy with everything from the quality of fishing, the quality of facilities and service.Verne sold about 1/2 his cabins a couple years ago but both are pretty similar. I think the website is fishredpine.com or Red Pine Lodge. He has both drive-in and fly out. We fish North and South Gull and always do very well.The other is Slate Falls Outposts. There are a lot of places but like I said, we've been using them for over 10 years and have been very satisfied. Would highly recommend them.Not sure if you can make arrangements to fly out of Fort Frances or not?"
1221095,rpieske,2010-07-20 20:35:00,1276,"You can't go wrong flying out of Nestor Falls with Dave Buschene's Nestor Falls Fly In. They have a number of outposts that will suit your needs. They really run a first class operation in everything they do. Here is a link to their website: http://www.nestorfalls.com/ If you contact them, tell them Bob Pieske says Hi!!!!"
