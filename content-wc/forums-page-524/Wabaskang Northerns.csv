1221160,Guest,2010-07-21 06:24:00,0,Stu We are headed up on Friday. Any spots/info you can pass on. Doesn't have to be about northerns as we will be fishing for everything the lake has to offer. I have a couple boys and hope to get them into the best fishing they have ever had. Thanks
1221270,Stu,2010-07-21 12:59:00,472,"The wind was terrible this year. My 8 yr old son was with us, so we were limited in our travels. We never made it to 5th lake and only hit Doe Island twice. Those are our go-to spots for walleye. We found a new spot near the First Nation Reserve and caught walleye and smallmouth off the big island in McLeod Bay. I'll try to put a map together for you, but I'm not very savvy. If you have a fax # I'll send it to you. Or I can send my marked map to your lodge. Just let me know where you are staying and I'll mail it tomorrow. We did really well on smallies. My son caught a 16 incher on a gold rat-l-trap. This year we seemed to catch smallies at will. The lake is higher that I've ever see it."
1221279,Guest,2010-07-21 13:41:00,0,"Stu I know the lake fairly well, this will be our 5th time. I know where Doe Island is so will try that, have fished it very little in the past. We have never gone into Mean Lake(5th) so will try that also. Thanks for the offer of mailing a map, but if you could just recommend a couple spots that would be great and I will mark up my map. We have a 17 ft boat with a 115 on it so the further travel is no issue. Last year we really struggled but it was rainy and cool during the week. Thanks for the help."
1221362,Stu,2010-07-21 19:09:00,472,"Ok, I always do best off of the eastern tip of Doe Island and just a little to the right. Everybody says Devil's Point is good too, but I've never had any luck there. Everyone found Walleye near the Indian Reserve. If you come out of second lake and head towards third, you'll see several cabins on the right. Stop just before them and fish up against the cliffs, near the weeds. The wind was blowing parallel to the cliffs, but I'm not sure it mattered because we tried identical spots with no luck. We hit it about once a day when there wasn't already a boat there and always pulled out a few fish. We also found good smallie action in McLeod Bay. Go around the big island and you'll see a smaller island behind it. Fish the ""trough"" between them, casting toward the smaller island. We caught walleye on the opposite side of the big island, but only when it was overcast and the wind was blowing into it, which made sense. As a matter of fact, we did our best fishing around that island and usually had it to ourselves. It is probably one of the most interesting pieces of structure on the lake. There is also good smallie action in the narrows between first and second lakes. We tied up against the rocks right in the middle of the narrows and threw big creature baits (Chompers) out into the current. I've also had good luck in the past trolling for northern around the island in front of Jim & Julies but the wind was too much for us this year and we couldn't stay off the rocks. By the way, Jim & Julies have a photo of a 51"" musky caught July 9! I hope this is specific enough. Good luck - Stu"
1221454,jsmyers,2010-07-22 08:00:00,198,"That is 2nd giant muskie I've heard about this year. (http://www.sleepydogcabins.com/big-fish-of-the-year/)Musky were always in the lake, but it seems that anglers are contacting them more regularly lately. My theory is that if somebody landed a musky in the 70s or 80s, it was virtually certain that the fish would be kept. Over the last 20 years, I think that has changed so that it is virtually certain that the fish will be released. Those two monsters were both released. When the population is pretty small, and pike predation is high, taking out one adult breeding female might make a significant dent in the population of the whole lake. With consistent catch and release, not only are the fish more likely to grow long, but numbers increase as well.I wonder if the day will come when musky hunters come to Wabaskang....Maybe they already do, they are just really quiet about it . If you want to discuss muskies and northerns in Wabaskang and the other lakes of the Cedar River, go to this thread:Relationship between Northerns and Musky in the Cedar River Chain"
1222204,jsmyers,2010-07-25 11:26:00,198,I've been reading another book:Northern Pike: A Complete Guide to Pike and Pike Fishing by Will Ryan(http://www.amazon.com/Northern-Pike-...dp/1592283438/)It is a really entertaining and well written book. It doesn't focus much on hunting big pike in the north though. It is more valuable for those who fish for pike like others fish for bass. The Author's experiences are mostly in upstate NY with small and medium sized fish.But he weaves biology (including the results of a lot of interesting scientific studies) in with some good stories and humor.
1216705,jsmyers,2010-07-07 07:36:00,198,"It seems to me that comparing a 1/4 oz jig and a 2"" minnow to a 8"" musky lure isn't really a fair comparison.How would a 4-6"" chub or shiner compare to either?I bet the reason that so many good pike are caught on little baits is that these baits are real, and they are presented where the pike are (deeper than many pike fisherman are willing or able to consistently fish).Are their any sources of larger minnows near Perrault Falls? Ear Falls or Vermilion Bay?"
1216718,Stu,2010-07-07 07:56:00,472,"Hey Big Mike, what happened to you? Did you bail on WC? I miss you and Trailer Guy. Glad to see you're back, even if it is as a guest."
1216722,Stu,2010-07-07 08:08:00,472,"Hey John, it hasn't been mentioned, but Wabby has a few musky in it too. I saw a photo of one that was caught in the 1st narrows several years ago. It was an honest 50 incher! I had a smaller one teasing me off Doe Island the last time I was up. Good luck - Stu"
1216737,pikeandtina,2010-07-07 08:45:00,145,"Stu, Saw a picture on a camp website of a nice musky from Wabby, must be a pretty small population, though. Wouldn't break my heart to hook one ! Following Big Mike's advice I will be bringing at least some of my musky lures for the pike anyway. Thanks for the heads-up. John"

1217604,jsmyers,2010-07-09 14:15:00,198,"I got the book the other day and have given it a good look over. I'm pretty busy, so I'm just going to copy the same review that I typed into Amazon. PM me if you have questions.Quote: Originally Posted by My Amazon ReviewI've virtually memorized the In-Fisherman book on pike fishing since I got it when I was a kid in the early 90s. I think I was looking for a more updated version of that book when I ordered Penny's book. The In-Fisherman book is great, but a lot has changed in fishing since it was written almost 30 years ago, and their are a few holes. This book is not that. It is an attractively designed book. It has a lot of useful information, especially for somebody who is new to fishing for big pike. It has a great section on making your own leaders and has a section on dead bait rigs that is much more accessible than the In-Fisherman book' section. It has what looks to be a great ice fishing section (that I'm not very interested in). It also includes better information about fishing rivers. The book also provides a lot of personal advice about the author's lure preferences and extensive experience. I credit Penny with using water temperatures to describe the seasons, but I wish he would have provided a bit more depth on the transitions between seasons, and how to judge the location and activities of fish based on temperature (both on the surface and in the depths), type of lake, and other factors. The book paints a relatively broad picture of 5 seasons, ice out, spring, summer, fall, and ice, and then covers a number of techniques in a story-telling fashion. I prefer the biology/hunt style of writing that In-Fisherman uses in many of their publications, including the aforementioned pike book. Penny's book does not use hypothetical lake maps, or artists' renderings of lake cross sections in order to illustrate is concepts. I prefer a more technical and visual presentation than the one Penny provides. That said, I recommend the book, especially if you are new to fishing for big pike and if you prefer a more story-telling style. It is a good book to turn a somewhat skilled general fisherman into a pike fisherman.My review and others can be found here: http://www.amazon.com/Pro-Tactics-No...dp/1599212579/"
1219972,Kevin R,2010-07-17 06:36:00,305,"I saw a guy throw some bright green Eel like lure & tear up the small Pike one day it could have been the sand cat he did get one about 34"" & was upset he had to throw it back I didn't catch a fish nor did his two partners talk about right bait right time that was it. The water was super dirty looking I changed to a bright lure & also tore them up in another area down from them. Wabby used to have lots of easy to catch 35-40+ "" pike 10 years ago but they are a little tougher to come by the last few years. Still get them but not as many 5-6 a day used to be easy now 3 would be a good day."
1220295,jsmyers,2010-07-18 12:36:00,198,"This is almost the opposite of what I've heard elsewhere (that fishing in general, but for also for pike is getting better in the lake). Perhaps the fish are on to your tactics, or the weather/water conditions are different now."
1220336,Kevin R,2010-07-18 15:26:00,305,"Then you are getting bad info I know these lakes & how to fish them. Tactics change all the time the fishing is still good just not as good as it used to be. I think many would have liked to fish them when we first came in 1965. We used steel leaders all the time even fishing Walleyes as the pike would cut you off to often back in the 1960's & 1970's. Almost any lure would catch fish with a steel leader if it didn't just cast it without a steel leader if it came back without a fish throw it away most never made it back. If you got cut off just say it wasn't that good away I am better off without it. 40"" is the point that Pike are a nice fish at that size I can not grab them behind the gills so I count fish 40"" or larger. I landed more than 10 in 2009 over 40"" 3 over 45"" these are fat healthy Pike all released, most never netted or removed from the water. I use heavy tackle so I bring them in without over playing them as would be the case with light tackle.I go up to take in the beauty of these nice lakes the fishing is what brought my family to them many years ago. If people didn't get fish it would hurt the camps they need the fishing to stay good that is why slot limits came to be."
1221136,Stu,2010-07-21 01:41:00,472,"Just got back from Wabby. We didn't chase the northerns, but I found and interesting spot in McLeod Bay. There is a small bay just east of the big island with a rock shelf in the middle. It drops off sharply to about 40 ft. of water. It looks like a good spot to troll a large lure."
1216487,earll16,2010-07-06 14:03:00,5,"Hard to chime in on the this thread, as we mainly fish walleye when we're at Peffleys. We've been there the first week of June the last two years, and have only spent one day back trolling for Pike in 10-12' of water with lindy rigs tipped with minnows just off the rocky shorelines where it drops off quickly. That was in 2009, and we caught an abundance of fish that day. The biggest (landed) was 31"".....also missed another big guy right at the boat, d'Oh....http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-..._4493507_n.jpgThis year we caught all our Pike coincidentally while fishing for Walleye/Perch. We also caught the biggest fish while doing this. We were fishing off the weedbeds, anchored in about 12-15' of water, and casting in towards the weeds as well as out deeper and bringing it back up. This was all jig/minnow-crawler tipped fishing. Here's some pics of the 41"", 33"" and 27"" we got from the same spot.....http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-...5_712487_n.jpghttp://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-..._5674279_n.jpghttp://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-..._4754350_n.jpghttp://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-..._2579341_n.jpgI don't think you should have much trouble finding and catching Northerns, and BIG Northerns on this lake if that's what you're going there to fish for! GOOD LUCK!! Wish I was going back tomorrow"
1216497,jsmyers,2010-07-06 14:36:00,198,"Did you use bigger minnows when fishing that breakline earl?When I fished wabaskang when I was a kid, we rarely used minnows, but they always seemed too small to use for pike.Thanks for the pics.And thanks for the advice Mike."
1216508,jsmyers,2010-07-06 15:17:00,198,"I think that book I ordered is waiting for me at home Pikeandtina, check your PMs. I sent you some additional resources."
1216515,earll16,2010-07-06 15:34:00,5,"most of the minnows we got from Dave this year were all pretty big, 2""+ range......BUT.....i actually caught the 41"" on the same jig i caught a 27"" Walleye the night before....both tipped with crawlers!http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-..._6147749_n.jpghttp://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-..._4184530_n.jpg(edit: but while catching most of the Northerns we were using jigs tipped with the minnows. and like i said, they were very decent sized minnows)"
1216536,pikeandtina,2010-07-06 16:48:00,145,"Earl,Thanks for the info. I love what I'm hearing about this lake! Wonder if I could get my wife and daughter to go up w/me before we all start back to school in mid-August?!?!?"
1216544,Guest,2010-07-06 17:17:00,0,"Buzzbaits and spinnerbaits are also great choices for northern, especially summertime. A friend of mine from southern Missouri caught a 44"" last year just a stones throw away from camp on a spinnerbait! Alot of guys catch the biggest norhern of the week while using spinnerbaits for bass too. It really comes down to 3 things: time on the water, fishing productive areas, and using lures YOU are comfortable and confident in...the rest will take care of itself. There are alot of great areas to fish on the lake, as well as good resorts. Check out Peffley's website or Jim and Julies website to see alot of great pics! Both resorts are also kid friendly as you will also see in the pics...the northern fishing is what usually gets kids hooked up there!"
1216553,pikeandtina,2010-07-06 17:31:00,145,"Big Mike,Thanks!John"
1216560,Peffley'sCamp,2010-07-06 18:11:00,37,"Catching BIG fish on small baits is actually quite common, and it still amazes me the number of times the big bait, big fish rule is broken during a season. I always have to check myself when asked the question ""what are the best baits for big pike"". The first thing that wants to roll off my tongue is "" a 1/4 oz. jig tipped with a minnow"". It may not be the BEST big northern bait, but it certainly will account for its share of big fish over a season for walleye fishermen. That said, if you are targeting big fish you are certainly wise to be throwing some bigger hardware."
1216566,Guest,2010-07-06 18:26:00,0,"Dave, I had my two boys with me last week. We mostly threw the big baits and had success but I've got to admit you are absolutely correct on the jig/minnow theory. My oldest son was still trying to relive the unbelievable walleye fishing he had on Wabby 3 weeks ago (June 6th-13th) and thought he would continue to hammer the eyes...somebody forgot to tell the 23 to 27 inch Pike about that! He singlehandley kept me from fishing becaue I was constantly taking off pike and rebaiting him with another minnow as he stood on the front of the boat and casted the shorelines while I fished the other side of the boat with bigger lures. It was a riot and something that can happen every day of the season if a guy wanted to go through the minnows at a torrid pace! Good luck the rest of the year with your camp...I'll be hanging around again soon. Mike"
1216582,Peffley'sCamp,2010-07-06 19:31:00,37,"Mike,Saw you cruise by a couple of times last week and had a chance to waive at you once. Glad to hear that you had another good trip. But as I have said many times ""if you don't have a good time up here, you don't have anyone to blame but yourself"". Not sure that is always true, but pretty close!How awesome for your son! That's what it is all about. I had my daughters down on the dock earlier this week slip bobbering smallies and we had a blast too. Seven consecutive times we put a bobber in next to the dock it went down with another 15-17"" smallmouth. I wish they'd hang under the docks all summer!Hopefully see you up this way again this month, if not for sure August. The weed edge bite should be going strong by then."
1216158,jsmyers,2010-07-05 15:02:00,198,"Some help is needed to interperate these spotsI've attached a snip of a map. Is this roughly what you mean for the first weedbed? Is the bay marked in red the second one, or are you referring to the bay on the west side of the same lake (just off the lower left corner of this map)?Where is ""T tree?""[edit: the map is incorrect...later posts clarify the location of the weeds]"
1216167,pikeandtina,2010-07-05 15:38:00,145,"Dave, Why do you think Gawley's Bay is different...water coming in?"
1216186,Peffley'sCamp,2010-07-05 17:34:00,37,"This is only a guess as to why Gawley's Bay is different. The Bay is an absolutely awesome part of this fishery and holds a variety of forage the entire season including summer. My belief is the big pike that stay in the bay have 1) good cover with lot's of weed beds and 2) an abundant food supply. Finally if fish are in the western portion of the bay they really aren't that far from deeper water either.As in everything relating to fishing their are many variables and water temps have to be considered also. Some summers that are very, very hot will likely increase the bay temps to an undesirable temp for pike, otherwise it can sustain some pretty incredible fishing most of the summer."
1216212,jsmyers,2010-07-05 19:11:00,198,"I'd guess that the rate water comes into the western part of the bay from the south, which is likely pretty cold, combined with the stiff west wind that can churn the whole thing up, keeps the temps a lot lower than they would otherwise be in a shallow flat like that.Dave's not going to help us interpret his post earlier about the location of some of the good weedbeds...I guess he is going to save that for his guests, which is understandable. I just wish he would tease me with little tidbits I can almost use, but not quite. Its like I'm a pirate that found my treasure chest, but I don't have a key."
1216231,pikeandtina,2010-07-05 20:11:00,145,"Hey JS, Thanks for the info and be sure and let us know how the Penny book is!"
1216280,Peffley'sCamp,2010-07-06 04:38:00,37,"Jason,As I mentioned in my e mail response to you, many of these spots you are looking for are fishing spots named by our guests or myself (after 20 years of fishing Wabby) and no I won't disclose the exact location of ALL of them. Every camp and fisherman has a different name for many spots as I look at your google map. If my intent was really to tease you, I could throw out another two dozen spots I reference regularly as I peruse the lake map. I would mention to you that many spots that we refer to no longer have the landmark to associate with them. The ""goalpost"" is a prime example, I have guests who still fish the goalpost even though it hasn't been there for twelve years.I would recommend you stop driving yourself crazy over this and just stop in to see me when you come up next spring/summer regardless of where you stay on the lake. I will be happy to discuss the lake map with you in person."
1216281,Peffley'sCamp,2010-07-06 04:43:00,37,"Jason,The weed bed runs NW to SE on the big lake from about half way down the long shore to the island, not thru the narrows as you have it drawn."
1216312,jsmyers,2010-07-06 06:48:00,198,"I'm just joking around. I'm not going crazy. You've been more than helpful and I don't believe your trying to tease anybody. Thanks for the invitation! I'm sure that even if we don't stay with you next year, we will sometime.And thank you for clarifying the location of that weedbed."
1216466,Guest,2010-07-06 13:27:00,0,"I just returned from the lake...it was a great week as usual. Most who know me know that I primarily fish for northern...big ones. They are what I aim for the majority of the time I am there. The lake holds many giants and anything above 40"" is truly a great fish anywhere, not just Wabaskang. There are very few lakes that you can drive to any more that will produce like Wabaskang. I've said it before...like Dave stated...the abundant weed growth makes Wabaskang what it is. It protects many walleyes all summer long from fisherman that normally would look for them on rock structure...at the end of the day they are left asking, ""why aren't the walleyes out of the weeds yet?"" answer is simple...bait. Until the bait leaves the weeds, most of the walleyes stay there also...and so so the big Pike. Last week was no different...we caught 6 walleyes over 27 iinches all in the weeds. The pike were right there with them as well. Okay...here's my advise. If you choose to fish Wabaskang you need to keep moving around the lake to its numerous...and I mean numerous, deep water edged weedbeds. Don't be frustrated if you don't catch a big one the first day out...most trips we have days that the big ones don't hit at all, only the little ones. But when you get the day they are slammin...skip lunch and supper and take advantage of the bite! Stay out there while they are active! As far as lures...I throw mainly a variety of jerkbaits and swimbaits, very large to most persons standards. However don't overlook the simple daredevil or the mepps spinners either as last fall they wanted 3"" green colored five of diamonds! If you go to Wabaskang and put your time in long enough, you will hook into a beast...whether you land it is on you! Later, Mike PS...I love Gawley's bay too...I usually drive from the south to fish it at least half of the time I am there...its the main reason the Big Lake is so productive in the fall in my opinion."
1216472,pikeandtina,2010-07-06 13:37:00,145,"Big Mike,Appreciate your input. I do have large jerkbaits, as I fish for musky as well as northern. Do you ever have any luck w/buzzbaits or spinnerbaits( two of my favorites!)I was hoping you would chime in since some of your posts were what got me interested in Wabby to begin with.Thanks in advance,John"
1215992,pikeandtina,2010-07-04 21:32:00,145,"Hey Guys, Need some help here! Our group is planning to go to Wabby(Peffley's) during Summer 2011. We are a group that likes to catch smallmouth, some have never caught a walleye but would like to, but mostly we are after Northern Pike (numbers and a shot at trophy fish). Any reccomendations for month, lures/baits, or locations would be greatly appreciated. BTW this is the first time for any of us to fish Wabby. Thanks in advance!"
1216006,Stu,2010-07-05 02:24:00,472,"I really don't target big northerns but there was a guy in camp who hammered them last time I was up. There is a big weed bed just north and a little east of Doe Island. He threw Sand Cats just above the weeds. It's not hard to find, the weeds are about 3-4 feet below the surface and there are always a few boats sitting there. It is just before the channel that leads to Gawley's Bay. Check the thread about Geographic Names on Wabaskang. It is very informative. He also went west from the island and fished the big bay in the back of the lake. Wish I could help you more. Good luck - Stu"
1216008,Stu,2010-07-05 02:29:00,472,Check out these monsters from their website! A lot came from Wabby.http://www.bigforklures.com/photoalbum.shtml
1216034,pikeandtina,2010-07-05 07:10:00,145,Thanks Stu! I appreciate any info I can get!
1216049,jsmyers,2010-07-05 08:35:00,198,"Virtually all my experience with Wabaskang is from northern fishing in the summer. It has been about 15 years since I've been up there, but I'm going back next year. So any tips to pikeandtina will help me out too, especially the location of good weedbeds or early-season hot spots.What week will you be up there? It might help me to fine tune my advice.I was always up there in August or September. We started when I was just a tike going late, but had to keep moving it up earlier for school and football. By the last few years, I think it was the first week in August. The middle of summer is a great time to catch numbers of smaller fish. We usually fished pretty shallow and therefore rarely caught fish bigger than 30"" -- a fish over 25"" was a good one, but we caught 18-24"" fish almost non stop. I think the fishery has improved somewhat (due to the slot limit and catch and release ethics) since then, so the same tactics might get slightly bigger fish today.We'd basically find weedbeds and troll or drift over them with traditional pike baits. Our favorite was a mepps #4 or #5 Aglia. I usually stuck to silver/nickle when the sun was out and copper/brass when it was cloudy; honestly though, it didn't really seem to matter much. The #4 was a bitter better to catch the occasional perch/bass/walleye, and it was a bit easier to crank in on light tackle. I suspect you might catch slightly larger fish with a larger bait...even the smallest pike you can imagine will strike and get hooked on a #5 mepps.One of our favorite tactics was to have one or two people in the front of the boat cast towards shoreline cover (trees, rocks, reeds) while the other one or two people in the boat trolled over the weedbeds that we're usually just out from there. When the water is calm, you can see a lot of the fish hit the lures, and it is fun! Unfortunately, this is a poor tactic for big pike in the summer, as they need much colder water. Instead of using medium heavy gear, go with a medium or light spinning rod and the fish are better matched to the gear.We always stayed at Gawleys, so I'm more familiar with the south end of the lake, but I'll still pass on some of our favorite spots:-From the 1st narrow back toward the islands in the First Lake is a huge shallow flat with good weeds.-Trolling through Keynote Creek (which we called the channel to Keynote) is crazy fun for numbers of small fish.-In front of Tall Pines (in the first lake) is a good (deeper) weedbed, which pretty much extends up to the falls. That is where some of our biggest fish came from. Had we replicated those tactics in a place with deeper water nearby, we might have had more, bigger fish.-We'd fish the shallows in the coves on the east side of second lake, using the troll/cast tactic that I mentioned earlier.-There are a lot of shallow flats in Keynote Lake.These spots are closer to Peffley's:-The 2nd narrows and then to the south toward the second lake is a huge flat of good weeds. We always did well there.-I remember once finding a lot of deeper weeds in the north end of Wine Lake, and just killing them on a perch shad rap (SR9). These fish were slightly bigger than what we were used to in Wabbie, but still not big ~24-27.""If I were going tomorrow, I would be finding the deep edges of big, deep cabbage beds. I'd fish them especially when the wind is blowing off of the deep water onto them, when the sky is cloudy, in the evening, and not after a cold front. I'd be using pretty big baits, that I can get down a ways, like a J13 rapala or a big jig with a shad tail. Or I'd experiment with live or dead bait. I'd also be working on ways to fish the droppoff, covering water and looking for active fish. Big jigs might work well for that.I'm planning on going up early next year, but we don't have the details nailed down yet. I'd also be interested in September again. By then, big fish should be back in the shallow flats more consistently."

I have the in-fisherman book, and it is good, but maybe a little out of date in terms of lures and gear:https://store.intermediaoutdoors.com...px?item=BV001&I also just ordered Pro Tactics: Northern Pike: Use the Secrets of the Pros to Catch More and Bigger Pike by Jack Penny. I'll let you know what I think when I get it.Most older books or more general books and those that include muskie in my opinion completely miss the wolf's nature."

Two of my favorites northern lures are 1) the weedless Johnson Silver Minnow with a white plastic tail attached, like a 4"" or 5"" twister tail. Toss it right into all the weeds and slop you want. 2) For trolling, especially in the evening, the largest black/silver Rapala Husky Jerks are hard to beat."
1216081,pikeandtina,2010-07-05 09:47:00,145,"Thanks for the info, guys! I've been fishing Canada for 25 years, but know it takes a while to key in on a new lake. Sounds like the weedbeds are good place to start! Don't know for sure when we are going, just trying to figure out the best time to go...early when water is cooler, or later when weedbeds are well established. My personal favorite way to fish for pike is to throw large buzzbaits over and around weedbeds...nothing like topwater explosions from Pike. Thanks again guys and keep it coming. All info is greatly appreciated!"
1216130,Peffley'sCamp,2010-07-05 13:06:00,37,"All very good information and accurate in my opinion. The most consistent big northern pattern during the prime summer months of July and August is cabbage weed beds that are adjacent to deeper water.The weed bed running the long shore to the northeast of Indian Narrows out to the unmarked island is a good place to start for sure. Some other very good bays for big fish is the little bay just down past Big Rock/Little Rock and the far west bay down around T tree. One notable exception to the adjacent to deeper water rule, is Gawley's Bay. Seen lot's of big northerns taken there during the summer months. I would also have to second the suggestion of casting Rapala Husky Jerks. One of my favorite ""go to"" baits for every species in the lake, especially when they are off the feed.Hope this helps."
1216151,jsmyers,2010-07-05 14:34:00,198,"Peffley's (and everybody else),How do the catches for big northerns break down between those that were caught while targeting northerns, and those that are incidental to walleye or bass?I get the impression (partially from my time at Gawley's camp as a kid) that most big wabaskang northerns caught in the summer were incidental to walleye fishing with a jig and a minnow."
