Water temperature at 64 F. 7/18 Scattered clouds throughout the day, with occasional sunshine. Clearer skies in the late afternoon and evening. Soft winds from the south east with water temperature at 67 F. We fished a 14-18 foot flat coming out of 35 feet of water. We caught a bunch of nice eaters. Seanna had a 40 inch pike right up to the boat but it got off the hook. that slowed the walleye for about a half hour then had a 30 minute frenzy with several 20-4, three 26 inch walleye, a 27 and 28 1/2 All in all a pretty good couple of hours. Last Wednesday Seanna had a 35 inch pike come out of the water 3 times chasing her walleye. while it was doing that the other walleye started biting like crazy. A few minutes later another pike over 40 inches grabbed a different walleye, it let go beside the boat. 5 minutes later a third pike about 33 inches grabbed her walleye. None held on long enough to land but Seanna was thrilled. Every time the pike were busy the walleye fed voraciously. In the past week I counted 12 different pike attacks on walleye. The Wolosak group had one they figure went over 50 inches grab a walleye and get right close to the boat. ( last year they had a big pike go after a 27 inch walleye they were netting and ended up in the net) I was releasing Belindas twenty eight (28) inch walleye and had a big pike come up and grab it. 7/19 Showers in the am with scattered clouds in afternoon. Showers resumed by 5pm. Mild winds from the north east. 7/20 scattered clouds throughout the day with light showers by the evening. Wind blowing from the north east. water temperature at 64 F. Tim and Jim had a good day fising out of the sand flats and bringing in about 130 the largest at 25 using jig heads and minnow gulps. Ron and his family had about 67 the larges at 22"" using minnows and crawlers. Also had a few pike. fished out of jacks hump. 7/21 Clear skies in the am with some scattered clouds in the afternoon with a little humidity. Mild winds from the north. Water temperature at 66F. Ron and his family went out with Kevin today and had some good numbers. Plenty of eaters and the occasional size. Tim and Jim had a great day hauling in about 137 walleye, the largest at 24"" and a few pike, using spinners, minnows, and worms. 7/22 Scattered clouds in the am and throughout the day. Mild winds from the north. Water temperature at 67 F. Ron and his family went out to sand flats and brought in about 40 then moved on to the wall with another 54 the largest a 24Â”. Jim and Tim went out to pike alley and had several pike and about 67 walleye. Used gold spoons and jig heads with crawlers for the walleye. 7/23 I wanted to do a little exploring around the sand flats. ( The Hoekstra group caught literally hundreds of big eyes around the flats this week) however the kids wanted immediate results. So after dodging a small thunderstorm I went a proven mid lake hump. I spotted a bunch of big fish off the southwest corner and anchored up. Within minutes Seanna had a Huge walleye. I had to return to camp to take care of some things for my guests. I continued to see a bunch of big active walleye and baitfish on the sonar unit. I rcognized the kind of thing you don't see everyday and didn't want to miss what was going to happen. I left my anchor in place and tied a small noodle on it. Dennis and Seanna jumped in with Hayden who tied his boat to my anchor rope so they would be in exactly the same spot I was gone about 25 minutes and in that time Seanna had caught 2 more monster walleye. Hayden had put them in the livewell so I could photograph them when I returned. So here is an unusual photo of Seanna with two Giant Walleye. Because we release all walleye over 18 inches this is a rare event. Hayden got in on the act and Dennis also caught two or three nice big walleye They also caught about two dozen nice eaters. All within about an hour. They were on the edge of the drop on the south west end of the hump all in an area the size of one boat. In 20- 26 feet of water. All on orange jigs and frozen shiners. When I returned and tied my boat to Haydens it altered the swing and moved them slightly off the spot maybe about 30 feet. No big walleye. As soon as I untied my boat and Haydens boat swung back into optium position Dennis caught two more Giant Walleye. This was a prime example of being in EXACTLY in the right place. When going over the map with my guests I've often said to people that when I say right here I mean RIGHT here. THE spot on the spot is often a very small area. Even on spots that I've fished often I will criss cross looking for fish with my sonar unit then try to place the anchor to put the boat in EXACTLY the place I want. Sometimes I need to reset the anchor 20 or 30 feet one way or the other to get the boat exactly where it needs to be. Big walleye action on these small areas is often for only a short period of time. So timing is critical and it is imperative that you ""stay on em"" Typically what is happening is that the walleye have a school of perch or ciscoes pushed up against the edge of a structure. They will feed voraciously on them and then the school is either eaten or scattered and the fish catching subsides as the big walleye move on. When you find them spread out over a large feeding shelf it can last all day while you catch one here and another 20, 50 or even 150 yards away. 7/24 Clear skies in the am and afternoon until about 4pm. Strong winds came in with out warning from the north east. Winds died down after about 20 minutes. Scattered showers for a moment, then clear and beautiful evening. Water temperature was at about 66 F."
