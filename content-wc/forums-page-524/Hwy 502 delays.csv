1221406,JayM5209,2010-07-21 22:27:00,1050,"Thanks for catching my goof. I should have said ""11/71"" instead of ""17/71."" I was referring to the route west from Fort Francis then north through Nestor Falls and Sioux Narrows. If that correction is made each place I erroneously said 17/71, I think the numbers make sense."
1221577,Stu,2010-07-22 15:01:00,472,"Just got back from Wabby. We took 71 thru Sioux Narrows, mainly for a change of scenery. It was a beautiful trip. We always cross the border at 6am to avoid the line, so we had time to kill anyway. Almost no traffic either way. One guy in camp complained about the construction on 502, but I didn't press him. I enjoy the journey up almost as much as the fishing and the extra hour didn't seem like much."
1221647,Fishin Fun,2010-07-22 18:52:00,218,"We used to take 502 to Red Lake, but have been taking 71 for the past few years. It might take a little longer, but there are more towns to stop at if there's a problem and it is a straighter and less hilly road than 502. We just got back last week and 71 was good."
1222032,Catman59,2010-07-24 11:07:00,345,Came home through there last night. Maybe a 5 minute delay at most. I hit the 2 pilot cars perfectly.
1220893,JayM5209,2010-07-20 09:12:00,1050,"As charted by Google Maps:Intl. Falls to Vermilion Bay via 502 = 153 mi./3 hr., 48 min.Intl. Falls to Vermilion Bay via 17/71 = 167 mi./4 hr., 15 min.Intl. Falls to Dryden via 502 = 122 mi./2 hr., 58 min.Intl.Fals to Dryden via 17/71 = 198 mi./5 hr., 4 min.So, for those traveling north from V.Bay on the Red Lake Road, using 17/71 instead of 502 will add 14 miles to your trip and cost you another 27 minutes.For those going to destinations east of Dryden, the 17/71 route will add 76 miles and an additional 2 hrs.and 6 mins."
1220919,tv4fish,2010-07-20 10:03:00,2694,"Warrior: My opinion w/b to stick with 502 --- Yes, you WILL have a construction ""delay""-- but IMO -- it's not worth going the longer route (We went up from Aitkin and it wasn't THAT bad)"
1220925,thunder1,2010-07-20 10:26:00,27,"just got back,its smooth."
1220957,joeman79,2010-07-20 12:37:00,417,smooth as in road conditions? How was the oil and gravel? How long of delays did u have?
1220962,Steve of Madison,2010-07-20 13:01:00,230,"Just drove 502 up and back last week, 2-20 min delays but other than that the road is very good. When this stretch is completed it will be very nice. Not really worth the extra drive going the other way if heading to Ear Falls or Red lake areas. Watch your speed though, they are patroling and it cost me $52 to lead a parade of others, because I was the lead dog he pulled me over and the rest of the 10 cars following me then had clear sailing. For those of you following me, you can thank me later!"
1221079,Warrior56215,2010-07-20 19:38:00,46,"Thanks for the advice. I think I will stick with the 502 and pack some patience. The heads up is sure nice on something like this, allows for a person to plan accordingly."
1221224,Skywagon,2010-07-21 09:53:00,1106,"Went down 502 to International Falls yesterday afternoon and then back this morning. Not really all the bad, maybe lost 20 minutes. Going the other route would not be worth it, in my estimation."
1221303,LoDo,2010-07-21 15:00:00,721,"Thanks All! Leaving Denver, CO one week from today and headed to Donald Lake in the Woodland Caribou Prov Park. Flying into Minneapolis then driving to Red Lake, flying to Donald. I think our group will stick with 502. Thanks!!"
1221325,eyewitness,2010-07-21 16:19:00,680,JM5209 your #'s don't jive.....time and distance don't add up with your comment.......am I missing something?
1221349,MorganMan,2010-07-21 18:14:00,341,"We don't really have a choice either, the wait sounds like it's not too bad compared to the many, many extra miles. Good heads up on the patrol! We usually sail on 502 and have only seen 1 OPP in the last 14 years we have been going......I'm not sure our fine would have only been $52! lol. Thanks for taking one for the team."
1220380,Blue Lk,2010-07-18 17:24:00,269,"I travelled from Dryden to Fort Frances on 502 today,got stopped twice on 502,maybe 10 min wait both times,maybe 5 to 10 miles of gravel.Short wait at causeway(5 min).Was going down to pick up a horse so decided to come back thru Nestor Falls/Sioux Narrows.Hwy 71 is in pretty good shape."
1220412,lunker99,2010-07-18 19:03:00,236,Are they working on saturdays? Will be going through in a couple of weeks around 6:30-9:00 in the morning and was wondering what peoples experiences have been during this time frame so far. Thanks. Paul
1220441,Eyes_R_Us,2010-07-18 20:29:00,66,I went up a week ago on 17/71 and it was very nice but of course takes quite a bit longer than the normal 502 route. Yesterday (Saturday) we came back via 502 and it was pretty frustrating. There were several spots where we had to wait for the pilot car and we followed the water truck down the gravel so the van and boat were both covered with wet gravel goo. The causeway only held us up about 5 minutes. The normal trip from camp on Eagle to Ft Frances is about 3 hours. Yesterday it took 4 hours and it probably took an hour at the carwash today to clean everything up. We got to the border at 11:50am and it took about 50 minutes to get across. We finally got home at about 11pm last night so it was a long trip. Boy it was worth it though - my son and I caught lots of big walleyes on Eagle Lake last week. We had a blast.
1220456,MorganMan,2010-07-18 21:31:00,341,Doesn't seem to me that there is any way around the construction that would make sense if your driving from Fort Frances to Sioux Lookout. I see that some take 17/71 but that option seems way out of line for our trip. I know we need to plan for the delay unless I'm missing something?
1220540,Kevin R,2010-07-19 07:36:00,305,Thanks don't want to get the boat & Truck coated in dirt & oil. Last time it took way to long to get it cleaned off.
1220549,WalleyeRip,2010-07-19 08:01:00,44,"Don't do what we did in June....Heard about the delays on 502 after being up in the sioux lookout area in june and thought we would go down 622 to Atikokan to avoid the delays. Bad idea. 622 is really rough and long. Thought, o well, when we hit 17 east of Fort Frances we will make up the time. They had that road torn out and were laying grey gravel with a lead vehicle. Two chips in the windsheild on a brand new tahoe and broken out trailer lights from the rocks. You may want to fish with me but don't let me tell you how to drive the truck. Hope this doesn't happen to anyone else."
1220565,cspierings,2010-07-19 08:44:00,230,"We experienced the delays on 502 coming back from Lac Seul a week ago. My white boat and silver suburban were pretty well khaki colored by the time we got to the border. It was funny how easy it was to see who had come down 502 waiting to cross back into the US. The boat and truck are both clean now but I am not sure the boat cover will ever be the same again. What is a real bummer is what a little of that gravel grit will do to your boat or trailer if it gets trapped between a strap for the remainder of the trip. The wait at the US border was the longest I ever experienced. I think the work on the causeway and 502 is causing the border to back up at times. The delays on 502 also put us into the peak time for people crossing. All total between the border and the delays on 502 and the causeway we lost about 2.5 hours coming home. Border crossing took a bit more than an hour, in fact I have never had to go so far out of Fort Frances just to turn around to get in line. The guys on 502 looked like they were really busting their butts in terms of the amount of work they got done from the time we arrived and departed and didn't have particulary good weather to work in. There was also a delay on the trans canada highway between Dryden and V Bay and another on the highway out of V bay heading up to Ear Falls but they were only about 5 minutes each. I have never seen that much road work in all my time going to Canada."
1220717,Warrior56215,2010-07-19 16:35:00,46,What time do they get started each morning on the 502?
1220837,Guest,2010-07-20 06:29:00,0,We've taken 71 the last 2 years and liked it much better than 502 on our way to Wabaskang. Taking 71 rather than 502 adds less than 20 miles between Int'l Falls and Vermillion Bay. We like knowing that if we have truck/boat/trailer trouble along the route there are at least places to stop without turning into a traffic hazard. With the delays on 502 (either short or long) it's easily a wash to take 71. Tight Lines. Andy
1220854,Warrior56215,2010-07-20 07:22:00,46,I am going from Bemidji to Sioux Lookout next Wednesday. It looks like it would be about an additional 75 miles to take 71 and 17 versus the 502. Looking for opinions as to which route would be the best. Thanks.
1220069,v-bay gord,2010-07-17 14:10:00,3168,Guests have been reporting some delays coming up on highway 502 due to highway repaving and long sections of fresh gravel.........up to an hour in some cases. You may want to consider going the hwy 71 route to save the hassle and dust on your boat.
1220072,2746,2010-07-17 14:18:00,3206,"Thanks Gord! We've been through some of that on 502 in earlier years and it can create a real mess on the boat. Besides, a change of scenery will be good. Always liked highway 71 for that reason."
1220073,Outfitter17,2010-07-17 14:20:00,127,"V-bay gord is correct, With the causeway under construction as well as a chunk of 502 you should consider going west out of fort frances and around, especially if under normal conditions it is 1hr or less going west. If you are traveling after 6pm, then I wouldn't worry about it, but during the day, it's something to take into consideration."
1220135,LoDo,2010-07-17 18:23:00,721,I'm coming through Ft Frances heading to Red Lake 7/28. We'll be crossing the border around 4p and heading North to Red Lake using 502.
1220155,Outfitter17,2010-07-17 20:31:00,127,"LoDo,You will definately get a delay if you go at that time. The guys on the bridge get done working around 6pm and it seems the guys on 502 they work until 7-8pm each night."
1220204,MorganMan,2010-07-18 06:49:00,341,Thanks for that information. We travel from Fort Frances to Sioux Lookout and don't have another option without adding a lot of time to the trip. We will make sure we give ourselves enough time to get through the construction. I assume they have a pilot car or truck bringing traffic through each way?
1220213,Outfitter17,2010-07-18 07:19:00,127,"They have a pilot car on the 502 construction during the day, not sure about at night?"
1220250,prov1900,2010-07-18 09:22:00,544,"Outfitter, Do you know how long that project is going to take? We came through it the first week of June. We are going back up that way in late September. Not complaining, because that road has come a long way since the first time I took it. More maintenance means my trailer and transom will live a little longer"
1220271,Outfitter17,2010-07-18 10:20:00,127,"Prov1900,The Causeway project is suppose to be completed by Oct. 15 and I would assume the 502 project needs to be done around that time also, due to cold weather right around the corner. That being said the guys on the 502 seems to be working pretty quickly, so they may be done quite a bit earlier, I will keep you posted."
1220317,Kevin R,2010-07-18 14:37:00,305,So 71 is the way to go is it smooth or bumpy ?
