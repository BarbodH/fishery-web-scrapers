1221072,joeman79,2010-07-20 19:05:00,417,What would be an estimated wait time at the Ft Frances crossing on a friday morning? Any feedback would be nice. Thanks Joe
1221089,Aaron-IN,2010-07-20 20:13:00,500,Just guessing but I would say less than 15 minutes.
1221116,Moondog,2010-07-20 21:57:00,362,Shouldn't be a problem. If you really want smooth sailing...cross at 6:45am when they all want to go home after their shift ends at 7 am. Fridays aren't generally a problem.
1221120,Pat,2010-07-20 22:10:00,203,"Friday should be smooth sailing, very little wait time."
1221179,Outfitter17,2010-07-21 07:14:00,127,"At this time of the summer, I am guessing 15 minutes on a friday morning would be a long wait. Shouldn't have any issue."
1221287,jimirjr,2010-07-21 14:13:00,1149,We do a Friday departure from our outfitter and cross between 8:30 and 10:00 am.... never wait more than 5 mins..... it goes really smooth...
1221350,MorganMan,2010-07-21 18:17:00,341,"Ditto, Joeman79! We normally cross about noon on Friday and have had little wait in the last 15 plus years. Always best to avoid weekends if you can."
1221648,Fishin Fun,2010-07-22 18:56:00,218,We went through 2 weeks ago on a Saturday morning at about 8am and there was about a 5 minute wait. I would assume Friday would be about the same.
