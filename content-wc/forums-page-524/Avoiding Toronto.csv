1221274,micropterus,2010-07-21 13:23:00,450,The past two years we have had very heavy traffic on 400 south of Barrie. This year the west ramp to 407 closed. Started me considering an alternative to 400 south of Barrie to Port Huron Mi. I am towing a boat. Any suggestions?
1221307,polaris-pete,2010-07-21 15:06:00,343,"I travel this route quite a lot during the Summer and alot more during the Winter.Barrie is a very busy city no matter when you go through there.I just came back from Lake Nipigon and if ( and I do mean IF) you time the trafiic well in advance you will zip right through and around Toronto on the 407. By this I mean try and travel either very early in the morning or later ( 9 ish) or so in the evening and ESPECIALLY avoid driving on Friday from 4-9 evening as this is when all the cottagers head North from work to their cottages. As for any West Bound ramp being closed, it was all open 3 weeks ago when we left and came home. I cross the Lewsiton Bridge and get on the QEW and get off onto the 407 past the big bridge in Hamilton. Then its a straight run right off unto the 400 towards Barrie. We used to go the QEW to Highway 403 then get on at the 401 but the last time we took that route ( many years ago) we hit an accident on the 401 and sat for 3 hours!!! These routes are about the only way you can get to the North. Good luck."

Of course, I was towing a boat so I wasn't in the passing lane much. In my opinion, I just live with it. Toronto has far more traffic issues. I passed through Toronto on a wednesday morning at 8:00 am. Ouch? I refuse to take the ETR/407 ripoff highway with a $30 toll for a 1/2 hour ride. We took QEW 403 427 401 to 400 north and there was a 1/2 hour delay from backed up traffic and the usual fender bender. They only time that i pay the ripoff 407 is if I'm traveling on a Canadian holiday weekend during daylight hours and passing by the Toronto airport would rasie my blood pressure too much"
1221507,adempsey,2010-07-22 11:28:00,963,"I have friends that take highway 27, but personally I just time it so I go on to 400 before the major traffic hits (between 3pm and 7pm is the worst time). Of course, I live in Toronto so it's easier for me to do that - at least on the way out.It also depends where you are coming from. Although, getting on to the 401 further east might not be much better.I also often totally avoid these roads and take the off beaten track (gotta love the GPS!). It can take me an extra 30+ minutes, but losing some time beats the frustration of sitting in bumper to bumper traffic."

1221752,doubleheader,2010-07-23 07:05:00,2652,"We always leave home so that we are above Barrie by 9:00AM, it's the only way to go especially when pulling a boat even though that gets us to our destination 2 hours earlier than check-in. We came back last Saturday, the 17th, and experienced the same problem you did with the ETR west closed. Very painful stop and go for the next 2 hours, but I don't think there are any other options."
1221875,fourize,2010-07-23 15:13:00,287,"Heading up that way in September. Final destination is 3 hours north of North Bay. Been going up for 18 years, but have always crossed at the 1,000 Islands before moving to Tioga PA in January. We'll be crossing at Niagra Falls and was told to take QEW to 427N to 401E to 400N to 11N. Is that a good route around Toronto? We'll be leaving PA at 5am on a saturday and figure on crossing into Canada around 8am."

The 407 is a toll road but is quicker and takes you directly onto the 400 North which turns into Highway #11. One thing many are not aware of that in Ontario they have a couple different laws that guys from the States have been fined for. One is if towing a boat or any trailer, their law says-the hooks have to be closed types from the trailer to the towing vehicle. Closed means a snap hook so the S trailer connectors cannot come off accidentally. The second law is- the trailer plate has to be readily in view which means the license plate cannot be under the trailer or not readily visible. I know this from past experience when some of us went snowmobilling and got pulled over to the tune of $200 per vehicle! I was the only one they didnt ticket because I had already done this to all my trailers."
