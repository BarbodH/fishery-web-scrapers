544339,Guest,2004-11-30 12:07:00,0,Sick leave? TBO... how do you work it? LOL!
544340,Guest,2004-11-30 12:10:00,0,He skips school....and I know he is doing it and when I catch him Im taking his fish away.....if he ever catchs any.
544341,Guest,2004-11-30 12:55:00,0,"PROBABLY THE ONLY PERK I HAVE IN MY CORPORATION IS THAT I GET 15 DAYS THAT I CAN USE ANYWAY I WANT. 5 DAYS CARRY OVER TO NEXT YEAR. I NEVER MISS SCHOOL WHEN I AM ILL.... I CANT ""WASTE"" MY SICK DAYS ON ILLNESS. THERE ARE FISH TO CATCH...LOL"
544396,nitroman,2004-12-05 22:51:00,368,"178 days yes I also count days,look at pics from past trips,clean tackle boxes,bs with buddies about the trips,make plans and new stratagies,study lake maps,read everything i can find that has anything to do with fishing, and so on. gonna try a trip to lotw in mid january with all the ""canada"" boys to help cure the cabin fever. 51 weeks of planning for one week of fishing thats not silly in my book. can't wait to pop the cap on that first blue and make some more memories to think about the next winter"
544206,Guest,2004-11-19 13:24:00,0,Here we go another long winter and i am already day dreaming and counting the days until I am on that lake in great country of canada. All I do is look at pictures from the past and tell stories with ole fishin buddies over a case of blues. Hope I am not alone in the planning of next's years trip the day after i get back. love it and live for it. not sure where we are going this year but it will be somewhere. maybe a fly in--who knows?
544212,Fred_G,2004-11-19 19:04:00,908,"I already have three trips booked for next year, first week of July, first week of August, and third week of September. I can hardly wait. You're right, it's going to be a long winter. We can only hope that the winter months pass as fast as the summer months seemed to have this year."
544216,Dano,2004-11-20 08:16:00,83,"LOL, I know how you feel. I have been planning next years trip (our first fly-in) for a couple of months now, and just sent the final deposits yesterday. I guess I will spend the winter sorting tackle, ordering new stuff, figuring out the menu, reminiscing about past trips and answering the call to be on the water with a couple of ice fishing trips to Temagami for walleye, lake trout and whitefish. Winter in northern Ontario can be beautiful too."
544222,fourize,2004-11-20 12:53:00,287,"Isn't it great? My Dad and I are going up twice next year. We used to do 2 weeks straight, for the last 5 years. Now we are going to split it up and go up one week in the spring...probably last week in May, and one week in the fall...sometime in September. That's so we don't have to wait so long between trips! Twice the fun!"
544224,bigfish1965,2004-11-20 22:52:00,3210,"Gents; For those coming up next year note that there are going to be reduced limits in most areas (lowest will be four fish, only one over 18"") as the MNR tries to make the regs a bit more uniform and easier to understand. We spend all winter reading the new stuff just so we have half an idea whatw ecan do ALso, and maybe more importatnly, the US dollar is expected to fall even further. It may be wise to buy Canadian dollars NOW. The deficit is the key to which way the dollar is going to go."
544285,rebelrn2001,2004-11-26 21:01:00,1563,"197 days My wife laughs at me. I typed up a ""Countdown"" sheet. From 100 down to ""blast off"" that I cross off days on until we leave. SO, only 97 days until I print that baby off again next year!!! Maybe I'll print it off the day before....then it's only 96 days!!! Maybe I'll print it off 2 days before....then it's only 95 days!!! Maybe......."
544331,Guest,2004-11-29 15:32:00,0,"You guys are nuts. If it actually means that much (and don't get me wrong, it's fine if it does mean that much) why don't you move closer? Oh, wait a minute. Forget what I said. I just remembered it is exactly that desire which allows me to do what you guys like to do all summer. Imagine what it would be like to get paid to fish Lac Seul everyday. Don't forget to tip your guide!"
544333,Guest,2004-11-29 17:08:00,0,"NWO Fishing Bum: Are you going to be back at SWWL for 2005?. If I could move closer I would, but married with kids forces a person to work...cheers IA Walleye"

544337,Guest,2004-11-30 10:03:00,0,"INTERESTING THREAD... I STARTED GOING TO CANADA IN 1990 AND HAD A BALL. WENT WITH OLD COLLEGE BUDDIES (BALL STATE UNIVERSITY GRADS OF 1989) AND LOVED IT. - MORE THE BEER AND FRIENDSHIP THAN THE FISHING. WENT BACK IN '92 , MORE BEER, FRIENDS, FISH...THEN IN '93 THE FISHING BECAME THE FOCAL POINT! AND I HAVE BEEN BACK TO CANADA ONCE A YEAR SINCE. IN 2000 I CAUGHT A 52"" MUSKIE , IN 2001 CAUGHT A 42"" PIKE, SO NOW I AM REALLLLLY HOOKED. THIS YEAR I AM GOING 3 TIMES....
