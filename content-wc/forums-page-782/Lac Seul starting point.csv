544179,Guest,2004-11-16 09:25:00,0,"Well Fred, I have given you three days to defend your statement. I guess your silence proves how false it truly is. You should be ashamed!!"
544180,Guest,2004-11-16 10:13:00,0,"In responds to the location of Mahkwa lodge. You will travel about 18 miles out of Hudson to Archies Landing and from there you will take a short 10 minute boat ride to the lodge. I have been there a couple of times and have been very satisfied each time. You get a good fishing trip at a reasonable cost. This is a great place for a first time Lac Seul trip. Try to book as early as you can, the fill up fast."
544181,Guest,2004-11-16 10:20:00,0,"Do you have directions to Archies Landing from Hudson? My crew pulls boats up there, and we use a launch site about 5 miles before you get to Hudson (from Sioux Lookout), and we're always up for trying new parts of the lake! Thanks! >In responds to the location of Mahkwa lodge. You will travel >about 18 miles out of Hudson to Archies Landing and from there >you will take a short 10 minute boat ride to the lodge.

544182,mwal,2004-11-16 12:03:00,151,Archie's Landing is run By The 1st Nation tribe and is private except for the quests of Mahkwa Lodge. However it wouldn't hurt to contact them about launching for a fee. Mwal
544197,Guest,2004-11-17 09:40:00,0,Do you bring your own Guides with you? Have you ever lost any props in that part of the Lake? Do you puff up when somebody catchs a bigger fish than you?
544231,Guest,2004-11-22 14:08:00,0,"Sorry I didn't get back to you sooner, but I couldn't type because I was laughing so hard. First of all I was being Facetious. Kind of like saying ""Bobby Hull was better than Bobby Orr"" I didn't intend to get anybody upset while I mentioned Mahkwa Lodge. On a more serious note, SWWL is a great camp, and anyone going there will not be disappointed. However,I fish in the spring and I have stayed at both camps and most of the fishing is done at that time year in the northern bays. ( Two Point, Hudson, etc.) These bays are located alot closer to Mahkwa. As far as sharing common fishing ground: I see and run into and fish with SWWL boats every day on the lake, and sometimes vie for key lunch spots when the lake is high. So that's how I formed my opinion. and if that is not the TRUTH, there must be Two Silver Water Lodges on Lac Seul. I welcome input from fellow fisherman who have fished these same waters. So we don't have to go back forth, saying my dad can beat up you're dad."
544240,Guest,2004-11-23 07:40:00,0,"Fred, who are Bobby Orr and Bobby Hull? Were they famous walleye fisherman? Would these guys stay at Mahkwa or SWWL? Are they good Ice fishermen?"
544244,Guest,2004-11-23 13:01:00,0,"Well, I didn't see the facetious nature of your comment, not at all! It certainly wasn't presented as such. Calling it facetious was simply a defense tactic in recognition of the poor taste of your comment. You seem intelligent enough to realize such a comment has a personal element to some. I said Mahkwa and SWWL very RARELY fish similar areas. I did not say NEVER fish similar areas. The exact reason for the RARELY is because in the early spring aggressive walleyes are located in greater abundance in isolated back bays, mainly because the water temps rise faster in these protected areas or smaller water systems. Naturally, with the sun in the south, the north shore bays exhibit an even greater early warming than the south shore bays. So yes, we do fish similar areas and thus likely use similar shore lunch beaches for about a one to two week period (of a twenty week season). Even in these instances it is usually for only part of the day, and not near on a consistent basis. Therefore, what I said is THE TRUTH, and there is not 2 SWWL's, neither literally nor figuratively, on Lac Seul. Bobby Hull-Bobby Orr? I would say more like Team Canada vs. Team Poland: more class, better equipment, and better production. And I am not trying to be facetious."
544246,Guest,2004-11-23 15:16:00,0,"I do not know who either of you guys are, but in the original message that is starting this controversy, Fred at one point uses the internet term ""LOL"". LOL is an instant message term that stands for ""laughing out loud"", meaning he was joking around. As a result, the message should have been taken as fun in nature, and I am sure was not meant to anger."
544247,Guest,2004-11-23 15:25:00,0,"I do not know what you guys are talking about...there are no fish in Lac Seul. It is a big fished-out swimming lake. If you have not been there, do not go. Head to Minaki or Lake of the Woods. The resorts are old and the owners are rude, and the bottom of the lake is strewn with nucleur waste;~)"
544130,Guest,2004-11-11 07:05:00,0,"I am looking for a drive to or boat in resort on Lac Seul. But first I would like some opinions on what areas of the lake to fish. 1) NW corner near Ear Falls. This seems to have the most resorts. 2) Central West area North of Perrault Falls. 3) Southern area. Few resorts and more remote. Are different areas of the lake better in Spring, Summer or Fall? I don't want to be somewhere where I need an hour plus boat ride in the spring because all the Walleye are gathered near a river at the other end of the lake. I have the same types of concerns for Summer and Fall patterns."
544131,Guest,2004-11-11 07:38:00,0,"New Guy, When do you want to go to Lac Seul? What species do you want to catch? How much is your budget for a week (assuming you are going for a week)? Are you interested in catching a lot of fish or do you want to go catch big ones? All these factors enter into answering your question. I personally believe the best Walleye fishing on Lac Seul is in the South Central and North East part of the Lake. These areas are fished less and have a great varity of structure that allows you to fish pre-spawn, spawn, post spawn, transition and main lake patterns. Which in turn means good fishing all season. Lac Seul is blessed with many excellent Reort Owners and Outfitters who when you stay with them will assist you with how to fish the current pattern. You might even want to try a Guide for a couple of days who can put you on some fish and show you working patterns and techniques. Good Luck, LacSeulGuide"
544135,Guest,2004-11-11 10:47:00,0,"Good questions. I'm looking for Walleye and Northerns not small mouth or trout. I'm looking for 1 week trips to a drive to resort to keep the cost down. I have fished spring, summer and fall in the past 15 years from the same resort. It depends on everyones schedule for the year. I think there are advantages to getting to know an area instead of changing locations ever year. I'm looking for a resort for the next several years not just a one time trip. That is why I'm interested in an area that can produce all year. On years I don't take the kids, trophy fish are more important to me than lots of fish. (but I would settle for lots of trophy fish) The North East area looks to be fly in or boat in only, is that true? Would you consider South Central lodges to be: Lac Seul Lodge, Fishermans cove, and Lac Seul Onaway? Or farther south like Silverwater Wheel Lodge?"
544141,Guest,2004-11-11 14:29:00,0,Check out Mahkwa Lodge. It is in the part of the Lake you want to be in and they know how to catch fish.
544142,Guest,2004-11-11 14:37:00,0,"Ditto, Mahkwa is the place to go."
544151,Guest,2004-11-12 10:38:00,0,I hope you 2 guys did not ruin it for the rest of us !!! LOL I been holding out on mentioning Mahkwa Lodge for month's. Let em all go to SWWL. Little do they know the boy's at Mahkwa showed them where to FISH !!!!!
544153,Guest,2004-11-12 12:19:00,0,We have been fishing the Northeast(Chamberlain Narrows) part of Lac Seul for years. The fishing is next to none but the 1 1/2 hour boat ride in and out is tough before and after a long car ride. They also are getting pretty spendy at $100.00 US a day a guy. All that gets you is a bed and free ice. Is Mahkwa close to Hudson? Do you travel far to fish? Are they priced reasonably? Are they pretty busy? Thanks
544156,Guest,2004-11-12 17:53:00,0,"Fred K, THAT IS AN OUTRIGHT LIE!!!! Over 90% of SWWL employees know absolutely NOBODY at Mahkwa, and vice versa. As well, they VERY rarely share common fishing ground . . . I am so angry I can't even go on right now. I am going to take some time to calm down Fred, and allow you the opportunity to defend that stetement. Let's hear how you formed this opinion!!"
544165,orchard frank,2004-11-13 21:00:00,1900,"I have been going to Lost Island Lodge out of Hudson for the last 12 yrs. Great accomodations,boats, food, guides, etc. Short boat ride from Hudson launch, they will pick you up. www.lostislandlodge.com"
544175,Guest,2004-11-15 15:48:00,0,"We have had great luck over the past 15 years going to Black Bay, an outpost camp from Lac Suel Lodge. The owner has been great to deal with and very dependable. We have gone from as early as memorial day this past year, to mid July in some years past. The fishing has been great every year. The earlier you go the more likely spring storms can make for a rough lake, but other than that no preference. We really like the solitude and reduced pressure of that area of the lake. You are going to have a great time on Lac Suel though, it's just remarkable. We tried some real high dollar fly-ins to Manitoba a few years but still always come back to Lac Suel."
