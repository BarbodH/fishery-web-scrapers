We drive from northern Indiana but wouldn't mind traveling a little further(13 hrs). A good walleye and pike lake would be great but smallies would be good, too as a bonus. We really don't need luxury acommodations--just a fairly clean cabin. Interested in hearing from people who've been to a particular place for several years. Thanks for the suggestions. Trout"

Catch and Release the Big Ones so somebody else has a chance to catch there DREAM FISH."

Check at the bottom of the main page to see if the ""email press lake"" link is sending you to the correct email address. If it is maybe their email is down. They did seam to have troubles with it from time to time due to the service they were using. I have been to Press Lake several times. Some guys I houseboat with in the spring make that their second trip every year. A couple of years ago I met ggg (a Walleye Central regular) there. One afternoon he boated three eyes over 28"" while I did squat. He had a lot nicer trolling motor setup than I did and could hold over the fish better in the wind. The rest of the trip we didn't do to bad. Caught plenty of eyes and northerns. Didn't fish for bass. That was the trip I took my wife along on. She had a huge northern (50 incher?) break off a few feet from the boat. ggg gave a great recomendation for Press Lake here on Walleye Central and so did I."
