544326,Guest,2004-11-29 12:48:00,0,ya wooglin. that's them. we actually used to eat them about 50 years ago when i was a kid. pretty tasty white meat as i recall. boney though.
544327,Guest,2004-11-29 12:59:00,0,"local, don't whitefish have tiny mouths? these suckers were about the size of a quarter."
544328,Guest,2004-11-29 14:19:00,0,"A 20 inch whitefish could have a mouth the size of a quarter....generally a ""finer"" looking mouth than that of a sucker though. Besides looking like a giant shiner minnow they have a small ""fin"" (there is a scientific name for it that escapes me) just behind the dorsal (top) fin & before the tail. Any fish in the trout family has one.....kind of looks like a fin that didn't grow. Whitefish fight well and usually will lose a lot of scales if you net them or handle roughly. Do have a line of bones similar to a bigger walleye. Most often caught by accident early in the season when water temps are cold and the fish are shallow.....during summer months they are usually suspended in deeper holes. Definate forked ""v"" tail. A 20 incher would be fairly average size for a whitefish but would be pretty large for a sucker. I have noticed whitefish will often bleed more than most fish."
544332,Guest,2004-11-29 16:00:00,0,"local, thanks for the info. perhaps i spoke too fast for wooglin's catch. mine were definately suckers."
544334,AB,2004-11-29 22:48:00,61,Check out the MNR website. It has a picture and description of the White sucker. Similar to Redhorse sucker I've caught numerous times.
544336,Guest,2004-11-30 06:56:00,0,"Well, the one I caught had a mouth on the underside of its head, the mouth was the size of a quarter or so, I couldn't get my thumb in it....anyway, it was pretty nasty looking - I definetly didn't want to keep it to eat - ESPECIALLY when there are walleye to be catching!"
544342,Guest,2004-11-30 13:01:00,0,We was afishing on Lak Sool fur suckers an we kaught a brownish gold fis with kat like teeth and a white spot on his tail....duz enybuddy no what it was. kaught it dragging chikin liver long a bunch a weeds.
544276,Guest,2004-11-25 19:01:00,0,"late july last year, i caught 3 of these guys in steamboat bay. caught on crawlers bottom bouncing. all about 3 pounds. i've never seen them before. is this common or was i just ""lucky""?"
544297,Guest,2004-11-28 08:10:00,0,"Several years ago I caught one near the entrance to Scaler Lake. Couldn't believe what I had. They are somewhat different then the suckers in MO, but none the less, a sucker. Have caught several since, but nothing to speak of. Seems the white fish are quite popular there also. They sure give up a nice fight. eyesnatcher...."
544307,Guest,2004-11-28 18:16:00,0,i was wondering if they were a native fish or escaped bait. maybe a local will know.
544319,Guest,2004-11-29 11:38:00,0,Was this a sucker or a whitefish?
544320,Guest,2004-11-29 12:01:00,0,"they were definately suckers. i know what whitefish are. these suckers, unlike those down here in the midwest, were almost white in color. ours are goldish in color similar to carp."
544321,Guest,2004-11-29 12:08:00,0,suckers are common to most lakes in NW. Ontario....including Lac Suel.
544322,Guest,2004-11-29 12:28:00,0,ok. thanks. never caught any before this year.
544323,Guest,2004-11-29 12:28:00,0,ok. thanks. never caught any before this year.
544324,Guest,2004-11-29 12:31:00,0,"I caught something on Lac Seul this past summer, it was just nasty - about 20 inches in length, faught like a northern - had a big bottom head sucker mouth, silver/white in color, big scales, and it slimed like a mofo....I also caught mine bottom bouncing with a worm. I am assuming, these are not trophies by any means, right? I tossed mine back asap!"
544325,Guest,2004-11-29 12:45:00,0,you may be describing a whitefish...which is also common to most lakes in nw ont. Large silver scales but the whitefish is shaped like a giant shiner minnow rather than the sucker which has a more chub shape. Whitefish are great to eat....the limit is 25 on a regular licence. Whitefish are part of the trout family and spawn in the fall.
