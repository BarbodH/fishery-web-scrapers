544289,Guest,2004-11-27 09:56:00,0,"Thunderstick, No need for a map. Stan e-mailed me one this morning. Clatouche looks nice, but that is a haul. Just an estimate, but that looks to be around 7 miles. Also, the river inlet looks rocky, as does Clatouche. Are these accurate assessments? Thanks"
544295,Guest,2004-11-28 05:40:00,0,"Rocky? Yeah, but very navigable. There is one stretch just before entering Clatouche that, upon first sight looks imposible. (Big boulders)After witnessing the guides blow through there, however, we long ago discovered it to be no problem. You can always kill the motor and push your way through until you get the feel of how to maneuver. You'll notice on the map an offshoot lake on the way to the outpost called Beaver Lake. Entry into this lake requires lifting the motor and pushing your way through, but it's no sweat. You can locate smaller walleye there. Meanwhile, relax and enjoy the adventure. You'll sometimes encounter moose on your way up the ""river"" to Clatouche so keep a camera handy. Good luck and save some for us."
544298,Guest,2004-11-28 09:49:00,0,"Thunderstick, Is it about a seven mile run to Clatouche?"
544305,Guest,2004-11-28 16:39:00,0,Sounds right.
544204,Guest,2004-11-19 05:20:00,0,"I am planning a trip to O'sullivan in late June. This will be my second trip down the Clova, I went to Pavillon Richer last year. Does anyone have any maps or lake insight for O'Sullivan? Thanks"
544217,Guest,2004-11-20 08:50:00,0,Pikefisherman: We are thinking about Richer next year. How was your trip? Anything we should know?
544218,Guest,2004-11-20 10:03:00,0,"Lac Echouani at Richer is an absolutely beautiful lake. Unfortunately, we caught very few fish. We targeted pike during the second to last week of June. The weather was awful, with a ton of rain and even snow at night. The accomodations were nice, with each cabin having an elevated view of the lake. I am tempted to go back this year, but because the fishing was so poor, I am going to try O'Sullivan. There is absolutely no catch and release policy (posted or unspoken) at Richer and that concerns me. However, I am a novice at this sport and I could be wrong. Raymond Richer and his wife, Giselle, were delightful. I hope this helps."
544237,Guest,2004-11-23 04:31:00,0,"We've been going to O'Sullivan since 1980. The lake is divided in two parts by a narrows on which the camp is situated. From that vantage point you have great destinations either way. Without getting too specific, the opportunity to fish in protected, productive water in the event of inclement weather is always available. The accommodations are quite comfortable (indoor facilities, electricity, etc.) As for the fishing itself, the outfitter insists on self managing O'Sullivan. House rules protect walleye and pike (size limits, catch and release, circle hooks for pike when dead-bait fishing, etc.) Thus, the odds of landing big fish in quantities has not diminished over the years and in some respects has increased. You can travel to outpost lakes or take a guided trip to a trophy lake in which all pike are released. We've had our encounters with bad weather and less than ideal fishing over the years but have never left disappointed. We have experienced some absolutely indescribable walleye and pike fishing. We've been up there any time between the middle of June to the beginning of August. Each time period has its plusses. Lately we've concentrated on late June/early July for the variety of big pike and lots of walleye. Trolling, casting and jigging have all produced. This year we're giving dead-bait fishing a serious trial. Good luck."
544245,Guest,2004-11-23 14:20:00,0,"Thunderstick, That post was great! It makes me feel good about our decision to choose O'Sullivan. In terms of pike fishing, we are planning to go in late June and will target pike. What have you found to be the best locations, baits, and depths during that time period?"
544267,Guest,2004-11-24 19:09:00,0,"Late June...early July...my favorite time for 'gators. In general terms the pike move away from the shallows and emerging weeds but they'll still be somewhere in the neighborhood. Humps, rockpiles and rocky points seem to hold the big guys but we've connected with some lunkers tight to shore in the stick-ups. We like to troll and keep the lures moving but the biggest fish we've caught have been while casting. Last year we were in Clatouche Lake and we'd trolled for four or five hours with only a couple of snakes to show for it. My partner was cleaning weeds off his lure, I had shifted ther motor into neutral and to ""pass the time"" I tossed my Husky Jerk toward a pile of rocks we had passed over at least a dozen times that day. The lure stopped. Big pike. No...make that BIG pike. He didn't even know he was hooked. We got him to the boat twice but he'd done the roll and when he finally turned and began swimming away the line must have dragged across a tooth and he was gone. (That's what they'll do to 50lb super line...an absolutely clean cut.) Having boated three twenty pound plus fish in my life, I can say that this northern was in the 30 lb range. Next year I'm loading 80lb lb P-Line and we're going to experiment with frozen smelt and circle hooks. One option your group might want to consider is a guided trip to Armentier Lake which is strictly catch and release but 30 lb pike rule those waters for sure. The best advice I can offer for late June is to keep your bait in the water, try different presentations and every once in awhile, if you're trolling, jerk the throttle up to about 5mph. Good luck."
544269,Guest,2004-11-25 05:44:00,0,"Thanks Thunderstick. Have you fished the Armentier Lake that you spoke about? Is it worth the money and time to try or should we just stay in the main lake? Also, how easy is it to get to Clatouche? Thanks again."
544271,Guest,2004-11-25 08:51:00,0,"Yes, we've fished Armentier. The day we were there we were blown off the lake twice thanks to incoming thunderstorms. Nonetheless, we netted one pike in the fifteen pound range and a lot of fish in the 8-10 lb range. Weather is always a factor. Big fish, however, are common. Because it's a smaller body of water, you KNOW your lure is contacting fish all day long. Whether they bite or not is their business. Clatouche is an adventure. It takes about an hour to negotiate the trip from the main lodge. Our group usually fishes Clatouche four out of the seven days we're there. Most days we have the entire lake to ourselves (except for occasional moose or bear, which we seem to spot with more regularity lately) If I were to design a lake specifically for big pike, it would resemble Clatouche. There is an outpost cabin but we've yet to see it occupied. We generally seek shelter there if the weather turns bad. My biggest fish is a 24 pounder (not to mention the near 30 pounder I lost in 2004.) There are also some healthy walleyes in this lake. I've seen a 12 pounder caught out of here by another angler. Clatouche is my favorite fishing hole in all the world. Good luck."
544272,Guest,2004-11-25 09:49:00,0,"Thanks. When you say an hour to Clatouche, do you mean by boat?"
544277,Guest,2004-11-26 04:05:00,0,It's the only way to travel.
