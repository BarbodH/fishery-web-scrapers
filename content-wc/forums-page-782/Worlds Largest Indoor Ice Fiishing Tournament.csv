This is about 8 minutes from Pine Falls east on Hwy 11, 1 miles past Silver Falls. It is right on the highway you can not miss it. 1st prize is guaranteed at 5000.00 all other prize structure will be listed when it comes available. 100.00 per hole 100 holes (this all the holes that will be sold) Now for the questions we are assuming this has not been done before has it ?"

I guess this all started out with the battle of weather and numbers in the past. Holes i'm guessing will be 5 feet apart about the same as a reg. shack. If a monster gets on it could get a little crazy. Although there is a good chunk of change available, this is still for fun. The spot that was picked is fairly well known for northerns. It will be situated in a bay, with a weed bed off the east side. There is also some fairly fast water off the point. The tent obviously will be far enough back from the point."
544385,Guest,2004-12-04 15:55:00,0,Maybe have everyone rotate holes every hour? Might add some fun
