The night before I caught a 7lb walleye. saw only one other fisherman and fish seem to be scattered out since i only had one bite each night. Going tonight in about an hour."

Caught one 22"" eye tonight and had another nice one get off right as i was about to grab him. you'd think after all these years of fishing i'd learn to bring my net. But still not bad for about 45 minutes of fishing. This feb. and march should be awesome. I talked to the dnr boys the other night after they were done shocking a few eyes and they said the amount of keepers (18"" or bigger) they've seen this falls is double what it was last year. Let's just hope the army corp of engineers keeps the water flowing."
