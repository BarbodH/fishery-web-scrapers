544258,Guest,2004-11-24 08:45:00,0,"Here's a bit of a rant I posted on the General board....it's buried in some thread. Anyway, I thought it was too important a subject and figured I'd throw it on here for discussion. Makes my blood boil! The thread on the other board was discussing outdoor channels in the U.S. ----------------- Here in Canada, the Outdoor Life Network (OLN) is the worst thing I've ever seen. There is NO hunting shows allowed, fishing shows (only a handful) are shown weekend mornings only, and the rest is bonafide craap. Dogs running through obsticle courses, shows on hauntings (creepy Canada...i'm not making this up), searching for bigfoot and swamp monsters, ugh, unreal. Here in Canada we have a broadcasting regulator called the CRTC that treats us like children. It is an old, archaic group bent on keeping broadcasting mostly Canadian Content, to the exclusion of ""good or bad"" programming. Their mandate, per channel, is to have the programming be representative to the niche your channel claims to target......music shows etc. on music channels, sports on sports channels, and outdoor activity on the OLN. The OLN stretches their mandate waaaaayyyyy far, to the realm of the ridiculous. If you go outside to fart, that's good enough for a show according to them. What dog courses, rodeo, monster hunting and the like have to do with the true Canadian outdoor experience is beyond me. One of the true Canadian outdoor activities/pastimes/sports called HUNTING is actually banned from their airwaves. Thank you CRTC. (sorry for the rant) (time for me to get an illegal American Sat. dish methinks)"

The other shows get better ratings and thats why they are there. I think it is about cash not CRTC (although the CRTC, like the FCC, is a big bunch of crap)"
544261,Guest,2004-11-24 09:58:00,0,"Then perhaps the network (if it's going for the cash) should get itself another CRTC approved name and mandate, and move along to leave the outdoor networking business to someone else. There is only so much advertising revenue etc. to go around.....so the CRTC limits how many sports, music, news stations allowed on the airwaves. The Canadian OLN is dead-space eating up advertising dollars to a network that would or could show hunting and fishing programming on a regular basis, and not just on weekends and Tuesdays at 7:00am. And, although I'm not certain, I do believe hunting shows on Canadian OLN are not allowed. Don't even apply. What I heard anyway. Ever since TNN turned itself into the Spike channel, I haven't seen In-Fisherman, Shaw Grigsby, Roland Martin etc. etc.......you don't have to like these guys or their shows, but at least you had an opportunity to see them. The OLN should have been the one's to pick up on this void in the market, but alas, have no interst I guess. A fishing show on between 5-12pm....a dream?"
544264,Dano,2004-11-24 15:38:00,83,"Yes I agree it is poor, and you are right on the money. I miss being able to see In Fisherman etc., and am stuck watching Bob Izumi's Real Info-mercial. Pathetic, not unlike TSN showing a boxing show at 12 noon? How many housewives are boxing fans? Then they complain that the ratings are no good and the show is dropped."

Lol! I just sent an e-mail to TSN yesterday on the very subject. Great minds think alike! Here's what they had to say: ------- Hi Thanks for the e-mail and the kind words. Unfirtunately I'm not in charge of making the program line-ups, although God knows I should be. I will forward this to our producer and he will take it up to the ivory towers. I just want you to know that I agree with you 100%. Take care and please keep watching All the best Russ -----Original Message----- From: To: [email protected] Sent: 24/11/2004 1:48 PM Subject: TSN boxing schedule Russ and crew. I applaud your recent efforts at bringing more boxing to the Canadian public via TSN. Fantastic job, keep it up. I only suggestion and question, is why not schedule your fights after 5p.m.? Why are your boxing shows buried in the daytime slots? As far as I know, TSN has no NHL hockey this year, the CFL is over, no NFL coverage.........that leaves the snoozefest NBA. Can you guys not find room to actually show a 'sport' in primetime? Does boxing not qualify? Check out your schedule if you cannot remember.

544273,Dano,2004-11-25 16:27:00,83,"LOL! Good call J, I just fired off an e-mail as well. Cant hurt can it? What do you think of this weekends upcoming Barrera/Morales? Should be interesting to say the least, the winner should fight the winner of the Paquio/Marquez fight! Awesome stuff in the works!"
544280,Guest,2004-11-26 12:46:00,0,"Well Dano, you know how it is. I'll have to seek out a friends illegal satellite feed in order to even see it. The bars around here don't show fights anymore....too expensive for them to buy PPV's. Anyhow, I'm hoping I'll get too see it at my neighbour's place. I can't get too excited about it....don't know if I'll be viewing it or not. Should be a good tilt though."
544388,Superdad,2004-12-05 07:27:00,64,"According to the CRTC (who we have to believe?) the fishing programs that have been airing are nothing more than info-mercials and that their format MUST be changed. Those involved in the creation of these shows are wondering how they will get around the proposed regs for these type of shows. No more, we're staying at XXX Fishing Lodge with my XXX rod and reel, spooled with 10lb XXX line using XXX fly Dope, wearing clothes from XXX mens shop. That's what they want to curtail. I've suggested to some that I have talked to is to buy the time from the network ( Like Bo-Flex) and air your programs. It might cost the sponsors more to create the shows BUT they'll get their product line out and anglers would watch them with the same format- why not what else is there? Haven't read WC Canada lately, but glad to see Bigfish here also David Delcloo aka Superdad"
544389,bigfish1965,2004-12-05 08:04:00,3210,Had a blast at Quinte SuperDad! I remember the legislation you are talking of. I think it was a good idea since the shows were becoming less about fishing and more about how many times you could say 'Product X' in 22 minutes.
