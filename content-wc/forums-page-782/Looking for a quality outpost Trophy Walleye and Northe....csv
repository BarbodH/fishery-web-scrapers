In previous years we have had large groups 18-20 and have chosen american plan resorts in order to meet everyones needs. This year I have decided to go with a much smaller group 6-8 guys that are die hard fisherman. We are looking for an outpost camp with good equipment and would like a shower in the cabin and that is about it. We are after trophy walleye and northern pike wouldn't mind some lakers but not a must, don't mind a few portages as long as there resonably close and the equipment on the portages are in good shape (i've had some bad experiences in the past on a few). Our trips in the past have been wonderful lots and lots of 16-20"" walleye and lots of northerns 24-30"" but this is not what we are looking for this year. Looking to spend around $600-800 american. I look forward to hearing your suggestions."

It is the only camp on a lake system of 5 lakes. I just received last years letter and the largest pike released was 48"", walleye was 32"", and laker was 38.5"". This doesn't include the fish that were taken and mounted. Only thing that might matter is that it doesn't have inside plumbing or showers. There is a shower house though and out houses. If you want more info please post a message."
