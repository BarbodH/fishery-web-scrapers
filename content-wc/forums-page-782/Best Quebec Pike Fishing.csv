544211,Guest,2004-11-19 18:43:00,0,I am looking for recommendations on the best pike fisheries/outfitters in Quebec. Any information would be great.
544221,Guest,2004-11-20 10:57:00,0,piker - try the north american bushman. we did a week at their crow bay camp on lac evens and although it was an extreemly poor weather week we all got at least one over 40. they're abit expensive but offer the best pikin' around - and the walleye aren't bad either. you can probably do a search on this site for more details. - phish

544232,Seanik,2004-11-22 16:43:00,218,"Pikeminnow I would recommend the Gouin Reservoir, especially in Early June. I was there in August fishing Walleye's, didn't target Pike but caught a 38"" and 40"" Walleye fishing. There were some fellows in another camp cabin fishing for Pike and they caught some big Pike every day."

544279,Seanik,2004-11-26 09:37:00,218,"Larry, We were at La Pointe aux Dore (Walleye Point) a drive in outfitter located in the South Western part of the Gouin Reservoir. Good clean cabins, 16' boats with 9.9 motors. We never had to travel more than 15 mins. to catch all the walleye we wanted, didn't target Pike caught them accidentally. Seanik"

They average 24""-28"" but there are quite a few large ones 45""-50"" that can be had as well, mostly by chance. A cold front came by the 3rd day and shut them off entirely in the shallows and we had to resort to fishing walleye deep on the points early and late, which was great. They came back on the second day after the front and fishing was good again."
