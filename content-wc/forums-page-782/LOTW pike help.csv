544185,Guest,2004-11-16 13:43:00,0,All: 2004 was my 1st trip ro LOTW in mid June and we are returning on the 3rd week of June 05'. We are staying in the N/Falls area of the lake and need some general help to find some nice pike. We tried a little unsuccessfully thsi year fishing in the weeds but had no luck w/spinnerbaits/buzzbaits. I was told the reason the pike were not in the weeds this year was because the water came up really fast this year and the minnows were not in the weeds so the larger predators were not either?? I am not asking for anyone's secret spots just a good start on where to look.Thanks in advance.Hoosier

Sunken rock reefs (shallow), fish off the deep side"
544189,wildfisherman,2004-11-16 17:27:00,6,Which camp you going to>?
544191,rpieske,2004-11-16 23:12:00,1276,"Try down in the end of Gohere Bay. Try the points and edges of weed beds. Caught a 20 lb. northern there about that time this year. Small bucktails like a Buckertail 500 and small twitch and glide baits also work well. Did well on a Black Crappie Cranebait, also. I fish the Nestor Falls area from May to mid Sept. Give me a shout before you come up and I'll try to give you fresh info on what's working."
544192,PJM,2004-11-16 23:43:00,3516,hoosier If you want to catch pike go to the Obabikon lake. The lake is loaded with them.

544210,Guest,2004-11-19 17:41:00,0,All: Thanks for the tips. I am staying at Canadian Haven and this past year was my 1st trip. My primary plan is to catch smallmouth and I really thought the pike would bite the spinnerbaits I was throwing but didn't have any luck. The biggest problem is that I just don't any experience fishing in Canada so I was trying to fish baits that gave me the biggest opportunity to catch several types of fish. Hoosier.
544229,rpieske,2004-11-22 07:28:00,1276,"Hoosier: If you are staying at Canadian Haven, just look to your right when standing on the dock. See the big log house up on top of the rock? Well my cabin is the green one down at the water's edge below the big house. Give me a shout when you come up next summer and I'll try to offer some suggestions. Who knows, if I have no one there with me, I'll be glad to take you out for a while and see if you can catch some bass and maybe a muskie or two. I am usually home in the mornings, since I really prefer fishing afternoons and evening. So just come on over. Park it at the dock next to the boat house and walk on up. Bob"

I know they do a bit of business in Nestor Falls and have wondered if you knew them?? Just curious??!! Thanks Steve King aka the ""Hawker"" Hi ya Hoosier!!"
