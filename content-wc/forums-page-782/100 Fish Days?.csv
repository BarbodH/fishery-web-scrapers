544346,wildfisherman,2004-11-30 21:56:00,6,"Extremely possible. I fished LOTW years ago for smallmouth bass. Our guide did not fish. We caught a total of 500+ smallmouth bass in a 5 1/2 period during our stay. Every method imaginable too. top water, sub surface, live bait, and even on a fly rod. We used a golf counter to keep tabs, and even then I think we missed a few as it was busy to say the least. Catching, releasing. We have had more than one fishing adventure up that way with nearly the same numbers, and that 500 plus was in July to boot."
544351,Guest,2004-12-01 10:45:00,0,"Lets talk about some really good days. We have had many 200/300 Walleye days on Lac Seul with just two of us in the boat. When you really get on those pigs you can catch 20 to 30 an hour per man. Last June while fishing in the area of Garricks Rock two of us caught over 400 on jig/minnow in a 6 hour period. Sometimes it takes longer to put a minnow on than it does to get a bite. It happens, I have been there done that."
544359,Guest,2004-12-02 12:43:00,0,Why not go without the minnow and rather with something plastic in those situations? They'll hit anything when they're like that . . . I bet you'll find you could hit'em even faster.

544257,Guest,2004-11-24 08:27:00,0,"Last week was fishing on Norfork Lake, NW Arkansas, with friend and we boated over 300 fish in 1 day! We were vertical jigging spoons and fishing in 28 ft. of water with 1/2 oz. jigging spoons that sink real fast. As soon as our jig made it to the bottom or before we hooked up. Granted if they had all been larger fish we could not have caught as many. We were fishing white bass and stripers. They were mainly small fish with an occasional 2-3 lb white and few 4-6 lb stripers (which were small for stripers). For over an hour straight we caught doubles as fast as we could get the fish off our line and back in the water. This is NOT normal! We fish here in the Ozarks all winter long, and vertical jigging spoons can be alot of fun if you find the right feeding fish. Most of the time we drive around looking for bait fish and then active fish feeding in the schools over old river channels typically out in the middle of the lake. If we get a bite that lasts 15 minutes to half hour we are lucky. I call it video fishing...lot fishermen can't stand the hunting process and just want to go fishing. Good graph is a must and lots of patience. Last week was unbelievable and probably a once in a lifetime bite...at least for me, and I have fished alot.ro"
544266,Pooch,2004-11-24 17:31:00,4619,"Wind blowing across the lake for several days, fish concentrated on the rocky shoreline and they would hit a bare jig even without a tail left on it. Another time early evening and we hit a concentration of fish on the corner of a sharp drop off. Both times fish were all smaller than average and they were on a feeding bing. Truthfully I'd rather catch a few nice walleye than a ton of ""not quite eaters"". It is fun from time to time to get into them like that. Usually when it has happened to us you can bet the fishing will be poor the next day. One hundred fish each happens from time to time but not as often as some say. One hundred ""in the boat"" for two guys is a pretty decent day on most lakes. When we get into them fast and furious we usually move around that same area looking for larger fish. Pooch"

544275,Guest,2004-11-25 18:45:00,0,"Myself and an older fella-70's who had only caught one eye in his long life were fishing up the Pipestone River north of the village of Pickle Lake. It was May 25th. 02 snow to our knees have the pics of the snow. We kept track for just one hour and not using a net put 52 in the boat--all males all about the same size had another 30 plus come off not using a net and not really wanting them in the boat. This was for one hour not a full day. Most will not believe this BUT I see a few here who have and will believe. As Back water Eddy mentioned ths was a river system below a good falls and the BOYS were piled in there waiting for the ladies. We were using a jig with a plastic twister tail mostly white. len clare, michigan 1100 mile trip one way and worth every mile"
544286,Hawker,2004-11-27 07:03:00,3967,"Sure!! Matter of fact had one of those ""days"" just yesterday. Fished off the bank in an area that is bank fishing only and caught hybrids, stripers and sand bass on almost every cast for the first four hours and the rest of the day was another fish for every two to four casts. 100 fish days???? You betcha!! Hawker"
544300,Guest,2004-11-28 14:50:00,0,"They are possible, but unless a person has a good way to keep track, I think many are exaggerating. I bought a hale bale counter from Mills Fleet that is in my boat by my counsole. Since I bought the counter, I have not had a 100 fish day. Pleanty of 50 fish days, but never a 100. Not that I ever thought I had a 100 fish day, but I do think that many of the 50 fish days I had pre counter were more like 30ish... Tom B"
544303,Guest,2004-11-28 16:16:00,0,"Back in 87' I went to Quebec with my wife's family for 4 days of waldorf fishing. Since there was no electric or freezers, the 6 of us waited until the last day to take home our 10 walleyes apiece back to PA. We were pretty confident of doing it because we were nailing about 120 per boat per day on mostly just bucktail jigs, no bait or twister tails!! Having some of the Gulp minnows and Mr. Twister they have these days may have resulted in many more but the small walleye then probably had trouble getting a big jig into their mouth, so we caught very few. I remeber having 3,4 bites a cast many times til I actually hooked the fish. My wife's brother caught one walleye after another one day on a Johnson Silver Minnow with a 6"" purple firetail worm on there as he was attempting to catch pike. Imagine having to fillet 60 walleye all over 18"" and then taking an 18 hour car ride back to PA. When the camp owner saw that many big walleye at one time, he was very excited and he made us show him where we caught them and then took pictures for next year's brochure. With Indian netting going on at the lake I don't feel we dented the population at all, and the owner said it was nothing to take the limit home. Now I would probably take my limit of smaller walleye home but at the time since so many were that size we didn't think anything of it."
544312,lobo1,2004-11-29 04:54:00,734,"our fly-ins have had plenty of 100+ fish per day per person. sure we lose track and we all like to exaggerate a bit but when you can get a fish on every jig drop it dont take long. I had 16 consecutive fish on 16 casts and lost the contest for most fish on consecutive casts. we catch em like that until we decide to move or big pike come in and shut em down (when the fun begins - gator hunt). mostly small males 15-20"" - like eddy said. sure spoils a guy. Cant take my kids up there - they'll never want to fish at home again. lobo1"
544315,Guest,2004-11-29 09:19:00,0,100 fish days are common in our group. All my friends have them and they let me hold some of the bigger ones so I can have my picture taken.
544329,Guest,2004-11-29 15:09:00,0,"You bet! 100 fish days on Lac Seul is easily attainable if you know what you're doing, some days even if you have no clue. Super aggressive males in the spring are the best ticket for crazy action. In spring 2001, another guide and I pitched 3/8 oz. jigs with white twister tails into shallow water in a tiny cove and caught 122 walleyes in one hour!! So 61 each, or just over 1/minute. Every fish was 1-2 lbs. The jig rarely hit the bottom, or at the most one or two jigs. Keep in mind, this was our specific goal, to catch as many as possible in a one hour stretch, and these are two professional walleye guides, pitching, hooking, landing and releasing as fast as possible. In a normal year, a boat can expect to experience this level of action a few times/spring, more if you're better experienced and can hit the right spot at just the right time with the right conditions. I've experienced this level of action several times on Lac Seul, but often with guests who aren't as adept. That was the only time with just another guide where we actually kept track. Often, if you hit one of these spots, it doesn't stay fast and furious for that long. You fish it out and/or the action decreases somewhat. I guess we got lucky in the particular instance mentioned above. Everyday on the water I log fish caught in my boat over 18"", and have several days each summer with close to 100 fish logged (that is just those 18""+). I don't even track those under 18""."
544235,Guest,2004-11-22 21:47:00,0,"See a lot of reports of 100-150 fish days. Really? If you are on the water 12 hours per day that's a fish in the boat about every 7 minutes - all day long. Factoring in time for fighting fish, moving from spot to spot, freeing snags, having to re-tie a hook/lure, taking photos, stopping to watch/help your partner fight a big one, unhook that one that swallowed the hook, re bait etc, etc, etc I think most the 100+ per person claims are an exageration. I'm sure they happen on occasion but rarely! Am I wrong?"
544239,Mahumba,2004-11-23 07:37:00,345,I think there are more than one person in the boat. maybe two or three people. Roger Mayer.
544243,Guest,2004-11-23 12:30:00,0,"yes, i'm sure those are per boat catches. 100-150 walleye per guy per day would really keep you hopping."
544248,Guest,2004-11-23 16:10:00,0,"My personal best has been 96 walleye in about 8 hours fishing. Second best was 94. Don't remember the nortnerns, but quess I had a few hammer handles mixed in which would have put me over a hundred fish. But that's been a few years ago."
544249,Guest,2004-11-23 16:53:00,0,"I have had 100 fish ""in the boat"" days in Lac Seul. I usually fish two per boat so that is about 50 fish per guy."
544251,Dano,2004-11-23 17:04:00,83,"Usually I dont keep count, but one day I remember we had over 200 fish caught between my Dad and I, we were out for more than 12 hours though. For short duration, the best I have seen was 40 in one hour by my friend Earl. They are rare for sure, but when they happen, man it is unreal!"
544252,Guest,2004-11-23 21:01:00,0,The end of June I was guiding two octegenarians and their 55 year old daughter. The wind was blowing about 40 mph and they couldn't put the minnows on so I know I put at least 96 minnows on their hooks and I know we caught more than one walleye per minnow so it must have been a hundred walleye day. I caught two 8 pounders out of the bunch. 100 walleyes is alot with two hours for shorelunch and traveling around Lake of the Woods.
544254,jerry bark,2004-11-23 21:47:00,822,"i have no doubt it happens with two in the boat, hard work and long days on a good lake and it will be there. last june my partner and i hit a hot spot at about 9:30 in the morning, we pulled off at noon or so. i had bought four dozen minnows for my end of the boat and was running out so i switched to a curly tail and kept on catching. i am sure i went well over 50 that spot alone, since i was often getting bit before the jig hit the bottom again, plus other fish on other spots throughout the day. so the next morning we tried that spot again and i decided to keep count, well i lost track at 38 and the bite was slower, though we stayed on the spot longer. sometimes you just get lucky and find yourself on a big school. those fish went 12-18 inches with most around 14. is 100 fish true: yes do i expect it to happen again next time: maybe... if the weather is the same, i'll definately try that spot!!"
544255,Backwater Eddy,2004-11-24 06:49:00,3871,"I have seen it mostly on pre-spawn on rivers with a ton of males all congregated in a tight area. They hit about anything you toss out at times. Rarely you may bump into a bite in the fall where fish are stacked in an area where a pair of anglers can pull hi numbers in an outing. I did 100 with a client once at night and again a few years latter on a hot spring bite during the day. May never happen again, who knows? Sure a hoot when it does though. From what I hear Black Duck in MB is a place where 100 a day is not too hard to do when they are hitting well. Ed ""Backwater Eddy"" Carlson ""ED on the RED"" ><,sUMo,>"
544256,Guest,2004-11-24 08:09:00,0,We fish two in a boat and measure a 'good' fly-in boat by 100 fish days. We hover on top and around rock reef structures with jigs all day. We have 100 fish mornings on our 'favorite' fly-in lake - no kidding. Sure some are doinks and some are 4-7 pounders. One 'perfect' walleye weather morning I caught 14 fish on the first 11 jig drops...Three 6-8 lb pike held onto the walleye into the net. 3 pike and 11 walleyes. Took a lot of pics that morning! BTW - the key to getting that pike into the net is to stay quiet - don't hoot and holler and let the pike think he is winning - very little pressure - slow and easy. 100 fish days happen a lot the way we fish - fast and furious while the school is hot - then move the another rock - if you are riggin or pulling harnesses the numbers will be generally less.
