I'm not sure if its legal to pull my boat behind my 5th wheel, like we can in Montana. I'm mostly interested in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Thanks."
518588,Guest,2002-03-26 05:54:00,0,It is legal as long as you are not going into British Columbia. There is a maximum length (maybe 60 ft) but I am not exactly sure what it is.
