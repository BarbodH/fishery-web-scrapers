518586,Northern Manitoban,2002-03-26 04:38:00,195,A few years back trophy length for a Laker here in Manitoba was 38 now it is 35.Myself i find it to easy to catch 35 inchers where i'm fishing i think it would be more of a challenge if they left it at 38.The designated picture lenght for laker is 41 inches.FISH ON.
518576,Guest,2002-03-25 09:02:00,0,Just wondering what is a generally acceptable length and/or weight of a Laker that is considered of trophy proportions.Thanks.
518577,Northern Manitoban,2002-03-25 09:12:00,195,A Manitoba trophy Laker is 35 inches and would weigh about 16 pounds and bigger.During the fall when they spawn and are full of eggs they can really put on the weight.I caught a 31 incher last fall that weighed 14 pounds.FISH ON.
518582,Guest,2002-03-25 13:49:00,0,"In MB, trophy size is calculated by length-not weight. The length to qualify for master angler trophy is 41""."
518583,Guest,2002-03-25 13:51:00,0,"Pike is 41"" and laker(previous post is correct) is 35""."

518584,lobo1,2002-03-25 14:08:00,734,what is it for walleye ?
518585,stewart,2002-03-25 15:36:00,100,"70 cm, or 28"" for walleye in Manitoba. 32"" is the designated picture length(the fish must be photographed, or it won't make the 'book')"
518579,Piscatorian,2002-03-25 18:50:00,12,"It kind of depends where you are...some people in Ontario consider a 30"" fish a trophy. Manitoba recognizes 35"", but that's about the average size in some places further west and north. Personally, I consider a 30 pounder to be a trophy which would typically be about a 39"" fish, although it varies quite a bit."
518580,Guest,2002-03-25 21:22:00,0,Hard to catch smaller than 35in a lot of days in prime time.
518581,Piscatorian,2002-03-25 21:30:00,12,"Just curious, when do you consider to be prime time there? What depth range are you fishing that time of year?"
