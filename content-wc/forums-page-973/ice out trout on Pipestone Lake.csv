517994,Guest,2002-03-08 06:44:00,0,I have a trout fishing trip planned for arrival the day after the ice is out on Pipestone Lake. My last trip was about 12 years ago for these guys. We always worked the surface waters with the rapala family. Does anybody have any other good ice-out trout methods that we could try?guide#7 out

517996,Xplorer,2002-03-21 10:54:00,244,"Guide #7, Some friends of mine that fish ice-out in the Atikokan area have had success running spinner rigs with salted minnows in the shallows in the past few years. Maybe try them on a planer board to limit the spooking factor. Good luck. Xplorer"
517997,lenray,2002-03-21 14:28:00,467,I fish a very remote trout lake every May and we use the Rattle-trap with the beebies in them BUT when the ice just goes out and those trout are up it really doesn't matter what you toss. A buddy gave me a gag gift it is a Molson botle cap used as a spinner with a hook below it also brings them into the boat.len

517999,Guest,2002-03-22 16:56:00,0,Nothing will beat a floated cisco off the bottom for ice out on Pipestone .
518000,Fitch,2002-03-22 21:20:00,75,If your looking for a good place to stay for your trip. This is one. And Spring trout fishing is great with a nice fire sitting on a point with a cisco sitting off bottom. When the line goes tight you have one of the best fits every. Just grab that rod and set the hook. Give it a try on your trip. Check out www.happylandingfishing.com Good luck. Looking like a late ice out.
