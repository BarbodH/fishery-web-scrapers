516784,Guest,2002-02-05 19:26:00,0,"I have just taken ""considerable time"" to read all of the postings above. It makes me super proud to be a canadian and extremely thankful I am. It however saddens me to see some of the animosity shown here. I can only guess that it is because of some bad experiences by citizens of both our great countries. I too know what it is like to be fishing in a country other than my own. I had the good fortune to fish lake havasu in arizona a couple of winters ago. I found all the u.s. fisherman to be just fine, in a very short time it was hard to tell who was not a long time buddy. (cept for the occasional"" 'eh "", which set me apart) And to the fellow who slammed catching bass etc. down south, I can only guess that you have never had the pleasure of trying to land one. I was real impressed with the performance of ""stripers"" , they are one H of a fish. believe it or not they even taste like walleye. ( I can only base this on having caught walleye for the last 50 years) don't get me wrong in what I am trying to say. the bottom line here is . LETS ALL TRY TO UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER AND ENJOY WHAT TIME WE HAVE IN THE GREAT OUTDOORS."
516777,Guest,2002-02-05 19:43:00,0,"River eyeYou're right. Two wrongs don't make a right and I apologize for appearing to paint your country with a wide, negative brush. That was not my intent. I have seen absolutely beautiful parts of your country and I have seen the other side as well. As far as not knowing much about your country, I will say that I have spent about 30 weeks up there over the past 20 years. No, that doesn't make me an expert but I know what I've seen and experienced. In and around the towns of Atikokan and Wawa mostly. In Atikokan, the outfitter parks our car in his private lot in the middle of town and he has installed an 8' fence with barb wire on the top surrounding the entire lot. I doubt that its there to keep cars in at night. And yes, the locks are there too. My point is that much like the US, Canada has its own set of problems, both societal and economic. We, the US and Canada are more similar than some would like to admit. The biggest difference is that you have millions of good fishing lakes and we don't. That will always attract large numbers of fishermen from the US and you can relax, most will be less ignorant than me.As far as the comment about not going to Canada if it weren't for the fish, your'e right, I stand corrected. Of the 30 weeks I've been up there, I spent one week in Toronto and one week in BC on vacation and didn't fish at all. Great cities, BTW. Now, would I have gone the other 28 weeks if it wasn't for the fish, I'll have to ponder that one for a while, I'm kinda slow, as you pointed out."

516789,Guest,2002-02-13 09:11:00,0,"Hey everybody - we should all reflect on some of the bad things which have happened over the past 8 months and realize that in a big and unfriendly world, the USA and Canada have, if nothing else, EACH OTHER!! We have a common history, shared values and a shared love of the outdoors. Yes Canada has different rules and regulations than those in the USA but so what - we are a sovereign country and we make our own laws. The USA does the same thing and as is their right, does not take into consdieration Canada's view when making American law. Certainly some of these Border crossing rules are stupid and unreasonable but as a person involved in the tourism industry in Canada we are trying to get our Customs and Immigration to ease up a bit.I can tell you when I recently crossed at International Falls, MN, US Immigration grilled me for over 10 minutes - where was my mother born, where was my father born, where was I born etc. I had to fill out a form answering 7 questions related to any criminal record I may have had etc - so it is essentially the same ""hassle"" or process for us when we are crossing into the USA. I for one had no problem with it as I feel it is a privilege to visit the United States - not a ""right"".Think about what is going on in Afghanistan. There is an International Force of mostly European countries acting as peacekeepers in Kabul. Then there are the Canadian and American Forces at the Airport in Kandahar working together (and, God forbid, maybe even dying together!)rooting out the remaining SOBs from Al-Qaeda and the Taliban. To me anyway, this exemplifies what we have in common. When the Sh** hits the fan, I can't think of anything we as Canadians probably would not do in support of the USA in regards to September 11th. Mutual respect is what its all about. 99.5% of Canadians love people from the United States and welcome them to our country - but we are a country so there will be laws and other things different than in the USA. I always wonder why any US citizen would want us to be ""just like the USA"" - it would take some of the fun out of the trip don't ya think?Stop worrying about the jerks who are vocal against the USA and its people - they are inconsequential up here and do not represent average Canadians. You are welcome to fish, hunt and visit anytime. September 11th has made me think about what's important in life and about who we can count on in the world. I think we (Canadians) can count on the USA. I also think (and hope) that most Americans feel they can count on Canada - cause ya can! So stop being so negative! Come on up and have a really good time eh!"

Point is that your little one or two week experience in either country is hardly a scientific poll. It's pretty important that you show pride, via your words and deeds, for your country, and respect for another country ('specially when you are in it).

Why do we keep going back? 1) The strong friendships that we have established with the people we have met. From the lodge owners to the tackle shops. 2) The fabulous fishing. My Dad has caught the biggest fish of his 72 years, a 41 in. 20 lb. northern, and to see the big smile on his face and how excited he was while battleing that fish, man that memory will last a lifetime. 3) The wildlife. The moose, the bears, the bald eagles and the loons. Oh them loons. Love to hear those loons.

It can't be said any better than that!!!!!!!!!!!!!I would just like to add to what you are saying, if I may, in that................We were IN Canada, fishing, when the WTCs got hit!! Foreigners' in your country with the borders CLOSED! I've had the good fortune to have traveled to quite a few places around the world and this was the first time I got scared! We couldn't get back to our homeland, if we wanted to. And that is a very scary thought!! But........BUT!!! The out pouring of emotions from the Canadian people and the Canadian Media was almost overwelming! The folks at the resort went out of there way to do whatever they could to comfort and accomodate us. No one had a clue as to when we might be able to leave!! Moreover, half of us were from the Pittsburgh, Pa. area and the other half from Philadelphia! We all now know where those planes hit/went down but no one was sure at this time and we didn't know (no one knew) if others were going to crash nor where, obviously. One of the reports stated that one of the planes, "".....went down in Southwest Pennsylvania, South of Pittsburgh""!!!!!!!!! Three of us live there!!! Fortunately (or UNfortunately) it had gone down more to the East and South. The News Media was reporting the FACTS as best they could - no politics whatsoever! True emotions shone on their faces and gravel scratched in their voices the true fabric of Canada bared itself to us and it was extremely emotional and touching!! And we couldn't keep it together when we saw the Queen of England and the Canadian leaders singing OUR National Anthem in YOUR country and in YOUR house of worship WITH OVER 25,000 folks outside of the Cathedrel singing, too!!!!!!!! We couldn't hold it together!More than that we had the chance to leave on Saturday, Sept. 15. I cannot begin to tell you what it meant to us old Vets to see nearly ever vehicle, on our way down through Canada, with an AMERICAN FLAG streaming from it - They were EVERYWHERE!!!!!!!!!!! It was awesome!But...............Ya' know??

516783,chrism,2002-02-04 20:53:00,429,"Fishing is fishing no matter where you are. I'm Sure there are places on either side of the border that can fullfill our needs. To me, there is no ""border"" when it comes to fishing, but we do have to respect the laws of the place we are ""visiting"" - whether it be a town/city/county/or country. It goes both ways over the 49th....My personal opinion is that people come to ""wherever"" to fish because that is what they want- whether it be remoteness, big fish, the resort, whatever - as they say, ""go knock yourself out!"" It is a free world on either side of the border, and everybody is welcome on either side, albeit a bit harder for those who may have had a slip up in their past - and to those I say don't give up, please understand why the laws were made, and don't let them bring you down or worse yet make you not want to fish an area.I welcome all visitors to my area, no matter where they are from - however, there are dipshiots everywhere, and it is those who I choose to fish away from! I am a Canadian resident, and I will say I have met lot of people from all over fishing the same waters - and it has been my experience that my southern neighbors do have different views on many things, and it generates great discussion in the boat or in the fillet shack! Nobody is right or wrong, we are just expressing our views and opinions.... But we all catch fish and share the same experience, and have a memorable day(s) that last us till next season. I have learned from them and I hope they have learned from me. To me, that is what it is all about.Ok, time to tie a few more spinners..."

It seems through this post and just about any other that you reply to, you seem to take it personal when Americans talk about the hassle of crossing the border. I was just wondering if you are a border guard or the reason you take it so personally? I wonder what makes you so defensive? Instead of looking at it as US vs Canada, why not just look at it as all of us outdoorsman. Yes, I realize that there are Americans that are a**holes, but there are also Canadians that break the rules as well. How much nicer would this world be if instead of being interested in borders, we were more interested in fishing and hunting? This is why I believe the ""antis"" have such an easy time with sportsmen and women. We fight so much amongst ourselves that we can never muster up the same amount of fervor as the ""antis.""

Some people are allowed through if they pay a $200 ""fee"" that allows them in for a short period of time. One can go through a lot of paperwork to be considered ""rehabilitated"" nut this paperwork can take up to a year to get done. That in a nutshell is the hassle. It can also be something other than DWI but it seems that DWI has received most of the attention. Like it or not, those are the rules. Will everyone with a DWI be stopped. No, but it could happen and thus the hassle."

Then why the original post? You claim to want to know but then say you couldn't care less. What's the point here?I've been reading, with much amusement, the 216 reply post on DWI in which you have been actively involved and have seen your antagonistic attitude towards US fishermen. Did you post this one just to stir up more crap?For over 20 years our group went to Canada and we've seen most of the beautiful lakes, loons, etc. that others in this post are commenting on but we have also seen the miles and miles of clear cut, stripped forests, the roadside dumps, the small towns with high unemployment where doors are double and triple locked and the main event of the evening is to get tanked at the local bar and go watch the bears at the local dump. If people want to delude themselves into thinking Canada is heaven on earth, so be it. Lets face it, Canada has been blessed with much better fishing than typically found in the states but if it wasn't for the fishing, who would bother going to your fair country? Our group decided several years ago to stay in the US and haven't regretted it one time. Now we go to the Gulf of Mexico deep sea fishing or fishing for 5-10 lb bass in the southern US and we don't have to cross any borders or put up with condescending attitudes like yours from the customs agents. They act like they are doing us a favor by letting us in. Luckily, most Canadians seem to have much more mature attitudes and do care about the tourist trade and I miss some of the good people at some of the outfitters. I will always remember the good times our group had up there, but staying in the US is much simpler and hanging out with the guys for a week is much the same in a cabin in the US as it is in Canada. If you really want to know, this might might make a good poll question: ""How many would travel to Canada if there was no fish?"""
516779,Guest,2002-02-04 07:06:00,0,"Personally I have never had any hassles crossing.My two cents: When you get behind the wheel under the influence you are taking a huge risk, to yourself and to others. Included in these risks is the chance of getting picked up and cited for DUI. No matter how old you are, you know the risksand the consiquences that go with them. Age should not be a factor in something so serious. People make mistakes, especially when they're young and should be forgiven, but how anyone can expect a foreign country to change one of their laws, for a US citizen, is hard for me to understand. The percentage of US citizens crossing the border who have had a DUI has got to be a very low number. Why we should expect Canadians to spend their time for a very small number of US citizens seems quite selfish to me, probably the same reason the DUI was issued in the first place.I love every moment of my trips to Canada exept the drive home."
516780,Guest,2002-02-04 09:32:00,0,"llg: Personally, I too have never had a problem crossing the border. Were you around in the 60's or 70's? Things were much different back then, and DWI certainly was NOT the issue then that it is today. It was very common for the police to simply give a person a ride home if they were in too bad of shape to drive. On the other hand, some got charged. Am I defending DWI....no, I'm just trying to give you some perspective on the way life was back then....driving around with a couple of beers under your belt was pretty well accepted. It was as wrong then as it is now, and I'm glad that the change in the laws and everyones awareness has occured...but condemning someones past behavior based on todays social awareness is kinda fuzzy math. NO ONE is suggesting that the Canadians change their laws for recent offenders, the rub is enforcing the rules for decade old offenses, especially when the ""guilty"" party has been clean for decades. I'm glad that none of your group has ever had troubles in the past....maybe you'd better double check just to make sure! With the new technology at the Border Guards fingertips, they can cue up anything that has EVER gone down in the past....and not just DWIs either! Maybe somebody neglected to pay for a speeding offense or 2 or 3 parking tickets one time long ago while they were up in Montreal. We have all heard the stories of someone ripping up a ticket as soon as the the officer from another country goes on his way (both Canadian and US I might add).It could be true that the number of Border Xing DUIs are comparitively small......but if one happens to be in your gang of guys, on your way up to the bush to fish and have a good time....you'd better believe that it could easily ruin a good time if he happens to get hauled aside. If that makes me a selfish person, I stand accused and tried and convicted...not on my record but on that of one of my best friends in the world, who is a decent, law abiding and sober fisherman who wants to fish -w- his buddies in Canada. 17 years ago...... that's the problem."

516759,Guest,2002-02-02 16:36:00,0,"I have a ton of long time fiends in Saskatchewan. About 30 years of goose hunting and about that many fishing there has enabled me to get to know a large contingent of really fun people. It is like ""old home week"" when I go to Saskatchewan. Sometimes I go and don't even hunt or fish..just visit my good friends.Hehehe.. I take them fishing when they come and visit me in the states, too.Wish the border wasn't there, to tell the truth. I used to know all the folks at customs where I cross, and it was much more pleasant to cross. Now, things are less friendly on both sides of the white line on the pavement. But my buddies are waiting on the other side....and they have not changed!"
516764,Backwater Eddy,2002-02-03 07:22:00,3871,"What once brought us to Canada was the fishing, no hastle vacations, and the good times.With the increasing hastle to get in and out of Canada many of us now re-set our plans to fish south of the border, here in the USA. Erie sound good to me come to think of it?It is a ""Hot"" topic at the sports shows by the way Canadian Guy.Yes, it's a bummer we will miss it. Who needs all that hastle while on vacation anyway?We will spend our cash here instead, our resorts need cash flow too."
516765,Reels,2002-02-03 07:48:00,2876,"Eddie, what kind of hastles are you talking about? Just curious. Also, were are you entering?<{{}}><"
516766,Guest,2002-02-03 13:14:00,0,LOL Eddy...I fished southern Ontario for many years and fished Erie and Lake St Clair for Walleye and Perch. The fishing is great down there. The fish run bigger as well. Many of us including myself could care less if US fisherman chose to stay home because he wants to spend his cash in the US or dislikes the task of crossing our borders. This is your choice. The economy will not crash here because US fisherman stay home.
516743,Guest,2002-01-30 14:50:00,0,Please share your feelings on why Americans come to Canada. Thanks for all positive replies in advance.

516747,Guest,2002-01-30 15:52:00,0,I second his reply. He hit it right on the head. You Canadians have no idea how lucky you are ... and I keep telling you folks that every summer when I come up to fish.
516748,Reels,2002-01-30 19:13:00,2876,"Because I cant understand the Mexicans...Seriously,It always humbles me to be in what I call God's country. It is the way he made the earth with little change. I live near Chicago, and I have to tell you, it can be a rat race. To get away and relax, see an eagle fly next to your boat, and oh yea, catch some great fish you cant get anywere in the world, that is what brings me a few weeks a year.I often have a tear in my eye when I have to go home. (A manly tear of course)<{{}}><"
516749,phidelt157,2002-01-30 19:45:00,191,A fly in trip to Ontario is the only place in the world that I have been where you can sit at the end of the dock and hear absolutely nothing at all.

I like to tease some of our Canadian friends that we got the better end of the deal when the glaciers scooped out the Canadian lakes and deposited all of that good soil in my backyard. We ended up with lots of fragile but good topsoil and a great place to go fishing. I have lots of reasons for liking Canada and Her people but this post is long enough. Oh yeah, did I mention the people of Canada?Good question.Pooch in Central Illinois"
516754,Guest,2002-01-31 07:05:00,0,"Fish. If it wasn't for the fish, who'd bother going?"
