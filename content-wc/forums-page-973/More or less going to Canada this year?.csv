Some guys have had to switch jobs and lost vacation time, some lost good jobs for not-so-good jobs, etc. Our group is staying in the states like last year. The six of us are from across 4 states and its not so much where you go but who you go with. The fishing experience is different but no better or worse. We just look forward to the trip. We'll probably go back for a fly-in again in a year or two if things don't get any worse than they are now. Its no so much the cost but the 18 hour drive each way and trying to get vacation schedules arranged, etc. There is something about the Canada trips that keep calling us back."
518418,Guest,2002-03-21 17:06:00,0,What a year without catching walleyes one after another. I will move into a tent and stop eating and drinking before i stop this trip. Well you gotta drink!
518419,Seanik,2002-03-21 20:18:00,218,"We began the annual fishing trip into Ontario at The Peace Bridge last Aug. Encountered Newly minted eager female Custom agents who checked us down to the last toothpick. 30mins. later after 50 polite ma'ams and that have a great day crap we were on our way. Got on the QEW,white knuckled the wheel, painted on the 70 mph bumper to bumper stare and zipped around Toronto on our way North. Us old geezers in Pa wouldn't miss going on our Canadian fishing trip for nothing, probably do our last trips out of a nursing home."
518407,Pooch,2002-03-20 15:54:00,4619,"Last year the numbers crossing the border heading for Canada were down. Is that going to continue this year? No big deal, just thinkin'.Pooch"
518408,Thumper,2002-03-20 16:24:00,133,"I think that because of the mini recession people are in that lots are staying closer to home. I also some some OMNR data that fishing is actually declining especially in the younger population. I think the reasons are multi but a general tendancy for a decrease. People travel lots in the winter as well now where in the ""old days"" the annual family trip was a summer one. IMHO"
518410,duffy,2002-03-20 18:03:00,49,I'm coming. wouldn't miss it!!!!!!!!
518409,Piscatorian,2002-03-20 19:53:00,12,"I agree. Numbers will be down this year and maybe even more next year. Lots of people have had their retirement funds disappear into the stock market. I also know a fair number of people who are unemployed right now. A lot of them are people with some experience who were cut for cheaper, less experienced people. Lodges are going to feel the hurt."
518411,Guest,2002-03-21 07:43:00,0,"I'm going to! lets face it, its still the cheapest vaction going."
518412,Guest,2002-03-21 08:11:00,0,"I have given that question a little thought since several people that I know are not going north on their annual fly-in trips. First the guys in there twentys and early thirties just getting going with a young family are finding it harder to leave a wife and a kid or two at home as he goes off on a trip. After his part of the gas, motel and license he will drop a $1000. The ambitious ones who did side jobs to help fund the trip don't have the extra work and overtime they had in the past. Several of the retired seniors are now only getting 2.5% on their CDs where they were getting from 5 to 7%. The guys that I see that are still going are in ther 40's and 50's and pretty well estabished in their life and jobs and their wifes work also. From my area I knew of over 50 guys going some years to around 20 this year."
518413,Randy,2002-03-21 08:28:00,53,Its a shame to think that fisherman who love to enjoy the beauty and reverance of fishing Canada wont be able to go for economic reasons. The group that I go with has been going north for 24 years and two of the six have withdrawn this year because of gliches in their investments and health problems that insurance was UNABLE to cover. I also believe that the Canada experience is getting a little expensive for the working faimly man. Not to many years ago we could go to a great lake for a week and only spend $300 a man....seems that the price has at least doubled or more. Not many of our incomes have doubled during the same period and Im sure retirement payments havent either. I hope this is not a trend because if it is the Reort owners will take it in the shorts and the quality of service will diminish....guess thats the way free enterprise works.
518414,Guest,2002-03-21 14:16:00,0,"We just cancelled our annual Ontario trip because of this border crossing DWI problem. I have also heard no beer allowed ion boats or that they have ow started enforcing an old law,which I have no problem with, just that none of us want to spend our vacation paranoid. Been doing it for toooo many years to change. will be fishing northern MN. I already know of at least 10 groups of people who have cancelled bcause one or more of thier group had dwi's and not willing ot pay the 200.00 bribe at the border. Now we are not the type of guys who like to get drunk out in the boat but do enjoy a cold one now and then during a long day of fishing, just wanted to state that. If I wanted to have someone tell me not to drink beer I could just bring the wife along. I doubt any of us will ever enter Canada again until they settle down a bit. Lots of good fishing in the lower 48. I think resort owners will suffer."
518415,Arkie eye jerker,2002-03-21 14:58:00,228,"I don't go to Canada on a yearly basis, but have made several trips and enjoyed all of them(One was the best vacation of my life, My wife and another couple spent a week on LOTW). But like some of the others, the economy has me looking at alternatives. I think my buddy and I will go to Minnesota this year, at a substantial savings. (also he had a DWI 16 years ago). From what I've read I think we will have a great vacation, but I'll let you know more on that after the trip. It's kind of strange how people are. I used to go to Florida every year bass fishing. While at the fishing camp the owner found out where I lived and said ""You come down here every year for your vacation and I go to Arkansas every year Redear Brim fishing for my vacation."" Come to find out the lake he went to was just a few miles from where I lived. We probably all live in what somebody else would consider a vacation spot, but I think it is just the Week of getting away and finding something different we look for.Regards,Ed Gray"
518417,Rat,2002-03-21 15:33:00,102,The only reason I would not be going is if I'm dead. Hope that does not happen because Canada may be more fun than heaven.
