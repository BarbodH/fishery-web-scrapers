518309,Guest,2002-03-18 14:56:00,0,"Taking my two Grandsons to Canada this June for some Walleye fishing. I have never been Walleye fishing before. I got the boys each a Bass Pro Bionic Blade 6-6 med lgt rod and Shiamno Spirex spinning reel. I need to know what is the best brand and weight of line for Walleye jigging. We are going on a guided fly in around Thompson,Manitoba so the boys should have plenty of action. I really appreciate your help....Thanks"
518310,Guest,2002-03-18 15:27:00,0,Go with a good all purpose line. Berkley tournament 8 to 10lb. will do the trick.
518311,Peanut,2002-03-18 15:33:00,929,"I would suggest Berkley Fireline, 10 lb. test. It is more expensive, but the greater sensitivity and strength are worth it, IMHO.If you go this route, be sure to put some mono backing on your Spirex reels before you spool on the Fireline. It prevents slipping, and also means you need fewer yards of the high-priced stuff.derrek.CANADIAN WALLEYE OPEN UP AND SAY ""EH""!"
518312,WillieB,2002-03-19 04:05:00,292,"I second Peanuts choice...and NEVER pull on the line with your bare hands to try to break it!! Use a scissors or sharp nippers, it'll cut into your fingers like you wouldn't believe."
518313,Guest,2002-03-24 09:33:00,0,Many anglers for Walleye will use a 6 LB test if mono. Its action is better than a heavier line like 10LB (especialy for small jigs). And it doesn't mean you can't catch 10 LB fish. Fireline 10LB has about a 4LB diameter which is good also.
518314,Northern Manitoban,2002-03-24 10:13:00,195,"Grampa what lake you flying into i live in Thompson.For my kids i give them 10 pound trilene,jigs will be 3/8 so they can feel bottom when jiging.The fishing up here is awesome good luck.FISH ON.www.westerncanadafishing.com/x-treme"

518316,Larry S,2002-03-25 17:28:00,666,"Grampa,Went to Pete and Geri's last year in August.Other friends went there in June and July.Can tell you different spots to fish,are you using a guide? If interested e-mail me at [email protected] I used 8lb test for all of my walleye fishing and it is sufficent Larry"
518317,Melonbob_ON,2002-03-25 19:35:00,61,"I personally would NOT recommend fireline for little kids, unless they do alot of fishing. snags with fireline can be a real pain, it cuts you easily, and can snap a rod with someone too eager to get a snag loose. Don't get me wrong, I love the stuff, but you have to be careful......Go with a good 6lb mono like silver thread for the little ones......(:"
