Way north is a fly in 135 miles north of red lake ontario and the fishing is great for trophy pike, walleye, and lake trout on five remote lakes accessible from the main camp. If you are interested e-mail me and I can give you details. [email protected]. Thanks.Duffy"

The water was really high and the fish just weren't going like normal. However, I may be interested in going on this deal. Obviously you know the lakes well. The one thing that I do remember is the size of one particular pike that followed my silver minnow from about 75' inside the thick reeds to the side of our boat. All I can say is holy @$$$%. I've seen some big muskies before. This thing was in the 30's. I swear! Anyway, how much to get in on this deal? If I'm correct, the flight in from Red Lake is part of the price also? Are these also some customers of yours or just fishin' buds? (218) 326-9642 Call me and let's talk details."

518095,Guest,2002-03-18 19:24:00,0,"Duffy,Wish i could go this year to get those monster pike like we had up there last year but the wife won't hear it this year. Please put me on the list for next year as I have to get my claws on those big northerns and walleyes again. Good luck this year (not that you need much luck up there)Tom"
