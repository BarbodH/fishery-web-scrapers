It certainly seems to reinforce the stereotype that fishermen do little more than get blasted on the water and that fishing is just a convenient excuse. Me? I once spent many an afternoon peeing sixpacks into the lake. Oh to be young again."
518508,Guest,2002-03-23 14:31:00,0,Many a fisherman is drinking on the water in our neck of the woods. We are not innocents by any means but try and keep it in line. There is a lot of partying that goes on with fishing. Way more drink than not drink...here anyways. The posts about ...how much do you bring...is pretty average for our groups that I associate with. I don't care if the guys are drinking their faces off...just do it safely.
