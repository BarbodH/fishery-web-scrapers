518292,tracker,2002-03-18 11:29:00,91,"If your heading west once you get into the Fort, there is the Red Dog Inn which is on your way out of the town, (807)274-7721 and if your heading east, the Rendez-Vous Hotel would be a good choice, (807) 274-9811."
518293,Guest,2002-03-18 14:11:00,0,"Be careful,we stayed there one night three years ago and during the night our boat was broken into and $3000 worth of fishing equipment GONE."
518294,Jigger1,2002-03-18 16:44:00,234,Alan - Which motel? (Hope it was an isolated situation) Tracker - We're headed to LacSeul so we'll be headed east in the morning.
518296,Guest,2002-03-18 17:29:00,0,"Been staying at Rendez-Vous Hotel twice a year for four years. Good motel with very reasonable rates. You're on the road (I go to Sioux Lookout) before most people cross the border. Never heard of any problems with theft, and the parking lot is jammed with vehicles and boats on Friday nights. Good coffee too."
518295,Illini Bob,2002-03-19 10:09:00,16,"We had the same problem in '98 at the Red Dog. They cut all the ropes on one side of the boat, fortunately we had almost everything in the truck. Nothing major taken(The beer was in the truck too)."
518297,Guest,2002-03-19 12:27:00,0,I cant comment on the border hotels but as far as the redlake and pickle lake hotels i my self would bring in your valuables (ie) money and beer into your hotel room. But make sure you stay up to watch the locals put on a entertaining wwf wrestling show!

518300,Fitch,2002-03-22 21:14:00,75,>bayview motel{807-274-5347}it will be cheaper than the >laplace rendez-vous {807-274-9811} One of the safest places for your boat will be the Rendez-vous www.rendezvoushotel.com/recreation.html. Owners are George and Paul. Both great people with a good staff. It is also a great place to stay if you want to do some walleye or small mouth fishing on Rainy. Most people drive past Rainy thinking it is fished out but since the slot size came in years back it has unbelivable fishing. Well have a good time on your stay.Fitch
