517078,WillieB,2002-03-15 13:59:00,292,"Would suggest contacting Mark Jones at Air Cochrane / Kesagami www.kesagami.comWe did a week at Unknown Lake for less than $600.Brand new boats, new 9.9hp motors.VERY accomodating people, and the first morning I watched my brother-in-law get 30 walleyes in one 30 minute drift...not bad!!Some nice sized pike in the weedbeds across from the cabin, and just and overall a great time...I'm sure I'll be booking with them again."
517079,Guest,2002-03-15 18:30:00,0,"Big Hook Camp, without a doubt!If its good enough for In-Fisherman, its good enough for me. Its a double fly-in that has pike up to about 42"" and walleyes that never seem to get full."
517076,Guest,2002-03-25 08:17:00,0,"So, how is the Musky fishing there? Is this suitable for kids (or women for that matter) ? ? Please advise..."
517074,Guest,2002-03-25 12:04:00,0,"Hey Seanik,I am booked to go to partridge/kesagami this june and would love some more info. I can be reached at [email protected] . Ron does seem pretty strict so I wouldn't mind a heads up as to how to handle this guy. Thanks again.Chromer"
517067,SWeed,2002-02-14 23:18:00,66,"Not sure where you are from so not sure if Northern Sask. would be of interest. Last year I was up to Lac La Ronge. Flew in and the entire trip was less than $600/person. Nice cabin, docks, boats, hospitality and the fishing was great. Walleye, Northerns and lake Trout.... Camp Kiniso on Lac La Ronge. It was a 1500 mile drive from Iowa, about 28 hours, Thats part ot the fun..."
517068,Dave,2002-02-21 07:22:00,258,"If you can get into one of Chimo's outposts (Red Lake), I recommend Hornby. I think a party of four is less than $700/person this year for housekeeping plan.Dave"

517069,4bigfish,2002-03-09 10:12:00,25,"I can help you with a great trip that will be perfect for you and your wife.www.4bigfish.comThanks,Mark[email protected]"
517070,outdoor fanatic,2002-03-09 14:05:00,90,"Try Everson's lodge on Lake Kabinakigami. I'm paying $615 for a week and while the accomodations aren't the Ritz, you do get plenty of solitude with hot showers, wood stove and a 30,000 acre lake that can produce tons of walleye, big northerns, good perch and excellent whitefish. Just my two cents, but I've never been disappointed. The price is right and it's not close to anything. NO TV, no radio, no newspapers. Just fishing, eating, sleeping (drinking if you wish) but I always feel refreshed when I come home."
517071,bullfroglabat,2002-03-14 19:43:00,226,There is an outfitter called Northern wilderness outfitters.http://www.northernwilderness.netI made three trips with them years ago and for the money they were great. they offer about 25 different lakes and all are under $800.00. They fly out of Ft. Frances.
517072,Seanik,2002-03-15 10:10:00,218,Recommendation that I thought I would never make:Fished out of Cochrane ONT. with Gardiner Air and went to Partridge /Kesagami Lake for 670.00 US. Ron the owner/pilot has a lot of camp rules but he's had some bad clients trash his equipment. The fishing on Partridge was excellent and with a portage to the boat cache on Kesagami SUPERIOR. Ron may seem a little different at first but hes a great guy and he brings in pie and ice cream as a treat while doing the midweek check. If anybodys interested I have some topo maps of the lakes.
517073,Guest,2002-03-15 10:15:00,0,Seanik - I would like to hear more about this location. you can email me at [email protected]. Thanks
517075,Guest,2002-03-15 13:02:00,0,"There are hundreds of great outpost in Ontario with varying price ranges. However, I would not over look Anderson's Lodge near Sioux Lookout, Ontario for the facilities or the prices. I have been going with them over the past several years up on Lac Suel and the accomodations, hospitality, and equipment are first class. They have four different outpost on Lac Suel and the fishing is fantastic. I'll be up there the last week in May, first week in June.eyesnatcher"
517077,Guest,2002-03-15 13:34:00,0,"I AND 3 OTHERS WENT TO KASHABOWIE OUTPOST LATE LAST JULY - AUG. THE CABINS ARE NICE OUTPOST CABINS ALL THE GAS YOU CAN BURN. LOTS OF NICE WALLEYE, NO REAL BIG ONES AND NICE PIKE. BY THE END OF THE WEEK WE CAUGHT WALLEYE ON DEAD BAIT. MY WIFE HAD A GREAT TIME AND WOULD GO BACK."
517056,TomPGrouse,2002-02-10 14:49:00,124,I am looking for opinions on a good fly in for about 800 bucks per person (no $3500 weeks need apply). We are interested in catching a goodly number of fish (walleyes and northerns) that are decent sized. Want to fly out of Ontario.Thanks
517057,Beeg,2002-02-10 15:57:00,9,I have some friends who have went with this outfitter to the Cobham River for several years now and spend around $750 per man. They go in a group of 6 to 8. I only go two per trip otherwise I might have tried it. I have seen their pictures and it sure looks like they catch plent. www.virtualnorth.com/sportsman/outposts.html
517058,Guest,2002-02-10 21:46:00,0,"Tom,I haven't heard from you so I am not so sure how serious you are about your trip. Let me tell you - just one thing about shopping camps - you have found ""the one"". Everybody is searching for ""it"" and once found - rarely gives ""it"" up - BUT you have found ""it"". Look into ""it"" a little more, make a few of the recommended calls etc.I have no stake whatsoever with these people - not even a free beer flight - this is honest info and I'm not into advertising for someone else.I gave you my home info and I'M sure Jack put you in touch with many other people.I originally got this info from a fishing show on ESPN and since have seen several others on the OUTDOOR CHANNEL. I am not a hipocrit. I have seen posts from others asking for ""honesty"" in the ""canada lodges and registration"" post knowing full well the poster gets free lodging for reeling people in. Don't get me wrong - Waynorth is a first class place !!If you don't like lodges go see Jack at Moc trails. If you like lodges, or have trouble putting together a group,See Sean at Waynorth.All I'm trying to say is that I'm trying to be objective.lobo"

517059,duffy,2002-02-11 10:53:00,49,"Steve,Are you acusuing me of something here? You know me, you know my intentions are pure and that i would never BS a fellow fisherman. I think you are accusing me of trying to sell the place I go to. Truth is I am friends with Bob and help him at sportshows but I have no financial interest in the place. I truly believe thats it's the best place to go and want to share it with others. Thats main purpose of this board is to help other fisherman based on experience whether it's a lodge or a good lure slection. But that's my opinion. You know that. Why would you accuse me of something else? I hope I mis-understand your post. Sean"
517062,NateW,2002-02-11 11:07:00,96,You mean to tell me all this time I've been recommending my favorite lodge for free??? Dang! If I'm not the stupid one!
517060,Guest,2002-02-11 21:20:00,0,"Sean, You do push the place pretty hard, no doubt there, but they have some EXCELLENT fishing there and is worth promoting and bragging about.I was kind of ticked with Tom when I sent that out and I sort of put the slam to you while trying to bolster my ""objectivity"" and I'm sorry.Tom hasn't been to Favourable or any of the others that Mocassin offers and when he was asking for further opinions - it blew my mind. Who would want to go somewhere else ? That fishing on Favourable might just be.........well who knows - but one of the best certainly.I don't post on Mocassin, I'm just not into advertising for others even though I know it's what many are looking for. I guess I expected that most anyone would jump at the place and for some reason it bothered me that Tom didn't. My apologies again Sean - and thanks for turning me on to Favourable.Steve"
517064,Guest,2002-02-13 05:11:00,0,"If you you only want to spend $800. and go to a fly-in, don't expect too much."
517065,Guest,2002-02-13 06:51:00,0,I disagree with the last quote. I have been going to Canada for the last 12 years and have never spent more than $775.00 on a fly-in. I have stayed at some very nice places and caught hundreds of walleyes and many 10 to 15 lb northern. You don't have to spend more money to find value. Check out Gawleys out of Ear Falls or Viking outpost out of Red Lake or Chimo's out of Red Lake. These are all established fly-in's. All for $800 or less. Nice cabins with hot and cold running water and showers. Good boats with swivel seats and all the gas you need. Also check out Canadian Fly-in fishing and a lake called Thicketwood. Big walleyes! Out of Red Lake. If you have questions e-mail me at [email protected].
517066,Larry L,2002-02-13 19:45:00,335,"Robby I would have to agree with you. There are great flyins out there that are reasonably priced. When I go I want good fishing and solitude. I don't go for hot showers, guides and guormet meals. I go to outpost camps in Saskatchewan. I can't help out with an Ontario camp though. I was only there once, and I went to a drive in lodge."
