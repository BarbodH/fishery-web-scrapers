The brochure and online website look good with some nice catches, but what can I expect? I am not looking for particular spots to fish, just a general idea of the fishery.ThanksSteve"

Have not been there for 6 years, but I heard the slot introduced 7 years ago has improved the walleye fishing. Always liked going there, alot of water to fish. Lakes not really big so you can fish during bad weather. Never fished alot on clearwater, mostly portaged south. I would check to see if portage passes are included in your package, they can be expensive. Never stayed at Trails end but bought gas there and the owner seemed nice enough.I have had better luck other places, it seemed the fishing got worse every year.But that was before the slot. Everyone fished with rigs. The best guides we found around there were Bob Baker and Jerry, and I would strongly recommened a guide. If you want to go after pike try Panaroama it takes some work to get there but it is worth the effort."
518192,Guest,2002-03-17 14:42:00,0,where did you stay when you fished that area?? ross resort?? if so what did you think of it
518193,Guest,2002-03-17 17:59:00,0,Pr7723 - I have had extensive experience with Ross' resort. What do you want to know?
518195,Guest,2002-03-18 19:39:00,0,"Never stayed at Ross camp but stayed at his outpost on Jackfish at sand point. Have stayed at Little Moose, White bear, the Hideway and at Wickstroms when it was open. Of the lot I liked White Bear best. Stayed at Wickstroms the most to save gas and avoid the portage. I belive Wickstroms is called Lake Despair lodge after reopening.The newer cabins there were pretty nice.Stopped by Ross a couple times for bait and gas, and the camp seemed nice enough. White Bear is probably the newest camp on clearwatwer, and when we were there it was quite nice."
518196,VMS,2002-03-19 10:29:00,1103,Where can I locate a hydro map for the lake system? I have been pulling my hair out trying to find something on the internet and have come up with nothing. Any help would be greatly appreciated!!ThanksSteve
518194,Guest,2002-03-24 13:18:00,0,"we stayed at rosses once, we had 5 boats and wanted him to guide us, he was booked. so he showed us a map and never pointed out the rocks in the mile river, 3 of our boats knocked the skags off and the others were dented. we asked about walleyes after that and all he put us on was small ones. we did catch some nice small mouth, and several small northerns. it was quite a trip to any place that seemed to hold fish between the portageing and the ride we lost a lot of fishing time every day. what kind of experience did you have there. we were thinking of giving it a try again. should we???"
