As many of you have I won a free trip to the Naughty Pines Resort, with the catch that I have to bring someone else along at $825 a pop. Split two ways it is not bad, but I would like to compare it with other resorts on the lake. Any info or should I just go to Lac Suel?"
518427,BD,2002-03-21 13:23:00,739,"IMHO Naughty Pines is not the place to go based on the fact that they must ""give away"" so called ""free"" trips each year. Think about it. If half the people in camp are there only because of a free trip, the other half of the guests are paying twice what they should or the place goes bankrupt. There are some fishermen whose opinions I trust that have given ""thumbs down"" to Naughty Pines. If you want to try the English River there are other places to go that are affordable and nice. I have been to Press Lake Camp near Ignace a few times and can recomend it. It is the only camp (only buildings) on the 9000 acre lake. They charge $165 US each person (4 person minimum per cabin) for housekeeping cabins. They also have nice campsites. Check the general discussion, Canada, and fishing reports archives for Press Lake and try their site at www.presslake.on.ca"

Boats at that time were just plain 16 ft lunds no seats etc. They treated you well, it's a boat in -so you have to leave your vehicle unattended for a week at the end of a dirt road. Anyway so they pick you up in a real nice deck boat drive you about 20 minutes downstream and a guy in an atv picks up your gear and drops it off at your cabin. for 400.00 a pc. probably ok seems like thats what i paid 10 years ago and we had the same offer (free trip). I know there are better deals out ther with this DWI border crossing thing resorts are starting to scramble for businees. We just cancelled our trip to Wabigoon the last week of June - Bonnybay resort.com I know they have an opening 390.00 ea for six of us with 3 bedroom 2 bath cabin and 3 17ft deluxe lund outfitters with everthing on them. included gas ,minnows and license. We are now heading to lake Vermilion in Minnesota. Good luck"
