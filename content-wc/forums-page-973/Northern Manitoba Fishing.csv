518267,Guest,2002-03-18 05:43:00,0,"Short one man to round out a 10 man trip to Northern Manitoba. I have been going to the Cranberry Portage area for 20 years. We are leaving on 24 May returning on 1 June 2002. Cost around $450.00 per man(fuel costs vary)but the fishing makes it worth while. Great Walleye,Pike, and Lakers."
518268,VMS,2002-03-18 09:59:00,1103,"Wouldn't be able to go, but I am interested in what water you fish. Been up there many times the second week in June. Up on Kississing Lake.Steve"
518269,Guest,2002-03-18 10:26:00,0,"Your real close! We have fished the Cranberry chain(5 lakes)including Simonhouse and Elbow Lake. We go in June and Sept, although we did not go this last Sept. We have had some people in camp that trailered their boats to Kississing when the bite slowed down. For me its hard to give up on the water you know."
518270,Guest,2002-03-18 10:53:00,0,Good idea on kississing ..........you have to run so far to the decent fishing
518271,Piscatorian,2002-03-18 21:14:00,12,One of the guides on Kississing was poaching a TON of walleyes for years and selling them to restaraunts in Winnipeg. He told me himself. ...and they wondered why they had to wander out so far for good fishing!
518272,VMS,2002-03-19 09:56:00,1103,"Fished Simonhouse back in 83...good fishing for Pike at the time.You definitly have to get out in the lake at Kississing for fish. We camp on an island not too far from the west end of the lake. good fishing and not many boats, but more and more show up each year.Walleyes have been fantastic the past two years...The worst part about getting there is the drive north of cranberry portage. Talk about a bladder/axle buster. Tough on equipment, but well worth it once you are in there and away from people.Steve"
518273,Guest,2002-03-19 14:24:00,0,how far west.........past collins point.......moose eye????ever been way south west???
518274,Piscatorian,2002-03-19 20:46:00,12,"The best pike fishing, BY FAR, that I experienced on that lake was somewhere on the south side, somewhat west (I don't remember exactly). Anyway, it was a fairly small narrow bay. After an initial narrows it widened a bit and then got shallow. It got narrower and narrower, and shallower and shallower, making a sharp turn to the right, going about another 50 yards, then cutting left (south, I believe), and getting real narrow.It was a stream entrance of some kind but without much or really any noticable current. That whole area was filled with pike, all along the reeds that lined both sides, and some bigger ones in the center. Caught several dozens there. Bigger ones were real smart, though-like they had been around. It was late on our last day there and we hadn't caught any big pike. Between the right run and the left turn, I caught my biggest pike on that trip using a real subtle presentation ('cause I realized after catching a bajillion small ones but seeing some bigger ones that they were kinda smart). It was only 38"" long, but was easily 20 lbs., and I'm not exaggerrating one ounce. Still the fattest, biggest shouldered pike I've caught for the length."
518275,Guest,2002-03-20 05:42:00,0,If you have time take a look at a map...........wheres the bay???
518276,Piscatorian,2002-03-20 18:25:00,12,"If you can point me to some place online where I could find a decent map of that lake, I'll give it a try."
