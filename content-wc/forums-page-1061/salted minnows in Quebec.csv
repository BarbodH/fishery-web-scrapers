508923,Jim,2000-07-04 10:59:00,238,Regulations state that minnows are not allowed to be used in Quebec waters for fishing. I was wondering about salted minnows. Does anyone know if they are allowed to be used? Please reply at my email site or on the message board. Thanks.

Wether they be fresh, dead, salted, colored, etc., they are not allowed. Not even a part of them like eyes or tail. That regulation also includes the use of crawfish. And if you want to use frogs, you have to buy a special licence to catch some. Welcome to beautiful and regulated Qu√©bec. See you around. rawburt"
