East wind for 7 days straight, rain every day, snow on friday the 16th. We did not see the sun once all week. We managed to catch good sized (largest was 11 lbs) walleyes and three pike over twenty pounds and the trout were all over the place in three feet of water but the fishing was way off compared to previous years fishing at this camp. Did any one fish this area then and how did you do? Where did you fish? Thanks in advance."

The eyes were scattered all over the place. Caught them anywhere from 2'-18' of water and didn't get into any large schools of fish the entire two weeks. Was able to catch some decent fish (+24"") but not like in years past. My guess the following factors effected the fishing:1)Early ice out (mid April)2)Abnormally warm spring (early)3)Colder than normal late spring/early summer4)Dry early spring/excessivly wet late spring5)Higher than normal lake levels. Lake rose 1.5' during the 2 weeks. Up +2' from last year. 6)Varied water temps. 6/11 58-60 degrees 6/17 50-52 6/23 58-60 So you weren't the only one who experienced the same conditions and results during that time. Spoke to a group that was up at Lake Nungesser 6/10-16 and thay said the fishing/weather was marginal at best."

508968,Mal,2000-07-09 05:33:00,55,We experienced the same weather at Esnagami Lake. We were told that this has been a colder spring than normal. The fishing was off compared to years past but it is still better than any where else. Had a couple of nights where we slept in long johns with 5 wool blankets over us. Still managed to catch alot of walleyes but the pike fishing was way off. Still had a great time and will be going back next year.
