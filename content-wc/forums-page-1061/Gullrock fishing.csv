508821,Guest,2000-06-28 08:12:00,0,I am heading up fishing on July 21st. So far I have heard great reports. I was wondering has anyone been up in the last week or Two? And how did you do?ThanksJeff
508822,Guest,2000-06-29 18:23:00,0,"Hey Jeff, Looks like it isn't heavily fished. no replies1 I will be going up when you are coming home. Last I heard they are catching fish, despite lousy weather. Drive carefully and good fishing. Will anxiously wait for your tremendous results."
508823,Guest,2000-07-05 18:58:00,0,"Just got back from gullrock. Water level is high, watch out for floating debris. Army worms are wreaking their havoc up there, watch out for the lettuce in your BLT. Seriously, if you need more info e-mail me."
508824,Guest,2000-07-06 08:01:00,0,"Yes Please, how was fishing, what was working, and what part of lake was producing.thank YouJeff"
508825,Guest,2000-07-07 04:24:00,0,"Fishing was excellent. Mayflies were in full hatch and that slowed things down a couple of days. Fished mainly leeches. Usual spots were good, Burnt island, the Boot(heel), Fishermans point, Marker island. Did fish in a way I'm not accustomed to. Anchored in the river between Ranger and Gullrock in 2-3 feet of water and cast shad raps pulling in some huge walleyes. Hope this helps. Where are you staying up there?"
508826,Guest,2000-07-07 08:24:00,0,"We stay at Five lakes Lodge. It is a great camp with good owners. Where is fisherman's point and Marker Island? I purchased a waterproof map last year, are these points shown on there. The river between Ranger and Gullrock. I have never been there. What made you go there?ThanksJeff"
508827,Guest,2000-07-10 19:34:00,0,I'm sure that the lodge owners can point out those places on the map if they aren't marked. Have seen the map you refer to but don't recall if those points are marked on the map or not. Went up to Ranger just for a joy ride/change of pace. Had to put some mileage on the new boat.
