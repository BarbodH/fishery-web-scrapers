I always taken full doemunetaiotn of shots, vac's., etc. which are requried if you are questioned. Just make sure you have the proper documentation and it should not be a problem."

The border mounties never looked at the papers just inquired... So, I would suggest that you have a health certificate just in case they want to press the issue. Would be an inconvience to have to go locate a vet and get the necessary papers to cross the border when preplanning could eliminate the situation."

Funny since they usually have nothing but serious questions.......we have been asked for papers like once in 10 to 12 crossings......"
