508905,Mike in MN,2000-07-03 11:41:00,9,"Just returned from week long stay in the Nestor Falls area where our group fished a number of different lakes including LOTW, mostly in Sabaskong Bay. We have stayed with a lodge on another lake for the last two years and have been treated very well, but we have decided to stay directly on LOTW next year. A couple of years ago we had a terrible experience with a lodge in Sioux Narrows that I picked based solely upon their website, brochures and a phone conversation. I want to make sure that this never happens again so I am interested in any recommendations that may be out there for Lodges on LOTW, preferably on Sabaskong Bay or very close to it. Any help would be greatly appreciated.By the way, for anyone who is interested, the fishing was good but not exceptional last week; mainly because the weather was constantly changing between rain, cold, sun, pretty constant wind and even some hail. All in all though considering the weather, the fishing was surprisingly good. I had no problems at the border, went through Baudette on the way up and I-Falls on the way back, less than 5 minutes both times."
508906,BD,2000-07-03 13:03:00,739,We houseboat out of Reed Narrows with Lake of the Woods Houseboats ( #####://lowhouseboats.com ) which is three miles north of Sioux Narrows. There is another houseboat rental place in Sioux Narrows (Floating Lodges) which some people we know like. If you can't find a lodge you like try house-boating. You can move to different locations near the best fishing without a long ride back each day. When you move just tow your fishing boats alongbehind the houseboat. Have fun!

508909,Sunshine,2000-07-06 10:07:00,3174,"I have been staying at Hanson's King Island Lodge on LOTW for several years now and absolutely love it. Most people park their trailers at Nestor falls and boat to the Island. They will meet you at the public boat ramp upon arrival to you can follow them back to camp or pick you up if you are using their boats. It's a first class operation and the people are great. The Island is about half way between Morson and Nestor Falls so boating traffic is not as bad as other areas of LOTW. There is very good fishing right around the Island in case of bad weather. I would recommend using one of the Island guides the first day or so to save valuable time figuring out patterns and presentations. They only charge $100 per boat, which I consider very cheap to help make a successful trip. I'll be back again the first week in August and can't wait. Their phone number is 807-484-2115. Their Email is #####://www.hwl.on.ca/king_island_.htmIf you musky fish bring the rods. The fishing is unbelievable. We do a combo trip of walleyes and musky."
508910,Guest,2000-07-06 20:23:00,0,"For the region you describe, I can think of no better lodge than the Obobikan Bay Lodge. It is located just south of the narrows on an island between Miles Bay and Obobikan Bay. Fishing is always good for Northern, Walleye and crappie with plenty of musky in the area. This will be my 10th year going up there. I go once in August with my son and again in October for friends who want to blast ducks and grouse and I fish for late fall walleyes. They have a great price in August and you should call 1-800-933-9489 for more details. If you go, I would highly recommend you hire guide, Bill Looney as he knows these waters like no other. We have had days with 100+ walleyes."
508911,Guest,2000-07-07 11:21:00,0,Try Sunset Cove camp at Nestor falls on lake of the woods it is a REAL fishing camp. the owner spends alot of time on the water and he is the best muskie guide on that part of the lake plus he really knows whats going on with the walleye and other species. We have stayed there for years its a nice place and the owners are good people.check it out www.sunsetcove.f2s
