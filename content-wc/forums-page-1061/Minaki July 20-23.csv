508894,Guest,2000-07-02 20:12:00,0,Looking for input on hot spots/presentations forJuly 20-23. Have fished minaki several times inthe fall and need some summer tips. Any infowould be greatly appreciated.
508895,Guest,2000-07-03 10:40:00,0,"Go deep. 1/4 black jig tipped with a minnow. The weather will play a big part in finding thefish. You just have to keep looking for them, they should be consistantly holding at the samedepth. Good luck"

We use our electronics to spot fish in 30 - 15 foot of water and drift or slow troll over them to see what magic depth they are feeding at. Last year 25' was about the best. It seems if you get under 15' in the summer, the perch start to bother and the eyes we catch are small. I recommend the submerged bumps in BIG SAND, or where the river flows through the north end of little sand. For some evening fun, take along a couple deep diving reef runners and troll over the deep water in Big Sand the last couple hours of the day. I'm heading up July 30th, so please post a report on how it went and if anything worked especially well for you. (what resort you staying at?) Have fun, IaCraig"

If you have been there before, then you probably know that if you just ask Duane he usually is on top of what techniques and areas have been producing the best the last few days. Wish ya Lots-a-luck & good weatherIaCraig"
