508809,Guest,2000-07-06 05:24:00,0,I'd never go with out an asortment of jigs. As for crankbaits I got outfished 3 to 1 by my wife I was using a Rapala and she was using a Thunderstick both were fire tiger.

508797,Mick,2000-06-28 18:19:00,26,Number one lure???....The most mangled and puncture lure in my tackle box.#13 silver original rapala#13 gold original rapala3/8 oz red & silver hot-n-tot.Don't leave home without them!
508799,Guest,2000-06-28 20:37:00,0,It's hard to beat a Willey's Weepin' Weed Wiper in chart.
508800,Guest,2000-06-29 03:09:00,0,1/4 oz curly tail jig with nightcrawler. I will wager that this combination accounts for 75% of the walleyes taken in Canadian water. As far as a casting or trolling lure goes: Thunderstick. And if you are going to cast for northern: Johnson Silver Minnow with a bass strip.
508801,Guest,2000-06-29 07:27:00,0,"Wall-Nut,Now you opened another can of worms...pike. My go to lure for pike would have to be Eppinger's 1 oz. Red Eye Wiggler in Hot Mackeral (firetiger pattern). Burn this over weedbeds as fast as you can crank and hang on!"
508802,Guest,2000-07-04 08:15:00,0,"You just can't beat a jig for versatility up here in Canada. It'll catch you walleye every day and big pike do not hesitate picking up the tasty looking morsel! Tip it with a leech or a crawler or go plastic, it doesn't matter most days!! My other choices:2. #14 Husky Jerk, clour doesn't seem to matter3. Rattlin' Rap- silver4. Yellow and Red 5 of Diamonds- Big Pike can't resist5. Bomber long a minnow- The biggest shallow runner you can find!Hang on to your rod and have fun!!!Saskman"

508804,Guest,2000-07-04 14:21:00,0,"I always take 40 or 50 3/8th rattle-tots and hot-and tots to Ontario. All colors work great, but the Metalic Rainbow is the best lure I have ever fished."
508805,Guest,2000-07-05 07:49:00,0,It all depends what species you are targeting.....
508806,docIN,2000-07-05 12:24:00,120,Hmmmmm let me see.... WALLEYES/PIKE
508807,Guest,2000-07-05 12:26:00,0,"I would take a #5 Gold Willow Leaf Mepps spinner bait. This bait produces Walleyes, Northern's and Smallmouth. It's not my top selection for walleyes, but if I only had my choice of one bait and I wanted to eat, this would be it. I can produce fish with this under any conditions. TGG"
508788,docIN,2000-06-27 11:35:00,120,"If you could only take one lure to Canada, what would it be?"
508789,Guest,2000-06-27 11:59:00,0,3/8 ounce hot n tot (rattle tot) perch pattern
508790,Fred_G,2000-06-27 12:52:00,908,Medium gold/silver Williams Wabler Fred
508791,Guest,2000-06-27 13:05:00,0,Nothing beats a jig on a consistant basis where I come from in Ontario. Good fishing: Frank
508792,miksup,2000-06-28 05:15:00,297,1/4 ounce Bill Lewis Rat'ltrap-blue/silver
508793,Guest,2000-06-28 05:41:00,0,"I would have to agree with my boat partner, Jay. The 3/8's Rattle Tot has, time and again, proven itself to us. Throw a perch pattern on and you can catch anything in Canadian waters. Just an all around excellent lure.If someone told me they use if for muskie too, I wouldn't even be surprised."

508795,Guest,2000-06-28 07:48:00,0,"Now that I gave you my #1 and my partner Andrew confirmed it I feel compelled to offer up a few other ""gems"" that could be considered a #1 goto bait in anyones book. Remember one thing, this depends on the type of fishing that you most commonly do, I am a habitual troller, can't help it. If I was a jig or live bait fisherman I would say something other than what I am about to. That being said:#14 Rapala Husky Jerk Gold with Orange Belly#25 Bomber Long A shallow diving minnow bait, transparent gold with orange belly.#9 Shad Rap Chartruese back with white sides#13 Original floating rapala gold or silverFor Pike, a one ounce hot mackeral red eye wiggler hands down. BEST OF LUCK TO YOU!!!"
508796,Guest,2000-06-28 09:13:00,0,"There you go Jay, giving away all our secrets! Seriously though, one of these baits is always hot. Jay did leave one out. This one quickly became my overall favorite walleye (and pike for that matter) rig.*A three way rig consisting of a 3/8 perch Hot-n-tot and a Pro King orange/orange ladder with silver back flutter spoon. 75% of strikes will be on the spoon.Troll on!"
508798,Guest,2000-06-28 15:35:00,0,"Hot-n-Tot for me too, Make mine Hot Tiger."
