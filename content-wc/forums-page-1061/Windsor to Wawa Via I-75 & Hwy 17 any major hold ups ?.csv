508991,Guest,2000-07-11 09:07:00,0,"Hi Whitey, I am flying in with Hawk Air out of Hawk Junction just north of Wawa. I have been using this outfitter for the last seven years and have had good experiences. I have found that I have better fishing in the July, Aug, Sept, periods than in the spring. I usually use jigs and rigs for Walleye and spoons and sucker minnows with floats for Pike. Have a great trip.Steven B."
