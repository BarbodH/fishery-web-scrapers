1348139,Lovetofish,2011-09-09 09:00:00,458,Any updates on the I-35 construction? Will be going through tomorrow 8-9 am and wondering if we should take one of the alternate roads to Duluth.
1348189,dutchboy,2011-09-09 11:33:00,5717,Tomorrow you will be good.
1340454,LOW1,2011-08-15 08:36:00,2828,We had about an hour to an hour and a half delay yesterday because of the construction on southbound Interstate 35 between Cloquet and the Twin Cities. Any word on when this construction will be done? We will be doing at least one more trip this season and may plan an alternate route. Any suggestions for getting from Cloquet to the Rochester MN area without using I35?
1340825,Hump,2011-08-16 09:14:00,578,"It seems when there is construction in Minn. there is always a long backup. When it finally breaks, the problem seems to be merging from one lane to another. Shouldn't be a problem, but it always is!"
1341001,MorganMan,2011-08-16 18:06:00,341,"It should have been done long ago. The concrete has been ready for over a month, but there was no work done on it when the goverment shut down. Only need shoulders taken care of, but I don't ever see anyone working on it?? It is a major hassle and I'm hoping it done soon!"
1341099,rather-be-fishin,2011-08-16 22:24:00,429,You could try Co Hwy 61 it runs parallel to I35. It's two lane. You could get on it at Carlton Hwy 210 exit East of Black Bear Casino. Good luck!
1341160,Mark R,2011-08-17 08:01:00,1538,The DOT website map say mid October to November for some areas. There is alot of construction shown on the map. What about taking HWY 65 north all the way to Hibbing?
1341330,MorganMan,2011-08-17 18:08:00,341,"It depends on when you are traveling. Traveling north on Friday/Saturday or south on Sunday, forget about it! Then it may be worth all the small towns on the two lane highways. I have been through outside those times and not slowed down at all. We have changed our travel dates long ago to deal with traffic."
1341783,rms0528,2011-08-19 10:57:00,18,"One option would be to come down through Wisconsin. Take Hwy 53 south out of Superior to to Spooner, and Hwy 63 south from there into Redwing."
1341790,Pezman38,2011-08-19 11:28:00,3196,"We had backups coming south on August 12, so we went down 61 to 694, then got on 494. Picked up I35 later on. Had good results, the I35E and I35 north of the cities seemed to be the issue."
1342147,rather-be-fishin,2011-08-20 22:09:00,429,"I heard there is road construction in Wisconsin too, so check that situation out before going this route. Hwy 61 or Hwy 65 or Hwy 169 also run south to the Cities. Good Luck!"
1343110,MorganMan,2011-08-23 19:55:00,341,"Just drove I35 from Hinckley to Cloquet and there are now 3 areas of road construction that narrow to one lane, going north at least. Thankfully, it wasn't a busy travel day so not a big deal for me, but heads up for those traveling this weekend. One was the big 13 or 14 mile stretch from Moose Lake and south, one was about 8 miles or so just north of Hinckley, and the other was somewhere inbetween, but only a short one for bridge work."
