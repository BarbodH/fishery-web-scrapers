1348372,SinOrSwim,2011-09-10 00:19:00,1528,"It's very weird when talking to other people about 9/11. We happened to be in Canada on a fly-in outpost trip. A trip we have made for years. We really had no idea it even happened......sort of. We are Viking fans and I had told my wife I was going to try and call to get a score, IF I could get reception on the satellite phone. So, fishing all day, dinner and a lot of drinks we decide to try and call to get a score. I call my wife, get disconnected. Call again and ask how things are. Can barely hear each other. She starts rambling about a plane that hit the World Trade Center. I was very confused. Said it again and I was like....what are you talking about. Connection was very poor and after a few beers I wasn't quite grasping what she was talking about. Anyway, I asked again what the score was. She said they lost and started talking about a plane again. We got disconnected again. Now, we'd have to wait awhile to get the satellite overhead to try again and decided against it.So we are all sitting around having a few and trying to figure out what had just happened. Absolutely no concept of what had happened.This was a Tuesday. We were scheduled to fly out Thursday morning. The plane came in. The pilot was very intense and said there has been an incident, all planes are grounded. We have rules in Canada we can't leave anyone in the bush. Being the fall time of year we have been used to loading and unloading supplies for the cabin. Whether it be mattresses or wood for a deck/dock. This time...NOTHING. Plane empty. It was simply a get in there, get your people and get out. We didn't take garbage, empty tanks, nothing. Us and our gear. As we were flying back our pilot said again all planes are grounded and we were one of the ONLY non-military planes flying in all of North America. We knew it was big but if you haven't seen any pictures you just don't understand.It's very weird to think something of that magnitude was sort of a second thought for us until we got back and grabbed newspapers and started listening to the radio. There was very little coverage on what radio stations we could get in Canada. My wife had been at home and as soon as all this happened stuck a tape in the VCR's and put on channel on CNN and one on NBC. I was able to see all the original footage when I got back. It's just very strange to have something like 9/11 happen and have absolutely no concept of it for a couple days.Where were you and what were you doing???"
1348380,81Saluki,2011-09-10 02:53:00,97,"When we first bought our cabin north of Vermilion Bay, we didn't have TV and the only decent reception on the radio was a French-speaking station. When people would ask what it was like at the cabin, I would joke that the US could get nuked and we'd be happily fishing â€¦ oblivious to whatever was going on back home. Not such a funny joke anymore.By 2001, we had a satellite TV. On 9/11 my folks were at the cabin and I was working from home with CNN on the TV. I had just called them to see how things were going that morning. The news broke as we were chit-chatting and I told Mom to turn on the TV. Of course, during those early minutes we all thought the first plane was just a terrible accident. But after the 2nd plane hit, we knew differently. Mom was pretty unnerved and they came home a couple of days later. Interestingly, crossing the border back into the US was pretty much ""normal""."
1348412,MorganMan,2011-09-10 06:51:00,341,"I was with Sin then and we also were out there when Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005! Came back to extremely high gas prices and thought, what the **** happened to the price of gas? The fly in is truly a complete getaway with little or no outside presence. For those of you worried about what will happen when we go this year, worry not. We are doing a drive in this year instead.....no catastrophes."
1348466,Pikeslayer8,2011-09-10 10:59:00,1460,I have often wondered what it would have been like to have been in fish camp when those crazy muslums changed forever our world.I thought that even bush pilots were grounded for quite a while and to be sitting in camp with your gear on the dock waiting for a plane that wasn't going to come. Looking at a sky devoid of aircraft. After a little while you have to know something happened... Might just as well grab my gear and get after the walleyes
1348553,joeman79,2011-09-10 19:47:00,417,"I was guiding up in the high country for Elk that week. It was a gorgeous week. We packed out on I think it was a wednesday or Thursday. After being out of touch with the world for a week, we were talking about how beautiful it was up there and how we hated to leave. On our way back to Pagosa Springs we were going down Wolf Creek Pass and I was gazing up at the Blue Sky and I made a comment that this was one of the first times I had ever seen the sky without seeing vaportrails left by all the air traffic. In the next hour we found out why. After we had unloaded all the gear I was going to meet up with a couple of my best friends to Bowhunt Elk. When I arrived at our Condo everyone was huddled around the Television Set. I made a smart remark that I do not remember what it was, no one commented. I then said what is so danged interesting on TV GUYS??? Dr. Baird turned to me and said WE ARE AT WAR MAN!!!!! Haven't You heard!!!!!!!!! My mind was trying to process what he had just told me, I could not think of any reason we would be at War. I then replied No we have been in the High Country for a week and the next several hours we were all glued to the News and very few words were spoken. I remember it like it was yesterday. I am still pissed!!!!!!!!! God Bless America"
1348574,Guest,2011-09-10 21:00:00,0,"We, three guys, were coming home to Wisconsin that day. We were coming home after 5 days fishing Pakwash. The fishing was quite bad those 5 days with many storms with scary lightening. I have had the pleasure of sitting on an island on Pakwash lake in the middle of a monsoon watching countless cloud to lake lightening strikes hoping there was not a lightening bolt with my name on it. Last day the weather really got nice although the fishing never did. That evening we saw the most incredible evening/dusk/sunset which I still recall fondly. In retrospect I look back at that sunset as if it was a message of some type, the last normal time, God saying goodby to the people who would lose their lives the next day, that this sunset is how good the world can be, I don't know. We stop at the Village Corner in Vermilion Bay to get new coffee and get rid of old coffee when the gal at the till asked if I was American and I somewhat defensively (fearing an ugly American story) said yes. She then asked if we knew about the attacks, that the White House was being evacuated, multiple plane crashes. That was how we found out about 9/11. I love being in Canada and have always been treated so well in Canada, great country and people, but at that instant I wanted to be home. Driving south of Dryden on 502 has always seemed that it took twice the time it actually takes but on that day driving on 502 felt endless. We had been told that the border would possble close. Luckily we got to the border shortly before it did close. Crossing into the US the border was crawling with officers, it looked like they called everybody in, I remember one officer wearing shorts, a sweaty dirty shirt and his gunbelt. Rest of the trip was mostly routine except all the gas stations were packed with cars and they probably didn't need gas but we did. Got home and really hugged the wife, my sons birthday party that evening was a bit muted."
1348659,phishfearme,2011-09-11 10:03:00,1242,sinorawim - thanks for relaying your story - i alway wondered what it was like for guys who were in the bush away from contact with the real world. on our trips we always miss something that's in the news and by the time we get back to civilization it's old news already and most people have forgotted - not this time and certainly not for you guys. thanks for the good story phish 9/11 was a faith based initiative
1348906,labsrus,2011-09-12 10:41:00,557,"Our group of 4 was at a remote fly in camp in Ontario. Two more from our party were scheduled to fly in on Wednesday of the week. Tuesday afternoon we were cleaning fish for dinner around 4PM. We heard the plane coming and and then saw it land a day earlier that we expected. My buddy and myself asked each other what day it was and both said that something is strange. I thought that something happened to the two guys who were driving up Tuesday, maybe could not get out of work or maybe a traffic accident. When the bush pilot was explainging everything to us about what happened, we were shocked, he was gounded until further notice, many planes still missing, thousands killed, lot of misinformation. He did not know if the other two were able to cross the border but was not sure if they would be able to fly them in. If he did not come back that week, we could find a trail at the end of the lake to hike out on. After he left we had no idea what was really going on. No idea if it was global war or what was happening back home. We did not go far from the cabin on Wednesday, fished a little bit but kept close just in case. Noticed that there were no planes flying over at all, what was going on!! On Thrusday afternoon the bush plane was able to bring in our two buddies and they had a few local newspapers with the story. We were shocked to learn what happened. We were able to fly out on Sunday for the 12 hour ride home. I do remember all the US flags being flown in Canada on the way home. Pretty amazing. Long wait at Bridge coming back. Of course I will never forget where I was. It was hard on our family back home, not knowing how were were. Now we take a Sat Phone in with us for information if needed."
1348957,REG,2011-09-12 12:44:00,445,"I wasn't in Canada, but was scheduled to drive up and do a fly-in to moose hunt the Saturday after 9-11. We were a little concerned about the border (we obviously had rifles) but had done all our paperwork and had no problem at the border. I was more concerned about coming back. Our outfitter was flying that Saturday but told us that he was in the air on 9-11 when they told every plane in the air to put down immediately. He decided that immediately didn't mean the nearest lake, so he kept flying till he got to his base. He said a couple of days later, some mounties show up and said the next time ordered to put down now - you'd best put down now. We had no contact for the next 10 days. On the way back at the border, we were driving a van with a full sized chest freezer and a couple of rifles. No problem - no one even asked to look in the freezer. I was actually sort of disappointed that we crossed so easily. Of course we might have looked and smelled like we had been moose hunting."
1348691,wallydave,2011-09-11 13:50:00,2151,"Faith in a higher power was not the cause of 9-11, it was misguided people, replacing hate for faith, it was people using faith to try to justify thier evil actions. The KKK replaced faith with hate in just the same way. Any time people use faith to justify their hateful actions, is a crime aginst God and people is being committed."
1348745,downriverbob,2011-09-11 19:33:00,880,"I was at work in I worked for the Federal gov't in a secure facility and was listening to a local morning radio show when it all started. My supervisor and several others were in a meeting. I went in and informed them about the first plane hitting the World Trade Center, after the second plane hit I went in again and informed them and this time the meeting was closed out. As others have said it surely was a game changer. The strange thing was earlier that year, I was a training session with a tactical team that I was a member of. The name Osama bin Ladin was brought up in relation to a terror situation, little did we know how that name would impact our country. BOB"
1348847,cast_and_blast,2011-09-12 08:53:00,1098,"I was on a fly-in in Canada (NE of Red Lake Ontario) as well. One of our group always brings a small transitor radio along and we were able to pickup a BBC broadcast that evening. I remember him coming out of the cabin and telling us that he thought something big had happened in the states, but he wasn't quite sure what. I was cleaning walleyes for dinner. The rest of the evening we sat around the fire with the radio fading in/out trying to discern waht happened. By this time they were into the analysis of the situation, so we got the news in pieces... There was a plane crash...in NY...in NYC...it hit a building...it was a jetliner...it hit a big building...it was a terrorist attack...something about the Pentagon...there were two planes...one hit the WTC...the WTC was destroyed? Etc. It was like repeated punches to the gut as we learned more and more of what happened. Our camp operator is also a pilot and he flew in on Thursday (in his business suit as he was at his regular job when he finally got clearance to fly) with a stack of newspapers and a request to fly anyone out who needed to go. We didn't need to go (thankfully). I remember the drive home with all of the US flags draped over bridges, signs in support of the US all the way home (even in Canada). We waited 14 hours in line to cross the border in International Falls and there were US Marines on duty in full body armor with auto rifles. Everyone got out of every vehicle - period. I'll never forget. Scott"
