It seems like many of us visit WC to share more than how many fish, and which bait to use. We visit this site to share the richness of our Canadian experiance with others who ""speak the language"" that can only be understood by folks who have had the same experiances! Sure, reading the posts, checking websites of the many camps and outfitters helps fill the void we may feel. Going to a place like your favorite outdoors store, is just another way to keep in touch with that Canadian experiance, one we all treasure!"
1347813,wallydave,2011-09-08 07:47:00,2151,"For walleye anglers in Central Illinois, we have yet another countdown! In two weeks the East Peoria Bass Pro store will open. We have a Gander Mountain, along with Presleys a local outdoors store, now we will have another place to wander around, looking at more gear we ""think"" we need to battle the tasty walleye!In reality it will be another place to go to where we can temporarily check-out of the day-to-day routine and relive the memories that we treasure about our trips North!"

1347840,wallydave,2011-09-08 08:48:00,2151,"The Bass Pro will be much closer to home for me! I can get to Gander on my way home from work, but it is out of the way, Bass Pro is easy to spot along I74, but it will be hard to get to, East Peoria traffic, for our area anyway is usually congested, not unlike the crossing at I Falls!"

1347953,JDP,2011-09-08 16:08:00,1457,"Kirt,I read a number of years ago that Bass Pro was to be part of an expansion at the Mall of America. Maybe the plan was put on the back burner or dropped because of the economy....I found an announcement from 2006:http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/st...ptId=000000000"
1348059,Shellback,2011-09-09 04:39:00,8083,"So Illinois packed up and moved to Canada? Unless there's a reason for posting this on the Canada site, I can move the post to the General board."
1348087,wallydave,2011-09-09 07:05:00,2151,"I posted this on the Canadian board, because my nearly all of my fishing is done in Canada, so Bass Pro will be another source for fishing gear, as well as the between trip ""therapy"" of checking the latest jigs, line, lures and rod-n-reels!"
1348096,lcwhit,2011-09-09 07:29:00,104,leave it here. this is the only board i visit and this store is less than 2 hours from me.
1348141,Shellback,2011-09-09 09:05:00,8083,"No problem leaving it here, Just wanted to be sure it wasn't put here by accident."
1348191,Pikeslayer8,2011-09-09 11:34:00,1460,"General board, don't go there much. My people reside in Canada Eh!"
