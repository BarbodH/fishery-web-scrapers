How about in Rainy River? Anyone have a good spot there? I also remember a small cafe on the south side of the highway east of RR a ways. How is it? Thanks, Bill Krejca"

May not be a traditional breakfast of bacon and eggs, but doughnuts, muffins, coffee etc for sure. I'm not sure of of hours at Roadside and have never eaten breakfast there.I would check the Ranch House to make sure it's closed because it has had irregular hours form time to time. I have thought it has been closed down a time or two and then it's back open again. I will be missing the big pancakes there too. Well pancake maybe...I would have bacon, eggs too so one pancake was more than enough for me."

1347510,Lovetofish,2011-09-07 09:02:00,458,"Bill, is the place your talking about in Baudette on the main highway through town? I hope not. Sorry I can't recall the name of it."
1347513,Lovetofish,2011-09-07 09:23:00,458,Looked up the place I was talking about and it is the Ranch House. Biggest plate of hash browns I've ever seen. Tell me it ain't so!
1347519,Bill Krejca,2011-09-07 10:01:00,6107,"Yup! And HUGE pancakes - bet ya can't eat more than one! Brings a tear to my eye, just thinking about not being able to go there. Say, maybe this would be a good time to start a restaurant. Or not. Probably not, but folks have to eat somewhere! Bill"
1347523,Lovetofish,2011-09-07 10:14:00,458,"That's too bad. Always stopped for breakfast on the way home from our fall Rainy River trip. And yes, I've had the pancakes too."
1348216,rwl,2011-09-09 13:04:00,1655,"Don't forget the Whimpy Plate they had, I think it was 5 burgers, and the big milkshakes in the glass mug shaped like a cowboy boot!They were always so busy I can't believe they closed. How about Rosalies down the road a bit, I would guess their only open for dinner."
1348310,Bill Krejca,2011-09-09 18:18:00,6107,Re: Rosalies - I'm not aware they are open for breakfast. We usually eat supper there. Pretty good prime rib. A fair walk from the Walleye Inn. Bill
