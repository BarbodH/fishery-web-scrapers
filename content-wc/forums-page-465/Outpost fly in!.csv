1348338,the big gulp alive,2011-09-09 20:38:00,3,"I would encourage you to visit hiddenbay.com. Below is a post I wrote in August after a trip to Armit Lake. In reading your post you are looking for seclusion..... The cabin at Armit is the only cabin on the lake AND the only cabin on the attached lake. Watch out....many outfitters will say they are the only cabin on the lake but lakes are tied together and many times there are cabins on the adjourning lakes. It is not the end of the world. I have fished other hidden bay lakes that have another cabin on the lake but never really see the others. Read the post below. You may want to call early as most of their lakes fill up. Read my old post below.OK.... I went twice this year. Early we went to Minnis and killed the Walleye... Multiple 24+"" and quite a few 38+ Northern. We just came back from a trip to Armit (my first time at that lake). The fishing was amazing. The group that came out as we were going in said they never traveled more than 1/2 mile from the cabin and they caught hundreds. This is what you need to know about Hidden Bay. It has been family owned for many years. They are as friendly and helpful as you can imagine. They fly a modern caravan which can take up to 8 fishermen at a time and the travel times to their lakes are between 20 and 30 minutes of flying. I have been in many a Beaver...they are loud and slow and can only take a few passengers so the Caravan is an awesome perk that you won't see with many outfitters. The cabins are all clean, running hot and cold water and flush toilets and showers (love flush toilets). Don't tell the misses but they even have phones linked to their satellite internet. The only lake I have not fished at Hidden Bay is Raggedwood. All the other are great.BTW....my fishing tip..... Although Hidden Bay may not like this comment I would recommend that you do not use minnows (they die quick). For the past two years (4 trips) we have been using the gulp alives and they are awesome. Every bit as productive as minnows but they stay on the hook. It is not uncommon to catch 5-10 fish on one gulp.... AND NO I do not work for the Gulp folk, I am a Firefighter....GO TO HIDDEN BAY...... trust me you will love it."

1347961,willy0183,2011-09-08 16:35:00,11,"Looking for some help on finding a good fly-in in canada for next year. There are 6 guys going and we all agree we want a rustic experience. A few thing we are looking for is a remote lake, only people on it for a week. Good Fishing is a must of course. Also decent boats something with at least swivel padded seats and dependable engines. An outfitter that supplies the essentials at camp like some food and bait but don't need someone there all week. Satellite phone in case of emergency. And a decent cabin with heat of some kind, and running water would be nice but not mandatory. There are a lot of outfitter out there and just wanted some input and experiences from people that have been there. Thanks for the help"
1347997,Ten Horse Johnson,2011-09-08 19:06:00,235,"If walleye and northern pike are what you're seeking, I recommend Kabeelo out of the Ear Falls area (www.kabeelo.com). I've been up there 9 out of the last 12 years and we've always done well and had great service. Some of their lakes are the only cabin on the lake, and on some there may be one other outfitter with an outpost on a different part of the lake (but you seldom run into the other party). They provide basic food items with their cabin (eggs, bacon, canned goods, lunch meat, steaks, burgers, butter etc). Satelite phone is available as an optional rental, but they do daily fly-overs, weather permitting. He has live minnows available, but we've been using salted minnows and have done just fine. You could probably do well with jigs and soft plastics, too. We've never had a problem catching walleyes there, though some years have been better than others. We don't spend much time fishing for northerns, but we catch them while walleye fishing and have seen them up to the 40 inch range (Bear Paw Lake is probably their most popular trophy pike lake). I've personally fished the Okanse, Jeannette, Bertha and Wakeman outposts and can provide info about those upon request. We always get great service from Harald and Ann."
1348022,Golden Eagle,2011-09-08 20:49:00,2642,"I've been on a lot of fly-ins during the past 40 years and have been pleased with every one of them. We've adjusted to the conditions rather than having the outpost adjust to us. Fishing, equipment and facilities aren't always ideal, but our trips are always a success. No offense, but it may be difficult to find exactly what everyone in your party expects.Good luck. Have a great trip."
1348043,Hawkfan,2011-09-08 22:20:00,237,"We have fished Gull Lake through Red Pine Lodge and Outposts (previously run by Slate Falls) for over 10 years. Great fishing and accomodations. Maybe a little more than what you're looking for. Not the only cabin on the lake, but might as well be. Rarely see anyone else.www.fishredpine.com"
1348150,GOBIG,2011-09-09 09:35:00,126,I would try eddies north........awesome place..
1348156,tv4fish,2011-09-09 09:44:00,2694,Willy - Any certain part of Canada? or doesn't it make any difference??My younger brother and his better half just got back from a trip that they really enjoyed. Flew out of the Sioux Lookout area into a lake where they stayed in the only cabin that is on the lake. They fished primarily for walleyes and caught lots of fish.
