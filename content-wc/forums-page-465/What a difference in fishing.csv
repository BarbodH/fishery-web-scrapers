Largest of the 600-700 our group of 6 caught was 22 3/4"". At the end of our 4th day was at the dock and owner was visiting with a older gentleman who was a first year guest. He was taking his boat out of the water and heading home early as his boat had only caught 7 fish in 4 days. Owner asked me how many our group had caught that day. Told him I estimated 125 or so. Guy in boat made a snide comment that he didn't believe me. Dock man told me later he said was l lying. Another boat from Wisconsin had only caught 3 fish in 4 days and left early too. It wasn't that the owner wouldn't help them as we would of too if asked. We would of taken them to our spots, showed them rigs we were using. Anything to help make their trip a success. Pride is a rugged thing. Last day took boat to our spot and Gary Roach arrived at the same place, at the same time to do some pre-fishing for the Red Lake tournament. Visited with him and knew we were at a good spot for that time for that day."

It's hard for some folks to be humble.....we're not going to live long enough to figure it all out every trip, and if someone is willing to help out with fishing advice, be thankful and then help out someone else when you see a family or new guys struggling to catch a few fish. Bet that was neat to talk with Gary Roach on the water when you were up at Gull Rock. Rich B"

1347502,GWC,2011-09-07 08:46:00,1021,"There you go, bragging again. I'm good with that & I'm glad you had a good week. Gull Rock is an interesting lake. We were there last year in late September. They had snow & gale force wind the day before we got there & the lake was rough all week. That didn't stop us or the fish. We had a successful week. Lots of walleye & some good northerns. The wind seems to bring the northerns into feed. We seem to catch the larger northerns when the lake is rough. Good to know info, thanks we're headed up that way again."
