Unlike the late June early July time frame, we didn't see the overall volume, but spent time working deeper water 25-35 feet exclusively looking for hogs. There may have been a minimal amount of time looking in shallower water, but the big girls were deep. One boat fishing two to a boat with a guide and we put 22 over 24 in the boat, we boated a total of 101 over 18 and at least a couple hundred of smaller eyes and sauger in 4 days of fishing. I personally landed 3 over 27 including a monster 27.5 that had to go close to 9lbs, it was massive. We mainly jigged with 3/8 or 1/4oz jigs, I only used 1/4oz. I pulled a bottom bouncer the first day and landed 2-23's, 1-24.25, 1-25, 1-26.5, 1-27.25 using gulp worms all in water over 25'. We then pretty much switched to jigs and minnows for the rest of the trip with some random returns to bouncers or heavy jigs loaded with gulp jerk shads. The rest of my 26+ (3 in total) all came off a 1/4oz jig and minnow. One of the days we basically had blowout conditions, some thunderstorms overnight then a flurry of them from 7am to 8am, followed by some pretty stiff winds that stuck around until 2pm. We caught a flurry of spankers, but the big girls got a good case of lock jaw for the day, we only put 11 on the board that day. Thankfully this was followed by a solid weather day and a quick recovery of walleyes in deep water. We were back on the hunt and had a silly morning fishing one piece of deep water sand. We caught 5-23's, 2-24's, 26.75, 27, 27.25 all before 11am, it was awesome. Well I have officially started the countdown, it's only 295 days until on back on that incredible piece of water and back to SWWL."
