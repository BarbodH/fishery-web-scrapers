1347687,Fishoil,2011-09-07 18:42:00,1277,There's a rest stop just before you get into Superior on Hwy 53.

If your tired, you can stop at the rest area just before Superior Wi. as stated earlier. The weather is going to be summerlike for the next few days. I""m envious! Hope you catch a ton of BIG BOYS!"

Another one is the Anchor Lake rest stop just a few miles south of Virginia, MN. The Superior and Anchor stops have ""facilities"". One other possibility is the US Forest Service office on the north side of Cook. Keep in mind that past Orr, there really isn't anything until you reach I'Falls. Depending on your speed and the number of stops you take, it's about 4.5 hours to the Anchor Lake rest stop from Eau Claire. From there its about 2.25 hrs to the border."
