524437,DaveIN,2002-09-26 06:19:00,191,I don't believe that Verne has a website.I have stayed a Red Pine Lodge a couple of times while waiting for him to fly us out to an outpost cabin.Most are new cabins in the last 5 years.My brother in law was there this summer but they would drive about 20 mins and launch on Lac Seul each day. We have never fished Abram lake that the lodge is on.
524438,IaDave,2002-09-26 07:04:00,476,We are looking for a place that is open after Labor Day because we like to fish Minnitaki that time of year and it looks like it is close to Abrams chute.

I suppose it depends on what you're after for your trip ?? We like/want a nice clean modern cabin - we do our own cooking and we like our ""privacy"". The rates are reasonable - you're close to the town of Sioux Lookout if you need anything. John and Alina run a ""good ship. If you want more details, PM me. Oh - we have ""only"" been going there since 1985."

Years ago we went through a cabin and from I remember, it was nice. John took over Red Pine and half of Verne's outposts couple years ago. I haven't fished the lake there and haven't seen may boats come to think of it either??"
