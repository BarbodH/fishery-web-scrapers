1347286,Little buddy,2011-09-06 15:16:00,801,I want to take the family on a fishing/ swimming/hiking vacation somewhere not too far from Soo Ontario. I would like to keep it to three hours one way and need a lake with cabins and public beach for the kids. I want to bring my boat and fish for wallys and pike. Anyone know of a good place with something for all of us? Thank You....
