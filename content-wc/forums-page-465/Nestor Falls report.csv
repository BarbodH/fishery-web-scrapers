1347465,steve.a,2011-09-07 07:11:00,274,Has anyone have a fishing report from the Nestor Falls area of LOTW? We will heading that way in a week. We like to fish for all species. Have the crappie started to go in the fall pattern yet? Is there any restictions on shore lunch fires in this area? I have seen where it is very dry in some parts. Thanks
