Fishing was 2nd to none and, I've done a number of fly ins throughout N Ont, Manitoba and Alberta......quite frankly none rival Trout Lake for quantity/variety and quality. Find a point....find a walleye(s). We used crawler harnesses down 16-20' and would average a fish every 5 min. The average eye is a most respectable 20"" with many in the 22-25"" range. The highlight was a 31 lb laker caught by my son using light gear in 65' over 80' on a Len Thompson # 4 fire tiger spoon. I lent the portable rigger to a real nice couple of good old boys from Wisconsin and they picked up their limit in a couple of hours. Interestingly they caught a couple of 24"" + eyes at 50' on the Len Thompson. We on the other hand, while no eyes, managed to average a laker every 15 minute on a single set up.I dont target pike but we had success the moment we switched to cranks from crawlers and sped the troll up a bit.The cabins are chalet style, all with dishwashers and some with pool tables.....go figure on a fly in. The hosts...Jim and Traci are as down to earth as you will find; they are always there to offer assistance. To watch Jim fillet a fish with a 24"" booi knife is worth the price of admission alone.Boats have 25 hp hondas and troll down perfectly.In all my 35 years of fly in fishing Ive never found a better fly in experience at such a reasonable rate. Real bargains can be had this time of year to boot but even their peak season rates are very competitive. If you think I like this place, msg me and I'll confirm it doesnt get any better...believe me I know."
1345067,skap,2011-08-29 19:57:00,58,Congrats on the great trip! Sounds like you and the boys had a great time. My family (2 boys and wife) are heading up to Sioux Lookout on Wednesday. Couldnt imaging going up anymore without the family.
1345489,scar,2011-08-31 07:12:00,196,"You sure are right about Booi's. I think I'm still quoted on their brochure about Trout Lake being an awesome fishery for the ""big"" 3 - Walleyes, Northern, and Lake Trout. Went 9 years in a row from 92 - 2001. We bought our own cabin on Minnitaki near Sioux Lookout in 2002 and I have not been back since. Sure miss it and Jim and Traci are wonderful hosts. Fishing is good near Sioux Lookout but nothing will compare to Trout Lake!"
1347145,zeebee,2011-09-06 06:45:00,1144,I know Minnitaki well too. Worked at a camp there for a couple of years in my college days...late 70's. Did a little guiding. Minnitaki a great fishery....never know what to expect. Went back a few years ago with kids and had a great trip outta Timber Edge. Place was for sale at the time and I gave it serious consideration but always a bit scared of tourist industry....too much outta your control.
1347224,dan cardinal,2011-09-06 11:42:00,64,Zeebee....I am looking strongly at Booi's for future 1st of August trip. What month were you there? From Booi's Island is it realistic to fish in the Wolf Island area? What can I anticipate as far as quanity and quality of walleye in August? Thanks!
1348605,zeebee,2011-09-11 05:54:00,1144,"We were up 3rd week in August....walleye on every point. No need to travel far. We cought primarily on crawler rigs 16-20' however they are as deep as 50'. Ave size is 18-22"". Expect dozens a day per fisherman. Switch to cranks and northern are the fare. Bring in a portable rigger as Lake Trout make a great mid day option with plenty of action 50 - 65' over 80-100'. Len Thompson firetiger worked great. You wont be dissapointed. Larger cabins have pool tables and all have dishwashers....go figure on fly in. Good deals can be had in August too."
