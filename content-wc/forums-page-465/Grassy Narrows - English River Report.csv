Took a little while to find the walleyes, our normal spots didnt produce as we had hoped so it was off to exploring. Had to take it slow when exploring, lots of rocks above water that we havent seen before (managed to find 1 new rock and 1 new sandbar)We fished areas where there was current and steep drop offs and did pretty well. Biggest walleye of the trip was 27"" and fat, biggest northern was 38"" - that guy had fun on his jigging rod with that fish. Bait didnt seem to matter too much, used crawlers, live minnows and salted minnows, all produced"

1347992,Bigstorm,2011-09-08 18:15:00,799,"sure was different looking! Plenty of spots I have went wide open across are now 3ft above water. Did run into 1 issue with a guide from another camp in that area though, I was anchored 50ft from shore and he decided to go between me and the shore 2 times, drifting and back trolling. I can understand that guides get paid based on how well the clients catch fish, but this guy threw eticate right out the window. I even made a comment ""pretty big lake huh? lots a of places to fish"", his response was ""yup"" and the proceeded to talk crap about my comment to another guide that was at least polite enough to stay 150ft away from meNo need to mention what camp the guide was from, but they use silver/unpainted lund alaskans"
1348055,vteye,2011-09-09 04:15:00,812,"Nice report the only way you eliminate the ""unwanted sharing"" of a producing spot is too be on a fly in one camp lake. That is of course till your buddy shows up and starts catching all the fish that were yours"
1348656,greenie,2011-09-11 09:44:00,87,"Yep, know what place your talking about. In the past when we've been anchored, just starting up the big 225 hp motor and throwing a fish tail into their boat gets the job done. His clients aren't very happy after that happens. I find it quite humerous and no problems then!! They keep their distance at that point."
