The one that I seem to remember is you need to have a 50 foot rope that floats. Are there other changes that have been made in respect to any province that I should be aware of? I will not be to LOTW for a few months, but will be in Manitoba the beginning of june. Any help would be appreciated.Thanks in advance.Steve"

512705,Guest,2001-05-22 13:08:00,0,OPP was out in NW Ontario Lakes in force on the weekend and charging people for infractions......... There was a familly of four killed on Kopka Lake south of Armstrong when their boat overturned on weekend.......Cut the officers a little slack when they are checking your safety equipment if you do not like being checked......Theres is a job that can be very trying at times.

512709,Skyraptor,2001-05-23 02:29:00,291,Here is a link that allows you to download the 2001 MNR Recreational Fishing Regulations Summary for Ontario. You will need a Adobe Acrobat Reader but it gives you all the regs for fishing and might have boating in as well. The link is: http://www.outdoor-adventures.com/anglers/laws.html

Only 40 miles or so of dirt road that is usually full of washboards. Definitely a road to stop and releive before taking. Headed up June 8Steve"
