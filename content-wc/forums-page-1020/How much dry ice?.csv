512759,chrism,2001-05-25 03:29:00,429,"I have used dry ice - It is very cold, about -170ish degrees celcius....So, keep this in mind...On my first trip with dry ice, we kept some fruit/veges/and liquid in the cooler - needless to say, they were all frozen solid! It will work good if you want to keep some meat or similar products frozen for the duration. I used I think 2lbs, and it lasted 4days, and the food was frozen for another two. 2lbs was a pretty big chunk.I have since resorted to filling the 2litre(quart) plastic coke bottles and freezing them. They will keep frozen for four days, and keep your cooler contents good for about 5-6 days. Just keep the cooler closed as much as possible, and keep out of the sun/wind. Usually put three in each cooler. Plus you can use the melted water as part of your water supply.I found for me, the trick is to eat the perishables within the first 1/2 or 2/3 of your trip while you still have plenty of ice, then eat the leftovers or whatever after that. And if you bring beer, drink it while it is cold!If you plan on keeping fish, don't keep any until the last day - they will not keep."

I've learned my lesson. Never again will I take anything more than will fit in/on my backpack. Unfortunately this includes beer!
