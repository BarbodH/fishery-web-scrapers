512633,darcyfish,2001-05-17 11:57:00,15,"Well jigs are always a good bet to bring,1/4to1/8 oz in size( leeches are bate of choice this time of year for walleyes as well as smallies).Bring a few crank baits(rattle traps,shad raps,husky jerks) usually perch or crayfish colors work good.If you have any questions drop me a line I fish all summer om LOTW.http://www.geocities.com/darcyfish54/1968.html"
512634,BD,2001-05-19 08:50:00,739,Crawler harnesses or floating jigs on a Lindy rig also work especially drifting or slow trolling. If you have a few Mirrolure jointed crankbaits in your collection bring them along. They are excellant trolling / casting the shallow structure.
