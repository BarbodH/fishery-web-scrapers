512468,Guest,2001-05-12 15:36:00,0,"Corker,This should be no problem, unless they have gotten hysterical about mad-cow disease. I've done this many times on many trips without any problems. They may ask you at the border if you have any food and how much, but usually not what kind. Hope this helps and good fishing.Remember to keep your eyes open and your feet dry.S.v.m"
