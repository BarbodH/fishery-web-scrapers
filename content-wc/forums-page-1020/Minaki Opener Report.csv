Fished in a variety of depths & found that the fish were rather negative. Most fish were caught close to the bridge in the slack water & also up by the Lodge. Only heard of 1 fish over 30inches caught, it was 31 1/2 and approx 12-13 pound range. The fish are in ""pre-spawn"" mode, the water is really high with fast current. Minnows worked best, found jigs to be ""ok"" but rigs seemed to be going best for us. Saturday night/ Sunday morning, major storm blew thru & caused the usual damage..... sunday was very rainy and generally not a nice day. Today it was cloudy & very windy, and the forecast was calling for more rain. After seeing the way it was today, I left early (to beat the highway rush)Bottom line, if you are heading up you'll have to work a bit for fish. Lots of eaters, but no biggies......I'm sure that it will explode in the next little while BUT who knows when !?Good FishenRobp.sCongrats to Bob Haig for nailing the biggie (it was released)The Little Puppy Guide was the ""Official"" Photographer"

I also noticed it was snowing up there on Tuesday. Pack the whole wardrobe! Plan on moving around to find the ""hot spots"". Thanks for your help, Torrey."
