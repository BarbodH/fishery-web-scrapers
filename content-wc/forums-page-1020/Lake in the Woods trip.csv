512367,dlhomes,2001-05-13 06:59:00,62,Check out my site www.lyberghomes.com I have a nice place and great location. Cabin is modern and fishing is usually good! I'll even mark some hotspots for you. Sept. is pretty much open. A inexpensive way to go!!
512368,Guest,2001-05-14 15:42:00,0,"WE have fished Nestor Falls for the last 15 years and have stayed at Sunset Lodge which is on Lake of the Woods, Housekeeping cabins, quiet bay, and priced right. Arrowhead is a decent place but is on the small lake that runs falls into LOTW, is less money, decent lake to fish, but would need to trailer your boat when on LOTW. You will really enjoy the mid to late september fishing as it has never dissappointed us. Crappie, walleye, Northern, and Muskie - you can catch them all.Hilliars Resort right at the Falls is a nice place, but probably full. Give me an email if you wish, we will be at Sunset september 15th."
512369,jeffster,2001-05-17 16:19:00,163,Thanks for all the info. They all sound great and I can't wait to go. jeffster
