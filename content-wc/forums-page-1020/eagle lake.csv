512549,Guest,2001-05-22 09:25:00,0,"Eagle Lake is a big lake with a lot of resorts on it. You will probably run into a lot of other boats. I was there in 95 and hit the may fly hatch and never caught a walleye. Im sure the fishing will be ok if you dont hit mayflies, but there will be a lot of other boats around all the hot spots. Good Luck!"
