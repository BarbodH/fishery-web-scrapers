512728,Wenty,2001-05-23 12:36:00,15,"Jack,Last week I bought 10 dozen minnows and 1/2 pound of leeches and it cost $45 (that's in Canadian funds). Ontario allows you to bring crawlers from home provided they're packed in artifical bedding.Hope this helps."
512730,Hunter,2001-05-23 14:14:00,346,Depends where you are going I paid $4 a dozen for worms on maitoulin island last year.

512731,Guest,2001-05-23 15:40:00,0,Does it really matter once you get there? Enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
512732,Guest,2001-05-23 18:21:00,0,GOOD POINT !!!!!!!!
512733,Guest,2001-05-24 05:17:00,0,$3-$4 / dozen for leeches and crawlers. Likely the same for live minnows. I don't know though as we can not use them in Sask.
512734,Guest,2001-05-24 10:52:00,0,"Jack---Salt up some minnows and take along. Work perfectly well, especiall when you dress a bait. You can aquire them here by seining, get them from a dealer--fresh dead or nearly for cheap.Prepare by covering in a mix of 1/4 salt and 3/4 borax( found in your wifes laundry area or in the s. market as a laundry product.) Keeps them pliable and preserves the color. Salt alone renders them into sticks."
