512614,Guest,2001-05-16 04:39:00,0,"I am planning to fish in the Shining Tree Ontario area in early September. Have never been there and am wondering about the fishing in the immediate area. Will be there with my wife, my brother and his wife. Any information about which lakes to fish and any local ""secrets"" would be greatly appreciated. We are most interested in walleye, northerns and smallmouth.Thanks, Canada Bound"
512615,Dave,2001-05-16 04:54:00,258,"Hey Canada Bound, there are numerous lakes in the Shining Tree area for walleye,pike and bass as well as lakers and specs.Are you staying at a lodge or camping. Okawakenda lake is a good one (my buddy has a camp on it)I'll get some more info at work(MNR) and e-mail to you if you send me your address.Dave"
512616,Guest,2001-05-16 05:12:00,0,Well I am 5 hours away from leaving on a trip to the area. Lake Sinclair is the target. It is connected to the bigger Lake Kapiskong just a little east of Lake Mattagami.No lodges around there so it is camping or trailer but some nice spots on the lake. The fishing is good for Pike and Walleye. There are a number of smaller lakes surrounding it that are great fishing but you have to find out which one is open because they are on a 5 year rotation.
512617,Guest,2001-05-17 06:54:00,0,"yes, not a bad place to fish."
512618,fishman,2001-05-23 03:55:00,60,"Fishing should be good when you are there. Any of the lakes in the area will usually have pike, however they usually are not of trophy size. Walleye should not be a problem. Smaller fish 1#-2#will be the rule though.Tight Lines"
