Any advice on lures such as jigs, spoons, spinners, crawler harnesses, etc., would be great. Thanks in advance!!!DC"

We mostly back troll with great success! 3/4 once wt., a 3 ft leader and a Phelps floater is all you need. We used all baits but did best on minnows and leeches. You can find the fish back trolling then jig once you find then. When you find weeds you can find pike and perch. Blade baits also woek for the walleye. you won't catch too many hogs but you will catch lots fish and memories! enjoy!"
