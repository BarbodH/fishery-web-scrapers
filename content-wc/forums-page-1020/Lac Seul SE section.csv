512190,Guest,2001-05-01 05:13:00,0,"Going to Lac Seul first week in June. Staying at Lost Island Lodge on the SE end of the lake. Was wondering if anyone has fished for ""eyes"" on that part of the lake and can let me in on some hot spots. Also, been trying to find a good detailed map for that part of the lake but no luck. Any ideas? Does anyone know when ice out is there or how much ice is left?? Any info would be great. Thanks!!"
512191,Kaz,2001-05-01 12:05:00,643,"Jiggin' I have stayed there several times.. Call Jim Hayes, He answers the winter number on the brochure,or he may be at the camp now and he can tell you where to get the maps. As for walleyes, we fished in a bay north of the bouy and around to thew left. Also over toward Peligen bay, but not all the way up to the rapids and falls. I think both of the guides are great. Old salts, and do not BS you as to where thew fish are and bitting. You will like the place a lot. Jim, the owner is always there and willing to help. I haven't found a better host!! The cabins are very nice and new too. I would still be going there if I didn't have a place of my own on Lake of the Woods, at Baudette. If you are from the Twin Cities let me know as I can fill you in better on the phone. Good luck FISHING...Kaz"
512192,Buznick,2001-05-02 17:58:00,7,"Jiggin Junky Im not sure where Lost Island Lodge is. Maybe you can give me a little more detail on the location. When you come to the area you can pick up great depth maps at the local fishing stores.Im sure your camp will have some. The ice is breaking up nowand should be out within a week, if not already in some areas.I hope this helps.Buznick"
512193,Kaz,2001-05-05 05:18:00,643,"Buznick: Looks like Jiggin disappeared. Lost Island is in the Hudson area. About 20/25 miles west of Souix Lookout. It is off shore about 3 miles from the Hudson landing. Nice place and rather new construction. Jim, the owner was a guide in that part of Lac Soul before he bought the island and built the cabins. Great deck for after dinner happy hour and swapping BS. They have a couple of older guides that have been there a long time and live in Nova Scotia in the winter. They know the lake and give you the right info. Maps can be had at the bait store just south of Lac Soul. Ken and Brenda, the owners of Ojibway Outfiters, a big camp at Chamberlain Narrows, also have the bait shop. I've stayed at both camps, both are nice, but the 40 mile trip over water to Chamberlain is just to much for these old bones. I now fish the Lake of the Woods exclusively out of Baudette. Good luck Fishing...Kaz"
512194,Guest,2001-05-06 07:17:00,0,"KAZ I have a cottage on Lac Seul . It's located on Sen Bay which isnorth of Sioux Lookout. I dont get down to the Hudson area as the fishing is great by our camp. I do make the odd trip to bear narrows and chamberlain narrows. Can't wait for the season to open . We make a pretty big deal out of the opening. The group of guys look forward to it every year. Saunas, fish derby, poker, cigars and the odd cool one. Can't wait!!!BUZNICK"
512195,RMB,2001-05-23 07:53:00,251,"Hey Kaz, In this group of guys that go to your cabin for opener is there a fellow from Grand Rapids that goes? Maybe just coincidence, but I met and talked with a guy at the boat landing by my house that talked of a big group of guys he goes with to this cabin someone owns in the very location you speak of. Super nice gentleman in retirement. I can't remember his name right now, but we shared info. on his maps and he was sure excited to go! The curiousity is killing me...."
512196,RMB,2001-05-23 07:56:00,251,"OOPS! I meant Buznik. PS: Jiggin Junky is my Sis. She's almost more of an addict than I am, hence the name....I said ALMOST!"
512197,Buznick,2001-05-23 08:42:00,7,"RMBNope, Nobody from Grand Rapids in our crew. Just got back from camp though. Once again great fishin ,good times and pretty good weather for opening season."
