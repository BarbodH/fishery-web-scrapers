533636,woods,2003-07-20 11:12:00,646,I'm thinking about a second trip to Minaki about Aug 15. Anyone had any experience fishing there that time of year? Thanks for any info.

533648,Reels,2003-07-20 19:16:00,2876,Weather is stable and fishing is good. Trolling bite and reef fishing is the ticket. It will be busy if your there the week of the Gary Roach Tourney. Lost of prefishing through the week. Still a good time to go. <{{}}><
