Anybody been >there recently, or have any information on ""must fish"" main >basin sand structures, islands, or sunken islands? Thanks! I fished Lac Suel with my 9 year old son June 14-28 out of Lac Suel Lodge (Rat Bay). Fishing was great! Fished South Bay a couple of days. Caught most of our fish in the southeast portion of bay near sandy shore in 5'-11' of water on jigs with white twister tails. Crawlers, leeches, & minnows seemed to work equally as well. Most fish 20"" plus. One 27"" 2 - 26"" & a lot of 24's & 25's. Another group in camp were catching a lot (50-75 a day) of smallies in the South Inlet, up to 19"". Also fished McKenzie Bay - Big & Little Sandbanks & rock humps with same type of success. We are guessing we caught 1000 walleye in our two weeks. Hated to come home."
