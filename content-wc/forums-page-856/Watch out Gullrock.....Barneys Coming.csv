I have fished with Barney in the past and he is without a doubt the best Walleye fisherman I have ever seen. I actually have never seen him miss a fish. He is a Master and all those who fish in his presence should watch his technique and learn from #1."
533598,BD,2003-07-18 15:23:00,739,Is Barney also known as Mike Kansas? ;) If he really is #1 there are allways the wannabees. Do you think he is up to a few hundred challenges from the guys that surf this site? Like the gunfighters in the old movies; Someone is allways out to take over the top spot! Barney better be wearing his bullet - er - lure proof vest! :)
533617,Guest,2003-07-19 14:28:00,0,Barney never wears a lure proof vest. He just wears that big purple outfit and those big purple shoes....he is the biggest fish catching plumb you ever saw.
