I've been reading all about Lac Seul & decided to make my first trip up there this year. What a wonderful experience!! We caught hundreds of walleyes in 6 1/2 days of fishing. I've been reading what a great lake,but could not believe the numbers & size of fish. You always hear stories about how great the fishing is & when you get there your disappointed, not this time! Just a wonderful trip & thanks to all who post & for all the great tips!"

Always stayed down the lake a little further, at Lac Seul Lodge or Fisherman's Cove. Need info for fishing spots in the reagion of Goose Bay or the northern section of the lake."

533553,Jesse-WI,2003-07-16 21:16:00,534,It is always to hear great reports. My group is going to be in the area in mid August. Would you care to share more detail about your trip?
533567,Guest,2003-07-17 09:49:00,0,"In late July and August the Ear Falls area has some very consitent fishing. Fish can be had around Cox's Island and surrounding island structures, just about any point or Island in Steamboat, and the mud banks near the entrance to Sawmill. You can have some good fishing if you find the reefs on the main lake. If you take the time to locate the reefs you will usually be by yourself. If it is sunny, plan on getting up early and take the mid-day off or go to pike fishing, then hit the morining areas in evening. If it is cloudy the walleyes are usually active all day. Presentations can range from draging spinners and lindys with crawlers to verticle jigging minnows in the deeper water. I've had equal sucess with both. Just depends on the day. I would take a flat of crawlers. I haven't stayed at Goose for over 10 years, but I was very satisfied with them. TGG"
533568,Guest,2003-07-17 10:01:00,0,Heading up to scout lake in a few weeks. What are they doing about shore lunches because of the dry conditions?
533571,Guest,2003-07-17 11:20:00,0,"At the time we were at Scout lake there was no fire ban, so shore lunches were not a problem. As for locations, any of the islands in Mckenzie bay held fish,but for us the best locations were the islands or reefs with deep water near by. As for presentations, bottom bouncer & crawler were by far the most productive. We also caught fish on jig & leech, jig & minnows. I was suprised how well the jig & leech combo worked, most of the time outfishing the jig & minnow combo. There are two reefs located just off of the big sandbanks that are now exposed because of the low water. We did very well on these reefs. We also caught fish off of Deer islands. There is 1 small island SE of Moose island with an exposed rock pile about 75 yds away & we caught lots of fish from this spot, hope this helps!"
