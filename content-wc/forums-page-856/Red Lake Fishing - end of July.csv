532433,Guest,2003-06-17 11:47:00,0,"I am heading up to Red Lake Ontario the end of July with my sons high school football team. I agreed to be one of the chaperones. I have never been there before. We are staying at an outpost camp on the southwide side of the lake. Can anyone give me advice on where to begin looking for the walleyes that time of year? How deep of water will they typically be in? What should I use to catch them, leeches, crawlers, minnows, or trolling rapalas? Will they be in weeds, on rocks, around points, etc? Any help you can give would be great, I want to make sure these kids have a good time and catch fish. I know its the first time most if not all have been to this lake."
532902,Guest,2003-06-26 07:45:00,0,"I HAVE BEEN FISHING RED LAKE FOR MANY YEARS AND LATE JULY CAN BE A GREAT TIME FOR WALLEYE- (BOTH SIZE AND NUMBERS.) I WOULD STAY IN THE EASTERN (SHALLOW) PART OF THE LAKE TO START. YOU WILL NEED AN MAP TO LOCATE THE FOLLOWING SPOTS... START AT THE NARROW MOUTH OF McNEELY BAY IN THE ROCKS AND WEEDS. YOU WILL FIND PADS WEEDS AND ROCKS HERE. THE CHUKUNI RIVER TO GULLROCK IS OFTEN A GREAT PLACE WHEN IT IS HOT AND THE ACTION IS SLOW. THE KEY HERE IS TO FIND THE HEAVEST CURRENT!! THE SOUTHWEST SHORE OF McKENZIE ISLAND CAN BE GOOD 8'-20' AROUND THE ROCKS. MOST OF THESE SPOTS WILL PRODUCE WITH JIGS,MINNOWS,CRAWLERS AND LEACHES OR SLIP BOBBERS WITH THE SAME. I WILL START WITH A BOTTOM BOUNCER AND A HARNESS TO LOCATE THEM AND SWITCH TO JIGS OR BOBBERS AFTER I HAVE FOUND THEM. A LOCATOR WILL HELP OUT AS WELL. THE WESTERN (DEEP) SIDE OF THE LAKE IS GREAT FOR LAKE TROUT AND NORTHERS. LET ME KNOW IF YOU NEED ANY OTHER INFO. GOOD FISHING! I WILL BE UP JULY 4-12 SYLVAN"
532912,Guest,2003-06-26 11:18:00,0,"Sylvan, thanks for responding. I almost gave up on feedback. What color and jig size would you recommend. I have read in previous archives that pink and chartreuse are good colors for red lake. Is this true? Also, what sizes would you recommend? How about spinner rigs? Thanks for any additional info you can provide. It will mean alot to the group of boys I am bringing up (and my sanity)."
532959,Thumper,2003-06-27 09:33:00,133,"Hi, Verlund You're staying at an outpost on the South West side of the lake? Is it called something like Black Bear or Bear Paw? If that's the camp then, frankly, I'd forget about the boat ride over to the Chukuni or Gull Rock. That's quite a haul to take in a camp boat, probably over an hour and I don't know that it would be all that productive. I stayed at Bow Narrows 2 years ago. We did pretty well on what I believe was called the West Arm. It's the bay just North West of Bow Narrows. We would drag spinner rigs (orange & chartreuse) with night crawlers on the north-side bay of that bay. We'd also get pike and walleye at the mouth of Pipestone bay. An Orange and Silver hammered spoon did very well for the pike there. There are a handful of islands berween Black Bear and Bow Narrows that would hold baitfish and some walleyes there. White or Chartreuse jig with preserved minnows took a few from there. You can also troll & drift the Bow Narrows for Lake Trout. I heard that Black Bear camp is pretty rustic. Hope this helps! - Rick"
532963,Guest,2003-06-27 10:53:00,0,"Thumper, thanks for the info. Yes we are staying at Black Bear Outpost. You are right, it is suppose to be very rustic, hopefully not too much but I have no choice...my sons footbal team booked the trip. Do you have any idea where the best place would be to put a boat in. I am being told that I have to go to the town of Red Lake and put in there. I was wondering if there are any places closer or if any other resorts near Black Bear would allow me to drop in for a charge. Thanks again for the info."
532976,Roadhog,2003-06-27 20:21:00,17,"The West end of Red Lake is a beautiful area. Red Lake has some very deep bays, Trout Bay is close to 100' in some spots. The lake is essentially a trout lake (a 43# lake trout was caught in 1983) but there has been a problem the spawning of the trout and you are not allowed to keep any trout from the lake. In fact it would be preferred by camp owners, in my opinion, that lake trout not be fished at all until the population can make a comeback. That being said....the fishing for walleye and northern is more difficult since the lake has so many deep bays rather than shallow bays. This is coupled with the fact that Black Bear runs approximately 100 people/week through camp. If all of these people catch their limit of 4 Northern & 4 Walleye the fishery comes under a lot of pressure. I am speaking from experience as I fished the lake for 20 years out of Bow Narrows Camp. Bow Narrows is a great camp with great owners but the competition from Black Bear depletes the resources. Take some time to study the history of the area. The Red Lake gold rush in the 1920's was really something to behold. At one time during the peak of the gold rush the population in the Red Lake area was over 10,000. There were more planes flying in and out of Red Lake than any other place in North America. Miners used to get off the train in Hudson, Ontario (at the East end of Lac Seul) and make their way NW to Red Lake a distance of well over 100 Miles! I was told of one miner who made the trek by building his own rafts in order to navigate the lakes as much as possible. When came to the end of the body of water and had to resume hiking he dismantled the raft and saved all the lashings and nails for the next raft. Trees were plentiful but nails were hard to come by! Enjoy your time with your son."
533148,Thumper,2003-07-02 11:14:00,133,"Sorry, Verlund. I'm not sure of any other places to put in that would be closer then the Red Lake Marina. There are a few places on the East side of the lake, but that won't help you much. The only resort I can think of that would be any closer than the marina is called comething like Sunset or Sunrise, but it's pretty much right in town. I'm not sure that he even offers a launch. If you find any other launches or resorts, let me know! I always want to learn more. - Rick"
533151,Guest,2003-07-02 12:32:00,0,"Rick, thanks for the info. I was just trying to avoid the long boat ride. Do you know how long a boat ride it would be from the Marina to Black Bear Outpost? I hear anywhere from 30 min to an hour. Thanks again Steve"
533163,Guest,2003-07-02 14:08:00,0,"D Keyzer, If you are going to be there from July 5th to the 12th then you must be aware that your uncle will be there at that time as well. See you there. Ambler"
533194,Guest,2003-07-03 09:29:00,0,"VERLUND, I DO AGREE WITH ROADHOG THAT WE ARE BEING TOLD THAT THE LAKE TROUT FISHING HAS BEEN ON THE SLIDE FOR MANY YEARS AND MOST OF THE LOCALS HAVE DISCOURAGED TROUT FISHING FOR SOME TIME. HOWEVER I DO GET A KICK OUT OF BLACK BEAR LODGE WHEN THEY COME TO THE LOCAL SPORT SHOW OR THE ALL CANADA SHOW AND PUT UP THE BOOTH THAT IS WALLPAPERED WITH STRINGERS OF DEAD LAKE TROUT! WE STILL C.P.R. MANY NICE LAKE TROUT FROM THE WESTERN PART OF THE LAKE EVERY YEAR AND THIS YEAR WILL BE NO DIFFERENT. THE KEY IS TO CAREFULLY RELEASE ALL OF THESE FISH. A 20# LAKER HAS BEAT MANY ODDS TO GROW TO THAT SIZE AND IF THE POPULATION AND NATURAL REPRODUCTION IS DECLINING, WE MAY NOT BE FISHING LAKERS FOR LONG. IM SORRY FOR NO INFO ON WALLEYE FISHING THE WEST END DUE TO THE FACT THAT WE STAY ON THE EAST END. HOWEVER YOU HAVE HAD SOME GOOD REPORTS ON SOME KEY LOCATIONS. I WILL ADD THIS, WE ALWAYS RUN INTO A FEW GIANT NORTHERS ON THE WEST END WHEN WE FISH DEEP WATER FOR TROUT. ALWAYS A BONUS! GOOD FISHING"
533453,Guest,2003-07-14 08:21:00,0,"Here's the report from Black Bear Lodge for the week of July 6-12. Fishing was very good, but you had to work at it. The lake is warmer than Kim Markshausen, the lodge owner, can remember it. The pike have gone deep. Look for them on rock piles and in weed beds with immediate access to deep water. Martin's Bay has lots of good structure for this pattern. They were also being caught by some campers by trolling rapalas along deep rocky shorelines near the entrance to south bay. Put a rubber core sinker four to six feet up the line to get them down a bit. The walleye, on the other hand, were excellent. We hit on a pattern where the walleye were coming shallow in the evenings to feed on a bug hatch. We back trolled spinner rigs tipped with leeches or crawlers through the hatch and caught lots of them. They only bite on this pattern for about one and a half hours near dusk, though. We didn't have much wind while we were up there, which made it hard to catch them otherwise. When the wind did blow, we simply fished the shorlines that the waves were hitting, and did well, again on spinner rigs with leeches or crawlers. We caught them as shallow as 8 feet and as deep as 30 feet doing this. For the week, we lost count of how many total walleye we caught, but I would have to say it was over 150. We had one 27 inches in length, three 26, one 25, three 24, and many 18 to 23. It is an excellent walleye lake. If you get a little less warmth, and a little more wind, you will have a ball. Good Fishing"
533456,Guest,2003-07-14 09:31:00,0,"Hey ""Just got back"" it sounds like you were with our group who just returned yesterday. That was about our exact fish total, you wouldn't live near Peoria by any chance. I'll give you a call today. A word of advice to anyone who gives credence to the previous negatively slanted poster. Red lake is overwhelming is size. There is more water than you can learn in a lifetime. Yes, the lake trout are down in numbers, but camp people and year round residents also will tell you that the locals take a fifteen minute snowmobile ride out to that area in the winter and hammer that fishery hard. I think it is somewhat lame to blame a camp that primarily focuses on walleye and Pike fishing for the demise of the lakers. If you visit the lodge oh biased one, you would see for yourself the number of Walleye and Pike photos of trophy and quality fish brougth in outnumber the Lakers over the last twenty or so years by at least a 30:1 ratio. Kim and Susan Markshausen do an outstanding job. They are asking the locals to institute a total ban on trout fishing in Red Lake, and in the meantime they are encouraging campers to either not fish for them, or at least release them if you do catch one. The walleye fishing was better than I have ever experienced in the over ten years I have visited Red Lake. We caught them shallow, deep and anywhere in between. Yes the lake was exceedingly warm for that lattitude, 70 degrees when 61 is normal for that time of year, and the pike have responded by leaving their shallow weedbed homes and living around deeper and colder rock piles or points. This makes them harder to access for kids in camp boats due to the lack of depth finders, but you will catch them while walleye fishing and trolling. All in all a good to excellent trip as many of our group caught their personal largest walleyes ever. Great pictues and superb nothern lights make waiting for our trip next year a bit easier. Thanks again to the Markshausen's for their hospitality and support of our students. Ambler"
533460,Guest,2003-07-14 11:24:00,0,"Ambler, thanks for the info. I am starting to get excited. I am leaving next Friday to head up to Black Bear. Can you give me any locations where to start looking for walleyes? You can email me if you wish. My address is on a previous email. Thanks Steve"
533464,bronzeback77,2003-07-14 13:35:00,97,"I would recommend White Pine Lodge on Lake of the Woods. It is located near Sioux Narrows on Snake Bay, just 10 minutes from Whitefish. It is a drive in lodge but is very secluded (located 1 mile off the main road and on it own large peninsula). I have been up six years in a row and have had a wonderful time each year. Many of the guest have been coming 10 20 even 40 years in a row. They have very good American and Housekeeping packages for people who bring up their own boat. All of the cabins have Satellite Television for the girls incase they get sick of fishing, plus a beach and water trampoline. Their website is www.whitepinelodge.ca or if you have any other questions email me at [email protected]. My wife and I caught over 400 Bass this past year when we were up and I am sure we will do just as well next year"

533482,Guest,2003-07-14 20:44:00,0,"ONCE AGAIN THE JOURNEY BEYOND THE PAVEMENT TO RED LAKE HAS BECOME BUT A SOUL CLENSEING MEMORY. FISHING WAS UNBELIEVABLE! QTY. & QUALITY WAS GREAT. MOST WALLEYES CAME ON JIGS WITH (CLEAR)CHRTREUSE TWISTER TAILS (JUST HEAVY ENOUGH TO FEEL THE ROCKS) TIP WITH 1/2 OF A CRAWLER (HOOKED ONCE!) OR A MINNOW HOOKED THROUGH THE TOP OF THE HEAD. LOOK FOR EDGES OF ROCK REEFS IN THE 15-20 FOOT RANGE DURING THE DAY AND UP TO 8-12 FOOT AT DUSK OR DARK. TRY TO FIND THE REEFS THAT BOTTOM OUT AT 20-30'. STAY AWAY FROM THE BOTTOMLESS REEFS THAT ARE COMMON ON THE WEST END. VERY FEW WALLEYE WILL HANG OUT HERE. YOU MAY SEE FISH ON YOUR LOCATOR ON THE DEEPER REEFS, HOWEVER YOU MAY BE SEEING WHITE FISH, NORTHERS, LAKE TROUT, OR LING. THE SURFACE TEMP. IS WARM HOWEVER AT 35' IT IS A DIFERENT STORY. ONCE AGAIN I PRIMAIRLY FISHED THE EAST END OF THE LAKE HOWEVER I HAVE TO BELIEVE THE SAME TRICKS WILL WORK FOR YOU ON THE WEST SIDE. IF THINGS GET SLOW, TAKE OFF THE TWISTER TAIL AND USE A PLAIN LEAD JIG HEAD (NO COLOR!) WITH ONLY A MINNOW HOOKED LIGHTLY THROUGH THE LIPS OR THE TAIL - FISH THIS VERY SLOW AND KEEP IT 4-6"" OFF OF THE ROCKS. (VERTICLE JIG) AS FOR THE NEGATIVELY SLANTED POST, I DO AGREE WITH THE FACT THAT THE LAKE IS BIG, HOWEVER IT IS NOT THAT BIG! NOW DON'T GET ME WRONG, I AM NOT SAYING THAT THE REASON THE TROUT FISHING IS IN THE RED IS DUE TO ANY ONE LODGE, I AM SIMPLY SAYING FOY YEARS, THE BEAR HAS BEEN PROMOTING THE HARVEST OF LAKE TROUT TO PROMOTE BUSINESS. IN FACT JUST THIS MARCH AT THE LOAL SPORTSHOW, THE SHOCK & AWE TROUT PICTURES WERE FLYING HIGH! AS FOR THE TROUT, THE POSESSION LIMIT HAS BEEN CLOSED DUE TO THE ONGOING MNR LAKE TROUT RESEARCH. MANY SPECULATE THEY WILL CLOSE THE SEASON ALLTOGETHER NEXT YEAR.(A GREAT IDEA IF IT WILL HELP SAVE THE FISH!)- THE THEORY BEHIND THE DECLINE IS THE PRESANCE OF A VITAMIN THAT IS FOUND IN THE SMELT THE TROUT ARE EATING. (NOT THE LOCAL FURRY CLAD SNOWMOBILING ICE FISHERMAN OR THE BLACK BEAR LODGE) THE VITAMIN IS CAUSING THE TROUT TO BECOME NON REPRODUCTIVE. SIMILAR TO THE SITUATION IN LAKE MICHIGAN. ALL I AM SAYING IS WE CAN ALL DO OUR PART. GOOD LUCK! AND ENJOY THE POWERFUL SPIRIT-RECHARGING FUEL THAT IS A FEW DAYS JUST A LITTLE CLOSER TO HEAVEN!"
533492,Guest,2003-07-15 08:05:00,0,Thanks to all of you who have posted a reply to this topic. I really appreciate your feedback and help getting my trip started in the right direction. Special thanks to Dave for taking the time to talk with me. I will post my results when I return. Thanks again and good fishing to all. Steve
533562,Guest,2003-07-17 07:28:00,0,The lack of fish in the west end of the lake doesn't have anything to do with the fishing pressure. It's due to all of the mercury leaking out of the mines!
533474,Guest,2003-07-14 19:21:00,0,"It is a little difficult to say an exact place where to find the walleye. It depends on the wind direction. For example-I had my best overall day of fishing when I just stayed in South Bay, not more than 1000 yards from the lodge. The wind was blowing from west to east, and I fished the eastern shore, where the waves were crashing into a shoreline which had a rocky drop off and a weed bed nearby. I caught my 26 incher there, and a student fishing with me caught a 22 incher there not 15 seconds after my big fish. We took our limit in a little less than an hour, and caught and released many more. It was great. In the next few days, the wind changed, and the walleye moved out. Other campers went back and fished there, but caught only perch and a couple of small pike. So, you can see that it is hard to tell you one guaranteed spot to fish. Look for rocky shorelines with deep water access nearby that the wind is blowing into and fish there. Keep trying these spots, and don't be afraid to move around to new spots. If the fish are there, they will hit. If you don't get bites, they probably aren't there. Use spinner rigs tipped with a leech or half a crawler, and you will get bit if the fish are there. I personally always got the kids that were fishing with me on the fish by doing this. Best spinner blade colors were orange, chartruese, or my favorate, a chartruese blade with an orange stripe. Red beads for the body, and a number eight octopus hook."
533043,Guest,2003-06-30 10:05:00,0,"Verlund, I don't usually post mesages but I will in this case since I think you are receiving some inaccurate information. I have going up to BBL since 1980 and have not missed a year yet. I started going with a high school group and enjoyed the people, lake, etc. so much that now I bring my wife up there for vacation (23 years later). Some call the lodge rustic since the cabins do not have running water, but there is a shower house and toilets. My wife has never complained about the accomodations and she's not much for using an outhouse. The lodge averages more like 70 per week, very few of which even take any fish home. Now to fishing...Red Lake is not just a lake trout lake, although one of the best spots for them is right in front of the lodge. Actually In-fisherman rated it as one of the top 5 walleye lakes in Ontario. Considering the competition, thats quite a title! The walleye fishing on the South-West side of the lake has made an incredible comeback since the early 80's in my opinion. The numbers are way up as is the size. The area around BBL is far from fished out and is getting better every year. Now for bait... We have done very well in recent years trolling spinner rigs/minnow around points and rock bars. Late July you will most likely find the fish in 10 - 18 feet of water (a depth finder would definately help). We just pinch a 1/4 oz split shot 3 feet up the line to get down to them. Once you find them you can always jig if you don't like to troll. Color has never really mattered as much as the size for jigging. Try to use the lightest jig possible to get the bait down and still keep your line relatively straight. It can be difficult jigging given the rocky bottom, but it can be very productive. Casting minnow baits with a little weight can work well too. The lodge sells minnows cheaper than what you can buy them for in town so we just get them there. You will get maps from the lodge on your arrival which well help with navigation. The first spots I go to are (in order of popularity) 1) East end of Wolf Bay 2) North shore of Golden arm - watch for rock bar 3) East side of Wolf island. We have also had some good fishing in South Bay right across from the camp. So even if the weather out on the big lake is crappy you can still get out and fish. Oh, I have never needed to go all the way to the East side of the lake to catch fish. It's a haul and if you're anything like me you would never get there. Too many good looking spots to try on the way. Sorry for rambling, but you'll have a great time. Food is good, owners are very nice people, and the fishing can be spectacular. (I talked to the lodge owner this past week and the fishing reports have been better than previous years). I will be up there the week of July 5th. Let me know if you would like a report. Good luck."
533047,Guest,2003-06-30 11:23:00,0,"DKeyser, thanks for the valuable info. I really appreciate your honest feedback. I would really appreciate a report when you get back. You can email me at [email protected] if you would like or post it here. Again, thanks for taking the time to give me input. Good luck on your trip."
533069,Guest,2003-06-30 17:06:00,0,"Hey D Keyzer, Are you by any chance related to a B Keyzer who teaches Physics? I know he will be up there over the week of July 5th as well. Thanks, Ambler"
533108,Guest,2003-07-01 12:00:00,0,"Funny you would ask, he's actually my uncle. Knowing that we are usually up there at this time he asked my father if he was going up there that week. We weren't planning on going this year since my wife just had a baby. My dad pestered me enough that I broke down and called the owners right before they went up. As luck would have it they could squeeze us in."
