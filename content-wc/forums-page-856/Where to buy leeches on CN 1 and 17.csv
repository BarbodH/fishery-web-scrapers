Scroll to bottom of the page and do a search for any city/town along your route to get a listing of bait shops (addresses and contact numbers are provided). Select ""match phrase"" and ""city"" as search criteria. A search on Dryden produces 5 listings. Not all bait shops are listed but you should be able to get the information you want from those that are."
