533011,Guest,2003-06-29 13:36:00,0,"I'm planning on going to canada fishing this late august or early september. I'm looking for a nice ""drive to"" resort with excellent boats with electric trolling motors and something out of the way where it isn't so crowded. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Just not sure whether to go to Lake of the Woods or Rainy lake. Size or type of fish is not important, just like to catch fish and enjoy the quiet and the beauty of the area. Thanks for your help Mike"
533022,balsl6,2003-06-29 21:58:00,426,I prefer the NW angle Lake of the woods? It is less crowded and very scenic. The fishing is about the same as rainy maybe a little better?? Accomadations are about the same. I listed the North West Angle Chamber of Commerce website below it list all of the resorts and directions. Good Luckhttp://www.lakeofthewoodsresorts.com/
533056,bronzeback77,2003-06-30 13:36:00,97,"Lake of the Woods for sure, Rainy can be very crowded at that time of the year with all of the Bass Tournaments. I stay in the WhiteFish Bay area on LOTW and don't see that many people. You can contact me at [email protected] and I can give you all the info you need to have a great trip."
533101,Guest,2003-07-01 09:28:00,0,"Bronzeback77 I fished Whitefish Bay two days last week last week (6-22). You are right it is a beautiful uncrowded place to hang around. The the fishing was really good. I spent most of my time throwing hair for muskie and caught a lot of northerns in the process. I had a couple of good follows by muskies, but no hits. My fishing partners concentrated on bass and were very sucessful especially on Largemouth. There were too many small northerns to count. We put in at Vic and Dots on the south end. I would like to go back for a week in late August. I want to concentrate of the muskies, but walleyes would also be on the agenda. Do you you have any recommedations for a resort. Thanks TGG"
533103,bronzeback77,2003-07-01 10:24:00,97,"I do have a recommendation. I have stayed at White Pine Lodge, on Snake Bay, six years in a row and plan on going back every year until I am fishing in that Big Lake in the Sky. The owners are great and the place is awesome. You can check out their website at www.whitepinelodge.ca They are reasonably priced and I am sure you would have great time there. I fish mostly for Bass but have had many outstanding Walleye days up there. I have never fished for Musky but I know that the fishing is very good around Timber and Bell Islands, which is only 15-20 minutes from the lodge. If you want more info email me at [email protected]."

533602,WCoyote,2003-07-18 20:33:00,200,"Mike, Flip a coin, your can't go wrong with either place. I have fished them both multiple times. Neither may be heaven, but they are about as close as you can get on earth. wea"
533621,Guest,2003-07-19 17:17:00,0,"Mike - You might want to check out www.witchbay.com There are a number of your fellow ""Show Me"" fishermen (and ladies) who return year after year.....for the great fishing, superb service and accomodations, serene scenery and relatively isolated location. Decisions, decisions, decisions......have fun deciding and planning. Lunker"
