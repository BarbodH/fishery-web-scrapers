533534,Stevie B,2003-07-16 12:24:00,157,Anybody know what an older 2hp Evinrude would be worth? It hasn't run in a few years but I was told that it was in great shape. Please let me know. Thanks Fish ON!!

533556,Guest,2003-07-17 00:13:00,0,go to the NADA web site they have a free site that gives the value of motors. This is the address. www.NADAguides.com they have a section on outboard engines
533557,Guest,2003-07-17 00:19:00,0,I looked it up. the ejres i think for a 1990 model was a 2hp model and was valued at 90 dollors. that was the only gas engine the rest for 2hp were electric.
533565,Troutbeck,2003-07-17 09:19:00,682,"Stevie: The 2hp OMCs I'm familiar with are regular water-cooled motors. Our guide in Canada has one and it works great for getting back to small, walk-in lakes. If it's in good condition and is not TOO old, I'd say it's worth a couple hundred bucks. Like anything else, It's worth what people are willing to pay for it. Good luck! Trout"
