The wife and I had a difficult time catching walleyes within the slot length.We caught some nice larger ones and alot of 12/13"" walleyes. The pike fishing was really good even though I wasn't there for pike. Constantly caught medium length chunky pike with spinnerbaits fished in the deeper water around midlake humps. Bass were a nice average size but the bass fishing tailed off after a couple of thunder storms rolled through.I would go there again but plan on making longer boating runs from camp. Since it was my first visit and I had the ball& chain along I didn't make any runs much past Moore Island. My wife also dislikes trolling which really may have limited my chances. Thanks for asking. P.S. This was my first visit to NW Ontario and I will be definitely returning next year,although I am looking at Lac Seul."
