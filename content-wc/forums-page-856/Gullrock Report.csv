533488,Guest,2003-07-15 05:09:00,0,"Jeff, I just got back from Gullrock on the 12th. There were a few mayflies around which may have had something to do with the fishing. We caught quite a few fish not quite like I have in the other 27 years I have went to Gullrock but I can't say it ws the worse trip I have ever had. This is the first time I have been there in July though. We usually go in August. Anyway, we caught quite a few shorts (12-14 inch fish) and quite a few over the 18 inch slot. We were having trouble finding fish in the 16-18 inch length. We caught fish anywhere from 16 feet down to 27 feet with the smaller fish being caught in the deeper water. Oh yeah, my son (6 years old) did catch a 26 1/2 incher in 12 feet of water! We caught some of the bigger fish on leeches and most of the smaller fish on minnows. I also did quite well on those new Berkley Gulp swimming minnows (3"" twister tails). We did have a bear in camp 6 out of the 7 nights we spent there and got a chance to see him one morning. We also saw a cow moose with 2 calves on the way home north of Ear Falls. So be careful! This is my second trip up there this summer and we have seen moose both times along the road in the early morning. Have a great trip and let us know how you do when you get back! Renn"

533500,2746,2003-07-15 10:28:00,3206,Jeff We are headed to Gullrock the first week in Aug and would be interested in your experience when you get back. Have a good time!
533519,VANT,2003-07-15 17:18:00,68,"Hey Larry, Wwe're heading to Gullrock the first week of August, also. Where are you guys staying? We'll be at McEwen's. Yeah Jeff, make sure you post what was happening for your group. Thanks, VANT"
533544,Guest,2003-07-16 17:43:00,0,"Jeff, I will be going back up, for the third time this summer, the first week of Aug. If you couldn't tell I am kind of a Gullrock freak!!! We caught most of our walleyes at marker island and the boot, all along the shore from the heel to the toe. My 6 year old son popped a 26 1/2 incher off the flats as well. There weren't too many boats on the lake that week which really suprised me. I am use to quite a bit of boat traffic while I am there but our camp owners said the the week of the 4th is typically a slow week for all of the camps. Good luck and I will be looking forward to hearing a report when you get back. Renn"
533552,2746,2003-07-16 21:00:00,3206,Vant We'll be at five lakes lodge (my wife and I). Was up late last summer for the first time with the guys and liked it so much my wife and I are going and then I'll be back the last week in Aug with a group of guys. We're new enough we are still learning the lake (lakes actually) but it's a great fishery. Also like plying a little golf in Red Lake while we are there.
