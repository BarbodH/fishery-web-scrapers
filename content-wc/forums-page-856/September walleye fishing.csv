We're not so interested in lakes to fish but rather what kind of fishing (quantity and quality) we could reasonably expect. We have just returned from a very warm week of walleye fishing that resulted in calls for a change to the time of year we go fishing. Early September has been suggested. Although many of you might recommend a switch to June, the majority of our group want to avoid those pesky bugs (black flies and mosquitos) typically associated with that month. None of us have fished walleyes in September and we would very much appreciate your advice or your experience. Thanks."

It seems like once you find them it is like in the spring, you can catch them one after the other. It also seems that once you find the big fish(above 21"") that is all you catch nothing smaller and if you are catching the smaller fish that is all you will catch. They don't seem to hang out together. Our biggest fish in the spring has been 29"" and in the fall 27"" so I really don't see the difference. Reasons I like the Fall better are; weather except it seems it can be windier,no bugs,less boats,leaves turning,woodstove smoke and a chance for BIG Pike. I'm no expert just my opinion."

We have been going to the Savant Lake area of Northwest Ontario during the month of September for the past 20+ years. Usually go the 1st or 2nd week in the month. We went right after Labor Day last year and it was so darn hot and the skeeters so bad that we decided to move it back a week. Will be leaving on the 10th this year. Hopefully we will have a killing frost by then and fewer bugs. There have been years when we built snow men though, so be prepared for anything when it comes to the weather at that time of year. We have found the fishing to run between very good and excellent during September. Probably not as good as early June but you will catch fish. We usually troll for walleyes and there have been years when you couldn't go a 100 feet without catching a fish. And this would be on a cloudless day with no wind!( not your typical walleye weather). On the other hand we have had years where you really had to work to get your shore lunch each day. Same lake, same weather conditions. Seems to be the same for pike as well. We have speculated that some of it probably has to do with water level and when the lake turns over. Can't control either one of those things. The lake we fish is small, only about 2 miles square and is quite shallow, averaging about 10-12 feet deep. Walleyes run small, usually about 1-1/2 to 2 pounds with the occasional 3#. The northerns are another matter. Many fish in the 38+"" range. Really amazing for such a small body of water. Evidently the combination of food resources and cover is sufficient to support so many large pike. As I mentioned we usually troll. Mainly use Storm Thinfins and jointed Rapalas. The Thinfins have been excellent producers for us over the years. Even on northerns. You hear this business about using larger lures for larger fish. Over the years our group has landed many fish over 40"" on the small Thinfin so I don't necessarily believe that. Too bad Storm quit making them. For many years we stayed at a fish camp and drove out to the lake to fish. Only 25 miles but took over an hour to get in. You can only go about 5 miles an hour on some of those old logging roads. Got to be such a pain in the rear that we have been camping at the lake for the last 6 years or so. We take good tents and equipment so it really is quite enjoyable. Hope that helps. RB"
