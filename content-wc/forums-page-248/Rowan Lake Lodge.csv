1519019,Chops,2013-01-02 17:40:00,56,"Lakerbreaker, I hear ya. Not sure just yet when I'll be heading up, but we try to get 2 or 3 trips in per winter. Where do you stay when you go?"
1519020,lakerbreaker,2013-01-02 17:45:00,253,"Chops, we stay at Muskie Bay on Crow....usually don't fish Rowan but planning on traveling through it to get elsewhere..where do you guys stay? PM me if you want-"
1519023,Chops,2013-01-02 17:54:00,56,"Lakerbreaker, we stay at Nielsens outpost cabin on Rowan. We also go back into Hill on occasion. Good luck this weekend."
1519038,lakerbreaker,2013-01-02 18:13:00,253,"Chops, out of curiosity I tried to find some info regarding that cabin in the winter and couldn't find any info on their site....how do you rent it?"
1519048,Chops,2013-01-02 18:42:00,56,"Lakerbreaker, You can call Don Pursch -the owner of Nielsens. His information is listed on their website. It is at the bottom of the contact us page. They don't list it as a winter rental on their website. They are the second and third housekeeping cabins on their website-maybe cabins 11 and 12."
1519053,lakerbreaker,2013-01-02 18:57:00,253,"Thanks for the info-those cabins look pretty rustic. I am guessing no water in the winter? We have gotten pretty spoiled at MB with a three bedroom, satellite TV, dishwasher etc....We met the owners of the cabin on Hill a few years ago up there when we picked up a member of their party when their sled blew up on the East end of Rowan. Nice bunch of guys from Grand Rapids if I remember right...Good luck to you too and thanks for the info on Nielsen's..."
1520545,Stu,2013-01-07 07:12:00,472,"We've stayed at Nielsen's twice. The last time we were there we boated up to Hook N Horn and checked them out. It was a nice place, but not as nice at Nielsen's. They catered almost exclusively to Canadians."
4227490,Guest,2015-09-27 15:16:00,0,"Rowan Lake Lodge was in business in 2015, but the owner Bob, passed away. I believe his widow, Linda, is trying hard to sell it and may have a buyer. I fished Rowan Lake over Labor Day 2015 and had never been there before. A couple of muskies, but literally hundreds and hundreds of Smallmouth Bass, ample northern pike and many largemouth bass as well. The lake trout fishing was the best I've ever had on an inland lake. The walleye were hard to come by, but we managed to bring home a couple of limits. The stories of poor service and treating the muskies like pets at Nielsen's are true. I believe the owners just sold the business to one of their employees. Hopefully it means a change in the poor customer relations."
4395145,hacknslash,2015-12-22 21:57:00,1,"You are correct, Nielson's now have new owners and I am sure you will like the new change and attitude. I know them well. Same web site, you will see them under contacts and ""your hosts"". Enjoy your fishing!"
1517867,Chops,2012-12-30 08:27:00,56,"Does anyone know if Rowan Lake Lodge is still in business? Tried looking for their website with no luck. Did find Hook n Horn which is one I was not aware of. We stay at Nielsens, but was just surfing and was suprised not to see Rowan Lake Lodges website come up.On another note, anyone headed up for trout opener?"
1517902,DD73,2012-12-30 10:20:00,131,"They were still open last season, I know folks who were there in spring and summer. Not sure how much longer Bob and Linda will be open, last time I was there things were a little rough. Best location on the lake of the 3 lodges in my opinion, also the cheapest, but the boats at H&H and Nielsen's are much better. Feel free to PM me if you want more."
1518143,wallydave,2012-12-31 07:31:00,2151,"On Nielsens anyway! Our group tried them once...never again! The staff was rude, no customer service at all! We had a large group 12 guys of all ages the staff seemed to go out of their way to make us feel unwanted! If we were on one the guides spots, we could hear their comments and see them talking about us the their clients! We still get some mailings from them, I'm glad we have recycling! Ontario has plenty of lake's and outfitters that know how to provide great fishing and customer service!"
1518213,DD73,2012-12-31 10:58:00,131,"Yeah our group ended up at RLL because of a similar experience at Nielsen's. Honestly we've had more than a few bumps at RLL as well, just wonder if good customer service isn't the norm for some of the more remote places."
1518233,wallydave,2012-12-31 11:19:00,2151,"Most of the folks at Nielsens were ""veteran guests"" we had all kinds of ages in our group. From a marketing point of view, it just doesn't make much sense offending what could be the future clients!One and done is not a good business model!"
1518242,Chops,2012-12-31 11:37:00,56,"We stay at the outpost cabin for winter lake trout, so I can't speak to the staff or guides hospitality. I did find alisting for Rowan Lake Lodge on a no-realty fee site. Not real sure how up to date is though."
1518584,zeebee,2013-01-01 14:27:00,1144,Went to their website....any place that charges $4 per diem for swivel seats doesnt get my business....are they for real!!! My butt comfort is assumed. Think I would bend over and tell 'em to run the credit card thru the crack...stripe towards them.
1518615,wallydave,2013-01-01 16:00:00,2151,"ZB what can I say!! It was our first flying. We didn't know about WC!! I just went along with the group. Now. I know better, that's one of the great things About WC plenty of good info, plus folks Id like to fish with!"
1518628,zeebee,2013-01-01 16:20:00,1144,happy new year guy!...glad u came back to canada...soo many people are discovering this great country.I m very lucky to be born here but my parants were immigrants and I recocnize that. Cheers.
1518999,lakerbreaker,2013-01-02 16:38:00,253,3 more days and we will be ripping across Rowan chasing trout....can't wait...
