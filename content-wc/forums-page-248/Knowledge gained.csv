4402105,fishron,2015-12-26 06:47:00,317,"At the end of each fishing season I look back on what I have learned that will help me in the coming season. On our recent trips to our favorite Southern Ontario walleye lake we fell into the same techniques that worked but failed to try new ones. This lake has large amounts of water in the 18 to 30 ft range where you can drift fish without picking up weeds or debris. We catch a lot of walleye in those areas. What I learned last season and was confirmed with the previous season was that the big girls were in the weeds in 12 to 16 ft of water. Much harder to fish but better for a shot at a trophy. For sure, in the future on that lake I will be putting in some time in the weedy areas that I avoided in the past."
4402633,itsme,2015-12-26 13:08:00,31,Itsme says there are no weeds in 16 ft of water where he fishes????? Maybe you are in very clear water.... Help me understand what going on in your lake???
4402657,fishron,2015-12-26 13:27:00,317,"The lake I'm speaking off is at the top of the Rideau lake chain. It's spring fed for the most part, and has always been very clear. Several years ago it was invaded by Zebra mussels. It's now gin clear. This has allowed the many aquatic weeds in this lake to grow at greater depths. Drifting on a calm day you can clearly see the bottom in 12 ft or greater of water. Needless to say, fishing is best done very early or very late in the day unless there's a strong wind or much overcast. The weedbeds are dense, but here and there are small open patches. I think because of the extreme clarity of the water the walleye are using the weeds more than in the past. There is a great forage base of panfish and lake minnows. In the deeper parts of the lake, whitefish. The lake can be a challenge to fish but my fishfinder tells me there are lots of walleye."
4403057,Baseline,2015-12-26 21:11:00,3207,Toss cranks that run deep enough to cross over the top of the weeds or throw around the surface weeds. The walleyes will come up and grab them.
4403257,kzoofisher,2015-12-27 06:52:00,5144,"Liking this thread a lot so far. I think clearer water is what will be coming to all of us and we will need new techniques to catch fish. I believe that clear water tends to concentrate fish more and schools scattered on flats just doesn't happen. Some things I have found on lakes with clarity to more than 10'. Often fish are in the weeds from 8'-20'. Getting them out consistently is where I could use suggestions. Cranks over the top work when the beds are fairly flat, also on the edges if they stop at a drop and weed resistant jigs can be ripped there, too. Trouble is, many weed beds around here start in 3' and run down the drop to peter out somewhere between 14' and 20' without a defined edge. I'll do a run in X' with my baits just above the weeds and that works but is pretty hit or miss. I'll pick up a fish or two at 10' and then nothing, move in or out a few feet and get nothing, move out another few feet and get one. Feels like luck, not a pattern. DI almost never shows fish even when I'm catching them, very possibly user error but also possible that the fish move away from the boat. Most of my walleye hookups come at least 50' away from the boat and in front or to the side. Very seldom behind. Bass and pike come behind or close to the boat but not walleye. ""Weedless"" plastics are effective but I think I need stouter rods and to fish jig heads of at least 3/8 to get down and get good hook sets. 3/4 and 1oz just feel too big but they're probably not. Looking for some confirmation on that before I spend a bunch of money. Experimenting with a bait caster might be a good idea. On bright, windy days I have had good luck floating a wacky rigged ring or finesse worm on a slip bobber over the tops of beds. Fishing ""inside out"" on structure. When I can see bottom 15' down and the fish are 15' down, how far away does the boat have to be to not spook fish? Long, long casts are the norm. Trolling with planer boards works but small lakes have small structures and I'm spending very little time in the strike zone and lots of time circling around. My answer is to get shallow on top of the structure and fish out to deeper water. I use the slope of the structure to hide the boat so I can shorten up casts to 40' or less and still have productive fishing through more than half of the cast. What works for you guys in clear water?"
4403369,octanehi5,2015-12-27 07:39:00,1104,"Gaining knowledge,on any lake is always a plus,fishing a gin clear lake is nothing like fishing the usual tea stained lake of the Canadian shield,Also Remember the Rideau lake chain,has a fairly early ice out,compared to the lakes to the north. Spawning and weed growth start weeks earlier. Cloud cover and a good walleye chop, always out fish those bluebird days.Big baits produce big fish ,not as many .It depends on your choice of numbers over big fish. I have never found a lake with big populations of walleye,that are line shy,no matter gin clear or not."
4403873,fishron,2015-12-27 10:57:00,317,"The lake I'm referring to with gin clear water has never been productive using crankbaits. The exception being in the spring when rapala type baits trolled shallow after dark are effective. After the weeds are up, in late September, we fish jigs, tipped with a worm, exclusively. Heavier jigs to get down faster is a good idea. The lake has a good population of pumpkinseed sunfish and bluegills, sometimes in the 10 inch range that are in the weeds and outside the weeds, (what's going to swallow a 10 inch sunfish?). The statement, (sometimes just seems like luck) is fitting. Before you get to that weed roaming big walleye, you have to get past the competition. In many northern walleye lakes there are no sunfish, just little rascal perch. The reward of a larger walleye will make me fish these deep weeds more than I have in the past, but not exclusively."
4405409,kzoofisher,2015-12-28 04:16:00,5144,"A lot of shield lakes are pretty tannic and don't have the kind of clarity the OP is talking about. In his lake, and mine, we know the prime habitat is weeds because that's where the bigger fish are. Yes, there still are numbers elsewhere but the population seems to be shifting as clarity increases. That's my experience anyway. The question remains for me, what are the best methods for targeting 'eyes in the weeds especially when the depths will vary greatly? No matter what you do incidental catches are going to happen, I've caught big perch and rock bass on 3"" baits not to mention bass and pike. I don't have a problem with that, just want to focus on more walleye centric techniques if they are out there. For many of us who fish the walleye's southern range more than we do the northern shield this is going to become increasingly important. Our lakes that straddle the line between mesotrophic and eutrophic are becoming increasingly mesotrophic and sometimes bordering oligotrphic. When they shift the weed growth goes deeper and fish move into the weeds. Unfortunately, the lakes don't also grow rocks. My ""home"" lake has marl bottomed edges that are pretty barren out to about 5' where the weeds start; cabbage and milfoil to depths of 15'-20', rising as much as 8' from the bottom and then perch grass to the upper 20's where the bottom goes clean down to the maximum depth of about 65'. Most of the shore does a gradual slope until the main break at 10' where it quickly drops to the mid-20's. There are a few humps that rise to 6'-10' and all are weedy. Points the same. One main bay has extensive flats stair stepping a few feet at a time and dotted with large weed beds. Another is a low 20's basin covered with perch grass where you can actually see the schools of perch on the bottom in spring and fall. 15 years ago the ticket was to work the main break and pick off fish that were on the defined weed edge in 10' or so. That edge has moved way out and become much less defined. It's a new world that I am far from having dialed in."
4405577,octanehi5,2015-12-28 06:46:00,1104,"One thing to remember that walleyes are very light sensitive,on a bluebird sky day they are deep, on the nasty rainy windy days they are very shallow on wind blown shores. One of the best ways to locate is to troll around with bottom bouncers,once you get a hit make note of your depth and try jig fishing with live bait"
4405649,fishron,2015-12-28 07:14:00,317,"Fortunately, on my gin clear lake there is a sharp separation between open weedless water and heavy weedbeds. Scattered schools of walleye are located easily using a depthfinder. For probing the weeds, I like the use a roadrunner type jig and a fat piece of nightcrawler. The blade underneath the roadrunner helps it rise over obstacles and the worm hides the hook fairly well. I think wading through the panfish on the way to a walleye is inevitable. On those tea colored northern Canada lakes where the walleye fishing is wild and incredible, the only thing that gets in you way is the occasional pike and I don't consider that a problem."
