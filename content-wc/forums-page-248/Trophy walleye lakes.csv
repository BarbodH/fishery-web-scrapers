4402385,bthomas3333,2015-12-26 10:12:00,465,"It is a very complicated question, but kzoofisher is right on track. The only thing I would add especially when we talk about Northern Lakes with shorter growing seasons is the emphasis on bait fish. I think Cisco are absolutely key to growing big walleyes in the North. Does Cisco necessarily equal big walleyes...no bc other factors that kz mentioned comes into play, but if you want a shot at big fish you want a lake with Ciscos which also usually means deeper lakes.My two cents...Brett"
4402433,yoopertrout,2015-12-26 10:38:00,1172,"Thanks for the replies! The lake I last fished in Canada, and will again this summer is 1000 acres. A decent sized like by my standards down here, but small for Canada. We got lots of fish and some big ones. Biggest was 27.5"", so not a trophy by most standards, but fine with us. They averaged about 19 or 20"", but lots over that and quite a few over 25. I've read reports of some 28-30."" Not a lot of northerns, but some nice ones. The lake I fish in Michigan, on the other hand is totally catch and release, is about 900 acres, and it seems impossible to find a fish over 21"". Also lots of northerns. That lake has been C&R due to mercury pollution which I understand is almost cleared up. I understand that they plan to keep it C&R, which I'm glad off, because if they opened it to standard regs, I'm afraid it would get fished down to what so many other Midwestern lakes have become. On the other hand, I wonder if a slot would produce some bigger fish. Who knows, maybe there are big fish there, and my methods just aren't getting them. I can't complain though - it's a beautiful lake, and fun to fish."
4355849,JMKC,2015-12-03 15:51:00,238,Dogtooth and Hawk Lakes are very close to each other.
4356073,Wall-i-Lama,2015-12-03 18:00:00,1524,"Will, link is below for Dogtooth Lake Resort. I have fished there several times in the past. There is a provincial park nearby. Wayne has some reasonable rates for his cabins and is very helpful in getting you on the fish. It is not a lake where you should expect to get big numbers, but a 28"" plus trophy is a reasonable expectation. Spend time reviewing the lake map and pay CLOSE attention while navigating. There are many shallow reefs on this lake, some marked and some not. Good luck on your trip, wherever you go!http://dogtoothlakekenora.com/homepage.aspx"
4369313,SinOrSwim,2015-12-10 08:09:00,1528,"Here is one of those 29's from Hawk Last summer. This is my father in laws fish. We had a 29 and a 32 in the boat at the same time. Controlled chaos would be a good term. The pics of the other fish didn't turn out worth a hoot. The one under the water was the 32""."
4394257,bthomas3333,2015-12-22 16:22:00,465,"Fished Hawk Lake at the opener last year. Having heard the stories of big fish. I was optimistic but a bit guarded. Having fished some VERY remote lakes for 30+ years and never seeing anything above 26"" I didn't know what to expect. I probably caught 20,000 walleyes over 30+ years and I never saw a 30. At Hawk with my dad we had 3 large walleyes (29/29.5/30.5) fish in 2 days (when the snow didn't blow us off the lake:-)). We also caught another 8 that were in the 26-28 inch range. If you fish the right time of the year (EARLY IS KEY). If you focus on the bigger fish in the main lake. You have an excellent chance at a 30. Aside from the fishing the service / food / equipment is top notch. Going back in early June 16. Brett"
4395985,Babamel2,2015-12-23 08:19:00,414,"Be aware that it has been said that trophy walleye tend to come from lakes with more limited walleye populations, while lakes that have abundant walleye tent to have limited number of trophies. This is a generalization and exceptions exist."
4396233,bthomas3333,2015-12-23 09:33:00,465,I would agree with the above 100%. My experience has been 100 fish a day lakes are not the place for trophies. Inversely if you fish a trophy lake you can't complain when the action is a lot slower. The other issue with trophy fishing is skill level required to actually get the bite and land the fish goes up. If you are a very casual fisherman are you ok with not getting a bite for hours or losing the 'big' one when you make a mistake while fighting a fish.In my case after fishing number lakes for years I wanted something different. I was fine if I caught a handful of fish if there was a decent shot at a trophy. I know of other guys who would be very disappointed if they only caught a handful of walleyes for a trip. Know thy self.B-
4396265,Fisherman Ted,2015-12-23 09:41:00,461,A true statement that is indeed. Catching 150 17 inch fish (walleye specifically) can get a little boring for me anyway. I would rather catch 80 smallies in a day (night and day in terms of strength and fight) and then target a 30 in the evening as dusk sets in.
4401473,Babamel2,2015-12-25 17:25:00,414,"about 5 years ago, I was fishing Dinorwic in August, I and another person each got a 30 Inch 14 lb. Walleye on the same week."
4401713,yoopertrout,2015-12-25 21:04:00,1172,"Question: I'm probably one of the least hardcore walleye fishermen on this site. I go to Canada every other year or so and fish in the U.P. a few times a year. I'm more of a trout/smallmouth/muskie guy. I like walleye fishing, but I also like the other stuff, and I'm more equipped for it and know more spots. All of that said, here's the question: From the replies on this thread, it seems that the trophies come from the bigger lakes. Am I right about that? How firm of a rule is that? Do most of the trophies come from the giant lakes like Eric, Lac Seul, St. Joseph, LOTW etc. Thanks for listening to what might be kind of an obvious question to many of you. Even though walleyes aren't my main game, I like this site because it contains a lot of info on Canada (which I love) and interesting info generally."
4401873,kzoofisher,2015-12-26 04:05:00,5144,"Bigger water-bigger fish is a rule of thumb but that's all it is. More food, less competition, less fishing pressure per individual are some driving factors in growing big fish. Look at marginal trout streams; they don't get fished much because they can't support the numbers that attract people but the fish that do survive in them often grow large. A walleye lake with poor reproduction but good prey will grow a few big fish but very few for the frying pan. A lake like Gogebic with good repo and poor prey will grow lots of small fish. Sometimes the competition from other predators keeps the numbers of smaller walleye in check. Some lakes have good everything and don't we all love them. Designing a trophy lake is impossible. That's why the ones that exist should be carefully protected. Some have the potential but are out of balance because too many pike or muskie have been kept, perch are overfished/underfished, cisco have died out from oxygen depletion, every fish that reaches 15"" gets kept, any number of factors and we should try to balance those lakes. Some lakes are just good numbers lakes and we should jealousy protect those, too. Variety is the spice of life."
4349921,ftfarms,2015-11-30 19:08:00,444,"Hawk lake is nice just a little pricey for most. When you say camp there do you mean in a tent or camper or you looking for a cabin? We've done really good on 26""+ walleyes early in the season on English river north of kenora. Stayed in a tent at separation rapids. Its off the beaten path. The biggest was 31"" but a few over that 28"" mark."

4350449,ftfarms,2015-12-01 07:24:00,444,"We've stayed there first week in june and mid July mid August and mid September Caught the most bigger ones first week in june and mid September. First week in june we fish the river and fish the current breaks. Big wieght with a big minnow or big leech. Most of the time just letting it sit. You want numbers of walleyes fish the current with a jig and minnow. We've caught several 17-24"" fish in the current. The bigger fish seem to be close but not right in the faster moving water."
4350961,rzep,2015-12-01 11:30:00,1196,Wow....$400 per night per person...would need to catch 45 inch walleye to justify it..

4353337,Old Timer,2015-12-02 16:34:00,255,Dogtooth Lake. Drive-in camp with nice housekeeping accommodations. The lake takes some know-how and patience. But a 30 incher is a very real possibility. Fish in the 26-28 inch range are not unusual.
4353801,Walleye will,2015-12-02 18:53:00,218,Is there a lodge one the lake that you would recommend?
4353953,adempsey,2015-12-02 20:02:00,963,O'Sullivans Rainbow might be worth a look if you go early season. Pretty much booked up already except for the camp sites.

4349169,adempsey,2015-11-30 12:58:00,963,"I am curious. What would you require to designate a lake as a trophy Walleye lake?Targeting trophy fish is also a lot about when as well as where. So, it's important to include that information."

4349625,Ver88,2015-11-30 16:55:00,114,Dogtooth lake near Kenora produces lots of big walleyes. I have fished it for for two days and caught an over 28 each day plus several 22 to 26. It can be difficult to fish and is not really off the beaten path.
4349681,Mike Borger,2015-11-30 17:22:00,1554,Within Ontario the best remote trophy walleye fishery I have experienced is on the Attawapiskat River. Specifically the two camps that Hearst Air operates lower down in the system. I'm talking numbers of fish in the 28-30 inch class. Amazing thing about it is we didn't even target walleyes while we were there. All the huge walleyes we caught were incidental catches while casting oversized spinnerbaits and spoons for pike. The bonus of course is the pike fishing is pretty great too.
4349697,Mike Borger,2015-11-30 17:25:00,1554,"Sorry, just realized you were looking for a drive-to location. Ignore my previous post."
