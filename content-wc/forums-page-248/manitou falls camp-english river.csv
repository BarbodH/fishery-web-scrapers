The cabins are getting run down and the fish cleaning house is pretty bad. I can see where a new comer could be turned off by the conditions of the camp. If the fishing wasn't so great we would probably look for another location to fish with better accommodations. We caught a lot of fish, ate more than we should (+5lbs) and slept good every night so until the conditions deteriorate beyond what we can tolerate we will continue booking our trip to Manitou Falls."
2100658,Paul D,2013-09-13 06:55:00,8,"My son and I just got back from Manitou Falls Camp and it was our first trip there. I have to agree with the comments Jigfisher9 made about when you first drive in. We stayed in cabin 9 and it was not bad at all, it was not the fancies cabin, but it was fine. From my understanding from talking with Kay there are plans for remodeling all the cabins. You look at cabin 10 and it is a turnoff from the exterior looks. But when you go inside it was really nice. I have seen a lot worse in my life.I think one has to take into consideration it is a fish camp. We will definetly be going back and the fishing while we were there was great."

We usually go the week after Memorial Day and also in the Fall over Labor Day. This year we happen to be going the week of Memorial Day, just 1 week away!Water level does fluctuate alot but it has never really caused much problem. A few years ago the water level was way down and we couldn't get into Unexpected, but that didn't put too much damper on our totals. Tackle is simple, jigs or lindy rigs tipped with minnow or leeches. Wind-blown points are always a good location. Beautiful country and great fishing! Good luck!"
1107280,Simmy32,2009-05-22 14:17:00,6,30 + years at the same spot is a very encouraging thing. You are probably in transit right now. Best of luck! Let me know how it went when you get back!
1111937,Guest,2009-06-08 10:50:00,0,"Just got back from Manitou Falls Camp on the English River. The river is up 3-4 feet which made things interesting but didn't seem to impact the fishing. We caught a bunch of walleyes and northerns. We had 6 guys in our party and we kept track of size. We caught 63 walleyes over 22 inches and 27 of those were over 25 inches. The biggest of the trip was 28 inches. Biggest northern of trip was 40, caught by yours truly, on a jig and minnow and 6lb Fireline. It was a pretty exciting fight! We fished leeches, crawlers and minnows. Minnows won hands down. We had a 30 minute wait at the boarder on the Sat morning going up and less than 10 minutes on the Friday morning coming home."
1112123,lunker99,2009-06-08 20:27:00,236,"Dan, did you guys do much fishing up near the hydro dam while you were there?"
1112186,DanM57,2009-06-09 06:24:00,135,"We only fished by the dam the Saturday night we arrived. We caught several fish in the eddy caused by the rocks downstream from the dam on the right (as you look at the dam). Largest was 24"". We caught our fish in Unexpected, Wilcox, Long Legged River, Johnson and Clear"
1121726,jigfisher9,2009-07-17 10:06:00,23,"Hey Bender, You should be in for some great fishing. I've been going in mid to late August for the last 17 years to Manitou Falls and have always done well with walleye and pike. We have yet to have had a bad week of fishing there. We eat fish every night even though we always bring more food than we need, just in case. The water does go up and down frequently and sometimes rapidly which has made for some good times coming back up river thru Barnston Rapids. I think the change in water level makes fishing better sometimes as it gets the 'eyes' active. We have had some real good 2-3 day bites when the water comes up and it steadies as the water comes down. The times when we have struggled to catch our limit for the day is after a good thunderboomer or drastic drop in temps. With the chain of lakes off of the river there is always a current so you never have to wait for the wind to blow to concentrate the walleyes. We fish the river most of the time targeting many of the elbows where the river turns 90°'s or many of the submurged islands that are in the lakes. Please keep me up to date with any fishing reports as we are heading there on the 13th of August this year."
2046545,Guest,2013-08-21 14:11:00,0,the place is in total shambles and dirty.....the fishing was good but the bad accommodation took away from that
2048850,jiggster,2013-08-22 09:50:00,183,"My friend, his wife and two kids just came back from Manitou Falls. This was the first trip to Canada. She was happy with the lodge and wants to come back next year and bring her sister's family with. They were not disappointed. They had a great time."
2049874,JAY221,2013-08-22 14:44:00,877,"Jiggster, This is why in my opinion guests shouldn't be able to post. Here he/she revives a 4 year old post to complain about something with very lttle detail either. I wouldn't give it any consideration at all. I have in years past been to the camp & it was fine by us. Later, Jay"
2050970,jigfisher9,2013-08-22 20:38:00,23,"I'm heading to Manitou Falls tomorrow morning for a week of fishing. Our group has been going there since '94 and have not considered going elsewhere. Great fishing, beautiful lakes and low fishing pressure.. If you are looking for 4 star resort this is not your place, but if you are looking for 4 star fishing with a place to stay dry and lay your head on the pillow this place fits the bill."
573276,Guest,2008-04-30 07:17:00,0,"anyone frequent this camp? would like to hear feedback about fishing,and the camp itself.will be there first week of june.i can already feel the first hit,and taste the first cold blue. bender out.."
573329,Guest,2008-05-01 07:30:00,0,anyone??
573546,Guest,2008-05-06 10:38:00,0,"fished at naughty pines the year before it burned down.always good walleye and northern,real good for big smallies.never have caught a laker or a muskie.very pretty system,and you dont have to worry about getting blown off the lake.fish at the hydro dam if you want non stop action.jig and twister tail with a leader as you will catch all the 2 lb northern you can handle.a few bonus walleye there as well. good luck with your trip.cant tell you about the camp as i have never stayed there, but boated by it going to the dam.always had some activity going on,so it was probably busy."
1087999,Guest,2009-03-14 15:56:00,0,Wondering if anyone has any recent experience at this camp or on this section of the the English River. Heading here this May. Thanks.
1088561,Guest,2009-03-16 21:28:00,0,Great fishery! If you have heard stories believe them. I've been going there over 20 years but never in the spring. Have friends that went then so I have heard what it is like. You will have a great time.
1088774,JAYMAN221,2009-03-17 14:55:00,1,"I haven't been there since 2001 but have been on the water system about a half a dozen times both Naughty Pines & Manitou Falls & our only complaint was the water level. Being below the dam it might be wide open or closed up. We saw at last 10 foot difference year to year, but we always had a good time & caught fish. Manitou's outpost cabin is pefectly located so you can go anywhere with ease. They also had great setups with Honda motors that would run a couple of days without having to fillup with gas. Later, Jay"
1094636,Simmy32,2009-04-06 13:19:00,6,"Hi All  I will be at this camp with a cousin and some friends, June 6th - 13th. I was wondering (for those of you who have fished the English river system and / or stayed at this camp in the early spring), how does the water level affect the fishing? Any suggestions on lakes, lures or tactics depending on the water level? Also  would anyone know where I could get a hold of a map of the system before we go up there so I can plug some GPS coordinates in and not be trying to figure the chain out for 3 days before getting into the Walleyes? Any feedback would be appreciated!"
1094873,DanM57,2009-04-07 09:18:00,135,"Our group has been going to this camp for over 30 years. We always go the Sat after Memorial Day. While the water level fluctuates greatly, clarity has a bigger impact. We fish for walleyes exclusively; but typically catch a bunch of pike and smallies too. We have never had a bad year on this system. We aren't too creative on techniques  we jig and we rig. Minnows, leeches and crawlers. As for where  current and wind blown areas are generally the ticket. I have never been able to find a good map of the system."
1105015,Simmy32,2009-05-14 13:04:00,6,"Thanks Dan, I appreciate the feedback! Best of luck this year. I am literally counting down the days... can't wait!"
