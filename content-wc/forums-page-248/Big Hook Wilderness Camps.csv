4389529,MikeinMN,2015-12-19 23:08:00,190,"I fished West Lake twice with Big Hook quite some time ago (15+ years). The fishing was the best I have ever had. Big numbers of mid sized (16-20"") walleyes and very good numbers of bigger (33-42"") pike. The cabin, boats, and camp were very good even way back then. The owner was not so great (at least to us). Our best lure colors were orange, red, black, and gold. Specifically, Big Doctor spoons in orange and copper and #14 Rapala Husky Jerks in black and gold, or red crawfish which is a discontinued color but gives an idea anyway. I don't remember the exact month we went, but it was early summer and although we fished mostly 15' or less, by August you might need to fish a little deeper."
4389585,Mike Borger,2015-12-20 05:19:00,1554,Personally I've always wondered about Favourable Lake. It's a larger system which I like but I've heard pros and cons about it. Would love to hear some new feedback on this one!

4390129,new hips,2015-12-20 11:49:00,498,"Fished Big Hook several times but not in the last 8-10 years. Quality lakes and plenty of fish. South or Southwest I don't remember for sure. The one we went into had a big bay right in front of camp, thirty foot of water....sort of like a big bowl......there was a small reef maybe 200 yards from the pier that you could get breakfast in 10 minutes or less."
4391001,phishfearme,2015-12-21 08:16:00,1242,"not new feedback but I'll provide some lake characteristic info that doesn't change - Favouable is much more of a widening in the severn river than a lake per se. it also reminds me of many james bay lowland lakes (kesagami, evans) which are flat, featureless and shallow - which means that winds - especially from the WSW whip up the lake bottom and visibility goes to nothing. we portaged over from south trout (Way North) twice and had wind and nothing but muddy water each day. the severn river inlet (and Borland River inlet) stays pretty clear but of course that's where most everyone heads to. the Big Hook outpost on Favourable (it's really on Lemonade) wasn't there when we were there but it should access a part of the lake (that we didn't go to) that should be better protected from wind. and Lemonade was a hoot for constant small walleye and pike action. it's such a small lake that I wonder though if the outpost on it will impact the fishing. even though Favouable was ""whipped up muddy"", we did stumble over a few larger pike which it is noted for. just had to troll around with flashy spoons. walleye were nothing special either for size or numbers - I don't think walleye like or do very well in predominantly mud bottom lakes. hope this helps, phish"
