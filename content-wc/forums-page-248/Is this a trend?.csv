4369601,Fisherman Ted,2015-12-10 09:51:00,461,Go to the web-site and look. They essentially cover everything except maybe the used days of your fishing trip. If you fish for 3 of the 7 days i am not sure they would pay for those 3 days.
4378545,ILScott,2015-12-14 18:16:00,139,Just got an email from WLC and they cleared up the payment option. Customers have the option to pay early to save money on the trip or they can still pay at the end of the trip. If you pay early you will save up to $85. We have 7 in our group and that would be almost $600 in savings and put that towards minnows that would be 120 dozen seems good to me. Scott
4380361,HeHooksHimself,2015-12-15 13:51:00,725,"Scott, I got the same clarification. I think the $85 savings is use of credit card and/or not having to wait for your GST (or is it HST?) refund. In any case my group has agreed to go ahead and pay in March. My original post was just to find out if others were doing this. Fish On! Hooks"
4367521,HeHooksHimself,2015-12-09 11:29:00,725,"Yes, CampChick, WLC has not allowed checks for payment, other than deposits, for many years."
4367529,Shellback,2015-12-09 11:30:00,8083,"1.00 CAD = 0.736584 USD Canadian Dollar ↔ US Dollar 1 CAD = 0.736584 USD 1 USD = 1.35762 CAD Here's where I'm confused. A US dollar brings $1.35 CN, so I'm thinking you made 35% on your money. But then again, the $0.35 CN you made, isn't worth the same amount as $0.35 US. Is that how it ends up being a smaller percentage?"
4367553,Thompmd,2015-12-09 11:38:00,320,"I have some Rental Properties so I can appreciate being stiffed, sometimes despite your best efforts as the Owner. Wish I could tell you how many times in 25yrs a tenant has taken their last months rent and used it to pay a new landlord. I also believe that far too many think that a small businesses have money running out their ears and would not believe how slim the margins are at times(in lots of cases years/years depending on your business model). I don't believe their are any foolproof ways to protect yourself. Paying in full is certainly better than just a deposit but how many guests would never book at a camp that wants PIF."
4368825,Guest,2015-12-09 21:51:00,0,"Hmmmmm! I guess paying up front depends on Your situation. Where else do we all pay up front: Airlines, Cruise Ships, Air BnB rentals, online tickets and other things. I went fishing in northern Canada where the trip was paid in full in March, although our trip was in July. This lodge is only open for 2 1/2 months a year. A limited time to make their money. So I can understand their policy. As I said, depends on the situation. I have no problem paying in advance."
4368833,roscoe33,2015-12-09 21:54:00,653,"Like I said, Show me where. I don't know any agent that would mess with it."
4368857,Fisherman Ted,2015-12-09 22:18:00,461,These companies do this for any trip anywhere in the world. I have been doing it for years.http://www.travelexinsurance.com/
4369097,SinOrSwim,2015-12-10 07:00:00,1528,"LOL That isn't true. Just because a person goes on an expensive trip doesn't automatically mean they can afford to lose the whole thing? Interesting perspective????? And, trip insurance isn't that expensive. But, you have to determine risk vs benefit for each individual."
4369249,Shellback,2015-12-10 07:53:00,8083,"Fisherman Ted brought an interesting topic. What does travel insurance typically cover? For me to travel to NW Ontario, it could mean between 2 to 4 hotel stays for the travel, plus $500 to $600 in gas. So it cost $1000 just to get to the camp and back. If you arrived and had a medical issue that would not allow you to complete your stay, would insurance cover the camp fees you lose and also costs traveling to and from? When applying for insurance, do you itemize costs and buy a policy based on your costs for the trip?"
4369505,Fisherman Ted,2015-12-10 09:29:00,461,"First off you give them total cost of trip which includes not just the lodge price, but all the travel and hotel to and from. Whatever you are spending from the time you leave your door. Insurance would cover the remainder of the stay plus all the costs associated with having to leave early in this situation. If you can't make it at all they would cover all sunk costs like flights, some hotels, any lodge fees not reimbursable etc."
4369561,Shellback,2015-12-10 09:44:00,8083,"So if you have an accident or fall ill on the first day, insurance would just cover your remaining lodge costs? I'm thinking the whole trip is a bust, and would like to recover all the costs associated with gas, hotels etc."
4365521,Baseline,2015-12-08 10:19:00,3207,"Payment terms are up to the resort owner. Meeting those terms is up to me. Most of the resorts I have dealt with require a deposit and then payment upon arrival. Resorts I've used several times usually wait until departure for payment once we get to know each other. I'm not all that comfortable with pre-payment, but have done so for more exotic trips. I've hired guides in Alaska for a week of fishing and all of them require full payment 30 days in advance. These guides have been in business a long time and have great reputations. There is also some customer competition for their services. I guess prepayment is a matter on how confident you are of the resort you are dealing with."
4365729,HeHooksHimself,2015-12-08 12:21:00,725,"Thank you for the continued posts on this subject. Again, I have fished at WLC many years and we have a good relationship with the owners. The jim wolf and chicago boys story has been an enigma to me since it happened. He communicated specifically about Wine Lake and wanted guaranteed 50-100 fish/boat days. I told him that days like that were not uncommon, but hey, it is fishing. Sometimes they just don't bite. There are so many fish and so many places to fish in this system that Herb is reluctant to mark spots, but he has a general map with general areas marked. For me, the hunt is part of the fun and even the most inexperienced angler knows that walleye have different patterns at different times of the year. In my opinion, you should catch plenty of fish by accident in this system. I had told jim about the portage and showed him pictures, cautioning him that it might be difficult for a group of their ages. Usually Herb takes a group in at a set time but these guys wanted to go in on their schedule. After showing him the pictures, he thought they could do the portage by themselves. I would call the camp ""rustic/luxury"" The cabins are in very good shape and well taken care of. All of the Coleman lamps have since been replaced with solar lights, a transition that takes away some of the ""call of the wild"" elements we have loved about this camp, but that is progress! I would take jim's comments with a grain of salt and recommend this camp for a unique experience. I think his expectations far exceed his budget. However, we will see what the ""pay up front"" transition brings!"

4366449,roscoe33,2015-12-08 19:27:00,653,"The problem with total prepay, is that it will deter new guests from coming to the resort. Too many times the brochure and web site photos don't match the real world. The cabins have holes in the floor, or there is no heat, or the boats are not as advertised. When our group of six pays $4500, we expect there to be a working source of heat. The only way I would ever prepay is if I had visited the resort to inspect it, or on a recommendation from someone I know. And then, only by credit card. Now, personal story. Resort on Sturgeon Lake north of Ignace went into foreclosure 2 weeks before my family arrived there. Gate was chained. Deposits were lost. $1800. And no where to stay. Nearby resorts had posted brochures and directions on the gate, but they were all full up."

4366953,Thompmd,2015-12-09 07:45:00,320,"Personally I wouldn't pay in full up front but I am all for having to pay a deposit(regardless if it is non-refundable/refundable or transferrable). I have never had anything come up that required me to alter a reservation and I'm 51 and we take fishing trips to beach vacations every year. That is the reason I quit trying to schedule a group each year because some simply weren't reliable. My 2-cents is that once I make a commitment and take a week/weeks time then I am obligated to pay for it. If am unforeseen emergency came up 10days or 10months, you immediately tell the place you're staying and work something out but it's the resorts option what the right thing to do is. I also remember a thread where some resort owners move quests, unannounced, to a different cabin. That too should only be done at the guests approval. Can resorts get a group policy they could add as an option for guests? I wouldn't purchase such a policy myself(I'm a cheapskate lol). Some Owners might say ""it's only $45"" but it's always different when it's your/my $45. It's only $45."
4367313,campchick,2015-12-09 09:54:00,96,"This from a camp owner's perspective: There may be other factors for prepaying the trip in full. Bounced checks come to mind. Once a guest leaves your resort (and the country), just try getting your money. All camp owners have at least one person/party that has stiffed them for a trip."
4367401,GarryB,2015-12-09 10:17:00,365,"Shellback,Based on your example, a person paying in U.S. dollars would save $357.62.$357.62. divided by $1356.62 = a 26 percent savings."
4364545,port1042,2015-12-07 19:20:00,509,"The lodge we go to increased the deposit from $100 to $250 per person a couple of years ago. I think this had to do with ""late ice out"" conditions and the number of people who simply walked away from their reservations. I didn't have a problem with that and it made sense. However, if they had moved to a full payment in advance I think I would have thought twice about it. We pay our deposit in advance, obviously, and pay the balance the night before departure. I like it that way. The only way I'm going to walk away from a deposit is if I'm dead or nearly dead. Other then that the lodge can count on me, twice a year, and I'm treated that way."
4364569,MN_Moose,2015-12-07 19:32:00,964,If I was asked to pay up front for a trip 60 - 90 days I would ask what the discounted rate will be.
4364625,billy weaver,2015-12-07 20:03:00,470,I checked Wine Lake Camp's web-site to see what else may change this year and noticed minnows are $5 dollars per dozen and for our group of six that's a lot. The price won't slow our purchases down but it sure is not going to be cheaper in 2016 as some seem to think.
4364689,HeHooksHimself,2015-12-07 20:39:00,725,"We have been going to WLC for 20 years. The group varies, but Doc and/or I are there every year. Ann and Herb run a great camp and have put a lot of money into keeping the camp and equipment in top knotch shape. Ten years ago or so, I thought they were nickle/dimeing us (i.e. extra for a boat seat and stuff like that) but now they have just raised their prices high enough to include all of that in the package. We have taken the price increases in stride since Herb has to get everything over the portage. It is worth it to us because the fishing is great and we know the system so well. I know they have had the business for sale for quite a while but I am not sure they really want to sell it and the camp is always full. They have taken credit cards for the last few years but add 5% for the transaction. They will be dropping the additional 5%, so there is a benefit for those that use credit cards (that would not be me). I don't know them well enough to know if they are struggling, but they have a kid in college and that can change your world. We do have to pay a deposit before Dec. 31 of $300 each and then balance due in March. The only thing new is the balance due in March as opposed to when you arrive. This would have really had an impact on us last year as Doc couldn't come since his wife had a medical issue. He did lose his deposit and we ended up going with only three. His decision was made about a month before departure. We have not really had any other issue when paying up, but I suppose there is always someone throughout the year that didnt expect the add-ons (minnows for instance) to add up so quickly and they have to hassle with that. We have all agreed to comply this year and I will let you know if any problems arise from this new approach to payment. Hooks"

I would not pay in full for a Canadian fishing trip a few months in advance. There are just too many variables. That's the entire purpose of a non-refundable deposit. Oddly enough though, if you rent a house at the beach or rent anything through sites like VRBO, you have to pay in full a few weeks prior to arrival. It seems like the general rule is: Pay in advance for self-service rentals like beach houses etc .... pay at departure for staffed places like resorts, hotels, campgrounds and lodges."

I read another post by yourself a couple of years ago regarding your trip to Black Bear Lodge on Red Lake. You posted negative feedback about that lodge as well. I went to BBL shortly after your trip and found my experience to be vastly different than what you posted. We had great meals, the owners were very accommodating, the equipment ran as needed ,campfires every night and I met folks that I hope to fish with for years to come. Couldn't have asked for anything more to make the trip any more enjoyable than it was. I guess my expectations for a fishing trip are set much lower than your group.

4363873,Fisherman Ted,2015-12-07 14:59:00,461,"Travel insurance is for just that. Travel. No matter where you go it can be a life saver. You get sick. Kid breaks his ankle. Mom slips and falls. Missed flights. Back flares up. You hit a deer driving to the lodge. I have seen it all. You can cancel at any time and they cut you a check then and there. Sure, a $600 trip to Lake of the Woods many people can stomach losing if they get sick or something happens. But a $14,000 salmon trip to Quebec is another story. A few years ago one of my guests got a call on day 2 of a 7 day trip with news their elder mother had fallen and broken a hip. They made a mad dash home AND hit a deer in their car. Trip insurance covered the remainder of the trip and all damage to the car plus all airlines change fees etc.Those expensive 'trips' will almost always require significant if not all the money up front. DO you want to gamble with that cash or protect it. We just booked a family trip to China for spring break. 1st thing we did was insure the trip. No brainer. It is a simple risk tolerance. How much do you want to gamble....."

While this does not eliminate anyone in our group of six, I was just wondering if any other camps are moving in this direction. I am old school and like the idea of paying for services after they are rendered, but we have never had a bad experience at WLC.

4363049,Obabikon,2015-12-07 09:46:00,2370,"Each owner has to determine what is best for their business. As a business owner, I like to receive payment at the end of the trip, shake hands, and thank the guest for their business. We do require a deposit, but the majority is due at the end of the trip.

This can obviously lead to problems.I probably wouldn't be too concerned if it's a place you know, but I don't think it's a good business practice at all. A deposit is fine, but not full payment. Although, I have often paid upon arrival and not after my trip was completed. I suppose this protects the owners from unscrupulous people who hold back due to something they were unhappy about. So, I think it's reasonable to pay in full once you arrive."

And not just fishing trips but safaris, cruises, you name it.If you are going to fish the Kenai for $1,200 a day your deposit will be substantial and there is a good chance you will need to pre-pay your trip as you get closer to departure.One reason for this is that there is huge risk at that price if a customer bails. Not only can they likely not re-book the trip but a resort could be out mid 5-figures. The more expensive you get the more a lodge (generally) will require up front.Once my season starts I require 100% payment up front and not a token deposit amount. I have no room to maneuver should there be a no-show. That cabin rental will never be recovered.-FT"

As was said - too many bad things out of the control of the client could happen. Now, a reasonable ""deadline"" for getting a refund of any deposit is also a good idea for the resort, to allow them the opportunity to re-book the dates that had been reserved."
4363409,Fisherman Ted,2015-12-07 12:40:00,461,And that is the reason why travel insurance is so important. There are exponentially more 'bad reasons' why a customer can't come versus why a resort can't honor your reservation. A good policy will cover nearly all of those reasons. In full. At an expensive place they are all going to require payment up front. Just like an airline. Just like a cruise. Just like a package vacation touring vineyards in Italy. For pennies on the dollar you can protect that trip and put that risk on someone else. -FT
