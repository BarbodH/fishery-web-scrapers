4397321,Bstar,2015-12-23 15:23:00,564,We went to one Amik's Cobham Lake outpost in Aug. 2011. Great numbers and size of walleyes. We went to a spot that John recommended the first morning and my wife and I must have had at least 25 doubles that morning! Lots of water to fish on the Cobham river system but fairly well protected from wind. It's known for big pike but we didn't get into any when we were there. Water was down 2-3 ft. that year. Cabin was great. Boats and motors were adequate. John flew us in a day early at no extra charge because the group ahead of us wanted to fly out on Friday. John and his wife run a nice operation. You should have a great time.
