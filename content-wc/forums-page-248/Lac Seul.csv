4396689,Perch56,2015-12-23 11:05:00,17,Yes.....SWW is more expensive than other places and its not for everyone who might want or need a cheaper vacation. But if you want to not do it all yourself I highly recommend. The fishing is top notch that price is fully guided. You leave the dock at 8 and fish until 5 with shore lunch. I took my son a few years back and we had a great time with no worries. My wife loves it because she has to do nothing other than drink coffee and at my age I cant do all the work of self guiding.
4398649,orchard frank,2015-12-24 07:29:00,1900,"Fished Ontario for close to 40 yrs. Lots of great spots, after going to Lost Island Lodge, never went anywhere else. 14 yrs. of twice a year mostly, often 2 weeks. Can fish within sight of the lodge, or travel safely (and protected water) as far as you want. Plenty of spots to troll, jig, drift, bobbers, cast, can't scratch it in a lifetime. Cabins, docks, boats, and especially staff has always been top of the game. Been a while since I've been there, travel plans changing due to family in Florida, and our move to Florida as well, but I'm 100% confident that LIL will be a great choice for you. I know they run 80-90% repeat business, tells it all. Good Luck"

4392369,jb_wi,2015-12-21 20:45:00,212,"I'm looking to book a trip to Lac Seul in June or July. I'm mainly after bigger walleyes (who isn't right). I like to jig, but also am rigged to troll as well, and would actually like to focus on trolling primarily and jigging secondary. For those that have been, do the waves get out of hand out there on the main lake? I will have my 14y/o son along and don't want to take him to an area where we will get beat up with a 10mph wind. (We'll be fishing out of a 17' Mr Pike) Also, would like to stay in a lodge on the southern portion of the lake if possible, but I've never been there so open to any part of the lake that would be near good walleye fishing for late June or early July. Any advice appreciated. -Justin"
4393065,tv4fish,2015-12-22 08:51:00,2694,"Justin: (114 views w/no replies, so I'll jump in here ) My group has fished the ""east"" end of Lac Seul since 1985, and yes, we catch some big walleyes. There is a lot of parts to the ""main"" lake, and yes, with the wind out of the right direction - you can get some good sized waves almost anywhere. I'm not promoting any lodge here, but this is a pretty good map.http://www.lacseuloutposts.com/mapoflacseul.htm"
4393137,bigwalleye1,2015-12-22 09:12:00,2632,"I'm with TV. There is always a potential for the ""wrong"" wind, but that's also the beauty of Lac Seul. There's almost always other spots close by. I've been there in June, July, and Sept, and never had a bad trip. Seems like big fish are always possible anywhere in the system. There are also a LOT of lodging options, from boat in camps, to drive to camps, to camps away from the lake that allow you to trailer to different landings every day. All are viable alternatives. Good luck with a search for the perfect spot!! You won't regret a trip to LS. If you've fished any big water at all elsewhere, you'll be fine."
4393601,Carnhzkr,2015-12-22 12:27:00,964,"If you want to stay on the south side of the lake, there are few options. On the SW side, there's Silver Water Wheel and Williams Lake Lodge. SWWL is supposed to be one of the finest on the lake, but it is American plan only and all packages include guides using their (really nice) boats. Williams Lake has access to the southern portion of LS through a channel. There are quite a few options around the Hudson area on the east end of the lake, however the majority of lodges are congregated in the NW section around the Ear Falls area. I've only fished the NW section. In late June/early July, I doubt you will be fishing in what I'd call the main body of the lake. It depends on ice out and temps, but I doubt the walleye will have made their transition to the many mid-lake humps, reefs, and drop-offs by then. Typically, those areas get going in mid-July and really turn on in August. Chances are, you will be fishing bays, points, islands, and weed beds and not venturing out into the large open expanse of water. Then again, if you want to fish the famous Sand Banks in McKenzie Bay, you will need to traverse a lot of open water to get there, and given the right wind, it's no picnic. If you're serious about booking a trip to LS, it'd be a good idea to start looking now. I'm sure you can still find some openings, but most of the lodges do fill up. I have personal experience at Goose Bay, Lac Seul Lodge, and Fisherman's Cove, all of which I would highly recommend. Those are all on the NW section."
4393889,ftfarms,2015-12-22 14:39:00,444,If your wanting to stay on the south (east) end I would look into lost island lodge. It's on lost lake but it's all part of lac suel. You can boat right into lac suel from lost lake. Walleye fishing and smallmouth fishing can be as good as any. if you want look up old shows of babe winkelman on lost island lodge it's full of information It would be a great trip for you and your son.
4393993,Perch56,2015-12-22 15:18:00,17,I highly recommend SWW. My wife and I have been there on about 10 different trips and have never been disappointed with the service or the fishing or the price. There are plenty of places to get out of the wind and still into very good fishing. The only downside is that they are smaller and very tough to set into as a new customer. It's worth the wait and they do maintain a waiting list.
4394081,ftfarms,2015-12-22 15:36:00,444,5 days fishing is over $3200 per person. WHAT? And you need to add the tax?
4394825,bigwalleye1,2015-12-22 19:40:00,2632,"Hey, he said it was a nice place...."
4394857,jb_wi,2015-12-22 19:50:00,212,Thanks for all of the replies so far. Looks like there's definitely plenty of options. I have some emails out to some lodges so I'll see what they have available.
4395865,bigwalleye1,2015-12-23 07:54:00,2632,"As an addendum, I re-read the original post, and noticed you want to focus primarily on trolling and secondarily on jigging. I believe the larger expanses of water in the central and western portions will serve your purposes better than the eastern portion. The east has a lot of rocks, drop offs and shoreline structure that I think would make trolling problematic due to the rapid and unpredictable depth changes. Much as I like the east, I'm primarily and secondarily a jig fisherman, and that technique seems to work better in the east for me than trolling, but JMO."
