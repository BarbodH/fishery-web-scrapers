4384025,Limeyangler,2015-12-17 07:18:00,563,"Hi all, When all the summer traffic on the lake stops, we keep going. Got down to Eagle Lake near Osbourne Bay for an afternoon session. Good 6"" of ice to greet us. We got a few, released a few and my pup got a workout too.VIDEOhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgfHqQvgC7Q"
4384089,v-bay gord,2015-12-17 07:45:00,3168,I recognize that spot! Good video.....your production values are getting better. In Vermilion Bay I've seen too much open water to trust the ice just yet......
4384249,Limeyangler,2015-12-17 08:53:00,563,"Yup, lots of open water everywhere, slow start to the season for sure, saved a ton on heating costs already!"

4385945,north560,2015-12-18 03:47:00,53,"Great to see someone is getting out. Every time we think there's enough ice it warms up and open water appears.Mind you great weather,no snow so you can drive to most lakes to fish.Caught a nice six pound walleye late November on one lake can't wait to try to fish it this winter.Last year all we caught on the lake was 3-4 pound Lakers."
4385961,pjshorthorn,2015-12-18 04:07:00,5654,"Nice video!!!!! If you get a chance to fish Eagle Lake again this winter, do me a favor and head over to the Vermilion Bay area of the lake and punch some holes. I could use a few more hotspots to fish next summer when we are at V-Bay Lodge harassing Gord. PjShorthorn."
4387617,Lmbkiller,2015-12-18 16:24:00,639,"Nice video.....a word of caution though, when there is little to no snow on ice like that many many dogs have torn their acl's. It is much easier than most imagine. And once one of the acl's goes, very often they will tear the other one down the road at some point. Just thought I'd give a heads up. Anyways, good fishing and keep them pooches safe"
