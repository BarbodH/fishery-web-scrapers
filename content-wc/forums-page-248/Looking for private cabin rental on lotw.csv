We've got an eye on a resort not far from our old one for next summer that is an option. We usually stay for 8 or 10 nights. This summer our work schedule has opened up so we are looking to stay for at least 2 weeks. We previously stayed in housekeeping camp with our boat so we require very little. I would like to find a private cabin to rent to save $$$. At least until we can find another camp we are comfortable with. With the wife and I and two boys, the cheaper the cabin, the longer we can stay. If anyone has any ideas or info, please contact me. Usually stay in Nestor Falls, but, open to change. Thanks, Slushfish"
