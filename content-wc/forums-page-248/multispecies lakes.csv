What made me think of this was on Christmas Day I went down to the lake I live on in Virginia. Water was 61 degrees at the creek inlet running into 55 degree lake. Fish were stacked up there and in 3 hours I caught 28 largemouth bass, 25 crappie and 20 bluegill on just one lure, a small tube jig made for panfish. Bass were to 20"" and crappie 10-12"", and bluegill were big too. Can this be done in Canada at certain times and on certain lakes? Would be fun to get a double- triple- double up there and maybe make things more interesting for other fisherman as well when you throw in and don't know what it might be."
4404841,BornToFish,2015-12-27 18:02:00,1224,"I have fished about fifty weeks in NW Ontario. Most of this fishing has been done on what I consider to be a multispecies lake. I would not say that the lake offers spectacular fishing with respect to any one particular species of fish. On the other hand, I wouldn't say that the lake is deficient with respect to anyone species of fish. It's just a solid multispecies lake. I learned long ago that this lake is always showing a solid bite with respect to at least one species of fish, at any given point in time. If walleyes aren't biting at any given point in time, some other species of fish is biting. It's up to me as an angler to figure out what is biting if the fish that I want to target isn't biting at that moment (e.g. cold fronts, algae bloom, mayfly hatch). I address this by going with the flow. I fish for what is biting. In order to do this, I have a broad arsenal of equipment in the boat with me, such that I can target several species of fish during an outing on the lake, with a broad array of techniques. I typically start the morning at daybreak fishing for walleyes. I might be casting for pike by mid-morning and then fishing for bass or perch after lunch. I might spend an afternoon into early evening fishing for muskies. I wind up the day with whatever bite was going best during the day. If nothing special was going, I find a good place to target walleyes at dusk. I learned a long time ago to go with the flow and fish for what is biting. I don't force square pegs into round holes anymore. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4405097,ftfarms,2015-12-27 19:31:00,444,I've fished a lot of lakes in Ontario and I would say lake of the woods for variety is hard to beat. We've caught walleye crappie pike musky Pearch smallmouth large mouth rock bass crawfish all the same week.
4405697,fishron,2015-12-28 07:30:00,317,"I really enjoy fishing smallmouth and largemouth in Canadian lakes near the border. Large panfish can be fun too and many of the lakes have good sized perch, crappie, rockbass and other sunfish. When I've fished further north in Quebec, the angler crowd wants walleye, pike and lake trout and bringing bass to their lake is punishable by death. Rockbass, crappie, and sunfish seem to disappear at a certain distance from the border. For variety they are replaced by whitefish and sauger and occasionally by jig hitting suckers. It's all good."
4406097,Bill Krejca,2015-12-28 10:22:00,6107,"I have to echo what ftf said. If you can hit it right, with the right water temperature sequence, spring time on LOW can be deadly, hitting crappies and bass in the shallow water spawning mode. Using small jigs of various types, most all species can be caught. One of the joys of LOW is the variety of species that can be taken, all in a relatively small portion of the lake. (It is up to you to find the particular small portion.)Bill"
4407705,Baseline,2015-12-29 05:18:00,3207,"Whitefish Bay of Lake of the Woods, Ontario has SMB, LMB, Northern Pike, Walleye, Muskie, Crappies and Lake Trout all in catchable numbers."
