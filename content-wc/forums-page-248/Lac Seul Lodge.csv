4370401,Fisher-man,2015-12-10 16:51:00,422,"Looks to be in about the middle of the lake. Anyone stayed there? I hate to drag my boat all the way from Colorado....it is 1453 miles....just too much of an asskicking. What were the accomodations like? And the equipment. They advertise 1750 Lund Outfitters, which looks like a great fishing boat. Anyone been there recently?"
4370537,Pooch,2015-12-10 19:31:00,4619,"Have been there the past two years. Good camp. Well run. Good cabins. Good people running camp. Good location on the lake. If the main lake gets too rough then you can fish several fairly sheltered bays next to camp. We are returning next year. We take my old Lund, but the camp boats are better. I thought that they may have all new 50 or 60 hp motors for 2016. Camp boats are great boats. Docks are top notch. Like other camps in the immediate area, they are usually booked solid a year in advance. Odds of getting a cabin for 2016 are probably not too promising. After making the trip to Canada over sixty times, I recognize a good camp when I see one. LSL makes the cut. Pooch"
4370665,Fisher-man,2015-12-10 21:35:00,422,"Pooch, thanks for that. We went to Mahkwa for many years, and then decided to try Lake of the Woods. I live in Colorado and LOW is 450 miles closer....still 1050 miles, but not as bad. But, we miss Lac Seul. The fishing was always great in September. We may try this place. Thanks again."
4370937,ftfarms,2015-12-11 06:21:00,444,If your going in September you shouldn't have any problems. July and August that area can be real busy. All four resorts in that area are nice and run top notch. We two switched to Lotws but we go in first part of August. Don't miss the extra drive at all. IMO I don't think you can go wrong with lac suel lodge. I wouldn't fish these big lakes without my boat. The gps and lake chip is just a major piece of mind.
4371297,Fisher-man,2015-12-11 08:50:00,422,"Yeah, I feel the same way. I have a 1950 Tyee and everything I need is in that boat. I love fishing out of it. But, I can pack some stuff and fly to Minneapolis a lot easier than I can drive! It is a tough choice."
4371417,skindzier,2015-12-11 09:21:00,137,"I drag a boat from Colorado. What I generally do is schedule a trip over July 4th & split time between Lac Seul & Lake of the Woods. We do the Lake of the Woods portion first so we get the advantage of the shorter drive & can get on the water earlier on arrival day. We usually do 4 day segments at each lake. We fish mostly muskies at LOW and mostly walleyes on LS. The other cool thing about having your own boat is you can dump it into other lakes you may pass along the way. We've fished Cedar several times either on the trip into LS, or as a day trip. We've seen more wildlife driving on 105 at the crack of dawn than in any other parts of our trips, so hauling a boat around isn't always a disadvantage, though there's certainly something to be said for walking down to the dock & taking off. We had to wait three or four minutes once for a couple of moose to clear out of the road to the Cedar ramp once. That was really cool - they really weren't particularly concerned with us."
4371761,Steve Ediger,2015-12-11 11:11:00,97,"I have been there 33 times. The last few years I have been going three time per year. I can tell you that the cabins are top notch, the boats are in fact lund 1750's, the motors are new or nearly new Yamaha 40 or 60 hp quiet four strokes. It is located in the middle of the popular fishing on that end of Lac Seul. The employees are very knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly. You are only 12 miles from Ear Falls if there is something you need or forgot. As you can probably tell, I love the place, as does my wife and son. Give Rod and Lorita a call, I'm sure you won't be sorry. Steve"
4371881,Fisher-man,2015-12-11 11:40:00,422,"Steve, thanks for that recommendation. We are still undecided....arguing between my two brothers and my son, on whether to do LOW again, or back to Lac Seul. I think we enjoy the arguing and planning this time of year because we can't be on the water. Thanks again, Matt"
4371889,Fisher-man,2015-12-11 11:41:00,422,"Skin, glad to see there is someone else as goofy as I am. I love fishing out of my boat, with my gear, and everything I need at hand. No way you can pack it all and fly to MSP. And every year I say we are going to do it twice, but after the first trip I end up fishing Chatfield! Thanks again."
4372097,skindzier,2015-12-11 13:47:00,137,Chatfield is pretty depressing after being in God's country.
