4390673,Guest,2015-12-20 19:48:00,0,Gateway North Outfitters Pipestone outpost is my favorite place in Canada. It is about a 23 mile boat ride in with one portage/boat lift along the way. Once at the outpost you will see few boats. There are a few cabins and other outposts on Pipestone and one lodge on the lower part of Pipestone. Pipestone is a clear water lake and on bluebird days the fishing can be tougher unless the wind is going or fishing early or late. Pipestone is not a 100 walleye a day lake but you have a shot at a 28-30 inch eye and plenty of eaters as well as a 10-12 pound laker or a 50 inch muskie. Our group usually fishes in the morning for walleyes for shore lunch. After lunch we go for the lakers and muskies. Lucas from GNO runs a very nice place. If you have any questions feel free to give him a call. I wish I was there now.

4390953,Bill Krejca,2015-12-21 07:55:00,6107,"Good fishing in O'S, the cabin on Dunn's Island is remote, some of the best fishing in the lake is nearby. Bill"
4390961,Bill Krejca,2015-12-21 07:57:00,6107,"Well run camp, remote, good fishing nearby! Bill"
4392337,packpro,2015-12-21 19:56:00,695,Had a great trip to Ghost River. Great Fishing. Great owners. Very good fishing. Lots of productive water. Daryl and Donnie were very helpful in putting our group on fish
4383777,Mike Borger,2015-12-17 02:07:00,1554,"Having fished the west end of St. Joe last August, I will concur with the choice of Winoga's outpost. Lake St. Joe is an unreal fishery.Beyond that the Dunn Island outpost on O'Sullivan Lake north of Nakina is a very good one too:http://www.osullivansrainbow.com/accom.html"
4387185,Walleyeski,2015-12-18 13:51:00,40,Hillbiehle- sent you a p/m.
4387633,Mr Walleye,2015-12-18 16:28:00,29,Anyone been to Goose Bay Camp's boat-in outpost on Nungesser Lake? How are the accomodations and the quality of walleye fishing? Is it very remote?
4387881,yoopertrout,2015-12-18 19:07:00,1172,"I ran across this website. I haven't been there, but the place looks pretty interesting - old HBC trading post.http://www.oldpost.com/experience/directions.php"
4387913,wallydave,2015-12-18 19:20:00,2151,"My boat/cabin buddy went to Nungesser Lake out of Goose Bay back in the 90s. More remote and rustic back then. The pictures on Goose Bay website look much more modern. The fishing was pretty good back then, might be more camps now. Give Andrea a call or email for more info."
4388041,Mr Walleye,2015-12-18 21:11:00,29,Thanks Dave! Anyone been thir recently?
4388233,wallydave,2015-12-19 05:30:00,2151,"Give the search function a try, there has been a few reports posted. Good luck!"
4388825,packpro,2015-12-19 12:11:00,695,"Did not stay at Goose Bay, but we fished Nungesser out of Anglers Kingdom. It was our first trip to this lake, and our camp owner did a great job putting us on fish. Our camp was a boat in, not sure about Goose Bay, it may be as well. I would say the fishing was way above average. No issues with eaters, and enough 25+"" fish to keep it interesting. Caught fish in a number of spots all over the lake. It is also a trophy pike lake. Saw the owner land a 48"" NP right next to us."
4389617,dave macpherson,2015-12-20 05:57:00,7,"Check out Gateway North Outfitters. Lucas has a nice boat in outpost on Pipestone Lake. Also, Mike Henry of Pipestone Fly in Outposts has a nice boat in outpost on Slender Lake, which is connected to Pipestone. Both Great people!!"
4389641,walleye IA,2015-12-20 06:02:00,129,"From the looks of the website the place looks great, but how is the fishing?"
4380729,Mr Walleye,2015-12-15 16:24:00,29,"Looking for suggestions for the best boat-in outposts in Ontario based on:Quality and cleanliness of cabin(s)RemotenessFishing for above average size (18""+) WALLEYE"
4380801,123chadder,2015-12-15 16:40:00,429,tons of info on here.......do a search in this section
4381609,ftfarms,2015-12-15 21:54:00,444,My pick would be on lake of the woods out of morson. If you can get one of Matt's new cabins at Rex toltons milesbay camp they are real nice. The six Person cabin is one of the nicest cabins I've stayed in. Walleye fishing in milesbay is real good and little traverse bay is awesome.
4381697,Baseline,2015-12-16 05:12:00,3207,"Ontario is a big Province. In Northwestern Ontario (the area north of MN) I have two recommendations for a boat in. Chamberlin Narrows on the east side of Lac Suel and Separation Lake Camp on the English River north of Kenora, Ontario. My preference is Separation Camp because I like the owner and atmosphere of the camp. Either way you will not be disappointed with the fishing."
4381953,wallydave,2015-12-16 07:58:00,2151,"Lac Seul Lodge has an outpost cabin they boat into. I haven't fished there but Mike Kansas has, try the search function, Mikes group has been fishing the outpost for many years!"
4382233,Hillbiehle,2015-12-16 09:43:00,66,"Winoga Lodge's Lake St. Joe outpost is second to none. Large fish, very remote, and a cabin that's about as nice as my house. Looking forward to going back sometime soon..."
4382281,Carnhzkr,2015-12-16 10:01:00,964,"Lac Seul Lodge actually has two boat-in outpost camps. One at Black Bay as mentioned by wallydave and one on Sunlight Lake, accessed by navigating about 7 miles of Altimeter Creek. The Black Bay outpost has a min occupancy of, I believe, six and the only way to get it is to wait for someone to die or perhaps a cash bribe to the Zahns (owners of LSL). I've managed to get the Sunlight Outpost twice in August due to last minute cancellations. The SL outpost itself is remote, but if you go out to Lac Seul to fish the Manitoba Point area and the numerous mid-lake humps, you won't be alone. Fishing, though, is awesome in that area of LS once the fish move out to the main lake in mid-summer. One more on the western side of LS; Scout Lake Lodge operates a boat-in outpost deep into McKinzie Bay, but I don't know anything about it. I'll bet it's booked tight, though."
4383033,Mr Walleye,2015-12-16 15:51:00,29,"Baseline - Is there much traffic on the road to Separation's outpost? The road looks real close to the cabin. Also, are you pretty much alone when out fishing? Thanks!"
4383169,ftfarms,2015-12-16 16:31:00,444,I haven't stayed at the main camp at seperation but did for several years at the camp site. The cabins are 7 miles up the lake. The road runs right by the camp sites. That's where you check in at and put your boat in to go to the main camp. As far as the fishing there's not that much company on the lake. The only time we fish around anyone was on walleye flats. We spent most of our time fishing the river. The only traffic we seen on the road was logging trucks. Fishing on seperation is as good as it gets for walleye and smallmouth. There are some big pike in the lake also. Most of the guest at the cabins fish down around the lodge weve seen some up the river but not to often. Hope this helps.
