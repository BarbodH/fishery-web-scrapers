4384097,MrSimon,2015-12-17 07:52:00,922,"Check the water temperature as soon as you arrive. Some lakes stay cool, even in August .... meaning fish might stay shallower than you think. We fished a lake pretty far north in late August, and expected we'd be fishing deep for pike and walleye. Our largest pike came from shallow weed beds and we caught walleye in as shallow as three feet of water. Turns out that particular lake stayed cool all year long."
4384145,Fisherman Ted,2015-12-17 08:22:00,461,"Good point on water temperature. On the flip side, when it is really hot I have found that sometimes walleye will head into weed beds to keep the sun off their back instead of heading to deeper waters. -FT"
4385433,yoopertrout,2015-12-17 17:25:00,1172,Thanks for all the good advice!
4400969,Bushman74,2015-12-25 10:14:00,8,"We fished Beattie lake with Air Ivanhoe August 15-22, 2015. First three days were sweltering at 84-86 degrees. Still caught fish. Drifted across and with drop offs. Depth went from 12-19 foot within 10-15 yards and they were sitting on the edges. Used a 3/8 oz pink jig head with a crawler. Sometimes the action was crazy with 10 fish on a 100-yard drift. Other times it was only 2 but it was still a ton of fun. We found a couple shoals in the lake where the depth was around 15 foot but the shoal was 10-12 foot. Talk about nuts! Our boat didn't have an anchor so we would just drift across it, catch a bunch, then fire up and re-run the drift. We caught 64 walleye that night in just over two hours. (2 guys) The weather turned overcast and the wind died down a bit and the fishing actually got worse than when it was 85 degrees. We still ended up with 305 walleyes that week. A few around 26"" but not many. Mostly 18"" Dad landed a nice pike around 36"". The measuring tape was worn off the boat and we didn't think to bring one. We are booking again for 2016 in August. Using a different outfitter. I think we will be using Outpost Camps. I will make the final decision after the holiday. We knew it might be warm, but we had a better chance at stable weather so we chose August."

4408929,pike50plus,2015-12-29 13:03:00,584,What body of water are you fishing?
4409321,yoopertrout,2015-12-29 16:21:00,1172,It's called Deaddog Lake. It's through Kabeelo Outfitters. It's about 1000 acres and stained. Any tips?
4378681,yoopertrout,2015-12-14 18:53:00,1172,"Hello, I've only been walleye fishing in Canada in May and June. Last trip was 2014 - first fly-in, and we had a blast. We went in June. The group before us was getting the fish shallow. We caught some in 10-12 ', but did the best in 18-25 feet just off shore (as opposed to out around islands.) Salted minnows worked equally as well as live minnows. Both worked best with pink twister tails. Twisters alone didn't work nearly as well. Next summer, we are going in August. I've heard others say it can be good then, and we thought that steadier weather and no bugs might be nice. I assume we'll be fishing at least as deep as last time. I've heard some say that, in August it can be better off of islands than near the main shore. Any thoughts on types of water and depths? Do you think salter minnows will be good? Would it be important to bring leeches or live minnows. I've fished more for trout and bass than walleyes down here in Wisconsin, but I know people around here stress switching to leeches in summer. Any thoughts would be much appreciated. Thank you. Tom"
4378801,Pooch,2015-12-14 19:23:00,4619,"August is probably my favorite time to fish Canada. Stable weather, bugs seldom a real problem, fish are pretty predictable as far as location.Weather can be great with cool nights and sometimes very warm days. Not much different than July. End of August will see the beginning of the end of summer. Barely perceptable is the trace of color change in the foliage. Have been there in late August when it was hot and uncomfortable and also when we wore all the clothes we had with us everyday. Every season is different, but fishing is usually pretty predicable.Most of the time fish are plumping up for winter and have more girth than June and July fish. Even more noticeable in September.Same baits as summer. Fish will tend to be in the main lake areas if there is structure or something to draw them there. Depth? Usually the same to deeper. Still, don't be shy about at least looking at shallower water if the wind is blowing in. Especially if rocks are there and close to deeper water.Pooch"
4378921,ftfarms,2015-12-14 20:08:00,444,Mid July-end of August is awesome walleye fishing. 3/4oz and 1-1/4 oz bottom bouncers and spinners baited with worms or leeches. Fish weed lines mid lake humps island points. Find a good spot and stop and jig I use jigs with same bait don't use twister tails no more just whistler jigs or knuckle head jigs. I fish last week in may or first week of june and mid July and mid August if I can Favorite is second week of August.
4379161,BornToFish,2015-12-14 21:23:00,1224,"Some great advice has already been given by previous posters regarding fishing during August in NW Ontario.I have fished in NW Ontario for two weeks during August for the last ten years. One thing that I have noticed on occasion is that anglers sometimes struggle during August, when they normally do very well during the opening weeks of the season. I believe they used their proven techniques in their proven springtime places. They didn't adjust their techniques and places to fishto reflect the seasonal movements of the walleyes. I often fish in about 15-18 fow when I arrive at the lakes that I fish during early August. I am typically fishing 25-30 fow of water when I leave for home two weeks later. The sides of off-shore structure are a great place to fish during August on the lake that I primarily fish. Points and wind-blown structure are also good places to fish.For me, August is the time of the season when I slow down and dissect structure. Boat control is a key to my fishing success as vertical jigging is an awesome way to keep the jig/bait in the strike zone at all times. This is in marked contrast to my spring time fishing when I cover water to locate fish. When I pull up to a rock hump during August and catch a walleye or two, I start thinking that I have a chance of catching every walleye on that rock hump as I now know where they all are!I have found that all live bait (crawlers, leeches and minnows) typically works well for me during early August. Most years, the walleye bite collapses to minnows towards the end of August. I have had success with salted minnows, but would use live minnows if they are available.I don't know where you will be fishing, so can't give specific information. However, from a more general perspective I encourage you to be willing to adapt your strategies and techniques to the seasonal movements of the fish! You will likely need to fish deeper than you are accustomed to and in places you may not have fished before. If in doubt, SLOW DOWN!Good Fishing and Tight Lines!!"
4379601,Lovetofish,2015-12-15 07:59:00,458,My favorite time is early August. Salted minnows and jigs with twisters or spinner rigs is what I use but I will play around with a Cleo spoon from time to time. Have fun.
4379793,Slab Seeker,2015-12-15 09:10:00,14,We have always gone in the second week of August and love it. Less/no bugs and the walleye bite is good. Others have indicated technique to use. Sometimes it can be warm but still a great time. Good luck.
4380953,yoopertrout,2015-12-15 17:34:00,1172,"Thanks everyone for the advice and encouragement! I'm already getting pumped for the trip. We're going with Kabeelo Outfitters, and we'll be on a stained lake that is about 1 mile by 3 miles, about 50 miles north of Ear Falls Ontario."
4381393,Golden Eagle,2015-12-15 20:10:00,2642,Walleyes will be where there's sufficient oxygen in the water. Walleyes will be where their food is tasty and plentiful.
4381569,ftfarms,2015-12-15 21:10:00,444,One thing I will add. We use too do a fly out 75 miles north of earfalls in August and one thing that worked well was trolling cranckbaits in 10 foot too 13 foot of water. Fire tiger-blue chrome and chartruse- purple was are favorite.
4383313,yoopertrout,2015-12-16 17:16:00,1172,Thank you.
