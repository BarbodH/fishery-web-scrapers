4406753,SkiSoloII,2015-12-28 15:17:00,4,"There was another thread looking for nice accomodations in Canada. I want to go with my FIL and BIL next summer, but all the locations in that thread were mostly accessable from Minnesota - I'm in Michigan. Does anyone have a list of suggestions further east and easier to access from Michigan? The only decent one I've been able to locate is Pine Portage Lodge. Thanks, Dave"
4406889,Mike Borger,2015-12-28 16:10:00,1554,I'm super familiar with that region. The easy answer for me is Lodge 88 on Esnagi Lake. I was there with my family last August and that facility is something special.http://www.canadafishingguide.net/th...-eighty-eight/
4407609,adempsey,2015-12-28 22:00:00,963,"The Wilderness North Lodges, Smoothrock Camp and Marmac Lodge seem relatively nice to me. There's also Esnagami Wilderness Lodge.There's several places out of Hornepayne that I think are quite nice as well, such as Expeditions North, KayVee Lodge, Agich's Kaby Kabins, Leuenberger's Kag Lodge and Buck & Bingwood. I also like the boat-in lodges on Lady Evelyn Lake - Island 10 and Garden Island Lodge.It depends on what you are looking for. How nice is nice to you?"

4412081,Bstar,2015-12-30 15:39:00,564,"I've been to Esnagami Wilderness lodge and they have everything your looking for. Don't know about the queen size bed but I would ask. 18 ft cedar boats, great food and staff. Good walleye and pike fishing. Eric and his wife Sue have a very nice lodge there. I haven't been to Lodge 88 but I really liked Mike's video and report on it. Really looks like a nice place. It's on my to go list."
