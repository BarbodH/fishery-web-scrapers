4389377,Daveygravy,2015-12-19 19:46:00,88,"Going to lake St Joe this July and have a question about the best way to modify the treble hooks on my multiple hook crankbaits. The rule as I understand it is "" 1 barbless hook only"" so will the baits swim OK with only 1 hook? If so , what hook will have a better hooking percentage front or rear ? Or do I leave all hooks on and disable all but 1. But which one?"
4389393,ftfarms,2015-12-19 20:09:00,444,Leave the back hook on and bend all three barbs down. Don't effect the bait much. That's what we've done in the past.
4389441,Pooch,2015-12-19 20:37:00,4619,"I only run one treble on any of my crankbaits. I remove all hooks and replace the rear treble with one size larger and use a dremal tool to remove those bards. When reinstalling that only treble watch how you want the hooks to be oriented. Try to keep one hook of the treble facing straight up. That leaves the other two at an angle and eliminates some snags. From the rear it will look like an upside down ""Y"".Not perfect, but it works and with only one hook involved it sure is easier to get fish out of a net without impaling yourself with a treble thrashing around.Figured this out after watching helplessly while one of my early years fishing buddies had a northern and his hand attached to the same crankbait. Not pretty.....Pooch"
4390977,Walleyeski,2015-12-21 08:06:00,40,"What I've done when I go to Lake St. Joe is to remove the original treble hooks and replace them with Sureset treble hooks and cut the barbs off. This way you can put the originals back on when you get home. Also buy a split ring pliers, it makes things a lot easier. I run the tremble hook on the tail. Any questions or want to talk about Lake St. Joe send me a p/m."

4392481,Fred_G,2015-12-21 23:06:00,908,I've been fishing Lake St Joe for 20 years and have never seen any need or advantage to using crankbaits. Jigs and spoons catch all the fish I can handle in a day and I don't have to mess around removing a set of trebles. Just my $0.02.
4394465,Daveygravy,2015-12-22 17:30:00,88,You should expand your horizons and throw a crankbait on those wind blown points . The vicious strike is way better than the little tap of a jig hit.
4395185,Fred_G,2015-12-22 22:35:00,908,"I do that but use spoons rather than crankbaits. You're right, the hits are hard."
4408881,pike50plus,2015-12-29 12:51:00,584,cut the points of the front hook off so the weight is closer and avoid snags too. Some guys attach a small old style sinker with the swivel eue with a snap after removing the front hook. this will also get the lure a little deeper.
