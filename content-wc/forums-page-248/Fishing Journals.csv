4405585,tv4fish,2015-12-28 06:56:00,2694,"We also prepare a ""daily log"" of our Canadian fishing trips. Every day when we are on our way back to our cabin (we launch at a public access), we record our catch (we use lap counters to record under, in, and over slot for walleyes), the No. of northerns and smallmouths. We record the weather, the temp at start and end of day, where we caught the fish, what they hit on best, etc. Over the years it has been interesting to compare these notes - a lot of similarities for our ""best"" days."
4409377,kzoofisher,2015-12-29 16:45:00,5144,Similarities in? Weather? Location types? Temp? Hot baits? Don't leave us hanging!
4410377,octanehi5,2015-12-30 06:12:00,1104,"Air Tam make us fill out a daily report on all the fish caught that day, its very easy to total up at the end of the trip. as to what they are hitting thats in my head not any journal"
4410441,tv4fish,2015-12-30 06:27:00,2694,"Primarily weather conditions -- nice breeze from the right direction - cloud cover, etc. Since we fish Lac Seul at about the same time of the year every year and in the same locations - It seems that if you have good weather conditions, the bite is always better."
4411409,kzoofisher,2015-12-30 11:19:00,5144,Thanks. I have also found that a steady wind from the right direction can really make a spot fish well. The trick of course is to have enough spots to cover 360 degrees of wind and then to get the wind to quit switching around. Windy is definitely a high maintenance mistress.
4399521,Guest,2015-12-24 13:44:00,0,"Just wondering how many of you keep a fishing journal and what information do you use it for? I recently updated mine by putting the numbers and type of fish caught on an excel spreadsheet. I was able to show my wife that since 1992 I had only caught 570 walleye and 202 Northern Pike. Proof that I have not been to Canada all that much (or else am a lousy fisherman!). Argument held up pretty well until she asked me how my total of 13,325 fish caught in 23 years showed a lack of time on the water. Booked a trip to Brace Lake Ontario for 2016 just the same."
4399713,yoopertrout,2015-12-24 14:56:00,1172,"For a few years, about twenty years ago, I used to keep a list of the trout I caught, and when and where (I mostly only fished for trout back then.) I used it to try to learn the mayfly hatches etc. Now, I have a list of the bodies of water I've fished,, what I've caught in them, the muskies I've caught, and all northern pike over 30"" I've caught. This year I broke 150 bodies of water fished in Upper Michigan (where I do most of my fishing.) The musky and ""big"" pike list is just for fun. I just enjoy keeping lists."
4400369,Pooch,2015-12-25 02:57:00,4619,"I've kept a running ""diary"" of our fishing trips for a long time. I use a spiral notebook and a week trip usually is about five or six pages long. So a lot of years can go into one notebook.I only write down approximate fish counts for each boat and who was fishing with who that day. Maybe note an out of the ordinary meal or incident that we will want to remember in the future. I also like to log any ""fish of note"". I'll include baits, lures or colors that are working or not working. Weather gets a passing mention if it is out of the ordinary or effects fishing. I try to list how much bait we brought with us. This really helps for future trip planning.It's not a big deal, but makes for some interesting reading when the winter doldrums appear. I only wish my penmanship was better as some entries are hard to read or hard to figure out what I was thinking when making the original entry.The top of the first page for each trip includes date, lake and list of who was on the trip. As I get older the trips are running together and this helps sort them out for me.We also take a fair amount of pictures every year. I'm amazed at how every trip looks the same, but for the increasing girth and grey hair that all my buddies seem to be growing or not growing. These guys need to take better care of themselves....Pooch"
4400497,Skywagon,2015-12-25 06:02:00,1106,"I began keeping a list of lakes in 2008. Each lake's name is recorded (if there is one), location, year fished, mode of transportation to get there, target species of fish, rating for how good the fishing was and who the characters were I fished with. I should record gallons of gas burned per fish . Since recording began in 2008, I have fished 81 different lakes, many within 30 air miles of my house and have not scratched the surface. I am looking forward to knocking off a few more this winter, whenever the trout lakes get good ice."
4400769,jabecker,2015-12-25 08:04:00,118,"I keep track each time out on a spreadsheet also. It consists of what lake, the weather with air temp, wind speed and direction. The type of day, if it is sunny, cloudy, raining or snowing etec. The type and number of fish I catch. The depth that I catch the fish at, along with the location I was fishing. The surface temp of the water I was fishing. Also what time I fished at."
4400785,Guest,2015-12-25 08:25:00,0,"Yeah, I started mine when I began forgetting little details. I just wanted to keep track of all the dates and places I went to and what baits were working and the weather etc.... Then I wrote all the funny and unusual stories. Even wrote some personal things about events in my life that were coinciding with fish trips. Have used it to fact check my fishing buddies stories a number of times. Having the numbers of fish is a bonus, and I was surprised when I finally tallied them that I did not have as many Canada trips as I thought. Did catch a lot up there in the 80's before I was keeping journal though."
4401753,ftfarms,2015-12-25 21:50:00,444,"I have a friend that has kept a journal since he turned 16. We are in our low 50s now. He puts the specie of fish how many and how many hours he fished that day. He's over 37,000 fish and over 3,000 walleyes in 38 years. He fishes almost everyday in the spring-summer and fall. It's pretty cool when you see it."
4404705,Guest,2015-12-27 17:31:00,0,"That 37,000 sure is a lot of fish. Does he have a normal life with family and work and all that stuff? Hard to get all that fishing in, but once you know the spots it gets easier.. Probably a lot to learn by reading it."
4404913,BornToFish,2015-12-27 18:19:00,1224,"Many of the previous post on this thread mentioned good information to record. I also record information such as water temperatures in the main lake basin and various bays that I routinely fish. I record the depth of the thermocline. I also record fishing baits, locations, techniques and patterns that produced my fish. I record the depth of water showing me fish. I also record places (e.g. names of rock humps) that were good or poor. I note the weather patterns during the week(s) that I fish and relate these weather patterns to my fishing activity. I review my fishing logs before each trip for entries at that time of the year. For example, If I am going to fish in NW Ontario during August, I review my diary entries for late July to late August. These diary entries paint a broad picture of fishing at that time of the season. When I get to the lake, I go out and measure water temperatures and depth of thermocline. This information gives me a good snapshot picture of the lake that I can compare to the broad picture of fishing from my diary entries. Thus, I have a good idea where to start my vacation based on proven historical results. This approach suits me well as I don't like fumbling around trying to get something going from scratch. The last several trips during August featured relatively cool water temperatures in the main lake basin, compared to ""normal"" years that I have entered into my diary. The thermocline was fairly high in the water column. Knowing this, I knew to start looking on day #1 for walleyes and pike near the tops of the rock humps in the main lake. My wife and I worked this pattern very hard from the first day of our trips and cashed in big time. I am a very big believer in fishing diaries. It's like asking when should I have planted a new tree. The answer is always ""twenty years ago"". It's the same thing for fishing diaries. I wish I started my diary during the first trip to Canada rather than waiting until a few years ago. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4405073,ftfarms,2015-12-27 19:25:00,444,He manages a big steak house has for years. He works afternoons and nights. He fishes almost everyday. I tell people that he's somebody that could catch a fish out of a mud hole. He doesn't have any children; was married for a year or so. he lives by himself so he's always worked around his fishing time.
