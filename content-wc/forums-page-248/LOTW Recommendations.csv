Like posted somewhere else where ever you choose to go I think you will have a great time. Many good camps, and a great lake for Muskie! Good Luck!!"
4347353,Eric.hallagan,2015-11-29 09:40:00,32,"Mike,you know my opinion on Obabikon on LOTW- but what a first class family ran resort- good food, great staff and outstanding customer service. Located in a secure location and close to multiple species. We will be annual customers every year! Eric"

4393505,Maskinonge,2015-12-22 11:24:00,13,"Hello all, Hoping to pressure test some thinking among you LOTW veterans. Headed up June 18 for my second LOTW trip. I've fished out of Morson a few Junes back (Red Wing Lodge), and while we had a blast and did catch a lot of walleyes, it was bigger water, cloudier than we preferred, especially out of a rental boat. We had just missed the early spring shallow water bite, so we had to fish the reefs when staying closer to home, boat control was tough. We did find some nice clear water up in Miles Bay, and some more traditional Canada-style (at least as I envision it) pike and musky action up in Obobikon, but quite a hike (again in a rental with a 25 HP and a weak sauce trolling motor that we brought with us.) I'm thinking of taking my boat (17' w/90 HP), which should solve the problem of easily getting up to Miles or Obobikon, if necessary, and boat control if forced to fish big, deeper water. But I'm also thinking of trying Split Rock Lodge to get deeper into Eastern and North East Sabaskong, to give us access to more of the thinner channels and islands in comparatively small water, with more for shallow, weedy bays for musky and pike. Is the distinction I'm drawing between the mouth of Sabaskong near Morson, and the other side of Sabaskong, deeper in toward Nester Falls, correct? Is there a difference in water clarity? There must be a difference in wind action - just smaller bodies of water. So much depends on the time of year, I suppose, but can't go earlier than June 18 because that's the musky opener and that's half the draw for our group. OK, sorry for the long post, any feedback would be helpful."
4393817,ftfarms,2015-12-22 14:21:00,444,If i was you I would stay with tamarack island lodge. Some of the best mushy fishing in that area. Your not that far from traverse bay some awesome walleye fishing in little traverse. You can get to milesbay and obabikon from there also. We stay in miles bay with Matt at Rex toltons milesbay camp and fish a lot in little traverse. Smallmouth and walleyes in milesbay can be real good that time of year also.
4396081,Maskinonge,2015-12-23 08:48:00,13,"Thanks, farms will check both of them out. Was aware of Rex Tolton's, not sure why that wasn't on our radar as we did well in Miles Bay. Saw that Jared at Obabikon recommended Tamarack, which is high praise. Would have done Obabikon if we could have made the weeks line up correctly. New wrinkle is that in order to convince our dads to go (both in their late 60s), we may need to avoid boat-in. They like the feeling they don't have to rely on a boat ride to get to a town. Red Wing should work if that's the case as Mylie's is all booked up for musky opener."
4396865,pikeandtina,2015-12-23 12:19:00,145,"Mike, I fish w/a new river smallmouth outfitter who has fished out of Ash Rapids Lodge, and he has said that they fish Shoal Lake, which in his words ""he can't imagine anyplace having better northern, smallmouth, and walleye fishing."" While you can't target walleye there he says they always catch them while northern/smallie fishing. He went on to say when you do hook one, that they are usually huge. Think there are only one or two camps actually on Shoal. Good luck, John"

4237634,bassnblast,2015-10-02 16:33:00,56,"Mike-A friend and I fished out of Ash Rapids Lodge in early June. We focused on bass (which was amazing), but I'm told the area waters -- especially the 'labyrinth' between LOTW and Shoal Lake -- are great for musky. Ash Rapids is only about 5 minutes from this area...From past posts I know you're a big pike junkie, so you would get the added bonus of great pike fishing on Shoal if you wanted. Plus Ash Rapids is the closest LOTW lodge to Winnipeg. Just a couple hours drive.Might be worth a look. We had a great time...Dan"
4238386,zeebee,2015-10-02 22:24:00,1144,"+1 on the lab area (refer post above)...when I target ""skis""on LOTW its where I head. Phenomenal bass in that area too. Both love top water."
4240762,Tamarack,2015-10-04 00:46:00,16,"Hello Todd from Tamarack here. First thanks to Jared from Obabikon for the kind words. Also thanks to the first poster for his recommendation. Just so you know we are quite remote, and do have great boats that are well set up including an Alumacraft Navigator 175 with a 90 hp Yamaha 4 stroke. The boat is well set up with a Minkota Terrova 24 volt Ipilot trolling motor. It also has a hummingbird 858 with the Lakemaster chip. We do have 20 Muskies over 50"" this year as well as 24 last year and 19 the year before that. Wherever you decide to go you will have a blast. Tamarack Todd"
4240810,Mike Borger,2015-10-04 05:30:00,1554,Thanks for chiming in Todd. I had a look at your site and already noticed the boats look great!
4260922,kayakmatt,2015-10-13 07:19:00,105,"Our group stayed at Crow Rock's ""Sunset Cabin"" this past June. Very nice cabin about a mile from the main lodge. We did American Plan and ate all meals at the lodge. Excellent dock, walkway to cabin, and best feature was the large screened in porch with large table and comfy chairs. Had bears every day at the cabin, but they never bothered us other than just lingering around. Only downside was the cabin sits on a point with a big red marker bouy just off shore on a main travel route, so boats would come buzzing by all day...even big cruisers...so you could feel not so remote or simply feel like your back home and enjoy seeing all the different boats and funky cruisers and barges coming by."

4263962,KM1,2015-10-14 09:01:00,374,"a good number of camps on LOTW (Soix Narrows, Kenora area) and there is now only one place I will go....Witch Bay Camp, http://www.witchbay.com/. Rental boats are awesome, food great, accommodations rustic to very nice (you have a choice depending on what you want), owners...employees wonderful, and a guide program (if needed) second to none. As I said, after years of looking, I won't go anywhere else. Choose them over a fly-in (for several reasons)!!!"
4315914,TRFDDS,2015-11-11 18:03:00,13,Check out Reel Em Inn lodge. About 30 min boat ride west and north of Morson. Smaller lodge with 2 cabins. We have been there for 6 years in a row. Usually fish walleye which is great. Big pike many small mouth and we have met folks that come every year to fish Muskie in the fall. A few years back some kids from NE caught a 45 in Muskie right near the docks. Vic and Geri are great hosts and serve good home-cooked meals. Cost is pretty good compared to fly-ins. But nearly as remote. Almost never see any other boats unless we go around the northwest point of big island near Garden Island. http://www.reeleminnlodge.com/Good fishing !!

He may eventually chime in on this thread, but I believe he may still be on LOTW this week musky fishing. He has been going there for a very long time and is a wealth of knowledge on specific areas of the lake and outfitters. Send him a PM and I'm sure he'll get back to you as soon as he returns. I'm anxiously awaiting his trip report to see if his wife outfished him again !!!!! Best of luck on your planning adventure. PjShorthorn."

4236906,jimirjr,2015-10-02 10:37:00,1149,Take a look at www.tomahawkresort.com GREAT family run resort.. Beautiful Cabins.... Even have Houseboat rentals if thats Your bag.. Thier rental equipment is second to none! Especially Their fishing boats. Very close proximity to MUSKIE areas...
4237010,Hawker,2015-10-02 12:02:00,3967,"If it were me, I'd look no further than Young's Wilderness Camp! You'd have two options there actually! The area YWC is located in is pretty remote of itself, they have excellent and roomy camp boats, the area offers excellent opportunities for BIG muskies and an excellent camp owned and operated by excellent folks. They also have a fly in camp on Kish, a lake that is loaded with nothing but Muskies, Smallmouth and Lake Trout. The fly in is very remote, but the cabin has all the amenities one could ask for in a remote fly in. Boats there are also excellent, and the fishing there is nothing short of amazing!! (http://youngswildernesscamp.com/)"
4234378,Mike Borger,2015-10-01 08:43:00,1554,"Hey guys I know there's a ton of info in the archives on LOTW, but I'd still appreciate everyone's direct input.I've never fished it and that situation needs to be rectified. At the moment I'm mulling over a possible trip in September of next year with Musky as the sole focus.I'd like to fish a part of the lake that doesn't see a lot of pressure, the more remote the better. Also I'm not really interested in being fed at a lodge, that rarely works when you're on the water 12 plus hours a day. Housekeeping is fine. I'm not going to trailer a boat, so really good camp boats are a must, probably the most important criteria.What do you guys say, where would you go?"
4234410,DeBo,2015-10-01 09:08:00,211,"I don't know much about the best boats to rent as I have my own but have researched many places and can offer some location thoughts. For musky focus you would be hard pressed to beat Tamarack Island. Boat-in about 8 miles west of Morson. You can hit multiple different basins from there with good numbers and big fish. Be aware that in September you will be dealing with potentially significant algae blooms. That part of the lake gets a fair bit of wind induced currents which should help with bloom. Some of the island resorts roughly halfway between Nestor Falls and Morson would also be nice locations. Lots of structure to keep you busy out that way and might be a bit more comfortable water overall out of a rental boat. The basin west of Morson is BIG water. I have researched hansens king island, sabaskong bay lodge, and split rock. Sandy's Blackhawk Island in the NW angle portion would be a great place to go as well from everything I have read. The angle is great water as well. That might be a good bit more challenging to get to for you from the east. Not sure if boating in from Kenora would be an option. Fewer camps on the north end. Witch Bay gets solid reviews and is isolated. Heard they have great boats but it is american plan only. There is smith's camp east of kenora that might have boats as well. I believe the north end of the lake has less bloom overall. Not sure your budget but if it is high you could look into Wiley Point, Crowrock, and Big Narrows resort. All in the big narrows and slightly north section of the lake. If I was wealthy I would go to that part of the lake..... I always go to canada with my own boat so never researched rentals. Should at least be a start on camps to check. On LOTW I have stayed at Buena Vista at Morson, an outpost camp out of the angle, the Sanctuary resort, and whitefish bay camp. Most of my canadian musky fishing has been on the winnipeg river downstream from LOTW out of the town of Minaki."
4234554,Mike Borger,2015-10-01 10:21:00,1554,"THANK YOU for the detailed and well thought out reply, much appreciated! One thing you mentioned was an algae bloom at that time of year, I didn't know that, thanks for the heads up."

4234602,Mike Borger,2015-10-01 10:37:00,1554,"Thanks Adam, had never thought about an outpost camp!"
4234658,DeBo,2015-10-01 11:10:00,211,Mike feel free to message me if you have any other questions. I wouldn't let the bloom sway you from September if it works out best for your schedule. Just need to be aware of it. If you go in July there will be no bloom but there are a lot more boats on the water.
4234754,Thompmd,2015-10-01 12:02:00,320,"Hi Mike,Sabaskong Bay near Nestor Falls is where I have been(from June 1-30). I'm not sure I would rule out your own boat, lots of advantages to that but depending on what your boat is the wind/dock location might cause some damage especially the more remote you are.Have you considered a private cabin? Obabikon gets good reviews as well.Another ""day trip"" would be to trailer your boat to Crow/Kakagi. Its pretty remote, crystal clear and full of Muskies.Sabaskong I don't think you will find the remoteness your looking for but their are tons of islands/structures which would be beneficial in September.I know this post isn't what you were really for but thought it might spark something?Good Luck, great all species lake."
4234778,Mike Borger,2015-10-01 12:08:00,1554,"Thanks, have looked at the Sabaskong area. If I do this I'll be flying to Winnipeg and renting a minivan. Would love to bring my boat but time constraints and my severe aversion to the 23 hour drive will not permit it."
4234922,ftfarms,2015-10-01 13:20:00,444,"Not sure about how the camp boats are but we love staying at,Rex toltons milesbay camp. It's pretty remote. Matt and jenn are great people. We've also stayed with grassy narrow and Wayne is a great guy also. I've seen some big musksy in milesbay and little traverse bay. We all bring are own boat so I really didn't pay attention to the camp boats. I know there's real good musky fishing around tamaroc island. Jared at obabikon bay lodge is a great guy also not sure what he has to offer for house keeping or camp boats."
