1150754,cruiseforever,2009-11-29 08:40:00,177,I have seen posts online with groups looking for some to go with their group. Has anyone done this? And how was it? Just had to cancel a trip to Canada in July due to family health issues and still have a strong intrest in going.

It all depends on how picky you are, from dishes, to fish cleaning, to money, to fishing in general. I know guys who drink all week and fish 3 hours a day. I drink and fish all week in rain,sleet,and snow. The group I go with consists of 6 guys usually. We all put money in a ""kitty"" for gas and any food bought. Once in camp we all pick up, clean fish, cook, and do dishes. Everyone helps out in any way possible. We all borrow lures, line, and rods from each other knowing that your bought it if you brake it. Be very cautious in going with strangers, it is a lot of money to waste on a bad trip........."
1150925,cruiseforever,2009-11-30 06:42:00,177,That is what I was thinking. It would be intresting to hear from people that have done it.

When I was younger, I took a number of folks from fishing classes that I taught - most worked out well, non horribly bad, but I had a little ""with"" time first to check them out before the trip. Like a first date, some were asked again, others were not. Bill Krejca"
1151048,thunderatwork,2009-11-30 15:06:00,79,"due to some work freebies, over the years i've gone on fishing trips with people I never new before. only had one trip not turn out. they were on a drinking trip, i was on a fishing trip, hence a little difference of plans. the last day we fished less than two hours due to excessive drinking the night before. had some lazy bums on these trips before, however that is relatively easy to deal with."
1151275,Mike Kansas,2009-12-01 14:32:00,1463,"Our group has done it twice and both times turned out GREAT. In both cases I required a larger than normal advance payment from ""strangers"" to make sure that Lodging commitments and food would not be a burden on others. I also spent a lot of time talking to them on the phone in order to let them know what is expected from them and what they can expect from our group. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1152344,worthsr,2009-12-05 18:56:00,52,"Our group hasn't taken a stranger. If we have a spot open up a ""regular"" can bring a friend. They are responsible for the newbe and making sure they understand the expectations. Only once has the newbe disappointed. The annual trip is important to my mental health, so much so I wouldn't take a chance on a complete stranger. That being said, I'd drive to Kansas to pick up Mike if we were a man short! Happy Holidays, Scott"
