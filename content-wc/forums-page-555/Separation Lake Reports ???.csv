1145961,Guest,2009-11-02 18:48:00,0,"Went this year for the first time to the lodge. Really a remote, big lake. We had 5 out of the seven days of hot weather, blue skies, and no wind. we caught fish, but needed to work for them on these days. Not huge numbers though. The 2 days with rain we did really well. Around the corner from the lodge seemed to be the best spot. It was our first time on the lake, so we didn't really know the spots yet. The dock hand was a big help and the lodge was well run. I'd like to try it again. Also, don't wast your time with live bait. Artificials worked just as well."
1146207,FISH-IT,2009-11-03 20:15:00,7,Big fish are you staying at the lodge or campground? My group fished this lake for 13years but not the last 3years. We always went 1st or 2nd week of june. We stayed at the lodge so we mainly fished that end of the lake and over on lount lake. Its a great lake with big fish but be carefull the lake has lots of shallow reefs and rocks trust me i know look at the map. Let me know were your staying and i will get you started. I may be back at separation next june.

I caught 12 pike from 36-43"" and did not fish hard for them.The owner can put you on the fish. Just ask him to show you where they are catching them.We did well on walleyes in the bays in 8-10 feet (wind blown shorelines)when we were there. The smallies were on the rocks along the shore. The pike were on the outside of the walleye schools, weedy bays and areas where the yellow perch were spawning (weedy bays).All of the bays held tons of fish. Most had all species in them. Great time to go there, but can be cold."

1148164,thunderatwork,2009-11-15 09:41:00,79,"I've never fished separation, however have fished just up stream in lount a couple of times in the mid '90s. the english river is a awesome walleye fishery, with some sizeable northerns mixed in. not real sure if the bass is worth getting excited about. was very very limited in the 90s. of course the walleye and northern kept us busy. however the northern fishing isn't that much different than bass fishing-some trolling cranks, casting spinners etc. we never caught a bass in lount. we fished in august-caught most our wallleye on jigs and minnows. The northern on five of diamonds daredevils--3/4 oz. For spots we always found the fish on wind blown points(wind blowing toward land), reefs ,and points near moving water. springtime spots can be different, and early june is spring up there. It is to the point now I leave the bass junk home when traveling to canada. no spinners, no buzz baits, and very very few cranks. but i take at least 3- five of diamond daredevils. and at least 50 jigs in 1/4 and 3/8 oz sizes per person. we would catch most of our walleye in 15 to 22 feet of water. however people have told me early june they can be shallower. My first time to canada the first walleye in caught I grabbed it by the lip just like I would a bass--ouch, took three weeks for my thumb to heal. people at the lodge should be able to get you on fish. supposedly the ""400"" hole at the upper end is always a good spot, however it was to much work for my group, with moving water and snags. If separation is like lount, its hard to troll because of the snags on granite outcroppings. thas near shores, and it never did us any good to troll over big open deep bays. we always laid into the northern in a bay nearly straight south of the 400 hole a mile or two. ( the left side as you come in and the sw rock face). But watch it going to this bay from the 400 hole as there has been a large rock just under the water in what would apppear to be open water."
1148284,tilldawg,2009-11-16 08:26:00,55,"Most of the bays had large groups of walleye and pike. The best were: back bay, seymour, heart shape and moose. We did not get to the other bays. We used jigs for walleye the whole time. Gulp and mister twister tails. We caught most of our walleye in 8-10 feet right up on the weed line on the bank (windblown side of bays). Caught 25-75 each day per person and did not fish for them all day.The bass fishing is unbelievable. We had best luck with rattle traps and beetle spin type baits. They did not seem to be interested in jig presentations. Any point or shoreline with rocks held fish in the bays.The Pike were where they should be: outside the walleye schools and roaming the shallow weedy bays.The owner Jim will put you on the fish. When you get there just ask him to show you where on the map.From what I here, it varies from year to year based on water levels. But at that time the fish should still be in the shallow bays."
1148840,Guest,2009-11-18 17:51:00,0,"I fished this lake in the third week of June 1974, it had been closed down due to the mercury scare. There were 4 of us and we stayed at Halleys Camp by the dam and ran to Separation each day for a week. We were the only boat on the lake the entire week and there was no bridge over the river at that time. To say the fishing was fabulous is an understatement, we caught many 20 pd plus pike, the walleyes were everywhere. The water was several feet high that year and the bushes around the weedbeds were full of fish. The area where the river runs out of the lake was full of very big walleye and smallmouth. Walleye and smallmouth were all through the river down to the Kettlefalls Camp. We have fished all over Ontario and very far North in Manitoba and none of the trips have ever been half of the fishing that week."
