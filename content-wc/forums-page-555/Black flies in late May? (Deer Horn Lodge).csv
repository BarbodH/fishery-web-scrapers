It seems that most archived condition and report posts are later in the season. Is late May, early June not a good time to fish up here? New to this Canada trip thing. Any input is appreciated, thanks!"
1148241,celticbass1,2009-11-15 20:15:00,67,Not familiar with the exact area you are going but we go to northern Ontario every year including May twice. Late May or Early June usually isn't bad for flies but we have had spotty fishing. That could have been the lake or it could have been the weather. Just understand you can run in to some VERY cold weather sometimes that time of year. We once went in May 18 and had to call every day for a week because the lakes still had ice on them. Tight lines Larry

The black flies are usually just starting to bite as our trout trips have ended (15 May). I'd say that you're going to have to contend with lots of black flies in late May or early Jun. I've also fished for walleye in the Abitibi region of Quebec for the last 10 years. The earliest I have fished is late Jun and I've still had to occasionally deal with black flies, particularly in protected bays."
1148416,keek,2009-11-16 19:29:00,1003,Thanks for the insight guys. I'm no stranger to black flies and I know how distracting/painful they can be.For those of you that do fish Canada during the peak bug season is it because it's the only time you can pull off the trip due to other responsibilities? Or is because it's FREAKIN' CANADA BABY!! and there are fish to caught and you could care less about bugs?
1149151,Guest,2009-11-20 06:19:00,0,"Our group has been fishing Cabonga (from Deerhorn) for many years. Just once we went in mid-May to try for big pike. It may have been an unusually cold mid-May and it was difficult to catch fish. We marked tremendous schools of walleye but were able to get few to bite. Had a few snowball fights that trip. From what I have heard from the guides and lodge owner, later in May and early June are bad for black flies, perhaps not as bad as some areas that have more clear flowing streams that the flies prefer. By late June, when we typically go, the black flies have given way to other bloodthirsty critters. The walleye bite is good in late June. Hope this helps....good luck."
1149154,rapp,2009-11-20 06:41:00,48,The black flies start as soon as the tree leaf buds open. This is also your best speckle trout fishing. Also on the flip side first ice 1 inch of ice cut a hole close to shore and watch the action from shore. You cannot stay on the ice it scares the fish away.

1149264,keek,2009-11-20 16:20:00,1003,Thanks guys for the replys. On a side note Deerhorn's website has an archive of pictures and daily reports for the past 4 years. Late May early June of 2008 and 2007 looked like pretty nice numbers of fish we're being caught. I know the past can never be counted on to predict the future though.
