1084427,Backwater Eddy,2009-02-28 07:47:00,3871,"And a GPS....if it starts to snow and you get a White Out situation...it is not easy to find your way back to the landings...not good when that happens.Be sure to mark/name your rig and other GPS points...like the major turns in/out of the river channels onto the big lake, and key reference points so navigating back in tough conditions is easy to do.I just had a group of friends up there and they got into a white-out and did not have there GPS with and they had a time the way it sounded...others had to back track and round them up or they would have been who knows where on that big white lake.A good Garmin Rhino 530 GPS..is very handy deal...Eh!!"
1085328,Backwater Eddy,2009-03-04 05:40:00,3871,Conditions are not are rough as one was first told. Sounds like Trucks are doing ok on most areas and sleds are getting out farther and exploring more.The bite was off for a few days but it is back on again.I'll be headed North soon to wonder around the lake and maybe the river too depending on the weather.
1150497,artieT,2009-11-26 22:28:00,1,I'm looking for a guide for Lake Winnipeg. I am looking to fly into Winnipeg with tackle and electronics and have a guide take me out on the lake. Any help would be appreciated.
1150503,Bandit,2009-11-27 02:33:00,140,Pm me I could help find you a guide depending on your dates?
1150589,manitobawalleye,2009-11-27 16:02:00,885,Artie Give me a call if you want and I can help you out with everything you need. I sent you a pm as well with a link for your viewing. 204-467-9925 Roger Stearns
1150772,Stu McKay,2009-11-29 10:53:00,18,"Hi Artie, Just to bring you up to speed. Twenty two years ago, I started up a fishing resort, which we appropriately named CATS on the RED. Our objective is to provide a complete line on services for our guests. Services which include guest accommodations, open water guide service for multiple species and much, much more. Starting about six years ago, we now offer a full line-up of services that cater to needs of ice fishers seeking a world class trophy walleye experience. (Half a dozen years ago a good friend and I went public with our findings regarding Lake Winnipeg's walleye fishery. We were the first to publicly share our findings which put this world class venue on the map.) I have a variety of packages to meet everyone's needs and budget. We offer a complete All-Inclusive, All-American package with full guide service, meals included. We also offer more basic packages for those seeking to venture out on their own and only require overnight lodging while in the area. Either way we offer a service that can meet everyone's needs! You can contact me at the following: Via tel. (204) 757-9876 (Morning's only) Or simply pm us and we'll be happy to assist you in setting up a trip to the Red River & Lake Winnipeg!"
1150909,Bandit,2009-11-30 04:56:00,140,"Artie, Roger is a good guy. He has a big group of friends that shared informtion on the bite? Knowing Roger is more intested in your friend ship over your money?"
1151091,manitobawalleye,2009-11-30 17:37:00,885,"Thanks L. Lake Winnipeg is a great fishery right now, as you well know. I am always happy to help guys out all I can. I look at it this way.....if I am going out fishing....I am more than happy to take them along. I haven't charged anyone since I gave up my guide licence years ago. You are right about friends, fishing has allowed me to meet a lot of great people. I always enjoy fishing with new people....a great way for myself to learn as well. Looking forward to fishing from Matlock to Pinedock this winter. I am sure we will run into each other somewhere out there. Save some big ones for me............."
1151153,Bandit,2009-11-30 21:42:00,140,Yes Roger Friends & Walleyes for ever
1082883,Batteryman09,2009-02-22 16:15:00,17,"I ice fished Lake Erie 7 days earlier this winter and had a blast there, now I need a new adventure. I had planed on Ice fishing Lac Seul for walleye and Big Vermillion for Lake Trout, but I have been reading a lot of good things about Lake Winnipeg. Now I can not decide on what trip. I should mention that I have fished Lac Seul/ Big Vermillion (open water) 10-20 days a year for the last 15, but I have never fished Lake Winnipeg. Any help on the two would be greatly appreciated. Mike"
1082974,Skywagon,2009-02-23 06:40:00,1106,First some questions. Do you have a snowmachine and portable ice shack? Are you looking to rent a ice shack that is in place or waiting until the weather is warm enough an ice shack is not required? Are you looking for a guided trip or to do on your own?
1083000,Chris K,2009-02-23 08:07:00,278,"You will get much bigger and better quality walleyes out of Lake Winnipeg. It sounds like you are serious about your icefishing, and right up until the end of the season things should only get better on Lake Winnipeg. Chris K"
1083068,Mike Kansas,2009-02-23 11:59:00,1463,Take a look at the RED RIVER north of Selkirk Manitoba and runs into Lake Winnipeg. HOG ICE HEAVEN
1083111,fishncamp,2009-02-23 15:18:00,49,Lk. Winnipeg has been producing many hawgs lately ......4x4 is a must to get around.
1083156,eyewitness,2009-02-23 18:11:00,680,"Mike, shoot me an email at [email protected]I am looking at going to Lake Winnipeg for an ice fishing trip in a few weeks. Maybe you and who ever want to join my buddies and I.I lost your contact info. after we went to Deerpath a few years ago....."
1083235,Batteryman09,2009-02-24 05:30:00,17,"Skywagon, Chris K, Mike Kansas and Fishncamp, Thanks for the response! I do have my own sled and shanty as well as all the gear and then some; I do plan on going without the use of a guide although Lac Seul and Big Vermillion I know extremely well, Winnipeg I have no idea so help would be greatly appreciated. What kind of numbers as far as how many fish per day on Winnipeg, I know it can vary but just trying to get an idea. I have ice fished Lake Erie for 20+ years and the numbers per day can be crazy, we used to get quite a few 10lbs or more, but the last few years it is just a few around that mark here and there. If Winnipeg is good numbers and big fish, I am there!"
1083796,freespoolin,2009-02-25 20:34:00,472,Check out www.manitobaanglers.com re Lake Winnipeg ice fishing.
1084149,Backwater Eddy,2009-02-27 07:07:00,3871,"The lake is producing very well in numbers as well as trophy walleyes. That is until just recently access was good. Due to 6-8"" of new snow and blow, it is back to sleds to access the Southern Basin near the Red. Pretty tough going in a 4 by 4 now is the word.I would plan on bringing snowmobiles if your going to pull into areas worth fishing."
1084288,Batteryman09,2009-02-27 14:00:00,17,"I definitely plan on taking my snowmobile, it is all I use for ice fishing. Great to hear there are good numbers of fish as well! Thanks again!Mike"
