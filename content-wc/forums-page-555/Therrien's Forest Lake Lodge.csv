507294,Guest,2000-03-05 10:40:00,0,I am thinking of fishing out of Therrien's Forest Lake Lodge the first week of July. If anyone can let me know if they have fished here and anything I need to know I would appreciate it. Thanks.

But Gordy took care of our place until he retired from day-to-day activities last year and did a good job. His son, Blair, is now running the place. Gordy still hangs around the lodge during the days chatting it up with guests and guiding ... I don't think he'll ever really fully retire! As I recall, their rates are very reasonable.Best Wishes & Good Fishing!!www.bolen.net/html/canada"

1133834,81Saluki,2009-09-04 11:34:00,97,"The chain is big (7 main lakes) so there is a wide variety of structure to try depending on what the fish prefer at the time ... humps, holes, rocks, stumps, mud ... you name it, it's there. Your chances of catching fish are always good. Gordy/Blair will certainly be able to tell you what's biting where at any given time.Dad has fished the area since the mid-1970s. We mainly go for walleye in Forest, Whitney & Cobble. Forest is probably best known for big muskie -- especially around our cabin -- but plenty of walleye can be caught in the summer/fall. Whitney & Cobble are good year 'round. Nice smallies can be found if you want to hunt for them. For different action, head down to Little Boulder for lake trout.Like anywhere, the best places depend on the time of year and weather. For example, 2 months ago we caught most of our walleye in 4-5 feet near stumps while last week they were in 20+ feet near humps and rock piles. Again, Gordy and Blair can point you to the hot spots.Hope this helped and you decide to give the area a try! Best Wishes and Good Fishing!!!P.S. For more info on the area, check out my web site (www.bolen.net/html/canada). It includes maps with locations of popular/favorite holes (with lat & lon if you have a GPS)."

The fishing is always good, catching at times a little slower than others but there are always fish to be had. The accomodations are great and the service excellent. Our group has been there for 25 years. That should say it all."
