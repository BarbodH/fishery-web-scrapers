1150670,keek,2009-11-28 16:03:00,1003,Wondering what the typical turn around time is for a lodge owner to return a call? I'm guessing it's a pretty busy time up there with closing down the camps for winter but have left a few phone messages as well as emails over the past three weeks. Do I wait for a return call or just keep calling?Thanks

1150674,keek,2009-11-28 16:23:00,1003,"Thanks Golden Eagle,I was coming to the same conclusion about giving them some time to breath."
1150942,Larry Mac,2009-11-30 07:46:00,530,"Hello Keek, I do agree with Golden with giving alittle time. I must say I have been fortunate, I have been in communication with a lodge owner regarding a fly in all weekend long. He operates 27 camps and he has been outstanding answering our questions. He was already short listed by our group, so we booked with him this weekend. Researching is half the fun. Have a great tripThank you,Larry Mac"
1150983,SeulAreaWalleye,2009-11-30 11:12:00,100,"In my opinion, a lodge owner(or staff member) should be available 24/7 year round to answer any of your questions. If not possible, all messages should be returned promptly. This is the best way to show a strong desire, and respect for your business. Waiting until the new year to stay in touch with your clients could negatively impact your lodge overall. Many of my trips are set in stone at this time for the following year.I am certain that someone will get back to you soon.Good Luck"
1151054,keek,2009-11-30 15:28:00,1003,Thanks for the insight guys. The lodge I'm trying to book with seems very respectble from the research that I've done. And many on WC have had good experiences from the things they have written. I'll give it some more time. Mean while it's back to drooling over the fishing catalogs and maps on the lodge's website
1151112,Guest,2009-11-30 18:31:00,0,I always figure their response time to returning calls or emails is how they will take care of a problem or issue with your trip should it arise. Remember not getting back to customers in the lodge business means loosing money.
1151616,Bigfishhunter,2009-12-03 06:44:00,803,"Remember that this time of year is the only down time that they see. I managed a lodge for 6 years. We started baiting bears while the ice was still on the lakes with quads and snowmobiles in april. Then began making sure our equipment was all ready. Many many trips made between Winnipeg and Flin Flon Hauling gear and Groceries etc. Then it is about getting the water systems going and the facilities in top working condition and usually first guests arriving in May. We giv'er all summer long fishig and hunting till the end of October without ever taking a break. November is equipment maintenance and inventory time as well as ordering new stuff. By this time us hunters have already missed the archery and muzzel deer so we hit the rifle season. Then we head back up north to hunt late season moose for ourselves. Then we celebrate Christmas. Right after new years the sports shows start and we make sure everyone is available for everyone 24/7. We really only get the month of december (remember we don't get time, not even weekends in the summer) so we really enjoy the he!! out of December. Usually we have a girl in the office, but in the early days it was hard to find someone dedicated enough. I agree that there should be someone to answer questions at almost all times, but it doesn't need to be the owner or manager. That is how families get broken up - Trust me."

However, I have to disagree with GoldenEagle and Bigfishhunter â€¦First and foremost -- there is no excuse for not returning a person's phone call or email inquiry fairly quickly. If the main contact/owner isn't available (for whatever reason) then he should at least have a backup in place to answer questions (e.g. wife/son/daughter/co-owner/manager/anyone). If no backup exists, then that should tell you something. Second -- in today's economic climate, ANY ""new"" inquiry should receive a quick response if they really want your business.In my opinion -- bottom line is: if you haven't heard back from them in a reasonable period of time (e.g. a week), then move on and find another place to go.Best Wishes & Good Luck in your search,81Saluki"
1152070,BenBeattie,2009-12-04 18:01:00,232,I couldn't agree more! Time to find a lodge that is willing to earn your business.
