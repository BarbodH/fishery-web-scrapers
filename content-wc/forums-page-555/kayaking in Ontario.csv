The guys and one of my daughters are die hard fisherman. We are going to bring up a couple boats and I am thinking of throwing in a couple of the kids Kayaks so they can paddle around the bay we are staying on. My question is whether this is something that is going to get me in hot water at the border or with the OPP or MNR when the kids are on the water. Our kids all know the rules about the kayaks and PFDs and it is habit for them and the niece and nephew will get the safetry lecture from me and I am sure SIs will make it clear that no PFD no kayak. What I am mostly concerned about is knowing whether additional permits or licensing are required and any other regulatory or safety stuff that comes into play with using a kayak. Thanks"
