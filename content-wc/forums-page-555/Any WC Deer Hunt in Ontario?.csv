1151325,I Fish GS,2009-12-01 18:49:00,290,"Any WC Deer Hunt in Ontario? How Was it this year. This is the first time I haven't deer hunted in Ont in 18 years. To busy with farm work with late fall. I was up there last week for grouse, lots of grouse Brian"
1151947,Fonzie,2009-12-04 12:17:00,85,"My buddy from work just got back from the Eagle Lake area, {where he has some property}. He passed on a few smallish bucks and came back empty handed."
1152067,Skywagon,2009-12-04 17:55:00,1106,"I am not exactly sure what happened, but in my little section of N-W Ontario, the deer and moose just dissapeared this fall (except from town). On my property where I had deer tracks all over last year, I only found one set in fresh snow two days ago and that was covering a lot of area. There seems to be a lot more wolf tracks and sitings than usual. I am blaming the predators, the four legged and the non-working two legged ones that drive the roads and shoot from their pickups."
1152080,Fonzie,2009-12-04 18:38:00,85,"You could be correct. My friend said on one day, he was perfectly situated in the woods and was surprised by 3 very large wolves that loped by. He's thinking of hunting a wolf next time..."
1152136,I Fish GS,2009-12-04 22:14:00,290,"I agree with the amount of wolves I wish they would get rid of the wolf tag and put them back under small game. It was nice to be up there last weekend when non resident season was closed. Saw 3 to 4 local hunters the way it was 15 years ago, The hunting pressure has really gone up the last 5 years. Hope to get back up there over new years for trout."
1152155,Bill Krejca,2009-12-05 05:35:00,6107,"I realize it isn't the north woods, but come on over to Iowa and harvest some of ours. In places, they are in the nuisance category. Bill Krejca"
1152172,Skywagon,2009-12-05 07:00:00,1106,"I think it is getting to the same point as when they stopped the spring bear hunt and bear numbers started increasing. Bears are hard on calf moose, as well as a nuisance to home owners. Though people attacks are few by wolves, that is always on your mind, if they get the deer herd thinned out, it might be more of a concern. My wife saw a single wolf, while running a couple of weeks ago and said it did not seemed overly concerned seeing her. I suspect/know that the ""you don't kiss and tell"" theory will hold true for wolves, as it has for bears. On a side note, you might be interested in checking out the Utube video done recently on the monster wolf tracks found near Dryden (I think you can google Dryden wolf tracks to find it). The narrator is hokey, but it is interesting to see the size of those foot prints."
1152179,dewyg,2009-12-05 07:38:00,1006,"I went out the other day and walked and prodably 6-7 miles seen very few tracks and the ones that i did see had wolf tracks with them. I believe that the deer population has dropped drastically in NW Ontario. I agree with the increased hunting pressure theory, both from wolves and human alike. The tag system needs to be addressed."
