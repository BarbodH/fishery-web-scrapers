1148766,Guest,2009-11-18 12:37:00,0,"I was up there June 6th thru the 12th in 2009. Smallies were non-existent and the bite was very light. If you are looking for smallies, I would not reccomend this body of water. I stayed at Thunderbird. Good;Clean;Simple camp."
1149202,fishman10,2009-11-20 09:43:00,226,"i live in thunder bay and fish lac a lot. there are smallies in the lake and there are more and more every year, but i wouldnt go there to target them. the main fishery is walleye and smallies are caught while fishing for them. the slot size has helped tremendously in our area. when the slot first came in, the locals were very mad. now after several years, no one is *****ing after seeing what has happened to the fishery. i am sure you will have a great time fishing lac."
1149349,Guest,2009-11-21 08:53:00,0,I too fish Lac a lot and feel the MNR policy on smallies is all wrong. The smallie is not native to these walleye lakes and should be seriosly looked at. I would like to see agressive fish management for these species on our premier walleye lakes like lac.
1149466,Planocat,2009-11-22 04:50:00,473,"Been going to LDML for 25 yrs and stay at Pine Point from mid-June through July 4th. Agree with fishman10 that there are better Smallie destinations, but they are increasing rapidly and there are areas of the lake where you can have a blast fishing for them. Used to be you would catch an occassional smallie in Baril Bay, but now they are pretty much everywhere. Walleye fishing has become much better quality wise but it's still fishing......... some great days, some not so great days. Fortunately, more of the former. There's now a mapping chip for the lake from Navionics that you might want to consider as it will keep you out of trouble with the rocks. Here's a link for the lake that will get active after the 1st of the year. You can learn alot from reading past posts.http://www.lake-link.com/fishreports...ThreadID=41004"
1150466,Guest,2009-11-26 19:10:00,0,The walleye fishery in Lac has been chugging along and continues to produce great numbers of walleye. The lake is heavily fished but still offers phenomenal opportunities. In terms of the impacts of smallmouth on the walleye population there are no indications that the smallmouth have impacted the walleye negatively at this time. I would highly recommend looking into the science behind walleye and smallmouth interaction before making statements on potential negative impacts of bass on walleye. Most literature indicates that smallmouth will only have an impact on walleye fisheries that are already exploited (collapsed) from overharvest. As a predatory fish the smallmouth bass fill a niche in the food chain and can hinder the rehabilitation of walleye as they tend to be more aggressive and prolific. The key message here is that the anglers who overharvest the walleye are the problem. Another interesting fact to 'Limeterr' is that the majority of walleye populations throughout the Thunder Bay District are introduced much like our smallmouth populations so a piece of advice. Save your negative comments and don't bother typing misleading information to potential guests in Ontario unless you do your research and consult science/ literature.
1150474,Davis Viehbeck,2009-11-26 19:25:00,48,"Lac des Mille Lacs is a fantastic walleye fishery. It gets fished fairly heavily by residents of Thunder Bay until about late June but beyond that, the boat traffic really drops down. The Navionics chip is worth the investment in my opinion. I fish the lake about 20 days per year and love the central part of the lake (Open Bay/ Pine Point) anytime after late June. Its pretty tough to beat Sawmill Bay and surrounding area up until mid June but use extreme caution when running through this part of the lake. Just to refresh your memory, the lake is shoal ridden with most being unmarked so take your time until you set a few good tracks. If you have specific questions you can PM me or email me at [email protected] Have a great trip, Davis Viehbeck"
1150510,Guest,2009-11-27 05:53:00,0,Thanks for the suggestion to look at the interaction between the species. A lot of studies I found are considered inconclusive and unknown or requires further study. Some showed no real interaction or real predation. There is a well known interaction on largemouths and predation on walleye. The volume of Smallmouth are a new variable in the lake and something that myself and a lot of other walleye fisherman that I know are extremely suspicious of. I would also be interested in OMNR publishing scientific data in a language we understand in the form of a news release to better educate fisherman on this Perhaps guest the you could provide us a link to our good readers here to further educate us.
1150545,Guest,2009-11-27 10:41:00,0,"Interesting facts guest. So what you're saying is that smallmouth only have an impact on walleye if we take too many walleye. What happens to the interaction between the species if we have several years of poor spawn or water levels that influence the spawn which has happened at Lac and lots of other NW Ontario lakes. My understanding is that in the past Lac had more issues with water management influencing walleyes than anything else. This water management issues at the spawn being ""corrected"" and lower limits brought it back. Several years of drought could have a huge impact on this fishery and with an increasing smallie population could make this a double impact. Fisheries is not an exact science. The bottom line is that smallmouth are on the increase and walleye fisherman are concerned about it. I too would like to see studies done on this."
