1154307,Golden Eagle,2009-12-15 07:33:00,2642,"How do I buy one of those ""jointed beauty"" lures? Is there a website?"
1154311,scotttheguide,2009-12-15 07:56:00,73,"Poes Jackpots. White & Chart. and of course Perch color. Some top waters they just come up and surface behind them and grab em. The Jackpots, they explode on it and strike it very violently. It's fun as....."
1154357,AllenW,2009-12-15 10:57:00,11482,"Black Suick, green and yellow Reef Hawg, and running bucktails across the surface, I had a few of them made with larger blades so they stay on the surface easier to keep on top of the water that way and more flash.I've also had good luck running big spoons like a daredevil or 5 of diamonds across the surface.I've trolled with any of these and had luck with them.Usually near shorelines where there's weeds and deep water, or where a creek/river enters a lake that time of the year.Never had much luck with hitting deep water with top water baits, usually use something like a Bang-o-b to get down into deeper waterAl"
1154361,orchard frank,2009-12-15 11:13:00,1900,"I've had some great days using a Super Shad Rap as a ""surface"" lure, retrieved slowly enough to keep it on or just slightly below the surface, leaving a wake. Little jerks will pull it under a little, but it is buoyant enough to pop right back up. Over weed beds, rocks, and when you get to the edge, can crank it down for the rest of the way in. Firetiger has been best for me in Canada, also the silver or gold. Agree with the other posts on Suicks, etc."
1154425,Bigfishhunter,2009-12-15 17:05:00,803,"Orchard Frank, where did you learn that trick? That is one of my all time favs as well. In my opinion it is the best wake bait. Keep rod tip at about 10:00-11:00. and just rell slowly."
1154611,Nimstug,2009-12-16 18:05:00,2605,Thanks for all the suggestions and presentation ideas.
1154633,Bigfishhunter,2009-12-16 19:47:00,803,"Some topwaters that I use on a regular basis are: -Heddon Super Spook -Suick, but I don't use it as a topwater too much, I like the weighted version to stay about a foot under the surface. -Rapala Super Shad Rap (as previously stated) -Rapala Skitter walk (5 inch saltwater version) - Some big huge popper my wife got for me in Ireland. -Buchertail Topraider. I have more that I want to buy, but those are the ones that I use right now, I do pretty well with them. It is such a blast."
1154637,pike50plus,2009-12-16 20:37:00,584,"Barney spoon can be walked on top , deadly! My 2 top favorites Dadevela also makes a buzzer type spoon that works well I like using mono with topwater since letting them have it is a slow set and line give technique, imho."
1154792,Bigfishhunter,2009-12-17 16:14:00,803,"Instead of a wire/titanium/steel leader I have pretty much switched to Fluorocarbon Leader material, I find that when the bite is tough, I do better with my counterparts using titanium leaders."
1154166,Nimstug,2009-12-14 14:19:00,2605,"Hi,What are your favorite, most effective topwater lures for pike? Looking for something that would be work say in the first 10 days of September with probable water temperatures in the low '60's. How deep of water can you run them and bring up? Water visibility is about 5', maybe a little more.Thanks,NimstugMany men go fishing all their lives without knowing it is not fish they are after."
1154168,Esoxchaser,2009-12-14 14:23:00,1576,"Bass Buzzbaits, Smithwick Devils Horses, best of all, poppers on a fly rod will bring them up, spring or fall is best with water temps 50-70."
1154180,Golden Eagle,2009-12-14 15:01:00,2642,Suicks have been awfully good to me from May 20 to early October.
1154212,fishncamp,2009-12-14 17:04:00,49,Work a weed edge with a Poe Jackpot.....one of my faves.
1154224,Bill Krejca,2009-12-14 17:57:00,6107,"Without question, a Heddon Lucky 13, color being caster's choice. Pulled slowly, it will snake through weeds with hardly a hang-up. Pull just fast enough to get the back end to just wiggle-break the surface. Stop occasionally, rest, give a jerk or 2, and hang on. Cons are having to unhook the 3 trebles and losing time taking off muskies! Bill Krejca"
1154246,5richards,2009-12-14 19:30:00,131,My favorite is any 8 -!0 inch plus floating plug in a walleye color -- cast out -- let sit for 3 to 5 minutes and then jerk and let sit and repeat -- unbelievable action -- need patience tho'
1154249,Golden Eagle,2009-12-14 19:40:00,2642,"Mr. 5richards, the pike lake you frequent also has a lot of whitefish for pike to feed on. For that reason I use a Suick with a white belly to go along with my walleye and perch colors. And I use a black and a bright orange. I agree working them slowly is the key. Big pike will hit a Suick that sits still for a couple of minutes or more. Don't need to wear myself out when working a Suick. Did you ever notice that dead bait fishermen have pike teeth marks on their huge bobbers? And they continue to soak dead bait when huge pike are wanting better action like hitting a moving stick bait."
1154288,lobo1,2009-12-15 03:37:00,734,sure is exciting watching those gators knock a suick allover the place!! another one I use is made by Mister Twister - called a Top Prop - they dont make any more like mine - which has a buck tail on it - hard to beat worked over the weeds - thru the reeds etc. I have had to retie the buck tail several times.
1154296,5richards,2009-12-15 06:28:00,131,You're right Golden Eagle - They absolutely explode on the surface -- it's really fun to watch A good friend of mine makes Striper Lures and I had him make me 6 or 8 lures in colors I requested -- one was a jointed beauty in the Walleye color with a movement you wouldn't believe -- They tore it up --
1154299,Hawker,2009-12-15 06:43:00,3967,"My all time favorite is a Rebel Magnum Pop-R in either red/white or blue/chrome! I work these hard & fast throwing as much water as I can make them throw. The deep cupped face of the bait really moves some water, and worked as violently as they can be worked really pulls the pike from deep water or from way off the side in shallower water. Explosive strikes almost everytime and yeah, you do have to weed thru a muskie every now and then, darn the luck!!"
