The food is outstanding the camp is clean & well perserved. If you want to drive in without cooking bringing towels,boat etc. it is among the best. As for the fishing you can catch fish almost anywhere in Perrault lake, Bass fishing is outstanding, along with a good population of Walleye & Pike, there is also Musky. Windy days you can run along the shore lines back to camp. The upgraded larger boats are nice I think it is wonderful that some camps offer the upgraded boats at a fair price. I have rented & also brought my own boat. Any boat owner will tell you its way cheaper to rent than own. If you find the fishing tough higher a Guide they know how to catch fish & will teach you whats working."

1146824,trapper_john,2009-11-06 18:04:00,83,"I've stayed a Kingfisher many times. First couple of times not so good. New owners a few years back are super. Camp is clean, comfortable and the fishing has been good. Not so much for big pike, though a few are taken. Walleye, SM Bass and jumbo perch has been good. Matter of fact there will be four cabins of us going up the first of July. Good people there and a good camp."
1146878,teddi,2009-11-07 05:43:00,349,good camp to stay in but a poor lake to fish.
1147055,Kevin R,2009-11-08 16:11:00,305,Yes. Nice layout in a calm bay. Owners are friendly & helpful.

Is this due to past fishing success' or lack thereof, because it seems in the last several years that folks have been just hammering the fish on this lake. I know that before the stricter limits that even walleye factories such as Lac Seul were not producing as well as they once did, or do now."

The first thing they asked me was do I want to upgrade to a larger boat, an 18' with 40 hp motor. I wondered why, but soon found out. 99% of the fishing is on the east side or southeast, if a storm comes up it is very hard to get back to camp, as Perrault Lake in general is like a big bowl, I had to put to shore twice and wait out a storm, it gets rough very fast. Fishing= Walleye-poor, Smallmouth-fair, Muskie poor to fair. Consider fishing Wabaskang right across 105. Many good camps and average fishing for walleye, perch and northern. Good Luck Hunter 1943"
1148360,Steve of Madison,2009-11-16 15:04:00,230,"OR just go about 5 miles further up the road and stay at any of the really great camps on Lac Seul, ie. Scout Lake, Onaway, Fishermans cove. I have stayed at Onaway the last 10 years, great location, great facilities, fantastic owners and the best fishing in the area. Why settle for less?"
1148411,elkman99,2009-11-16 19:00:00,180,"most of my fishing will be for musky, so that kind of takes the west side of Lac Seul out of the equation. But you are correct, Lac Seul is a great walleye fishery."
1148481,lonewolf73,2009-11-17 07:15:00,17,"Elkman, I would take a look at Cedar Lake just to the south of Perrault. We have seen some huge muskies while walleye fishing. The size limit on Cedar is 54"" and it's being managed as a trophy lake. Check out the website for Cedar Lake Lodge. There are numerous pictures of some large muskies caught over the past couple of years. There was also a show filmed by Bob Mesikomer filmed there last year. You should be able to find it on YouTube. Good luck!"
1148484,Glenman12,2009-11-17 07:24:00,762,I agree with Lonewolf on Cedar Lake Lodge..I have been going there for 25 years..you cant beat it for muskies..while I dont fish them I have caught two in the upper 40's while trolling for walleyes..one guy in our group does fish them and has caught 6 over 50 in his 8 years of fishing there..here is the website for Cedar Lake Lodgewww.sportfishin.com/
