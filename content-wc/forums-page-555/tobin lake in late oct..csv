1126538,bardfromedson,2009-08-05 10:44:00,7,thanks for all the help so far.(some of you anyway) just wondering what the norm is for trolling speed? do you pull cranks only upstream or both up and down? are you trying to get them right close to bottom or are you keeping them suspended? does anyone use planer boards or are they not needed?
1126773,Guest,2009-08-06 07:40:00,0,We usually pull upstream only...speed depends on current...sometimes the **** is open and there is pretty good current to slow you down....other times almost no flow. I usually try to keep them on bottom or close. I don't use planer boards but normally only two people in the boat so no need. Clarkie
1126792,Dave Q,2009-08-06 08:37:00,1003,I like to run them so you get the odd bottom tick (or slam) speed we like is 1.4 to 2.2 .....if you troll all day and have a day were you get nothing....you may have been doing everything right....thats the river....might be on tomorrow.....or not lol. good luck

Beautiful sunny day with not much wind. Boated 5 walleye over 10 pounds and about 30 fish in the boat for the day! Only boat out there."
1152022,Arkansas Dave,2009-12-04 16:09:00,56,"Pikeman, glad to see all those fishing lessons Candle and I gave you in October paid off!"
1152974,Pikeman(SK),2009-12-08 17:50:00,6,"Hey Dave!Good to hear from you! Yes, i finally put all your advice and coaching into action. I have to go out and practice because next year that lucky nickel in staying here in Canada with me! The fishing actually steadily improved from the time you guys were here right up until freeze up about a week ago. Hope you can make it up here again next season!"
1124782,bardfromedson,2009-07-29 12:21:00,7,im heading to tobin in late october for the first time. im thinking of renting a cabin(don't know where) on the river since i want to do some night fishing. i was wondering what cranks i should stock up on before i come. i have a few deep tail dancers and reef runners but would like to stock up on what works. not sure of the size/ colors that work best.do they have a good supply in town? also are planer boards a must? also are big leeches tough to find in town? if so is there a good place to pick some up heading from the west? any help would be great. any other info or tips would be very helpful.
1124929,Guest,2009-07-29 23:09:00,0,"If you are going in late October and want to fish the lake, you might want to bring your auger"
1124939,mrwalleye5,2009-07-30 04:55:00,1922,"You shouldn't have a problem with that date, may get some cold days and for sure cool morinings but the water is soft for sure. Best time of the year for the biggies. Good Luck W5"
1125074,Guest,2009-07-30 13:33:00,0,Do not even try and go in Late Oct.
1125076,Guest,2009-07-30 13:38:00,0,You will not even get you boat in. Docks are out and the fishing is Poor. No one fishes that late. Because normally snow is on the ground and its hard to even get up the Hill. Thats what I have seen. There is no bait Available at that time. And unless you have Big stuff forget it. And its against the law to bring bait in. So plan on coming a lot earlier than Late Oct. latest I would say is the second week.You may get lucky on the weather but if you dont your Toast.
1125367,bardfromedson,2009-07-31 12:44:00,7,by late october i mean the 16-20th. the big derby is the first weekend so i didn't want to go that weekend. its the only time i can get away.
1125456,Gooch88,2009-07-31 18:58:00,58,"Ok Speaking from someone who lives in the province and has fished there many different times of the year...it's always a good place to go but we have had unusually harsh weather this year...crappy summer around hear usually means crappy fall...so I would try to come before Vanity Cup because even the weekend after fishing can stink from fishing pressure put on the river from 160 boats fishing for up to 5 days before the tournament and then the two days of the tournament...believe me I am already dreading having to dress like it's November during the tourney....so I would come that same type week in Sept if you can swing it...as for where to stay the launch at the park is less than 5 minutes from town so stay anywhere in town (Tobin Lake Motel...best choice)...you should bring cranks that hit the 20' mark and be prepared to loose lots of tackle as there is tonnes of dead fall hanging around the bottom and snags are frequent...live rigging (lindy rigging) with leeches works well in the fall...you could also pull spinners on BB but you will have to drift with the currrent to do that and depending on the flow when you are there you will be moving fast on the surface but will have trouble keeping a blade spinning unless it's small and or the paper type like the ""smile blades""...anyway good luck...good fishing and GO IN SEPTEMBER!"
1125880,hangneyes,2009-08-02 19:59:00,25,"i am heading up there the last week of october. we have been up there the last 3 years, around the same time and i think the later is better as far as the big fish, and the ramps are not as crowded. we use a lot of bomber 25A, deep thundersticks, and manns 20+."
1126025,Guest,2009-08-03 13:07:00,0,"We usually go the week of Canadian Thanksgiving....weather is questionable....sometimes sweatshirts all day...sometimes can't wear enough clothes.....no worry about ice on the river.....comeon guys, give the guy a break! LOL We pull big reef runners...gotta gem them down to that 18-22ft mark. Leeches are tough to find in town. Bigger the better though. Good luck....thats when the biggies are out there."
1126268,Dave Q,2009-08-04 10:38:00,1003,"I live about 3 hrs away, my whole 45 yr's. You will NOT have ice. It WILL be cold, how cold, should be above freezing during the day and may go below freezing at night. You will not find any leaches. There is a good chance the docks will be out, but that dosen't stop you from launching. Fishing on the river is EASY,note I did not say good fishing, the river is VERY spotty, its a trollers dream very very few snags in the river. (The lake is a snag fest, full of wood.) Drifting can be good. fishing is usually better if the current is running...you never know if the current will be running or not or when or for how long. We like to pull cranks in 16 to 2o+ ft. If you want BIG pike drive up to tobin lake lodge and they will tell you what you need to know.(dead bait for pike that time of year.) Hope that helps. I have fished as late as Nov.11th. a rare year."
