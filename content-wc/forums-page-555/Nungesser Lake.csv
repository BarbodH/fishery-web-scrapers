1108606,bartfire,2009-05-27 19:33:00,9,I will add that NLL's portage is a bunch easier than the other camps
1108649,steve03,2009-05-27 21:54:00,22,I was just wondering how the opening week went?
1151847,Guest,2009-12-04 01:38:00,0,"Hello everyone, I am the president of fish tales and we do a fly in to Big Hook every other year. We are looking for info on Nungesser Lk. for the odd years so more members can attend that dont fly. We are looking into Anglers Kingdom and looking for information on time of year etc for fishing this body of water. All information is helpful. thanks Chuck Cook - Prsident of Fish Tales Fishing Club, Chicago area south, Thanks Chuck"
1152665,tparker,2009-12-07 11:49:00,100,"Chuck, I have been to Nungesser Lake for a week each of the past two summers. Mid-June in '08, and early July in '09. Stayed at Birchpoint Camp and had two great experiences. Fishing was very similar both times, although the weather was completely different. Cold and rainy this year. We mainly pitched a jig and minnow off wind-blown points, or back-trolled spinner rigs with minnows and caught lots of walleye. I believe this is a great walleye lake, pretty easy to fish. The pike are there also, we just didn't fish for them. Both years we had numerous pike trying to take walleye away from us boatside. Quite a sight. We actually landed a few mid-30 inch pike that swallowed our hooked walleye and wouldn't let go. I think your group would have a great time fishing Nungesser Lake."
1153126,Guest,2009-12-09 10:49:00,0,"For Steve I just read this thread and your post. I know it's a bit late but here is a report on how the first week went. The week started with over a foot of snow. ?!?!!!! Even with the cold weather Big Pike were caught each day. Jay Brooks caught his biggest pike ever, a giant 47 inch beauty took a dead bait presentation just 20 minutes into his fishing trip. My legs were shaking, what a fish, the fish of a lifetime. said Jay. However the next day jay caught another 47 inch pike. It would have been his biggest ever if he hadn't caught his biggest ever the day before. Actually Jay had caught a bigger pike just 5 minutes into his day of fishing with me on his first trip to Anglers Kingdom two years ago. Jay has learned the secret to catch truly giant pike. Patience. I can remember when Jay would come back to camp and tell me he'd fished here and here and here and you get the idea. I told Jay what I've told literally thousands of anglers over the years. Rule number one, go where the fish are. And then fish for big fish. FISH FOR BIG FISH This sounds like a simple statement but it is critical in your success if what you want is a giant pike. What I mean by this is don't just run into a spot, slosh around in the shallow weeds and chase out a few little hammer handles, then head to the next spot. Set up where the big fish are and wait them out. Sometimes it takes 10-20 minutes sometimes it takes several hours or even days. There is one gentleman who has been fishing Nungesser long before I built Anglers Kingdom. He has always stayed at another lodge but we get a chance to chat now and then. He knows exactly what I'm talking about. He has a few favourite spots and he waits for the big girls to show up. And he has caught a lot of truly giant pike. It would take quite a bit of space to describe all the potential places that hold giant pike. When guests are at camp I sit with them and point out spots on the map. I draw little detailed diagrams of the exact spot where I feel they will find what they want. Sometimes I'll just take them to the spot. I also guide as much as possible but it seems like I have less and less time for that. I recall a guest back in 2006 who told me all he wanted was one giant pike. I set him up on a spot and by the end of the third day he had a 49 inch pike. He told me it was well worth the wait. He had been fishing Canada for over 30 years so 3 days was a short wait for the biggest fish of his life. In August it took just 5 minutes for Roger Dahlager to catch the biggest pike of his 25 year quest for a Giant pike. So you never know, just put the odds in your favour. Sorry I'm wandering. . The first week of 09 was remarkably good considering the major snow fall and cold front it started with. We were catching big walleye and big Pike. The big walleye were even more surprising as many of them hadn't spawned yet. Rick Puig and his son were up for his first time ever fishing walleye or pike. They both landed walleye over 28 inches and pike over 38 inches. I think they are Hooked. The second week was more of the same. The warming water got the Pike more active and they started hitting stick baits worked slowly. Larry Siebenthal and his son caught about 20 big pike, biggest was 44. They had several doubles which says a lot for their prowess. They are musky fisherman and have the patience needed to make it happen. I drew out one of those little diagrams of about 5 spots and they worked those 5 all week. Sometimes one or two a day, some days all 5. On the days they fished all 5 they caught less fish. That is a common thread I've found on any lake any time of year. Ted Beran and the guys were back again. Lynn Anderson couldn't make it and we all hope is doing well. Lynn is the gentleman that carved the big pike for us. Teds group did well, had some doubles on big pike. Mike Fliss reported catching 30 walleye over 30 inches. All I can say is WOW. by the first of June the monsoon started and the rest of the summer was rain rain and more rain. surprisingly the fishing was well above average. Maybe it is because people weren't moving around as much??? thats it for now. thanks"
1153231,Fonzie,2009-12-09 17:26:00,85,I agree 100% Kevin! I can't wait to visit your resort.-Glenn J.
1153252,Golden Eagle,2009-12-09 19:26:00,2642,I believe that Mike Fliss reported catching 30 walleye over 30 inches. Double WOW from me. I know Mike Fliss.I also know Nungesser Lake. It's great for walleye and pike.
1100362,steve03,2009-04-26 21:12:00,22,"Hi, I was just wondering what the ice conditions were and if someone could keep me updated?"
1100383,Whopper,2009-04-27 05:52:00,340,"Steve unless Kevin Geary from Anglers Kingdom responds take a peek at Enids blog for ice out condition in the Red Lake areahttp://viking-island.blogspot.com/ I'm fishing the next lake down stream on May 15th, can't wait"
1100975,Guest,2009-04-29 06:07:00,0,"i was at the lake on monday april 27 . lots of holes, ice is coming away from the shoreline in places. if we receive some hot weather soon with some wind, iam sure in 1-1-1/2 weeks it will be gone. doug from nungesser lake lodge."

1104789,Guest,2009-05-13 15:44:00,0,I will be up the first week of june first time fishing this lake . Any tips would help a lot.how is the pike and walleye fishing at this time ? Does deadbait work on the pike ? Is it a jig and minnow walleye bite or can you use crank baits? Dont have much time please help me out. Thanks pimpman
1104911,tparker,2009-05-14 07:13:00,100,"Pimpman, Fished Nungesser the 3rd week of June last year out of BirchPoint Camp. Ist time on the lake. Mainly fished wind blown points with jig and minnow and caught tons of walleye. Back-trolled a bit with spinner rigs and caught them that way also. Didn't fish for pike much but had numerous pike trying to take walleye boatside. Landed a 10 pounder this way as he swallowed the walleye so fast he couldn't let go. You'll do great."
1107503,Guest,2009-05-23 16:45:00,0,"Thanks for the info tparker, ANYONE ELSE OUT THERE HAVE ANY INFO? I leave on thurs. Please any help would make it a little easier for this first timer to this lake. Any pke info guys?"
1108515,Guest,2009-05-27 14:12:00,0,Help leaveing thurs.am any tips or tricks that will help me out . I need some pike tips for this lake. thanks pimpman
1108572,bartfire,2009-05-27 17:39:00,9,"Pimpman, Our group has been going to Canada for 35 yrs, and the last 10 we have settled in on Nungesser, what a wonderful lake. The above patterns and ideas for walleye are all right on base. We don't have to go out of camps sight to catch many and huge walleye. As for Pike, we don't mess with it to much, but this link to Kevin Geary's site on the lake should be a help. I do know he watches this thread at times, but he is probably pretty busy right now. Good luck,we will be there June 12, so please leave a few for ushttp://www.anglerskingdom.com/"
1108590,Larry Mac,2009-05-27 18:49:00,530,"Hi Mr. Bartfire, I have been very interested in this lake. Where do you stay? I have friends that stayed at Anglers Kingdom and absolutely loved it. Thank you,Larry Mac"
