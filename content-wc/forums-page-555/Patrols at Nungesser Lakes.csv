We do not drink a lot while fishing but we like it for shore lunches or just because. I go in early in 2010, would just like to know to do or not to do."
1153058,tparker,2009-12-09 06:42:00,100,"Spent a week on this lake each of the past two summers. Never got checked, never saw anyone get checked. Had our fish limits checked on the road out, but never got checked while on the lake."
1153093,AllenW,2009-12-09 08:27:00,11482,"Its easy, consider the penalty of getting caught and if its worth it.While odds of getting stopped may be slim, you may run into that officer who has no sense of humor, personally I'd think about waiting till ya got back to you cabin.Al"
1153118,Larry Mac,2009-12-09 10:05:00,530,"Hello IRISHATTACK, I must agree will AllenW on this one. I have never fished Nungesser Lake but two years ago was fishing a very, very remote lake, no roads and two portages to get to, out of the clear blue before we knew it were two MNR Officers motoring up to us. I have been fishing remote lakes in Canada for many years and this was the first time this happened but I will say they were very professional but also very serious. They checked everything and I mean everything. We were legal but there would have been no way to try to hide anything. I am sure they have seen and heard it all before. The risk/reward just is not there for us. Have a great trip.Thank you,Larry Mac"
