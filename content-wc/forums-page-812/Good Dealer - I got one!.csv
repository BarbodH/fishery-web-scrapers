I ordered a new boat the 4th of February, still have not received it because of the engine or lack thereof. Ernie Wright from Lakeside Marine at Red Lake, Ont. took it upon himself to make some phonecalls and try to break up the logjam. This was not a solicited request. I am absolutly amazed that there is still that kind of loyalty to a former customer. I did not order the new boat from Lakeside because they are not a dealer for that particular boat. Should you ever be in that area and need repairs or a new rig for that matter, I would HIGHLY recommend Lakeside. A Big Thank You to Ernie and crew and also Evergreen Lodge who made him aware of the problem."

Ernie and his crew had one going the same day and the other by the next mourning, and on a third occasion we couldn't get another motor running, so Mike at Weaver's called Ernie and within a few hours one of his guys showed up at the dock and within ten minutes found a loose wire and the way we went. I find it ironic that Ernie's son, Lee, now owns the former Weaver's wilderness camp (now Wright's Wilderness Camp). If Lee is anything like his father I am sure he will be very successful at his new endeavor. Lakeside Marine could sure show some businesses here in the states something about service!!."
