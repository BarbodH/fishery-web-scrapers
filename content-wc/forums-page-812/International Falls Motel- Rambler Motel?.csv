539925,BB,2004-05-25 13:05:00,15,Just made a reservation at the Rambler Motel. Anyone ever stay there? All I'm looking for is a fairly clean place to stay the night on my way to Canada. Price was right and no other places are open in I-Falls or Fort Frances.

They were either breaking up domestic disputes, tending to hooker/john complaints, or boat/gear thefts. Screaming, yelling, and flashing squad lights made it difficult to sleep. This happened 3 years in a row, so I finally had enough and started to stay elsewhere. I last stayed there about 6 years ago, so maybe it's changed. Now I'm either at the Holiday Inn at Int'l Falls or stopping short and staying at the American Inn(?) that's in Orr. More money, but how can you put a price on peace and quiet?"

We usually pull in about 10PM and leave by 5AM for the border. It's all you really need, and we've always had a clean room. Never had any trouble with things being stolen."
