If you drive through during normal business hours, there are places that sell bait along the route. By the way, where to?"

540299,Guest,2004-06-04 10:30:00,0,We arrive Sat June 26 so be sure to leave a few in the lake for us. My mind is already half way up the river to Clatouche. We'll expect a full report upon your return. We'll do likewise. Good luck.
