540300,JBfishdog,2004-06-04 10:40:00,9,"I could use some advise. Normally my group goes on a Spring ""Fish Trip"" in Quebec; normally to lakes around the Clova Road (O'Sullivan, Doda, Hebert, ect). This year we will be trying a fall trip. I'm looking for suggestions on places to go and what different fishing tactics we should use. We know what to do in spring just not sure what will be different Mid September. Thanks --- JBS"
