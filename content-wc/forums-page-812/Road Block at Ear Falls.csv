540216,Mark R,2004-06-02 13:24:00,1538,On 5/22 we were stopped about 10 miles south of Ear Falls. Radar set up as we made the turn our speed was OK but we were stopped anyway as the officer was looking for open containers. We don't drink on the way up and it's a good idea cause they were stopping everyone whether they were speeding or not. At least two parties in our camp recieved tickets.

They are fresh out of the acadamy and trying to impress the bosses so they can get transfered some where decent. A lot of them don't cut you any slack.
540249,czy42strokes,2004-06-03 05:33:00,419,Isn't the posted speed limit on that stretch from Dryden to Ear Falls 50 KM?
540253,Trailerguy,2004-06-03 06:28:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]No, Hwy 105 is posted 80 km. (50 mph) Hwy 17 is posted 90 km."

You can fudge a little, probably moreso on 17, but beware on 105. They love to back into little drives behind the trees and you don't see the car until you pass them."
540272,czy42strokes,2004-06-03 17:30:00,419,"Mistype on my part, I meant 50 mph. I have driven that stretch alot and it is just about the last leg of the trip. One week and I will be making the drive. Looking forward to this years trip."
