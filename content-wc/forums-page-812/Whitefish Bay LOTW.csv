We had the coldest May on record.As for the fish they are getting better.The back area of Snakebay should be good right now, its shallow and warm.The lake trout are in shallow water between 20-35ft, caught a couple last night in Log bay.The northern are on sand bars, shallow rocks and caught some in old reeds.As for smallies they where not great yet.Good luck.
