I have my first Canadian fishing trip coming up in mid-June to Esnagi Lake, north of Wawa, Ontario and I'm wondering if anyone could give me an idea of what to expect. Any advice on locations and the best presentations for walleye and pike this time of year would be appreciated. Thanks, Bruce bbwalleye Rockford, MI"

540095,fishnmagicin,2004-05-29 13:35:00,45,I live a few hours away from wawa and there are far better lakes than esnagi to catch walleyes and pike. How about some jumbo perch?
540110,rog,2004-05-30 06:55:00,15,"What lakes do you like, most of the walleyes in Esnagi are small. I would love to try some new lakes. Rog"
540113,Guest,2004-05-30 08:14:00,0,"I worked as a guide on Esnagi and the fishing is as good as any other fly in. we caught lots in the 5-10lb range and this winter ice fishing a friend of mine caught one 12 pounds. The pike fishing is also good, almost everyday I could catch one between 10 - 15 pounds if I targetted them. The perch fishing is good if you around beaver houses and weed beds."

If you don't mind sharing, what are some of your best spots for walleye and pike. I would tell you my favorites but I'm sure you already know them. Rog"
