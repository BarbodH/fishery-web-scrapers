539871,Guest,2004-05-24 09:59:00,0,We're heading up next weekend. Any reports? Water temp? Any info would be greatly appreciated.
539878,Guest,2004-05-24 13:37:00,0,"Sorry i can't be of more help, we're heading up there on June 4th. I have not talked to Wayne to hear wether the water level is up or down this year. Is this your first year up there or have you been going for a while? We normally are up there a week sooner, but we were bumped back a week this year. Last year we consistantly were catching walleyes in Kilvert, but it was sporatic on the main lake. Hopefully we won't have to go so far this year. Let me know, Steve"
539884,Guest,2004-05-24 14:31:00,0,"We've been going up for about 6-7 yrs now. We've done well the last three years. Last year there were three of us that went up a week later than this year. In 3-1/2 days of fishing we caught more fish over 20"" than we did under. Biggest was 29-3/4"" I'm guessing that we caught about 20-25 fish 25"" or bigger. We never ventured through the 2nd narrows. All our fishing was done on the resort side of these narrows. We've never done too well in the other part of the lake or kilvert, but that might be because we don't spend the time on the water there. Burn up too much gas going there."
539912,Guest,2004-05-25 08:10:00,0,"Swang, Our group has also been going up for a few years now. I personally believe the fishing is better in Kilvert than Dogtooth. Last year 90% of our big fish came from Kilvert. We have gone at different times of the year and are going last week in July this year. The only thing I do know is that you need to stay away from the mayfly hatch and fishing is pretty good. If you are interested in sharing any info leave your email in the post and I will get to you."
539924,Guest,2004-05-25 13:01:00,0,I'd be up for sharing some info. My address is [email protected].
539975,tjsker,2004-05-26 11:09:00,301,I'm going to be staying on Longbow in June and would like to try both Dogtooth and Kilvert. But where is Kilvert in relation to Dogtooth Lake? I can't seem to find any maps on the internet.
539983,Guest,2004-05-26 12:39:00,0,"Kilvert is connected to Dogtooth via a small, but navigable river."
540020,tjsker,2004-05-27 11:08:00,301,"From looking at a topo map, it looks like you get to Kilvert by entering Dogtooth on the south end and then go north about two miles and then east two miles to Kilvert. Is there a better way?"
540022,Guest,2004-05-27 12:06:00,0,"No, that is the only way in. It's not a very long boat ride. It just take stime going thru the river. Otherwise you are running full speed the rest of the way."
540192,Guest,2004-06-01 23:46:00,0,"Any other reports? I am headed up Saturday, June 5th. You can contact me at [email protected] if you would like to share/trade info about Dogtooth. I have been going there for about 5-6 years now. How are the roads from Fort Frances? How is the water level? Any input is much appreciated. The Sheriff"
