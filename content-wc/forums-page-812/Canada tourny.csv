540221,Guest,2004-06-02 15:16:00,0,"If I am reading the rules correctly, barbless hooks and no upgrading of fish? That does not sound like much fun. Are there any other special rules for Ridge?"
540223,Guest,2004-06-02 17:01:00,0,"Another rule, the fish have to be 55.5 cm long to be legal. That's just under 22 inches."
540240,cdnwalleye,2004-06-02 21:39:00,3,Its too bad a 22 inch eye wont even make the cut at this tournamnet. Nothing under 26 will go in my well. Its an awsome fishery that has been catch and realese up untill last year and now we can keep one over 55cm = just under 22inch which is the only reason there can be a tournament on the lake. With the pro/am format and the huge fish this is a great oportunity to put some masive weights on the board.I think it will seporate the men from the boys of walleye fishing around here when the regulars gotta fish with a different Am each day and not there good old buddy this will get some of the interested by standars out in a boat and catching some massive fish and hopefully off to the local boat shop and in all the tournaments next year. The more the maryer. I would have to bet that the Travers record weight of 63.5lbs with 10 fish will be broke big time at Ridge. The stupid Alberta barbless rule that was implamented with no scientific proof has not lost me any hogs at ridge yet this year. Looks to be a great tournament with lots of corporate support and its about time we got a pro/am format tournamet around here. Just make the 10000 dollar check out to Cdnwalleye cause thats my lake and im gonna WIN... See ya there Cdnwalleye.
