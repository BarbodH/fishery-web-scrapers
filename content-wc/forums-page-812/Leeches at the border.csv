540154,Guest,2004-05-31 20:20:00,0,"Don't know what way you are going after Emo but there is a nice bait shop in Nestor Falls called the Angeler's Edge. It's on the north of town. They have leeches, minnows and crawlers. We have bought them there for 10 years."
540156,Tyee Guy,2004-05-31 21:05:00,717,"Thanks, we are going to Clearwater/Pipestone, so will not be going that far north......Anyone else?????"
540224,Guest,2004-06-02 17:19:00,0,ttt
540234,Guest,2004-06-02 21:09:00,0,"Check out Witherspoons on the west end of Ft Francis. The are on the north side of the road. Should have a good supply of bait when you go thru. They also sell licenses and some tackle. Or I think the name of the place on the east end of Ft Francis is called Riverside Bait and Tackle (er something like that). They are more of a fisherman's stop. I was at Witherspoon's the first weekend of May and they were just starting to get ready for their live bait supplies for the season. Where you going on Pipestone? If it's Pipestone Lodge, say hi to Art for me. We fished Lake Trout in early May at his place. Guide07 (Lee)"
540236,Tyee Guy,2004-06-02 21:17:00,717,"Thanks guide..We will be staying at True North on Clearwater, but plan to go into Pipestone for some lake trout, then south to despair and footprint for walleyes...Chuck and Cathy have always been very good to us...Any tips on lakers????? Thanks in advance...."
540241,Guest,2004-06-02 21:42:00,0,No good laker tips from our boat. I think we were a bit early after the ice. Had to push thru one ice berg jam in the northwest arm. We were using the rapala family and a few flasher / dodger type deals. Most of what we graphed was 30-40 feet deep. Did boat a few surface hunters though for a fun fight. Good Luck 7
540257,Guest,2004-06-03 08:30:00,0,can you take leeches across the border?
540258,Reels,2004-06-03 08:42:00,2876,Nope <{{}}><
540284,Guest,2004-06-04 07:12:00,0,Is there a bait store in Rainy River or Morson?
