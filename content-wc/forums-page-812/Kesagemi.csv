540259,Sam,2004-06-03 09:15:00,16,I have been there four times and it gets better each time. Bring your rain gear. Even on sunny days you will get wet. The lake is almost always fairly rough. The shallow bays at the north end of the lake are the best pike spots. But are about a 40 minute ride. Walleye seem to be everywhere. Rocks or weeds. We caught as many throwing spinner baits for pike as we did jigging the rocks for them.
