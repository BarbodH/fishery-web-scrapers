540229,Atlanta Dave,2004-06-02 18:59:00,323,Help going next Friday the 11th need to get reports from somebody on the lake or flying over. All information appreciated . Thanks in advance Atlanta Dave
540247,pike nut,2004-06-03 05:06:00,23,"Dave, Looks like we are both screwed. I had to cancel the first four days at misaw which started June 15th. I re-booked for 8 days starting the 20th. That is also a risk as they still have over 4 feet of ice as of today. Keep your fingers crossed and let's hope. If you get a chance e-mail me at [email protected] as i would like to share something with you in private about a new trophy pike camp. thanks. Pike nut aka duffy"
540252,Atlanta Dave,2004-06-03 06:21:00,323,Another question if the lake is still all ice as of tues afternoon with 60 plus degree days forcast how much ice can met by the 11th? Thanks Atlanta Dave
540275,pike nut,2004-06-03 18:48:00,23,"Dave, You can't always believe internet weather reports for the north. Tuesday it was supposed to be 68 degrees in stony rapids according to weatherunderground.com however I spoke to the owner at misaw and he said his caretaker in camp that day told him it did not get above 34 that day and was zero at night. What they need is warm weather with lots of wind and rain. Warm temps and rain soften the ice and the wind creates waves to break it up. The problem is it may warm up during the day but if it gets below freezing at night it refreezes. Also, misaw had three feet of snow 8 days ago which insulated the ice from the warmer temps further delaying ice out. It's a bad spring. I e-maled your buddy with some info. that I asked him to forward to you becasue i don't have you e-mail. pike nut"
540281,Northern Manitoban,2004-06-04 00:12:00,195,With that much ice I would say your out of luck? Our ice here in the Northern part of Manitoba just came off we have had some weird weather and with low temps at night did not help things.You need these overnite temps to stay up to really help things out and of course some rain and wind also.Big trips next week for Lakers etc. and with the late thaw should be some incredible fishing in Northern Manitoba!

540285,Atlanta Dave,2004-06-04 07:16:00,323,Northern Manitobian How far north do you live? How warm have the temps been there in the last few days. The forcasts I am looking at say it is about 70 every day now at Lake Athabasca. If it is that warm will it get rid of most of the ice in a week? Thanks Atlanta Dave
540286,Atlanta Dave,2004-06-04 07:23:00,323,Pike nut I wouldnt take the forecasts as cut in stone on the internet but I find it hard to belive they say 70 for high and 45 for low and youre saying it is 34 and 0. Also how does an area tht is a arid as Athabasca get 3 feet of snow in a day? Just doesnt add up to me. I guess I am hoping you are incorrect. Atlanta Dave
540290,Northern Manitoban,2004-06-04 07:32:00,195,"Dave,I'm not as quite north as where you are going i'm almost 800 km north of Winnipeg Manitoba.Like I was saying our ice just came off the big lakes just a few days ago.Even with warm temps and that much ice still on Athabasca I would say atleast 10 days before your able to fish it maybe longer?your best bet is to see what the lodges say.As they will have people up there to give reports.I know how your feeling I have had to rebook time off as a few years ago ice wasn't off until second week in june and thats madning when you have had a trip planned for months.Good Luckhttp://www.xtremesportfishing.com"
540292,Atlanta Dave,2004-06-04 08:11:00,323,Northern Manitobian One other Question We had this same thing happen in 2002 how do you think this year compares with 2002?
540294,Northern Manitoban,2004-06-04 08:49:00,195,"Dave,this year is allot like 2002 thats the year myself I had to rebook one week later in june for my Lake trout trip up north here.That year our ice was not off until the 3rd of june.Seems the cold weather just seems to be wanting to hold on.Its warm here now but the next couple days the overnites are calling for possible frost?I should expect some great fishing next week where i'm going?"
