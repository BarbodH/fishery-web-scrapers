540025,Tyee Guy,2004-05-27 14:44:00,717,"There are 2 bedrooms with 2 bunkbeds in each, in the living room there is a couch that I have spent many a night on, and we have also had Jimmy bring in extra beds and place them on the porch depending on weather....there is a small 2-3 man cabin behind #1, I can't remember the #, but it could also be used......They will find a way, we have had as many as 16 in our group...."
540048,Tyee Guy,2004-05-27 22:54:00,717,My mistake.....Cabin #1 has 3 bedrooms with double bunks in each...
540057,Guest,2004-05-28 09:20:00,0,"Tyee Guy, thanks for the correction. I was wondering how we could get 11 guys in there. Now it makes more sense. When you say double bunks, I trust you mean sleeps 4 to a room. Also, you mentioned you have been there numerous times, what time of year do you (did you) go? Just wondering how deep we can expect to be fishing in mid-July? Thanks again for all you responses."
540058,Tyee Guy,2004-05-28 10:53:00,717,We usually go in the fall...Sept.....In July they will be anywhere between 20-45' depending on weather patterns.....Basil will know where to find them......
540239,Guest,2004-06-02 21:33:00,0,I fished with Shane on Pipestone Lake in the early 80's when Jim owned Pipestone Lodge. He is a fine fellow and quite a conversationalist.(big word) He knows fishing and resort ownership well. Does anyone know if he sold his place on Off Lake near Clearwater / Pipestone? Guide07
540242,orchard frank,2004-06-02 21:46:00,1900,"I have been there once or twice a year for the last 12 yrs, just got back today. Shane has been around the lodge off and on since it has opened, expect the same fine service as always. Great cabins, food,cleaning station,and docks, top notch in every way. Fishing is from good to unbelievable. Jigs, rigs, trolling all can work, Last week was tough weather, snow, sleet, wind, we still did good, caught some big ones trolling with boards along the shorelines. (first time I ever tried that, won't be the last) Definitely recommend a guide for a day or two, money well spent. Basel, Brad, and Allen are all working now. My guess is that this lodge has about 90% repeat business, not by accident. Good luck, tell the guys I'll bring the venison when I see them in Sept."
540263,Tyee Guy,2004-06-03 13:02:00,717,"Frank, Did Scotty come back this yeatr as a guide??? There was some question as to whether or not he would be back.........."
540276,Guest,2004-06-03 20:23:00,0,"hey, I know The owner VERY WELL, just bring some jigs and your tackle box, i would take i giude for a few days. yopu wont need to bring bait, its there for you at the lodge, it will be added on to your bill iti think? but for a giude i would reccomend Bazil, hope you enjoy"
540277,Guest,2004-06-03 20:26:00,0,"i wouldnt worry abou the new owner, its still in the Family, its his LITTLE BROTHER...And every thing is the same, for shane has worked with jimmy since his very first camp on pipestone lake ont."
540280,orchard frank,2004-06-03 22:24:00,1900,"Scotty is also still there.There were some huge Northerns caught last week 42 &43"". One evening there were a bunch of kids fishing from docks caught a bunch of nice walleyes, pike and whitefish. This is a place you will not go wrong with. We are going back in Sep. and have our reservations for 05. Send me an email through this site, I may have some maps I can send you. Good Luck"
539911,Guest,2004-05-25 08:07:00,0,"Our first trip to Lac Seul and will be staying at Lost Island Lodge in mid-July. Can anyone provide any info on what we can expect, cabins, fishing, etc. Will be fishing mostly walleye but would like to have some fun with the northerns. Should we bring crawlers, leeches or minnows for the eyes? Is it best to fish with jigs or use spinner rigs and how deep can we expect to be fishing? I know Lac Seul is a huge body of water, will we have to travel far to get to good fishing or is it good close by? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thanks"
539919,Guest,2004-05-25 12:04:00,0,"You should do really well with lindy's and spinners. It's a nice place, jimmy sold it about 6 weeks ago. Hopefully the new owners keep it just the way it is."
539920,Guest,2004-05-25 12:36:00,0,"We were at Lost Island in August a couple years ago. Lindy rigs and spinners both worked great for walleyes and smallies...leeches or crawlers. Off shore humps were the best for walleyes that time of year. We caught bigger walleyes and some good-sized northerns trolling crank baits over deep water near these humps, but only a few. My son caught a 14-pound northern casting from the dock using a silver Rattletrap. We lost count of how many northerns of all sizes that lure caught that week while casting toward shore or over weeds. The cabins are fine and the lodge is nice."
539936,Guest,2004-05-25 15:16:00,0,Thanks for the replies. I did not know that they have new owners. I probably should call them and confirm my reservation (I do have a deposit paid). Will we be fishing relatively close to the lodge or do we have to travel a distance?
539961,Guest,2004-05-26 08:57:00,0,"For anyone interested, I contacted the lodge this morning and spoke with the new owners - I found them to be extremely cordial. Also found out that the new owners are actually family members of Jims so the resort is staying in the family. Them seem genuinely interested in improving things which is what you want to hear when a resort has new ownership. Looking forward to a great trip."
539970,Guest,2004-05-26 10:12:00,0,We took a couple of long rides to recommended spots that were worth the trip. But there are lots of very good spots within a mile or two of the camp.
540013,Guest,2004-05-27 08:43:00,0,The new owner is actually Jimmy's brother Shane. He is a good guy and has been in the business for 30+ years. He'll take good care of you and make sure your happy.
540015,Guest,2004-05-27 09:05:00,0,"thanks for the replies. Have heard nothing but good things about the lodge, just hope the fishing is as good as the lodges reputation. We did book a guide for a couple of days so that should definitely help to make this a memorable trip. Anyone familiar with the cabins at the lodge? We are thinking about booking another trip next year but with about ten guys. Do they have a cabin big enough to accomodate that number? Thanks again."
540023,Tyee Guy,2004-05-27 12:19:00,717,"We have stayed there many times....For a large group cabin 1 will hold several, and they will no doubt give 2 cabins to accomodate your group.....You will likely get Basil as your guide, he's a great guy and worth his fee....say hi to him from Tom, Joe and Marc....Also look for the ""skeg trophy"" on the wall of the dining room, but Bas might get a little sensitive about it!!!!!!! Wish I was there...."
540024,Guest,2004-05-27 13:21:00,0,"thanks for the reply. I can see Cabin 1 from their website but doesn't give you a good picture on how big it is. I will be sure to say Hi for you. Can't wait, July will be here soon."
