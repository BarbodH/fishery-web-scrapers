514353,Guest,2001-08-08 14:19:00,0,"This isn't going to help you much, but I believe that some are and some aren't. I've run into this dilema before myself and have always found a way to get stocked up Saturday. You don't want that low beer stress. I came up in June and crossed the border on Sunday morning and called the Duty Free store at the border ahead of time. They do sell beer on Sunday's there, but they did't open soon enough for me so I bought it in the US and paid the duty. I believe the duty free store opens at 9am at Baudette. I'm not sure about International Falls. Hope this helps a little."

514355,Guest,2001-08-08 17:55:00,0,You can get beer at our beer stores and our liquor stores. Most are open on sundays. Low beer stress is a terrible thing. I've had it once or twice and I do my best not to bring it on again.
