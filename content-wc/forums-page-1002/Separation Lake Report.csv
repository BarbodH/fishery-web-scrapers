513936,DaveIN,2001-07-19 04:17:00,191,"There is a group from South Chicago there this week until the 22nd.Maybe if you ask next week, Rich will respond with a report."
513937,Guest,2001-07-19 13:18:00,0,"Hello,We were up to Separation Lake the End of June and fishing was great for walleyes, lots of 8 to 10 pounders. We camped really a nice campground, Barb is a peach. There is a really good guide up there his name is John 1-204-228-3339. We didn't have to go very far from camp either, had some problems with the smallmouth and Northerns but the water is 7 feet high so it was a little tough. I heard it is still high, waiting for the guys from Chicago to get back and give their report. We used just a plain hook, leech and a split shot a foot above the hook for the walleyes.Good LuckSharon[email protected]"
513938,Steve,2001-07-25 12:15:00,259,"Were back and the fishing was great, only one waleye over 8 lbs. but many 5,6,7lbs range. Smallmouth fishing was really good, many in the 4 to 5 pound range. The river was still about 7 feet high.The weather was very hot and humid. Most Walleyes caught on Leaches,and Rattle Traps."
513939,spongecake,2001-08-04 04:57:00,22,"Brian, when are you going in August? My wife and I are there for a week beginning the 25th. If you get back before then, I'd sure appreciate a report. Never been there, not sure what to expect, and I'll probably pack way too much. Thanks!"
513940,Brian,2001-08-06 07:04:00,140,"Spongecake,We will there the 19th-24th.. I will try and get a report to you as soon as we get back! Are you staying at the campground? You will love the area. If you want send me your email address where you can be reached or I can just post a reply here.Brian"
513941,spongecake,2001-08-06 08:34:00,22,"Brian, I'm afraid we will miss you in transit -- we're leaving early on the 24th. We are actually staying at the lodge in a housekeeping cabin. You've been there before, then? Same time of year? From the other posts, I'm thinking vertical livebait rigging will still be the hot ticket for wallies in 3 weeks, so I'll probably pick up a few leeches in Fort Frances. I'm still wondering if I should take crawlers with me and plan on trolling spinners a bit....? I don't know what to think about the water being high -- is that going to make things more difficult?"
513943,DaveIN,2001-08-06 10:44:00,191,I will also be checking in at the campground on the 26th but I am leaving home on the 24th.How about leaving a report with Barb of the hotspots to checkout first.I know of another couple that posts here that will be checking in on the 25th at the campground.ThanksDave
