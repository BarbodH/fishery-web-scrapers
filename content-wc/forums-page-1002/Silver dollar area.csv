Planning on hunting some birds and do a little fishing, mostly spending some quality time with my brothers. Any hints on what lakes produce and the best presentations that time of the year? I bring home more pictures and good memories than anything else. This will be my third trip to Canada in twenty years and the first two seem like yesterday.ThanksKevin"

514342,Kurt,2001-08-08 16:41:00,47,"Lake Sturgeon just north of Silver Dollar is a good lake trout lake. It it VERY big and VERY deep, but if you troll patiently there are some big ones there. If you go to the end of the mine road just north of Siver Dollar off of 599 you can get on to Darkwater lake. I have fished both of these in June but never in Sept. so I am not sure what is going on where at that time of year."
514343,KDS,2001-08-09 06:07:00,4,"Thanks guys. I'm definatly going to have to add some Hot-n-Tots to the tackle box. Darkwater lake sounds interesting. What is the lake access like? I have a 15' Lund Guide series on a bunk trailer. Again, thanks for the tips.Kevin"
514344,Kurt,2001-08-09 17:22:00,47,"The darkwater landing is pretty easy. You back in about 5 yards off to the side of the main road with plenty of room to manuveur. It drops down pretty quick so you don't have to get your vehicles wheels in much if any. A 4x4 is nice coming out if you have one. I have used a Durango and had no problems. Once you get in you go about 1/2 mile up a small stream and then you have to go through a culvert if the beavers have not blocked it off. The culvert is plenty big for most fishing boats. I have a 16 foot lund sv and make it easily. You have to pull up your motor and push your way through the culvert though. Watch the rocks on both sides of the culvert. After you go through the culvert you are on the main part of the lake. Some of the areas between island points and shorelines are pretty shallow so watch the rocks. I have a bent propeller to vouch for them being there. If you would like a picture of the landing, send me your email and I will forward you a couple."
