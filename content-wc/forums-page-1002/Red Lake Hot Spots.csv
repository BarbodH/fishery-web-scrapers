Does anyone know of especially good spots for Walleye or Lake Trout?Anyone have suggestions for what works best for Walleye during the first few weeks of September?We normally go there the first week of June and have almost exclusively fished for walleye on the rock points with jigs tipped with minnows, crawler or leeches. Not a big fan of trolling Little Joe's except for finding schools.Have never gotten a Lake Trout, but would love to make this the first year. I've got a topo map and know the deep spots, but am not experienced in what to use and presentation methods.Thanks in advance."
