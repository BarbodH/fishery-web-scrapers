514387,Karl,2001-08-10 21:21:00,63,"It's totally different than spring/early summer. English River is a waste of gas (and time). They're deeper on drop-offs, like 35-40 feet after the last island before Hunter Narrows. The mid-lake humps like the one between the cutoff and Redpine always hold walleyes in fall. Numbers aren't nearly as many, but you'll get bigger average size. Bottom bouncers with crawlers are good right now. Heavier jigs (3/8 - 1/2oz) with minnows or crawler pieces work. Also try trolling the largest size Risto Rap (Parrot color is best) at dusk around deep points and islands. They run about 16-18 feet on 10lb test line. Been talking regularly to a friend who lives there, the fishing this year has been exceptional and has never let up (so far). Has to do with the record high water and the almost daily rain this year.I'm going up the last week of August and will post my results when I get back."
