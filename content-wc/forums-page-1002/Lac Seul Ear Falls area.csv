Fish were caught in 12-20' with the bigger fish in 18-20' area. Caught all fish on spinner rig/minnows. Islands east of Cox's Island, third island in steamboat and Mckenzie Bay reefs produced the best quanity and quality. Weather was warmer than normal. Check out these sites for more current conditions.www.ontarioweather - .com/forecasts/cityforecast.asp?City=Red - +Lake+YRLweather.ec.gc.ca/for - ecast/yhd.htmlGood luck! Was up in June/july for 2 weeks. the lake was still very high. Would say it was even higher than the fall trip. In past years most fish were caught in the 8-12' range on spinners. Bright colors produce the best for me. Chartruse, florescent orange, combo of those colors and gold/brass blades.Blade sizes 2-4 Indiana. Pulled all the rigs on bottom bouncers. If your the jigin type the bright colors work very well like above. Alot of the locals use glow white jigs. 1/4 - 3/8 oz.By far McKenzie Bay (small/large clay banks and island north of Deer island) has produced the best quanity/quality fish out of all the areas I have fished. Ghost narrows is always worth a shot as well. Talk to the owner of the camp to get the current low-down, they usually are willing to give you good up to date info. Their info is what keeps you satisfied and hopefully return for another trip to their lodge. Get a good map of the lake. Smitties or 4 seasons bait shop in town have good maps and can also tell you some of the hot spots.Pack all type of clothing for winter to mild-summer. I've roasted and froze my butt off that time of year. A GOOD rain suit is usually necessary as well! Lived in it for the past 2 trips!Hope this helps..Good luck!"
