514324,Guest,2001-08-08 12:19:00,0,"Don't get me wrong, we walleye fish all the time. Bay of Quinte, Nipising, and sometimes Erie. I just keep reading what a blast catfish fishing is. I caught one when i was a junior angler when i was sunfish and panfish fishing and now i want to catch on purpose."
514325,Guest,2001-08-09 13:52:00,0,There are some terrific catfish opportunities on many Ohio rivers that feed Lake Erie. How about the north side. There must be some there.
