Twelve of us went and we caught many nice walleyes and pike (pickerals & jacks). Lots of 8lb+ pike and many 4 to 5lb walleye. The largest Pike went over 20lbs and I had a walleye hooked (that I lost-You've heard that one before) that went 8lbs+. I would recommend the Keeley Lake Lodge to anyone, the facilities were great!! I've heard that Canoe Lake is very good too and am wondering if anyone has any info on a good lodge or how the fishing is on Canoe."
