3313737,forgop,2014-11-17 18:06:00,880,"I can totally get leaving something behind in your home and making the drive to realize it's not with you once you unpack at the cabin, but not taking a final look behind in your vehicle was just a tough pill to swallow for that group I'm sure. When I work off the checklist, we almost always leave with a few things that we know we haven't packed that we always stop and get at Jay's in Michigan and we always make a stop at the WalMart in Sault Ste Marie on the US side before crossing."
3315169,maddogg,2014-11-18 10:41:00,178,I left my key ring hanging in the cabin on the lake. I didn't drive so I didn't know it until I got home. Called Verne and I had them in a couple of days.
3317673,zeebee,2014-11-19 08:29:00,1144,"About a dozen years ago I took my son for a fly-in out of Ft McMurray in northern Alberta for a week of lakers on the border of the North West Territories. I have a portable downrigger but somehow the 8 lbs cannonball remained on the plane after we unloaded. I ended up filling a heavy wool sock with rocks, tying it onto the rigger cable and it worked fine as a cannonball sub for the entire week."
3319393,NY Walleye,2014-11-19 19:03:00,78,All of my STRESS.
3319905,jambi,2014-11-20 07:13:00,504,Exactly! Leaving my cell phone behind one of the best things ever.
3309841,forgop,2014-11-16 04:06:00,880,"I haven't left anything behind, but a group that flew to another lake earlier in the afternoon got to the cabin and realized they left their fishing poles in their car. They called from their sat phone recognizing their mistake so on our trip we made a slight detour to their cabin on out trip out. I guess it worked out for me because I got to see the lake/cabin I've selected for next year."
3309881,Mike Borger,2014-11-16 04:55:00,1554,"I once left a small bag with my coffee press and a bunch of fresh ground coffee. I'd packed it separately so I could make coffee the morning of our flight and left it in the motel.As I'm sure you can imagine it was catastrophic not having good coffee. So you never told me, which lake did you pick for next year?"
3309897,forgop,2014-11-16 05:11:00,880,"Abbey. For the price, group size, and air base location, I'll take it. We'll have more than enough fish to catch between myself and 10/12 year old daughters. Going July 18-25, but you and your kids are welcome to join to.upgrade lakes. I'd go back to Anjigaming in a heart beat. As far now, Cam and Ribes were planned to be closed next year. I just don't have it in me being a solo driver to go any farther of a drive."
3309969,Mike Borger,2014-11-16 06:05:00,1554,"Abbey is a great lake! Very nice old log cabin on a point, and lots of walleye.(bring mouse traps though)I'm flying into Shekak with my family the last week of July otherwise I'd give that some serious consideration. Thanks for the offer though!I'll be able to help you with locations before you go."
3310353,SinOrSwim,2014-11-16 10:09:00,1528,"I forgot a pillow one year. Realized it on the way up. Stopped at a walmart and grabbed a new one. Basic white pillow with white case. Stayed at the bunkhouse the night before flying in. White pillow on a white mattress..........yep, forgot it again!!!!!! Ended up using a skanky throw pillow from one of the couches at the cabin wrapped in a sweatshirt. You can bet I have never forgotten a pillow again. Good think we always flew in a lot of beer. Creeps me out putting my head on something I have no idea where it's been and what has been done to it. Yuck"
3310737,roscoe33,2014-11-16 13:18:00,653,"Next time, just ask me. I can tell you where that pillow has been."
3310833,SinOrSwim,2014-11-16 15:03:00,1528,"Yeaahhhh, I don't want to know!!!! LOLThat is another reason I used to take a full size bed sheet with me. If you just have a sleeping bag, your skin will go skin to mattress at some point. Who the **** knows what is on some of those things."
3312137,MrSimon,2014-11-17 07:29:00,922,"This past year my buddy left his main bag in the truck at the airbase .... clothes, sunglasses, medicine, rain gear etc. He had his tackle bag though .... we loaned him some clothes and he was fine until the check flight. It's funny ... you plan for a year and scrutinize every detail of your packing. Only to realize you can forget almost everything you packed and still be just fine. We joked that a guy could get through a week at an outpost quite comfortably with one pair of clothes, a raincoat, one fishing pole, and small box of lures."
3312177,bigwalleye1,2014-11-17 07:33:00,2632,"You're spot on. A guy can get through, SO LONG AS IT'S THE OTHER GUY......"
3313305,Pooch,2014-11-17 14:28:00,4619,"My first trip to Canada was as a ""fill in"". Fly out trip. Everyone, but me had sleeping bags. I had a single sheet and two light blankets. First night one of the guys realizes he forgot his sleeping bag back in the truck. So I give him my heavier blanket. We both shiver the next seven nights. Didn't think much of Canada's midsummer weather.........When going with a larger group, especially on a fly in, someone nearly always forgets something. Never fails. Usually involves clothes, bedding or shaving kits.Fifty some trips later it still happens nearly every trip. Even working off of a list.Pooch"
