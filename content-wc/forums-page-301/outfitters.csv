2343666,BIGMANBIGPIKE,2014-01-12 10:31:00,8,I am new been looking over some posts does anyone know anything about Twin Lakes air outfitting in Nakina. I noticed several outfitters that have a good number of lakes with good fishing for both eyes and pike. Can anyone give some info on the outfitter and some of his possible better lakes? We have 6 guys ready and wanting to want to use Twin lakes outfitting service just do not know what lake to go to. Thanks everyone.

2344986,phishfearme,2014-01-12 20:05:00,1242,"welcome to WC and the ""Canada eh!"" site. one suggestion, tell the outfitter what you're looking for (numbers, or size or portage lakes, or privacy or...) then ask him what he would recommend. then ask him for the names and contact info of people who were at that lake last year over the same time frame you're considering. talking to the ""horses mouth"" is much better than talking to the other end of the horse. if he says he can't give out contact info then ask him to forward your info to the people who were there last year as request that they contact you. if he still refuses then go directly to another outfitter. ask if his is the only cabin on the lake. ask if there private cabins on the lake. ask how many groups he put into the lake each year. these all impact your experience. and note that lake differ widely - get a map of the lake. the best walleye lakes typically are mesotropic (very fertile and stained water) and a lake that offers lake trout is a oligotrophic lake that is clear and infertile which does not offer the best walleye or pike. lakes with river inlets and outlets usually offer excellent walleye and pike. there's lots of other items but this should keep you busy, best of luck phish"

2351690,oleJoe,2014-01-14 17:22:00,114,I have met Chad at a couple of sport shows and he is a hard worker and has quite a few lakes. I know Kag is a good lake for him. Big lake and a couple of other outfitters on it but plenty of room. He has 2 cabins on it. Pike and walleye. If you want to be the only cabin he has a lot of those lakes also. He won't steer you wrong. Good fishing
3313729,playx2,2014-11-17 17:59:00,1,We have fished & hunted moose the last several years with Chad at twin lake outfitters . Great guy . His camp on kag is comfortable & has all you would need plus some. The fishing for walleye is one of the best in Ontario . Pike fishing is also excellent . They also have lake trout fishing ( never fished for the lakers ) Any other information you are looking for just forward me a rely .
