3326177,Obabikon,2014-11-23 17:58:00,2370,Depends on the PSI... if it is less than 800 (I think that's the number) it isn't considered a fire arm.
3326305,Fisherman1792,2014-11-23 18:44:00,927,Has to be less than 500 fps or its considered a firearm. Can't see there being a problem if its under but you never know. I would look into it first. Fisherman 1792
