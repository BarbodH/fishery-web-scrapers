3328569,zeebee,2014-11-24 21:06:00,1144,The obvious question is why are Canadians with DUI's allowed to fish in Canada but some Americans with the same convictions denied. Kinda silly.Works both ways....Canadians with DUI's also face the risk of entry denial into the US but Americans with DUI's can travel freely around in the US.Someone explain the bureaucratic logic at play here. I think its time our respective lawmakers revisit some of these policies for non violent crimes.
3328729,kzoofisher,2014-11-25 03:25:00,5144,"The short answer to that is that you enjoy rights and privileges in your own country that you do not enjoy in another. I assume that denial of entry also holds for the guy who got busted with half a joint when he was young, and the guy who got a ""minor in possession"" at 17, and the guy who robbed a liquor store thirty years ago. That's the result of a ""clear cut"" rule. Everybody goes into the same category. I doubt you are going to find many politicians who will publicly support keeping out robbers and druggies while cutting some slack to drunk drivers, not a good PR move. Mayors Barry and Ford probably would have done it though."
3328753,ftfarms,2014-11-25 04:23:00,444,I must agree.
3328841,CI_Guy,2014-11-25 06:27:00,2118,"Canada doesn't deny Americans the privlege to fish in Canada because of the DUI they deny them entry because they have been convicted of a felony in the eyes of the Canadian government. People who have lost loved ones because of drunk drivers may disagree with your classifying a DUI as a ""non violent crime""."
3329393,Juls,2014-11-25 09:50:00,13414,Stay on topic please.
3330809,zeebee,2014-11-25 21:33:00,1144,My point is that privileges are extended to one group over another based on a subjective line of latitude without any practical rationale for so doing.Is one national a nastier DUIer than the other? Makes no sense.
3331041,Obabikon,2014-11-26 05:29:00,2370,"However, the point of this thread is to inform people about the rehabilitation process. Not to complain or support laws. Juls is asking everyone to stay on topic... if the debate needs to get rolling again, let's start a new thread for it. The Rehabilitation process has actually gotten easier (from what I've been told) over the past few years."
3185793,SinOrSwim,2014-09-18 08:04:00,1528,"We are very respectful. We don't joke around and do not talk back. We answer their questions when asked with honest answers. I will refer to anyone as a chump when they use their position of power to speak to others in a demeaning way because ""they can"". As for the bathroom. That is a BS excuse about the contraband. If it was prior to the border then I agree 100%. Or if we were in a holding area. But, in essence we have already crossed the border and other than paying a duty are free to go. So, what in the world would one want to drop their contraband after they have crossed? Plus, what does a drug dealer ""look like"". If you don't want to allow it, don't. But, if someone walks up to them to ask for a key, my guess is they aren't hding anything or they would hold it for the next 2 min until they are free to go and across ther border.That said, we have not had that many issues the last several years. As a matter of fact the Canada side has been more friendly than the US side. You want to pull us over and inspect us.....fine. We have nothing to hide. We declare everything we take and don't try to hide anything. But, if you aren't going to pull us over you can at least speak to us respectfully. Same goes for US police officers. Oh, and I got a speeding ticket when I was in Canada in August. That officer was polite and pleasant the whole time. It can be done."
3185817,BreezyPoint,2014-09-18 08:08:00,1581,"50 years of crossing the border into Canada. Probably at or near 100 times. I never had an experience where the border agents didn't treat me with courtesy and respect. Likewise, I have never had a negative experience with a Canadian on all those trips. I think the record is pretty good and the country and it's people are very accommodating.Frank"
3185825,SinOrSwim,2014-09-18 08:10:00,1528,"I should add, I went across in August with my 9 year old. When we pull up to the border we roll down all windows, take off sunglasses and hats etc. When I was with my kid they were friendly and polite. Told us to enjoy our day etc. Do the same thing with a group of guys ranging from 35 to 70 and all of a sudden they speak to us differently? Same process. Windows rolled down, no sunglasses or hats and hand them passports. Treated differently thouhg."
3185833,JAY221,2014-09-18 08:12:00,877,"I feel the same way & have never had any problem getting across either way. This kind of surprises me because the first couple of years I was with a pretty rowdy bunch. We have reached 20 responses with no personal experience so does anybody know anybody that has been successfully rehabilitated according to the Canadian Govt??? Later, Jay"

I agree , we all make mistakes when we are young......but when you are 35 , and choose to drink too much , and get on the road threatening the lives of others, then I don't feel bad, you get a DUI, and cant go fishing anymore..... there are too many dead people from alcohol related accidents, that only fish in heaven now.....they don't get the option of minn wisc or Canada maybe part of educating our youth, we remind them, screw up now, you wont be rippin lips on LOTW...... substance abuse and addictions are tough, for everyone"
3187145,yoopertrout,2014-09-18 18:27:00,1172,Very well said.
3187153,yoopertrout,2014-09-18 18:28:00,1172,"I have been over the border many times. I've only been treated rudely twice, and it was by American border patrol both times. I agree that there's no reason for the guards on either side to be rude."
3327825,rebelrn2001,2014-11-24 14:54:00,1563,%#%*## #()#()@)(&&) (#)(*(@)) Was considering making an effort to make amends and go next summer. Had ONE indiscretion but less than 10 yrs ago. I doubt I'd even have one beer (in the cabin) the whole week up there and I wouldn't even be driving. The fishing isn't THAT great and it's MUCH cheaper in the US. I'll take my money where the people appreciate it.
3328009,v-bay gord,2014-11-24 16:48:00,3168,"Apparently ""making the effort"" was to post on Walleye Central some disparaging remarks. If your ONE indiscretion was over 5 years ago then the process is there to be able to cross the border. Of course there is that ""making the effort"" part that always gets in the way. I'm back........"
3328321,kzoofisher,2014-11-24 19:04:00,5144,"Don't do the crime if you can't do the time. When your ""mistake"" is a serious criminal offense well, the consequences should be serious, too. Nice to see you VBG!"
3184714,yoopertrout,2014-09-17 17:39:00,1172,"Probably because some people get nervous and go to the bathroom and ditch drugs. The questions probably saved him a search. Remember, this is international customs, not the chamber of commerce!"
3184786,bigwillies,2014-09-17 18:23:00,515,being canadian i can say it is a joke on our side too.wife had a dui years ago and was told she needed a pardon to have it off her criminal record.lots of paper work through the rcmp.they tell u what they want.they send it back saying not good enough.plus it would be more money everytime.she finaly gave up.ha! my wife is a criminal!
3184994,Kenny_Ross,2014-09-17 19:52:00,103,When you jump through all the hoops its only to be considered when crossing into a Canada. The officer has the right to deny entry even after pardons have been granted....its up to the officers discretion. No different than us crossing into the US. My ex had a 20 yr old DUI and after her pardon it was a crap shoot if we got to cross into Montana.A pardon is only really useful on your own country....so u can get a job etc. Again it MAY help you in crossing but it guarantees nothing!
3185402,walleye22,2014-09-18 04:18:00,59,I have heard that this is very true. We americans complain about the Canadian border and the issues but I have heard we are brutal to them on our end as well.
3185609,SinOrSwim,2014-09-18 06:53:00,1528,THIS is the problem. Both sides to be honest. Get an agent who had a fight with his girlfriend or something and all of a sudden YOUR whole trip changes. There should be clearly defined rules. Not left to some chump who got turned down at the bar last night.
3185705,Obabikon,2014-09-18 07:33:00,2370,"I just want to say that I'm proud of the service officers provide at the border. They are lied to, sworn at, disrespected, and generally hated on a daily basis. The fact that they don't scream at every single person who comes through impresses me. They have the authority to deny entry to people for many different reasons... but, rarely do they invoke this authority. In the past three years, it has become progressively easier to cross the border IF you are prepared and respectful. If you are not prepared or are disrespectful/dishonest... then the officer is going to come down on you. Pulling up to the border, you are basically ASKING permission to come into another country. They absolutely have the right to deny you. They will have to explain to their superiors why entry was denied. So, for their job security, they will typically be within the guidelines given. There are a few cases where officers are out of line, however, the fact is... most are very professional. So, thanks to all the officers who take their jobs seriously, and behave in a professional manner!"
3185721,LOW1,2014-09-18 07:36:00,2828,"Did you ever consider the possibility that the Canadian port of entry at Fort Frances was intentionally designed with locked bathrooms right by the entrance door so that people who want to dump contraband have to go up and ask for the key and thereby provide the agents with a chance to see how shady they look? I have always assumed that there is a camera and/or a one way mirror in the bathrooms. It's like the cops here putting up a sign which says ""caution, vehicle inspection station five miles ahead"" and then posting all their plain clothes officers at the rest stop two miles ahead and arresting folks when they try to clean out their car of drugs, etc at the rest area. Canada is a foreign, independent, sovereign nation. It can do what it wants. Unless we are willing to invade and conquer a nation which is heavily armed with hockey sticks and curling brooms its best to get used to it."
3185745,LOW1,2014-09-18 07:44:00,2828,That has certainly been our experience. Unless you have a disqualifying criminal conviction no one should avoid going to Canada out of fear of customs. Common sense and politeness goes a very long way.
3185761,LOW1,2014-09-18 07:48:00,2828,"Your problem may lie in your belief and attitude that a Canadian border agent is appropriately referred to as a ""chump."""
3185777,v-bay gord,2014-09-18 07:54:00,3168,"Very true. People often do not realize that when ""buddy"" get's called in for an interview and comes back saying he's been denied access because of an old DUI, his friends have no way of knowing that ""buddy"" also has some other more serious convictions that he's too embarrassed to admit. The border at Fort Francis crossing has improved greatly in it's public relations, but the bottom line is they are there to make decisions on entry. Whether it seems fair or not may be not as black or white as it seems on the surface."
3181849,JAY221,2014-09-16 18:56:00,877,"I have a neighbor that is considering going through the process of ""Rehabilitation"" so that he can get back in to Canada. He has had 2 DUI's & the most current one was in 2000. I am just wondering if anyone that has been through it can tell me about the experience. Thanks, Jay"
3181905,pike50plus,2014-09-16 19:19:00,584,In AA for over 30 years and he really thinks that is what has kept him clean
3183842,walleye22,2014-09-17 11:49:00,59,"He will never get back in Canada. Ever. No matter how much rehab or money he pays. My buddy has 2 of them, last one was in like 2005. He went through the whole process of paper work from the border and paying money and sending it back in and doing whatever them people told him to do and he did it. He tried to go this year and was denied even with all his paper work in hand. Denied another buddy in our group because of an assault charge from like 2001. Kicker is he has gone about 10 times since then and was just in niagra falls 3 weeks before crossing at I.Falls and denied. they pick and choose the crap and they know your at their mercy. They stayed in I. Falls and fished Rainy and had a ball. Their money will be staying in the USA From now on. Camp they were going too lost about 6000.00 from the group this year for that week."
3183938,BreezyPoint,2014-09-17 12:14:00,1581,"I wouldn't give up just yet. Remember, to deemed fully rehabilitated the completion of the sentence for the last violation has to be ten years in the past. 2005 is not ten years back. It is my understanding (and I could be wrong), customs has some discretion for violations a shorter time in the past.Frank"
3183946,walleye22,2014-09-17 12:22:00,59,"Ehh...its all just verbage. When we went without(he knew he couldn't get in) we Stopped at the border and asked specicially what he had to do and when he got it and things like. 1 person told it was so many years from the time he got the DUI and to fill out paper work and pay this amount of money, had another person(counter right next to this other cat) tell us it starts when the probation is over so if it was in 2005 and he was on probation here is US for 2 years then the time starts then. They have no idea..NONE of them. He did exactly what they told him to do...verbatim and paid money they told him too and still didn't get in. Its all amount money, problem is they are losing money for the tourism. I am quite sure the USA folk coming into Ontario to fish pump a lot of money into Ontario every year. But then again I do not worry about because I never got a DUI. I just wish they would do what they say when they tell you to do something from a goverement official and you do it and still doesn't work it is frustrating."
3183986,BreezyPoint,2014-09-17 12:33:00,1581,"Well on their website it states 10 years from completion of sentence and probation. Oh and BTW, local officials do not always seem to be in the know. I was once stopped for a 'boating safety compliance check' and they threatened to ticket me because I was out of compliance. I told them for a boat in the country for a short period, the boat needs only be in compliance with the jurisdiction the boat is registered in. He gave me a deer in the headlights look and let me go. I subsequently wrote the Canadian Coast Guard for clarification and they sent me a letter that I could present to an officer on the water. I carried that for many years until it finally withered away. Now I just brought my boat up to compliance because it isn't worth the hassle (all I needed was the rope and manual bilge pump).If I were in your situation, I would carry printouts from the customs website to bolster my argument if there were any disagreement with the rules.Frank"
3183994,tv4fish,2014-09-17 12:34:00,2694,"If you have met their ""terms"" - throw their own book back at them:"
3184154,JAY221,2014-09-17 13:11:00,877,"I have read about the process & it is in fact 10 years after all fines & time such as probation is done. I am just looking for someone with personal experience that has finished it through to the end. If you don't want to post here just PM me. The rules seem to be pretty straight forward but they do NOT guarantee the results you want. The neighbor did in fact go for many years without being turned away. Then they wouldn't allow him anymore. Later, Jay"
3184466,SinOrSwim,2014-09-17 15:12:00,1528,I agree with walleye22. If I had done all that and they still denied me? Not a chance would I ever even try again. I'm sick of the border agents and we have never had anybody turned back. Just the way we are treated sometimes. We had a guy this year they questioned like a criminal because he asked to use the bathroom at the border crossing. The one outside they ahve to give you a key.
3184698,yoopertrout,2014-09-17 17:34:00,1172,"I have sympathy for those who got an OWI, cleaned up their act, and can't get into Canada. I suspect, and hope that they will work out a clearer process in the next few years. That said, it's worth remembering that any country has a right to deny entrance to criminals, no matter what their crimes were - assault, OWI etc. Almost no countries take such an easy stance on OWI's as the U.S. Most countries realize that having a drunk driving a couple thousand pounds of metal at 60 miles an hour is a recipe for funerals. Again, I understand people make mistakes. Many of us drove drunk when we were young, but it's time to be aware of the tragic death toll, and the changing tolerance."
