Not looking for any secret spots and we always catch/release, but wondering what parts of the lake produce best. Variety is appreciated too so we always welcome walleye, pike or a shot at a muskie thrown in. Not sure if we will find true ""remote"", but the fewer boats the better. Camp suggestions would also be great. Many thanks."

Everywere (grin)In june, just look for bolders/rocks the size of your head and cast.Don't forget the season opens june 15 or there about.I go out of Morson. Yes you will see other boats, they will be fishingjust like you. In june, if you can't catch sm you are doing something very wrong.If you have never bin there, get a good map and pay attention you will be fine. If you would like more camp info pm me, or im sure you will get lots suggestions soon. There lots to chose from. I don't like to make suggestionsin a public fourm."

3274994,Thompmd,2014-10-31 06:53:00,320,"i always stayed in Sabaskong bay near nestor falls and fished for smallmouths from the 1st to last of june over the years and timing obviously makes a difference. We fished with baits tat alowed us to catch a variety of species. We typically fished 4-5hrs in the morning then 5-6 hrs in the evening. Year in/out we realistically caught 30-40day and up to 100ish. They honestly averaged 14-16"" with some smaller and a few Larger(but not many). be a little wary of camps promising large numbers and avg sizes. We used standard baits like spinnerbaits,crankbaits,rattletraps etc. tubes are good but are difficult to keep from rocks. Small-medium size rocks are good but don't overlook weeds/wood but generally rocks are key. You wont find yourself fighting you for places to smallmouth fish as 99% of anglers are walleye or muskie fishing. The baits mentioned above allowed us to catch all species every trip. if you decide on sabaskong bay send me a PM and [I] can get you some GPS spots. good luck"
