3289090,deadhead1,2014-11-06 13:51:00,193,generally fishing is as good on the Winnipeg River as it is in LOW. In general I would expect bigger fish in the river. Water levels can be a ***** in the river at times.

Been going there every year for the past 23 years, wouldn't dream of looking anywhere else. Oh, did I mention GREAT smallie and pike fishingas well??"

3283226,kayakmatt,2014-11-03 20:50:00,105,"Been surfing around for a remote boat -in American plan resort on LOTW. Maybe I'm demanding alot, but these are resort features I would like...Boat in. No cars...I spend a good part of my life in them.American Plan.Remote.Don't want a guide.Flat floor swivel seat boat WITH TROLLING MOTOR!! It's a shame when a lodge looks great for our needs and they don't have any trolling motors. I just say...sorry...we can't do business! As a bass and pike fan, I could not imagine flying a 1000 miles to the Canadian wilderness to listen to an outboard running all day and smelling the fumes. I will go for hours without starting the big engine when I am in prime casting areas with an electric motor.Crow Rock looked perfect. Had to hang up on the guy when he said they had no trolling motors. Same with Shoal Lake.Any Suggestions? Obabikon...do you have trolling motors...their website leaves alot of questions."

3286050,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2014-11-04 21:51:00,629,"You will find it to be a full service camp that can provide you with all of what you have expressed as important. Gary Moeller is the GM of the camp & a long time resort owner on LOTW. The camp will pick you up out of Hanson Bay which is on the NW corner of Sabaskong Bay. Multiple stay packages are available & you will be fishing in some of the prime waters of LOTW! The picture is my rig waiting to launch @ the ""Hanson Bay"" ramp, Morson, Ont..From ""Hanson Bay"" to camp is a 3 to 4 mile ride, located just North of the East end of ""Sunset Channel"" & ""Rabbit Point"" as your leaving the NW corner of Sabaskong Bay."

3286402,kayakmatt,2014-11-05 07:08:00,105,"Thanks for all the suggestions. Still looking into these choices.In years past, we have flown into MSP, Duluth, Intl Falls, to make the trek into Canada. We were considering flying to Winnipeg, as there are more airline and cost effective flight choices, and no dreadful Ft Francis border crossing.Therefore was considering Ash Rapids Resort on the western side of LOTW. Anyone been there? Wrote off Shoal Lake Lodge due to their lame boats and no electric trolling motors.Looked at Rough Rock Lodge on the Winnipeg River and it really fits are needs. Can anyone tell me how the fishing for bass, pike, walleye compares on Rough Rock vs LOTW?As you might guess, this is a very expensive trip...flights, bag fees, rental car, American Plan. The pressure is on me to plan a trip for Canadian novices, so I try to avoid big multi-day travel expedition to get to our destination. Leave Tennessee by 6 am, be fishing by dinner!Thanks again."
3286530,bob888,2014-11-05 08:13:00,244,"Ballards ""Black Island Resort""/Morson, Ontario/LOTW Curious of exactly where is this resort. Thanks"
3287722,gowrlop,2014-11-05 18:52:00,109,I agree with John about Ballards Black Island. I was there in June and enjoyed fantastic Smallmouth fishing. I caught plenty of walleyes and a few Muskies but mostly targeted the Bass. The house on the pic is where BBI is located.
