3233889,forgop,2014-10-10 09:32:00,880,Smallies taste good. Caught multiple 4# smallies last year and they're a much more fun fish to catch pound for pound than any walleye or northern I've ever caught.
3234033,jambi,2014-10-10 10:18:00,504,I have not tried them but I will now.
3234129,Guest,2014-10-10 11:29:00,0,"In many waters SMB are garbage fish. Nuisance fish. Like Goby's, in many waters ,they just need to be thinned out. And in some waters, removed completely. Should be mandatory that for every Walleye that you keep you have to have 5 SMB as well. And, by the way, Musky over 30 inches taste terrible. The smaller ones generally taste much better."
3234433,orchard frank,2014-10-10 15:20:00,1900,"We've eaten a few in Canada, mostly when hooked too deep, bleeding bad. Yes, I know they might have survived, but we enjoy a bass occasionally. Earlier this year on a quick trip over to Big Bay de Noc, we probably caught over 40 smallies while targeting walleye. Most were small, but several in the 4#+ range, many 2-3#. I had just watched a cooking show where they did a Caribbean recipe of cooking a whole fish, marinade etc., so I took home 3 that were about 3#, did them up, and they were very good.I did not consider it a battle of conscience, or an ethical dilemma, just eating a few fish."
3234481,AllenW,2014-10-10 16:17:00,11482,"Big muskys should be pickled btw. While true that something may be legal it may not be right, depending on who's eyes your looking through, it's also true that because something is legal doesn't mean it's wrong to do it either. Also because you don't keep fish don't mean your any better than those that do. Never tried smallies, many years ago had a 6# large mouth out of a shallow lake caught in mid august, was told to try baking it...tasted like mud. I hope the smallies taste better than that. Al"

Walleye, pike smallmouth, and channel cats. When your hungry they all taste good. I took home walleye, smallmouth and channel cats to test on my family who not nearly as hungry. Channel cat won hands down. I enjoy smallmouth for their fighting ability and no longer use them as food."
3234673,ftfarms,2014-10-10 18:56:00,444,We've had an on going rule We don't keep smallmouth It's ben that way since we started going to Canada. Our theory was it takes to long for them to grow and reproduce in the cool north. That's just how we've looked at it.
3234705,JAY221,2014-10-10 19:13:00,877,"I have never eaten a Smallmouth,but I do love catching them. Anything that fights that good deserves to go back in the water. I am not knocking anybody else that is just an opinion. Later, Jay"
3234753,Baxman1958,2014-10-10 20:01:00,14,"Our group eats smallmouth. The only ones we keep are 16"" - 18"". Now, understand, we eat walleye for breakfast, lunch, and dinner - ****, sometimes we have walleye cookies as a snack between meals! Washed down with a refreshing Golden Walleye ale, brewed from the few parts that we don't eat. If you've never eaten a smallmouth, you don't know what you're missing. As previously stated, the filets are beautiful; larger than the walleyes you don't/can't keep. AND - they're easy to clean! The meat is succulent, sweet, yet still solid. The fat part of the filet, if done correctly, is basically the bass' shoulder. To me - the texture and taste, depending on if I'm cooking ( or someone else ) , dictates the final outcome. Done correctly, the smallmouth shoulders taste just as good as chunks of lobster, dipped in garlic/butter sauce, (IMHO).This is my favorite way of cooking it. Prepare your dipping sauce(s) ahead of time, because the fish isn't going to take long, and it's best when fresh. I like to saute the fillets in olive oil, with a bit of real butter, and crushed garlic. 80% stove heat - pan hot before you put in the fish. I saute them to about 85% cooked - Pull off the heat, and invite your Buds. The fish will continue to cook for another 2 minutes, or so (internally). Especially if you put a lid on the pan. You won't believe how fast they disappear, and you'll hear comments like - ""This tastes just like lobster!"" ""OMF******G*d! Etc ........................ It doesn't taste like walleye, or northern, or crappie, etc ................... In my ignorant opinion, the smallmouths' shoulders are what makes her one of the greatest fighting fish in our part of the world. Don't be afraid to eat a smallie every once in a while. Just like any species, you unfortunately have to 'cull' the herd. There are so many smallies in the area of NW Ontario that I used to fish, keeping a few of the small legals, will in no way affect the population. Sorry for the long-winded response. BOTTOM LINE - eat more BASS!~Baxman"
3234817,Nimstug,2014-10-10 20:32:00,2605,"No, don't eat them."
3233153,Sportdog,2014-10-10 00:31:00,6735,"I guess that I'm being judgemental here but why do folks keep those large smallmouth bass at Canadian fishing lodges? I see tons of pics on various lodge websites of guys holding up stringers of smallies. Am I missing something? Why would you keep smallmouths to eat when there are walleyes in abundance to be had? I can see someone keeping a trophy to have mounted but can't think of any other reason. (Myself I would photograph, take measurements, and then release the fish) I know that it's legal for them to keep these fish but I am having trouble understanding why they do it."
3233193,roscoe33,2014-10-10 03:20:00,653,"Have you tasted one?I ate one last year, on a day when we couldn't catch an eater sized walleye to save our souls.I thought they were one of the three best tasting fish I have ever eaten.I was very surprised how tender and delicate the meat was.Also, more than twice the amount of filet than on an equal length walleye.Walleye, perch, and smallies from nice cold waters. Mmmmm.Do I keep trophies? noWould I keep more than one or two small ones for a meal? no"
3233225,kzoofisher,2014-10-10 04:11:00,5144,"I've never eaten one but have also heard they are very good, nothing like the largemouth that I ate a couple times as a kid. I would keep a couple 15"" if it was the difference between going hungry or not; there are plenty of them in the lakes I fish and they are seldom targeted and kept even less. Doubt that would happen though, we don't plan on eating walleye everyday so a day where everything is over the slot is still a good day. To be honest, there are days when we target smallies and only catch walleye incidentally. We may or may not keep any fish those days. You did touch on a pet peeve of mine in your post, though you were only referring to it and not doing it. ""I know that it's legal for them to keep these fish but I am having trouble understanding why they do it."" I hate the ""it's legal so it's ethical"" argument. There are almost always better arguments for doing something than because it's legal. If you can't think of any maybe you should stop doing the thing until you understand the arguments for and against it. Deferring to politicians as your judges of what is right and wrong is about the most spineless, weak minded, lazy thing I ever heard. ""Just because you have the right to do something, doesn't mean doing it is right ."" Nothing like an early morning mini-rant to wake you up."
3233233,big popi,2014-10-10 04:32:00,635,"We certainly eat them & they are tasty from the cold waters. Usually the 15-16"" fish. I do believe there should be limit put on the larger SM to keep the big girls around. What I have noticed is that the lake/river system we did not start catching SM until 15 years ago or so. Now they seem to be like bluegill here at home."
3233545,prov1800,2014-10-10 07:31:00,5010,definatly sounds like you didn't take your nice pill yet.lol.
3233609,LOW1,2014-10-10 07:52:00,2828,"Absolutely we eat them. Why not? And I am not sure that I could tell the difference between a breaded piece of walleye and a breaded piece of smb. And many people find catching smb to be more enjoyable than walleye fishing, or at least an enjoyable change."
3233625,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2014-10-10 07:56:00,629,"I agree with the general statement about why people will eat ""Small Mouth Bass""? I firmly believe that they are one of the best oz./oz. fresh water sport fish, if not the ""Best"". I have to admit that I had circumstance several years ago that I purposely killed 5 for mounting. I'm proud to say that with the exception of the 5 on the wall, I have ""caught & released"" every SM since! Since 2006 when I got the 5 for the wall, all out of the same location, every late Sept. since, they have been found in the same location! It's generally my season ending marathon! Over the years I have had multiple 20""+ SM's but never anything larger than 20""ers."
3233801,Bakefish,2014-10-10 09:07:00,1077,Musky taste much better.
3233817,Knutson21,2014-10-10 09:09:00,348,"John, That is an awesome Mount. I have one SM on a piece of drift wood in my office. Your 5 is really cool."
3233881,troutwater,2014-10-10 09:30:00,299,"Lol! Those are fightin words! We have eaten smallmouth before but we usually only do it if we can't pick up any pike or eater walleye. On Pipestone in 07' we pretty much just ate smallmouth because they were everywhere. We never ate one over 14-15 inches though. They are very tasty, but I hate cleaning them."
