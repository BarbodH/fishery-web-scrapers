3331833,MrSimon,2014-11-26 13:06:00,922,"As accurately suggested above, walleye fishing can be technical, subtle, and all about pinpoint finesse. BUT, sometimes you can throw all that out the window and just go fishing. Walleye don't always follow the 'rules'. On a recent September fly-in we did all the 'proper' things and did find walleye on deep structure. But we also caught some beauties just casting in-line spinners in and around shoreline reeds and shallow weed beds. Big Fall walleye can often be found aggressively feeding in shallow water .... usually looking for perch in weed beds. The most fun we had was on a gorgeous sunny afternoon just poking down a shoreline chucking spinners and spoons in all directions .... no real concern for structure, boat control, electronics .... we caught some huge pike and plenty of walleye that way. One last thing .... watch your water temperature .... if it has cooled off into the lower 60s, you might want to start looking shallow and work deeper."

3329329,GBPB,2014-11-25 09:25:00,19,OK! We have locked in our place to go in September. That was first hurdle.2nd hurdle....how do you catch a walleye????Got some ideas but have never caught one before.If this isn't a newbie question I don't know what is. HAHA Thanks.
3329433,mt hook,2014-11-25 10:05:00,65,"GBPBBest to tell where you are going, and time of year.Short answer jig's or spinner rigs."
3329457,MrSimon,2014-11-25 10:15:00,922,"Catching them is pretty easy .... jig with live bait, bottom bouncer rigs, crankbaits FINDING them is the tricky part. My advice .... take a fish finder and know how to use it to find structure that is likely to hold walleye."
3329465,Mojo1269,2014-11-25 10:23:00,816,I would strongly suggest to hire a guide for the first day you are there. In addition to technique you will get spots. This can be the difference in no fish to many fish and will in all liklihiood really enhance your trip.
3329489,GBPB,2014-11-25 10:29:00,19,Sorry. We are going to Woman Lake Lodge north of Ear Falls and we were going the second week of September.
3329561,BornToFish,2014-11-25 11:11:00,1224,"Congratulations to you for your decision to fish in NW Ontario. You will likely be making further trips. I fish about seven weeks each season on a lake near where you are going. September is far and away my favorite time of the year to fish in NW Ontario. The bugs are pretty much gone, along with many other boats. The flip side to these benefits is that the weather can be the best of the best or the worst of the worse, with both possibly happening during the same day. The majority of walleyes in the lake that I fish are associated with off-shore rock humps during September. The good thing about this is that if I can find one walleye, I know where the rest of them are, as they are often all in the same place. When I pull up to a rock hump and catch my first walleye, I'm thinking ""game on"" as I have a chance to catch every fish on that particular hump. I'm not trying to brag, but I caught and successfully released 600-700 walleyes last September. This doesn't include the catch from my boat partners. The rewards can be great fishing for walleyes during September in NW Ontario. A challenge is that proven techniques for catching walleyes are difficult for many anglers to master. I offer a few suggestions:Have with you and know how to use good electronicsIt's all about depth of water during September.Be prepared to fish ""deep"" (e.g. 25-30+ fow)Have good walleye equipment with you that is sensitive to find bottom and feel the biteBoat control separates those that catch fish from those that get frustrated. Be prepared to fish for hours and not move your boat more than a few boat lengths. Hiring a reputable guide will likely be money well-spent as you should learn some spots, but more importantly learn proven techniques to catch fish that can be applied to any spot. I have some other information that might interest you. Send me a Private Message if you are interested. Tight lines and good fishing!!"
3329753,new hips,2014-11-25 12:22:00,498,"We always fish in September, the fish are generally deep 20-40ft good starting point. Buy a sensitive rod, put on 4or 6 lb fireline, use a 3 way lindy rig with a 1/1.5oz walking sinker with a half crawler, backtroll slowly off most any point and hang on. This is a good search tool, then you can jig them in the same manner. If the fish have lock jaw, use a egg sinker with a 3 foot dropper,3 cranks off bottom /half crawler/minnows/ and dead stick it right in their face. You really can keep it pretty basic."
3330025,jambi,2014-11-25 14:34:00,504,"I've done a few trips during the first week of September. These were flyouts about 100 miles NW of Ear Falls. I would find walleye spots while trolling, then circling back and jigging. Both trips found loads of fish in 6' to 12'. Many of these spots were transition areas with deep water near by, not flats. Trolling a crankbait like a hot n tot or a flickershad is a good way to find the shallower bite (less than 20'). Find em on the troll, then go back and jig. September trips were great as mentioned for no bugs and wonderful weather."
3330745,adempsey,2014-11-25 20:36:00,963,What do you fish for now?
3331441,Duflebag,2014-11-26 09:11:00,218,"September is the time of year that I normally fish a lot in Canada. BornToFish is spot on with what we do at that time of the year. I would add to what he said in my use of my fishfinder in that approach. I will not drop a jig if I don't see those arches on the screen. I have learned through a lot of trial and error that I am much more successful in spending the time to slowly search the rock hump or reef I intend to fish to first find fish on the fishfinder than jigging and jigging trying to find them. When you find the fish it really stands out on the screen. Not one of two but large numbers of fish. Typically also, once you find the depth on one reef the others will be similar. Be prepared for the fish to move around on the reef or for one portion of the reef to be busy for a while then turn off. If you find fish on the screen but they aren't biting, return to that school through the day. Sooner or later they will turn on. If the bite slows or stops, move around.Have a great time. Nothing in life compares to being on a Canadian shield lake on a beautiful fall day."
