3000594,Pooch,2014-07-15 21:00:00,4619,"Wife and I went to a new to us camp this trip with our boat. Lac Seul Lodge. Really like the camp and people. Met up with Carnhzker and his family. Great folks.New to this area of LS so we were a little befuddled as to where to start. Went to main lake second day and caught a few scattered eaters. But for a few brief good bites it was very slow all week for us until the last day. During one brief good bite wife and I picked up some slot and a 24.5 and 25"" walleye. Out of frustration one evening I put a plastic ribbed minnow imitator with a paddle tail on a jig and started popping it along as I back trolled. The fish like it and I had a good numbers couple of hours out alone in the boat. All nice eater sized fish from the bay in front of LSL. I also snagged three old trolling rigs off the bottom that evening! Never retrieved that many rigs in such a short time span. The last day I met up with Skywagon and his partner ""Henry"" in Skywagon's boat. Spent a fun day with them. Fishing was more like I had expected as they know the lake well. They fished similar areas that I had been fishing, but went shallower than we had been fishing. All sizes caught with a 24 and 26.5"" for size. It was good to get a chance to get back in a boat with Skywagon and Henry. With three lines in the water fishing was much faster than with my wife and I as she fishes very little and reads all day in the boat.Had it not been for my wife contacting infantigo then staff infection from the flea bag hotel we stayed at on the way up it would have been a ""nice"" trip. Not a good fishing trip as fishing trips go. Pretty miserable trip for my wife. Sadly for me, probably her last to Canada. That said wife and I got a chance to run up to Red Lake and spend one afternoon with old friends from Balmertown. That was worth the price of the trip in itself. Meeting Carnhzker face to face and reconnecting with Skywagon and Henry salvaged the trip for me.Looking forward to our upcoming annual fifteen days on the water trip to Lake Savant with old friends. A little more serious fishing with these diehards.Pooch"

3000746,michigan walleye guy,2014-07-15 22:00:00,95,"May fly in trip to Larus Lake, weather-wise, was awesome, and so was the fishing. We got there about a week or so past ice out, and the big fish were in the shallow bays, gorging on insects. 75 degrees all week, and never took the rain gear out once.June trip to Clear Lake couldn't have been more different weather wise. I-Falls had about 2-3 inches of rain on June 14 and another 2-3 inches the next day, which meant we spent the whole day cooling our heels. Couldn't fly in on that day, and that was the first time in 14 years this happened to us. Fishing was a bit off that week because the water temps dropped quite a bit. Still a good trip, with tons of fish. But rain and high winds made things tougher than usual.Just got back from the Boundary Waters yesterday, and the weather was cool and rainy most of the week. Walleyes were not on the rock piles in any numbers, but the lake trout fishing was awesome, per usual up there."
3001066,REG,2014-07-16 06:23:00,445,"Been going up to Snake Falls Camp on Pakwash for over 20 years. The last 2 years have been incredible - with this year being even better than last year. Our group had 2 Walleyes at 30"" - never had that before - plus many over and around the 18"" size. Northerns were good again this year as well - group biggest was 40"" but many, many slots plus a couple of 38"". And as mentioned by some others, it seems that the Smallmouth are getting more plentiful. We catch them while Walleye fishing but they're always fun and it seemed like we picked them up in even more spots this year than most. We go up the third week of the season and it has been a late ice-out the last 2 years - so that might have something to do with it. I also think the effects of fewer fishermen over the past several years might be having an impact as well. There doesn't seem to be as many boats on the water.."
3004386,muskyman73,2014-07-16 21:24:00,402,"Our trip to LOTW at Amasons Obabikon was good despite the weather. The lake level was up a few feet too, j-rods docks were being held down by trash cans filled with water. There was so much water I am surprised the island did not float away ! lol The fish were more than cooperative and we did very well on everything. The walleye were like ants and the smallmouth were on the larger side. All the usual baits worked well and we also found a big school of monster crappie that sacraficed themselves for the better part of participating in a fish fry. Boy they did not let us down ! We got two muskies too. With no break downs on the water it was a good trip. We wore our rain suits for the better part of the first 3 days, and the rain did not hinder the fishing at all. Most of our best fishing was all around the vicinity of the camp and I did not even burn a tank of gas in my boat. I love my E-Tec ! We had several large 25 inch + walleyes and my buddy kevin even got a largemouth bass too. Specie wise it was crazy, the only thing we were missing was a lake trout !One thing for sure, I hate leaving that island. Worst part about going is knowing you have to leave in a week."
3006946,nitroman,2014-07-17 17:36:00,368,Best week of fishing ever! Fished Cedar 2nd week of June and we are still laughing about the insane walleye and crappie bite we had!
3011265,Guest,2014-07-19 07:48:00,0,nitroman we have a party of 5 going to cedar point resort on cedar lake 1st week of September out of Chicago:we fish 75% walleyes 25% northerns I was told times square by the resort is excellent for walleyes any suggestions of areas to work would be appreciated did you fish Richardson lake?? we plan to spent some time casting and trolling for muskies jim wolf the Chicago boys thanks

3325153,Phil T,2014-11-23 08:08:00,4820,"We didn't go fishing in Canada, but we drove through AB, YT, and BC on a trip to Alaska. Canadians are wonderful people. They seem very pleased to have tourists, are always very helpful, and are generally just good folks. I have no complaints with Alaskans either, but Canadians go out of their way to make foreigners welcome. The three weeks we spent traveling through Canada was a pure joy. When we got home, I put our left over Canadian currency in the safe deposit box instead of changing it back to US $ because we will be returning. Traveling north sure beats visiting our daughter in Minneapolis, MN. Big US cities suck."
3328625,Tylumps,2014-11-24 21:54:00,73,"Went with my Father and Sons in 2013 because all our older fishing group members could not have justified the cost. We understood the groups concerns, this group of Uncles and family friends have gone 10 times over the last 20 years. The 2013 group had no choice to but go because my Father is approaching 80 and his grandsons are now 10 and 11 and have not been in a flyin before. Health and good timing was of the essence. The trip was mid July 2013 which is 1 month later than we have been going over the years but the boys baseball went through June and we had to trust we knew what to do later in the summer. Results....We crushed it. My boys drove the boats and reeled in over 1200 walleyes over the week. It rained and blew everyday but we creamed the walleyes. Catch and release and pictures for the memories we had been to fishing heaven and back. We report back our success to the elders and they demand a return trip in 2014 which we oblige and did just as terrific. Memories are recorded and the events of each trip meant so munch to me and my kids,"
3329737,Mojo1269,2014-11-25 12:18:00,816,My trip this year was great. BNoated 11 musky and dozens of walleyes in 6.5 days. Weather was msotly great and managed to get out as long as I wanted everyday. Only bummer is/was the 497 miles one way that I have to drive. I may have to start chopping that up on the drive up so I am not a road zombie the first 1/2 day and nite....
3330153,Golden Eagle,2014-11-25 15:49:00,2642,"May 31 our party of 4 hit Little Vermilion Lake for 7 days, catching plenty of decent walleyes and lots of really nice pike. We missed the usual third Saturday in May due to late ice on our favorite lake. July 19, my wife and I arrived at LV for 7 days of one of our best ever summer trips up north. Pounded walleyes and picked a lot of nice pike, mostly on walleye rigs. I chose the week because I was turning 80 on July 23 and got out of town to avoid a surprise birthday party for me. October 11, I made a solo trip to LV for a 9 day stay. Fishing was good, not the best ever fall trip, but being there was great. I was able to celebrate Thanksgiving with some really nice people. I gave moose hunters all the lake they wanted. I hit humps and a couple of major points. I'm going to stick with it until I get the hang of fishing Ontario waters."
3325849,Pooch,2014-11-23 15:08:00,4619,"After a slow start to the season's first trip the next two trips were just short of banner years.After fishing Lac Seul Lodge earlier (end of June, high water, couple storms) and initially struggling the first part of the trip things picked up and the trip turned out good.We headed back to Wildewood on Lake Savant the end of July/first of August for two weeks on the water and had another great trip. Size was down, but average fish was still in the low twenty inch range with good numbers. No fish over twenty six inches of significance were caught by our group. That was a first for us.Over Labor day I returned to Lac Seul and again stayed at Mahkwa. Had another very good trip there. Great numbers and tons of fish over the slot. Small mouth were cooperative while fishing for walleye. Especially on trolled plastic paddle tails. Everything we put in the water seemed to catch fish. That part of the lake improves each year, IMO.Very few ""larger"" fish over twenty six inches this year on any of the trips. I think this is the first time in many years that I've not caught a number of fish in the twenty seven to twenty eight inch range. Must be loosing my mojo.Of the three trips I make each year with different groups to three very different camps on different lakes or parts of the same lake (Lac Seul), the Mahkwa trip on Lac Seul has evolved into my favorite of the season. That said, going over Labor Day the weather can and has been sometimes ""fresh"". Over all a solid year of fishing. Looking forward to doing it all again next year.Pooch"
2984945,packpro,2014-07-10 22:22:00,695,"Camp is on Big Canon. Docks on both that lake and the wabigoon river system They have great portages off both of those systems, but the fishing was so good we did no take them this year. Caught walleye, big pike, perch, ( nice little take home bonus), smallmouth, and Lake Trout. Lots of them this year high in water column"
2986057,nitrodude,2014-07-11 09:42:00,60,"Got home Sunday from the yearly ten day trip to Sioux Lookout. Had one of, if not THE best years yet! Temps were great, water was high, and the fish were very cooperative everywhere we fished. We had the best daily numbers of smallmouth with more regularly over 20"" than ever before. I would guess that most, if not all, had not yet spawned. (We are CPR on bass.) Lots of just under, slot, and over size limit walleye were caught as by catch while smallmouth fishing. (The yearly fish fry was delicious!) The better bass and walleye came for us on our days on Minnitaki, although several good fishing days came from Abrahms, Pelican, and in the English River. Only spent one day on Botsford and it was a tad slower, though the cold rain that day surely had an impact. We were having so much fun on our closer spots that we never even went up on Lac Seul this year. All in all, the best day was epic and the worst day was awesome! We all hated to leave them biting so good and are anxious to return next year. It will be my 20th consecutive year, Good Lord willing and the creek don't rise. (Not that the water could possibly get any higher!)"
2986529,Mike Kansas,2014-07-11 12:36:00,1463,Sounds like there was a lot of happy fisherman this year . Great to see that Canada brings so many smiles to our faces. Mike Kansas
2987201,Draco1206,2014-07-11 17:53:00,175,"Our trip to Washi Lake this year was the best ever for numbers and trophy pike, walleye, and brook trout. We have been going to NWO since 1989-1990."
2989793,55walleyes,2014-07-12 20:45:00,131,"Just returned from Blackstone Lake. First 4 days fishing was good but really shut down on Thursday. Not sure why, there was no great change in the weather. Did anyone else struggle on Thursday? No big fish this year but lots of nice walleye."
2990433,Sportdog,2014-07-13 07:42:00,6735,"This was my third trip to Canada this year and we did not do well. The fish were hard to find for most in camp except for the guys that regularly fish river systems, which I do for smallies but not for walleye and pike. Once we did locate walleyes they ran small and not exactly hard and fast action. Caught tons of small pike but none worth bragging about. We fished smallmouth one afternoon and didn't catch many but they were very nice size. Going to get off the river and go to a lake lodge next year. Glad to hear that most folks did well. Congrats!"
2996930,octanehi5,2014-07-15 05:13:00,1104,"We headed to Lake Hebert on the 20th of Jne, Givin the late ice ot this yr , things were abot three weeks behind normal, We did catch some big girls 28,27s 26 25s abot 100 over 20, the rest were slot fish in the 14 to 20 range, totalling 800 Walters, It was my 11th yr on the lake, Average catch rate is 100 fish a day and we met that, After last yr setting my personal best of 900 This yr was average,Or grop was great, Next yr is already on deposit"
2997090,fishron,2014-07-15 06:17:00,317,My group was on Hebert the same week as Octanehi5. We benefited greatly from his advise. We were at opposite ends of the lake and we caught the best big walleyes of any of our trips near camp. We will never get to some of the great lakes in northwestern Ontario due to our location but if we can get on lakes like Hebert within a days drive we will be happy fishermen for years to come.
2998418,troutwater,2014-07-15 12:06:00,299,"Our group fished Cliff July 3rd-12th, but almost exclusively for muskie. We boated the most for a group on our trip up to a 46 incher. We also caught walleye on Cliff on our muskie baits ranging from 19-25 inches. Went across the road to Cedar one day and the walleye is still going strong. I boated a 19.5 on a muskie bait, and had several more still chasing after them. My nephew barely fished for walleye but caught several good eaters and lost a high 30's pike at the boat too on Cedar."
2999266,Knoxabilly,2014-07-15 15:39:00,225,"Most Walleyes over 24"" caught this year in our group then any other year. It was wild, each jig was a chance for a trophy!"
2982537,Mike Kansas,2014-07-10 09:03:00,1463,For those of you who have been to Canada this year how was your trip compared to past years trips? We went to Lac Seul the second week of June and the first week of July and the fishing was as good if not better than years past. Lots of nice Walleye and a higher % of above slot fish than we have had in previous years. We stayed the first trip with Lac Seul lodge at their Black Bay Outpost and the second trip at Lost Island Lodge main camp. Thanks to both camps for their great hospitality and great service. Mike Kansas

2982825,stjoeguy,2014-07-10 10:05:00,979,"Our trip to Lake St. Joseph this year was OK. The fish were scattered, so we didn't have many spots with doubles, triples or one after the other. Of course it is all relative. One of our guys said his definition of a bad day on that lake is 30 fish. We probably averaged 35 fish per day, where some years are 60 or more. The fish were bigger this year with very few small walleyes. Most were in the 17-20 range. Our biggest this year were 31.5"" walleye and 42"" northern. The group 2 weeks ahead of us had their best year ever, so who knows what variables are needed for great fishing. I think high water and a cool late spring shifted the fish from our usual hot spots. I can hardly wait to give it another shot next year!"
2982833,Hump,2014-07-10 10:08:00,578,"We were at Lac Seul. Most everyday was good. Two mornings were the best I have ever had, two of us boated 100, unbelievable. There were alot of 14-15, but a ton of 16-17 and alot over slot. Any fish is better than none!"
2983601,revitup,2014-07-10 13:38:00,140,"Our week was better this year than ever. fished Cedar Lake out of Keystone Lodge, June 7-14. Had my personal best walleye of 32.5"" We counted 27 walleye over 23"" for our group of 8. Plus several in the 18-22"" range. We hit the post spawn activity just right."
2983617,stumcfar,2014-07-10 13:42:00,451,6 of us stayed at Golden Eagle by Ear Falls. It ranked up there as one of our best years for numbers and for big fish. We were there in early June. We had good accommodations and boats and the fishing was great.
2984489,port1042,2014-07-10 19:22:00,509,We had a great week the end of May on Perrault Lake. One evening we ran into a swarm of 17 inch smallmouths. For about 45 minutes we were getting one on nearly every cast! What a great time. Two old fa*ts laughing like a couple of kids as we pulled in one after another on Shad Raps. We did real well with the walleyes too. The northerns were just a little slow. I'd rate the season as excellent -- just a little better than spring 2013.
2984497,Glenman12,2014-07-10 19:24:00,762,"Same thing for us Mike, 3rd week of June on Cedar Lake and it was the best fishing ever...no slot on Cedar but out of your 4 fish limit only one can be over 18 and nobody in our group will keep a fish over 20..me and my partner caught well over 400 fish and at times we were just laughing at how big they consistently were...20, 22 24..at least 20% of the fish we caught were in this range...some of the worst conditions Ive fished in since we used to go up for the opener 30some yrs ago was the Tues of that week.. 42 degrees, 20 mph straight winds and a steady rain..me and my partner went out with a guy in our group whose partner cancelled at the last minute..he has a nice 18ft Alumicraft so it was comfortable for 3 to fish out of..we went to a bay with the wind blowing into it...caught some fish but the bite wasnt really hot..so we went to a bigger bay out of the wind and we just anihilated the walleyes..numbers and size, it was almost ridiculous.. One thing we noticed that Ive wondered if others noticed..the walleyes and northerns were fighting much bigger than their size...our lodge owner said it was because of the water temp being so cool (probably averaged 63)..but weve seen water temps like that in the 2nd week of June and never had fighters like that..maybe MNR threw some PEDs into the lake???"
2984633,packpro,2014-07-10 19:57:00,695,"Our trip 6/7-6/13 this year was the best in 17 for our group. We had one bad weather day, the rest of the time it was cloudy in the high 60's low 70's. As for the fishing.............. More fish than ever. Most of those were overs. We had one spot we could hit in the morning for unders and shore lunch. Got that out of the way in first 20-30 minutes daily. After that, fun fishing all day. We were using jig and minnow and we would start with three generous doz. per man per day. Sometimes we were out by noon. In hindsight, with the bite the that good we should have been experimenting. Hard to think creatively when you are just hammering them at that pace. Too much laughing going on."
