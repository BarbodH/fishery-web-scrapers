3317209,Skywagon,2014-11-19 05:42:00,1106,"Our lake is completely frozen over now, the early cold weather is really making ice. I have not ventured out to measure it yet, but would guess the ice shack will be going out before long. Heard a unconfirmed report this morning of 8 inches of ice in the Red lake area. Fishing season is about to begin (again)."
3318393,Pooch,2014-11-19 12:59:00,4619,"Hey Skywagon,Farm ponds are frozen over already. Safe ice is not far behind already down in the flat lands. I've never seen ponds freezing up this early around here. Then again I've never seen the ground freeze and shut us down so fast as it has done last week. Could be a lot of fish kill come spring if this continues.Be safe up there with all them crazy Canuks.Pooch"
3318665,Golden Eagle,2014-11-19 14:20:00,2642,"What a success story for my neighbor in Carthage, Tennessee. AlGore has turned around that global warming thing."
3318961,Skywagon,2014-11-19 16:35:00,1106,"Gary, it sounds like the guys down your way may break some bones on frozen ground if they fall out of their tree stands this year. May put an end to fall NH3. Connie, that CO2 credits program came just in time to save the day. Hope all this extra wood I am going to have to burn this winter does not cause any problems."
3319553,Golden Eagle,2014-11-19 20:07:00,2642,CO2 sure does boost corn yield. And makes for really nice grass and fast growing trees.
3319665,Pooch,2014-11-19 22:11:00,4619,"that a guy from Tennessee would be out chasing a world record walleye this time of the year rather than playing on the confuser while harassing us poor working stiffs?Already had a friend fall getting up to his deer stand. Broken ribs and an open femur fracture. AND, he is a young, strong and healthy mountain of a man. That fall would have been a real game changer for us old dudes.Not a lot of deer being harvested so far this year in our area. Still making a comeback from the past couple years of disease. Coyotes are becoming plentiful, again. Saw a lot of adult rabbits this harvest. Doubt they make it though the winter with the coyotes rebounding.Single digits and wind here the past couple nights. brrrPooch"
3319761,Golden Eagle,2014-11-20 05:47:00,2642,"Sticking around to cure my furnace from leaking water today. Friday or Monday will be on the Collins River, hunting a Muskie. One big fish will make my day. Do you actually believe the world record walleye was taken from Tennessee? I've seen the photo."
3319921,Pooch,2014-11-20 07:22:00,4619,It looks like you would be just hours away from the area where the next world record could be coming from. Isn't the Dale Hollow area over to the Ozarks kind of a walleye area?Not walleye area? Gotta be Crappies down there somewhere!We need to fish together sometime. Maybe we can even drag that grumpy old Skywagon along for entertainment.Pooch
3319953,Golden Eagle,2014-11-20 07:29:00,2642,Are you trolling for secrets? Dale Hollow holds nice walleyes. Could be a huge one in there or downstream from the dam. Best bet for meeting Skywagon for some fishing would be in the goldfish bowl at Dairy Queen in Dryden. It takes corn and beans to get him out of Ontario. Not the kind of corn we drink in Tennessee.
3320401,Pooch,2014-11-20 11:22:00,4619,"You drink your corn? Dang.... So that's what I've been doing wrong all these years. I've been trying to smoke it all this time. Kept burning my fingers.Skywagon is going to have to learn to make wine out of pine bark, needles and bear poop since he converted to a Canuck. You know he hangs out with some pretty strange characters, don't you? One of them ice fishes in shorts and the other one chases beaver with a plane. These guys ain't right.........We might need to do an intervention sometime.Pooch"
