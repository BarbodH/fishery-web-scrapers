3323457,ftfarms,2014-11-22 06:05:00,444,I have a friend that wants to fish lac suel in the spring. I told him where we use to stay but he want some of the WC members help. What part of the lake to fish and where to stay? Thanks for any help for him. I think he's looking at anytime from opening to the middle of june.

Questions like how big a group, what kind of fishing are they used towhat level of services, boat and motor, cabin, rustic or modern are all things to consider. Happy shopping!"

I've fished that area twice in the past few years and that seems to be what I saw also.I don't have depth of knowledge in that part of the lake and hopefully others who do will step up and help you fellows.All of Lac Seul is good, but it's a big lake and fish do move as the season progresses. All lakes have a rhythm driven by the seasons and all are fairly predictable given the ""type"" of season occurring that year.I personally think June is a hard month to fish Canada as the fish are usually moving from spring to summer haunts and can be about anywhere and not always very cooperative.Pooch"

3336018,BenBeattie,2014-11-29 09:18:00,232,"IMO, june is the best month for walleye fishing on LS. Water temps are up, fish are post spawn and stacked on predictable structure where they actively feed. I see more really high volume days in June than any other month. Also as pooch mentioned, LS is big and different parts of the lake are better in different times of the season. There are always going to be fish to be caught no matter where you are on the lake but there is a definite seasonal migration that occurs, especially with the bigger fish. I can't comment on the western part of the lake but from Manitoba point East I've been guiding walleye on this massive system for a decade now."
