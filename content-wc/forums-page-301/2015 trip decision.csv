3250873,pale ryder,2014-10-17 19:51:00,1937,"I've fished Eagle, LOTW, the Indian chain and Cedar, I like them all, but I like Cedar the most.I've been going to Clark's Northern Lights resort on Cedar for about 8 years.And I highly recommend them.Nice cabins, reasonable rates, nice rental boats,and free bait.Great fishing for walleye, SMB, and musky, with a real chance for a whale.http://clarksresorts.com/northern-lights/index.html"
3250993,KM1,2014-10-17 21:09:00,374,"There are several cabins with showers and bathrooms in them now....pretty new too. Plus, the owners (Gail & Steve) are continuing to improve on the cabins by adding new washroom facilities as each year passes. You can specify that you want a cabin with a bathroom. I was just like you...wasn't sure I would like a centralized bathroom thing....however...it really hasn't been an issue for me at all. Don't let those who talk about the expense scare you. Yes...it is more $$$ than many....but you get more....a lot more. It is a full American plan...three meals a day...you have no cooking, cleaning of fish, nothing but fishing and eating. Food is excellent....as much as you want...all included (thus one reason for a higher expense). Plus....you don't want to come in for lunch (we didn't)...they will take your order and make you a lunch, place it in a lunch bag with your cabin # on it, and you pick it up at breakfast. Guide service...if you want...is also included. Lots of things for that extra cost...let alone the friendly, helpful atmosphere the owners promote. I used to be the same as many....couldn't see spending more than say $400 - $500 for a cabin for a week...per person. That is what we ALWAYS did to keep expenses down....but you are making your own food - cooking, bringing and paying for groceries, cleaning the dishes. None of that at Witch Bay. It only took one trip....one....to Witch Bay....never again will I go back to what we used to do....too many likeable things at Witch Bay. Just sayin...;-)!!!"
3251633,Thompmd,2014-10-18 09:07:00,320,"Of the lakes you mentioned I have only fished LOTW. I did the identical thing with my father for several years and at nearly the same age. We stayed at a camp near Nestor Falls. We did that because he preferred not being solely on an island and enjoyed his day be broken up slightly if he chose or if weather dictated. Something as simple as going to the local town restuarant for a cup of coffee or sitting at the docks lakeside and chatting with either the owners or guests.Fishing wise(we are essentially smallmouth fishermen) we always caught plenty of fish both morning & evening and by just using baits that allowed us to catch multiple species. We never once targeted muskies but always caught several and not including the follows. Walleyes were easy to catch, just a simple jig/minnow and he liked the slower pace of that. The other reason for the area we chose is we take our boat and enjoy a day trip/two to other area lakes for a different experience(Kakagi(often called Crow is crystal clear and loaded with smallmouth/muskies and lots of times you can see them following your baits from a long distance that you cant from LOTW)). Another neat experience would be a day fly in trip.Good Luck"
3251833,SinOrSwim,2014-10-18 10:16:00,1528,"Agreed. That isn't a bad price at all for all meals included. We wouldn't do that with our guys trip since we like the cooking and our menu is very very good. But, I'd like to take my wife at some point and having meals done would be very important. Also, a bathroom in the cabin. That would be a deal breaker for her. Probably for me too to be honest. I don't have any desire to ""rough it"". I did when I was younger but not now."
3251985,KM1,2014-10-18 11:46:00,374,"Yes....if you like the cooking, cleaning-up, and stuff....than it makes sense to save the $$$. I did enjoy the camaraderie that we had when coming in after a morning and afternoon fishing and making lunch/dinner...and planning the next adventure out on the lake. That was fun. Now we do that at breakfast and dinner...talk to other guests....and all that...plus have MUCH more time on the water. All depends on what your looking for. With regard to your wife and a trip....Witch Bay would be great. Thinking of bringing my wife on a second trip next summer....AND have the same concerns as you about the bathroom thing. That is a deal breaker for her for sure. Thus, them having cabins with bathroom facilities is a BIG plus....with more to come each year. I think there goal is to get rid of the centralized bathroom thing for most, if not all, cabins and have them with there own facilities. Have the lake pretty well mapped out with areas that produce fish up to 10.5lbs (31"") and lots of numbers. Well....pretty well mapped out as one can with a lake as large as LOTW (it's HUGE). Drop me a note anytime for points of interest if you decide to go to Witch Bay."
3252009,SinOrSwim,2014-10-18 11:56:00,1528,"Thanks, will do. I took my son on a second trip this summer since he isn't quite old enough to go on our guys trip yet. Went to Hawk Lake and that was teh first time I have done a trip with all meals provided. Absolutely loved it!!!!"
3299746,gmakara,2014-11-11 11:40:00,2,"www.southshorelodge.com on Eagle Lake is a gem. Great Walleye fishing, and Eagle is world renowned for a chance at a muskie. Best part is the best Walleye fishing in their area on Eagle is mid July through end of August so no cold early spring or late fall fishing trips required. Enjoy the long summer days on the lake. Won't break the bank and the best service you will find. The atmosphere is awesome, it's a short 4 minute ride to boat in to the lodge so you and your dad will have the experience of a fly in trip but the convenience and safety of being only an hour from Dryden."
3304737,Seanik,2014-11-13 16:00:00,218,"Hi, This years trip to Thunderstock Lodge at Lake Kenogaming Ontario is a bit of a roll reversal. I'm 75 years old and taking my 49 year old son and 11 year old grandson. I have been doing these annual trips to Canada for over 35 years, my son was busy with a career and raising his family and was only able to do one trip in all that time. My son will bear hunt in the evening and fish during the day, I will fish with my grandson and teach him to enjoy these annual trips. We had to book early to get the first week of bear hunting which starts near the 15th of August. I hope this starts the annual trip tradition with the next 2 generations. Seanik"
3241849,bassin1977,2014-10-14 13:44:00,4,"I am taking my father on a fishing trip next year. He has never been to Canada fishing. I want him to have an enjoyable time and catch lots of walleye and Smallmouth, but I also want a shot at musky. I have my choices narrowed down to Witch Bay Camp, Anderson's Lodge, or one of the less expensive housekeeping camps on Cedar Lake or Eagle Lake. What is everyone's opinion on an ideal first time trip for a 65 year old."

3241905,Obabikon,2014-10-14 14:07:00,2370,"I'll give some rep to Steve at Witch Bay. I'm sure you'll love your trip. Witch Bay has a great reputation, and you'll love the trip. No matter where you end up, you'll have fun!"
3243025,Danbear,2014-10-14 20:37:00,72,Our gang has been going to Birch Dale Lodge on Eagle Lake for 7 years now. This year we had our best year for big walleyes. We always have a ton of fun. Birch Dale won't break your wallet and Marcel does a great job taking care of his guests. They even opened a brand new cabin this year that looks too nice to stay in. The west arm of Eagle lake has plenty of great fishing areas anywhere from 5-20 minutes from the lodge so you don't have to travel far. I know it is mind boggling trying to decide between all the resorts in Ontario but for our money it's Birch Dale.
3243129,KM1,2014-10-14 21:44:00,374,"Witch Bay Camp. An AWESOME place. Gail and Steve are great, fishing for the species you are looking to catch is great, guides are part of the package (if you want to use them), food is top notch. Can't say enough about it.

3247513,3 Z's,2014-10-16 15:02:00,133,"Put me down for another Witch Bay Camp vote.During our week the first of July there are always several seniors in camp, so its not just for us young guys."
3247985,NARDA 1,2014-10-16 18:28:00,636,"I'll second what Danbear said, my group has been going to Birch Dale Lodge for 26 years www.birchdalelodge.com 807-227-5262. The lodge is easy to get to. Cabins are nice with easy access, boats have flat floors with pedestal seats. You won't be disappointed. Terry"
3250249,SinOrSwim,2014-10-17 14:53:00,1528,Witch Bay looks really nice but not sure I'm fond of the central bathroom idea?
3250473,IaDave,2014-10-17 15:58:00,476,"The shower houses are really nice- there are a few scattered throughout the camp. The bathrooms are separate from the shower houses, I saw more than a few guys carrying coffee cans to the bathrooms in the morning. It was a non issue for me as my cabin was about 20 steps from one of the bathrooms."
3250617,ftfarms,2014-10-17 17:01:00,444,I would say cedar lake. I like lotws but I won't pay that much to stay somewhere like witch bay I like to do two- three trips a year to Canada and two trips crappie fishing in wisconson. If your going to lotws you should stay with Jared at obabikon I like that part of the lake. We stay in miles bay but again I'm cheap. But that area is great fishing. (miles bay and obabikon bay). When we fish cedar lake we stay at cedar point resort cause it's centrally located and Rays a great guy. Hope you enjoy your trip where ever you go and god bless.
