Oddly, the 1st fish I caught on it was within seconds of lowering it down and it was an 8 lbs laker...thought I had a biggee eye."
3321313,Pooch,2014-11-20 20:39:00,4619,"Using A LOT more plastic than ten years ago. Spent a fair amount of time this year ""back trolling"" while bouncing large paddle tail minnow imitators on a half ounce jig. They never failed to catch fish and it was a great way to get a bite going after a traditional spinner bite slowed down or quit.Our first trip last summer to Lac Seul Lodge and I was getting my butt handed to me everyday. Could not buy a fish on jig & minnow/leech or trolling spinners or cranks, whatever. Set over areas showing good arches and lots of fish. No bite. Gave up out of desperation and went back though those areas moving and caught fish bouncing the paddle baits. I would have bet (and lost) a lot of money that fish would hit plastic, but not live bait.Later in the season if you stopped and tried to just jig/plastic them, you didn't catch fish. Regular jig and minnow kicked the plastic's butt. Keep the boat moving and results reversed. Plastic seemed to trigger a sometimes vicious strike.It was a nice break from other presentations and I can see doing more of it next year.I think some folks refer to it as snap jigging, but we were keeping the boat moving rather than stopping and casting to a pod of fish.Pooch"
3321425,retire55,2014-11-20 22:17:00,1029,I was introduced to the use of swim baits (5 inch large paddle tail minnow imitators) this summer. Enjoyed success both casting and trolling.
3323569,gordy28,2014-11-22 07:29:00,437,2 new ones for me Dragging jigs which produced my new PB walleye Casting hard and soft swim baits for pike. They were fun but not as successful as spoons and trolling a j 13 Cheers
3323617,Mike Borger,2014-11-22 07:54:00,1554,"No new techniques, but on a couple of trips this year I was able to really refine my deep water jigging tactics for lake trout.Had great success with various plastics on oversized bullet head jigs, as well as heavy jigging spoons.Just like jigging for walleye except the hits are a lot more ferocious. Lots of fun!"
3323753,ohiojmj,2014-11-22 09:46:00,1262,"New (to me) was a Mepps trolling rig with a changeable blade, single hook and an attached treble stinger, shiny pink purple skirt (think woman's flashy new years eve dress) and a standard juicy worm. It worked well at times on the Lake Erie walleye. To drag her down under, I used 2 or 3 oz inline weights. Apparently walleye like flashy short skirt fashions when other lures don't get the slightest glance."
3324769,rather-be-fishin,2014-11-22 22:48:00,429,The Danlure Freedom Jig worked great on Lac Seul. Has a unique swimming action when trolling & produced excellent results for Walleye & Northern when tipped with a minnow or crawler. Check them out @ danlure.com. RBF
