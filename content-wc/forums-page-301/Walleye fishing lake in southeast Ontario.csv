3273058,67ZL1,2014-10-30 08:24:00,277,"Dad and I caught 15-20 walleye in the 14-16"" range. We were using crawler harness' in 18-20 fow. We used the public launch off Ardoch Rd. We didn't get on the lake till about 4:00 PM and fished till 6:00 PM. It took us about 45 min to get a game plan together. We didn't venture past the first major bay as it his lake isn't on Navionics or else we would have stayed much later and explored more. I suspect this May be a early morning or late evening bite lake as when we were heading back, a bunch of guys were just getting set up. This lake is where The new ONIX would really shine as you can create a map instantly."
3273074,67ZL1,2014-10-30 08:27:00,277,"Forgot to mention, I was back there 2nd week in September."
3278266,Moosebunk,2014-11-01 22:51:00,211,"Maybe try Rice...??? Because IMO Big Gull, Crotch, Kash, Missa... they're all just OK at best. Never hear of any incredible catches on Crotch especially. Or, you could consider trying the Ottawa River in pretty well any stretch. From city convenience all the way up to remote-like Mattawa there are places to stay and plenty water to fish."
3244569,Ferrispata,2014-10-15 13:02:00,63,"Hi all, Just trying to do some research on some good lakes to fish walleye in southeastern ontario. I know they don't compare with fly-ins, of which my crew did for the first time this year and loved, but we cannot do fly-ins every year so we will be mixing in trips to this region every year we do not fly-in somewhere. We would be coming through the 1000 Islands region so ideally would like something within ~3 hours from the border there. Something north of Kingston, and east of Toronto. Not interested in Bay of Quinte, so omit that one. We would be looking for a place that has cabins/boats and motors for rent ideally. We have been going to Big Gull Lake and have enjoyed it but would ideally like to catch more than we have been catching there (although every year gets better as we learn the lake better). Thanks in advance."

3246121,MrSimon,2014-10-16 06:38:00,922,"Have you considered fishing the St. Lawrence River? The walleye there are fat as pigs. Not to mention you can catch huge smallies, big northerns, and world class muskie. This past July I caught my biggest walleye ever on the River .... 28.5"" and 9 pounds. It's funny, I do a all these trips to NW Ontario .... and then catch my biggest walleye ever in US waters not 15 minutes from my cottage."
3246481,fishron,2014-10-16 09:09:00,317,"I can't disagree with the St Lawrence river. The biggest bag of monster walleye I have ever seen was caught within sight of the 1000 island bridge on the Canadian side....(at night). The ministry stocks various se Ontario lakes but one they never had to is Wolfe near Westport. Wolfe is the perfect shoal spawning walleye lake. There are numerous shoals around its islands and almost islands. We catch walleye from 6 inches on up through all year classes. When they up to 18 inches they are the prettiest golden walleyes anywhere. There not easy to catch unless the conditions, steady west, south or southwest winds prevail. The water is gin clear. Last trip the biters were in 23 ft of water. They're nothing like the wild walleyes of Hebert, but Wolfe is as natural a walleye lake as you will find anywhere."
3255385,Ferrispata,2014-10-20 18:23:00,63,We are all originally from that area and visit there a few times a year as it is. We try to get a little ways further north.
3257265,mickr,2014-10-21 16:29:00,74,"try Kashwakamak Lake, it is the next lake over from Big Gull and the walleye fishing is better. If you want to drive just a bit further than the 3 hour limit you posted, I can give you a few good recommendations on the Ottawa River where you will get good fishing."
3257433,Ferrispata,2014-10-21 17:36:00,63,I saw Kashwakamack on the map and wondered if the walleye fishing was any good. Do you know of any lodges or cabins for rent with boats and motors. We don't do American plan as we like to bring our own food. And a little over 3 hours from border there would be fine as well. Thanks. Jerry
3257561,67ZL1,2014-10-21 18:21:00,277,Crotch lake is over in that area too. We did pretty good for walleye our first time there. I will definitely be going back there next summer. The problem with those lakes in that area is that they are not on the map chips.
3272762,Ferrispata,2014-10-30 06:27:00,63,What kind of numbers on Crotch Lake the first visit? Thx.
3272770,MrSimon,2014-10-30 06:33:00,922,I fished Crotch a few years back. It is a beautiful lake. Simply stunning scenery. We had excellent smallie fishing. The walleye and pike fishing was mediocre to bad.
