It is catch and release on walleye, you can keep northern or smallmouth but size restrictions apply for both. Youngs lake is only a mile or so past silver dollar on the left side of 599, access is thru Young lake lodge. The owner will allow you launch at his landing for $10.00 if you are not staying at his camp. He seems to be a pretty nice guy. Even though we were not staying at his camp he gave us some place to start and spots to look out for. My son caught over 40 walleyes that afternoon many between 22 - 24 inches. all released as it is catch and release only lake. It is not a large lake, it is on the back side of watcomb if you are familiar with the area. It sees a fair amount of traffic but good for taking some one you just want to put on fish. we used dead minnows and gulp, dead minnows seamed to work slightly better. We had some live minnow and he burned through those pretty quick. PS there is a nice St croix rod and Shimno reel on the bottom of the lake where he set the pole down and a nice fish latched on and jerked it right out of the boat. He felt pretty bad but all I could do was laugh because we were having such a good time. goodluck GF"
