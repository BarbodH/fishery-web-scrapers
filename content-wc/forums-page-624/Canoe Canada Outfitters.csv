571008,Guest,2008-01-24 19:04:00,0,I have hunted with them three times. These are stand up people. When our bear hunt was a bust one year they brought back for free the next year. Cann't say enough good thing about them. You won't be sorry. Abe1
571013,Guest,2008-01-25 12:00:00,0,"Have flown in many times with them. McQuat lake is good for walleye and smallies; adjoining lakes accessible by canoe have some BIG pike. Little Gull is also good, mostly walleye and pike. Never went to Half Moon. Outfitter is good; as good or better than most. A few years back one of their pilots left and started (or bought) Kashabowie Outposts about 20 miles east of Atikokan. We've been going with him for several years and prefer Kashabowie. Canoe Canada's bread and butter is canoe outfitting for groups and the fly-in's seem to take a back seat, but overall, I wouldn't hesitate to go with Bud and Jim at CCO if Kashabowie was booked."
571031,Sean,2008-01-26 09:53:00,160,Made my first trip to Canada in the late 80's to there.Had a great time but we spent too much time canoeing and not enough fishing.Good experience though. I will agree that the people are top notch and wouldn't hesitate to book with them again.Good Luck
571114,Guest,2008-01-30 21:07:00,0,Have looked at Kashabowie - what lakes have you fished and how do you rate them. Thanks.
571126,Guest,2008-01-31 12:59:00,0,"Bemar,Loganberry, Gridrion. Happy with all three. Couldn't say one was better than the others. Slow day would be 10-12 walleye, about the same pike, good day you get tired of counting. I think all lakes are catch and release except what you eat there. Catch and consume they call it. That might be a problem for some. We never bother trying to bring any home so its not an issue. Don Blair and Fern Duquette run a very professional operation. All they do is fly-ins. Camps and equipment is always good shape. Radio phones at all camps for emergencies if necessary."
