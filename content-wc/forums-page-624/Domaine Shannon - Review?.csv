571067,bartidge,2008-01-28 18:11:00,12,Hi All- Has anyone fished this territory that can offer a review? Is it similar to O'Sullivan in terms of quality and size of pike and walleye?? Does it get a similar amount of traffic? How easy is it to move between Lac Seguin and Lac Lenotre and can the River systems be accessed with any success? Like to hear some info... Thx. CB
