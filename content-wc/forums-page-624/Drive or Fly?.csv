570945,Guest,2008-01-22 08:01:00,0,"Have been on both and have caught lots of fish. I would take a look at Harris Bay Resort just north of Ignace. Our group of 8 went there last Sept. It is on Sturgeon lake. We took our boats to several other lakes every day as Sturgeon is not a good walleye lake in the fall. The owner, Claus, is great and will give you maps and tell you where to fish on these out lakes. The resort is really nice with indoor plumbing and even A/C. Check their website out.WWW.harrisbay.com."
570949,Guest,2008-01-22 12:56:00,0,"I agree that both are good choices but it mostly depends on cost. I would go with a fly-in outfitter if you want your sons to have a trip that feels sort of ""exotic."" You could always drive to a resort, stopping and camping on the way, and then fly-out to your resorts outpost."
570950,AllenW,2008-01-22 13:13:00,11482,"If your going for the once in a life time trip, do the fly in. If you think you'll come back on a somewhat regular basis, do the drive in thing. I wouldn't let the lake being big throw ya, most people have problems when they look at a large lake and want to fish all of it, try taking a bay or two and narrow the search area down, you'll do much better.imho I'll second the Red Lake suggestion, but if I was you I'd hire a good guide for a day, they should at least get ya started in where and how to fish that lake. We normally go in late Sept, no bugs, lots of fish and few other fisherman. Either way, I think you'll have a good time. Al"
570952,Guest,2008-01-22 14:12:00,0,"Drive in of Fly in?  You can't go wrong either way. Here are a few differences we've noticed in 25 years of Ontario/Manitoba fly in and drive in trips. Fly In  You can't beat the feeling of solitude/tranquility of having a Canadian lake all to yourselves. No neighbors, the loons seem closer, great sense of adventure. The silence is deafening.  Fishing should be good, but it is not a given. Some lakes are getting a little tired. Expect a lot of action on medium size fish with an occasional wallisaurus. As others have recommended, check out the references.  It's usually a smaller lake, so by the end of the week you should know the lake pretty well. You can find shelter from the wind/waves.  Your rental boat will probably be a 14' or 16' Lund. Maybe only a bench seat. Flat floor, no rod holders, no trolling motor, no anchor, no landing net, no depthfinder, no gps, none of the other goodies you have stashed on your boat. We bring quality clamp on rod holders and transducer bracket. 2 fishermen per boat are best. Three is too crowded. Boat control is a pain with only one in a boat.  Boat might have only a 6 or 9.9 hp motor, but that is usually fast enough for a small lake and slow enough to troll in either direction.  No corner store, so bring your own shore lunch kit, first aid, soap, towels, tools to fix a finicky outboard, anchor rope and wire to secure it to a rock, etc.  Many outfitters will restrict you to 90 pounds per person (heck, by jig box alone nearly weighs that). You food might be included in that total weight. Beer too. Easy on the flashlight batteries. Find out what is the policy for too much weight. How much does if cost and how soon can they make the second drop-off.  You will probably want a portable depthfinder per boat.  You're on your own  you will have the find the fish yourself. I think that is one of the best parts of a fly in. If you are the fishing leader, this can be a burden. No need for pressure if it's supposed to be a vacation. OR, this is part of the challenge and is fun.  The float plane ride is hoot. Looking out the window seeing the lakes and forest is memorable. However, be prepared to be jacked around with your flight times. Many outfitters do not own nor control the flights. You may be asked to be at the dock at 9:00 AM but the plane doesn't show up till noon.  A handy McGuiver type guy is really needed. You're always rigging or fixing something. Drive In  You can bring you own boat and related gear (trolling motor, depthfinder, etc.)  You can hire a guide for a day if you need help finding fish.  A quality trip from Chi town can be done for under a grand per person (including EVERYTHING-lodging, gas, food, bait, etc). Fly in will be more. Don't forget any additional equipment cost that you may need for a fly in. Misc  How many are going? 3 is an odd number for a fly in. Some outfitters may ask you to pay for the 4th anyway.  My favorite time to go is mid June-mid July. You may get lots of other opinions here. Good places are often booked. However, the outfitters are now asking the repeat customers to fork over deposits. Maybe you can get lucky or get on a waiting list.  Lac Seul is as great as everybody says. She can get angry on windy days, but compensates you with numerous and large walleyes. I've fished Rainy and Lake of the Woods, and found LS much easier to find and catch fish.  The pros and cons listed above might seem to favor a drive in, but a fly in trip really adds to the experience.  Not sure how many will be going, just be absolutely sure you invite the right personality. Any slackers will upset the mood of the trip. Oversimplified Analysis (IMHO)  If you want lots of fish and big ones, go to Lac Seul.  The premier Canadian experience can be found in a fly in."
570959,2746,2008-01-22 15:30:00,3206,"Can't beat Saugers analysis so won't try. If it were me (I also have a boat) I would opt for the drive to lake and hire a guide for at least a couple of days. Lac Seul is an excellent choice as 100 fish days are not uncommon. You'll catch lots of fish, get to use your own boat (most fly in's have small uncomfortable boats) and with the guide you'll learn a bunch about finding fish, boat control, fishing techniques etc. that will serve you well on future trips."
570999,Fish_on,2008-01-24 06:26:00,1856,"Many, many good responses on this thread. I have done just about every option Canda has to offer. It would be hard to add much to this thread but there are a couple things. The size of the lake has nothing to do with the size of the fish. Most lakes are either good for numbers, or good for size and it is rare for them to be both. For a fly-in, it's common to be dropped on a lake where you can catch a hundred fish a day but not have anything of any bragging size. Some lakes are good for big fish but not numbers. Some lakes are known for big northerns, etc. We flew into one lake that was loaded with muskies, we got doubles and triples, the biggest of which was about 32 inches. I have also been to a lake where we caught 14-18 inch walleyes at will but nothing over 20 inches. You get the idea. A good operator knows his lakes and can give you an idea what to expect. If the size and number of fish you catch are import you need to ask specific questions and choose accordingly."
571033,Tonyo,2008-01-26 14:37:00,212,"Everyone's opinion and options have been great and need not be repeated. The only thing that I will add is the comfort of your own boat if you go to a drive in lake. We fish Gullrock and the resort we stay at has nice equipment and an 18' upgrade boat but when this lake gets some wind on it, it will get rough. Our group takes 3 boats with us when we go and we all have larger deep v's to combat the lake so we don't miss a single day of fishing. All of them have full windsheilds and tops with full sides. This sounds a little wimpy on our part but the comfort of the size and tops helps on the cold rides out and back in the rain or heavy winds. I'm sure there are other great destinations you can choose from but we are hooked on Gullrock Lake. There are a few camps to choose from and they all seem to very nice. My hope is you find a great lake to explore and make the memories with you boys you are looking for. T."
571036,Guest,2008-01-26 20:18:00,0,"Norts, check out this camp and take a few moments to read about their fishing program. It'll save you a ton of time in learning new water.www.witchbay.com"
571230,Guest,2008-02-06 13:30:00,0,"There is a lot of people on this forum that are extremely high on Lac Suel and because of that I choose it last year for my June trip. I was at a camp near Ear Falls, fished many spots on the NW arm and Mckenzie bay several times, had a guide first 3 days as was our 1st time there. Had good not great fishing, caught walleyes in probably 20 different spots, Mckenzie being the best. My conclusion..will not go back, at least not to the NW arm. Way to many boats!!!! No matter where we went if the fish were there, so was everyone else. Mckenzie bay was crazy, 25 to 30 boats along the sand beach. For some this is obviously not a problem, but when I go to Canada I like a little seclusion, not going on a 1 hour boat ride to play bumper boats. I have been to many many lakes in Canada that are better fisheries and provide the Canadian solitude I desire..jmho"
571237,Richard B,2008-02-06 17:29:00,735,"I would recommend Zups. Zups is on Lac La Croix. Great smallmouth, pike, and decent walleye. You can fly in or portage your boat to the resort. To portage your boat you have 2 different options, go across Crane lake and they will pick the boat up on with a trailer and portage it across dawsons portage, or you can go up the river, very carefully, and take a marine railroad over from Crane lake to Lac La Croix. The group I go up with have taken our boat both ways, we have 20 footers."
571241,GNO,2008-02-06 18:39:00,153,"You can't beat a real good fly in lake North of the Sioux Lookout area. There are alot of different options, but 100 walleyes per person a day are common. Here are a couple of good ones to check outwww.lmflyin.com www.slatefals.com"
571242,Hump,2008-02-06 18:45:00,578,One less boat on Lac Seul.
571246,Guest,2008-02-07 07:33:00,0,>One less boat on Lac Seul. 3 less boats!!!
571247,Guest,2008-02-07 08:56:00,0,"I would have to agree with insguy. Lac Seul, at least the NW part has been beat to death. Too many resorts adding cabins - too many other resorts trailering to Lac Seul. It's still a decent fishery, not what it was just 5-6 years ago, IF you want to take an hour boatride."
570962,Guest,2008-01-22 20:38:00,0,"Lots of good information here, so I will not repeat, but try and add something new. Nothing beats fishing out of a well rigged boat. Unfortunately, most resorts either don't offer a fully rigged and well powered 18 - 20 foot boat, or if they do, they have a limited number of those as guide boats. However, there are a small number of resorts where every boat in the resort is such a premium quality boat, and yes, on bigger lakes (such as Lac Seul) where waves can build in a hurry, bigger is better. I raise this issue for a few reasons, the first of which is because it sounds like you want to fish with three adults out of the same boat. Putting three healthy adults in a 14 footer can be done, but I don't find it very enjoyable unless its pretty calm and we are just jigging. I fish with my 78 year old father and my 15 year old son (who is now 6'3 and getting bigger by the day). Given that I am 200 lbs plus and I have more tackle than a small store, the three of us in a 14 foot resort boat would be like a dozen Skippers on the SS Minnow (she is afloat, but you hope they don't look over the side at the same time). The other reason I raise the issue is that if your find a resort that has preium boats and you enjoy yourself, that is a lot less wear and tear on your own personal boat and trailer. I have trailered boats to Canada and would do so again in a minute if the resort I go to did not have a boat as good as the one I fish out of back home (OK, their's is a better because they replace the boat and engine every two years which I cannot afford to do). But not having to worry about trailering a $40,000 boat on marginal road and gravel logging roads adds to my enjoyment (try changing a trailer tire on 502 at night in the rain for sheer excitement). So, I am lucky, I stay at a resort with exceptional equipment, I get to fish in the day with a guide that knows more about the lake and and how to fish it then I ever will, in the evening I get to take out the boat by myself and enjoy the challenge of trying to ""beat the guide,"" and I don't have to enjoy the cost/challenge/excitement of taking my baby across roads that are better suited to a logging truck. So, that is another take on the question. The good news is that no matter what you decide (drive, fly, boat-in), you will be spending time in God's Country with your sons and no matter where your at, that is a good thing. Enjoy....IA Walleye"
570965,phishfearme,2008-01-23 07:00:00,1242,"norts - my personal feeling is that the fly-in option is THE total experience - but let me suggest a compromise option. you can take your boat and personal gear to a drive in lake for a week - near say ear falls - and during the week take a one day fly-in trip (or 2) to a lake where ""fishing is like it used to be"". faron buckler, for example, at excellent adventures in ear falls has a number of lakes with a boat cache only (NO cabin and NO constant fishing pressure). other outfitters have these lakes also. best of luck, phish"

570926,P. Norts,2008-01-21 15:54:00,396,"(Didn't realize there was a separate forum for Canada until after I posted on the general board. Apologies for the double post.) Background: Have been fishing Rainy Lake (American side) with the family every summer for about 8 years. Love it, but it's taken a long time to learn it because it's so dang huge, and we still haven't fished all of it. Some days are good, and some days we get skunked (unlike the locals). We've learned how to use the electronics fairly well, but we're still not experts at finding and catching fish. There are bazillions of fish in that lake but we often struggle to find them. We do ok, but we're not the type who can consistently head out and find good fish. I'm not complaining - I just love being on the water, but they want to catch fish, and our inexperience shows on a lot of days. My boys (20 and 21) and I want to have a ""Canadian fishing experience,"" one of those in which you catch a lot of fish every day, including some monsters, and we would also like to catch some big Northerns (just because). It was on my mind to find something driveable (say within four to six hours of Int'l Falls) because of our comfort level with our boat (19' Lund) and the electronics. I spoke with a number of people at the All Canada show and I got some very interesting and contrary insights. I also got information overload - I must have picked up two hundred brochures, and it all looks great (naturally). Some made the excellent point that if it's driveable, it's going to be much more heavily fished and therefore less rewarding. They also note that because some of those resorts house dozens, even hundreds, of fisherman each week, the pressure on those lakes diminishes the experience. And, it's worth noting that some of the more popular lakes, such as Lake of the Woods and Lac Seul, are as big as or larger than Rainy, and so all we may have done is to drive further north for the same experience - good, but not great. Those people say that fly-in and outpost experiences are the only way to go, and that having a lake all to yourself is an incredible experience (I can see that). Others suggest that those places are better suited for ""expert"" fishermen who know how to find fish wherever they go, even without electronics, and that we would be more successful at a place further south, with our own equipment and access to a guide if we wish. They also suggest that smaller lakes mean smaller fish - not as many ""holy cow"" experiences. I did also notice that many of those remote places have boats that appear to be too small for three people, and I don't want to split us up. I'm at a loss. I want to hook these boys on this now, while they're young, in the hopes that it can be something we do annually for the next 30 years. Going remote doesn't worry me a bit - I would love a remote outpost fly-in if I can be sure they will be hooked. I need a sure thing fish-wise as well as a life-altering experience for them. It can't be $3000 apiece either since I am paying for all three of us. (Hopefully that will change when they are out of college!) Your thoughts? Drive or fly? Do I really need my own boat, or can we be sure of catching a lot of fish without it? Big lake or small, outpost or resort?"
570928,Guest,2008-01-21 16:56:00,0,"Let me be the first to reply because Im sure you will be getting a ton of responses on this topic. In my opinion, I would go to a drive to camp for your first time and maybe not more than 3-4 hours over the boarder. The comment made to you about smaller lake means smaller fish is ridiculous. The lake I've been going to for 25 yrs is only 6,500 acres and we get 30+"" walleyes, 20+"" smallies every trip. Also one guy in our group who fishes muskies has 5 over 50"" and he's only been going 8 yrs. If I had money invested in a 19Ft Lund, I would bring it. For the most part, the biggest boat most camps have is 16ft. 3 adults in a 16ft boat is doable but could be somewhat cramped with your gear and all. Like I said this is just my opinion and Im sure you will get many many more...good luck with whatever you decide to do."
570929,Guest,2008-01-21 16:57:00,0,"There are lots of good places. I would think a fly in would be a good bet to get your boys hooked. Getting away from the crowds that way. Find an outfitter or lake you like or resort, a good idea, get people who fished that lake recently for ref and verify the fishing. I would recommending asking the outfitter for people (2-3 groups) who been to that lake last year or the year before during the time of year I would want to go."
570930,Guest,2008-01-21 17:11:00,0,Rose will let you know where cliff lake is. just give her a few hours.
570931,Stehle,2008-01-21 17:14:00,95,"I've been going to Allanwater Lodge (www.allanwater.com) for 7 years. It is a nice compromise in a lot of ways. We drive to Rusty Meyers at Savant Lake and then fly in to the camp from there. It is only a 20 minute flight, but there aren't any roads to the camp. You can take the train in and this is a cheaper alternative than flying. The train goes right past the camp. The lake (Kawaweogama) is large enough, but not massive. You can find fish every day, and the owners will help you out with finding the fish. There is no ""American"" plan, only housekeeping. It is a nice camp for a reasonable amount of money. I'm sure there are plenty of camps just like it."
570937,Guest,2008-01-21 21:00:00,0,This post has been up for at least 5 hours and nobody has mentioned LAC SEUL or GULL ROCK. hmmmmm maybe the camp owners are gone to the sport shows.
570938,Guest,2008-01-21 21:43:00,0,"Well I'm not a camp owner, just a guy who likes to fish,. If I wanted a place within 5-6 hours from International falls i'd head to Red Lake. Sure there are lots of people who can drive to it and there are 3 towns on the lake, but unless you go to ""upper chukuni"" falls you won't find a ton of boats fishing in the same place on the lake and it offers a world class fishery. I can say that because Bob Probst Sr.told me and there isn't a much better person to make that claim. YOu can bring your own boat and there are a few lodges on the lake that can accommodate you. Lots of luck on your search and I hope you pick a spot that meets your requirements."
570940,Guest,2008-01-22 06:27:00,0,Another alternative is to boat in to an outpost or resort. One resort that appeals to me is the boat in to Chamberlain Narrows on Lac Seul. (I have never been to the resort and have no connection or financial interest.)I believe its a 40 mile boat trip in the camp boat or you can follow a guide boat in your boat providing your boat is at least 16 foot long with a 40 hp or larger. Lac Seul Outpost price may be somewhat less than a flyin and have less fishing pressure than Rainy Lake.
570942,Obabikon,2008-01-22 06:40:00,2370,"It also depends on cost. There's a large difference in price in some of the different resorts. We're a boat in resort, and those can be pretty cool. If you're wanting a different experience, flyins, outposts, drive to's, american plan... there's a ton of different reasons everyone goes to different resorts/camps."
570944,jigman 2003,2008-01-22 07:05:00,981,"If you're looking for an experience beyond just fishing, I'd recommend a fly-in. Yes, it costs more (not much difference between a fly-in and an American Plan drive in though), but it's worth it IMHO. You can get good fishing on a drive in, but generally speaking you'll do better on a fly-in. I can personally attest that some fly-ins aren't as good as a good drive in. ALWAYS get references from at least 6 people. Be very specific on what you want. What a fly in gives you that a drive in does not is incredible solitude. Having a lake to yourselves is an experience that everyone should have. Seeing the bush from the air is also something to experience. If catching 50-100 walleyes a day (everyday) and a chance at big pike is your main goal, I'd have to recommend a fly-in. If you could do a drive in around the opener, you could also get that experience if you do your homework."
