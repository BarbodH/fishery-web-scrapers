571048,esgrams,2008-01-28 07:47:00,92,"Morning--Wondering if the netting pressure had been lower in '07 compared to the previous years, never made it up last year due to a career change and I heard rumors to the fact. Mainly around Stoney, Hay Island and Stevens..Thanks"
571052,Obabikon,2008-01-28 10:01:00,2370,"Well... we're not quite Sabaskong, but close. Out of the Morson area. I only saw one net all year, and it was marked appropriately. The real problem was all the illegal netting going on, and I belive that has been cracked down on."
571054,esgrams,2008-01-28 10:26:00,92,"They usually had a net coming off the NW corner of Hay Island--Possibly you didn't get over there this past season..Side-Note,,I'd like to swing out and fish your area, but I'd have to carry a bunch of additional gas as we are coming out of Nestor and I only have an 11 gallon tank. And with the price of fuel, you won't be seeing me anytime soon---Do you transport your supplies out in the winter or by barge during the seson?"
571061,Obabikon,2008-01-28 14:16:00,2370,"A little of both... supplies like sand, soil, lumber, etc... over the ice. Gas we have barged in. It's quite a boat ride, and I stay away from Hay Island. The crappie and walleye fishing is as good or better in Miles Bay/Obabikon Lake so we don't make the long trip for fun. If you do ever make it to our neck of the woods, stop by and have a cup of coffee."
571073,esgrams,2008-01-28 22:15:00,92,"So how do the cottage owners get there propane--Do they have a regular delivery route in the winter months, or do they barge that in as well. Thanks for the offer for the coffee, I will defintely take you up on it, if I get a wild hair and buzz out that far- Eric"

Thanks for the offer for the coffee, I >will defintely take you up on it, if I get a wild hair and >buzz out that far- Eric That's up to them. The Detwiler's (wonderful people) do a ton of propane on their barge over the summer... so most people do it that route."
571078,rpieske,2008-01-29 07:40:00,1276,"I definitely saw fewer nets last year in the Sabaskong, Stevens, Stoney Bay areas. Especially illegal nets. Since the processing plant closed down in Kenora there seems to be less netting. It was my understanding that the guy who owned the processing plant was shut down due to accepting fish beyond quotas for certain lakes. The netters took the easy way out and were taking almost all their fish from LOTW while claiming they were taken from other lakes more difficult to net, but part of the quota lakes. Results...LOTW was really hammered until they shut the guy down. Hope it stays shut down. I did see quite a few abandoned nets early in the spring. Probably trapped under the ice all winter. Not a pretty sight."
571084,Bill Krejca,2008-01-29 10:35:00,6107,"I was out in the evening last Sep, 2 boats putting in nets. One was east of Hay, the other by 3 Sisters - SE of Hay, it must have been 3/8 of a mile long. Didn't see any markers, but didn't get real close."
571088,esgrams,2008-01-29 13:27:00,92,"Typical, When the set the nets in the evening. Do they then retrieve them the next morning or after a predetermined period of time?"
