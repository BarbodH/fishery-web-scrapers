571179,Guest,2008-02-03 15:47:00,0,Atiken or Atikwa two different lakse I think.
571108,GNO,2008-01-30 17:07:00,153,It must be true then if it's on there website.
571113,Guest,2008-01-30 20:46:00,0,"My neighbor's dad put a cabin on Atikwa in the early 50's. Obviously he has a bit of experience on that lake. He's probably fished that lake more than any white man. He has seen many lodge owners come and go on the pond, only one resort I believe. He says this present owner is a super good guy. As far as the fishing he says it terrible and please don't go."
571115,GNO,2008-01-30 22:02:00,153,"It can't be terrible, there website says it's simply fantastic."
571119,Juls,2008-01-31 07:21:00,13414,He was kidding... :fishhit:
571120,Obabikon,2008-01-31 07:45:00,2370,">It must be true then if it's on there website. Well, Todd is trustworthy and has a huge return clientel. You don't get that from lying about the fishing. Also, I was attempting to help with the question..."
571121,Guest,2008-01-31 10:09:00,0,I dont doubt its got good trout fishing. But comparing its trout fishing to like walleye fishing in other lakes... What kind of walleye lake are they comparing to the trout is the real question?
571135,Guest,2008-01-31 20:45:00,0,"If you want the scoop on atikwa send me a email and i can help, been going there for 35 years.I will even tell you some good spots..."
571155,Guest,2008-02-01 18:58:00,0,"Send email address on AAtikwa Lake.Although mostly lakers fishermen, are there some Walleye to be had? Gunder"
571171,Guest,2008-02-03 08:33:00,0,"Sept 07 me and 3 friends caught and released 62 trout in 2 hrs.Biggest was 10lb next 9 ,the rest 3 to 5. All caught jigging in45 to 75 ft. HONEST TO gOD TRUTH! Fantastic Trout fishing .Yes!"
571176,Guest,2008-02-03 14:06:00,0,"Catching 62 Lake Trout in two hours is fantastic(no need to put in quotes). I SHALL VERY HAPPILY RELAY THIS ""STRIKE"" OF FISHING NEWS TO MY FISHING PARTNER, AN AVID LAKER FISHERMAN. AS PREVIOUSLY STATED I AND THREE OTHERS ARE BOOKED WITH MATTICE LAKE OUTFITTERS TO SPEND ONE WEEK AT ""TROUTFLY' 100 MILES NORTH OF ARMSTRONG. ATIKEN IT IS IN THE FUTURE, F O R S U R E. THANK YOU FOR THIS CONFIRING NEWS. GUNDER"
571058,Guest,2008-01-28 12:46:00,0,"Atikwa claims to have ""fantastic"" Laker fishing. I have been taken in once by a claim to have ""great walleye fishing, huge size"" in flyin in NW Ontario, and this claim makes me leary of the claim. Please advise. Gunder"
571064,v-bay gord,2008-01-28 15:50:00,3168,"I have fished it in the winter and would consider the lake trout fishing to be very good. Whether it is ""fantasic"" would have to be based on your expectations....maybe you think catching one, or one hundred fish is fantastic. Plenty of room for interpretation. Why not just ask the lodge owner what he means by the phrase? Nobody is going to promote their business by saying it is ""o.k. fishing"" or ""pretty good"". You might also consider some other factors (other than quantity of fish) that might make it a ""fantastic"" experience....it is a beautiful lake for example, and it has solitude."
571066,Guest,2008-01-28 16:41:00,0,"Your re0ly put me "" in my place"", my eldest daughter and I laughing while I read it. I am a long time ""Laker"" fisherman, beginning around 1972. I have fished a truly fantastic lake for Lake Trout in Northern Manitoba, where after one week one of my #38 silver Suttons continued to be hit even after all the sliver was gone and it was bent out of shape(I still have it).The lake is Etwanny. Anyway, I thoroghly enjoyed your reply, even if you, I am sure, did not mean to be humorous. But it was a ""gas"". Gunder."
571068,Guest,2008-01-28 18:56:00,0,What are expectations for a good laker trip in NW Ontario. I might have some suggestions for you. Are looking for a lodge or can it be an outpost?
571070,Guest,2008-01-28 19:17:00,0,"In late June I and three others are flying out with Mattice Lake Outfitters to Troutfly, that has Lakers, Whitefish and Brookies, I shall see how that first time experience goes. My parnter and I are always willing to try new places, especially if the Lake trout fishing is very good. We have fished some lakes hard knowing that it is very diffcult to catch them. So, we are always open minded to try other lakes, lodge or outpost. Gunder"
571071,v-bay gord,2008-01-28 19:22:00,3168,"Glad you found the response enlightening. Obviously you have the time on the water to know what is what. Your experience would likely mean you could probably teach the lodge owner a few tricks as to catching trout. I think you would do well on Atikwa lake, but by no means comparible to N. Manitoba. Probably the price difference is a good gauge in comparing apples to apples. Set your expectations accordingly and you would probably have a gas (your phrase, I believe). It is a good sized lake and there is potential for some quality fish."
571087,Guest,2008-01-29 13:11:00,0,I would take a look at Gateway North Outfitters. They have a few different options for lakers and I think you would be happy with the fishing. www.gatewaynorthoutfitters.net
571100,Obabikon,2008-01-30 10:51:00,2370,"I will highly recommend Atikwa. While I've never been there, I had the pleasure of being next to Todd at the Minneapolis All Canada show. It looks like a great resort, and it's run by a fantastic owner. Also, any time there's a chance of boating 40+lbs lakers, it's a pretty good lake trout lake. Give it a shot, and let us know how it goes!"
571105,Guest,2008-01-30 14:07:00,0,"I highly doubt Atikwa will produce any trout in that range, the only lake that is a conatant producer of some monster lakers is Clearwater West. I would still say your odds aren't great, but it does have them and they catch some 30#+ monsters every winter and it does hold some Ontario ice fishing line class reords."
571106,Obabikon,2008-01-30 14:36:00,2370,"I am almost certain that Todd said they boat at least one 40 every year... maybe my memory is wrong, and he said 30... but I'm pretty sure he said 40. Also, they boast that they catch lake trout like most lakes catch walleyes... fast action. Also, here's what their website says... ""Our lake trout fishing is ""simply fantastic"" --- Atikwa is one of the best, if not the best, lake trout lake fishery in all of Ontario. Our guests say that ""lake trout fishing on Atikwa is like walleye fishing on other lakes simply fantastic."""
