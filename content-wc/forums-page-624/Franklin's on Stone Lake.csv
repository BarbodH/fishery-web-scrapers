571141,NAV165,2008-02-01 13:29:00,412,Any feedback on Franklin's on Stone Lake camp? I heard some good things about some remote access lakes and was wondering about the fishing and cabins. The cost seems reasonable but from the web-site it's hard to know what to expect.
571153,Capn Hooker,2008-02-01 16:05:00,333,"Fishing on Stone Lake is good and the remote lakes where Franklin has boats are very good. Cabins are ""OK"". Don't expect a lot of service from Franklin and absolutely avoid him if he has been drinking. If you want to take your one trophy Walleye, pike or musky, do not let him know or he will go absolutely bananas. If you always do what you've always done,You'll always be whom you've always been.

571193,2746,2008-02-04 15:21:00,3206,We see a for sale sign on the road leading to Stone when we go by. Is this the camp that's for sale?
571198,Capn Hooker,2008-02-05 15:07:00,333,"I had heard a couple years ago that Franklin was thinking of selling, so chances are it is. I have friends that know him but after my last experience up there I have not asked about him. I'll check into it. It could be a great place to go if it had some TLC and someone running it with some good customer service sense. I'd go back there if someone new had it and the prices were kept in line. As I said before, the fishing is very good. If you always do what you've always done,You'll always be whom you've always been.

571204,2746,2008-02-05 17:06:00,3206,"If my memory serves me, Stone was the first trip I ever made to Canada to fish 40 years ago. Camps, of course, have come a long way since then as have the equipment provided. It was a very basic operation back then but decent fishing in Stone and, as I recall, some really good walley fishing in a lake we traveled a bit to get to. I'm thinking it was Dixie or Little Dixie."

571212,Guest,2008-02-06 09:50:00,0,"I too have been up to Stone Lake several times but not for the last 5-8 years. Yes the fishing on all the lakes where he has boats on is good. Some lakes require a 30-40 minute hike in but well worth it for the fishing & beautiful scenery & wildlfe. Cabins are not the best kept up but who cares when you are having a great time during the day and sitting out at night watching the shooting stars with a beer in your hand while talking about the day's fishing & tomrrow's planned lake to fish. I was going up to the camp before Franklin became the manager & part owner to it. I knew him when he was younger fresher and before the hard life of running a candian camp 12 months a year tired him out. From some of the notes about him, if I ran the camp for so many years I too probably would get tired & cranky. The time's I've been there, Frankin & his wife were nice even though Franklin can get testy when it comes to keeping the larger fish. He is passionate about catch & release for the larger fish and only keep the smaller walleyes for dinner. He is concerned about canadian lakes getting fished out and some sportsman not having enough respect for canadian lakes, wilderness, wildlife and the environment. If you stay on his good side, you will have a great time and spend some fun times with him as well. I certainly think he has a good point about respecting the environment, lakes & all. He is personally trying to keep Stone Lake to catch & relase to build it back up. I understand that the camp may be up for sale. Upgrading the camp & running it is a hard job and probably needs someone new who is young with energy & fresh ideas. It is probably a great buy for someone like this. The times I've been up there, I & my family with children had a great time. My kids who are now 18 & 16 y/o's still talk about their great trip to Stone Lake Camp & Canada. I am currently thinking about going back up there with a group this year. July, August & early September is my favorite times due to good warmer weather but the fishing for bigger fish is better in early spring & late fall. I personally enjoy being up there for the things beyond catching a lot of big fish. Being on lakes without other boats around you & watching wildlfe on the shores of the lake is what I am up there for. Walleyes & Norrhterns are easy to catch if you know what you are doing. I even like dragging a lure or minnow behind the boat while trolling slow in the rivers & creeks and catching lots of 4-7 lb. northerns that fight like heck. I throw them back in, of course but a great time especially if using a light rod with no more than 6 lb. test. I hate to tell you about some of the hike in lakes he has boats on because they are are really good beyond what you can think or imagine for many reasons. I would hate to go up there to find the boats on these walk in lakes being used & I can't get on due to popularity; so I'll just be quiet on this."

His website is www.franklinstonelake.com but location is not noted on the site. If you always do what you've always done,You'll always be whom you've always been.

571263,Guest,2008-02-07 19:11:00,0,Not to many pictures on the website either. unless you want to buy some furniture. what kind of equipment does he have? how big is the lake? how many cabins does he have? Is he helpful about the fishing? thanx in advance
571293,Capn Hooker,2008-02-08 20:31:00,333,"It's been a few years since I've been up there, but then the boats were aluminum with bench seats, the motors were small but adequate, and that's a good thing because if you go to one of the remote lakes you have to carry your motor & gas. Stone Lake is a decent size but not big and remote lakes are usually somewhat smaller. I don't remember how many cabins he has. If you ask him, he'll tell you where to fish the lake and he'll take you out for a guide fee. If you always do what you've always done,You'll always be whom you've always been.
