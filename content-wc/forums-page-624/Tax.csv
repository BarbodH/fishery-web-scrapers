State tax - 5.5% City tax - 1.5% Lodging tax - 5% Occupancy tax - 4.48% adds up to 16.48% GST and PST stink, but both governments stick it to travelers."

571265,Guest,2008-02-07 21:29:00,0,How much tax do you get back at the border ???
571266,Obabikon,2008-02-08 06:42:00,2370,"Well... I've heard mixed reports... it's supposed to be around 3%. But, some people have been having a tough time getting it back."
571267,phishfearme,2008-02-08 07:25:00,1242,it's easy to tax travelers - they usually can't vote you out of office. phish

571269,Guest,2008-02-08 08:54:00,0,"Very valid point. At the very least which helps, the GST is a 1% lower from last year and if you qualify for the 1/2 back GST rebate it doesnt make it feel as harsh."
571272,Obabikon,2008-02-08 09:03:00,2370,You're right Range and Phish... I guess my point is it works both ways in both countries. Has anyone been to Disney in the last couple of years? I bet they tax the heck out of people.
571283,Guest,2008-02-08 16:22:00,0,Come back next year and it will probally be even higher if the city council gets it's way. Looking to increase the lodging tax to pay for the new or remodeled baseball stadium. 60+ million to do all of this and have already pissed away mass loads just thinking about it. Thanks to the Collage World Series!
571285,Guest,2008-02-08 17:20:00,0,"Disney doesn't need to tax.....have you been down there recently, they print thier own money. But I can't complain to loudly, I'm taking my grandkids in March. My hope is to be voted into the grandpa hall of fame when I get old enough. Lac Seul, July 4th....it can't come soon enough!!!"
