570936,Pooch,2008-01-21 20:17:00,4619,"We used to fish Seseganaga years ago. Pretty decent lake. Seems to get a fair amount of pressure as I think there are three camps and maybe a couple outpost cabins on it. Apparently the lake can handle the pressure. Seseganaga is an interesting lake with a ton of places that will hold fish on any given day. Last time we were there my wife and I came upon a fairly large flat and caught fish till our arms were tired. Not a boat around anywhere that we could see. We have flown to other camps using Rusty Meyers out of Savant before and found them to be good people. Have not stayed in any of their own camps or outpost though. From looking at their website, I would probably choose them over the camp we used years ago, if going to Seseganaga. Good luck and I'd really like to hear back from you if you choose Seseganaga. My first trip to Canada was to this lake so I have good memories of it. Pooch in Central Illinois"

All I can say is that they are great people and they make the extra effort to keep you on schedule. A case in point, three years ago there was a sizable storm system move through the night before we flew out of camp. It downed trees all over the area, which probably helped fuel last springs forest fires in Savant Lake. The people from Rusty's spent the entire early morning clearing the three miles of road to 599 from their camp. We got out at 10 that morning and you could tell the crew was exhausted."
571128,thunderatwork,2008-01-31 14:55:00,79,"never fished those two lakes, however i am booked this summer with rusty myers for my sixth fly-in(third lake) with them. several factors for the repeat business. As close as any, near the same price as most,the food package is great,facilities are as good as any for a fly-in,and nice people to deal with. Its hard for a man to say this, but rusty myers is run by a lady(Angie),and i think maybe that is part of the difference. she runs a good operation. Why the moving around? The first lake i was on(metionga) i was a part of a group that has disbanded, and could not get back on that lake with my new group. Also i get bored fishing the same water each year. I just got an e-mail and there appears to be an opening on metionga now! Jump on it for lots of walleyes. the last time i was their-sept of '06- everyone in the group of eight caught a 25"" or bigger walleye(I had three) and good numbers. It is catch and consume only, if that makes a difference."
