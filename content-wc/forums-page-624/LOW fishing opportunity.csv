571258,Guest,2008-02-07 17:30:00,0,Looking for 2 die hard Musky fisherman. I am heading to Canada June21 to June28 and Sept27to Oct4 and am looking for someone to share a private cabin for the week. Ideally looking for two people with one boat. The cabin is located 12miles NE of the Northwest Angle Inlet angle. The cabin is situated on prime fishing water. I have been fishing this area for ten years and know the area well. This would be a great opportunity if you are fishing Canada for the first time. The cabin cost is $75.00 per person per night. Do not miss this opportunity. Email me. [email protected]
