571183,Guest,2008-02-03 21:28:00,0,"Plowboy, the truth is the truth we have a walleye tourny up here every Labour day weekend, out of 150 boats maybe 5 fish Gullrock,It's not because GR dosen't have alot of fish it's because the fish run bigger on Red Lake. Now Red Lake is bigger, so if you do the math it should have more & bigger fish and less pressure because there would be more spots to fish because of it's size. Oh what business are you talking about eh."
571186,AllenW,2008-02-04 06:47:00,11482,"Nobody fishes Red in the early spring??? May 24 though the 31 is where we're gonna be there, staying at Chukuni camp grounds probably, anybody gonna be up there then?? Always up to meet new people if your in the area. Al"
571187,Goldeneagle,2008-02-04 08:34:00,78,"Al, will you be among the bank to bank boats at the bridge? Lots of walleyes hang out there. We'll be flying from the Chukuni on May 16 and out May 31. Help me out in case I run out of gas and money on the way back home. Good luck fishing."
571189,AllenW,2008-02-04 09:49:00,11482,"If you mean the bridge right next to the campgrounds, ya it does get crowded there, but no, we don't fish there, we'll prob hit a few shallow bays and see if the big northerns are in the shallow water sunning them selfs. We've also hit a few northerns before off Forestry point, along with walleyes and around the island is always good. Its a big lake, lots of places to go. We also have a few other places we go for walleyes that are less crowded, we have a friend who has a place on the lake and we'll see what he says also. I'm thinking the deep water fishing we do in the late fall may have to be altered to shallower water in spring...maybe? :) If your in camp stop by and say hi, just look for a couple of older guys in a black 185 Alumacraft tourney sport with a 150 Yammie on it. Al"
571191,Goldeneagle,2008-02-04 13:35:00,78,I'm going into Little Vermilion May 16 and out the morning of May 31. It's going to be tough to make contact. Are you going to ride Ralf's ultra-lite aircraft?
571192,AllenW,2008-02-04 14:53:00,11482,"Ultralight? Naw, I prob max out the weight limit by myself, much less having a death wish...:) I think he'd just got that last time we were there in 05 or 06 if I remember right, looks like fun, just not for me. Well, if ya do get by (or anyone else in fact) stop by, we'll leave a light on.. :) Al"
570783,AllenW,2008-01-16 07:17:00,11482,"Been going to Red for many years, but its almost always been in the late fall, fishing buddy wants to go this coming spring and mentioned June, just wonder if early or later in the month might be better or maybe it doesn't make any difference?? Trying to make it after walleye spawn and although we're going mostly for northerns this time, would like to catch a few walleyes. I just can't remember what June is like up there, hoping you guys can help, tia. I did the search thing but really didn't find anything that helped. Al"
570813,Guest,2008-01-16 15:19:00,0,June on the Red is Catfish Heaven...Don't laugh ... try it. You can catch 15 to 25LB Cats all day. The last ime we went my friend caught over 60 Cats his first day with all being 15 to 25LBS. I have Walleye fished in June on the Red and it is SLOW.
570832,AllenW,2008-01-17 07:19:00,11482,"Thanks, might not have been clear, I meant Red Lake, is this what your referring to? Never caught a cat there."
570838,Guest,2008-01-17 10:18:00,0,"I use to own a camp on Gullrock so I know this area, I think Red Lake has the edge up here. Bigger lake (more fish) less pressure (less boats) last year was the first summer I fished Red and found it didn't matter what month fishing was good. But late Aug.into Sept. the monsters come out!"
570845,AllenW,2008-01-17 11:33:00,11482,"Thanks Bud, we normally go late Sept, but it was for walleyes, this time we'd like to catch a few to eat, but we're thinking the big northerns should be biting in spring then....we hope.. :) We're having troubles getting my partners vacation nailed down, might even end up with the last week in may. Al"
570850,Guest,2008-01-17 12:42:00,0,"The last week of May or earlier would be my choose for big northerns.But don't ask me where to go, I don't fish for northern."
570851,Guest,2008-01-17 13:02:00,0,Glad to see you came home for the icefishing season Bud. Kinda hard to drill holes in the ice from florida.

570862,Guest,2008-01-17 17:21:00,0,"Merry Christmas and Happy New years, Billy hope that Buck worked out okay for you. FLA. was great I might get hooked on that salt water fishing. But it's good to be back in Red Lake."
571180,Guest,2008-02-03 15:58:00,0,Jeez Bud - I can remember when you had a much different viewpoint....not trying to promote your business on Red Lake now are ya? Nah....I don't suppose even you'd do that....cause you're out of the camp business now.....right??????
