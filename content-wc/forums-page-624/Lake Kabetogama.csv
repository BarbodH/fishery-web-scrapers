571107,Guest,2008-01-30 16:45:00,0,I know tis is site for Canada and I am still going to make my annual trip to Ontario. Highlight of my summer. I live in Minnesota- so was also thinking of a trip to border lake of Lake Kabetogama. Would be less driving- two trips to Canada tough for me. Am I correct thinking more pressure and on average less fish per day on Kabetogama? Can anyone comment on the this lake and the differences with fishing in Canada? Thank you. Again- I will never quit going up to Canada- it is God's country! Walleye Scott

They changed the slots to mirror Rainy Lake, with a promise of creating a fishery like Rainy. Should work. Beautiful scenery, protected bays, close to civilization. I recommend Birchwood Resort, but the other resorts up there are good to go. A site you may want to check out is fishing minnesota dot com. Their forums are specific to Kabby. Many local experts chime in with very useful info."
571118,Guest,2008-01-31 06:16:00,0,"In general, I've found the walleye bite on Kabby to be slightly slower, than as some of the more common and moderately pressured NW Ontario lakes. It does offer a good population of walleye, with decent numbers and sizes. However, Kabby can also be quite intimidating to those that aren't familiar with walleye summertime movements, patterns, etc., so you might consider a guide for a couple days. Resort owners will usually provide clients with some info but it can be dated -- and Kabby regulars are some of the tightest-lipped anglers I've ever seen, when it comes to the latest walleye and crappie spots (so another reason for a guide?). Kabby is not noted for large numbers of smallmouth or northern, although you'll catch a few here and there -- just not like you can on Rainy, Namakin or NW Ontario lakes. So if you want to to fish other species, Rainy might be better, and it's a fairly long boat ride to run from Kabby to Rainy. Chuck"
571125,Guest,2008-01-31 12:51:00,0,"Went a few years back. Very disappointed with fishing. Even with a guide for the first two days, NO, as in ZERO, fish. Even the guide didn't catch any. Next four days TOTAL number of fish for 7 guys was around 20 fish. Lots of fishermen and pressure. Fished out of Arrowhead Lodge. Great accomodations, restaurant, bar, boats, etc. Very happy with that part. Hopefully its gotten better."

As mentioned earlier there is another site with good info on Kab. Fishing isn't and shouldn't be like McDonalds, instant gratifacation. You should be willing to learn your lake, relax, spend some time, relax, view the scenery, relax, oh and did I suggest slowing down and taking life slower?? Fishing is not a job and shouldn't be treated as one with the pressures to ""limit"" out for a trip to be successfull."
571131,MK,2008-01-31 16:13:00,322,"Someone sounds like my wife. To our group of guys, catching fish is a very desirable part of our ""fishing trips."" Relaxation and sightseeing is nice, but its optional. Driving 14 hours for a fishing trip and catching no fish but enjoying the scenery is like kissing your sister. We still laugh and have decided that Kabetogama is an old Indian word for ""big lake with no fish"". Who knows, maybe we hit it on a bad week?"
571134,prov1900,2008-01-31 18:54:00,544,"Right on Dutchboy. That is why I go there. Yeah, it isn't Lac Seul, but you don't have to be a good or even average fisherman to score at Seul. See if you are as good as you think you are. I do it all the time. I have had Lac Seul like days at Kabetogama. They are possible. If not, drive farther north. Doesn't really matter. Most Kab resorts are probably booked solid. There is a reason for that."
