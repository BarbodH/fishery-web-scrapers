570625,Guest,2008-01-10 08:16:00,0,"Stayed there 5 years ago at the outpost. Nice people. The cabin, or more specifically, the dock needed work, but was satisfactory. We caught all the fish we wanted including a 51"" muskie. It was a great trip- very beautiful spot. The only reason we did not go back is the Naughty Pines Camp. It is just up river from the outpost. When we were there that camp had burned. We had the river almost to ourselves. I am not sure how many more boats there are now, but we got spoiled. The water was very low that year. We had our best luck in Johnson Lake. I am happy to answer any questions if I can. Good Luck."
570677,Guest,2008-01-11 23:02:00,0,"We fished it for about 10 years back when Dave and Sue owned it. For a drive in we always caught a lot of fish, seemed to depend alot on the water levels on the English. The first lake Branston was a very good lake however most people cruise right on down the river. It had good Walleye, smallmouth and Northern. By the dam alway produced walleye, and depending on water level across the bay from Fatty creek produced nice Bass and walleye. Also the bay by the small falls produced fish. Near the rapids was seasonal. Wegg lake was where the Muskys lurk and if you find the part called moose head(look at map features) there was great northern fishing. Clear lake was pretty but always a waste of our time. Johnson lake was a little better then Clear. Goose was a good smallie lake especally the southeastern part. Wilcox lake, good walleye where the Longlegged dumps in, on the south side of this lake I caught my largest Pike 44"". We also walked around by Oak Falls and caught walleye from the shore. Unexpected lake on the west and north side is good for Pike and walleye however it is about 15 miles down stream. We had a great time on this river system and caught some very nice fish, we also back packed into a number of lakes up the Longlegged and overnight road. We havent been back since 95, we just needed a change!"

570741,Guest,2008-01-14 21:00:00,0,"Fatty Creek is located in the first bay to the right,dumps in from Fatty Lake, very shallow back there, fish the south and west part of this bay. Cast the large rocks for smallies, troll shoreline for walleyes. If the water level is way down dont fish this area. The little falls dumps into the first bay to the left on the south side. As you leave the channel on the left side on the point, cast it for Smallies from there to the big rock ledge(there are a couple of private cabins Here).From there troll the bay for walleye around until you get to the liitle falls. Sometimes it is a steady flow,sometimes just a trickle. Orange, yellows and perch were good colors. If your into northern the Johnson weedless spoon and pork rind worked great on this river system."

I will be at camp the first week of June staying in cabin #2. Feel free to stop by and we can talk about some of the good spots to hit. The English River offers some great fishing, even when the water level is low as it has been for several of the past years. Good luck and maybe we'll see you in June. Don"
