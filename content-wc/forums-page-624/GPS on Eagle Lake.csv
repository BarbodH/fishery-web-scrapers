We will generally be fishing at the West arm part of the lake and was wondering if a GPS was a necessity. If so any recommendations on the GPS or places to fish that time of year for Walleyes and smallies. Thanks M.G."

I've fished a number of Ontario lakes over the years and Eagle has always been the most challenging for me to get around on. For me I would want a GPS.....there would be others that have a better sense of direction and map reading skills that could get along without but it's a lake with lots of Islands and we always traveled a fair distance to find fish. A GPS that accepts a map would be the best choice and a hand held would be in the $250-300 range. Lowrance makes a good one but there are lots of choices. As to places to fish I'd have to know better where you will be. what lodge?"

We fish in the Iowa Bay area for walleye, Violet Lake for walleye and off the rocks on the way to trout hole #1 (yup, that is the name of the area) and get good sized lakers. We also go up a creek to Clearwater Lake (some maps call it Delaney Lake) for lake trout. there is some walleye in there too but I've never caught one. The trout are usually about 3 to 4pounds and are just the right size for the frying pan. I always take my hand held gps and have another one in my boat. the lake is full of reefs that are unmarked since there are no navigational marker buoys on the lake. Be sure to buy a map from the camp you stay at since they have a good map available to them from a local printer. If I were you, I'd hire a guide for the first couple days and mark your spots on the gps. The fishing isn't spectacular, but the scenery is and when you get a fish it's usually a good one. I've caught smallies near H49 (thats an island) and northerns around railway bay, but I've also caught trout and walleye in that area too. Last year one of the guys inour group got a 55"" musky, too bad it was out of season and it took 8 hours of recuperation time in a creek for it to come back for release. What camp are you booked into? Who knows, maybe we'll meet on the lake."

I run my GPS all the time I'm out, it'll let me where I've been and more importantly how to get back. I also keep a compass in the boat just in case. If you fish at night and a fog rolls in, either of these in your boat will be invaluable. Al"
571009,Capn Hooker,2008-01-24 20:08:00,333,"Don't leave home without one. A GPS is a must if you're going to go any distance from your resort. I did without one a couple of times but stayed within a few miles of the resort. Night fishing is not allowed on Eagle Lake.

571239,Guest,2008-02-06 18:30:00,0,"Navionics Canada chip will have Eagle on it, would recommend. We fished it for many years without, but having one makes it alot easier. Round & Strawberry Islands are good spots, Meyers Bay can be good in May/June, also Canoe Narrrows area (I have a 30"" on my wall from there). If you can get up Clearwater Creek, definitely make the trip back to Clearwater Lake, great lake trout fishing and they aren't so deep early season."
