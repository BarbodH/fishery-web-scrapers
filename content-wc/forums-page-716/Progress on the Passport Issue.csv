Representing the North Western Ontario Business Partnership, Jerry Fisher, who also owns Grassy Narrows Lodge, was among a group of 30 people from across the United States (Vermont to Washington), as well as a few from Canada, who gathered for the Borders for Economic Security, Trade and Tourism (BESTT) conference. The purpose of the conference was to more clearly define a position on the passport legislation, talk about alternatives, and take that message to Congress. And Fisher said he came away from the U.S. capital with some encouraging news after meeting Friday with Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner (Wis.), the author of HR 418The Real ID billwhich calls for standardized state-issued identification, generally in the form of a driver's licence or state-issued ID. I really got some good news, enthused Fisher. He [Sensenbrenner] told me he was willing to entertain the thought of adding a line on the driver's licence that would indicate a person's place of birth, which is basically what we're looking for. And it meets the criteria for WHTI, he added, referring to the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiativea federal mandate that the Secretary of Homeland Security develop and implement a plan to require U.S. citizens and foreign nationals to present a passport to enter the country. It's a relatively new development and we haven't really had a chance to react to it, Fisher admitted. But we have things in place to see if that, in fact, can be accomplished. What I suggested to Sensenbrenner's representative at that meeting was that Michigan was willing to be the test state for the Real ID' driver's licence, and in fact would be willing to foot the bill to implement it there, added Fisher. Michigan is the state where the passport issue could have the greatest economic impact. They have a lot to lose. Fisher said it's difficult to say if the Real ID bill actually will be changed to allow for driver's licences with places of birth on them to be acceptable forms of ID at the U.S. border after the WHTI is fully implemented by Jan. 1, 2008, but that it looks encouraging. It really would solve the problem, he remarked. It meets the objective of the coalition and it removes the onerous passport requirement that will be costing Canada, especially us in the northwest. [Northwestern Ontario tourism operators] are 90 percent dependent on the U.S. traveller to vacation in our area, and they're just not going to do it if it's going to cost them $100 [to get a passport], Fisher stressed. It will especially affect the spontaneous travelthe people who want to come across at the last minute, he warned. If it's going to take six weeks to get a passport, they're not going to come across anymore. Fisher also noted many U.S citizens have a misconception the passport requirement is something the Canadian government is implementing. They think it's one more thing Canada is doing to keep them from coming across, he remarked, adding BESTT has to strive to spread the truth. Fisher also said he stressed to Philip Kiko, general counsel and chief of staff for Sensenbrenner, the economic impact Canada has on the economy of Wisconsin, to the tune of 103,000 jobs. Fisher suggested to the BESTT coalition that it determine Canada's economic impact on all states and expand its communications with non-border states, such as Florida, where more tourism dollars are generated by Canada than anywhere else. We really have to make them more aware of what BESTT is pushing and the Real ID' so they can prepare and change their licences to the Real ID' criteria, he remarked. Speaking more generally of BESTT and other meetings with U.S. politicians, Fisher said the visit definitely was worthwhile. I'm optimistic about the meeting with Sensenbrenner, but even if that hadn't happened, that fact so many people came from across the United States and Canada . . . it had a #### of an impact on the Congressmen, he noted. I think we're going to see progress, even if it isn't with this Real ID,' Fisher added. I think [the politicians] are aware they're going to have step back and make sure everything is done right. It has such a monstrous impact on the economy of the United States. While Fisher stayed in Washington all last week, the BESTT conference actually lasted just two days. Last Monday (Feb. 13), members spent the morning developing a position paper, noted Fisher. The position paper had seven bullet points all intended to raise awareness of the economic impact the WHTI will have on cross-border trade. The position statement noted the BESTT coalition supports secure border crossing solutions that: acknowledge and address the economic impact of any proposed solution; include a multi-lateral approach to border management processes; fund extensive marketing and public awareness efforts; provide a common implementation rate for all types of crossings; describe a clear standard for crossing; are inexpensive and easily accessible; and facilitate cultural, educational, and economic exchange, especially for students and families. Then that afternoon, BESTT delegates met with Congressional staff. During our afternoon meetings at the Congressional staff luncheon, two Power Point presentations were given, focusing on the value of cross-border economy and giving them a sense of how the everyday life of border communities would be affected by [the] WHTI, Fisher said. The following day (Feb. 14), the delegates were divided into eight groups and called on Congressional members' offices. Some visits were scheduled while others were drop-ins, noted Fisher. Together, the eight groups visited a total of 200 offices. The group Fisher was part of visited nine offices, including Rep. Thomas Reynolds (New York), Sen. Chuck Schumer (New York), Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (New York), Sen. Ted Kennedy (Massachusetts), Rep. Don Young (Alaska), Rep. Mike Simpson (Idaho), Rep. Earl Pomeroy (North Dakota), Rep. Steve King (Iowa), Rep. Thomas Allen (Maine), and Sen. Russ Feingold (Wisconsin). At these meetings, the groups handed out information packages, including: a description of the BESTT coalition; the position paper; information from the Canadian Embassy that showed the economic impact of Canada trade on every state in the union; and a request that a Department of Homeland Security complete a cost benefit analysis of the WHTI since the Office of Management and Budgets threshold of affecting cross-border trade by more than $100 million per year was exceeded. This last one is a position Rep. Louise M. Slaughter (New York) has been pushing, noted Fisher. It was obvious that Congressional staff had very little knowledge of the economic impact to other states outside their area, said Fisher. For example it was not known that Canadians spend as much or more in Florida than U.S. visitors. Another point made was the inclusion of Canada in talks relating to border security, said Fisher. Our contacts were fairly familiar with the issues from the constituents' perspective and were generally respective to our suggestions, he noted. Fisher said at the wrap-up meeting last Tuesday night, it was obvious that the group was going to continue to grow and become a much more powerful voice for the economic impact of cross-border trade. The coalition is evolving into a group that will be able to shape how border security is improved yet cross-border trade is not adversely impacted, he stressed. There will be a follow-up conference call after all the information gathered from the trip has been organized, noted Fisher, adding plans already are underway for another visit to Washington, likely in the next month or two."
