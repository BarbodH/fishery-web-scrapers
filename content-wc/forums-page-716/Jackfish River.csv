554885,pistol_pete,2006-02-23 16:48:00,7,Does anyone know anything about the Jackfish river and fishing for walleyes on it? It is located on the North end of Lake Nipigon and is supposed to be a top spot for walleyes in the world. I read that some places take a jet boat 5 miles up the river and catch 400-500 fish in a day. Is there any where to get a normal boat up into the river a little bit? Or can you fish the mouth of the river where it enters the lake? If anyone has fished there or has any information please let me know! Thanks. -Pete
554886,Guest,2006-02-23 17:13:00,0,Walleye fishing is closed at the mouth of the Jackfish and the area immediately upstream all year long. Refer to OMNR regulations for details. NWO Fishing Bum
554891,toby,2006-02-23 19:38:00,49,Not so NWO!! WE fish it every year in my 18' lund/115. Its a 35 mile run up Nipigon from the onamon river and you don't need a jet.The jet boat has a camp up river through the whitewater.I think my lund might make it and I might try it this year.500 walleye days are common if you fish a full day. There is a 2 fish limit on ombabika bay where the jackfish is located. The jackfish flowage was created by the Ogoki reservoir which reversed the flow of the jackfish to backfeed lake nipigon for more water for the hydros.This massive artificial flowage has created a walleye fishery second to none and nobody fishes it.

554895,pistol_pete,2006-02-23 20:14:00,7,"Toby, Thanks for the great info on Jackfish. How would you fish them during the opening season of June 10th in the river? -Pete"
554896,toby,2006-02-23 20:19:00,49,There is a huge current. You simply anchor in the eddys and use heavy jigs 1/2 and 3/4 with plastic.IN the narrower parts of the river i am 2/3 throttle to stay even with a 115

554905,pistol_pete,2006-02-23 22:56:00,7,"Thanks again Toby, By the way, I am milton's kid so I will see you up on Nipigon early this summer. I am really excited to go up. It has a been a couple years since I've been out on a trip because baseball has taken up a lot of my time. We used to canoe up to Lake Agnes in Quetico and catch 100's of Lakers in a day, but only in the 2-5 pound range. What are the average size of Lakers and walleyes you get on Nipigon and what is the largest of both you have landed? -Pete"
