554805,Guest,2006-02-22 18:38:00,0,"I would choose Pipestone lake, because you don't have the traffic that you would on have on LOW, there aren't any roads to Pipestone lake, just a mechanical lift to bring you from clearwater to pipestone. I like the Smallmouth bass and Muskie fishing on Pipestone, But We stay up the lake from Pipestone Lodge at Happy Landing Lodge. We looked at both resorts a couple of years ago when our group was looking for a new area. Pipestone Lodge looked ok, but we like the idea of having seperate bedrooms and 2 bathrooms in the cabins plus we go in late june and Happy Landing offered air conditioned cabins. HL just seemed to be a little nicer resort. Along with the main lake pipestone they have a Great walleye lake behind them call Yoke. This lake is the highlight of our trip, we go late june when the walleyes are just getting to the reefs on yoke. We have timed it right the last few years and we catch tons of nice walleyes along with some giants, we just use lindy rigs with leechs and the walleyes can't stay away. We fish with dylan, tully, keith and our party of 6 has a blast. We go for 4 nights and fish yoke the 1st and 3rd day, with pipestone in the middle. You would love their boats, they run 17'6"" lund outfitters with 50hp hondas. Check them out at www.happylandingfishing.com I have been going for 3 years and it gets better every time."
