Found some deep holes anywhere from 80 to 120 feet deep and tried not to drift. We dropped sonars straight down and reeled straight up pretty fast. With 6 guys fishing there were numerous times when we would have 4 to all 6 of us with fish on at a time. Great place, but it is hard to get to, however I think it is worth it. Anyone have any experiences there?"
