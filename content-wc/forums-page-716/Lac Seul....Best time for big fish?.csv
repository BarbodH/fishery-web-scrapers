554760,Mr.BigEyes,2006-02-21 14:02:00,169,"Hey all you fellow Lac Seul enthusiasts, When do you all think is the best time of year to tie into a huge walleye? Been there 3 out of the last four years and been there in May, July and September. If I remember correctly the trip in July throwing into the shallows seemed to be our most productive big fish trip. Anyone else....and can a guy find a 31"" eye in Lac Seul?"
554762,Guest,2006-02-21 16:33:00,0,"I can tell you that the absolute best time to go to Lac Seul is the week before, and then the week after I am on any lake. I am going to be there on June 10 for a week, and on Pipestone Chain the last week of August, so plan your trip accordingly!!!!! Whoever is going June 4th through 9th will have 200 fish days minimum!!!!!!!!"
554767,patrick,2006-02-21 18:38:00,277,"july and aug. has been my best time for big eyes, that being said if I was togo for the best chance at a big eye I would target july 15 th to aug 15 , it might not be the best for some but its been the best for me , hope this helps, rick"
554769,Guest,2006-02-21 19:38:00,0,"The right time to be a LS is anytime you can. Seriously, at the resort we go the log all the big fish and virtually every month a 30 inch or better fish is caught. From the data, the best time is fall, Aug 15 on, but you can catch a great fish any time. Two years ago my 11-year old son caught a 30 and 1/4 inch fish while casting a crank bank into about 4 feet during the second week of June. That is our biggest on LS so far, but we have loads of 26 - 29, its just they get really special to be 30+. This will be my 8th year, but I can only get enough vacation time for one week in Canada a year. The dream year would be a week in June, a week in July, a week in August, and a week in early Sept to really compare how the fishing changes. Enjoy your time on the water...IA Walley"
554772,Guest,2006-02-21 21:10:00,0,"Lac Seul is not known for BIG Walleye. A big Walleye there is anything over 29"". Having said that you can catch 23"" to 27"" fish anytime and once in a while all the time, which I dont think is too bad a Walleye. Based on my experience (20 yrs LS) the best chance to catch a Big Walleye is in August and September. Seems that the big girls will group up in deeper water on the ledges in August and September and when you find those spots you can catch several nice fish. Biggest I have ever caughton LS in Sept....33"""

554774,Guest,2006-02-21 22:09:00,0,"Actually IA walleye, from about August 20th onward this past year was lousy for the biggest fish. Plenty of volume, but few fish over 25"". The majority of big fish were boated in mid-season (late-June and July, first week of Aug). But you're right, in other years, more big fish have indeed been boated in late-season, when you consider the angling effort. If you know the site where the volume by size is broken down by months (2005 on there now) . . . people should always consider the angling effort if you're comparing numbers by month. The one 31"" was boated by the female in a young couple who are well-seasoned guests to Lac Seul and repeatedly boat large numbers. They bring thier own boat and go out on their own for long periods and work big fish spots long and hard. They got that fish around 5:20 p.m., after working the same stretch of shoreline almost the entire day. It was the second fish they had caught all afternoon. They were working super-slow in 47', lindy-rigging. The other option at that time was a slow backtroll in 20-27' with jigs, but you could boat 24's and 25's all day long. With guests, you can usually convince them to go out deep and slow for a few hours, but if you don't get one, you have to go back to some action, for at least a while. Although, I know you (IA Walleye) would be one to target the big fish for awhile. The kids on the other hand . . . There are of course plenty of times when the big fish are lumped in with the smaller and mid-sized fish, and that is one trend worth noting. In general (AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT FISHING THEORY IS ALWAYS JUST ""IN GENERAL"", THERE'S MORE EXAMPLES THAN NOT WHERE FISH ARE JUST NOT WHERE THEY'RE 'SUUPOSE TO BE') fish of all sizes tend to be found more often in the same location during the spring and transition, and more often in separate locations later in the season. ANYWAY, back to the original question. I think I get asked that question more often than anything: ""When is the best time to come [for the big fish]?"" And the correct answer is it's not so much about season or month as a whole on a long-term trend (i.e., there is no right answer). If you can think about it this way, seasonality (as related to fish behaviour/angling success) is a very ""macro-variable"", and though there may be trends over a long term if someone had that kind of data, they would be very weak. In other words, IT VARIES!! That is (good or bad) the answer. It varies by season (for example, if you look at that site I'm referring to, you see a number, I think it's 81 walleyes 29""+, in 2000 that number was about the same, in 2001 about 100, in 2003 around 150). Big fish production also varies by month, as you can see, which I guess is directly related to the question at hand. More importantly, that monthly variation varies from year-to-year, as I eluded to above. On a more micro-scale, you have variation in big fish production as a function of weather or of location, and often the most significant, a function of both weather and location. In simple terms, the biggest factors influencing big fish production at a given time is the weather in preceding days, the weather on that day, the wind direction, locations which offer suitable structure at the appropriate depth, depth itself, presentation (speed, flash, colour, bait, etc). This is all regression analysis by the way for all you statistic buffs. So it's more about the micro-scale variables, than the macro-scale variables like seasonality. HA! I'm laughing at myself! Can you tell I've been doing solid stats for month! It's sickening but true . . . that's why I need spring and open-water; to do what I love (and no more cursed computer screen). So that is obviously not the answer I give my guests. The simple answer is big fish production, and fish production in general, goes up and down quite rapidly. You could have it 'decent', with high pressure and light westerlies, get a small spike with increased easterlies with an approaching warm front attached to a low pressure system, get rained on with the warm front passing and have moderate production, get increasing production with warmer, southerly flows, reaching the highest levels of production with warm , stronger and stronger southwesterlies preceding an approaching cold front, get off the lake while the thunderstorms pass and get a final crack at decent production with northwesterlies blowing the cold front out, and then have brutal production for three days after the cold front, with cold, dry arctic air dominating. That's the fishing life of a passing traditional low pressure system, which the most dominant weather maker in our atmosphere, and it may occur in 2 to 5 days depending on the speed of the system. Then of course there is troughs of low pressure, ridges of high pressure, occluded fronts and lots of other anomolies that keep meterorology as far from being an exact science as fishing! But these factors tend to affect fish production on a 2-5 day interval, and most fishing vacations are 3-7 days long, so you may have it good for the whole trip, it may be good then lousy, lousy then good, and unfortuneately, if you get unlucky, it may be lousy the entire time. That's why you should always keep coming back (because it will never be bad all the time, hahahaha)! That's a really long way of saying it's more about what's happening with the fish that week during you stay, than it is about which month you select. NWO Fishing Bum"
