554785,NAV165,2006-02-22 10:55:00,412,I have a chance to stay at Crowduck Lake Lodge for a week this August. I've researched the area as best I can and I have a few questions. 1) Is it possible to get sick of catching a couple hundred walleyes a day for a week straight? It doesn't seem likely that you will catch much else. 2) Is there someplace to go that you can catch some walleyes to eat while there? 3) How much pressure is on the lake with people that portage in and fly-ins from other lodges? 4) How are the cabins? Boats? Motors? I searched the achive and the most current information is from 2003 so I was looking for opinions and some updated information. Seems like you drive by and are near to some good fishing areas and I hate to spend a week on one lake wishing I was elsewhere. Thanks for the information and opinions.

A little history on the lake: The lake was managed for many years as a smallmouth fishery & some bonus pike . Then about 10 years ago, the walleye population seemed to explode. I beleive there was extensive stocking efforts that contributed to this. People came back with stories of 200 fish days, many over 28 inches. The last five years or so, have seen the overall size of the walleyes go down a bit, lot's of fish up to about 24 inches with the odd bigger one. It is beleived that the enforced C&R regulations are contributing to the walleyes eating themselves out of house & home. The once famous smallmouth fishery is also no more. However, if you like catching tons of fish, this is a great place to be. I think Big Whiteshell Lodge or Resort offers day trips to Crowduck. There are also a lot of other lakes in the area that offer great smallmouth & decent pike fishing. It's still an amazing fishery and it's relatively close to Winnipeg."

Crowduck still has smallmouth. Cast some shallow divers into bays with rock outrcroppings with a dead jackpine overhanging the water and you will have some fun. Locals (like me) have over 100 boats along the shoreline of a bay for day trips. It is a fun lake to fish and quite easy on the ego.... There are also pike in the lake. The lake is huge. Take a trip to Crowduck Falls, quite nice and good fishing. Below the falls and down the Winnipeg River a bit, is Eaglenest Lodge. You may want to check it out if you like the area."

I have guided for Eaglenest full and part time for the last 8 years, and have done numerous fly in's to crowduck. The fishing pressure is not an issue, as the lake is huge, Eaglenest only has four boats in there, and Pine Island lodge only has about five or six."

It is pretty much no brainer walleye fishing. Linited northerns and not that big. There are some areas with decent bass fishing, although it is not a place you would go if smallies were your priority. What it is - a big beautiful Canadian lake with excellent walleye fishing, very nice accomodations and great, helpful staff. For the price it's a good deal. We go on one or two outpost trips each summer but I'll also definitely go back to Crowduck."
