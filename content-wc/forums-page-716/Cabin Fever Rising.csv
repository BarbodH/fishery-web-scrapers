Last night I spent three hours going through all my fishing tackle and setting aside what I need for my Walleye trip in June. I also began perusing my Cabelas catalog for those new items which I know will cause Walleyes to jump in my boat. My sweet wife noticed the symptons and drove to the ""Booze Barn"" to pick up some LaBlatts since she knows that it sometimes serves as an antidote to Cabin Fever......I hope she got enough. Has anyone else noticed any symptons? P.S. Mine started just after eating the last Walleye in our freezer."

I've got my tackle bags packed, my reels oiled and watch the fishing shows for 4 hours each saturday and sunday. Thank heaven I'll be in Winnipeg for the boat show in March. By the way, I'm doing Bud light. ( it was left by my American neighbours) and it can't be wasted."

I need to put new line on my reels and oil them and I'll be ready. 62 degrees F in Central Iowa today. Went to the sports how here last week....watch as many of the shows as I can."
554922,JimH,2006-02-24 15:37:00,320,"Now imagine my plight, stuck here in SE Wi, my REAL Labatts cases full of empties and no beautiful Canadian wilderness until late July.:( Here's to a great fishing year:cheers:"
554924,czy42strokes,2006-02-24 16:36:00,419,I have a closet full of stuff I want to mount on the boat and it is in storage. Cabelas must have a mean streak as I get a magazine a week now from them. I even looked at my Interstate batteries on the shelf in the garage and wondered if I should check the water in them. Can't wait for ice out..
554933,Guest,2006-02-25 09:36:00,0,I'm in the Minneapolis area and if I were on Gullrock I would have to be out there fishing. I would be psyched for late ice/spring and chasing some monster pike. In any event it is LOTW for me in early July and I've been looking for bargins on Rapalas etc to rebuild the tackle box. Echo on the Labatts and Walleye. In fact I ordered a great pan fried walleye the other night at a restaurant...excellent! I am sick of winter!
