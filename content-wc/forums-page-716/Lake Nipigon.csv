554874,Guest,2006-02-23 11:48:00,0,Thanks for the information. Are Humbolt and Ombabika bays part of Nipigon? How far upriver is the camp from the lake itself? Sorry about all the questions but this seems like an adventure I would like to try.
554876,toby,2006-02-23 12:50:00,49,4 miles down onaman to Humbolt bay on nipigon--ombabika bay also on nipigon. Ombabika bay alone is 22 miles long. This lake is definitely the big leagues.Go to Google earth and you can see very good detail of the lake.
554892,milton,2006-02-23 19:42:00,15,"Toby, Thanks for the info you gave on Nipigon. It has been about 8 years since I have fished there. Back then, I fished the south and west sides of the lake in early to mid June. I went about 3 or 4 years in a row but the group I was with quit going. Every year,I dream about going back up there. Looks like this will be the year. Yesterday,I called the guy at Onaman River Resort and booked a cabin for 6 of us June 9-13. I'm bringing my 19 year old son and one or two of my fishing buddies. Milton"
554894,toby,2006-02-23 19:58:00,49,I will be there with my two sons age 17 15.We will be able to help you out. You need to look at the Jackfish river posting i just left.
554904,milton,2006-02-23 22:31:00,15,"Toby, I just read your post on the Jackfish. In my e-mail, I forgot to mention that cold water, big waves AND strong current scare me. Do you have or use a kicker on the back of your boat? Milton"
554916,Xplorer,2006-02-24 13:29:00,244,"milton, I am curious to know if you would mind sharing a little info on the west side that you fished previously, specifically the area near wabinosh that you mentioned (kopka river inflow area). I have camped up past wabinosh on pesidji about a half dozen times, but not in the last 5 years, usually the end of may/first 2 weeks of June. I have on several occasions seen boats come up thru the rapids from Nipigon into wabinosh, and have wondered what the fishing would be like in that area of the big lake... lakers, eyes and spec's? Any info you would care to share would be appreciated. If you want to send direct via email let me know."
554926,page,2006-02-24 17:01:00,6,I don't believe you can get to Nipigon from Wabinosh. Well you probably could but it would be a one way trip only. The rapids are bad and we were warned not to even go near them. If you could get there the walleye season doesn't open until June 10th on Nipigon. Have any of you ever fished Cheeseman or do you know if there is a way to get on it? We are going to fish around Gull Bay May 22-27 and are looking for some walleye lake options. Thanks.
554716,milton,2006-02-19 09:49:00,15,"I am planing a trip to Lake Nipigon this summer. Does anyone know of a good place to stay on the lake? I would also consider setting up camp on one of the many islands. It is such a big lake that it might be nice to set up camp near where we want to fish. If you know of any info about the lake, I would apreciate it. Milton"
554720,toby,2006-02-19 14:53:00,49,www.onamanriverresort.com is the only information you need
554731,milton,2006-02-19 21:40:00,15,Thanks for the link. It looks like a great place to start. Have you ever used this resort or their services? Do you have any info you can share on Nipigon? I haven't been there for about 8-10 years. I always fished the south and west shores up to Wabinosh. Never been to the east or North. Milton
554743,toby,2006-02-20 21:27:00,49,"I will be arriving at onaman june 8 for 9 days. Its clean cheap and as far as the fishing it is hands down the best fishing in all of ontario period. Last july we caught and released a 40lb laker 36lb laker an 8lb brookie 5 northerns over 42"" 144walleyes in 4 hours. The 36lb. trout on the website was ours. As you probably know this lake is not for the novice but the rewards are second to none. The pretenders always end up in camp after one blow on this lake. Its a 30 mile run up a miserable logging road and if you make it you will have no regrets."
554775,milton,2006-02-21 23:06:00,15,"Toby, Thanks for the info. Just curious, why are you going in June this year when you did so well last July? Milton"

554780,Guest,2006-02-22 09:37:00,0,"Toby , Just curious about this area. Do you bring your own boats up and if so what size are they? How far out on Nipigon are you running to get into good fishing? I have fished some large bodies of water like Lake of the Woods and Lac Seul but Nipigon looks like a big step up from these. Have you ever fished any of the nearby lakes where you walk in and use a stored boat? Is fishing in the Onaman river any good? Thanks in advance for any help you can give me."

554782,toby,2006-02-22 10:21:00,49,"We travel in a motorhome and pull an 18' lund. We are going in junebecause the 30""plus walleyes seem to be more vulnerable early. We will return last week of july also.There are tons of smaller lakes in the area that we fish when we get blown off Nipigon.The resort has small portage boats and trailers for the side trips.Didnt fish the Onaman but Humbolt bay is unbelieveable,not to mention Ombabika bay.76 miles was our longest one day round trip. WE also trailered the lund to smaller lakes.The lake landings are primitive to say the least, 4 wheel drive only.If dust, mud and a few scratches bother you stay away."
