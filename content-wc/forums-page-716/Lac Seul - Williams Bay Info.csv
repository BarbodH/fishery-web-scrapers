554871,Guest,2006-02-23 10:34:00,0,"Williams Bay is located on the ""southwest-central"" edge of Lac Seul. It is essentially a bay on Lac Seul, with the entrance to the main lake at the north end. To the west and north is where Williams Creek enters the bay, which is fed by Williams Lake. There is Williams Lake Lodge, but then you are not on Lac Seul and it is a long trip down the creek and through the bay before you hit LS. Right around the corner from the entrance to Williams, right on LS, is Silver Water Wheel Lodge. You can try phoning but getting in for '06 is unlikely. However, you can get on the waiting list, and you may be able to get squeezed in, especially if you can go on short notice if there is a cancellation. Other than that, it's a long haul from anywhere else: either 15-20 miles down from lodges on the west end (located on the road up to Ear Falls), or about 20 miles from Mahkwa and the new ""Lac Seul Outfitters"", both of which are located on the reserve. That is why is it the best part of Lac Seul to fish . . . it has the fewest fishermen!! NWO Fishing Bum"

No it's not right on LS, but it's only an easy 7 mile trip through the river that has no hazards and only takes about 15 minutes to get to the main lake. The 35 Yammaha's are a nice feature on their roomy 17' boats equiped with depth sounder and pedestal seats. Previous 15 years we were flying in out of Red Lake catchin lots of smaller eyes. Heard lots of great things about Lac Seul and decided to give it a try. Glad I did. I'd rather catch 50 - 70 fish a day in the 22""+ range than 100 17-18 inchers. Taking my son for the first time this year. Can't wait,finally have someone to drive my fat butt around all day. Good luck!:cheers:"
