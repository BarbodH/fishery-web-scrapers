As this will be the first time up in that neck of the woods(we usually go to the Kenora area) does anyone have any suggestions on where to start out fishing this lake and what methods may be best at that time of year. What depth would be a good one to start at? We`ll be targeting walleyes mainly with catch and release of any large ones. I won`t turn down any in the slot for eating. If we can catch some large northerns I wouldn`t turn them down either. Is there any chance of catching an occasional Laker at that time of year and if so, by what method? We`ll be staying at TimberEdge Lodge. Has anyone has any experience with that camp? How is the ride over to Minnitaki from Butterfly Lake- any problems with a bigger boat in the channel? Are there any interesting things to see at Souix Lookout? How is the road getting up there? Thanks ahead of time. Chris"

Have not caught any lakers but have not fished for them much. When we did we looked for them on electronics in very deep water, 100 feet total, fished maybe 60 feet down with big jigs. The stories are that Minnitaki has some big lakers. We have seen some in the freezer at the camp. We`ll be staying at TimberEdge >Lodge. Has anyone has any experience with that camp? How is >the ride over to Minnitaki from Butterfly Lake- any problems >with a bigger boat in the channel? We stayed there four years. Service and cabins are good. The only beef I have is that it is a long way to good fishing waters. Have never done much at all in Lyons Bay, we go thru it all the way to the main basin of Minnitaki. No problems getting thru the channel for the last three years when the water level was high. If water is low you just have to go slow, maybe tilt up the motor, hope nobody comes thru the other way. Are there any interesting >things to see at Souix Lookout? We never even go into Sioux Lookout unless absolutely necessary. Takes away from fishing time. How is the road getting up >there? Thanks ahead of time. 502 is rough for about the last 20 miles before the turn to Dryden. There is usually someone broken down somewhere along that road. The other roads are fine. Dryden has a real nice restaurant we like to stop at, called Kupfer's. Hope you have a good time. > >Chris"
554734,Mohleye,2006-02-20 12:04:00,368,"I was at Minnitaki once in August, a few years ago. The walleye fishing was extremely slow, so I can't help you there. The lack of walleye did cause us to pursue the trout a few afternoons. Lyon's Bay is an excellent spot. In August they are pretty deep, and not real active. Downriggers will get you to the right depth, but we didn't catch any that way. My guess is we were trolling too fast for inactive fish. The method we finally used to catch a few was, a frozen sisco fished at 50 or 60', whatever depth we were marking them, under a large slip bobber. This only worked in a light breeze, which again makes me think the trout were pretty inactive. My buddy caught a 22 lb'er in Lyon's Bay, and we caught several others."
554740,Guest,2006-02-20 18:49:00,0,"early August can be tricky, by end of August generally they are working the reefs and can be excellent fishing/ Trout in Lyons bay as previous post, although we've had our best luck vertical jigging with minnow tipping a jig. depth varies, typical trout are pretty nice 14# or better. Not familiar with the camp you mentioned we come in from Abram Lake. Not much to do in Sioux Lookout, quess they have a golf course"
554754,Guest,2006-02-21 10:05:00,0,"I have a cabin on Big V just up the road. been going there for years and am familiar the area very well. play golf there to. had the family up there last august and did good on walleye and pike but it is summer fishing pattern all the way. i typically spend 3 or 4 days on minnataki, then a couple on big v and couple on lac suel contact me directly if you need anything specific but there is quite a bit in town to do for a family or for the guys.[email protected]"
554759,lazyk,2006-02-21 13:50:00,26,"Thanks for the feedback. It sounds like I need to bring some downriggers for the lake trout. Where did you get the frozen ciscoes?Has anyone noticed if leeches are any better than nightcrawlers for walleyes? We have had a lot of luck with spinner rigs and crawlers over the years. Any color better than others? Is Minnitaki a clear or stained lake? Is it hard to get to Vermillion Lake by boat and is it worth the trip? One thing that I like about the area is that there appears to be lots of room to explore. Has there been any netting in the area? As an aside, get one of those electric mosquito zappers for the boat. They work great on those pesky ankle biting flies that tend to hang around the bottom of the boat. Chris"

Where did you get the frozen >ciscoes?Has anyone noticed if leeches are any better than >nightcrawlers for walleyes? Haven't used leeches at all. I don't think the guy at Timber Edge has them, although you can go get them if you want. We have mainly used minnows, used nightcrawlers very little, although others who fish spinner rigs use crawlers exclusively. Once last year in a spot where we were getting regular hits from jigs + minnows, we got exactly 1/2 as many hits per unit time on jigs + Gulp. We have had a lot of luck with >spinner rigs and crawlers over the years. Any color better >than others? Is Minnitaki a clear or stained lake? Minnitaki is pretty stained. Usually use white jigs as a result. Is it >hard to get to Vermillion Lake by boat and is it worth the >trip? One thing that I like about the area is that there >appears to be lots of room to explore.

Started wearing a double thickness of socks, they didn't bother my ankles any more. When I was there in August we didn't have such problems with bugs. >Chris"
554781,Mohleye,2006-02-22 10:04:00,368,"The place we stayed at Minnitaki had bait, including ciscoe. If yours doesn't, I think most Canadian bait shops probably do. I've never had to buy bait going that way, but it seems like there was a pretty large bait/tackle/convenience store (Can-Op?)going east out of Fort Frances. Maybe someone else knows the answer to this?????Ciscoe/smelt are one thing you don't want to try to bring across the border. If you bring downriggers, there's a spinner rig we call a strip-on that works well with the ciscoe. Whatever you use, make sure your hooks are as sharp as you can get them. Trout have very hard mouths."
554841,IaDave,2006-02-22 13:12:00,476,There is a full service bait shop on the highway just before you get to Sioux Lookout. It is on the left hand side. There is also a bait and sport shop downtown but I have never been there. I love that area of Ontario and hope to get back again this year.
554807,lazyk,2006-02-22 21:07:00,26,"What about bringing frozen smelt or whitefish from the US? I have a friend who will be going up in June and he was thinking of bringing them. I have never done that and didn`t knopw what to tell him. BTW, Google Earth is a great way to look at your favorite fishing lake. You can measure distances with their measuring tool and look at the surrounding territory, even if you can`t get the detail of Terraserver. And its easier to `look around` with. Chris"

554907,Guest,2006-02-23 23:32:00,0,forget the smelt..I had to walk some back to the us side of I falls when the customer guy asked if we had some. They just end up in the garbage at the us customs.
