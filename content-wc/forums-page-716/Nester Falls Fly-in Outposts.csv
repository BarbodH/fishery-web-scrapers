Their airplanes and pilots are the best around and they are great hosts. I promise you that you will appreciate their operation if you ever have the opportunity to compare it to the others around. They have a number of different locations for fly-in and they can put you in the right place for the type of fishing you prefer. Good Luck. Tell them Bob Pieske says hello!"

554787,Roddy,2006-02-22 11:26:00,488,"We used them a few years back. One thing that upset us a little was that when I booked our trip at the sportshow, I told them I was concerned that we would not be able to make the weight limit. They told me they would fly any extra items in during acheck flight at no cost to us so we booked. When we arrived for our trip, they told me that because of gas prices we would have to pay for the overload. Other than that incident they seemed to do a good job. We were up there during a mayfly hatch which really slowed the fishing down, then on the 1 1/2 hour flight home we hit a lot of turbulence. Everyone was feeling quite ill. We did not re-book. I know they had no control over the mayfly hatch or weather, but I think that the combination of all three things made us decide not to go back. Had we been up there when the fishing was good or not had the bad trip back we may have considered going back"

554795,jafletch,2006-02-22 15:13:00,5,Our group of 6 has been with Nestor Falls Fly-In Outposts the past 3 years and the entire experience has been great. First of all they located only 1 hour north of the border which is a big plus when you live in central Illinois. Dave and Michelle run a first class operation and they are good people. The aircraft they own are well maintained and their pilots are experienced. The first two years we stayed at Onepine Lake and the walleye fishing was incredebile. We also caught several 38+''Northerns on each trip. Last year we stayed at Malahar Lake where we caught larger walleyes but not as many. In May we are going back to Onepine and look forward to staying at a new cabin that was built in the fall of 2004. We have tried 5 different outfitters over the years and liked these guys the best.
