Lots of boat traffic. As far as Shabusquia , I know a fellow who spent two summers there as a camp attendant. He has fished many lakes and is very knowledgeable of the Armstrong area. He spoke very high of Shabusquia when I asked him about it. I will see him again in August on our bear hunt. Very good fellow to be in camp with. Good LucK !!!"
