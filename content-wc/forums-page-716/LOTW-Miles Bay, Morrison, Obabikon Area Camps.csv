554788,rockpt,2006-02-22 11:45:00,589,"TL, I've never been up there in June but I've heard the walleye can be really good that time of year. I suspect typical early season pattern. I go past Boomstick alot on my way to the open water humps between Morson and Dawson but I've never stopped to fish that area. I'd like to own that Marvin Windows house that's located there, eh?"

553539,Guest,2005-12-30 12:38:00,0,"Thanks for all of your input. I decided to stay at in Miles Bay this year. We are going up on July 8. We'll primarily fish for Walleye, Muskie, Pike and Smallmouth. Any suggested areas worth checking out for this time of year would be greatly appreciated."
553541,rockpt,2005-12-30 14:13:00,589,"Good choice. What camp did you decide on? Walleye will mostly be on the mid-lake humps. There are several reefs in Miles Bay that come up to 15' and are on the map. Throw a marker on top of the reef, use your trolling motor to move up and down until you find the walleye. Jig and minnow. Bass are in chunk rock shoreline off the islands. Garden Island is a good example. Jig and plastic cast and bounced back. Muskie are on the saddles, neck down areas with current, and my favorite, points that drop off to deep water. Painted Rock Channel has good muskie water and you can see the ancient Indian painting on the rock wall on the south side of the channel. Read Pearson's Muskies on the Shield and watch the DVD. Black and silver bucktails probably catch more muskie on LOTW than anything else in the summer. Obabikon Bay is a great place for lots of northern and a beautiful part of the lake. It's a little tricky getting in at the narrows. First, stay way to the left, like two feet between your boat and the boulder. If you have a console, lift the main motor way up and use the bow trolling motor to pull the boat through. If a tiller, it's easiest to back through. You'll see the rocks. Just guide the boat through. Have your partner standing with an oar to push off any rocks you get near. After you get through the narrows, it's only 3' deep for a few hundred yards but soft grassy bottom. Just power up on plane and you'll be fine. Don't worry; big 20' walleye boats go into Obabikon all the time with no problem. Last thing. Get the Canadian map for Sabaskong Bay. I think it's #6214. Available at Thorne Bros. Lots of rocks to watch for but with some caution and common sense, you'll be fine. Hopefully you have GPS, too. Good luck and tight lines!"
554722,Guest,2006-02-19 16:50:00,0,I'll be going to Rex Tolten's in Miles Bay this year for the first time. How difficult is it to safely navigate that area of LOTW to advaenture to other bays etc?
554738,rockpt,2006-02-20 15:39:00,589,"That depends on your navigational skills and equipment. If you have a good map, can read it, and have a GPS, you can safely go just about anywhere on LOTW, weather permitting. Miles Bay is centrally located and is on one of the main routes for that part of the lake. Get the Canadian map, #6214, and you will be fine. If you're running a camp boat you'll want to stay out of the big water most of the time, but Miles Bay and the surrounding area is very sheltered. The big water is about nine miles south (between Morson and Dawson Island) and about 7-8 miles west (Little Traverse). There's enough water and structure in and around Miles Bay to keep a first-timer busy all week."
554744,Guest,2006-02-20 22:26:00,0,Thanks rockpt. I'll be bringing my own boat and have gps and will pick up that map. I guess I'll just need to be careful when off the beaten path. Is it worth running to Obabikon Lake for pike?
554746,PJM,2006-02-21 00:52:00,3516,"Link Miles Bay is has rocks but if you use your head and study a map you should be ok. What time of the year are you going to be there, I might have some more ideas of where to fish."
554756,rockpt,2006-02-21 10:43:00,589,"Link, It's worth going to Obabikon just for the trip and to see a different part of the lake. The pike fishing can be pretty good, too. Just be a little extra careful once you're in Obabikon. The average depth is probably around 10', so a lot shallower than the rest of LOTW. You're not likely to see many, if any, boats in Obabikon on a typical day in July. So, let the camp owners know you're going there and have a good VHF in case you get stranded. It's a very isolated part of the lake."

553160,Guest,2005-11-24 08:22:00,0,"In that area of LOTW I highly recommend Duck Bay Lodge. They have top of the line equipment, facilities, food and service. If you are targeting big northerns and muskies, request George Wenk as a guide. He has spent over 30 years in this area and previously owned Pine Island Camp in the 80's. He is an excellent fishing guide and a fun person to fish with. Hope this helps. Wingmann"
553163,Ia Walihntr,2005-11-24 13:05:00,320,"Wingman, Have you ever seen George without his rainsuit on? I have never seen him without it. George is only one of the nowledegable guides on Duck Bays's staff. I also recomend chief guide, Rob Fathers, or one of thier part timers from Rainey River, Dan Fyrik. Duck Bay Lodge is definently a first class resort. Marv"
553167,Guest,2005-11-25 14:03:00,0,"Hi Marv, I have seen him without it but that was when he ran his own resort Pine Island. George and Janet had a great place which we used to go to a number of years ago. They are great people and George is just so much fun to fish with. Wingmann"
553231,Jap,2005-12-05 15:10:00,93,"Link, Check out the Reel em Inn Lodge. It is about 25 miles by boat out of Morrison. Vic runs a great place and the fishing is awesome. I have been there several times in June and July, during the June trips we rarely see a boat that is from another camp. Last July my son caugh a 50"" 35lb. Muskie, the walleye fishing is really good. Here is the website and you can see the picture of my son's muskie: www.reeleminnlodge.com ""An angler is a man who spends rainy days sitting around on the muddy banks of rivers doing nothing because his wife won't let him do it at home."""
553237,Guest,2005-12-06 14:08:00,0,"It is nice to get someone to admit George Wenk has been guiding out there. He has been kicked out of canada before. You have to be canadian or have a work visa to work here. Thanks guys, we will be watching for him again this year."

You are so off base, that you're not even in the same province. George Wenk has resident status from the time he owned Pine Island. As long as he keeps up the minimum requirements for time spent in Canada in a 12 month period, he'll continue to be able to guide (or do any other type of work) legally. Get your facts straight before you spread any more BS like that."
553478,Guest,2005-12-26 00:31:00,0,Wow. That sounds like a serious thing to say about someone without good information. BE careful. Almost suprised they left that post up.
553532,Guest,2005-12-29 21:24:00,0,"Yes it's pretty sad you have idiots outright lying on this site. I'm just glad I am lucky enough to be able to fish with George when we go up to LOTW. If someone has a problem with another party, they should settle it amongst themselves and not hide behind a fake name on a public forum. Wingmann"
552862,Guest,2005-10-27 15:54:00,0,"Looking for a more remote fishing area on LOTW. We'll be targeting walleye, pike and muskie the week of the muskie opener 6/17/06. Have never fished this area but from my research it looks like a great spot to fish for these species. First off what can we expect for quantity and size? Second are there any camps you have been to and could recommend? Any other LOTW areas/camps we should consider? Thanks."
552863,rockpt,2005-10-27 16:21:00,589,"Link, That area (Sabaskong, Miles Bay and Little Traverse) is excellent muskie water. As an example, there were eight muskies over 50"" boated a couple summers ago by a group fishing out of Mylie's Place in Morson. If you're looking for drive in camps, Mylie's and Buena Vista in Morson are good camps. If you want boat in, I'd recommend Grassy Narrows Lodge (I have made 14 trips to Grassy and am going back twice next year), or New Moon Lodge. Both camps are about a 12 mile boat ride from Morson and they are remote. Other boat in camps in that area are Obabikon Bay Camp (currently on the market), Miles Bay Camp (more ""rustic"" than the others), and Tamarack Lodge (also currently on the market and fairly ""rustic""). As for other muskie water on LOTW, IMHO the only area comparable to Sabaskong is the NW Angle. Frank Walsh runs Bay Store Camp in the NW Angle and that camp is a real hardcore muskie camp. Dick Pearson and Doug Johnson sometimes guide out of Bay Store, and Frank is a great guy. Hope this helps."
552871,Bill Krejca,2005-10-28 07:38:00,6107,"Stayed at Red Wing Lodge a few years ago. It is fine, nothing real fancy, but certainly adequate. It is in the same area as Mylies and Buena Vista. A large munber of their guests are muskie fishermen."
552872,Guest,2005-10-28 07:51:00,0,"Check out Black Island Lodge. It's a short boat ride out of Morson. Near both Obabikon and Miles Bay. I've been there the last couple of years and was very pleased with the service. The owners are hands on and very helpful. I think their capacity is around 20 - 25 so it's a nice size. It's an easy place to bring your boat too but they have nice equipment also. The last two years I've been there, I have been the only walleye fisherman in camp. The others were after Musky and seemed to do quite well."
552873,Tom502,2005-10-28 08:44:00,118,"I can highly reccomend New Moon Lodge out of Morson. I have been a guest there 14-15 times over the last 20 years. The fishing has always been very good. We normally take one of their guides, who also takes care of cooking a fantastic shore lunch and will clean and package any fish you decide to keep. They can handle a max of around 24 guests, and I know that June is a very busy month for most LOTW lodges. You may want to contact several places and see who has openings. New Moon is mostly an ""American Plan"" lodge, but they do have a couple of hosuekeeping cabins where you would cook your own meals. Their web address is: www.newmoonlodge.ca Tight Lines, Tom502"
552881,Guest,2005-10-29 06:18:00,0,"I have had great luck with Duck Bay Lodge. Great owners, guides, new boats and motors, small camp with great food! We fish for walleyes but one day each trip we fish muskies and northerns. Could not think of going anywhere else. I go up the 3rd week in September but if you check out their web site duckbaylodge.com you will see their fishing log and catches from opening to close. Good luck! Steve"
552895,Guest,2005-10-30 18:34:00,0,Thanks for all the feedback so far. This area of LOTW really looks interesting. Looks like the Miles Bay or Obabikon Bay areas might be great areas to stay. Keep the advice coming.
552896,Guest,2005-10-30 19:04:00,0,"Link, My son and I have gone to Obabikon bay camp for the past 10 years and have caught several muskies over the years. Most of the muskies we have caught have been by accident so to speak. I highly recommend Obabikon bay Camp. The current owner is Steve and his wife Jane. Steve can be a challenge but he has good equipment and good food but forget the food for a minute. The location is the best. You are very close to the mouth of Miles bay and you are extremely close to the Obabikon. If you decide to get a guide, you want Bill Looney. He is very knowledgeable regarding the entire region. There are times that Steve's personality makes me think about trying other camps but I try to be at the camp a minimum when I am there. I am on the water as much as possible. Good luck and have fun."
552899,Guest,2005-10-31 07:17:00,0,"FOOTDOC 1, What can you tell me about the Pike and Walleye fishing in the area? Size and quantity you might catch on a good and bad day? Link"
552905,Shorelunch,2005-10-31 10:50:00,554,I'm up to Morson quite a bit. I'd recommend New Moon or Duck Bay. Obobikon is a very nice place too and is also close to excellent fishing.
