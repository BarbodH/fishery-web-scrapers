Are you a guide, or, a lodge owner on Lac Seul? If so, maybe I could hire you. I'll post this in other areas so I can get an answer from you."

554901,Guest,2006-02-23 21:05:00,0,You should check out Woman River Camp. It is a remote drive to on a chain of lakes with great fishing for a variety of fish. The water never gets too choppy but there is plenty of it for remoteness. The website is womanriver.com
554964,Guest,2006-02-27 14:27:00,0,Fishing Chick-- can you give some hints on walleye fishing at WRC. First time in June '06--thanks

553958,Guest,2006-01-22 04:19:00,0,"Are the fish in Clay Lake OK to eat these days? If not, how far down the river is the Mercury a problem? Lount Lake? Separation?"
553962,Guest,2006-01-22 10:26:00,0,Anyone ever fish the english river by ingance. I'm looking at cozy camp lodge and it looks good.
553963,Larry S,2006-01-22 10:42:00,666,"Just booked a June trip to Cozy Camp after using the search engine and talking to former guests. We are going there first,then on to a fly-in trip at Northern Outposts out of Armstrong the next week Larry S"
553964,Guest,2006-01-22 11:05:00,0,"Thanks larry, What did the former guests have to say about it? It must be good news if you decieded to book a trip there"
553970,Larry S,2006-01-22 17:13:00,666,"Jojo, They said camp is nice,you have lots of water by camp on english river and lakes hooked into english river to fish. There are also portage lakes and drive to lakes where you can haul a boat on trailers provided by camp. Also you can fish for walleye,pike,lake trout,smallmouth bass and perch. So you have a nice variety Larry S"
553977,Guest,2006-01-23 09:28:00,0,"forgot to mention the 2 headed walleye and glow in the dark smalies.. seriously, we checked with mnr and dont remember xact response,but response was favorable so we went. fishing is quite good though"
553978,Guest,2006-01-23 09:30:00,0,talking about clay lake fyi..
552755,Guest,2005-10-23 11:28:00,0,"As for the walleye fishing on Wine Lake if you find them you can catch a lot but if you are concentrating on one place it could be tough. I haven't been to lac Suel but it sounds like they just jump in your boat. Either lake your limit is 4 in possesion. Personally I like to target walleye early in the morning and at night then try pike and lake trout during the day. We eat walleye everyday while we are there. The nice thing about Wine Lake is that it is private and you have other species you can catch like pike, smallys and lake trout. Scott"
552771,Guest,2005-10-24 15:13:00,0,"Thanks guys, What is your favorite lodge on Lac Suel and why?"
552772,Guest,2005-10-24 15:19:00,0,"try williams, good fishing, accomadations.www.williamslakelodge.com"
552773,Guest,2005-10-24 15:22:00,0,Sorry Trywww.williamslakelodge.net
552775,Guest,2005-10-24 15:50:00,0,"Williams is on Williams Lake, not Lac Seul. You are looking at a long boat ride down Williams Creek and through Williams Bay before you would get to Lac Seul. That said, once you do get there, it is the least pressured area of the lake. The lodge which calls that section of Lac Seul home is Silver Water Wheel Lodge (SWWL). SWWL costs more, but it's to give you the best. Great service, great equipment, and great fishing."
552868,Guest,2005-10-27 22:50:00,0,"Another lodge on Lac Seul is Onaway. Located about 15 miles south of Ear Falls, is away from all the traffic from the lodges located close to Ear Falls. Yes, you will see other boats but this lake is BIG, with plenty of bays, islands and out-of the way spots, if you want that secluded feeling. Onaway is 1-888-662-9291 Blair & Kathy Campbell."
553157,Guest,2005-11-23 21:06:00,0,Been to both Wine and Wabaskang. Walleye fishing much better on Wabaskang.
553355,Guest,2005-12-17 21:13:00,0,Holinshead Lake might be a good fit for you.
553408,grt1,2005-12-20 23:28:00,259,"I live on Gullrock Lake, south of Red Lake, but for my money the lake you should look at is Stormer Lake, north of Red Lake. there is only one lodge and a private Mennonite church group home on the Lake. The resort however is American Plan only and is fairly expensive (too much for me to afford) Fortuneately I get to guide for the camp and fish for free. Plenty of good walleye and lots of big northerns. They can be reached at: [email protected]"
553470,Guest,2005-12-24 11:44:00,0,Was just curious as I am too.
552651,Guest,2005-10-14 09:50:00,0,Hey guys we are looking for a drive-in or boat-in lodge in Canada with good walleye fishing. We want to find a secluded lodge on a smaller lake. Any suggestions? Thanks
552655,Guest,2005-10-14 12:27:00,0,What do you mean by a secluded lodge that is drive to. Please give me your defination of what you are looking for.
552656,Guest,2005-10-14 13:06:00,0,Someplace w/ just one lodge on it. Preferably in Ontario.
552662,Guest,2005-10-14 21:26:00,0,A boat in lake would be Wine Lake. Small lake with 4 lakes branching off it. Only resort on the system. 22 mile boat ride to camp going across Wabaskang Lake. Website www.winelakecamp.com Scott
552713,Guest,2005-10-18 19:03:00,0,"Thanks, how is the walleye fishing? That is probably most important. We have fished Wabby before and were doing good to catch a dozen walleyes in a day (per boat). I have talked to fisherman from Lac Suel who were catching 3 times that. We have actually considered Lac Suel but we're looking for a lake a little more private."
552716,Guest,2005-10-19 06:02:00,0,"reconsider lac seul. we fished it the last 3 years out of the hudson boat landing the second week in june(prime time) we boat about 20 minutes from the landing and there are days we don't see more than 10 other boats. oh yeah, the fishing is unbelievable.can you believe on the good days over 100 eyes per day/boat and many over 22''."
552726,Guest,2005-10-19 21:53:00,0,I think the Eye fishing is alot better in Wabby then Wine. If Eyes are what your after - Lac Seul.
552731,DaveIN,2005-10-20 14:23:00,191,"Try Separation Lake near Kenora It has a very small campground and one lodge, both owned by the same people. Lodge is boat in only, park at the campground. 12 campsites. Great fishing. Been going there for 5 years."
552733,Guest,2005-10-20 16:29:00,0,Drive in two times a year to Lac Seul. 1 week in June and 1 week in July
552734,Guest,2005-10-20 18:41:00,0,"The southwest-central section of Lac Seul has the least pressure on the lake. The odd bit of local traffic on the weekend, and only in a few small sections. Other than that, the only boats you'll probably see are others from the same lodge. Oh, and the walleye fishing is the best you'll likely find."
