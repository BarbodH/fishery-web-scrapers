554902,Guest,2006-02-23 21:08:00,0,I don't think you will need downriggers in June. I fish 4 1/2 hours north of Rainy for walleyes and we catch them in the curren or on the flats at that time of year. Anywhere from 3-15 feet deep. Riggers maybe during summer peak. Mainly for eyes out in open water.
