I know in Wi. we can use three lines. The Canada line rule it that for everyone or just the non resident?"
554695,Trailerguy,2006-02-17 12:09:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Yes, it's the same for everybody. Two lines ""could"" mean twice as many fish caught, the MNR is already trying to limit the numbers of fish caught. Ice fishing has far less participation than open water angling. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
554696,Guest,2006-02-17 12:38:00,0,i have fished for walleyes in wisconsin and northwest ontario. i don't want nwo to become anything like wisconsin. 1 line will keep you plenty busy.
554700,jigman 2003,2006-02-17 15:00:00,981,"Yep, if you need two lines for open water walleye fishing in Ontario, you're fishing the wrong lake."
554703,Guest,2006-02-17 16:10:00,0,"When I am walleye fishing in Wisconsin, I sometimes like to take a 6 or 8"" sucker and throw it about six feet off the weedline on a quick-strike rig under a huge bobber. If I could use a second line in Canada it would be for this, and not for a second walleye rig."

Our north of the border friends have figured out how to maximize the resourses for all of us, the DNR in WI is more willing to cater to those folks who visit from IL than maximize the resourse."

554909,Guest,2006-02-24 00:12:00,0,"IL residents are not to blame for the ills. Catering to tourist dollars though is a reason why the daily limits and thus the numbers and sizes of the fish harvested are continuing to fall. If WI would institute a slot size and enforce it rigorously, I am not alone in thinking that the fishery in WI would bounce back. But, our DNR and tourism dept. feel that we will not get our fair share of the tourism $$$ if the bag limits and other requirements are too restrictive and harsh. Sorry if I hit a nerve here, but 1 line in the water is enough in Ont., if not, stay in WI."
