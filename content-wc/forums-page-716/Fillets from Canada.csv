No I'm not nuts the guy at the lodge where I stayed at suggested this and it really works. When I went to buy ice to pack our frozen fish he said no he wouldn't sell me any if it was to pack the fish; he went on to ask me what was the first thing most people do to thaw there fish put it in water right Well yea I said. Ice turns into water as it melts. He said to put a layer of your laundry in the bottom of your cooler (maybe not your underwear) LOL load in the fillets and then pack in as much other cloths, towels whatever you have until the lid will barley close, making sure the fish is in the centre of the cooler. Still didn't really believe this guy and only pack half our catch his way and the other on ice. We get home after better then 10 hours on the road the fish on ice was still semi frozen and ok but the stuff packed in the laundry was still like rock. The frost on the outside of the sealer bags was still there. It really works and have traveled home many times with the same results. Just package the fish according the reg's so the boys from the ministry are happy and your set to go. Dan."

554155,Frankm,2006-01-27 11:45:00,154,We bring the foodsaver and vacuum pack them. Usually 1-2 fish per bag. We used to wrap them in paper. It worked nice to keep them frozen but a pain to identify.
554156,jigman 2003,2006-01-27 11:54:00,981,"The tinfoil is easily folded back to determine what is inside. I'll take the word of the MNR warden. He may be wrong, but I don't know why they would object to tinfoil. Fold it back, there's the fillets, no problem. Any ""fishy"" taste from the skin being left on can be removed by soaking in milk for an hour or so before cooking. I always do that to any fish that has been frozen."
554157,jigman 2003,2006-01-27 11:55:00,981,Foodsavers don't work real well at fly-in camps ;-)
554165,Guest,2006-01-27 14:38:00,0,"Jigman, I'm sure there's nothing wrong with wrapping in tinfoil. When we got stopped while travelling, they had many vehicles backed up to check and we had a large group, therefore a fair number of fish. In this scenario I'm not sure the MNR Officer would appreciate the tinfoil, but that doesn't make it wrong. I just try to do what I think will make their life easier if I get stopped, hoping they'll do the same for me."
554174,hoosiercanadian,2006-01-27 19:50:00,104,"I usually just gut my walleye and leave them whole, sometimes freezing them individually in lake water, or just putting them on ice. I have also brought them back filleted with the patch of skin, but always wondered how would a C.O. know if the fillet came from a 17 inch fish or a 20, not that I would keep a 20 to eat but would not want to be accused of it. Hence my reasoning for transporting them whole., so they could be accurately measured."
554187,Guest,2006-01-29 08:02:00,0,When you use the food saver do you partially freeze the fillets first? How do you keep the water that is on the fillets from spoiling the sealing of the bags?
554198,jerry bark,2006-01-29 20:34:00,822,i freeze my filets on wax paper on a cookie sheet for a couple of hours then bag and seal. cheers jerry
554231,Frankm,2006-01-31 08:04:00,154,We lay the filletts out and dab them with a paper towel. I carefully place them in the bag trying not to touch the inside. I then wipe the inside. It works good. Last year I started double sealing. I vacuum and seal and them put 1 more on the edge. Another tip from the foodsaver video. I had this problem. If you are try to freeze bulk hamburger it really vacuums the juice to the top and prevents sealing. You put the meat in and then a folded up paper towel to catch the juice.
554803,Guest,2006-02-22 17:05:00,0,"I have been going to Canada for 20 years now and we are going back this summer. We have found that not freezing your fish in camp while in Canada is best for us. We fillet, rib, and while taking the skin off, we stop just before it's cut clear off, back off alittle and leave approx. a 1 inch strip of skin attached to the fish. We do not keep any take-home fish until the last couple days of our trip. We have never had any trouble getting our limit of 3 under the slot and 1 over the slot on Lac Seul. This way, you do not have to worry about your limit during the week. We bag each fish separately with the skin piece out on both sides. We keep the fish in the refrigerator, put them on ice the morning we leave (make sure as the ice melts that the water can't get on the fish). Leave ice in bag, have fish in zip-locks, use ice jugs, etc. When I get home in Iowa, I take the skin off the fish that night. Then I soak the fillets in fresh water in the refrigerator for a couple of days, changing the water each day. We find that leaving as little skin on the fish, not freezing the fish until after you get home, and soaking the fillets in water for a couple days help keep the extreme fishy taste out of the fillets. It's almost like you just caught them out of a lake at home fresh."

554124,Guest,2006-01-26 17:43:00,0,How do you guys package your walleye fillets to bring pack from Canada?
554125,esgrams,2006-01-26 18:05:00,92,"One walleye/package with a patch of skin remaining on the fillet according to the regulations. pack them good in ice, know your exact count and you won't have a bit of trouble"
554129,Guest,2006-01-26 20:10:00,0,"Vacuum bag. Buy one, they work great. Dry ice. You'll see signs in Canada for it. Remember, put the dry ice on the TOP of the cooler, over the regular ice."
554130,Guest,2006-01-26 20:20:00,0,I second the vacum bags. I personally like to keep the full skin on the fillets. It is easier taking the whole side of skin off than trying to get that little one inch piece. Plus the skin helps protect the meat while frozen. It does not add fishy taste either. Agate
554131,VMS,2006-01-26 20:40:00,1103,"Heavy duty CLEAR 1 gallon bags, refridgerate or keep on ice. Do not freeze them until you are home. If you get checked at the border or on the water and the officer wants to count the catch, it's awfully hard to check frozen fillets. I can recall one time where a group had quartered their catch before coming home. They were all torn down, and all pieces were laid out on the tables as they tried to put the puzzle back together to get an accurate count. Not worth it...keep the fillets full. As others have stated, leave a patch of skin on. Very easy to do...get to the point where you are almost all the way to the end of of cutting the skin off, then back your knife out a little ways, fold the skin over the blade edge and slice through. this will leave a patch much larger than 1 square inch, and then when you get home and if desired, you can just pull the piece of skin off and you are all set to freeze. Steve"
554136,Guest,2006-01-26 22:17:00,0,We bring ours back frozen with the entire skin on each side of the fillet and the two meat sides frozen together. One fish per freezer bag. we have never been checked but they warden would have to be blind not to see there was only one fish in each bag. I also think leaving the entire skin on protects the fillet and hlps ID the fish.
554139,Catman59,2006-01-27 05:44:00,345,"Our camp showed us a neat way to do the skin thing.....just run your knife down the whole slab like you are going to remove the skin , but stop about a 1/2 inch from the tail, leaving it attached. That way the complete skin is still there but already cut off. When you package it , you have a complete fillet with skin , when it thaws...all you have is cut the last 1/2 off. We wrap in high grade cellophane freezer plastic , then put in ziplocks when we get home. Works good."
554140,Guest,2006-01-27 06:36:00,0,"We do the same with the skin, but we freeze 1 fish per 1 or 2 gallon bag. The camp we go to has a freezer so all of our fillets are frozen before the 24 hour drive home. When we get home, we skin and debone the fillets and then use the Foodsaver on them, refreeze and they last for a long time. I have one left in the freezer now, and it sure sounds good for the weekend."
554141,jigman 2003,2006-01-27 07:34:00,981,"I butterfly them, leaving the two sides attached at the belly, remove the ribs, leave the skin on, fold the two sides together meat side in (I think the skin helps protect the meat from freezer burn), then wrap the fillets in a double layer of saran wrap, then wrap in heavy duty aluminum foil. I had an MNR officer tell me to take care of them this way. We almost received a ticket from him for having our fish frozen in water inside ziploc bags (we had one fish per bag, but you could easily have a smaller one frozen between the fillets). If you look in this year's Ontario fishing regs. there are some suggestions for how and how not to take care of your fish."
554153,Guest,2006-01-27 11:08:00,0,"My group has been checked several times, both in camp, and on the road on Saturday mornings where the MNR is pulling over every vehicle from the US and checking their fish. Lots of different ideas about packaging, but what I've consistently heard is that they want the fillets flat and easy to identify. Flat as in side-by-side, and in a clear plastic bag. If you want to wrap in tinfoil, you might want to wait until you get back in the states to do this. Whatever skin is left on is a lot easier to remove later if you leave a ""flap"" so you have something to grab when removing it. We choose not to leave the full skin on, because we feel the fillets are less fishy tasting when they're cooked later."
