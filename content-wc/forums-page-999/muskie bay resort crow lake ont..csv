We decided to go to another resort this year mainly because we wanted to be on Lake of the Woods full time. We had a very positive experience at Muskie Bay however, and I would recommend it for anyone looking to go to this area. There are actually a few other lakes that can be portaged to from Crow as well, and Muskie Bay Resort is set up on those lakes with boats so you can fish them. Crow is a very good muskie lake and lake trout lake but does not have any walleyes, however, some of the portage lakes do contain walleyes. Lake of the Woods is also right across the road from Muskie Bay and they do have access to a landing on LOW if you want to fish there."
514589,jazzman,2001-08-23 11:58:00,13,Muskie Bay Lodge is tucked back in a beautiful protected bay on Crow(Kakagi) lake. Crow lake is known for its outstanding lake trout and musky fishing. As the previous post states walleyes are scarce but portage to Cedartree lake can be fruitfull(10 mile boat ride)Crystal clear .and cold water Crow Lake also has plentiful smallmouth. Being a rock bottom lake weed growth is minimal but is slowly transforming as I see more weeds each year.The weeds have been key to finding trophy musky and northerns.Access to Lake of the Woods(Stevens Bay) will be particularly fruitful in the fall. I have been going up in early October the past three years. The giant crappies around hay island have been outstanding. Walleyes that time of year are about as unpredicable as the weather.
