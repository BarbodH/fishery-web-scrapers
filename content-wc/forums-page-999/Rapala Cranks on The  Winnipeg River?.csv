514131,Snag,2001-07-27 14:02:00,78,Hi guys. I'll be up in Canada in a couple of weeks. What are the hottest models of Rapala cranks on the Wpg. river? colors?
514132,chrism,2001-07-27 14:27:00,429,"I have had success with most, but the firetiger husky jerk (don't remember the size #, but it is about 5-6"" long) has been hot for me this year."
514133,Guest,2001-07-28 06:19:00,0,"Try some Reef Runners, they were very good when I was there in early July and was the crank that the guides buddies I knew were recommending. Needed to get down to 25' to 30' for the big'uns!"
514135,Guest,2001-07-29 04:05:00,0,"Hey snagsI have found over the years that clown works the best. In the early morning or close to dark trolling the clay banks works great you will have to do what we call longlining about 150' of line out.I use #9 shad raps. There is also a special color the pearl white. last year I had caught some many fish it straightened out my hooks. I use gamakatsu hooks also. That was up in big sand. I have also found in big sand that down riggers work great that time of year, The walleyes are down chasing bait fish and you can put your bait down also.I have found them down as deep as 30'. What dates are you leaving and returning? I myself will be leaving the 17th of august. Where do you stay?Well lot of luck. There is a place called the bobbershop that carries the pearl white shad raps. But other than that I think you will have to purchase them in canada for I think $13.00 cndTalk to you soon Bill"

514138,Guest,2001-08-03 13:06:00,0,"If your thinking of Pine Falls, I would recommend waiting till fall, late Sept, early Oct when the action is fast and chances of a 14, 15#der is possible, where 6-8#ders are caught daily."
