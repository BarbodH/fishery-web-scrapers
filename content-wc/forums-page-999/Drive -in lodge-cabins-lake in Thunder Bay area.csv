514584,Guest,2001-08-21 07:34:00,0,Looking for lake to drive to for second trip in same year to keep price down. We take one fly-in trip a year and would like to take second trip without as much expense. I do not expect fly-in quality fishing but would like to eat a couple of walleye a day. Any suggestions would be appreciated!!
