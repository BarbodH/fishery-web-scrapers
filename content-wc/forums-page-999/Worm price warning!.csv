Everyone should also know you cannot import live bait such as minnows into Canada.
514564,Guest,2001-08-24 20:29:00,0,"here we go again. my bait shop has told me about the price increase on crawlers. he buys them from canada, in dirt, and we have to remove the dirt and place them in buss bedding in order to take them back across the border. o well the rules are the rules so if you choose to take them you will have to do it. i thought from what i read here on walleye central, that they had a lot of rain. in fact, they said that the water level in lotw. had never been so high. first a shortage of gas, and now there is a shortage of crawlers. what next?"
514554,Papi,2001-08-25 04:50:00,13,Come on guys !Even if it is $2.50 that is in cdn money it represents about $1.45 us.Give me a break ! You are going to spend all kinds of money on your trip and you'll try to save on the cost of worms ???I won't !!!
514565,Guest,2001-08-25 20:04:00,0,check the price at cabelas..i was just back from the red river and could not find any..
514552,Hunter,2001-08-19 22:15:00,346,"Just thought id let you guys know the price of a dozen worms in southern Ontario has jumped 50% in the last 3 months. The dry weather is affecting the price, I used to pay $1.75 can for a dozen, they are now 2.50 a dozen. And alot of them are small. Just thought id give someone a heads up, it may be better to go through the trouble of bringing them over now. I couldn't imagine what they are going for in northern ontario now probably $5 a dozen."
514553,Smitty,2001-08-20 11:04:00,1934,"I paid $2.00 to $3.00US for crawlers in West Central Minnesota a few weeks back, so I'm not sure that there's much savings in bringing your own from the states (and you have the hassle of keeping them alive during transport).. It's a small cost in comparison to the whole trip, so for my money I'll go ahead and buy them up there. Thanks for the info though."
514555,Jig A Lowe,2001-08-20 13:25:00,87,Price may not be the biggest obstacle ... AVAILABILITY MIGHT BE A BIGGER PROBLEM!!!!
514556,PWaldow123,2001-08-20 17:39:00,198,Hunter thanks for the heads up. Leaving on Friday and was planning on just buying them up there (local economy and all) I think now I will go out and catch some crawlers and bring them over.Paul[email protected]
514557,Hunter,2001-08-20 18:14:00,346,"Just make sure they are not in dirt. There was several discussions earlier this year on what you can transport them in. As far as the local economy, stop somewhere for lunch, that should even it up. Have a great trip!"
514558,PWaldow123,2001-08-20 18:38:00,198,"Hunter, thanks again. Have brought them across before. Commercial bedding it is."
514559,Karl,2001-08-20 21:07:00,63,"I'm going to Sioux Lookout this Sunday and was asked to bring along a flat of crawlers. Walleye are really biting on crawlers on bottom bouncers there.I stopped in my local bait shop (S.E. Wis.) to get a price - wow! A flat costs $56, up from $40 three weeks ago, and he could only get six flats (I reserved one), and might not get any more for a while. The bait dealer told him that he's getting $135 a flat in the eastern U.S. Needless to say, I changed my plans of looking for them in Int. Falls or Ft. Frances."
514560,PWaldow123,2001-08-20 21:16:00,198,That is harsh!!! Glad I changed my plans and started looking for them in my garden. :)Paul[email protected]
514561,Guest,2001-08-22 18:42:00,0,A flat of crawlers in Wawa is $95 Canadian as of 08/21/01.
