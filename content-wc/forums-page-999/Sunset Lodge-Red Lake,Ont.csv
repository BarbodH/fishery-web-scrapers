This is our seventh year returning to this same camp and each year is simply awesome. Rene and Adelle offer a terrific, clean and friendly resort that makes everyone feel welcome. They do a super job catering to families and hard-core fisherman.Excellent numbers of Walleyes and large pike can be caught. Ean, the resident guide, knows the Red Lake waters better than anyone I know. If you're into Lake Trout fishing, he's the man.No, I'm not paid to endorse Sunset Lodge. Rather, I've been steered incorrectly at fishing shows and have learned that the best information comes from those who have firsthand experience. If you'd like more information, feel free to email me for more details.Tight lines,Mark Hennessey"
