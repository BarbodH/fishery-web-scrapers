514598,Guest,2001-08-22 22:49:00,0,"Got a couple of questions for the board. First off, does anyone know for sure how much we have to pay (duty) if we're over our limit of beer? Is it a certain $ per case of beer or what? Also, does anyone know how early the stores open in Kenora (to buy beer). Going to be rolling through pretty early and trying to figure out if we should pay duty on the extra beer or buy in Kenora. We'd like to get our beer in Kenora but not sure what time the stores open. Lastly, anyone know where in Kenora to buy some cigars? Wanting to smoke some Cubans while in the bush and need to find a good smoke shop.Thanks for the information,Larry"

514600,Guest,2001-08-23 07:40:00,0,"The duty per case is around $8-$10 US. The liquor stores in Kenora don't open until 8:00am (I think). You can buy beer in the grocery stores, they are open earlier. If it were me I would buy beer there, with the exchange its not that much more plus the Canadian beer is much higher alcohol content so you don't need as much....you sip that beer, you don't drink it.As for the cigars, there is a really good smoke shop right downtown in the business district (not sure about the name or what time it opens....just ask someone when you get there.) They have the cheap $5.00 Cubans all the way up to the really nice $20-$30 variety. Good luck and good fishing."
514601,Guest,2001-08-25 19:52:00,0,I had the same question..the beer duty is 9.95 a case(24). it doesnt matter how much you paid for it..they always ask you what you paid for it.
514602,kevin,2001-08-26 02:56:00,74,"They asked me what I paid for a case, I told them 14 bucks and they charged me 7 bucks a case. I'm thinking that duty is half of what you paid. I could be wrong though."
514603,Guest,2001-08-26 07:36:00,0,I always wondered this too .I made it a point to ask why that was and the guy said it as for imformation on the beer price in the States. Usually these guys are pretty gung ho about their jobs but i must say he was a very nice guy.
514604,Guest,2001-08-26 16:14:00,0,make sure you take your case each across before you by in canada. by your cigars at duty free before you cross. and by the way buy your one case of beer to. duty free has all the answers for you.
