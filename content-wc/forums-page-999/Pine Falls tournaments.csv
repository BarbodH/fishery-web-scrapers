514571,Guest,2001-08-26 20:36:00,0,"I cannot be specific for you but there have been 2 tourneys for a few years since some of the fisherman felt the one was not run real well. A second one started. All I can say is that there are many that think their fishing day is more important than those of us there to fish that are not in the tourney. I just use the same courteousness with them as I do the non-tourney fisherman. At times, the tourney fisherman will push you off, run across your lines and think you should not be there. I shrug them off and typically outfish most of them....remember, I do it for the relaxation and enjoyment. With that being said, there is no more pressure during the tournaments as when they are not being held. Most of the tournament fisherman would be there anyway. Just remember to get to the launch at 9 or so instead of between 7 and 8. Actually, I am an early riser and typically get there around 6 am. Not many to worry about at that time.Good luck and catch some HAWGS!"
