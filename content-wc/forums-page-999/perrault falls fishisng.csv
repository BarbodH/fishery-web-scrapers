We caught plenty of wallyes. Jumbo perch and lots of small mouth action. We have been fishing this area south of red lake a couple of times a year trying different lakes and lodges. what beautiful area. It seems most of the fishing around here stays a constant. Its basically trees water and rocks any info i can help any one out let me know thanks larry
