514520,Fred_G,2001-08-18 07:14:00,908,"I just happened to have been there a week ago. Wish I was still there.Water levels are still a little high. I would say about five feet over normal. You have to watch out for those rocks that were sticking up a bit but are now just under the surface. I learned this the hard way. No major damage, but two damaged props is a bit hard to take.The walleye fishing was the best I have experienced in terms of larger fish. I caught more 24' & 25"" walleyes than all previous years combined. The pike, however, were very elusive. My boat partner and I boated nothing over 28"". There was a 43 1/2"" caught by a 10 year old in our group. Sure made his trip.Good Luck!Fred"

Can you tell I'm looking forward to it?)"

They moved the pallets up a ways one day, but still lots left.The prop damage was on my own boat, so I'm paying for it either way. Just glad there wasn't any more damage.The guys in our group that used camp boats were very impressed with the Yamaha motors. They're 40 hp but they've been detuned to run at about 35 hp. Our guys were getting about 28 mph out of them.The spots we did well on were Wayne's Rock, and the north side of Sand Island. The fish around Wayne's were all in 12' - 15' of water on the west side. The Sand Island fish were in 18' - 24'. These were some really nice size fish with several in the 23"" - 25"" range. We also did well on Heart Attack Point. Lots of keepers and up. There was also a spot at the end of the second island up from Heart Attack Point. No name for it on the map but we caught loads of 18"" - 24"" walleyes in 18' of water. It drops off very quickly to around 40 feet in this area. Carling Island is just to the northeast of this spot.Hope this helps. Let me know how you do. Good Luck!Fred"
