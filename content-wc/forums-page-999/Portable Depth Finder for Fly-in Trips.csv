514646,Guest,2001-08-25 12:11:00,0,My Hummingbird portable depth finder quit on my last fly-in trip and I am in the market for another. Any suggestions? Have not researched them since I bought this one 7 or 8 years ago. Thanks
514647,Guest,2001-08-25 17:00:00,0,"Keith,I have been using the Eagle Fish I.D. 128 that I picked up at Cabelas four or five years ago. I have had no problems with it except that I have trouble marking at higher speeds; I'm assuming this is do to the placement of the transducer on the standard 14 ft boat.This unit is not as nice (sensitive) as you would have in your own boat but definately lets you know where the bottom is and fish to boot. It runs a full week (all day long) without any stress on the 8 ""D"" cell power source. The topper is that it was cheap. I have run 17 full days this year on the same set of batteries with no problem.I'm not sure if they still offer the same model, but if I needed another one, I would buy another of the same.I have no comparison - so there it is.lobo"
514648,Guest,2001-08-26 19:26:00,0,I made my own portable for my Eagle. Same design will work for any non-portable. I used a surplus .50 cal ammo can (about $5 at a surplus store) and used a RAM mount on it to hold the finder. Used a 12 V gel cell (Cabela's) for power instead of the $$ non-rechargeable lantern cells. Drilled holes in the lid for the RAM mount and drilled a hole in the side for an electrical connector to hook up the power from the depth finder. Sealed all the h/w with silicone and presto. You can store the depth finder head and cables in the ammo can for traveling. I bought a suction cup conversion for my regular skimmer and store it in the can also. Great waterproof can to store your billfold and point and shoot while fishing. Pretty awesome. Email if you have any questions.

514650,Riceburner,2001-08-26 21:14:00,436,"Try to find a Zercom Clearwater Classic--will run a week on one charge of the battery, is easy to see in the sun, marks even the smallest lures (great for ice fishing). Transducer can be placed in some water at the rear of the floor--not necessary to put it on the outside of the transom."
514651,Guest,2001-08-27 09:50:00,0,Garmin 160 or 260. Great machine for the price. Highest vertical resolution for the price. I believe it's around $160 us.
