514503,Guest,2001-08-21 16:27:00,0,"I just got back from a week at Scout Lake Camp's McKenzie Bay Outpost on Lac Seul. Two of us went and it was $550 each I think. It would be less with a larger group. It's a boat-in outpost, about an hour boat ride from the main camp. I've never done a fly-in but I know they restrict your weight for equipment and food. With the boat in there are no restrictions so we had all the comforts of home (not exactly true but we did have plenty of beer).Lac Seul is a great walleye lake and the outpost puts you real close to some great spots. The cabin has 2 small bedrooms with 4 bunks each but I couldn't imagine staying with more than 4 people there. A generator runs a chest freezer and a regfrigerator. There's also a propane cooking stove and a wood stove for heat.Here's the link to the website:http://www.fishlacseul.com/outpost.html"

514498,Keith,2001-08-16 13:43:00,48,Have a look at www.sawmill-lodge.com. They are just 45 minutes north of Parry Sound Ontario on Georgian Bay.
514499,Guest,2001-08-17 11:50:00,0,"For an inexpensive, do it yourself drive up camp I have been going to Paradise Cove 1 in Minaki for many years. The fishing is always good somewhere on the Winnepeg river system and Duane will tell you where and how deep.(bottom bouncing and trolling Big Sand Lake is my favorite). For 2001 I think Duanes weekly cabin fees were $210 canadian (about $150 US) per person and 16'boat & 40 hp Honda motor & depth finder rental for 1 week including 1 6 gal tank of gas per day was in the neighborhood of $900 canadian (about $585 US per week). Or for a bit more you can upgrade to a boat with 3 pedastal seats. By my estimates with 3 people per boat that comes to $345 US + taxes apiece. Since I bring my own boat, my memory might be a bit off on boat rental costs but not enough to go over your $500 per person limit. As far as being clean,.............. did I mention the fishing was good. Actually the cabins are OK considering they are mostly rented by smelly old fishermen who shower only 1 or 2 times a week. Running water, electricity, good screens on the windows, clean towels & clean sheets on the beds The pots/pans/dishes/flatware are a concoction of unrelated items from garage sales and the furniture is neat 70's greens and golds but I go there to fish not get decorating ideas.I do not have the phone # right now, so drop me an e-mail if you're interested and I can send you contact info.

514501,Guest,2001-08-19 19:21:00,0,"FAR,If you're heading up around Sault Ste. Marie, you may wish to check out Camp Kuha, which is an easy 1 1/2 hours north-east ofSault Ste. Marie.It's a new camp that opened last year, with very nice 2 bedroomlog cabins with nice showers/bathroom, new frig and stove, andthe camp has a sauna......fishing is good for Walleye, smallmouthbass and has some pike.....Camp is on Tunnel Lake, and operatedby Raimo and Joyce Ramo (Raimo is a retired Orthopaedic surgeon,who has invested some major $$ into the entire new camp, which was cut out of the bush).The camp's website is www.campkuha.comI and a good friend took our sons up to Camp kuha the first weekof June and had very good week (my son got an 18 lb pike, and Igot 2 smallmouth over 5 lbs, and lot's of 1-3 lb walleye).I went up last week again with other friends, and had another good week.....too much to tell, but I've fished all over easternOntario and this is one of the nicest camps. It is housekeeping,very clean, and costs $700 US....rates are on the website.Regards,Tyee"
514502,Guest,2001-08-21 01:20:00,0,"I would strongly recommend Eagle Lake Sportsmen's Lodge near Vermillion Bay on Eagle Lake. They are one of only two lodges on their end of the lake, and the owners (Jim and Cindy Buhlman) are absolutely super! The cabins are quaint, cozy, and stocked with all you could need. You just bring the food, the beer, and your tackle. The boats are nice and in great shape (many are brand new), and that side of Eagle has great fishing for Walleye. The bay less then 10 minutes from the lodge is a great place to catch Walleye in the evening on your way back to camp. Cost's are reasonable, the lodge is nice, and the fishing is good on that end of the lake. Can't ask for anything more! http://www.duenorth.net/eaglelakesportsmenslodge/ is their site, or you can call them at 1-807-227-5318. Tell'em Gene sent you..."
