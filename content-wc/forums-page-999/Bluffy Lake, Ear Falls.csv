Nice lake, two river systems, two other lakes by river, so area is very large. Only one resort on the lake, a few cabins. We seldom see other boats. Fishing has usually been good, nothing huge, but lots of smaller walleyes and northerns. 30 to 40 fish a day per boat is pretty normal, though I have had more, and less on a few days. Camp is clean, nothing real new (except he is building one new cabin I'm told) Keith Ammerman runs it, nice friendly guy, good basic equipment, cabins are nothing fancy but ok. Relatively inexpensive at 500 bucks plus your food and minnows. I posted just to see if anyone else had been up there this summer yet and how it was so far. Email me if you want more info at [email protected] Oh, its a boat in lake, so not readily accessible to drive in people. You park in the bush and Keith picks you up and boats you to the lake."
