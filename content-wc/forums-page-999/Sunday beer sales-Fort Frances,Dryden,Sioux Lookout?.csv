514523,Guest,2001-08-18 06:28:00,0,Have traveled thru Canada on a Sunday each of the last 4 years due to the timing of our camp reservations. Have not passed by any obviously open beer shops. Would like to help the Canadian economy by purchasing some real beer (and not bring US stuff across the border). Anyone know if there is a place to pick up some adult beverages in any of the above listed spots?
