514506,Dave in Mpls,2001-08-16 14:10:00,2336,"Good question, Paul. I've been wondering the same thing myself. Surely someone out there knows the answer to this!!"
514507,Guest,2001-08-16 17:39:00,0,"Yes, you need a US FCC license for your radio. Check out this link for info on VHF radio in Canada:http://www.ncf.carleton.ca/boating/us.html"
514508,PWaldow123,2001-08-16 18:53:00,198,"I don't know. The way I read that, recreational boats are exempt from licensing."
514510,eek,2001-08-16 19:53:00,72,"Just this spring when I bought my Ray 53 from boat US, I asked them about the use of VHF Marine radios in Canada, and they said that just this year the US and Canada agreed to drop the reequirements for VOLUNTARY SHIPS to have a license to operate in each others waters, this agreement is reciprocal, and is only between the US and Canada. I believe this was accomplished to promote safety on the water, and is not necessarily going to be a permanent situation. I also remember reading an article on-line, that said the same thing. eek"
514511,eek,2001-08-16 21:08:00,72,"After some research, here is url for the article I read concerning this matter, sorry, it is just huge.http://www.findarticles.com/cf_0/m0B...article.jhtml?term=canadian+radio+license.Sorry about the length of this thing. I would suspect that you could find the article by perusing the Boat U.S. website at boatus.com. eek"
514512,IaCraig,2001-08-17 12:04:00,434,"Yes you can use it without a license. I did not checkout any of URL's the others gave you on this post, however earlier this year I searched the Walleyecentral Archives and found some URL's there and checked them all out. Bottom line, after lots of reading I found a couple Ontario sites that clearly stated that due to fairly recent law changes you no longer need a license on non-comercial boats. If you want to read it yourself go ahead, however read it all because as I recall the rescinding of the previous law was near the bottom. IaCraig"
514513,PWaldow123,2001-08-17 18:14:00,198,Exactly the way I read it.Paul[email protected]
514509,Guest,2001-08-20 15:51:00,0,"This is the text excerpted from the above link:""A foreign boater who wish to legally tranmit using their VHF radio in Canada requires a valid ship's license plus an operator license. Call the the American FCC toll-free 1-888-CALLFCC in the U.S.A. or the Canadian government for current information about VHF regulations.Foreign visitors who wish to legally tranmit using their marine radio in Canada require a valid ship's license plus an operator license. U.S. boaters should read the FCC rules for VHF radios. U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Canadian government have recently created exemptions for VHF marine radio licenses for radios used in home waters, there are international treaties governing radio usage outside home borders that boaters must still abide by.""I read this to mean you need a US FCC license to operate your VHF radio in Canada. You do not need a Canadian license."
