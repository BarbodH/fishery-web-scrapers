514590,knappy,2001-08-21 11:56:00,77,Heading up to Lady Evelyn lake next week and was wondering if anybody has a report as to how the fishing has been the past few weeks ?
514591,Mean Mike,2001-08-22 05:55:00,115,"Knappy, I was at Lady Evelyn from July 27 - Aug 4 of this year, stayed at Island 10 Lodge. Fishing for walleye was pretty good, especially in the evening, usually drifting with a jig or spinner with a worm, we had good luck on the east side of Wolf Island, and at the supermarket. Smallmouth fishing was surprisingly slow, caught one 17 incher and some small ones. Pike were big and healthy, a 37 incher and 33 incher on Walsh lake, one on a black and white daredevl and other on crank bait.Email me and I can give more details."
