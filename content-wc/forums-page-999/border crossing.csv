513554,GregK,2001-07-10 11:48:00,113,We have been leaving the Chicago area early on a Friday and arrive at the Falls around 5:30. We cross within 30 minutes every time.
513555,Guest,2001-08-26 16:38:00,0,what is the best time crossing at peace bridge at new york?
513544,Guest,2001-06-25 16:23:00,0,In the past we always stayed at International Falls on Friday night and then went across the border into Canada at 5 a.m. on Saturday to miss the traffic.This year we will not hit the border till some time later in the day on Saturday. Can any one tell me what the wait could be on 7-7-01 at International Falls border crossing going into Canada?Appreciate any input. We are headed to Witch Bay Camp for the second year after a tremendous trip one year ago.Thanks.
513545,Guest,2001-06-25 17:16:00,0,"We crossed last Saturday at Baudette, we talked to some guys that waited 4 hours at International Falls, plus paying $10.00 to get across the Bridge, we didn't have any problem at Baudette over in about 10 minutes, they did some checking but that is par.Good Luck.Sharon"

The vehicle line was past Border Bob's and they were backed up double on the road East (?) of Border Bob's. We met a bunch of traffic coming towards International Falls....I don't konw what it would look like in the afternoon, but I would get across very early or take another avenue to cross..Walley"
513547,Okeye,2001-06-25 18:56:00,31,"It just depends. You could cross in ten minutes or spend hours in line just to recieve the grand prize of a four hour delay at immagration like I did a few weeks ago. Better luck to you but you can be detained and interrogated for no reason at all. It was a one in twelve year ordeal, but I would not wish it upon my enemies. Don't mean to be a downer, but I still can not agree with the treatment we recieved."
513548,Guest,2001-06-26 02:14:00,0,"We were detained by the USA guys for a while a few years back.We has to fill in forms that attested to us being Canadian as well as any criminal activity. This was all checked as they searched our vehicle and dumped all of our stuff. I know how you feel. I finally asked to see the supervisor and told him "" We are a couple of Canadians who are going hunting in Manitoba...Why all this?"" He came back a few minutes later and told us to have a nice day. The International Falls crossing still gives me apprehension every time I cross as a result of that detention. We had done nothing wrong and we have no record of any kind. I feel powers of search and seizure at our borders are out of line."
513549,Okeye,2001-06-26 18:42:00,31,"I gree with you thumper. I know it works both ways. I have heard the stories from my friends in the North, and I know that where I go in Ontario, everyone living there wants us to visit. The problem is that (going each direction) many of us will not return for our beloved vacations and trips. I think both countries loose in that situation. Is a one time 200 dollar fee worth ten, twenty, or thirty years of revenue from a prospective angler? Some people in our group dropped out this year after 10+ years because of the tightened border. I hate this because we love our Canada trip but some feel it's not worth the hassel. I hope something can be resolved, but I think we are going to try the Minnessota side of Rainy next year."
513550,Guest,2001-07-01 15:09:00,0,We crossed at International Falls on Saturday (6/23) at 3:00 p.m and waited in line for 2 hours. Cost was $6 American I believe.
513551,Larry S,2001-07-01 18:09:00,666,"Hit International Falls on Sat June 9th at 8am,had to wait about 45minutes to cross The fee for just a car is 6 dollars USA or 10 dollars Canadian.There are no fee's on the trip back into the USA"

I crossed on Saturday June 23 at 10:30 A.M. The line was long but moved along nicely. It took only one and one half hours to cross. If you get there latter, look out! Consider Rainy River Canada (Baudette MN) crossing. It is a bit out of the way, but not as much time in line. I have crossed there in three minutes!We crossed back into the states @ about 8:45 Saturday June 30. The line went out of site to the east. The cost is $10.00 with a boat on the states side at the Falls. No charge at Rainy River (Baudette). Where is Witch Bay Camp?"
513553,Guest,2001-07-03 02:59:00,0,Witch Bay Camp is located on Witch Bay LOW which is south of Kenora around 20 miles I think. Was awesome fishing last year and they say it is even better this year.
