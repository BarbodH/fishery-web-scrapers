1480537,Lovetofish,2012-08-28 13:54:00,458,How was the water level? Heading up that way the 10th. Hope the skeeters are better. They were the worst I've seen in 20+ years in July.
1480543,vett84.5,2012-08-28 14:10:00,20,"Water level to my understanding was high. It was not the highest Joe had seen, but a lot higher than last year. We heard another boat one night run inot a rock not too far from camp sight, so most of the rocks are under the water and not exposed. if that helps."
1480710,Lonefisherman,2012-08-29 03:30:00,13,"Fished Fitchie Lake many years ago in June. Caught a lot of Walleye shallow, 5-6 feet using spinners and minnows. Walleyes where descent size. A lot of northerns but where on the small size. Did not know much about the lake at the time we where there other than a friend had been there and had good luck so we stopped by and fished it for a couple of days. I thought that the size of the lake could easily handle smaller boats as there didn't seem to be a lot of huge open water. Water clarity was heavily stained and a lot of shallow water with many bays. Campgound by the access is where we stayed and did not have any trouble at all. Did hear the same story that you had to watch your stuff closely. Had a great time while we where there. Did not know of the other lakes you could get to at the time we where there but had I known would have loved to try them also."
1451762,vett84.5,2012-06-20 12:56:00,20,I will be heading to Lake Fitchie this August with my in laws. I am curious to what kinds of fish will be there. I can't seem to find much information on the net surfing. I am interested to know if there are any brook trout or lake trout in this lake. Any helpful information about this lake would be appreciated. Thank you
1451763,Lovetofish,2012-06-20 12:59:00,458,"I fish just up the road from there. You can expect walleye, northern, and rocks."
1451768,davis,2012-06-20 13:11:00,18,"It's been nearly 50 years since my family fished Fitchie Lake. Had a wonderful time there on many fishing trips. Yes, just walleye and northern. It became untenable to camp at Fitchie due to problems with break-ins or damage to personal property. Would love to hear, after your trip, that conditions have improved."
1479515,vett84.5,2012-08-26 07:07:00,20,"Ok here is the report back from lake fitchie. Got home Last night. We arrived Monday in the afternoon. Set up camp and had enough time to go out and hit a quick spot to catch supper. No real problems there, caught 4 nice fat 1 1/2-2 lb fish in less than an hour of fishing. had a few norhterns and some small ones in that time. Tuesday we started our adventure. we got 2 boats through to the middle lake, got our gear from teh portage trail and headed for the third lake. after dragging our boat to the 3rd lake we fished the rest of the day and left it there for fishing the next day. Caught a ton of fish, several 3-5lbs. (also caught 3 nice perch) Didn't keep track lots of fish. No huge lunkers, but was a great time. the 4th day we fished the middle lake after and caught a lot of fish, fishing was a little rougher, but still did well. My father in law had aportable fish finder, I really felt naked fishing with out one. the Last day we fished the Main lake, there was an East wind that blew all night and it rained, fishing was rough we didn't find much in numbers or size, but after that front came through like that it didn't suprise me. We didn't fish the main lake much, man is it big, but the neighbors beside us, also from iowa did and had good success. The conditions were not bad. Had no troubles with break ins, didn't see a single person that wasn't camping there. there were some dogs that barked quite a bit from the house down the way, weren't bad dogs, very friendly, neighbors kept feeding them or they wouldn't have been around as much. Mosquitos were horrible!! out fishing were fine but back at camp was constant bug spray. Out houses were a little rough, but was told that they weren't bad compared to the past. Hope that helps on the report back. Road was paved up to the lake, not much construction and fairly smooth for the most part except they were cutting in culverts in spots. Any questions for recent info feel free to ask. All fish were very healthy looking, saw lots of minnows every where we went, also saw a wolf in the back one morning."
1479595,Bill Krejca,2012-08-26 09:36:00,6107,"Just wondering where this lake is located. Thanks, Bill Krejca"
1479602,wallydave,2012-08-26 09:58:00,2151,"I just did a search its north of Savant. No results as far as an outfitter goes, maybe I need to keep searching!"
1479619,vett84.5,2012-08-26 10:32:00,20,"no outfitters, there are 5 camping spots i think. Its on highway 599, there is no elctricity, this was my first time to canada, but we did go by several lakes on the way up looked like lodges and outfitters along the way. My father inlaw has been going up there for over 30 years it is a tradition for him. from se iowa it is definately a haul. I am more of a trout and salmon guy. Any one have any brrok trout or lake trout lakes to recommend?"
1479718,davis,2012-08-26 15:07:00,18,"Thanks for the report. I do recall that the last time we drove in the camp it was quite overgrown and with a wet year = skeeters. Originally, 50-52 years ago, it was an open area. We were told it had been a road camp. That said, there were no outhouses either. Glad to hear no one bothered you. After Fitchie we fished Hamilton Lake, a bit north, for a few decades. The locals have built houses where the camp was so it is no longer accessible. Can't say that I blame them, nice lake."
1479820,vett84.5,2012-08-26 18:58:00,20,"It is accessable, no problems there. There is a boat ramp, it is sand and rock etc, not concrete but there is a boat ramp. the camp has fire rings made of rock. our site(didn't view any others) had 2 picnic tables. all in all it was fine, large site plenty of room. the site next to us had a mobile home and they had plenty of room. the mosquitoes were bad, but once on the lake in the breeze didn't have any troubles. the site needed a good weed wacking but wasn't too overgrown."
1479821,vett84.5,2012-08-26 19:00:00,20,"forgot to mention, as far as mosquitoes, my father in law said that this year was the worst he has ever seen. All i know it is the worst mosquitoes i have ever seen. so there is hope for the future as far as bugs go."
