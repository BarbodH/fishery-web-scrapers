1480481,Mudpuippy,2012-08-28 10:45:00,23,"Just got back the 27th fo aug. from Lac Seul Outposts. First the resort report.1. Nice resort positioned well in the middle of the best fishing on Lac Suel, especially muskies.2. Staff friendly and helpful, especially Chris, puts you right on muskies.3.Brenda and Ken friendly, but somewhat preoccupied with the fact that only two cabins were in use for the entire resort.....4. Somewhat pricey, BYO food, sleeping bags . cabins adequate..Rate 160 per person per day, Canadian funds, about 175 USFishingWalleyes: were easy, other cabin caught all they wanted, 1/4 once jigs and minnows, 14-22 FOWNortherns: good ones on surface musky baits, bucktails. trolling.. We caught Many over 35"" 4 over that 40""' plus mark.Muskies: My partner had never caught a musky before and I made a big mistake, boating a 47"" the first night. That created a case of musky fever in my Buddy Tom.... for the week he missed three nice fish, raised 5, I caught the one , missed two and raised 7. Last evening blew a fish well over 50"" by early setting. Chris had told me exactly where the fish was.All in all I would rate the trip an 8 out of ten, Big musky action, 10 of ten.Chris is an invaluable asset, listen to him vey carefully. I have chased the critters now for 44 years, fish on this trip was number 313 in my boat. Had a great time comparing Lac Suel fish with our Wisconsin fish with Chris, trully a musky fanatic......."
