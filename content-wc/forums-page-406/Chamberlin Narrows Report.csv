1480649,Mudpuippy,2012-08-28 19:47:00,23,"Just got back from Lac Seul Outposts Aug 27th.....Camp was nice and the staff was very friendly, nice kids from BC. Chris is the man when it comes to accurate up to the minute fishing information, especially Muskies.Ken and Brenda Robins were cordial, seemed to be very preoccupied with the lack of customers. My buddy Tom and myself were the only week long party, one other cabin had a group for a few days on two occasions. Not much for a 96 six bed outfit.The Fishing:I boated a 47 "" musky my first night there aand Tom got a bad case of Musky fevor, very dangerous at age 68, as he had never caught one. He had several big musky hits, but only one hookup and it got off .We did boat some really quality Northers 38-41 ""Other folks fishing walletes had all the fish they wanted, 1/4 once jigs and minnows were the ticket.Chris put us on some really big muskies, he was up to the minute on musky movement, and freely shared big fish sightings. The last night we were there it was very windy, a fish well over 50 "" missed my bucktail, **** it keeps you coming back.Norhterns Bucktails, Surface luresMuskies, florescent orande spinner blades on bucktails were very effective, black surface lures worked slowly over shallow weed beds seemed to be the ticket. We fished near camp, did not hit Wapesi, pickeral narrows or north. Big fish country, that Lac Seul."
