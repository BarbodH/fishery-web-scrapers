NWO has some of the very finest fly-in lakes available. My group has used NWO for many years flying to Wabakimi and have talked with other customers who have been to these lakes that you are interested in. Excellent reviews. NWO camps are always well maintained. I personally would be interested more in the Pipio/Dasant area. Dasant feeds into Pipio and Pipio feeds into Shikag and Shikag is truly a catch and consume trophy lake. I don't think that the big gal walleyes are aware of these lake boundaries."

Vic & Co. of NWO do a great job taking care of their clients and we have flown with them often. NWO has 2-cabins on Tesup. We like the island cabin the best do to being closer to the area's we fish and the view. We have always caught Walleyes on Tesup and the Pike can get pretty big. Go to their website, alot of info and the staff is very helpful with questions. lbl guy"
