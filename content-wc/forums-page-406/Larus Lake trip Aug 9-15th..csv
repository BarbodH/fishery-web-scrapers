1479835,phishfearme,2012-08-26 19:33:00,1242,"yeah - lets do the bet again - but, if by some chance i should lose, recognize that i would have to drive to youngstown to get a brownie jersy as we do not permit sales of that type of crap here in the 'burgh. why don't you ask for the point spread? not that i'd give it to you. phish"
1479945,tooski,2012-08-27 07:14:00,393,The reason I didn't ask for points is that I knew it would be a double digit spread and no way anyone from Pittsburgh would understand it. Mich Walleye Guy- I was told that Herod is considered their best large northern lake. What week are you considering swapping Larus out of?
1477964,tooski,2012-08-22 11:21:00,393,"We did a Thurs to Wed trip with Nestor Falls Fly-in this August. First time doing a mid-week fly-in and I really liked it. Much less traffic going up through I Falls. A lot of construction on the interstates of Wis and Minnesota however. We can end the generator debate that was posted earlier. They have solar with a huge bank of battery back-ups. All the lights as well as a large chest freezer and a huge new stainless electric fridge. They worked very well. Hot and cold to the kitchen and baths ( with shower). I have stayed at Winoga's Lake St Joe's outpost and it was the Hilton of outposts but Nestor Falls was its equal. Great floor plan with separate bedrooms, hardwood floors etc. Just a really nice setup. However we don't go for the cabin as much as the fishing. I had read numerous reports of the quality of Larus fishing and I have to say the first three days of 80 plus degrees, bright skies, and no knowledge of the lake made for what seemed to me average fishing. Caught plenty for dinner but it certainly wasn't what we were hoping for. It rained hard all night before a ten degree drop in temps and a change in the fishing for day four. The last three days proved all the reports correct. Find the right hump and fish for an hour then move on. Constant action. Nestor Falls has 2 cabins on Larus. It is a large lake so you can always find a little solitude. Dave said their is a private camp on the lake but hardly ever occupied. Well we hit the ""hardly ever"" week as it was full the entire week we were there. Also the groups on Larus that we talked to have been going there continually for 15 to 20 years so they head immediately to their favorite spots, which of course are the ones marked by Dave on our maps. Still as I said a good size lake so just move on. Once the fishing improved almost every spot held walleye. We tried to book Larus for an earlier timeframe when we left but it was full through July. I asked what they had available for May or June next year and they had one week open. That is one week for 12 outposts. I would say that speaks volumes for the quality of their lakes and service. We ended up taking an early week on their Mallette Lake outpost. So unless there is a cancellation, all 12 of their outposts are booked for May and June for 2013 already. Feel free to mail me with any questions."
1478001,Lovetofish,2012-08-22 12:27:00,458,How bad is the damage from last year's fire?
1478029,tooski,2012-08-22 13:30:00,393,No damage obviously to the cabin. Most of the lake shows shoreline that has been burned. Really interesting to see the extent of the damage. Maybe someone can explain to me why it seems the very top of the pinetree doesn't get burned. They all look like they have little caps of needles left on the very top. Anyone?
1478074,epiepenburg,2012-08-22 15:35:00,365,"I was in a group that went to one of their outposts in early June, fishing was pretty decent that time of the year. We had some rain every single day, but the fish cooperated nicely. Final tally this year was 11 over 24"", 6 northern over 36""."
1478816,phishfearme,2012-08-24 09:02:00,1242,"WOW - third trip this year!! what, don't you like it in cleveland? i guess i'm just jealous. so how was the size of the 'eyes? pretty amazing how weather can change things - or did you just get the ""patterns"" straight? solar with batteries is definitly the best way to go - but i guess they still had to have propane for hot water (only?) - pretty minimal propane costs and also minimal risk of running a propane bottle dry in the middle of your trip and losing all the pilots that need to be re-lighted - and of course one or two of them just won't re-light. phish"
1478831,tooski,2012-08-24 09:54:00,393,"Hey Phish, The eyes were pretty much all solid size fish. Caught a few smaller and a few larger but certainly nothing of note. Yep, propane for the hot water and stove. Everything else ran off the cells and ran well. I'm guessing the weather change was the major factor as we fished basically the same structure all week. The Minnesota guys in front of us said this was their 22nd year at Larus and the first time they did not catch a trophy walleye. And of course you are jealous. That is the main reason I went three times this year. To pissss you off. Are we betting on the Squealers vs Browns again this year? Joe T"
1478843,5richards,2012-08-24 10:13:00,131,Sounds about the right amount and size of fish that a Brown's fan could expect given their questionable football I.Q. -- I want in on the Eagles-Browns debacle --- Yes -- the Eags will win!!!
1478860,tooski,2012-08-24 10:45:00,393,"OK Rocky, you got it. The bet Phish and I make is this.-- Your team wins I must wear Eagles jersey one day in Canada. Brownies win you must wear Browns Jersey one day on Little Vermilion and of course the pix must be posted on WC. Deal? Good thing I make multiple trips because I will be wearing a lot of strange Jerseys with the sorry Browns as my team."
1479432,michigan walleye guy,2012-08-25 21:03:00,95,"Hi--I've been to Larus Lake every year since 2001, and can attest to the quality of the fishing and to the accomodations. They are spectacular, especially the brand new beach cabin. Dave and Michelle run a very first-class operation. I've also been to Clear Lake (also with Nestor Falls outposts) the past two years, and would say the fishing there is the equal of Larus. The great thing about Clear Lake is the fact that there is only one cabin on the lake, and you never have to worry about somebody being in your favorite spot, which occasionally happens on Larus.Could anybody here comment on Herod Lake, another one of the Nestor Falls outposts? I'm looking at maybe swapping out our Larus slot for one at Herod, but would love some contrasts from anybody who's been to Herod. Thanks!!"
1479442,Guest,2012-08-25 21:38:00,0,"Was just to Herod in July and fishing was great, the cabin was awesome. The plenty of numbers for the walleyes (if the wind was blowing), biggest eyes were just shy of 25"". Northern was so so but we didn't fish for them to hard, largest being 27"". I echo everyones comments about a nop notch outfit, I would recommend trying Herod."
