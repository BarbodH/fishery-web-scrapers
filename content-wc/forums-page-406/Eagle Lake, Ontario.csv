1477908,Mike Kansas,2012-08-22 09:23:00,1463,Gord needs to set his goals higher. If he is pacing over me imagine what he would do if a real fisherman were looking at his camp. Mike Kansas
1477936,v-bay gord,2012-08-22 10:15:00,3168,"oooooohhh baby! I like the imagery........but I don't have a phone in the fish house. Plenty of good places for Mike Kansas to pick from.......but still, ooooooooooh baby!"
1477977,Mike Kansas,2012-08-22 11:40:00,1463,"I'm going to talk to my buddy about coming to your place in September v-bay gord. Tell me how the fishing is so I can get him commited. He is looking for Walleye & Smallies and of course a 50"" Musky. Me, I just want to catch some fish and relax. Keep in mind my buddy is a catfisherman and wouldn't know a Musky from a Pike. You can PM me at [email protected] Best Regards, Mike Kansas"
1479548,Chops,2012-08-26 08:34:00,56,Heading up later this week for a few days. Staying in Temple Bay area. Look forward to fishing Eagle every year. It seems that it comes and goes way too fast. Might have to take a second trip next month. Truly a great place to fish.
1479983,Danbear,2012-08-27 08:41:00,72,"Just got back Saturday night from Birch Dale Lodge, had a great time, weather was almost too good had blue bird skies everday but one when we had a big thunderstorm on Thursday afternoon that was fun to watch. Cheryl and Marcel were great hosts, we took the diner plan for the 1st time and ate like kings, most nights I didn't even have room for desert. Fishing was a little slow as fish seemed scattered but we still caught some real nice fish, even caught my 1st Eagle Lake Musky although it was a junior sized one. Made the trip down to Buzzard Falls finally, what a beautiful waterfall. Now it's back to work and start planning for next years trip to Birch Dale. Thanks to Cheryl and Marcel and their staff for a great week. Will try to post a few pics when I dig out my camera."
1477588,MC620,2012-08-21 16:13:00,91,"+1 on Vermilion Bay Lodge. Gord is a great fella, and so is the rest of his family. Clean place, good boats/motors, and it's a treat drinking OV in his fish house while he cleans your catch. I wouldn't hesitate to go back. (soon I hope) (rumor has it he's also a musky ace)"
1477599,HeHooksHimself,2012-08-21 16:51:00,725,"I have driven by Eagle Lake and stopped to fish there 0 times. however, if I was inclined to fish Eagle I would certainly consider Fin and Feather or Birchdale since these two lodges worked to save fishing trips booked by but screwed over by another. That smacks of good will, hospitality and a spirit of service. My hat is off to them for serving others at their sacrifice."
1477674,fishmaster,2012-08-21 18:53:00,209,I would recommend Vermilion Bay Lodge. Very clean family run camp. All eqiupment is well maintained and Gord will go the extra to make sure your stay is the best.www.vermilionbaylodge.com
1477682,NARDA 1,2012-08-21 19:03:00,636,"Mike, come on up to Birch Dale Lodge www.birchdalelodge.com Sept 8th through the 15th the NARDA group will be there and you can come to our ""WING NIGHT"" on the 9th. It would also be great to meet you and we can show you around."
1477695,troutwater,2012-08-21 19:32:00,299,And they take great precautions for safety keeping the gate locked all the time!
1477717,brant,2012-08-21 20:11:00,89,I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Vermllion Bay Lodge also. Gord and Suzanne will take really good care of you.
1477841,Opie,2012-08-22 07:19:00,129,"I will throw in another recommendation for Vermillion Bay Lodge. Been going there the last 2 years in June and is the only place I am planning on going to in future years. Gord and Suzanne are some of the nicest people you would want to meet, the camp is very clean, and the fishing......well, it is Eagle Lake! Dean Thorn"
1477861,kcguy68,2012-08-22 08:02:00,51,"I can't say enough good things about Fin & Feather. They turned a bad situation into a good one for my group. If you are looking at fishing the West Branch, check out Vermilion Bay Lodge. I have heard many outstanding things about them as well. I wish I could head back up there next month....I am jealous. Good luck to you."
1477862,Mike Kansas,2012-08-22 08:05:00,1463,"Thanks to all for the great comments about the Lodges on Eagle Lake. Going to make a decision this weekend with the other guy who is going. Hope all is well for you and yours. Best Regards, Mike Kansas"
1477877,SinOrSwim,2012-08-22 08:34:00,1528,"I can just see Vbay Gord right now, pacing back and forth by the fish house phone.....fists clenched......c'mon Mike Kansas.......oooohhh baby, we could get Mike Kansas......c'mon Mike Kansas....... Have fun wherever you go!"
1477526,Mike Kansas,2012-08-21 14:21:00,1463,Looking at Eagle Lake for a fall trip this year. Would love to hear from anyone with Lodge recommendations. Just like to catch some fish and have a great week. Mike Kansas
1477532,nemusky,2012-08-21 14:36:00,60,Bear Trail Lodge is a stand up place. In all seriousness I have heard a lot of great things about Andy Myers Lodge.
1477540,wallydave,2012-08-21 14:48:00,2151,"Fin and Feather stepped up to take in the folks from Bear Trails closing. That kind of customer service should be rewarded! Good luck Mike, what jigs are you using these days!??"
1477552,jiggster,2012-08-21 15:07:00,183,I would also recommend Eagle Lake Island Lodge.
1477559,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-08-21 15:17:00,235,I agree...great savings if you prepay!!!!
1477564,Mike Kansas,2012-08-21 15:41:00,1463,"wallydave, Thanks for the recommendation. Master Walleye Jigs Orange/Char have been the ticket this year for me. Mike Kansas"
1477566,SinOrSwim,2012-08-21 15:44:00,1528,"I have never been there but I think Vermillion Bay looks nice and I think Vbaygord represents his lodge nicely. From his posts and videos etc it seems like he probably runs a pretty nice operation. Plus, by the sounds of it he cleans all your fish??? I wonder what it's like if we stood behind him with a beer asking him to hurry cuz we are hungry? j/k"
1477572,Hawkfan,2012-08-21 15:50:00,237,
1477574,JayM5209,2012-08-21 15:51:00,1050,"Vermilion Bay Lodge. Thus far I've only been able to spend one week there, but I'll return. Absolutely one of the cleanest, best equipped, friendliest, most comfortable, places I've spent time at in 33 years. Top notch customer service. I wouldn't consider any place else on Eagle.This is not a paid commercial! I just believe in lauding those places where I've had excellent service or gotten top quality products."
1477580,oxdrift2,2012-08-21 16:00:00,37,"We stay at Birchdale Lodge every September. It is on Meyers bay. Lodges are not very busy that time of year so your options are good any where you decide. We stay there because there is a bar and steak house on site and we don't have to leave. You would be minutes away from the west arm and that gives you some safety from the fall winds. It is also very good musky area. There prices are good, good boats, motors, cabins etc. Family owned and the owners live year round on the lodge site. Good luck on your choice and have fun!"
