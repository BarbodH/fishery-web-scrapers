1479984,Danbear,2012-08-27 08:45:00,72,"I was up at Eagle Lake last week, I have US Cellular and was able to use my phone right from the lodge how ever I could not send or recieve texts or get my voice mail but didn't really want too any how."
1479997,camp chef,2012-08-27 09:21:00,915,"When we cross the border, phones get turned off and stay off until we return to the States. I guess you could call it it a self imposed technology blackout... We wouldn't even consider staying at a camp has television in the cabins."
1480028,wallydave,2012-08-27 10:35:00,2151,"I agree that part of the reason for getting away, is to get away from all of the gadgets, emails, calls, pagers that make up part of day to day life for many of us. It is nice to have the option of having cell or internet service. I was able to call, text and post reports from Goose Bay this year. I didn't ""need to"" but I was able to. The only time my kindle fire or cell phone were on was to make posts or calls, otherwise the silence and the ability to leave the ""normal"" world behind was much the same before the service was available! We have the choice to stay plugged in or not! I'm good with that!"

Once you take off the only contact you can have is with a satilite phone only used for emergencies.No phone, lights,tv,or radio. You will survive the week with out your daily fix of phone.Relax and catch fish, its the best part of life. I can asure you that yours and the worlds problems did not go away."
1479403,Bobbajig,2012-08-25 19:52:00,24,Does anyone know how I can get cell phone service up here? Got to camp today with wife and found out U S cellular would not work. Also had purchased a tracfone and was assured by a coworker who had stayed at a lodge less than a quarter mile from here that it would work. My wife is really upset that her kids have no way of getting in touch with her should an emergemcy arise. Does anybody out there have any suggestions. Thanks so much.

1479420,NARDA 1,2012-08-25 20:34:00,636,The closest tower is in Vermillion Bay and is part of Dryden Municipal Telephone Service. According to their web site they have roaming agreements with AT&T and T-Mobil so that may be your problem. I have no issues with coverage in the Vermillon Bay area when I'm up there but I have T-Mobil. So you may just be out of range of the tower. Here is a coupleof links to the DMTS website http://www.dmts.biz/cellular-phones/coverage-roaming/http://www.dmts.biz/wp-content/uploads/Current2G.jpg
1479431,hodag17,2012-08-25 20:58:00,96,"Well, your lodge must have wireless internet, right? you could try google voice - or... if you have an iphone and your kids do as well, you could use facetime via internet."
1479439,Guest,2012-08-25 21:28:00,0,"OHHH Man Throw your cell phone in the lake Your on Holidays And I'm Serious Kick it old School If there's an emergency it will still be there when your done your holidays Believe it or not it wasn't that long ago that we didn't even have cell phones Relax and quit living your life banking on an emergency Should of, could of's,would of's I'll bet that the odds are so remote that an emergency will occur during your trip are uncalculatedable (Is that a word?) Now go fish and have fun!!!!!"
1479441,Guest,2012-08-25 21:33:00,0,The lodge Has internet Use e-mail if need be Now like i said Go Fish and have Fun......Thats an order Forget everything at home
1479456,Happy Camper,2012-08-25 22:35:00,22,Have the kids call the lodge.
1479472,oxdrift2,2012-08-26 03:27:00,37,"I have US Cell and it worked last year. Only draw back is the cost...WOW do they screw you. My friend told me the reason some phones don't work is something to do with either digital or analog service. In the past I bought a Pre Pay phone card from Walmart or any other store and used the camp pay phone. It worked very good and you don't have a bill to pay when you get back. have her run to the bay or last resort to Dryden. As another Walleye Central Member stated, have them call the camp number. Everyone is good about passing along messages. Even if you get a call, you can't do anything anyway unless you have a plane. Remember one of the N.A.R.D.A. rules. Relax and enjoy. Forget about everything for a week. Save some fish for us and give us some tips. 10 days to go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

If you phone to another computer, the service is free. Am in the Sioux Lookout area, and sound quality very good. Cost is only $0.023 per minute. Or you can subscribe for a year and for $2.00 per month you would have unlimited outgoing call minutes. For an additional $5.00 per month, Skype will assign your computer a telephone number and you can then receive incoming calls from cell /landline phones."
