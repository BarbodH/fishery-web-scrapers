Our biggest walleye was caught there in late August. Sturgeon Falls is always a good option in the fall when temps start to drop. Definitely check out the places marked on the map that I sent you of Lower Wabakimi. While you are in there check out the Outlet that feeds into Smoothrock. I would also check to see what's up on the main outlet up in River Bay that feeds into Kenoji. Fish where it's marked on the map. If ya get bored with all that, go to the West End. I'd be surprised if much is happening at the Trapper's but definitely worth the trip. Doesn't take long to find out what's up. Have a great trip!"
1480120,Kwags,2012-08-27 14:29:00,48,"That is very good advice Pikeslayer. Don't know of anyone who has spent more time than you on Wab (well, maybe that Trapper). Most of those places produced last year. I'm still not sure where Rusty's Back Door is though! We will be going into Wab on Sept 7th. May have an extra bed if you bring those cooking skills with you!Thanks for the Map. It was very interesting and gets a person pumped."
1480145,Pikeslayer8,2012-08-27 15:47:00,1460,Rusty's Back Door is just what the name implies. It is the 3 deep pools in the transitional channel that feeds into Lower Wabakimi directly N.E. from Rusty's camp. After the 3 pools it opens up into Lower. At that spot the water depth goes from 4' quickly to 35'. Fish that break. Don't tempt me with that offer of an extra bed. I'm not sure if all the good camp food in the world can counter my snoring. Lol
