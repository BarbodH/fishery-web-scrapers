1480273,pattmit,2012-08-27 20:22:00,36,Any preferences? Have usually used a regular XT line 8lb. What does everyone else use...fishing for walleye obviously. Vanish? Sensation? Stren?
1480323,Steve of Madison,2012-08-27 21:46:00,230,"I use XT as well, but 12lb. I have tried the floros etc. but nothing seems to be better than another."
1480329,Burr,2012-08-27 22:16:00,8612,"It varies, might be as light as 6 lb xl, or as heavy as 20 lb.Generally, I use lighter line for spring time finese fishing with small hooks and no color, no beads, no spinner early in the spring.Through the heart of summer, I'll use 8-10 lb xl. In the fall, when pulling spinners, the bigger the spinner the heavier the line. It helps keep line twist down when pulling bigger spinners."

1480441,pattmit,2012-08-28 08:48:00,36,Any thoughts on vanish? Has a little stretch to the line but may help with coils in line? My dad said poor experience a few yrs back and hasn't tried since
1480477,adempsey,2012-08-28 10:40:00,963,My current rigs are either Trilene XT or P-Line Fluorocarbon in 8lb test. I'd use any mono in 6-8lb test as long as it doesn't have bad memory. Any of the superlines should probably work too as long as you're not one to worry about fish seeing the line.Vanish has a bad reputation so I'd do some research on it first so you can draw your own conclusion.
1480486,worthsr,2012-08-28 11:01:00,52,I use 30 pound nylon coated steel line. It's eliminated the bite offs and the fish don't seem to mind.
