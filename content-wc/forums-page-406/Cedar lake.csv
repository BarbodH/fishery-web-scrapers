Ray will have a more up dated report when you arrive. We found fish in Moose bay out in front of the weed line in 7-10 fow, but that slowed down after a few days. Gull island gave up some fish. Walleyes were caught in front of the reef out in 17 fow, and bass on the SE side of the island. The hump on the west side produced nothing. The reef on the back side of the island camp worked well in 24 fow.We used crawlers with spinners and jigged with salted minnows, back trolling all the while. Water temps would reach 75 at the peak of day, but in the early am it will drop to 71 degrees. I don't think water temps affected the fishing just a fyi."
1478724,go dart,2012-08-24 06:10:00,77,"Just got back from Perrault/Cedar yesterday. Walleyes were tuff until 8.22. Then stable weather allowed them to be predictible. Cedar Point may be sending fishermen into Perrault to fish past Cedat Island a bit as I would see several of their boats there each morn. I did catch walleyes on some points just south of burnt bridge in 19ft of water. Most the walleye fishing on Perrault was 25ft and along the Snake wall but sat-sun-mon were tough. We had our best Pike fishing in Perrault ever and some nice sizes. One guy at the lodge had a 41"" boated and said he lost 2 larger. We boated one smaller Muskie, I lost a mid 30 at the boat, and had numerous big boys crash at baits. I suspect they were reaction strikes cause they missed the baits. Believe it or not I had most my action on a simple bass style spinner bait. As a bonus we landed 3 of the dammest smallmouths Muskie fishing the slop in 3 ft of water. I mean these were very large smallies. Easily 5 lb class. We fished hard for smallmouths but they're deep and we finally found a pattern drop shotting those dropoffs on points. Had to have pinpoint accuracy though. A sudden death in the family brought us home early but you can never plan on that."
