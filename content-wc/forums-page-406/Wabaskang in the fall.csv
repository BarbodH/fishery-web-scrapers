1479055,Guest,2012-08-24 17:48:00,0,Going to fish the Wabaskang the first week of September. We always fish this lake the first week of June and catch lots of walleye but I know later in the year fishing patterns change. Rockpiles and deeper water are my likely targets. Any help specifically on the Wabby?
1479124,packpro,2012-08-24 21:31:00,695,"We fished Wabby in late August about 7 years ago. It was our first time on the lake. No one in camp except us. The owner was away during the time we were there. In short, no local knowledge available. We struggle for a few days looking for fish. It was our own fault we fished like it was spring 10-25 FOW. We would pick a walleye occasionally, but no real good spots Everyday while we were looking for spots we would see small groups of boats in what we though to be very deep water 50'-90'. We thought the boats were fishing for Lake Trout. If we got too close just to lay down a GPS mark the boats would go into a tight formation to keep us off the spots. We have pretty good etiquette and would never squeeze into a spot. It was are intent to lay down a GPS mark and return later when the spot was available. No luck. Those boats were on those spots consistently for 4 days. We checked out a few other camps and did get some local knowledege. This is what we found out. In the spring an area called the narrows was the spot to be on. In the fall, There are a few humps, sunken islands, that rise out of the deep water. Those were the spots that held the fish in the fall. Must have, since the fellas in the non camp boats raced to those spots early every morning and held those spots all day. Wish I had more exact info for your trip, but my trip was a few years ago. However if you see guys fishing in water that is in the middle of nowhere, it just may be one of the humps rising up. Hopefully someone can help with the exact spots"
