1479616,zeebee,2012-08-26 10:27:00,1144,"Took my 2nd trip into Trout Lake...Booi's Lodge north of Red Lake,Last year my son landed a 33lb Laker. This year it was apparently my turn. I'm not usually chasing NP's but my son was insistent so I helped him set up his gear while I chose to remain with my preferred walleye trolling set up which includes 8lb Suffix Elite and a DD perch Husky Jerk. This time of year big eye's and NP's often like to hang out in 20- 35' around points and mouths of bays. When he hit my initial thought was snag but I quickly realized the water was beyong snag depth .... 15 min later and with much luck given the hardware setup, I was admiring a beautiful 46"" fat NP. The fight was amazing as he tail danced twice and I expected to lose him any second as a hooked NP on leaderless mono is almost a loss guarantee....I got lucky, a great memory and a pic to sharehttp://i683.photobucket.com/albums/v...202012/043.jpgFor those interested....the elevated terrain in the background is a glacial esker that marked the southern boundary of an ice sheet glacier (thousands of feet deep) where sediment and rock was deposited as the ice melted... now a designated nature preserve.As a further note, Trout Lake and Boois lodge is a great combo and for pretty obvious reasons I will be going back again and againCheers"

1479935,mroyle,2012-08-27 06:42:00,74,How was the Walleye fishing...numbers?
1479942,zeebee,2012-08-27 07:09:00,1144,"As good as any place Ive been and as a Cdn resident Ive had opportunity to fish many a good lake in N-W Ont and Manitoba. Ave size was impressive so that by mid week I was concerned about slot sizing but I found a point with a flat, approx 12-18' depth, and we filled with sub 18"" in an hour on harnesses. What really impresses me with this lake is the ease in which we were able to pattern the larger eyes with cranks (my fav technique). If I focused on numbers Im sure we could of boated 50-75/day/each with not too much effort but Im not a jig fisherman...gotta keep on the move I suppose. The only other fellow in camp that week liked to jig and he claimed 100+ on a few days.The laker fishing was superb ...we averaged a fish every 15 min with a portable rigger at 65' over 100-150'. Accomodation too is very good...three bedroom ...three bathrooms....dishwasher and as inexpensive as any fly-in can be reflecting, no doubt,the short 18 mi flight. Therein lies the beauty of this very large lake as there is no road access whatsoever so, you have a top tier fishery yet, low flight time/costs because of it's proximity to Red Lake."
