1478875,SinOrSwim,2012-08-24 11:17:00,1528,"Yes, but our outfitter always brought stuff like that on check flights. In addition, several years they would bring in new mattresses or wood for a new deck or dock in when they came to pick us up. We helped them unload everything. So, they can take all that when they come in empty to pick you up and restock fuel etc.I guess the point I'm trying to make since it sounds like it is his first fly-in is to talk to the outfitter. If they are that strict, find a new outfitter. The point is to enjoy yourself. Those aren't cheap trips and most of us only get one per year so don't deprive yourself of something you want to take. I'm sure there are worse things but running out of beer or batteries for a radio when you are in the bush stinks! We have been there."
1479101,remmy,2012-08-24 20:26:00,6,No way our group of 4 could make it on 400lbs of gear/food/beer. Our gear weighed out to just over 2000lbs this summer. We take a lot of beer though. Our outfitter does not have weight restrictions.....thank the Lord!!! They always fly us out on the bigger plane.
1479123,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-08-24 21:23:00,235,"Our outfitter has also been lenient, despite a published weight limit on their website. Members of our group have been going there for over 20 years and bringing a group of 6 to 11 guys each time (usually 8 or 9). I'm guessing we get a break because of that. Some years we've really brought a stupid amount of stuff."
1479239,octanehi5,2012-08-25 09:47:00,1104,"It is doable to make the weight I have done it. And have taken many trips that were over. To make weight you will only bring the bare min. one case of beer. You have to deside if its a fishing trip or beer drinking trip if its a beer drinking trip its going to cost you.Our outfitter has beer at the lake, $15 a six pack $60 a case of 24.if you drink more than you thought. its not cheep. at $.75 to $1.00 per pound fly in over charge.Its much cheaper to fly in extra weight than to buy beer at the lake. If your drinking 100+ cans of beer on a fly in trip you may want to check into AA, I can say you would not be on my A-list to take one of my trips, I take my fly in trips very seriously on the fishing side, 3 -4 beers a day is plenty for me. I feel if you need more than 48 beers in a week on my trip, thats a six a day you are being a little excessive.My fishing bag is 50lbs thats sonar,rods, reels, bait, tackel for two guys. I saw one guy post 15 lbs on here, I would like to hear his inventory on what he brings, My jig box almost weighs that much"
1479260,TIGHTLINER,2012-08-25 10:49:00,223,Years ago my group always made weight or if we were over 20 to 30 lbs we were never charged. We always used water from the lake or river boiled it for 20 min and no one ever got sick. We took a bottle of something in and either drank that with water or a case of 7 up. Over the years I have always looked for items that had to be mixed with water or eaten dry. Most of those guys are no longer going and I have turned to the younger generation to fill the group. Most of these guys like their beer and several cases of beer or water add up in a hurry. I guess in the spring you are always going to be packing more cloths because of the colder weather that could come your way. Being over weight costs each of us $25.00 give or take $5.00 either way. It is everyones vacation so a little extra is not going to hurt any of us so pay the extra and go fishing and enjoy the week with friends. One never knows when it could be your last.
1479263,adempsey,2012-08-25 10:55:00,963,"My rod case with 5 rods and reels in reel case were about 10 lbs. My tackle box for three people was 27lbs (seven Plano 3700 trays), but it was excessive and I know I could reduce it more. I did not include sonar with that. I brought a flat of worms which was about 3lbs.I have to admit that I am a tackle junkie though. If I knew I could get away with bringing more, I probably would. I'd even pay the extra fees just to make things easier. I just think one could easily reduce it down and still have a great trip. I mean, how many jigs does one really need for a week??"
1479275,RickOnt,2012-08-25 11:21:00,217,Yes!This will be my first Fly -In and the planning and preparing is getting me more excited than I already was LOLI am gonna get the bathroom scale out and do a weigh-in.I am sure I have enough Jigs for a year!I am planning on some adult beverages. Thanks to all for the repliesRick
1479293,Mich_Fisherman,2012-08-25 12:52:00,292,"For our group, we generally tend to be 60-65lbs per person for gear and 35-40 lbs for the food and ""community goods"" (walkie talkies, first aid kit, batteries, etc). We pack personal items (clothes, fishing tackle) to the 65lb target and then after the food shopping we re-adjust. In our case the outfitter doesn't really have control of what gets flown in on the overweight as he contracts the flight service. He has no affiliation the flight service. We seem to be over slightly every year but its usually flown in on an ""over load"" flight later the same day. We also will wear our rain gear (if we're close in weight) and carry in items such as jigs, reel, etc. The first year we all got onto the plane looking a little bloated. The process gets more streamlined each year yet always remains a challenge."
1479620,SinOrSwim,2012-08-26 10:33:00,1528,Judge much?
1479699,Larry Mac,2012-08-26 14:23:00,530,"Nicely stated Pikeman 14, Great post Lunker Have a great year We are flying out Labor DayThank you,Larry Mac"
1479702,wallydave,2012-08-26 14:31:00,2151,Thanks for all.the replies! I'm hoping for a 2014 trip to new waters. All the replies are great for making plans! This kind of thread is why WC is a great resource!
1479344,@Lunker,2012-08-25 16:03:00,835,"Something I wrote up some time ago about packing for fly-ins. Admittedly, I have nowhere near the alcohol appetite many of you do. Each person's baggage weight is usually limited on fly-ins  each person has to give up x lbs of weight (I think it was about 15 lbs each for our group of 4) to the group's quartermaster for food allocationPlan on having steaks for your first or second meal  they will of course be well frozen  anything else that can be should be well frozen - you will be transporting your perishables from WI to the take-off point in standard, hard-body Coleman/Igloo/etc coolers  just moments before weighing gear and takeoff, transfer your perishables to styrofoam coolers (much much lighter), using the steaks and other frozen items (bacon and/or sausage for breakfast) as your ice  duct tape the coolers closed  burn the coolers (as opposed to dragging them back home) after you arrive in camp and transfer your goods to the refrigerator  the frozen items will last plenty long for thisAs part of menu planning, spend some time wandering through a grocery store, looking at items very carefully to see what you can adapt for purposes of lightweight menu planning  also don't be afraid to try some of the dishes at home before making final menu decisionsThink in terms of powdered drink mixes (iced tea, sugarless Kool-aid, powdered Crystal Light, etc)  unfortunately I have not yet located a powdered bottle of beer or martini  instant potatoes can be used both for a side dish as well as fish breading  look at self contained dried noodle/rice dishes  take along a bag or two of frozen vegetables (chopped broccoli, corn, etc) and add a cup or two to the noodle/rice dishes to both bulk them out and add some varietyTransfer everything possible (even canned goods such as baked beans, etc) to ziploc bags to 1) increase convenience, and 2) eliminate weight  obviously, you'll now have to keep these perishable items in the coolerPre-measure your menu items out in ziplocs before leaving home and write the directions directly on the ziploc with a magic marker  for example, pre-measure a meal's worth of pancake batter into a ziploc and write the directions on the plastic bag (ex: add one cup water and two eggs)  the time spent at home is worth time saved in campSame thing for dessert  for example, empty large box (or two) of pudding into ziploc  pre-determine and add the corresponding amount of instant milk so all you have to do is add water  and again, write directions on the bag Also bring along a bag of chocolate chips and perhaps walnuts or raisins and add a handful to each batch of pudding or oatmeal to zip it up a bitConsider taking a fish grill if nothing similar is provided in camp  it's very economical in price, lightweight and takes up little room  allows you to bake or grill fish rather than taking the extra weight of oil and breading for fried fish  then just leave it in camp when you're done rather than dragging it home againDon't forget a small but broad supply of spices  salt, lemon pepper instead of plain pepper, crushed red chili peppers or hot sauce if anyone likes a bit of zip, a bit of dill, etcDO consider that small something special if your weight allocation will stand it  perhaps a bottle of wine (and a corkscrew in your pants pocket) for that steak dinner and a small bottle of REAL maple syrup instead of Mrs Butterworth's for your flapjacks those little creative treats can be very special as the wolves are howling in the distanceThink very very seriously about fruit  in the past, our guys said they wanted it but then most went unused  and it weighs a LOT in a relative sense  we finally decided if anyone wants fruit, they bring it on their own as part of their own weight allocation, rather than against the group's food allocation  yes, fruit's good for you but a bottle of vitamins weighs a whole lot less if you're not going to eat the fruitIf you're not already using them, look very seriously at zip-off pants  they are SUPER for this type of application  zip off the legs and convert them into shorts for warm days  you only need two pair for the entire weekConsider the layering concept when packing your clothes  and pack very very judiciously  sacrifice a third shirt for a pair of long underwear bottoms which you might need, etc - you really will be surprised how long you can wear a pair of socks or underwear or a shirt when you need to consider weight limits  and in worst case scenario, you can always rinse out a few things, wearing the long underwear while your pants are drying  after all, who's going to see you, except for the bush pilots flying wayyy overhead?If you think you'll be needing an anchor, just take a length of ¼ rope (30'-40') and a replacement nylon landing net bag  just fill the bag with rocks and tie closed with one end of the ropeShare the weight responsibilities for items everyone will be or might be using  think sharing rather than individual use  first aid kit, bug dope, pliers, etc  how many tubes of toothpaste or bottles of shampoo do you really need?  sounds small, but in the long run, it all adds up, especially in your case when you're trying to figure out how to get three more muskie-sized crankbaits packed into your limited weight allocationFor liquor, can you be satisfied with a bottle of booze rather than a case of beer?  the bottle will weigh much less than a case  I pre-mix a bottle of Manhattans and just take the single bottle for the weekIf you have something like a fly-fishing vest (perhaps borrow one if you can), stuff as much of your heaviest tackle as you can into those pockets and wear it under a very light jacket  don't let the pilot see and you'll get away with it not counting against your weight limit  of course, the plane won't know the difference whether it shows or not, only that you really ARE over the weight limit and you'll probably crash and burn anyway!!!Eliminate the weight of the tube you might transport rods in  split your rods into two separate groups  place each half of the rods opposite each other, tips to handle and vice versa, making sure the handles stick out slightly further than the length of the tips (in other words, the handles extend a bit further so the tips are protected and won't break off  tightly wrap newspaper around each end of the package and tape tightly with duct tape (lining with newspaper first prevents the duct tape from sticking and stripping off cork from the handles when removed)  this creates a fairly protected and sturdy package of fishing rods that won't need the extra weight of a tube to protect them  then just exercise a bit of care when placing them into the planeAlso, JUST IN CASE you end up over your weight allocation and intend to reduce baggage rather than pay for your overage, HAVE IN MIND the order in which you intend to reduce your gear rather than waste time prior to takeoff humming and ho-ing, trying to decide about what am I going to leave behind?"
1479605,pikeman14,2012-08-26 10:04:00,144,"Great Post! All of the information here is spot on. Why should a 4 day trip have the same weight limits as a 7 day trip? You will obviously have more weight in food. I was going to tell my guys to keep it under 100 pounds for our trip. But instead told everyone it's going to be 50$ a person more to fly in whatever we have to on a second plane, just in case we go over.For most fisherman your Canada trip is the mecca of all fishing trips! I personally am not going to nickel and dime myself out of a bit of comfort and more importantly...tackle. We will just keep it all within reason. The posts about storing food in boxes (not coolers), raingear as pants, wearing all of your heavy clothes on the plane, and group items being shared are tips everyone should look into. That is the perfect way to minimize your weight. There are some true veterans with great info on this thread. Thanks to all."
1478441,RickOnt,2012-08-23 13:20:00,217,"Ok So your weight limit is 100lbs.How do you divide that up? ie. 30 lbs for tackle including rods/reels and bait, 30 lbs for clothes including footwear,raingear,sleeping bag and 30 lbs for food including drinks,coolers/ice, kitchen supplies and things like garbage bags and TP.anyone have a formula or something they try to stick to?ThanksRick"
1478446,SinOrSwim,2012-08-23 13:26:00,1528,"never looked at it that way. Then again, I always tried to pack light but if I wanted it, I took it. My theory is if I am going to spend that much on a vacation, I'm going to do/use what I want. I will pay the extra fee if needed.But, our outfitter did not charge us for overweight. We always just took whatever the limit was (weighed everything before it went on the plane) and then he flew the rest in later on a check flight. So, we tried to keep essentials in certain totes or bags and then non-essentials separate so they could be flown in later. They always flew in extra beer, pop, water etc on a later flight. Usually the same day and sometimes the following day or two.Doens't make a huge difference but I tried to save on clothes etc. We always go in late August or early/mid Sept. I never took pants. I took all shorts and then used my rain gear as pants. That way I started out warm and when it got hot during the day, I could take my rain gear off."
1478561,octanehi5,2012-08-23 17:58:00,1104,"We try very hard to not duplicate fishing items,one guy brings the jigs and lures for two men both bring rods. wear your clothes for two days,Rain gear. plan your meals a head of time.eat lots of fish fly your beer in with you its cheaper. boil the water in the lake to make it potable.By all means bring it if you think you will use it. Very important to keep track of stuff you brought with you last time and did not use.do not make that misteak twice.It does pay to weigh your things before you leave home.Be ready to pay for overages 100lbs is not alot on a weeks fly in. On your very first trip you will be over."
1478579,SinOrSwim,2012-08-23 18:36:00,1528,"Our outfitter always put all of us on the scale and then figured how much gear they could take. So, while they always said 100lbs it changes if you have 5 guys or 7 guys. If they told us 100lbs per man no matter how many we had, I would find another outfitter. I know Slate Falls Outposts and Red Pine Lodge Outposts don't charge as long as you are willing to fly some stuff later.But, it wouldnt' matter if you put all your jigs in your pocket, teh amount of weight the plane can carry is still the same."
1478639,hoppy63,2012-08-23 20:38:00,367,A case of beer is roughly 22lbs!
1478699,GOBIG,2012-08-24 02:29:00,126,"Ask the outfitter to fly your water or beer in early. Or, if they do a flight check mid week, have them bring it then. We tried staying under ""ONCE"" and found that it is easier to bring more money for overages. Remember, it is your vacation. Enjoy"
1478710,RickOnt,2012-08-24 05:05:00,217,Yes The Molsons would cut into the 100 lbs very quickly!I am likely heavy on my clothes estimate and light on the food/beverages.Rick
1478839,adempsey,2012-08-24 10:09:00,963,"I would just take a certain percentage of weight for food/shared items from each person (like 50lbs) and the rest the person can figure out how to distribute amongst their own personal gear. If you plan on eating fish every day, I am sure you can reduce that even more. I am sure 15lbs per person would be PLENTY weight for rods/tackle/bait - unless you're bringing in live minnows.Pre-fly in your beverages if you can. However, overage charges don't seem like they are very much either. Something like $1 per lb, but I think it's more problematic when the flight is chartered from a third party [my last trip they were quite strict]. So, like already mentioned, it's probably not really worth worrying too much about BUT plan ahead like SinOrSwim said and have gear separated by what you need and what you can bring in later."
1478848,SinOrSwim,2012-08-24 10:27:00,1528,"And, discuss this with your outfitter beforehand. 4 cases of beer is about a 100 lbs. An extra $100 for your beeer seems crazy? THere are outfitters who try to give you the 100lb but it's a variable number and there are outfitters who are strict. My guess is they make extra money this way. There is NO POSSIBLE way to take tackle box, rods, reels, fish finder, battery, clothes, food, bait, beer etc and keep it under 100lbs. You could if you were Les Stroud Survivorman but that guy barely eats for 7 days. You have to take food just in case you don't catch fish. In addition, if I am spending over $1000 to go on vacation, I'm not taking freeze dried peanut butter sandwiches to eat all week. Granted, we always catch fish but you have days where weather is just too bad to go out. Or, what about breakfast etc. I go on vacation to enjoy myself. There are definitely outfitters out there who are not as strict as the others. The two I mentioned previously would roll their eyes at us but they never charged us overages and believe me....we were WAY OVER! :O"
1478871,Pymbet,2012-08-24 11:05:00,42,"When we weighed in 90 pounds over weight this year (690 instead of 600) our outfitter said nothing and off we went. But I did get to thinking that every pound over we were, was one less pound of other things they could be flying in. That 90 pounds is 13-gallons of gas or a propane canister that is not going in on our plane and will have to move later on. Ten groups a week, 12 weeks a year at 90 extra pounds adds up to 10,000 pounds of gear (5 tons) over the summer. Not sure how many extra flights that adds up to."
