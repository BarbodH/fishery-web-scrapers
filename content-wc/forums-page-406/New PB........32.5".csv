1478993,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-08-24 15:39:00,235,That's a gigantic fish for NW Ontario. VERY few fish that size. That thing would look like the Goodyear Blimp full of eggs.

1478811,Limeyangler,2012-08-24 08:57:00,563,"Got my new PB today of 32.5"".30'FOW on flats near the drop offs were key, it was on a deeper lake that holds Lake Trout too.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNFNK5DUP7ATight lines all."
1478817,phishfearme,2012-08-24 09:06:00,1242,very cool!! congrats on the major trophy! i have found that lake trout lakes - which are clear in in-fertile - will produce fewer but larger walleye - this your experience? what lake was this on? phish
1478821,Pikeslayer8,2012-08-24 09:18:00,1460,"Holy ssssssssmokes! What a day of fishing. You really laid into the big gals. Big huge congrats on your pb 32 1/2""er. They just don't get much bigger than that."
1478852,wallydave,2012-08-24 10:34:00,2151,Nice work! I bet that was quite a battle from that deep!! I bet seeing that big girl swim away felt good too!
1478854,NathanH,2012-08-24 10:35:00,697,Amazing Fish!
1478855,Hawkfan,2012-08-24 10:39:00,237,"Wow! What a day on the water! The video was only 10-11 minutes of your day, but those 10-11 minutes would make a whole day. Those were some big walleye and just one after the other. Thanks for sharing."
1478863,Limeyangler,2012-08-24 10:50:00,563,The video is edited...that is about 4 hours of fishing condensed into 11 minutes.
1478867,Hawkfan,2012-08-24 10:53:00,237,Oh I got that. I'm just saying that small fraction of your day would make a whole day a great one. I just didn't word it very well. I must have still been in awe of your mad fishing skills!
1478877,new hips,2012-08-24 11:26:00,498,"Great day on the water...............You are one lucky guy, to have that kind of fishing in your backyard. Save a few for us poor folk............I'll be up September 1. Great job Limeyangler............Thanks for posting !"
