1478187,Mr Walleye,2012-08-22 19:38:00,29,Hi DaveAny suggestions as to where to stay over night before flying out from Nakina?
1478188,nwont,2012-08-22 19:38:00,16,"If you go left, you are in the Crib Rd. it comes out on the highway halfway between Geraldton and Nakina. It is the way I allways take when going that way. I wouldn't advise taking the Blueberry right now because they are doing some work on the Twin Lakes Rd between Nakina and the Blueberry. Its not supposed to be very good. I would take the Crib if I were you, it was in good shape last week, by far better than the stretch between Aroland and the Esnagami rd. It will save you 30-40 min."
1478205,tooski,2012-08-22 20:17:00,393,"Nwont, We always have gone right on the Crib Road ""Y"".. If I remember right that leaves about 24 miles on the hiway to Nakina. Definitely shorter and usually maintained. So taking a left shortens the time on Crib road? Thanks..."
1478211,nwont,2012-08-22 20:43:00,16,"Oh sorry, I was talking about the first 'Y' a couple hundred yards off highway 11. The seond 'Y' is right, but both of those roads go to highway 584, but the right brings you out a few miles closer to Nakina. There have not been trucks hauling the last year or so, so most roads have been kept in pretty good shape. So just off highway 11, left is Crib, right is Blueberry."
1478270,wallydave,2012-08-23 03:24:00,2151,"Sorry this is new territory for me, check back here or with your outfitter. Good luck!"
1478294,deputy dog,2012-08-23 06:31:00,305,"we stayed at lower twin pines one year and pennock's another. liked pennock's better because it was rite in town and closer to restraunt and road to lower twin lakes was very wash board and dusty. both were about $25 per guy. pennock's office is at gas station on way to cordingly lake which is where most, if not all, outfitters fly out of. neither place is the hilton but both were clean and served the purpose. hope this helps!"
1478379,hoppy63,2012-08-23 10:19:00,367,There was also a motel in nakina that we stayed at....not the hilton....but last good HOT shower for a week! Think it was around 100$ dont remember name though
1478970,Mr Walleye,2012-08-24 14:26:00,29,Thanks DD!
1478980,TIGHTLINER,2012-08-24 14:58:00,223,Check out the r & d apartments for a overnight stay in nakina. Was clean and comfortable for one night. I believe it was $25 or $30 pp.
1477125,northsky99,2012-08-20 18:07:00,41,Leaving on Friday O'Sullivan lake near Nakina>Was wondering if anybody has been on Blueberry rd lately and what the condition of the road was. Is it worth taking or would you suggest staying on the pavement and go through Gerladton?How much time does it save? Thanks and Fish On
1477183,TIGHTLINER,2012-08-20 19:44:00,223,There has been talk about this road early part of this year. Might try doing a search on it. We were told to stay on the main road. It does cut off about 30 to 45 min driving time from some of the posts.
1477301,onetimedave,2012-08-21 05:45:00,502,Have traveled to Nakina 16 times and have found the main route is longer but quicker than the logging roads or secondary routes. Also the drive is easier.
1477541,wallydave,2012-08-21 14:50:00,2151,"I'm looking into a trip to Nakina one of these days. Do you know of any places to stay in Ontario, if coming from Duluth? Thanks"
1477581,northsky99,2012-08-21 16:07:00,41,going thru the soo sorry
1477592,unclepaully,2012-08-21 16:37:00,112,"We were just up there last week. I was not familiar with the ""cribb rd or blueberry rd"" at all besides what I had read on this site. So I convinced my dad & uncle to try it. We took the road but when it we came to the y we went left which still seemed like a shortcut. I can't speak to how the blueberry is all the way into Nakina. I thought the road was in good shape for the most part, a little washboard at times. Didn't see anyone else except for one truck parked off the side of the road fishing."
1477679,wallydave,2012-08-21 19:00:00,2151,Im from cen. Il would the Soo be shorter than Duluth? Ill have to try google maps! Thanks!
1477727,pike50plus,2012-08-21 20:28:00,584,We stayed at a Lower Twin lakes cabin in Nakina for $25 Friday night and made dinner there.
1478166,northsky99,2012-08-22 19:14:00,41,"Leaving friday morning for Osullivan lake near Nakina Think we will just stay on the main roads ,Thanks for the information Fish on"
1478175,tooski,2012-08-22 19:21:00,393,"UnclePaully, Since you went left instead of right at the Y where did you come out at? If you stay to the right the total drive is 20 miles."
