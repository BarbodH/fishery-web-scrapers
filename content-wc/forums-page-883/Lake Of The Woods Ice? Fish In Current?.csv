530227,Guest,2003-04-27 09:37:00,0,I've noticed quite a few boats on LOW by Kenora over the last week. How's the fishing in the channel been? Also anyone know if the ice is off Clearwater Bay yet? Or how long they think it will be before the ice is off. Thanks Guys Bomber Bob

530231,guide7,2003-05-01 18:11:00,70,hey cbprov! Is the Clearwater you mention the one in Ontario also known as the Clearwater / Pipestone chain? We have a trip planned to Pipestone on May 16 and hope to still work the trout on the surface.7 out
530232,Guest,2003-05-01 20:35:00,0,The ice is off of Sabaskong. I can see open water at Rabbit Point and Tar Vat. There is still ice from Brule Point to Fish Narrows but only for a few more days. Tomorrow should be 70 degrees. Only a few weeks until walleye season opens.
530233,Guest,2003-05-01 21:05:00,0,THE ICE BLEW OFF THIS MORNING. WE ARE GOING TOMORROW. I THINK MAY 16 WILL BE TO LATE. THEY WILL BE DEEP ALREADY. GOOD LUCK BOMBER BOB
