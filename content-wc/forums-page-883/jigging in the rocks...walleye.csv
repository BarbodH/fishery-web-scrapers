530414,Guest,2003-05-03 05:29:00,0,"An alternative to jigs is a slip bobber-especially when rocks, wood or weeds are a problem. Set the bobber's depth about a foot above bottom. The way to do this is to clip on a heavy lead weight on the hook that is heavy enough will sink the bobber. Keep adjusting until the bobber is about a foot below the surface. Remove the clip on weight and bait the hook. If you anchor upwind you can control how far our from the boat your bottom is. Start about 5 feet from the boat and buddy can be 10 feet, 15 feet, etc."
530415,Guest,2003-05-03 05:32:00,0,Met to say keep the hook about a foot off the bottom by adjusting the bobber's depth. You can play with the adjustment. Obviously the water's depth at the boat and depth at the bobber can vary.
530416,Guest,2003-05-03 07:44:00,0,"Slip bobber rods are generally longer 7 foot plus. Some like slow action. When the bobber goes under you wind the excess line in until you feel the fish and then sweep the rod. BTW, slip bobbering is supposed to be good pockets in weed beds and when the fish are in a negative mood. You just soak the minnow in front of them until they deign to bite.If you want a more active method of going after walleyes in the rocks, bottom bouncing should cover more ground.

530419,Guest,2003-05-03 10:17:00,0,I have my best luck jigging on rock piles and rock shorelines.Once you get on to this method it can be alot of fun.I usually use 3/8 or 1/2 once jigs on a med tip rod.I also have my reel set up with fireline so there is no stretch in the line.I try to positon my boat above the area i want to jig.Just snap your jig and let the fun begin.Once you master this you won't want to fish any other way.This way of jigging works excellant in Canadian lakes and most of our rivers.
