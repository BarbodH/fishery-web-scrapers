530366,Guest,2003-05-02 16:21:00,0,Pakwash Lake has a decent small mouth fishery as well as excellent walleye and northern.But if you haven't booked yet there's not much chance of getting in any of the camps for that time of year. Good luck
530367,Guest,2003-05-02 16:23:00,0,"I hope someone can prove me wrong on this, but I don't think there is any real good smallmouth fishing close to Red Lake, it's out of their range. Pakwash has a few, I think there is a lake close to Woman River that has some, but that is quite a hike from Red Lake, and ther may be the occasional small lake that holds a few. If someone knows of others , please tell me I don't know what i'm talking about. Quetico Park, or Rainy Lake,that is smallmouth country, Red Lake area is walleye country."
