530089,duffy,2003-05-01 17:41:00,49,I hear Red lake is going quick. I will be flying in 135 miles north of red lake and am thinking the northern lakes will be out by May 7th. Any word on water levels?Duffy
530079,Guest,2003-04-23 09:31:00,0,"I fly out May 17th. I know the ice will be gone by then, but I like to find out when. What is everyone's prediction? My guess, and it is strictly a guess, is May 7th. Am I early or late.I am definately getting the itch.Adam"

530082,Guest,2003-04-23 19:01:00,0,I'm looking out at Howey bay right now and having a Blue if I might say(don't worry the only thing I'm driving is my lazy boy)but the ice is going fast if the weather stay the same I think the ice will be out by May 3rd.Adam who ya flying out with?Duffy how was your trip to way north last year.
530083,Vitreum,2003-04-23 19:30:00,221,i've been watching the dryden weather the past couple of weeks and it appears to be about the same as we are having in maryland. ice out should be no problem for the opener up there.
530084,duffy,2003-04-24 05:22:00,49,"Bud,The trip was excellent! I had 8 pike over 40"" and three walleyes between 25 and 28. Lots of lake trout as well. My buddy also had three trophy pike with the biggest being 46"". For the most part everyone in camp had great fishing inlcudng a friend from California who had over 200 fish in one day between him and his partner on setting net lake. My group of 8 had a total of 21 pike over 40"". I will be up there June 6th to the 13 this year. Can't wait!!!!Duffy"
530085,Guest,2003-04-24 06:10:00,0,I will be flying out of Red Lake to Sportsman's Lodge. Owned by Brett Geary and run by his brother Kevin. Been to Sportsman's Lodge twice before and always had a great time. Very good pike fishing. The 1st time I went was the middle of June. The 2nd time was the 1st week in June. This time we decided to go earlier. May 17th - 24th. Hoping to catch the big pike in the backs of bays and in the river mouths. I would love for the ice to go out somewhere between May 10th - 14th. I don't think I will be that lucky.If anyone has been there before and has some tips let me know.Thanks Adam

530087,Guest,2003-04-29 09:10:00,0,Can someone give me some type of info on how much ice their still is on Red Lake? Any idea of when it might go out?ThanksAdam
530088,Guest,2003-04-30 05:34:00,0,Still freezing at nite Gullrock seems to be going out faster it's open in front of my camp.I say Gullrock will be out in 7 days and Red Lakes in 10 days The MNR closed the dam and the lakes are starting to rise. Looks like normal year.
