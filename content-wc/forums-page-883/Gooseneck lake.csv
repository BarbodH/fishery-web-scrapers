We got stuck in one of those small 4 man cabins. Going to stick 5 guys in it. I will be in the green 20 foot lund. Pull on up and I will buy you a beer.We caught the trout on Ciscos. Marked quite a few fish in 40 feet of water, dropped the Ciscos down and kind of jigged them around."
529947,Guest,2003-05-01 05:28:00,0,"Dick,I forgot to mention that we slayed the northern on a lure called the Cisco Kid. My uncle died and left me his fishing equipment and there was an old beatup Kid in there. Works every time. A friend of mine Shawn ""the dinger"" also has caught a monster with his at Cygnet. Shawn likes to spend a lot of time at the dock, with the Sneakster, when he is not eating."

529944,Guest,2003-04-29 13:17:00,0,"Dick,We stay at a resort right down the road at Cygnet Lake. Usually we try and get over to Gooseneck at least twice during that week. Once in the morning and once in the evening. The northern are pretty thick up in the weeds. A few nice ones too. Have also got some trout out of there. The ramp sucks!"
