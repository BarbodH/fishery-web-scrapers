530282,Guest,2003-04-29 07:46:00,0,Going to Clay Lake approx 10 miles North of Vermillion Bay on May 24th. Does anybody have feedback on this resort(NorthStar). I received general information from the owners but would love to hear from the people who have fished this lake in recent years.How is the lake/camp? I believe this is part of the wabigoon river system.

The resort owners were not the friendliest hosts, but maybe it was because we did only a half week, didn't do a meal plan and brought our own boat. The last 2 times we fished Clay, we actually stayed in Vermillion Bay and trailered to the lake each day. There is at least one public access area, but the road is not the best. We had our best fishing the 2 years the water was at a normal level, pitching jigs towards shore along sandy shorelines, we also had good luck evenings fishing the jugs. You should have a great trip. Report back and let us know how things go."
530286,Guest,2003-04-30 19:05:00,0,"Been going to North Star for over 15 yr, missed a few here and there, but going back June 21.It is on the Wabigoon river and North Star is the only camp. That early smaller fish will be in the river inlet, other spots: Sand Narrows, West Narrows, Macintosh bay and North arm. Stan and Sam will be able to tell you where to fish. Long trip down the river to Seguise bay could be fruitfull, fish some of the rapids on the way for Pike.The camp is nice, clean and great food. As years have gone by they have expanded and as a result it is crowded, especially going and coming to the dock, however once on the lake it is fine. I bring my own boat and no problem, also no extra charge for dockage or launch like some resorts."
530287,Guest,2003-04-30 19:33:00,0,Check with the MNR they use to put sign up near public ramp saying the lake has problems with pollutions it seem the paper miil in dryden drains into the lake.
530288,Guest,2003-05-01 10:28:00,0,"went there along time ago. was good fishin the while we were there. however, we were told the lake was polluted do to a paper mill. i would check it out. that was a long time ago--20 years ago or so. maybe it is better. it use to be run by gettings and the camp and cabins were tip top."
