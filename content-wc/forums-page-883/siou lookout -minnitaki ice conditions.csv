530213,Karl,2003-04-25 20:43:00,63,"All ice in Sioux Lookout area will be gone by May 4th - that's from a local expert. My guess is still May 1st. Two weeks ago it was 40"" thick. Yesterday it was 20"" and going fast. Water levels are at an almost record low, so Abram chutes may be especially productive this year."
