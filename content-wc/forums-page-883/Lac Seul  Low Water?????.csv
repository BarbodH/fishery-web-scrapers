530360,Mike KS,2003-05-01 06:04:00,18,Heard a rumor that Lac Seul will be significantly below normal water level this year. Wonder if any of the Lac Seul locals have any input on this rumor. I cant remember ever fishing it when water was low but it always has been good fishing so I hope low water wont bother fishing....watch out for rocks.
530361,Big Tim,2003-05-01 06:20:00,63,According to this link: http://www.lwcb.ca/ Click on Basin data for all kinds of charts. Lac Seul is at near record lows. I thought last year was low( We were there BEFORE the big rain the first week of June). This year looks like it is even lower! I'm praying for rain.
530362,Guest,2003-05-01 08:18:00,0,I was up 2>3rd week of May last year and LS was higher than normal. did it drop that much in 2 weeks?I remember many years when the was low and the fishing was just as good! Don't worry...plenty O' fish to be caught!
530363,Guest,2003-05-01 08:19:00,0,"Lac Seul is exceptionally low. Last year was low but not too low. The spring of 1999 was the last really low year, but right now levels are a couple feet below that. The relative lack of snow in NW Ontario the past two years, the dry fall last year, a long winter drawdown because the lake is a reservoir, and a small spring freshet have combined for very low levels. That said . . . one big rain event (2 days) can easily raise water levels a couple feet, again because the lake is a reservoir.The spring of '99 was tough at the opener. If this was because of low water levels we may be in for a tough opener once again, but it's only a matter of time before levels begin to rise. On the good side, we can extend our docks right now without getting our feet wet.Jay"
