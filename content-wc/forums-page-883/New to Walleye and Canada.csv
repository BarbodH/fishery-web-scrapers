529524,Guest,2003-04-07 10:25:00,0,"I tried Walleye fishing for the first time last year and caught a 6 lb eye. So the logical thing to do was make this years family vacation a Canadian Fly-In to the Gouin Resevoir Quebec this August. My wife is still spinning from me canceling our annual visit to her folks in Florida. But my 9 yr old son and 7 yr old daughter already have their gear packed and are practicing their casting.We will be well stocked with Spinners, Jigs and Reef Runners. I'd like to know what color Reef Runners you would not be without???thanksbob"
529525,BD,2003-04-10 15:26:00,739,"I like perch, trout, rainbow, crawfish, orange, gold flash and silver flash. I don't use Reefrunners but find these colors work well."
529526,Highlander,2003-04-27 16:14:00,6,So then...parlez vous Francais? be prepared for shabby treatment because you speak English and especially if you're American. Cancel your trip now and try Northwestern Ontario where the real fish are and where real men fish.
529527,Dan,2003-04-27 21:49:00,325,That couldnt' be farther from the truth. What's worse is that you know it. Pretty easy to stir up that pot of hatred
529528,jigman 2003,2003-05-01 09:39:00,981,"I am not ""stirring up that pot of hatred"", however, it is my opinion that if you want to find lots of Canadians who don't much care for Americans, then go to Quebec. The French influence is by far the most noticeable there. Just my two cents."
529529,retire55,2003-05-01 11:37:00,1029,"Jigman 2003:Without question, you are entitled to your opinion. However, I and perhaps others would appreciate what statistical evidence or any other evidence you have to support your opinion. Without providing any such support, it is rather easy to perceive that your opinion is perhaps gut-based or that it is discrimination based. Either way, it isn't worth 2 cents (not even Canadian)."
529530,Guest,2003-05-01 11:47:00,0,just take your wife and kids and have a great time. the less you listen to on this site the better your vacation will be. good luck
529531,Guest,2003-05-02 13:34:00,0,"I am an english Quebecer,I have lived here all my life and I really can""t speak any french.Sometimes you might have a little trouble with the language thing in some of the bigger cities in certain areas,but even then most people try their best.But when I go up north I find the people extra nice because they make their living from tourist fishing,especially American(money talks...etc...)The stuff this guy says is just crap,people are people.."
