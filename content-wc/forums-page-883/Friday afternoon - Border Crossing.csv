What has been your experience with trying to cross the border around 5-7pm on a Friday afternoon in late June? Are we in for a big wait? Is 3pm any better? How about later? Trying to schedule our departure/arrival to help time this better.Thanks Â– Jigger1"
530250,Guest,2003-04-28 10:47:00,0,We cross at about 1:00 on friday afternoon. Never a wait.
530251,Guest,2003-04-28 12:25:00,0,Always cross at Baudette/Rainy River at 5:30 on Friday afternoon. Never have to wait.
530252,fishmaster,2003-04-28 12:45:00,209,Where are you crossing over at?Crossing over at International Fall is or has not been a problem.Wait can be maybe 15 minutes tops unless you get pulled.
530253,Jigger1,2003-04-28 13:14:00,234,"Will be crossing at International Falls. We're driving from Chicago and I'm planning an early departure, problem is one of our party is flying into the Falls and doesn't land until 6pm. I see the Beer Store is open until 9pm on Fridays so we're good to go from that stand point!"
530255,Karl,2003-04-28 18:51:00,63,"I have always crossed at Intl. Falls on late Friday afternoons (leaving from near Milwaukee). Never had a line to wait for or any other problems. I thing their computer system actually expects me at that time since I've been there, done that for so many years now."
530256,Karl,2003-04-28 18:53:00,63,I fish better than I spell.
530254,rpieske,2003-04-30 18:01:00,1276,"You won't have a problem crossing at I. Falls after 5:00 pm on Friday. Saturdays can be a problem, but since they have the new border station, the traffic moves faster. I usually time my crossings (usually about a dozen per year) to avoid weekends. Have a safe and enjoyable trip."
