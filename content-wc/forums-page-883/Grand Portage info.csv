(I know, its like taking a woman into Mexico.) Could any of you guys tell me where the best place would be to get our beer before we go across the border. Any info appreciated."
529995,Guest,2003-04-21 14:53:00,0,"There is a duty free store on the US side of border.You can buy good Canadian beer right there .Its located at Ryden's store. You can't miss it,u can even buy the American swill there if you like it!"
529996,Arkie eye jerker,2003-04-21 15:00:00,228,"Do you know price of the Canadian Beer at the Duty free store. If there is not a ridiculous difference I'll get the Canadian Beer. I tried the LaBlatt's (SP) Blue last time I was there and really liked it.Thanks for the info,"
529997,Guest,2003-04-21 16:19:00,0,"As a matter a fact I do .. Labatt's is 12.99 for one case; 5 cases for $55 or 10 cases for $99 . You are allowed one case duty free, after that you pay $9.60 canadian for eachone which amounts to around $6 to $7 dollars American. By the way you can exchange your money at Rydens store Good luck!"
529998,Matches,2003-04-23 19:38:00,236,Arkie eye jerker I gotta ask the question. What American beer would you rather drink than the numerous great selections in Canada?
529999,Highlander,2003-04-27 15:56:00,6,"I agree! Other than MGD, there isn't any other American beer worth mentioning. Do you want a buzzz...or just piss all night? Go figure!"

All the beer here in Arkansas is 5%, although in Kansas and Oklahoma the beer is 3.2% unless you buy it in the liqour store. I really don't understand why the difference, except maybe years ago when the drinking age was 18 in OK and KAN. and they just never upgraded when they went to 21. Drinking age in Ark. has always been 21. What is the Alcohol content of beer in Minnesota? All I get out of 3.2 beer is a headache."
