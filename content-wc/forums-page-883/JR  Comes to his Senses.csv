530371,The Eyes_Have it,2003-05-01 09:12:00,315,"Take me instead, I live in Kansas!"
530372,Mike KS,2003-05-01 09:14:00,18,We would gladly fill in with anybody who doesent fish Pike and pout when he cant catch Walleye.
530373,Guest,2003-05-01 13:31:00,0,Is this JR guy the same guy who was always hooked on Pike fishing until a Giant Polock showed him how to tie a Walleye Jig on?
530374,BD,2003-05-04 04:56:00,739,"Tell JR or BJ or whoever that he didn't go last year so you got someone else to fill his spot. ""Sorry you can't come but I will put you on the list just in case someone else stops going."" Then you could massage his ego. Tell him that he's so good he doesn't need you as a guide, and suggest he form his own group."
