Where do you fish in Canada? I want to stay away from your Lake because I heard you Iowa boys are Walleye catching machines.
530277,Hammerhead Herb,2003-05-01 07:16:00,259,"Not tough at all. Here in Illinois, you just need to get a form from the county circuit court clerk, fill it out, submit a birth certificate, and pay about $30. Of course, if you don't have a pass port, all you need is a birth certificate to cross the border."
530278,rebelrn2001,2003-05-01 16:21:00,1563,Need your picture too. Needs to be taken w/some specific specifications. WalGreens will take your pic for about $8.
530269,ginbud,2003-04-28 13:52:00,1,I heard that the laws may have changed since last year about bringing salted minnows across the border. Can anyone verify whether this is accurate or not? Also is there a web site or another source where you can look up laws concerning border crossing?
530270,Guest,2003-04-28 18:49:00,0,Try this URL http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/fishing/gen.html
530271,Guest,2003-04-28 20:14:00,0,"Why are you even bothering transporting salted minnows accross the border. You can buy them at any gas station or grocery store in Canada, they are right next to the ice cream in the fridge. The fish probably prefer our shiners anyway. They also keep longer if you buy them on this side. Do you buy jumbo shiners? Those may be hard to find.Where are you going? You might want to check to see if you can use live minnows at the lake you will be on. Nothing beats live bait for walleyes.You can also buy live leaches, worms and old stock beer(if you dare) for your salty snacks!Remember to pinch your barbs down it helps when releaseing the fish back into the water!Have a good time and leave some fish for the next guy."

530279,Bruce,2003-04-29 07:48:00,48,Whoever gave you this info didn't know what they were talking about.I called the Ministry today and you can bring 10 dozen per person.
530273,Kilroy,2003-04-30 04:50:00,59,"Is what I read at that site true about having a valid passport? Is it somthing new as in the past 10 years it was never required. Fishing trip is a little over 3 weeks away, I have always taken my birth certificate along in the past, but have never had to show that. Thanks.Kilroy"
530274,Trailerguy,2003-04-30 05:36:00,1407,"I went up two weeks ago- nothing has changed, didn't even ask for ID,just the old 20 questions game."
530275,retire55,2003-04-30 06:20:00,1029,"Kilroy:I telephoned the Canadian authorities this morning for clarification after I read your post and that of Trailerguy.American citizens ""normally"" are not required to show proof of who they are to enter Canada for stays up to 6 months. It is left to the discretion of the customs agent to request identification or not from American citizens. In the case where you are requested for identification, a passport or some other proof of identification (e.g. birth certificate, drivers licence, etc) would be necessary.In passing, I did inquire as to how Canadian customs agents discerned whether someone showing up at the border (in a vehicle with US licence plates) was a US citizen (without asking for proof of identification). That question went unanswered.If Americans and Canadians want some assurance that the people within our respective borders are legitimate, then we should encourage border authorities to always request proof of identication."
530276,Kilroy,2003-04-30 14:18:00,59,"Thanks for the replies. Just how tough is it to get a passport, any idea?Kilroy"
