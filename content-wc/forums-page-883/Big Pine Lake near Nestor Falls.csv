Understand it has new ownership.Any input on the profile of Big Pine... lake clarity, size, structure, access to other waters by boat, is the lake known for Northerns? Walleyes? an equal mix?

You can catch a limit of eaters usually but I have never seen anything big pulled off of there in the fall. Big Pine Lake resort is under good management now. He's working hard to upgrade the camp. The lake that time of the year is usually pretty stained. Last year my buddy went the week before I did and they had decent fishing every other day. The turnover was late and the lake was 2+ feet low so the fish were already full of minnows that were forced out of the weeds. We went up and had horrible fishing the whole week. I was ready to come home on Weds., we stayed but it didn't get any better. I called up there a couple of weeks ago and they said it was lower then they could ever recall. I hope they get the spring rains to bring it back up. The dam at the falls was leaking terrible and they didn't get it fixed until middle of October. Didn't mean to ramble on. Hope that gives you a little information."

I stay up in Nestor Falls for 4 months each summer and will try to find one for you. I'll get up there on May 15th and put the word out if you let me know which lake and what months.[email protected]
