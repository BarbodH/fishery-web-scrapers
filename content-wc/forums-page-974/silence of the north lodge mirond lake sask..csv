With the ever increasing pressure that some of the lake are receiving up there we decided to look at different places to try. One of the places that we looked at was Silence of the North. We never stayed there, as we got sick of the long drive, but we did meet the people that run the place, an we did fish the lake for a day. Definate two thumbs up. The people were great, we weren't staying there but, they didn't charge us a dime for access (they put my boat in and took it out) great lake, beautiful scenery and some excellent fishing. Just be aware that it is a little on the rustic side. One of these days I will make it back there."
