518241,Tracy,2002-03-17 15:58:00,376,What do you consider to be a big Walleye? 10-15#ers are caught regularly in the spring (now through April) in Lake Erie's Western Basin. Fish of the same size are caught every Fall off of Huron on Lake Erie from October to ice-up. Put the time in during these peak time and it will pay.Tracy

You can't keep anything over 22"", I thought the regulation change was dumb but I have caught nine Master Angler Walleyes over the years with the biggest at 31 inches. A big female that size will release 500,000 eggs during the spawn. You have to look at the big picture. Cranberry Portage is just south of Flin Flon and north of The Pas. It is a long drive 1100 miles north of Omaha, but I wouldn't have made the trip for the last 20 years if it wasn't worth it. I have had the big ones on one after another till my forearms and hands were cramping so bad I had to take a break."
