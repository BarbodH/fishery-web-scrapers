515871,River_eye,2001-12-28 15:37:00,1486,"where are you from? Whitemouth lake is always a popular choice, although it gets a lot of traffic. You need to use a snowmobile or car to drive to the fishing spots, and this year I wouldn't drive my car on the ice."
515872,Guest,2002-01-07 10:19:00,0,"River_eye,Thank you for responding. I live in Suamico WI. Unfortunitly the fishing in our area is not the best due to the lack of catch and release and a few who still believe a sucessful fishing trip is when you catch more then you could ever eat just for bragging. Although it is getting better.Do you know of any good maps of raods and lakes for southern Manitoba?Any information that would make this a memerable trip including points of interest in the area we would greatly appreciate it. Our main goal is to relax, catch some fish and injoy the scenery.We will be bringing either snowmobile or a four wheeler along to access hard to reach areas. Again Thank You,Mike"

515874,Guest,2002-02-18 20:54:00,0,"Whitemouth Lake is a good idea I just fished there this morning we got our limit in 3 1/2 hours. The walleyes we caught were between 16 and 21 inches and Don't worry about the ice thickness or the snow conditions 2 1/2 feet of ice and barely any snow, any car will make it out there..."

That's a great idea to form those bonds between generations.I would like an oportunity to talk to you about a great trip to Saskatchewan. I help put together memorable trips often.www.4bigfish.comSouthern or northern saskatchewan has lots to offer. The South Saskatchewan River can be the best in the world if you have help getting to the right spots.Mark Thomas[email protected]1-306-586-6275

I have fished there the last two years and it is Big Eyes on the ICE. We fished there a total of 8 days and averaged over 100 lbs per day per man. Big fish 13lb 7oz."
