518226,sdyer,2002-03-17 06:51:00,34,"I have always had a dream of buying a small lodge/outpost on a fly in camp in Northwestern ontario (RED LAKE AREA). I think I want to buy something small. I don't think I want this as my primary income but to do as a time share with a few other people amd maybe book a dozen or so groups per year to cover costs and yes, maybe make a few bucks to put back into the place with the goal of some day making it a bigger profitable place but always making sure it stays a world class fishery. The main goal is to find a great fishery so that we can fish it a few weeks per year. Here are the questions:Has anyone had any experiece with this kind of set up?If so can you give any advice?Any idea on costs on buying something like this?Does anyone know a place for sale?Being an american what should i know about owning some thing this in Canada?Does anyone have the same dream and want to talk about it?Thanks in advance for your help and you may email me at [email protected]. Take good care.Duffy"
