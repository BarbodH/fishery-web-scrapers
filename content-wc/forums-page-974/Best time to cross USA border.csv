518284,Trophymuskie,2002-03-18 06:44:00,254,This is a reverse question but I would like to know what are the times to avoid crossing over from Canada to the USA. I will be crossing over at Hwy 81 not that it matters much as most border crossings get busy at the same times. I normaly cross way early in the am but I will be hopefully crossing during the daytime this time around. I would like to know what time in the am does it start to get backed up? How bad is it at lunchtime?Thanks in advance.Keep releasing them allRichard Collinhttp://www.trophymuskiecharters.com
