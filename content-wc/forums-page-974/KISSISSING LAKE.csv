518320,Piscatorian,2002-03-19 07:53:00,12,"I agree. I've been there and I'd go elsewhere. Like a lot of drive-in lakes, it's a great lake that's seen better days. Ike will tell you tales a m---i---l---e long. I will say that they do have some good flyouts, though.They seem to have a lot of problems with guide turnover, too. The good guides go to longtime customers."

518328,Northern Manitoban,2002-03-19 15:51:00,195,"You don't need to fly in for big Pike,i guess if you can afford it but there is great lakes small and large that hold alot of trophy fish that you can drive too.I live in Northern Manitoba and fish alot.Reed lake is a great lake to fish at for all species.I go there mainly for the Lake trout.Its only 3 hours from my house.We have caught trophy pike there walleye's and lakers,the pike there are huge.Very nice campground and 2 lodges one is located beside the campground and the other on fourmile island minutes away from the boat launch.they have flyins from the lodges also.Tramping lake is another Lake close to Reed they are joined by the Grassy river system.This lake holds the same species of fish as Reed but more known for the big walleye's and Pike.Plus there are also many other lakes around this area that have awesome walleye fishing.FISH ON."
