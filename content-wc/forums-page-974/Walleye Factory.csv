518177,hgf,2002-03-20 21:31:00,199,"Gull Rock is up by Red Lake. Drive in lake with 5 to 8 resorts. You drive by Lac Seul to get there. Several camp grounds too. It is a good lake, but you will get some traffic."
518178,Guest,2002-03-21 07:12:00,0,I fish at Five Lakes Lodge there are 5 camps on the lake. But there are five Lakes you can fish right from the docks no portages.The camps but there slot limit on the lakes no fish over 18in. can be eaten.There are alot of big in the lake and alot of eaters too!www.fivelakeslodge check this one out
518179,RANGER,2002-03-21 08:58:00,4341,How about Lake Erie?? Fantastic Walleye fishing and you have a choice of teams:LionsBearsColtsBrownsSteelersBillsI don't know where else you would have that varied of a selection. ;-)
518166,Guest,2002-03-15 07:59:00,0,I want to find a lake that is a Walleye factory. I have spent most of my life catching brim in the streams of Tennessee and i have never caught a real fish or rooted for a real football team. Please give me your best shot on a great Walleye lake...and if you can let me know about a good football team that would be nice [email protected]

518170,WCoyote,2002-03-15 21:11:00,200,Lac Suel.....................
518171,Guest,2002-03-15 21:57:00,0,Lac Seul is the factory. End of story.
518172,Guest,2002-03-15 22:29:00,0,Lac Seul is as good as it get for distance with no flyh in at decent prices. If you want more info let mek now [email protected]
518173,Big Tim,2002-03-16 11:03:00,63,"I vote Lac Seul. Lots & Lots of walleye & only 1 or 2 per 100 is under 14-15"". Quite a few up over the slot (21""+). It's a real kick for us ""panfishers"" to hook into something that will take one look at the boat & start stripping line. 70 days & counting!!"
518174,Buddy13,2002-03-17 15:27:00,17,"Lake of the Woods is at a thirty year high, so can't be overlooked. It has to be the Woods and Seul. Woods has the size potential that no other lake in Ontario can match. Probably will get some disagreement but that's the way I see it."
518175,Guest,2002-03-19 16:38:00,0,I say Gullrock Lake I've fished Lac Seul and Gullrock. Lac Seul we had to travel to far to get on fish and there to many rock to hit and last but not least it gets to ##### rough we sat two days in the cabin. We've fished Gullrock in May and June and caught asmany fish off the dock as we could out in a boat are biggest being 28in.
