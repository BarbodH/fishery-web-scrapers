517796,Guest,2002-03-18 10:14:00,0,"don't think that the average American hunter/fisherman will ever understand the Canadian willingness to so freely accept more laws and restrictions controlling their lives under the umbrella of ""for the common good"". I think that we are a little more skeptical concerning the government and their agenda on various issues than our northern friends.The drinking and driving and boating laws have been on the books for fourty or more years.I agree with the statement to a point but I feel that the USA is far more rule orriented than Canada ever will be. Candians are the proverbial ""minnme"" of the USA. We just don't have a 44 under the seat and a fifth of Jack Daniels. Here we drink beer and watch ""Cops"" and comment on how violent and terrible it must be to live in the states. When a cop gets shot in Canada it makes the front headlines of all the newspapers in the country. I kind of like that. I also like that my employer cannot randomly test me for recreational drugs....I understand that is common in your country. But it is for the common good is it not."
517797,Guest,2002-03-18 10:39:00,0,"Canadian Guy,I think you need to take a deep breath... relax."
517798,Guest,2002-03-18 12:00:00,0,"First of all, if you are sitting around watching ""Cops"" and commenting of the sad condition of living in the US, you should really get out more. Life in the US for the average citizen no more resembles ""Cops"" than ""Nanook of the North"" typifies the average Canadian's life. Or maybe you all really do sit in log cabins and travel by dog sled?Seriously, I am curious about the boating and beer laws in Canada. Now try not to get defensive about this because it is an honest question. Are these laws only now being strictly enforced or what is sudden interest in the topic? I've been to Canada numerous times and not one outfitter has even mentioned the fact that drinking in a boat is against the law. It almost seems like they encourage it by offering to stock cabins and selling it (under the counter) to customers. If there is a sudden, more serious enforcement effort underway, people should be concerned and have a right to know the rules.Most of us when travelling to Canada don't intend to purposely violate the laws and won't if we know what they are. We just want to know the rules before playing the game."
517799,Guest,2002-03-18 12:47:00,0,"G) CANADIAN CRIMINAL CODE It is an offence, under the criminal code of Canada to operate any vehicle or vessel when the ability to do so is impaired by alcohol or while the alcohol concentration in the bloodstream is more than 80 milligrams per l00 millilitres of blood. The Criminal Code of Canada also states that a person can be charged for impaired driving even at levels below 80 mg/100ML. Many people fail to realize that ""two"" charges can be levied against them should they be found to be impaired while operating a vessel or vehicle. One for being over 80 mg, and the other for simply being impaired. Ontario Liquor License Act: Sec. 32 (3) No person shall operate or have care or control of a boat that is underway while there is contained in the boat any liquor, except under the authority of a licence or permit. Sec.32 (4) Exception-Subsection (3) does not apply if the liquor in the boat, (a) is in a container that is unopened and the seal unbroken, (b) is stored in a closed compartment. Sec. 32 (5) A police officer who has reasonable grounds to believe that liquor is being unlawfully kept in a vehicle or boat may at any time, without warrant, enter and search the vehicle or boat and search any person found in it. Sec.32 (6) Definition-In this section, ""boat"" includes any ship or boat or any other description of vessel used or designed to be used in the navigation of water. CONSUMING LIQUOR IN A BOAT, ONTARIO LIQUOR LICENCE ACT REGULATION 718 Sec. 3 (7) A boat with permanent sleeping accommodation and permanent cooking and sanitary facilities, other than a boat used to carry passengers for hire is considered to be a private place while the boat is at anchor or is secured to the dock or land. DRINKING AGE: The legal drinking age in Ontario is 19 years old.Check out this web site of the Essex Count OPP......it is very clear and directs you to other sites if you are still unshure of the law. http://www.geocities.com/oppmarine/Alcohol.html"
517800,Guest,2002-03-18 14:37:00,0,NanookThanks for taking the time out from running the traps and feeding the sled dogs to post the info. :) I'll look it over.
517803,Guest,2002-03-18 17:15:00,0,Iowan you sound like a pretty straight guy. The rules are what has been stated but whats done in practise is different from area to area. Talk to your outfitter and see what he thinks on the lake you are going to. However as tracker has stated if the Provincial Police are out on the water as they are from time to time on the more heavilly used lakes they have O tolerance. I know first hand it is not a pleasurable experience.However many lakes are never visited by them. Its been my experience with wardens that as long as they do not see beer or cans or litter they will look the other way. Holiday weekends are a prime time for OPP presence.
517804,Red Ruffandsore,2002-03-18 17:33:00,81,"I would like to apologize for Canadian Guy's behaviour. He no more represents Canadians of Canadian culture than Homer J. Simpson represents the U.S. We all know we have laws in our home states/provinces. We all know the tolerance level of the local enforcement agencies. What we can get away with and what we can't. If you want to take chances in another state/province and ruin a fishing trip, good luck to you. It seems an inordinant amout of time has been given to queries about DWI and fishing in Canada. I do not read into that that all Americans are drunks. I would hope that all are using common sense in the year 2002 and not driving drunk and not littering with empties. The chances of being turned around at the Canadian border because of a DWI are very slim. The chances of getting caught with ""travellers"" is unfortunately also very slim. The chances of killing anyone while you are drunk driving is again very slim. These are things that I would hope that our American friends have learned not to do. If you are into fishing in Canada for the drunken party do yourself a favour and book into a local hotel. You could save yourself a ton of money and never know the difference.Stay off the pipe...and don't forget to wipe.Red"
517805,Guest,2002-03-18 18:31:00,0,">Hopefully i can put this thread to bed. I will give you guys some facts. First off, I am a resort owner on the canadian side of rainy lake. If any laws affects anyone it does us. We are probably one of the most enforced lakes in Northwest ontario.Fact1: No you cannot drink a beer in a boat legally in ontario. BUT. I tell all my guests that it is illegal to have beer in the boat. BUT. Some one said it earlier, if you are courteous and respectful you will not have a problem. Most guest do have a couple of beers in the boat for shore lunch. I have had my resort for 17 years and have yet to have one person charged. If someone came back to the resort hammered, the OPP or CO's would be the least of their problems. They would have to deal with me. But. Every year is different. Every one is told it is illegal, your on your own. When i go fishing, i always bing a beer or two with me, personally i see no problem with that. Neither do most police or co's.( as long as your not drinking it in front of them or had to many.( They have breathalizers with them), beer cans around the bottom of your boat etc. Common Sense. If I get caught with beer I will surely be charged, you probably not because you are tourist. Most OPP and Co's you meet are very courteous and are not out there to ""get you"". Most people in Canada are not like canadian guy, he is probably young and full of vinegar. So just come up and enjoy yourself and if you want more that 2 beers, wait till evening. We do not want the laws to get worse.Fact 2: DWI at the Border: It is a felony charge having a dwi in canada. 1-5 years you will be refused entry into the country if you get check by immigration. Right now you can get a rehabilitation waiver after five years($200.00 processing fee (tax) we know it can't do anything about it). On June 28th 2002 new laws come into effect. 1-5 years no admittance, 5-10 years rehabilitation waiver, 10 years or longer minor criminality ( dwi, minor assaults, etc,) are considered rehabilitated and are again allowed in. We know that this does not help everyone but, it will help quite a few. We are not sure about the after 10 years, before june 28th, Right now they are still rehabilitating. We are trying to change this, but you know what dealing with gov't is like. I know this is long but now you know.My advise, remember when your having that last beer before you drive, remember it also effects in other places."

Some even feel it a priveledge to be able to enjoy your natural resources with as little restriction as we do and do it in relative safety. Anyone who has traveled to many other countries understands this. What bothers me most is that because of a few, you might tend to paint all of us with the same brush.. Let's go fish. cw"

We go to your great country to FISH not drink to get drunk. Yeah we have a beer or two with supper after fishing from sun-up to sun-down. But out in the boat, it's coffee."
517763,Guest,2002-03-15 18:50:00,0,How do you drown in alcohol (half the drownings in Ontario are alcohol related)?
517764,Guest,2002-03-15 19:11:00,0,"Consumption of Alcohol Alcoholic beverages were involved in 40% of all Ontario preventable water-related deaths over the past five years, and in 47% of fatalities where the victim was an adult. During 1997, alcohol was involved in 41% of all deaths and in 48% of adult fatalities, with no significant differences among adult age groups. Alcohol involvement is twice as high among adult men (51%) compared to adult women (24%). Dependence on swimming ability sad but true that there are still those among us who think it is a joke."
517772,Guest,2002-03-16 16:18:00,0,"Good to see both sides of the border seem to have the attitude that us ""fish cops"" are not the devil incarnate, or ""big brother"" as I have seen used in this forum. I myself know many Minnesota and other state agency game wardens, and don't understand the comments about Canadian laws-fish and wildlife agencies in the states have as many laws, if not more.As for beer in the boat/shore lunch, all I can say is that persons who overindulge on the water take more chances than I care to state. I have helped RCMP remove individuals who thought that beer and boats mixed, not a pretty sight. Fish hard,m and party hard at the end of the day at camp is what I tell individuals who I encounter on the water who have their priorities mixed."
517765,Guest,2002-03-17 21:23:00,0,"I didn't say its a joke. In fact, I don't understand why some of these guys travel over 500 miles to drink. I can drink at home, not in Canada. It takes away from response time when setting hooks, makes me feel like crap the next day, and basically robs me of fishing time. I just like pointing out the real lapse of syntax that most people exhibit when using the English language. People get mad when you take them literally, and they get mad when you don't!"
517794,tracker,2002-03-18 07:10:00,91,"The question that started this thread was a good one but it was answered in the second post. I don't know why there is a need to argue or debate a law that certaintly does more good than harm. The OPP will charge you, no ands , ifs or buts. I was reading the ""What brings Americans to Canada"" post and it seems there is a great number of them more than happy with the laws and regulations that will be enforced either on the lake or at the border. One of the worst thing that comes from having a beer or two during shore lunch is usually the empty ""Canadian and American"" beer cans and bottles that litter the shores. I can just hear what the next arguement will be, "" I just drove 12 hours to get to your beautiful country to fish so I don't see the big deal if I suck back a few beer while I'm cruising down the highway. The throat gets pretty dry you know and by the way, back in my home town of backwoods Iowa the county sheriff lets us have a few while we cruise around looking for deer"". A common question that keeps coming up in a lot of message boards is "" can I get into Canada if I have a DWI"" so it's not only Ontario that has serious driving under the influence problems."
517795,Guest,2002-03-18 09:25:00,0,"Once again, I think we've been misjudged. Here in the backwoods we don't go for beer as much as whiskey when we're hunting from the pickup truck. After all, we only have two hands, one for the spotlight and one for the assualt rifle. I don't think that the average American hunter/fisherman will ever understand the Canadian willingness to so freely accept more laws and restrictions controlling their lives under the umbrella of ""for the common good"". I think that we are a little more skeptical concerning the government and their agenda on various issues than our northern friends.Here we have 50 states and 50 sets of laws, many radically different from state to state. You'd think that would make it easier to understand/accept rules that are considerably more restrictive than those to which we are accustomed, but it doesn't. In some states, it is perfectly legal to drink a beer while driving as long as you are not legally drunk. But in these same states, certain cities have ordinances against open containers. Once while on route to go deer hunting I nearly got thrown in jail because I didn't have a shotgun in the back seat in a case. Not required in my state but considered a serious crime in the next state over, I found out to the tune of a large fine. The fact that we sometimes discuss issues to minute details doesn't mean we're looking for ways around the laws, sometimes we only want to know exactly what to expect."
517779,Guest,2002-03-05 06:55:00,0,"YAt a posh club in Manila, a very arrogant and nasty American is playing a round with a client. He is very abusive to his caddybut all smiles with his client. You know the type.

The golfer rudely grabs the six iron and hits the ball. the ball lands in the middle of the pond and the golfer erupts "" hey stupid,you gave me a six iron and it was obviously not enough-I went right into the water!!""The caddy replies "" that's what Mr.Raymond Floyd did too."""
517781,bigfish1965,2002-03-05 10:17:00,3210,"I just did a check and cannot find a single state where it is legal to have open alcohol in a boat. While, according to the state trooper I spoke to yesterday, it is usually not enforced, just like in Ontario, it is still illegal. So which is more Draconian, not being able to drink in a boat, or not letting your 20 yr old soldiers have a beer when they are done fighting? ( Ontario drinking age is 19)"
517782,Guest,2002-03-05 11:21:00,0,I think the original question was whether beer could be carried in a cooler and consumed at a shore lunch. Not If we could come to your contry get drunk and drive around the lake with open cans of alcohol. Do people do the latter? of course they do and if they are caught they should pay the penalty. But don't kid yourself The laws on the books in Canada were written because of alcohol abuses by Canadiens not American fishing tourist.
517783,Guest,2002-03-05 11:49:00,0,"you must not have checked the laws in Michigan very carefully because it is indeed legal to have open alcohol in a boat. drive said boat while intoxicated of course not! consume a beer or two while NOT EVEN IN THE BOAT BUT ON SHORE, well i guess thats another search. to illustrate the absuridty of the Canadian boating law simply insert ""trunk of car"" for cooler and ""picnic"" for ""shore lunch""."

517773,Guest,2002-03-04 17:10:00,0,Good post River Eye. Ontario Cos will look the other way many times. The OPP (Provincial Police)are a different story. They are usually on the larger well travelled lakes and generally have zero tollerance.
517769,Guest,2002-03-04 19:55:00,0,"Good question Mike S.. Non-alcoholic beer usually has a little alcohol (very little) in it, less than .05% by volume. It is not, however, 3.2% beer, which as you can see has a much higher alcohol content. The question still remains, however, even with the very small amount of alcohol in NA beer is this legal in the boat? Not to answer my own question, but no alcohol, I guess, means no alcohol, even though a good man on a poor day would have to consume about 100 of these so called beers to get a buzz on. Is this the exception to the rule? Any answers out there?Jig'N'John"
517774,bigfish1965,2002-03-04 20:07:00,3210,"The condescending response was simply a reaction of frustration on that guys part. It is somewhat disheartening to find, time and time again, an American who thinks that anything other than the way it is done at home to be simply rediculous and unacceptable. From the massive outpour of outrage against our border and conservation officers, I can see you guys like things different than we Canadians do. And that is your right. Just as it is our right to have laws that may seem Orwellian to outsiders. Too many people were becoming hurt or killed by alcohol related boating accidents. It was obvious that too many people were unable to properly limit their intake. The only solution was to ban it outright. Canada takes alcohol related tragedy VERY seriously. Drink at the campsite and leave the booze on shore. It is the law. You have the option of disobeying the law and hoping you only recieve a ticket for it. If you are found over the legal limit while in operation of a boat, it is the same as being DUI in a car. You will do jail time and may never be allowed back into the country. All that the frustrated Canadian guy asks is that you remember one thing, it is a DIFFERENT country, respect our laws as you would have us do in your country. ( Remember the guy in Michigan who, a few years ago, did time for swearing in public?) P.S. The near beer ( 0.5 %) is not considered an alcoholic beverage by Ontario law. It has less alcohol than most cough syrups."
517775,Piscatorian,2002-03-04 20:43:00,12,"There's also a saying that the customer is always right. No matter how ridiculous it may sound, it's ultimately true. First of all, I never get drunk out in the boat. i'm a serious fisherman and that dulls the reflexes, and I don't need to be drunk to have a good time fishing. I might have two beers at shore lunch, and maybe one later in the afternoon. Interestingly, these beers are normally sold to me and packed in the cooler by the lodge. If such simple pleasures are ever denied, why would I pay my hard-earned thousands of dollars to go to Canada? The high prices, customs hassles, air-travel problems, guide horrors, and unscrupulous lodge owners have been enough to bear, but that would be the last straw. Yes, Canada can pass whatever Draconian laws Canada wishes, but Americans can stay at home or go elsewhere."

517777,Wawajake,2002-03-05 06:16:00,413,"Looks like we need some humour here!!!so here it goes : Two Americans boarded a flight out of Salt Lake after THE hockey game. One sat in the window seat and the other sat in the middle seat. Just before take-off, a Canadian got on and took the aisle seat. After take-off, the Canadian kicked his shoes off, wiggled his toes and was settling in when the American in the window seat said, ""I think I'll get up and get a beer."" ""No problem,"" said the Canadian, ""I'll get it for you."" While he was gone, one of the Americans picked up the Canadian's shoe and spat in it. When he returned with the beer, the other American said, ""That looks good, I think I'll have one too."" Again, the Canadian obligingly went to fetch it and while he was gone, the other American picked up the other shoe and spat in it. When the Canadian returned to his seat, they all sat back and enjoyed the flight. As the plane was landing, the Canadian slipped his feet into his shoes and knew immediately what had happened. ""Why does it have to be this way?"" he asked. ""How long must this go on? This fighting between our nations? This hatred? This animosity? This spitting in shoes, and pissing in beers?"" :)just a smile to calm the waters!jakejake"
517778,Guest,2002-03-05 06:45:00,0,"An American soldier serving in World War II was returning from several weeks of intense action at the German front, and was on a train bound for London. The train was very crowded, so the soldier walked the length of the train looking for an empty seat. He found only one, which was directly adjacent to a well-dressed middle-aged lady. However, the seat was being used by her little dog. The war-weary soldier asked, ""Please, ma'am, may I sit in that seat?"" The English woman looked down her nose at the soldier, sniffed and said, ""You Americans! You are such a rude class of people. Can't you see my little Fifi is using that seat?"" The soldier walked away, determined to find a place to rest, but after another trip down to the end of the train, he again found himself facing the woman with the dog. Again he asked, ""Please, lady. May I sit there? I'm very tired."" The English woman wrinkled her nose and snorted, ""You Americans! Not only are you rude, you are also arrogant. Imagine!"" The soldier didn't say anything else. He leaned over, picked up the little dog, tossed it out the window of the train and sat down in the empty seat. The woman shrieked and railed, and demanded that someone defend her. An English gentleman sitting across the aisle spoke up. ""You know, sir, you Americans do seem to have a penchant for doing the wrong thing. You eat holding the fork in the wrong hand, and you drive your autos on the wrong side of the road. And now, sir, you've thrown the wrong ##### out the window."""

The fine is around $150 Canadian. It is a common charge here in NW Ontario. If you have a tent set or something along that line and are camping there, it is defined as ""your residence"". You can drink there."

LMAO"
517759,Guest,2002-03-04 10:52:00,0,I am in complete agreement with our governments approach to drinking and driving and boating. Over half of the drownings in Ontario are alcohol related. There is also a concerted lobby going now to lower the legal limit to .05 from .08. I like the laws the way they are. To have a beer or two with lunch I see absolutely no problem. It has been ruined by the individuals who came before us and acted irresponsibly. The government acted to protect the bulk of us who are responsible. The DUI thing in Canada is serious business. Many people are repeat offenders. In some provinces the vehicle is forfeited if you are caught with a DUI and a suspended licence. You are alse guaranteed jail time.
517760,Guest,2002-03-04 11:07:00,0,"THUMPER,of the literally hundreds of posts on the topic of alcohol and Canada i have seen on this board...i have yet to see anyone advocate that Canada make it legal to get drunked up and drive a bicycle much less a car or boat. it is your country, your rules and our choice wether or not we want to play by them or not. i just am amused at the big brother mentality that i have become aware of since visiting this board."

They will however usually throw out the fine and let you keep the bike if you are respectfull and apologise for being bad and also promise to never come back."

Open alcohol constitutes open drinks as well as loose drinks out of their original packaging ie. cans must be in the rings/box and bottles must be in the box.This law gives the CO's the ability to fine you should you break this law, I'm not sure the exact amount, around $100 I think.Now, this doesn't mean that they will fine you for sure. Usually if the alcohol is out of sight, there are no problems. You should be able to bring a few drinks for shorelunch, but don't think this is your right. It is simply a reasonable request, and it's mostly accepted by the resource officers, unless you show them otherwise by having beer caps scattered around the boat or an open one in the cup holder, or by being rude. To put it simple, be courteous to them and they will be courteous to you most of the time, depending on the officer.These laws aren't just to piss the americans off, they also help to prevent alcohol related drownings, of which there are a lot."

And in my experience, you're accurate in stating that courtesy and good judgement will keep you fine-free and safe. A beer or two at shore lunch? Are you kidding? I don't think I've ever been to a shore lunch (lodge sponsored or personal) that DIDN'T have two per person...one for when lunch is being prepared, one with lunch. But that's enough. Getting loaded out on the boat is completely unacceptable, whether you're Canadian or American. I've seen plenty of idiots, both American and Canadian, that load the boat with beer, 1/2 gallons of booze in the morning and return around 2:00 PM dry. It's not about whether we Americans think the Canadian officers are ""big brother"" or not, and you know it. In over 25 years of coming to Canada I've only been checked out on the lake once, so that hardly qualifies as ""big brother"". Anyway, who cares if they're watching...it's only keeping me safe, and that's alright by me."

My dad who can't drink regular beer enjoys his NA beer. Which brings me to another question. Is near Beer acceptable. I think another name for it is three two beer."
