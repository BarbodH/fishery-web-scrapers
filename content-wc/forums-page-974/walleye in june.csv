Get a new job or better yet quit the one you have, once you go north it's hard to come back! Seriously try 5-15' weed edges,rock points ect. anywhere you notice lots of young baitfish- they will come.Try current areas i.e creek/ river areas feeding in. Jig & leach, troll rappelas from sundown til after dark! Slip bobbers and leaches will work great. You should be able to skip the minnows. Good luck!"

Also if there are major humps in the lake, I would try trolling over those as well. If possible, use an electric trolling motor so that you don't scare away the fish. I recommend a GPS so that when you locate a good fishing area you can remember how to get back there. That's just my 2 cents.Good Luck"
