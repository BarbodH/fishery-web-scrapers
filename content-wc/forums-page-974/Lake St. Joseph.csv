518287,Guest,2002-03-18 09:25:00,0,Heard a lot of good things and are considering a trip there. Any advice would be helpful. Should you hire a guide since the lake is so large?
518288,Fred_G,2002-03-18 10:47:00,908,"I would highly recommend hiring a guide if this is your first time on the lake. It's not so much that the lake is large, it's just that there are so many rocks lurking just below the surface. It's very easy to take out a lower unit.When are you going and where are you staying?Fred"
518289,Guest,2002-03-18 11:18:00,0,Just in the process of a search for a new lake. Would like to book a trip for this fall or we may wait till next year. I know there is a place call Old Post but are there any others?
