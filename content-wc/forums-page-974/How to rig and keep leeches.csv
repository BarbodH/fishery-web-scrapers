Any suggestions on rigging leeches,hook size and type,leader length ect. and what you use to contain the critters would be appreciated."

Keep them in a cooler with water and every day throw a frozen bottle of water in. Keep them inside at night (critters). As long as you keep them cool with frozen bottles they will last all week and than some."

We change the water daily (lake water) and keep the water cold by keeping the sterefoam containers in coolers with ice. Each boat takes a container fishing and keeps it in a cooler.As for technique, we tend to use leeches while drifting. We use small light wire hooks (for example VMC V7105) to ensure the leech can swim freely. We have had great success with the colour red but fluorescent orange, yellow and green will probably work too. We normally attach the hooks at the end of fluorcarbon leaders with small split shot to get the leech to the bottom (number of split shot varies with speed of drift (wind)). The bite can be very light!"
518307,Piscatorian,2002-03-18 21:19:00,12,"I fish leeches a ton in the U.S. for both walleye and bass. The other guys are right, just keep them cold. They are also deadly on a 1/16 oz. jig, a slip bobber, or a split-shot rig (#6 hook usually). There are times when fishing is slow that nothing else works better than a leech on 6lb line."
518308,Seanik,2002-03-18 22:30:00,218,"Thanks to all for your good advice!One reason for my question, I was in Gander Mt. the other day and they are selling a leech habitat complete with what seems like a muck leech beding made in Canada. Also was at the Canadian/American sports show in Cleveland visited Pro-Cure booth bought a bottle of their new leech bait sauce made from ground up leeches. While smelling the sauce I was distracted by the Bud Girls needless to say a drop got up my nose, It proves we fisherman will suffer anything in the pursuit of our passion."
