Two of us went to this lake last year. Huge Northerns, lots of walleye and great facilities. This is an outpost camp with manager, cook and hot water. If you're available and interested contact [email protected]."

518234,Guest,2002-03-18 07:55:00,0,The dates are 6/22-6/29-02. Going to Chippewyan Lake out of Big Sand Lake outfitters. The cost is $1995.00 from Winnipeg beer and soda extra. Four new guys cancelled and we're trying to fill the trip. Went last year and caught 8 master angler pike and all the walleye we wanted.
