518162,PWaldow123,2002-03-14 20:34:00,198,I'm looking for info on Eltrut lake. It's located just Northeast of Fort Francis. Anybody know where I could get a lake map or find some info
518163,tracker,2002-03-16 11:51:00,91,"Heading up to Atikokan next weekend, I'll see if they have any info on the lake. Been there, fished it, had a great time. We used to take a few trips in the winter and stay on Manion at Hyatts or Blue Lantern. Fished Silvertip and Kennering which is across the road from Eltrut"
