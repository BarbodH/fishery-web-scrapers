5894858,h8go4s,2017-12-13 05:55:00,1673,At $850 for 7 days? Not likely.
5894882,Baseline,2017-12-13 06:10:00,3207,You are right about that.
5894922,BornToFish,2017-12-13 06:35:00,1224,"Greetings,My wife and I wanted to take our first ""fishing"" vacation in Ontario during 2001. I was absolutely convinced that I needed to pick the ""right"" lodge/lake the first time. I wouldn't get a second chance if I picked the ""wrong"" lodge/lake on the first try at it. I knew that she wouldn't go back if she had a bad experience on her first trip.Fortunately, my wife and I had a wonderful time together on our first trip. Now, we look forward to each and every trip together. I understand that some guys are reading this and thinking: pick a ""bad"" lodge and she won't want to go back. Well, the saying ""happy wife = happy life"" comes to mind.The original poster hopefully knows what his girl friend will like and not like. Thus, he might have a good idea if a $850 lodge will satisfy his/her requirements.Every now and again I tell my wife that I am thinking about purchasing a new fishing rod, reel or some other piece of equipment. It's nice to hear her respond with ""you might just as well buy two"".Good fishing and tight lines!!"

5895434,camp chef,2017-12-13 15:31:00,915,Try the Frontier Lodge on the Ash river trail...Nice people...access to Canadian water with the RABC border crossing pass.$30 per person....You can fish Minnesota or Canada.

5891298,walley3,2017-12-10 15:00:00,7,I'm looking at taking my girlfriend walleye and northern fishing in either northern Minnesota or ontario next summer. I would like to fish water that's skinny or has lots of islands since I only got a 14.5 ft lund rebel and I'm concerned about the wind. I would like to keep the cost of renting below $850 for the both of us for a 7 day stay. If anyone has a house they rent out or knows of one or has a resort recommendation i would appreciate it. Thanks
5891458,whitedogone,2017-12-10 15:55:00,195,"How about lake vermilion in mn? Large lake, but a lot of protected areas. And beautiful lake."
5891626,Baseline,2017-12-10 18:02:00,3207,"Your 14.5 Rebel will be just fine on most of the lakes around unless there is a big weather system that moves in. You probably wouldn't want to fish in that kind of weather anyway. Can you supply some more information like what species you would like to fish for, what part of the summer you would like to take your trip and what your requirements of a resort are. You don't have your location listed, but if you live near a city that has a nice sized sports and boat show you can visit there and check out resorts and ask all the questions you have."
5891682,That Minnesota guy,2017-12-10 18:25:00,8293,Sunset Resort on the Ash River Trail (Kabatogama) has a cabin. Ash Ka Nam Resort has motel rooms and maybe a cabin you would need to call them to find out. Find both on the web or directory assistance for Orr Minnesota.
5891746,whitedogone,2017-12-10 18:58:00,195,I read somewhere that KAB was all but dead.
5891754,That Minnesota guy,2017-12-10 19:01:00,8293,"LOL, you are correct. All the fish took a vacation to Canada 2 years ago and have yet to return. We expect them back sometime in the next decade."

5893074,andersaki,2017-12-11 14:53:00,1426,Some resort owners in Northern MN have a tough time filling their cabins in July and August. Call a few and ask them if they would give you a discount during this period. It never hurts to ask. andersaki
