5907018,Baseline,2017-12-21 06:44:00,3207,I have a wife who has the same problem your dad has. We have a standing joke that if I should take a sudden departure her phone and iPad would soon become cup coasters sitting on the table. We are also considering brining an emergency beacon. Any experience with these devices pros or cons?
5915354,nitroman,2017-12-27 19:53:00,368,Cedar Point does not have WIFI. They do have internet in the owners cabin but not really for the public.
5878810,skindzier,2017-11-30 13:05:00,137,"I'm an IT guy for a small business, so unfortunately I have no choice - I have to keep tabs on home base. However, even if I didn't have to check work & had no interest in staying plugged in with everything else, I'd still want it for detailed weather. The forecast for the next couple days helps plan those days & radar gives you a good idea of when you need to head in if there's storms heading in (Even if you don't have it on the lake, you can get a pretty good idea before leaving). Even if your camp posts forecasts, it is nice to be able to get them from multiple sites. Sometimes they vary a bunch up there. I really depend on it..."

5898258,downrigger222,2017-12-15 16:26:00,15,"You can buy a ""Jetpak"" which will give you a clear satellite wifi reception to use with either your smart phone or laptop/tablet. The one time purchase cost is around $200. There are various data usage plans, $ per month, which can be canceled when you will not want to use it. Service is good anywhere in the US and Canada."
5902930,Baseline,2017-12-19 05:40:00,3207,Is Jet Pack reliable? I've read where these services are frequently down because of technical problems with the satellite or atmospheric interference.
5902954,pjshorthorn,2017-12-19 05:56:00,5654,"I've used a Verizion jet pack for years on business trips and vacations where wifi wasn't available. Never had one issue with the performance of the jet pack over 1000s of hours of use. You can have secure wifi with the jet pack by setting up a security key just like at home; which was really important when conducting business communications that contained sensitive information. I don't recall if there was a limit on the number of devices that could be used simultaneously, but if I was conducting business both my kids would be on their computers or phones at the same time with no connectivity issues.

5903130,Baseline,2017-12-19 07:13:00,3207,"I'm planning a canoe trip up to the God's River system for August, 18. I thought this might be something to bring along being that 3 of the 6 crew members are in our mid 60's."
5903154,downrigger222,2017-12-19 07:21:00,15,"Like pjshorthorn, I used mine this past summer while in Northern Mn, and never had difficulty with service regardless of weather. Since it has a built in battery wife even used it while traveling in the car. We were told the Jetpak would accommodate up to 15 users at the same time. Each user just has to type in the security key."
5903322,Pooch,2017-12-19 08:22:00,4618,One day there will be some sort of satellite link available in remote areas w/o cell service. Iâ€™m pretty sure there are devices out there for texting now. Have seen them talked about here on WC. Having a non cell dependent WiFi hotspot available will one day be as common as a cell phone is now.Tech changes so fast that it is all but impossible to keep up for the average schmuck like me.Pooch
5903426,bthomas3333,2017-12-19 08:47:00,465,Hey - They are already out there. These work purely off a satellite connection. Data speeds continue to improve but the price point is pretty high. I just cant quite justify a satellite device costing as much as one of my trips. That being said I tend to pay a little more for some trips bc they have internet. Maybe owning something like this would allow me to spend less on certain trips.https://www.bluecosmo.com/devices/sa...ne-access.htmlBrett
5904810,pjshorthorn,2017-12-20 06:53:00,5654,"There is an age limit on using remote electronic devices. No one over 65 should use them because only bad things can happen....just teasing. Now for my Dad, that is a real thing. He takes a lot of pictures on his phone,but I asked him one day if he knew how to send them to anyone so he could share them? Nope!!!!! I just laughed and didn't even try to explain it because he just doesn't care..... Not a bad idea to have connectivity of some kind to get a message out in case of an emergency especially if you wouldn't have access to a Sat Phone. The Jet Pack charges from a standard 110 outlet and is smaller than a cell phone. PjShorthorn"
5870666,bearfvr13,2017-11-25 09:34:00,174,"Does anybody know if Cedar Point Resort or Keystone Lodge on Cedar Lake has WIFI at the camp? (that can be used from your cabin) I've read through their websites and I do not see where it says that they do have it,...but I'm still askin because maybe they haven't updated their page? I could go without,...but for some odd reason,...my 17 year old needs to keep in contact with all his friends back home!!! (sending them pictures of fish that they are missing out on catching!!!) Thanks in advance!!chuckbearfvr13"
5870962,Obabikon,2017-11-25 13:38:00,2370,"I intentionally try not to mention WIFI because many people want to inform work that they are ""unavailable"". It seems silly, but it has become very hard for people to unplug from their lives over the past 10 years. Just call the resorts and ask. That's the best way to get your answer."
5871010,wallydave,2017-11-25 14:52:00,2151,"Chuck, CPR does have wifi in the lodge, Nice camp, we had a good trip! Good luck on your search."
5871210,Remi,2017-11-25 19:44:00,41,"Cedar Point Lodge has Wi-Fi. My typical Canada experience it may work better on some days than others. We used to quick email home and check the weather. They also have Satellite TV, got weather and basic cable channels. Last year was our first trip to this camp."
5871314,Pooch,2017-11-25 21:39:00,4618,"wifi in camp or not is not a deal breaker, but there have been numerous trips when there was a lot going on back home and if there were no wifi I would have had to cancel my trip and that would have screwed up the other guys trip, too.Wifi is nice addition if it works and people not crashing it with videos.Sorry for hijacking this thread, but the OP question has been answered.Pooch"
5871498,Baseline,2017-11-26 07:56:00,3207,If the resort has cell service you can always elect to activate your phone's network. Last year I was at LOW and the only place WIFI worked was on the porch of the resort's office. Whenever I walked by there was always a few people sitting on the porch and big crowd in the evenings. I'm surprised the resort had the bandwidth to handle all the traffic. WIFI and LTE is now just a fact of life and part of the outdoor scene.
5872522,MrSimon,2017-11-27 07:07:00,922,"I agree, call the resort directly. I've been to places that advertise wifi, but you have to be sitting at the front desk to get it. Anyway, I used to be a ""wifi on a fishing trip is sacrilege"" type guy. Still sort of am. But I realize it's necessary to draw a younger crowd. And I think it's important to entice younger people and families with kids to camps in the North."
5873377,Golden Eagle,2017-11-27 15:03:00,2642,"Not the answer to OP question, but availability of WiFi had allowed me to make 2 and 3 week trips, instead of a seven day stay. When fuel prices were at their highest I usually stayed at least 2 weeks. I don't want to make or receive any phone calls while in camp, but handling business decisions online, at the time I chose, worked great for me."
5873689,bthomas3333,2017-11-27 17:53:00,465,"I have traveled with guys who really hated the thought of Wifi in camp. I never got the desire to be totally cut off but to each his or her own. Having Wifi allows some of us to go for a longer stay, potentially go more often, and maybe even help pay for the trip. Last time I let myself go totally off the grid my wife wasted hundreds of dollars on a pool service call when all that needed to be changed was one valve setting. If I had email she would've just emailed me and I could've saved that $.If you dont want to be in touch just stay off the wifi. Don't hate on it for the rest of us.B-"
5878145,gordy28,2017-11-30 07:19:00,437,"Personally I like not having the option of wifi less I be tempted to check in on emails and such from work but I see the benefits for sure - longer trips, emergencies, travelling with kids and so on I also realize that its easy to control it - re if I don't want to see emails I can turn wifi off lol Certainly I think for more and more places it will be a requirement - I can't see my daughter and her generation (8 years old) ever being comfortable with no wifi whatsoever - that's not a world she has ever lived in Cheers Gordy"
