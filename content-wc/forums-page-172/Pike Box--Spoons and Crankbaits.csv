5246738,Mike Borger,2016-12-31 08:56:00,1554,"I should have included that one in my list, thanks for the reminder. I always have a bunch of oversized Williams Whitefish in my arsenal of non weedless spoons. They all work, but lately the hammered silver/fluorescent orange has been lethal."
5246818,BornToFish,2016-12-31 09:26:00,1224,"Greetings,I noticed in this thread and others on Walleye Central that folks like spoons from Williams. I am not familiar with these spoons. I believe there is a line by Williams called Wabblers and another line called Whitefish. What are the attributes of these lines of spoons from Williams? It might be that they are one in the same for all I know.I received a gift card from Cabela's for Christmas. It might be time to make a road trip.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5246898,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2016-12-31 10:24:00,240,"Cabela's does carry several of the Williams spoons. They are manufactured in Canada, but Cabela's does carry many styles of this spoon. I am definitely going to put some of these in my pike box."
5246978,Duflebag,2016-12-31 11:06:00,218,"For those that love to use BullDawgs for pike but hate losing an expensive lure to rubber being torn I highly recommend a Drifter Tackle Triple D lure instead. i use the 9 inch in metallic carp scale color. For the past three years i have decisively out produced bulldawgs fished out of my boat with the triple D. After seeing what can be produced by this bait the lodge i go to now recommends this bait over bulldawgs for fishing pike deep and in rocky areas.Very simple to use. Crank it down to depth fast after casting, once at depth erratic retrieve with medium cranking speed and pulls in random pattern. One, three, one, two pulls erratically. Very effective, if there is a pike in the area they will hit.Mine look like i threw them into a running lawnmower from being hit. Anyone that throws bulldawgs know what they look like after being hit a few times, torn up. Triple D last and last."
5247074,bthomas3333,2016-12-31 12:16:00,465,Hey Guys - This thread has been right on for me as I am taking a Pike trip to Northern MB this year so this is perfect! I am wondering how you all stay under the weight limit with all this BIG stuff and how the heck do you store all of this without taking like 10 370 boxes.How do you guys travel with all of this when you have weight limits to consider? What size boxes to you typically use? Are they different boxes for 9in Bulldogs I am struggling with the REALLY big stuff.Thanks!B-

The plastics especially weigh a ton! My pike box assuming I'm looking to cover every eventuality usually weighs a minimum of 25 pounds. Mind you that covers whoever is in the boat with me as well.The ONLY trip I've ever done where packing was easy and my arsenal was small was Lac Evans in northern Quebec last August. That's because it's so shallow and weed choked weedless spoons were the only thing that we could use effectively. It's the only place I've been where even in late August we were casting into 2-4' of water with vegetation and catching tons of big fish!Kind of nice to pack for a trip with only one plano box of weedless spoons."
5903290,MrSimon,2017-12-19 08:19:00,922,"That's great! I'm sure you'll have a good time!!! Big baits do catch big fish, so you are all set. But smaller baits can to, and they also will catch numbers. You might want to throw in some medium sized spinners (#4 or #5 Mepps are great) and a few small to medium spoons. My favorite lure of all time is a 1/3 oz. orange/silver Little Cleo. It has caught everything from 3"" perch, to monster pike. If it swims, that little spoon has caught it."

5906898,Mike Borger,2017-12-21 03:53:00,1554,"I almost never troll for large pike, except in the fall, then I troll 90% of the time. And yes, when I'm trolling in the fall I tend to run much larger baits than you might imagine.It's more or less exactly like fall musky fishing. Put lots of time on the water, rods in the holders, often long stretches with no action...but the payoff is usually big."
5907426,orchard frank,2017-12-21 10:11:00,1900,"In Florida now, but spent many, many weeks on Lac Seul. Stained water typical of shield lakes. One of my most consistent producers of large pike, and the occasional musky, was a large willow leaf spinnerbait, black bucktail, orange blade. The black bucktail often had a few strands of yellow as well, not always. Can be run subsurface leaving a wake, or deep dropped. I liked to stay off of a deep drop into 30-40' of water near structure, and work it down the edge. Not fast action usually, but it seemed that larger fish lurk on these deep edges. Agree with many of the other choices, Silver Minnow, spoons, etc. Also like trolling (or casting) a large hot-n-tot, gold and pink was usually good. Caught about everything in the lake on those. Good Luck"

It's a few years old, but so helpful to people like me who pick through the replies and the virtual tackle boxes of very good fisherman to help build our own in preparation for adventures-to-be (in my case as a 2nd timer to Canada and a first timer to Abamasagi mid-July next year). I now have some Williams Whitefish and some Gold and Orange Doctors. Yep, a few large Rat-L-Traps, some big Johnson minnows. 1 or 2 Larger spinner baits. I happened to already have an 8"" jointed Drifter Believer. I don't have much in the way of crank baits. Maybe I'm fine.

5902962,Baseline,2017-12-19 05:59:00,3207,"Pike will hit just about anything you throw at them and have caught plenty of them on cranks and spoons, but I think they respond the best to flash. I like to use weighted spin baits with double willow leaf blades. Baits with red, orange and chartreuse skirts seem to work the best. Spin baits are basically weedless unless you load them with a treble hook. I sometimes add a single stinger hook if I start getting short strikes. Nice thing about spin baits is they are light and you can throw them with a light gear. I use my bass bait casting gear loaded with 20 lb power pro or floro and a 6 inch composite leader."
5903082,Bill Krejca,2017-12-19 06:52:00,6107,"One thing I had noticed, many moons ago was that many spoons attract pike. Nothing new here. It also has been my experience, however, that red and white spoons, while good for pike, are not very attractive for walleye (at least in waters in which I fish). My experience has been that black and white spoons are more attractive to walleye, with no degradation (as I can determine) in catching pike. For that reason, I recommend some black and white spoons, as I feel that finish widens the possibility of catching both pike and walleye. And maybe muskie. Bill"

We hit some 48 - 52 degree water the first week of June on one lake, and found Pike in 2' water flats with grass. They didn't want to chase anything, even slow We had a blast using .008 high E guitar string leaders with a floating jig head in orange, twitching minnow on the surface and Walleye rods with 10# line. They were being smashed on the surface about every minute and since the water was so shallow they just went turbo mode to the sides. Most fish were between 20 - 30"", nothing huge, but what a blast!"

Being allowed only 100 lbs./person is definitely problematic. We usually solve these problems by having our outfitter fly in our beer and pop ahead of time. Yes, it is expensive--$52/case of beer, $27/pop, but the peace of mind is priceless.I know it's been mentioned before, but Mattice Lake Outfitters flies in everything you could possibly bring without charging extra. Another reason to strongly consider them when choosing an outfitter. Not to mention the outstanding fishing at all of their outposts. This is one top-notch operation."
5250802,bigdaddyguns,2017-01-03 08:58:00,608,"A note on Bull Dawg usage, I have found this approach to be effective summertime pattern with northern pike on bodies of water that contain a cisco and/or whitefish forage base. Given the forage base especially the whitefish are near the thermocline, it is imperative to get to the presentation deep with substantial lure action. Bull Dawgs are good tools since the are heavy and provide long casting distances, depth control by rapidly sinking to strike zone depths and the heavier weight also enables faster and active retrieves while maintaining contact with target depth zone. The combination of these factors seems to really trigger northern pike bites. I have yet to transfer the Bull Dawgs success rate on lakes without cisco and/or whitefish forage base. Maybe its me but the other presentations spoons, spinner baits, larger crank baits produce better on those lakes."

Just FYI in case someone is unaware of these charges made by most credit card companies."
5247218,adempsey2.0,2016-12-31 14:03:00,612,"For a starter kit, I don't think I'd bother with those friggin' huge musky lures. Too expensive and you need a decent heavy duty rod/reel to fish them comfortably. Ever cast out a Bulldawg? They weigh a ton.For me, that basics would be most of what Mike B mentioned. Pick any 1oz 3.5""/4.5"" spoons of your preference. They'll all work. Can't go wrong with Len Thompson's, Doctor Spoon's, Mepps Cyclops or Dardevle's. I like the Lucky Strike Bait Works tackle as well. They make a lot of knock-offs that are cheaper and work great. For pike, I have a bunch of the Red Flash spoons which are knock-offs of a Daredevle line.Spoons like the Williams Whitefish and Wabler are awesome too. I have a ton of them. They are thinner, so don't weigh as much for their size, and as such they won't cast as far as the standard 1oz.+ spoons, but still cast far enough. Especially if you get the C80/C90 size, which are 5.25""/6"" long. Great for trolling too. Also great for Lakers. Edit: I got my sizes mixed up. The C80 Whitefish is 5 1/4"" long and 1oz. in weight. I thought they weighed less than that. The C90 is 6"" and weights 1.5oz It's the Wabler W60 thats 3 1/4"" long and weighs 3/4oz; and the W70 is 4"" long and weighs 1oz. I use C70's/W60's primarily which weigh 3/4oz., but also have several C80's and W70's.Johnson's Silver Minnow with a 5"" white trailer grub. A go to bait for most people. I like the Kalin's 5"" lunker grub, but use whatever you like. The long Mister Twisters are alright too. The other Kalin's Mike B mentioned are different and huge. The Fin-tech Title Shot spoon is another alternative. Yellowbird also makes a Doctor spoon version.Next would certainly be hairpin spinnerbaits. Nothing beats the Northland Reed Runner Magnum line, which Mike B mentioned.. There might be some others targeting Musky anglers, but I like the Northland series. Sure, you can use the smaller ones designed for bass, but really, the Magnum series are what you want. Definitely get some in white.Minnow Stick Baits. Could always use a few of these. Great for casting and trolling. Pick whatever you like, there are a ton and they'll all work. A lot like the Rapala Husky Jerks and X-Raps. The Live Target series are good. I also like Bomber, Storm and Smithwick. Like I said, there are a ton of them and they'll all work. Definitely look at the saltwater versions for slightly larger models.Don't overlook fishing flies either. So much fun! I am no fly fisher, so I use a spin bubble and my spinning gear. A few Bunny Leeches, Dahlberg Divers and Lefty's Deceivers and you're set.If you want a couple of larger baits, the Rapala Super Shad Rap, Rapala Gliding Rap, the 7""/9"" Suick Original Thriller and 6"" Believer are great choices. Don't weigh too much and have great reputations. Ultimately, how you target the fish will dictate what you buy. If you don't plan on trolling you won't need the bigger musky baits. Time of year matters too, since you go earlier you may need to use slower methods. This article by Gord Pyzer worth a quick read.So, for me with $150, this is what I'd buy:1) Flourocarbon leaders - 80-125lb test, 1 10-12"" and 1 18"" - $15 to $20 for both; if you're not trolling, just stick with 10-12"". Have some backup nylon coated steel leaders [or better] if you somehow lose them.2) Jaw spreader - you need these $73) Long nose pliers - 10-12"" - you also need these $104) Spoons - At least 3 various casting spoons $205) Johnson Silver Minnows - 2 Silver 1 1/8 oz $126) Spinner Bait - 1 1oz. white $10 [alternatively, get some plastics like the reaper tail for slower presentation for Spring/Fall]7) Grubs - White 5/6"" 10 pack $58) Stickbaits - 4.75"" Rapala X-Rap Silver and a 3 5/8"" Live Target Perch[or equivalent] - $30 - There's also a 5.5"" saltwater version of the X-rap that's slightly larger. I like it.9) Paddletail Swimbaits - 5"" plastic $1010) Rapala Super Shad Rap - 1 $1511) Suick Thriller - 7"" 1; or similar in 6""-8"" $17 [or spend this on more casting spoons or stickbaits]Adds up to $156.If you already have leaders, jaw spreaders and pliers I'd pick up another stickbait or a swimbait and another spoon or two. If you like in-line spinners, that's another option. I prefer spoons over the spinners, but they are still good."
5247242,Daveygravy,2016-12-31 14:17:00,88,"My pike box always has a big supply of 6 inch paddle tail swimbaits. They are so versatile, if fish are shallow, rig them on a swimbait hook for a weed less setup that can be fished slower. If fish are deeper, use them on 3/4 and larger swim bait heads. When the tails get bit off its not expensive."

If you had $150 to spend to put a small pike box together, what would you go after?On our Canada trips, I spend almost 100% of my time going after walleye. This summer, I am determined to branch out and spend more time deliberately targeting pike. Beyond the standard red and white daredevles and/or floating rapalas, what do you guys recommend for a starter kit?My fly-ins are in late May/mid June.

5246506,BornToFish,2016-12-31 07:36:00,1224,"Greetings,I applaud your interest in wanting to get into pike fishing. I find that pike and walleye often complement one another very nicely. The walleye bite in the lake that I most often fish tends to be morning and evening. The walleye bite during the middle of the day often slows. The middle of the day is when I tend to find a good bite for northern pike. This one-two-one punch keeps me busy most days.The northern pike in the lake that I most often fish are associated with the shorelines until about mid-June. They first relate to shallow emerging weeds. Then, they move to the first break (weed edge) as the water warms. By mid-June, the larger pike follow the developing thermocline and move off-shore. The larger pike typically locate and then set up on structural elements such as deep-water points and rock humps. The ""eater"" and dink northern pike often continue to relate to weeds while their bigger brethren are relating to deeper water. Most pike move shallow again just before turn-over and then disperse after turnover.The reason that I reviewed the seasonal movements of the pike in the lake that I most often fish is that my northern pike lures tend to be in two categories. The ""small"" stuff such are spoons, spinner baits, in-line spinnerbaits, and smaller rubber, crankbaits or jerkbaits. Mike Borger gave an excellent starting point with these lures. The choice of individual lure over weeds is often dictated by how fast the northern pike are willing to chase on any given day or how thick the weeds are.I switch over to large profile lures when the pike are relating to deeper water. This is when I get out the bigger crankbaits and big rubber - classic musky lures. I'm using lures that pike can ""silhouette"" against the surface. The bigger pike can't seem to help themselves when they are sitting twenty feet down in the water column and see a big profile lure swim over them at ten feet down. Again, Mike Borger mentioned the Bucher Depth Raider as a good example - you won't go wrong with this lure. Weighted jerkbaits (e.g. Suicks or Bobby Baits) are another good choice.One of my favorite lures over deep water rocks has been the Musky Innovations Bull Dawg. I have caught many 35 - 40+ inch northern pike that had an entire five ounce Bull Dawg AND the leader entirely within their mouth.In the autumn, many pike return to the shallow weeds about two weeks before turnover. Anything presented slowly seems to work just fine for me. Any of the lures mentioned above will work just fine, so long as it is presented slowly.If I correctly recall, the original poster said he might be fishing in mid-June. If so, I suggest pounding the deeper edge of cabbage weeds. If you get them going - stay with it. If you're not finding anything happening, I suggest moving to off-shore rock humps that are near shore - the first set of humps closest to shore. You might find the bigger pike relating to these rock humps.Have fun with the pike this season. Good fishing and tight lines!!"

Last year on Athabasca two young men in camp caught almost all of their big pike throwing oversized Topraiders. Was an eye opening experience for me, as they fished some of the same bays I did.Quote: Originally Posted by HawkerFor sure add to the above mentioned list(s) at least a couple three 1 oz chrome/blue Rattle Traps.

Have to say I loved the Bulldog too until I had 5 consecutive tails bit off by hammer handle pike LOL!I honestly find that big, fat, wide profile 8 and 10 inch Kalins grubs will work just as well as a Bulldog and are way less expensive. Should have put Kalins grubs on my list of plastics, they're a go-to bait!"

These Bull Dawgs are pretty pricey (ca. $20). Thus, I keep putting them back together to get one more fish out of them. I mostly use Bic lighters and propane torches to close up rips. I've even attached spare tails with electrical zip ties. I remember a few years ago when I broke open a new Bull Dawg. I watched a 18 inch pike grab ahold of the tail and stretch the tail out about two feet. As you might expect, the tail broke off and was pulled into the weeds. I watched a $20 bill disappear.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
