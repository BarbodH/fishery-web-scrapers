5770881,rather-be-fishin,2017-09-17 20:26:00,429,"I haven't been to Lac Seul Lodge, but stayed at Onaway and was very happy with cabins, dock and service. Also good location on the lake. RBF"
5770889,Aspencreek,2017-09-17 20:30:00,2911,"Onaway! No question. Better access to the main lake, with very good fishing close to camp. All the cabins are newer, the fish house is great, camp boats are very good and the dock is the best around anywhere. But I am biased, been there 12 times in the last 16 yrs."
5770961,prov1800,2017-09-17 21:01:00,5010,Having guided out of both camps either one would be fine.both have about the same distances to travel to get to main lake.and both have fish within those distances.but as aspencreek mentioned the fish cleaning house and docks are first class.ill mention this.if interested you better notcwait to long to book at either place.lots of repeat business.
5770993,Aspencreek,2017-09-17 21:56:00,2911,"X2 on the reservations. Most of Onaway's bookings are repeat groups. I always book for the next year when I leave, this year I wasn't able to go at all, (work and daughters wedding) so I had to give up my week, now I'm not so sure if I am going to be able to get back in. If you wait to much longer you will not get what you want. BTW what week are you thinking....just kidding, just book it and start the countdown to next year."
5773921,Steve Ediger,2017-09-19 10:44:00,97,"I have not stayed at Onaway although I have been to the camp to look it over. I have however, spent 50+ weeks at Lac Seul Lodge over the past 20 years. In my opinion, LSL is the finest housekeeping camp on the Northwest portion of Lac Seul. The cabins are very well maintained and clean as are their boats and other equipment. The camp is close to the excellent fishing offered on that portion of the lake. Like previous posts, LSL operates at near capacity and most guests are return clients, so early booking is suggested. I am heading up there in 3 days for my last Canada trip of the year and am very much looking forward to seeing the gang up there."
5774689,prov1800,2017-09-19 19:02:00,5010,Should be good.took a party out of onaway on weekend.fishing was excellent.you have been there in fall so you will know how to fish it.
5777089,ToxicAngler,2017-09-21 11:24:00,30,"I've never stayed at Onaway but have seen plenty of their boats out on the lake. LSL is great! Cabins are nice and all the staff are courteous and friendly. Stayed there the first week of September this year and was not disappointed. I booked for next year already, knowing that they fill up fast."
5889778,[emailÂ protected],2017-12-09 08:23:00,1,I am a new customer to LSL and Lac Seul. I am coming June 9th for a week and I am trying to get in your week or one week earlier. Any and I mean any suggestions or help about where to fish would be very much appreciated. I am a 50 year Canada fisherman but have never fished Lac Seul
5889986,Pooch,2017-12-09 10:08:00,4618,"From LSL to get to the main lake you go through two (if water levels is high enough you can go through the ""shortcut"" which opens into Bay of Islands, which is actually the main lake area) or three bays before reaching Farewell Bay which is also the main lake.The bays you go through reaching the main lake are usually good fishing early in the season. I've only been to that area once at that time of year and some of the pretty good fishing was in any of the bays off of the main lake. Some folks never left the bay areas all week.A buddy likes the South inlet area early of mid season. Several of the sand banks seem to be decent, but can get more fishing pressure early to mid summer.I've found on LS the mid lake areas are really slow early season, but that changes mid to late summer. Kind of the same pattern on most lakes we fish, but just more pronounced on LS maybe because of it's size and mostly sand bottom content. Fish seem to be linger shallow longer on LS than other lakes I'm familiar with.The folks at LSL are usually really helpful, but like all workers their information can be a week or two outdated.You should not have much of a struggle to find fish if you have been fishing Canada for a while. Because LS has so much more sand bottom it just fishes differently than the rocky shield lakes. Takes some change of habits to adjust. I'm still figuring it out. Keep an open mind and try different areas.Couple years ago I was alone and got tired of the rough water so pulled into a more protected area and it was full of fish. Depth was four to eight foot with scattered weeds. I would never thought to try there, but it made sense as the wind was slightly brushing that pocket along the shore for two days and it was full of bait fish and walleyes. When the wind blew I caught over slots. When the wind moved back away from the pocket I caught eaters. One of the more interesting mornings I've had.Have a good trip. We will be back to LSL mid July.Pooch"
