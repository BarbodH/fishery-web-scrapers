5894898,BornToFish,2017-12-13 06:12:00,1224,"Greetings,I have two suggestions to ponder. First, ask ""why"" is someone recommending a particular lodge/lake. Nearly every lodge in Ontario is hosted by great people and offers great fishing. A perfect lodge/lake for someone might be a complete disaster for the next person. In other words, know what factors about a lodge/lake are important to you and your group.The second suggestion is to develop a ""short list"" of lodges/lakes to investigate at a nearby ""All Canada"" type sports show this winter that might be near where you live. The internet and referrals might help develop the short list of candidates. The ""problem"" is that all lodges and lakes look great on the internet. Meet and spend time with the lodge owners to find out who and what is behind the internet website. Trust your intuition!The bottom line is that it's your time and money when it comes to your vacation. Spend both wisely!Good fishing and tight lines!!"

We normally go in June, but there is a huge amount of water of all depths and type. Also heard good things about Donnelys(sp?) just up the road on the Pickerel Arm of Minnitaki."
