He took trips to Pike lakes, often with his wife. I think he also was a writer. (Not Mike Borger) Anyway he sold Pike Spoons on his web site also. I know it's not much to go on but I'm hoping somebody can point me in the right direction. I wanna say his first name was Jack, but won't swear to it. Any help is appreciated."
