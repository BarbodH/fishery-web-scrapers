Have a problem with a person in party going across border so just looking around for a backup. Mostly jigging for walleye or perch and casting for smallmouth and pike. Looking in June or early July also late Sept.

The U.S side of Rainy Lake would be an option & has the species you want to fish. However, it can be a difficult lake to fish, so would be a good idea to hire a guide a head of time for your first day to put you on fish, because it's a big lake & you got to know where to go & how to fish it. Good Luck! RBF"
