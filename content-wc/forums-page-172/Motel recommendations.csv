5896786,Rpetrusky,2017-12-14 14:13:00,1,Does anyone have a good suggestion for a motel around Spooner? Three of us are planning to overnight on the way to Canada?
5897050,NARDA 1,2017-12-14 17:46:00,636,"Superior WI has a nice Super8 844-397-6271 right on 53 with a good bar and restaurant, Gronk's http://www.gronksgrill.com next door."

Now in understand that this is a long drive from Spooner. I'd suggest looking at the Superior/ Duluth area which is a good hour north of Spooner. Lots & lots of hotel choices in this area and is on the way to Canada. Loook at internet web sits like Priceline.com to see what hotels are in the area and their rates. I do read the reviews and won't stay at hotels that have too many bad reviews. If you are looking for a room on a Friday night, better book now! When you used to travel at night for our fishing trips, I was always amazed that every hotel north of Ear Claire on Hwy 53usdd to have their no vacancy sign on."
