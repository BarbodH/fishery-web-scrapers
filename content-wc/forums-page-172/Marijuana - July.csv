5912346,NP4ME,2017-12-25 15:09:00,378,"kzoo, Seems like you are already smoking some of the green stuff that seems to be so popular among the posters on this topic. All kidding aside, every time I have gone to Canada I have seen numerous people pulled to the side and having their high dollar items taken from them after the agents ""planted"" (no pun intended) all kinds of stuff on them. I even got lucky one time to have an agent show me their secret office where they keep all their ""throw down"" items so they can take whatever they want. It's an amazing process!"
5912410,kzoofisher,2017-12-25 16:06:00,5144,"Wow, thanks for the confirmation. I had heard it happens but mostly from ultra-libertarian anti-government types who I always thought were a little nutty."
5912610,Obabikon,2017-12-25 20:20:00,2370,"For the record... I've crossed the border 100's of times in the past 10 years. I have had thousands of guests cross the border to come visit. Not a single time has anyone I know ever even accused a guard of planting some type of illegal contraband. Heck... I've had guests get caught trying to lie about how many booze they were bringing in. They didn't even get that confiscated. Only thing anyone has ever lost were crawlers in dirt.... and even that the agents did not take them, they made them drive back and pour them out on the US side. I am not saying this doesn't happen. There are horrible people in every profession. However, this is not at all the norm!"

5912666,NP4ME,2017-12-25 23:06:00,378,"Obabikon, I hope you know, which I believe you do, that my post was totally in jest. I get so tired of all this conspiracy talk garbage that I had to come up with some off the wall post to humor myself. I, along with numerous people I know, have made countless trips to Canada over the past 25 years. Some of them have brought some pretty darn nice rigs with them. I know, to the shock of many, they weren't accosted, nothing was planted on them and, believe it or not, they even made it back without their ultra-expensive belongings being seized from them. But, I'm sure there are plenty of stories where somebody heard from somebody that heard from somebody that heard from somebody..."
5912698,kzoofisher,2017-12-26 03:15:00,5144,"OMG, mine was too. Poking fun at the crackpots who think the gubmint is out to get them in the most outrageous ways is a thing with me. NP cracked a joke about being shown the ""secret room"" and I breathlessly lapped it up while trying to act like I'm normally reasonable. A classic posting style of the paranoid DK types."
5912714,Shellback,2017-12-26 05:40:00,8083,"My border experiences have been seeing the Canadian agents checking Canadians much more thoroughly than US people. I think that was mostly back when the $ was par and Canadians were taking advantage of shopping in the US. Personally I have always felt very comfortable crossing into Canada, their agents have been very pleasant. Crossing back into the US, many guards make me uncomfortable with their questioning. I prefer crossing into Canada rather than crossing into the US. That's why I tend to think they crossing into the US might take longer due to the new laws."
5913042,Obabikon,2017-12-26 09:24:00,2370,"I was hoping they were in jest, but reading them... it is hard to tell. There are a lot of people who get on here looking for information. If they find a sarcastic post, and can't read into it... they might assume that happens. No big deal, thanks for clearing it up. Merry Christmas"
5904034,Wall-i-Lama,2017-12-19 14:30:00,1524,"Yes you are, lol."
5904274,Obabikon,2017-12-19 17:26:00,2370,That's good. Hard to tell what people are actually saying when they use sarcasm in text form. This is not going to change the way the border handles anything.
5904338,Wall-i-Lama,2017-12-19 18:02:00,1524,"Yes, Im a sarcastic person. I think the Canadian crossing will remain unchanged. I believe that the US crossing will be made more difficult. While many states have moved in the direction of legalization, the federal government has definitely not and they control the border. I definitely expect the wait times to increase coming back. The sniffer dogs will be going wild! Actually, all sarcasm and kidding aside. I've never had an issue coming into Canada in 25 years. I can't say the same for US and have been reprimanded many times for food type violations. Won't ever forget about having Canadian purchased oranges aboard again!"
5910282,LoDo,2017-12-23 12:45:00,721,"Canada changes the law to pro MJ and now the US has to spend loads of money on increased border patrol. Not complaining, simply pointing out the fact. Bringing MJ into Canada wont change. If anything it may be a bit easier in Washington and BC as this border is pro MJ. Montana, ND, MN, and moving east most likely the same too. No reason to cross the border with MJ when you can simply buy, as good if not better MJ in Canada. I read an article where Ontarios market will be controlled by the government. Thats too bad. Socialist at its finest. There will probably be 3-4 stores in Ft Frances and easily 1-2 in Dryden, Ear Falls, Red Lake etc.... I agree with most of the comments on this board that MJ isn't going to affect camps other then adding the simple language to NOT be high, similar to drunk, when driving the boats. LOL. Hands down, IMO, the largest change will be the US border."
5910962,Guest,2017-12-23 21:26:00,0,"Not much will change. They already check for it you silly ducks. If your vehicle gets ripped apart from a lack/use of common sense that's on you. O.P. already has testing kits to test driver's, boaters included under the influence of drugs. They have been testing these for a while now and it is treated as a DUI type format. Get picked up and know telling when you'll get out of the Canadian jail system. It is a very serious ""felony type"" crime there. I live on the border and cross a lot heading to our cabin so maybe I have a skewed opinion. One last thought.... If it's illegal to carry MJ in MN it's on you to travel through the state carrying an illegal substance. We are always looking for out of state money to bring into the county = revenue"
5911074,Obabikon,2017-12-24 05:51:00,2370,"None of what you said will actually be true. Why would the US increase border patrol to fight pot? You can already buy it legally in several states in the US. Heck the federal government hasn't enforced marijuana laws since President Obama won his first election. There is one LCBO store in Ft. Frances... why would there be 3-4 stores for marijuana? There will be one... and not right away. The US border will be completely unchanged. Marijuana will not be for sale by the pound or anything like that, and the US does not care at all about small amounts of pot. They aren't going to magically start cracking down because Canada decided to legalize it."
5911282,kzoofisher,2017-12-24 09:02:00,5144,"I doubt there will be any difference in border crossings with one notable exception, guys pulling boats that an agent wants. Civil forfeiture laws are not civilian friendly. Yank a guy to the side, plant a little baggie and take his stuff. Probably won't happen though because abuse of power never happens."
5911306,Shellback,2017-12-24 09:16:00,8083,"Bring some pot in across the US border and see how you fare. Sure it's legal in some states. But it better **** well be kept in those states. States adjoining those where it is legal are still busting people passing through, and in most cases it's a felony. Please don't give any Canadians your thoughts on the US not caring about MJ possession crossing the border. They might find themselves in a heap of trouble."
5911506,v-bay gord,2017-12-24 11:55:00,3168,I consider it payback for the US changing daylight saving time..........
5911594,Obabikon,2017-12-24 13:43:00,2370,"Yes... Minnesota is CRACKING DOWN on Marijuana possession (heavily sarcastic). 42.5 grams and under (1.5 ounces) In the state of Minnesota, that is a misdemeanor, and has a capped punishment of $200 fine. That is about the same cost as a minnesota speeding ticket. ($145 for a 15mph ticket)Sure... if you're trying to smuggle 20 pounds of pot in... that's going to be an issue. They aren't looking for people with joint stuck in the ashtray. For the record, you're not going to be able to purchase pot that way in Canada... it will be similar to Colorado. Not designed for ""bulk"" purchases."

Or maybe you will let people import MJ plants, as long as they are in artificial dirt! LMAO LCBO will be renamed to MLCBO."

Has nothing to do with pot, and everything to do with invasive species. It is true going BOTH ways. You certainly can't transport dirt either direction. 2. The Government is obviously going to tax this. Just like every other country in the world does. Your comments on this aren't really making sense to me."

5901202,mjayn,2017-12-18 09:07:00,1188,"Not much will change. On the 10 trips I have taken to Canada there was always someone at the camp that had it. One trip to Lake of the woods out of the 10 cabins at the resort 7 of them were confirmed to have a stash, the other 3 we weren't sure. My Dads buddies and him were always into the stuff, on the boat, after hours, even in the morning. Caught alot of fish on those trips and never an argument or any issues really. The few times we went to Canada without them bringing any were also fine, just a little more rowdy. Without MJ to slow them down it was wild turkey and red beer until the wee hours, arguments, reliving highschool fights, complaining about wives.....not bad, just drunken fun but ....MJ and whiskey > whiskey. It seems completely ridiculous it was ever illegal as a prescribed medicine, and I see no reason why it isn't legal for recreational use also. Keep it illegal for kids and for driving, otherwise..... enjoy."

The bad News: I'm sure they will add DEA (wearing vests, helmets and armed with AR15s) to the mix at the border and the wait times will at least triple."
5901330,Obabikon,2017-12-18 10:29:00,2370,"Well... my point was, if they aren't going to crack down on it coming in from other states... why would they crack down on it coming in from Canada? The truth is, times are changing. No one is going to be doing any prison time over a little pot. Heck, they probably aren't even fining people. Anyone trying to smuggle in 1000 LBs... well that's a different story. I don't use the stuff. I hate having smoke in my lungs. But, they won't be cracking down any harder than they do people bringing booze in. They certainly aren't going to be having dogs at the border more often because of it."

It may be something overlooked in Canada, but some states are very tough on it. DUI in Canada is a felony, just like many states consider possession of MJ a felony. I don't care one way or the other with people using it, just wanted to point out that don't count on any US law enforcement turning their back."

Once the law is passed, I could bring marijuana into Canada, but not minnows, leeches, firewood, dog food and sometimes potatoes, eggs and chicken! Makes perfect sense. Or perhaps they will write the law where it's legal to use there, just not legal for US citizens to bring across the border. Maybe the will have duty free doobies for sale at the border!"

Of course, if you've been smuggling drugs to begin with I can't see this law changing your attitude much. Considering the amount a lot of guys drink, and brag about drinking, on their trips I'm not the least bit worried that the addition of MJ changing the overall sobriety of fisherman."

Last night in Minneapolis, the hotel elevator we were staying in had a very clear odour of weed. I see no real reason for recreational marijuana to be illegal on either side of the border."
5901002,mswope13,2017-12-18 07:16:00,73,"I wish all states would legalize so Colorado can start dispersing the incredible amount of homeless population into other states. There's someone on every corner/intersection in Colorado Springs since the inception of MJ a few years back. They get their $20 and walk a couple blocks to one of the many dispensary's located here. Nothing against the legalization, never used MJ and I don't drink, but I have seen the local impact on it. The impact on border crossings will be interesting to say the least. People (users in Minnesota) will cross the border to get the product, but then again, they can get it anywhere illegally anyway. I do assume there will be more vehicle checks while crossing. All the more reason to drive 15 hours and stay the night in International Falls, then cross early the next morning. Last July we went through without a vehicle on the bridge (7:00 am)."

Regardless if mj is something you're in to or not, I'm curious as to how this will affect peoples trips. Does MN border where mj is not legal become more stringent crossing back to the US?

Marie border might be interesting at that time. Not too mention all the borders along Southern Ontario as most of the major cities will have stores in July 2018.As far as I know, the current rules for Ontario state you can only use marijuana in your private residence. So, technically, I don't think you can use it at a camp, boat, hotel or outdoors anywhere at the moment. Although, it seems like your own private backyard is OK. Although, even that is unclear. This is all very new and much has not been decided yet. I mean, what about the edible products and vaporizers and whatever else people use? All very unclear. To add even more confusion, each province will decide on sale and use rules within their province as well. Don't expect anything to go smoothly though and I'd anticipate longer wait times at the border starting in July."

Ppl for the most part are respectable with smoking privately and not out in the open, in front of kids, etc....Our group definitely drinks several beers x daily on this trip and I know several others do too. Its going to get interesting for those same folks to add the mj cocktail to their habits. Yes, ppl cross the border all the time with mj. No chance the border can catch everyone. Id assume border patrol looking for the big quantities and not the small amount/personal.Crossing the border back into MN, ND, etc... going to be interesting. Id imagine border towns such as Ft Francis weed stores going to be extremely busy for summers to come. MJ is much easier to hide and control when/if stopped by the bounty. I think mj is going to be a popular, in the boat fix, substitution for many folks on this trip."
