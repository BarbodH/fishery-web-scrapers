It was designed and planned out not as a fishing trip but as family adventure with lots of stuff to do as my wife and even kids are not as crazy about fishing as I am. We fished no longer then 1 1/2 hours as a family and then I had a couple hours in the afternoon to myself I can deal with that because it is my second trip to Canada a bonus so to speak. Kaby Lake has old gold mines, swimming beaches, deserted cabins, shorelines full of interesting rocks yes including gold. The best shorelunch spots I have ever seen. Watson's Kaby Lodge has the finest service I have ever been treated to. The food is not short of spectacular. Cabins super clean with showers. Owners are the nicest lodge owners I have met. Staff are incredible. You can tell I was impressed. The wife and kids were so impressed they want to go to Canada every summer guess I did something rightðŸ˜‚ didn't hurt that her friends called on the way home from the 95 degree Outer Banks stuck in traffic for 4 hours while we buzzed along 75 south thru Michigan. The video has a lot of family stuff from the trip but a ton of fishing towards the end. Captured a great shorelunch too. Will never stop going to O'Sullivans Rainbow Lodge with my brother Nathan in the end of June First part of July but a bonus trip in August that is frosting on the cake here is my video my blog is walleyewarrior.blogspot.com"
