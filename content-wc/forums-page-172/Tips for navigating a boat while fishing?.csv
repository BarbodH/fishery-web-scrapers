5887698,That Minnesota guy,2017-12-07 20:12:00,8293,For a Canadian trip leave a 12 pack of beer at home and bring a couple of markers. Much easier to set up a nice drift or trolling run if you know where the humps and drop offs are.
5888066,MrSimon,2017-12-08 08:09:00,922,I have $4k worth of electronics on my boat .... and a $12 marker buoy is still my most important tool for walleye fishing.
5888266,pjshorthorn,2017-12-08 09:01:00,5654,"Better yet, bring the beer on the trip and drop a waypoint on your depth finder so every ninny doesn't horn in on your humps. Last year I found a very defined contour and dropped a waypoint immediately every time I hooked a fish. I followed that track every morning and evening and it produced fish every day. Set the hook, drop a waypoint, take the boat out of gear, net the fish....repeat. Easy Peasey PjShorthorn"
5899898,Moosebunk,2017-12-17 08:48:00,211,"He got one of my answers first. Rarely if ever backtroll. If you can drift, great. If you have a spare bucket or two kicking around, tie 'em off the cleats with whatever short rope is around and you essentially have two quick drift socks."
5899946,That Minnesota guy,2017-12-17 09:19:00,8293,"PJ, I mentioned markers because the OP mentioned camp boats. I'm not sure the quality of electronics on those camp boats other then reading depth. But I agree, if you have the electronics just drop a waypoint and mark everything with that."
5907242,Hillbiehle,2017-12-21 09:08:00,66,"A lot of good information. Two items that I've done over the years that I don't believe have been mentioned.I bring a rubbermade tote in the boat to stay organized. One big box to walk containing raincoats, lunch, extra tackle was much better than having items all over and was easy to reach in the middle between bow and stern.There are time where I'd bungee cord on the small seat in the bow as well.Plus much easier to carry items to and from cabin.Other thing I've utilized was a cheap basketball net. Tied up with a rock it madea perfect anchor.As soon as we have a double, at times, shut the engine off and drop anchor and catch fish after fish."
5884354,HeHooksHimself,2017-12-05 07:16:00,725,"This was a great thread and I enjoyed the input of some WC superstars, well except for maybe PJ Shorthorn. I would never consider a wind sock. If it is that windy we usually go find a place that is calmer. Anyway, just waiting until June! Fish On! Hooks"
5884706,Pooch,2017-12-05 10:44:00,4618,"Took a windsock one time to Savant specifically to fish a very long sloping bottom area that I like. The sock worked well as long as there is a SW wind and I knew that, but in a rental 16.5' boat it was a PITA. I still keep the sock in an ice cream container ""just in case"" I ever want to use it again.If you can't get into a long drift pattern with the wind being about right the sock is not worth the hassle. Big water and long drift? Great tool in the right circumstance and boat that is larger than most camp boats.Pooch"
5885842,MrSimon,2017-12-06 07:48:00,922,"We've never used a driftsock. If the wind is too stiff for a proper drift, you can usually drag the anchor (often times a coffee can filled with cement) on a short line to slow you down. It's funny, on my boat at home I'll spend massive amounts of money on GPS enabled trolling motors and networked fish finders so I can have perfect boat control. At an outpost I don't care. We just go where the wind takes us. It's refreshing to leave all the technology at home sometimes."
5885858,pjshorthorn,2017-12-06 07:57:00,5654,"A 5 gallon bucket with 1/2"" holes drilled in it works well when drifting down wind. Pull it up when back trolling or you'll either go insane from the noise when it bounces off the hull or beat the snot out of the boat....or both..... Don't let any fishing partners use it as a pee bucket.......don't ask me how I know. PjShorthorn"
5886098,bthomas3333,2017-12-06 11:47:00,465,Hey - My two cents would be this lower your expectation of fishing while operating. My buddy and I both experienced boat drivers and fisherman and I can say operating the boat from the rear tiller will reduce your fishing time / quality a good bit. My buddy and I realize this and just switch off every 3-4 hours. IMO you are better off to keep the other fishermen in the right spot at the right speed and 'help' them catch the fish when driving. It doesn't mean you wont get a line in the water but I just find certain times where you are better off to focus on one primary thing at a time. Times like (Wind / weather / small spots / speed sensitive presentations) are all better managed by keeping your lure in the boat. In the wind say pike fishing a smaller bay I might make 50% of the casts compared to my buddy and a lot of times I am casting to open water and leaving the prime spots to the guy in front.An exception to all of this is when you have a bow mounted trolling motor. In these cases I would WAY rather be the one in front. You get to control the speed perfectly. You get to see the fish on the monitor first. The fish see your lure / jig first. Love to be the operator in that spot.Anyway have fun!B-
5886106,johnboat,2017-12-06 12:04:00,2014,"In addition to many of these good suggestions, TAKE TIME FOR YOURSELF. You will get to a point where you just loose focus. Whether it's the wind, the rain, the cold, the whining, the yipping, the snagging, or all combined at once...............Drop the anchor and take a break! Or motor around an Island and get out of the wind to recharge YOUR batteries, have a snack, take a nap, whatever it takes to get your mind right from the weather conditions to your lack of sleep or just getting tired as the week goes on. When you loose focus..............that's when the accidents happen."
5886394,Baseline,2017-12-06 19:10:00,3207,"If you are going to a drive to resort. Bring along an electric trolling motor, deep cycle battery and charger. A stern drive 45 lb Minnkota Endura should do it for the size boat you will have. The electric motor will allow for good boat speed control and you won't have to listen to the gas motor all-day. C-list has lots of these motors listed for sale for less than $100."
5886618,MrSimon,2017-12-07 07:00:00,922,"Couldn't agree more!!!!!!! Trolling motors are worth their weight in gold, even if they are small and on the back."
5886626,andreindy,2017-12-07 07:03:00,308,"Well said. When I assume the ""chief"" duties of navigation, positioning, I must also assume the role of ""servant"" to the cause....which is to assist my partner in their experience and success. However, my brother WILL learn to reciprocate or I have numerous stories to share with his girlfriend (which I probably will anyway)."
5887162,gordy28,2017-12-07 14:27:00,437,"Forgive me if this is redundant to another post I am a primary driver on our trips - we do a lot of bottom bouncing which requires a slow troll (1 to 1.8 MPH) I hate back trolling, I find it disorientating and hard to focus on fishing To control speed and to keep the boat moving forward I pop the boat in and out of neutral a lot - so bouncers down in neutral, start to troll forward and as I feel the bouncer start to lose touch w the bottom pop it intro neutral To guide us we typically drop 2 bottom bouncers at the start and end of a structure - so for a hump the rise and the drop off We have actually had a lot of success on really windy days simply drifting with bottom bouncers. I pretty much keep the motor running and use short bursts of reverse or forward to keep me aiming to the structure ( re marker bouys mentioned above) For jigging we tend to drift w an almost vertical presentation - again keeping the boat running to correct our course. If there is almost no wind I tend to bump along the structure with short bursts as well but with long pauses to keep bottom contact I will say by the end of every trip I feel like I have developed carpal tunnel in my tiller wrist and a stiff back but wouldn't trade it for the world Cheers Gordy"

4576113,elway12,2016-02-23 20:46:00,335,Thanks for all...well most - of the great tips and tricks! Keep them coming!
4576201,Guest,2016-02-23 21:25:00,0,Hey. This is an REW reply.
4576377,roscoe33,2016-02-23 23:49:00,653,"Congratulations. You have just become a charter boat captain.We back troll often when my parents are in my boat.Its what mom and dad want to do. ( in their 80's )It gets even more interesting when there are 4 in the boat.The nice thing is that when back trolling, all the lines are out the bow, not back by the prop. If the boat spins a little, their lines are generally unaffected, and you have a little time to get the boat straightened out. Also helpful when following shoreline, going around points, or islands.Your job has now become to take care of your customers (friends or family sitting up front).You run the motor, navigate, stop the boat/motor when someone hooks a fish,shift into forward and maneuver the boat when someone gets snagged.If someone gets snagged, they MUST tell you, QUICKLY AND LOUDLY, that they are snagged.Everyone else in the boat should reel in their lines so you do not run them over while chasing the snagged line.Your personal fishing success will have to take a lower priority.Be prepared to quickly reel in your line when any of the above takes place, so you can concentrate on controlling the boat.If ...., ok, when, you hook a fish, shift motor into neutral and keep aware of the boat position as you are landing the fish.If the boat starts spinning, engage motor and straighten it out.You will tangle or cut lines if you don't.If you are getting close to shore or rocks, engage motor to move away from them.You will keep everyone happy, if you can control the boat.You start cutting lines or wrapping them around the prop, and people will get upset, including you.If you are getting frustrated with the situation, drift or anchor and jig, for a while to relieve the stress.Use this ""down time"" to retie lures, grab a snack, drink some coffee ( better stick to decaf), take a leak.I keep 3 rods ready to go when we are back trolling, as I surely don't have time to tie lines or switch lures while running the motor.It helps if you keep everyone informed about the depth, especially when it changes drastically, say from 18', to 8'.If possible, set your sonar in the back corner, facing forward, then the person in the next seat can see it, and inform others in the front.If I ( a dumb pizza maker) can do this, you can do this.Start by letting everyone know that they need to tell you when they have a fish on, or a snag. Then everyone else reels in and you put the boat in neutral. Everything else will follow.Oh look. I just wrote a book."
4576601,pjshorthorn,2016-02-24 05:43:00,5654,"Have you been fishing with my Dad? This accurately describes a day with my Dad in the boat. Despite all his shenanigans, Snagapotumus still catches some nice fish each trip. I like to think it is due to my unwavering patience and desire to be entertained while fishing with him. PjShorthorn"
4576657,BornToFish,2016-02-24 06:00:00,1224,"Many of the preceding responses offer great suggestions. There sure is a lot of information to process while operating a boat when backtrolling. Honestly, I prefer to be operating the boat, rather than sitting at the bow. As mentioned in an earlier post, you can make things a lot easier for yourself by keeping things in the boat neat and orderly. For example, I keep the net handle, the minnow bucket, marker buoys and release tools within easy reach. I try hard to keep things in their place so that I don't have clutter around me. There is one other thing that you can do. That is, train your boat partners to be self-sufficient. Encourage them to net their own fish whenever possible. Make sure that they have their own minnow bucket, so you don't have to reach them a minnow or pass the bucket to them. Make certain they have their own pliers and can bait their own hook. There are simple things that you can do to help yourself when operating the boat. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4578105,Pooch,2016-02-24 12:32:00,4618,"It appears from all the good advice given that if you want to actually fish this trip that you will have to jump in my boat for a few hours!! Otherwise you are just too busy driving to fish........Everyone has offered up a lot of good advise, but as one guy said, ""it's not that big a deal"" and another said ""just keep everything organized and within arms reach"". I'm thinking your group will be pretty self sufficient so maybe you will actually get to fish once in a while during the trip! My bet? Half a day (tops) and you guys will have a system going in your boat.Pooch"
4580545,SinOrSwim,2016-02-25 07:08:00,1528,"It is also your duty and responsibility as the captain of the vessel to F with your boat partner. If you are going forward, wait for the guy in the front to not be paying attention and grab his line and PULL HARD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5883962,andreindy,2017-12-04 18:48:00,308,I thought this was a great thread...just found it. And this will be us. One of my questions is whether any of you bother to bring/pack a drift sock when on fly-in trips?
4573321,northernbite,2016-02-23 07:05:00,1186,Just go out and do it. It's simple enough and that is how we all learned. I like to troll with rod in hand so I hold rod in right hand and have crank handle on left side of reel. Also when jigging I put boat into wind and hold boat on spot with throttle. Also tighten the motor so it doesn't turn real easy then you can let go of tiller for a few seconds. Have fun and enjoy! Paul
4573593,SinOrSwim,2016-02-23 08:21:00,1528,"will all depend on the wind. If it's windy..........good luck. Backtrolling you will have to decide how wet you want to get. Because any waves.......you will get soaked. If you are jigging or even pulling bait rigs, if it's windy drive to a point you want to start, flip the boat sideways and drift over your spot. Or, put the nose into the wind, move forward, put in neutral and drift back through. With the nose of the boat always pointing INTO the wind. Use the motor so it odesn't turn sideways."
4573641,Manitou,2016-02-23 08:33:00,125,Use left-handed level wind reels for trolling.The rod stays in your right hand so that your left can switch between controlling the motor and using the reel.
4573905,billy weaver,2016-02-23 09:35:00,470,As SinOrSwim says prepare to get wet. In the small camp boats without WaveWacker shields on the transom you will get wet. That's not to say it is not a good option but with waves you will get wet. It won't take you long to get the hang of operating the boat.
4573913,richf,2016-02-23 09:38:00,31,"If no bilge pump in your boat take a small 12 volt pump with alligator clips, a length of stiff hose and a 12 volt battery so you can pump out the boat rather than hand bail. Backing into waves will bring a lot of water into the boat but it's the only way to have any chance of boat control when vertical jigging. Always throw your marker bouys into the wind so you can back up towards them. If it's real windy, have your partner in the bow sit on the nose of the boat to keep the transom as high as possible."
4574673,Mr. Sauger,2016-02-23 13:47:00,285,"How you get set up can make your day a lot easier. When running the tiller all day I like to have needed things within an arm’s reach. Let’s say you are running the tiller – whether you are trolling, backtrolling, drifting, cruising or whatever – you are still sitting on the rear bench seat. You need your hand on the tiller or at least the ability to grab it ASAP. (OK, you occasionally get that beautiful day when you can stand and gently drift).Left hand on the tiller, right hand holding a rod. When you get a hit, sweep set the hook and try to put the motor in neutral with your left (tiller) hand ASAP before you run out of sweep. Start cranking and have the other guy in the boat (Cabin boy) net the fish and hopefully remove the hook for you. The sooner you can get back to fishing the sooner you can get the boat back under control which means the sooner Cabin boy can resume fishing. Sometimes it makes sense to put it in neutral when the boatmate hooks one so he is not fighting the forward momentum of the boat. Keep the boat under control so it does not spin or his line goes under the boat, etc. All depends on conditions, but the point is you are responsible for keeping the boat under control at all times when lines are in the water. If you are forward trolling and notice you are getting shallow fast, hold you rod tip high and increase speed to get you lures higher so they do not snag. Notify Cabin boy what is going on until he figures it out on Thursday. Typically you are sitting on an angle (slightly to the left/port). It makes sense to have the deptfinder at a comfortable angle for you. We often troll using the shoreline for reference. It makes sense to have the shoreline over your left shoulder when given the choice. A clamp on rod holder sure comes in handy. Cabin boy fishes off of the starboard side.Not sure how big your tackle box is, but keep it close. Maybe by your feet if room allows. They often fall off of bench seats in rough water, but only when unlatched. A pattern soon develops and soon I am only using a few lures. I keep these close by in unused the deptfinder cover, or even better in some McGuivered hook hanging system. May a length of rope tied between boat support brackets or a strip of adhesive backed foam insulation. You will want a place to keep your map handy too (not in the boat wake).SNAG yells Cabin Boy. You quickly notice his bent rod tip and stretched line to get a bead on where his snagged lure is. Just as quickly, you slam it in reverse so his line does not break. As you bring the boat alongside the snag, Snagmaster is softly reeling up the slack so you can still see where the line is. You go PAST where the snag is so Snagglepuss can reel and back the snag out. He will know when you have a snag when he hears the engine revving in reverse.Misc: * Keep a clean boat - Spilled beer attracts flies. * I like my own set of tools close by (needle nose pliers, jaw spreaders, line clippers, etc.). * Bring some rope for an anchor. Use a rock (don’t bring one from home; they have many good rocks up North). A mesh bag or some wire help tie the two together.Yep, operating a rented tiller is a boatload of work. Cabin Boy should take care everything else including; anchoring, the beverage cart, lunch/snacks, netting fish, releasing fish, etc."
4574729,MrSimon,2016-02-23 14:22:00,922,"Don't over think it .... just get in and go. You'll figure out what works for you by lunch time on the first day. Personally, I hate backtrolling. You get fumes in your face and water on your feet .... I can't stand either. We either drift, troll forward, or just cast."
4574769,retire55,2016-02-23 14:35:00,1029,"If I'm not anchored, I'm either back trolling or drifting. In either case, I use a drift sock to help control my speed when required. Occasionally the wind and waves force me to forward troll."
4575001,Pikeslayer8,2016-02-23 16:04:00,1460,"I like to keep the up-front, magic seat guy well informed of what the plan is, backtroll, forward troll or drift. I like to keep a couple of rods rigged so when I need to re-rig up, I don't lose the track I'm runnin."
4575097,BornToFish,2016-02-23 16:25:00,1224,"PikeSlayer made a great suggestion. My wife and I backtroll a LOT when fishing during August and September. My wife sits at the bow, while I am operating the motor. I have clear line of sight to the sonar unit, whereas my wife doesn't. It helps her considerably when I tell her that I am changing depth. She uses this information to take up or let out line, as may be needed to keep her jig in the strike zone (at the bottom of the lake). Without me telling her this, it would take her a while to figure out she needed to adjust length of line off the reel. By communicating with her, she stays dialed in. Happy wife = happy life! Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4572025,elway12,2016-02-22 16:39:00,335,"For our fishing trip to Canada this summer, I will be the main operator of our camp boat - 15hp Yamaha 16ft V-Hull boat. I have driven the boats before but only for a limited time and not while back trolling, using sonar, and fishing ALL at the same time! Any tricks and tips to make it a smooth process etc.? - besides of course EXPERIENCE!"
4572057,Obabikon,2016-02-22 16:46:00,2370,"Remember to pop it in and out of reverse. Don't let the boat get moving too fast. Also... always back into the wind. It makes things MUCH easier. If YOU set the hook, remember to put the boat in neutral."
4572073,3M TA3,2016-02-22 16:53:00,2846,"Often times you'll be able to take advantage of the wind as well. If you're lucky with the wind direction and speed you'll be able to take advantage of it and not use the engine at all. That will for sure allow you to focus on all the other things you're doing as well. Also, it is important to note that when you're trying to do all these things that time goes really, really fast. Divert your attention from any one thing, especially boat control, for say something like baiting up, and you can be going in circles in no time at all."
4572217,Live to jig,2016-02-22 17:53:00,159,"just have to practice, you will e fine after a day or so."
4572601,yoopertrout,2016-02-22 19:14:00,1172,"Last time I was in Canada, we did a lot of backtrolling up wind, and then drifting back with the wind. I found that it was easiest to put both feet behind the back bench seat, and put the tiller between my knees, while jigging."
4572665,BornToFish,2016-02-22 19:31:00,1224,"Greetings, I believe the term ""backtrolling"" has two meanings. One is that the boat's speed backwards is greater than the speed of the waves going forward. That is, the boat is moving backwards. You are trolling. Another meaning is that the speed of the boat going backwards is essentially cancelled by the speed of the waves going forward. That is, the boat is essentially stationary. You are vertical jigging. In the first case, you basically set the engine's throttle and go backwards at the desired speed. You might want to slip between neutral and reverse from time to time in order to control boat speed. In the second case, things get much more complicated. Obabikon made some great suggestions. I will further add that I make numerous minor adjustments to my boat speed by frequently changing back and forth from neutral and reverse. It's much easier to make many small adjustments than one big adjustment. You can also put out a marker buoy to aid you in controlling your boat. I leave my left hand on the gear selector. My right hand holds my fishing rod. My eyes are focused on the angle of my fishing line to the surface of the water. I peak at the marker buoy and sonar unit from time to time. I know it's time to change gears with the motor when my fishing line is not perpendicular to the surface of the water. Changes in depth of water being fished are deliberate. I change depth of water one foot at a time. This sounds easy. Anyone should be able to do it! However, it's like learning to ride a bicycle by reading a book. As another post mentioned, it will take some time to get your technique down. When vertical jigging, boat control is often what separates those that catch fish from those that drown minnows. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4572705,Guest,2016-02-22 19:50:00,0,Take at least 4 bouys with you for marking where you want to troll. If you find a hump or hot spot you want to troll around it. That way you can turn off your GPS and know where the location is. For example you may find a hump 200 feet long and drop a bouy on each end of the hump or mabey 3 bouys If you have luck there set a waypoint on your GPS so you can come back to the same spot next day. Did not ask you if you had a GPS but if not get one. We left our bouy out over night and the next morning 3 boats spotted our bouy and were fishing around it. We told them it was our bouy but they would not move from our hot spot and they were doing fine with Walleye and we stayed away about 200 feet but did not do so good. We picked up our bouy and they did not have one. They had to keep on their GPS to stay on the spot.
4572865,Bill Krejca,2016-02-22 20:59:00,6107,"When back trolling into a strong wind, it can be a good idea to move some of the weight from the back of the boat to up front. This could save you getting as wet, either from splash-up or from over the transom waves, due to a low stern. Bill"
4573249,north560,2016-02-23 06:43:00,53,Remember to have the fish finder set to beep when you hit 5-6 ft water depth gives you time to react. Just in case that shoal comes up before you think it should.
4573289,bigwalleye1,2016-02-23 06:56:00,2632,"Use the sonar to your advantage. The transducer is under your feet, and you're at the center of the cone. Pay more attention to the rod when you see a strong cone signal, and use the motor and speed to your advantage. Hold yourself over the fish when and where the signal is the strongest and the spot is the best, tip of the point, highest spot on the hump. I'm trying to keep the boat in the ideal position for everyone, not just me, but how am I gonna know if the boat is in the ideal position? By catching fish. I find I fish harder and do better than others the boat when I run it, and typically outfish everyone else in the boat.. I need to concentrate on the boat, position, sonar and catching fish, while others let their minds drift off and miss a lot of strikes. Borntofish is close..but it's like learning to ride a bike WHILE reading a book...and chewing gum, and talking on the phone, and writing a grocery list..... So many things to do all at once, but when you get it right, there is no better feeling."
