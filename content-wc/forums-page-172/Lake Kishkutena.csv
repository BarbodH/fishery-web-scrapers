5890818,Obabikon,2017-12-10 07:48:00,2370,"I have fished Kish 5-6 different times... all different times of the year. I would focus on July. You probably won't boat a musky much bigger than 40""... but if you fish hard, you'll catch a bunch of them. (we usually get 6+ each trip)"
5890858,Bill Krejca,2017-12-10 08:27:00,6107,"I remember drifting quietly into more than one bay and seeing what normally would seem to be pike cruising around, except that they were muskies,very unusual, at least to me. A long time ago, the appliance firm Westinghouse had a small fly-in private camp there. It was for exclusive use of their top high item corporate customers. When we camped there, in the 1970's I think, the manager boated over,and visited us. He was a friendly fellow, French-Canadian, with corresponding accent, and he told of the lake and a brief history.

5885410,Hovey,2017-12-05 16:50:00,7,"Hello,I am looking to go on a fly-in trip next year with some friends and my dad. I have heard from a couple people and they recommended Lake Kish for a fun muskie and smallmouth fishing trip (None of us have never caught a muskie so numbers will be fun for our group). My question is what time of year would you recommend for muskie and smallmouth fishing? And if anyone has any experience at any of the outfitters on the lake (Northwest Flying, Young's Wilderness, Tinkers, Kelly's Castaway...)?Thanks for the help,Hovey"
5885850,Bill Krejca,2017-12-06 07:54:00,6107,"I fished Kisk many years ago, while on a five portage canoe trip. It is a very pretty lake. We caught many small mouth, and several muskie during our 3-day camping stay. It also has/had a small population of walleye and lake trout, but we neither fished for, nor caught any - most folks don't even know they exist. I have stayed at Young's main camp many times, they run a first class camp, Carol is very nice. Bill"
5885882,Hovey,2017-12-06 08:10:00,7,Thanks for the input Bill! I appreciate it. I will have to look into Young's more then.
5886050,mjayn,2017-12-06 11:18:00,1188,"I carried a 15 horse motor and my father carried a 6 gallon metal gas tank. to that lake. I have never had a more grueling mini-adventure. Took us about 2.5 hours. It had rained the day before(big sloppy mess, super humid, yikes) but it was our only chance. We didn't even do that well as the front the day before killed the fishing on all the lakes we had access too. Beautiful lake and I had a few real nice musky follows to go along with one ~36"" musky and some smallies. I would love to go back on a good day. Sorry I can't help with the question. Have fun whatever you choose."
5886066,Hovey,2017-12-06 11:23:00,7,"Man that sounds like a rough hike in, but at least makes for good stories. The beauty of the lake is just as important as the fishing to me so that is great to hear. And good to hear someone saying some of the muskie have some size to them as I have read a lot of people saying it is just numbers. Thanks!"
5886074,Hawker,2017-12-06 11:25:00,3967,"Kish, is a fun fun lake to fish and holds excellent numbers of above average Smallmouth and quality size Skis!! Been there close to a dozen times, primarily in early June, and have had no problems catching (and releasing) more than my fair share of both species and everyone that I've met and spoken to relate very similar results. I've only used Young's as we also stay and fish at their main camp on LOTW, but they run a first class operation all the way. Their Kish outpost is at the far end of the lake (excellent fishing area), very nice cabin, quality boats and motors. Can't recommend Young's high enough! Carol and Perry are solid!!!"
5886082,Hovey,2017-12-06 11:40:00,7,Awesome! That is exactly what I was hoping to hear. The cabin looks great. I just wasn't sure how the location on the lake was and always good to know that good people are running the outfitter. Thanks for sharing your input I appreciate it.I know there are a few cabins on the lake do you remember how secluded that cabin is from the others?I have been on one fly-in trip and being so far away and alone was a great feeling and we are wanting that again.
5886570,Hawker,2017-12-07 06:20:00,3967,"Nearest cabin is 1/2 to 3/4 mile uplake on the same side, then at least that far to the next cabin that is on an island. I'd call it pretty secluded myself, and in the times I've been there, I've never seen anyone else at all."
5887106,jambi,2017-12-07 13:21:00,504,"I've done ten trips, all with my father, to Young's main camp. Saw the float plane many times take guests to Kish. Many good reports on their return trips for both Smallies and Muskies. Only reason I don't go to Young's now is I've switched to remote outposts further north that have Walleye and Pike. I want to be ""the only one on the lake."" When I grow out of this, I will be back to Young's. Have a great time."
5888386,Hovey,2017-12-08 10:04:00,7,Thanks for all the information! Yeah we did a fly in to a pike/walleye remote outpost with White River Air (Great people. I would recommend them to anyone) and had the time of our lives. I wanted somewhere with that feeling of serenity plus the ability to catch a muskie and Kish sounds like a great lake for that.
