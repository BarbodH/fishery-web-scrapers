The chances of the mercury disappearing very quickly appears to be slight. This is my understanding on the situation, from what I have read over the years. Bill"
5912154,That Minnesota guy,2017-12-25 08:50:00,8293,With the big mills in International Falls & Fort Francis does Rainy have a Mercury problem also? If so I haven't heard of it. Sorry to hijack the thread.
5912178,prov1800,2017-12-25 09:12:00,5010,They try to keep that info pretty quiete bill.the water in that area goes down the rainy river into lake of the woods.rainy lake would not be affected.i know people that live on the rainy river and they do not eat the fish from there either.its basically polluted like the wabigoon river.again any poluttents would end up in lake of the woods and lake of the woods owns out and turns into the Winnipeg river hooking up with the English river.its a nasty situation thats kept from the public.
5912746,Guest,2017-12-26 06:28:00,0,"I have been fishing this section of the English River for 15yrs (once a week each summer) We stay at The Last Resort now and used to stay at Grassy Narrows Lodge when it was open. We eat fish probably 4 out of 6 days there and many others do that go up for their vacations. If you are concerned about the mercury, only keep fish upriver of where the Wabigoon dumps into the English (south end of Ball Lake, above Indian Lake)"
5912754,Guest,2017-12-26 06:32:00,0,"Regarding what tackle to use, we primarily fish for walleyes in areas with current, we use jigs with crawler, leech, minnow, salted minnow or plastic. The areas we fish you would be unable to troll for walleyes because of how much the depth varies over short distances"
5913234,Namegosikaa,2017-12-26 13:19:00,61,They indeed buried mercury barrels in several spots in the area that are currently leaching into the system. A few former employees came forward over the years concerning there involvement. The current question is whether the government knew of the initial practice and the on going cover-up. Before I would eat a fish from that system I would suggest visiting Grassy Narrows First Nation to see first hand the neurologic damage suffered by hundreds of people.
5914130,Guest,2017-12-27 06:33:00,0,"There are many new clips and interviews on YouTube about it and I'm sure that if I lived there, I wouldnt eat fish as often, but there are still locals that do keep fish to eat and from my perspective, eating fish from that area while I am there (plus my 4 to take home) isnt going to be what does me in at the end. By they way, I think anyone would be hard pressed to find a fishery with more walleyes. With 3 guys in the boat and 5.5 days of fishing last summer, we had 720 walleyes, in 2016 we had 875 and 911 in 2015 (water was very low in 2017 so we couldnt access everywhere we wanted to fish)"
5904458,whitedogone,2017-12-19 19:35:00,195,I got an invite next June to this local. I guy I know has a cabin that is a 20 min. boat ride from Grassy Narrows. Anyone fish this area? What type of tackle should I plan on?
5911450,prov1800,2017-12-24 10:38:00,5010,Fishing will be great that whole system is awesome.would like to warn you that the wabigoon river flows into the English river and there is mercury through that section your talking about.you could Google it and read about it.but fishing will still be great I personally wouldn't eat any fish from there.
5911666,whitedogone,2017-12-24 15:20:00,195,I did some reading on the mercury. I can't imagine eating fish everyday for a week could be that harmful.
5911682,prov1800,2017-12-24 15:36:00,5010,I would think it might.the ontario fish eating guide days zero intake on all species.myself and a number of other people have are some over the years and no one is glowing yet.bit having are any in many years and don't plan to.iam sure you could eat a meal of very young fish.
5911850,That Minnesota guy,2017-12-24 21:36:00,8293,"Having been to lazy to do any research of my own, where does the Mercury come from?"
5911858,prov1800,2017-12-24 21:42:00,5010,Came from the mill in dryden.us they buried some mercury near the grassy area.lots going on right now.natives want some action.pretty sad those companies don't give a dam about the environment.
5911914,Pooch,2017-12-25 04:23:00,4618,"I thought the mercury had came from the processing of paper products with the waste finding it's way into the river outlet there in Dryden? I'd never heard that they had actually dumped mercury or buried it.We fished Clay lake once, then I learned about the mercury problem. Decent lake, but I'd not eat fish out of it regardless of size or age.Will the river system ever clean itself up? With mercury a heavy metal it probably is a forever thing, but maybe there is a half life to mercury processed like the mill did?Pooch"
5911946,whitedogone,2017-12-25 06:18:00,195,"That Ontario guide is way beyond my comprehension leve. I did read that 90% of the tribe there shows poisoning signs. But, it's a diet staple for them."
5911962,Skywagon,2017-12-25 06:20:00,1106,"The dumping is an allegation at this point, sad that any mercury made it's way into the Wabigoon system no matter how, but it did. The company that was responsible for releasing mercury into the system at the time no longer owns the mill. Tens of millions of dollars of Government money will be spent on this, in the end I speculate a lot will end up in Native hands and the system will still not be free of mercury."
5911994,prov1800,2017-12-25 07:04:00,5010,Don't think the system will ever be cleaned.you would think after all these years it would be laying on the bottom covered up.not sure what is coming down the river now. Very sad as clay lake is a awesome body of water that's fishable for some 22 miles of some fantastic fishing.if your not interested in eating any fish from these waters and just wanted to fish it it's hard to beat.seems the mercury has travelled a fair distance. It doesn't stop at grassy either as the wabigoon river meets the English river and then it owns into the Winnipeg river and into lake Winnipeg.got to wonder what's happening in these areas.not much being said.got to wonder about those lake Winnipeg greenbacks.
