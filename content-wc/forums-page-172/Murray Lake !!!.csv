Steady bite of 15""-18"" would be ideal. Lake have good population? Dark water or clear? Any help or info regarding lake, walleyes, accommodations, etc. would be greatly appreciated !!"

Jeff personally guided us and he didn't even charge us a fee. They go out of their way to make your stay great. We asked about summer fishing. It sounded like Murray lake was a good early season lake. I believe it is connected to Dog lake. Jeff also has boats cached on some other nearby lakes. I would call Jeff and ask him some questions. He is a straight-shooter, he will not b.s. you."

July/August usually brings a mid-day slowdown more pronounced than other months...that we understand. We hope to be able to sit on top of fish...pluck away at them with jig/minnow. I'll take numbers over size. Have good electronics to help sniff them out. Hopefully have the kind of day where you burn through 5-6 dozen minnows instead of 1 or 2 dozen.Anyone have any mid-summer info ??"
3950385,Walleye65,2015-06-09 13:43:00,9,just booked a trip for mid July. Looking forward to working a new lake...and price super reasonable. Shorter drive for us than shield country. Could still use another review if anyone has anything.
