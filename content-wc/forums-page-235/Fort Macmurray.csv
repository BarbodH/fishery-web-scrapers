4808922,zeebee,2016-05-06 02:43:00,1144,Those fellow piloting the H20 bombers and helo's are among the best intuitive flyers around. Its worse than a battle-zone as air currents are totally unpredictable. No deaths or crashes reported...total respect for that group.
4809802,pjshorthorn,2016-05-06 08:33:00,5654,"I would have to agree. We were able to watch a water bomber doing maneuvers on Red Lake while we were fishing. They gave us quite a show, while I took pictures, and then quite a drenching Met a guy in Albuquerque, NM while I was eating dinner in the hotel lounge. He was doing shots of Jack pretty quick. Turns out he was the leader of a smoke jumping crew that was working the Shiloh, AZ fire back in the early 2000 timeframe. He lost his entire crew to the fire two days earlier.........Bought him some drinks and listened to his story. I'll never forget that guy......former NSA guy jumping into fires to save others. Total respect for everyone willing to help others under dire circumstances. PjShorthorn."

4811570,alberta bum,2016-05-06 19:52:00,312,The residents that still have standing houses might be back in town by July... And if there are any hotels left I wouldn't expect to get into any of them.. They will all be booked solid with construction and essential services people. Airport will be used too shuttle in supplies and personnel for repairs and rebuilding.

I guess our jackass prime minister cracked a joke at the start of his press conference about it the other day,, real winner there!!! This may sound bad,, but I hope they find out it was started by a human,, if it was started by lightening the insurance companies will fight tooth and nail that it was an act of God.."
