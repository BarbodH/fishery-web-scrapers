We have done multiple trips with George and Joel before, but never on Rice. We have a few guys who strictly target walleye, and then a few of us that search for monster pike. Any information on walleye/pike size or tactics would be helpful. Can't seem to find much information on the lake. I used Air Ivanhoe's forum section all the time for help, but that has been down for some time now. Thanks in advance."

I think they've always targeted walleye and prefer not to mess with pike, but will ask. Seems to me they troll focusing on 8'-12' with Rat L traps and other shallow running cranks. Best bet would be to just send George an email as he hears from groups from all weeks to give you the best tips and check out the maps at the lodge before flying out."

4807258,shanny28757,2016-05-05 13:39:00,4,I've flown with Air Ivanhoe before but never to Rice Lake. George runs a great operation so I'd expect solid fishing. Try to get a lake map with depth contours. That's a good place to start.
