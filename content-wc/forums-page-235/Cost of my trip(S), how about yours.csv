4808978,Ogoki,2016-05-06 04:08:00,291,"Another VERY IMPORTANT factor to consider, the money spent on Ontario fishing trips , is money a nursing home will never get."
4809010,Baseline,2016-05-06 04:41:00,3207,"Living only 100 miles from the Minnesota / Canada border I do 5 to 7 short 4 day trips during open water season and 3 or 4 trips for ice. I can get to some excellent lakes in 3 hours. Cost for me and my fishing buddy is basically gas, bait, and some incidentals. We never count food because we would be eating a meal no matter where we were. Both of us own campers and boats so we just trade off driving and boat use. I guess if you wanted to add the cost of the capitol cost of the truck camper you could add $50 per day. The fishing trips I've taken to Alaska, Mexico, Key West, and South America is serious money. The nursing homes are going look at my bank account and throw me in the street."
4809410,port1042,2016-05-06 07:09:00,509,"Three guys, one ""up-grade"" camp boat and a housekeeping plan. We drink, both brandy and beer, but not to excess. We eat well and include fish for at least 3 meals. We stay in a motel on the trip up but not on the trip back. Last fall the total was just over $1,100.00 each. That cost includes everything including a deduction for the HST rebate. This spring the cost of licenses will have to be included so add another $65 (love the exchange rate) each. We go in both the spring and fall. Hint: I have been paying too much to cash the rebate check at my local bank. I checked with a bank in Canada and they will be happy to cash it with proper ID. I'll get Canadian dollars with no service charge. It will save me about $20.00US in services changes on a $115.00 check and we'll spend the CAN Dollars on beer, lunch, gas, bait, etc. with no concern about getting a good exchange rate."
4812418,bushead11,2016-05-07 09:09:00,151,"We travel from Madison wi to ear falls. Drive through all 12 hours. Do an outpost trip with all our own food and booze. With upgraded boats, minnows, food, gas, everything, were $900 a guy. Only thing this doesn't include is the 20 premium cigars I smoke over the week..."
4812450,HeHooksHimself,2016-05-07 09:30:00,725,"Every year I try to convince my wife (and myself) that the total cost of the trip is ""about $1000"" I also claim it is a week. Every year my wife points out that I underestimated both the cost and the time commitment, but because she is so awesome she doesn't ever make me feel guilty or make me lie or beg to go. Yes, I am a lucky guy. One of the best vacations we had was just the two of us going to my favorite camp for a week in August. I wouldn't say she has the fever like our group of guys does, but she definitely ""gets it."""
4813106,bigdaddyguns,2016-05-07 15:28:00,608,Our travels and stay are similar but we add a boat upgrade at a drive to camp. Our trips run about $850/man for a week. That price does not include any equipment or tackle additions something my wife likes to point out. I have the opposite situation bringing up my two sons but do not mind as it is worth every penny spending an entire week together with them in Canada.
4813442,3M TA3,2016-05-07 17:48:00,2846,Looks like you must paddle your boat. I did that one year trying to be thrifty. Two days later I used the oars for fire wood.
4815018,tv4fish,2016-05-08 11:18:00,2694,LOL on that one...............
4815954,NARDA 1,2016-05-08 16:15:00,636,"For us it's about $2000.00 per man for 10 days. Includes everything door to door. Hotel stay on the way up, all fuel (2 vehicles) all meals on the road, American plan, upgrade boat, upgrade cabin, booze for cabin, fishing licenses, bait etc., etc. Only things not included are each individuals bar tab and poker money. 121 days and counting."
4806722,Whopper,2016-05-05 10:29:00,340,"I've had the pleasure of spending more than a few trips with this man, and yes a week isn't enough. It's kind of neat sitting a local eatery in the Red Lake area waiting to leave on a float plane and some of the older locals greet him as if he was their neighbor."
4806786,pjshorthorn,2016-05-05 10:51:00,5654,That sums things up pretty well. PjShorthorn.
4806874,ftfarms,2016-05-05 11:24:00,444,$750. For everything even 2 cases of kokanee. 1480 mile round trip 1 night in motel.
4807042,MN_Moose,2016-05-05 12:22:00,964,Trips to Canada must be a heck of a lot cheaper than trips to the Psychologist. (I'm guessing). If I wasn't allowed to go Canada I'd be in serious bad shape.
4807066,SinOrSwim,2016-05-05 12:28:00,1528,"I have never kept track and probably never will. Not sure I want to know. This year will be year 3 with 2 trips vs 1 since I take a different trip with my kids. So, I don't want to know and I certainly don't want my wife to know."
4807130,Golden Eagle,2016-05-05 13:05:00,2642,"Agree. Or a trip to the undertaker. Going on Canada fishing trips keeps us going. It's a great carrot for this donkey. Those among us who stopped going, too soon, are the ones paying the huge price."
4807498,youngknight,2016-05-05 15:03:00,228,"It is almost certainly apples to oranges but there is a ton of value in so many northern Ontario offerings...even many fly-in camps....Quebec as well. I have browsed camps in Manitoba, Saskatachewan and northern Alberta...YIKES...great places and probably more bells, whistles...etc., but costs seem to be 2-4x as much. No doubt amazing, memories priceless but actual cost out of a family budget...euphemisms just don't cut that reality. If folks can afford it great - but northern Ontario and Quebec...**** good value."
4807986,prov1800,2016-05-05 18:09:00,5010,Id like to see a total breakdown of your trip.i live here here 40 min from lac seul 10 mim to eagle.costs me 100.00 to go for a day trip.
4808154,strength22,2016-05-05 18:57:00,49,"Wrights camp on gullrock....about 1100.00 or so for everything. Food, gas, hotels up and back....you guys know the deal. I liked it better when 400.00 to 500.00 would take ya for the week with everything."
4808514,BuckeyeBill,2016-05-05 20:46:00,76,"Our trip cost a little more because we now travel to Northwest Ontario from Ohio. In the neighborhood of 22 hour trip and at 65 I am now noticing a slow down. The fishing is much better in NW Ontario than Eastern Ontario. We tow our own boat so our fuel costs have gone up. Estimate our cost at between $800-900. Absolutely love the north woods of Ontario....beautiful, rugged country. I dream all year about sitting on my favorite lake."
4804578,vaquero01,2016-05-04 17:55:00,101,"If it is about the money you are missing the point. It is Canada, and it is 2016. Appreciate your good luck."
4804794,WalleyeMatt,2016-05-04 18:52:00,93,"Every year ( many years ) it's the same conversation. "" But honey it only will cost about $500.00"". Then the credit card bills come in and she says I see the price went up again. Can't pull anything over on her. She still says to me as we are leaving, "" Have a good time"". Got to love her. Matt"
4804842,BrianE,2016-05-04 19:04:00,98,"Great thread... I recall an article many years ago where a trapper once said ""i caught 5 bucks worth of fur but had a million dollars worth of fun"" Think about it, where can you go without seeing a soul for a few days or a week or so....the relaxation, the night filled with stars, fresh air, serenity, companionship, great fishing.......that pretty much sums it up. Even the abundance of mosquitoes cannot let you down. Got to pay to play."
4804882,Smallmouth Hunter,2016-05-04 19:10:00,84,"My first year was 1990 and it cost about $450.00, this year it will be in the $1250 range. We stay at a much nicer camp and have way better equipment and location. Plus it's 27 years later so the price has gone up over time. We drive from Indiana and stay at a boat in camp on LOTW. The $1250.00 is doorstep to doorstep and back. Worth every penny! 35 days and counting!"
4805218,dukntz,2016-05-04 20:38:00,11,"We camp on Crown Land for a week. Cost $425 person last year. I agree, would be nice occasionally to have a hard roof over our heads, especially when the thunder rolls. But, nothing beats bring serenaded to sleep by the loons and rolling out of the sleeping bag in the morning, getting the fire started for coffee, and walking 30 yards to shore and catching a walleye for breakfast!"
4805498,Pooch,2016-05-05 05:11:00,4619,"When I started fishing Canada we did fly in camps and we always do a week plus two days travel for well under $1000 total each guy, easy. Not cheap back then. In reality prices have not gone up all that much considering that was quite some time ago.If there is any transportation involved by the camp operators the cost has to go up. We now figure that we can fish a drive to camp for less than half (Even one third) of a fly in or trail in camp. It's not quite the same experience, but still quite pleasant and if you have to leave for any reason you can at any time.I love the remote experience, but it's just going to cost more and it is justified.I tried to stop keeping track of trip costs years ago, but your brain is still doing the math whether you want it to or not.Hoping Mrs. Pooch isn't either........ OP should nuke this thread in case our wives find it.Pooch"
4805594,Golden Eagle,2016-05-05 06:04:00,2642,"Back in 1960 my wife and I spent a bit under $300 for a trip from SW Ohio to the Chapleau area. We drove a bugeye Sprite, getting nearly 40 mpg on the highway with $.32 per gallon gas. We were gone from home for 49 days, sleeping on the ground all but 2 days, 1 in a commercial fisherman's (Harry Birch) house and 1 in the work shop of carpenter, Fred Gjos in Desbarats. We ran across a lot of free campgrounds and never spent over a dollar to camp or $2 to rent a boat for a day. We hauled our own 7 1/2 HP OB.For the next few years we'd put 4 guys in a car and fish for 7 - 10 days for $200. Total of $200 for four guys. We traveled new roads, camped almost wherever we liked, carried boats and motors to fish new water. We ate a lot of pike, perch, brook trout and a few walleyes.Improved fishing success came to me in 1972 when I took a float plane ride to a lake in NW Ontario. My dues were current. Going where the fish are is rewarding. I haven't been cheated."
4805722,pjshorthorn,2016-05-05 06:51:00,5654,I'm pretty sure I would enjoy sitting around a campfire with you listening to all your stories from past trips. A week may not be long enough. PjShorthorn.
4806314,tv4fish,2016-05-05 08:52:00,2694,Yup ----- Like THEY say ---------priceless...
4806570,bigwalleye1,2016-05-05 09:55:00,2632,Price is what you pay....VALUE is what you get. The value of life experiences have no price tag.
4802922,Thompmd,2016-05-04 10:35:00,320,"Looks like we are going in July of this year and to a new resort so the numbers are not apples/apples but I thought others might find this interesting? They are for the same resort and I went with my father and we split everything equally so double the numbers to get full cost. The cost includes everything from my garage to my garage. We always stayed a week, housekeeping plan, brought our own boat and we always stayed in a hotel for 1-night on the way up. Same Lodge: 2004 $923ea 2005 $965 2006 $1,050 2007 $1,040 2008 $1,000 2012 $1,170 New Lodge 2016 looks like $1,600ea at a new lodge which is nicer and we are staying on their cabin on a private island and its a 3bdrm vs a 2bdrm."
4803106,bthomas3333,2016-05-04 11:27:00,465,This is a dangerous post. If my wife ever got ahold of this data I could find my self in serious hot water. Let's put it this way. There are fishing trips to Canada that can cost $5-10k for a week and other places that can cost $1000. I tend to stay on the lower side of those numbers. LOL
4803114,martinbns,2016-05-04 11:27:00,1520,Probably the exchange is the reason.
4803138,camp chef,2016-05-04 11:41:00,915,I have records going back 25 years but quit adding up all the incidentals a few years back. This year like last year 4 of us will boat into Canada for 7 days and stay a night on the way up. Eat and drink like Kings and go portal to portal for between $800 and $900 each.
4803434,Whopper,2016-05-04 13:16:00,340,My trip in about two weeks will cost me about 25 hours of my spare time doing work for people. Hopefully I will make two other trips this year on money that's never even see's the family budget :-)
4803762,bullhockey,2016-05-04 14:18:00,41,I can remember my first trip to Ont. 52 yrs ago. Fly in was a little under $100. Believe it or not. Flew out of Hawk Junction to anaria lake. This year my five kids and I are going to White River and the cost is $1295.00 with most all the amenities that come with a fly in. That first trip was in tents.
4803898,adempsey,2016-05-04 14:36:00,963,"I've kept track of the rates for most Ontario fly-in outfitters over the past few years. Most have not change their rates at all during that time. Some raised the rates 2-4%, which is probably in line with inflation, but some have dropped their rates. Generally though, not much change overall. Not sure if lodges would follow the same pattern."
4804210,jkaup,2016-05-04 16:05:00,56,"I think we started going 8 years ago, every other year. Was about $1300 the first and now its up to $1500. That is 7 nights on the lake, only cabin on the lake. We have a hotel night going and coming. Our total door to door runs $2800 each."
4804538,Guest,2016-05-04 17:50:00,0,We stay at Gold Pines in Ear Falls (Lac Seul) the first week in June every year and bring our own boat and food. Total cost for the week is about $750 (not counting secret lures).
4804546,drlee,2016-05-04 17:51:00,409,"Annual sport license: $83 Gas, two round trips: 3200 miles, 16 mpg (I tow my own boat) 200 gallons @ $2.25 (est.) per gal. = $450. Cabin Rental: $330 at one camp, $420 at one camp. Two weeks @ $330 and one week @ $420 = $1080 + tax = $1220. Bait: leeches, salt minnows, crawlers, about $65. Food and Drink: I would eat and drink at home, so its a wash. Miscellaneous: About $200. So, roughly $2000 for 3 weeks, or $667 per week or $100 per day. Tell me where you can vacation for less...or, if I get to worrying about it, I recall that I have spent $2000 on a lot of really stupid things over my life time."
