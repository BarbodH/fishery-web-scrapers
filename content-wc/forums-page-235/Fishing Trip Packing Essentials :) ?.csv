4812314,Mike Borger,2016-05-07 08:35:00,1554,"Certain things are obvious, others not so much. Here are a dozen things I always bring on a fly in that might not be as obvious.1. Paper plates (saves washing dishes and weighs very little)2. Baby wipes (an essential item when crapping in the woods )3. Can of indoor Raid (spray cabin 10 mins before bed, far better than burning mosquito coils all night and breathing that stuff in)4. Delorme inReach satellite communication device (size of a hand held gps, can send and receive emails and texts anywhere off the grid)5. Compact MSR water pump used in conjunction with 1L Nalgene bottles.(pumps clean, tannin free drinking water from the lake. Essential when weight is at a premium)6. Waterproof bluetooth speakers and my iphone loaded with music. 7. Hand held gps with correct topo map chip installed (for larger bodies of water)8. A giant sponge for the boat9. Spark plug wrench and sandpaper10. Can of Seafoam. 2 stroke motors can often run rough when idling or trolling. Run some of this through the engine and it works wonders. It's saved more than one trip for me.11. Bed Sheets. The camp mattresses are often gross. 12. A large coffee press and a good supply of fresh ground high quality beans. (I take my coffee drinking seriously )"
4812426,HeHooksHimself,2016-05-07 09:13:00,725,"@PJShorthorn. Those seem to be only essentials when staying with VBay Gord from what you told me last year. And you don't even have to pay extra! @Mike Borger. This has been posted before, but it is a classic re: baby wipes. Enjoy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10lLPlhmytc Hooks"

4814258,pjshorthorn,2016-05-08 05:58:00,5654,"I was out fishing with Gord last year and being that he is a fair skinned fella, he started to burn. I tossed him the Preparation H and told him it was sunblock. Surprisingly , Gord shrank to the size of a Munchkin and wasn't such a PITA the rest of the day. I'll be adding Mike's suggestion to my list. I'm tired of cracking another $100 bill for the week to use the coin operated washroom in the cabin. Off to the woods we go !!!!!! PjShorthorn."
