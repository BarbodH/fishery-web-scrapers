Put your phone in airplane mode, turn on wi fi and use the app. Then there are no unwanted or "" hidden "" charges. You can use the wi fi for calling and texting and the money you spend on the wi fi is the only money you will be out of pocket. Simple and easy."
4792314,jkwildhunting,2016-05-01 14:57:00,361,"This! I use ""WHATSAPP "" as long as person you want to contact has the app at home you are set if you have wifi signal. I used it last year in camp south of red lake and at the motel in Dryden. I text people daily here on whatsapp but when I am north and have wifi I called and text with zero issues"
4813418,3M TA3,2016-05-07 17:35:00,2846,"Yep. For those that have it WHATSAPP is pretty good. If I remember right, HDL will let you use their phone to call US. LIke 6 minutes for a buck I think."
4783066,Sportdog,2016-04-28 16:17:00,6735,I'm four weeks away from a two week stay at Happy Day Lodge on Windamere Lake near Chapleau Ontario. Can anyone tell me if buying Canadian phone service for the time I spend there would be worth it due to signal strength. I am a Verizon customer and am not really sure how this works. Any enlightenment will be much appreciated. Thank You.
4783450,Slushfish,2016-04-28 17:58:00,263,"Verizon offers a Canadian coverage add on. Very easy to do. We do it every year. It's 10 or 15 bucks for a hundred minutes or something of that nature. We don't use the phone much though. If I remember right, you can tell them the dates you want or you can just cancel when you get home. We go to LOTW for two weeks. If you make more than a couple calls at $2/min. it will pay for itself."
4783530,Golden Eagle,2016-04-28 18:19:00,2642,Internet service is available at Happy Day Lodge. Or check with Bob Zimmerman for information about cell phone service.
4783962,nitroman,2016-04-28 20:46:00,368,Cell phones are not allowed in Canada! At least not in my boat anyway! I go there to get away from them but we did have a couple guys do the add on Canada minutes last year so they could call the wife. Cost them like 10 bucks for some minutes i think.
4784082,Sportdog,2016-04-28 22:07:00,6735,Received email from the lodge owners. They have Wifi available for 20 dollars a week per cabin or you can go by the store and get service. Cell phone coverage is said to be spotty depending on phone and plan. Prompt reply from these owners for sure. Thanks to those who responded to my thread. (With one exception.....)
4784098,martinbns,2016-04-28 22:10:00,1520,Chapleau is pretty close to the middle of nowhere. I suspect in that part of Northern Ontario it would be really spotty at best. Best to just get a roaming package from Verizon.
4786266,quickster2,2016-04-29 16:04:00,41,"Cell phone service is spotty at best with ATT, Verizon, & Sprint in my party last two years. You can just walk to the lodge and get service by their antenna."
4786282,pjshorthorn,2016-04-29 16:18:00,5654,This !!!! I added the extra plan minutes to my phone so Gramps could call home and check on his wife each evening as she is not in the best of health. We will do the same again this year. If he uses over 100 minutes than we know he has met a Canadian gal who doesn't mind baiting her own hook along with his PjShorthorn.
4789450,bus33,2016-04-30 17:51:00,289,"I'm also a Verizon customer and checked into this last week. Verizon has a coverage map for Canada. We fish out of Ear Falls and there is LTE coverage. You can add a travel package that goes day to day. For $2 per day you can use your regular minutes, texts, and data as if you were in the US. I signed up on line to start the day I crossed the border."
4789626,martinbns,2016-04-30 18:43:00,1520,I am in Grand Forks over the weekend and the same service in reverse costs me $7 a day. We pay too much for cell service in Canada.
