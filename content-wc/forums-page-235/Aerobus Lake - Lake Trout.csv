Best color pattern on Aerobus2. Best size / weight for getting down deep. (Since I will be fishing mid summer, I imagine the lakers will be down pretty deep at that time of the year)Any information regarding best colar patterns and weight on the blade baits is much appreciated.Thanks!jackpotjohnny48"

4816554,adempsey,2016-05-08 20:43:00,963,"You can troll using a three way set up or a clip on weight. Both work fine. In the summer I use 5 or 6 oz. of weight to get down to ~50-60 FOW with 100 feet of line out. You can troll a spoon or a minnow bait like a floating Rapala or X-Rap.If you jig, I'd suggest a white tube jig or a paddletail swimbait. Typical ice fishing jigs are fine too - Swedish Pimple, Krocodile, Kastmaster. Whatever you use, something 1-1.5oz. is ideal to get your lure down to the bottom and keep it vertical. Unless of you can anchor of course."

You can find them online with a Google search. - Blue/silver, black/silver, a bit of green have been the stickbait colors working best for me one Aerobus, but it pays to try some crazy, off beat colors, too. My best blade bait for lakers is a hand painted red and white ugly looking thing.Good luck. I love getting back to Aerobus for lakers and try to do it one day each year early in the season. Post a report when you get back."
