4751370,Bstar,2016-04-19 11:18:00,564,My wife and I stayed at the Four Winds in 2013. We found it to be a nice clean hotel and we were glad we stayed there. It's not a bad drive to Nakina from there either. FYI- there is a small pizza place across the parking lot from the hotel and it has a bar in the basement. We had a good time with some of the locals there. Let's just say the flight in the next morning was a little foggy! Go to Tripadvisor.com and do a search of Longlac hotels. Four Winds is still getting some good reviews.
