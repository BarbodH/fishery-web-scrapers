4814354,Mike Borger,2016-05-08 06:40:00,1554,Sure Pat I'll get right on that! How about a heart shaped vibrating bed to go along with it? Just so you feel right at home.
4815146,pjshorthorn,2016-05-08 12:03:00,5654,Now that you mention it.......why not? The large heart size would work best . PjShorthorn.
4818258,Mike Borger,2016-05-09 10:50:00,1554,Talked to Martin and he's buying a screen tent to leave at the Ribes cabin. So you guys that are going don't need to worry about it!

4792250,canufish,2016-05-01 14:19:00,16,Sorry Abbey Lake is the log cabin and yes Mike your garden shed is probably Bigger than the camp at Ribes I guess I was having an old timers moment.
4794490,pike50plus,2016-05-02 08:33:00,584,I think Hugh Kuttner built the original log cabin when Pellows owned the rights to the lake.
4805514,Ruddiger,2016-05-05 05:32:00,649,"Howdy, Man I remember Hugh and that HEAVY German/Austrian accent from my first few years of fly-ins. That was back in the days of no money, driving all night to avoid paying for a hotel, and finding hidden gems to fly-in to on a tight budget. Terrible accommodations, good fishing and great memories. Take care, Ruddiger"
4811770,fooch5040,2016-05-06 21:18:00,5,"Bulldozer - we arrived in sunshine, it rained for the next four day and was cold. We had a ton of fun, but the fishing was tough. The biggest pike was 27"" biggest walleye 22"". Would say the biggest difference from Mcleister was we caught way more walleye. On Mcleister it was maybe 9 pike to 1 walleye. Bulldozer would be 7 walleye to 3 pike. At some points we had no idea if the rain was coming down or going up. Really liked both outfitters Hearst Air and White River Air, just want to try something new with Air Dale. As a kid my dad took me on a few fly ins, one was to Smudge Lake. Anyone been there. We called the hill to the cottage cardiac hill. Fooch"
4812050,Mike Borger,2016-05-07 05:57:00,1554,Smudge rings a bell. Is it a bass lake and not very far north?
4812210,Wallbanger1957,2016-05-07 07:41:00,5,"Fooch, I will be going to Ribes Lake for the first time July 23-30. I've been in contact with Mike B. also. I'll see you at the dock I assume , I can give you a first hand report. Jim"
4813570,fooch5040,2016-05-07 18:25:00,5,"Yeah, Smudge is not that far north, although when your 14 it seemed like it was way north. I believe it is north of Kawartha lakes and was a bass lake. Rumor was the outfitter were pilots and stocked the lake before they got the rights to it. The bass fishing was incredible to say the least. Not sure what happened to the outfitter or if people even fish it or have access to it."
4813578,fooch5040,2016-05-07 18:30:00,5,"Very cool Jim. Would be great to get some first hand intel of the lake from the previous week. We are contemplating bringing a light weight screen house, similar to what I've seen from Mike's pictures. Are you bringing up one? P.S. if you want to save weight on the way back you can leave any extra beer!"
4813938,Wallbanger1957,2016-05-07 22:03:00,5,"Fooch, Thought about a tent but bug spray is cheaper! And lighter! Always have trouble making 100lbs limit. As far as the beer goes I'm afraid your out of luck , I don't drink beer and my cousin has been successful in finishing his case of beer for the week so far on our fishing trips. We'll try to leave a few walleye for you to catch!! See ya in July Jim"
4814194,Mike Borger,2016-05-08 05:32:00,1554,"Yes! Thanks for refreshing my memory. Pretty sure I camped on that lake about 30 years ago.Quote: Originally Posted by fooch5040Very cool Jim.

You can't really relax inside the cabin, there's no room!Leave this with me guys. I'm going to suggest to Martin that he buy one for his guests and leave it at the cabin when he opens things up this spring."
4780778,fooch5040,2016-04-27 19:39:00,5,"Hi Everyone. First time poster, but long time reader. Looking for advice for a upcoming trip to Ribes Lake with Air Dale. There are three of us going for five days leaving July 30th. Any help would be appreciated. We have been on two previous fly ins. The first was with Hearst Air to Mcleister Lake and last year to Bulldozer Lake with White River Air. Both are first class operations. If anyone needs any advice with these lakes, let me know. We booked all three trips with help from Mike Borger..of course! Thanks guys, Fooch"
4781130,youngknight,2016-04-28 01:18:00,228,Can't help you with Ribes Lake but almost went to Bulldozer Lake last year. Would love to read about your trip there..both for walleye and pike....and the camp.
4781138,Mike Borger,2016-04-28 02:11:00,1554,"Email me at [email protected], I can help."
4781146,Mike Borger,2016-04-28 02:12:00,1554,"I have lots of intel on a bunch of WRA's camps, but not Bulldozer, would love to hear about it myself."
4787082,canufish,2016-04-30 05:24:00,16,My brother and I fished Ribes lake 3 years ago in September and had a great week no shortage of walleye and a nice camp get a hold of Mike he will give you all the info you are looking for on this lake. Cheers Mitch
4787210,Mike Borger,2016-04-30 05:46:00,1554,"Hey Mitch, the cabin is smaller than my garden shed. Awesome little lake though, one of my favorites."
4789394,canufish,2016-04-30 17:40:00,16,Yes Mike it is a little on the small side but a quaint little log cabin it is.

4791682,polaris-pete,2016-05-01 11:45:00,343,The cabin on Ribes is not a log cabin. RickOnt just posted the pic of the tiny 2 man cabin on Ribes. Seems they would refurb this cabin into something better considering the fishing here.Could not imagine putting more than 2 in here.
4791754,Mike Borger,2016-05-01 11:56:00,1554,"Maybe one day Pete, at least that's the word on the street. Maybe better if they don't though, that way it won't become popular. Here's a video tour of the camphttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCB865QiUvs"
