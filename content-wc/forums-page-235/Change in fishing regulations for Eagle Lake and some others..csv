4800570,Skywagon,2016-05-03 17:30:00,1106,"I agree and would like to see them institute that fish must be killed like Lac Seul, that and no netting would be a great thing to help bring the system back to life."
4800602,prov1800,2016-05-03 17:40:00,5010,Theres nothing wrong with the system.its alive and well.i get to fish around 60 days per season and the fishing is awesome.not quit the average size of lac seul but close. The big fish on eagle are there but definatly dont bite till evening.but would likecto see the keep and kill also.not a fan of culling fish.
4801674,Skywagon,2016-05-04 05:37:00,1106,"I was referring to the Wabigoon system, not Eagle. Eagle is a great fishery! sorry for the confusion."
4801690,prov1800,2016-05-04 05:42:00,5010,"No problem, iam always confused."
4798730,NARDA 1,2016-05-03 09:38:00,636,I was checking the regulations for Eagle Lake and found that the size limit for Northern Pike appears to have changed for Eagle and a few other lakes. It appears that the slot limit has been eliminated and a maximum size of 29.5 inches has been implemented.http://files.ontario.ca/environment-..._5_English.pdf
4798962,prov1800,2016-05-03 10:17:00,5010,Its about time.unfortunatly the nets arent under those rules.
4799018,prov1800,2016-05-03 10:27:00,5010,"I find the regulations confusing.one page says:none greater than 29.5"".than you get to thecexception page and it says none between 27.6""-35.4"".i can see how some fisherman keep fish they think they can."
4799090,Jesse-WI,2016-05-03 10:46:00,534,Listed exceptions always override. There use to be a closed Pike season from mid April to mid May. That rule was removed. The size restrictions in exception area still override the base zone rules.
4799122,camp chef,2016-05-03 10:58:00,915,Excellent!!!
4799154,prov1800,2016-05-03 11:13:00,5010,Well you go to the exceptions for eagle lake and read the norther pike part and you would be getting a ticket to.unless iam already to confused.that or eagle still has the slot on pike and every other lake in zone 5 doesnt.not usually to concerned about pike anyways.i dont keep them myself.
4799346,NARDA 1,2016-05-03 11:58:00,636,"If you look at the very bottom of the Eagle Lake exceptions area in red print it states that "" Northern Pike season is now same as Zone 5"". At the bottom of Wabigoon's it states ""Northern Pike limits are now same as Zone 5"". I would think that the Eagle Lake statement is a typo and should read the same as Wabigoon's, but there I go thinking again."
4799458,prov1800,2016-05-03 12:14:00,5010,So basically nothing has changed.mnr (ministry of no results)
4799538,NARDA 1,2016-05-03 12:28:00,636,I just got off the phone with the Ontario MNR. They stated that the change to Eagle Lake is that the SEASON has been changed to be OPEN ALL YEAR where previously there was a closed season. The slot limit is still in place with no change on Eagle Lake. Wabigoon and Dinorwic's WALLEYE AND NORTHERN PIKE SIZE LIMITS HAVE CHANGED.
4799594,prov1800,2016-05-03 12:40:00,5010,"Ok i see the walleyes on the goon have the same slot now as eagle.should just make it 4 ubder 18"" everywhere.nobody needs to keep anything bigger. Should be interesting with the walleye tournament if you have to throw back a 22"" fish.lol."
