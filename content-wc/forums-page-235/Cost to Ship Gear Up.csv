4819434,elway12,2016-05-09 17:56:00,335,"Thank you for the detailed info. I too always worry about them measuring, charging etc. I have done it 6 RT trips from PHX to MSP on SWA with no issues - But it only takes one bozo. I always carry a copy of the attached SWA checked bag regs. It's not worth my extra time and money to ship it especially coming back home when we are really strapped for time. https://www.southwest.com/html/custo...ggage-pol.html"
4820018,kayakmatt,2016-05-09 20:22:00,105,"Yeah, I was fed up up with the hassles and expenses with the rod tube on the flights, so I started accumulating decent quality two piece rods (up to 7'). I put 5 rods in a 5"" dia cardboard poster or document tube, and carry it on with no issues. I even mounted a plastic handle on the tube. It rolls right to the back of an overhead compartment, so it is in no ones way. Never have been questioned (yet). The tube looks like it holds important documents or blueprints! Saved enough in bag fees to pay for most the $100+ 2 pc rods."

4823018,gamatt53,2016-05-10 14:54:00,4,According to the southwest policy for fishing rods the Bazooka case would have too large of a diameter which is what got me in trouble. There is a fedex location right near the airport that you can ship and hold to then swing by on the way home before dropping off the car rental. Only adds a few extra minutes. Cost for the bazooka has been anywhere from 40 bucks to 60 bucks to ship it one way. Wayyyyy less than the oversize bag fees for the airlines. The two piece rod could certainly be a cost save over the long term I would just prefer to take my quality one piece rods that I use at home and know exactly how they will perform.
4810114,gamatt53,2016-05-06 09:53:00,4,Long time reader first time poster! We usually fly into Minneapolis and drive up from there. Curious what others are paying to ship rod tubs? I use a Flambeau Bazooka tube and the prices to ship have been all over the board for that thing in years past. Fedex ground seems to be the cheapest but the quoted rate is never same same. I used to check it on the airline with no trouble but they started trying to charge oversize fees on it depending on who was working the counter. Also thinking about this year shipping a Yeti cooler stuffed with gear but afraid it may be crazy expensive. Anyone shipped a cooler or tried checking it on a plane? What were your experiences? Tired of buying coolers and leaving at the resorts. Kinda have to have one so meat/perishables don't spoil on the drive up and first night before getting to the cabin. Thanks!
4810522,Mike Borger,2016-05-06 11:53:00,1554,"I fly all over the place with gear and large rod tubes within Canada usually with Westjet. It's usually an extra $25 for the 8' Bazooka rod tube. We always check two collapsible soft coolers made by Coleman filled with fishing tackle including trays with all of our lures. These are the coolers I use: http://www.colemancanada.ca/product/...9#.VyzYVj_XKi4When we get to where we're going we transfer all the tackle to our empty tackle bags which are stuffed in our duffles then use the two empty coolers for our perishable foods. (We shop for food then typically rent a vehicle to get to the jump off point where we fly in).As far as carry on stuff, I have the obvious largest sized piece of luggage usually filled with clothes. What most people don't realize (at least the airline I use) you can also carry on a personal bag as well as camera gear. So I also have a fairly large soft cooler with a shoulder strap filled with reels and other electronics as well as my pelican case with my good camera.I'm like a pack mule boarding the planes, everyone hates me LOL!Large carry on goes in the overhead bin. Soft cooler and pelican case gets jammed underneath the seat."
4810546,camp chef,2016-05-06 12:01:00,915,I like the way you roll.
4810762,Mike Borger,2016-05-06 13:26:00,1554,Unless you're stuck right behind me when I'm trying to board the plane.
4811274,elway12,2016-05-06 17:39:00,335,"One of our checked bags is a ""regular"" sized igloo cooler filled with dry foods and equipment. As long as the cooler is no bigger & under 50lbs. than the allowable checked bag size of the airline it will be good to go. We also check our Bazooka rod tube. We fly on Southwest and they have never given us a problem. They allow for the length of the tube and allow 3in diameter...crossing fingers they have never measured that!"
4811394,Mike Borger,2016-05-06 18:43:00,1554,"Westjet is really great in a lot of ways, but ANY cooler that is checked with them is considered oversized no matter what the size. We bite the bullet and pay the fees usually split 4 ways. It never amounts to more than say $60 total P/P for the round trip. Not a huge deal in the grand scheme of things."
4813514,gamatt53,2016-05-07 18:11:00,4,Thanks for the response Mike. I like that collapsible cooler idea. I see that Kelty also makes something similar. May very well be the best way to go for those of us who fly up north. Here is the Kelty one https://kelty.com/folding-cooler/Quote: We also check our Bazooka rod tube. We fly on Southwest and they have never given us a problem. They allow for the length of the tube and allow 3in diameter...crossing fingers they have never measured that! I nearly missed a flight home when a Southwest agent in MSP broke out the tape measure on my Bazooka. Was refusing to check it and trying to send me to some area for special luggage. Got semi heated and called for a manager who eventually cleared it but we were minutes from missing the flight home. You are gambling not shipping it FYI. Just really depends on the agent you are checking it with. Fedex ground was 60 on the way up last time from North Carolina and 40 on the way home. Seems to be no rhyme or reason to the costs but at least I know it will be there when I fly in.
4813626,elway12,2016-05-07 19:00:00,335,Were they checking the Length or the Diameter? SWA luggage rules say it can be a max. 91 inches. We have some 7 ft poles so my rod tube is at 88in. Thanks for the info. We also pack a soft cooler and expand it when we pick up provisions when we land.
4818978,gamatt53,2016-05-09 15:07:00,4,Checked both - diameter was way over as they checked around the part with the handle grip. I don't risk it anymore. They nearly made me take it to cargo shipping if I recall until a manager relented as it is way over even their oversize baggage size if you measure it L+W+H. As I said I had done it a few times with no trouble before that but it just takes one person to follow the rules and your are done for. You are gambling trying to check the Bazooka tube on any commercial airline in the US in my opinion. I haven't found one whose policy would allow it without an oversize charge or not at all. I refuse to not have my good one piece rods up there so I ship them.
4819322,Mike Borger,2016-05-09 16:44:00,1554,Pretty sure every major airline in the States will ship a large rod tube. Yes you will be charged a fee for oversized baggage - it's oversized. The question is how much is the oversized fee? I can't believe it would cost more than having an 8' tube shipped fedex.
