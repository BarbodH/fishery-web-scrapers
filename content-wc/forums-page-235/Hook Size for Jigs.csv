4788954,bthomas3333,2016-04-30 15:34:00,465,I have been following the favorite jig thread. Pretty cool to see all the different style of jigs favored by different guys / bodies of water. I guess in the same vein but a bit different. If you could custom make jigs would you favor larger hooks relative to the weight or smaller and if you were fishing for larger fish would you go larger hooks? I was thinking about placing an order with Slevad of custom made jigs to fish for larger walleyes and wondered if I should ask them to upsize the hooks? I've noticed in the past that smaller hooks on larger fish isn't a great combo but wondered what everyone else thought. Thanks! B-
4789490,WiGuy,2016-04-30 18:06:00,4,I got into pouring jigs about ten years ago so that I could use larger hooks. I have about 5 molds now and everyone takes a hook one size larger then what it was first made for in the 1/4 ounce size. I like to thread the minnow on and the extra gap helps when the minnows get larger. I am using a 2/0 hook on my 1/4 ounce jigs.
4789770,kzoofisher,2016-04-30 19:31:00,5144,"I like larger hooks with plastics, not just the larger gap getting the point exposed but also the longer shank putting the point further back. I don't know that a bigger hook is needed for bigger fish, just with bigger baits. The most common hooks on molds take Aberdeen or O'Shaughnessy though many specialty heads take specialty hooks or angles. Aberdeen's are usually a longer shank than O'Shaughnessy's and lighter wire which damages plastics or bait less but is not quite as strong. I have never had a walleye straighten a hook and don't worry about it. Most molds will accept hooks above and below the rated size but not by a lot. Some are designed for larger hooks, usually jigs that are designed for larger plastics, e.g. shad heads run bigger than ball heads. You can see what size hooks go with what style of jig on the Do-It site. Do you want to swim jigs, hop them on the bottom, drag them? I would ask Slevad what range of hooks they have in what styles of heads and get a variety for the kind of fishing you are looking at. There are other places to get custom jigs too and I think some regulars here can help you with that."

One of the reasons is that I can select hooks to customize the jigs for a particular application. Like the previous posts, I often upsize the hook size, most often one hook size than what the mold recommends. I often change hook style to lengthen/shorten the hook shaft. Most of my walleye fishing is with 1/16 ounce live bait jigs with size #2 short shank Eagle Claw hooks. These just get the job done for me, day in and day out. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4793098,Bill Krejca,2016-05-01 19:12:00,6107,"I pour most of my jig heads. Many times I will use a larger hook than what is embossed on the mold. Especially with plastics, I've found that I may miss some hits unless the hook gap is bigger than on that of the size which is called for. In most cases, the suggested size on the mold can be thought of as just a suggestion. If need be, I have increased the diameter of the eye space on the mold, the simplest for me is to just use a drill press, for more accurate positioning. The drill depth of the bit can be easily regulated, without creating a hole in the mold. Sometimes, I will mold using a smaller hook size. I may want a less visible hook, or one less likely to tangle the bait, but still have the need for easier to obtain depth. Some manufacturers are starting to offer larger hook sizes in the lighter weights, but few seem to offer heavy weights without a ridiculously large hook. When you pour your own, any size within reason can be made. Bill"
4793370,bthomas3333,2016-05-01 20:37:00,465,"Thanks for all the great feedback. You guys pretty much confirm what I saw a few times last year. Despite smashing down the barb I found a few larger walleyes hooked near the lips and the gap was too small to go all the way thru the lips of the fish. This is really not a great hook set. Makes for a few nervous minutes when you lift a big fish and see the jig in the mouth of the fish but the hook does come all the way thru. I am def going to go with the biggest hooks I can order. Thanks,B-"
4801146,halfmoon007,2016-05-03 20:15:00,121,"I order all the jigs for our party of 6 fly ins to a Nakina lake and we all prefer #1 hook on 1/8 oz jigs and 1/0 on 1/4 and 3/8 oz jigs. we all use 3"" plastics. We all seem to like this combination. I buy all powder painted jigs from a great source. Crawdadsfishingtackle.com . This young fellow will make any thing you want. about 4 different brand hooks to choose from. any size . Never paint in the hook eye. His paint holds up great in the Canadian bed rock. He is out of Cadillac Michigan, I prefer to call my order in to him so we get exactly what we want . He has a very high quality jig at great prices. Halfmoon"
