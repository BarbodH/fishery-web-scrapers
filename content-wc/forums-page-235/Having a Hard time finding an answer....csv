4794434,OffCourse,2016-05-02 08:21:00,17,"I didn't say I wouldn't follow them. But, to me when I'm talking common sense there is a difference between taking bait across for a week and what you are fishing with on a particular afternoon. I understand the regulations are what they are. And, they make sense. I think the having a beer in the boat rule is dumb too, but I follow it."
4794962,Fisher-man,2016-05-02 10:30:00,422,"So, if you are staying in the NW Angle area, and you are going to fish the Canadian waters, is there a place to buy bait up there? I was just curious, because I fish plastics and catch as many fish as anyone else using live bait. Gulp Leeches, and Gulp Minnows are deadly."
4795082,CI_Guy,2016-05-02 11:01:00,2118,"Since there are laws against it, it seems to fit the definition: Smuggling is the illegal transportation of objects, substances, information or people, such as out of a house or buildings, into a prison, or across an international border, in violation of applicable laws or other regulations."
4795362,OffCourse,2016-05-02 12:47:00,17,"Yeah, I get it. By the letter of the law it is correct probably. I'm talking COMMON SENSE. What happens if someone finds a hump that is half on the US side and half on the Canada side? Can you only troll one half of it? Is there even a way to know?????? Or, do you ""smuggle"" bait back and forth hundreds of times? Probably get 5 to 10 years for smuggling that many times over the border."
4804946,muskyman73,2016-05-04 19:23:00,402,"Get gulp minnows, and trigger X minnows. And watermelon red flake 3 inch grubs. Our group has not bought live bait since before the internet came about ! No joke either, I am serious. LOTW, you never need live bait for walleye !"
4805490,Baseline,2016-05-05 05:10:00,3207,"I fishing Rainy Lake on a regular basis. Sometimes I stay in Canada and buy Canadian minnows and carry the receipt with me. Sometimes we have to leave Canada travel through the US to get to another area of Canadian waters. In addition I sometimes stop and fish some spots in US waters. Over the years I've been checked by both the US and CA CO's. They have never been to worried about my minnows. One time the CA CO asked about the receipt, but I was 20 miles into Rainy's North Arm in Canadian waters. As an antidote to my bait stories.........I was crossing the border from the US to Canada at Pigeon River. I was asked about crawlers and I told them they were packed in paper, which they were. The CA Customs guy told me to pull in and have my crawlers inspected. He looked at them and sure enough they were packed in paper, but he found a couple black specks which he said was dirt and would not allow me to transport them in to Canada. I had to return to the US, dump them in the garbage and return to CA. What I thought was funny that marked clearly on the top of the three cartons of crawlers were the words ""PRODUCT OF CANADA""."
4791722,Obabikon,2016-05-01 11:52:00,2370,"It isn't silliness. The point is to prevent species from making their way into other lakes. The fine will be at least 4 digits if you get caught with fake receipts. THAT would be stupid... incredibly silly to risk thousands of dollars, just to save a couple bucks in bait?"
4792258,picollen,2016-05-01 14:24:00,208,"Fake receipts? Not sure where you're getting that from? I could easily purchase leeches in the morning in Canada and the United States and have two receipts. I could even keep the leeches separate in two leech tamer bags and then fish the U.S. leeches in the U.S. and the Canada leeches in Canada. This entire debate simply illustrates the need for discretion. I get the ""rules are the rules"" crowd but I'm not going to find some dude a thousand bucks who crossed some imaginary line while on a boat and might have a u.s. leech on his hook vs. a canadian leech. Which by the way ARE THE SAME KIND OF LEECH on the same body of water. So my point is, the reason for the law is to stop the transport of foreign/invasive species from one lake to another. Just like taking the weeds off your trailer. In this case, since it's one body of water you are not keeping any invasive species out of the water, therefore the need for discretion. Check my live well, check my license but unless you want to get laughed at don't try and explain to me how you're helping the habitat by citing me for buying canadian leeches and fishing them in the same body of water. It's just DUMB."
4792618,Nimstug,2016-05-01 16:56:00,2605,"The reference to ""fake receipts"" come directly from the regulations. So now that you have the clarification you were looking for, the choices seem to be: A. Follow the regulations on boundary sharing waters. B. Fish on water entirely on one side of the border or the other. C. Choose to ignore the regulations and possibly discuss logic and how smart a foreign countrys laws are with a conservation officer on the water."
4792818,Obabikon,2016-05-01 17:47:00,2370,"Yes... using a receipt to indicate you purchased bait somewhere that you actually didn't (which is what I understood you were suggesting) is illegal. Having one receipt for Canada and one receipt for the US... and claiming you purchased bait at whichever the officer asks... is breaking a law. Would you get caught? Maybe not. If you had two jugs of bait, that you purchased from both countries to ""keep them apart""... you already broke the law by crossing the border with live bait. Laws are not ""judgement"" calls. I get that it isn't protecting invasive species if purchased on the same body of water. However, if people were allowed to transport live bait with RBC's... they would then bring illegal bait into Canada. There would be nothing keeping someone from bringing bait up and claiming they purchased them on the US side of the Lake. So, the law is... you can not cross the border with live bait. Nothing else matters. Crossing the border is not the same as driving from state to state. You are crossing an international border. You can not cross with live bait. If you do, you are knowingly breaking the law, and the MNR will write you an ENORMOUS ticket if caught. (assuming they don't take your boat and equipment too). Guys, I'm not trying to sound like a jerk about this. This is NOT a ""grey area"". This will not be a judgement call by the officer. This is black and white. You can not cross the border with live bait (other than crawlers). It doesn't matter where you purchased them. It doesn't matter if you have a receipt for them. You can't cross the border with live leeches or minnows."
4792826,Obabikon,2016-05-01 17:50:00,2370,"If you want to save your bait for tomorrow... find a nice quiet bay out of the way. Tie your bait up to a log, and pick them up in the morning. If you're worried someone will pick them up... leave a note."
4792834,v-bay gord,2016-05-01 18:01:00,3168,"With all the issues of invasive species, and with the convictions last year of people bringing bait in illegally, I'm sure there will be adequate enforcement of bait laws coming for this season. Want to play games? Think you can convince the C.O. with your logic? Let us know how that plays out........ My suggestion is if you really want to fish in Canada, stay in Canada. I hear Obabikon runs such a place.....and highly recommended!"
4793434,Lotw1,2016-05-01 21:10:00,36,"This is not just a LOTW regulation or US/Canada, MN/ON. It is illegal to bring live bait into Minnesota from anywhere...ND, SD, WI, IA or anyplace else."
4794242,OffCourse,2016-05-02 07:38:00,17,"smuggling???? You are fishing a LAKE that has a border running through it? How, having bait you are fishing with is considered smuggling IS silly. I understand the rules but if you are fishing a lake and have the ability to cross back and forth, common sense should kick in."
4794370,Huntindave,2016-05-02 08:08:00,2194,"Common sense would tell me to FOLLOW THE REGULATIONS! I don't have to agree with the regulation, I don't have to understand why it is in place. All I have to do is FOLLOW THE REGULATION! What part of that don't you understand?"
4794394,Obabikon,2016-05-02 08:14:00,2370,"If you're allowed to boat across with bait... what's the difference in driving across with bait? They can't prove that the minnows purchased on the US side were caught out of lake of the woods. They can't regulate those trappers. They also can't regulate what you do with that bait once you're across the border. You could give them to friends... who then run them up to Red Lake and fish. Just follow the rules... they are logical, and don't need to have loop holes put in to accommodate a handful of people."
4789186,picollen,2016-04-30 16:42:00,208,"I understand all of the rules and regulations that relate to live bait when crossing into Canada. Here is the question I keep getting conflicting information on: I am fishing on Lake of the Woods at Oak Island. I am going to plan on fishing back and forth between U.S. and Canadian waters every day. I already have my RABC pass buy my questions comes to live bait. If I buy leeches and minnows in Ontario and have a receipt at say 9 a.m. and I end up fishing in MN say at 5 p.m. can I use those same leeches and minnows? Take it a step further. At the end of the day, let's say Im in Canada waters and have two dozen leeches left. I am going to cross back over into MN to stay at the lodge. Do I have to release those leeches and buy fresh new leeches back in Canada the next day or can those now go back and forth across the border on the water??? Thanks for any clarification."
4789402,Lotw1,2016-04-30 17:41:00,36,The answer to your question is that it's illegal to bring live bait into Minnesota.
4789482,chris.brock,2016-04-30 17:58:00,112,"Personally, I would just fish. Leeches and minnows swimming around don't recognize international boundaries. If you got questioned, hopefully the conservation officer has some common sense and discretion."
4789538,picollen,2016-04-30 18:18:00,208,"That's my hope. I get the over the land deal but I don't see how it matters or is even viable to switch live bait when you're on the water and you happen to move 10 feet over the MN border from Canada or vice versa. However, I've never been one to underestimate the strictness of some of these DNR types and was curious if there was a hard and fast rule on this. Thanks for the help"
4789634,Obabikon,2016-04-30 18:45:00,2370,"It is illegal to transport live bait across an international border. (other than night crawlers in artificial bedding) That's it. End of discussion. If a CO or border officer catch you, you will be fined. It isn't worth it. Buy them in Canada... fish for the day, dump them in Canada or kill them and throw them on ice."
4789970,Nimstug,2016-04-30 20:19:00,2605,"Agree with Obabikon. When we were at Kettle Falls which is literally on the border, they only sold crawlers as live bait because of the minnow restrictions."
4790226,picollen,2016-04-30 23:00:00,208,I guess in a world where common sense is lacking this makes complete sense...
4791258,Stein67,2016-05-01 08:55:00,19,"Due to the extreme silliness of a rule over a dozen leeches, if you are that concerned, US receipt in one pocket, Canada receipt in the other, use appropriate receipt if checked."
4791674,v-bay gord,2016-05-01 11:41:00,3168,Makes sense to me. Any rule that makes it more difficult to fish Canadian waters while staying at a U.S. resort has my vote.
4791714,Obabikon,2016-05-01 11:50:00,2370,"If they allowed people to do it... people would lie about it. Unfortunately, there have been enough people lying about where they have purchased bait, and still smuggling bait across. There will be zero need for common sense. The common sense is... it is 100% illegal, don't do it unless you want an enormous fine. Also, the way I see it... don't push it with the rules about remote border crossings. If enough people break the rules, and get caught, they will stop giving them out. Saving $10 per day on bait isn't worth it."
