547030,PJM,2005-04-14 22:53:00,3516,dougj Thanks for logging in on your post and it is a very interesting topic. Commercial netting if not manage right can destroy a lake and like someone said just look at Red Lake. The Red lake band said they made a mistake and the state of Minnesota DNR came in and help restock the lake. It will be interesting to see what happens whn they start netting again. After reading your post I knew you would get some interesting nonlogged replys.
547044,Guest,2005-04-15 20:34:00,0,If anybody know anything about LOTW its Gord Pyzer.If he says its in trouble then we better pay attention.
547054,Guest,2005-04-16 18:51:00,0,"I have written many letters over the years about fishing and over fishing on LOTW. Not many paid attention then, not many will pay attention now. The Native's will get their own way everytime simply because that is the Government's way of keeping them quiet. The Government cannot afford to pay off these Native Treaty Rights so this is how it is being done for the time being. I thought Commercial Fishing on this lake was closed years ago, I thought that right was for ""personal consuption"" WOW a 40,000 lb ""personal comsuption"". IF they are also commercial fishing ""Shoal Lake"" and sending those to this packing plant, then I as a fisherman want that area opened to Sportfishing. The natives have no right to keep that great area for Trophy Walleye to themselves. I'll tell you all something. IF I saw a net on LOTW that is/was illegal I will pull out my knife and cut it up. No Problem. I could care less who it belongs to. Shoot me if you can catch me. Native or not. I personally could careless. As with everything else they seem to touch, they will only screw it all up in the end, and cry for more money from the Government. Poor me! Bull Kenora"
547055,Guest,2005-04-16 19:08:00,0,"Well, I don't believe the sky is falling quite yet, there is going to be a 2 day meeting in Emo next week regarding this whole issue. Many of the Elders of the Bands believe this is wrong, we are going to start working on a plan with the natives to ensure the longevity of LOTW's fishery. Please don't assume that this is a dead end, it's just a fork in the road that level headed, educated and concerned people will address and I am sure a good plan will come into play."
547068,bronzeback77,2005-04-17 15:12:00,97,"This is very upsetting. I am sure that there are better places in Canada to fish than LOTWs but I love the lake. I have been going up for ten years ( not many compared to others but I am only 28), something that I look forward to more than anything else out of the entire year. To think that I may not be able to take my children and grand children up in the future to enjoy the place that I love so much makes me very sad. I wish that there was something that we anglers could do to save such a wonderful place. If Gord Pyzer thinks there is a problem than I wish he would write something about it in-Fisherman, that would get some peoples attention. Sorry, if I sound corny but the lake means a lot to me, I have lots of wonderful memories on the water and I hope I can make a lot more. If there is anything that one angler can do please let me know I would be happy to help in any way.[email protected]"
547091,Guest,2005-04-18 09:05:00,0,"Does anyone know which fish supplying company is picking up all these fish and distributing them? These fish are all being sold in the states. Maybe it's time to find that out. If you cannot stop the netters, you maybe can stop the buyer's. Maybe a few protest signs at their head offices in the states."
547098,Guest,2005-04-18 11:27:00,0,"Aside from my personal boycott of Culvers..... I ran a quick internet search and to my surprise... Cabela's was at the top of the Walleye Fillet retail list...Do you want 2,5, or 10 lbs of fillets? Ship em anywhere. Thanks, but I will be ordering my gear elsewhere this season. Overall, not a ton of online sales activity. Must be the thousands of restuarants across America....."
547100,Guest,2005-04-18 11:57:00,0,"I called the MNR this morning regarding this. First, they wanted to know where this 40,000lb total came from? I then called King Fisheries at 548-1588. The confirmed the fact on fish from LOTW but certainly nothing even remotely close to the above figure. More in the area of 2.800 lb a MONTH.. One figure they gave me was in the area of 100,000 for a month but this included a great number of whitefish. Which by the way, not many people even fish for in these waters. More should. They also mentioned that they are accountable to the MNR and the MNR too confirmed this. Call the MNR yourself, then call the King Fisheries is you wish to confirm these numbers yourself. I told them about this board and that they should put their fact here too. I am not defending commercial fishing on LOTW by any means. I thought that when buying all the commercial fisherman out years ago, meant that ALL commercial fishing stopped. So what I see is they stopped the commercial on one end, and gave it to the natives on the other. OR part of it. The natives can fish commercially according to Treaty 3. I thought they could only take fish for personal comsuption. When and how this changed is beyond me. They are only allowed too to have nets in certain areas. I will attempt to find out where these areas are. I inquired about Shoal Lake, and they can commercial it but only for Whitefish. Nothing else. If I hear anymore I will post it here. and as I say give these places a call yourself to verify my information. Have a nice day. Kenora"
547101,bronzeback77,2005-04-18 12:14:00,97,"Great info Kenoraonca, you don't happen to have the numbers for the two places you mentioned do you. I would like to call and express my concern as well. Dave St. Louis"
547005,Guest,2005-04-14 08:00:00,0,There is some interesting info on the Musky Hunter and Muskies1st web sites about netting on LOTW. check LOTW problems
547009,dougj,2005-04-14 10:30:00,15,"I'll post the same thing here, as it's the walleyes that are the main target. Doug Johnson Many of you have heard about the increased commercial fishing by the first nation on the LOTWs and other waters in NW Ontario. I received this e-mail from Gord Pyzor (former Kenora fisheries district manager, now In-Fisherman field editor and a very knowledgeable person about NW Ontario fisheries ) this AM and it greatly concerns me. Some of you may have seen pictures of LOTWS gill nets with rotten fish last summer. These are revolting, but are not the real problem. Nets that aren't tended soon quit fishing. Nets that are well tended fish every day are more of a problem, as these are the nets that catch fish. If the commercial fisherman is a good one He will move his nets to the fish just like you and I do when trying to catch fish. These are the nets that will decimate a fishery, not the ones with rotten fish! Here's Gord's e-mail: He sent this to Dick Pearson, and Doug Stange and myself. I feel that the thought was to get this out and talked about. I don't know what can be done from the US side as far as Canadian natives commercial fishing, but I think that getting this out so people are aware of the problem can't hurt. This is going to effect everyone who fished the LOTWs and the Winnipeg River, and pretty #*^@ soon! Doug Johnson Here's Gord's e-mail: ""Good morning Doug, Doug, and Dick. Regrettably, you are about to watch the dismantling and destruction of one of the greatest freshwaters fisheries of all times. Please see below.

I received a very disturbing phone call last evening from Lee Winterton (Guy Winterton's brother) about the extent of First Nation commercial netting on Lake of the Woods, which corroborates what many people (including myself) have been observing and reporting to you repeatedly for well over a year now. I suggested to Lee that he call, and/or meet, with you as soon as possible to fill you in on the details. As Lee reported, one of the principals in the new commercial fish packing plant here in Kenora, advised him that he has been shipping ""40,000 pounds of a fish a week, all winter long, from Lake of the Woods."" Lee also related a first hand account of an Indian commercial fisherman who told him that he was taking all of his ""quotas"" from all the lakes he was ""licensed to fish"" solely from the Lake of the Woods. The commercial fisherman also suggested to Lee that this was now a common practice with many other commercial fishermen. I am sure Lee will relate the specifics when he meets with you. If this is true, the harvest is entirely unsustainable and will severely threaten fish stocks in Lake of the Woods. As you know, the accelerated level of commercial netting on the lake over the past year has been unprecedented and is cause for concern. It now appears to be totally out of control. If it continues, I have no doubt, whatsoever, that we will shortly see very serious responses within the fishery. Indeed, if what Lee is relating is factual, and I have no doubt that it is, given what many of us have witnessed ourselves and reported to you repeatedly, the impact on the walleye and pike populations is unsustainable. And the effect on other species, especially muskellunge, that are being netted, killed and dumped as an unwanted by-catch is disgraceful. If 40,000 pounds of fish a week are being shipped from the new local fish processing plant alone, the implications are unmistakable. It translates into 160,000 pounds of fish a month or over 2 million pounds a year! And that is from only one source. Given the early ice out conditions that now present themselves, if uncontrolled commercial netting continues throughout the upcoming spring spawning period, the impact on the fishery will be particularly harmful. Perhaps irreversible. I would urge you to take immediate and responsible action to reduce and control the harvest to sustainable levels, else risk losing one of the most important fisheries in Ontario. A friend.

547017,Guest,2005-04-14 15:49:00,0,THE SKY IS FALLING!!!! :boohoo: THE SKY IS FALLING!!!!!!! ;) ;) ;) No Walleyes Left in LOTW!!!!!!! :popcorn: You all stay home??? :rotflmao:
547018,Guest,2005-04-14 16:12:00,0,"They have a good market for the Walleye thats being taken. It's called ""Culver's"". They sell a fish sandwich made with Walleye. BOY it's SURE GOOD. How good are you with a chainsaw, you could be really busy cutting down trees to make the wrapers for the ""Culver's"" Walleye fish sandwich. Then when all the trees are gone the lakes will fill up with mud and you can set up a NASCAR track and really make some money. Over the last couple of years the catch limits have been reduced because the sport fisherman are soooooooooooo good at what they do. I don't think so. The goverment in Canada better wake up before it's to late. At 40,000 pounds of fish a week it won't be long before nothing is left. You might be right ""the sky is falling""!!!!!! I'd be very interested in what the responce was to Gord's email."
547021,Guest,2005-04-14 19:45:00,0,"1)First Nations treaty RIGHTS to fish have been upheld by the highest Courts. How pro-active is that? :banging: 2) If people didn't buy the fish there would be no market. Fat chance of that. Move on, cry a bucket, stay away, whatever does it for you. :boohoo:"
547022,Guest,2005-04-14 19:47:00,0,So what are your plans after the fish are gone??? I'm sure you've got that figured out rightttttttttttttttttttttttttt
547023,Guest,2005-04-14 20:11:00,0,"Those ""rights"" were given to you by un-elected activist Liberal appointed courts, also provisions were written in to the decisions giving the Ministry the final say in protecting the resource regardless of whether they infringe upon your ""rights"". Keep pushing it, you may find all you fought for gone because of your ignorance and total disregard for the resource."
