4810082,ogilville,2016-05-06 09:46:00,262,"We eat fish every day and sometimes twice a day for the week we are in camp. Fried is our favorite but will do baked, grilled, or fish chowder. Since we can't bring a lot back home we make sure to get our fill while we are there."
4811082,shanny28757,2016-05-06 15:47:00,4,"I think we are planning to do burgers and hot dogs our fly in day, 5 fish dinners, and one big steak dinner for 3 birthdays we will be celebrating. We will do 2 shore lunches on the days we don't have fish dinners. Just seems so foolish that so many of the trips we have packed in so much food when we've had so much fresh fish at our disposal."
4818618,lawson2343,2016-05-09 12:56:00,459,"We have shore lunch every day but the last of our 6 day trip. We have two walleye dinners during the week, so all total we eat walleye 7 times. Something you need to be aware of is the fish you keep/eat the last day. If you are taking home your limit of walleyes, 4 in Ontario where I fish, you are not supposed to eat any walleye on the last day - that would put you over the limit of 4. Last year we got stopped at a checkpoint and the CO asked us what we had to eat the day before. We answered pasta, eggs, etc. No fish. He said, ""good answer""."
4809162,WalleyeWally28,2016-05-06 05:56:00,298,We eat fresh walleye 6 nights out of 7.
4809274,Bigstorm,2016-05-06 06:25:00,799,"We eat walleye 4 out of 6 nights usually. Deep fried, pan fried, various types of baked walleye"
4809338,SinOrSwim,2016-05-06 06:47:00,1528,"We don't do shore lunch as often anymore due to the time and effort but we always have fish at night. We do walleye/seafood chimichangas, walleye/seafood pasta alfredo etc. We do fish tacos for shore lunches with things like beans and potato salad vs the standard shore lunch. Takes less time and easy clean up."
4809458,Babamel2,2016-05-06 07:14:00,414,"Our group loves fresh fish. We have fish as the meat dish every evening except the last night before leaving. the last night is the exception as it gives everyone a chance to fill their limits for take home. I usually prepare a huge batch of chicken wings, they are often the meat dish for the final night."
4809570,stjoeguy,2016-05-06 07:42:00,979,"We have fish for dinner 3-4 times on nights 1,3,5 & maybe 6. Day 7's fish are kept to bring home. It's interesting seeing other group's routines and how they vary and evolve. At the first camp we went to years ago, we boated out 30 minutes or more to the area we fished and had shore lunch every day. The cabin we stay at now has good fishing right in the area, within 10 minutes or so. Here we started with shore lunch every day, but it quickly changed to coming back to the cabin for lunch and only having shore lunch occasionally when we have new guys in the group. It's part of the ""Canada experience"", but as we get older some of the guys would rather go back to the cabin for lunch and grab an hour's snooze before getting back on the lake. I see that other groups fish after dinner for the night bite, but that's never been part of our trip. We fish until 6 and return to the cabin. By the time everyone's had a drink, cleaned fish, made dinner, etc, we don't eat until practically 8 PM. Time for another drink, clean up dinner, maybe a card game or two and we're in bed by 10. In 49 days I get to start that routine, again (but who's counting?)."
4809642,bigwalleye1,2016-05-06 07:55:00,2632,"Once a day for shore lunch, and walleye parmesan for dinner one night for sure, maybe walleye cakes or wild rice stuffed walleye hors d'oeurves before dinner"
4809690,SinOrSwim,2016-05-06 08:03:00,1528,"hahahahah I'm glad someone else has this issue. It's a hot topic for our group with the older guys. Like my Dad. LOL But, no easy solution because nobody wants to stop fishing at 4 or 5 to come and clean fish. Seems like the fish turn off during the mid-day and about that 3 or 4 pm time frame they kind of turn back on so you end up staying out til 6 or 7. We don't fish after dinner either but might this year since we can fish closer to camp and off the dock. Place we have been going you can't fish off the dock."
4809770,camp chef,2016-05-06 08:21:00,915,"We have fish two times......Once for lunch and one for dinner...both times they are grilled with a meyer lemon and habanero olive oil, black pepper and garlic salt. If we happen into the right Northern (27 inches). we have that as well as walleye. Our other meals include Venison Burgers, Venison tenderloin and grilled shrimp,Prime Beef Porterhouses, Goat cheese and bruchetta covered grilled Pork chops,Venison Italian sausage and peppers,slow basted BBQ chicken, Smoked chicken and porcini omelettes and venison chili dogs."
4809874,Lovetofish,2016-05-06 08:46:00,458,"We eat walleye every night but the last back in camp so we can bring fish home. We grill something the last night, whatever I had in the freezer from home. We have a large group but we each bring our own food and mostly eat on our own morning and evening. Rarely do we have a fish shore lunch. Too lazy I guess, or maybe too old. Instead we all meet up around noon on a beach and have cold sandwiches or grill brats or pork burgers and other snacks and goodies. A couple in our group have portable Weber gas grills. We are done in a short hour and back fishing we go. So I guess our food list for each trip is pretty simple. A tradition we have had for almost 30 years is our all-camp meal on Tuesday or Wednesday night. We typically have 7 families on our trip. We make our fish on the fire a couple different ways and each bring a dish to pass. What a feast."
4809882,LOW1,2016-05-06 08:50:00,2828,"I made the big mistake of going to Costco with my wife and having her see that Costco was selling Canadian walleye fillets for $9.99 per pound. She then observed, correctly, that if we spent $2500 per year on buying frozen walleye we would save money and get a lot more fish to eat."
4807794,shanny28757,2016-05-05 16:47:00,4,Do you eat fish on a week long trip in the bush? We are putting our menu together for a July trip. On past trips we will eat maybe two dinners and one shore lunch. Looking back it seems like a waste of an opportunity to have some amazing meals of fresh fish. Plus it makes grocery shopping easier and saves on weight which is always a big problem for my group.
4807858,Golden Eagle,2016-05-05 17:08:00,2642,"Considering the high cost of walleye fillets, my trip is free about Wednesday."
4807938,acplumber,2016-05-05 17:49:00,80,Shanny We were about the same But this years menu I think we have about 6 meals that include walleye What I'm looking forward to the most is deep fried walleye with franks hot sauce and blue cheese dressing 50 more days!!
4807978,prov1800,2016-05-05 17:58:00,5010,notvsure if you dobthis but roll fillets in the hot sauce in a plastic bag then in batter then fry them.
4808098,Live to jig,2016-05-05 18:42:00,159,"I personally love to cook and my brother loves to eat, lol, he cleans the fish and the boat while I prepare the dinner, I prebake a number of meals vacuum seal and freeze at home, a whole Prime Rib, a Corned Beef Brisket ect... Desserts are just before bed and are the highlight of the trip , second only to fishing and that amazing wilderness."
4808178,KSjim,2016-05-05 19:09:00,88,"We have walleye everyday of our week trip.Fried walleye 2 nights.Blackened and boiled.Fish tacos.Steak and boiled walleye.The two nights we don't have walleye we have a ""shore lunch"" at the cabin. Also one time during the week we make a walleye omelet for breakfast.This is the only week of the year we have a chance to take walleye directly from a pristine lake to the dinner table. We feel it is our ""duty"" to take advantage. Hey somebody has to do it!"
4808258,Twodogs,2016-05-05 19:43:00,115,We eat fish everyday...we have it fried...we have bacon wrapped grilled walleye dipped in Frank's hot sauce or a bbq sauce...we have fish tacos with all the sides. ...poor man's lobster boiled cheeks with drawn butter....walleye chowder...grilled walleye by leaving one side with skin on and grill over hot coals....now I'm hungry
4808466,Pooch,2016-05-05 20:37:00,4619,"First two days in camp we eat fish, then every other day. In between days each guy on the trip is responsible for at least one home made meal. Usually a wife's ""popular with the guys"" dish.We have two prepared meals a day then maybe a snack before we turn in for the night. We have a breakfast (cold cereal or hot breakfast, alternate every other day) then come back in to camp around one or two PM for our big meal of the day. Take a nap then go back out around five o'clock for the evening bite. Anyone hungry before bed can make a sandwich, popcorn, grilled cheese or what ever we have brought just for that evening snack.Works for us.Pooch"
4808506,Nimstug,2016-05-05 20:44:00,2605,"Maybe once in a week. Maybe. It's usually just me and another person so we try to keep prep and clean-up time to a minimum. Like Live To, I do the some premade stuff at home. I charcoal cook a pork roast in the kettle with the fat side up which is buried under garlic powder and onion powder (When you think you have enough of both, add more.) Wrapped in foil for the trip; warmed in the oven at camp. Leftovers make great sandwiches. Warm womp biscuits are nice. Those are the wrapped biscuits you peel the wrapper off and ""womp"" them on the counter to get them to pop open. Get then ""grand"" size. For two people, they will work for two meals. We will do a ""breakfast for dinner."" We don't bother with a big breakfast in the morning. Cereal, juice, maybe toast then down to the boat. For dinner we will do wheat or flax pancakes, scrambled eggs, etc. My trips are in the fall (last week of September this year) so we plan to have our big meal of the day at about 2:00 pm then go back out until the lake is dead calm and the skies are cobalt. NimstugI'm ready..."
4809082,Ogoki,2016-05-06 05:31:00,291,"We have a big breakfast every morning . I eat oatmeal at home every morning and on a trip i splurge . So sausage , bacon, eggs , biscuits etc. We eat fish everyday. At least 4 of the eight nights we eat fish when we come in at dark , which is pushing midnight . That makes around 12 meals of fish in eight days. Mid week we do make a couple pizzas . Another couple is going with us this year . We told them what we eat and they said that's about what they do when they go. To break this up a little , one day we have fish and potatoes and the next we have potates and fish . We make slaw and put in container in fridge so we don't have to make it everyday. I am ready to fish and eat fish . 4 week to go !"
