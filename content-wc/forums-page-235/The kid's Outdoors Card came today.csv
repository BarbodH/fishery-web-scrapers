He opened the envelope, looked it over for a few seconds, said ""Awesome"", put it with his passport and started checking our tackle boxes and bags. Trip is 116 days out. Money well spent."

4797402,kzoofisher,2016-05-03 03:27:00,5144,"Yep, HDL. Getting a few more spots dialed in each year, picking new areas to explore in the off season. Taking one new guy and one has rotated out for this year. I'd like to hold on to the week with enough guys or move it up a bit so my brother and his son can go without missing school. My oldest will be in college in 2018 and you never know what that will do to trip plans and finances, be nice to have enough interested guys that I could miss a year without losing the week. How has Burt been fishing? I'm headed to Grayling for a four day weekend and will probably fish walleye in the mornings and trout for the afternoon hatches. River is in the low 50s, figure lakes must be the same."

4801570,kzoofisher,2016-05-04 03:59:00,5144,"Three weeks! Good for you, hope you crush them. I worked on the opener and was kind of glad, it's always a zoo and the fishing will probably be better this week."
