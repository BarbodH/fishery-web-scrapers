565199,Guest,2007-05-12 07:40:00,0,"Thanks all for the information, sounds like I should be able to catch a walleye or two! I also just upgraded my boat to a Starcraft 160 DLX Tiller. Now I believe I am ready for anything!"
566871,Guest,2007-07-01 22:54:00,0,"Well, just back from Gullrock. What a blast ! Stayed at Golden Hook and had a ball draggin in the eyes. Fishing was good, and the weather was okay. What a great first Canada trip!"
566910,Guest,2007-07-02 19:58:00,0,Good to hear that the trip was a blast! I sure miss Canada this year. I will definitely have to get booked for next year. Did any of our advice work? how was the resort and are you glad you upgraded boats?
566933,Guest,2007-07-03 13:09:00,0,"All advice that I received directly and indirectly (through browsing) helped a ton. I am a walleye rookie and I felt like a pro. We boated a lot of walleye. My son was in 7th heaven, not only did he get the big eye of the trip 24"", but he caught his first northern pike ever(followed by the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, etc...) I was glad that I got a new boat (thats not a difficult statement to make) the 14' would have been a little tough on a couple of days. As it was The 16' Starcraft did great, as did my electronics LMS-522c igps. The only downside was that I only hung a Merc 30hp 4stk on it. It is fine for good weather, but sort of a dog when pushing into wind and waves. (I'll fix that next year!) All in all it was a fantastic trip, and Gullrock is a very nice lake with very few hazards! Many thanks to all for the advice received! Tha"

4814122,mally,2016-05-08 05:15:00,2,Heading to Gullrock July 8th and staying at Golden Hook. Any good tips for a first timer besides what I have read.
4814994,strength22,2016-05-08 11:01:00,49,"Burnt island and fishermans point will be surrounded with as many boats as you can count so get there early..do a quick breakfast, not the fat as **** breakfast that takes forever. Thos 2 spots will have 20 plus boats stacked on top of each other. The high cliff area....same as the other spots. Ethel is a good spot. I always jig or slip jig system. The green bouy in keg and the shoreline leading into the green buoy is good. Sunken island is good. The fishing is good usually. the traffic is usually as good though. I like late sept. on gullrock....hardly any folks left and i love it."
4819306,P&y only,2016-05-09 16:39:00,133,"You're getting good info. Going to a good lake. About your boat: Factor in the fuel cost of pulling it+ any docking fees you will be charged when deciding whether to take it. It may make sense for you. For me, where I go, an upgrade boat costs very little more than the added cost of fuel and dock fees. For the extra cost I get peace of mind that there wont be any trailer issues. Enjoy your trip and take LOTS of pictures."
4822650,Poplar,2016-05-10 13:40:00,7,"We'll be heading up to Gullrock in two weeks, staying at Poplar Point. Been there many times. Excellent fishing and Ed and Lisa run a great camp. Was hoping to get any info on the dry conditions, water levels, fire danger etc. Never been much of a problem before, hope this year isn't any different. Any info would be appreciated. Thanks"
564637,Guest,2007-04-18 16:24:00,0,"Wow, what an outstanding site. I have spent hours already reading much information here and will continue to do so. I will be taking my son to Gull Rock Lake in Ontario the last week in June. This is our first time to Canada. I am a novice to walleye fishing, (we usually panfish) I chose Gull Rock because of this site (It was between that and Lac Seul but I couldnt get lodging on Lac) I would like any pointers you can give as to what techniques, locations etc would be successgul. I will be watching lake reports after the season opens to get current fish report info. I will be taking my own boat, a 14' with 30hp. I sure do appreciate any info... Thanks"
564638,Guest,2007-04-18 18:45:00,0,"With that boat be careful of when the wind starts picking up. If you have to run across the big part of the lake it could get rough! Trolling with lindy rigs and minnows will usually catch a couple fish here and there. Once you find them...STAY ON THEM!!!! Set out a couple markers and drift or troll back and forth to keep picking them up. Or you you jig fish them. That is usually my preferred method. The sunken island is a good spot, The boot, Burnt island, The banana on keg lake is also good. If you need more info just shoot me an E-mail @ [email protected] I have been going for 6 years a couple times a year and love the lake!"
564639,Guest,2007-04-18 19:12:00,0,"Where are you staying? The last week of June should be good on the points (almost any point) and around the islands. I agree with the previous post, be careful in that 14 foot boat when gullrock blows up, it gets really rough. I got a 18foot boat and I slow to a crawl in the big waves. however, don't let that scare you there are always islands to hide behind."
564640,Guest,2007-04-18 19:14:00,0,"I fished Gull Rock for 18 years, many of those with my son. He started going up when he was 9. I have fond memories of him catching his first Gull rock walleye near Burnt island, 5 lbs. his next fish drug us around the back of burnt until good ole dad set the drag wrong. Gull Rock is a good safe lake to take your son. hit all of the points of Islands with the wind blowing in. In Keg, around the green bouy is normally good. E-mail if you would like more detail. [email protected] Where are you staying? I now go to Lac Seul."
564646,Guest,2007-04-18 21:14:00,0,"We will be staying at the Golden Hook, I had some concerns with the 14' boat, but I am pretty cautious on the water, Plus in lookng at the map it appears there are many good places to hide from big wind/ waves and still fish. We still have 2 months to go and my son is going out of his mind (this is for his 8th grade graduation)."
564653,Guest,2007-04-19 06:40:00,0,I would second the concern with a 14' boat. I have been behind an island and didn't relalize that the wind had come up. I have had white knickles for sure. You never know when the wind is going to come up.
564657,sifty,2007-04-19 09:57:00,46,make sure and take some johnson silver minnows. That bay that golden hook is located with is full of hammer-handle pike and bigger your son will just about jump out of the boat first time he see 3 or 4 pike swinging at your lure at the side of the boat. So you don't get lost out on the lake look for the big white painted rock that will get you back to Golden Hook. There is nice island to the right of the bay as you come out onto the main lake that we always have good luck at-I think its called pryndek island. We backtrolled in 15-18 feet on the front of the island facing back towards golden hook. When the waves get big you can always go to back of boot island and back troll never any waves their we always had good luck there troll as close to shore as you can with out snagging up. Good luck!! you and your son will have a great time. PS> Bring rain good rain gear.
564839,WalleyeHawk,2007-04-29 20:58:00,28,"I have never fished Gull Rock either, but hope to go there in the near future. I have an 18 1/2' Crestliner Sportfish and I would still hire a guide for my wife and myself for the first day then go from there. In your case with your young son I also think that also would be a very smart idea and then at the end of the day explain to the guide about the boat you have and maybe he would put you on some safe fishing for the remainder of your trip. Safety is the first thing I think about on any fishing trip. My wife and I are taking our two 15 year old grandson's the day after Memorial day to Lake Vermilion in Northern Minnesota a lake we have fished for many years and also my boat is equipped with GPS and Navonics lake maps. If I new to the lake even with this equipment I would still hire a guide for the first day, otherwise you will spend the first day or two just scouting the lake. Hope you have good fishing and a safe trip that you and your son can remember for many years. The Walleyehawk"
564850,Guest,2007-04-30 15:04:00,0,"I agree with Walleyehawk that a guide on the first day is likely a good idea, but if there is a lake you do not need a guide on it is Gullrock. There will be walleyes everywhere in June. The question will be what is the difference between walleyes and a lot of walleyes. Your boat size will be a factor in big water with big wind. Gullrock can really buck, especially on the Eastern side with a West wind. But there are lots of islands and points, especially near Golden Hook, that you can find somewhere to fish. Ask your camp owners where to go, and they will put you on places to fish close to camp if the weather is bad, and if the weather is good, it can be like glass (which isn't always the best fishing). Call your camp to get a guide recommendation. They will either put you on one, or if they tell you that you don't need one (a guide) I trust they will give you some spots. There are very few secrets on Gullrock, and lots and lots of good locations. Get a map of the lake, that will be very needed for the first time. Good luck . . . you are going to have a great time! PS Bring quality rain gear - even if it doesn't rain, you will want it boating in big waves. I learned that lesson the hard way. PSS If you do find your 14 ft. boat to be too small for the weather, Golden Hook has many extra 16 ft. camp boats. I think you will be OK for most situations. Have fun!"
564862,Guest,2007-05-01 01:23:00,0,Bigfish9 Just wanted to let you know that there are very few rock hazards in the Gullrock chain of lakes but the few that are there are marked with green lund paint from pickles boat!!. :fishhit:
