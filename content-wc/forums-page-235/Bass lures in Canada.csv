4804218,mickr,2016-05-04 16:13:00,74,Bingo!!!! Coming from a Canadian that has probably fished more smallie lakes up here than you American boys will ever get to.....here's your winner!
4804274,P&y only,2016-05-04 16:20:00,133,"Lots of good suggestions already, But my money is always on a bomber model 4a red craw crankbait."
4806546,Habitual Eyer,2016-05-05 09:52:00,144,What would wacky rigged be ??
4806594,Thompmd,2016-05-05 10:01:00,320,Hooked in the middle or the egg sac(with both ends hanging down) and you twitch it back to the boat
4807490,mickr,2016-05-05 15:01:00,74,"hooked in the middle with a circle hook. cast it out, let it sit, maybe as long as 1 minute depending how deep you are. One good pop, let it sit again. if nothing, retrieve and cast again. I don't find twitching it works."
4807634,Paul H,2016-05-05 15:53:00,1232,"What others said , but add, inline spinners Mepps or Vibrax #2 (give or take) in the chartreuse,orange color. Floating Rapala - I honestly never do well much anywhere else in the world,but they seem to be killer in the North. Number 1 though is always a Power bait twister on a black or green jig head - usually a black or smoke power bait. Senkos Tubes Jig & crawler 4"" and 6"" worm in smoke or motor oil Small crankbaits - rebel craw, crappie size of a big O in Chrome. Always saved a day or 2 just for smallmouth."
4808378,BuckeyeBill,2016-05-05 20:12:00,76,"Smallies are my favorite and what I target in Ontario. Being retired, during the winter months, I make my own topwater prop bait from balsa wood. I will fish it probably 75 % of the time simply because I love explosive topwater action. Just can't be beat. Even in less than ideal weather conditions we catch plenty of bass. I will also throw a white fluke and also a white wacky worm. Trip is only a month away and I am ready to go right now !!"
4808666,Nimstug,2016-05-05 21:18:00,2605,"I would suggest you don't hook wacky rigs through the worm. Soft plastics like Senkos will last much longer with a small O ring or rubber band around the middle of the worm, then hook under the O ring. Yeah, I'm cheap... Nimstug...but not easy."
4810642,Aaron-IN,2016-05-06 12:56:00,500,That's exactly how I do it! I've found it to be a more effective hook set as well.
4799378,Habitual Eyer,2016-05-03 12:03:00,144,Going to a lake in Chapleau area early July. Has a lot of smallmouth. Wondering what are some good lures/presentations to throw for smallmouth. Don't have much and need to gear up.
4799466,Ranger319,2016-05-03 12:14:00,166,Pop-r's. Late afternoon/evening top water is amazing
4799946,Thompmd,2016-05-03 14:37:00,320,"I wouldn't spend a lot I like Zara puppy in frog pattern, white senkos, 5/16 white spinnerbaits hammered nickel willow leaf blade and chartreuse trailer, craw dad colored 1/4 & 1/2 rattletrap and crawdad colored crank baits. I would also have some tubes in green pumpkin. The key is small rock and points especially on main lake structures"
4800026,dan cardinal,2016-05-03 14:51:00,64,"Plastic craw imitations always work well for me. I like Zman Elaztech CrawdadZ. Advantages: long lasting, match the forage very well, and buoyancy that will stand a jig straight up on bottom. I would rig them on a plain round head jig...1/8 ounce mostly, but 1/4 ounce for deeper water. Good colors are pumpkin orange, brown orange... maybe watermelon or straight pumpkin for clearer water. If you can keep pike from biting you off, you could potentially catch 30+ smallmouth on one plastic....these are the ""super plastics""! A dab of super glue will keep them pegged to the head of the jig or barb. I have fished with one plastic all day...that's how elastic they are. CrawdadZ are what I would consider finesse size. So work very well for smallmouth. I sometimes cut off the tail to shortened it a bit if the bite become slow."
4800162,Algoma Guy,2016-05-03 15:33:00,48,Jig head and white twister tail. Original floating Rapala in Blk/gold and blk/silver. Troll or cast along rock rubble shorelines. Catch Bass. Have fun!
4800298,packpro,2016-05-03 16:10:00,695,"If the water is calm and you are on a good spot, nothing is better than the splash of a top water bite. Pop-R, Jitterbug or prop bait. This is an evening bite for us. You don't need all three, but we have found all three to be equally effective. If you only want to one lure. I would recommend a jig head with a 4""-6"" paddletail. I love this bait for its versatility. You can set the hook point tight to the bait and throw it into cover. You can reel and pause, allowing the bait to cover the water column vertically. Or, you can steady retrieve it. I like it since I can use the same lure for walleye, and pike. Very versatile."
4800970,adempsey,2016-05-03 18:53:00,963,"Typical stuff really. As mentioned, jig+grub, jerk baits, top water (I like the plastic frogs) etc. I like using shad raps and other shad style baits. A lipless crankbait would be a good choice as well. Smallies can be deep. Can try dropshot if you want a different tactic. Even some inline spinners, Mepps Aglia, Black Fury are fun to use over rock piles."
4801106,martinbns,2016-05-03 19:51:00,1520,I had some incredible results on Smallmouths over the years with orange Big O and an orange jointed floating rapala.
4802050,Aaron-IN,2016-05-04 07:04:00,500,Anyone who goes to Canada to fish for smallmouth bass and doesn't take Senkos(or knockoff brand) and fish them whacky rigged should just stay home.
4802866,Richard B,2016-05-04 10:24:00,735,"I love fishing for small jaws with the Rebel little humpy, if you can find any, Bagley killer b's, tiny torpedos, zara spook, plastic floating frogs in the weeds, make sure you are ready for pike to hammer it, and in 15 foot + I use a blade bait or rattle trap."
