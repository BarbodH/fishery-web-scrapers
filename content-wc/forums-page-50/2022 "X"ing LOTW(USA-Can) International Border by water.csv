HECKLSMILLER,2022-04-28 15:14:00,629,"With the 2022 season just around the corner, has anyone been informed or has confirmed as to what Ontario, Canada, will be requiring for crossing into their LOTW waters by water? I'm hoping the regulations will be the same as required last August of 2021. The basic requirements were: #1. No RABC required #2. Passport & Covid shot card on person #3. No beaching or touching of land, No docking @ Resorts or tying alongside another vessel #4. Bait restricted to artificial. Would appreciate any confirmation on the official 2022 season requirements.

So how are we who are traveling to Quetico via BWCAW affected? I am not entering the Quetico this year, but wondering how that is supposed to play out. We always needed this permit in the past."
6652508,Muddy Water,2022-04-30 11:13:00,4,"We also have questions, accept we're trying to get to our privately owned place on Canadian soil in Rainy Lake.Will we have to trailer the boats into Canada since the RABC remains on pause?"
6652518,Obabikon,2022-04-30 12:01:00,2370,"Yes, you will have to cross by car."
6652520,Muddy Water,2022-04-30 12:16:00,4,"That's what I thought. I'll pack an extra bag full of patience, (if I go)."
