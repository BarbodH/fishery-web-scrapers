I was able to do some color editing so this new video has much more realistic colors. More underwater videos coming up after the summer as well. The camera seems like the best bait haha but If anyone has any ideas or baits you want me to record this summer let me know.https://youtu.be/95mgBOfjNjo

6650824,kim n indiana,2022-04-25 14:25:00,62,perfect examples of why you want to throw a pause in there about every 5th handle turn. Forces the fish to make a decision.
6650828,prov1800,2022-04-25 14:56:00,5010,Cool
6651032,stumcfar,2022-04-26 07:29:00,451,"Cool video. I have learned pulling shad raps for walleyes, that pike usually hit from behind racing toward the boat and walleye must hit from the side or bottom. You can always tell a pike because your line goes slack for an instance as they come from behind at a high rate of speed and typically walleye just grab it and and the rod bends."
