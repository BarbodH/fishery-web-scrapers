6576190,Bergy,2021-07-06 17:49:00,83,I have 2 of the Nano One series rods. They are awesome. My son has the Scheels Walleye series rod and for the money I think that is the best rod out there. They stand behind there products as well.
6576376,KC Walleye,2021-07-07 07:36:00,274,"I can’t speak to your exact situation. I have a Scheels ONE Limited Edition rod, not the Heritage. I would say personally the Limited Edition is not in the same class as my Legend Elites, Legend Extremes, or Loomis Walleye GLXs. The Heritage may get you more in those type rod classes as that is the supposed step up from the the Limited. Don’t get me wrong, the Limited is a nice rod, but I can’t speak on the Heritage. It would be nice to get some of those models in hand, side by side, to see what you like. For that price point there are lots of other great rod builders out there as well."
6576482,bones82,2021-07-07 13:20:00,121,"Thank you for the reply. I make take my NRX, Elite, and Xtreme in to Scheels and do a quick comparison. The problem is that nothing beats a real world test. How do you like to tear your rods for sensitivity in the store? I already have a custom Point Blank rod that is my baby so probably won't build another one."
6652222,eyecatchin123,2022-04-29 09:49:00,81,Scheels One 6'2 rods are awesome. If you are using for jigging I highly recommend. Love mine.
