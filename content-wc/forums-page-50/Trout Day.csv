6649486,prov1800,2022-04-20 13:23:00,5010,Floater or permanent
6649488,rosh1,2022-04-20 13:25:00,275,"Roll in, going to add a couple of sections. Last year low water was tough."
6649264,prov1800,2022-04-19 15:27:00,5010,My plan was to go and fish today.Was either going to be crappies on Cedar Lake or Trout on Cliff Lake. I drove past Camp Robinson and pulled into the highway landing on Cliff.Had a heck of a time parking there with the snow load there.Got to my spot and drilled one hole.Auger was acting up.Got settled in by 9 and fished till 1.Fantastic bite and brought 15 Lakers up and lost 3.Could not have asked for better weather as it got up to 4c with bluebird skies.Coffee and blueberry muffins my wife made didnt hurt either.Hole I fished was 57 ft deep and I used a 1/8 th oz jig I tied some hair on and a freebie minnow.Very aggressive fish today.Most came up from the bottom to intercept the jig at around 35-40 ft and just slammed it.Took 2 trout home so will have a couple of fish fries on the deck.
6649288,Eckohlt,2022-04-19 17:21:00,3685,How thick is the ice john??
6649290,prov1800,2022-04-19 17:36:00,5010,Looked like 2 ft solid and a foot of frozen slush and snow.
6649296,Eckohlt,2022-04-19 17:41:00,3685,Ouch!!
6649300,Eckohlt,2022-04-19 17:43:00,3685,Probably more ice on non lake trout waters.
6649324,prov1800,2022-04-19 20:00:00,5010,No kidding.going to be interesting

6649360,Bill Krejca,2022-04-20 06:02:00,6107,Beautiful!!! Bill
6649372,Eckohlt,2022-04-20 06:46:00,3685,With more snow up there today it's going to be more than interesting on when soft water fishing will start.
6649382,rosh1,2022-04-20 06:59:00,275,Looks like you had a great day. Thanks for pictures.
