6649872,Eckohlt,2022-04-22 05:06:00,3685,Ice should be out by then.
6650216,Bakefish,2022-04-23 09:13:00,1077,Lot's of rain coming down right now. That should help.
6650218,prov1800,2022-04-23 09:38:00,5010,"Got pouring rain here now.Can hear thunder pretty steady and very strong winds.Started yesterday but today is the worst.Talking 1 1/2"" so that's a lot.Shoyld knock the snow down some."
6650222,Eckohlt,2022-04-23 09:55:00,3685,4 weeks from today I believe the reefing of eyes begins.
6650230,Skywagon,2022-04-23 10:26:00,1106,"The ice has not done any melting yet, but with the the significant rain we are getting right now the snow will be leaving the lakes. The next part of the equation is to melt the top layer of frozen slush and get down to good ice, maybe next week, who knows. I pulled one of the shacks off earlier this week, will grab the other one when it melts down to good ice. Lots of time left for ice fishing."
6650234,stjoeguy,2022-04-23 10:28:00,979,"Here's a website from Sioux Lookout where you can watch the ice melt on Pelican Lake. If you look at the Live Webcam, there's a barrel out on the ice just to the right of the grill and just above the deck railing. Click on Overview and you can see the dates of the barrel sinking in past years. http://endofwinter.ca"
6650250,prov1800,2022-04-23 11:50:00,5010,That's the nicest ice shack I've ever fished from and the company was pretty good to.If I get my truck rolling and you need help getting the shack off let me know.
6650306,prov1800,2022-04-23 15:01:00,5010,Thx to Wayne Clark for sending me a couple of pics from his plane.Those pics are near McKenzie bay and the open water is the Shantie Narrows.Snow machine track headed into McKenzie bay
6650524,JAY221,2022-04-24 14:53:00,877,"I just hope their is 3-4 feet more water than last year as it had all left by the time I got there! Later, Jay"
6649634,bthomas3333,2022-04-21 09:55:00,465,"The melt sure looks behind schedule and the cold weather / snow doesn't help, but there is some good news that tends to get overlooked. ----- It's all about the sun angle this time of year. The higher the sun angle, the more direct sunlight we get and the warmer the temperature rises. At the start of winter the sun angle is only 27° which is why we get so cold in December and January. By today's date the sun angle rises to 36° and by the start of spring the sun angle is at 47°. So even though it might be cold, the sun is still doing it's work warming the ground/ice and melting some snow/ice. -------- Brett"

6649708,Lovetofish,2022-04-21 15:35:00,458,Should help bring the water level up some.
6649710,prov1800,2022-04-21 15:38:00,5010,Up here in the Vermilion Bay area ice is very much behind.About 2 weeks from what should be happening.Cold snaps and more snow has slowed it down.We do get above 0c/32f most days and will be mostly now.Still a few days showing up where nights dip to -9/-11.Those are bad and takes a couple of warm days to undo that as everything tightens back up.So it been up and down like that all winter.We also have a lot of gloomy days with no sun so slow melt then.But it's going to get warmer.Good news is that ice on the lakes also melt at water level under the ice.I can see that when I look down my ice fishing holes.Still lots of solid ice.Still have a week in April and then the 3 weeks in May.Will be interesting but have always got my boat in on many years like this.
6649732,Esoxmike,2022-04-21 16:50:00,114,"Very solid info,I have fished northern Quebec on the opener a few times,late ice out usually means a slow bite and high water but usually things start picking up at end of week.Contrary to popular opinion pike can be tough because they have already spawned and after that it takes warm bays to turn them on which is tough to find shortly after iceout on a high lake.usually once levels drop closer to ""normal"" and we see upper 50's to low 60's water temp then pike pick up.wally's will be predictable up rivers or in current areas,small males 1st then the big girls show up!"
6649738,Esoxmike,2022-04-21 16:53:00,114,"I got a may 23rd entry permit for mudro entry in the boundary waters canoe area this year,gonna head up to crooked lake and fish wally's and pike for 10 days,solo.Cant wait,hopefully ice is out a week or 2 before I go but it's locked up SOLID right now,fingers crossed!"
6649750,Fisherman Ted,2022-04-21 17:08:00,461,That's all well and good. But if it drops below freezing at night any damage done to the ice during the day will be minimalized. We need warm days and nights. And right now the 2 week forecast doesn't see much of that in the NW of Ontario. -FT
6649760,prov1800,2022-04-21 17:20:00,5010,Here's a snap shot of the weather next few days in Vermilion Bay.Rain will help but not the 3 below 0 nights.
6649780,Golden Eagle,2022-04-21 18:38:00,2642,Should be lots of moving water for you. Dragging boats over ice is better than carrying. If you don't break through the ice.
6649798,SweetD,2022-04-21 19:06:00,243,The heavier than normal snow cover should aid in the melt once the temps warm. That melt sitting on top of the ice coupled with some heavy wind could wreak havoc and quick! That’s the glass half full viewpoint for the day!For the outfitters that have been suffering for the past two seasons we should all be rooting for a big warm up so they can host their early clients and prepare for the rest of us that will be rolling North again!July 15 can not get here quick enough!!!!
6649474,guidedfishing,2022-04-20 12:31:00,531,"E You will have open water by June 13, now you may have to shovel snow out of your boat, maybe even chip your way out of the landing but you will have open water. I remember one opener I rolled through Kakabeka Falls it was 72 degrees late in the afternoon. by the time I rolled into Silver Dollar it was 32 and snowing hard. The next morning I put in it was 28 degree's with a 15-20 mph wind out of the north freezing up eyelets and spray to the boat. It felt like a episode of deadliest catch. I don't do openers anymore. June is soon enough. You will be fine."
6649480,prov1800,2022-04-20 13:16:00,5010,Just pushed couple of inches of wet stuff of my deck and cleaned my tv dishes which lost signal back after cleaning was good

A good long range weather prediction in early October will likely have me headed up yonder. My 2018 and 2019 October trips were less than great due to strong wind every day. I needed more than a full fuel tank in the bow to keep from blowing off course. Boats want to kite when heading into a brisk breeze."

6648318,Bill Krejca,2022-04-16 04:49:00,6107,"Remember 2 cases of camping and gathering ice/snow from a bay on opening day. One a situation on LOW in about 1980 where we filled our ice chests for the week, another, in Sask., 1970, where the ice was still in the bay, gathered ice/snow for ice chests. In both cases, fishing was slow for several days, but after a south wind, the fish went wild, and it was pure gravy. Prior to the warm breeze, many pike in Sask. were seen in bays just dormant, almost impossible to get them to commit to our baits. Times to remember!!! Bill"
6649116,Eckohlt,2022-04-19 04:43:00,3685,33 days until they sound the horn to start fishing!!
6649410,prov1800,2022-04-20 08:31:00,5010,33 days just doesn't sound long enough right now.
6649416,Fisherman Ted,2022-04-20 08:44:00,461,I agree. I have started moving my reservations at the open. -FT
6649438,Golden Eagle,2022-04-20 10:00:00,2642,"We're booked for May 18, but we have a plan B that has us in the air early May 28. Hope my other 7 guys can adjust their schedules. Time of change is a great time for a fisherman to be in NW Ontario."

6648166,Golden Eagle,2022-04-15 10:18:00,2642,"I'm supposed to touch down on May 18. Lake is shallow which will make it one of the first to turn soft. Short flight north of Red Lake. We expect to eat 26"" pikes the first 3 days. Lots of rain and warm cloudy days would help. Sunshine can cause melting snow to evaporate. Not good."

I didn't see any posts on this. Any predictions for north Eagle Lake (Vermilion Bay). I've heard that fishing right after ice out can be very good. Mike"

6647900,guidedfishing,2022-04-14 11:46:00,531,"A lot can happen between now and the opener, very few times by the opener there has not been at least some open water to fish. This weeks weather is not our friend and gives us little to hold on to that your prediction would not be fairly spot on at best. At some point mother nature will catch up quick, she usually does."
6647996,martinbns,2022-04-14 19:01:00,1520,We have quite a ways to go before ice out. Lots of snow.
6648102,prov1800,2022-04-15 08:34:00,5010,Hope Goŕd is right.But I still drove out on lake yesterday and there is plenty of ice.Long range for 2 weeks shòws below zerò all though there are a few warm days .nothing much happens till it's zero overnights.With the cold here and a fresh layer of a foot of snow sets us back a bit.Hoping for a heat wave.It can come anytime.

We knew we were screwed when we got to Duluth and saw Lake Superior still iced in. Ice finally broke up after a big blow on the second night. We still bounced off ice going up the lake and only made it halfway to where we wanted to be. Just another memory from days gone by. PjShorthorn"
6648152,prov1800,2022-04-15 10:08:00,5010,As a local guy I know what's going on.Usually around now we would be having to be carefull getting on and off the ice.Thats not even close to happening.Actually with temps and new snowfall we are set back now a couple of weeks and no zero celsius nights which are needed.Unless something happens like a heat wave its going to be interesting.There will be open water in spots.Have fished before dodging ice flows.
