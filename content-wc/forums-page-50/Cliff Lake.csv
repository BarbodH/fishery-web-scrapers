Maybe this is the year I can figure them out. Please keep us posted on ice conditions up there - I can't wait! Denny"
6652066,prov1800,2022-04-28 21:49:00,5010,Ice is still good and will be for some time yet.Temps warming so now melting will be faster.Lake trout are not hard to catch.
6652176,prov1800,2022-04-29 08:11:00,5010,I usually have some earlier arrivals come up hoping to get a couple of days of trout fishing on Cliff before walleye opens and some early smallmouth as well.Spring tends to have some trout shallow.
6652184,Eckohlt,2022-04-29 08:25:00,3685,"After today,22 days."
6652204,N_of_Quibell,2022-04-29 09:11:00,151,"PROV1800 - I'll admit I pretty inexperienced, but I have not had very good luck with trout on Cliff. BTW, I think I met you coming of Cliff years ago at the 105 landing - you took one look at the canoe on top of my truck and graciously suggested a more sheltered landing, which I've used mutliple times since. If that was you, thanks for the good advice. Denny"
6652224,prov1800,2022-04-29 09:51:00,5010,Have met a number of people at hwy landing and somewhat remember a canoe in the conversation.If I was in a white lund it was probably me.If I suggested the Deer Lake Rd to launch on and you did that glad we talked.
6652322,N_of_Quibell,2022-04-29 16:03:00,151,"Yep, Deer Lake Rd it was. If you see a little old guy bobbing around in a Grumman sportboat in a few weeks, it will likely be me. Thanks for the good advice. Denny"
6652328,prov1800,2022-04-29 16:56:00,5010,Hope I see you Denny.I will be out there a few times.
6652456,maddogg,2022-04-30 08:06:00,178,I don't know if this is true or not.But the department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada wants all ice fishing houses off the lake by July 2nd.
