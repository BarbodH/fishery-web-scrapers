6652718,Pooch,2022-05-01 07:10:00,4618,The strap looks like the cats meow for that application. Are there camp boats like that in Canada? I've never seen a plank seat other than Europe or way back in my youth on pond boats. Pooch
6652070,skimottaret,2022-04-29 01:45:00,40,"Im looking to buy a portable boat seat for use on rental boats and wanted to get some recommendations. Needs to be light, easy to fix to bench seat, mesh would be good and sturdy. Been on some in Canada on Portage lakes but can't recall the make or model. Any recommendations gladly received."

6652314,MotorPike,2022-04-29 15:14:00,5,"Check out some of the ""stadium seats"" for sitting on bleachers. Definitely lightweight and around 20 bucks. Different styles and different ways to attach. I've used them without attaching and bodyweight alone gives you some back support."
6652396,New Guy Bill,2022-04-30 00:46:00,7,"I can full heartily recommend these seats from Tempress. They are amazing. Seriously!https://tempress.com/store/All-Weath...Seat-p97903116Your tender tushy with thank you after sitting the whole day and slaughtering the walleyes. Comfortable cushion.Also get the tempress quick disconnected swivel kit and bring along a screwdriver to mount your seat to the the wood topper of the boat seat. 4 screws and you are golden. Those Cuda Clamps are garbage, dont bother with them.I have used these seats for over 20 years. You will thank me later."
6652398,skimottaret,2022-04-30 01:53:00,40,"Thanks guys, all good suggestions will get googling !Do the stadium seats allow you to ""swivel"" looks like they are typically clipped in to the seat.Can't use screws as the boats I am using are day rentals.Best one I have seen is this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlCHEWcYDTI but can't find in stock anywhere and was wondering if any US based manufacturers. I like the come along straps"

6652424,Eckohlt,2022-04-30 06:08:00,3685,Where's everyone going where there are no boat seats?portage lakes?
6652432,skimottaret,2022-04-30 06:18:00,40,"Ah that is the exact one I have used, saw the logo in an old photo. will look into mounting.Pooch - the boats I use have simple planks for seats. If you ever fish in the Highlands of Scotland you get something like these boats https://scouriehotel.com/salmon-sea-trout-loch-stack/ or on English waters like this https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-mo...-48418814.html"
