I'm trying to find him a ride or a flight from Sioux Lookout to International Falls. I haven't been able to locate a service that does this. I don't think Uber is in Sunset Country yet! If any of you know a way to get back to I-Falls on June 29th, please let me know."

Not your destination of choice but gets him to another point of entry. Guess it depends on where you all go through and if you are willing to adjust Eastward? Maybe they have something that goes to International Falls that I did not see. I would inquire with your outfitter or others in the area as surely this is not a first. Also, if Sioux Lookout has a chamber of commerce maybe they can point you in the right direction?Good luck"
