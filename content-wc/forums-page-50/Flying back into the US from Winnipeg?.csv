6651430,5thsuit,2022-04-27 08:52:00,54,"Do you need a negative test to board the plane? Will a Antigen test work or do they require the more expensive PCR test which requires a longer waiting time? Can you get the test done at the Winnipeg airport or nearby? Is there a testing location in Red Lake? Most of our group drives across the border and this is not an issue, but a couple of our guys fly in and this is looking like a possible problem with quick turn around times returning. Might have to consider changing flight into Mpls if this is a big problem?"
6651442,Cgillespie,2022-04-27 08:59:00,120,I'm curious about this as well. We are flying from Winnipeg to Minneapolis to get home. Can we just bring an at-home test with us?
6651446,wmd,2022-04-27 09:05:00,388,Google US Customs and Border Patrol. All the information you need is on that website. wmd
6651548,5thsuit,2022-04-27 13:26:00,54,Looks like the test is needed and they accept the rapid test! There is a testing location in the Winnipeg airport open 7 days a week from 330am - 4pm. Cost is $59. Sorry wmd but I found the US Customs and Border Patrol site pretty useless.
6651564,proguidedream,2022-04-27 14:59:00,345,can also get a rapid test at any shoppers drug mart in Winnipeg with appointment. hopefully you do not need a test by the time your trip is
6651588,Old Timer,2022-04-27 16:56:00,255,"Not to be a Debbie Downer, but what happens if you test positive at the airport? Gotta know about that situation too."

6651722,RichA$1970,2022-04-28 04:06:00,1159,Complete BS by the US requiring this. I am flying back to the states on May 12 and hope it is lifted based on Dr Farceâ€™s comments.
