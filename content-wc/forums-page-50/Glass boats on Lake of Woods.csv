6650334,Old Timer,2022-04-23 16:20:00,255,"Bill is spot on with those government maps for LOTW. There are three or four connecting maps that cover the entire lake. Back in the early 70s that's all we had for our travels between The Angle and Kenora. There are amazingly accurate. Even with the chip I still have the maps on my dash when taking trips through passages new to me. And I always look behind me for snags, eagle trees and white rocks that help guide me on my return trip."
6650392,muskyman73,2022-04-23 21:03:00,401,"Just read the maps before you go, watch your electronics and read the maps - again. Doesn't hurt to have a passenger on the same page as you watching the map as you drive. Hit a log up there one year that was not very visible, the extra eyes would have been great at that time."
6650516,Timmer92,2022-04-24 13:46:00,451,"Rocks are an issue in many of my favorite lakes here in Minnesota. You can bang up a boat whether it's fiberglass or aluminum. It's been very rare that I hit rocks with the boat itself. Props on the other hand, are a different story. For my last boat I ultimately owned three props. One on the motor, one in the boat for a spare, and one back home either being repaired or on a shelf having come back from repair. How I got to owning 3 in the first place was having to buy a third after managing to ruin 2 in a single long weekend!"
6650554,Baseline,2022-04-24 17:01:00,3207,"I've fished the US section, Morson, Nestor Falls, Whitefish Bay and Kenora and there are lots glass boats running on all sections. It is all buoyed and when you get off the marked trail ""go slow till you know""....."

6650774,kswalleyer,2022-04-25 10:54:00,1651,"I would't be there without my glass boat. slow down, get a good paper map as has been discussed, turn on ""tracks"" on graph and just go figure it out."
6650802,h8go4s,2022-04-25 13:29:00,1673,"""..How I got to owning 3 in the first place was having to buy a third after managing to ruin 2 in a single long weekend! __________________Timmer All of the tools, some of the skills!..""Made me laugh. Getting those skills can be expensive. I got lucky once running across Rainy into the sun, slight chop, didn't see the beaver log until it was too late. No damage, just a few extra heartbeats. I hauled the log into the boat and dropped it at a windward sand beach."
6650830,Riding high,2022-04-25 14:59:00,69,Nothing wrong with taking a glass boat. One guy with us has a big fancy ranger. Brought it for years. LOW maps are good. Marked safe routes. When not on one just look at the paper maps. Get a good card for your gps. He will be fine.
6651140,lassh,2022-04-26 11:33:00,553,"Yes, I would agree with the general consensus that you're much more likely to ding your prop than run aground and we don't usually have to pull up on shore. Also the trip in and out is well marked and electronics makes it much safer and easier. If I had a glass boat I would take it and be careful, just like I do with my tin boat. However, it is the owner's prerogative and he needs to make that risk based decision. Interesting that I posted a SS vs. Al prop question for LOW a year or two ago and the preponderance of replies at that time was to leave the SS prop on. The responses to this post so far appear to support changing to the Al prop for this trip. What y'all think?"
6651198,rjthehunter,2022-04-26 15:25:00,154,I'd keep the stainless one on. Just plan on not hitting anything and you'll be just fine!
6650060,That Minnesota guy,2022-04-22 14:48:00,8293,If he is unsure of the layout of that section of the lake I suggest moderate speed. From experience I can tell you those reefs move fast when coming at you.
6650068,Old Timer,2022-04-22 15:31:00,255,"Lassh: As I recall, it's about 20 miles from the Morson Marina in Hanson's Bay to Spruce Island Camp. The track should be shown on your GPS map from Morson to the tug channel. There are red/green buoys along the entire track. I peel off the track ahead of the channel and into Sabaskosing Bay using the north entrance. That's all good water. But I suspect you knew this already."
6650070,walleyecheek,2022-04-22 15:50:00,2231,You mean Sabaskong bay ?
6650102,Old Timer,2022-04-22 17:11:00,255,Sabaskosing Bay is northwest of Sabaskong Bay by 20-25 miles.
6650172,walleyecheek,2022-04-23 06:14:00,2231,You dont see alot of guides fishing out of glass boats in Canada ! There's a reason why !
6650174,Bill Krejca,2022-04-23 06:20:00,6107,"Echo what the other forks have shared. The best advice I can give is to have a good govt issued map (6212) and always look at it before moving to a new spot. Most of the reefs are shown on the map, but few reefs are actually marked with buoys. GPS charts are great, but generally can better show the ""trees rather than the forest"". Same advice if using a metal boat. Bill"
6650180,That Minnesota guy,2022-04-23 06:41:00,8293,8You mean other than 99% of glass boats are built & sold in the US? Before Ranger attacked the market in Mpls & St. Paul you didn't see many in Minnesota. That was in the mid to late 80's I believe.
6650208,Jakerides,2022-04-23 08:42:00,223,"Sand beaches are very rare in that area. Keel protection isn't enough if pulled up on rock for shore lunch. Boat waves cause rocking side to side which will chew up gel coat on sides of boat. I would anchor off shore and have buddy with tin boat take me to shore for lunch. Always ran with stainless prop, always super slow near shore with motor tilted up. When trolling jerk bait's near shore used electric trolling motor it would hit rocks every so often always had a spare prop but never broke one. Did this before GPS map and after they were available remember early GPS was not very accurate. Nowadays piece of cake navigation. Go for it. Wayne"
6650214,Eckohlt,2022-04-23 09:00:00,3685,"The guy worrying about that glass boat all week and white knuckle driving around lotw all week,I think I would just use a camp boat,alittle less stress on that glass boat owner."
6650232,txk4,2022-04-23 10:27:00,31,"Interesting discussion. When we first started going up to LOW/Flag Island 20+ years ago, all we saw was aluminum boats. If you had a Lund Alaskan you had the perfect boat it seemed. There was one resident on Flag that had a Stratos and when he stopped by everyone came down to look at the fancy fiberglass boat. Now, the number of fiberglass boats that you see has dramatically increased. Well over half the boats that make it to the resort are fiberglass, and many of the residents run glass, including several of the guides. The dollar value per boat slip has increased dramatically. The aluminum prop vs stainless debate is active and common. I would use what makes you feel most comfortable. It is probably more important to have a good mapping chip and use common sense and caution. We have developed a system of using one of those elastic anchor ropes for going to shore. Dropping it while heading in, letting it stretch, easing up to the rocks, getting out and than letting the elastic rope take the boat out a little and tying off the bow. The boat stays off the rocks and can be pulled in to load up. While sand beaches are not everywhere, they are available if you look. Once you have a couple of safe tracks down on you GPS it is easier to start to explore. If the GPS chips had not come along, I would probably still be fishing in sight of the island. Pretty soon you will be taking a day trip to Kenora. Spruce Island is in a great area and I am sure you will have a great trip but remember that eventually everyone hits something on LOW. For your buddy, it may come down to if he will be OK with that possibility or will he be a nervous wreck worrying about his boat all week. Don't catch them all!"
6649986,lassh,2022-04-22 11:47:00,553,"I invited a friend who has a fiberglass Ranger Reatta boat, to go an a lake of the Woods trip in the Spruce Island area of LOW. He doesn't think he should take a fiberglass boat to LOW. Do many folks use fiberglass boats on LOW? I know one has to be careful of rocks but how severe is the risk?"
6649990,That Minnesota guy,2022-04-22 12:15:00,8293,"Personally I don't worry about it. Bumping a rock is part of the adventure. I'm assuming he has a keel guard. Todays maps are marked pretty well, just go slow anytime you get near shore. Sticks & jugs will mark shallow rocks. Best advice is to go slow and make sure your insurance is paid."
6649996,guidedfishing,2022-04-22 12:28:00,531,"Well on the flip side glass boats are much easier to repair. Glass boat guys can get a little nervous about smacking up the gel coat. You can wreck just about anything if you hit it hard enough... If he is not going to be beaching it everyday, probably no worse for the wear. I prefer my dinged up bottom on my tin boat, I don't take the rocks so personal anymore.."
6650004,rjthehunter,2022-04-22 13:00:00,154,I wouldn't worry about it. Be smart about it. Certainly make sure your insurance is paid!Having a glass boat hasn't kept me off of LOTW
6650014,DeBo,2022-04-22 13:41:00,211,Driven a glass boat all over the shield with 0 worries. I do suggest not bringing your good SS prop and use a cheap aluminum prop. And bring a spare. Aluminum props are batter about not bending prop shafts and what not in a rock strike.
6650026,Pezman38,2022-04-22 13:56:00,3196,Bring your glass boat and love it. But do get a aluminum prop! great advice here.
6650034,proguidedream,2022-04-22 14:01:00,345,it is easily navigable with an updated map and a smart captain.. just dont guess on a marker bouy if you dont know.. and if it looks shallow it probably is. some lodges run all glass boats even as rentals for guests
6650050,Old Timer,2022-04-22 14:38:00,255,"I have friends who use their glass boats on LOTW. Yes, they choose an aluminum prop for the reasons suggested above. And they never pull up along a rocky shoreline. Instead, they search out a sandy beach."
6650052,Knutson21,2022-04-22 14:40:00,348,I fish my 1850 Ranger Reata on Lake of the Woods all the time. I even pull it up on shore to have shore lunch. I do have a keel guard that came on it from factory.
6650058,Eckohlt,2022-04-22 14:44:00,3685,If the insurance is paid he can go fast.
