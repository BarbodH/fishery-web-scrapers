His 35 year old weed found in vehicle search got us special attention which uncovered another party member that had a 9.5 year old dui. The dui holder was not allowed in. I'm told 10 years beyond the conviction date they usually let you in so long as you present half way decent. The rest of us were allowed in."
6651922,Old Timer,2022-04-28 13:35:00,255,There seem to be guidelines that Canada customs follow when deciding whether to let a DUI traveler into the country. The best I can figure there are no guarantees. Each customs station and each border agent has discretion on how and if to apply the guidelines. Some travelers with a past serious offense have no problem crossing over while others are denied intermittently. And then some are denied every time. So call the tele number provided above. Not sure any poster here has the definitive answer.
6651928,Walleye2242,2022-04-28 13:45:00,263,"100% agree. from the groups personal experience i feel no matter who you call, what your told, what you pay, what paper work you fill out and even if you paid everything you were told and filled out everything you were told it still comes down to the person at the booth when your time comes up to talk."
6651934,proguidedream,2022-04-28 14:25:00,345,"jeeeeeezuz ,,, i know it was a common thing back in the day to have a couple and drive home. but any grown man getting a DUI in this common era should accept the punishment that goes with it. they cant make it any easier nowadays with taxi-uber etc all having apps for your phone. Even a guy in our town thought he could make it 2 blocks home from the bar, ended up cutting off a car crossing main street, they swerved hit a curb and flipped the car. lucky its a slower zone and no major injuries..."
6651958,Luckydawg13,2022-04-28 15:44:00,363,So you guys are saying that if you have a past DUI even 20 30 years ago you can't go into Canada I have never Heard of this
6652000,RichA$1970,2022-04-28 18:17:00,1159,"Check out the All Canada Show website / newsletter as there used to be a Canadian Lawyer who would advertise on DUI assistance for entry. After tasting LaCrapp’s, I mean LaBatt’s, I’d tell the immigration agent no worries on drinking as I can’t see how anyone could hack that pisswater."
6652002,Eckohlt,2022-04-28 18:30:00,3685,"Rich,back in my 20's that pisswater made my legs stop working many times,I would have more empty beer cans in the boat than jig heads most days,thank god I had enough brain cells left to quit."
6652064,New Guy Bill,2022-04-28 21:46:00,7,"Spoke with CBSA today. Got the skinny.A DUI or similar crime, is not a misdemeanor in Canada and is treated as to whichever is the equivalent crime under the Canadian Criminal code.If you have 1 and only 1 DUI, and its less than 5 years from the end of sentencing. You can not enter.5-10 years TRP is required. Ahead of time through a Canadian consulate for a multiple entry pass. Or a single entry TRP COULD be obtained at a land port of entry. Consulate Fee $200. One time free at PoEover 10 year, you could be deemed rehabilitated, UNLESS you were charged with a DUI December 2018 or later. So we are talking Dec 2028 and onward. the 10 year rehabilitation rule is no longer valid due to a change in the Canada criminal code in 2018.Anyone who may have entered Canada with a DUI or Battery, less than 10 years may have just been lucky and got away with it, was never questioned directly and or was not honest in their answers.If you get caught, you may not be able to enter ever going forward. Be prepared and be honest CBSA told me. Dont become a story for the Border Security TV Show. Plan ahead.I was given this site with lots a great current information and could help you out.https://www.canadaduientrylaw.com/"
6652604,reddemon2,2022-04-30 17:48:00,255,An Agent can turn anyone away regardless of any crime. If you look funny he/she could say NO ENTRY
6652684,walleyecheek,2022-05-01 05:14:00,2231,"Like i said , 1 in our group got an OWI in '99 and has been crossing ever since , except the last couple years because of covid. Now one would think that the ""agent"" would see that on his record. I guess he didn't look to funny &#x1f923;"
6651630,Mark R,2022-04-27 18:53:00,1538,What is current procedure for getting into Ontario with a 2 year old DUI
6651694,3M TA3,2022-04-27 21:01:00,2846,"Start by getting a lawyer. Might help, but doubtful."
6651712,New Guy Bill,2022-04-27 23:32:00,7,"Sorry, aint going to happen. Dont even try.After 5years you can apply for a TRP Temporary Resident Permit at the border.After 10 years, you will be deemed rehabilitated. No permit needed. Guess its Alaska for a while for you.https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpce...qnum=152&top=8"
6651728,walleyecheek,2022-04-28 04:49:00,2231,oh yeah ? When did they change that ? 1 of the characters in our group got a dui in 99' and even went that same year and every year after that until covid hit.
6651760,nitroman,2022-04-28 06:43:00,368,Call this number and ask for Kevin. 807-274-5281. They can help you out.
6651774,Walleye2242,2022-04-28 06:57:00,263,"Man....this is a tough deal. a DUI is a huge deal getting across the border as we all know. I think with 1 DUI there can be more leeway and options. If you have 2...never ever try again. With that being said...we had 2 guys in our group with a DUI and they came up for years and years and never ever had an issue. Another guy had a batter charge but he came up for about 15 years with no issues. One year....we were crossing and they were turned away. The guy with the batter charge said he was just in canada by toronto and had no issues. this guy did not care. Since that year they have tried a few other time, always with backup plans on rainy lake in Int. falls area and good thing they did as they never wee allowed to cross again."
6651776,kettyspanky,2022-04-28 07:07:00,271,All I'd say is call the number nitroman has supplied. Otherwise put the individual in a separate vehicle and he better have a back-up plan if he gets refused. Call the border office where you are going to cross and ask them. I'm sure there is more info on this in another forum. Good luck.
6651786,CI_Guy,2022-04-28 07:20:00,2118,"The amount of information in government data bases and the ability to access them have changed dramatically in 23 years. How much of that data the US and Canada share with each other also changed after 9/11/2001. Before 9/11 we had 2 guys in our group, one had a DUI and the other had an old assault charge that never had a problem crossing the border. After 9/11 they were refused entry twice then gave up trying to get into Canada."
6651852,rockape,2022-04-28 09:50:00,215,"I have a friend from Colorado that is coming for the first time with us in 20 years. He got a DUI wayyyyy back. He had 2 years probation. As long as it is 10 years since the probation ended or other sentence, you are good. The guard told me for him to get a letter from the county that he completed his rehabilitation, all is cool. We may not need the letter since it has been over 11 years, but she said to have it just in case the guard at crossing wants to see it."
6651860,nitroman,2022-04-28 10:10:00,368,Again call this number and ask for Kevin. 807-274-5281. When guests ask us at sports shows about this issue I always refer them as these guys can give you assurance as to weather you are truly good to go or help you out with what you need to do. Unless this number has changed as i have not had anyone call it for 2 years now due to obvious reasons they will help.
