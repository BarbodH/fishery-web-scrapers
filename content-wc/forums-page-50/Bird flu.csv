6643698,btyreprich,2022-03-28 07:09:00,1067,"I want to say that eggs coming from Indiana and another state were prohibited a few years ago. As I used to live in Chicago area, most of the eggs I saw in local grocery stores came from Indiana so I did not buy those. Eventually located eggs that came from Michigan. Not sure if the Canadian government still has a list of states to prohibit eggs from. I do all of the shopping for our group and have to say we have never been challenged or questioned about our groceries when entering Canada. The Canadian border guards always ask about live bait, booze, and guns. I always have our grocery receipts but haven't been asked to show them."

6643736,Eckohlt,2022-03-28 09:27:00,3685,I think the border has more to wry about than a frikin egg.
6643738,Walleye2242,2022-03-28 09:29:00,263,I would surely think so.
