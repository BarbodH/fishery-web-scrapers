Put those other big Canadian name brand beers to shame.Creemore is right up there on my go to list. as is Granville Island Winter Ale. Nectar boys, pure nectar."

6652560,walleyecheek,2022-04-30 14:58:00,2231,I go to CANADA to drink beer not coffee (although i do have coffee in the morning. Crannog's taste like coffee with a hint of Chocolate ! It's a lady's drink &#x1f923;
6652628,New Guy Bill,2022-04-30 18:59:00,7,"Ummm, BHoG is a stout. But dont tell the Irish stout is a Lady's drink. Thats a bar fight for another day."

6651762,Jeff Sterner,2022-04-28 06:43:00,1,Blue and Kokanee for me!
6651768,eyecatcher1,2022-04-28 06:51:00,323,Moosehead
6651782,kettyspanky,2022-04-28 07:09:00,271,Blue or moosehead works for us.
6651926,Shorelunch,2022-04-28 13:41:00,554,"100% Blue Light in a bottle. However, it's cans only the past few years at duty free (at least in Baudette/I Falls)."
6651952,Eckohlt,2022-04-28 15:33:00,3685,I'll belly up for a ice cold root.
6652116,v-bay gord,2022-04-29 06:29:00,3168,I've had it and it's terrible.
6652198,nitroman,2022-04-29 08:43:00,368,Well i will still try it but mostly i want a can to put in my display case as a fan of the show! Molson is for the after fishing drink!
6652250,pjshorthorn,2022-04-29 11:23:00,5654,You sure it wasn't sitting on the shelf in the fish cleaning house for a few years ? PjShorthorn
6652376,RichA$1970,2022-04-29 21:35:00,1159,Importing Corona anytime as Canadian beer sucks however at least they can distill whiskey quite well.
6651394,nitroman,2022-04-27 07:55:00,368,"Mines Molson Canadian, Kokanee, Blue. This year as I am a big fan of Letterkenny I am going to try and find a 12er of Puppers to try."
6651400,Walleye2242,2022-04-27 08:03:00,263,was Blue and Kokanee but now I just do not drink beer. Not a beer in the past 20 some years. I am mixed drink guy for some reason.
6651406,Stehle1,2022-04-27 08:08:00,22,"I have always gone with Labatts Blue. Molson is too sweet like Bud is. My house beer is Yuengling but beer fridge usually has a variety of IPAs and such. Usually small brewers from my home state or area (Jackie O's, Big Timber, etc)"
6651450,Laketripper,2022-04-27 09:13:00,103,"Great Western Classic ,Original 16 Copper Ale, Alexander Keith."
6651452,wmd,2022-04-27 09:15:00,388,"I am a Blue fan, Molsons is ok as is Kokanee. wmd"
6651644,WalleyeTherapy,2022-04-27 19:30:00,49,Elsinore then Labatts Blue
6651650,621Dreamer,2022-04-27 19:37:00,40,Creemore Premium Lager !!
6651732,Clairebear,2022-04-28 05:12:00,937,"What he said, Creemore hands down. A small micro brewery in Ontario which was rated as number one for many years. Bought out by Molson a few years ago but it seems they haven't changed a thing except it isn't available in the 500ml brown glass bottle any more."
6651738,pjshorthorn,2022-04-28 05:37:00,5654,Ahhhhhh ..another Letterkenny fan . Your beer selection lines up as well. We could definitely fish together ..LOL. I literally tried to find Puppers in different LCBOs and Beer Stores on a trip back in 2019. No luck. I think it may be sold online though. PjShorthorn
