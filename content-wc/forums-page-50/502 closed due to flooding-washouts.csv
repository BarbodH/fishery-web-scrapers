6650976,Pooch,2022-04-26 02:15:00,4618,Most years we are pretty well done with planting in our area. This year not much of anything planted. Freeze warning last night and tonight. Wife's perennial flowers are taking a serious hit this morning. At least it isn't snowing... yet. Pooch
6650992,7 Mag,2022-04-26 05:13:00,1887,"That looks horrible, It will probably just turn hot and bypass spring this year."
6651006,Skywagon,2022-04-26 05:55:00,1106,"The flooding thing is not uncommon, we still have lots of snow, it blocks the water flow and the culverts. About half way up 502 from Ft Frances on the west side of the road there is storage building for salt that sits off the road, there is a tall tower there that can be seen for miles, my guess that is for their repeater. As a side note, all communications I have been around here are VHS because of the terrain. All the wood haulers and logging equipment have them, I take a VHS radio sometimes if I am going to be on a haul road that is being used, as you never know who is coming over the hill or around the next curve."
6651280,Pooch,2022-04-26 19:28:00,4618,"When you say VHF radio, are you talking CB radio? Commercial VHF is licensed for a specific user and a specific frequency. I just renewed our VHF license with the FCC. We are using a business band and license is required. Most public safety is licensed business band VHF though now it is much more sophisticated with rotating frequencies. VHF is basically line of sight. My radio knowledge is outdated, but the basics are the same. Antenna height is your friend. Same as marine band. Keep the snow up there partner! Pooch"
6651346,Skywagon,2022-04-27 05:03:00,1106,"Pooch, like you back in a different life I had UHF business band radios with my own tower and repeater. What I was talking about are the VHF business band radios, as you know, like UHF they require an FCC license, they are high wattage compared to CB and of course different frequencies. To be honest I do not know the legal requirement to use these here in Canada, they may be regulated differently, all I know is everyone roaming the bush roads has one and I never hear anything about license (I don't have one).We did get another inch of snow Monday night. I am heading down 502 to Ft Frances this morning for a couple day conference, am sure the road will be fine now. When I get back I'll be on the lake fishing, what will you be doing?"

6650772,Eckohlt,2022-04-25 10:48:00,3685,You making ice up there now john??
6650780,stjoeguy,2022-04-25 11:09:00,979,I hope they're getting some of that rain north of Sioux Lookout!
6650842,prov1800,2022-04-25 15:39:00,5010,Yup -7 this morning and -11 tonight and bit warmer following day.Then starts looking better.So 3 weeks to get rid of ice.Might happen got to stay positive right.
6650846,Eckohlt,2022-04-25 16:03:00,3685,Right!
6650866,prov1800,2022-04-25 17:13:00,5010,got lots of rain for 2 days everything is soaked here thats why 502 is flooding.water over 105 just norh of me.still snowing now.depressing
6650872,Pooch,2022-04-25 17:23:00,4618,"Got me to thinking.... After a storm do they fly 502 and other semi remote roads where there are known problem areas? What happens on a road like 502 if a tractor trailer encounters a washout? There are darned few places where a large rig could turn around or even back very far without encountering traffic. How do road crews monitor a stretch like that without any communications? Are there radio repeaters for first responders operating in heavily traveled remote areas like 502? Satellite phones? When they are doing major repairs in remote areas, can they use portable repeaters? Just curious. Pooch"
6650878,prov1800,2022-04-25 17:42:00,5010,They have guys patrolling hwys 24/7 and with today's modern technology theres many ways to communicate.There woukd be a guy coming from fort francis and one from dryden to keep patrolling there section.Sat phones cb radios that truckers are on reach far.a Garmin inreach works anywhere to text.
6650892,Eckohlt,2022-04-25 18:05:00,3685,The interesting spring is looking more interesting everyday.
