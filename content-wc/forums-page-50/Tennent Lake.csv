6647890,Spartan1,2022-04-14 11:01:00,46,New to the forum. I booked a fly-in out of Nakina for later this summer to Tennent Lake. I see there have been a couple of really old posts. Wondering if anyone has been there in the last year of so and had any tips or strategy they would be willing to share. Thanks and tight lines everyone!!!
6648016,HeHooksHimself,2022-04-14 21:33:00,725,"We had a group of six to Tennant through Twin Lakes Outfitter go a few years back. Not a lot of action on Tennant. Had to go down river to the next lake or in the river, but we caught hundreds of walleyes. I think the next lake down river is kag something but we did very well. Lots of rocks in the river so be careful. The boats only have 9.9 Mercs, so you kind of just bang off of them but the current can throw you a little bit. We went in June and black flies were vicious. One other guy and me seemed to get them worse than the others, so it might just be me, but I suffered. MNR visited us and we had a mismeasured 19 incher in the freezer that cost one of us a couple hundred CDN so measure carefully Fish On! Hooks"
6648040,Spartan1,2022-04-15 06:21:00,46,Thank you for the reply and information. We are going back to Twin Lakes after a few years with other outfitters. We have 6 guys going into Tennant in early August. I understand most of the fishing is on the east end of the lake which your information confirms. Thanks for the information about navigating the river and all of the rocks. Hitting one of those is a easy way to ruin a good day!
6648044,Stickman8474,2022-04-15 06:37:00,39,"Can't help you on specifics of Tennent Lake but I can provide information of general area. As part of the Kapitongwa (sp?) River system, Tennent being furthest upstream, feeds into Kap Lake, which then feeds to Melchett Lake. There's a outlet from Melchett that feeds to Briarcliff Lake but it's interrupted by rapids. Access between these lakes is dependent on water level. Lot of rocks in some places. We were on Melchett with Boreal Forest Outfitters last year and had good success. We tried going upstream to Kap (which I've heard good things about, too) from Melchett, but it ultimately meant considerable ""wet"" work at the Kap outlet, which honestly, we just weren't prepared for (no hip boots). I have heard that Tennent access to Kap can be challenging but again I'm sure, water level is key. I believe your the only camp on Tennent. Kap lake has two camps and Melchett just has the one. So, there are possible optional waters to fish but it comes with sacrificing ""total"" isolation as you may encounter other fishermen. There is also a canoe route on the Kap system and there is a low percentage chance a canoe or two may be seen. That being said, we didn't see anyone other than ourselves last year. The area is fantastic on the whole. Walleyes everywhere and I strongly believe, bigger pike than given credit for. Wolves calling every night. Good moose habitat, especially between lakes. You should have a great time. Looking forward to reading your report when you return."
6649626,acplumber,2022-04-21 09:35:00,80,We went to Melchett on our last trip. can help with some spots if you'd like from my experiences. there's another guy on here that I haven't seen around much onetimedave. he was very helpful
6649630,Spartan1,2022-04-21 09:43:00,46,"Thank you. I 'd really appreciate any insight you would be willing to share. Its all new to me so if you have any location information or ""hot spots"" you can recommend that would be great. Not sure if you have them saved in a GPS but GPS coordinates are amazing. I thank you in advance for your wisdom and insight. Tight lines!!"

6649764,bester,2022-04-21 17:40:00,18,"I'll be on Melchett August 12th-19th, if your touring around stop by and say hi. This will be our third time there, 2018 we were able to get to Kap, 2020 we couldn't."
6649878,Spartan1,2022-04-22 05:35:00,46,I leave Tennant the day you arrive! I'll leave a list of the hot spots tacked to the tree.
6650164,bester,2022-04-23 05:57:00,18,"sounds good, I doubt will make it that far but will defiantly try for Kap again."
