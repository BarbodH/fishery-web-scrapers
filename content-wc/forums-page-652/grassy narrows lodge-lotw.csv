565530,Guest,2007-05-23 18:25:00,0,"Was at Miles Bay the last 4 days at Rex Tolton's. I have an 18 foot boat and we got into Obabikon with the trolling motor on high and my buddy on the rocks pulling on a rope. There is one tight spot with shallow rocks and current but once you work through it there is no problem. You could also get out and probably walk the boat through the shallow spot. It was a fun adventure but we only went for pike and they just were not very active. The walleye fishing was great in Miles Bay despite a 30 degree temperature drop from Friday to Saturday. Rocky, windswept points and shorelines seemed to be best. Chartreuse 1/8 oz jigs and minnows worked well. Pike were a bit of a challenge because the weeds weren't up and the fish seemed to not be in the bays or at least not feeding if they were. Miles is the only place you need to fish if you are seeking walleyes, pike and smallmouth. In fact we saw several guide boats this year and last who made the trip from Sabaskong to Miles for walleye. Grassy Narrows is in a nice location and looks like a nice camp. Key to finding the active walleyes is to cover a lot of ground until you find them. Another great tip is to keep an eye on the guide boats as they make a living putting people on fish. Good luck!"

564346,rockpt,2007-04-06 10:52:00,589,"You have to go into Whitefish Bay for lakers, and that's a long way from Grassy. Plus you have to go over the boat lift at Turtle Portage, and I understand the lift is often broken."
