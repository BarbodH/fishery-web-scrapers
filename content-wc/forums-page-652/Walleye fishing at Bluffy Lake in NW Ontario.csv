Boated over 175 Walleyes everyday except 1 and that's because the weather was horrible and we decided to play cards for awhile and drink that Blue stuff. The 2 of us had a blast with the help of our fine hosts, Keith & Deb. Great place and great people for sure. Would recommend the lodge to everyone!!!!"

565705,Roger Benoit,2007-05-30 11:51:00,93,Bluffy is a spring time Lake. Too shallow for any decent summer action. July rolls around and the fish disappear. Was there in late July 2005 and the fishing was OK. Not what I would have expected from this lake and location. You can drive to the camp now but cant take your own boat unless other improvements have been made. Only reason you can drive to it now is the due to the logging activity around the lake has brought the road close to the camp. Roger

Also been there quite a few times late August early September and had excellent fishing. Reasonably priced, nice people, good boats, lots of fishing room. Only time its been slow is when I went once in late September and once in October when everyone was bear hunting. I'd like to take my own boat on the lake, but Keith prefers that not happen, or maybe there are local rules on that kind of activity. Overall, very satisfied customer, just wish I had more time to go."

We found them trolling and jigging in anywhere from 10 to 25 feet. My fifth trip up and the quality of fish increases every year. We boated a number of fish in the 25-28 inch range, with plenty of good eaters (nothing better than fresh walleye). Going back this fall. We have real good luck in the fall, they are a little deeper, but when you find them, game on!"
