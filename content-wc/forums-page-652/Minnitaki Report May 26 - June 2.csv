Had a great week and caught a ton (literally) of walleyes, pike, and smallies, plus a lake trout and several other species. Anywhere we went, we caught fish. Biggest for the week was a 28"". One 43"" pike and one 40"" pike. Not bad at all. BTW, the water is on the rise. Good luck to everyone going."
