Weather was rough somedays but hot fishing always makes it better. beautiful fall colors, great big walleyes that are plentiful, cool nights to sleep and fall colors. All this equals a perfect trip. we stayed at wrights."

The weather was great with only oneday of rain.Most days it was 60-70 degrees.Had several 70 plus walleye days with most in 16""-26"". We stayed at Golden Hook Camp the last two years, but their weekly rates are for 6 days instead of 7. We may stay at Poplar Point Resort next year. Both are great camps."
