565246,Guest,2007-05-14 14:01:00,0,"Hi- Was wondering if anyone knew when the walleye season opened on Lac Seul, and if anyone is planning on going? We go to Ojibway in a few weeks, and am anxious to hear any reports(both fish and water levels). I understand the water levels are quite low as of now. Thanks!!"
565250,NWO Fishing Bum,2007-05-14 15:03:00,23,"Walleye opener is this Saturday (third Saturday in May). Water levels are quite low. Early season pike fishing has been going for over a week now, though most of the vegetation that pike rely upon to lay their spawn is high and dry, which has slightly changed the pattern for targeting these guys from normal years. Many pike not spawned...will be a poor year class for pike! Must be going, NWO Fishing Bum"
565252,Guest,2007-05-14 15:24:00,0,"NWO: Will you be at SWWL this year? We will be up June 14 - 21. This year bringing my son with me. He is not so little any more, 6'2"" as a freshmen in high school, so I am looking up to him these days. If we don't see you at SWWL, keep posting, because your experience and knowledge is most helpful to those of us without your talents. Cheers....IA Walleye"
565255,schick,2007-05-14 16:41:00,35,"We will be arriving at Mahkwa Lodge on May 25th and staying for six nights. I talked to the Lodge today and the manager said water levels are down 3.5-4 feet. I experiened this kind of low water a few years ago at Chamberlain Narrows, but this will be a new experience for the Mahkwa area. Does anyone have any tips on what might try for pike and/or walleye under these conditions? We will still fish the mouth of the river for walleye in hopes they will be there, but in the channel since the shallow area we normally fish will be dry. I doubt we will even be able to get into our favorite pike bay. We leave a week from Thursday. I think I will catch the draft of a north bound semi and follow it all the way otherwise my wife might not let me back home when she sees the gas bill. My oldest son, now Dr. Adam, will be fishing with me this year. NE Piker"
565256,Guest,2007-05-14 17:54:00,0,"NE Piker: In 2003 we were at SWWL the first week in June and the water was down 3 - 4 feet. Despite the water drop, it was one of the best years we have had. The hot spots were the same general spots as previous years, but fishing in water that should have been 12 - 15 feet deep but was now 8 - 12. So my recommendation is just do what you have always done, but just start in what would have been deeper water, water that you might not have fished previously. Make sure you have portable depth finder if your using a lodge boat and watch out for rocks. With the water drop and the warm spring we have had so far, my bet is that the biggest northerns will be already scattered and heading for deeper water. The occassional one will likely be near incoming water If you have fishing like we did in 2003, Katie bar the door. Lets all hope for rain, but not for the water level, but for the people fighting the fires and the resort owners hoping the flames don't come their way!. Cheers, IA Walleye"
565284,Guest,2007-05-15 15:15:00,0,"I hope you enjoy it at Mahkwa. We have been going there for quite a few years now. The fishing is excellent, as I am speaking only walleye fishing. We don't fish for northerns on purpose but do pick up a few here and there by mistake. We have gotten some dandies though. For walleyes, last year for the first time we tried out in front of the lodge in front of the big sand cliffs, we were supposed to meet some friends from our home town by the light on Eagle Island and they didn't show up so we thought we would try the sand cliffs in front of the island as we were so close to them and I have read about fishing there can be great. It was. The nice thing about it is you are not getting tangled up with any rocks, just sand and a few weeds. If you are fishing with any kids, it's great cause you are fishing and not pulling snags. This will be my first year with my 13 yo. This will be my first stop. Anyway, about 100 yards off shore there will be a drop from about 9-14 feet, go out and drift in with jigs and minnow,crawler or any secret plastic bait you like. You will know when you are on it and the bite will disappear when you're off it. Drift socks work well. Remember that it will be about 4 feet shallower this year from what I have been hearing. Also try your luck at Mcdonald island which is NW of Mahkwa about 2-3 miles i think. Wind blown shore is where you want to be. NE corner of that island is best wind permitting. It may be a little different for you as we usually go 3rd week in June. If you want, post again with your email address and I will be more specific. Can't give away all the secrets here!"
565291,schick,2007-05-15 17:44:00,35,"V-Shot Thanks for the info. My email is [email protected]. Any help you can provide will be appreciated. I take my fiberglass bass boat to Lac Seul, so I am very cautious about straying too far into uncertain waters in fear of hitting a rock. This year will make that even more challenging. So, I am curious about how dangerous it is to boat 2.5 miles to McDonald Island? I will certainly try the sand banks across the lake and the mouth of the river. Any other thoughts will be greatly appreciated. Thanks for sharing. 10 days and we are on the lake. NE Piker"
