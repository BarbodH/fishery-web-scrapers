565532,nitroman,2007-05-23 19:40:00,368,We have spent some time in the cut thru on the east side of convention bay and always pick up some as they transition thru. The long narrows are always a good trolling spot some spots are better than others we have found but typically if you find the depth they are at you can troll long narrows and pick up some fish along the way. We spend some time in musky bay as well as peephole. the saddle between the islands in peephole can be really great when you find the what side of it the fish are on. Musky is just great almost all the time when you find the depth. Nelson has always been hit or miss for me I have yet to figure that one out. Only 8 more days till were gone!! woowhoo! Nitro
565540,Guest,2007-05-24 05:05:00,0,"Yeah, Nelson has been the same for us, hit or miss..the last two years it was good, but for about the 3 yrs prior to that we didnt do anything in there..another consistently good spot has been the rock wall to the north of the entrance to Nelson..we troll that and almost always pick walleyes there"
565744,Guest,2007-05-31 12:44:00,0,"Got another email from Al at Cedar Lake Lodge...he said theyve been getting rain almost everyday and the water level has risen about 4""..he said that this week the walleyes are hot..not real big in size like last week but quantities are huge.."

565228,nitroman,2007-05-13 20:13:00,368,Thanks for the report foot low isn't too terrible but some rain to fill it back up would be nice(except the first week of june). What lodge you staying at up there? We will be at Cedar Point Resort.

565447,Guest,2007-05-19 16:40:00,0,"Nitro, We'll be at Cedar Lake Lodge (on the island) the first week of June. They'll be three of us; so if you see one of their 16' camp boats with three guys, feel free to wave us down and say ""Hi."" I see you're from Iowa; all three of us are originally from Iowa and went to school at ISU...if you're a Hawkeye, maybe you don't consider that something to be proud of. ;-) Best of luck, maybe we'll cross paths on the lake."
565449,Guest,2007-05-19 19:54:00,0,Good luck ...will be coming up the following week..save some trophies for our group...need some rain...
565501,nitroman,2007-05-21 20:59:00,368,"Storm I'll keep an eye out for you guy's.I will be in a Cedar Point camp boat probably wearing my yellow Bass Pro hat, we fish musky bay alot but will be making some trips down the west leg this year to a couple honey holes I know. Glenman: I can't make any promises but whatever trophies I may catch I will put back so you gat a chance at 'em :) p.s. got 2 ISU boys in the group (need someone to drive the boat while I fish) :) good luck guy's and storm I'll catch you on the lake !"
565517,Guest,2007-05-22 22:59:00,0,"Nitro, We'll keep an eye out for you incase you're on the west side...I'm not sure if we'll venture over to the west side much. Have you ever fished the string of islands on the east side on Convention Bay? Last year we had good luck catching lots of eating size walleye. RStorm"
565528,Guest,2007-05-23 15:31:00,0,"Got another email from our resort owner..he said the water temp as of Monday was 52 degrees..Walleye bite is good..said numerous fish over 20 inches have been caught with the biggest being 29 inches..the main areas so far that he's hearing are the narrows from Cedar Lake Lodge on the island going north, the long narrows and Nelson Lake..fish are mostly being caught by trolling small crankbaits or on jigs..on Monday four muskies were caught over 40 inches, with the biggest 47 inches..these were all hooked fishing for walleyes..mind you this just what is being reported to Cedar Lake Lodge..Im sure the other lodges fishermen are doing just as well...16 days to go for me..cant wait"
