I was more thinking in regards to early June, Mid-June, or more toward the end of June. If the hatch occurs can we expect very slow fishing and/or do you have to change up your bait selection? Any info would be great Thanks"

We had tough days when the water was dead calm, but hit it pretty hard when we had overcast with a chop - even with the mayflies. I'm not sure what it looks like for this year. The temps have been all over the board for the past 2 months. Last year was the first year I ran into this scenario in the 7 years I have been up there."

We'd mark ""pods"" of bugs, look for hooks below them and start fishing. We were used to fishing 7-12' f.o.w., but we ended up catching most of our fish in 20'+. I was used to fishing big plastics, but had to go down to 2"" and 3"" grubs in browns, yellows, and blacks."

565710,smallieman53,2007-05-30 12:59:00,11,Has anyone ever found that the fish would be in the eating mode during the initial hatch before they stuffed themselves silly???
565711,IMWalleye,2007-05-30 13:01:00,35,I have fished Lac Seul early June for the past 25 years. I ran into the Mayfly hatch one time a couple of years ago - absolutely slayed the walleyes - 4-12 ft in Bear Narrows area.

We had our best luck in 10 to 2' in the chop, it was so rough one day we came in for a few hours. As far as bait we used jigs with a tail and a crawler, no monsters, but alot up to 24"". Will be leaving in a couple weeks and cant wait, our Son and new Daughter-in-Law will be coming for there first trip. Ron"
