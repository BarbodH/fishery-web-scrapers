565725,Guest,2007-05-30 17:51:00,0,The chances of me getting caught are slim to none. The Cunucks \have legislated many things into law but one they they can't legislate is brain for the cops. KEystone cops have to be a direct slam coming from Canada and it isn't far from the truth.
565726,Guest,2007-05-30 17:53:00,0,"Yup, and if the Cunucks told you to stand on your head and spit on your eyebrow while holding out a 50 American dollars, you would kiss their hinnies faster than a fat girl in a food line."
565727,FISHNBOWLJOE,2007-05-30 19:15:00,80,"Gee, by the looks of the spelling, REALLY, WOWEE and PACifist came from the same gene pool. Or, maybe just the same apolitical coward using three different names. Things that make you go hmmmmmm. Yes, apolitical is a word, (unlike Cunucks) look it up in your Funk And Wagnalls. As for me, I'm not a political coward. I just tend to make my views known in a proper way. #1, I vote. # 2, I'm active in the community. I'm a current member of my local American Legion post, and a past officer of said organization. I've coached junior and high school sports. Part of coaching is also teaching. I teach my kids proper values. Something that you ignorant gentlemen are obviously unaware of. I've also served on the board of directors of our local Pony Baseball League. Re: teaching kids proper values. #3, I've served my country. Six years in the US Army is quite an education. Rules, regulations, teamwork and discipline. Again, something you guys are probably not familiar with. So, go on being subversive. You will find your road paved with problems. Remember, what goes around comes around, and you will get yours. As for me, I'll just go on with my own ignorant life. I'll sleep good at night though. Just bought a Sleep Number bed.;-) As before, Have a nice day, Joe PS I'm not as dumb as you look. I am very aware that there are people out there that post things on many websites, that are totally outrageous, just to get a rise out of people. I just haven't stood on my soapbox for a while. Figure it out.:rotflmao:"
565736,J.,2007-05-31 08:42:00,32,"Really, I have only one thing to ask of you... please take some type of spelling/grammar course; reading your posts are just as painful for how you say things, as for what you are saying (probably more so). J."
565739,jigman 2003,2007-05-31 10:12:00,981,Best way to deal with trolls is to ignore them.
565749,2746,2007-05-31 13:49:00,3206,We have not been asked if we have potatoes the last three trips accross the border. don't know if that means the ban if off or not but it's not been part of thier list of things to ask about.
565797,Guest,2007-05-31 15:09:00,0,"Read both your response and his opinion. He sounds overtaxed by the liberal know-it-alls and you sound like you are a ""YES"" man. Given a choice I would tend to side with him because I know MANY people like you that wouldn't say ""crap"" if they had a mouthful. How do you spell spineless? You sided with the status quo and he stood up for something. I admire him even though he could ""loosen"" his path but YOU.....your tend to be patronizingly worthless."

565798,Guest,2007-05-31 15:11:00,0,"Pass more taxes to teach me how to spell. As you liberals know, it is never MY fault just need some more ""help"" money in the form of more taxes."

565520,PRD1,2007-05-23 09:59:00,458,"I have not seen anything on the board on the subject this year, I assume the Potato ban is still on? Anything else new? Heading out in a few days and really looking forward to our trip. Paul"
565523,ONE TIME DAVE,2007-05-23 10:54:00,110,"I understand you can take cooked (boiled) potatoes but not raw ones. We are leaving Ohio for Nakina on the 30th, Can't come soon enough:bowdown:"
565531,Guest,2007-05-23 18:37:00,0,"Good luck on Melchett, Dave. I have to wait until Sept. Then off to Armstrong. Please post a report when you get back."
565547,Guest,2007-05-24 09:52:00,0,I am heading for Nakina on June 8. Let me know how you did up there. I have been going for five or six years now.

565680,Guest,2007-05-29 14:49:00,0,"In the egg section of the store they sell ""Simply Potatoes"" They are pretty much cooked except for the browning. They have hashbrowns, southwest hashbrowns with a little kick, sliced, mashed and a chunk kind with onion in them. Very convenient and good!"
565703,Guest,2007-05-30 11:26:00,0,"I have been taking potatoes into Cannda at will FOREVER. I take crawlwers in my own topsoil, plus my own minnows and leaches. I always take more beer and cigarettres than I am allowed and have enough gas in cans so I don't have to buy any Cunuck 5.00 plus per gallon gas. I figure it this way, Cananda wants to rip me off with all their socialist's taxes? Good, I can play the game too in complete disobedience to all of Canadas's bullcrap socialist laws. Can anyone suggest anymore laws I can break?"
565712,Guest,2007-05-30 13:44:00,0,"Really, Yes, I can suggest another law that you can break. When they finally do bust you please resist arrest with all means at your disposal."
565717,FISHNBOWLJOE,2007-05-30 15:44:00,80,"Wow, I guess there ""really"" is one in every crowd. And some people wonder why there are so many restrictions crossing the border into Canada. Duhhh! Thanks for making it worse for those of us law abiding citizens who try to do the right thing on our visits to Canada. By the way, how do you spell Canada? Cannda... Cananda...Canadas's... how bout' crawlwers, leaches or Cunuck. You better hope they don't check your driver's license too close. On second thought, I hope they do.;-) Think about it!!! To all Canadian's on or visiting this site. I'm ""really"" sorry about people like really. I know I don't have to say it, but the vast majority of us appreciate your country and its citizens. We abide by the law and do the right things in order to make our trips a pleasant experience for everyone involved. Thanks for understanding. Have a nice day! Joe PS See you in 10 days. Can't wait!"
565724,Guest,2007-05-30 17:48:00,0,How many laws and taxes have to be passed before political cowards like yourself will stand up and say NO?
