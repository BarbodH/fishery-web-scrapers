565691,Skylane,2007-05-29 20:51:00,101,We were suprised to come across morel mushrooms today here on our place in the Dryden area. Found a around 3 dozen which we ate with walleye and drowned with some red wine. What a treat. Anybody know if these are common place? The neighbors did not seem to know anything about them.

Some times you can eat these large mushrooms without any problem, but they can produce a compound that is lethal and there is no remedy for. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"

We went out today and found another 17 morels, took them to the neighbors to try. I think when the temps get a little highter they will probably get going. Noticed the mosqitoe are getting worse and the black flies were bad in the trees, came home with two ticks. Probably is a better time to be out in the boat rather than in the bush."
