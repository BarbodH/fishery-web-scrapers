I'm thinking of trying these minnows again, I tried them in the past with relatively limited success. It seemed I could catch just as many with plastics. Has anybody experienced significantly different catch rates by using these? Perhaps during cold front conditions? Any input appreciated."

565787,Guest,2007-06-01 12:03:00,0,1 shooter where you pleased with the guality of the baits? Did they hold up during the week? It would be much cheeper to buy the salted minnows than flying in live bait. How large (long) where the ones you used? thanks

We only fished 4 days and I had no problems with them holding up. I would suggest you keep them in cooler and shouldn't have any problems for a week. As far the size. I bought the L/XL size and suppose they ranged from 3 1/2 to 4 1/2.

The ones from bestbait are dried & salted. Just soak them in a little water prior to use to help get the loosend up, makes em' more real like. We have bought our crawlers from them for the past few years. Just ordered yesterday for our next trip."
