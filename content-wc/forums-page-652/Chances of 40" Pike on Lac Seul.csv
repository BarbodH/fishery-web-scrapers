I figured out over the last ten years on Lac Seul that we have caught one 40""+ Pike per every 103 man hours of fishing. Anybody else have any input."

565846,onemorecast,2007-06-01 19:34:00,23,"we don't fish for pike, only walleye and every other year it seems we catch a 40' plus pike while walleye fishing. So if you are trying the chances are good."

I'm sure there are monsters out there. So many pike, makes it kind of scarry putting your hand in the water. & we're fishing walleye. Good luck."

They were all caught while Walleye fishing - I now regret not having targeted them specifically. I have also had some rather large fish on, that unfortunately I missed (and it haunts me to this day, as some felt HUGE). Cheers."
565859,Guest,2007-06-02 13:01:00,0,the northerns are almost as good as the walleye if you know how to get the y bones out while cleaning the fish.
