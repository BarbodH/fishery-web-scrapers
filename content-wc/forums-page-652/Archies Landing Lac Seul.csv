565782,Guest,2007-06-01 10:23:00,0,I will bet the main dock and the dock for cabins 9-12 will be totally out of water.If lucky they will have a couple of small floating docks in. Back in 2003 the end of the main dock was 20 yards from the water. Be careful entering the end of the bay to Mahkwa as there is a sandbar that runs north and south starting from appx in front of what is now the main lodge. In low water years they mark the opening with two jugs appx 1/3 out from the left side of the bay.Fishing the 2nd-8th I will give a water update when I get back.TAK

565796,JDP,2007-06-01 16:25:00,1457,"Dock situation during my stay (May 19-26) was ""slim pickings"". Fortunately the resort was not crowded. There was an exposed sand bar almost cutting off the bay in fron of the main dock. There was an area of about 15 feet wide and 3 feet deep to drivr through - it was marked. The sand bar by now is a few inches under water. The dock in front of Cabin 14 only was able to hold 1 boat due to low water/rocks. The main dock was significantly reduced in capacity of boats. However, Mahkwa was working during the week to increase dock space. They have a huge yellow front load excavator moving dirt around the resort. They have a number of projects underway; a new septic field, a road to the resort that should open sometime after July of this year, a boat ramp ,etc. Long story even longer, but dock space will NOT be a problem. You may have to walk a little further though in some situations."

The channel through the sandbar was no problem since they had it well marked. Do not drink the tap water. One gentleman got very sick. Two of us got quite sick one night, but it was likely bad mayonaise. Otherwise Mahkwa did an excellent job. The food was superb overall. NE Piker"
565763,Guest,2007-05-31 21:56:00,0,Anyone been to Archies Landing out of Hudson on LS this spring. Going there next week and just wonder about the landing with the water being so low.

The ramp is fine, however there are only 2 short docks that you can use to load/access your boat. Thereare 1 or 2 docks completely out of the water. Going to Mahkwa through the stumps and rocks is fairly easy. You need to make a ""S-Turn"" through the area between the rocks and stumps. There are a couple of spots very shallow (2 feet or so). If you go slow, there is no problem. Good Luck at Lac Seul. :cheers:"
