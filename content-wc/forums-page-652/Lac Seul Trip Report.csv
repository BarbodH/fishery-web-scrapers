565847,schick,2007-06-01 20:23:00,35,"Just returned from 6 days fishing out of Mahkwa Lodge. The lake was as low as advertised, but it is coming up since it rained every day we were there. The low water presented some challenges of fishing new places, but it did not hurt the fishing success. We are primarily pike fisherman -- pike during the day and walleye in the evening. We caught 257 pike and 187 walleye, but the walleye numbers were only limited by the time we put in. Two of our six evenings were unable to fish due to stormy weather. My oldest son Adam beat my younger son's pike family record from last year. Adam's pike measured a whopping 45 inches compared to Ben's 41.5 last year. I caught lots of fish, but my biggest pike was a mere 35 inches. I did catch the largest walleye at 27 inches. The walleye were biting real good on minnows and fair to good on crawlers. I tried gulp crawlers with no success. Mahkwa Lodge had to cut a channel through the sandbar to get into their camps and they are limited on dock space on the meal plan side of the bay, but otherwise we had a great time and great food. It rained most of the the time, but the wind was never such that it kept us off the lake. One disappointment is that the Canadien government has greatly tightened down on reimbursement for the GST tax. They are only paying the tax if it is part of a complete package deal with a lodge -- room, food and boat. Mahkwa only showed lodging on my bill and they would not accept that. They gave me a form to send it and said I needed to get the Lodge to itemize the bill to show that my lodging fee did include meals. I got zero reimbursement at the border. That combined with the high cost of gas made this trip a lot more expensive. 363 days until next year. NE Piker"
565853,Guest,2007-06-02 10:06:00,0,"Thanks for the report. 11 days till we head up to LS. Couple of questions: (a) did you catch any smallies; and (b) did you get into Bray and if so, how was that? Thanks again for the update, I am starting to do my packing. My wife wonders why I start this process with 11 days to go, when for a family vacation I start the night before we leave. Since she does not fish, I never try to explain. Cheers. IA Walleye"
565863,Guest,2007-06-02 16:11:00,0,Does anyone one know of another way to get to Mahkwa Lodge other than driving that last part that is gravel? Can a person drive by boat from Hudson to the Lodge? The graval part of the road to Mahkwa seems to be really hard on the trailer and boat no matter how slow you drive. I think that gravel is pure granite. We were going 30 miles to the west a lot to fish and saw a lot of other boasts. Wondering if I could come in from the West and make it.
565869,Guest,2007-06-02 20:28:00,0,"I think the answer is yes, you could make that boat ride, but it would be a very long one. I would guess that if your going to the west from ML, that most of the boats your seeing are from SWWL. While I do not trailer my boat to the lodge we stay at on LS, we trailer it in northern WI and IA on lots of gravel roads. With good gravel guards on both my track and on the boat itself, the dings we get on the boat are not too bad. The trailer still takes a beating, but that is easily blasted and painted every other year. Many moons ago we went to a lodge that required a lengthy boat in. 95% of that time that was not too bad, but occassionally we did it in a storm and several times had to sit around and wait for the storm to pass. Not a huge deal, but if your trying to make flight connections or get home for some reason, it was problematic. Just something to consider before you decide to make a very long boat ride in to get to and from your resort. Cheers and have a great vacation, IA Walleye"

You only have to deal with them once a year us that live up here have to deal with it daily. I think the lodges have proper paperwork they can fill out for you if you ask them to make it easier at the border."
565900,Guest,2007-06-04 06:32:00,0,"Yes, we did catch a few smallies, but not as many as the last 2 years. We made it into Bray Lake and on the back side of the island with the wind blowing out of the east we picked up 3 smallies -- 2 17's and 1 16. Every where we fished for pike we picked up an occasional smallie on our large doctor spoons. I was impressed with Bray Bay, but not so much with Bray Lake. Our buddie fishing with us in another boat tackled fishing the windward shore mud line in Bray Lake and only caught one walleye. As far as boating into Mahkwa I have to agree that the trip from Hudson would not be worth the benefits of avoiding the gravel. I was told by a person staying at the Lodge that we will be able to drive right to the Lodge next year versus Archie's Landing. Archie's Landing was in tough shape this year. There was no dock at all. NE Piker"
