565698,Guest,2007-05-30 08:22:00,0,"I still do not understand what the current state of the rebate program is, if it exists at all. I am driving into Canada this week for a one week fishing trip. We booked the trip at this time last year however did not put down any money until Jan 2007. At that time, I put down a deposit of $300. I am paying for lodging and other miscellaneous expense which will add up to around $2500 (including the deposit). The HST tax rate is 14% ($350) and the GST is 6% ($150) from what I understand. Will I be able to get a rebate on either of these taxes? If so, how much will my rebate be? Any help figuring this out would be greatly apprecaited as I am not an accountant and have a hard time interpreting ever changing tax laws on a day to day basis. They seem like a moving target. I want to know what my expected costs are so my fishing companions bring enough $$ to reimburse me. Thanks! The Sheriff"

565236,Guest,2007-05-14 08:52:00,0,I thought I had seen an article a while back that the rebates were being discontinued....anyone have any updates? John
565247,2746,2007-05-14 14:15:00,3206,The camp where we stay has told us they have been discontinued.
565248,2746,2007-05-14 14:24:00,3206,"P.S. With gas prices up, currency exchange rates unfavorable and now this, our trips to Canada have risen a more than a bit over the last two years. Any one of these events is just a small bump but when added together it turns into real money. Although we are still going I would think the traffic might slow in the future."

565412,Guest,2007-05-18 09:00:00,0,"$269 to $400? that's a 49% increase. First is US dollars and the second is Canadian? This doesn't sound right. ""If Canada keeps it up"" ... We all believe the Conversative government made a big mistake with the changes to the GST rebate; another rash decision without industry consultation. But it looks like the pressures they are receiving about it are working. The exchange rate, the passport issue (for next year if driving), and the price of gas; these are Canada's fault?"
565418,Guest,2007-05-18 10:06:00,0,Is NOTO wrong? The link that Brian2 put up to them says that the rebate is in place but how to get it has changed.
565434,retire55,2007-05-18 20:33:00,1029,"keywest: To eradicate any possibility of misinformation, could you please breakdown your $400 bill so that we can understand what taxes were applied."
565451,bigfish1965,2007-05-19 22:41:00,3210,"Well I live in Niagara (not 'niagra') and visitor volume is doing quite well. Overall the numbers from the US are down quite a bit (overseas visitors way up, though), but this is due to the exchange and falling dollar. Nothing anyone on this side of the border can do about that. I travel the US quite a bit and no state I have ever visited offers a tax rebate to visitors...or at least they don't tell you about it. The Canadian dollar is expected to peak at about 95cents US which will knock exchange down to 3% or so. IF the return of 7% of those things that are taxable by the GST (I don't think there has ever been a refund on provincial taxes) makes a big difference,I doubt it will be gone for long."
