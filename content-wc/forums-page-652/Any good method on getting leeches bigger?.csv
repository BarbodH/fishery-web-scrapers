Is there anything you can add to your leech's water that will make them puff up or bigger? I am the same guy that got a worm puffer from some bait owner and never used it but it sounded good! =0) Is it true if you keep them in ice water they will not only last longer but they will stretch out and get bigger once they hit the warmer water? I have gotten a lot of help from this board and cannot stress enough gratitude to everyone helping me as a novice. THANK YOU Chad Iowa PS-- Is there a place around Sioux Lookout that offers monster leeches or would you stick to what the resort owner has even thou you have no clue what size he carries?

If you feel the walleyes are going after larger leeches try bulking up you jig or spinner rig with any color (probably black) twister tail (body only) on the hook shank ahead of the leech. I used to only want the JUMBO'S and paid dearly for them. It was a waste of money. I've caught walleyes of all sizes on tiny little leeches that we joked about when I put one on the hook. Pooch"
