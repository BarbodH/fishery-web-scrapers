534568,Guest,2003-08-22 09:57:00,0,"Yes, and they'll still keep his money.....LOL."
534569,Backwater Eddy,2003-08-22 10:37:00,3871,"Contact customs, explain when and what the infarction was, get the details straight first. If the DUI offense in in the last 5 years it may be a no go, kinda depends? From 5-10 years old it is no longer a worry as long as it is not a complicated offense in there eyes. Just be straight with them right up front. Odds are if you fallow the procedure you will be just fine. If your concerned that it is a no go with your record, ask them directly, what are the odds it will be approved. Canadian tourism is not trying to keep US dollars out, odds are fair to good you will get it. Just don't try to bring back that Canadian Wacky weed...Uhhh.....Eh! ;) Ed ""Backwater Eddy"" Carlson ""Piggy's are my business, and business is good"" ><,sUMo,>"

534543,Guest,2003-08-21 10:15:00,0,I wish you all thought that way.....
534545,Guest,2003-08-21 12:48:00,0,"Too funny. But at least if and when you get to Canada, you will not be tempeted by the evil alcohol! Canadians never drink a drop of beer or liquor. The only alcohol available is only to supplicate all the wayward beer guzzling, booze swilling Americans who didn't get caught while driving drunk and can still go there for a visit.(Hah Please note also, no Canadians smoke or swear and they HATE gambling, too! heh heh heh."
534546,Guest,2003-08-21 13:00:00,0,"http://www.legalline.ca/immigration/683.htmlhttp://www.rlbelcourt.ca/usapermit.shtml These are two websites that will give you the info you need. It is a good idea to get a permit. We had one of our guys get bounced last year for a 5 year old DUI. We only live a 100 miles from the border, so it wasn't that big a deal although it was inconvenient. The customs officers are checking ID's on a regular basis. I've been across about 10 times since then and had my license checked 50% of the time."
534547,Guest,2003-08-21 13:13:00,0,"What a hose job. Athought has it right. Quick easy money for Canda's socialist welfare system though. Love it up there, but no thanks, I'll stay here in the land of the big PX."
534548,Guest,2003-08-21 13:28:00,0,Thanks. The less the better....
534555,Guest,2003-08-21 19:26:00,0,"Easy guys, DUI is a serious offence here in Canada and subject to conditions on entry. Just because you pay a fee for a permit to enter doesn't mean your fee was for nothing if allowed entry. Customs has to update the CPIC system, check you out more and this cost money so IF, and I am saying IF you get pulled over by the fuzz down the road you won't be arrested and thrown in jail for being in the country illegally."
534561,Guest,2003-08-22 04:57:00,0,Great idea!!
534562,Guest,2003-08-22 05:01:00,0,You should be commended for starting early and getting this out of the way. Canada Customs will get you going on the right track. Have a great trip.
