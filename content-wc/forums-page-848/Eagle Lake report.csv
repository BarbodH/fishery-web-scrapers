Plenty of fish below the slot and many fish above the slot in the 24-26 in range. And as usually, most fish fell in the slot (18-23 inches). No real big hawgs in our group this year. A couple 27's, 28's and one hit 29.5"". Caught fish on a varity of presentations from trolling cranks and spinners to Lindy rigs. Most fish fell to the leech, but the night crawler shined some days when they refused the leech. This lake only gets better and better. Anyone else up there lately??"

I'm new to September fishing, (only been to the May opener - jigs and minnows in <12ft water) so I hope the ""September experts"" can share what presentations (jigs, spinners, bottom bouncers....etc) are a must have on Eagle this time of year. Looking to add some ""you must have this or don't even show up"" presentation options to the tackle box. THANKS"

534442,Guest,2003-08-18 06:16:00,0,"Don't get me wrong, 27-29 inch fish are great fish. But usually someone gets at least one 30+ inch fish each year."

Run those Reef Runners through Shad schools in 80+ ft of water. It gets exciting when the planer goes down like a bobber. 31 1/2 was our biggest. CatchNrelease"
