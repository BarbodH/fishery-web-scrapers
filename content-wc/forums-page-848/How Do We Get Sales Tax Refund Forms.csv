534444,tly,2003-08-18 06:41:00,1900,Recently returned from week in Ontario and have a rather large amount of tax assessed which is refundable. I forgot to pick up form at border and the websites I have visited have links to form but have an error when trying to pick up form. Any help will be appreciated. Thanks TLY
