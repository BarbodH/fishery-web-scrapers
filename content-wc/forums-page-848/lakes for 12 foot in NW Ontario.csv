534591,Guest,2003-08-23 17:52:00,0,I am getting too old for the pounding on big lakes. I recently purchased a 12 foot boat. Does anyone have a recomendation for a smaller lake or sheltered fishing(mostly walleye in July) in NW Ontario? In that vein-anyone have any feedback on Wawang Lake near Ignace?-much appreciation for any tips
