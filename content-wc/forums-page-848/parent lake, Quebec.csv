At that time, it is primarily a shallow (0 to 18 feet) jig bite. However, this late in the season the fish will be deeper, and the lake will probably be down a few feet. We always fish the north end of the lake. This lake is about forty miles long, so you have a choice to make as to which end of the lake to fish. Are you staying at the Lodge at Parent Lake? If so, they have docks at either end, and Wayne and Peg will take good care of you and will direct you to the hotspots. The town of Senneterre has anything you would ever need in the way of services. If you need any further information, E-mail me at [email protected]."
