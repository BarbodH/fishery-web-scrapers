534577,Guest,2003-08-22 20:38:00,0,I am getting too old to be pounded on big lakes. I just purchased a 12 foot boat for trips next summer. Any advice for smaller lakes or sheltered fishing in NW Ontario? mainly walleye fishing. Would go in July. Much appreciation for any ideas. Also any thoughts on Wawang Lake Resort-east of Ignace? thank you

It is a nice drive in camp right off Hwy 105. We fished with them for 20+ years and were never disapointed. :) www.fishandhuntontario.com"
