534499,Guest,2003-08-20 09:06:00,0,Heading up to Red Lake next week and was wondering if anyone has been there before? This will be my first time there and could use some info on the lake and areas to try and what presentations work there. Would sure appreciate it if someone could help out this fisherman.....Thank you

The Red Lake Walleye Fall Classic is August 30 & 31. Therefore, wherever you see boats stopped quite often is definitely a good spot to fish. If you happen to see a 2004 green Lund Pro V up in the area of Gullrock......rock stop by and say Hi!"
