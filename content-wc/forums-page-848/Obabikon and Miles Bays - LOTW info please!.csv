I hear the trip to the elbow is a bit tricky with the low water levels. We really like to go up there to cast for northerns and muskie. We also like to jig crawlers in Miles bay for wallies. I would appreciate any current information regarding walleye locations in either Miles or Obabikon bay. Last years, we hit the reefs at the entrance to miles bay and also the reef just north or Smokehouse island. We also found some nice bays in about 19' of water holding walleyes. Believe this or not, we caught a lot of crappies trolling Strike King crank baits close to shore in the Obabikon. We went power trolling to Shoal Lake last month and may try this technique on LOTW. Any information is appreciated!"

Thanks Doug Johnson!!! The water is definitely low. We ate lunch on Smokehouse Island and did most of our fishing to the south and west of there. We moved around alot. Some reefs held tons of fish and others not hardly any. We went through alot of little ones to get to the real nice keepers. Fish were from 8'to 25' deep depending on the reef you were on. We also caught a bunch of crappies on one reef right along with the walleyes. It was a great trip, hope you have the same!!!!!!"

534167,Guest,2003-08-05 15:44:00,0,A group from the lodge I stay at went thru the portage with no problems in late July and caught some nice lake trout. Good luck.
