534285,Guest,2003-08-11 12:09:00,0,Crossed into Canada at Fort Frances August 1st with no problems. Didn't ask for ID's. Just the usual questions. Same with the return home. I had a DUI in 1999.
534413,Guest,2003-08-15 15:01:00,0,"I'm back from my trip. I made a last minute decision not to drive my vehicle, but to let my buddy drive. At the border they asked for an ID which we gave but they must not have run a driving record on it. They did not ask about a criminal record, just about alchohol, food, tobacco, where we were from, and our relation. They did have us pull over because we declared 4 cases of beer instead of the 2 that we are allowed. They searched the truck and the boat and found that we were in compliance except for the extra beer that we had declared. I loaded up the truck while my buddy went in and paid the duty on the beer and we left. They did take down my buddy's name and address when he went in and paid the duty, I think this was for receipt and accounting purposes though. Good luck."

533852,Guest,2003-07-27 13:10:00,0,"I have a trip coming up to Canada. I have a DUI from 1998, I'll be going through International Falls and will be driving my vehicle. I have gone twice to Canada since my DUI, but have never driven my vehicle. Has anyone with a recent DUI recently crossed the border in thier own vehicle? Will they run my license plates and get my driving record? Will I be able to cross? Does anyone know a phone number of the consulate or the imigration office, someone I can ask? Any help you can provide is appreciated. WalleyeMan"
533861,PJM,2003-07-27 21:37:00,3516,GuyFish A buddie of mine had a DUI in 2000 and was stopped at the border in Baudett and all they made him do is by a permit for like $200.00 Canadian to get a cross and it suppose to be good for the season..........
533877,Guest,2003-07-28 09:29:00,0,"Thanks for the information. How did they find out about your buddie's DUI? Was it from his license plates, did they do a spot check? What information did he need to have to fill out the application? Passport? Court/Police records? If anyone else has any input it would be appreciated."
533882,Guest,2003-07-28 11:12:00,0,"They check every single persons license now, including passengers. The best bet would have been to apply for a Rehabilitation Permit, but that process takes over a year. The only thing you can do is show up and plead your case. I would suspect that they will let you cross after paying the $200 bucks and filling out the form. Expect it to take a couple of hours, and don't bring beer with you, it will only aggravate the process."
533883,Guest,2003-07-28 11:37:00,0,Went up through International falls on Friday May23rd. Drove my own vehicle and I have had a previous from 1997. Was asked a few qusetions asked to pull up for an inspection and was on my way in 10 minutes. Be honest and precise with your answers and they will treat you with respect.We were not asked for ID's. There was 3 people in my vehicle(SUV).Good luck.
533885,bronzeback77,2003-07-28 11:45:00,97,I have been told by a friend that some of his party was sent back home and not allowed to cross the border at INTL Falls. They had to have their wives drive up from Minneapolis to come get them. I don't know if this is common but it sure would suck.
533895,Guest,2003-07-28 17:01:00,0,They do NOT check everyone's license now. I crossed the border x 2 this year and they did check my license plate (which is clean) and did not check my license nor my passengers (my wife once and my cousin the other).
533904,balsl6,2003-07-28 21:00:00,426,"I really think is discretion involved in there decisions? Last year we went up Duck hunting with 2 friends that have had DUI's when they did the background check they never even said anything about the DUI's gave us are gun permits and we were on are way (DUI's were 2 & 7 years old). With that said I also know of people that have went with older and newer DUI's and were not allowed in? I have even known people that were not even allowed the $200 option. It is the customs agent choice, be courteous & polite and they will treat you the same and hope for the best. Good Luck"
533919,Guest,2003-07-29 13:15:00,0,"Guyfish, Let us know how your border crossing went after you get back."
533920,Guest,2003-07-29 14:32:00,0,"I was there last weekend. The customs agent told me that they now check every license, no exceptions. Every single person that I know that crossed last week (there are about 20 of them) had their license checked."
