534512,2746,2003-08-20 13:24:00,3206,Depends on if your pulling a boat or not. We were up last week and there is still a 25 mile section in the middle that has not been re-surfaced yet. It's all paved but rough enough you need to slow down with a boat. To much speed and you could do some damage. The rest of the road is relatively new and very good. Have a good trip and watch out for the moose!

Pulling a boat we usually run 50 or less on the bad stuff--there was an interesting assorment of parts and tire rubber scattered around. Some people hurry too much, I think. New logging is happening on the east side near Catpaw road so you might encounter a few more pulp trucks than normal too. Still a beautiful drive. Good luck."
534525,Guest,2003-08-20 17:14:00,0,Good going...Ditto the Moose. Keep your eyes open.
534553,Vitreum,2003-08-21 17:00:00,221,they had better get off their butts and do some serious paving this fall. i don't think some of those areas will stand another canadian winter.
