534455,Guest,2003-08-18 09:33:00,0,The Worlds Greatest Walleye Fiherman (Barney) recently returned from Gullrock and he literally wiped out the Walleye population. Barneys fishing techniques and midas touch with a Walleye rod and jig are legendary and allowing him to fish Gullrock for a whole week was just to much for the lake. Many boats came in close enough to watch the Master and there were several standing ovations as Barney hooked one monster Walleye after another. Ontario is currently in the midst of a massive restocking program on Gullrock in hopes that they can replenish the lake after Barneys awesome display of Walleye fishing.

534506,Mahumba,2003-08-20 12:16:00,345,"What's a ""Walleye Fiherman""? What does it eat in the winter time? I used to have one of those but the wheels fell off! Roger Mayer"
534507,Guest,2003-08-20 12:32:00,0,"Mahumba, You would think that somebody would have noticed ""Walleye Fiherman"" before. A Walleye Fiherman is a Walleye Fisherman who is so busy catching fish that he doesent have time to use all his S,s. This is actually a rare disease that afflicts those Fisherman who continually catch more fish than the rest of the guys on the lake. When you ask a fisherman at a lake ""How they biteing"" and he replys ""mostly with their mouths"" he could really be a Fiherman, they dont like to tell you anything. GO BARNEY GO, MASTER FIHERMAN"
534508,Mahumba,2003-08-20 12:43:00,345,Oh I See! I wish I could get out fishing and give the Great Purple One some competition but alas I still can't sit in my boat. Back injury on June 13th of this year so all I can do is read about it. Roger Mayer.
534510,Guest,2003-08-20 12:58:00,0,"Mahumba, Sorry to hear that your back wont allow you to fish against Barney the ""Master"". When it comes time to challenge Barney it seems that everbody comes up with some sort of an excuse. I dont blame you or the others who conviently have bad backs when its time to drop a anchor with the Master. Many who have taken Barney on have perished and are now playing Golf or some other girlie sport. Actually Im sad to hear that your back wont let you fish. Hope it gets better and you get back on the water."
534511,Mahumba,2003-08-20 13:19:00,345,"Warden, This is my back. http://www.baynet.net/~mayerrc/backinjury.jpg I took a pretty bad fall. 15 feet sraight down onto boulders. Still pretty sore and nothing broken. Pretty lucky I guess. Roger Mayer. P.S. Yes I heard all the ""Say no to crack jokes! Ha Ha"""
534514,Guest,2003-08-20 13:51:00,0,"Mahumba, OUCH....no wonder you cant sit down to fish. You are lucky that you didnt get hurt a lot worse. Are you a Plumber by trade????"
534556,Guest,2003-08-21 19:32:00,0,Way too lean for a Plumber Warden.
