534468,Guest,2003-08-18 18:29:00,0,"Are you taking your own boats? Are you interested in a ""Housekeeping Plan"" or an American plan? How many in the group as generally the rates will be reduced per person the larger the group. We went to Lac Seul a few weeks ago and caught plenty of walleye but few northern and no musky. This would be about a 5 hour drive north of International falls. Want more information email me. [email protected]"
