534344,Guest,2003-08-13 04:17:00,0,Looking for feedback on who runs some of the better fly-in camps. Have been fishing in the Sioux Lookout area the past 6 years and i'm looking to take my 86 year old Grandpa on a fly-in. He still fishes or golfs everyday.
534347,IaDave,2003-08-13 06:34:00,476,I would recommend Slate Falls Outposts. Their cabins are top notch and the lakes they fish are some of the best. This is the only one that I have experience with. I have heard Anderson's Lodge is also very good.
534359,phishfearme,2003-08-13 13:08:00,1242,"do a search on ""bow lake"". you'll find a series of posts about an excellent outfitter outta pickle lake. - phish"
534362,Ivy,2003-08-13 14:01:00,556,We are going out on a fly-out in a couple days. I'll give you a 1st hand account of our out-fitter when we get back. Ivy

534404,Guest,2003-08-15 08:19:00,0,doesn't get any better than Showalters out of Ear Falls - 20+ years and counting...
534408,Guest,2003-08-15 10:40:00,0,"I am a little nervous about giving the name of the outfit that we used this year for our first fly in,(I am in no way affilaited with this lodge!!!) but since we had such great service I will without a doubt recomend L&M Outposts. We went to Fawcett lake, they have several lakes they fly to. Cought several hundered walleyes in the group (4 guys 4 days) I was a little disapointed that the largest was only 24 "", but I've never cought so many fish, so it was a trade off. Please e-mail me @ [email protected] with any questions, or if you need any additional info."
534490,Guest,2003-08-19 19:16:00,0,"Check out Ignace Outposts (www.ignaceoutposts.com). Brad & Karen run first class operation. Just got back from Flindt Lake and six of us caught over 200 eyes a day for 5 days along with northerns of 40"" & 36"" along with smaller ones. Did not find any big eyes, up to 24"", but it was a blast. This was our second year and already planning for next year. Jerry"
