I know Booi's is a fly in lodge, but what about cabins, early June fishing for Northerns, staff, ect. any info. would help. Also considering Way North Lodge, and Andy Myers Lodge. Thank you in advance. Have been on several fly-ins to outposts camps and thought I would try an American plan once."

RED LAKE TOURIST LODGE AND OWNERS FINED $10,000 Posted Monday, November 11, 2002 RED LAKE Â– Owners of a Red Lake tourist lodge have been fined $10,000 after being convicted of having walleye over the limit. Booi's Wilderness Lodge and Outposts Ltd. has been fined $7,000 for having an overlimit of walleye at the lodge in June 2001, and $1,000 for possessing fish in a manner that the number could not readily be counted. Jim Booi, 41, and Tracy Booi, 39, both of Red Lake have also been personally fined $1,000 each. Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) Red Lake District Conservation Officers and a Fort Frances District flying officer were conducting an enforcement blitz on Trout Lake, northeast of the town of Red Lake on June 21, 2001. The officers located a large number of fish fillets in a camp freezer at Booi's Wilderness Lodge. After unfreezing the fish, the officers counted 67 walleye. Officers had cautioned the lodge owners on other occasions that all fish must be accounted for at the camp. In addition, the lodge owners had been told they could not stockpile fish that had been donated by the guests for the advertised weekly chowder night. None of the guests or lodge staff claimed any of the fish found in the freezer on that day. In addition to the fines, the court issued several orders to the lodge owners. The court ordered that no fish caught by the guests could be kept in the lodge kitchen and that only commercially caught fish could be used for making chowder. As well, the lodge in conjunction with MNR must develop a harvest monitoring system by May 2003 to record the harvest of fish caught by guests. Justice of the Peace Marg Pasloski passed sentence at the Ontario Court of Justice in Red Lake on November 1, 2002. She stated that in arriving at the sentence, she took into account the amount of walleye, the commercial connection of the offence, and the need for deterrence. The public is encouraged to help protect its natural resources by reporting violations to the local Ministry of Natural Resources or to Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477)."

How the he11 is that ""the same as going to a shore lunch and eating your limit of walleyes and then going back out in the afternoon or evening and keeping 4 more for supper or to take home""?? Don't belittle their mistake. The problem really seems to be that they CONTINUED doing it after having been warned. In your opinion willful disregard of the authorities and law should be OK???"
534485,scar,2003-08-19 15:14:00,196,anyone else notice that the guy who keeps ripping on boois keeps changing his user name? is it you mike????????????????
534491,Guest,2003-08-19 19:53:00,0,"So glad to see that you responded to the content of my reply, Scar. Sorry if your friends and/or fellow lodge owners appeared in the press because of their....mistake. Truly sorry if you feel that the willful disregard of warnings and further violations were acceptable."
