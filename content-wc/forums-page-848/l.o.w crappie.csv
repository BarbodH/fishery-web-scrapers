As for spots to fish crappies you hit the biggies. Just got back this past Sunday. We did not try getting into Obabikian Lake as all we were fishing was eyes. Have heard people are getting in but had my father-in-law's boat and did not want to try it. If you see a Lund Barron with a 175 Johnson and 2-4 people in it stop and say ""HI"". Keep Your Rod Bent !!! GrandPops"
534532,Guest,2003-08-20 23:25:00,0,"thanks grandpops you may have just changed are minds it sounds like mylies resort is closer to the areas will be fishing is this correct, as the shorter the run to the fishing grounds the better. also where might i pick-up a map of the area. thanks for your response and hopefully catch-up with you that weekend."
534533,GrandPops,2003-08-21 03:31:00,31,"bojangles Mylie's is about equil didstance from Hay Island and Miles Bay. As to maps, you mean lake maps? You can get them from the office when you check in. We will be getting into camp sometime early on the 27th. Would be more than happy to show you some spots that are good. Keep Your Rod Bent !!! GrandPops Almost forgot, Myliesplace.com is thier web site."
534554,Guest,2003-08-21 18:43:00,0,"bo, you should consider miles bay camp for crappie fishing in sept. its a little rough and you have to cook your own food , but it's a great location for miles bay fishing and the owners are great folks to get to know. only about a mile or so from thompson creek and the other crappie hot spots. pf"
534558,Guest,2003-08-21 20:05:00,0,"do they have a website,or do you have the phone# thanks"
534565,Guest,2003-08-22 09:03:00,0,"I'm not sure Miles Bay Camp is open in October. The last few years I've been up there in Oct. I haven't noticed any activity there as I passed the camp. I know Grassy Narrows Lodge, New Moon Lodge and Obabikon Bay Camp are all open in Oct. and Pulp is right, it can be a long boat ride from Morson to Miles Bay in rough water. But, if you do stay at one of the camps in Miles Bay it's twice as far to Hay Island than if you stay in Morson. I'll be up there from Oct. 3-12 fishing mostly around Miles Bay, Thompson Creek and Obabikon. If you see a couple with a white dog in the boat, stop by."
534570,Guest,2003-08-22 11:43:00,0,"bo, i know that miles bay camp is open in sept. because i go there every year in october to hunt bluebills and catch crappie. their phone number is 807 488 5800. sarah is the owners name. grassy narrows is a nice camp but i was told they're getting $145 us per day which i couldn't afford. the crappie fishing was poor last year. the rumor was that the indians were netting miles bay for them. anyway, if it's crappies you want, miles bay is the best place to find them.pf"
