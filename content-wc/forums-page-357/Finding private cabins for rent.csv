2094834,poultryman,2013-09-10 12:30:00,183,"Thinking ahead to next summer, Im interested in looking for a private house to rent for 1 or 2 weeks in NW Ontario. Plenty of bedrooms, quiet location, excellent musky and pike and smallmouth fishing, maybe some higher end amenities for the wives to enjoy. Hot tub, nice kitchen, nice deck, etc. Could be a boat in island property. Doesnt have to be.Wives are NOT interested in rustic cabins. Ideas? Outside of using The Google, are there any good suggestions on how to find private homes to rent?"

If you are interested in the Lake of the Woods area, they publish a high quality magazine which has a classified ad section which includes cabin rentals. The Association may tell you over the phone what the current ads are. If you can't get the ads that way, send me a pm and I'll scan and send the current ads to you.You could also put an ad in that magazine and property owners would contact you.Reading the Kenora Daily Miner/Lake of the Woods Enterprise and/or posting an ad there may help. They have online versions. http://www.kenoradailyminerandnews.com/Or try http://www.cottagesincanada.com/cott...tario/northernAway from Lake of the Woods, I'd try the local newspaper and realtors in the area you were looking at."

2096529,deadhead1,2013-09-11 09:03:00,193,"I have a small cabin that I rent out but it is not suited for large group. It would more be a ""rustic"" cabin suitable for two to four people. It is located on north east corner of Lake Of The Woods. It was built as a guest cabin for friends but now we rent it out once in a while."
2096769,troutwater,2013-09-11 10:26:00,299,"Here is one on Perrault. It doesn't have everything you list, but it's pretty nice! Cedar is connected via the river and had really good pike and muskie fishing. http://www.vrbo.com/361437#reviews"
