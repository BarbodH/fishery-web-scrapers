We may have to bang on the walls of your cabin when we leave the lodge in the wee hours, just so you know we haven't forgot about you!!!!!"
1824993,emma17,2013-05-31 11:37:00,436,Our group is heading to Birchdale on June 22- any NARDA events planned? You guys sound like a blast to hang with.
1826953,NARDA 1,2013-06-01 07:11:00,636,Sorry Emma but we won't be up there until August 22nd -31st. You could always come up again in August!!!!! Tell Marcel I said to buy you a drink. Have a great trip and leave some fish in the lake for us.
1842537,emma17,2013-06-06 08:31:00,436,It is my goal to take a second trip w my gal sometime soon. I hope soon. In honor of your organization I started drinking Canadian Club this week- I hope it's a NARDA approved brand.
2092513,Danbear,2013-09-09 09:52:00,72,"Returned home from our 7th trip to Birch Dale on 8/31, had a great time hanging out with the Narda Gang, Fishinnut and a few others we had met in previous years. It was tasty eating Narda's 25th anniversery cake as well as a great diner every night at the Bull Pit . Weather was extremely hot and void of wind and some of our best spots did not produce this year so we had to search out some new ones. Portage Bay still gave up some nice fish as it always does. Thanks to Marcel for taking great care of us again we could not be happier. Can't wait till next year !"
2093257,NARDA 1,2013-09-09 16:24:00,636,Most of the gang at our favorite non-fishing spot.
1328592,v-bay gord,2011-07-11 21:04:00,3168,"Ha! Steve and Marge from Mukwonago......great people and a lot of fun when they are here! I am trying to get them up here this winter for a little ice fishing..... Interesting how things are interconnected! And yes, the fish fry and running a lodge is a lot of work......good on Cheryl and Marcel for tackling it......it is dissapointing when you have the unsatisfied guest. Everyone has them and we all take it way too personally...."
1331543,oxdrift2,2011-07-19 10:10:00,37,"I have been going to Birchdale for 16 years. The Lodge is fantastic. We were sad to see it sold, but very impressed with the new owners, Cheryl and Marcel. They are now more than owners , they are our friends. In regards to the cabin comment. You stayed at a fishing lodge. What do you expect. Their cabins are VERY GOOD! If you have a problem, you have to speak up. The owners do not bother you or come to your cabin. you do go up north to get away don't you? In regards to the fish fry. How much did it cost you? Thats right its FREE!!!!!!!!!!!! In regards to fishing. The old saying goes, its fishing not catching. You spent how much on a fishing trip and would not try and get a guide the first time you went. You must be real good. We still get a guide from time to time as we learn new spots and possibly new ways to fish. I will be back in September as part of the NARDA group. Give Birchdale another chance, this time with an open mind. Thanks, NARDA 3"
1350848,Danbear,2011-09-19 09:05:00,72,"Just got back Saturday, made our 4th trip to Birch Dale Lodge what a blast, fishing was better then ever, weather was as different as it can get, met some great people from this site, everyone seemed to have a great time. The Wing night on Sunday hosted by the NARDA group was awesome. Cheryl and Marcel treated us like kin, I couldn't be happier with how our trip went except for the long ride home."
1351182,NARDA 1,2011-09-20 08:30:00,636,"Don't know if I can say it any better Danbear, it was great meeting you and your group as well as the several other Walleye Central members that were in camp. Cheryl and Marcel, my group and I cannot thank you enough for making our trip a very enjoyable and memorable experience. You were the perfect hosts, the facilities were great and the food was awesome, especially the ribs. You have our deposits for next year and we will see you at the All Canada show in St. Charles, IL."
1356030,bobbylfishermon,2011-10-07 13:25:00,241,"The new owners, cheryl and Marcel Pinite are busting their rumps to please old and new customers alike!! we found the the cabins spotless and enjoyed our stay with them, fishing on Eagle lake is always good , if you know what you're doing, like most lakes,we'll be back to Birchdale!!!"
1356195,fishinnut 3446,2011-10-08 09:24:00,638,"Ok,I had to chime in again,I was lucky enough my wife let me and my son go on a 2nd trip this year to Birchdale lodge.Sept trip was to meet NARDA&Danbear great guy's.Now I have to tell you about July trip,my family was in camp the same week as the party posting this and after talking to Marcel in Sept. we only stayed 2 cabins away! Remember these people well all I can say is BS!You say Marcel is a ,I can say I've stayed with the new owners 3 times now, yea I see Marcel drink but come on man!He's got to put up with people like you!Great new owners!,great people!you can't go wrong staying at BDL!Will be back in July.Sorry for the rant,fishinnut."
1756961,Danbear,2013-05-08 13:29:00,72,"The boat is out of storage after a long Wisconsin winter now have to get tuned up for our annual trip to Birch Dale Lodge, if you have never been you don't know what your missing. We will be there for NARDA week this year and get to quaff some Rye with our NARDA brothers, Marcel and Ernie. It should make for a great trip. We leave August 23rd with a Friday night stop in I-Falls and on to Eagle lake on Saturday. Waiting for the best week of the year !"
1757601,NARDA 1,2013-05-08 17:38:00,636,It is NARDA'S 25th year at Birch Dale and several of the groups in camp this year will be friends from previous years. All I can say is that it is going to be an awesome year with all the friends we have met over the years in camp. Can't wait!!!!!!
1757897,boynurse77,2013-05-08 19:19:00,8,The days cannot pass fast enough. NARDA week is going to be great at birchdale.

1292776,NARDA 1,2011-04-09 10:36:00,636,"Have never heard of sheephead. Sounds like we will have to convert you over to ""RYE"" and they won't run out of that!!!!"
1327699,Guest,2011-07-09 09:42:00,0,We stayed at Birchdale under the new ownership of Marcel and Cheryl. It was a horrible experience. The cabin leaked in several places when it rained. The ice box would not get cold. The dryer in the laundry was broke and unusable. The ac didn't blow cold. As far as the fishing. It was horrible. The only people at the camp that caught anything went with a guide. Marcel was very unhelpful and extremely rude! The only advise that they give you is to get a guide. All Marcel wants to do is drink beer. At the Wed fish fry they didn't even serve fresh fish. It was store bought white fish! They tried to push live bait on us to buy from them but we didn't catch one thing on live bait. The last night out on the lake my seat in the boat broke and I fell and landed On my daughters arm. She injured her side and arm and I injured my back. All Marcel said/did was say they have ordered new seats for the boats. They also try to stick you with a bunch of charges. They are dishonest. I would never recommend birch Dale to anyone.
1327715,Danbear,2011-07-09 11:38:00,72,"Sorry you had a bad time but I will be going back for my 4th time in September and I wouldn't be going back if I wasn't satisfied with the lodge and the owners, I find it to be a great place to go."
1327722,v-bay gord,2011-07-09 12:21:00,3168,"I can't comment on your stay, but I can say the fishing on Eagle has been very good (guide or no guide).....and excellent in the area where you stayed. Sorry your experience was different but I don't believe it to be the norm."
1327724,NARDA 1,2011-07-09 12:38:00,636,"Something tells me that your only telling part of the story. I have spent some time with Cheryl and Marcel at camp and at the sport shows and have found them to be very helpful and gracious. If it was your first time on the lake, which it seams like it was, it would have been very wise and informative to take out a guide for one day. and I seriously doubt they tried to push anything on you or make any unnecesary charges. Needless to say my group will be returning to Birch Dale Lodge for our 23rd year this September and for many years to come.... Terry Wessel"
1327743,fishinnut 3446,2011-07-09 13:54:00,638,"I just got back from Birch Dale 6:30 this morning,and I would have to agree with v-gord the fishing just seems to be getting better every year we have gone!(7yrs.at Birch Dale) 5yrs. with Greg&Ernie and now 2 with Marcel&Cheryl,and like Terry said if indeed it was your 1st time on Eagle I too would have recommened A guide, Greg still does guiding and is great at what he does,everyone that went with him this week limited out.I can only hope for 2 trips this year,the 2nd would be in Sept. with NARDA& Danbear I keep hearing about that wing night! Jamie"
1327758,BDL,2011-07-09 14:47:00,1,"All I can say is that there were 50 people in camp, 10 cabins and 8 RV sites. There was only one group that seemed to have issues.There were plenty of groups that caught fish without a guide, we supply a map and point out spots to fish, if you have no luck trying a few different things then we offer guide service. Live Bait is very un-profitable and there is no need to push sales. If we recommend live bait it is because we want our customers to catch fish and live bait seems to work very well. Wednesday night fish fry is made up of Walleye, Northern Pike and White Fish. We include our families limit of walleye and pike for the fish fry. Some customers donate their fish and that is included as well. If there is not enough to feed the entire camp we add white fish so that everybody gets some. It is illegal for our family to hold anymore fresh fish than what our limits will allow. As far as the cabin leaking, the AC, or even the ice box. We do stress to all our customers to let us know if something is not working. If we don't know it is broken we can't fix it. This is our second season in the business and you can't build Rome overnight. We just fix things as we go - we just need to know about it. The bill is no surprise to any of our customers, there are absolutely no hidden charges, if there are extra charges such as prop damage etc. this is a new charge and is only billed when the situation arises. It is unfortunate that you had a bad experience, we do our best to meet and exceed everyone's expectations."
1328536,Danbear,2011-07-11 17:47:00,72,"I could eat Marcel's whitefish everyday even if it was begged, borrowed or stolen, just thinking about sitting around the picnic table eating fishing, drinking beer and swapping fish stories is enough to make me cry. This was my fish fry from last year. Come on September."
1328539,v-bay gord,2011-07-11 17:58:00,3168,"We have served whitefish (from the same source as Marcel's) for the past nineteen years at our fish fry, and I can only remember 100% of the folk loving it. It is great fish! I just don't understand the mentality of someone who would have the gall to b#tch about it........but I suppose when you are on a b#tch rampage why hold back? That comment has bothered me since I read it, but I thought I would hold my tongue, but since you brought it up again......"
1328587,Danbear,2011-07-11 20:53:00,72,"V-BAYIt bothered me too because I know how hard Cheryl and Marcel work at taking care of everybody. By the way one of my employees(Steve from Mukwonago) stays at your place every year I think he was there 2 weeks ago, I hope he behaved himself, I haven't heard his fish stories yet."
1262305,Guest,2011-01-17 07:32:00,0,"Three of us stayed at Birch Dale lodge four years ago. We booked the trip at an All Canada show. Our experience at the lodge was disappointing. They promised to point out places to fish and they always tried to get us to hire Greg, as a guide, but we could not afford to do that. After two days of struggling to find fish, the dock kids were helpful and showed us places on the lake map to get us started. That was a big help on a lake as huge as Eagle Lake. If the lodge has new operators, perhaps the business model will change."
1262407,MC620,2011-01-17 13:44:00,91,Check out Vermilion Bay Lodge while you're at it. The owner is a great guy and will not hold back in helping you out. I think his name is Gord........He was fantastic to us when we were there.
1262480,fishmaster,2011-01-17 17:33:00,209,Yes his name is Gord Bastable and runs a GREAT camp. He will show you or either give you a marked lake map. Been going for many years now and he never let's you down.
1274357,Danbear,2011-02-23 11:57:00,72,"I have stayed at Birchdale on my last 3 Canada trips and love the place reminds me of the Northern Wisconsin resorts I went to as a kid with my parents and Grandparents. The new owners are fantastic and really go all out to insure you are taken care. The fishing gets better every year as I find new spots of my own that aren't on the map, that's half the fun of it.I will be going up again in September and can't wait !"
1274666,41jims,2011-02-24 09:25:00,30,I would be interested to here about the camping facilities at Birchdale. Is it a nice camp area and is there any other resorts on Eagle Lake that have camping facilities. thanks
1274983,Ia Walihntr,2011-02-25 07:20:00,320,"After a little reseach, it appears that there are only three lodges on Eagle Lake that offer camping. They are: Birchdale Lodge www.birchdalelodge.com Cedar Point Lodge www.cedarpointlodge.com Sportsmen's Lodge www.eaglelakesportsmenslodge.com The first two have camping rates on thier websites but Sportsmen's lodge does not. However, Sportsmen's Lodge is listed on a website as having a campground. http://www.ontariotowns.net/Vermilio...ampgrounds.cfm Marv"
1275206,41jims,2011-02-25 15:50:00,30,Thanks Ia Walihntr I will look into it.
1289684,Danbear,2011-04-01 14:24:00,72,Nothing beats stitting at the bar at Birchdale after a great day fishing with your best friend since 2nd grade. I think I am on NARDA'S barstool.

Either that or charge you rent!!!!Doesn't look like your buddy is drinking the right stuff though...."
1291778,boynurse77,2011-04-06 18:32:00,8,We ran out of Bourbon and drank Birchdale out of bourbon so we had to go to plan B. What is the rent for the barstool? I am sure we can work something out. Do any of your group know how to play sheephead? I can not wait till our canada fishing trip this year.
569870,idapaul,2007-11-26 14:36:00,82,"has anybody stayed at birchdale lodge on eagle lake?if so were they helpful about putting you on fish, musky in particular. what were facilities like? thanks in advance for any info."
569873,Guest,2007-11-26 22:41:00,0,"We stay at birchdale in 2004 and 2005, Fishing was ok, cabins ok, but the service wasn't pretty bad. We found Camp Manitou at the chicago All Canada show and have been very happy with them. We go only for Musky (that's why I am replying to your post). They are very big, and there is no traffic compared to eagle lake. We went in 2006 and twice in 2007, and we have booked our first already for next year. I think there web site is www.campmanitoufishing.net Good luck on your search. Greg"
569890,Guest,2007-11-28 16:18:00,0,"Talk to Greg at Birchdale Lodge about musky fishing....he does plenty of it, as well as guiding, and should be able to help you if you are there."

569955,Guest,2007-12-08 11:55:00,0,"Our experience was similar to Johnson Charters. We stayed at Birchdale in one of their cabins for a week. When we asked for fishing information, they tried to steer us to their guide service and Greg. The best advice we got was from other fishermen on the lake and by using our own maps. The cabins were just OK. The walleye fishing was tough because of the Mayfly hatch. I have stayed at other resorts on Eagle Lake & have found their owners more willing to share fishing information."

My group of 8-10 guys has been staying at Birch Dale Lodge for 22 years and have found the owners and staff to be extremely helpful no matter what was asked of them. The accomodations are very nice and clean and you can't beat the ""grill your own steakhouse"" (The Bullpit) that is on the premises. Greg is a fantastic guide for any of the species avalible on Eagle Lake especially for Musky and will help you any way he can. The lodge changed ownership this last spring. (2010) The new owners are Cheryl and Marcel Pinette. We stayed with them in September and had a great time and are planning on returning for many years to come. They are also commited to helping there guests any way they can. Thanks, Terry"
