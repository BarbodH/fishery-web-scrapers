I think either lodge sounds great, but am wondering if one is much closer to that area than the other. I think it'd be at least a 30 minute run with a lodge boat with a 50hp to that area from LSL, not sure how long it would take from Onaway.Does anyone have thoughts about LSL vs. Onaway? Opinions on one lodge vs the other, and how long is the ride from Onaway to that area? Thanks!"
2079274,SinOrSwim,2013-09-03 10:38:00,1528,"Be the exact same trip. We go to Onaway and Lac Seul Lodge is just up the road from Onaway. And, yes 30 min is about the trip. The onaway boats with 50hp motors do about 24 to 26mph according to my GPS"

The distance to Manitoba Point, Stoney Point, McKenzie Bay, etc. would be about the same from either lodge. I do know LSL is a very fine lodge and I have never been disappointed with a stay. The cabins are very clean and comfortable and the boats are top notch. I think you would be happy with a stay there. If you happen to be there the second or third week of June next year, look me up, I will be in cabin #2. Steve"
2079450,Carnhzkr,2013-09-03 11:56:00,964,"Thanks, Steve. Do you know if the shortcut to get from LSL to the Bay of Islands is usually open that time of year? When we stayed at Sunlight in August, we were able to get through there. The guy that led us to Sunlight told me it's only open in the summer. It looks like if it was not open, that would add a considerable distance."
2079538,2746,2013-09-03 12:24:00,3206,I've stayed at both and both are nice. Onaway is a Friday to Friday place while LSL is Saturday to Saturday if that makes a difference. Others have described the travel well.
