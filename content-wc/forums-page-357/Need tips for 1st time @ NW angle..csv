I would appreciate any tips on locations and bait to use. I would imagine it will be a minnow/jig set-up, but how about leeches/crawlers on a jig and crawler/spinners/bottom bouncers? Crawlers have to be in bedding to bring across border, right? Thank you to all that respond!"
2063065,fishnutbob,2013-08-27 15:47:00,633,"I found this in another fishing forum for you. Up at the NW Angle, walleye steady in deep rocky structures 22-25 feet. Use a dead minnow with Chartreuse jig north of Skeet Island and near Little Oak Island. Pike and musky very active in deep weed beds late afternoon/evenings using cowgirls. Smallmouth bass are active along shorelines. Spinner baits and crank baits the go to method."
2063778,Flag Island,2013-08-27 20:29:00,32,"Just try points and rock piles for walleyes, you don't have to go far to catch fish. Muskys can be along any shoreline and everyone up there will help you. Fishing at the angle has been great all summer."

2064458,Stu,2013-08-28 07:01:00,472,We have been thinking about planning a trip to the Angle for some time. Please let me know how you do.
2085817,oly67,2013-09-06 05:49:00,241,I will let you know. Leaving tomorrow.
