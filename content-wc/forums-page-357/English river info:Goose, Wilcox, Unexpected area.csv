2093249,ret-ro,2013-09-09 16:17:00,41,"Well our first trip to the area was a success! Thanks to all for the info and tips. We started off jigging and went away from it right away because the fish were scattered a bit. We had the most success running 1 oz bottom bouncers and spinners. We caught fish in Wilcox, Unexpected, Goose and the river channel. Crawlers, leeches and power bait swimshads were all catching fish. Depths we found fish were from 7-20 fow with the vast majority of walleyes from 16""-20"". Our biggest walleyes were 24.5"" & 25"". Me and my buddy boated 271 fish in three and a half days. We trolled cranks for a bit one evening but only got a few fish and mostly small pike."

Got a last minute opportunity to fish the area in Early September, but I know nothing about it. Let me know and thanks in advance.Walleyes will be the main target."
2061969,BreezyPoint,2013-08-27 09:46:00,1581,"Spent last week there. This is a great fishery. We fished mainly Wilcox and Unexpected. There are walleyes everywhere in this system.Right now, there is a raging current, strongest I have ever seen. Some of the spots that I like to fish in current didn't hold fish as I think the current was too strong. There was a hint of white water at the mouth of Wilcox in 91 feet of water to give you an idea of the current.We caught our best walleyes in Wilcox in 5-24 feet of water using gulp. This was in the east end off the island. If you use live bait, you will catch more. We also caught many walleyes trolling crank baits along rock shoals and flats in about 10 feet of water. This bite was a little slower, but produced quality fish.I love this area, it is a great fishery that I first fished in 1965 and the fishing is better now than it was then. Take care of this fishery. We removed the front treble on our crank baits and replaced trebles on spoons with barbless single siwash hooks. This made releasing northerns very easy.Where will you be staying and are you bringing your own boat?"
2062641,ret-ro,2013-08-27 13:34:00,41,Thanks for the report and info Breezy! We are staying in a cabin on Wilcox and fishing out of some boats stored there.
2064642,BreezyPoint,2013-08-28 08:23:00,1581,Is this the cabin on the west side of the river at the mouth of Wilcox?
2065162,BreezyPoint,2013-08-28 11:08:00,1581,"Sorry, I meant to say east side!"
2066858,ret-ro,2013-08-29 05:51:00,41,Yes
2067626,BreezyPoint,2013-08-29 09:42:00,1581,Give us a report when you get back...
2068906,ret-ro,2013-08-29 17:49:00,41,Will do
2079010,jigfisher9,2013-09-03 09:19:00,23,"I too just got back from fishing this area(8/24-8/30) and we did very well in these two lakes. My dad and I caught 300 Walleye and Pike for the week. We use jig and minnows mostly but plastics work ok. In goose we fish a area on the south side of the river near the green and white cabin. There is 40-60' of water in the channel that goes up to a flat area that is 8-16' of water that we caught a slug of eater sized walleyes around. The other boat with us picked up a 30"" eye on Wednesday.We saw many boats fishing out if front of the outpost cabin at the mouth of goose and heard reports of a large musky caught in that area as well as many 18"" + walleyes. We fished mainly Goose and Wilcox all week and never went into Unexpected....another group said it was a waste of a trip the day they were there so we did not take the time.If the cabin you are staying in is the Pizza Guys cabin we fished the bay that his dock is located on and caught a 36"" Pike and 2- 17"" smallies. The guy that takes care of the cabin was out there and said he caught a 41.5"" Pike off the dock using a perch. Good luck and you should enjoy the area....the cabin is pretty sweet from what I can tell."
2080322,BreezyPoint,2013-09-03 17:22:00,1581,"Interesting report. We caught an awful lot of really nice fish in Unexpected the week we were there and had the whole to ourselves to boot. The interesting thing is, we didn't catch many walleyes in the traditional spots. We did our best trolling crank baits in 10-12 feet of water in the middle of bays. We had trouble catching a 17 incher to eat. We also caught a lot of walleyes in the river channel between the cabin and the mouth of Unexpected. This was also trolling crank baits in 5-8 feet of water."
