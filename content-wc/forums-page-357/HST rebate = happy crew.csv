I wasn't sure if the refund application was going to work or not, so I didn't tell anyone else until after I got the refund. The result was we all got $60 back. Gotta love the responses I got from our fishing crew: Ron: ""If they are going to pay us to come there we should go more often!"" Pat: ""Boy o boy, truer words were never spoken. I would leave today!!!"" Jim: ""I got $60 down payment, let's go."""

I just got my ""rejection"" letter for my HST rebate, I was denied because they didn't understand the invoices and said I needed to describe the outfitter's ""Services"" more clearly. I sent them more documentation, a lot of time & effort for a $26 check that I can't cash locally."
