2021978,Guest,2013-08-12 05:23:00,0,"They didn't open this year. Sorry if it was for family reasons. Nothing on there website to indicate why. On a side note, there's a lot less fishing pressure on the shallow side of Lady Evelyn, especialy at American Point."
2037514,family fishing,2013-08-18 08:28:00,1,Hi I tried to book a trip at red pine but was closed I really wanted to try this lake so I booked a week at Mitchel camp has anyone stayed here? This will be my first time on this lake I am familiar with fishing in Quebec and Ontario but trying to find a better place for walleye and it seems the smallmouth are a bonus .

2039145,adempsey,2013-08-19 00:31:00,963,"I don't know much about Mitchell's Camp, but was always curious about it. I think it's near the dam on Lady Evelyn, but not quite sure. The two times I went, both summer trips five years ago, we did reasonably well with the walleye and bass. I guess it depends on what you're used to. It's not a fly-in outpost, but I'd say the fishing can be as good as a fly-in lodge."
2039809,Pikeslayer8,2013-08-19 09:07:00,1460,Nice fish der FC!

2079770,villain189,2013-09-03 14:05:00,33,"Mitchell's Camp is VERY rustic. Used to go there in the 80's and not much has changed then other than they now have propane grills. Pump your water from the lake, chop your ice with an axe from the ice house, no electricity other than a generator to power some lightbulbs in the evening. I called last year to inquire and they said it's basically the same as it was when it was built over 70 years ago. If you are up for rustic you'll enjoy it. The price is definitely right! Another nice feature we saw guys enjoying at Mitchells is the sandbar on the back of the island. On hot days you see guys sitting out in a foot of water in camp chairs with a cooler of beer stashed on the shore. If you are looking for somewhere with more amenities try Ellen Island which is right across from Mitchells. Mitchells is the island just past Ellen Island on your right as you are heading into the lake from Mowatts. It's basically between Ellen Island and Red Pine. The other camps on the lake are Island10 and Garden Island. We just got back from Ellen Island a few days ago and had a great week. Excellent accommodations & fishing...didn't have to venture far from camp to catch fish."
1759809,npe100,2013-05-09 10:38:00,2,"Lady Evelyn is a great lake with some superb outfitters! Our group went here in 2008 and 2009 and had our best catching year in Canada ever in 2009. That's the good news. The bad news is from our experience the ontario slot sucks. You're forced to throw back the best eating size fish and the majority of the outfitters on the lake highly frown upon keeping anything over the slot (trophy size) for any reason. keeping or eating anything below the slot is difficult to fillet (becomes more like work than fun as your working for every morsel)... For these reasons if you are a catch and release only fisherman/woman and like to eat small walleye, sheephead, smaller pike, or even bass, then I say you'll have a great time. We may go back one day to try out all our discovered hot spots... If you're interested in exact locations, PM me and I'll let you know where I'd go if heading back to Lady Evelyn. Cheers, Nate"
1760121,alberta bum,2013-05-09 11:51:00,312,"FIshed lady Evelyn last year for the first time ever. The upper end of the lake held a lot of smaller eyes that were easy too catch in the evenings,, just look for wid blown points island. The lower end or big end was deeper and held bigger fish.. Once again wind blown points and islands were the best spots. There is one island in the big end that holds a bunch of float planes,, the 2 islands just above those was an excellent spot In the evenings,, there is also a underwater island in the area.. Jig,,lot of them in 1/8 1/4 5/16oz"
1857033,1-shot,2013-06-11 13:17:00,35,"Well our group returned from our first trip to Lady Evelyn this past Saturday. Fished June 1st thru 8th. Overall we had a terrific time. The fishing was difficult at times with the majority of fish being caught in the evening. Most fish were caught on 1/8 oz. jig with minnow. Water temp was between 55 and 63F. Didn't really have much luck trolling our standard lure assortments. Lots of underwater timber made trolling the shore lines a challenge. The lake was really rough for a couple of days which limited our range. We were forced to stay near our cabin (Ellen island) and use the islands as shelter from the rough water on those days. Our group of five averaged between 7-20 fish per person per day (many of these fish in the slot limit). The largest walleye was 24.5 and largest pike 29. Although the scenery and accomodations were great, overall I was not really satisfied with the fishing. Not sure if it was a result of the weather (inconsistent winds) but I was expecting the fishing to be a bit better than what we experienced. I also was a bit surprised to see quite a number of boats on the water in a non-road access lake. Don't think we will go back to lady Evelyn but probably try someplace else next year. Still happy we got the oppurtunity to see/fish Lady Evelyn.regards,1-shot"
1857105,rwl,2013-06-11 13:59:00,1655,"Nagagami brings back memories, was there in 1984-or 85, Uncles private cabin that was up a river a bit. Caught over 400 eyes in a week, amazing back then, I always wonder what it is like now. We went to Joe ""Kuehls""? resort for barrels of gas, fished Debbie island a lot, just amazing week up there, thanks for the memory jog."
1859017,adempsey,2013-06-12 08:13:00,963,"That's unfortunate about the fishing 1-shot. I think we've all had those types of trips on occasion, I know I have. It really is a great fishery though.As for the boat traffic, not really sure. It might be a combination of the time of year and the location of Ellen Island. The camp is much closer to the entry point compared to Island 10 and Garden Island.The times I went I think I only saw one non-camp boat and some canoers. There are a couple cottages on the lake in that area though, but not many."
2018186,mjmayer188,2013-08-09 14:45:00,3,"Waldorf, I have fished Lady Evelyn a few times, but I have never heard of the Elephants ***. If for no other reason than to immpress the boys I am fishing with, where is the ""Elephant's ***""?"
2020298,Guest,2013-08-11 06:08:00,0,"There was an island out in front of the lodge that everyone trolled and still fished in the evening. There was a rockslide on this particular island that formed a hump as it extended out from the island. To the right was a small opening where water flowed through in between another island. That was what he was calling the Elephant area. So it was the back end of the bigger island. I don't remember how far the island was from the lodge, Garden Island. we stayed at, but was pretty close and the cabins faced towards it. They sent everyone there to fish in the evening."
2020810,Guest,2013-08-11 11:27:00,0,"Also called ""hole in the wall"" by Island 10'ers. Can be good in the evening with the right wind. Anyone hear an update on the closure of Red Pine Wilderness Lodge?"

1754321,1-shot,2013-05-07 19:09:00,35,"Hello wc members. Me and a group of five others will be on lady Evelyn Lake the first week of June. This will be our first time on lady Evelyn. We have fished osullivan Lake in Nakina, Lake nagagami in hornepayne, And dog Lake in missinabie. I am wondering how Lady Evelyn will compare to these lakes. We have done very well on O'Sullivan and nagagami in the past But like to experience new areas. Does anyone have any pointers on what areas we should try and what type of tackle we should use? We usually jig and troll Rapalas for most of our fish We Will be targeting walleyes and northern pike. How does lady Evelyn compare to these lakes? Thank you for any input."

1754873,adempsey,2013-05-07 22:27:00,963,"I've been to Evelyn twice and Nagagami last year. Although, we go the first week of July usually.The fishing is good on Evelyn, but was probably a bit better on Nagagami. However, we had non-stop action for smaller 14-16"" Walleye several nights on Evelyn. There are some large fish in Evelyn, but they were consistently larger in Nagagami.The nice thing about Evelyn is the smallmouth bass. Plenty of great smallie fishing as well. Never did that well for pike. There are also some portage lakes you can hit for pike, bass, walleye and trout.On Evelyn we always fished <15 FOW [although, if it's bright&sunny and midday we would go deeper/troll or target smallmouth or pike]. On Nagagami, it was always 15 to 40 FOW.As for gear. Typical walleye and pike gear. Jigs with minnow/worm/plastic grubs, bottom bouncers, trolling cranks during the day. There are plenty of nice little bays for pike, but we only ever managed a few small guys the times we went. I think other guys had better luck trolling around these bays.Evelyn will always be one of my favorite lakes. I always consider going back each year, but the AP lodges are expensive and the price of the HK lodge is similar enough in price to a fly-in lodge. You'll have a great time, I wouldn't be concerned."
1755089,Guest,2013-05-08 05:49:00,0,Our group experienced some very good walleye fishing on Lady Evelyn the third week in June last year. I haven't fished the other two lakes you mentioned but the fishing does compare to other walleye lakes we've fished with perhaps a better shot a trophy walleye due to the lunker release program the lodges encourage. We are making our third trip to Lady Evelyn this year so we can't be considered experts on the lake. Aside from picking up occasional fish while trolling to locate schools we really hit three areas that produced non-stop action on 16 to 21 inch fish while jigging. Also took fish at 27 and 28 inches on the troll. Surface poping for smallmouth is a plus. Pike have been typically in the 22 to 24 inch class but I know from past experience that a 38 or 40 inch fish can come along at any time. Good luck and enjoy. Lady Evelyn is a beauty.

1755977,Guest,2013-05-08 08:55:00,0,"Can't give away locations under penalty of death. One spot was in the rain and wind between two islands. We were wet (even in our rainsuits) but happy. The spot produced later but never like it did in the rain and wind. Another spot was also aided by a strong wind blowing into a bay. The walleye would hit almost up to the shoreline before we had to reposition. There were other guys fishing the school but it was obvious that a whistler jig and half nightcrawler was the lure to use. Many fish in the 20 inch range. We fish with conservation licenses so it was mainly an education process for the walleye. The year before was a tough one with a full moon and east wind. We found many fish in a shallow bay with lots of company. The fish did run smaller that day, but that week produced three between 25 and 29 inches for me at various places on the lake. We trolled hot'n'tots and bumped the bottom in that bay."
1756137,1-shot,2013-05-08 09:54:00,35,Thank you all very much for all of the excellent feedback. It never ceases to amaze me how knowldegable and helpful the members of this forum are. 23 days before we depart. Can't wait. I will definitely post a summary of our trip when I return.Cheers1-shot
1757537,Guest,2013-05-08 16:57:00,0,"I fished on lady Evelyn lake once in July. Could not find any pike in the typical spots around weeds or rocks like other Canadian lakes I have fished. Did see a large one at the dock feeding on minnows. Caught one smallmouth on a shad rap one night at 17"" and a few small ones during the day but could not locate them either. Caught walleye trolling Shadlings in the evening at a place called The Slide and when it was cloudy. The other big plan was anchor in certain spots with live minnows( this was a while ago) and wait for the schools to come in towards evening. Best spot was called Elephants ***. All the camps knew this so you had to get there early to get a spot. It was tough fishing back then, sunny and bright all but one day, certainly better fishing now. There were several large groups of college age women canoeing and camping throughout the park. Dropped some fresh walleye off for them to cook up. Good luck there."
