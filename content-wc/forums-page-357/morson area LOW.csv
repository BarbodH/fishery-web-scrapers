2083466,fldoc,2013-09-05 06:21:00,47,"I am looking at the Morson area on LOW to fish staying at Mylies Place resort in mid-sept. I want to fish for walleyes, northerns and crappies. Can anyone provide me with any +/- information on the fishing and resort. Randy from Duluth"

Mid-Sept is generally points and maybe current - generally 20-30 feet. I prefer jigs and minnows, but plastics and crawlers work, too. So does trolling spinners. After dinner, you can walk down to the point on Mylies side of the bay and shore fish. I think the point drops to 40' and can provide quite a few walleyes."

2085913,bob888,2013-09-06 06:35:00,244,"I've been staying at Mylies for one or twice a year for close to 20 years. Up to date cabins that are air conditioned, mattresses are new and good. Clean towels provided daily. Docks are big and wide. Justin and crew are to be complimented for how they run the resort."
2085953,fldoc,2013-09-06 06:47:00,47,Thanks for the quick info. I fished LOW twice in the winter out of River Bend Resort and enjoyed the trip. I am curious as to summer fishing and I picked Morson as it appears to have more protection for my 18 ft boat verses the Baudette area. My brother and friends come up once a summer from Memphis and we typically fish in Canada. We fished LaSeul last year and Sag-Northern Lights just 2 weeks ago. One in our group enjoys casting for northerns-smallmouth / action and is not a good walleye jig fisherman. So looking for an area that has a variety of fishing opportunities that we can go to and I can take my boat safely to. Randy from Duluth
