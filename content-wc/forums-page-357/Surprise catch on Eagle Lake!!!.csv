2075849,v-bay gord,2013-09-02 08:28:00,3168,Very nice. Why does Tom look so depressed?
2075953,NARDA 1,2013-09-02 08:47:00,636,I think that is his serious look.

2077697,Duflebag,2013-09-02 19:03:00,218,"Nice fish. Narda, we are coming up to Vermilion Bay this Saturday. Too bad we won't be up at the same time."
2077849,2746,2013-09-02 19:38:00,3206,"Very nice fish and I can visualize the fight he must have provided. It's been several years since I was at V gord's on vermilion bay. That year one of the guys fishing from my boat hooked into something I would guess might have looked like that but we never saw it. Spent about 10 minutes making one run after another and finally broke off....unseen. The guy that had him on dropped his rod to the bottom of the boat, his cigar fell from his mouth and landed in my tackle box while he sat there with a stare on his face saying, ""I've never experienced anything like that""! I now understand why guys will cast all day for a chance to catch one or see a couple of follows. They are an awesome fish and also seem to like vermilion bay."
2079594,NARDA 1,2013-09-03 12:39:00,636,"I was lookin for you and figured you must have been busy. We had a great week, the fishing was quite good. Hopefully we will see you next year."
