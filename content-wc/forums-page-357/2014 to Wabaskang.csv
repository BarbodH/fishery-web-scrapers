Started out being the wife & I and then the daughter ask if her & the son-in-law could come along. We are up to four! Who knows before we get there. We are going to Tall Pines in mid July. Wabaskang is just about perfect as it is not to big & not to small in my opinion and we catch fish! Later, Jay"
