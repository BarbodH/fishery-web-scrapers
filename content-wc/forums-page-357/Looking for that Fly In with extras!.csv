I heard somewhere once that there was a fly in fishing outfit in Ontario that would give you a cabin/ bunkhouse to stay in at their main base, a hot dinner the night before, and a breakfast before your flight out to the fly in cabin. All for free, no extra cost, or well, part of their package rate perhaps. Does anyone know which outfit this may be? There could be a few for all I know. Thanks! JD"

2089050,packpro,2013-09-07 17:47:00,695,You can have a flyin and have dinner and breakfast served everyday. You won't be the only boat on the lake unless you take one of three great portages. You may see one or two other boats during the week. It is a high end flyin with good/great fishing. We have 16 going this year. It will be our tenth. trip in 15 years.
