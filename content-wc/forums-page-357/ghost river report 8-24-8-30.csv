I just want to thank all the walleye central members that gave me advice on the lodge especially Larry Mac. We had the best walleye trip I have ever been on. I have been to canada serveral times and this is the best walleye fishing I have ever experienced. In the 7 days my wife and I were there we caught 496 walleyes. our biggest (i should say my wife's) was 25"". and amazingly caught ten 24""ers plus a 24 1/4"" and a 24 3/4"".plus a 39"" pike. Most of our fish (especially the bigger ones) came on a lindy rig and crawler with 1/2 oz sinker with a 5 to 4 foot snell. 6 pound test sensation. also caught plenty of fish on 1/4 and 3/8 oz jig and salted minnows. this was the first time I have used salted minnows and they worked as good as the real thing. the majority of the fish were in 18-30ft. also experienced my first 100 day . day 1 19 fish day 2 63 fish day 3 74 fish day 4 48 fish day 5 117 fish day 6 100 fish day 7 75 fish darrell and Tena run an excellent camp and tena's cooking is fabulous"
