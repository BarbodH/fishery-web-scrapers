I've just recently learned how to troll for walleyes using worm harnesses (1 oz bottom bouncers, worm harness rig with double hook, slow troll in 15-25 feet). I wish I would have took the time to experiment years ago.Is the method for trolling minnows the same? Is the same amount of weight needed? Is a floating rig needed?Thanks!"
2078826,2746,2013-09-03 08:48:00,3206,"Yep, pretty much the same except, of course, you will use the single hook minnow harness. Not the double hook used for crawlers. Over the years I have moved away from the purchased harness with spinners and simply tie snells of various lengths that I add a couple of beads to just ahead of the hook.....no spinner. I also avoid a bottom bouncer unless we are in extreme snags and opt to use a sliding weight of 1/4, 3/8, or 1/2 depending on the depth and speed of the troll. I can ""feel"" the bite much better with the lighter weight but be sure you can keep the presentation on the bottom."
2079090,Carnhzkr,2013-09-03 09:39:00,964,"Like Larry said, whether you're using crawlers or minnows or leaches or Gulp, the method's the same. The weight of your bouncer is dependent upon a few factors:1) depth2) current3) speedPersonally, I prefer to use as light of a bouncer as I can. The lightest that allows me to effectively feel the bottom. In lake water, that's usually 3/4 or 1 oz and I like to troll just fast enough to allow the blades to turn. I also agree with Larry about using a slip type weight, such as a bait walker or Lindy Rig weight if you can. My problem is I always use braided line, and I've found that those types of weights fray braided line. I actually hate using bottom bouncers since they are so tangly and heavy, but I use them almost exclusively because I've never found anything else that catches walleyes as well - at least for me. I'm much better at catching walleyes using bouncers than jigging."
2079706,Lovetofish,2013-09-03 13:38:00,458,Try using a 1/2 oz chain sinker and attach a Little Joe spinner.
2079946,Bill Krejca,2013-09-03 15:13:00,6107,"As stated above. I might add if the bottom is snaggie, I like the Phelps Floater which has a flat surface on the top and curved on the bottom of the floating body - this type tends to push the bait up off the bottom as it is trolled. I have used few outfits which keeps the minnow in as good of shape, swimming, as this one does. Bill"
