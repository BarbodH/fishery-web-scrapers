2085258,v-bay gord,2013-09-05 19:52:00,3168,"weather this week has been great. Fishing has been very good. Fish are shallower than normal.......good walleye catches in as shallow as 12 feet, plus the deeper spots as well. Good lake trout action. Lot's of muskies being seen...they never bite unless fishing for walleye or pike. Some posts on what's going on at my blog... www.electricbeaver.ca Lot's of great places to fish up here.....Eagle is one but not the only one."
2085306,WowMarie,2013-09-05 20:03:00,19,Fished Eagle Lake all last week...best fishing in the last 4 years. Lots of slot Walleye and Pike..and a few over slot as a bonus. Not hard to catch nice lunch fish at all. It was very hot last week and fish were pretty deep 25-35 fow. Pike were in the weeds when it cooled off on Thurs and had a lot of fun with them. We stay on the south end of the lake..we do not have to go far for great fishing.
