2082017,lawson2343,2013-09-04 11:18:00,459,"Hi,So I crossed on Thursday. My wife and I each had a 1.75 bottle. You are allowed a 1.14.When asked about alcohol, I answered that we each ""had a bottle"". The officer then asked the size and I told them 1.75. She wrote out a slip and I had to go inside to pay the duty.The duty for both bottles was just over $14. Which I thought was very reasonable. This duty was based on 1.75 - 1.14 = .61 X 2.There is NO way I will buy a 1.75 liter bottle in Canada.Here is something to use for comparison. I brought a 1.75 of Gilbey's Gin that I paid $15. With duty of roughly $7+, I paid $22 for a 1.75. Stopped at the LCBO and a 1.14 of Gilbey's was $38.So, 1.75 for $22 and have to go inside and pay or 1.14 for $38 and have to stop at LCBO. BTW, took me about 3 minutes to go inside and pay. And as far as using Duty Free which has been mentioned in this thread - that is also a heck of an option if you don't need the 1.75. They had a 1.14 of Bombay Sapphire (a very good gin) for $17 and you wouldn't have to pay duty."
2082417,Mohleye,2013-09-04 13:50:00,368,Just a clarification.....buying something at a duty-free store does not mean you don't have to pay duty. Same regulations apply. Never did understand why they call it Duty Free.
2082441,lawson2343,2013-09-04 14:04:00,459,"""Merchandise sold in duty-free shops are free of duty and taxes only for the country in which that shop is located."" The key words above are ""only for the country in which that shop is located"". In my example for Bombay Gin 1.14 liter for $17, no US taxes are withheld when purchased in the duty free shop. If I tried to buy that same bottle in a liquor store in Minnesota, I'd be lucky to get a 1 liter for anything less than $22. So in the case of crossing into Canada, anything more than 1.14 liters for alcohol will be charged duty by Canada. Hope this helps!"
2082529,Guest,2013-09-04 14:30:00,0,crossed two weeks ago with 6 cases of beer 2 liters rum 3 liters whiskey 3 guys Duty $109.00 didn't ask how they arrived at that figure. I guess they used the prices at the duty free store where they assumed we bought it
2046401,tv4fish,2013-08-21 13:24:00,2694,"Well, I am surprised and shocked at that. How did they come up with the figure of $265? (And, I have to say it - I think some agent must have had a bad day)."
2046729,srk-low,2013-08-21 15:03:00,78,"When put in a secure room outside of my own country I am more than happy to cooperate, answer their questions,and pay the fine without questioning. Even with the hour and half of my time I still consider it a pleasure to be allowed the opportunity to enjoy Lake of the Woods. After all it was my mistake"
2049394,lawson2343,2013-08-22 12:06:00,459,"Thanks to the person that posted the calculator link. I'm crossing with my wife for Labor Day weekend and we're each bringing a 1.75 liter. I'm curious, since we're over by 20 oz each, (sixty - forty), do they prorate that? I ran it for the cost of the whiskey and a full 1.75 was around $27 for the duty. Hardly worth taking across the big bottle for that. But if they prorate it, then it is definitely worth it."
2050706,Skywagon,2013-08-22 18:57:00,1106,"From what I have seen on hard liquor, you might as well buy it in Canada, the duty is just too high. Had friends bring me some items up this summer, they did not declare them, were searched, fessed up when questioned about snow shoes, and ended up paying 25% duty rather then the normal amount (in the end I paid it). Just not worth the possible extra cost and getting hassled every time you cross the border from then on."
2056634,walleyeduran,2013-08-25 13:40:00,286,"Tylumps, 3 (30) packs is 3.75 cases not 2.5. Your math teacher would not be impressed."
2056642,Tylumps,2013-08-25 13:48:00,73,I stand corrected. Said 3 (30 packs) in my example and did the math on two. Thanks for the heads up.
2056674,Tylumps,2013-08-25 14:00:00,73,Hey LawsonLeave the large bottles at home and buy some 1.14 L bottles at the duty free. You are allowed a bottle each. No duty and the pricing at the duty shop is terrific.
2057986,Shellback,2013-08-26 07:18:00,8083,"I'm crossing over on I-81, NY to ON. I've had a 30 pack of beer sitting in my basement for a month, I'd like to bring that, and another 24 pack. It will be the wife and I, so I assume we will be three 12oz cans of beer over per person. I intend to tell them that at the border. What are the chances they will make me pull over and pay a duty? Really don't want to be troubled by that. It's not that I want to bring an extra 6 cans, it's just that I'm going to have to open a case remove 6 cans and then try to tape it shut again. Just a PIA for 6 cans. We brought 2 cases up in May, and I left 34 cans with my Canadian neighbors. So it's not like I need the extra 6 beers!"
2058090,tv4fish,2013-08-26 08:03:00,2694,"I would say that is going to depend on the agent and what ""mood"" they are in the day that you cross."
2078314,danforth,2013-09-03 01:16:00,117,"Duty is based on the alcohol content of the item you buy/take across, hard liquor is more per liter than the same amount of beer due to the alcohol content. The mood of the officer only dictates if you go in and pay, The amount you pay is determined and set by the goverment."
2039937,LOW1,2013-08-19 09:28:00,2828,Yes to the fine.And the search could be a real inconvenience.And they could confiscate your booze.And you will be on a list which could make future visits interesting as well.
2039961,Carnhzkr,2013-08-19 09:33:00,964,"Thanks for the warning, 46Harley and LOW1. From now on, I'll declare exactly what I've got and pay the duty."
2041305,bluegussler,2013-08-19 18:40:00,124,try this for calculatinghttp://www.canadiandutycalculator.ca
2041433,Glenman12,2013-08-19 19:46:00,762,"with our group of 8 we each kick in $200 into a kitty and one guy controls it..this money covers all gas, meals and duty on the way up and back..yeah, one vehicles duty may be more than the others but nobody cares.."
2041489,jignminow,2013-08-19 20:29:00,168,it absolutely has to do with the value......a couple of years ago me and my fishing partner each bought a bottle at the border plus we each brought a 1.75 bottle. Mine was Crown and his was Absolut...we ended up paying about $70 in duty....I just looked at the duty calculator and it matches. It says for a $36 bottle of crown in 1.75 size the duty is $40........that would be more expensive than just buying it at the LCBO.....
2041585,cuamb,2013-08-19 21:07:00,203,A had friend get caught with an extra case. They pulled him and questioned him for 45 minutes. Made him pay the duty and was told he would get searched every time he came back into Canada. No additional fine. He has not gone back so I don't know if they would really search him. Really not worth the 6 to 10 dollars you save in my opinion. We always declare and it only takes a few extra minutes to go in and pay.
2041874,Paul H,2013-08-20 06:26:00,1232,Cute - there's an App for that.
2041962,tv4fish,2013-08-20 06:54:00,2694,It certainly does -- the best thing to do is have your sales receipt to show the customs people when you go inside the building.
2044697,Lazy Fisherman,2013-08-21 05:53:00,276,Agree with tv4fish. It does have to do with the value.
2046257,srk-low,2013-08-21 12:46:00,78,Cost of the beer is relevant when figuring duty I have been crossing At Ifalls/Ft Francis for thirty years I always have a sheet showing exactly the amounts of beer and hard liquor this sheet is provided to the border agent who then stamps it and we take it inside to pay I strongly suggest being truthfull with the quantity I always was except 2010 when we picked up some wine during our travels I failed to tell them and was unfortunately checked They seized my boat and the overage of alcohol Cost me 265 to get the boat back lesson learned
2039313,Jarbear,2013-08-19 07:05:00,24,"Just wondering how you pay the duty on the extra alcohol that is brought across into Canada. We like to bring our own since we never seem to be around a beer store when they are open while en route to the camp. My question is that some guys like more expensive beer and booze, while some like their classic light beers and don't drink booze. In the past we just told the agent of the value of the beer and booze, and went in and paid the duty at the border. We all just split the cost of the duty. Problem is that the more expensive beer the booze, the more duty you pay. Just wondering if you can claim the value of the extra beer and booze being brought in, and can each guy just pay the duty on the extra they are bringing in? Or would this just aggravate the border agents. Hopes this makes sense."
2039329,WowMarie,2013-08-19 07:08:00,19,You only pay per case or liter...not on the value...we just declare it all and 1 person goes in and pays the duty!
2039353,Hawkfan,2013-08-19 07:23:00,237,"Cost must have something to do with it because they ask how much you paid per case of beer. I don't remember ever being asked about the liquor, but get asked the cost of the beer every year."
2039449,Mohleye,2013-08-19 07:43:00,368,"I've never done it, we just buy in Canada, but from past posts I do believe it has something to do with the cost. I would pay it lump sum, and if you want to split it up on whatever basis among your group, do that in camp or sometime later. I wouldn't want to waste that much time at the border."
2039545,SinOrSwim,2013-08-19 08:10:00,1528,"We have never figured it out either but we think it does have something to do with cost on the beer anyway? But, I think the more expensive the beer the less the duty. I'm not sure if that is correct but that is what we think they do. Also, never been asked about cost of booze. So a liter of cheap vodka is the same as expensive vodka. We put all the beer and booze in one area before we leave. All booze goes in totes etc. We do an inventory so we know exactly how much of everythign we have. We all put money into a kitty and the duty gets paid from teh kitty. Now, if we have someone that doesn't drink and we all put in $300 into the kitty, then they can put in like $260 or $280. So, they are paying less based on the fact they aren't taking as much across.However, I don't think based on just the cost of the product you are going to see a huge difference on the duty. I'd split the cost and move on your way. Just my opinion."
2039609,Phil T,2013-08-19 08:24:00,4820,"Haul beer to Canada?? They have lots of it. And most of it tastes good. Isn't that like carrying coal to Newcastle? Or hauling fish filets to a good lake? Don't you remember ""The Great White North"" you hosers?"
2039625,Carnhzkr,2013-08-19 08:28:00,964,"Anyone know how much the duty on a litre of booze or case of beer is? I'm usually a little over my legal limit of 24 cans OR 1 litre, but I always just tell the border agent I have 24 cans and I've never been checked further. At the Duty Free, they've told me it's ""a couple bucks per bottle"", but I've never had to find out first hand."
2039689,Tylumps,2013-08-19 08:36:00,73,"Buy your beer in the United States and pay the duty at the border. This is way cheaper.Regarding how the duty works, here is what you need to do.1. Keep your beer receipts handy just in case they stop you and the cashier wants to see the receipts.2. When being questioned at the border and the border agent asks you what you are bringing, just tell the agent the amount of 24 can cases you have. Don't mess up and call a 30 pack a case because a border agent or cashier may get snippy if they do ask you to pull over and pay duty at the cashier and they see that you used 30 packs as cases.Simply do the math before hand, example would be, 3 (30 Packs) would be 3.75 cases of beer. Simply say you have 3.75 cases of beer. If you have a mixture of 24 packs and 30 packs just do the math and say the 24 pack equivalent of everything. The Border agents are in a hurry and going into 30 pack and 24 pack conversations almost always gets you pulled over.3. Its a 50/50 chance that you will be asked to pull over and pay duty. No big deal if you do, the border agent will write on a small piece of paper what you claimed over the per person limit, 4.5 cases of beer as an example and you take that sheet of paper inside to the cashier. I would have an average cost of a beer case in mind because the cashier may simply say what did your cases cost each and you can tell them $15 each and you might be on your way in a jiffy. Some cashiers want to do it by the book so that's when having the actual receipts comes in handy. Give the cashier the receipts and the cashier will do the math. It is usually $5-6 dollars a case for duty.You are allowed a 24 can/bottle case of beer per person or one 1.14 liter bottle of liquor. You pay the duty on the difference on how many adults in the car and what is allowed per person. If you are travelling with a group of cars, evenly distribute the drinks to help slipping through with minimal duty costs. If everybody is a little over the adult per car limit you may be allowed to just go on without stopping!! Bonus!!The easy answer to keep in mind here is buy your beer in the states and your booze at the duty free. You still may have to pay duty depending on your quantities and the border agents mood at the time but the tips I listed will keep your cost and headaches to a minimum.Take Care"
2039801,Carnhzkr,2013-08-19 09:05:00,964,"I wonder how big of a chance I'm taking when I fudge the facts and claim 24 cans when I know I'm also carrying an extra litre of Scotch? I'll bet I've driven across the border over 100 times (50 each direction) and I don't think I've ever been searched. I figure if I do get searched some day and they find the overage, I'll just pay the duty at that time. Everything else I have is legal. Would I be subject to a fine if I ""forgot"" about that litre I just bought?"
2039825,46Harley,2013-08-19 09:09:00,149,"The duty is a couple of bucks per bottle if you declare,but if you don't declare and get checked,the FINE will get your attention. One of the guys in our group paid 50 bucks.because they found a 9 dollar bottle of vodka.They checked us because when the border agent asked how large the bottle wasthat he did tell them about he said ""I don't remember"".The agent took a hard look at him and said ""pull over there"".We were there well over an hour as they went through EVERYTHING."
