If you have been there, how has the fishing been? We are looking at the last week in June 07 for a 4 - 5 day trip. We fish mainly Walleyes and some time is spent on Northerns. Are there any Musky, Lake Trout or Smallmouth Bass in any of the lakes that are accessable from the lodge. They are located on the Gullrock Chain of Lakes and the lodge is on Two Island Lake. Your comments would be appreciated."
564444,brant,2007-04-12 08:50:00,89,Last year we went to Gullrock. Stayed at Wright's Wilderness Camp. Great time and good fishing. Their camp seemed to be more centrally located and closer to good fishing areas. Young couple just purchased the camp a couple seasons ago and were excellent hosts.

Both were very nice camps and have probably been updated further since I was there. Walleye and northern fishing was very good. I'm not aware of smallies or muskies in this system. Lake trout are occasionally caught in Gull Rock in the early spring, but by June they will be back in Red Lake, as Gull Rock isn't deep enough. We did travel to Red Lake one afternoon and tried for lakers, but it was a lot of effort and used up a day that could have been better spent. Maybe ask your campowners about smallies and musky. These would not be camps I would choose if lake trout fishing is a big part of your trip."
564449,Guest,2007-04-12 12:31:00,0,"Well here's the scoop. I live on Gullrock and know each of these camps well. Procyks is a well maintained camp with good boats and motors. Similarly Wrights is of equal quality . Both camps have new owners in the past 2 years and both are young couples starting out in the tourism industry. No matter which one you choose you would not be disappointed. gullrock lake has great walleye fishing and if you know how and where to target northerns (since I don't target them I'm not in a position to advise on that) but I know that each year in the camps on gullrock northerns over 40"" are caught. this past winter my neighbour had an ice fishing derby for his friends next to my property and they caught a 42"" northern and a 24"" walleye through the ice. so big fish are out there. as for the walleye, it is not uncommon to catch 24""+ walleye. and all the eaters you want. The camps on gullrock have a policy that NO fish over 18 be brought back to camp for cleaning and eating. If you get a trophy it must remain whole and be used for mounting (at least until you get home, then who knows what you do with it) gullrock allows you to go into red lake by going up the river and red lake is also a world class fishery. It has Lake trout (but is catch and release only) walleye, northerns a few musky , whitefish, perch and bowfins. Book a trip to gullrock, you won't be sorry."
564450,Guest,2007-04-12 12:45:00,0,"Ron, If you search the archives for Gullrock Lake you should find more information that you care to have. :-) I've been going yearly to Gullrock since the early 80's. It is a lot of fun if you are into fishing walleyes and some nice northern. As mentioned previously the lake trout are found in Red Lake. If you pull your own boat there is a very nice public access in Balmertown. But I think the majority of the lake trout are caught in the western part of the lake. No muskie or smallmouth in the Gullrock chain of lakes, however I have fished for muskie in a couple of smaller lakes to the west of the town of Red Lake. Ask your camp owner about other lakes in the area and I am pretty sure they would be able to put you on water that contains muskies and smallmouth. Let us know how you do. Renn"
564457,the_bronco,2007-04-12 17:39:00,86,"Ron, From past experience you had better get reservations soon. Spots in these camps fill fast!I have been going to Gullrock for fifteen years and have stayed at three different camps. all of the camps on Gullrock are good, however it may be difficult to get a spot this late for June. It may come down to who has an opening. No muskie, smallmouth, or lakers but plenty of everything else. Good luck"
564466,Guest,2007-04-12 22:38:00,0,We have been going to South Bay on Gullrock and really enjoy the benefits......up on the bluff for no mosquitoes and nice bay to start from. Caters to RVs but has great cabins. We have never been disappointed staying there.
564472,sifty,2007-04-13 09:29:00,46,It's a great place. One nice thing is if a big wind kicks up on gullrock you can still fish on the smaller water were the resort is located. Nice cabins and a nice fish house. Big northerns and I'm talking 40 plus are caught from right in front of there resort. Would highly recommend the resort and for that matter 5-lakes is another great resort on gullrock.
564479,Guest,2007-04-13 15:05:00,0,"You'll enjoy the fishing on Gullrock. Just pick a camp you feel comfortable with, Have stayed at McEwans on Two Island ( Now Procyks) then gave Weavers Camp a try, but my old legs didn't care for the big hill. Now have been staying at Golden Hook Camp for the last 5 years, level ground & great new cottages. We fish the opener & enjoy catching those big northern. See you on the lake."
