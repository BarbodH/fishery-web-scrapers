Although we don't catch walleye on Versailles, one of the nearby lakes does have walleye. In the past we've had some luck trolling with a ""5 of Diamonds"" daredevil. We don't use any live bait so,was wondering if any one had some ideas for alternative lures. Thanks"

564519,Cameron Muir,2007-04-15 15:02:00,11,"Any colour 1/4 oz jig with any colour rubber tail, with minnow piggy-backed on. Cast out and jig back to vertical, keeping in touch with bottom. If you're getting too many pike, then go to plain lead-head jig (no tail) with minnow, staying vertical, on bottom or inch off. Women and children will often outfish men for walleye in Sask because they forget about their lines (hook laying on bottom; and no hook-set). Favourite jig colours = chartreuse; yellow; white/red; and plain lead. Crankbaits will catch walleye in Saskatchewan, but pike can do major damage to your $10 balsa Rapalas. -Cameron Muir"
