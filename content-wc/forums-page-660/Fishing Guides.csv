564642,Guest,2007-04-18 19:19:00,0,many of the resorts in Red Lake have a list of people that they would TRUST to take out their guests. On gullrock many of the camps call me to do a day guiding but I use the camp boat or the person requesting the guide's boat. I don't use mine since my insurance company specifically states the coverage is void if used for commercial purposes. Don't be afraid to ask the camp for someone to take you out. Your safety and a good stay in Canada and their camp is their primary concern and wouldn't risk either your life or their reputation by sending you with someone they aren't absolutely sure of.
564644,nuwav,2007-04-18 20:44:00,8,"You are correct. I understand to be properly ""legal"" you should have something i believe from Industry Canada and Transport Canada. (THE MNR is not even involed in this) It is just not the normal course for a boaters lic. but takes two days. It is simple too I believe. Then the issue of the insurance comes up which if I was starting in that business I would want a min of $2 million ""commercial Liability"" Naturally you pay taxes, Fed/Prov. and other pain in the butt Govt stuff. But the main thing here is then and only then can one call themselves a Professional Guide in my mind. I am in no way refering to guides who operate out of lodges or resorts. They are covered under the camps insurance policies, pay taxes, etc. etc.. and for the better part experienced on that particular body of water/area. To me IF I had gone thru all the hoops to get proper permits, licenses, and government requirements, I would be screaming blue murder on these ""out of their garage"" so called ""professional guides."" Just looking over those I find on the www and various ads here and their I lay odds are improperly covered on any of the above. Including a St. John's Ambulance Course or something as such, and once again I mention just because one might be a tourney winner does not make them a guide at all. In this day and age people have no hesitation to sue your butt off if they can. I'd much better be covered to the hilt, and IF I were hiring a guide, I would be asking questions. As to the Button they had years ago. That's gone. It stopped in the 70's I believe. Plus I am not even saying anything about a Guides Union. With the Out of their Garage folks it would never fly. Plus the camps as you say shiver on this idea. I only ask these questions because I am curious, but I'll only say if I was hiring a guide from a Hotel, motel or a local docking facility I want to see proper credentials. Resorts do not like private cabin owners renting their cabins, this is the same."

564652,nuwav,2007-04-19 04:48:00,8,"No..Not at all. Im not in a business. However. As I see this IF a person is going to invest in a good boat, motor and all the necessary equipment (a former lets say lodge guide with 20yrs himself on a lake.) and go into a business for himself with all the necessary bells and whistles and go private, why should HE have to contend with these out of their garage guides who do not pay taxes of ""any kind"" and just pocket the money. I am talking here of an investment of around $90,000+. Not small change. I personally have known guides who could not read/write a line of English never mind a map. (seriously) I also know of a resort here and their that has a problem year after year finding qualified guides and imports some from the North Shore in Labrador. How can they be called guides when they do not know where they are when they leave the docks? Sure, they follow someone for a bit, know how to cook shorelunch etc. etc. but hey. Think about that one. The person who is ""thinking"" of doing such has looked into this and is be told by Industry Canada, and other Government agencies that he has to have this n this, and that to get properly licensed for what he is planning. Not a small venture I might add. Then he looks around even more to find that no one (or at least very few) have any kind of permits at all. Not even a business license, GST, PST stuff included. If one person should be told to have permits to the hilt, then all should be in order to not only make it a level playing field, but a legitimate Industry. I do not care what guides who do it from Lodges and resorts do. It's the ones that work out of hotels, motels, and area docks, advert as Professional Guides and have only personal time fishing a body of water and as I say won tournaments. I admit some of them are very good sure, but none the less without a business license, proper insurance they are only out of their garage guides. To a certain extent really all guides should be licensed. I do not mean a union but licensed. Have first aid training of somekind and know how to read a map and not just follow a GPS or another guide. In reality when all this is finished if this person follows through with his idea he will be licensed well enough to Capt the Queen Mary. Now that's Professional"

Hey Bill: Bob Pieske here. I remember those buttons. I think the guides had an association in those days. They set out guidelines for rates, hours on the water, etc. They also had contests for biggest fish by species and kept score at Woodland Freezer in Nestor Falls. I know the Baronowski brothers were all members of it. Not all the guides were. Of course, those days a lot of the guides came from the reserve north of Nestor Falls. Part of the fun was taking a look at the tote board to see who was doing what. I loved driving through that open channel from Turtle to Whitefish. I wish it were still open. I'm too old to crank that 1900 Lund over the portage. Did it two years ago, but it about killed me. Thank God I weigh nearly 300 lbs. I could really get my body into it. One of these days we are going to have to sip a few and trade stories. I'm up there from mid May to mid Sept. Email me and I'll give you my phone number up there. Take care."

564617,nuwav,2007-04-17 17:57:00,8,Curious as to what the requirements might be? I assume a personal water craft lic. and for sure insurnace. But outside of that NO other regulations or permits required?
564625,Guest,2007-04-18 08:27:00,0,Unfortunately there are NO requirements.....a safe boating card OR insurance.
564632,nuwav,2007-04-18 15:04:00,8,"I find that very strange. I was talking to a few people who are thinking of starting a guide service in NW Ont. They mentioned something like that. However I figured at least the bare min. of a Boat Lic, ""Commercial Liability Insurance"" (note I say Commercial Liability) would have to be in place. I'd never consider guiding without somekind of coverage. Never know these days. People sue on a hang nail. Plus I know a few that should never drive a boat, never mind try guiding. Plus I am of the mind that just because someone gets lucky and wins a tourney now and then does not automatically qualify them as a professional guide. They should have at least a St. John Ambulance course under their belts."

564636,NWO Fishing Bum,2007-04-18 16:22:00,23,"A well-trained guide would be far better than a ""licensed guide"", who pays some fee and writes a test, in my opinion (just like a 14 year old, who has been driving trucks and quads in the bush or on the farm, are often better drivers than 16 year old city-nitwits who pass their written test and get a driver's licence). Guiding is both an art and a science. To do it well requires a suite of BOTH hard, technical skills (fishing skills, boat handling, navigation, operation of motors and boating accessories, cooking, etc.) and soft skills (communication, educating guests on proper presentation, natural heritage interpretation, respecting others on the water etc.). An employer seeking a guide will assess these skills, and/or the ability to develop such skills in said person. I don't see that much of a need for licensing, when acquiring such a license (in my opinion) would not equate to necessarily being a good, or even average, guide, and an employer (usually lodge owner or operator) would understand that. Which leads me to my main point, that the vast majority of guides are employed to work at a specific resort for the season. At times, guests show up to resorts and suddenly decide they want a guide, when a guide (at that resort) might not be available. In such circumstances, lodges usually have a list of local individuals who can fill-in. Other times, when resorts have guides as an option, scenarios develop where everybody in camp happens to want a guide on a given week. In these cases, lodge operators know this when the groups book, and they acquire guides accordingly (usually using that same list of people they know and trust). Having a regional ""guiding service"" I believe would serve a very small % of the market, those being people who are staying in a hotel and fishing out of Dryden or Kenora, and decide they wouldn't mind the services of a guide for a day or two, but they don't know where to find somebody reasonably reputable on short-notice. In that scenario, they could phone the ""guiding service"" to find out who might be available. Even in those scenarios (which are often a product of poor planning in the first place) they could probably just go ask at the local bait shop if they know of anybody. The guiding service thing has been talked about for years and years(we use to always joke with lodge owners that we were going to start a ""guide union""; it makes them shiver, LOL). Nothing large-scale has ever happened though, due to the reasons above, in conjunction with the remoteness of most fishing destinations in NWO. I mean, what would the ""guiding service"" reasonably entail? A list of guides with their addresses, so somebody phones the service rather than the guides themselves, and the ""service"" takes their cut of the $, which otherwise would have went to the guide. Although I've worked only on rare occasions as a 'freelance' guide (if you will), I wouldn't be seeking representation through some ""guide service"", and I've worked with many of the most outstanding guides you'll find in NWO, whom I'm fairly confident would say the same. There may however be others, who guide only periodically here and there, who might be looking for some way to get more work, without marketing their services, and without seeking employment at a specifec resort or resorts for the season. I suppose a guide like that (albeit relatively few exist) MAY benefit from a guide service. But again, I'll reiterate, that both the guides and visitors who could make use of such a service, would represent a very small proportion of the NWO fishing and nature-based tourism industry.

564641,Guest,2007-04-18 19:16:00,0,"Last year Mista W started a business called Red Lake Guiding Service. I'm not a licensed guide as per say but for legal reason I took on a business name. Now the MNR does not require a guiding business to have licensed guides but any money profitted by persons without a business license may be breaking tax laws. I only know of one (licensed guide) who took the ministry course, in this whole area. He lives on Lac Seul, good friend of mine. You'd be far to find too many licensed guides in our area but you'd definately find Professional ones... [email protected] ...Eat Fresh.... Mista W"
