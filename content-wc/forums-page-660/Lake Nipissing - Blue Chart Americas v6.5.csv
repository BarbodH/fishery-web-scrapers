Its new and unopened - unfortunately the owner can't answer my question and I can't find version ""v6.5"" at the Garmin website as Version 9 is the most recent. Version 9 has includes ""Region US017 - Lake Huron-Lake St. Clair"" that can be unlocked and if it has charts of detailed coverage of Lake Huron, Georgian Bay, Lake St. Clair, Lake Simcoe, Lac Nipissing, and the Detroit River. Does anyone know if version6.5 also includes Region US017 with Lake Nipissing? Thanks"

(at any rate, the right prompts will let you talk to a cust. service rep) Tell them what you have, or in your case, what you want to buy, and they will be able to answer all your questions. Good luck, Marv"

The item was on ebay over the weekend and Garmin was closed. Bought the blue chart anyway at a good price - just hope Nipissing is on it. I really enjoy going there."
