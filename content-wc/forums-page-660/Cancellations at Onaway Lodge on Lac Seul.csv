I know some of you have been asking for opinions on Lac Seul and in my opinion you can't beat Onaway. Great hosts with the best dock and fish house around. Great cabins with some brand new ones. My wife and I just cancelled a new 2 bedroom cabin, (sleeps 3-5) for the 1st week of June as the other couple we were to go with took a new job and moved across country. If you or anyone you know are looking to get up to Lac Seul this year give Onaway a call. My wife and I will be there that week but staying with my brother in law in another cabin and we will also return for the 1st week of July. I just got off the phone with the Host Blair Cambell and he also has a few other openings later on in the summer. I would be happy to share other info or questions about Onaway. Also anyone on Lac Seul during those 2 weeks look us up, I will be in a Tan and dark blue Tournament Pro Alumnacraft with a 115 Merc Optimax"
