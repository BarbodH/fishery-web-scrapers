564126,Guest,2007-03-26 19:47:00,0,I have the ok to replace the 1984 bottomline on my 18 foot lund tyee I fish walleye 90 percent of the time and 10 percent on lake michigan for salmon. I all ready have gps and am looking for a unit that shows what depth the fish are at as the old one does not. I see in cabelas there are some units which are 3D with a wide cone transduser or the plan 20 degree ones. What is your thoughts?

This unit has: High pixel count (640V x 320H) which relates to high definition---Has a depth capability of 1000 feet in 2D mode and 240 feet in 3D mode---Has 8000 Watts (Peak to Peak) and 1000 Watts (RMS)for 2D and uses much less in 3D mode---Has a 16 degree cone for 2D mode and a 60 degree cone for 3D mode---455 khz in 2D and 83 khz in 3D---Advertised to have a 2 1/2"" target separation---Has speed and temp included---Has a monochrome display. This unit has many good features. Someone else will need to post about the advantages or disadvantages of the 3D. If I were going to spend $500 for a unit, I might opt for a color unit like the Lowrance 510c @$499, or a Humminbird 777c2 @ $499, or a Garmin 340c @ $449."
