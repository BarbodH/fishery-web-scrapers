Can anyone tell me what they have found to be the best months for Walleyes and Northerns on the lake? i was hoping to be there in early June but am finding the only openings available may be around the June 30-July 7 range. I am just hoping to get some good advice. Also i'm wondering if anyone has found that one end of the lake is better than another, for example is fishing the northwest corner just a good, worse, better than say the southwest. Thanks in advance."

Weather is usually well stabilized and the fish are always hungry. I think all of the lake is good, some days you just have to poke around a little more than others to find the fish. With most of the camps going to bigger boats and 4 stroke motors the range of the fisherman has expanded considerably. I stay at the northwest end and 10 years ago you would seldom see camp boats beyond 5-10 miles from camp, now it's commonplace to see them 15-25 miles out. I guess what I'm saying is camp location isn't as critical as it once was. Where the amount of fuel you could carry used to be the limiting factor, today it's the price of the fuel. Just watch your depthfinder and map, they grow big rocks up there."

It's not always about the fishin. Meet a lot of great people who go back every year and the people in Ear Falls are great. Every day is a good day at Lac Seul.

Of course we have been stuck in a few storms in late June and it is not something to take lightly on the water. My master electrician brother thought it was cool when his graphite rod sizzled when he raised it to God in my boat. He was hugely scolded on our way to shore. 7"

I believe it sleeps 4. Nice new cabin. The couple that was to go with my wife and I moved and took a new job. Onaway is a great resort with great owners. I would check them out before the cabin is gone. They usually have a waiting list but it is worth a shot."

564495,Guest,2007-04-14 09:02:00,0,"We really have found that the month of July is normally very good. Around the 4th of July always seems to be good. You can catch fish June, July and August. But sometimes you have to move around and look for them. August always seems to be windy and once it starts it doesn't stop. If you go one place and don't catch anything in the first 15 minutes, move on."
