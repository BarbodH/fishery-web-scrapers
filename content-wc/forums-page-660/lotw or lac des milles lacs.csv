Nope. I'm talking anout Northerns we target. Just have never found any of size. Got any pointers? We stay at Grassy Narrows."
564424,PJM,2007-04-10 21:41:00,3516,"1shooter I have fished both lakes and have always caught fish. Walleye fishing in Lake of the Woods is better but I have learned how to fish the lake and every month is a little different. When I first started fishing the lake we went to Miles bay and now I fish more west becuase the fishing it better. As far as Pike, LDML is better. I have caught some nice pike on the big reef in the middle of Bolton bay in July. The pike lay of the edge of the deeper rock structure when the water get warm and you catch them on deep diving # 9 shad raps trolling. There is a small island in the middle of the bay, if you go past it there is like two large humps the it starts to get deeper and we pick up some nice ones there. It seemed like the pike bit between early to mid after noon then quit......"
564437,Guest,2007-04-11 18:07:00,0,"I have fished the area by Duck Bay and you should have good walleye, bass and smallmouth action. If you want muskies, you are not far from some good areas. Duck Bay has great accomidations and equipment. You would not be dissapointed if you went there. Wingmann"
564446,rpieske,2007-04-12 10:01:00,1276,"My best success is in early season when large Northerns are easier to find. As the season moves along, the northern will move deeper and only be found shallow under prime conditions. My favorite lures are soft plastics like 10"" Fin-S minnows, Storm soft plastics, large flukes, etc. But don't ignore bass size buzz baits in early season. I have had large northerns smash these buzz baits and flip in the air like tarpon when hitting them. A large jig with a soft plastic body worked deep on outside edges of weeds and deeper rocks will produce as the season moves on. If you find a sizable bay with thick, patchy deep weeds and a strong wind blowing directly into the shore on a grey, rainy day....look out. That can be a great day any time during the season. I also use small bucktails and spinnerbaits that can be worked high over the weeds dropping into pockets. A Buchertail Slopmaster works good in that environment also."
564459,TECK,2007-04-12 18:51:00,151,I fish both Lac Des Mille for eyes and LOTW for Muskie. The new 2007 Navionics Canada chip now has Lac Des Mille on it.
564464,Guest,2007-04-12 22:15:00,0,"I have been to about 8 or 9 different camps in Canada over 15 years and have been fishing out of Witch Bay camp on LOW for the last 6 years and in my opinion Witch Bay is about as good as it gets for the total package. The service is unbeatable. Gail and Steve Hockett are great people and they flat out know how to run a fishing camp. The employees are very well trained and they have hired fishing pros in camp all summer who are there to help you catch fish.You can take your own boat or rent one of their boats. They have 50 hp 4 strokes on 17 ft boats with trolling motors and electronics etc. Witch Bay and Andrew Bay are some of the best fishing on the entire lake and you don't have to venture far from the camp to catch fish. There are a lot of bays and islands in that area so you can get out of the wind if need be. We have had outstanding walleye fishing there since we started going there both in size and numbers. My first to trip to Witch Bay produced a 30"" walleye and 37"" Northern and 21"" smallmouth. There is no slot limit. They encourage catch and release of trophy fish of course. I'll let you in on a little secret about LOW. June is not the best month to walleye fish it. In late June the walleye go into their summer pattern and get on the mid lake humps and stay there until fall. We catch fish in the same spots day after day, year after year.The lake is full of this type of structure. The weather in July is a lot more stable as well. Witch Bay is up Hwy 71 near Kenora. I promise if you give it a try you won't be disappointed."
564492,1shooter,2007-04-14 07:44:00,1493,All my trips have been in June with the exception of 1 where we went in July. It was 2 years ago and that was the year it was in the upper 90's everyday with minimal wind.
564385,Guest,2007-04-09 12:20:00,0,"just curious if anyone has fished both of these lakes and may have an opinion on where you would go. i know ldmlacs has only walleye and northern, but i heard they enforced a slot limit and the fishing can be very good to excellent. heard same about lake of the woods. cosidering pine point or maki bay resort on lac des milles lacs, and duck bay resort on lotw. will be fishing early june, and only interested in fishing report,as duck bay has them beat as far as ammenities go.any spots near these camps as well as preferred lures will be appreciated"
564388,NWO Fishing Bum,2007-04-09 13:59:00,23,"LOTW would be my vote. Lac Des Mille Lacs gets hit hard by the Thunder Bay fishing community. LOTW gets lots of pressure too, but there is more water out there, as well as more diversity, as you mentioned. The fishing on LDML is decent, but inferior to many of the fisheries further northwest, including LOTW. LOTW is much more ""touristy"" (I don't think that's a word), and more modern. LDML has been the go-to inland fishery for the Thunder Bay community for decades, and the lodges and most amenities there are well-established (i.e., older). OMNR is currently completing a new strategic plan for management of LDML. Most of the walleyes you will catch in LDML are small (12-20""), and most of the pike you'll catch are what are commonly referred to as 'snakes', about 22""-28"". I think your chance at a trophy is much greater on LOTW, and as you mentioned, the amenities when you get off the water would be better at LOTW, though I don't know of the specific resort you're mentioning. NWO Fishing Bum"
564395,Guest,2007-04-09 18:31:00,0,"i wouldnt be wrong going to ldml as we would catch fish, correct? as you post many times on this board, your opinion is greatly respected, and i may heed your words, but if you had to fish ldml for a week, youd be up for that and have a good time, correct?? have you ever fished it and if so where? and the same for lotw and duck bay area as well.. look forward to your response.."
564396,JDP,2007-04-09 18:49:00,1457,"Unsure1, I have fished both lakes and NWO F.B. hit the nail on the head. LDML is a beautiful but smaller lake with on the average smaller walleye and northern pike than LOW. There are better accomodations available on LOW as well. Yes you can have an enjoyable time on LDML! JDP :cheers:"
564399,esgrams,2007-04-09 22:12:00,92,"We fish around Duck Bay in early June, try the North and East side of Hay Island pulling spinners and on the south side jigging the subtle humps out in the deeper water,, dependng on where there staging this year.. Many spots in that area,, have a good trip.."
564402,1shooter,2007-04-10 06:03:00,1493,Not sure about the walleyes but we have only caught snakes on LOTW. Great for walleyes but have never really found Northerns of any size. We fish the miles bay area.
564404,PJM,2007-04-10 07:01:00,3516,1shooter Try going into the Obabikon lake if you are looking for nice pike
564405,Planocat,2007-04-10 07:58:00,473,"NWO Fishing Bum has given as honest an evaluation of these two lakes as you will find. I've fished both. My choice would be LOTW..... I don't think it gets any better than that. Have never found a 1st class RV campground on the lake with full amenities or LOTW would be our choice for at least part of the annual trip. We fish LDML for 3 weeks every June/July and have for 17 years. I wouldn't classify the fishing as outstanding.... things can be a bit tough in transition periods (which we usually manage to hit). But the smallmouth population is increasing and the slot has improved the quality of the walleyes (28 1/2 the largest to date) and northerns. We have always stayed at Pine Point and the facilities (much different than we first started staying there) and staff make it a very enjoyable trip which we look forward to as the highlight of our year. I'd say that the RV facilities, the people, and knowing our way around a few parts of the lake keep us coming back more than the fishing quality. Anyway, hope you have a great time no matter which you choose. Planocat"
564407,1shooter,2007-04-10 08:54:00,1493,"PJM, We have fished Obabikon but nothing of any size however we catch lots of them. I would guess they average around 20""-24"". I also have fished both lakes and would choose LOTW over LDML"

Are you talking about Northerns you catch while walleye fishing or Northerns you target? That too makes a difference. It is the rare summer that I don't catch many Northerns from 15-20 lbs."
