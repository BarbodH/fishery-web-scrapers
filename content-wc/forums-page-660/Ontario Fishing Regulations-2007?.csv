This includes managing fisheries on a zone basis rather than on an individual lake basis and replacing 37 fishing divisions with 20 fisheries management zones. To come into effect, these regulations must be approved by the federal government. The Ministry of Natural Resources and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans have been working closely to complete the approval process. Anglers should continue to use the 2005-2006 regulations and current Ontario Recreational Fishing Regulations Summary throughout 2007, with the exception of the following changes that took effect January 1, 2007: The walleye season is open year-round on all of Lake Erie. The catch and possession limit for walleye in the eastern basin of Lake Erie has increased to six fish from four. On Lake Nipissing, the winter season for walleye and some other species has been extended by one week. This change, along with a longer fall season applies to the entire lake including the West Arm. There have also been some changes to walleye and pike catch limits in the West Arm to be consistent with the rest of Lake Nipissing. On Golden Lake, the walleye fishery is re-opening after being closed for five years. There will be a 50 cm minimum size limit, and a catch and possession limit of two walleye (under a sport fishing licence) and one walleye (under a conservation fishing licence). The province has extended the bass season across the province by moving the opening day from the last Saturday in June to the fourth Saturday in June. The 2005-2006 regulations and current fishing summary are available at ServiceOntario/Government Information Centres outlets and from most licence issuers as well as on the ministry's website at ontario.ca/mnr/. The updated fishing summary should be released later this year. To fish, Ontario residents must have a valid Outdoors Card and fishing licence. Non-residents must have a valid fishing licence before they may fish in Ontario waters. NWO Fishing Bum"
