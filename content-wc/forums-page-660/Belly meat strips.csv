564602,Cameron Muir,2007-04-17 11:32:00,11,Fish parts are ok in Saskatchewan. We used to use belly meat or walleye cheeks when the perch would steal all our minnows.
564609,Springseeker,2007-04-17 14:05:00,96,"You can get sportfishing regs on line for any province. Just Google ""Province""-Sportfishing Regulations. Bait can usually be used in some areas and not in others of each province."
564614,Bill Krejca,2007-04-17 15:20:00,6107,"If you are using suckers, most of the fish can be used, just fillet it and use anything that will stay on the hook. Strips can be used for dead baiting or on a jig, the oddball parts work fine for dead baiting, as long as the hook isn't completely covered, have to leave the point(s) exposed somewhat to set the hook. Usually works best if the large bones aren't in the meat, tho."
564618,Guest,2007-04-17 19:10:00,0,belly meat baits are not legal in Quebec
564523,Pooch,2007-04-15 17:41:00,4619,I've been reading Dan Gapen's books and when fishing for lake trout he mentioned using a strip of belly meat on his jig. These books were written quite a while back and I was wondering if that is legal anymore? It makes a lot of sense since when cleaning smaller walleye the meat under the ribs can be missed with the fillet knife when not on a fairly level surface. Pooch
564524,rpieske,2007-04-15 17:48:00,1276,"Bringing back memories.... We actually used to do that before all the nice soft plastic trailers became available. The belly skin strip was bright white, flexible and had smell and taste. Did we catch any more fish when we used it? Couldn't prove it by me. Some days white jigs, some days orange, some days blue, etc. Same way with belly meat. Just another ""extra"" that sometimes worked. Haven't done it in decades."
564525,2746,2007-04-15 18:20:00,3206,Not sure if it's leagal everywhere..... Maybe someone else know for sure.
564527,phishfearme,2007-04-15 20:19:00,1242,"in ontario, it's illegal to use any part of a game fish for bait. phish"
564528,manitobawalleye,2007-04-15 21:10:00,885,"legal in manitoba belly strips for lake trout is still used manitoba .... a 100,000 lakes how many walleyes ???? i will never have enough time...."
564541,Bill Krejca,2007-04-16 07:21:00,6107,"Used to use belly meat and throat strips for walleye in Sask., don't know if still legal there, but it worked very good. A wad of it on a catfish type rig also worked well for dead baiting for trout, even on a non-walleye lake. I believe it is still legal in Manitoba, but I personally never found it to be as good a producer as in Sask, don't know why. The Manitoba rule book says (said?) that fish scraps (offal) produced as a result of the cleaning process could be used for bait, meaning about anything could be used. Now illegal in Ontario, a favorite for me on LOW used to be a strip of perch belly. Until some years ago, this was legal - according to a warden I asked, but now is not. It is pretty hard to figure out the reasoning behind these changes/inconsistencies from one province to the next, but some of the powers that be must have decided that fish meat is just too successful a weapon!!!"
564542,Guest,2007-04-16 07:29:00,0,It's sucker belly what they use for lakers. And you can use it in Ontario. We've taken some of our biggest lakers on our tip ups with a big hunk of sucker.
564545,phishfearme,2007-04-16 09:27:00,1242,bill - i asked that same question to an MNR officer years ago - since we used post-fillet belly meat alot - and his answer was simple: How do i know that you didn't simply kill a fish for it's belly meat? kinda hard to believe somebody would do this - until i saw it happen. can't blame the MNR for coming up with this law. phish
