They advertise walleyes, northerns, Lake Trout and Muskies. How are the Lake Trout? Are they easy to find or few and far behind? Is the lake good for Muskies? Any comments regarding the fishing or the lodge would be appreciated."

Can't stand spinner fishing and just fished Jig and crawlers and leeches, Off Island points and drop offs and the three of us would catch between 50-100 fish between meals. I doubt the owners are the same now they we elderly back then. George and can't remember wifes name. Cabins were nice and meals were good. Fished mostly on lake where lodge was clear to the upper end there is a small stream that comes in on I believe east side of lake does not look like much but we nailed BIG fish there. Lake Trout fishing was good we were there in July and had to go out to big lake and use depth finder to find them in 70 ft or so and used big Sonars (Cicadas) Never caught anything over 15 lbs though. Never tried for Muskies and Pike fishing was crappy I thought. Lots of little stuff one nice 39 incher on jig and worm Good Luck and hope you have a great time."
