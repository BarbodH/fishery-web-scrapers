564224,Guest,2007-04-01 19:20:00,0,"You will be going up just after ice out by a few weeks so water might be still cool - may can be great or rough depending on the weather- prepare for rapid changes - fish the nothern part of the bays as that is where the warmer water will be- air melancon is a good outfitter and has nice camps and will give lots of help in locating fish- pike will be in shallow bays and as the sun warms the bay more and more will move in- spoons and shallow running spinners and plugs should be the ticket just off the openings and along early weeds-be sure to attach a 3-5in. white trailer to the spoons when casting- seems to work better walleyes should be shallow also just off spawining- fish the first drops and rock shoals- as with most walleyes jigs with a 3"" curl tail tipped with a piece of crawler are the standard fare with yellow and white being the standard colors of choice. but if they are shallow casting rapalas or #5 mepps red and white spinner might be a steady producer last but not least - be prepared to handle the bugs- if nothing else late may to early june is prime time for skeeters- should not be a problem on the water but around camp can be a challenge- here is what we do - when we close the cabin at night we spray the entire cabin inside with Raid flying insect spray which kills all bugs and we can sleep - we use a bucket for night urinal to keep the door closed and not have bugs come in- sounds abit crude but has worked well for many restful nights hope this helps and have a good trip- where are you flying from? good luck"

I think white jigs Gulp and power bait was the best for us, but chartruese worked too. You might have to move alot to find the best schools. Caught some in the middle of the day trolling big lures in the dropoffs on some flats. Very surprising, you should try it. Pike were very shallow, couldn't run the motor into the woody bays, but they were there in mid June. They will probably still be staging out somewhere"

564537,McQ,2007-04-16 05:02:00,615,"Hey Phish - I'm still around. The last couple of years have been a challenge, dealing with health issues and attendant problems that complicated most of the things I was doing. I recently accepted the responsibilty of setting a course for a tackle company that manufactures some pretty exciting jig products and that has taken quite a bit of time to get rolling too. Fortunately the Reservoir is still there and it's still a fish factory. Other areas around the Province of Quebec have been visited and as I get more time reports will be forthcoming. I can be reached at (mcqon[email protected]) or PM if anyone needs info in the near term. Bill"
564538,phishfearme,2007-04-16 05:57:00,1242,"McQ - welcome back!! i did a search on your handle and your last post was july 2004. looking forward to your continued feedback on the gouin res and surrounding area. do you know what's up with alsis? thanks, phish"
