564497,Guest,2007-04-14 09:25:00,0,I've already started packing for June.
564500,Guest,2007-04-14 11:06:00,0,We leave our box half packed from year to year. Salt pepper roll of bumwad and the other items we did not use. Makes it easy fom year to year.
564505,Guest,2007-04-14 19:54:00,0,part of the fun is making the list. Doesn't matter whats on it or whether it is right. Example last year on a trip I didn't plan we had 1 pound of butter for 12 guys for 1 week. We lived without butter for that time and had a great time. I start my list in january and revise it multiple times. Gives me something to do. Yeh I know I need a life but my 2 or 3 weeks in canada are worth going to work for. By the way I just packed my clothes today for my may 28 departure to the manitou. eric
564598,Grappler,2007-04-17 10:26:00,47,"We have an Excel list on the computer with all of our info. Budget, with estimated expenses for this year, expenses for last year. List of trucks and boats going, grocery list, alcohol and tobacco list, boat rotation (who is fishing with whom) and of course cabin duty list, and supply list. It is kinda O/C and AR, but we don't forget anything and everyone knows what to expect. We also have at least one meeting to go over everything in late winter."
564448,Guest,2007-04-12 12:26:00,0,"After several years of going to Canada and packing on a hit or miss basis, I decided to develop a small booklet with a number of check lists, pictures of good knots, lake maps, menus and grocery lists, and other helpful information that I could use to plan next year's trip. I was wondering if some of the rest of you do this, and what you include in yours? and if you would be willing to share yours?"
564451,rockpt,2007-04-12 12:59:00,589,"We do something like that. We have a master packing list. And my wife keeps a written journal during our trip. Things like what the weather was, where we fished, what we caught, unusual or funny events, who else is in camp, etc. I also keep a video journal. Tape a few times a day from the boat or cabin. After 20 trips to LOTW, we have a few hundred pages of written journal and almost 40 hours of tape. She usually reads one or two prior trips from the journal each night of the trip. Fun to sit around the cabin with a scotch or beer and listen to what happened three years ago. We watch the tapes during the weeks leading up to our summer and fall trips. Entertaining and they help get us fired up for the trip. Also, good reminders on what worked on past trips, what didn't, what we promised to do next year, etc."
564454,Jimmy Jig,2007-04-12 14:53:00,1905,"We have several lists, Clothing, Food, Fishing/Boat Equipment, all on the computor now. We also have a small note book for each years trip to L.S. time we leave, where we stop for lunch, etc. Where we fish each day, what we caught, water temp, weather, etc. After we get home I summarize the expenses on the last page. I know the price of gas, food, motel, cabin for about the last 12 years. Try it...."
564455,Guest,2007-04-12 16:42:00,0,"We use a basic list for personal items that must not be forgotten such as sleeping bag,bug dope,fishing rods,etc.When it comes to socks and underwear,it's up to each individual to decide what his needs are. Our food list is based on a meal planner that we have used for years. When the trip is over and we are making the long drive home we reveiw our food list,how much bait we used,and misc.items. We make any nessesary changes to these lists as needed at this time and not rely on our memory eleven months later. As a rule,it's always better to run a little bit long on food than to be a little short. What ever food is left over is ate up at a reststop on the way home. Even though we stay at a resort cabin or outpost that has a kitchen stocked with cooking utensils,we always bring our own.In the past,every kitchen has been missing some important utensil that you need like a can opener or it's so wore out it doesn't work."
564467,Guest,2007-04-12 23:39:00,0,"When we first started going to Canada we forgot alot of stuff,so we started making lists and haveing several ""canada meetings"" so we would'nt forget anything.But now it's same thing every year,same food,same guy's ,same gazillion walleye's, same bugs, same fantastic sunsets,same stupid jokes,same beer,we even sit at same place at the dinner table every year,so it's easy for us.And if we do forget something we just pull out the plastic and buy it, in our advanced age it's not worth fussing about,just enjoy another week in paradice. Terry"
564468,lassh,2007-04-13 05:41:00,553,"I do have a checklist used for fly-ins. Its used to ensure that I bring the right stuff and not too much. In addition, I will weigh the gear at home prior to departure. The list has tackle, clothing, personal items. It also has a list of ""communal"" items so that we don't have unnecessary duplicates brought by each person on the trip. We have one person responsible for the food. One of the members of our group also keeps an entertaining journal of the trip that he distributes to the group. It includes conditions, a fishing report, biggest fish of week, laughable events of the week and wildlife observed during the trip. This expands the entertainment window from the trip well beyond the week that we are there."
564470,MN_Moose,2007-04-13 07:19:00,965,"I have a master list of things to bring along, clothes and bathroom stuff. A list of the boat items. We also started keeping a renewed grocery list. I don't do the grocery shopping so the guys that do appreciate having a guide to what was purchased previous year, the number of people and what we were short or long of. Sure, I'll share the list but, I've been ridiculed on here for having too long of a list."
564474,Guest,2007-04-13 10:41:00,0,"I've never have a list, seems like a lot of work to me. I just crack another beer and fish on."
564478,Guest,2007-04-13 13:20:00,0,"He who fails to plan, plans to fail. I know it's not for everyone, but it helps me keep my sanity."
564491,Guest,2007-04-14 07:09:00,0,"'He who fails to plan, plans to fail. I know it's not for everyone, but it helps me keep my sanity."" Im that way too..I make the grocery list and adjust it every year..its not too bad as we get dinner every day so Im just buying for breakfast and lunch..everyone else is responsible for their own ""things to bring list""..I bring mine out the night before we leave and check things off as I pack them in the SUV"
