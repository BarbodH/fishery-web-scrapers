564379,Hammer_74,2007-04-09 00:25:00,18,"I was looking at the Navionics software but it isn't compatible with garmin. Does anyone know of an equivalent software that is downloadable to a garmin 76s gps and would contain the Lac seul information? Garmins recreational lakes and hotspots only covers LOTW, eagle lake and Rainy lake in the areas i fish. I'm not necessarily looking for marked fishing spots but more the bottom structure, sunken islands, rocks, humps,depth contours etc...Any direction would be appreciated."
564390,Guest,2007-04-09 14:42:00,0,"Hammer: posted same question about 3 months ago and no luck. Did my own research and found trak maps out of St Donat, Quebec offered a map of Lac Seul that you could download on to garmins Mapsource, the cost was 59.00 plus shipping. Have downloaded to Mapsource, but not yet on GPS. Will have no idea of the accuracy until after June 9th. Hope this helps, only place I could find."
564400,Hammer_74,2007-04-09 22:26:00,18,"Thanks for your reply Dk. I did some research myself after posting and that was all I could come up with as well. I was wondering how it looks on mapsource? Does it show islands? I know the enhanced basemap doesn't. What about navigational information, is there any?Does it cover the whole lake? I found the website to be vague as to what kind of information this map holds. Was there any fishing points on it as well? Please let me know how it looks compared to the other mapsource detail. Thank you again Dk and looking foreward to hearing from you. Do you fish Lac Seul every year? I used to go every other weekend for 3-4 years when i used to live in Dryden. Now i go once or twice a year if i'm lucky. Incredible fishery"
564410,Guest,2007-04-10 13:29:00,0,"Hammer: It has depth interval lines at 10', highlighted with different shades of blue, navigational bouys are shown as well as a recommended navigation line. Rocks and Islands are marked, but no fishing spots. The map does cover the entire lake.This is my first time to Lac Seul and first time with this software, so the jury is still out. I have fishing hot spots on mapsource and this map does not have near the detail. From what I have read there is not alot of detail available for Lac Seul from anybody. Trak seems to be a reputable outfit and I'm sure the map will be better then nothing. Good Luck! DK.... Lac Seul June 9th to 16th"
564413,Hammer_74,2007-04-10 14:03:00,18,Thanks Dk. I was hoping it was going to be as comprehensive as hotspots but like you said anything is better than nothing.
564443,Guest,2007-04-12 07:28:00,0,Does anyone out there have this software that they have actually used on Lac Seul????
564458,Hammer_74,2007-04-12 18:44:00,18,"Its on order. You will be there before me, let me know how accurate it is if you remember. Doesn't seem like anyone else has it."
564462,Guest,2007-04-12 21:15:00,0,"DK I am sure you aware of this, but since you mentioned that this will be your first trip to LS, I thought it would be good to mention. The water level of LS can flucutate a lot. A couple of years ago it was down at least six feet over the previous year when we were up (early June both years). The following year it was back to normal pool level. However that one year we saw rocks above the water we never knew were there (or how close we were to them at normal level). I raise this because there has been some talk on this board previously that LS might be down in water level this spring and as such, you would want to keep that in mind when thinking of fishing and running the boat. A route that looks plenty deep to run at full throttle on your GPS might not be so good if the water level is down. In your searchs of LS on this board you might have noticed lots of folks mention losing a lower unit to the Rock Gods that inhabit the lake. Finally, also note that LS has lots of open water and when the wind is humming in the right directions it will produce some pretty nasty waves. Be safe. Sorry no experience with software. Enjoy your trip...IA Walleye"
564463,Hammer_74,2007-04-12 22:05:00,18,IA Walleye Has some extemely valid points which i never thought to mention. Thank you IA walleye for the heads up
564477,Guest,2007-04-13 13:09:00,0,"Thanks guys, but will never depend strickly on a gps for navigating rocks, seen too many guys get in trouble looking at the gps instead of where they are going. If you have ever been to Lake St Joe, you know it is rock city. One year MNR doing a sting operation on booze in boat, lost 3 lower units in a week and had to leave, water was down 3 feet from the year before.We will have a guide on Lac Seul the first couple days, learn a little about the lake and learn safe navigation on the main body. I would much rather go to a new lake for the first time with the water being down then up, we won't know that rock was not supposed to be there. I'd hate to loose the lower unit on my brand new etec. Thanks guys..DK"
