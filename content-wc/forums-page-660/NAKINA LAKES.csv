564512,Guest,2007-04-15 09:57:00,0,"Dave, How is Makoki for walleye?"
564543,Guest,2007-04-16 07:57:00,0,"We fished Makoki a few years ago. Caught walleye off island points and in mouth of incoming streams. Size varied but most in the 1.5 to 3 pound range. Lake is small. Great size for 4 or less fisherman. Caught pike over 17 pounds in reeds and weeds. Can furnish map if you want. Have you fished the Nakina area before? If so who did you go in with? We have used AWO 10 times (outfitteer on Makoki, with number 11 coming this June. Anything else, just ask.:smash:"
564555,Guest,2007-04-16 16:22:00,0,Used to fish the Nakina area when Don and Millie still had their camps (Nakina Air). My son fished Melchett a few years ago. I just enjoy the Nakina area.

564630,Fishoil,2007-04-18 12:36:00,1277,"Greg, I used to fish your area quite a bit from Lukinto Lake Lodge back when Bob & Faye owned it. I really enjoyed some of the bush lakes that we fished and would like to fish some of them again. I checked your website to see what lakes you fish but don't see a list, can you e-mail me one? I assume you have boats at the various lakes and take out motors and equipment daily?"
564633,Guest,2007-04-18 15:07:00,0,How bad do you think the water levels will be this year?
