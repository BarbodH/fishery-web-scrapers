My father lives in the Chicago area and that would be the ideal location to start the trip. Any information, good or bad, would be appreciated! Thanks. JT"

You are going to have 40 or so people arriving all at the same time, not to mention the people at the camp that traveled there by other means. Be sure the capacity of the lodge fits with your expectations. Happy lodge shopping!Gonzo"
