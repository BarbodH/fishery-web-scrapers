510492,dragger,2001-01-14 10:24:00,66,"Athabasca is an extremely deep lake and it does not warm up very quickly. Any time before the beginning of August should find plenty of lakers up higher in the water column. Most of the laker fishing is flat line trolling with spoons or large flatfish T-55,60. The weight of spoon will determine the depth. Large spoons 5"" in silver, silver/blue, orange/silver and yellow five of diamonds will work well depending on the weather. Sunny for silver to five of diamonds on cloudy days. Large heavy spoons like daredevel husky are used for deeper trolling. The large flatfish and kwikfish work, but they pull hard and are not easy to fish with. Northerns can be easily found in the shallows any time in the summer. Large spinners and spoons work well. Colors I use are Brass/Gold and silver. The #5 mepps is a good standby. I make my own spinners with #7/8 Colorado blades that are lighter than musky size spinners and they stay up well in shallow water but provide a big target."
