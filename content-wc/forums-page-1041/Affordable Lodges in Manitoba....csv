510623,Guest,2001-01-18 20:30:00,0,Wondering if anyone has any experience with affordable lodges in Manitoba. By affordable I mean less than $2000 for American plan...$1700 for Housekeeping. Been doing alot of thinking about Oliver Lake Wilderness Lodge. Anyone ever been there?Thanks.
510624,JN,2001-01-20 07:50:00,47,Went to Wolverine lodge last year coast 1600 for 7 days evrything included exept guide shouldn't need one anyway. The only problem is it's a long way up there. It is worth the drive though 2 of us caught 100 to 150 3 to 5 lbs walley aday. We also caught a lot of pike over 15lbs. The food is good the lodging isn't fancey but comfortable and the fishing is exelent!
