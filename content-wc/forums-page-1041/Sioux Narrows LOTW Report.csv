In total we got 2-25"" and approx. 30 from 20-23"". WE felt the quality of fish made the size and bag limits acceptable. It must be working!! We ate fish for every meal!! Tried Yellow girl the first day and got our limits on hump in middle of the bay. We used bottom bouncers w/ Green spinner and beads with a leach in 10-20'. Also got some on green jig and leach. We were suprised at the number of big fish here as Little girl gets so much pressure. We also did great in Whitefish Bay on a few spots of course these fish were even bigger. We did mark some fish in 35-40' in Barney Narrows and tried everything to get a bite, nothing. We even had a aquaview and could'nt catch up to anything. We also found another spot like this and someone near our cabin also mentioned this. What are they? I don't think their eyes as I think we would have at least got one. Probably suckers? Heard about an area where Al Lindner fishes musky, the other side of Whitefish Bay, anybody know this area? It was a great trip with good weather and fishing and bait is expensive, but at least I brought home all the food we took up! If anyone is interested in a cabin rental at Sioux Narrows or Hayward,WI e-mail me- Great Rates and fishing!!"

We have looked into Whiskey Jacks but would like to know more about the Sioux Narrows area. We are mainly walleye fisherman and would like a housekeeping cabin. Any suggestion?Thanks, Bob Shomaker"
