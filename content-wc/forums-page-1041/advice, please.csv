510215,Frank from TBay,2001-01-18 05:26:00,312,"Mean Mike.......Perch is a game fish, using it for bait is wrong. There are lots of other things to use for bait. Leave the perch alone. In the North here you will be charged."
510216,Mean Mike,2001-01-18 08:38:00,115,"Frank, Thank you for the clarification. In no way do I want to do someting unlawful while in Ontario.thank you also, Bob.Mike"
510205,Mean Mike,2000-11-15 10:30:00,115,"hi, I am planning my 2001 Canada trip and have narrowed the choices down to the following:1. Auld Reekie Lodge - Gowganda Lake2. Horwood Lake Lodge3. Lost Lake Wilderness Lodge4. Red Pine Wiilderness Lodge - Lady Evelyn LakeIf you have been to these Lodges or Lakes would you please give me your opinion. You can respond here or email me.thanks, Mike"
510206,Tyee,2000-11-16 19:43:00,60,"Mike,Looks like you've picked out some good lodges....I consideredgoing up to the Auld Reekie Lodge on Gowganda Lake, but Iunderstood there are several other lodges on this smaller lake,and thought it might be pressured more than I would care for.I've been up to Lady Evelyn Lake several times (the last time to Red Pine and three times earlier to Island 10) and enjoyed thetrip this past summer and stayed at Red Pine (mid June and did a father-son trip). My 15 year old son took out the camp boat (we took our Lund in as this is a boat-in lake) and in front of the lodge landed a 28"" walleye on 4 lb test on his ultralight spinning rig by himself (I was taking an afternoon nap after the long drive up from the day before). Good meals and clean accomodations....Island 10 is the best camp on the lake, and I have been there....only they won't discount for teenagers; so would get real pricey with paying for (2) adult packages for the week. Red Pine will give a discount for kids/teenagers, and have a early season discount as well.....was good fishing, and great weather. To get up to Lady Lake Evelyn, you've got to go up a river, portage around a large dam, and head up the lake about 10 miles or so...water is so clean you could literally drink it, if you want to...only (4) lodges/camps total on this large lake, so you will see other boats, but not many and some days not at all.If you're going up and only paying for yourself, I'd check outIsland 10 (it has it's own website) which is what I believe is the best Lodge on the lake, and Red Pine is probably the second best. But if you're going up with one of your kids/wife/family,then Red Pine probably has the best rates for the American Plan on the lake. Lady Lake Evelyn also has decent SM Bass and N.P.fishing.I've seen the brochures on Horwood Lodge and Lost Lake Lodge,and they both look good as well....have you been to either ?Good luck on your decision....feel free to email me if youhave any specific questions on Red Pine ([email protected]).Rich"
510207,Mean Mike,2000-11-17 10:58:00,115,"Thank you for sharing, sending you an email with more questions.Mike"
510208,Guest,2001-01-10 15:09:00,0,"i don't mean to horn in but i also have been to red pine (3 times) and i can give it a very good recommendation. they have added in cottage showers and have excellent meals. last years fishing (in may) was terrible but i wouldn't base an opinion on last season as it was apparently an off-year..all lakes have them.you will particularly like the personnel, the electric start mercs.they are a bit weak on the minnow-bait department but you can make up for that by using a dip net in some back bay areas with a small degree of vegetation. get the boat in close and look for large un skittish schools along sandy beaches. dip the net in 2 feet or less and when they huddle over it, a good yank will fill your bait bucket and after ten minutes you're set.great folks there! and easy fishing. hope it helpsp"
510209,Mean Mike,2001-01-11 13:17:00,115,"Thanks for the info, Patrick, but I have already booked with Island10 Lodge. I will have to try that minnow trick, though.thank youMike"
510210,Tracy,2001-01-16 23:20:00,376,"Be careful on the catching your own bait thing, as it is illegal for nonresidents to do so in Ontario. Check your regulations carefully!tp"
510211,Mean Mike,2001-01-17 04:30:00,115,"thanks for the info. Question: If I as a nonresident of Ontario, legally catch a perch, can I use that perch for bait?thanks again"
510212,Frank from TBay,2001-01-17 04:53:00,312,"Perch is a game fish in Ontario and therefore cannot be used for bait. Tracy has a good point about the catching your own bait thing. Check with a CO before you start catching your own bait. The laws are clear on minnow traps for non residents (illegal), I am not clear on dip nets.Good fishing: Frank"
510213,Mean Mike,2001-01-17 07:54:00,115,"Thanks, Frank. I checked the regs, and on page 8, it lists the bait-fish allowed to be used in most of Ontario and the trout-perch family is on that list. Are perch not in the trout-perch family??just trying to clarify. thank you."
510217,Guest,2001-01-17 17:56:00,0,"I went to the Horwood Outpost a few years back and caught some nice fish. The problem was floating logs. They draw down the lake every winter and raise it in the spring which floats all the timber that has fallen during the winter. The wind and current pushes the logs around so you don't have any idea where they will be. I hit a dead head I didn't see and broke the transducer for my in-dash flasher. When we moved around the lake, my son had to sit in the bow to watch for the logs. Richard at the Outpost has a nice camp and I'd go back if they solved the log problem. Chuck C."
