It looks like things have gotten alot easier. Sorry my info may be a little dated but we used daredevles and magnum floating rapalas exclusively. Best colors were black, purple and fluorescent orange. The pike fishing there remains the best I've ever experienced. We boated far too many to count on our day trips there. The biggest was a 41 incher my Uncle caught and released long before C&R became the norm. We went in June as well and as I recall the back bay in the SW corner was awesome in the morning. Later in the day we would fish the shore line in the middle of the lake on the east side, after the river. Fish the wind swept shore and you can't go wrong. We never did scare up any Walleyes or Muskie which is strange given Thaddeus on one end and Lac Seul down the river. I understand they have an outpost on Lac Seul you may want to try. Best of luck to you and let us know how you did.Tom"
