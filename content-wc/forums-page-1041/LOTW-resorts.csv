It is A truly life time erea. Fishing is second to none. Take A guide for your first time or so. I spend all my time at the baystore resort. Frank and Laura take great care in there guest. Frank is the only owner that has A real grasp on what is going on. He spend alot of hours on the lake as A guide.Being located on Oak Island is A real advantage, beacause your minutes from the action.I highly recommend them.Bay Store resort218 223 8621 Good Luck Bret"
510518,dlhomes,2001-01-21 14:37:00,62,"My cabin is available for rent on LOTW. We are 4 miles NE of Sioux Narrows. This can also be a great family spot as there is shopping (Yeah!?) and we have a beautiful sand beach w/ southern exposure. Cabin interior is knotty pine and consists of 3 bedrooms, full modern kitchen, bath w/ shower, t.v.,heat, screenroom and deck. Also boat launch, fish house and free boat docking!! Super affordable @ $475 per week! Contact me for more info. No guide needed - I'll even mark your map."
510519,Guest,2001-01-24 13:51:00,0,"Thanks for all the great advice. I'm astonished by how helpful everyone has been, and the input we got was really useful, and helped solidify in our minds where to go: Witch Bay.My dad and I will be there from July 20-25. I can't wait. If anyone else is there at that time, let me know. I'd like to be able to put faces to some of the names (handles) I've seen here since starting this search.Thanks again.Bill"
510507,Guest,2001-01-11 07:07:00,0,"I'm trying to plan a trip to Lake of the Woods during July. It will be my first trip there. Looking for advice on resorts, or even what part of the lake to go to. We have usually gone to the same place on Rainy Lake for the past 10 years or so. Have always liked it, but getting the urge to check out something new. LOTW has been soemthing we've looked at for years, but it can be kind of intimidating because of its massive size.We would prefer a place where you don't have to cross big water to get to fishing sites. After looking at maps, the Northeast side seems pretty broken up with bays, islands, etc. Has anyopne fished that end of the Lake? One resort that caught my eye was Witch's Bay Camp. Anyone stayed there?Any and all advice would be welcomed. Thanks."
510508,Rob,2001-01-11 09:53:00,103,My advice to you would be to check out happy landing lodge. Its the only resort on the north end of pipestone lake. It has six different types of fish and 13 different lakes to fish. If your worried about wind this is the place to go.
510509,Guest,2001-01-12 06:24:00,0,We have had great times at Red Wing Resort out of Morson. Great walleye 1/4 mile out of resort. Close to Sabaskong Bay for musky.
510510,Guest,2001-01-13 19:32:00,0,"HiYou are right about Witch Bay Camp. There is good fishing near camp and it is very secluded from other areas.I have been a guest there for over 40 trips.They have American Plan, fishing seminars for those who like, satelite t.v. for the kids and air conditioned cabins. First rate service and food.Mike McDonaldJefferson, WI"
510511,Kaz,2001-01-14 10:53:00,643,"Do you really want to fish Canadian waters???? If not limiting yourself to two per day and take home only four, is what you want, try the Minnesota side. US gas prices more fish and a friendly goverment. I talked to several Canadian resort owners at the show in St Paul and they are not happy with the way things are happening, but say they need our support and understand our position. If you want to fish LOTW, try the Wheelers Point resorts. There are several to choose from, and lots of resturants too. Good luck FISHING....Kaz"
510512,Steve,2001-01-15 04:50:00,259,"We have been going to Ontario Wilderness Houseboats in Morson for the last 8 years. We have a mix of walleye and musky anglers in our party and the last two years we have seemed to work alot harder for our fish than we had to in the past, alot to do with timing of the year and everyone's vacation schedule.We are now going back over to the Northwest angle where we have seem to see alot more muskies. As for the walleye fishing,it may be a wash but NW angle seems to offer a tad more reef fishing for those mid July eyes as well as some open water trolling. Hope this helps"
510513,Kaz,2001-01-15 14:15:00,643,"Steve: Did you ever fish with Billy Sandy??? His mother and dad had ""Sandys Moument Bay Resort"" for many years. They sold it about five years ago but Billy stayed on. Two years ago he started a new one closer to Youngs Bay landing. His parents I understand are helping him develop it. All brand new and lots of rooms. Great food if you go on the American Plan. His mom is a great cook. Bill has been in the mags with many 50"" plus muskies. If you have fished that area I'm sure you may of heard of him. He still take guiding trips too, I think. Good luck FISHING...Kaz"
510514,Ron,2001-01-15 18:26:00,387,"Spent 6 days at Witch Bay Camp last year in July and out of7 years fishing on Eagle, Lac Suel and others, Witch Bayis where we are going back to again this year. We are avid Walleye chasers but also got into Smallies and a few Northern.Muskie was cool.Any questions, send me an e-mail as we really enjoyed it.Being new to the lake, they provide guides to take you out to some hot spots until you get familar with the lake.Awesome trip!!"
510515,Guest,2001-01-19 19:51:00,0,"You sound a bit like me, i.e., ""the only purpose for a boat is to get me to where the fish live"".Take a look at Tomahawk Lodge at Sioux Narrows. There are better bodies of water in Ontario than LOTW and more secluded areas on LOTW than Sioux Narrows but, IMHO you just can't operate a resort better than the Kast family.Cottages are clean and comfortable, equipment and boats are first-rate and well-maintained and the friendliness of the staff is genuine. These folks really want you to catch fish and enjoy yourself.I'd recommend that you upgrade to one of their 20' boats. We've been out in some pretty rough weather and the 20-footer handled quite well.Regards,Bob"
