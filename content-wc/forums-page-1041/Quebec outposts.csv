510481,Guest,2001-01-18 19:06:00,0,"have been to ceasars twice. Both times at Lake Super. Our 1st trip was great. Many fish, close to 400 for 3 people for a week,walleyes in the 15"" to 18"" range with a few in the 20s, pike in the upper 20""s to lower 30"" range. Nothing over 40 that we caught.You will also pick up some white fish and a few perch.We were up there in the middle of Aug and the temp never got above 65 for the week, with the lows in the 30s at night. Our 2nd time was during a drought period,hihs in the 70S to low 80S, the lake was down at least 6 to 8 feet from when we had seen it last. Due to the lack of water the fishing patterns were very slow, we still caught fish but the total numbers were down and we picked up more white fish than we did our previous visit. As far as accomadation, it is bear bones, but that suits me just fine. Oliver does make sure your treated well. One piece of advice, if you can afford it, fly in from St. Veronique. That drive to the Coursol base is a real mother-you-know-what!. Figure about 3.5 to 5 hours of dirt road, depending on how fast you drive and how much punisment your truck will take. If you drive make sure you do it during the day to arrive there before dark. You can stay for free at Coursol over night, they have a few crude bunk house to crash in. Have FUN"
510482,Guest,2001-01-24 20:50:00,0,i have been at both camps and of the two you mentioned berthlotlodge is the nicest but also the most expensive. ceasers was all right but had a few dissagreements on where we were fishinf or flying from and constant changing of pricing depending where you met them- the road is not a problem anymore so i would reccomend driving to clova and fly with tamarac air service to the gouin resevor or lak herbert- much much bigger walleye and plenty of them - i have never caought less than 4/500 in week myself and i have several on wall here over 12 # - anymore info- email mei have gone in june till early august last 10 years- same results
