510544,Guest,2001-01-20 20:05:00,0,I've never fished Kitawa but I have Cabonga-big sucking reservoir!!! I was there 2 years ago and the water was 6 to 8 foot low and we didn't have much success but they're in there. Eyes and lakers. The best place for the eyes is at the inlet on the SE end of the reservoir. Good accomodations and reasonable-great hosts.
