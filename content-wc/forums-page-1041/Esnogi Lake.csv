510666,jerry,2001-01-23 15:18:00,966,Am thinking about booking a week on Esnogi Lake(fly in lake out of White River area). I would appreciate any reports about this lake re: walleye and pike fishing. Thanks.
510667,Guest,2001-01-24 04:36:00,0,"JerryI believe the lake you are referencing is Esnagi, spelled with an ""a"" which is a accessible thru White River. I have never fished this lake but have heard good things about it's pike population. Not sure about the eye's but multiple persons have told me that it's resident pike population is impressive, clearly they are the dominant predator in this lake. There is a man by the name of Bill Rivers, he is a friend of mine, and maintains the webzines ""anglingadventures.com"" and ""ontariofisherman.com"". Goto either one of those sites and browse around. Down at the bottom he has links to Ontarios best fly in lodges, outpost camps, etc. If you goto the lodges there is a place called MarMac Lodge on Esnagi Lake. Check it out. One can NEVER do too much research, half the fun is in the planning. Best of luck.."
