How do I obtain this nectar right now? And how much can I bring back across the border this summer? Tried some local liquor stores in Des Moines, IA and the internet without any luck. Thanks for any help or advice."

I have a friend that lives in North Dakota and makes regular trips to Canada... he always brings back a case or two... I've searched everywhere in Minneapolis, no one sells it... I think that's how they keep us coming back to Canada... that ##### beer... ohh, and the awesome fishing doesn't hurt!"
