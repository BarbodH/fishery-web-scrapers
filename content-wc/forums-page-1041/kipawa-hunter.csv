510591,Guest,2001-01-16 09:28:00,0,"I've been to Kipawa and had great success with fishing. The beauty of the area is unmatched also. We stayed at Corbeau Lodge and had a wonderful week...we've already booked for this coming June again, only this time we have more people. The owners of Corbeau Lodge are great people and do everything to make sure your stay is comfortable and relaxing. I strongly recommend both the lake and the lodge."
510592,Guest,2001-01-16 15:27:00,0,"i really appreciate your feedback. we did our last ontario trip last year and this is our first quebec attempt so i'm in the dark. i should've done my homework earlier but got stunned by the rate increase at our usual place. plus the fishing has been declining.can you give me any idea of the amount of daily catches to expect? we're pretty good eyemen so any kind of numbers guess should let us know what to expect. anyway for what you've provided,, it's been a help already!p"
510593,Guest,2001-01-17 14:39:00,0,"Well, we went to Lake Kipawa in early August. We had originally scheduled for late August, but a sudden change of my buddy's schedule put us there earlier than we'd wanted. I have to say though, we weren't disappointed. I would say we're ""good"" walleye fisherman and we consistently out-produced others staying at Corbeau Lodge. As a matter of fact, some long-time lodge guests were wondering later in the week when the fish were going to start biting. Read on. We would fish in the morning early (on the lake before sun-up) and in the evening mostly for 'eyes. I was the hotstick in the group and I averaged about 10 every morning and maybe 5-8 in the evening. Others in my group were about 60% of that. Lots of fish in the 16"" - 18"" range, with the occassional 22""-24"" fish...those are nice, fat gals. In the afternoon we'd go for pike in weedy bays. Our largest pike was a 40"" fish...pretty nice considering the lake is not heavily populated with pike. Lake Trout are also there, but we didn't fish for them. I understand the Lake Trout action is above average, we just didn't have the gear to go get 'em. Corbeau Lodge will loan you the stuff you need (rod / reel) for Lake Trout, but we were too lazy that week. We're going to try this year though. We battled some pretty heavy rain too. Rainsuits were used most days at some time or another. I think we only had one really nice day and that was the day we left. That's okay with me though, as I know if the weather is dark and damp, the 'eyes are hitting. We used mostly jigs, pounding them on the bottom in 16'-22' of water. No live bait was really necessary, though we used about 1/3 nightcrawler if the action was slow. I expect the early-June fish to be both shallow and deep and maybe a little harder to establish a pattern. We'll find out...I can't wait.It's a great place, as I said, both the lake and Corbeau Lodge. The lodge has a website if you want to visit. Just search any engine for Corbeau Lodge, it'll pop up; or go to www.kipawa.com and click on Outfitters; you can get to Corbeau's site from there. Good luck in your search. Glad to help."
