The complaint letter we sent them had a total of 15 items on it. It was a total rip-off, and their customer service skills are terrible. It's been a month now, and my entire family is still steaming over the tremendous amount of money we paid for a 3-1/2 day trip. They may appear cheaper than other houseboat rentals in the Lake of the Woods area, but believe me, you get what you pay for--and you don't get much from these guys!"

If you like the experience but not your service, try Dan and Noreen at http://www.lowhouseboats.com/ They've been the owners/operators of the place since the mid 80's, at least. They have always been wonderful to rent from."
559853,Guest,2006-07-30 19:02:00,0,We use the other Houseboat rental company in Morson...Ontario Wilderness Houseboats...we too have heard from others that the boats and service at Canada North is brutal. Many of Ontario Wilderness Houseboat Rentals customers have told us that they tried Canada North first and came over to OWHR. Ontario Wilderness Houseboats also have a large list of references you can obtain.
