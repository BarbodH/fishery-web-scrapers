560250,brian1785,2006-08-11 11:44:00,1534,I agree with you bronzeback. I totally see your point.
560252,Guest,2006-08-11 12:09:00,0,"Shoal lake which is a large lake attached to lake of the woods and at one time an amazing walleye fishery. Now I'm sure it has been over 25 years now that they haven't had an open walleye season on this lake. This lake as far as I know went unchecked with I'll just call it netting. After they closed the lake to all. Fishing nets were still being found. This lake is not as big as LOTW but if what I understand the tons of fish taken weekly and they fish with no commercial value ( musky , pike smallmouth for example )are basically left behind . HOW long can that lake substain a quality of fishing. A few people are making bucks compaired to many making off of tourism"
560253,IaCraig,2006-08-11 12:52:00,434,"Sounded to me like Aaron does like me and brings his family up to enjoy the fishing vacation with him. When I first started trips to Ontario, I used to make it a goal to bring home my limit so I had some in the freezer. At some point that no longer was important to me. Now I eat fish while I am there, and when we want a meal of fish throughout the year it gives me an excuse to go to fishing around home. :-) IaCraig"
560254,Blackmacs,2006-08-11 13:59:00,2121,"This weeks Minnesota Outdoor News, August 11,2006, has an article by Gord Ellis that states the Ontario conservation officers are now desk bound unless they get a tip called in about a violation. Believe it or not they can't just go out and patrol their area and check fisherman, hunters, or who ever else. It's all in the name of money saving. What's so moronic is that the Bearwise program that traps and moves problem bears has money to burn. Hmm I wonder why there are so many problem bears? Couldn't have anything to do with ending the spring bear hunt could it? Quite the state of affairs in the great white north."
560257,Guest,2006-08-11 15:32:00,0,Not to mention all the $$ they crapped away with the gun registry up there. No wonder they have no money.
560325,Guest,2006-08-15 10:09:00,0,That gun registry was the biggest pile of #### . I'm sure it's the registered gun ownes doing all the drive by's
560327,canuk1100,2006-08-15 10:28:00,43,Just a thought when was the last time you saw a wild buffalo on the open prarie conservation does work save the resource for your kids and grandkids.
560328,canuk1100,2006-08-15 10:38:00,43,"Here is some math 10,000 fishermen 4 walleye each 40,000 fish wow!!!"
560333,Guest,2006-08-15 12:21:00,0,BrianD.......got a call last night from someone else out on the Island. They said there was a major bear problem out there right now. One cabin was damaged pretty bad. Sounds like it's time to go hunting.
560335,Guest,2006-08-15 12:56:00,0,"We keep a old lever 30/30 around the place. Easy to swing , packs a punch, bullet doesn't travel far. A couple years a go my daughter was down with her grandma and during the night a bear came through a window. Nobody harmed. Get this the opp and warden wouldn't do anything. So we brought a rifle down. Now if we want to keep our windows openned at night we have boards full of 2"" drywall screws and we lay them in front of openned windows. Never a problen since We usally see lots in the fall . We are less the 1/2 mile from the dump as the eagle flys We've seen unually more wolfs this year as well. always a treat to see one"
560191,River_eye,2006-08-10 09:39:00,1486,"All I'm saying is.......... you have to practice not only what the law states, but what is the right thing to do. You're government doesn't know best in every situation you know, you seem old enough to realize that. If you choose a catch and release lodge, over a lodge where you can keep fish, you are not only helping out the lake as an individual, but you are supporting others to as well."
560192,Guest,2006-08-10 09:40:00,0,I think all you tree hugger catch and release guys should fish Minnesota and let us bring em all back go to Canada.
560194,bronzeback77,2006-08-10 09:50:00,97,"I agree with you 100% about the house boats and commercial netting. When the commercial netting subject first appeared on this site over a year ago I sent countless emails and letters to anyone I could think of in NW Ontario and several of the prominent outdoor magazines ( In Fisherman, Outdoor Life, Ontario Out Of Doors). I do believe that these problems are very serious. I have two young sons and hope that someday I can take my grandchildren to Canada so I want nothing but the best for LOTWs. I comments were not intended to be a personal attack on you, I just wanted everyone to revaluate the true reason that we all enjoy fishing so much, I hope that it is not just for the meal. PS I am not a tree hugger, just a contentious sportsman"
560204,Guest,2006-08-10 13:48:00,0,"Over the years great strides have been taken in consevation and protecting the fishery. Reduced limits have been one step, but the most important too me anyway is the slot size. It was common pratice to keep everything , and the bigger the better was very common. Just look in every fillet house in years past, or any pictures at any lodge. I beleive you all fish for the sport first that's a given, Now if one choses to eat fish while up and bring some home I don't see a problem. You paid for your licence like everybody else. And it's not up to the goverment to step in to stock fish to keep the numbers up. That's only happens when a system has been mismanged, and in NW ONT I don't recall in particular a stocking program for walleye. And it scares me to think that people would consider going to a differnt border for the reason thinking that there not checking there. That group that had too many in one car and not enough in the other must be polite people. The warden understands that people makes mistakes, and I'm sure that's why only a warning was issued. Know it all jerks would of gotten a fine. I think it was about time that the warden's are actually doing there job and checking. The only people I can see complaing about that is somebody who has something to hide."
560207,Mohleye,2006-08-10 14:15:00,368,"My questions about a different border crossing had nothing to do with fish checks. We buy conservation licenses, and have been checked enough times over the years to know about splitting the fish up correctly among the vehicles, etc. We crossed at Ft Frances July 15, and the line was past the Ft Frances city limit sign. We waited over 3 hours, the temp was over 100, and there were near-fistfights when someone would try to cut in line. If I can avoid that by crossing at Baudette, it sounds good to me."
560209,Guest,2006-08-10 14:21:00,0,I've been going to NW Ontario for 28 years now and have never even thought of bringing a fish back. Now it makes me wonder if they are as good thawed then cooked six months later? Taking pictures of all the fish I catch is sufficient enough for convincing friends and family that I'm not up there just to drink the Candian beer.
560224,Guest,2006-08-10 19:52:00,0,Well Aaron if you've never thought of bringing back a few fish for your family to eat. Maybe their glad you and your camera are in Canada.
560230,Guest,2006-08-10 22:12:00,0,I doubt they are the superficial.
560238,Guest,2006-08-11 07:48:00,0,"I am sure there a lot of groups like yours, and that is great. See, it just balances out the specturm. I take 4 home, you take none."
560249,River_eye,2006-08-11 11:22:00,1486,"That reminds me of one of the greatest peices of wisdom I ever received as a child was that there are two different types of people in the world, givers and takers."
560167,MN_Moose,2006-08-09 16:25:00,965,You are correct sir!
560169,River_eye,2006-08-09 17:20:00,1486,"Two words man. Sabaskong Bay. That bay has been hit hard by tourists and commercial netters, and the fish populations there are very sad. This proves that government controls (laws) cannot protect a fishery from being damaged. Thank goodness there are anglers that realize that their legal limit still has an impact, and choose to take less. Unfortunately, there are still too many people that see taking their limit as legal, so it's morally acceptable to neglect the impact they have on the resource. Also, your comment on the sportsmen ""taking the hit"" when regulations are increased, is downright asinine. Doesn't the sportsman ""take the hit"" when a fishery is mismanaged and he has to drive to the next lake to find fish? and isn't the sportsman the first to benefit from increased fish populations brought about by stricter regulations?"
560170,River_eye,2006-08-09 17:24:00,1486,"This isn't a question of what's legal and what's not. This is a question about being a true sportsman and recognizing ones impact on a resource, and responsibility to protect it. You are taking the ignorant view that it's the governments job to protect the fishery, and you don't have to exercise any conservation techniques past what the law states."
560172,bronzeback77,2006-08-09 18:35:00,97,"Let me clarify my position. I am not saying that there is anything wrong with catching and bringing home your limit. The limits are set using scientific data collected by the MNR, I believe that they know more about the fish population in LOTWs than any of us on this forum. If the MNR says four is the limit than four it is. My fishing trips to Canada mean a lot to me, and I count the days to my next trip as soon as I get home. What bothers me is someone saying that their reason for going fishing whether that be in Canada or Table Rock Lake is directly related to the number of fish that they can eat. There is more to Fishing than ""food"", most of us with enough money and spare time to be going to Canada and typing on our computers have enough income that we are not catching food to feed our families like our relatives from the great depression. Let's base our experience in Canada on the number of memories we take back with us across the border not the number of fish. Excuse me, I almost tripped while getting down from my soapbox :-)"
560175,Guest,2006-08-09 19:09:00,0,"I was at rice lake in Ontario a few years ago(im from Ontario). The people in the cottage next to me were from Maryland. They vacationed at the same place/ same week every year. I was talking too him about fishing,, telling him of a couple other lakes I had fished in the area and enjoying a couple pops and shooting the bull. anyways, first afternoon we were fishing the same area, myself and my wife on my boat, he was with his wife and 3 kids. We were fishing for bluegills, myself and my wife kept 16 or 18 enough for dinner that night. They had 2 wire baskets over the sides of theyre boat and they were just rocketting fish in there. Personally I dont care how many bluegills he keeps from that lake,, way too many too begin with anyways. We left, I went too fish house and cleaned our dinner, went back too the cabin fryed them up with some potatoes, coleslaw buns, beans and were sitting on the deck enjoying dinner. About an hour after dark they pulled in and walked into the cabin made a sandwich and went too bed. Next morning, I was up early hopped in the boat by myself and went and fished bass for a couple hours before breakfast. Pulled up too the dock and here comes the neighbor to retrieve the 2 baskets and take them too clean. Man youve got alot of fish in there! Oh yeah we do this every day while we are here,, we generally fill 3 or 4 coolers worth too take home, dont you do the same?? No, I'd rather catch enough just too eat a couple times while here.. Thats crazy you should fill up while you can... No whats crazy is you spend all afternoon catching them, your too tired too clean them when you get back, then you spend the entire next morning cleaning fish! Im here on vacation,, I didnt come too work!"
560177,Guest,2006-08-09 19:57:00,0,"Don't pull the 'true sportsman' card, abiding by the law makes me an upstanding citizen, and if I keep the limit (and you don't), doesn't make me a criminal and you a saint - because I don't feel the same way as you, or your opinion is different than mine, doesn't make you holier-than-thou, nor does it me. Now, when you go home with 2 of 4 walleye, by choice of course, make sure you row yourself to shore instead of that gas powered motor that is affecting the lake and fish as well. And, don't speed on the way home."
560182,Guest,2006-08-09 23:25:00,0,"I am not a meat fisherman. I have released many big fish over the years and kept smaller ""eating size"". I have fished with the conservation license many times. You should be concerned about the ""MEAT BOATS"" houseboats with 6 to 12 people onboard tying up near the good walleye water and all eating walleye 3 times a day for a week. Commercial Fisherman out of Kenora netting thousands of pounds of walleye a week. I'm not as old or knowlegable as you but have been going to LOTW since I got out of the Navy in 1970. I enjoy the scenery, wildlife and relaxation. You seem a little high and mighty to think I go just for the fishing and how much I can bring home. I have managed over the years to ""hook"" 7 or 8 new people who join me or have their own trips to LOTW. Being retired, if anything keeps me away from Canada it will be the price of gas for car & boat. Our trip per guy other years including gas,lodging,food,bait,licenses,dockage fees,etc ran $500 or less per guy. This year for the same basic trip it was $850 per guy."
560186,Guest,2006-08-10 08:15:00,0,"I agree, these guys are concerned that you take 4 walleye home, then call you a 'meat hunter' and then say 'if it's meat you want, then go to the store abd buy some'. Well, store-bought fish is commercial fishing walleye, and those are the guys you should be concerned about. Tons and tons of fish per week, and they're worried about 4 friggen walleye. Hypocrits."
560189,bronzeback77,2006-08-10 08:56:00,97,"I will try this again. In your original post you said you were thinking about canceling your future trips to Canada because of the restrictions on the number of fish you could bring home. Which is what bothered me, maybe I am too sensitive. In your last post you said that the cost of gas, lodging, etc. were the reason that you were going to stop going. I am sure we all understand the reasons mentioned in your second post as they are quite valid. I was only giving my opinion, we can agree to disagree. That is the fun of this forum."
560190,Guest,2006-08-10 09:33:00,0,"I agree we can disagree and I'm not peeved by your comments. I wish you would address your feeling on the houseboat flotilla that harvests many more walleye than the average fisherman staying at a fishing camp. We see doubledeck houseboats go buy with up to 12 people onboard. It would not be easy to police how many fish they harvest and eat each day which should be only 2 walleye per person, correct? I have read on the forum last year that commercial fishermen out of Kenora were taking thousands of pounds of walleye a week from the lake. I don't know if that operation is still going or not. According to what I've read about LOTW there is an never has been a stocking program on the lake and it's all by natural reproduction. Netting would take its toll ""big time"" if this were true. I know in Wisconsin there have been wars over Native American netting in the spring & spearing of large female walleye & muskies. The resort owners in those area's were concerned about their livelyhood if the fish population was on the decline."
560095,Sutsgold,2006-08-08 08:48:00,219,"Many years back it was rumored that minnesota was hasseling fishermen coming back into the states via strict fish checks. It was rumored that the more difficult they made it to come back in the less likely you would take your fishing trip north of the border, and thus spend your vacation dollars in Minnesota. Just a rumor, but interesting theory none the less."
560099,Guest,2006-08-08 10:00:00,0,"I'm beginning to realize with limits dropping on the amount of fish you can take home - the price of gas - hassles at the border it might be easier to stay in the states. LOTW went from a possesion limit of 6 walleyes to 4 and then to a daily possesion limit of 2 per license. That means for us that to get our 4 eating size walleye at our favorite walleye hole to bring home, we have to make 2 fairly long trips, burning several tanks of gas each time. I've been coming to LOTW since 1970 and enjoy the beauty of the area as well as the fishing. I see all these problems hurting the fishing camps and I wonder how many of them will go under in time. My group of 6 guys are all debating whether to return to Canada again next year or there after."
560101,Guest,2006-08-08 10:54:00,0,"regarding preparation for trip home. I have a manual that is my bible for the fishing trip, it includes grocery lists, menus, items to pack, etc. and also a list of how many of each species of fish we take back. when coming home I put this page on the frount of the manual. the Boarder asked for it. I opened the book to the page, and they waved me on. Preparing for the trip home is an advantage."
560108,Guest,2006-08-08 15:25:00,0,"Lesson learned I guess. Maybe it's just me, but I just 'assumed' that if I can only have 4 fish per person in my boat, that the same rule would apply when driving. I would NEVER take more fish in my truck, than I have people. Rules are rules, and it's our responsibility as fishermen to know them. Ignorance is not an excuse."
560131,bronzeback77,2006-08-09 07:56:00,97,"This may make me sound like a jerk but oh well. You say you have been going to LOTWs since 1970 enjoying the beauty and the fishing. But if you are complaining about the number of fish you can bring back home it seems to me you have missed the point. Sure, I bring back my limit of Walleye but if I was told on my next trip ( Sept 1-10) that I could not bring back any fish it would not stop me from going. If you want fish that bad go to the grocery store or a nice restaurant. There is so much more to Canada and LOTWs than how many #### fish you can stuff in a cooler. In your original post you said you had a limit of pike, crappie, bass and walleye. I am just wondering why you spared the Bullheads, Lake trout, Muskie and Crawdads. You sound like more of a hunter than a fisherman. Sorry, I am sure you are a nice guy but it just seems sad that your main reason for going is the number of fish you can eat."
560140,Jimmy Jig,2006-08-09 10:05:00,1905,Well spoken Bronzeback.
560159,Guest,2006-08-09 14:12:00,0,you hit the nail on the head BRONZEBACK. If I want to get a better value on MEAT I go to the Butcher Shop. Fishing is not about meat its about who you are with and where you are at and how great a time you can have. Thank God for Canada and all its beauty....I'm going until they close the lid om my casket. Meat fisherman do me a favor and stay home.
560160,junglejim,2006-08-09 14:46:00,66,"I don't think it is unresonable to expect to take 4 walleyes home after spending a week at a resort. That's not even one fish a day. It's easy to say this guy is a fish hog. All the cost go up yearly, why isn't the lake stocked and managed correctly ? Why is it the sportman always taking the hit with the limits being reduced ? How about a special licence that would cost less and allow the guy to fish but keep no fish. Sure it's nice to get up the north woods but why is it wrong to want to take a few fish home to enjoy. The tourist/fisherman bring alot of income to Canada and they should be able to take a few fish home to enjoy with their family."
560161,Guest,2006-08-09 14:59:00,0,"Nobody said he was a fish hog. He stated that he was thinking about not going back because of the low possesion limit. I say that indicates that how many fish he brings home is more important than enjoying Canada and its endless bounty. The day of bringing home a cooler full of fish evry time you go is over. Catch and Release is the way today. C&R will allow the fishery to be sustained for all of us and future fisherman. I started fishing Minnesota over 50 years ago and the fishing was good. But coolers of fish went home every day and the state of Minnesota ignored protecting the fishery...today Minnesota fishing is not comparable to Canada and it never will be as long as Canada continues to protect the resource through limits, catch and release and slots. The future of fishing is in every fishermans hands everytime he catchs a fish. Respect the law and protect the resource...it works ."
560164,Guest,2006-08-09 15:20:00,0,"There is nothing wrong with taking your daily limit, and taking your limit home. The law allows it, so there is nothing wrong with it. It is in your opinion that it is wrong, but your opinion is not the law. If the MNR or DNR found that 4 per day is too much, they'd lower it. If we didn't take fish home, or if nobody fished at all, we'd have fish kill-off problems and they population would end up regulating itself anyway. All of you 'meat hunter' haters should just complain when people disobey the law - until then, they're doing nothing illegal - get off their back. We should be more concerned with 'not knowing how many fish I can take across the border (IE, above)' than we are with guys taking 4 walleye home. Gosh."
560049,Guest,2006-08-06 22:34:00,0,Out of Sioux Narrows - East end of Sunset in Blueberry in whats called the chute. The Crappies where shallow in about 10 feet of water.

Border crossing took 1 minute this year at 9 am, they opened a new lane and I was first customer. Average wait at Ft Francis that day at 9 was 1 hour !!!!

It's out of our way, but we waited in line over 3 hours July 15 at Ft Frances. Wondering whether it's worth driving the extra miles, and what kinds of lines guys have experienced crossing into the US from Canada at Baudette?"
560057,Guest,2006-08-07 10:21:00,0,We had all the fish except for the Crappies individually wrapped and had them wrapped in bundles of 3. We always leave the skin on all our fish when we filet them. It just takes a second to remove the skin when you thaw them out to cook. I guess we got off real lucky & learned our lesson. We got delayed in Ft. Frances by customs on the way up and got sent to the office for an ID check which took an hour. They didn't search our vehicle or boat. I guess they ran us for driving violations & DUI's which none of us had. We've heard if you are driving on a suspended license or had a recent DUI you might not get in without the proper paperwork.
560059,Guest,2006-08-07 10:25:00,0,The DNR said they have a mutual agreement with Canada on enforcing fishing laws & quota's. How many fisherman from Minnesota are crossing the border into Canada with fish??

The lines at Baudette are never long (no more than 2-3 cars) but in the end I think it's about a toss up. Nice to travel through different country though."

When we buy our fishing permit each of should be recieving a copy of the rules that govern the transporttation of fish and the rules that explain the possesion limit. It is OUR responsibilty as fisherman to know the rules, understand the rules and abide by the rules. I have sympathy for those who make an honest mistake however I caution you to take as much time preparing for the transportation of your fish home as you do preparing your fishing equipment for the trip to Canada. That kind of preperation and planning will save you a lot of saddness and cash at the border with the DNR IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILTY...."
560031,Guest,2006-08-06 11:49:00,0,"A word of warning on fisherman returning to the US from Canada. DNR was at International Falls doing fish checks. We were traveling in 2 vehicles pulling boats with a total of 6 - 3 in each vehicle. Our mistake was having all the limits for all 6 in one big cooler. The other group cleared customs and went to Border Bob's to wait for us. We went through customs with 6 limits and 3 licenses and were sent to the DNR area. I told the guys we were a party of 6 and the rest of the group had just crossed ahead of us & were waiting for us. He said we were had a over limit violation with all the fish in my vehicle. He let me try and call the other group to come back - no luck. I asked if I coud walk and bring them back. He said no but said A DNR Officer would give me a ride to find them. We did and they returned with the boat. He checked all 6 licenses, did a fish count, searched the boats, gave us a lecture - the DNR was very professional and courteous to us. He let me go with a warning ticket. They could have fined me a $100 per fish over our 3 person limit if we weren't allowed to bring the other part of our group back to be checked. Only have limits for the number of licenses you have in your vehicle. We should have had only 12 walleye, 12 Pike, 12 bass and 45 crappie for our party of 3, we had double that in my vehicle for our whole group of 6. That will never happen again!!"

As you, we had all of our fish in two coolers but were in 4 different vehicles. They issued citations for $132 each to the drivers of the 2 vehicles carrying the fish for illegal transportation and siezed the fish that were over. It's interesting that in 10 years of traveling to & from Canada I have never seen a Minnesota DNR officer at the border. I guess you live and learn, but it all seemed a bit heavy handed to me."

560048,Guest,2006-08-06 20:24:00,0,I can recall having my fish counted by the Minnesota game warden on the way back from Sioux Lookout. This was back when they still had the old building at the border. There was a fisherman pulled over on the right side and he was spread eagle across the hood of his car. I guess they know what they were looking for and it wasn't fish.
