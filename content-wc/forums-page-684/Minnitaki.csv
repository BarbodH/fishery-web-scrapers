And if anyone has been at Butterfly Lake(Timber Edge Camps) lately. I saw a month ago that the channel or creek leading to Minnitaki was a little on the low side. I was wondering if that has improved. The kids are fired up and raring to go. Thanks ahead of time for your replies. Lazyk"
560122,Guest,2006-08-08 22:17:00,0,Just got back. water temp 70 to 72. nite crawlers fairly deep. we used spinners with great success. water level is down i would say upto 2 ft. from whne i was there in june. we stayed up near the Abram chutes. the popular reef was packed wiuth boats. we never used minnows justg crawlers. any more scoop or specifics let me know. PS i did hear Butterfly lake access was getting tough due to water level but did not witness it myself. Terry IA

560132,lazyk,2006-08-09 08:00:00,26,"Terri IA, thanks for the info. We usually fish near the Kenora/Winnipeg river area around this time of year and that all sounds about par. Fishing sounded like it was good for you. I`d rather stay away from the popular areas as I`ve had my share of boats fishing within ten feet of me. Are there quite a few weedy bays? I`m assuming its such a big lake that there will be a variety of places to choose from for adventures. We`ve used spinners and cranks with good success in the past. Also did well `weed whacking` when the fishing was tough. Has anyone trolled open water with cranks at this time of year, like I see posted on Sand lake? There`s nothing like the week before you go up to Canada to dream about how good its going to be. If the fishing is no good you can always go swimming, right? LazyK"

The creek into Minnitaki was indeed low, I could just get thru by slowing down, trimming the motor up, and taking the more circuitous sections of channel (the straight-thru sections tend to be shallower). My boat is 16.5 ft with a 50 hp Merc. There were no boats bigger than 17 ft, so I don't know how a bigger boat would fare. The boats provided by Timber Edge had no problem getting thru. Fishing was good, not great. Best place was Redpine. Got lots of walleyes up to 15 inches, not very many 15 to 18 inches, so we kept smaller fish than in past years. Got 5 fish over the slot, 22 to 24 inches, about 10 fish in the slot, in a group of 5 people fishin and two boats."

560288,Guest,2006-08-13 22:15:00,0,"I fished Minnitaki From last Sat-Wed and we had a blast. This is our 5th year staying at Abrams Lake Resort. The water was approx 2' ft low and the chute was a little hairy but no major issues. Fishing was great and we did well on the flats w/ snells. I am heading back up there this Friday-Weds. Good luck, Ryan"
