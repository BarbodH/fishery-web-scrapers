Heading up to Perrault Falls area tomorrow and figure it's more cost effective to buy bait closer to the border. Thanks in advance for any suggestions! ""Jackpot"" John Schroeder"

I did equally well on crawlers and minnows, I will not be buying leeches nor minnows this next trip. Crawlers only. My advice is to save the $ to buy more beer. Good luck, Ryan"
