560174,Guest,2006-08-09 19:03:00,0,Been to the NE Quandrant twice in September. 2002 and 2005. Lots of fronts. Lots of wind.

560185,Guest,2006-08-10 07:36:00,0,"Cooler in the morning, jacket and stocking hat running from spot to spot. Warms up by noon and somedays it can be t-shirt weather. But it can get nasty and stay nasty. You should probably plan on bringing everything from your snowsuit to your speedo. Good luck."

About a third of the way down the page is a section that says history and Almanac. Just enter your date range and you can see what the weather was like on September 20, 1999."
