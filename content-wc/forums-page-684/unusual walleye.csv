560259,Guest,2006-08-11 17:34:00,0,"do not know but i remeber a long tim ago when i was like 8 years old(when i first went to canada with dad) we were at clay lake, north star lodge and a guy in our crew caught a blue walleye, camp owner took it and mounted it and put in the lodge area."
560260,Guest,2006-08-11 17:45:00,0,thought of that but was in alberta on the other side of the great divide. I have never heard of a blue walleye out here and I am told they are extinct??
560261,Rich B,2006-08-11 20:29:00,1081,"Caught a ""blue walleye"" out of Lady Lake Eveleyn a few years ago that was 7+ lbs and was a beautiful blue.....when you held it your hand would have a blue tint rub off on your hand. The other walleyes we caught up north in that lake were all a Canadian ""yellow gold""; and the lodge owner told us that once or twice a year someone would catch a ""blue walleye"". Faith, Family, Friends.......and Fishing. Rich B"
560263,phishfearme,2006-08-11 21:38:00,1242,correction - those walleyes are black and gold - obviously steeler fans!! - phish
560270,Guest,2006-08-12 10:15:00,0,They are always white like that when the lake is closed. ;)
560271,Guest,2006-08-12 10:43:00,0,"There is a lake NW of Ear Falls that has these blue walleyes. The lake is the site of an abandoned gold mine and I was told that the minerals in the water can give the fish a different hue. These walleyes are a beautiful shade of blue. We've caught several. The lake is off of the Joyce Lake road. You can drive right to it now. Before it used to be a lake you had to take a quad into. Carr Lake, near Bathurst Lake. It's a very small lake, nothing big in terms of size of fish. Take one of these Blue Walleye and compare it to a Red River Greenback and you wouldn't think they are the same fish."
560273,Guest,2006-08-12 11:23:00,0,"Just returned from Lac Seul and our group caught two ""blues""-my wife caught a 22"" and my brother-in-law a 26"".Snapped some pictures of both and put 'em back. We also caught a blue several years ago on a trip to Eagle Lake (we actually got through the creek that goes back to Bottle Lake and caught it back there). The Blue Walleye from what I hear is uncommon but there is an effort to make them moreso. They are very pretty, to say the least."
560275,Guest,2006-08-12 12:35:00,0,You caught a walleye west of the divide in Alberta? Wouldn't that be BC? If a walleye has been in very low light for an extended period of time the will become very light colored. Deep and/or muddy water can do this. Perhaps you caught an albino.
