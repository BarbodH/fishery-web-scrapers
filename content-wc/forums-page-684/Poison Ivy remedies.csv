559923,Guest,2006-08-01 20:47:00,0,calamine lotion i tried everything else
559927,Guest,2006-08-01 21:21:00,0,"Try using Zanfel. It is over the counter and seems to work very well, especially if you use it right away. It is supposed to wash away the molecule that causes the skin reaction, which is a first. It`s a bit pricey though. The best thing to do is wash the area well that was exposed and make sure you clean everything that may have come in contact with the poison ivy, including clothes, tools, dog, etc. Lazyk"
559950,Guest,2006-08-02 10:43:00,0,"If you know you have come in contact with it within the last hour or so. then take a bar of Fels Naptha soap. Put a little water on it and rub it to make a paste, then apply the past to the infected area and rub it around for a while. If possible leave it on for a few hours. I had contact on my face and did this and only had a small rash that lasted for a day or so, and never really itched, just scabbed over."
559952,Cooker,2006-08-02 12:12:00,164,I tried everyting with limited results until a Dr prescribed Temovate for me about 10 years ago. Best stuff ever. Had a severe case early this spring. Swelling was probably a 1/4 inch. It was dried up and gone in 3- 4 days.

560090,Jig A Lowe,2006-08-08 07:11:00,87,">What is the most effective treatment for poison ivy that you >have found? I just had a horrendous case of poison ivy. In fact, while I contracted it here in PA, it surfaced two days later in Canada. I was in misery. Long story short, poison ivy must be cured from ""the inside out"". A heavy dose of Prednisone is the best cure. My dermatologist prescribed 60 mg. the first two days, then 50 mg. the 3rd & 4th days, then 40 mg. the 5th & 6th day, and so forth. You must be weaned gradually from Prednisone as an abrupt stopping of the meds may cause the rash to resurface. With this regimen, you will notice a significant difference in the itching and swelling and redness with 24-48 hrs. My dermatologist said that you can apply whatever topical substances you like but only Prednisone will be give you the cure. DO NOT HESITATE, all a dermatologist IMMEDIATELY. DO NOT SUFFER UNNECESARILY."

560235,Guest,2006-08-11 01:55:00,0,Believe it or not. Pick some wild rubarb. Squeeze out the juices and rub on the poison ivy area. It will be gone in a matter of days. Worked for a few friends of mine several times.
