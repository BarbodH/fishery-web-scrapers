559920,Prime_Focus,2006-08-01 20:04:00,1,We'll be at Evergreen next week also. It's our first time on Lac Seul so we're not sure what to expect. Maybe we'll see you there. I'll be the old grey bearded tired looking guy from Iowa who walks with a slight limp. :)

560196,Guest,2006-08-10 10:19:00,0,Heading to Gold Pines tomorrow. Any updates? Any hints any where to fish at this time and what baits? Don't have a big boat so don't want to go as far as Mc Kensie Bay. Thanks
