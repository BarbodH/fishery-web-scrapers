560214,Guest,2006-08-10 16:02:00,0,"yes, latte helps too"
560084,Skyraptor,2006-08-07 21:45:00,291,">Don't even think of using 502. The south half of the highway >is shot, needs major repair and repaving. I just came back via >71. It will take you about 35-40 minutes longer, plus you can >stop for ice cream in Sioux Narrows. Just came back from the Sioux Lookout area and took 502 on the way up and the way back and shook my head when I thought of the people who stated that 502 was shot, needs major repair and repaving. some people don't realize what a bad road is. There are a few rough spots that are patched over but the road is very good for travelling. People need to experience a road in inner chicago to know what a road needing repair is. Heck hwy 53 in Minnesotat is in worst shape."
560085,Guest,2006-08-07 21:59:00,0,"went to canada twice this year, first time we took 502 up and back. second time we took 502 up and 71 back. i tell ya 71 is a much better highway if you will be pulling any type of boat or trailer up its smoother and i believe it might be flatter (less hills) more towns yes but something to look at besides a rock and pine cone. 71 is a lot easier on the equipment and only takes about 30 mins. longer than 502"
560096,Mohleye,2006-08-08 08:55:00,368,"I agree. In July we took both routes. 502 is faster, but if you're pulling a boat, which I was, 71 is the way to go."
560109,Whitewater,2006-08-08 15:28:00,6,"I agree with Skyraptor. There is nothing wrong with 502. You just need to slow down abit in some places. You should have seen this road 10 years ago. Then you would have been right to complain. I have a 15 hour drive to my camp, so I am not going to add another 1/2 hour or 45 minutes by using 71."
560110,Mohleye,2006-08-08 15:52:00,368,"This year was my 27th trip, so I've certainly seen 502 in worse shape. I'll stick with what I said earlier. If you're not trailering, take 502. If you're pulling a boat, 71 will be a lot less wear and tear, plus there are a lot of flat stretches. If you get behind a slowpoke on 502 and you're pulling a boat, you have a heck of a time finding a place to pass safely."
560146,Guest,2006-08-09 11:10:00,0,Sure hope all of you use Highway 71 especially those of you who tend to drive slower than most traffic. that will take a lot of traffic off the 502 when I go through and make it a lot more comfortable for me to travel. Thank you so much
560148,Hump,2006-08-09 11:18:00,578,"I think you should all use 502. Hwy 71 doesn't need the stress of more vehicles. The scenery is so much better and the wildlife is great to see. I wouldn't even consider 71, too many lonely stretches of Hwy and too many towns. Stick to 502"
560163,Guest,2006-08-09 15:09:00,0,"If everyone is going to take 502 north, who is gonna be around to eat the mooseburgers and ice cream at Sioux Narrows? 502 is 112 miles of brush, no thank you."
560171,2746,2006-08-09 17:32:00,3206,"I go up to Red Lake three times a year and pull an 18' boat. For a change in scenery I've started taking 502 up and 71 back. the 30 minutes is about right for the time difference and yes, 71 is much smoother. Don't know where your from but if it's south or west of International Falls you could even consider crosssing at Baudette if you take 71 as there is almost no wait there. We travel SE back to the Twin Cities and figure the total trip aout an hour plus longer but no wait at the border."
560202,Guest,2006-08-10 13:25:00,0,"JUST CAME DOWN 502 LAST SATURDAY. I FELT GOING UP THE ROAD WASN'T TO BAD COMING BACK IT WAS ALOT ROUGHER BUT THE POOR SECTION IS ONLY ABOUT THIRTY MILES LONG AND IT HELPS ALOT IF YOU JUST SLOW DOWN, EVEN IF ITS ONLY TO THE POSTED 80 KPH. HOPE YOU ENJOY YOUR TRIP. THE REST OF 502 IS A VERY NICE DRIVE."
