560168,5richards,2006-08-09 17:17:00,131,Did you have to pay for gas at Birch point lodge? There was no charge at anglers kingdom.
560181,Guest,2006-08-09 23:09:00,0,"Yes you do have to pay for gas, but the camp price is lower. We had 11 guys this year and about a $700 gas bill for the week. So it was around $65 a head. The camp switched over to fuel injected 25hp motors this year. They were pretty fuel effecient. They were also suprisingly fast. It made East Bay seemed closer. But then again, it could have been the fact that we had nice weather and not 40's with sideways rain like our previous years. I've been at the Nunguesser lodge several years ago. It was a nice camp, but the thing I didn't like was the fact that you couldn't fish the day you get there. At birchpoint we are on the water by 2 PM on the 'In' day and get 8-9 hours of fishing in. I always attributed this to the fact that we were paying for our gas so there is no extra expense to the camp to let us fish. Whatever the reason, the extra day is nice. Plus, there isn't a curfew on getting in at night. We have some night fisherman some years. Never been to Anglers Kingdom, but their boats do look nice, plus a good location on the lake. The boats we get are all 16ft Lund row boats with seats and floors. No frills, but are functional. Standard camp boats. It would be really nice if all the camps pitched in the get a cell reciever on the huge microwave antenna in the West bay. Several people in my group find it difficult to not have easy communication for work. I've even had some people not go for this reason."
560183,gombater,2006-08-10 05:51:00,3,"My group has been staying at Nungesser Lake lodge every year. From a cost basis, they are the cheapest, comparing housekeeping plans from the three boat-in camps on the lake. Boats are not as nice as angler kingdom, nor do they have internet access, but the staff are excellent. Gas is included in their rates. Use 16' and 18' basic Lunds with new 25hp mercs. Not being able to go out on the first day never really bothered our group. Every year one or two guys in our group would take the bear hunting option, which is always interesting. While there is no cellphone service on the lake, the 'party line' works just fine from the owner's cabin in camp. Another nice part is we don't have to portage the river to get in. I like Angler Kingdoms' new boats, but their package rates reflect this, being the most expensive of the three.http://www.anglerskingdom.com/index.htmlhttp://www.birchpointcamp.com/html/nungesser_lake.htmlhttp://www.nungesserlake.com/"
560219,5richards,2006-08-10 17:18:00,131,Anglers Kingdom has new 40 hp motors for the fisherman - we arrived in red lake on friday night and were met at the landing at 8am on Saturday and were on the water before noon on our first day - several in our group used the satelite phone every other day there were no restrictions- internet was readily available - I am not a relative! just stating the facts - could there be some improvement - ya but then (and it's coming} you'll pay more for it.
560220,gombater,2006-08-10 17:46:00,3,"5Richards, I think that if the added features are worth the extra cost to a person then the relative cost probably isn't an issue. I like this thread because it gives an opportunity to compare the three boat-in camps on Nungesser from people who have actually been there. Angler Kingdom's 40 hp Hondas are certianly a nice feature. We typically are not into camp until 1 or 2 pm on Friday, and we are typically following the last group out from the previous week, being the first one in for the new week."
560232,Guest,2006-08-10 23:34:00,0,"Putting camps aside, What are everyone favorite areas and time of year to fish Nungesser? My group typically goes mid-June with the exception of this year where we went late July. The weather was nice in July, but we thought the size of the fish were smaller. Higher overall numbers though. We switched back to June for next year. My personal favorite is in the mid lake where Gull rock is. That whole area seems to have deeper water and bigger, more consistant, fish. We go to East bay every year, but more for a scenery change. North and South bay always seem to be hit or miss. I dig using spinner rigs w/ a minnow, but if the fish are shallow, Rapalas seem to do well. Obviously, we jig also. My group rarely goes after big northern specifically. Any tips other then walleye tactics. I always thought about trolling musky lures, but never seem to get around to doing it. It seems that some years we will really nail the big northern while walleye fishing, other years they are just hammerhandles. We typically have 4-5 boats, and this is always the trend. I always figuired that the big northern should always be near the walleye, but maybe certain times of the year other food is prefered. Whitefish? Thoughts?"
560240,5richards,2006-08-11 08:42:00,131,"We preferred the eastern portion of the lake, and were mostly interested in pike. walleye's were a fun diversion. since it was our first trip to Nungesser we tried various lures but seemed to have the best success trolling and plugging with spoons. Silver belly seemed to work best all day long. We also caught quite a few Walleye in this same fashion. As to time, we will attempt to go up earlier in the year next year. good fishing to all!"
559628,susie-q,2006-07-21 09:08:00,2,Anybody had luck fishing Nungesser in Ontario?
559633,5richards,2006-07-22 09:17:00,131,I'll be there oon July 28th at Anglers Kingdom and will let you know how we did!
560073,5richards,2006-08-07 16:55:00,131,Just got back from Nungesser and had good luck on Walleye all day long - pike were in the deeper water but we still caught them including a 41 inch pike @20 lbs. Stayed at Anglers Kingdom.
560094,Guest,2006-08-08 07:46:00,0,"5richards, How was the camp and did you do the american plan? Thanks for any info. JohnL."
560102,Guest,2006-08-08 11:02:00,0,"We were there a couple weeks ago at Birchpoint Camp. The walleye were deep, mostly 20-30 ft down. Most of the fish were smaller then our normal week in June, but the numbers were good. Lots of 17 inchers, and a few 24+. Bigger fish seemed to pick-up towards the end of the week. Other then the occasional Northern going after a walleye, we didn't see many big Pike. Lots of small pike in the weeds, fun to go after in the middle of the day. Gull Rock was the hot bite this year, but appearently the the whole lake new about it. It seemed like more boats were on the lake this year, most likely due to the new camp. Not an issue though, it's a big lake. I could go for another week!"
560115,5richards,2006-08-08 18:10:00,131,We did the american plan- there were seven of us and with that you get varied tastes which the cook[who was a sweetheart and very good natured- named Diane] tried to satisify. Depending on what you expect - the food is fine - I would recommend supplementing with your own canned goods to satisfy the more fussy eaters. This camp has superior boats and motors compared to what I saw from other outfitters on the lake - 40 hp hondas with electric start - lowrance depth finders and live wells - check the others if it makes a difference to you - it did to us. Kevin and the staff were very accomodating with respect to putting you on fish - walleye -no problem- pike - our largest was 41 inches and @ 20 lbs - email me for more info and I'll give you a # to call
560138,2746,2006-08-09 09:17:00,3206,"KROK, your post brings back old memories. It's been 15 years since I've been at Birch Point on Nungesser. Went annully for several years there. Are George and Connie still running the camp or has it changed hands. Had a lot of good time there and still remember the boat trip up the river to camp. Have been fishing Gull Rock the past several years and your right about the number of boats ..... considering Lac Suel next year for that reason."
560144,Guest,2006-08-09 10:41:00,0,"5richards, Thanks for the information. It was exactly what I was looking for. John."
560150,Guest,2006-08-09 11:45:00,0,"Roy, George's son, runs the camp now. Connie is also there. We've been going to BirchPoint for around 10 years now and have always done well. Roy, got all new Yamaha's this year and replaced his old 25hp river motors with 90HP's. It was a rush going down the river at 40 mph! Cut back on the commute time significantly."
560151,2746,2006-08-09 12:02:00,3206,"Yes, I remember Roy. He was helping his folks when we last went. The 90's would help the trip but expect the portage is still there. Any escalators yet? We get up to Gullrock 3 times a year now that we are retired but think I'll visit Nungesser again next year for old times. Believe I still remmber the points and weed beds we used to fish and I know I remember the times we got caught in the high winds and George's 14' boats and 15 hp motors. The Yamaha's would be nice!"
