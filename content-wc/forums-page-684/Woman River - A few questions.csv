Does anyone have experience on any of these lakes? Is the fishing better in certain sections of the chain than others? Portage lakes? Don't need specific spots, but any helpful advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!"

I've fished the other end of the chain for many years. If you want some info on some of the portage lakes, email me at [email protected]."
