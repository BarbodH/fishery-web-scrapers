560343,Guest,2006-08-15 15:10:00,0,August can be very good on Lac Seul. The fish are in a deep summer pattern and starting to become very active in anticipation of the fall forage. I would go to Lost Island Lodge and hire Basil as a guide. He knows the spots and will put you on fish. Where do you go now. If they have guides get one.
560344,Guest,2006-08-15 15:39:00,0,been staying in the ear falls lodges and am thinking about moving further down the lake since we always end up in steamboat and/or mckenzie.
560345,Guest,2006-08-15 15:41:00,0,Give Lost Island and Basil a shot.
