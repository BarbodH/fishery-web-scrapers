560228,Guest,2006-08-10 20:35:00,0,"Mahkwa has guides and their prices are fair. You will need 3/8 to 1/2 jigs and we have luck on all three baits with minnows leading the way.. Worm harnesses work well too. I have had good luck with Berkley plastics like the 3"" grubs and the scented. Hope this helps. Doesn't hurt to have a few packages. Good Luck and Good Fishin'"
