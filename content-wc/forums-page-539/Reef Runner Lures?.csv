1200564,rps,2010-05-14 20:42:00,401,I haven't fished that far North since I was a boy. Down here in the Ozarks the Reef Runners work very well on Bull Shoals and Table Rock.
1200580,polaris-pete,2010-05-14 22:16:00,343,can't go wrong with any of the reef runners. They work excellent on Erie for the eyes.We use all sizes and they have some outstanding colors to.
