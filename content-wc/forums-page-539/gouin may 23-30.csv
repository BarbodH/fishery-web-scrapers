1199737,duffitdad,2010-05-12 16:23:00,21,Hello all! - I am taking my boys on their first trip to canada into gouin reservoir last week of may. Any thoughts on baits for pike/walleye and locations would be appreciated. I am thinking ice out was earlier than usual this year?? Fish might be deeper?? A few guys here have been a big help any other thoughts greatly appreciated. Also I wont ask the potatoe question on going into canada but I was wondering on bringing worms in for the walleyes?? Anyone have any experience with that? thanks a lot - Rich
