I've done some searches and have found some favorable posts, but not much specifically to Keeper River outpost. Any info would be appreciated."
1166156,ole timer,2010-02-04 15:49:00,34,"train,My friend and I fished Keeper River two years ago in Sept. The main lake area was not that great; the portage lake beyond the falls was better. We fished for walleye only, so can't comment on the pike. Did catch a lake trout, tho. Didn't know they were in there. Fished Keeper Lake last year. Tons of walleye there. Going to try Miller this year. Peter runs a top-notch operation. Cabins and boats are great. Don't know how he does it at that price. Be glad to answer any questions you may have.ot"
