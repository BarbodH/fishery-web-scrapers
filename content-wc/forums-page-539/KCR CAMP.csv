518971,Guest,2002-04-06 09:19:00,0,"There is no running water in the cabins, and it is about 500 yards from one of the worst first Nations reserves in north western ontario and all the guides are from the res. so you never really know if they are going to show or not. But it it's in your price range have fun!"

FOR MOST OF THE 18 YEARS IT WAS ANENJOYABLE EXPERIENCE. GOT TO THE POINT HE THOUGHT HE WASDOING US A FAVOR BY LETTING US SPEND OUR BUCKS THERE. EVERRUN OUT OF TOILET PAPER? MINNOWS ON TUESDAY? ONLY AT KCR.WE WERE ABLE TO HANDLE THOSE SETBACKS. THE KICKER WAS WE WERE PROMISED (AND MADE A DEPOSIT ON) ONE CABIN AND UPON ARRIVAL,ASSIGNED ANOTHER. ONE MEMBER OF OUR GROUP HAD TO SLEEP IN THEKITCHEN/SOCIAL ROOM. HIS REPLY TO OUR COMPLAINT WAS ""IF YOUDON'T LIKE IT DON'T COME BACK. WE WERE ONE OF THE LAST GROUPS JUMP SHIP. IF THEY EVER SELL I'M GOING BACK."
518973,Guest,2002-05-04 10:28:00,0,"Our group goes every 2 years, have been up there 5 times now. If you are looking for someone to put you on fish and have 5 star accomodations look elsewhere. Fact is, we have a large group, most of us can find our own fish easily enough, and have minimal contact with any of the management. The wife is pretty nice, but he guy can be a real rearend sometimes. We stick to ourselves. The guides are useless, by day two they are following us around. Price is great, the fish are there, it all depends what you are looking for. We see the boats come down from Minaki most everyday, so we are fishinghte same water for about $300 less per man."
518974,Guest,2002-05-21 19:11:00,0,"Leaving June 8th for 3rd trip to KCR. Fishing has been great, management fine, our cabin was brand new with running water and clean as a whistle. Management is working hard to build all new cabins. Never ran out of toliet paper or minnows (used LOTS of minnows). Guides worked hard for us. Next time you guys have a problem with the guides, try tipping them. They work hard for your tips. We caught lots of fish, ate well for shore lunch every day, and brought back some nice Walleye for a fish fry back in Missouri."
518975,Guest,2002-05-23 06:49:00,0,"I must agree, guides work hard and I must also agree that some guides don't know what they are doing etc. guide from Newfoundland, or an american wannbe trying to fish canadian waters. If you jump in the boat and the guide had 4 or 5 baits sitting beside hin wal-mart special rod maybe you should ask if there are any other guides or tell the owner that if you don't catch a certain amout of fish that you'll want a new one for the next day. But if you get inthe boat and the back is filled with the guides gear, be ready for some fine fishing."
1200619,Guest,2010-05-15 07:40:00,0,I noticed a lot of old posts about KCR camp. I have been going there at least 20+ years. Why? the price is right the fishing is good the camp is clean and neat the guides work hard and do a fine job. Management is fine. they run a tight ship they offer excellent boats and motors and been in business for many years. many repeat customers. Like i said Good Fishing. cabins have been remodeled and all have great views..i will be going back in 3 weeks......ok my only complaint is that at times water level is high and fishing is only good instead of great!!
