1154285,mike0212,2009-12-15 01:29:00,5,top notch operation. take a look at this link for a trip report. report is from 2 seasons ago. had friends that went back this spring and had simular results.http://www.fish-hawk.net/hawktalk/vi...975&highlight= M
1154622,celticbass1,2009-12-16 19:02:00,67,"I have to agree with Mike. The place is absolutely top notch for fishing. If you can get in to Lake Wanzatika, it's hard to beat. 4 of us caught and released over 1100 fish in a week. No real huge fish but the numbers were certainly there. We were there about 5 years ago and the cabins could have used some work but the folks running the place are very friendly and the equipment was very nice."
1173435,Trail7268,2010-03-01 18:59:00,4,"Parts of my group have been Flying with Hearst air to George's lakes since 1977 when he bought the company. I personally am on my fifth season. After many dissapointing outings with inferior outfitters, Hearst Air is a breath of fresh air. The fishing is outstanding on all three lakes that I have been to. (Martison, McLeister and Wanzatika). All verticle log cabing with wood stove for heat, propane powered fridge, stove, lights and BBQ. even new comfortable mattresses. The boats are almost all new 14 foot lunds with very reliable 6 horse Merc's.Using Live minnows on Jigs with a 3"" grub(white,chartruse, or my fovorite chart w red tail, can catch walleye all day. Troll for big Walleye ( 7.6lb trip record) and big pike (20.2lb) troll slowly along shorlines with Rapala X Raps or Med size 3-4"" spoons. Staff is fantastic. All of the pilots including Georges son, Michael, who flies the Turbo Otter are Excellent. They added a new Turbo Beaver to the Fleet Last year. There is a check up Flight mid week on Wednesdays. And if you rent the Sat Phone from them you can call the base and for a Min charge they will bring in more supplies if needed ie: ice beer (toilet paper very important).All in all Worth every penny.Any questions do not hesitate to ask.Cheers"
1173660,Guest,2010-03-02 11:21:00,0,Flown with them three times and had great trips each time. Service is great along with camps. You should not be disappointed.
1174930,Moosebunk,2010-03-05 19:50:00,211,Mike posted my link... lol. So methinks you get my point.I've only heard great things about all their lakes and rivers. Their two premier trips are Pym (pike and walleye) and Sutton (specks). Not often being one for numbers but instead size... Pym didn't disappoint. Living in Northern Ontario for 10 years and having fished all over... Attawapiskat was an excellent 1-2 punch for big pike and big eyes. And... probably 80 miles of river to fish and some backlakes as well. Big water. They tell me Napken is another good option too.

Fishing was very good both for pike and walleye.We caught lots of eyes trolling Rapalas right in front of camp.Lots of water,cabin was very nice and boats were fine.All around it was a very good trip.Also the manager,I think her name is Melaney ,is quite beautiful. Good Fishing Pikeman"
