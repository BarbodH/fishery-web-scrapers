1200325,Terwalleye,2010-05-14 02:16:00,166,No but another case of Blue bought with it will. and that's a lot more than $.02 worth.
1200369,Obabikon,2010-05-14 07:08:00,2370,"However, if you end up taking that guide, you'll get 6.5% back. Which will actually make it quite a bit less."
1200423,teddi,2010-05-14 10:13:00,349,"no matter which way you look at it, it,s going to cost more up front. if the paper work is filled out you can get a rebate on some things, not every thing you buy same as before. it is going to make life a little bit tougher for the camps in ontario as manitoba does not have the tax as yet."
1199949,teddi,2010-05-13 06:15:00,349,on july 1 the new tax goes into effect in ontario. it will mean an increase in the price of most every thing in the province. this is for ontario and bc only[not manitoba]. this will reflect on your final bill at all camps and the camp owners have no control over it. just a heads up on what to expect.
1199994,Obabikon,2010-05-13 07:56:00,2370,"Teddi, That's not necissarily true. The new ""HST"" tax is 13%. This is the only tax that people will be paying. The previous tax rates were 8% for PST and 5% for GST. There's very little difference. HOWEVER, the good thing is that the ""rebate"" will now be half of the 13% instead of half of the 5%. There are a few ways to qualify for the rebate, but you basically need to use certain ""services"". Also, you trip must be a ""package""... which means everything included in one lump price. Services include: transportation, guide, interpreter, sightseeing excursions, and ski lessons"
1199995,Obabikon,2010-05-13 08:00:00,2370,"You will have to pay taxes on things that were previously exempt however. From what I understand, Guides and other previously untaxed services will now be taxed."
1200043,teddi,2010-05-13 09:32:00,349,there are a lot of things that are now going to be taxed at 13%. as you said guides and other services. also the price of gas is going to be taxed as well at 13% instead of 5%.

1200074,Mark R,2010-05-13 10:18:00,1538,yeah but you get free health care
1200078,Wade B AKA: Ruger2506,2010-05-13 10:31:00,5533,Ever heard of cash? That's why we pay our guide and defiantly tips in cash. Just like the IRS. What they don't know won't hurt them.
1200083,JayM5209,2010-05-13 10:58:00,1050,"But, using cash does not excuse one from a legal obligation. The ability to get away with something does not make it right. Figuring out a way to avoid a little bit of tax isn't going to enhance the enjoyment of my trips to Ontario.Just my $.02 worth."
1200124,Freytown,2010-05-13 12:54:00,770,"If that was only true. Health care is paid for one way or the other...that's what the HST is all about. At 13%, what does one pay over their life time??? Answer = $$$ LOTS $$$"
1200144,jigman2003,2010-05-13 13:42:00,15,"Sure that's true. Of course the 13K annual policy I have adds up pretty quick too. Back in 1995 when I started getting the policy it was around 5500 - actually had better, more inclusive care then too. So at that rate, in another 15 years the same policy I have now (and most likely it will cover even less) will cost over 31K. Something had better change or we'll all be working just for health care insurance.To compare costs, I'd have to buy 100,000 worth of stuff taxed at 13% to equal what I'm paying. Man, I wish I made that kind of money.............................."
