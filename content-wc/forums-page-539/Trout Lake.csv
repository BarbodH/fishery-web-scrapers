1159932,evhawkeye,2010-01-13 10:32:00,7,Our group is heading to Trout Lake and staying at Boois later this summer. This is our first trip to this lake and were wondering if we could get any pointers on fishing it and tackle to take along. I have read these board for along time and thought I would make a post. Everybody seems very knowledgeable and helpful. Thanks for you help in advance.

1159986,evhawkeye,2010-01-13 15:31:00,7,"We are going the end of July. We would like to fish for walleye, pike, and trout. We will target walleye the hardest though. Thanks for your help."

I know several people locally who have been to Booi's, and they have good things to say about the camp and the fishing. Are you experienced fishermen looking for tips on this particular lake? I can't help you there, but the walleye fishing should be similar to summer fishing on other lakes in NW Ontario...structure related, in other words. The trout will be pretty deep in mid-July. The people running the camp should be able to help you with depth, locations, and methods. Hiring a guide for a day might be a good bet."

The fishing is fantastic there we caught lots of lakers, walleyes and northern. We went mainly the last week of may onto the first 2 weeks of june so the lakers were up and the fishing was mainly in bays and channels."

The last time we fished end of July fish were 15-25 feet down outside of places with weeds. The Booi's will tell you where to go for the walleyes. For trout, invest in mini downriggers and spoons. I haven't fished for them in July but sometimes in late june we are already fishing 20 feet down in 40 feet near the lodge."
1199795,Guest,2010-05-12 18:35:00,0,July is a good time of year and probably the best for trout and big walleye. Get a set of down riggers and a fish finder. You need a few light spoons and look for 80 to 100 feet around tom and donna's point. When it is flat calm and hot is the best time to be out there. Walleye just some jigs and worms or leeches work great. Nice thing about this time of year don't have to go far from the lodge to catch fish.
