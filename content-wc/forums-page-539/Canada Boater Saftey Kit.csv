1199132,IowaDave,2010-05-11 09:07:00,69,"I know I've seen a list of things that you have to have on your boat when in Canada waters, but after a site search & going through 7 pages of posts, I can't seem to find it. I wasn't able to find what I needed in a Google search either. Could someone either post the list or provide a link that has a nice short & sweet list of things that you need to have aboard, please? Just want to update my checklist before we head up!"
1199137,ohiojmj,2010-05-11 09:21:00,1262,"My recollection is everything required in Ohio, plus paddles. Lights, horn/whistle, PFD's, flag/flares, rope, anchor. This may not be a perfect list, but thought it was worth mentioning the paddles."
1199147,Sutsgold,2010-05-11 09:47:00,219,"I will add that I believe the rope needs to be 50 feet long, and you also need something to bail water."

Found it on the Transport Canada web site at http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/marinesafety...ess6m-1791.htmNote that there are two (2) 50' line requirements. One is the anchor line and the other is a bouyant heaving line. For the latter, I bought a cheap 3/8"" polypropylene rope and tied it to a dog training dummy to give some weight for tossing."
1199572,Walley Guide,2010-05-12 09:55:00,67,"Here is a copy of the requirements I have followed for some years. I have been checked, never been a problem of any kind. If bringing your own boat it must meet the requirements you follow in the US. If renting/borrowing a boat registered in Canada the requirements must meet Canadian requirements. Hope this helps. (copied the link at the bottom if you want to take a look.) Happy Fishin' Walley ""Safety Equipment Requirements Foreign pleasure craft (pleasure craft that are licensed or registered in a country other than Canada) need to comply with equipment requirements of the country in which the vessel is usually kept. If you are not a resident of Canada and are using a pleasure craft licensed or registered in Canada, all of the required safety equipment must meet Canadian safety requirements. However, you may opt to bring your own PFD for your own personal use.""http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/marinesafety...tor-1610.htm#c"
1199752,brn2fsh,2010-05-12 17:02:00,49,"Dave, I think I saw you were going up to Dryden? If so, they sell boater safety kits at the wal-mart up there for 20.00, minus the extra oar. Rob"
1199811,IowaDave,2010-05-12 19:05:00,69,"Thanks for all the info guys!!It looks like we've got all but 1 thing so we should be good after we get that. Like I said, just wanted to be sure and now we know!"
1199996,Jimmy Jig,2010-05-13 08:00:00,1905,I believe that if you are from the USA and have the state required equipment that is all that is needed..... People from Canada do have a much longer list. At least that was correct last year.
1200054,JayM5209,2010-05-13 09:51:00,1050,"Jimmy, you are correct. However, when I looked at the list of items required in Canada, I discovered that there isn't a single thing on that list above and beyond what is found in any safely equipped boat, regardless of where it's registered."
