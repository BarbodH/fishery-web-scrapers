From monster Brookies, Raindow, Lakers, Walleye and Pike as just a few. The abundance of lakes is a fishermans dream, the hardest part is deciding which one to fish."
1199490,CrossinEYES,2010-05-12 06:34:00,139,Been to Reed many many times< heading to Tramping in 3 weeks to try it out! will be there a week and want to find some Lakers! ANY Ideas or tips are greatly appreciated!! MANITOBA is AMAZING!!!! FISH ON!!! Dale Frerichs Jr.
1199880,Bill Krejca,2010-05-12 20:55:00,6107,"Dale, Say hello to Tony and Sue, if you are staying at the falls. Tony will help you get on the fish. Let us know how you do. Bill Krejca"
1200740,Bigfishhunter,2010-05-15 19:10:00,803,"I don't think Tony is there anymore, I heard he sold it, and there are new owners. Rumours, but I am inclined to believe the sources, too bad, they were great there, Tony could easily get you on the fish."
1198119,Guest,2010-05-08 12:29:00,0,"Knee Lake, Manitoba Northstar Resort- Best fishing you will ever find, last year I caught 9 trophies (over 41 inches) in 4 days, with over 200 pike total for the trip. Cant wait to get back this June..."
1198241,gapr,2010-05-08 20:09:00,192,"i will be on athapap in one month, it is one of my favorite trips of the year. Vegas, Athapap or Tobin it just doesn't get any better does it."
1198485,LoDo,2010-05-09 17:39:00,721,"Ive fished Jan Lake in Sask and drove through most of Manitoba. Grand Fork, ND to Flin Flon and west to Jan Lake. Jan Lake lodge is hands down the nicest fishing resort Ive ever been too. Not only the best lodge, but also the best Canadian resort website too:http://janlakelodge.ca/"
1198547,sptrix,2010-05-09 20:50:00,175,"I'll be in the Lynn Lake area in a little less than 7 weeks. Can't wait, but am very interested to see how the early spring affects the fishing. Last year I got there on June 25 and the ice had just gone off the lake on the 20th. This year the ice went out a week ago."
1198871,ret-ro,2010-05-10 16:37:00,41,"I'd like to hear of suggested drive in lodges in MB. I am also a visitor of Ontario, but I enjoy new adventures."
1198952,jWN,2010-05-10 20:04:00,62,"I've been to both provinces but have always had better luck in Manitoba by far. Fished Reed 8 to 10 times, been to Vanderkerchoven 3 times and sevral other lakes. This year it's the wife and mine 10th aniversary so she's making me take her to Big Sand Lake Lodge. I'm sure there is excelant fishing in Ont. but I was just never on that trip I guess. I have had 4 trips to Manitoba that alot just wouldn't beleave the numbers we caught. But the best trip I ever had was to Riendeer Lake we honistly caught hundreds of walleye a day for days on end."
1198959,Bill Krejca,2010-05-10 20:24:00,6107,"We went a number of times to Wekusko Falls Lodge near the town of Snow Lake. The lodge is located down river a mile from Tramping Lake. The lake has many Master Angler Awards for walleye. It also has some large pike, and some trout. I believe the best year, out of our 8 people, 6 got a 28"" or larger walleye, to receive the award. www.wekuskofallslodge.com Bill Krejca"
1198970,sptrix,2010-05-10 20:40:00,175,"Depends what you like to fish for, but we've been very happy at Paradise Lodge on Lake Athapapuskow, near Flin Flon, MB. It's a terrific pike and trout lake, and there are some MONSTER 'eyes in the lake, but it's not a numbers lake, in my experience. There are several lakes in the immediate area that can provide better walleye fishing, but if you like big trout, then Athapap is as good as it gets."
1199149,ret-ro,2010-05-11 09:53:00,41,"My preferred fish is Walleyes-in numbers plus some sizable, but I also enjoy the smallies, Lakers, & Pike.I guess that's why I enjoy the area I fish on the English river in Ontario so much. Lots of variety with the right water levels. Man I can't wait to get back up there in June."
1199297,ret-ro,2010-05-11 15:41:00,41,Wow I looked up Knee Lake. I'll have to save up a couple years to go there!
1197603,Bigfishhunter,2010-05-07 07:04:00,803,"There is all this talk of Ontario fishing, which is great to hear about, but who is heading to Northern Manitoba this year? I live up here and have a great deal of contacts and first hand experience with a majority of the drive in lakes, which are top notch by the way. I also worked in the Fly-in business for 7 years first as a guide then as a camp manager for a couple of outfits. There are some great ones for sure. So why not share with us if you are coming up to Northern Manitoba, if you have been before, any questions, etc. etc."
1197617,LeeMB,2010-05-07 07:27:00,83,I believe there is less people coming to northern Manitoba this year than last year. Certainly at my camp its true.
1197695,Bill Krejca,2010-05-07 10:31:00,6107,"Many happy experiences at Tramping Lake near Snow Lake, and, earlier, Mirond Lake in Sask, just not going this year. O'Sullivan Lake in July, and LOW in Sep. Bill Krejca"
1197712,camp chef,2010-05-07 10:50:00,915,I have never fished Manitoba. We have a 12 hour drive to Minaki or a few more to Nungesser. The fishing and prices would have to be pretty spectacular to get me to drive much farther. The old body can't take it like it used to.
1197741,Bigfishhunter,2010-05-07 11:26:00,803,"I definitely get why people do go to Ontario due to it's rich resources and close proximity for a lot of people. I guess I was just curious and thought I would open it up for anyone who might be considering coming to ask questions etc. Or maybe just to tell us where you go and why. Manitoba has lot's to offer if you are looking for a change. Saskatchewan too, for that matter."
1197796,bigtimeelectric,2010-05-07 14:04:00,174,"Absolutely, manitoba is great I've been to a few flyouts and drove into cross bay 4 times. We love it now we go to lac seul, ontario mainly because its closer. I am hoping to make it back to manitoba this summer. And yes there is very few posts about mb on WC."
1197805,5richards,2010-05-07 14:55:00,131,"I hale from Pennsylvania so any trip is a large endeavor -- I have to fly for a portion of the trip so name a flight destination in Manitoba with camps in a reasonable distance and I'll ""check 'em out"" Thanks! By the way I too am happy with my trips to NW Ontario!!!!!"
1197816,Dacotah Eye,2010-05-07 15:25:00,2722,"I have been going to northern Manitoba for many years and I have gone to Ontario once. I don't know if I will be able to go this fall due to my son's wedding. When I was Manitoba last September, I saw two other boats on the lakes that I fished. Very quiet and relaxing with great fishing. ++++++++++++++++"
1197859,hoosiercanadian,2010-05-07 17:33:00,104,"Hope to make a couple trips to the Lynn Lake area, been going the past 10 years, love it, 1,850 miles one way, 36 hours , 100 miles of gravel, but it is heaven to me."
1197896,MidWestFishman,2010-05-07 19:10:00,44,"I have been to Manitoba lodges in the past. I have been to Neultin, Hasbala and Wolverine Lodge. This year I am going to Egenolf lake. As you probably know, Wolverine is a drive in and the rest are fly-ins. I have always found the fishing in Manitoba to be very good with exception of Neultin but that was not the lake but the guide we had (who told us after 3 days he hated fishing!). I am hoping to do well this year also. With the passing of my dad,my options are now limited on what lodges I can go to. I have to fish solo since I can't find anyone where I live to spend the $ for a Canadian fishing trip I am already planning my 2011 fishing and hope to do a week in Manitoba and one in Ontario.I have made 3 trips to Ontario and they were all good fishing and lodging experiences. Ontario offers excellent value and I have found the fishing there to be more affordable than in Manitoba. It just depends I guess on what you are targeting- I was targeting lake trout and pike and caught my biggest fish in Manitoba but there was a higher price to be paid for that. I think if the American economy doesn't pick up that I will pretty much go to Ontario in the coming years as there seems to be such a huge selection of places to go that offer a good trip at what IMO is a bit more affordable. I also enjoy walleye and smallmouth bass fishing and Ontario is certainly"
