1200786,Knoxabilly,2010-05-16 02:03:00,225,I head up next Friday to Evergreen Lodge on beautiful Lac Seul and would like to hear how the fishing is going. Are they deep already? Any tips and stories are much appreciated! So excited to leave!!1
1200795,teddi,2010-05-16 05:14:00,349,"i would try the mouth of the river,sawmill bay.iron bay or any bay or inlet into lac seul. the weather is supposed to be good all next week, the fishing is always good. i may see you up there next week,going up on tuesday."
1200911,Knoxabilly,2010-05-16 12:23:00,225,I do 95 percent of my fishing in sawmill..where is iron bay? Is that towards mackenzie bay? I've only made that trip 2 times in the 15 years I've been goin. Always had best luck in sawmill
1200912,teddi,2010-05-16 12:28:00,349,"iron bay is about 10 minuites past sawmill on the north side before you get to shanty narrows or bannatyne bay. can be very good fishing if all else fails[which it won,t]"
