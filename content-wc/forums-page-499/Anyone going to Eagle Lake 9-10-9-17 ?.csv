1275972,Danbear,2011-02-27 17:05:00,72,"Thanks for the invite to wing nite, for that I can sit in a different barstool.Should I bring anything ?Dan"
1276004,Guest,2011-02-27 18:31:00,0,eagle lake really bites
1276323,NARDA 1,2011-02-28 16:07:00,636,"You are correct....the bite is really good and will only get better.Also, if you look at the title of this thread I never asked for anyones opinion about the fishing on Eagle. I was simply making an attempt at meeting some new friends. I am sorry that some of you had bad experiences but I have had nothing but great times and memories and I wouldn't think of going anywhere else. TerryDanbear, just bring yourselves."
1276953,boynurse77,2011-03-02 07:01:00,8,We always have a great time at birchdale. I will be there with Danbear and LanceCpl. We have a couple new members this year. Might need a couple new barstools.
1277290,NARDA 1,2011-03-02 18:41:00,636,"Sounds like it's going to be a great week.... if we ever get out of the bar!!! Looking forward to meeting you guys, we should have at least 7 guys this year."
1277300,v-bay gord,2011-03-02 19:10:00,3168,As you already know there is some great walleye action to be had at that time of year....not far from where you are staying! If there is an empty bar stool some night I may disguise myself and drop by. I'll be the one with the yellow beret and riding crop......
1278497,NARDA 1,2011-03-05 17:59:00,636,"Ride on over, I'm sure we can find you an empty stool."
1283375,NARDA 1,2011-03-17 09:35:00,636,"You need to get out of the west arm, your missing alot of great fishing on the rest of the lake and not far from where you are staying either."
1289681,Danbear,2011-04-01 14:13:00,72,4 months and one week to go.The wait is killing me.I will have to catch a few more of these
1289746,NARDA 1,2011-04-01 18:09:00,636,"That would be 161 Days, 13 Hours, 52 Minutes and 40 Seconds give or take. Not to rub it in but we will actually be up there on Thursday 9/8...."
1272996,NARDA 1,2011-02-19 21:39:00,636,"Just curious who else is going to be up there the same time as me. I'll be staying with my group at Birchdale Lodge for my 23rd year. I can't wait.... only 199 days, 10 hrs, 20 minutes and 40 seconds to go."
1273012,walleye88ia,2011-02-20 01:04:00,35,i hope you and your group have a great trip. eagle is the worst lake in ontario i have ever fished. i have found other lakes that are much better. i dont like fishing and seeing 5-30 boats.
1273107,NARDA 1,2011-02-20 09:04:00,636,"One of the reasons we go in September. You must have been fishing on the southern part of Eagle on the main body of the lake, thats the only time I see numbers of boats like that. It's a big lake with lots of places to fish so it's never been a problem for us."
1273129,fishinnut 3446,2011-02-20 09:56:00,638,"Terry,you know I'll be at same lodge 7/2-7/9 I have never seen 30 boats in a day,maybe 28-29 but thats leaving camp and going past Andy Myers camp. Almost every day we are there my son and I don't see a boat for the first 2-3 hrs. But we go out early.Jamie"
1273147,v-bay gord,2011-02-20 10:39:00,3168,"Eagle is a great fishery, lot's of variety and beautiful scenery. It can be a challenge at times, but that's fishing. You can choose to fish with other boats around, or if you want solitude do a little exploring and find other spots to fish...there are plenty of them, not just the popular spots marked on a ""Hots Spots"" map."
1273194,Guest,2011-02-20 12:47:00,0,Eagle Lake Walleye fishing has been getting better & better because of the slot size limit control and the fact that fishermen can only leave Canada with one daily limit of any species of fish. I feel that the Walleye fishing improves each year for me on Eagle Lake. We fish at the other end of the lake (Temple Bay Lodge) & I'll hire a guide to take me to places I have not been to. The new owners at Birchdale Lodge seem to have a very good operation going for them.
1273201,NARDA 1,2011-02-20 13:07:00,636,"Yes, I have seen the improvement in Eagle Lake over the years. It has only gotten better and it was never bad in the first place. I've had years when the fishing was challenging due to weather and what not but I've always caught fish and had a great time and wouldn't think of going elsewhere."
1273406,Jack77,2011-02-21 05:53:00,168,"My experience on Eagle Lake wasn't all that great either. It was tough and slow all week. We spent most of our time on the west arm.I hear a lot of other fisherman talk about just knowing the spots or doing ""good"" on particular Canadian lakes. I can do that in Michigan. Any given day in the spring I can go to the Detroit River, Saginaw River or travel south for a bit and hit the Maumee River and probably catch my limit. I can go to the Saginaw Bay or Lake Erie in the summer and do the same. I am not going to Canada to catch my limit, I go to Canada to get in some ridiculous fishing. I want to be able to catch a 100 walleye a day and spend some time catching 30""+ pike. I was not able to do that on Eagle lake or in most places that I have tried in Canada. The only place that I have been able to do that is on Brace, Meta, and Ara lakes just NW of Nakina, Ont. I know that there are several others around but in my experience Eagle Lake wasn't one of them. I am making an investment of time and money to have an unique experience and catching 10 or 15 walleye a day is not unique to me. Just my 2 cents which is all it is worth."
1274330,Danbear,2011-02-23 10:35:00,72,"Narda, my gang and I will be at Birchdale same week, heard about your gang from Ernie, this will be our 4th trip to Birchdale and love the place, the new owners are great and take great care of us. We will have to have a Rye on Saturday night."
1274897,NARDA 1,2011-02-24 19:45:00,636,"Yeah I hear you like my barstool (I'll have to bring up another one). Looking forward to meeting your group. My group ""NARDA"" hosts a wing night in the Bullpit on Sunday night and your group is invited. And we will have more than 1 rye on Saturday!!!!Have a safe trip up and I'll see you in about 197 days.Terry"
