One of the things that came up was he wanted to try fishing Bear Creek in the LS section of Ear Falls. I played around with Google earth, looked at the map Andrea at Goose Bay provides, nothing marked as Bear Creek. Any body here on WC know where this creek is? Thanks in advance!"
1290638,cspierings,2011-04-04 08:32:00,230,"sure do we usually head up into it every trip. nothing impressive in terms of fishing for us but its a little something different and if you keep the noise to minimum you sometimes see some interesting wildlife. Find Brownbear or Bear lake southeast of Ear Falls. If you know where White Wing is or the outfit that flies the Beech 18s on floats out of Goose bay, look east of there. Following the south shore of goose bay you see a little bay, then east you find another much larger bay with a few islands in the mouth, keep going east and you get to a large point a small rocky island sticking up just east and then a much larger wooded island to the south. If you draw a line between the small rock and the larger wooded island the line runs northwest to south east and nearly points to the entrance to bear creek. You wind around back in there and eventually you reach the head of it where there is a little falls and an area where I have seen folks pull small boats up to the creek which feeds out of bear lake. Not a great description but if you can't figure it out message me and I can dig out the gps and give you a cooridinate for the bay which funnels down into the creek. One thing to watch is that that bay which leads to the creeks has some real rocky areas and depending on the water level you could do some damage if you don't pay attention."
