I can understand if the fishing is slower but I'd like to hear an independent assesment of the lodge, location on the lake and how much fishable area there is if and when the weather goes bad. Comments please. We're more interested in Walleye than chasing Muskie only. Looking at the total experience."
1292444,Ia Walihntr,2011-04-08 11:12:00,320,Duck Bay Lodge is an excellent choice for american plan. The resort is on Lake of the Woods in Sabaskong Bay. They have great boats with trolling motors and depth finders and also have guides available. Plenty of reefs to fish walleyes. Close weedy bays and shorelines for northern. Good smallmouth fishing. Great owners that help in any way possible. http://www.duckbaylodge.com Good luck. Marv.
