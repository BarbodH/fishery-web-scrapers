I know of many WC.com regulars that have been on the ice there recently. Must be just too shy to share? Lets here some of the reports on the past few weeks, and the rush to come leading to the close of the season.Lots of huge fish being caught, this I know."
1284691,fishncamp,2011-03-20 19:09:00,49,We had a great weekend with our guests on the lake. The fishing was great and I am sure more reports will trickle in as everyone gets off the lake tonight.
1284882,LeeMB,2011-03-21 10:11:00,83,"There have been hundreds of American guys fishing Lake Winnipeg the last week or so. Fishing has been so-so Everyone is catching some fish, but it is not fantastic. Travel is still sled only and moving lots is difficult.The traditional areas around Chalet Beach and the mouth have been slow. There have not been a lot of trophy size fish being caught in comparision to the number of anglers.School sizes appear to be smaller with some people very close to each other catching good numbers and others catching squat.To do well you have to be on your game and some prior knowledge of where they are catching fish."
1285304,T Mac,2011-03-22 08:31:00,10084,"Best ice fishing I ever had, for walleye. Not only numbers and size, but jigging with rod in hand is so much more fun than ...tip-ups. That rod and reel I got from you worked great, ED! My biggest was about 26"" (+/-)...but some of crew had fish up to 27"" +."
1285441,I Fish GS,2011-03-22 12:24:00,290,"We got to the mouth 10am sunday and by 10:10 I have a 8.1lbs on the ice I thought it was on. But we managed a few in 22-24"" range and few small ones the bit was slow. Went to Riverton monday same thing slow, managed few nice ones. Brian"
1286187,Backwater Eddy,2011-03-24 07:06:00,3871,"Glad to hear it bud. That Ice Hunter Frabill is made for them sumo class Greenbacks, super combo for big eyes.I bet your going back!With luck I'll join you next year.Ed"
1286191,Auggie264,2011-03-24 07:14:00,391,"I was up at Lake Winnipeg last week. Between 3 of us and 22 hours of fishing, we iced 306 walleyes. That come out to one of us catching one every 4.3 minutes! It was the best fishing I have ever experienced. We were in 12ft of water 2-3 miles north of Balsm Harbor. They moved out on us Sunday afternoon though. The biggest between us 3 was 27.25 and many 22-25 inchers. I switched to regular regular reels on my ice rods. After Saturday, I had to retape one reel, because the tape was wearing out! Clackin Raps were our best with Live Targets being second. I also caught fish on a Salmo Zipper."
1286631,Backwater Eddy,2011-03-25 04:31:00,3871,Sorry to hear it was so slow for ya Auggie.
1292052,Blackwatercats,2011-04-07 11:11:00,23,way to go buddy you guys really crushed em. Huge body of water and events like get so many people on the ice that someone usually gets into em really good. we found an area like that last year and pounded them for 3 weekends in a row. Thats the way the big lake is......sometimes you just pick the perfect spot....I bet you can't wait for next year!
