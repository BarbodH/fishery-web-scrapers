1288858,Golden Eagle,2011-03-30 13:30:00,2642,My wife has a 2011 annual license already. Our first trip together was in 1960 for 7 weeks of tent camping in the Chapleau area.
1288860,Jack77,2011-03-30 13:39:00,168,I once brought my wife and girlfriend but all they did was fight.The next time they both stayed home. I vowed never again to let women ruin my vacation.
1289258,Lovetofish,2011-03-31 12:50:00,458,My first Canada trip I took my girlfriend. We were invited by some life long friends who had made this trip a few times with their parents. My gal loved it so much I married her. We missed the next couple years for our wedding and starting a family. We started going back in 1994 or 1995 and we haven't missed a trip since. When our kids were 8 and 6 we started bringing them along. Now this year we get to bring our son's girlfriend. I've made other trips with the guys and have always had fun. But our big trip is a family vacation with the same friends we started with. Add us all up and it's 30+ people and we take over the whole camp. So why not bring your wife? You never know what it might turn into.
1289269,Guest,2011-03-31 13:25:00,0,"I'm lucky to have a wife that likes to fish & she's a good Walleye jig angler. I'm lucky to go two times a year to Canada. Once with the guys and a second trip with Sue and other retired couples. We do to a resort that provides all the food, cleans up the cabins and cleans the fish for us. Our wives like that idea. Eat, sleep, fish & enjoy shore lunch."

1288064,Hawker,2011-03-28 16:05:00,3967,"I've been married (very happily I might add) to my wife for 40 years this past month and ""WE"" have been making at least one trip, sometimes two, to Canada on fishing trips every single year for the past 20 years!! I see my wife as my best buddy, my best friend and the person I want to spend my free time with be it on a vacation or just a weekend getaway!! Over the past 20 years and our trips to Canada we have been joined at times by one, two and even three ""other"" married couples, and on more than a couple occasions by groups of up to 15 ""men"" and we (my wife & I) have a great time whether it's just us alone or with a group!! Does not bother me at all to un-invite ""anyone"" who has a problem of any kind with my wife being part of the group!!! Like I said,,,,,,,,,,, she's my best friend and I wouldn't think of not having her by my side to enjoy all the things that we've learned to share and enjoy with each other!!"
1288093,jaggersr,2011-03-28 16:56:00,44,"What Hawker said! My wife and I go to Canada a 2 to 3 times per year. Neither of us would have it any other way. The only time she does not go is when my son and I are hunting. My wife is my best friend. Fishing is seamless with her. She has her own poles, and takes care of her self when we are fishing.We have a routine when we are loading or unloading the boat and she can also fillet fish better than most. We fish almost every weekend from April to Sept and I would not think of going without her."
1288163,JinxCanada,2011-03-28 20:21:00,1306,"If I'm being honest, I wish my wife was still around to fish with me...but since she's not....i'm on the hunt for my next wife. :-)"

1288361,Walleye_Wrangler,2011-03-29 11:40:00,138,"Hey Jinx, Maybe you should start guiding. Sounds like you run a fun boat ."
1288375,Kruger,2011-03-29 12:11:00,259,"I love my wife enough to not take her. If I asked I'm sure she would go and even pretend like she was having a good time. Just like I do every time she takes me to the Cancun, on a cruise, to visit her extended family in England, to the mall, to play cards at her sisters, out to dinner with the neighbors, etc, etc."
1288629,JinxCanada,2011-03-29 21:55:00,1306,Well I do aim to please!!!

1286929,Slushfish,2011-03-25 14:55:00,263,"I have a hard time going without her. Luckily we get 5-6 trips per yr. I get two with the guys, 1 wk in Feb. and 1 wk in November. The rest are for the family. Soon my two sons will be old enough for the cold winter trip and old enough to hunt. Then the trips with the guys will be over. Family is more important!"
1286947,jiggster,2011-03-25 15:48:00,183,I enjoy having my wife go on a fishing trip with me to Canada. At the same time to take her on a fishing trip to Canada when I go with the guys I would not take her on the trip.
1287067,Moondog,2011-03-25 22:39:00,362,I am not sure what you said here.
1287283,JinxCanada,2011-03-26 15:16:00,1306,I prefer various women on my boat for different trips....makes for some good fun when the fish aren't biting.
1287546,stevensinks,2011-03-27 11:38:00,330,My wife only fishes one time a year and that is when we go to Canada. We have a blast and I love taking her.I have been on guy trips and they also were great Mike I know just what you are talking about. My wife has the largest walleye of all of our trips and except for last year she has had the most fish. I would be supprised if you hadent heard about it. Everyone else has.

Both trips are great and have their special times; my wife has said many times her favorite vacation hands down is our annual trip to Canada. She enjoys fishing, but even more she enjoys the solitude of no phone, no computer, no TV. When we're hungry we eat, when we want to fish we fish, when we're tired we rest. Wouldn't trade the memories of these trips for anything."
1287838,Pooch,2011-03-28 07:14:00,4619,"My wife is the best fishing partner I have. I get to fish anywhere on the lake I want! She doesn't care where we are as long as she has her book to read.Like Thumper50 said, ""when we're hungry we eat, when we're tired we take a nap"". It's a vacation for both of us. No pressure, no phone, no nonsense.Spend a week in a cabin with the love of your life and you'll re-discover why she's the love of your life.Pooch"

1286137,5 of Diamonds,2011-03-23 23:40:00,151,"My Wife goes w/ me every year on our annual fly-in trip to Northern Quebec. She loves to fish as much as I do. Catching Walleye, Pike & Lake Trout (throw a few Whitefish & Suckers in there too), seeing Moose, Caribou, Black Bear & Loons completes her trip. Throw in a few cases of Canadian Beer, some top shelf American Bourbon and a few Cuban cigars for myself and I'm exactly where I want to be w/ who I want to be with. She is quite an Angler in her own right, loves to hit the tackle shops w/ me and is easy on the eyes. I'm a very lucky guy! Looking forward to our next trip in early June."
1286169,rebs,2011-03-24 06:24:00,7587,"My wife is my best fishing partner and I take her on all my fishing trips.I have never been invited on a guys only fishing trip and have never gone on one. I would go on one but never had the opportunity.IF anyone remembers my fishing buiddy Carl that has the bad back and neck, we tried to organize a guys only trip quite a few years ago before his back was too bad but, the other guys could not get vacation at the same time and then Carl's back got so bad he couldn't go either."
1286193,Mike Kansas,2011-03-24 07:17:00,1463,I'm lucky enough to be able to go on 3 to 4 trips a year to Canada. One of the trips is a trip that 3 or 4 couples go on. The wives love it and talk all the time during the year about it. They have a blast and love not only the fishing but just seeing the great job that mother nature does with Canada. For me its awesome to see the wife have that much fun with something that I also love to do. Unfortunatly my wife has the biggest Walleye we have caught on the couples trip and I was dumb enough to get a replica made for her and she has it in the living room. She wears me out with it when company comes. I think she enjoys it to much. Mike Kansas

1286385,joeman79,2011-03-24 13:42:00,417,"I have asked my wife to go with Stevensink and his wife and her answer was a short one. NO. I think she would like it for 2 days but after that, nahhh. SHe likes to fish, but not that seriously. And I don't argue!!! I like the guys trip. ALOT She does although love to go fishing with me when we go to Cabo! And I do have to admit we have a BLAST fishing together down there. But 2 days is enough for her. But there is also a beautiful resort and several pools and shopping to occupy her when she aint in the fishin mood. Some day I think Charlie and Brad and our wives will all make a Canada trip to Bow Narrows, but her bag will have several books for the rainy days in the cabin, and suncreen for sunny afternoons on the boat."

546196,DaveIN,2005-03-10 11:44:00,191,The only drawback to taking my wife to Canada is the fact that I have to pay all expenses instead of sharing them with a group. My wife catches more fish than most of the guys that I have gone with and it sure is nice to have her doing the cooking instead of having to eat my own cooking.
546205,IA  DAN,2005-03-10 17:53:00,53,"Nope, my wife says her vacation starts when I go to Canada,besides she told me if I'm going to Canada fishing every year with the boys then I'm going to have to take her to Iowa's Bowl game every year where ever its at.Gee honey don't twist my arm oh alright I guess I can do that.Orlando,Fl WHAT A CATCH AND THROW.Go Hawks Catch and Release the Big Ones so somebody else has a chance to catch there DREAM FISH."

546334,Guest,2005-03-16 07:20:00,0,"Out of curiosity I checked my records for the last 10 years to compare how many Husband /Wife teams fish with me. In 1994 8% of my customers were H/W teams, in 2004 I had 22% H/W teams. I also have noticed that the Wives are much better fisherman now than they were before. In fact last year wives caught the biggest Walleye (31"") and the biggest Smallmouth (23"")for the year. The Men caught the biggest Pike (43"") and Muskie (46"")."
546354,Guest,2005-03-16 20:14:00,0,My wife really enjoys the trip. My youngest son (now 22) always goes and my oldest son (26) usually goes. It's a great family trip!

546164,Guest,2005-03-09 08:45:00,0,"We celebrated our honeymoon on a fly-in and have gone each year since. She is a country girl and loves fishing and nature. Our first morning we awoke to a ruffed grouse mother and chicks nestled in the fire-pit below the deck. She takes a lot of photos of loons or moose, swimming cariboo, what ever we come across while fishing. She can take the bad weather too - we were up during that horrid third week of June last year. We lived in our Guidewear. She chose to wear flip-flops one cold day instead of shoes and had mild frost bite on 4 toe tips. She took is stride - same with removing hooks from her hand or fingers - she can take pain better than I can. I find a fly-in with my wife much more relaxing than a trip with the guys. No power drinking nights, sleep in a little later, we take breaks during the day on a beach to run the dog/swim with the dog. All-guy trips are fun but there is usually some kind of tension at some point or testosterone/alcohol induced rivalry at some point. And guys snore and fart a lot louder. She is an excellent anlger and netman and does everything in the boat short of removing a hook from a fish eye - as that happens once in a while. I highly recommend. But not all women enjoy the outdoors and the cabin lifestyle-I consider myself a very lucky man. That week each year in Ontario goes by way too fast. We prefer the more seculded fly-in trips versus drive-in lakes. Her boat-controller(me) has put her on a 13lb walleye and 47in pike, but never gives me credit.;)"

She dont contribute any cash towards the trip, which I dont mind once and awhile, but I dont like it to become a yearly thing with me included. I guess maybe what used to be a guy thing is turning into a family thing. Time and money pretty much dictate one trip a year for me, but usually it is a 2 week fishing trip. Maybe it is time for me to blaze new trails next year. Funny, I used to look forward to this trip, but when she comes along, I just look for it to get over,lol. Thank you guys for your input. TC"

546188,Guest,2005-03-10 07:15:00,0,Im surprised that so many of you avid fisherman appear to think that taking your wife to Canada is a burden. I go on 6 fishing trips a year and take my wife on two of them. The trips with her are special because she is just like a little kid when she is catching fish. She probably enyoys fishing as much if not more than the guys on my other trips and each trip with her actually enhances our relationship. She talks about her fishing trips all year long and looks forwrd to them as much if not more than I do. In fact the last couple of years she has wanted fishing equipment for Xmas which is actually a bonus for me because I can buy her the expensive stuff and borrow it on my trips and believe me she has some nice fishing equipment.
546190,Guest,2005-03-10 08:25:00,0,"I go on 2 trips to Cananda a year. 1 trip with the guys and later in the year with my 17 year old daughter( wife has gone but now prefers to stay home). I started taking her when she was 7, I really get the business when I go without her! I'll keep doing it until she begins taking me, thats how it worked out with my dad."
546146,Guest,2005-03-08 14:42:00,0,"I don't think ""Canada"" has anything to do with the situation. There are fishing with the guys trips, and wife and family trips. If you go with a bunch of guys, someplace, annual ritual thing, the wife doesn't go. If she insists, you quit going on that particular trip. You wouldn't take your fishing buddy on the family trip would you?"

I get to always pick out where we are going to fish that day! ""The boy's trip"". Well, that does not need explaining. Nothing in life is finer than spending time in the boat with your life long friends. If you think about it, what else is there in life but friends and family. Pooch"
546161,BuckeyeWilly,2005-03-08 22:06:00,41,"Have taken my wife many times on trips to Canada. She loves it as much as I do and usually outfishes me. We once spent 9 days together on a secluded island in the middle of Minnitaki Lake. What a great trip! This June she is retiring after 30 years of school teaching so to celebrate we are going to be on a houseboat on Lac Seul!! I have been on ""guys only"" trips with good buddies (fly-ins) and agree thats no place for the women. Somebody on walleyecentral always ends their posts with the saying ""happy wife means happy life."" I always smile when I read that and think - how true, how true. Good fishing this year guys, whether your with buddies or the wife."

She fishs about half the time we are in the boat and reads the other half. However each time I get us on some fish she sets down the book and starts fishing. She also will wear out a Digital camera if you let her and that is fine with me because it helps us bring home the memorys that only fishing in Canada can provide."

My wife doesn't fish, but really enjoys the days on the water. She reads a lot of books in seven days. I really enjoy having her along to share the fun with. I hope we can continue doing this for many years to come."

For our 30th aniversary, I offered a cruise and she chose Canada instead. We always spend our wedding aniversary in Canada fishing."

My wife couldn't handle the ""roughing it"" trip that I take with the guys and I can't convince her of anything other than the beach for the family vacation. So the status quo is that I catch grief for 50 weeks per year on how selfish I am for spending our money on going to Canada without the family... Some day I'll trick her into going up there and completely change her mind on where to go for vacation from now on. With any luck, I can remove the thoughts of Myrtle Beach from her mind."

All are good but have come to enjoy the trip with my wife the most. Slower paced, both on the trip up and back and the hours on the water, and she has come to really enjoy the fishing."
546143,Guest,2005-03-08 14:23:00,0,I take 5 trips to Canada each year. I have been Married 5 times and I take each one of my 5 x wives on one trip every year. I dont get much fishing done but I have lost 35 lbs in the last three years.
546145,Guest,2005-03-08 14:38:00,0,"I would not take my wife to Canada. She likes to fish some, but would not like to be so isolated where the only thing to do is fish. Canada is for the guys. My wife and I go to Northern Wisconsin, a shorter drive from Chicago, with small towns to visit and local festivals. The water warms faster so swimming and tubing is an option. Cell phones work there and there is a TV for the nightly news."
