1280961,Pezman38,2011-03-11 07:55:00,3196,"A good rule for the weights, is use the lightest weight you can to feel the bottom. You should be able to sweep your pole up, and then down and feel the weight touch the bottom. If you can't do that then you need heavier weight, or less speed. We try to troll as slow as possible like Takleman, I would guess .5-1 90% of the time. If winds are high we throw drift socks out to try and slow down. So all that being said, 1 oz would be the heaviest I would use. I rarely go over a 1/2 oz because I try to get the boat control within the .5-1 mph which usually means the 1/2 is fine."
1291367,jkwildhunting,2011-04-05 19:48:00,361,For the Guys that stay at 5 Lakes we just read in the newsletter they are under new ownership.....We will sure miss Everett and Helen hopefully the new owners are good just like our experience we have had with them.under 3 months till we are up there
1291441,Tonyo,2011-04-06 05:16:00,212,I am unsure of the information you have received but we have been staying at 5 Lakes and I just talked to Everett a few days ago. Are you sure about this? The annual news letter is still on my desk and has no mention of new ownership. TonyO
1291549,teddi,2011-04-06 09:03:00,349,it has been sold. check out their website for more info
1291590,jkwildhunting,2011-04-06 10:49:00,361,"Yup, It's in the Newsletter it was sold to a younger couple that lived across the bay."
1291803,tackleman,2011-04-06 19:09:00,444,"On april 1 my next door neighbour and his wife became the proud owners of 5 lakes lodge.Ian and Drew are a great couple, they have 2 children both pre-school age and are great kids.Ian and Drew are both hometown kids and Ian knows Red Lake and Gullrock as well as anyone. He loves fishing and hunting and is just a super young man.If you are concerned about the new owners, you shouldn't be. they will make your stay a pleasure and will help you with anything they can.Heck he even told me that he wouldn't mind taking my money for gas and minnows, kinda brings a tear to your eye, doesn't it!"
1291868,jkwildhunting,2011-04-06 21:26:00,361,"Thanks Tackleman, Everett Told us bout you and I mentioned your name to him and he said you were in one morning to get minnows but we were already out fishing hopefully this year we can run across each other and shoot the bull.I am not to affraid of the new owners just saddened to see Everett and Helen get out of the camp ownership but life brings changes and hopefully the lodge will be just as good with the new ownership. Anxious to meet them and here all his Red Lake Tournament stories and maybe learn some new tricks or spots on Gull Rock"
1291951,Pezman38,2011-04-07 07:43:00,3196,"This is the third Camp sale that I have heard about in the last 7-8 years. Poplar Point resort is under new ownership and I hear great things about the new owner, Wrights has been under Lee and Stephanie now for 5-6 years and are great (its where I stay), and 5 Lakes is now under new ownership. So far I have heard these changes go on without a hitch, the previous owners seem to do a great job finding similar people to run them with US in mind."
1291986,johnboat,2011-04-07 09:01:00,2014,"The new owners have some big shoes to fill. Both Everett and Helen sure made the stay at Five Lakes Lodge more enjoyable. Their customer service was top notch, and more importantly natural. The camp was always clean as a whistle and more than accomidating. Both truely nice people to be around. I wish them nothing but the best in the future. I was sad the hear the news but am sure they are putting the camp in capible hands. I wish the new owners all the best and looking forward to meeting them and continue my streak of staying there for years to come. John B.O.A.T."
1279167,J Arendt,2011-03-07 13:06:00,45,I dont know if I have anything to offer on Gullrock that hasnt already been mentioned here. I have been going to Gullrock for the past 17 years and havent missed a walleye opener. Have seen ice on the pond and like last year well off. Great drive to camps on the system and Red Lake is near by if you need to get to town. I have stayed at Wrights when it was Mike Weavers camp and currently stay at Golden Hook. This system is a walleye factory like tackleman has said in the past. Lots of fish for everyone. Good days and bad like fishing can be but mostly good on Gullrock with dozens of good spots both well known and discover your own. Good luck to all in 2011.
1280155,Pezman38,2011-03-09 12:28:00,3196,"I have been going to Wrights since I was 13, and will continue to stay there. Tackleman is spot on, I tie my own harnesses though and use #3 and #4 colorado blades. Make sure the blade has chartreuse, or is gold and you will be fine. I like the quick change clevis to swap them out easy. If tackleman says to have indiana, then get some because the less vibration is probably key early in the year. Tackleman, did you get the ipilot because you were tried of throwing a marker out and catching more fisherman with it than fish? I always love tossing one out for a reference, usually 20 feet off where we are fishing, just to watch boat after boat drift over it while we catch fish 20 feet away. We normally fish in early August, and at that time there is no reason to get into your boat until 8 or 830 because the walleyes won't bite till 9 anyway."
1280301,tackleman,2011-03-09 18:01:00,444,"No, i still toss out a marker or 2 to mark the drop offs, I never drop a marker where I'm catching the fish.The reason I got the ipilot was after watching a bunch of people hold their spots in rough water while I was pushed all over the place kind of sold me on the idea.I also liked the idea that it adjusted it's speed automatically to keep you on the spot."
1280369,Strickers cut,2011-03-09 20:51:00,33,"maybe that was us tacklemanwe were up second week in September last year and were using the Ipilot out on the gullrock in some pretty good wind. We hovered on the break and caught walleye after walleye, jigging."
1280497,J Arendt,2011-03-10 08:36:00,45,Tackleman-- How heavy of a in line sinker do you use and where can I find them?
1280517,Pezman38,2011-03-10 08:56:00,3196,"These work excellent, they can be found in every bait shop on the way to your resort. 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 are all I ever use.http://www.cabelas.com/weights-cabel...inkers-2.shtml"
1280600,J Arendt,2011-03-10 13:13:00,45,cstalzer---- thanks for your help the shopping at cabelas is complete for now. New question-- how fast do you have to troll to turn the blade on the spinner?
1280660,tackleman,2011-03-10 15:31:00,444,i use 3/4 ounce weights and occasionally 1 ounce if the wind is really blowing and the boat is going too fast. I want that line on the bottom and a fast drift will pull a lighter weight off the bottom.I try to troll about 1 to 1 1/2 kph (kilometers per hour) but the slower the better.
1280941,J Arendt,2011-03-11 07:07:00,45,Tackleman and cstalzer-- Thanks for your help on the in line sinkers. How heavy a sinker if you get winds like last September? I was up the third week it was brutal.
1280957,jkwildhunting,2011-03-11 07:51:00,361,Getting a good assortment in sizes will be helpful. If you could make it so the wind was calm then it would make it very simple. I run bottom bouncers and have assortment of sizes from 1.5-3oz usually the larger size ones get used more. Last fall was brutal and reason we were using the heavier weights cause I am one that hates having 2x or 3x line out as you should. Running bottom bouncers the key is to have a 45degree angle with your line vs water. Answer your other question we vary our speeds untill the fish tell us. start around .6-.7 MPH then up the speeds to around 1.3-1.4 sometimes is our max MPH.
1274664,jkwildhunting,2011-02-24 09:23:00,361,"We bought the Navonic chip last year it helps yes since our boat has GPS and on foggy days it will help you follow your trail from previous days. But as far as Contours it did not help much i think they are in 10ft contours so not precise like what I am use to (Iowa Chip) It does show all the Islands and such.As far as dragging spinners. I will chime in. We use mainly Northland Spinners the baitfish patterns seem to be good. We stick mainly to the double hooks even for minnows since we use the 4"" gulp minnows we can place one hook in the tail (short biters). IMO getting a variety of bottom bouncers is the key. Most of the time 2oz seems to work fine but last fall it was rough and when you got in the rougher water you needed to let out alot more line to keep in contact with bottom. So we would up our size to 3oz. I think the saying is you need 1oz for every 10FOW you fish and you want a 45 degree angle in your line while fishing bottom bouncers with spinners."
1274927,tackleman,2011-02-24 21:08:00,444,"the spinners I use are #4 indiana blades with 4mm beads and about a 36inch mono leader.As far as ice out, who knows, tonight will be -29 degrees and the same tomorrow according to the weather forcasts. and we are almost into march.I would think the ice should be gone by May 10th but sometimes it last longer as some on this board can attest to arriving at their tourist camps for opening day and still waiting for a day or two for the ice to clear out."
1275029,Moondog,2011-02-25 09:25:00,362,Do you use a slip sinker or bottom bouncer with those spinners?
1275066,tackleman,2011-02-25 10:53:00,444,"I put a swivel on the end of the line, hook on an inline sinker, then put the spinner on the swivel end of the sinker. I have never tried a bottom bouncer but I have some in the tackle box so I may try them this year."
1275219,Moondog,2011-02-25 16:18:00,362,Before when we have used spinner-ish type rigs we used an slip sinker (egg) above the swivel. This method sounds better with less kinks. Thanks Tackleman!
1275683,Robert Cardenas,2011-02-26 22:26:00,138,"When fishing for walleyes that time of the year, I have done my best up there with jigs, the smaller you can use the better. You will catch a lot of 20""+ fish. Fish the islands where the wind is coming into them and definetely fish the WALL before all the boats get out there. Good Luck."
1276002,Moondog,2011-02-27 18:29:00,362,"Yeah we generally ONLY jig fish but it never hurts to have other weapons in your arsenal. As far as getting to the WALL (I assume you mean the BOOT) you can never get there before anyone else does. I think they sleep there. However.........there are plenty of places to fish on Gull Rock, AND catch plenty of fish and not have to play bumper cars with people that think they own that space. I have run into more fishing morons there than any other place on the lake."
1276046,Robert Cardenas,2011-02-27 20:22:00,138,"I totally understand moondog. I do also like spinners, it seems to pick up a lot more pike also."
1276457,jkwildhunting,2011-02-28 21:32:00,361,"I have been to the boot while no one is there but like stated earlier. Get up early and fish it. We are usually first group out every time we are up there. 7ish and have seen the boot bare but like stated other wise not worth the hastle of people thinking they own that section. Has anyone tried pitchin jigs? I think there are more fish up shallow then we may think. Last year we were fishing the 3 sister islands with some daredevils going after pike. I thru up towards the point of the island and had a 18"" walleye crush my 1oz daredevil. I am not much of a drift n jig or anchor n jig guy but I think I may try pitchin some jigs up in the shallow water. Also gunna pull some stick baits on the bottom this year prolla wont be able to keep the northern off but if that is the case I will quit."
1278183,Robert Cardenas,2011-03-04 22:57:00,138,"My experience on Gull Rock during the end of may early June was not so good for the pike. I am a big walleye guy but I like the variety of fishing when in Canada. It seemed to me it was just walleyes, and a few pike. It is typically cool and the Ice is just going off in early may. I have fished in the snow up there at the end of May. Don't get me wrong though the lake was fun to fish."
1270620,oly67,2011-02-12 09:41:00,241,"I am thinking of going to Gull Rock around May 28 this year. Was up there many years ago in September and had terrific fishing. Is there any reason to go a week or 2 later, or is this time possibly as good as any? What might the patterns be? Will be trying for northerns almost as much as walleyes. Thanks."
1271363,REG,2011-02-15 06:54:00,445,We fish just down the road from you the first week of June every year. Unless there is wild weather you'll have great fishing. Patterns? I haven't fished Gullrock but think shallow - 4' down to 12' will hold a lot of fish - both walleyes and northerns. Fish points and beaches where the wind has been blowing in. Have fun!
1271468,johnboat,2011-02-15 12:54:00,2014,"We've been going up the last week in May for the last 8-9 years to Gullrock. When we are up again this year we will reserve our spot again for 2012 for the same week. I, and the other 10 guys in our group would say go. Has always been a lot of us Iowans up there at Five Lakes Lodge. There are folks on here that have forgotten more about the lake than I will ever know. Wait for a response from ""Tackleman"" and do what ever he says. Keep'er On The Bottom! JohnB.O.A.T"
1272138,jkwildhunting,2011-02-17 12:45:00,361,Ditto on what others said.We have only fished Gull Rock in August-late fall. Fishing is always good sometimes they are lil harder to find but once you find the depth they are at hold on cause you will catch em We also stay at 5 Lakes and will be up there Mid July and possibly again in the fall not sure yet. Good Luck and Tight Lines
1272521,GWC,2011-02-18 12:17:00,1021,We've been going to GullRock for about the last 4 years. Some of our group went up the last week of May two years ago. They had a great time. We'll be going this year in early June. Always had good luck there for both Pike & walleye. Our spring trip is usually the third week of June. We were there Last September. The lake was a little rough but the fishing was great. Enjoy your trip.
1274150,tackleman,2011-02-22 19:16:00,444,"Thanks Johnboat for the vote of confidence. I find the fishing really slow when the opening week is early in May. However, this year it is as late as it gets and by that time the water should be warmer and the fish more active. As a number of guys on this board will attest, I usually troll with a spinner and a minnow, but lots of guys jig and stay on 1 spot. for myself, I like to keep moving and getting the active fish. That being said, I just got an I Pilot trolling motor so I may try the jigging method more this year.If you troll, go slow at that time of the year as the water won't be THAT warm and the fish are probably just getting to the really active mode.I use hammered brass, hammered silver, pink, pink and white, black and white, and blue spinners, depending on the weather conditions, (bright for bright days, dark for darker days) and this seem to produce well.As far as spots go, you will see a number of boats around the fisherman's point area and off some of the points down that way, there will also probably be boats around the entrance to gullrock from red lake . The method I have found as far as finding the fish, get one, check the depth, get another, check the depth then work those depths as it appears to be consistent with other areas of the lake.If you see a lot of boats fishing one location, don't be shy, go join the party and make some new friends, in 20 years on the lake I have only had 1 person complain about me being ""in their spot"" even though I had just arrived and was getting my trolling motor down to start my day.dont be afraid to ask where people are catching the fish, there are soooooo many there's enough for everyone. You should also be aware that at that time of the year there is a sanctuary posted on Gullrock (past fishermans point) and up the creek to Ranger Lake . This will open after June 15th.The camp owners also have a policy of no fish in camp over the size limit, even though the regulations allow 1 over. This policy has been in place for at least 10 years and the fishing has improved immensly though these self imposed rules.Most people I meet on the lake, including myself, carry cameras and when a big one is landed, it is photographed and released.If you see a blue and tan alumacraft with a 150 merc on the back and a fat old guy in the bow, come on over and say hi.have a great trip. Gullrock is a fabulous fishery and the camp owners are great people, i'm pretty sure you won't be disappointed in coming here."
1274282,jkwildhunting,2011-02-23 08:15:00,361,"Tackleman is spot on. He knows the lake and has fishing reports almost weekly We fish with Spinners and Gulp baits. Nightcrawlers, Minnows and Leeches with excellent luck. Vary your speed to slow then increase them if your pulling spinners.We have best luck on Gold, orange/yellow, yellow green spinners.Some spots Tackleman has stated. Fisherman Point, 3 sisters, The boot, Burnt Island, Red Buoy Island.If the wind is strong going in all the islands have produced well last year we had rough water in fall the hole trip so we tried to get down to fisherman point but called it quits half way there and pulled into all the islands and worked them some nice fish got pulled out of them some of the islands were very SMALL to. So dont over look islands and target windblown sides or calm spots were fish may be sitting to attack baitfish.."
1274359,Moondog,2011-02-23 12:06:00,362,Tackleman........What kind of spinners??? We generally jig with pink but would like to try dragging something for a change. Thanks
1274378,richf,2011-02-23 13:11:00,31,"Tackleman: based on what you see now will GullRock have an early, late or average ""ice out""?Thanks for your input."
1274494,oly67,2011-02-23 19:01:00,241,Thanks for all the replies so far. Is there a GPS chip that shows Gullrock accurately?
