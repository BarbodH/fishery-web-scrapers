1288646,wpgguy,2011-03-30 01:22:00,3,I was wondering if anyone knows where I could get around 60 leeches in early April around Winnipeg
1289065,tackleman,2011-03-30 21:30:00,444,go and see Bob at pro-am tackle in the plaza on the corner of Lagamodiere and Regent. His store is just down from Penningtons and Joey's only ..Failing that my fishing partner from Ste Rose used to get his at Manny's bait but that's out of town on #1 higway toward Kenora.
1289449,wpgguy,2011-04-01 00:32:00,3,Thanks for the reply I contacted Manny's live bait and it seems that leeches won't be available until late April or early May
