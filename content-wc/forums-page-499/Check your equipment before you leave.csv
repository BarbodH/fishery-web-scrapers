1292462,J Arendt,2011-04-08 12:44:00,45,Hey guys--Everybody probably does this already but: check the bearings on the trailor--take the plug for the boat--charge batteries--tune boat motor--new line--fillet knife etc.etc.-- Everybody have a great time in Canada at your spot and be safe.
1292471,Outfitter17,2011-04-08 13:11:00,127,"J,That's a great post that everyone should follow. We have guys come up every year for spring trout before the MN walleye opener and every year there are 1 or 2 boats that won't start/run and they get put back on the trailer on not used during the trip. I don't know why some guys don't check their equipment before they go, but some don't. Make sure all your stuff works, it makes for a better trip."
1292506,wallydave,2011-04-08 14:45:00,2151,"I have new line waiting and ready to go. I am waiting until the time for my trip is closer. If I start now, I may drive myself crazy"
1292538,weedsnager,2011-04-08 16:10:00,252,check the bearings on the trailer......but don't just grab your grease gun and start shooting grease in there just for the heck of it.
1292592,ohiojmj,2011-04-08 18:18:00,1262,"Heck, I just inspected & cleaned my bearings, repacked, and replaced grease seals. Since I like to be prepared, I check to make sure my SUV jack can work on trailer, bring trailer lug wrench, grease, and one complete set of bearings, not to mention the right tools. If I'm on the side of a remote road, I'll have what need to make the wheels turn on the trailer at least."
1292600,weedsnager,2011-04-08 18:49:00,252,i carry an extra hub with me alsohttp://www.basspro.com/Spare-Hub-Kit.../37341/-899880
1292608,guidedfishing,2011-04-08 19:02:00,531,"Oh where do I begin.. lol In addition to the Wheel bearings being repacked as needed here are just a few things that leap to mind off my list. Spare trailer tire, with correct air pressure Spare truck tire, with correct air pressure Tire plugs, electric 12volt air compressor (used this more than once) Fuse's, and lamps for boat and trailer Plugs for every fitting on my boat so when a live well intake snaps you don't have to test the level floatation features hose clamps and fuel line, It seems I loan these out to guys that need them more than I use them. One of each major bolt that holds my trailer together, (yup snapped a few over the years) I actually carry two spare props, I tend to go in just a little further than most. I also carry an extra prop nut for both the main motor and the kicker and My kicker is meant as a last resort to get me out, no electric will push me the 20 miles I need to make it back. Small volt ohm meter, nothing worse than electrical issues helps get to the trouble point and fixed quicker Long enough heavy rope in the boat to tow someone who has not planned ahead. And always a spare set of truck keys in the boat...long story Just a few things that jump into my mind, I could go on, I think most guys have their own extensive list they work from good luck GF"
1292635,Fishin Fun,2011-04-08 20:24:00,218,"My list:1. Complete set of tools in a tool box.2. Extra set of spark plugs for boat3. Spare trailer tire4. Extra set of bearings, seals, grease5. Bottle jack6. Tire seal7. Electric compressor8. Multiple size of wire and wire ends9. Fuses10. Extra prop and nut11. Extra boat rivets12. Multiple sheet metal screws13. first aid kit14. Fire extinguisher15. Many other small items too numerous to list."
1292689,plumberjoe,2011-04-09 06:08:00,54,"One thing I have found handy is a complete trailer wiring harness with lights. I think the last one was under 40 bucks. This gives you light bulbs, lense covers, wire, male and female trailer plug ends and conectors all in one nice kit. Another thing we pack is extra end caps for our bearings we always seam to lose one on rough roads."
