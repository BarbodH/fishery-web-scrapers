1288172,v-bay gord,2011-03-28 20:35:00,3168,I agree Moondog......but what is the question?
1288176,Moondog,2011-03-28 20:46:00,362,"Good Point, V-Bay!!! Getting one out of three isn't too bad considering I am from the USA. We are so confused these days. Maybe I just need to go fishing.............only 53 days."
1288888,ScottB,2011-03-30 15:10:00,11,"Just wanted to post an update and close this thread. Sorry it turned into a Canada vs. US battle (can't we all just get along )I found a local bank that does International Bank Notes for $30, but they won't do one for me because I don't have an account with them. I wasn't about to go to the trouble of setting up an account just for this purpose.After discussing this with the owner again, he agreed to cash my American checks and save the receipts showing the exchange difference and the fees he had to pay to do the exchange and I will make up the difference and pay his fees when I go up there this summer. I'm fine with this, I was never trying to get a discount or anything and I offered to do this last week. Thankfully he had a change of heart. I appreciate all the advice."
1289367,a3dad,2011-03-31 19:04:00,115,one thing I never understood is why some resorts publish USD$ prices for US customers and CAN$ prices for canadian customers. I've seen it on many outfitters sites/publications. I'd much rather have one price stated in CAN$ for all.... I also noticed that when the USD$ weakened that many went to specifying charges in CAN$. I feel like they are using the exchange rate to their benefit. In my opinion this should be the advantage/disadvantage of the customer. I don't mind paying currency exchange rates when I travel outside of my country. I just don't want to feel taken advantage of!
1287603,Obabikon,2011-03-27 14:50:00,2370,"Wow, a chip on my sholder and a nob? Why not try to keep things less personal, and actually try to have a conversation with someone. Rather than immediately going on the offensive. Maybe my post was not written correctly and led to the inflamation. If that's the case, I apologize that you took it as offensively as you did. I was simply trying to point out that the Canadian resorts are being forced to raise their prices to survive. We rely on mostly US citizens to help keep our resorts going. So, when the US economy takes a downturn, without a doubt Canadian tourism feels it. When the US dollar's value goes down, we feel that too. Actually, we problably feel it more than the average American citizen. Simply because it directly affects us on a daily basis. Also, not sure why it matters but I'm a U.S. citizen. Both my parents are US citizens. My wife is a US citizen. So, needless to say, my healthcare and my entire family's healthcare is taken care of in the US. Here's my actual defense to the ""risk"" posed. If I book a guest in February, giving them a quote, and the Dollar goes from 1.15 to .90 cents... a few things could happen. 1. A guest cancels because of the 25% jump in the cost of his trip. I then of course to do not refund the deposit, but that doesn't make up for a complete lack of attendance. 2. A guest comes and refuses to pay more than the cost agreed on in February. My fuel costs, grocery costs, staff costs are all in Canadian dollars. So, that means I immediately pay the 25% off the top of my gross income. Incredibly painful. 3. A guest comes, pays and is so upset about the increased cost wont return. Most resorts bank on an 70-80% return rate (or better). If a guest leaves upset, the odds of him/her coming back are greatly diminished. 4. A guest comes enjoys his trip. I'm not saying that those things would happen, but there's a risk. I understand that the US dollar is indeed the standard, but that doesn't mean it's the only currency. The costs of a Canadian run resort does not decrease when the US dollar does. We are a resort that charges in US funds, because it's a helpful service to our guests. It can also swing the other way, where it benefits our resort. So, we take the good with the bad. However, there is definately at least an arguement on the defense of resorts that just charge in Canadian funds."
1287625,adempsey,2011-03-27 16:11:00,963,"I don't think the problem is charging in Canadian funds, it's more the lack of making the transaction easy for the guests. The resort needs to make this easy to do, nobody should have to jump through hoops just to pay for something especially if it's only in the best interest of the owner - it's not like the guest benefits from paying in Canadian $. It makes no sense to me whatsoever."
1287635,Obabikon,2011-03-27 16:31:00,2370,"I definately agree with the inability of this specific owner to be able to provide proper service to his guest. It should never be difficult to spend money on a vacation. My comments were more of the idea that, if someone wants to pay in US funds (for simplicity), it's an option all over Canada. However, I'm against the idea that just because someone has a Canadian business they MUST charge in US funds. They're a business in another country... No matter what my opinion is. I'm defending the right of an owner to run their business the way they see fit. ***NOTE*** - I'm not being sarcastic, I don't have a a chip on my shoulder, and I'm simply adding to a discussion without the intention of offending anyone. Hopefully this doesn't offend anyone."
1287668,Shellback,2011-03-27 17:21:00,8083,"I think Canada is a lot more accommodating to foreign currency than the US. I know it's a royal PIA for me dealing with a dividend check that comes to me from France, which is in Euros. My bank didn't want any parts of the Euros. Then I had it set up for wire transfer of US funds. Then I was nailed for wire transfer fees! You can be sure any American resort or business is going to want to be paid in US funds. I can understand the OP frustration trying to get a check in Canadian funds in the US. Our banks just aren't set up for it. I don't see why the resort or whatever won't take a US funds check for a deposit, then add on to the balance any losses due to exchange rates or bank charges. The guest can then pay his balance in Canadian funds when he arrives."
1287672,Freytown,2011-03-27 17:32:00,770,"Obabikon, well said. The owner has the final say as to what they accept as payment (currency).This spring I paid a deposit of CA$ 700 & the owner accepted my US$ check. After their bank fee's & exchange rate my deposit was CA$ 32.80 short which I will make up when I get to camp.Why would anyone think that the owner should absorb these costs is beyond me. I find it hard to believe the original poster could not find a bank to purchase an international draft in CA$.My concern this spring is gas at $3.59 vs $2.59 last summer...that's an increase of aprox 39%. Now that's real $$money."
1287781,v-bay gord,2011-03-27 21:36:00,3168,"I defend my right to be a nob, or a knob, have a chip on my shoulder, drink Canadian beer and revel in my publicly financed health care system!"
1287803,teddi,2011-03-28 03:08:00,349,try using canadian money in iowa or south dakota or most other states and see what happens. most americans expect canadians to take their money with no questions.
1288001,Jack77,2011-03-28 14:10:00,168,I would be willing to bet that I pay far less for my privately funded health care and I have far more access to better care. It probably won't be for long but I guess that is the price that we pay for progress..............wait a minute. Hope and Change baby ! gotta love it.I do support your right to be whatever type of knob you want and certainly your right to drink any type of beer you choose.

1287363,downriverbob,2011-03-26 19:47:00,880,I looked back at the exchange rates for the past 5 years at no time has it at .92 and it is curently at .9813 per 1 Canadian dollar. I don't know where people get their information. Bob
1287376,walleye4life,2011-03-26 20:30:00,54,"Bob, On November 7th,2007 the USD$$ was worth .90 cents Canadian. An all time low vs the usd/cad."
1287395,Outfitter17,2011-03-26 21:39:00,127,"ScottB,After reading your posts it seems to me you may be renting a private cottage and the owners may be skipping collecting/paying the taxes and only want canadian checks, so there will be less of a paper trail. Maybe you should check into why they are being so difficult. I get us drafts in canadian funds all the time from my US bank and there is never a problem."
1287402,v-bay gord,2011-03-26 22:07:00,3168,"I think the point that was being made (I don't want to put words in Jinx's mouth but..) was that now Canadians get a break on travel, purchases in the US.....where I believe we get to pay your taxes."
1287504,retire55,2011-03-27 09:39:00,1029,"FYI here are some historical exchange rates (USD vs CAD) 2 Jan 2002 A USD was equivalent to 1.60 CAD 2 Jan 2003 A USD was equivalent to 1.57 CAD 2 Jan 2004 A USD was equivalent to 1.29 CAD 4 Jan 2005 A USD was equivalent to 1.23 CAD 3 Jan 2006 A USD was equivalent to 1.16 CAD 2 Jan 2007 A USD was equivalent to 1.16 CAD 2 Jan 2008 A USD was equivalent to 0.99 CAD 2 Jan 2009 A USD was equivalent to 1.21 CAD 4 Jan 2010 A USD was equivalent to 1.04 CAD 4 Jan 2011 A USD was equivalent to 1.00 CAD Average exchange rate over these dates for the USD was 1.226 CAD.

1287527,scotttheguide,2011-03-27 10:40:00,73,"The bottom line is a weak US dollar does not help anyone. It hurts Tourism on both sides of the border. All the gas stations, resturants, hotels and stores on the way up to Canada that count on heavy traffic during the season are impacted as well as the Outfitters in Canada. There are alot less people going to canada for many reasons, but from the response I get at all the outdoor shows here in the states its not the value of the dollar, its the DUI issue that is stopping alot of fishermen that want to go up and fish. Guys that really enjoy going to Canada and enjoying the Outdoors don't care about the exchange rate. Besides that you can't take it with you when lay down for the dirt nap, but the memories of a trip can stay in your soul for ever. I say sc**w it, come on up, Let's go fishing. eh!"

1287554,Obabikon,2011-03-27 11:58:00,2370,"I'm not sure what the point in arguing about an ""exchange rate"" is. If you don't want to have to pay in Canadian funds... lucky for you, you don't have to. Go to one of the THOUSANDS of resorts in Ontario that takes US funds. While the costs are going to be going up... that's not really Canada's fault. While we do have to deal witht he consequences, we're not devaluing or even really increasing the value of our own currency. Not to get political, but the real problem is Ben Bernacke just printing off money like it won't cause a problem. It's just deflating the value of US citizen's currency. As far as the owners not wanting to accept US funds... that's their choice. Nothing wrong with it. Some people provide that service and some don't. Personally, it adds a lot of risk for Canadian owners to accept american funds. This summer the US dollar could be worth $.90 or $1.10 and nobody would be too suprised. that's a 20% swing. If you only accept Canadian funds (no exceptions) then there's never a problem when it comes bill time."

Not to get political, but the real problem is Ben Bernacke just printing off money like it won't cause a problem. It's just deflating the value of US citizen's currency. How else is Obama going to pay for massive government expansion. Destruction of our way of life is his goal. As far as the owners not wanting to accept US funds... that's their choice. Nothing wrong with it. Some people provide that service and some don't. Personally, it adds a lot of risk for Canadian owners to accept american funds Alot of risk,what the blank do you mean by that? When the Canadian dollar is the world standard then you can worry. Maybe you should ban Americans if our going there is so risky. Maybe the Chinese will start going to Canada for vacation. Wait til we get Obamacare. Then where are you going to go when you need something done now,not standing in line for years and then be told ,sorry quota is filled."
1287185,ScottB,2011-03-26 09:46:00,11,"We are renting a cottage in Ontario for a family vacation in July and the owners of the cottage require that we pay with checks made out in Canadian dollars. I asked my bank if I could get a cashiers check in Canadian dollars and they said no. The post office has International money orders but again, those are in US dollars. Has anyone else run into this? Is there an easy way to get a money order or cashiers check made out in Canadian dollars in the US?Thanks,Scott"
1287194,JinxCanada,2011-03-26 10:06:00,1306,any bank should be able to do that or the post office. or you could just use a credit card. sad for you guys since your dollar is now worth only about $0.92 but I think it's a nice and fair turn around for us :-)
1287222,adempsey,2011-03-26 11:20:00,963,That's the first I heard of any Canadian business not wanting American dollars. Is it because you wanted to pay by personal cheque??
1287224,ScottB,2011-03-26 11:33:00,11,"No, they wanted checks, just in Canadian dollars. The owners say if they deposit the US check in thier Canadian account, they have to pay 2 or 3% conversion fee, plus whatever the exchange rate is. I offered to send 4% extra to cover this and settle up exactly with cash when we get there in July, but no go. They also don't take credit cards.So far, I've called 2 additional banks here in Cincinnati and nobody can make out a cashiers check or money order in Canadian dollars. This shouldn't be that difficult"
1287225,Skywagon,2011-03-26 11:34:00,1106,"Here is a site you can use to check US-Canadian $ values http://www.xe.com/ucc/ . There is a fee from banks when you convert either way, so not only the exchange rate enters into it, but the fee as well. If a Canadian would take a US check for face value, he would lose money."
1287231,Skywagon,2011-03-26 11:48:00,1106,"Scott, We must have both replied at the same time. Another option is to wire money to his bank account. I do this on a regular basis from my bank in the US to my bank up here. You will have to coordinate with the cottage owner, get his routing number and information your bank will need to for the wire. My bank charges $25 for the wire. If you would like more info, PM your e-mail and I will respond."
1287238,v-bay gord,2011-03-26 12:12:00,3168,"I agree, it shouldn't be that difficult for the owner to accept a U.S. cheque. Add on a percentage to cover the costs and all should be good. If they can't extend you that courtesy, then you might consider a new location for subsequent trips. One alternative......exchange some U.S. cash for Canadian and then pay your bill in cash."
1287241,adempsey,2011-03-26 12:16:00,963,"Ya, that's what I would do as well. If they don't try to work with you a lot more on this I would just go someplace else. Why would someone make it so difficult to get paid????"
