On a bright sunny day in northern ontario, fishing for walleye, what colors do most of you use? On a cloudy, rainy day which colors do most of you use? We always catch fish, it just seems that there are times when the fish are there but do not bite. Any help would be great. Thanks"
1285560,Guest,2011-03-22 17:31:00,0,on sunny days chrome silver and gold. on cloudy days chartrues or floresent orange. always seemed to work for me

1286065,Guest,2011-03-23 19:08:00,0,i troll 90%of the time for walley and pike i use canadian wigglers or hot n tots like i said sunny days shiny cloudy days bright colors. its worked for me for thirty some yrs.
1286337,Bigstorm,2011-03-24 12:06:00,799,"some of it may have to do with the water clarity where you are also. I fish a river system with stained water for the most part and tend to use brighter colors (chart, orange, pink) but I have seen people catch just as many (or more) fish than me using dark jigs (black/blue) with nothing being tied to sunny or cloudy skiesI make my own jigs and I just picked up some new colors for the paint and I was going to make up some of the darker colors and try it out this year."
1287947,SoulFulCry,2011-03-28 11:42:00,158,i use any type of 2 tone colour jigs brighter colours most day day or nite also some days the odd gold n silver but the red knuckle ball jigs i have used worked great at any time of day. also am goin to try the new vmc mooneye jigs this yr n the thumper jig as well pretty much any style of jig will work adjust ur jiggin motions n cadences through out the day for varied results
1289381,jWN,2011-03-31 19:34:00,62,Yellow number 3 lazy ike with red dots works any day for me trolling if jigging a yellow twister is first follwed by a white twister.
