The map had a color code for frozen, or open, along with ice out dates, average, earliest, latest. To see if the lake was open, rolling your cursor over the lake would tell you if it is open or frozen. Is there a similar web site for Ontario?"

If your not going too far north of the border, you can also use the polar orbiting satellite link to check on ice out progress. When you click into a region and then zoom in, you can actually see the cracks in the ice! Alanb"
