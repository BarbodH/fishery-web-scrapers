I'm wondering how much benefit there would be to install a couple of downriggers on my boat? I know I've read several posts where people catch them without downriggers, but I want to put everything in my favor. Is it a big advantage to fish with downriggers that time of the year, or not really? Any advice is welcome. Thanks!"

At that time the water will still be cold, or just beginning to warm a little, so the trout will be shallow. In my opinion, down riggers would be nothing but a pain, and would probably have you fishing under the fish in deeper water than they are feeding in. Long line Rapala CDs, Shad Raps, Husky Jerks, Canadian Wigglers, etc., and don't be afraid to troll through water as shallow as 8'-10' when rounding the points. If you find shallow shoreline water adjacent to deeper structure, so much the better. Silver, black/silver, and blue/silver are our go to colors. But, some days the lakers have also shown preference for some of the weirdest orange, green, yellow, purple, and other colors. A silver/blue Little Cleo, or a silver flutter spoon with a bit of weight, are also good choices. If you're marking trout on your electronics and want to have some real fun, shut down the boat and jig for them with a blade bait, like a Cicada or Sonic.The photo shows a nice bunch of lakers from a 1982 trip. That was a three fish per person limit. Now, where we fish, the possession limit is two. Good luck! There have been prior discussions here about trout fishing. Use the Search function on this sight and you should find lots of helpful info."
1291259,Outfitter17,2011-04-05 16:20:00,127,"Midwest,I agree with Jay, downriggers at that time of the year will be nothing more than a pain. They are great for july/aug. when the lakers are deep, but you can troll cranks during your trip and do just fine. With a normal to late ice out predicted, the trout will still be up shallow on your trip.Good Luck"
1291353,guidedfishing,2011-04-05 19:28:00,531,"agreed I fish down riggers all the time in the summer and fall, that time of year you would be better served with planer boards to get the spoon or stick bait out away from the boat. Depending on the water temps maybe mid June you could start getting some benefit from riggers. good luck GF"
1291611,midwest,2011-04-06 11:41:00,25,"What is shallow in lake trout terms? In the back of my mind I'm thinking it would be easier to troll at 20 ft with downriggers than it would to be to ""hope"" my rapala is diving to the 18 ft depth that the package says it will.Does anyone actually have downriggers on their boat, and choose not to use them early in the season? I guess what I'm getting at is that it is easy to say there is no advantage if you don't have them to try. I've read all the old posts about trolling shallow and vertical jigging in deeper water, but there is not a lot of info out there on using downriggers...probably because most people don't have the option of using them?I appreciate everyones advice so far. I'm listening to all of it, just trying to make sure I put myself in the best position to catch fish, especially on Minnitaki which is not known for large numbers of fish....but does have some big ones! If I was fishing a lake that had large numbers of 3-7 lb trout, I would probably just forget the downriggers and expect to catch some fish trolling shallow, but I can't help but think the downriggers would make life easier even trolling at ""shallow"" depths of 20 ft."

1291655,Jack77,2011-04-06 13:20:00,168,That is my philosophy on everything when I am planning for the Canadian fishing trip that I have been looking forward to ALL FLIPPING YEAR!
1291936,KEEBOY,2011-04-07 07:24:00,61,Our group travels to NW Manitoba the first week in June and with late ice out we have caught them in very shallow water trolling for walleye. Talking 4-6 foot of water. With late ice out it seems they are apt to be anywhere on the lake and we have a difficult time locating them on such a large lake. However if the ice goes out in early to mid May then they will be moving into the deep part of the lake and we will catch them in 20-35 foot of water using bottom bouncers and J13 jointed raps. Blk and silver seems to be the hot color for us but others have worked. You could try to use down riggers but the fish typically seem to be right on the bottom and the depth varies so much that you would be constantly adjusting your down rigger depth. With that we use about a 3 or 4 oz bottom bouncer with about a 6 foot leader back from that. Also it seems you have to troll extremely slow. I basically just put my kicker motor in gear and let it idle. The raps will have just a very slow wobble but they do work well. That is what works for us. Hope that helps.
1291993,jsmyers,2011-04-07 09:12:00,198,"Anybody use flatfish or kwikfish?I've got a handful of them in various colors. Some have been in my dad's tackle box as long as I can remember. I inherited other from my grandfather, and they are certainly older than I am.I don't remember having a lot of luck with them in late summer for pike.I recently read about using them for trout and salmon."
1292033,JayM5209,2011-04-07 10:22:00,1050,"They can be excellent lake trout lures . . . . if you're using a boat/motor combo that allows you to troll very slow. Too much speed and they'll start to twist and spin. But, then, some days you can't troll too slowly for the lakers. I use with a three way rig - three way swivel on the main line, 4' leader to the lure, and a 2'-3' dropper line for the weight. Vary the weight to get to any depth you want. Early season before the water warms up I'll run one just 4' or 5' below the surface."
