1288850,Kruger,2011-03-30 13:12:00,259,Do they hatch in May anywhere? Here in Alabama they do in April usually.
1289031,Eyes_R_Us,2011-03-30 20:09:00,66,Well I did some checking today and realized there is no way I can be away from work that week. So now I'm going July 30 through Aug 6. I have never been up there that late and there may be a good reason for that. I'm going to print this thread off and put it in my Canada folder though - lots of great information about fishing the mayfly hatch. Come to think of it when I was previously there during a hatch the only place we caught them was in moving water using a small chunk of crawler on a small gold spinner rig. If I would have been smart enough to recognize that as a pattern I probably could have done a lot better.
1289054,rather-be-fishin,2011-03-30 21:10:00,429,"I went to Lac Seul last summer same week you are now going and I'm am going the same week this year. We had the BEST EVER walleye fishing last summer in both size and numbers in 8 years of going to Lac Seul and can only hope for the same this year! But as is said earlier in this post, weather patterns are the key as to how the fish will bite! Good luck to you and hope your trip to Eagle is great! Four months to the day and counting down to our yearly trip back to Lac Seul! YAHOO! RBF"
1289313,Sutsgold,2011-03-31 16:44:00,219,"Eyes, I fish eagle that time of year. Fishing is usually excellent. Walleyes on deeper reefs. Plenty of them on this lake. We will be on the east side fishing the basin. Best of luck"
1289357,ManitowishWaters,2011-03-31 18:20:00,39,Been going to Canada that week for 12 years or more. Good weather normally pretty stable....can get real hot. Walleyes on 20-30ft reefs jig and minnow.
1289548,SeulAreaWalleye,2011-04-01 08:54:00,100,"The hatch is something that I and fellow guides have mastered, and it has become one of our favorite fishing times for ridiculous numbers. I have way too many productive bug hatch spots, so maybe hiring a guide for a day will help you beat the hatch. My only suggestion to frustrated anglers who have a tough time beating the bugs is to give up on the normal haunts, and start throwing for pike.....you may be quite surprised! No worries about which week to book, they are all great when you know where the fish will be at all times!"
1288567,Eyes_R_Us,2011-03-29 19:33:00,66,Well I have done it again - I waited too long to make reservations and the camp I normally go to (Eagle Lake) only has the last week in June open. Seems like there is a reason why that week is always the last one fill up and I'm thinking it is Mayflies. One year I went that week and the mayflies were in full swing. I could have stayed home that week and caught more fish. Is the last week of June a typical peak for Mayfly hatch in that area? I'm trying to decide if I should book the week anyway or just do something different this year.
1288582,walleye4life,2011-03-29 19:58:00,54,It's been hard to time the hatch the last 2 years...2 years ago we had a record ice out as far as being lateand last year was a record as far as being early...this year is looking like a late ice out.... my 2 cents.
1288610,ILScott,2011-03-29 20:48:00,139,One of my best years in Canada was during a mayfly hatch. They were floating everywhere but the walleye were biting. Used a gold hammered spinner rig with a quarter inch of worm and that is all it took.
1288611,J-Man,2011-03-29 20:52:00,191,I've never had a group call or say they didn't want a particular week in June because of mayflies here on LOTW. A decent weather pattern will always be the most important element in how hot the bite is or isn't.
1288675,Bigstorm,2011-03-30 06:27:00,799,"Last year I was on the English River system (near Lount & Seperation Lakes) durign the 3rd week in June. Day 1 - no mayflies and we did good in some of our usual spots that are slack water. Day 2 = mayfly hatch and we couldnt buy a bite in the slack water areas we caught fish in the day before. Took a little time and traveling but we found the active fish. They were in areas of high current. We averaged 1 walleye in the boat every 5 minutes over the course of 4hrs (counting everything from 10"" to upper 20's"").Maybe we just got lucky, but finding current meant finding active fish"
1288681,Obabikon,2011-03-30 06:44:00,2370,"Look at it this way... mayflies are going to happen one of three weeks. At this point, there is no way to know. Weather patterns will move them around. I agree with Justin in that even if you're in the middle of the hatch, you should be able to catch walleyes. (at least that's the case on LOTW's)"
1288729,v-bay gord,2011-03-30 08:42:00,3168,"My experience on Eagle is that the mayfly hatch can be variable in terms of timing and quantity.....it also occurs at different times depending on what section of the lake you are on (shallow water warming first). I also think the weeks leading up to the visible hatch and the early stages of it, offers some of the best shallow walleye action of the season. It becomes more challenging when the hatch drags on for weeks, but overall I think this a period when walleye have the feed bag on, and their habits and locations are pretty predictable. Rather than fearing this period.......embrace it !!"
1288746,woods,2011-03-30 09:25:00,646,"Our group always goes to that area the 3rd week in June, and I don't recall ever seeing the hatch occur then."
1288770,Golden Eagle,2011-03-30 10:18:00,2642,"Moving water is a cure for many types of slow bites.Day after a major hatch, try fishing the wind blown shoreline. Hundreds of walleyes will be in shallow water taking an easy meal. They won't be hogs, but you'll pick up plenty of eaters.I enjoy sitting in a bay of flat water, when the hatch begins, and watching whitefish slurp dinner from the surface. Pick up your flyrod and offer them a dry fly."
1288787,Moosebunk,2011-03-30 11:04:00,211,Head to Northeastern Ontario where they call them Shadflies... same thing but at least you won't be concerned with Mayflies.
