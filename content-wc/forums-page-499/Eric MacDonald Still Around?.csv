1291311,NP4ME,2011-04-05 18:15:00,378,Glad you are still around! I saw some old posts of yours that talked about the Manitou. I'm headed up with a group this summer for the first time. We are going the first week of July. Any tips or pointers you might be able to help out with?
1291620,Guest,2011-04-06 11:52:00,0,What are you targeting? Where are you staying? I am going june 9 and probably late august or early september. Eric
1291659,NP4ME,2011-04-06 13:38:00,378,Staying at Camp Manitou. I will be targeting musky and smallies. I know several from our group will want to catch northerns.
1291818,Guest,2011-04-06 19:44:00,0,"Dont fish that for up so I cant help for the manitou stretch. I fish between the lower and the upper manituo mainly, I think they call it the narrows. Olsen is good for muskie. Glass bay is polluted with smallies. I like about 10 feet of water with rocks that time of year, I do best on jigs with a 3-4 inch grub. I prefer zoom watermelon seed but other colors work well too. I use a 1/4 to 3/8 oz. jig and fish it real slow, hard to do if windy. Usually tear em up that way. you must feel the jig as you work it, if not then you miss many. other stuff works for smallies to including topwater(tiny torpedo, my favorite) x raps, rattletraps, and mepps 3 in line spinners and i'm sure others also. Muskys should be in weeds which should be growing pretty well by them, Not a numbers lake but we have multiple fat 50 plus inch fish at our camp. Some of our favorite lures are black or white buchertails, AC Shiner 675's, bulldawgs, magnum Xraps. Got to keep on plugging, just when you are asleep you will miss a monster. I catch more pike early and late so I can't help you there besides I don't like those things. Bass fishing gets better every year and with the muskie that keeps me happy"
