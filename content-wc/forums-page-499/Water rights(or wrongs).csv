1292398,JinxCanada,2011-04-08 09:21:00,1306,"that's quite a bit different and there are strick rules regarding trailers, boats, and any other vehicle for non-residents."
1292578,Fish_Heads,2011-04-08 17:24:00,154,"The person who owns our lodge we go to every year in Ontario is a non resident from Wisconsin......has a whole fleet of boats up there & several quads.........but he did buy them in Canada, so apparently non residents can register boats in Ontario.Fish"
1292596,Skywagon,2011-04-08 18:40:00,1106,"Before becoming a permanant resident of Canada, I owned a boat and trailer that I registered and plated in Ontario using the US address. My lake neighbor from California, owns boats, trailer and a Jimmy, all registered, plated in Ontario and kept here legally, year around."
1291090,JinxCanada,2011-04-05 07:49:00,1306,If you are a non resident and didnt' have an E-99 from Canada Border Services Agency we could have seized your boat as well. Make sure your paper work is in line. :-)
1291093,JinxCanada,2011-04-05 07:54:00,1306,"You are breaking the law by leaving your boat in Canada. You are ONLY permitted as a ""non resident"" to leave your boat here durring the season WITH an E-99..but the boat must be removed each year unless being left for service with an authorized center. I suggest you follow the rules unless you'd like your boats seized....unless of course you properly IMPORTED your boat paid taxes on it and licenced it IN Canada"
1291183,Aaron-IN,2011-04-05 11:52:00,500,"What if you are a ""non-resident"" property owner in Ontario with boats registered from your home state?"
1291188,Outfitter17,2011-04-05 12:10:00,127,"Aaron,Jinx is right, you need the E-99 form for the boats that stay up in canada all summer and they need to be removed at the end of the summer and brought back home with you. You need to have them reregistered in ontario to keep them here year round."
1291202,JinxCanada,2011-04-05 13:11:00,1306,"The answer is still NO. you can NOT leave your boat here under any circumstance other than if it needs repair (and then only for a total of one year) sorry.form E-99 is usually only good until Oct 31 of each year and begin March 31 or so. The only other option is to import the boat, pay the taxes, RIV fees register it here and import the trailer. I'm not even sure if you could do that though since you are a non resident. Contact the CBSA for any further information you might need."
1291206,jiggster,2011-04-05 13:19:00,183,I had to pick up a E 99 form last year. Took about 5 minutes at customs. I was told I had to leave the boat on the trailer with the form attached.
1291213,JinxCanada,2011-04-05 13:36:00,1306,You can tape it to your winshield of your boat if you leave it in teh water. I've never read any regulation about the boat having to be on the trailer while you are out of Canada between visits.
1291696,Aaron-IN,2011-04-06 14:44:00,500,"I guess it doesn't matter, the boats I leave up there year round are registered in Ontario anyway. I never leave my ""Indiana"" boat up there all year."
1291933,JinxCanada,2011-04-07 07:12:00,1306,Interesting. I was not aware that a non resident could register a boat in Ontario.
1291985,tackleman,2011-04-07 08:58:00,444,"up our way, the americans buy a lot of boats and motors and register them in Ontario and leave them here. Basically they are a canadian boat. the place of residence doesn't matter to the government as long as they get their tax dollars."
1266707,Pymbet,2011-01-31 12:14:00,42,"I think the risk of portagers coming on to your fly-in lake is one you just have to live with. I have never seen an outfitter advertise anything more than they are the only cabin on the lake. To me, asking a portager to leave sounds over the line, just make the best of it and don't come back.The boat cache discussion is also enlightening. We are US residents and have three boats left on two barely accessible lakes in northern Ontario. Two of them are on our favorite, little pike lake and have been sitting there for ten years. From what we can tell, the lake gets little to no traffic from the locals (although we regularly boat pike in the upper thirties and as big as 42""). We fully know that one year, we may get up there and the boats will be gone, crushed by a fallen, tree or eatin by beavers. But I hope that they aren't flown out by the MNR (that's the only way they are coming out now that the logging roads are overgrown). And I certainly hope there isn't an international manhunt for us as the owners."
1266821,Skywagon,2011-01-31 18:19:00,1106,"I have seen boats on different remote lakes with ax holes through them. No idea if the MNR did it, but I guess who ever owned the boats got the point. To many new logging roads makes it easy to get boats into these places. There are a limited amount of boat caches for a reason."
1266838,v-bay gord,2011-01-31 18:43:00,3168,"As long as they don't interfere with someones ""legitimate"" operation on the lake then there is likely no issue........but a u.s. registered boat with no mnr sticker would be fair game for any boat bounty hunter out there....."
1266904,81Saluki,2011-02-01 04:30:00,97,"Interesting info here regarding caches. We own property on a lake north of Vermilion Bay (not a portage/fly-in lake). The cabin is boat access only so we bring our ""big boat"" with us each spring and leave it at the cabin throughout the summer. Between trips, we take our ""little boat"" -- which stays there year-round -- to the public landing and leave it on shore in the bush so we can get to the cabin on our return trip. Makes me wonder if we need a cache permit to do so. Hmmm. I'd sure hate to arrive one day and find it missing!"
1267158,Guest,2011-02-01 16:50:00,0,"With the outfitters trying to run a business and the MNR trying to protect the remote areas, there is limited access to many lakes in Ontario. You are always allowed to access these lakes, you just have to tread lightly..ie...portage, hike or fly, not by atv or 4 wheel drive. You may not use roads to access certain lakes. This allows people to still enjoy the remote areas without worrying about a jet ski whizzing by, outfitters can still contribute to the economy and the wildlife is left undisturbed. As long as us, non-residents, have the right permits to use crown land in Canada and you obey any laws regarding no road access you will have a fantastic time. I know I will be heading up to my favorite Canadian lake this summer and treading lightly!"
1267231,v-bay gord,2011-02-01 20:56:00,3168,"I think the MNR are mainly concerned about the boats where someone complains. There are plenty of boats left that eventually just become part of the scenery...they've been there so long. As a land owner you might be able to get a sticker for your boat, especially if it was for transportation purposes to and from your cabin."
1268897,Fishoil,2011-02-07 14:18:00,1277,"Last year we portaged into a lake that our outfitter had boats cached on that also had a fly-in cabin on it. It wasn't an easy trip in, there were 4 portages varying from about 100 yards to 1/4 mile. The cabin looked like a great place to take our group, so I tracked down the owners and contacted them. I found out it was a private cabin and they didn't rent it out. It was a somewhat chilly conversation when the owners realized I had been fishing on ""their"" lake."
1290607,Minnow Man,2011-04-04 07:30:00,85,"Found this on the Dryden CKDR News web Site. Balmertown Man Convicted of Violations Posted by Mike Ebbeling on Friday, April 1st, 2011 pm 5:15:20 PM A Balmertown man has been ordered to pay $1,600 for two violations on Crown Land. Matthew Kehoe was convicted for unlawfully caching 6-aluminum boats on Crown Land and keeping a boat cache in a conservation reserve. Court heard that Kehoe left the boats at several remote lakes north of Red Lake, without the proper permits. The Province seized a boat and motor in the case. The value of a lesson learned is determined by how much the lesson cost you. This lesson is worth remembering. Minnow Man"

1291028,Tonyo,2011-04-04 23:01:00,212,"The conversation is pretty interesting to me since I just finished reading everyone's replies but deep down inside I needed to say that when we go to Canada I am not going to work that hard. I realize it is an adventure but I am on vacation and if I can catch one walleye after another, I don't see myself dragging a boat for a couple of miles to get to a remote lake. Just my thoughts. TonyO"
1265204,Golden Eagle,2011-01-26 19:16:00,2642,"Minnow Man, sounds as though you ran into Fish Cop, Don Maw. He works hard at his job."
1265229,v-bay gord,2011-01-26 21:05:00,3168,"That is harsh, but good on you for taking it on the chin. If the MNR dude ""Don Maw"" was responsible, then all I can say is he is one heck of a c.o. !"
1265262,teddi,2011-01-27 03:42:00,349,in ontario there is what is called the 21 day rule. you can leave a boat on crown land for 21 days with out taking it out.
1265289,Aaron-IN,2011-01-27 06:54:00,500,You aren't allowed to just leave the boat there for sure. You could have requested a permit from the MNR. I did that a few years ago on a super secret hot spot lake and they granted me a permit. Granted this is a fairly small lake as lakes in Ontario go.
1265310,fishman10,2011-01-27 07:42:00,226,"this has been a problem on fly in outpost lakes for years. the logging companies have cut close to lakes with outpost cabins, therefore providing easy access to nonpaying fishermen. the people that have flown in were being met by a lake full of people that are portaging in for free. i live in thunder bay and have boats in several lakes in the graham area. the m.n.r. then posted the roads with signs stating- no motorized access beyond this point, these signs being several miles from the access points. i have since removed my boats and do not fish these lakes any more as the m.n.r. has caught us in there and we were fined. there is certain access around the back side of certain lakes through creeks. these creeks are not posted and we access these lakes legally this way. i can understand the outpost owners concern over this. he gets a group of fishermen to fly in and they run into other nonpaying boats. well guess what, these people dont come back with this outfitter, and i cant blame them. but if you can enter these lakes legally then there is nothing that the guests can do."
1265363,v-bay gord,2011-01-27 10:03:00,3168,"I think the ""21 day rule"" is you have 21 days to remove your boat (once tagged by the MNR) before they will confiscate it.......it doesn't mean you have a right to leave it there illegally for 21 days. There is a difference."
1265368,Wade B AKA: Ruger2506,2011-01-27 10:21:00,5533,"As long as no laws were broken, you were not in the wrong. Logging roads and technology is making access easier to these ""inaccessible"" lakes. These outfitters need to learn to adapt to survive. Just like every other business."
1265461,Northern Exposure,2011-01-27 14:43:00,29,"Correct me if I am wrong, but I believe River Otter knew he was there legally. I believe his question is more of a fishing ethics question. Should he have left and gave them the space they paid for. I think that is up to the individual. If you were there to fish I believe you should have stayed, but if you were there just to mess with these guys you should have moved on."
1265468,dutchboy,2011-01-27 15:07:00,5717,"Sounds like he was willing to move on. At least until they copped a attitude with them. Unless this lake was the size of a bath tub I'm sure there was plenty of room for both parties.Some people just want to show you how smart and important they ""think"" they are. Those are the one's to have fun with! Good job."
1266166,Guest,2011-01-29 22:14:00,0,The 21 day rule applies to camping units not boats. Non residents cannot leave a boat unattended on crown land overnight. Period. Non-residents can buy crown land camping permits and camp as long as they want with their boat but at no time can they leave their boat on a lake while they go back to sleep in a motel. If they do that boat can be seized by the crown immediately. Residents of Ontario can get a private boat cache permit for a lake if the MNR OKs it. They must personally use that boat though. If a friend is found using it without the agreement holder present - boat cache is gone.
1264719,Guest,2011-01-25 14:13:00,0,"We have been camping on the same lake for the last couple of years in Northwest Ontario, there are a couple of feeder streams to this lake that we always wondered if they were passable. So last year 4 of us decided to head up the stream to see if we could get to the next lake. At first there were several obstructions we had to portage around but it wasn't bad at all(we've been through a lot worse). Once past these it was smooth sailing, had to drag the boats over rocks and trees several times but we were making better time than we thought. We made it to the lake a couple of hours before dark and there was a nice open sand beach waiting for us. We had kept a couple northern we had caught so we sent up a tent and cooked up the fish, planning on fishing this lake in the morning and for the next 3 days. Next morning we go out fishing and here comes a boat cruising up to us. They say they are with a fly-in outfit, we tell them we came up the river, we chat for a while and away they go. About an hour later here comes three boats up to us, this time not so chatty and you could tell by the look on their faces they were serious. They tell us we have to leave because they were told they would be the only ones on the lake and they paid ALOT for it. We said we would stay the rest of the day and leave in the morning because we would never make it back to our camp before dark if we left at that time. That is not what they wanted to hear, they began arguing and being very rude. So we said it's crown land and we would stay the 3 days like we intended. After that hey kept to their end of the lake and we kept to ours for the next 2 days and never spoke again. This hanging in the back of my head now planning this years trip. Anyone who ever portaged a boat knows the work involed, this was an easy one but still exhausting. My question is were we wrong to stay? Should we have to leave after all of that work to get there, we had no idea there was a outpost on it? These guys looked like older, upper class, corporate types with all the fancy clothes and gear, just because they have money are they entitled to it? We would have left if not for their rudeness. If you are going on a flyin located 6 miles off of a road and the river out of the lake goes to the road wouldn't you figure there is a chance someone could come up it? P.S. The fishing was good but nothing special, we've found better."
1264733,Fisherman Ted,2011-01-25 15:03:00,461,"Interesting situation you found yourself in.I am a new lodge owner and as such have what they call ""cache agreements"" on many lakes in NorthWestern Ontario, all associated with my lodge. This agreement with the MNR means as a business I am allowed to cache a boat on each lake (i.e. leave it there for guest use). I am the only business/entity that has such an agreement for each lake.That being said, I am told that there is no preclusion from others portaging in boats for a day and using the lake. The water is owned by the crown and if you can portage a boat there then by all means you are allowed to use the lake. This happens from time to time and that's fine with me. Now I am of the understanding that while someone could carry their canoe into the lake to fish they are not allowed to keep the boat there.So, I would think that it is acceptable for you to bring your boat in and fish for a day and probably not okay to park it overnight and use it the next day or weeks. But I defer to more experienced owners out there for the final answer. I too am interested in the details, from a different perspective of course.Fisherman Ted"
1264749,Skywagon,2011-01-25 16:37:00,1106,"You were entitled to fish, the lakes are not for exclusive use. It is possible there can be more than one person to have a legal boat cache on a lake, it is common. I have a friend that flew into a remote lake where he has a legal boat cache, there is one outpost cabin on the lake. The guys staying at the outpost cabin came over and chewed on him (a Canadian) for fishing in their lake. They said the outfitter told them they were the only ones that could use the lake. Wrong!The real question is, if you are a non-resident, depending on where you were, did you have a camping permit if not sleeping on the boat? That is where you will get fined. If the guys staying with the outfitter knew that and had a satellite phone....."
1264757,Fisherman Ted,2011-01-25 17:40:00,461,"Yes, you absolutely can have multiple cache agreements on a lake. There can be dozens of caches on larger lakes.But the larger question is can someone come in and fish for multiple days on the same lake, thereby storing their boat on the lake. One day should be fine. But let's say it was a week someone stayed with their boat. Is that okay?Fisherman Ted"
1264758,guidedfishing,2011-01-25 17:40:00,531,"If you were on crown land and not in a area restricted to non-resident camping, and had your proper camping permits you had just as much right to be there, boat cache or not. good luck gf"
1264782,v-bay gord,2011-01-25 18:31:00,3168,"I believe the boat cache system allows you to leave your boat on a lake....in other words unattended until you decide to come back and use it. There are resident boat caches and commercial. If you are there camping with your boat (assuming there are no camping restrictions, and if you are a non resident you have a permit) then I think you may stay with the boat as long as you wish. I think some courtesy from both sides are in order, but it is a problem to someone selling remote fishing when these things happen."
1264999,phishfearme,2011-01-26 10:17:00,1242,the above responses are correct - for ontario! do not assume this is the case in quebec. there they have exclusive rights agreements to crown land and only people permitted by the exclusive rights owner can use the lakes. phish
1265047,Aaron-IN,2011-01-26 12:38:00,500,"You could have fished that lake as long as you wanted to as long as you took the boat with you when you left. The guys getting mouthy with you should be chewing the outfitter out, not you."
1265169,Bill Krejca,2011-01-26 18:01:00,6107,"Reminds me of the camping trip several of us took back in 1965 north west of Minaki. One day we headed upstream in the direction of Separation Rapids in my large white Thompson boat with the Iowa registration on the side. After traveling quite a distance, we ran into several boats fishing some current. The folks in the boats were very upset, due to the fact that they had been flown in, and didn't expect to see a boat that obviously had to have been trailered to the water! A couple of the guys were even from Cedar Rapids; they all were very angry, but only with their outfitter and asked how we had gotten there! We didn't get into the ""whose water is it"", though. Bill"
1265176,Minnow Man,2011-01-26 18:34:00,85,"Years ago had a tourist operator fly us into a great walleye lake North of Red lake Ont. Checked out the map & figured we could haul our own boat into the lake, we did it over a few days of hard work using 4 wheelers. We hid it in the bush & used it several times, before the M.N.R. found it and hauled it out with their Turbo Beaver. Took them 6 months to track me down to being the owner of the boat. Trust me you are not allowed to do this. I was court order to pay for the removal costs of the boat, had the boat confiscated, plus a fine. Wasn't one of my better ideas."
