Any walleye population increase can be results of stocking millions of fry/fingerlings with money raised with the CWA permit.If over-fishing and non-regulation is not a problem on the Gouin, why the need for a permit and why the stocking program???"
1284221,Freytown,2011-03-19 13:49:00,770,"The english version of Quebec's rules has been released on MRNF's website. The Gouin will NOT have slot limits. http://www.mrnfp.gouv.qc.ca/english/...w-elements.aspOne walleye less than 32 cm or more than 47 cm in length from the following waters (Note1 , Note5)The waters of zones 14, 15, 26, 28 and 29 excluding:the waters of the Communal Wildlife Area of Gouin reservoir (zone 14);the waters of the Communal Wildlife Area of Lac-Saint-Jean (zone 28);the waters of zecs Lesueur, Normandie, Mazana and De la Maison-de-Pierre (zone 15);the waters of zecs Borgia, Du Chapeau-de-Paille, De la Croche, Frémont, Du Gros-Brochet, Kiskissink and Menokeosawin (zone 26);the waters of Réserve faunique Rouge-Mattawin (zone 15) and of Ashuapmushuan (zone 28);the waters of parc national du Mont-Tremblant (zone 15)."
1284402,McQ,2011-03-20 05:29:00,615,"This is my simple interpretation for walleye keep limits on the Gouin. 8 fish in possession allowed 1 under 13"" allowed 1 over 18 1/2"" So I would take the approach of 14 - 18"" for the table and release everything else. That should take about an hour ( 15 minutes if you hit a pod ) on any given day. If a true trophy (30""+) is caught CPR and get a replica for the wall. I wish each and everyone one of you fishing the Gouin a very successful, fun and relaxing seasonal trip."
1285493,Guest,2011-03-22 14:47:00,0,"Maybe it would be good to protect the first time spawners, but I guess all in all I'm happy that the biggest spawners will hopefully get to spawn many times(once they get over 20). People here brag about a fish over twenty that's how rare they've become, so maybe it will take quite a few years to see a difference (I fish zone 4 and 7). People not respecting the law may also be an issue. The mentality here is way behind the times and game wardens are very scarce."
1285517,Mike Borger,2011-03-22 15:53:00,1554,Very very dissapointed. My water access camp is on a lake in zone 13 west.Nothing has changed!I don't consider increasing the minimum size by 2cm and keeping the limit at 6 to be of much use.Hopefully they'll implement the slot in ALL the heavily fished zones.What a joke.
1286309,Freytown,2011-03-24 10:50:00,770,"Let's face it; the earth is not getting any bigger. Any northern waterway today that can be driven into, can be over fished without regulations.Many of us travel very far distances to our destinations. Personally I enjoy the Canadian wilderness and the quiet time it offers. Adding to the pleasure is a decent fishing experience. That can mean different things to each angler. But no one likes to go each year & see the fishing degraded year to year.Fishing regulations are the only way to protect the resources. Most exclusive rights camps have realized this years ago and have very strict regulation. Why wait for a more serious problem to develop. I think that the current 5 yr plan is falling short on that respect."
1288507,trappage,2011-03-29 17:47:00,12,"Gimma a break get some more wardens out there, how many of you from Quebec have seen fisherman in and out bringing daily limits back to the camp and back out for another limitRegulate the natives up in Northern Quebec netting the spawning walleye and sturgeons in the spring.The slot idea for walleyes is a start, but with increasing price of fishing permits get some more wardens.....50 some odd days fishing three different waterways average 8 hours each time no warden."
1288578,NEBRASKA JOHN,2011-03-29 19:48:00,179,Have you ever called a warden? Why not?
1289533,trappage,2011-04-01 08:38:00,12,"100 % you are right,, example ....hunting geese two years ago ...got guys next field counted approx 30 geese between 3 guys ....limit is fifteen buddy calls 1-800 poaching line game wardens show up three days later at his home.....not very effective.I agree with you though wish it was that easy.....but if anyone is from Quebec reading thread they will have to agree with me , if you see a warden get a lottery ticket you ll have just as many chances!!!!SAD BUT TRUE!!!"
1289611,Guest,2011-04-01 11:17:00,0,"I may be wrong, but I think the money from fishing permits just goes into the government's general revenue."
1291416,retire55,2011-04-05 21:50:00,1029,A Gouin representative returned my telephone call this afternoon. He informed me that there has never been a minimum length limit on the Gouin and there certainly won't be one in 2011. He added that their intention is to keep it that way (based on studies that show the Gouin walleye population has been expanding over the last 5 years).
1282503,Freytown,2011-03-15 06:39:00,770,"http://www.mrnfp.gouv.qc.ca/english/...ement-plan.jsphttp://www.mrnfp.gouv.qc.ca/english/...stion-dore.pdfSlot limits for walleye are finally a reality in Quebec. IMO, this will improve the size of walleye. It starts out as a five year plan (2011-2016).I'm for this...anyone against it??"
1282575,ohiojmj,2011-03-15 09:45:00,1262,"The large western zones that interest me have had 30 cm limit (11.8"") and now it's 32 cm (12.6""). We're not hard up for dinks, so it won't affect our catch. What does affect me is the requirements for transportation of fish. Now have to prove fillet is at least 20 cm. Hope I don't slip with the knife."
1282736,retire55,2011-03-15 15:33:00,1029,"The minimum length limit for walleye in the old regulations was 30 cm (11.8 inches) and was measured from the tip of the snout to the fork in the tail. The minimum length limit for walleye in the new regulations is 32 cm (12.6 inches) and is measured from the tip of the snout to the tip of the tail. Consequently, an insignificant change IMHO. The 2011-2016 Walleye Management Plan states: ""Yellow walleye is overexploited in approximately 30% of lakes that have been inventoried since 1988. It has been observed that population mortality rates have also risen by some 17% in the last two decades, indicating that there will continue to be population deterioration if catch pressure remains unchanged. Mature female abundance and fertility has also dropped by one-third in the past 20 years, and this has reduced the populations' reproductive potential. Catch quality has also been affected, since average size of fish caught has dropped by 20% during the same period of time."" Still, the Quebec MRNF chose to do nothing! The 2011-2016 Walleye Management Plan concludes: ""The management procedures that have been selected for the 2011-2016 walleye management plan will improve catch and population structures and lead to a greater abundance of spawners."" I can not agree with their conclusions. Based on Quebec MRNF publications I've read, female walleyes reach sexual maturity between 4 and 5 years of age in many Quebec inland lakes. Their length at those ages varies between 37.8 and 41.9 cm (14.5 and 16.5 inches). Consequently, establishing a new minimum length limit of 32 cm (12.6 inches) does nothing to improve catch and population structures and lead to a greater abundance of spawners. If the Quebec MRNF had any intestinal fortitude, they would establish protective slot limits that would ensure that most female walleyes would spawn 4 or 5 times. Such a protective slot limit might be 43 to 56 cm (17 to 22 inches). I believe the rationale for not implementing protective slot limits has been that the MRNF has been and continues to be convinced that neither fishermen nor outfitters would support such a management plan."
1282916,ohiojmj,2011-03-16 06:17:00,1262,"Thanks for pointing out the new measurement requirement Retire55. This minimum size of 12"" always made me wonder how it helps maintain the walleye population. While we primarily target pike, we have caught a good number of walleye trolling in Remigny and Des Quinze and must say the average size was probably only a dinky 17"". And without the limit, would fishermen really be keeping 10"" walleye? Guess my close proximity to Lake Erie slants my vision on these tiny sizes."
1282937,Freytown,2011-03-16 07:03:00,770,My fishing experiences in Quebec have been limited to zone 14 (Gouin) since the early 80's. Over these years I have seen the size & quantity fall. There has never been a size limit & as the fish got smaller I have seen too many fisherman keeping very small fish. The new regulation will stop the harvest of these small fish allowing them to reach sexual maturity.I am no biologist but I don't see the harm with the new regulation it's better than no regulation.

1283081,vteye,2011-03-16 14:15:00,812,How does a slot limit protecting fish under 12.6 inch improve the fishery when the old slot was 11.8 ? The fisheries people admitfirst time spawners are minimum of 14-16 inches? I too love Gouin.
1283110,Freytown,2011-03-16 15:31:00,770,"vteye, I don't remember the Gouin ever having a minimum size for walleye, at least not the last 30 years. Anyone remember a size limit at the Gouin?"
1283238,5 of Diamonds,2011-03-16 21:11:00,151,"I've fished the Gouin a half dozen times back in the late 80's/early 90's and noticed diminishing fish quality/quantity even during that time. Sadly, I believe it is way over fished and under regulated. I think the Quebec Walleye Management Plan is a step in the right direction even though it might not be perfect. From what I've seen, slot limits @ the Gouin were dependent on the size of one's cooler. This mentality needs to change."
1283446,Guest,2011-03-17 12:34:00,0,"I think the rules will have a big impact here in southern Quebec. You have to release fish under 14'' and those over 20.5'' . The report on the lakes here show a big drop off in population size the second the fish reach 12-13''. This has been way way overdue. I wonder when the will start to help the pike, perch, trout...."
1283800,vteye,2011-03-18 09:39:00,812,We last went up 3 years ago early during the closed spawning seasonat end of May. Quebec was making a recommendation on a slot but not mandatory. We did fair on under 20 inch fish with nothing over 4 pounds. MJSD - Agreed heading in the right direction but why not include the first time spawners?
