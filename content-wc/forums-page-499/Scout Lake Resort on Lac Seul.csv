We're staying at Scout Lake Resort that is connected to Lac Seul and was wondering if anyone has stayed at this camp. I've spoke to the folks at SLR and they seem nice, what's the camp like? Is the fishing any good on Scout Lake or do we have to travel to LS everyday? Hoping somebody has stayed there and can let me in on their experiences. Thanks in advance."
507314,Guest,2000-03-08 18:19:00,0,"Nate, Scout Lake Resort is a nice place and the owners are very nice people I've only been there once and haven't been back due to the poor fishing we had (it might just have been slow, but it was the worst I've done at Lac Seul and I've gone every year since 1988) (had a hard time catching enough for an occasional meal much less bringing some home and we fished spots 25+ miles from camp at the owners recomendation) (and everywhere in between) I hope this doesn't dampen your spirit and that my experience was just an isolated incident.Mike"
507315,Guest,2000-03-09 05:55:00,0,"Nate, As for Scout lake and bay area, that time frame is good for those waters. Although, save it for windy days. Lac Suel does get a lot of interest and rightly so. It is an interesting fishery,and one of the better ones you can drive to. Fish, Bay of the Islands, South Bay, McKenzie Bay and spend a day or two in Sunlight lake. Get a good map in town,(the one they provide for you is worthless) and ask Roman to draw safe travel routes to these locations. I would advise you to travel the first part of the week and during the mornings to the most distant areas and fish yourway back as the day progresses. Good FIshing, No Fish"
507316,Guest,2000-03-09 12:42:00,0,"No Fish,I ordered one of the maps from Smitty's in town, and the resort sent me one too. The only difference between the two maps was the logo of the business that sold it to me! Who should I see to get one of the ""good maps"" you recommend? I like your idea of traveling far then fishing your way back. What time of year do you go?"
507318,Guest,2000-03-09 18:56:00,0,"Nate, something I that would consider a ""must see"" when fishing on that end of Lac Seul is the waterfall located at south shore of the south bay of south inlet. (do you get the idea that you need to go as far south as possible) If you ask them about the waterfall at the resort, I'm sure they'll be happy to direct you. p.s. (we caught several Walleyes at the base of the waterfall)Mike"
507317,Guest,2000-03-10 06:55:00,0,"Dear Nate, The better maps are colored and have shades of blue bathametrics. The land and water are easier to seperate weith these maps.Youcan buy them at 4 Seasons tackle shop in Ear Falls. They are published by ICS(maps and publications) P.O Box435 Red Lake Ont. (807)727-3952. Get Northwest and Southwest sections. Good Fishing, No Fish"

Very nice place, not fancy but nice. Lizzy is great and so is eddie. Fish the two lakes where you are staying for pike. Fish near the docks after dinner with a bobber and a minnow or a leech. More info, drop me a line at [email protected]"
1291608,Guest,2011-04-06 11:30:00,0,"The dock fishing at Scout lake can be really really good. The water off their dock system is 14 feet deep. Bring your slip bobbers and put on a leech and enjoy. You will catch many walleyes, our biggest off the dock was 28-29 inches. My sons liked fishing on the main part of Lac Seul but they really wanted to come back to the resort and dock fish. Best hours for us were 4:00 pm to 9:30 pm, after that the mosquitos would carry us away."
1291740,digjig,2011-04-06 17:02:00,146,"Been to SLR 5 or 6 times. The only thing I don't like about SLR is trekking up the hill from the dock to the cabins (not a big deal). Scout Lake itself has eyes, perch and pike. The island to the right of the dock holds some decent pike. Casting towards shore to the left of the dock will also produce several pike. Straight across the lake from the resort is a small bay that will hold perch. The channel going out of Scout to Lac Suel often holds eyes in the current. I have seen a couple 26"" eyes caught off the dock. The ride to Lac Suel from camp is about 10 minutes in a camp boat. Pay attention on the ride out in the event you are fogged in on the way back. Cabins are fine. Not the Ritz, but plenty good for a fishing camp. We have always done a house keeping plan, so I cannot speak for the American plan cuisine. Lizzy is a great host and works hard to make sure everyone is taken care of. -DJ"

Incredible fishery, very clean & comfortable cabins, have had some success in Scout Lake for walleyes and pike, normally fish Bay of Islands, McKenzie, South Bay, Shanty Narrows just to name a few. Part of the fun is exploring finding new spots which we do every year. a good paper map is a must and if you have a hand-held gps there are Canada lake map chips which are a huge asset for navigation and to keep from getting lost. We have also made some great friendships as going the same week every year we see the same people coming back, I think that speaks well for both the resort & the body of water."
