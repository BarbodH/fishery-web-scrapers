5341449,bigdaddyguns,2017-02-18 14:13:00,608,I renewed my passport by mail a few months ago and the turnaround time was 2-3 weeks. I was surprised as the expected delay was quoted at 6 weeks.
5341473,wallydave,2017-02-18 14:32:00,2151,Just keep an eye on your pee bottle!

Well this time I can say working with Ontario's MNR online services was great! My old desktop froze up and I wasn't able to print out my license ! An email and phone call took care of the problem. In a week my new card and replacement license arrived in the mail! A new HP laptop will prevent this problem in the future! Anyone had a similar experience?"
5336233,team walleye,2017-02-15 18:23:00,336,Awesome to hear!
5336297,Camoclad,2017-02-15 19:12:00,628,"Didn't have a computer crash, but had an issue with the online system taking a payment and the same result was experienced. My credit card would not process the payment because it was an out of country request and I forgot to call the card service center and let them know about the purchase. I called MNR, explained what happend and they helped me get everything in order and corrected well ahead of our trip. The customer service was great!"
5336401,wallydave,2017-02-15 19:57:00,2151,Good to know they are willing to help out! We must be good for business!
5336577,Stringbean,2017-02-16 05:09:00,279,"I just renewed my outdoor card last month. It was a piece of cake to use the website. I think there are quite a few website companies that could use this as a prime example of something that really works. Now, all I have to do is come back and buy the license as we get closer to the trip date."
5336881,Bill Krejca,2017-02-16 07:30:00,6107,"I lost approx 2 hours of my life the first time I tried and failed via on line. Couldn't print, and was told ""TS"" by one bureaucratic computer authority, finally got override by phone to a sweet gal up there; she mailed my license to me. Bill"
5336889,pjshorthorn,2017-02-16 07:31:00,5654,"I renewed my outdoor card and purchased my license online last year. Easy Peasey. I laminated one copy of the license and printed a few extra copies as spares. The laminated copy and outdoor card stayed in the boat inside my dry bag, the paper copies stayed in the cabin in case I pulled a dumbsheet move and had the laminated copy blow out of the boat. Yup, I have lost a few things blowing out of the boat like nets, hats, maps, pee buckets, kids, fishing rods and some things I'm not willing to admit.When you buy your license online, you will need to have a current outdoor card in order to do so. If you don't, then you can renew it at the same time you purchase your license. Both items appear on the printout with the card being noted as a temporary card until the new one arrives in the mail. If the card doesn't arrive in the mail before your trip, you would be legal since it appears on your license.Edit:When you purchase online, if your CC company makes adjustments for the exchange rate, you will save a few dollars instead of paying in Canadian funds when purchasing once you get into Canada. I do kinda miss the old paper licenses I used to get.....I have every one from my trips in a frame that is displayed in the basement.Don't forget to check your passport expiration date. Just sent mine in as it expired in January. We will see how the US State Department does in terms of turnaround time. Boy, the new passport photo was not too flattering compared to the prior one 10 years ago Have a safe and great trip this season.PjShorthorn"

5340353,pjshorthorn,2017-02-17 20:35:00,5654,Thanks. If I couldn't feel any worse than I did before reading this....... You may want to check the cap on the pee bottle a few times each day on this year's trip. I wouldn't want to see you pee in your own boat again this year..... PjShorthorn
5340601,wallydave,2017-02-18 06:38:00,2151,If you can't play nice you can't go out and play!
