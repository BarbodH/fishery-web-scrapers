5326481,1K1MOA,2017-02-11 07:20:00,90,"It is advisable to thoroughly cook or hot smoke all fish to 140° F for at least five minutes, or freeze them at 0° F for 48 hours. So there is the official disclaimer. I eat a lot of raw saltwater fish, hardly ever fresh (with rare exception in past). I have always understood that freshwater fish carry bacteria and potentially microscopic parasites that may not be good for you. Not to mention things like ""beaver fever"" (giardia, etc. if any contact is made between your hand handling the outside of the fish and the filet. Just food for thought..."
5326657,Obabikon,2017-02-11 08:32:00,2370,"I have never tried raw walleye, but I would assume the lack of fat would mean not much flavor. Just thinking out loud."
5327169,Multispecies Guy,2017-02-11 12:50:00,447,"If memory serves from my military survival training 33 years ago, salt water fish, with a few exceptions like pufferfish, lion fish and a couple others, can be eaten raw with no ill effects. Freshwater fish need to be thoroughly cooked to kill parasites. Again, this is for survival situations and doesn't take into account things like PCBs and mercury which are deleterious over the long term. The liver from sharks, tuna and some other species can be toxic as well but I don't suspect we have many shark liver connoisseurs here."
5325745,andersaki,2017-02-10 15:25:00,1426,"We did pretty good with walleye on our home lake last fall. One day I was filleting about five walleye and cut out the cheeks. I brought them over to my neighbor. The next day I asked them how they were. He said that his (Japanese) wife took them, dunked them in lemon juice and ate them raw. He never got any, but she told him that they were delicious.Kind of a ceviche or sushi. I think that I'll have to try that myself next time. andersaki"
5325769,fishron,2017-02-10 15:34:00,317,"Walleye, 18 to -20 are the one's I look for in Southern Ontario and Quebec. These haven't gotten to big to lose any of the wonderful flavor that walleye are famous for. Perch, I like the larger 10 to twelve inchers but don't pass up the 7 to 9 inchers. Gutted and skinned and cooked in hot oil they curl up and match any shrimp dish I've ever had. The meat comes off the bones just fine. Pike are great from 26 to 32 inches. It takes time to learn how to make them boneless. Bass, don't eat them anymore but from clean water, 12 to 14 inches would be the size I'd go with. Crappie, 9 to 10 inches are great. Third only to channel catfish and walleye. Channel cats from clean water. No sense in comparing them. The best in my opinion but that's only my opinion. Trout, just had some today at Cracker Barrel. Always good to me but some don't care for them. Released a whole bunch last spring because the family doesn't care for them. The sleeper, Rock bass in the 9 to 11 inch category. Had a memorable shore lunch with a big bag my daughter and I caught on a trip with several others. I'll put them into the same category as Crappie. Bluegills and Pumpkinseeds, I've heard there good but for some reason I have to release them even if there 10 inches. Bon appetite."
5325777,Ricky Spanish,2017-02-10 15:41:00,1298,"Hmmm...even when nothing else is biting, we still manage to pull in some rock bass at our favorite lake in Iron County, WI. Thanks for the tip."
5325793,Multispecies Guy,2017-02-10 15:49:00,447,"Rock bass are great! I have cooked some for people who previously thought they were a junk fish. They are now believers. For you catfish enthusiasts, do you gut, skin and cook whole or fillet. If you fillet do you skin then fillet or fillet and then skin. I've always skinned first. Smaller fish get cooked whole and bigger fish filleted."
5325801,billy weaver,2017-02-10 15:49:00,470,"I agree with this, I usually bring home a limit of 17 to 18 when fishing Canada but that is because of more meat to share at home. At camp a mess of 14 to 15 is my choice."
5325905,pjshorthorn,2017-02-10 17:07:00,5654,"Yes sir. We have taken the cheeks out of walleyes for many years. Never have tried northern cheeks,but that may be something for me to look into this year. Walleye cheeks are amazingly tasty. PjShorthorn"
5325953,billy weaver,2017-02-10 17:26:00,470,"Catfish, the bigger ones I fillet. I usually don't keep the bigger ones as my family likes 12"" fiddlers (Our name for shorts). The fiddlers are skinned, gutted and the head cut off, tail and fins left on. The family all time favorite fish is a mess if Bluegill fillets 7"" to 9"" will do. As I said in a earlier post 14"" to 15"" walleye are great."
5326049,prov1800,2017-02-10 19:09:00,5010,"I have always preferred fish to eat on the smaller side.the least amount of time in a frying pan the better.having done hundreds of shorelunches consenses is that most guys like there fish crispy.thin fillets are much easier to do this with. This goes for most fish.for some of the guys that said they have never had smallmouth bass,its time to try them.our canadian waters produce great eating bass especially from some of the deep trout lakes."
5326329,Slushfish,2017-02-11 05:46:00,263,"Absolutely have to jump on the 14"" walleye band wagon. You can hurt yourself on those babies. Throw in some deep fried home fries with onions!"
5326361,kzoofisher,2017-02-11 06:02:00,5144,"15""-17"" walleye. 15 is the minimum here so I've never tried shorter 25"" smallmouth was ok but I'd rather eat pike 20""-25"" pike Stream trout 8""-12"" but I haven't kept one in decades. I cook them whole so not sure if they count in this thread. Same goes for perch."
5325185,Multispecies Guy,2017-02-10 10:47:00,447,"This topic came up in another thread and I didn't want to hijack it so I'll pose the question here---what is the perfect size fillet for eating? (I'm talking eating, not what's best for the resource or what the size limit should be. A simple gastronomic preference if you will) Walleye--I prefer 18-20"" I like a meatier fillet rather than a crispy fillet but I don't like them so big that I have to cut them into chunks to fit the frying pan. Pike--I don't mess with them until they're big enough to easily fillet out the Y bones which is usually around 26"" depending on girth. Ideal is around 30"". Bass--haven't eaten a bass in a couple decades but tempted to try a smallie based on reports of how good they taste out of cold water. Probably will stick with C & R but 14-15"" seems like it would be about right. Lake trout--never fish for them but curious what size others like to eat. Stream trout I like best at 15-16"" Perch--the bigger the better but nothing under 10"" unless there are children involved. Crappies--13-14"" are ideal, and far to infrequently do I catch them that big but then I don't panfish much. All these comments are based on a pan-fried preparation. I once caught a bunch of small perch out of a lake that needed the perch population thinned (plus I was a penniless college student). I filleted them, boiled them and dipped them in melted butter that had a dash of pepper in it. They were awesome. Had I fried them they would have shrunk to nothing but a wafer."
5325233,stjoeguy,2017-02-10 11:09:00,979,"Walleye - 17"" good size for a plate and small enough to not worry about how much an MNR officer is going to stretch them when he checks the livewell.Crappie - 13-14""?? Boy, I'd like to fish where you fish. Any size is good eating. Minimum size tends to go down as the stock in the freezer dwindles and the bite slows.Perch - 10"" sounds good. They'll go back until I realize I might be getting a meals worth if I start keeping some big ones.Bass - who knows. Never eaten them.Pike - I should keep more but rarely do. First reaction is to let them go and it's not until afterwards that I think I should have kept it to practice on the Y-bones. The only ones that get measured are going to be way too big to eat anyhow.Trout - wouldn't know, either."
5325305,Ricky Spanish,2017-02-10 11:46:00,1298,"Walleye: 14 - 16"" Pike: 26 - 28""Bass: I have never eaten one, but heard it described as ""big bluegill"" when caught from cooler waters. That has me interested. Lake trout: The smaller the better, less than 20"".Perch: 10 - 12""Crappies: 10 - 12"""
5325313,Obabikon,2017-02-10 11:56:00,2370,"Walleye 14"" Pike 24"" Crappie 11"" Perch 10"" I like smaller fillets that fit just right on a piece of bread."
5325465,bigwalleye1,2017-02-10 12:50:00,2632,"I zip my walleye anyway, so anything up to about 17"" will do nicely. Perch 10"" give or take. Bass. No, smallmouth are too much a blast to catch, and largemouth to me have always tasted muddy. Pike depending on the waters, something just under the release zone. They get chunked anyway. Stream trout, I agree with Multispecies guy, 15-16"" Lakers and others, for smoking, doesn't matter. For foiling and broiling, 20"" or so Sunfish half pounders or so, knowing that I have always lived in ""three to the pound"" land. Crappies 12"" before they have a fillet on both sides, but recall the days of 16""+ on Red Lake....."
5325489,retire55,2017-02-10 12:57:00,1029,"About 65 years ago, my Dad introduced me to fishing for walleye and perch in the western basin of Lake Erie. Although we caught many 5 pound + walleye, he only allowed us to keep 14 to 15 inch walleye - his preference for eating. He referred to them as candy walleye. I still believe that's the size that tastes best. 10 inches for perch. 20 inches for lake trout"
5325577,Multispecies Guy,2017-02-10 14:04:00,447,"13-14 would be my ideal. I've certainly eaten smaller but, to me, they don't get shoulders on them until about 13. I spent some time in the South fishing crappies and a 13 down there is like a 10 up here."
5325585,Multispecies Guy,2017-02-10 14:06:00,447,"My dad liked the 12-13"" walleyes and saugers. He said they fried up like potato chips."
5325633,Multispecies Guy,2017-02-10 14:18:00,447,"Speaking of what size walleye is best, does anyone else cut out and save the cheek muscles from the bigger walleyes (18 and better)? I don't keep many walleye but I do keep a few throughout the year both north and south of the border. I cut the cheek muscles out, pull the skin off and save the chunks in a separate bag in the freezer. Toward the end of the year I pull out the bag and fry the cheeks in butter as an appetizer to a meal. The flavor is excellent. I've never thought of doing it with pike until now. Might have to try it this summer."
5325713,bfish,2017-02-10 15:19:00,1096,"Walleye-- around 17-19"" Bass-- 10-13"" where legal, any bigger and to me they get too thick Crappie-16"" is my sweet spot, easy to fillet, thick enough to cook up with falling apart. Perch -- 10"" for fillet, but 8"" is fine for whole Pike-- rarely harvested, but usually go with 2 wide steaks (or half steaks), so size doesn't matter as much Catfish-- about 20"", although smaller ones are good, the work to fillet ratio is too high."
