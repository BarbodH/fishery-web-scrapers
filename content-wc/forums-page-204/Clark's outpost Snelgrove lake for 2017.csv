5226658,maddogg,2016-12-13 09:52:00,178,I fished the lake in the 70's when slate falls had it . Nice lake it was EZ to fish have fun. Keep an eye out for sasquatch.http://bigfootevidence.blogspot.com/...-probably.html

5227618,IAWally,2016-12-14 03:32:00,38,What week in June? Our group will arrive at KCs Landing the first Saturday in June.
5339329,leachmin&worm,2017-02-17 09:50:00,32,"Yea, we leave from Illinois on Saturday June 10, Fly-in on Sunday till Sunday. We fly-out for three extra days at Clarks Camp for filets for home. Return home June 21st. Ten days of FISHING with my SON! Doesn't get any better than that! Hope Snelgrove is remote enough and we can be adventuresome."
5339353,leachmin&worm,2017-02-17 10:06:00,32,"Hey Maddogg, do you remember when you fished Snelgrove if you were able to travel some distance thru the various arms of the lake and can you portage easly into other parts? Thanks"
5339545,Mike Borger,2017-02-17 11:29:00,1554,"I knew there was a reason why Snelgrove sounded so familiar, it was the bigfoot stories."
5344801,maddogg,2017-02-20 15:36:00,178,That was a long time ago 1972 I think.We traveled up the northwestern arm and did quite well where it narrows way down. I don't know about any portages. We had plenty of fish.Good luck
