5323585,Fisherman1792,2017-02-09 15:42:00,927,Enjoy the trip to Alaska! That's one for my bucket list! Good luck on your new adventure and let me know if your ever back in my area. I'll let you know how they're biting. Take care. Fisherman 1792
5323625,wally28,2017-02-09 16:07:00,65,"Does that lake have another name, like Bouchard?"
5324065,wally28,2017-02-09 19:48:00,65,Is there a plac to camp on Kwingwanga and could i get my 17' boat on there? We just may end up at White Lake and try to also fish the other lake.
5334625,Fisherman1792,2017-02-15 05:42:00,927,"No, Bouchard is a small lake before Kwing on the main road. You can get your boat into Kwing and there are camping spots near the launch but not guaranteed to have one, lots of people do camp on some of the points on the lake but you have to go by boat. Let me know whats the dates your possibly thinking of as the summer months the place is full, I like going up in mid sept as its not so busy. Fisherman 1792"
5334633,wally28,2017-02-15 05:48:00,65,"Thanks, RonI'll keep you posted."
5334945,tolsen,2017-02-15 08:18:00,126,"We have a place on the Winnipeg River, we are south of Minaki, but have fished all these areas. I can't speak for the other place, but the whole Winnipeg River system has great fishing! The musky numbers over the last 2-3 years IMO have been up alot, good eater walleyes along with many in the 27-28"" range (we always throw those back). Northern are always on the end of the lines many we average about 80-100 a day and I would say range from 20-35"". Depending on timing you can hammer small mouth. We are usually there around End of May and First week in June. Good luck!"
5338657,Baseline,2017-02-16 20:57:00,3207,I just noticed it today. Check for reply.
5340481,wally28,2017-02-18 03:48:00,65,"Hey Baseline, what campground did you sat in on Separation Lake? Thanks for your help?"
5340577,The tank,2017-02-18 06:34:00,340,The only camp ground is Jordans Separation lake lodge. Winter phone is 217-357-3069. Camp ground phone is 807-224-2612. That's only good during season.
5312409,wally28,2017-02-04 04:43:00,65,"Looking for info on Separation and Big Sand Lake. A buddy and I tent camp, have a 17' boat and fish wallies and pike 8 hrs a day. Will appreciate any advice on either of these lakes. We'll be driving up the middle of June. Is one lake better than the other? Thanks a lot."
5313177,Baseline,2017-02-04 13:55:00,3207,"I've never been to Big Sand, but have been to Separation many times. Separation is part of the English River system. There is fair amount of current flowing through it. It is rocky and has lots of great walleye habitat. Pike and smallmouth are also plentiful. You can expect to catch 30 to 40 walleyes per person for a 4 or 5 hour outing once you get to know a few spots. If you catch a big bite it might be a 100. The average fish we catch is 15 to 18 inches, but there are lots of 20 inch plus caught. Big walleyes come along from time to time. Last September my partner caught a 30 and I had a 28 and 29 during our trip. We also spend some time pike fishing which vary in sizes from snakes to 40 inch plus. Lots of pike in the 7 to 10 lbs range which is fun fishing. Separation has a good population of SMB of all sizes. I've caught bass ranging in size from 6 to 22 inches. If your focus is SMB there are better lakes to fish like LOW and Rainy. I usually stay at the campground which has electric and showers. That's rare for remote camps. I've stayed at the resort and was treated very well. Cabins are on the older side, but a kept up, clean and have everything you need. The guy that runs the campground is a good guy and is very responsive to any requests. About the only thing I would caution you about Separation Lake is that I wouldn't go blasting around the lake until you get your safe routes down. Tracking safe routes on GPS helps. The resort and campground furnishes a photocopy map with routes and fishing spots. Center lake reefs and pinch points are good areas to try. Don't overlook weedy bays."
5313201,wally28,2017-02-04 14:09:00,65,Thanks for all the info! I will take a look at their website. We are primarily after eyes but smallies are fun as well as pike.
5313329,The tank,2017-02-04 15:52:00,340,If your talking big sand north of kenora on the winnipeg river that's a good area to fish. It and separation are very comparable. The big differance is separation has hardly any boat traffic and big sand and area there will be some.
5313793,Guest,2017-02-05 04:22:00,0,"both bodies of water have great walleye fishing, I have fished both over the years. Big Sand- on Winnipeg river more boat traffic- but a larger body of water so more areas to fish somewhat clearer water-walleyes will be a little deeper chips for locators and topo maps are available- helps keep props out of the rocks Separation- on English River less boat traffic darker or more stained water walleyes will be a little deeper topo maps not available"
5323313,aptar,2017-02-09 13:05:00,8,"Hey Baseline, I sent you a private message."
5323353,wally28,2017-02-09 13:32:00,65,"Thanks, but I (wally28) did not get it."
5323401,wally28,2017-02-09 13:51:00,65,"So, still debating between the 2 lakes. Any other suggestions are welcome."
5323537,Fisherman1792,2017-02-09 14:56:00,927,Hey Doug. Too bad that your leaving white lake. Did you get my pm back last summer? How did you make out in September? If your looking for and adventure close to white lake but much more remote have you looked at kwingiwanga? It's north of white lake about 25k up north Reagan Rd. Very good fishing not much for weeds but fish the drop offs and also all the pike you can catch. I usually go in early September so that you can get a camp site. Send me a pm if your interested. Ron Fisherman 1792
5323577,wally28,2017-02-09 15:32:00,65,"Hey Ron, well we did get to W Lake in Sep; it rained several days and the wind from ****; as a result we did only catch a few and they were deep like you said. We will be back to W lake maybe even in late June. My wife and I are cruising the inside passage in Alaska for a week the 9th of June. Lyman and I still may end up in your neighborhood. That Kwingwanga sounds interesting. Thanks and will for sure call if we are near you."
