Good luck."
5333889,farmnfish,2017-02-14 15:46:00,130,"Was there with the family last august. Caught lots of eating size walleye, some bigger, some pike, but didn't fish allot for them. A couple nice smallies when pike fishing. Didn't fish for muskie, but lost a nice one on walleye gear. Since we had kids with us we didn't wonder too far from indian lake. We stayed at indian lake lodge, and wouldnt hesitate to do so again."
5334745,troutwater,2017-02-15 07:10:00,299,"Thanks for the info, sounds like my friend would like that since he just wants to ""catch fish."""

5332241,troutwater,2017-02-14 05:01:00,299,"My best friend finally gets to go on his first Canadian fishing trip this year and it's up to me to pick the lake. I'm more of a muskie guy but he just wants to ""catch fish."" I was looking at the Indian Chain due it being more of a place for numbers(so I've heard) and for the wide variety of species. How is the walleye and pike fishing there? I've heard the pike fishing has got quite a bit better the last several years, but just wanting to ask to make sure. Thanks!"
5332257,IAWally,2017-02-14 05:20:00,38,Our group has been going to the Chain for 7-8 years we really like it. You will almost certainly catch Musky we do while fishing for Walleye every year. Sometimes several each day. Where are you staying?
5332337,troutwater,2017-02-14 06:13:00,299,"I'm looking at Clark's K.C.'s lodge up on Edward(I think). I've stayed with Clark's before and really like how they operate on Cedar. Indian Chain isn't set in stone yet, but definitely on the short list of places I'm looking at."
5332849,walleyehunt13,2017-02-14 09:28:00,10,I stayed on the Indian Chain at both Clarks and KC's Landing. We also caught a few smaller muskies while walleye fishing. We are trying cedar lake this year. Why are you switching from Cedar Lake?
5333041,prov1800,2017-02-14 10:46:00,5010,Fishing wise that would be a poor move.
5333081,troutwater,2017-02-14 10:52:00,299,"Cedar is definitely a great lake, but WAY too many boats on it for me. Last couple times I've been there it's like bumper boats. If I wanted people to continually cut me off fishing I'd stay in the metro!"
5333289,walleyehunt13,2017-02-14 12:08:00,10,Prov1800 is Cedar or Indian better?
5333505,SWM08,2017-02-14 13:15:00,10,"Troutwater, what time of year were you on cedar? I'm booked there the first week in September and hopefully there are less boats then!"
5333553,troutwater,2017-02-14 13:48:00,299,I've been there in early July and middle of August before....pretty busy both times. Never been there in September though. We were chasing muskies and muskie boats were everywhere....thanks Muskyhunter TV!
5333617,prov1800,2017-02-14 14:03:00,5010,Well in my book yes cedar is way better.it is busy but thats because all camps send there guests to all the same spots year after year.i dont have a problem when i fish there because i dont fish those spots.plus iam a little older know and have learned to calm down.lol.fishing is great in cedar plus the crappie fishing as a bonus fish
